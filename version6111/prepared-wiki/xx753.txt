The Channel Tunnel ([tpl]lang-fr|link=no|Le tunnel sous la Manche[/tpl]; also referred to as the Chunnel)[tpl]cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of English|publisher=OUP Oxford|edition=2nd Edition Revised|date=11 August 2005|isbn=3-411-02144-6[/tpl] is a [tpl]convert|50.5|km|mi|adj=on[/tpl] rail tunnel linking Folkestone, Kent, in the United Kingdom, with Coquelles, Pas-de-Calais, near Calais in northern France, beneath the English Channel at the Strait of Dover. At its lowest point, it is [tpl]convert|75|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on[/tpl] deep.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.raileurope.com/us/rail/eurostar/channel_tunnel.htm | title = The Channel Tunnel | publisher=raileurope.com | accessdate =19 July 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/extreme_machines/4217338.html?series=23 | title = Turkey Building the World's Deepest Immersed Tube Tunnel | publisher=Popular Mechanics | accessdate =19 July 2009 [/tpl] At [tpl]convert|37.9|km[/tpl], the tunnel has the longest undersea portion of any tunnel in the world, although the Seikan Tunnel in Japan is both longer overall at [tpl]convert|53.85|km[/tpl] and deeper at [tpl]convert|240|m[/tpl] below sea level.
The tunnel carries high-speed Eurostar passenger trains, the Eurotunnel Shuttle for automobiles and other road vehicles—the largest such transport in the world—and international rail freight trains. The tunnel connects end-to-end with the LGV Nord and High Speed 1 high-speed railway lines.
Ideas for a cross-Channel fixed link appeared as early as 1802,[tpl]cite news | url = http://library.thinkquest.org/5983/pages/chunnel.htm | title = The Channel Tunnel | publisher=library.thinkquest.org | accessdate =19 July 2009 [/tpl] but British political and press pressure over compromised national security stalled attempts to construct a tunnel. The eventual successful project, organised by Eurotunnel, began construction in 1988 and opened in 1994.  At £4.650 billion, the project came in 80% over its predicted budget. Since its construction, the tunnel has faced several problems. Fires and cold weather have both disrupted operation of the tunnel.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/12/transport.channeltunnel1 | title = Channel tunnel fire worst in service's history | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate = 21 February 2014 | date = 12 September 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8421875.stm | title = Thousands freed from Channel Tunnel after trains fail | publisher=BBC News | accessdate = 21 February 2014 | date = 19 December 2009 [/tpl] Illegal immigrants have attempted to use the tunnel to enter the UK,[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7171985.stm | title = Four men caught in Channel Tunnel | publisher=BBC News | accessdate = 19 July 2009 | date = 4 January 2008 [/tpl] causing a minor diplomatic disagreement over the siting of the Sangatte refugee camp, which was eventually closed in 2002.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/may/23/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices1 | title = Sangatte refugee camp |work=The Guardian |location=UK | accessdate =19 July 2009 | date=23 May 2002[/tpl]

==Origins==

===Proposals and attempts===

In 1802, Albert Mathieu, a French mining engineer, put forward a proposal to tunnel under the English Channel, with illumination from oil lamps, horse-drawn coaches, and an artificial island mid-Channel for changing horses.Whiteside p. 17
In the 1830s, Aimé Thomé de Gamond, a Frenchman, performed the first geological and hydrographical surveys on the Channel, between Calais and Dover. Thomé de Gamond explored several schemes and, in 1856, he presented a proposal to Napoleon III for a mined railway tunnel from Cap Gris-Nez to Eastwater Point with a port/airshaft on the Varne sandbankWhiteside pp. 18–23 at a cost of 170 million francs, or less than £7 million.[tpl]cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A00EFD9133DE53BBC4F53DFBE66838D679FDE | title = The Proposed Tunnel Between England and France |work=The New York Times | date = 7 August 1866 | accessdate =3 January 2008 | format=PDF[/tpl]
In 1865, a deputation led by George Ward Hunt proposed the idea of a tunnel to the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the day, William Ewart Gladstone.[tpl]cite book | last = Gladstone | first = William | authorlink = William Ewart Gladstone | editor = A. W. Hutton & H. J. Cohen | title = The Speeches of the Right Hon. W. E.

W. E. Gladstone, M.P. | volume = X | url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Channel_Tunnel | accessdate =13 May 2008 [/tpl]
Around 1866, William Low and Sir John Clarke Hawkshaw promoted ideas, but apart from preliminary geological studies[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8842035 |title=Things Worth Recording about Steam Navigation |newspaper=The Mercury (Hobart, Tas. : 1860 – 1954) |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=9 October 1866 |accessdate=26 April 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl] none were implemented. An official Anglo-French protocol was established in 1876 for a cross-Channel railway tunnel. In 1881, the British railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin and Alexandre Lavalley, a French Suez Canal contractor, were in the Anglo-French Submarine Railway Company that conducted exploratory work on both sides of the Channel. On the English side a [tpl]convert|2.13|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] diameter Beaumont-English boring machine dug a [tpl]convert|1893|m|ft|0||adj=on[/tpl] pilot tunnel from Shakespeare Cliff. On the French side, a similar machine dug [tpl]convert|1669|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] from Sangatte. The project was abandoned in May 1882, owing to British political and press campaigns advocating that a tunnel would compromise Britain's national defences. These early works were encountered more than a century later during the TML project.
In 1919, during the Paris Peace Conference, the British prime minister, David Lloyd George, repeatedly brought up the idea of a Channel tunnel as a way of reassuring France about British willingness to defend against another German attack. The French did not take the idea seriously and nothing came of Lloyd George's proposal.MacMillan, Margaret. "Paris 1919". Random House, 2002, p. 174, 194
In 1929 there was another proposal but nothing came of this discussion and the idea was shelved. Proponents estimated construction to be about US$150 million. The engineers had addressed the concerns of both nations' military leaders by designing two sumps—one near the coast of each country—that could be flooded at will to block the tunnel. This design feature did not override the concerns of both nations' military leaders, and other concerns about hordes of undesirable tourists who would disrupt English habits of living."New Plan for Channel Tunnel" Popular Mechanics, May 1929, pp. 767–768 Military fears continued during World War II. After the fall of France, as Britain prepared for an expected German invasion, a Royal Navy officer in the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development calculated that Hitler could use slave labour to build two Channel tunnels in 18 months. The estimate caused rumours that Germany had already begun digging.[tpl]cite book | title=The Spy Who Spent the War in Bed: And Other Bizarre Tales from World War II | publisher=Wiley | author=Breuer, William B. | year=2003 | location=Hoboken, New Jersey | pages=40 | isbn=0-471-26739-2[/tpl]
In 1955, defence arguments were accepted to be irrelevant because of the dominance of air power, and both the British and French governments supported technical and geological surveys. A detailed geological survey was carried out in 1964–65.[tpl]Cite web|title=Channel Tunnel Site Investigation – 1964 – Halcrow Group|publisher=Halcrow Group|date=13 July 2011|url=http://www.halcrow.com/Who-we-are/film_archive/Channel-Tunnel-site-investigation-film/|accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl]  Online presentation of a 1964–65 film documentary of a geological survey of the Channel, with a brief summary. Construction work commenced on both sides of the Channel in 1974, a government-funded project using twin tunnels on either side of a service tunnel, with capability for car shuttle wagons. In January 1975, to the dismay of the French partners, the British government cancelled the project. The government had changed to the Labour Party and there was uncertainty about EEC membership, cost estimates had ballooned to 200% and the national economy was troubled. By this time the British tunnel boring machine was ready and the Ministry of Transport was able to do a [tpl]convert|300|m|abbr=on[/tpl] experimental drive. This short tunnel was reused as the starting and access point for tunnelling operations from the British side.
In 1979, the "Mouse-hole Project" was suggested when the Conservatives came to power in Britain. The concept was a single-track rail tunnel with a service tunnel, but without shuttle terminals. The British government took no interest in funding the project, but Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister, said she had no objection to a privately funded project. In 1981 Thatcher and François Mitterrand, the French president, agreed to set up a working group to look into a privately funded project, and in April 1985 promoters were formally invited to submit scheme proposals. Four submissions were shortlisted:
The cross-Channel ferry industry protested under the name "Flexilink". In 1975 there was no campaign protesting against a fixed link, with one of the largest ferry operators (Sealink) being state-owned. Flexilink continued rousing opposition throughout 1986 and 1987. Public opinion strongly favoured a drive-through tunnel, but ventilation issues, concerns about accident management, and fear of driver mesmerisation led to the only shortlisted rail submission, CTG/F-M, being awarded the project.Wilson pp. 14–21

===Arrangement===

The British Channel Tunnel Group consisted of two banks and five construction companies, while their French counterparts, France–Manche, consisted of three banks and five construction companies. The role of the banks was to advise on financing and secure loan commitments. On 2 July 1985, the groups formed Channel Tunnel Group/France–Manche (CTG/F–M). Their submission to the British and French governments was drawn from the 1975 project, including 11 volumes and a substantial environmental impact statement.
The design and construction was done by the ten construction companies in the CTG/F-M group. The French terminal and boring from Sangatte was undertaken by the five French construction companies in the joint venture group GIE Transmanche Construction. The English Terminal and boring from Shakespeare Cliff was undertaken by the five British construction companies in the Translink Joint Venture. The two partnerships were linked by TransManche Link (TML), a bi-national project organisation. The Maître d'Oeuvre was a supervisory engineering body employed by Eurotunnel under the terms of the concession that monitored project activity and reported back to the governments and banks.Kirkland pp. 10–11
In France, with its long tradition of infrastructure investment, the project garnered widespread approval. In April the French National Assembly gave unanimous support and, in June 1987, after a public inquiry, the Senate gave unanimous support. In Britain, select committees examined the proposal, making history by holding hearings away from Westminster, in Kent. In February 1987, the third reading of the Channel Tunnel Bill took place in the House of Commons, and was carried by 94 votes to 22. The Channel Tunnel Act gained Royal assent and passed into law in July. Parliamentary support for the project came partly from provincial members of Parliament on the basis of promises of regional Eurostar through train services that never materialised; the promises were repeated in 1996 when the contract for construction of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link was awarded.[tpl]cite web | title = Parliamentary note on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link| url = http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snbt-00070.pdf |publisher=House of Commons Library | accessdate =5 April 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The tunnel is a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) project with a concession.Flyvbjerg et al. pp. 96–97 TML would design and build the tunnel, but financing was through a separate legal entity, Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel absorbed CTG/F-M and signed a construction contract with TML, but the British and French governments controlled final engineering and safety decisions, now in the hands of the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority. The British and French governments gave Eurotunnel a 55- (later 65-) year operating concession to repay loans and pay dividends. A Railway Usage Agreement was signed between Eurotunnel, British Rail and the Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Français guaranteeing future revenue in exchange for the railways obtaining half of the tunnel's capacity.
Private funding for such a complex infrastructure project was of unprecedented scale. An initial equity of £45 million was raised by CTG/F-M, increased by £206 million private institutional placement, £770 million was raised in a public share offer that included press and television advertisements, a syndicated bank loan and letter of credit arranged £5 billion. Privately financed, the total investment costs at 1985 prices were £2600 million. At the 1994 completion actual costs were, in 1985 prices, £4650 million: an 80% cost overrun.Flyvbjerg et al. p. 12 The cost overrun was partly due to enhanced safety, security, and environmental demands. Financing costs were 140% higher than forecast.Flyvbjerg et al. p. 3

===Construction===

Working from both the English side and the French side of the Channel, eleven tunnel boring machines or TBMs cut through chalk marl to construct two rail tunnels and a service tunnel. The vehicle shuttle terminals are at Cheriton (part of Folkestone) and Coquelles, and are connected to the English M20 and French A16 motorways respectively.
Tunnelling commenced in 1988, and the tunnel began operating in 1994.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/1/newsid_2516000/2516473.stm | title = On this day: Tunnel links UK and Europe |publisher=BBC News   | accessdate =19 July 2009 | date = 1 December 1990 [/tpl] In 1985 prices, the total construction cost was £4.650 billion (equivalent to £[tpl]Inflation|UK|4.65|1985[/tpl] billion today), an 80% cost overrun. At the peak of construction 15,000 people were employed with daily expenditure over £3 million.Anderson, pp. xvi–xvii Ten workers, eight of them British, were killed during construction between 1987 and 1993, most in the first few months of boring.[tpl]cite news | first = John | last = Harlow | title = Phantom Trains Wreak Havoc in Channel Tunnel |work=The Times |location=UK | date = 2 April 1995 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ingenious.org.uk/Read/Identity/RailwaysandIdentity/Navvies/ | title = ingenious: Navvies | date = 11 March 2008 | publisher=ingenious | accessdate =19 July 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/thirteen-workers-die-as-safety-standards-are-ignored-in-race-to-build-olympic-sites-558698.html | title = Thirteen workers die as safety standards are ignored in race to build Olympic sites |work=The Independent |location=UK | accessdate =26 September 2008 | date=3 April 2004[/tpl]

===Completion===

A two-inch (50-mm) diameter pilot hole allowed the service tunnel to break through without ceremony on 30 October 1990.[tpl]cite news | title = Britain and France Link Up-at Last | author=Glenn Frankel |work=The Washington Post | date = 31 October 1990 [/tpl] On 1 December 1990, Englishman Graham Fagg and Frenchman Phillippe Cozette broke through the service tunnel with the media watching.[tpl]cite news | title = Chunnel birthday |work=Evening Mail | publisher=Birmingham Post & Mail Ltd | date = 2 December 2000 [/tpl] Eurotunnel completed the tunnel on time, and the tunnel was officially opened one year later than originally planned by Queen Elizabeth II and the French president, François Mitterrand, in a ceremony held in Calais on 6 May 1994. The Queen travelled through the tunnel to Calais on a Eurostar train, which stopped nose to nose with the train that carried President Mitterrand from Paris.[tpl]cite news | title = On This Day – 1994: President and Queen open Chunnel | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/6/newsid_2511000/2511653.stm |publisher=BBC News   | date = 6 May 1994 | accessdate =12 January 2008 [/tpl] Following the ceremony President Mitterrand and the Queen travelled on Le Shuttle to a similar ceremony in Folkestone. A full public service did not start for several months.
The Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL), now called High Speed 1, runs [tpl]convert|69|mi|km|0|[/tpl] from St Pancras railway station in London to the tunnel portal at Folkestone in Kent. It cost £5.8 billion. On 16 September 2003 the prime minister, Tony Blair, opened the first section of High Speed 1, from Folkestone to north Kent. On 6 November 2007 the Queen officially opened High Speed 1 and St Pancras International station,[tpl]cite news | first = Peter | last = Woodman | title = High-speed Rail Link Finally Completed |work=Press Association National Newswire | date = 14 November 2007 [/tpl] replacing the original slower link to Waterloo International railway station. On High Speed 1 trains travel at up to [tpl]convert|300|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on[/tpl], the journey from London to Paris taking 2 hours 15 minutes, to Brussels 1 hour 51 minutes.[tpl]cite news | title = New high-speed rail line opens to link Britain to Europe|work=Channel NewsAsia | publisher=MediaCorp News | date = 15 November 2007 [/tpl]
In 1994, the American Society of Civil Engineers elected the tunnel as one of the seven modern Wonders of the World. In 1995, the American magazine Popular Mechanics published the results.

==Engineering==

Surveying undertaken in the 20 years before construction confirmed earlier speculations that a tunnel could be bored through a chalk marl stratum. The chalk marl was conducive to tunnelling, with impermeability, ease of excavation and strength. On the English side the chalk marl ran along the entire length of the tunnel, but on the French a length of [tpl]convert|5|km|mi|0[/tpl] had variable and difficult geology. The tunnel consists of three bores: two [tpl]convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] diameter rail tunnels, [tpl]convert|30|m|ft|0[/tpl] apart, [tpl]convert|50|km|mi|0[/tpl] in length with a [tpl]convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] diameter service tunnel in between. There are also cross-passages and piston relief ducts. The service tunnel was used as a pilot tunnel, boring ahead of the main tunnels to determine the conditions. English access was provided at Shakespeare Cliff, French access from a shaft at Sangatte. The French side used five tunnel boring machines (TBMs), the English side six. The service tunnel uses Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) and Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS). Fire safety was a critical design issue.
Between the portals at Beussingue and Castle Hill the tunnel is [tpl]convert|50.5|km|mi|0[/tpl] long, with [tpl]convert|3.3|km|mi|0[/tpl] under land on the French side and [tpl]convert|9.3|km|mi|0[/tpl] on the UK side, and [tpl]convert|37.9|km|mi|0[/tpl] under sea.Institute of Civil Engineers p. 95 It is the second-longest rail tunnel in the world, behind the Seikan Tunnel in Japan, but with the longest under-sea section.[tpl]cite news | first = Jane | last = Gilbert | title = 'Chunnel' workers link France and Britain |work=The Daily Post (New Zealand) | publisher=APN New Zealand Ltd | date = 1 December 2006 [/tpl] The average depth is [tpl]convert|45|m|ft|0[/tpl] below the seabed.Kirkland p. 13 On the UK side, of the expected [tpl]convert|5|e6m3|e6cuyd|lk=on[/tpl] of spoil approximately [tpl]convert|1|e6m3|e6cuyd[/tpl] was used for fill at the terminal site, and the remainder was deposited at Lower Shakespeare Cliff behind a seawall, reclaiming [tpl]convert|74|acre|ha|0[/tpl] of land.Institute of Civil Engineers p. 208 This land was then made into the Samphire Hoe Country Park. Environmental impact assessment did not identify any major risks for the project, and further studies into safety, noise, and air pollution were overall positive. However, environmental objections were raised over a high-speed link to London.Flyvbjerg et al. p. 51

===Geology===

Successful tunnelling required a sound understanding of the topography and geology and the selection of the best rock strata through which to tunnel. The geology generally consists of northeasterly dipping Cretaceous strata, part of the northern limb of the Wealden-Boulonnais dome. Characteristics include:
On the English side, the strata dip is less than 5°; on the French side this increases to 20°. Jointing and faulting are present on both sides. On the English side, only minor faults of displacement less than [tpl]convert|2|m|ft|0[/tpl] exist; on the French side, displacements of up to [tpl]convert|15|m|ft|0[/tpl] are present owing to the Quenocs anticlinal fold. The faults are of limited width, filled with calcite, pyrite and remoulded clay. The increased dip and faulting restricted the selection of route on the French side. To avoid confusion, microfossil assemblages were used to classify the chalk marl. On the French side, particularly near the coast, the chalk was harder, more brittle and more fractured than on the English side. This led to the adoption of different tunnelling techniques on the two sides.
The Quaternary undersea valley Fosse Dangaered, and Castle Hill landslip at the English portal, caused concerns. Identified by the 1964–65 geophysical survey, the Fosse Dangaered is an infilled valley system extending [tpl]convert|80|m|ft|0[/tpl] below the seabed, [tpl]convert|500|m|ft|0[/tpl] south of the tunnel route in mid-channel. A 1986 survey showed that a tributary crossed the path of the tunnel, and so the tunnel route was made as far north and deep as possible. The English terminal had to be located in the Castle Hill landslip, which consists of displaced and tipping blocks of lower chalk, glauconitic marl and gault debris. Thus the area was stabilised by buttressing and inserting drainage adits. The service tunnel acted as a pilot tunnel preceding the main tunnels, so that the geology, areas of crushed rock, and zones of high water inflow could be predicted. Exploratory probing took place in the service tunnel, in the form of extensive forward probing, vertical downward probes and sideways probing.Kirkland pp. 21–50

===Surveying===

Marine soundings and samplings by Thomé de Gamond were carried out during 1833–67, establishing the seabed depth at a maximum of [tpl]convert|55|m[/tpl] and the continuity of geological strata (layers). Surveying continued over many years, with 166 marine and 70 land-deep boreholes being drilled and over 4,000-line-kilometres of marine geophysical survey completed. Surveys were undertaken in 1958–1959, 1964–1965, 1972–1974 and 1986–1988.
The surveying in 1958–59 catered for immersed tube and bridge designs as well as a bored tunnel, and thus a wide area was investigated. At this time marine geophysics surveying for engineering projects was in its infancy, with poor positioning and resolution from seismic profiling. The 1964–65 surveys concentrated on a northerly route that left the English coast at Dover harbour; using 70 boreholes, an area of deeply weathered rock with high permeability was located just south of Dover harbour.
Given the previous survey results and access constraints, a more southerly route was investigated in the 1972–73 survey and the route was confirmed to be feasible. Information for the tunnelling project also came from work before the 1975 cancellation. On the French side at Sangatte a deep shaft with adits was made. On the English side at Shakespeare Cliff, the government allowed [tpl]convert|250|m|ft|0[/tpl] of [tpl]convert|4.5|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] diameter tunnel to be driven. The actual tunnel alignment, method of excavation and support were essentially the same as the 1975 attempt. In the 1986–97 survey, previous findings were reinforced and the nature of the gault clay and the tunnelling medium (chalk marl that made up 85% of the route) were investigated. Geophysical techniques from the oil industry were employed.Kirkland pp. 22–26

===Tunnelling===

Tunnelling was a major engineering challenge, with the only precedent being the undersea Seikan Tunnel in Japan. A serious risk with underwater tunnels is major water inflow due to the water pressure from the sea above under weak ground conditions. The tunnel also had the challenge of time: being privately funded, early financial return was paramount.
The objective was to construct two [tpl]convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] diameter rail tunnels, [tpl]convert|30|m|ft|0[/tpl] apart, [tpl]convert|50|km|mi|0[/tpl] in length; a [tpl]convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] diameter service tunnel between the two main tunnels; pairs of [tpl]convert|3.3|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] diameter cross-passages linking the rail tunnels to the service tunnel at [tpl]convert|375|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] spacing; piston relief ducts [tpl]convert|2|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] diameter connecting the rail tunnels at [tpl]convert|250|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] spacing; two undersea crossover caverns to connect the rail tunnels.Kirkland pp. 63–128 The service tunnel always preceded the main tunnels by at least [tpl]convert|1|km|mi|1[/tpl] to ascertain the ground conditions. There was plenty of experience with tunnelling through chalk in the mining industry. The undersea crossover caverns were a complex engineering problem. The French cavern was based on the Mount Baker Ridge freeway tunnel in the US. The UK cavern was dug from the service tunnel ahead of the main tunnels to avoid delay.
Precast segmental linings in the main TBM drives were used, but different solutions were used on the two sides. On the French side, neoprene and grout sealed bolted linings made of cast iron or high-strength reinforced concrete were used. On the English side, the main requirement was for speed and bolting of cast-iron lining segments was only carried out in areas of poor geology. In the UK rail tunnels, eight lining segments plus a key segment were used; on the French side, five segments plus a key segment.Wilson p. 38 On the French side, a [tpl]convert|55|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] diameter [tpl]convert|75|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] deep grout-curtained shaft at Sangatte was used for access. On the English side, a marshalling area was [tpl]convert|140|m|ft|0[/tpl] below the top of Shakespeare Cliff, and the New Austrian Tunnelling method (NATM) was first applied in the chalk marl here. On the English side, the land tunnels were driven from Shakespeare Cliff, the same place as the marine tunnels, not from Folkestone. The platform at the base of the cliff was not large enough for all of the drives and, despite environmental objections, tunnel spoil was placed behind a reinforced concrete seawall, on condition of placing the chalk in an enclosed lagoon to avoid wide dispersal of chalk fines. Owing to limited space, the precast lining factory was on the Isle of Grain in the Thames estuary, which used Scottish granite aggregate delivered by ship from the Foster Yeoman coastal super quarry at Glensanda.
On the French side, owing to the greater permeability to water, earth pressure balance TBMs with open and closed modes were used. The TBMs were of a closed nature during the initial [tpl]convert|5|km|mi|0[/tpl], but then operated as open, boring through the chalk marl stratum. This minimised the impact to the ground and allowed high water pressures to be withstood, and it also alleviated the need to grout ahead of the tunnel. The French effort required five TBMs: two main marine machines, one main land machine (the short land drives of [tpl]convert|3|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] allowed one TBM to complete the first drive then reverse direction and complete the other), and two service tunnel machines. On the English side, the simpler geology allowed faster open-faced TBMs.Kirkland p. 29 Six machines were used, all commenced digging from Shakespeare Cliff, three marine-bound and three for the land tunnels. Towards the completion of the undersea drives, the UK TBMs were driven steeply downwards and buried clear of the tunnel. These buried TBMs were then used to provide an electrical earth. The French TBMs then completed the tunnel and were dismantled.Wilson p. 44 A [tpl]convert|900|mm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] gauge railway was used on the English side during construction.Kirkland pp. 117–128
In contrast to the English machines, which were given alphanumeric names, the French tunnelling machines were all named after women: Brigitte, Europa, Catherine, Virginie, Pascaline, Séverine.[tpl]cite news | url = http://pagesperso-orange.fr/batisseurs-tunnel/3tunnels.pdf | author=Pierre-Jean Pompee | title = Channel Tunnel: Tunnel's Construction | publisher=pagesperso-orange.fr | accessdate =19 July 2009 [/tpl]

====Communications====

There are three communication systems: concession radio (CR) for mobile vehicles and personnel within Eurotunnel's Concession (terminals, tunnels, coastal shafts); track-to-train radio (TTR) for secure speech and data between trains and the railway control centre; Shuttle internal radio (SIR) for communication between shuttle crew and to passengers over car radios.Kirkland pp. 129–132 This service was discontinued within one year of opening because of drivers' difficulty setting their radios to the correct frequency (88.8 MHz).[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]

All tunnel services run on electricity, shared equally from English and French sources. Power is delivered to the locomotives via an overhead line (catenary)Kirkland pp. 134–148 at [tpl]nowrap|25 kV 50 Hz[/tpl].Article: Railway electric traction 9 August 2009
The traditional railway south of London initially used a 750 V DC third rail to deliver electricity, but since the opening of High Speed 1 there is no need to use the third rail system. High Speed 1, the tunnel and the LGV Nord has power provided via overhead catenary at 25 kV 50 Hz. The railways on "classic" lines in Belgium are also electrified by overhead wires, but at 3000 V DC.

====Signalling====

A cab signalling system gives information directly to train drivers on a display. There is a train protection system that stops the train if the speed exceeds that indicated on the in-cab display. TVM430, as used on LGV Nord and High Speed 1, is used in the tunnel.Kirkland pp. 149–155 The TVM signalling is interconnected with the signalling on the high-speed lines either side, allowing trains to enter and exit the tunnel system without stopping. The maximum speed is [tpl]nowrap|160 km/h[/tpl].Article-de: Eurotunnel#Betrieb 9 August 2009

====Track system====

The American Sonneville International Corporation track system was chosen, consisting of UIC60 rails on 900A grade resting on microcellular EVA pads, bolted into concrete.Kirkland pp. 157–174 The tunnel and its terminal areas use a very large loading gauge to allow drive-in shuttle rolling stock.  Through traffic is allowed up to European GC loading gauge via High Speed 1 to St Pancras for passenger traffic or as far as Barking in east London for freight traffic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/strategyfinance/strategy/freightnetwork/ |title=Strategic Freight Network: The Longer-Term Vision |publisher=Department for Transport |accessdate=17 May 2009 [/tpl] Ballasted track was ruled out owing to maintenance constraints and a need for geometric stability.

===Rolling stock===

====Eurotunnel Shuttle====

Initially 38 Le Shuttle locomotives were commissioned, with one at each end of a shuttle train. The shuttles have two separate halves: single and double deck. Each half has two loading/unloading wagons and 12 carrier wagons. Eurotunnel's original order was for nine tourist shuttles.
HGV shuttles also have two halves, with each half containing one loading wagon, one unloading wagon and 14 carrier wagons. There is a club car behind the leading locomotive. Eurotunnel originally ordered six HGV shuttle rakes.

====Freight locomotives====

Forty-six Class 92 locomotives for hauling freight trains and overnight passenger trains (the Nightstar project, which was abandoned) were commissioned, running on both overhead AC and third-rail DC power. However, RFF does not let these run on French railways, so there are plans to certify Alstom Prima II locomotives for use in the tunnel.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/freight/single-view/view/prima-ii-tested-in-the-channel-tunnel.html|accessdate=1 October 2012|title=Prima II tested in the Channel Tunnel|work=Railway Gazette International[/tpl]

====International passenger====

Thirty-one Eurostar trains, based on the French TGV, built to UK loading gauge with many modifications for safety within the tunnel, were commissioned, with ownership split between British Rail, French national railways (SNCF) and Belgian national railways (SNCB). British Rail ordered seven more for services north of London.Kirkland pp. 175–211
At the end of 2009, extensive fire-proofing requirements were dropped and Deutsche Bahn (DB) received permission to run German Intercity-Express (ICE) trains through the tunnel. On 19 October 2010 DB ran the first ICE train through the tunnel, arriving in St Pancras after evacuation tests in the tunnel were a success.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5018915,00.html?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf | title = Deutsche Bahn gets access to Channel Tunnel|work=Deutsche Welle | date = 16 December 2009 | accessdate =20 December 2009 | first = Sam | last = Edmonds [/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.austinnews.net/story/578370 | title = Deutsche Bahn allowed through chunnel|work=Austin News | date = 16 December 2009 | accessdate =20 December 2009 [/tpl][tpl]Failed verification|date=October 2010[/tpl]Planned ICE highspeed service from London to Amsterdam and Frankfurt Around the same time, Eurostar ordered ten trains from Siemens based on its Velaro product.

====Service locomotives====

Diesel locomotives for rescue and shunting work are Eurotunnel Class 0001 and Eurotunnel Class 0031.

==Operation==

===Usage and services===

Services offered by the tunnel are:
Both the freight and passenger traffic forecasts that led to the construction of the tunnel were overestimated; in particular, Eurotunnel's commissioned forecasts were over-predictions. Although the captured share of Channel crossings was forecast correctly, high competition and reduced tariffs led to low revenue. Overall cross-Channel traffic was overestimated.
With the EU's liberalisation of international rail services, the tunnel and High Speed 1 have been open to competition since 2010. There have been a number of operators interested in running trains through the tunnel and along High Speed 1 to London. In June 2013, after several years, DB obtained a license to operate Frankfurt – London trains, not expected to run before 2016 because of delivery delays of the custom-made trains.IGC grants Deutsche Bahn access to Channel Tunnel

====Passenger traffic volumes====

Cross-tunnel passenger traffic volumes peaked at 18.4 million in 1998, dropped to 14.9 million in 2003, then rose to 17.0 million in 2010.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
At the time of the decision about building the tunnel, 15.9 million passengers were predicted for Eurostar trains in the opening year. In 1995, the first full year, actual numbers were a little over 2.9 million, growing to 7.1 million in 2000, then dropping to 6.3 million in 2003. Eurostar was limited by the lack of a high-speed connection on the British side. After the completion of High Speed 1 in two stages in 2003 and 2007, traffic increased. In 2008, Eurostar carried 9,113,371 passengers, a 10% increase over the previous year, despite traffic limitations due to the 2008 Channel Tunnel fire.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.eurotunnel.com | title = Eurotunnel 2008 traffic and revenue figures | date = 15 January 2009 | publisher=Eurotunnel | accessdate =15 January 2009 [/tpl] Eurostar passenger numbers continued to increase, reaching 9,528,558 in 2010.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eurotunnelgroup.com/uploadedFiles/assets-uk/Media/Press-Releases/2011-Press-Releases/110118Eurotunnel-traffic-and-revenue.pdf |title=Eurotunnel 2010 traffic and revenue figures |date=18 January 2011 |publisher=Eurotunnel |accessdate=6 February 2011[/tpl]

====Freight traffic volumes====

Freight volumes have been erratic, with a decrease during 1997 due to a closure caused by a fire in a freight shuttle. Freight crossings increased over the period, indicating the substitutability of the tunnel by sea crossings. The tunnel has achieved a market share close to or above Eurotunnel's 1980s predictions but Eurotunnel's 1990 and 1994 predictions were overestimates.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
For through freight trains, the first year prediction was 7.2 million gross tonnes; the actual 1995 figure was 1.3 million gross tonnes.Flyvbjerg et al. p. 22 Through freight volumes peaked in 1998 at 3.1 million tonnes. This fell back to 1.21 million tonnes in 2007, increasing slightly to 1.24 million tonnes in 2008. Together with that carried on freight shuttles, freight growth has occurred since opening, with 6.4 million tonnes carried in 1995, 18.4 million tonnes recorded in 2003 and 19.6 million tonnes in 2007. Numbers fell back in the wake of the 2008 fire.
Eurotunnel's freight subsidiary is Europorte 2.[tpl]cite news | title = Eurotunnel gets backing for freight service |work=AFX | publisher=Agence France Presse | date = 28 October 2004 [/tpl] In September 2006 EWS, the UK's largest rail freight operator, announced that owing to cessation of UK-French government subsidies of £52 million per annum to cover the tunnel "Minimum User Charge" (a subsidy of around £13,000 per train, at a traffic level of 4,000 trains per annum), freight trains would stop running after 30 November.[tpl]cite news |url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article626416.ece | title = Chunnel cash row threatens freight trains | author=Dominic O'Connell |work=The Times |location=UK | date = 3 September 2006 | accessdate =3 September 2006 [/tpl]

====Economic performance====

Shares in Eurotunnel were issued at £3.50 per share on 9 December 1987. By mid-1989 the price had risen to £11.00. Delays and cost overruns led to the price dropping; during demonstration runs in October 1994 it reached an all-time low. Eurotunnel suspended payment on its debt in September 1995 to avoid bankruptcy.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.josephcoates.com/pdf_files/268_Megaprojects_and_Risk.pdf | title = Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition | publisher=josephcoates.com | accessdate =19 July 2009 [/tpl] In December 1997 the British and French governments extended Eurotunnel's operating concession by 34 years, to 2086. Financial restructuring of Eurotunnel occurred in mid-1998, reducing debt and financial charges. Despite the restructuring, The Economist reported in 1998 that to break even Eurotunnel would have to increase fares, traffic and market share for sustainability.Flyvbjerg et al. pp. 32–34 A cost benefit analysis of the tunnel indicated that there were few impacts on the wider economy and few developments associated with the project, and that the British economy would have been better off if it had not been constructed.[tpl]cite book | author=Flyvbjerg, B. Buzelius, N. Rothengatter, W | year = 2003 | title = Megaprojects and Risk | location = Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | pages = 68–69 | isbn = 0-521-00946-4 [/tpl]
Under the terms of the Concession, Eurotunnel was obliged to investigate a cross-Channel road tunnel. In December 1999 road and rail tunnel proposals were presented to the British and French governments, but it was stressed that there was not enough demand for a second tunnel.[tpl]cite news | title = Eurotunnel unveils plans for second link | publisher=Birmingham Post | date = 6 January 2000 [/tpl] A three-way treaty between the United Kingdom, France and Belgium governs border controls, with the establishment of control zones wherein the officers of the other nation may exercise limited customs and law enforcement powers. For most purposes these are at either end of the tunnel, with the French border controls on the UK side of the tunnel and vice versa. For some city-to-city trains, the train is a control zone.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/section2/chapter_f.html#_Toc44570638 | title = The CPS: Channel Tunnel | accessdate =11 March 2008 |work=Crown Prosecution Service [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] A binational emergency plan coordinates UK and French emergency activities.Kirkland p. 331
In 1999 Eurostar posted its first net profit, having made a loss of £925m in 1995.

==Terminals==

The terminals sites are at Cheriton (near Folkestone in the United Kingdom) and Coquelles (near Calais in France). The terminals are designed to transfer vehicles from the motorway onto trains at a rate of 700 cars and 113 heavy vehicles per hour.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] The UK site uses the M20 motorway for access. The terminals are organised with the frontier controls juxtaposed with the entry to the system to allow travellers to go onto the motorway at the destination country immediately after leaving the shuttle. The area of the UK site was severely constrained and the design was challenging. The French layout was achieved more easily. To achieve design output, the shuttles accept cars on double-deck wagons; for flexibility, ramps were placed inside the shuttles to provide access to the top decks.Kirkland pp. 255–270 At Folkestone there are [tpl]convert|20|km|mi|0[/tpl] of main-line track, 45 turnouts and eight platforms. At Calais there are [tpl]convert|30|km|mi|0[/tpl] of track and 44 turnouts. At the terminals the shuttle trains traverse a figure eight to reduce uneven wear on the wheels. There is a freight marshalling yard west of Cheriton at Dollands Moor Freight Yard.

==Regional impact==

A 1996 report from the European Commission predicted that Kent and Nord-Pas de Calais had to face increased traffic volumes due to general growth of cross-Channel traffic and traffic attracted by the tunnel. In Kent, a high-speed rail line to London would transfer traffic from road to rail.European Commission pp. 220–222 Kent's regional development would benefit from the tunnel, but being so close to London restricts the benefits. Gains are in the traditional industries and are largely dependent on the development of Ashford International passenger station, without which Kent would be totally dependent on London's expansion. Nord-Pas-de-Calais enjoys a strong internal symbolic effect of the Tunnel which results in significant gains in manufacturing.European Commission pp. 248–252
The removal of a bottleneck by means like the tunnel does not necessarily induce economic gains in all adjacent regions. The image of a region being connected to the European high-speed transport and active political response are more important for regional economic development. Some small-medium enterprises located in the immediate vicinity of the terminal have used the opportunity to re-brand the profile of their business with positive effect, such as The New Inn at Etchinghill which was able to commercially exploit its unique selling point as being 'the closest pub to the Channel Tunnel'. Tunnel-induced regional development is small compared to general economic growth.[tpl]cite journal | last = Fayman | first = Sonia |author2=Metge, Pierre |date=September 1995 | title = The regional impact of the Channel Tunnel: Qualitative and quantitative analysis |journal=European Planning Studies | volume = 3 |issue= 3 | page = 333 | doi = 10.1080/09654319508720310 [/tpl] The South East of England is likely to benefit developmentally and socially from faster and cheaper transport to continental Europe, but the benefits are unlikely to be equally distributed throughout the region.

Since the opening of the tunnel, small positive impacts on the wider economy have been felt, but it is difficult to identify major economic successes directly attributed to the tunnel.Flyvbjerg et al. p. 68–69 The Eurotunnel does operate profitably, offering an alternative transportation mode unaffected by poor weather.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12213425 | work=BBC | title = Eurotunnel revenues boosted by shuttle demand|location=UK | accessdate=18 January 2011 | date=18 January 2011[/tpl] High costs of construction did delay profitability, however, and companies involved in the tunnel's construction and operation early in operation relied on government aid to deal with debts amounted.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/eurotunnel-calls-for-government-support-after-record-acircpound13bn-loss-569459.html | title = Eurotunnel calls for government support after record Â£1.3bn loss|work=The Independent |location=UK | first=Michael | last=Harrison | date = 10 February 2004 | accessdate=21 July 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2917255/Eurotunnel-has-4bn-too-much-debt.html | title = Eurotunnel has £4bn too much debt| work=The Telegraph | date = 12 January 2005 | accessdate=21 July 2009 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/feb/21/transportintheuk.politics | title = Debt-laden Channel tunnel rail link is 'nationalised'|work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 21 February 2006 | accessdate=21 July 2009 | first=Andrew | last=Clark[/tpl] Eurotunnel has been described as being in a serious situation.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.adacte.com/economiepolitique/hollandais17062005.doc | title = Facts and figures Eurotunnel 2000-2004/Forecast 2005: Commentry and a suggestion | publisher=Adacte.com | date = June 2005| accessdate=21 July 2009 [/tpl]

==Incidents==

===Fires===

There have been three fires in the tunnel, all on the heavy goods vehicle (HGV) shuttles, that were significant enough to close the tunnel, as well as other more minor incidents.
During an "invitation only" testing phase on 9 December 1994, a fire broke out in a Ford Escort car whilst its owner was loading it on to the upper deck of a tourist shuttle. The fire started at about 10:00 with the shuttle train stationary in the Folkestone terminal and was put out about 40 minutes later with no passenger injuries.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/fire-raises-channel-tunnel-fears-1389084.html | title = Fire raises Channel Tunnel fears | first = Christian | last = Wolmar | date = 10 December 1994 | accessdate =25 December 2009|work=The Independent | location=London[/tpl]

===Train failures===

On the night of 19/20 February 1996, about 1,000 passengers became trapped in the Channel Tunnel when Eurostar trains from London broke down owing to failures of electronic circuits caused by snow and ice being deposited and then melting on the circuit boards.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/wrong-kind-of-snow-in-tunnel-1320248.html | title = Wrong kind of snow in tunnel... | last = Wolmar | first = Christian | date = 22 February 1996 |work=The Independent |location=UK | accessdate =21 December 2009 [/tpl]

===Asylum and immigration===

Immigrants and would-be asylum seekers have used the tunnel to attempt to enter Britain. By 1997 the problem had attracted international press attention, and the French Red Cross opened a refugee centre at Sangatte in 1999, using a warehouse once used for tunnel construction; by 2002 it housed up to 1500 people at a time, most of them trying to get to the UK.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine2002_2/sangatte.html | title = Sangatte: A place of hope and despair | author=Pierre Kremer | publisher=The Magazine of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement |date = February 2002| accessdate =4 August 2006 [/tpl] In 2001, most came from Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran, but African and Eastern European countries were also represented.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/saturday_review/story/0,3605,595996,00.html | title = Strangers in a strange land | author=Caryl Phillips |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 17 November 2001 | accessdate =4 August 2006 [/tpl]
Most immigrants who got into Britain found some way to ride a freight train, but others used Eurostar. Though the facilities were fenced, airtight security was deemed impossible; refugees would even jump from bridges onto moving trains. In several incidents people were injured during the crossing; others tampered with railway equipment, causing delays and requiring repairs.[tpl]cite news | url = http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/07/31/immigration.daring/index.html | title = Desperate journeys fraught with danger | author=Avril Stephens | publisher=CNN | date = 31 July 2007 | accessdate =4 August 2006 [/tpl] Eurotunnel said it was losing £5m per month because of the problem.[tpl]cite news | url = http://212.58.226.40/1/hi/uk/2003977.stm | title = Europe's most notorious refugee camp |publisher=BBC News   | date = 12 July 2002 | accessdate =5 August 2006 [/tpl] A dozen refugees have died in crossing attempts.
In 2001 and 2002, several riots broke out at Sangatte and groups of refugees (up to 550 in a December 2001 incident) stormed the fences and attempted to enter en masse.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/dec/27/immigration.uk | title = Police braced for new tunnel raid | author=Paul Webster |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 27 December 2007 | accessdate =4 August 2006 [/tpl] Immigrants have also arrived as legitimate Eurostar passengers without proper entry papers.[tpl]cite news | url = http://migration.ucdavis.edu/MN/more.php?id=1529_0_4_0 | title = UK/Ireland: Asylum (news digest) | publisher=Migration News | date = 1998 (?) | accessdate =4 August 2006 [/tpl]
Local authorities in both France and the UK called for the closure of Sangatte, and Eurotunnel twice sought an injunction against the centre. The United Kingdom blamed France for allowing Sangatte to open, and France blamed the UK for its lax asylum rules and the EU for not having a uniform immigration policy. The cause célèbre nature of the problem even included journalists detained as they followed refugees onto railway property.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.freemedia.at/cms/ipi/freedom_detail.html?country=/KW0001/KW0003/KW0060/&year=2001  | title = 2001 World Press Freedom Review: France | publisher=International Press Institute | accessdate =4 August 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024205028/http://www.freemedia.at/cms/ipi/freedom_detail.html?country=/KW0001/KW0003/KW0060/&year=2001 |archivedate = 24 October 2007[/tpl]
In 2002, after the European Commission told France that it was in breach of European Union rules on the free transfer of goods because of the delays and closures as a result of its poor security, a double fence was built at a cost of £5 million, reducing the numbers of refugees detected each week reaching Britain on goods trains from 250 to almost none.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2282306.stm | title = Sangatte asylum talks due |publisher=BBC News | date = 26 September 2002 | accessdate =4 August 2006 [/tpl] Other measures included CCTV cameras and increased police patrols.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2017789.stm | title = Tunnel security to be tightened |publisher=BBC News | date = 31 May 2002 | accessdate =4 August 2006 [/tpl] At the end of 2002, the Sangatte centre was closed after the UK agreed to take some of its refugees.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1408494/Blunkett-reaches-deal-to-shut-Sangatte-camp.html | title = Blunkett reaches deal to shut Sangatte camp | author=Philip Delves Broughton and Andrew Sparrow |work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK | date = 27 September 2002 | accessdate =25 February 2009 [/tpl]

===Safety===

The Channel Tunnel Safety Authority is responsible for some aspects of safety regulation in the tunnel; it reports to the IGC.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.channeltunneligc.co.uk/The-CTSA.html?lang=en |title=The Channel Tunnel Safety Authority |first= |last= |work=Channel Tunnel Intergovernmental Commission |year=2013 |accessdate=11 June 2013[/tpl]

The service tunnel is used for access to technical equipment in cross-passages and equipment rooms, to provide fresh-air ventilation and for emergency evacuation. The Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) allows fast access to all areas of the tunnel. The service vehicles are rubber-tyred with a buried wire guidance system. The 24 STTS vehicles are used mainly for maintenance but also for firefighting and in emergencies. "Pods" with different purposes, up to a payload of [tpl]convert|2.5|–|5|tonne|abbr=on[/tpl], are inserted into the side of the vehicles. The vehicles cannot turn around within the tunnel, and are driven from either end. The maximum speed is [tpl]convert|80|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] when the steering is locked. A fleet of 15 Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS) was introduced to supplement the STTSs. The LADOGS have a short wheelbase with a [tpl]convert|3.4|m|abbr=on|adj=on[/tpl] turning circle, allowing two-point turns within the service tunnel. Steering cannot be locked like the STTS vehicles, and maximum speed is [tpl]convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Pods up to 1 tonne can be loaded onto the rear of the vehicles. Drivers in the tunnel sit on the right, and the vehicles drive on the left. Owing to the risk of French personnel driving on their native right side of the road, sensors in the vehicles alert the driver if the vehicle strays to the right side.Kirkland pp. 247–254
The three tunnels contain [tpl]convert|6000|tonne[/tpl] of air that needs to be conditioned for comfort and safety. Air is supplied from ventilation buildings at Shakespeare Cliff and Sangatte, with each building capable of providing 100% standby capacity. Supplementary ventilation also exists on either side of the tunnel. In the event of a fire, ventilation is used to keep smoke out of the service tunnel and move smoke in one direction in the main tunnel to give passengers clean air. The tunnel was the first main-line railway tunnel to have special cooling equipment. Heat is generated from traction equipment and drag. The design limit was set at [tpl]convert|30|C|F|sigfig=2[/tpl], using a mechanical cooling system with refrigeration plants on both sides that run chilled water circulating in pipes within the tunnel.
Trains travelling at high speed create piston-effect pressure changes that can affect passenger comfort, ventilation systems, tunnel doors, fans and the structure of the trains, and drag on the trains.Kirkland pp. 212–230 Piston relief ducts of [tpl]convert|2|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] diameter were chosen to solve the problem, with 4 ducts per kilometre to give close to optimum results. Unfortunately this design led to unacceptable lateral forces on the trains so a reduction in train speed was required and restrictors were installed in the ducts.The Channel Tunnel Experience Lessons for the Future pp. 19–23
The safety issue of a fire on a passenger-vehicle shuttle garnered much attention, with Eurotunnel noting that fire was the risk gathering the most attention in a 1994 Safety Case for three reasons: ferry companies opposed to passengers being allowed to remain with their cars; Home Office statistics indicating that car fires had doubled in ten years; and the long length of the tunnel. Eurotunnel commissioned the UK Fire Research Station to give reports of vehicle fires, and liaised with Kent Fire Brigade to gather vehicle fire statistics over one year. Fire tests took place at the French Mines Research Establishment with a mock wagon used to investigate how cars burned.Kirkland pp. 231–240 The wagon door systems are designed to withstand fire inside the wagon for 30 minutes, longer than the transit time of 27 minutes. Wagon air conditioning units help to purge dangerous fumes from inside the wagon before travel. Each wagon has a fire detection and extinguishing system, with sensing of ions or ultraviolet radiation, smoke and gases that can trigger halon gas to quench a fire. Since the HGV wagons are not covered, fire sensors are located on the loading wagon and in the tunnel. A [tpl]convert|10|in|adj=on[/tpl] water main in the service tunnel provides water to the main tunnels at [tpl]convert|125|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] intervals.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7612776.stm | title = Focus turns to cause of tunnel blaze |publisher=BBC News   | accessdate =12 September 2008 | date = 12 September 2008 | first=Andrew | last=McFarlane[/tpl] The ventilation system can control smoke movement. Special arrival sidings accept a train that is on fire, as the train is not allowed to stop whilst on fire in the tunnel, unless continuing its journey would lead to a worse outcome. Eurotunnel has banned a wide range of hazardous goods from travelling in the tunnel. Two STTS (Service Tunnel Transportation System)[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.eurotunnelgroup.com/uk/the-channel-tunnel/glossary/#s | title=Glossary[/tpl] vehicles with firefighting pods are on duty at all times, with a maximum delay of 10 minutes before they reach a burning train.

==Mobile network coverage==

Since 2012 French operators, Bouygues Telecom, Orange and SFR cover the South part of the tunnel.
UK operators EE and Vodafone have signed ten-year contracts with Eurotunnel.  The agreements will enable both operators' subscribers to use 2G and 3G services. Both EE and Vodafone plan to offer LTE services on the route; EE said it expects to cover the route with LTE connectivity by summer 2014. EE and Vodafone will offer Channel Tunnel network coverage for travellers from the UK to France. The service will begin in March 2014. Eurotunnel said it also held talks with O2 and 3UK but is yet to reach an agreement with either operator.[tpl]cite news | url =http://www.telecoms.com/210882/ee-and-vodafone-offer-channel-tunnel-network-coverage/ | title =EE and Vodafone offer Channel Tunnel network coverage | author=Dawinderpal Sahota |work=Telecoms.com | date = 9 January 2014 | accessdate =11 January 2014 [/tpl]
On 15 January French operators were said to hold the coverage exclusively.[tpl]cite news | url =http://www.telecoms.com/212832/french-threat-prompts-uk-operators-to-strike-channel-tunnel-deal/ | title =French threat prompts UK operators to strike Channel Tunnel deal | author=Dawinderpal Sahota |work=Telecoms.com | date = 15 January 2014 | accessdate =19 January 2014 [/tpl]
