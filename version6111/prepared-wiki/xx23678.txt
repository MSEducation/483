==Early life and education==

A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 in a Tamil Muslim family to Jainulabdeen, a boat owner and Ashiamma, a housewife, at Rameswaram, located in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.[tpl]cite news|title=Dr Abdul Kalam, People's President in Sri Lanka|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2567111001.html|accessdate=3 May 2012|newspaper=Daily News (Sri Lanka) via HighBeam Research|date=23 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last1=Kalam|first1=Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul|last2=Tiwari|first2=Arun|title=Wings of Fire: An Autobiography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=c3qmIZtWUjAC|accessdate=3 May 2012|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Universities Press|isbn=978-81-7371-146-6[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Jai|first=Janak Raj|title=Presidents of India, 1950–2003|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r2C2InxI0xAC&pg=PA295|accessdate=22 April 2012|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Regency Publications|isbn=978-81-87498-65-0|page=296[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://pib.nic.in/profile/apjak.asp |title=Bio-data: Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam |publisher=Press Information Bureau, Government of India |date=1 March 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2012[/tpl] He came from a poor background and started working at an early age to supplement his family's income.[tpl]cite book|last1=Sharma|first1=Mahesh|last2=Das|first2=P.K.|last3=Bhalla|first3=P.|title=Pride of the Nation : Dr. A.P.J.

In his school years, he had average grades, but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn and spend hours on his studies, especially mathematics.

After completing his school education at the Rameshwaram Elementary School, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.[tpl]cite news|title=Kalam meets the teacher who moulded him|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/24/stories/2006092404791000.htm|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=24 September 2006|author=K. Raju|author2=S. Annamalai|location=Chennai, India[/tpl] Towards the end of the course, he was not enthusiastic about the subject and would later regret the four years he studied it. He then moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with the lack of progress and threatened revoking his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. He worked tirelessly on his project and met the deadline, impressing the Dean who later said, "I Dean was putting you Kalam under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".[tpl]cite web|last=Dixit|first=Sumita Vaid|title=The boy from Rameswaram who became President|url=http://getahead.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/mar/18/slide-show-1-achievers-indias-best-students-apj-abdul-kalam.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=18 March 2010[/tpl] For him becoming a fighter pilot was a "dearest dream" but he failed to realise it as he bagged the ninth position when only eight slots were available in the IAF.[tpl]Cite news|title = Failed in my dream of becoming pilot: Abdul Kalam in new book|date = 18 August 2013|url = http://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/failed-in-my-dream-of-becoming-pilot-abdul-kalam-in-new-book/article5035287.ece|newspaper = The Hindu|accessdate = 18 August 2013|location=Chennai, India[/tpl]

==Career as scientist==

After graduating from Madras Institute of Technology (MIT – Chennai) in 1960, Kalam joined Aeronautical Development Establishment of Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) as a scientist. Kalam started his career by designing a small helicopter for the Indian Army, but remained unconvinced with the choice of his job at DRDO.[tpl]cite news|last=Gopalakrishnan|first=Karthika|title=Kalam tells students to follow their heart|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-23/chennai/28168542_1_kalam-primary-school-maths-class|accessdate=4 July 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=23 June 2009|location=Chennai, India[/tpl] Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near earth's orbit in July 1980. Joining ISRO was one of Kalam's biggest achievements in life and he is said to have found himself when he started to work on the SLV project. Kalam first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[tpl]cite book|last=editor|title=A to C (Abd Allah ibn al-Abbas to Cypress).|year=2000|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica (India)|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-0-85229-760-5|page=2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Kpd9lLY_0-IC&dq=abdul+kalam+first+worked+drdo|author2=Ramchandani, vice president Dale Hoiberg; editor South Asia, Indu[/tpl] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the program to include more engineers.
In 1963–64, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton Virginia, Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland and Wallops Flight Facility situated at Eastern Shore of Virginia.[tpl]cite book|author1=Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam|author2=Arun Tiwari|title=Wings of fire: an autobiography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=c3qmIZtWUjAC&pg=PA37|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Universities Press|isbn=978-81-7371-146-6|page=37[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.|title=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6AUAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA32|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=November 1989|publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.|pages=32–|issn=00963402[/tpl]
During the period between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar SLV and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be success.
Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in the development, test site preparation and weapon designing. In the 1970s, a landmark was achieved by ISRO when the locally built Rohini-1 was launched into space, using the SLV rocket. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, namely, Project Devil and Project Valiant , which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship. Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/india_missile.pdf?_=1316466791|format=PDF|publisher=James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at Monterey Institute of International Studies, Nuclear Threat Initiative|date=July 2003|title=Missile Chronology, 1971–1979|accessdate=1 March 2012[/tpl]
His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile program under his directorship. Kalam and Dr. V. S. Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defense Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defense Minister, R.

Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.[tpl]Cite news| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-01-09/india/27782318_1_akash-visual-range-air-to-air-missile-missile-development-programme | title = Missile plan: Some hits, misses | newspaper=The Times of India | first1=Rajat | last1=Pandit |agency=TNN| date=9 January 2008|accessdate=1 March 2012[/tpl] He was the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999.

Kalam is criticised for inaction as a President in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions. Article 72 of the Constitution of India empowers the President of India to grant pardon, suspend and remit death sentences and commute the death sentence of convicts on death row.

==Criticisms and controversies==

The controversy that surrounds Kalam's role as a nuclear scientist, is the lack of reliable and factual reporting of the yield of Pokhran-II tests.[tpl]Cite news| url =http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2619/stories/20090925261902000.htm | title = Pokhran row | newspaper=Frontline | first1=Ramachandran | last1=R. |agency=| date= 12–25 September 2009|accessdate=5 July 2012[/tpl] The director of the site test, K. Santhanam, publicly admitted that the thermonuclear bomb was a "fizzle" test, criticising Kalam for issuing the wrong report. However, Kalam dismissed the claims and R. Chidambaram, a key associate of Pokhran-II, also described these claims as incorrect.[tpl]cite web|author=Hardnews bureau|title=Pokhran II controversy needless: PM|url=http://www.hardnewsmedia.com/2009/08/3161|publisher=Hard News|date=August 2009|accessdate=1 March 2012[/tpl]

===Personal attacks===

In spite of his leading role in the development of Indian nuclear programme, Kalam has received criticism from many of his peers who claimed that he had "no authority" over nuclear science.[tpl]cite news|title=Kalam not qualified to talk about Pokhran II: Sethna|url=http://news.rediff.com/report/2009/sep/01/how-can-kalam-talk-on-pokhran.htm|accessdate=11 November 2011|publisher=Rediff.com|date=1 September 2009[/tpl] Homi Sethna, a chemical engineer criticised Kalam claiming that Kalam had no background in publishing articles in nuclear science, even in nuclear physics. Sethna maintained that Kalam received his masters degree in aerospace engineering, which is a completely different discipline from nuclear engineering, and what various universities awarded him for his achievements had nothing to do with nuclear physics. Sethna, in his last interview, maintained that in the 1950s, Kalam had failed advanced physics courses during his college life and quoted "What does he know (about nuclear physics)....?", on the national television. Homi Sethna also accused Kalam of using his presidency to gain a national stature of a nuclear scientist.[tpl]cite news|title=Kalam doesn't know a thing: Homi Sethna|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2009-09-02/news/27658918_1_pokhran-ii-apj-abdul-kalam-k-santhanam|work=The Economic Times|date=9 September 2009 |accessdate=5 July 2012[/tpl]
Others felt that Kalam had never worked in any of the Indian nuclear power plants and had no role in developing the nuclear weapon which was completed under Raja Ramanna.[tpl]cite news|last=Zeenews bureau|title=Pokhran-II: ex-AEC chief slams Kalam|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/pokhran-ii-ex-aec-chief-slams-kalam_560066.html|accessdate=11 November 2011|publisher=Zee News|date=1 September 2009[/tpl] Kalam worked as an aerospace engineer in a SLV project in the 1970s and from the 1980s onwards, as a project director before he moved to Defence Research and Development Organisation.
In 2008, Indian media questioned his claims about his personal contributions to missile inventions while working in a classified missile programme. The media questioned Kalam taking credit of inventing the Agni, Prithvi and Aakash missile system, while all of these were developed, researched and designed by a group of scientists headed by Kalam and he was involved in getting the funds and other logistic tasks. Ram Narain Agarwal, former director, Advanced System Laboratory and former Program Director of Agni missile was considered to be the real architect behind the successful design of Agni Missile.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2005/07/25/stories/2005072501331400.htm|title=ASL: From long-range missiles to lightweight callipers|last=M.|first=Somasekar|publisher=The Hindu businessline|date=25 July 2005 |accessdate=5 July 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/drdo-agni-missile-project-chief-r.n.-agarwal-retires-after-22-years/1/193340.html|title=Charioteer of fire|last=Chengappa|first=Raj|publisher=India Today|date=8 August 2005 |accessdate=5 July 2012 [/tpl] In his own biography, Kalam credited the development of Agni missile to Dr. Ram Narain Agarwal, an alumnus of MIT.

Indira Gandhi under the directorship of A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, resulted in "total failure".

Kalam was frisked at the JFK Airport in New York, while boarding a plane on 29 September 2011. He was subjected to "private screening" as he does not come under the category of dignitaries exempt from security screening procedures under American guidelines. He was frisked again after boarding the Air India aircraft with the US security officials asking for his jacket and shoes, claiming that these items were not checked according to the prescribed procedures during the "private screening", despite protests from the airline crew confirming him as India's ex-president.[tpl]cite news|title=Outrage over Kalam's frisking, US says sorry|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Outrage-over-Kalam-s-frisking-US-says-sorry/Article1-768549.aspx|accessdate=4 July 2012|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=13 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=U.S. 'regrets inconvenience' after Kalam faces double security check|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2624194.ece|accessdate=1 March 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=13 November 2011|location=Chennai, India[/tpl] The incident was not reported until 13 November 2011.[tpl]cite news|title=Former President A.

Kalam was previously frisked by the ground staff of the Continental Airlines at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi in July 2009 and was treated like an ordinary passenger, despite him being on the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security's list of people exempted from security screening in India.[tpl]cite news|title=Dr A.

==Future India: 2020==

In his book India 2020, Kalam strongly advocates an action plan to develop India into a knowledge superpower and a developed nation by the year 2020. He regards his work on India's nuclear weapons program as a way to assert India's place as a future superpower.
It was reported that, there was a considerable demand in South Korea for translated versions of books authored by him.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=354077 | title = Kalam, the author catching on in South Korea | date=9 February 2006 | accessdate=25 March 2012 | publisher= Outlook magazine | first=PTI [/tpl]
Kalam continues to take an active interest in other developments in the field of science and technology. He has proposed a research program for developing bio-implants. He is a supporter of Open Source over proprietary solutions and believes that the use of free software on a large scale will bring the benefits of information technology to more people.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/India-leader-advocates-open-source/2100-1016_3-1011255.html|title=India leader advocates open source|last=Becker|first=David|publisher=CNET|date=29 May 2003|accessdate=17 July 2012[/tpl]
Kalam set a target of interacting with 100,000 students during the two years after his resignation from the post of scientific adviser in 1999. In his own words, "I feel comfortable in the company of young people, particularly high school students. Henceforth, I intend to share with them experiences, helping them to ignite their imagination and preparing them to work for a developed India for which the road map is already available."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W3K3wQsM9PUC&pg=PA153&lpg=PA153&dq=kalam+%2B+interaction+with+students&source=bl&ots=K01yrB5vKv&sig=Q87cLmvdC6KfHC419LHQ2IDV8Nk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mi_2T6ySBY-y8ASzpbiGBw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=kalam%20%2B%20interaction%20with%20students&f=false|title=A.P.J.
