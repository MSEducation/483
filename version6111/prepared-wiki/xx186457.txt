Jesse Lee Turner is a former American pop singer. He recorded songs for several labels in the late 1950s, including the one-hit wonder "Little Space Girl".
Turner was born in Addicks, Texas and graduated high school in Boling, Texas. His first recording was the single "Teenage Misery" for Fraternity Records. In 1958, he released the single "Little Space Girl" b/w "Shake Baby Shake" on Carlton Records; the tune hit #20 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1959. The follow-up "Thinkin'" failed to chart, and Turner switched to Top Rank Records to release "Do I Worry". The record was promoted poorly and sold correspondingly poorly. Moving to Sudden Records, he wrote and issued "The Elopers" to no success; GNP Records also released "Ballad of Billy Sol Estes" and a second single.
Turner's output (15 known songs) has never been reissued in a compilation  and he is now an evangelist who sings rock and roll songs with Christian lyrics. On his homepage he tells the story of his bad luck in becoming a star.
He currently lives in Texas.
