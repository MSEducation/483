[[Hawthorne Avenue (Ottawa)]]

CATEGORIES: Roads in Ottawa

Hawthorne Avenue is a short street in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Although short, the western half of the street serves as a major connector for residents of Old Ottawa East and Old Ottawa South with the downtown core, as Hawthorne becomes the Pretoria Bridge in the west which crosses over the Rideau Canal in The Glebe. It also intersects Main Street which runs through Old Ottawa East and Old Ottawa South. Hawthorne Avenue continues east of Main Street only as a one-way street until Concord Street South, where it ends as a dead end before an offramp of the Queensway. Hawthorne Avenue runs parallel to the south of the Queensway for its entire length (not to be confused with Hawthorne Road in southeast Ottawa).
