Louis Auguste Sabatier (October 22, 1839 - April 12, 1901), French Protestant theologian, was born at Vallon-Pont-d'Arc (Ardèche), in the Cévennes, and was educated at the Protestant theological faculty of Montauban and the universities of Tübingen and Heidelberg.
After holding the pastorate at Aubenas in the Ardèche from 1864 to 1868 he was appointed professor of reformed dogmatics in the theological faculty of Strasbourg. His markedly French sympathies during the war of 1870 led to his expulsion from Strassburg in 1872. After five years' effort he succeeded in establishing a Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris, L'Ecole de Paris (today: Institut de théologie protestante de Paris) with Eugène Ménégoz and became professor and then dean. In 1886 he became a teacher in the newly founded religious science department of the École des Hautes Etudes of the Sorbonne.
Among his chief works were:
These works show Sabatier as "at once an accomplished dialectician and a mystic in the best sense of the word."
His brother Paul was a noted theological historian.
