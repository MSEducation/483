Azrael started out as a more traditional black metal band. The band themselves describe their first demo as "much more traditional and primitive than our later works ... somewhat of a feeling out process for us".Azrael | Interview | Lords Of Metal metal E-zine - Issue 73: September 2007 With each release they began to add more experimental and unique elements, the Unto Death demo "was a huge leap forward for us ... we were beginning to add some abstract and ambient elements such as the 20 minute noise/ambient track at the end of the demo". With the release of Into Shadows Act II, the band was "beginning to experiment much more and creating very[tpl]sic[/tpl] unique soundscapes and atmospheres". Azrael now describes their current sound as "experimental, atmospheric, dark/black metal".
