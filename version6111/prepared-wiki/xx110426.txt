Robert Banks Stewart (born 16 July 1931) is a Scottish writer for television in the UK, now retired, who was sometimes credited as Robert Stewart early in his career. Banks Stewart contributed extensively to drama for the BBC and ITV for several decades.
Born in Edinburgh, he began writing as a journalist, working for the city's evening newspapers, where he became the youngest news editor in history for the Evening Dispatch. Even then, he used to discuss ideas for television series. Later he became a story editor at Pinewood Studios. Working as a scriptwriter from the end of the 1950s, he worked on such TV series as Danger Man, The Human Jungle, Top Secret and The Avengers ("The Master Minds" and "Quick-Quick Slow Death"). He also contributed a few scripts to the Edgar Wallace Mysteries series of second-features for the cinema.

For HTV, he wrote 5 episodes of Arthur of the Britons. Banks Stewart wrote two highly regarded serials for the BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who: Terror of the Zygons (1975) (which was set in his native Scotland and drew on the Loch Ness Monster legend) and The Seeds of Doom (1976) (which was influenced by The Day of the Triffids).
Banks Stewart continued working in television as a writer, script editor and producer, creating Shoestring (1979-80), which ran for two series on the BBC and following this up with the Jersey set detective drama series Bergerac (1981-89).

At the age of 81, Banks Stewart published his first novel - a thriller entitled The Hurricane's Tail, featuring a British detective called Detective Sergeant Harper Buchanan who uncovers a political plot against the prime minister of a Caribbean island. It was originally envisaged as a two-part TV series, but Banks Stewart said he decided to turn it into a novel after "getting nowhere" with TV executives, which he attributed to ageism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kaleidoscopepublishing.co.uk/press.html|title=Press release |publisher=Kaleidoscope Publishing|date=Undated|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl] 
Banks Stewart said: "I always intended Detective Sergeant Harper Buchanan, the main character of my novel, to be the lead character in a TV series, but pitching to various BBC executives in my late-70s was like talking to a brick wall.
"Based on my experience I would say ageism is, unfortunately, common in the TV industry. It seems that if you're over 70 then TV chiefs take it as read that you are too long in the tooth for today's audiences and can't possibly have come up with a possible winner. 
"I've never written a novel before - never had the need to - but in the end it was the only way to make sure my thriller reached the public."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kaleidoscopepublishing.co.uk/press.html|title=Press release |publisher=Kaleidoscope Publishing|date=Undated|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl]
