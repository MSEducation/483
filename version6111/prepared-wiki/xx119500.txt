Manitoba Theatre for Young People (MTYP) is a theatre for children and young adults in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada performing at the Canwest Performing Arts Centre in The Forks, Winnipeg.[tpl]cite web|title=Manitoba Theatre for Young People|url=http://www.theforks.com/attractions/at-the-forks/manitoba-theatre-young-people|publisher=The Forks|accessdate=10 October 2012[/tpl] MTYP's annual attendance regularly exceeds 100,000 people per year.
Within the theatre complex there are two performance venues: a 315-seat Main Stage and a smaller hall.  The smaller hall does not have theatre seating and as such it is used primarily as a rehearsal hall and multi-purpose room.[tpl]cite web|title=Manitoba Theatre for Young People|url=http://www.cultureandcommunities.ca/cecc/resources/cultural-facility-profiles/artspace-north/manitoba-theatre-for-young-people.html|publisher=Centre of Expertise on Culture and Communities|accessdate=10 October 2012[/tpl] The building also features four classroom studios, production and wardrobe shops, a greenroom, two full dressing rooms, a box office, and lobby. The theatre is 5,270 square feet in size with a 1,344 square feet stage area. The black-box style theatre seats up to 315 and is reconfigurable. 
Manitoba Theatre for Young People is one of only two TYA (Theatre for Young Audience) institutions in Canada with a permanent residence and is the only Theatre for Young Audiences that offers a full season of plays for teens.
MTYP's mission is to produce entertaining professional theatre, provide training in theatre and portray the experience of Canadian children. [tpl]cite web|title=MISSION STATEMENT & MANDATE|url=http://www.mtyp.ca/mission-statement.cfm|publisher=MTYP|accessdate=10 October 2012[/tpl]
