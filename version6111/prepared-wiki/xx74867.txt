[tpl]Baptist[/tpl]The Fundamental Baptist Fellowship Association (FBFA) is an association of independent fundamentalist African-American Baptist churches.
In 1962 Reverend Richard C. Mattox, of Cleveland, Ohio, led conservative-fundamentalist black ministers and congregations to form the Fundamental Baptist Fellowship Association. The association provides fundamentalist black Baptist churches a means of fellowship in the areas of evangelism and foreign missions. Each congregation is independent and autonomous. The FBFA meets on an annual basis.
A number of churches in the Fundamental Baptist Fellowship Association hold dual affiliation with the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches. Headquarters are in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In the area of Christian education, the FBFA partners with Cedarville University in Cedarville, Ohio.
Though largely ignored by books and the Internet, and sometimes confused with the predominantly white Fundamental Baptist Fellowship of America, this association of churches does exist, with churches mostly in the midwestern United States.
