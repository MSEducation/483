Hampstead Heath (locally known as "the Heath") is a large, ancient London park, covering [tpl]convert|320|ha|acre[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Parks_and_open_spaces/Hampstead_Heath/ |title=City of London Hampstead Heath |author= David Bentley |date= 12 February 2010 |publisher=City of London |accessdate=13 March 2010[/tpl] This grassy public space sits astride a sandy ridge, one of the highest points in London, running from Hampstead to Highgate, which rests on a band of London Clay.Hampstead - Hampstead Heath | British History Online The Heath is rambling and hilly, embracing ponds, recent and ancient woodlands, a lido, playgrounds, and a training track, and it adjoins the stately home of Kenwood House and its grounds. The south-east part of the Heath is Parliament Hill, whose view over London is protected by law.
Running along its eastern perimeter are a chain of ponds – including three open-air public swimming pools – which were originally reservoirs for drinking water from the River Fleet. The Heath is a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gigl.org.uk/igigl/siteDetails.aspx?sID=M072&sType=sinc|title=Hampstead Heath|publisher=Greenspace Information for Greater London|year=2006|accessdate=9 September 2012[/tpl] and part of Kenwood is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Lakeside concerts are held there in summer. The Heath is managed by the City of London Corporation, and lies mostly within the London Borough of Camden with the adjoining Hampstead Heath Extension and Golders Hill Park in the London Borough of Barnet.

==History==

The Heath first entered the history books in 986 when Ethelred the Unready granted one of his servants five hides of land at "Hemstede". This same land is later recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as held by the monastery of St. Peter's at Westminster Abbey, and by then is known as the "Manor of Hampstead".Hampstead - Manor and Other Estates | British History Online Westminster held the land until 1133 when control of part of the manor was released to one Richard de Balta; then during Henry II's reign the whole of the manor became privately owned by Alexander de Barentyn, the King's butler. Manorial rights to the land remained in private hands until the 1940s when they lapsed under Sir Spencer Pocklington Maryon Wilson,thePeerage.com - Person Page 7102 though the estate itself was passed on to Shane Gough, 5th Viscount Gough.
Over time, plots of land in the manor were sold off for building, particularly in the early 19th century, though the Heath remained mainly common land. The main part of the Heath was acquired for the people by the Metropolitan Board of Works.Thompson, Hampstead, 130, 165, 195, 317-18, 329- 30; G.L.R.O., E/MW/H, old no. 27/15 (sales parts. 1875). Parliament Hill was purchased for the public for £300,000 and added to the park in 1888. Golders Hill was added in 1898 and Kenwood House and grounds were added in 1928.The London Encyclopaedia, Ben Weinreb & Christopher Hibbert, 1983, ISBN 0-333-57688-8
From 1808 to 1814 Hampstead Heath hosted a station in the shutter telegraph chain which connected the Admiralty in London to its naval ships in the port of Great Yarmouth.
The City of London Corporation has managed the Heath since 1989.Hampstead Heath Before that it was managed by the GLC and before that by the London County Council (LCC).
The City of London proposed to build a new road on the Heath to service their 'Masterplan' developments. The proposal met with protests from local residents and celebrities, and did not proceed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.saynototheroad.blogspot.com/ |title=Say No To The Road |accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl]

==Geography==

The Heath sits astride a sandy ridge that rests on a band of London Clay. It runs from east to west, its highest point being [tpl]convert|134|m|ft[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/LondonBoroughs.php |title= London Borough Tops |work=The Mountains of England and Wales |accessdate=20 March 2010[/tpl] As the sand was easily penetrated by rainwater which was then held by the clay, a landscape of swampy hollows, springs and man-made excavations was created. Hampstead Heath contains the largest single area of common land in Greater London, with [tpl]convert|144.93|ha|acre[/tpl] of protected commons.[tpl] cite web | url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/protected/commons/ | title=Common Land and the Commons Act 2006 | publisher=Defra | date=13 November 2012 | accessdate=3 February 2013 [/tpl]
Public transport near the Heath includes London Overground railway stations Hampstead Heath and Gospel Oak and London Underground stations at Hampstead and Belsize Park to the south, Golders Green to the north-west, and Highgate and Archway to the east. Buses serve several roads around the Heath.

==Areas of the Heath==

The Heath's [tpl]convert|320|ha|acre[/tpl] include a number of distinct areas. "Boudicca's Mound", near the present men's bathing pond, is a tumulus where, according to local legend, Queen Boudicca (Boadicea) was buried after she and 10,000 Iceni warriors were defeated at Battle Bridge.http://books.google.com/books?id=SxCN57GotDkC&pg=RA1-PA363&lpg=RA1-PA363&dq=boudicca's+mound&source=web&ots=cQ-EQNcou8&sig=IyaDjMx9SbrS4PTqCXahW0zOK_E London, Rob Humphreys, Rough Guides Ltd, 2004, ISBN 978-1-84353-316-0 However earlier drawings and paintings of the area show no mound other than a 17th-century windmill.
In the south-east of the Heath, on the southern slopes of Parliament Hill, is the Gospel Oak Lido open air swimming pool, with a running track and fitness area to its north.

===Wildlife===

Hampstead Heath is an important refuge for wildlife, including grass snakes, foxes, rabbits, slow worms, squirrels and frogs. Common kingfishers, jackdaws, pipistrelles and Daubenton's bats are seen over the ponds. Some introduced species have also thrived at the site, for example muntjac deer, terrapins and ring-necked parakeets.

===Whitestone, Highgate and Hampstead Ponds===

Hampstead Heath has over 25 ponds; most of these are in two distinct areas: the Highgate Ponds and the Hampstead Ponds.

====Whitestone Pond====

Whitestone Pond is a roughly triangular pond, centrally located on the Heath's south side and north-northwest of the Queen Mary's House care home (formerly a maternity hospital), across busy Heath Street (A502). This spring-fed pond is the source of the River Westbourne (an 1850s-encased Thames tributary).
It has an exposed location, closely surrounded by roads, which limits its recreational use. It is the Heath's best known body of water, and many people's introduction to Hampstead Heath's ponds.

====Highgate Ponds====

Highgate Ponds are a series of eight former reservoirs, on the Heath's east (Highgate) side, and were originally dug in the 17th and 18th centuries.CIX.co.UK: Hampstead Heath Ponds They include two single-sex swimming pools (the men's and ladies' bathing ponds), a model boating pond, and two ponds which serve as wildlife reserves: the Stock Pond and the Bird Sanctuary Pond. Fishing is allowed in some of the ponds, although this is threatened by proposals to modify the dams.

====Hampstead Ponds====

The Hampstead Ponds are three ponds in the Heath's south-west corner, towards South End Green. One of these is the 'mixed pond', where both sexes may swim. They are the result of the 1777 damming of Hampstead Brook (one of the Fleet River's sources), by the Hampstead Water Company, which was formed in 1692 to meet London's growing water demands.

====Pond maintenance====

In 2004 the City of London Corporation, which manages the Heath, tried to close the ponds on the grounds that they were an unsustainable expense and posed a health risk to swimmers. The swimmers challenged this and won in the High Court. To defray costs, the Corporation introduced a charge for swimmers of £2 per session, £1 for concessions. There was some opposition to this and some of the ticket machines were vandalized.London Pools Campaign: Save the Ponds Campaign
In January 2011 the City of London announced a scheme which it says will improve the safety of the dams in the event of a very rare storm which it says may happen once every 10,000 years.

===Caen Wood Towers===

To the north east of the Heath is a derelict site within the conservation area comprising the grounds and mansion of the former Caen Wood Towers (renamed Athlone House in 1972). This historic building, currently in disrepair, was built in 1872 for Edward Brooke, aniline dye manufacturer (architect, Edward Salomons). In 1942 the building was taken for war service by the Royal Air Force and was used to house the RAF Intelligence School, although the 'official' line was that it was a convalescence hospital. The Operational Record (Form 540) of RAF Station Highgate (currently in the National Archives, Kew) was declassified in the late 1990s and shows the true role of this building in wartime service. The building sustained 2 near misses from V-1 flying bombs in late 1944, causing damage and injuries to staff. The RAF Intelligence School remained in Caen Wood Towers until 1948, when the building was handed over to the Ministry of Health. It was then used as a hospital and finally a post-operative recovery lodge, before falling into disrepair in the 1980s. The NHS sold off this part of their estate in 2004 to a private businessman who is currently redeveloping much of the site; however the House and its gardens fall within the conservation area of Hampstead Heath.

===Parliament Hill Fields===

Parliament Hill Fields lies on the south and east of the Heath; it officially became part of the Heath in 1888. It contains various sporting facilities including an athletics track, tennis courts and Parliament Hill Lido.Camden Council: Contact Parliament Hill Fields Parliament Hill itself is considered by some to be the focal point of the Heath,BBC - Seven Wonders - Parliament Hill with the highest part of it known to some as "Kite Hill" due to its popularity with kite flyers.Hampstead Heath - Sightseeing, Areas & Squares The hill is [tpl]convert|98.1|m|ft[/tpl] high and is notable for its excellent views of the London skyline. The skyscrapers of Canary Wharf and the City of London can be seen, along with St Paul's Cathedral and other landmarks, all in one panorama, parts of which are protected views.
The main staff yards for the management of the Heath are located at Parliament Hill Fields.

===Kenwood===

The area to the north of the Heath is the Kenwood Estate and House - a total area of [tpl]convert|50|ha|acre[/tpl] which is maintained by English Heritage. This became part of the Heath when it was bequeathed to the nation by Lord Iveagh on his death in 1927, and opened to the public in 1928. One third of the estate (Ken Wood and North Wood) is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, designated by Natural England.[tpl]cite web|url=http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&activelayer=sssiIndex&query=HYPERLINK%3D%271003451%27|publisher= Natural England|title= Map of Hampstead Heath Woods SSSI[/tpl]Natural England, Hampstead Heath Woods SSSI citation It is home to many birds and insects and the largest pipistrelle bat roost in London.
The original house dates from the early 17th century. The orangery was added in about 1700.
The popular summer lakeside concerts, which started in 1951, ceased in February 2007 after protests from local residents.End of an Era for Kenwood House Concerts However, the return of the concerts was announced in March 2008 after English Heritage agreed a number of changes with Camden Council, notably with regard to noise levels.IMG and English Heritage announce stunning line up for Kenwood House Picnic Concerts

===The Vale of Health===

The Vale of Health is a hamlet (named "Hatchett's Bottom" until 1801) accessed by a lane from East Heath Road; it is surrounded entirely by the Heath.

===Extension===

The Extension is an open space to the north-west of the main heath. It does not share the history of common and heathland of the rest of the Heath. Instead it was created out of farmland, largely due to the efforts of Henrietta Barnett who went on to found Hampstead Garden Suburb. Its farmland origins can still be seen in the form of old field boundaries, hedgerows and trees.

===Golders Hill Park===

Golders Hill Park is a formal park adjoining the West Heath. It occupies the site of a large house that was bombed during World War II. It has an expanse of grass, with a formal flower garden a duck pond and a separate water garden that leads to a separate area for deer, near a recently renovated small zoo. The zoo has donkeys, maras, ring-tailed lemurs, ring-tailed coatis, white-cheeked turacos and European Eagle Owls among other animals.There are also tennis courts, a butterfly house and a putting green.Camden Council: Contact Golders Hill Park
Unlike the rest of the Heath, Golders Hill Park is fenced in, and is closed at night.

==Hampstead Heath Constabulary==

The "Hampstead Heath Constabulary" consists of twelve constables, four with trained General Purpose police dogs all licensed to ACPO/Home Office standards. They have been responsible for patrolling the Heath since 1992.untitled
They are attested as constables under "Article 18 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation (Greater London Parks and Open Spaces) Act 1967 before a City of London magistrate. In addition, the officers are also appointed with all the powers and privileges of a police constable under Section 16 of the Corporation of London Open Spaces Act 1878, which gives them the powers within any open space under the control of the City of London Corporation. This additional power differentiates them from other parks constabularies, as it gives Heath officers full police powers within their jurisdiction. They enjoy full powers of a constable in relation to the bylaws and  regulations,general law and specific legislation for open spaces. They have a good working partnership with the Metropolitan Police Service and all serious criminal offences are passed over to the Metropolitan Police Service,the territorial police force for Greater London for further investigation.
The constables are paid for out of charitable and private funds held by the City of London Corporation and, as such, their activity is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act.http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2011/fs_50402837.pdf This contrasts with the status of most other constables appointed within non-territorial police forces, such as Port Police.

==Activities==

The Heath is home to a range of activities, including 16 different sports. It is used by walkers, runners, swimmers and kite-flyers, and is regarded as the home of cross-country running in Britain. There is an annual 5000 metres run through the Heath organised by Umbrella,Umbrella - Working For Positive Mental Health and until February 2007 Kenwood held a series of popular lakeside concerts.
