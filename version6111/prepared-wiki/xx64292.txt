===Semiconductors===

China's semiconductor industry has despite extensive governmental support had many problems in areas such as innovative new designs. This may be due to factors such as poorly guided state and local government support for soon outdated technologies and geographically scattered efforts, lacking engineering education, and poor protection of intellectual property. This may change by factors such a new emphasis on market mechanisms rather than direct support, concentration of efforts, return of Chinese who have studied abroad, increased pressure on foreign companies to transfer technology, indigenous Chinese technological standards, and increased demands for indigenous technology in the local market.Suwatchai Songwanich, Opportunities for China's semiconductor industry, March 26, 2012, http://www.nationmultimedia.com/opinion/Opportunities-for-Chinas-semiconductor-industry-30178694.htmlExpectations for China's semiconductor industry during the 12th Five Year Plan, Nobunaga Chai, DIGITIMES Research, Taipei Wednesday 3 August 2011, http://www.digitimes.com/Reports/Report.asp?datepublish=2011/08/03&pages=RS&seq=400

===Machine tools===

Development of advanced machine tools, such as computer numerical control machine tools, are seen as a priority and supported by the Chinese government. China is the world's leading producer and consumer of machine tools.Machine Tools in China, Freedonia Group Inc, August 1, 2011, http://www.marketresearch.com/Freedonia-Group-Inc-v1247/Machine-Tools-China-6501659/ A 2010 US government report stated that US export controls of advanced five axis machine tools were ineffectual due to the technical capabilities of Chinese and Taiwanese manufacturers.U.S. Precision Machine Tool Industry Is No Longer A Global Competetitive Force, March 5, 2010, Manufacturing & Technology News, http://www.manufacturingnews.com/news/10/0305/fiveaxis.html

===Robotics===

In some regions, such as the Pearl River Delta, manufacturers have problems with labor shortages, raising wages, and higher expectations regarding work from more highly educated young people. This has increased the demand for industrial robots. In 2014 China is predicted to be ranked fifth regarding the total number of robots installed and to be ranked first regarding the number of new robots installed."A message from robots â€“ it's our turn". China Daily, 30 December 2011. Retrieved 23 January 2012.

===Textiles===

China in 2012 produced more than one third of the developed world's apparel import but the share has been decreasing in recent years as low-technology and labor-intensive production has been moving to regions like Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe.China's textile industry in crisis, Mar 29 2012, Money Control, http://www.moneycontrol.com/smementor/mentorade/starting-up/chinas-textile-industrycrisis-686377.htmlDexter Roberts, Where Made-in-China Textiles Are Emigrating,  January 12, 2012, Businessweek, http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/where-madeinchina-textiles-are-emigrating-01122012.html

===Mining and rare earth industry===

Advisory firm The Beijing Axis director Lilian Luca in 2010 stated that China was becoming a world leader in mining technology. Technological solutions were initially concentrated on achieving massive low-cost production but increasing emphasis has been placed on environmental and safety issues in part reflecting greater concern in China with environmental issues. China was already a world leader in certain areas such as rare earth elements.Lilian Luca. Transition to the future: mining and mineral processing in China, June 8, 2010, INSEAD,  http://knowledge.insead.edu/economy-China-mining-100608.cfm China has imposed export quotas on rare earth elements, 95% of which are mined in China, citing environmental issues, but has been accused of wanting to force high-tech industry using rare earth elements to move to China.
Finding rare earth elements is only the first and some argue the easiest step. Other steps towards manufacturing such as refining is controlled by China and Japan with the previously dominant United States having lost all of its producers and much of its fundamental technological ability with the number of scientists and engineers in the area declining dramatically.Lou Kilzer, Pentagon 'naive' on rare earth outlook, several experts say, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, April 10, 2012,

===Material science and nanotechnology===

A 2012 study found that China's share of academic papers on nanotechnology had increased from less than 10% in 2000 to nearly a quarter in 2009 and had overtaken the United States for the first position. However, China was less influential in the top three journal and regarding citations. China was increasing its share in influential journals. China was on second place regarding received patents. National standards and oversight bodies had been created.T. V. Padma, China 'soaring ahead' in nanotechnology research, 5 March 2012, Science and Development Network, http://www.scidev.net/en/new-technologies/nanotechnology/news/china-soaring-ahead-in-nanotechnology-research.html

===Chemicals===

KPMG in 2010 predicted that the Chinese chemical industry will become world's largest producer by 2015. The Chinese government aims to make China self-sufficient regarding petrochemicals and plastics with the exception of the raw feedstock of oil and gas. The Chinese industry is increasing R&D in order to create higher value products using more advanced technology.Chemical change on a global scale, KPMG, http://www.kpmg.de/WhatWeDo/23632.htm Another development is increasing focus on environmental concerns and renewable energy technology.China's chemicals sector: Back on track and reinvigorated by the Sustainability Agenda,KPMG, http://www.kpmg.com/uk/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/pages/china'schemicalssectorbackontrackandreinvigoratedbythesustainabilityagenda.aspx

===Agriculture===

There is a lack of arable land and water which means only new technology can increase the output of Chinese agriculture. Former President Jiang Zemin's has therefore called for a "new revolution in agricultural science and technology."Introduction, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, http://www.caas.net.cn/engforcaas/intrduction.htm Restrictions and regulations concerning genetically modified foods have been introduced or proposed after widespread public concern.Monica Tan, China Shuts Down GE Rice?, February 29, The Diplomat, 2012, http://the-diplomat.com/china-power/2012/02/29/china-shuts-down-ge-rice/ China has been buying millions of foreign breeder animal as well as large amount of foreign semen and livestock embryos in order to rapidly improve the genetics of Chinese livestock.P.J.

===Fishing and aquaculture===

In 2008 the fishing industry in China accounted for 34% of the global output. Aquaculture in China had more than twice the output of capture fishing and contributed 62.3% of the global aquaculture   output.The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2010, FAO, http://www.fao.org/fishery/sofia/en The rapid growth of aquaculture is in part due to Chinese research such as regarding the artificial breeding of carps.National Aquaculture Sector Overview: China FAO, Rome.CAFS research achievement CAFS.

===Biotechnology and genetics===

Monitor Group in a 2010 report predicted that China within a decade will become the world leader in discovery and innovation in life sciences. Some research is seen as less controversial in China than elsewhere such as research regarding the genetic causes of intelligence. BGI, formerly Beijing Genomics Institute, has been described as having the world's largest DNA sequencing facilities.Lone Frank, High-Quality DNA, Apr 24, 2011, The Daily Beast, http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/04/24/high-quality-dna.html
Stem cell research and stem cell treatments are less controversial in Chinese culture which have supported Chinese research as well medical tourism to China in order to receive experimental and often unproven therapies. In 2012 a regulatory crackdown was instituted which may increase the ability of the Chinese industry to get approval for sales of future therapies to other nations.Stem cells in China Wild East or scientific feast?, Jan 14th 2010, The Economist, http://www.economist.com/node/15268869China attempts to halt unproven stem cell therapies, 18:45 11 January 2012, New Scientist, http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2012/01/china-halts-new-stem-cell-tria.html More generally, China aims and has made progress towards becoming a world leader in regenerative medicine which also includes areas such as tissue engineering and gene therapy.[tpl]cite doi|10.2217/rme.09.78[/tpl]
China in 2011 stated that biotechnology (including biopharmacy, bio-engineering, bio-agriculture and biomanufacturing) was a major priority for science and technology spending. Biotechnology will be used to enhance economic development as well as for improving Chinese environmental protection, nutrition, healthcare, and medicine. The Chinese governments expects biotechnology to add 1 million jobs during the 2011-2015 period.Wang Yu and Li Xiang , China placing priority on biotechnology, China Daily, 2011-06-28, http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2011-06/28/content_12790544.htm

===Pharmaceuticals and medical technology===

Merrill Lynch predicted in 2011 that China would become the world's second largest pharmaceutical market in 2013 and the largest in 2020.V. Phani Kumar, In China drug industry, reward may outweigh risk, January 14, 2011, Marketwatch, http://articles.marketwatch.com/2011-01-14/markets/30792439_1_drug-makers-drug-industry-drug-market The chief executive of Hoffmann-La Roche in 2012 stated a few years ago many Chinese life sciences scientists had to leave China but that many were now returning to conditions often better than in the West regarding laboratories, funding, and political support for the industry.KEVIN GROGAN, China more positive about pharma than many in west,  MARCH 06, 2012, Pharma Times, http://www.pharmatimes.com/article/12-03-06/China_more_positive_about_pharma_than_many_in_west_-_Schwan.aspx Counterfeit drugs have caused a number of scandals as well as being a problem for drug development and authorities have increased regulations and enforcement.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/nm0410-360a[/tpl]Laurie Burkit, Beijing Authorities Confiscate Fake Drugs, November 2, 2011, Wall Street Journal, http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204528204577011500428003264.html
A 2011 report by PwC stated that a decade earlier China barely had any presence in the medical technology industry but its abilities had been rapidly growing.

===Environmental issues===

Rapid industrialization has been accompanied by many environmental problems and rising pollution in China. One part of the Chinese response involves advanced technology such as the world's largest high-speed rail network and high fuel efficiency requirements for vehicles.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60062-1[/tpl] China is rapidly expanding its wastewater treatment systems and power plant emission reduction systems.World Bank:Stepping up - Improving the performance of China's urban water utilities, by Greg Browder et al., 2007[tpl]cite doi|10.5194/acp-10-6311-2010[/tpl] Due to the Chinese water crisis, as well as for future exports, China is building up its desalination technological abilities and plans to create an indigenous industry. Some cities have introduced extensive water conservation and recycling programs and technologies.MICHAEL WINES, China Takes a Loss to Get Ahead in the Business of Fresh Water, October 25, 2011, http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/world/asia/china-takes-loss-to-get-ahead-in-desalination-industry.html?pagewanted=all

===Power generation and transmission===

As China rapidly industrializes power consumption and power generation are also increasing as well as research on these issues.
Coal is predicted to remain the most important power source in the near future and China has been seen as the world leader in clean coal technology.JAMES FALLOWS, Dirty Coal, Clean Future, DECEMBER 2010 ATLANTIC MAGAZINE, http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/12/dirty-coal-clean-future/8307/1/China's coal reserves 'will make it new Middle East', says energy chief,  Leo Hickman, Tuesday 8 March 2011, The Guardian, http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/mar/08/china-coal-new-middle-eastKEITH BRADSHER, China Outpaces U.S. in Cleaner Coal-Fired Plants, May 10, 2009, The New York Times, http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/11/world/asia/11coal.html In 2009 China become the world's largest investor in renewable energy technologies.[tpl]cite news|last=Black |first=Richard |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8587319.stm |title=China steams ahead on clean energy |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-26 |accessdate=2012-06-25[/tpl] Nuclear power is planned to be rapidly expanded with China wanting to maximize self-reliance in nuclear reactor technology manufacturing and design although international cooperation and technology transfer are also encouraged. Advanced pressurized water reactors such as the CPR-1000 and the AP1000 are the mainstream technology in the near future. Later very high temperature reactors, such as pebble bed reactors, are a priority. By mid-century fast neutron reactors are seen as the main technology.Nuclear Power in China, Updated March 2012, World Nuclear Association, http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf63.html
China in 2012 intended to spend $100 billion on smart grid technology during the next five years, to install 300 million smart meters before 2016, and to become the world leader on electric power transmission.China to install over 300 million smart meters by the end of 2015, Wednesday, March 28, 2012, http://www.ecoseed.org/smart-grid-infrastructure-blog/article/18-smart-grid-infrastructure/12758-china-to-install-over-300-million-smart-meters-by-the-end-of-2015 Ultra high voltage electricity transmission in China is being introduced order to reduce transmission losses.

===Transportation===

Transportation infrastructure continues to be rapidly developed. The National Trunk Highway System was in 2011 estimated to surpass the US interstate system in length.[tpl]cite web|author=Newgeography.com |url=http://www.newgeography.com/content/002003-china-expressway-system-exceed-us-interstates |title=China Expressway System to Exceed US Interstates, newgeography.com, Feb 10, 2011 |publisher=Newgeography.com |date=2011-01-22 |accessdate=2012-06-25[/tpl] Many Chinese cites have or are planning to build metros or other forms of rapid transit.

===Trains===

BBC wrote in a 2011 article on high-speed rail in China that China in 2005 had no high-speed railways. In 2010 it had more than Europe and in 2012 China was expected to have more than the rest of the world combined. China demanded that foreign companies wanting to participate had to share their technology. 10,000 Chinese engineers and academics then in three years produced a faster Chinese high-speed train. China is now exporting it to other nations.[tpl]cite news|last=Robinson |first=Michael |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-10792465 |title=BBC News â€“ China's new industrial revolution |publisher=BBC  |date=2010-08-01 |accessdate=2011-08-14[/tpl] The high-speed rail network has been criticized as a questionable state megaproject aimed at increasing national pride and growth but having had problems such as corruption, construction quality, safety, low utilization due to high ticket prices, and high costs.Keith B. Richburg, Are Chinaâ€™s high-speed trains heading off the rails?, April 23, 2011, Washington Post,

===Motor vehicles===

The automotive industry in China is the world's largest producer of motor vehicles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://oica.net/category/production-statistics/ |title=OICA 2011 statistic |publisher=OICA |date= |accessdate=2012-06-25[/tpl] However, China's indigenous car companies have had difficulties on the global market and the growing electric vehicle market has been seen as way to remedy this. China in 2010 proposed controversial legislation requiring foreign electric vehicle producers to form minority joint-ventures and share technologies with Chinese carmakers in order to get market access.NORIHIKO SHIROUZU, China Spooks Auto Makers Foreign Companies Fear New Rules on Electric Cars Will Erode Intellectual Property, September 16, 2010, Washington Times, A 2011 report financed by the World Bank stated that China was becoming the world leader on electric vehicles.China leading electric vehicle race, study says, 21 April 2011, BBC,

===Shipbuilding===

In 2009-2010 China become the world's largest shipbuilder but South Korea regained the top position in 2011 in part due to more advanced technology. China is developing its technological abilities and competition is expected to increase.Korea overtakes China as world's top shipbuilder in 2011,  01-10-2012, http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2012/01/123_102558.htmlKyunghee Park, Korea Shipyardsâ€™ LNG Skill Beats China Bulk Focus: Freight, September 30, 2011, http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-09-30/korea-shipyards-lng-skill-beats-china-bulk-focus-freight.html

===Entertainment===

The Chinese animation industry and access to the latest technology, such as 3D computer-generated imagery technology, is actively supported by the Chinese government and included in the latest national planning. In part this may be because of a desire to increase Chinese soft power. The same technology as in Hollywood is available and much postproduction is outsourced to China. Successful indigenous artistic creativity is seen as a problem and may be restricted by factors such as production being aimed at getting government patronage rather than public approval, censorship, and some story lines based on Chinese culture not appealing to foreign audiences.Benjamin Haas, Chinese make big push into animation, August 17, 2011, Los Angeles Times DreamWorks Animation, in a joint venture with Chinese companies, will set up a studio in Shanghai that may eventually get bigger than DreamWorks HQ, in part to avoid to quota restrictions on foreign films with China within a decade having been predicted to become the world's biggest cinema and entertainment market.Georg Szalai, DreamWorks Animation to Unveil Landmark Joint Venture in China (Report), Hollywood ReporterRichard Verrier, DreamWorks Animation unveils China studio plans, February 17, 2012 February 17, 2012, Los Angeles Times, Disney has also entered into a partnership in order to help develop the Chinese animation industry.David Pierson and Richard Verrier, Disney to join animation initiative with China, April 11, 2012,

It has been described as a competitor to IMAX and as laying the foundation for Chinese film projection technology using indigenous Chinese technology and intellectual property.Yihang,  Makers of DMAX Aim to Break IMAX Monopoly,  2012-04-09 , China Radio International,

===Polar research===

The Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration (CAA) organizes China's scientific program for both the Arctic and Antarctic.
Polar research by China, in particular in Antarctica, has been growing rapidly with China now having three Antarctic research stations and one in the Arctic on Svalbard.John Garnaut, China has Antarctica in its sights, September 4, Brisbane Times, 2010, Welcome, Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration

===Deep sea exploration===

China is developing its deep sea exploration capabilities, such as by the Jiaolong submersible, with an eye to future applications such as deep sea mining.WILLIAM J. BROAD, China Explores a Frontier 2 Miles Deep,  September 11, 2010, New York Times, http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/science/12deepsea.html

===Space science===

The Chinese space program is a major source of national pride.David Eimer, China's huge leap forward into space threatens US ascendancy over heavens, 05 Nov 2011, The Telegraph, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8872196/Chinas-huge-leap-forward-into-space-threatens-US-ascendancy-over-heavens.html In 1970 the first Chinese satellite, Dong Fang Hong I, was launched.  In 2003 China become the third country to independently send humans into space with Yang Liwei's spaceflight aboard Shenzhou 5. In 2008 China conducted a spacewalk with the Shenzhou 7 mission. In 2011 Tiangong-1 was launched which was the first step towards a Chinese space station around 2020. The active Chinese Lunar Exploration Program includes a lunar rover in 2013 and possibly a manned lunar landing in the 2020s. Experience gained from the lunar program will be used for future programs such as exploration of Mars and Venus.LOUISE WATT, China's Space Program Shoots for Moon, Mars, Venus,  Associated Press, July 11, 2011, http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=14043200#.T3pzd6vmN3k"China could make moon landing in 2025".

===Military technology===

One example of new Chinese military technology is the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile which reportedly has contributed to a quick and major change in US naval strategy.Report: Chinese Develop Special "Kill Weapon" to Destroy U.S. Aircraft Carriers, U. S. Naval Institute, March 31, 2009. China is developing anti-satellite weapons and plans to make the navigational Beidou system global by 2020.Mike Wall, China's Space Advances Worry US Military, 28 February 2012, Space.com, http://www.space.com/14697-china-space-program-military-threat.html Other new technologies include Chinese anti ballistic missile developments, the Chengdu J-20 fifth-generation jet fighter, and possibly electromagnetic pulse weapons."How China is advancing its military reach", 18 January 2012, BBC, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16588557Bill Gertz, Report: China building electromagnetic pulse weapons for use against U.S. carriers, July 21, 2011The Washington Times, http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jul/21/beijing-develops-radiation-weapons/?page=all Chinese reconnaissance satellites are, according to a 2011 report, almost equal to those of the United States in some areas in which China had almost no capability a decade earlier.Simon Rabinovitch, Chinaâ€™s â€˜eye-in-the-skyâ€™ nears par with US, July 11, 2011, Financial Times, http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cf83817a-abaa-11e0-8a64-00144feabdc0.html Despite increased defense spending, China's share of the world's import of arms is rapidly falling, in part reflecting the increased abilities of the indigenous military production.Daniel Ten Kate, China's Share of Global Arms Imports Falls, Sipri Says, Mar 19, 2012, http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-18/china-buys-fewer-weapons-as-local-industry-expands-sipri-says.html  China is also developing power projection military capabilities such as through the Chinese aircraft carrier programme and the Type 071 amphibious transport dock.
15-28% of governmental R&D expenditures may go to military research according to some unofficial estimates. The Chinese defense sector remains almost completely state owned but military equipment production has been reorganized into corporate bodies allowing limited competition and the defense patent system has been reformed to allow greater rewards to innovative enterprises and individuals. The organizational structure has shed civilian applications while at the same time cooperation with the civilian sector has increased and state supported civilian research sometimes have dual use applications. Chinese jet engines remains a problematic area that has caused concern at the highest levels with China still being largely dependent on imports from foreign manufacturers. One possible explanation is a continued Soviet style fragmentation of the research and production line into many isolated units having little contact with one another causing problems with overall standardization, integration, and quality control. More problems from this may be duplication of efforts, dispersal of efforts, and unproductive competition over patronage causing problems such as dishonest reporting of problems. High precision jet engines may be particularly sensitive to accumulated quality problems.Is China About to Get Its Military Jet Engine Program Off the Ground?, Gabe Collins and Andrew Erickson, May 14, 2012, The Wall Street Journal, http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2012/05/14/is-china-about-to-get-its-military-jet-engine-program-off-the-ground/?mod=google_news_blog
