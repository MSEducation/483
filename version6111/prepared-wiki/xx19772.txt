Mantophasmatidae  are a carnivorous African suborder of insects in the order Notoptera, discovered in 2001.K.-D. Klass, O. Zompro, N.P. Kristensen, J. Adis.

==Overview==

The most common vernacular name for this order is gladiators, although they also are called rock crawlers, heelwalkers, mantophasmids, and colloquially, mantos. Their modern centre of endemism is western South Africa and Namibia (Brandberg Massif),Zompro, O.; Adis, J.; Weitschat, W. 2002. A review of the order Mantophasmatodea (Insecta). Zoologischer Anzeiger 241: 269–279.  although a relict population, and Eocene fossils suggest a wider ancient distribution.
Mantophasmatodea are wingless even as adults, making them relatively difficult to identify. They resemble a mix between praying mantids and phasmids, and molecular evidence indicates that they are most closely related to the equally enigmatic group Grylloblattodea. The gladiators initially were described from old museum specimens that originally were found in Namibia (Mantophasma zephyrum) and Tanzania (M. subsolanum), and from a 45-million-year-old specimen of Baltic amber (Raptophasma kerneggeri).
Live specimens were found in Namibia by an international expedition in early 2002; Tyrannophasma gladiator was found on the Brandberg Massif, and Mantophasma zephyrum was found on the Erongoberg Massif.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Zompro | first1 = O. | last2 = Adis | first2 = J. | last3 = Bragg | first3 = P.E. | last4 = Naskrecki | first4 = P. | last5 = Meakin | first5 = K. | last6 = Wittneben | first6 = M. | last7 = Saxe | first7 = V. | year = 2003 | title = A new genus and species of Mantophasmatidae (Insecta: Mantophasmatodea) from the Brandberg Massif, Namibia, with notes on behaviour | url = | journal = Cimbebasia | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 13–24 [/tpl]

==Classification==

The most recent classification recognizes numerous genera, including fossils:
Sometimes the subfamilies and tribes are all raised to full family status.
