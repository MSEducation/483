Frederick is home to Frederick Municipal Airport (IATA: FDK), which primarily accommodates general aviation traffic, and to the U.S. Army's Fort Detrick military installation, the largest employer in the county focusing on multiple bioscience and communications programs.http://www.cityoffrederick.com/DocumentView.aspx?DID=939|work= Comprehensive Annual Financial Report|author=Department of Finance|publisher=City of Frederick, Maryland|page=87|accessdate=24 September 2012

==History==

===Colonial era===

“Frederick Town” was laid out by Daniel Dulany — a land speculator — in 1745;See for example the Overall history of Frederick, pp 2-6. it was settled by a German immigrant party led by a young German Reformed schoolmaster from the Rhineland Palatinate named Johann Thomas Schley (d. 1790), who came to the Maryland colony with his wife, Maria Winz. Schley built the first house of the new town; as late as the 20th century, it stood at the northwest corner of Middle Alley and East Patrick Street. The settlement was founded upon a tract of land granted by Dulany on the banks of Carroll Creek. Within three years, the settlement had become the county seat of Frederick County. It is uncertain which Frederick the town was named for, but the likeliest candidates are Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (one of the proprietors of Maryland),
Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales, and Frederick "The Great" of Prussia.
Most sources favor Calvert .[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
The settlers founded a German Reformed Church (today the church is known as Evangelical Reformed Church, UCC), which also served as a public school, in keeping with the German Reformed tradition of sponsoring universal public education. Many Pennsylvania Dutch (ethnic Germans) settled in Frederick as they migrated westward in the late 18th century. Frederick was a stop along the German migration route that led down through the "Great Valley" (Shenandoah Valley, etc.) to the western Piedmont in North Carolina.
The city served as a major crossroads from colonial times. British General Edward Braddock marched west in 1755 through Frederick on the way to the fateful ambush near Fort Duquesne (later Fort Pitt, then Pittsburgh, in Pennsylvania during the French and Indian War. To control this crossroads during the American Revolution, the British garrisoned a German Hessian regiment in the town during 
 Afterward, with no way to return to their homeland, the men of the Hessian regiment stayed on and married into the families of the town, strengthening its German identity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl]
When President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the building of the National Road from Baltimore to St. Louis (eventually built to Vandalia, the territorial capital of Illinois by the 1850s), the "National Pike" ran through Frederick along Patrick Street. (This later became US Route 40.)

===Early 19th century===

From these early beginnings, Frederick grew to an important market town, but by the first third of the 19th century, the town had also become one of the leading mining counties of the United States, producing gold, copper, limestone, marble, iron and other minerals. As early as the American Revolution, Catoctin Furnace near Thurmont had been a significant site for iron production.J. Thomas Scharf, History of Western Maryland, Vol. I, Philadelphia: Louis H. Everts, 1882, p. 629. In 1831 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) completed its Frederick Branch line from the Frederick or Monocacy Junction off the main Western Line from Baltimore westward to Harpers Ferry, Cumberland, the Ohio River, and eventually Chicago and St. Louis by the 1850s.[tpl]cite book |title=The Great Road: The Building of the Baltimore and Ohio, The Nation's First Railroad, 1828-1853 |last=Dilts |first=James D. |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Palo Alto, CA |isbn=978-0-8047-2629-0 |page=146 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JjrCWPwvHzIC&lpg=PA145&vq=frederick%20branch&pg=PA146#v=snippet&q=frederick%20branch&f=false |accessdate=[/tpl]
When the first wave of Irish refugees from the potato famine settled in the city in 1846, one of the leading members of the Schley family married into the Wilson family from Ireland. Consequently, many of the Schleys converted to Catholicism, and residents of Frederick began to speak English for the first time in the town's history — up until then, the language had been German.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl] Frederick was known during the nineteenth century for its religious pluralism, with one of its main thoroughfares, Church Street, hosting half a dozen major churches. The main Catholic church, St. John's, was built in 1800, then rebuilt in 1837 (across the street) one block north of Church Street on East Second Street, where it still stands. Together, these churches dominated the town, set against the backdrop of the first ridge of the Appalachians, Catoctin Mountain. The abolitionist poet John Greenleaf Whittier immortalized this view of Frederick in his poem to Barbara Fritchie: "The clustered spires of Frederick stand / Green-walled by the hills of Maryland."

===Civil War===

Frederick's status as a major crossroads put the town at the center of the Maryland campaigns of the Civil War, during which both Union and Confederate troops marched through the city. General Stonewall Jackson led his light infantry division through Frederick on his way to the battles of Crampton's, Fox's and Turner's Gaps on South Mountain and Antietam near Sharpsburg, Maryland in September 1862.  An incident with Pennsylvania Dutch resident Barbara Fritchie was commemorated in the poem of the same name by John Greenleaf Whittier. Union Major General Jesse L. Reno's IX Corps followed Jackson's men through the city a few days later on the way to the Battle of South Mountain, where Reno was killed. In July 1864, in the third Southern invasion, Confederate troops led by Lieutenant General Jubal Early fought through Frederick towards Washington DC via Monocacy or Frederick Junction.  Union troops under Major General Lew Wallace awaited the Confederate advancement at Monocacy Junction which led to the Battle of Monocacy Junction.  Slaves escaped from Frederick and the area (since Maryland was still a "slave state" although an unseceeded border state) to join the Union forces, work against the Confederacy and seek freedom.

===Sites of historical interest===

Several historic Civil War landmarks are located in and around Frederick. It was the site of a Civil War succinct speech given by President Abraham Lincoln, on his way to visit Gen. George McClellan after the Battle of Antietam and South Mountain which he gave at what was then the B. & O. Railroad depot at the current intersection of East All Saints and South Market Streets. A plaque commemorates the speech at what is today the 
Frederick Community Action Agency, a community Social Services office).
At the Prospect Hall mansion off Jefferson Street to Buckeystown Pike near what is now Butterfly Lane, in the early morning hours of June 28, 1863, a messenger from President Abraham Lincoln and General-in-Chief Henry Halleck arrived to inform General George Meade that he would be replacing General Joseph Hooker after the latter's earlier disaster at Chancellorsville in May. The Army of the Potomac, which was camped around the Prospect Hall property for the last several days in pursuit of Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia prior to Gettysburg, went on to fight several major battles. A large granite rectangular monument made from one of the boulders at the "Devil's Den" in Gettysburg to the east along the driveway commemorates the midnight change-of-command.  The National Museum of Civil War Medicine is located downtown on East Patrick Street with many exhibits on the state of medicine and surgery under the extreme war-time strains.
Due west along the National Road, now Alternate U.S. Route 40, and west of Burkittsville, lie the sites of three episodes in the Battle of South Mountain: the battles of Crampton's (September 14, 1862), Fox's, and Turner's Gaps, where Confederate troops under Jackson and Walker unsuccessfully attempted to halt the Federal army's westward advance into the Cumberland Valley and towards Sharpsburg in Washington County. The War Correspondents' Memorial stone arch erected by reporter/editor George Alfred Townsend (1841-1914) can be found at Gathland State Park at Crampton's Gap, just west of Burkittsville. The 1889 memorial by Union soldiers of his IX Corps to the slain Major General Jesse L. Reno lies on the south side of the National Road, Alternate U.S. Route 40, west of Middletown, just below the summit of Fox's Gap on Reno Monument Road, along with a more recent Confederate memorial from 1993 to Brig. Gen. Sameul L. Garland, Jr., who was also killed along with a monument (2005), one-half mile south to North Carolina troops who held the line here.
The Monocacy National Battlefield of 1864 lies just southeast of the city limits, along the Monocacy River at the B. & O. Railroad junction known as "Frederick Junction" or "Monocacy Junction"  where two bridges cross the stream - an iron-truss bridge for the railroad and a covered wooden bridge for the Frederick-Urbana-Georgetown Pike, which was the site of the main battle of July 1864.  Some skirmishing occurred further north across the Monocacy at the stone-arched "Jug Bridge" for the crossing of the National Road east of Frederick (built 1806) and an artillery bombardment occurred west of town along the National Road near Red Man's Hill where Prospect Hall mansion was sited as the Union troops retreated eastward.  Antietam National Battlefield and South Mountain State Battlefield Park of 1862 and Gettysburg National Battlefield of 1863 lie approximately [tpl]convert|35|mi[/tpl] to the west and northeast, respectively.
The reconstructed home of Barbara Fritchie on West Patrick Street, just past Carroll Creek linear park, who according to legend waved the Stars and Stripes in defiance of Confederate commander Stonewall Jackson and his troops as they marched through downtown Frederick in 1862, stands as another historical site. Though the legend has been generally discredited, it was widely believed during the Civil War and was the subject of an 1864 poem by John Greenleaf Whittier, a poem that remained popular for decades. Barbara Fritchie, a significant figure in Maryland history in her own right, is buried in Frederick's Mount Olivet Cemetery. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill quoted the famous poem to President Franklin D. Roosevelt when they stopped here in 1941 on a car trip to the presidential retreat, then called "Shangra-La" (now "Camp David") on Catoctin Mountain near Thurmont.
All the Civil War sites around Frederick are recently commemorated by illustrated placards on table-style supports of the new "Civil War Trails" system adopted by several eastern states and their tourism agencies including Maryland . These are connected with appropriate brochures and internet websites for further detailed descriptions. (http://www.civilwartrails.org)

===Late 19th century===

Admiral Winfield Scott Schley (1839-1911) was born at "Richfields", the mansion home of his father. He became an important naval commander of the American fleet on board his flagship and heavy cruiser U.S.S. Baltimore along with Admiral William T. Sampson in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba off the shores of the Spanish island colony of Cuba in the Spanish-American War in 1898. Major Henry Schley's son, Dr. Fairfax Schley, was instrumental in setting up the Frederick County Agricultural Society and the Great Frederick Fair.J. Thomas Scharf, History of Western Maryland, Vol. I, Philadelphia: Louis H. Everts, 1882, pp. 418-19 Gilmer Schley served as Mayor from 1919–1922, and the Schleys remained one of the town's leading families into the late twentieth century.  Nathaniel Wilson Schley, a prominent banker, and his wife Mary Margaret Schley helped organize and raise funds for the annual Great Frederick Fair, one of the two largest agricultural fairs in the State. Since the 1960s, the fair has featured many outstanding country-western singers and become a major music festival.The Great Frederick Fair Official Website Schley Avenue commemorates the family's role in the city's heritage.
The Frederick and Pennsylvania Line railroad ran from Frederick, Md to the Pennsylvania-Maryland State line, or Mason–Dixon line near Kingsdale,PA chartered in 1867, the railroad started construction in 1869 and opened October 8, 1872. It defaulted on its interest payments in 1874 and was subsequently leased to the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1875. In July of that year, PRR formed a new division, the Frederick division to operate the rail line. In the spring of 1896, the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line railroad was liquidated in a judicial sale to the Pennsylvania Railroad for $150,000. 
Jewish pioneers Henry Lazarus and Levy Cohan settled in Frederick in the 1740s as merchants. Mostly German Jewish immigrants organized a community in the mid-19th century, creating the  Frederick Hebrew Congregation in 1858. Later the congregation lapsed, but was reorganized in 1917 as a cooperative effort between the older settlers and more recently arrived Eastern European Jews under the name Beth Sholom Congregation.
In 1905, Rev. E.B. Hatcher started the First Baptist Church of Frederick.
After the Civil War, the Maryland legislature established racially segregated public facilities by the end of the 19th century, re-imposing white supremacy. Black institutions were typically underfunded in the state, and it was not until 1921 that Frederick established a public high school for African Americans. First located at 170 West All Saints Street, it moved to 250 Madison Street, where it eventually was adapted as South Frederick Elementary. The building presently houses the Lincoln Elementary School.

===Notable houses===

Possibly the oldest house in the city of Frederick is Schifferstadt, built in 1756 by German settler Joseph Brunner. It is now the Schifferstadt Architectural Museum.
In 1814, Dr. John Tyler built what is called the Tyler Spite House at 112 W. Church Street in Frederick to prevent the city from extending Record Street south through Tyler's land to meet West Patrick Street.Williams, N.  "This Maryland House was built just for spite", Los Angeles Times, 29 April 1990"A Matter of Spite", Frederick News Post

==Economy==

According to the City's 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,https://www.cityoffrederick.com/DocumentCenter/View/3620|work= Comprehensive Annual Financial Report|author=Department of Finance|publisher=City of Frederick, Maryland|accessdate=6 November 2013 the top employers in the city are:
Frederick's relative proximity to Washington, DC has always been an important factor in the development of its local economy and has greatly affected its growth, particularly in recent years. More recently, its economy has been influenced by it being a center for cancer research, as evidenced by the presence of Fort Detrick, its main employer. Its economy has also been strongly influenced by education, government, health care, mortgage and insurance, banking, science and engineering, tourism, transportation, retail, and construction.
Frederick is the home of Riverside Research Park, a large biomedical research park being developed on Frederick's east side. Current tenants include relocated offices of the National Cancer Institute (Fort Detrick) as well as Charles River Labs. As a result of continued and enhanced Federal Government investment, the Frederick area will likely maintain a continued growth pattern over the next decade.
Frederick has also been impacted by recent national trends centered on the gentrification of the downtown areas of cities across the nation (particularly in the northeast and mid-Atlantic), and to re-brand them as sites for cultural consumption.
Frederick's historic downtown houses more than 200 retailers, restaurants and antique shops along Market, Patrick and East streets. Restaurants feature a diverse array of cuisines, including Italian American, Thai, Vietnamese, and Cuban, as well as a number of regionally recognized dining establishments, such as Volt and The Tasting Room. Outside of the downtown area are garden variety chain dining establishments that comprise a typical suburban landscape (Famous Dave's BBQ; The Olive Garden; Red Lobster; Denny's; etc.) as well as several independently owned restaurants.
In addition to retail and dining, downtown Frederick is home to 600 businesses and organizations totaling nearly 5,000 employees. A growing technology sector can be found in downtown’s historic renovated spaces, as well as in new office buildings located along Carroll Creek Park. Carroll Creek Park began as a flood control project in the late 1970s. It was an effort to reduce the risk to downtown Frederick from the 100-year floodplain and restore economic vitality to the historic commercial district. Today, more than $150 million in private investing is underway or planned in new construction, infill development or historic renovation in the park area.
The first phase of the Park improvements, totaling nearly $11 million in construction, run from Court Street to just past Carroll Street. New elements to the Park include brick pedestrian paths, water features, planters with shade trees and plantings, pedestrian bridges and a 350-seat amphitheater for outdoor performances.
A recreational and cultural resource, Carroll Creek Park also serves as an economic development catalyst, with private investment along the creek functioning as a key component to the park’s success. More than 400,000 sf of office space; 150,000 sf of commercial/retail space; nearly 300 residential units; and more than 2,000 parking spaces are planned or under construction.
Completed projects include:
On the first Saturday of every month, Frederick hosts an evening event in the downtown area called "First Saturday." Each Saturday has a theme, and activities are planned around those themes in the downtown area (particularly around the Carroll Creek Promenade). The event spans a 10-block area of Frederick and takes place from 5-9 PM. During the late spring, summer, and early fall months, this event draws particularly large crowds from neighboring cities and towns in Maryland, and nearby locations in the tri-state area (Virginia and Pennsylvania). The average number of attendees visiting downtown Frederick during first Saturday events is around 11,000, with higher numbers from May to October.

===Cityscape===

Frederick is well known for the "clustered spires" skyline of its historic downtown churches. These spires are depicted on the city's seal and many other city-affiliated logos and insignia.
The housing stock of downtown Frederick is mostly composed of 19th and 20th-century row housing and duplexes.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] The scale of this older part of the city is dense, with streets and sidewalks suitable for pedestrians, and a variety of shops and restaurants, comprising what Forbes magazine in 2010 called one of the United States' "Greatest Neighborhoods".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/11/03/americas-best-neighborhoods-2010-business-beltway-best-neighborhoods.html | work=Forbes | first=Brian | last=Wingfield | title=America's Best Neighborhoods 2010 | date=2010-11-03[/tpl] Adjacent to downtown are many older communities composed of larger, detached housing built mostly in the early 20th century.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Beyond that is housing from the mid-20th century and beyond, becoming suburban in character the further one travels out. The most extensive growth is to the south of the downtown area, including the business corridor along Maryland highway 85 (Buckeystown Pike) outside the city.
Frederick has a bridge painted with a mural titled Community Bridge.  The artist William Cochran has been acclaimed for the trompe l'oeil realism of the mural.  Thousands of people sent ideas representing "community", which he painted on the stonework of the bridge. The residents of Frederick call it "the mural", "painted bridge", or more commonly, the "mural bridge".http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/maryland/frederick-and-western-maryland/review-453201.html
