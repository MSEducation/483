Tux is a penguin character and the official mascot of the Linux kernel.Linux Logos and Mascots. linux.org Originally created as an entry to a Linux logo competition, Tux is the most commonly used icon for Linux, although different Linux distributions depict Tux in various styles. In video games featuring the character, female counterparts named Penny and Gown accompany him. The character is used in many other Linux programs and as a general symbol of Linux.

==History==

===Origins===

The concept of the Linux mascot being a penguin came from Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. Tux was created by Larry Ewing in 1996 after an initial suggestion made by Alan CoxRe: Linux logo. Ussg.iu.edu (1996-05-02). Retrieved on 2013-07-04. and further refined by Linus Torvalds on the Linux kernel mailing list.Re: Linux Logo prototype. Ussg.iu.edu (1996-05-09). Retrieved on 2013-07-04. Torvalds took his inspiration from an image he found on an FTP site,Re: Linux logo. Lkml.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-04. showing a penguin figurine looking strangely like the Creature Comforts characters made by Nick Park. The first person to call the penguin "Tux" was James Hughes, who said that it stood for "(T)orvalds (U)ni(X)".Re: Let's name the penguin! (was: Re: Linux 2.0 really _is_ released..). Ussg.iu.edu (1996-06-10). Retrieved on 2013-07-04. However, tux is also an abbreviation of tuxedo, the outfit which springs to mind when one sees a penguin.
Tux was originally designed as a submission for a Linux logo contest. Three such competitions took place; Tux won none of them. This is why Tux is formally known as the Linux mascot and not the logo.The History of Tux the Linux Penguin. Sjbaker.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-04.

According to Jeff Ayers, Linus Torvalds had a "fixation for flightless, fat waterfowl" and Torvalds claims to have contracted "penguinitis" after being gently nibbled by a penguin: "Penguinitis makes you stay awake at nights just thinking about penguins and feeling great love towards them."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/03/42209|title=The Story Behind Tux the Penguin|first=Michelle|last=Delio|date=2001-03-13|accessdate=2012-09-23 |publisher=wired.com[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] Torvalds' supposed illness is a joke, but he really was bitten by a Little Penguin on a visit to the National Zoo & Aquarium, Canberra, Australia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linux.org.au/linux/tux|title="Tux" the Aussie Penguin|publisher=Linux Australia|accessdate=2006-06-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060507115127/http://www.linux.org.au/linux/tux  |archivedate = 2006-05-07[/tpl] Torvalds was looking for something fun and sympathetic to associate with Linux, and a slightly fat penguin sitting down after having had a great meal perfectly fit the bill.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linux.org/info/penguin.html|title=Why a Penguin?|publisher=Linux Online|accessdate=2009-05-19 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100815081131/http://www.linux.org/info/penguin.html |archivedate= 2010, 08, 15[/tpl]

===Linux for Workgroups 2013===

For the Linux 3.11-rc1 release, Linus Torvalds changed the code name from "Unicycling Gorilla" to "Linux for Workgroups" and modified the logo that some systems display when booting to depict a Tux holding a flag with a symbol that is reminiscent of the logo of Windows for Workgroups 3.11, which was released in 1993.Linux for Workgroups, The H Open, 2013-07-15

==Uses and reception==

In some Linux distributions, for example Gentoo,[tpl]cite web|url=https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-689963-start-0.html |title=Gentoo Forums :: View topic - Tux at top of screen during boot? |publisher=Forums.gentoo.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl] Tux greets the user during booting with multi-processor systems displaying multiple images of Tux, one for each processor core.

===Video games===

Tux has taken on a role in the Linux community similar to that which Mario holds in the Nintendo community. He has been featured in open-source look-alikes of other mainstream games, such as Tux Racer, Extreme Tux Racer, Tux Math Scrabble, TuxWordSmith Tux Math, SuperTux, SuperTuxKart, and Tux Paint. See also List of video games with Tux below.

====Female Tux versions in video games====

Some games that star Tux also include explicitly female penguin characters, allowing the players to play as one of those characters instead of Tux. One such female penguin is Tux's friend "Gown". Gown is variously depicted as being a pink version of Tux (XTux) or as having a somewhat less fat appearance and wearing items of clothing such as a red and white short skirt and a hair bow (e.g. TuxKart and A Quest for Herring).[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
In SuperTux and SuperTuxKart, there is a different female penguin called "Penny" who is purple and white (SuperTuxKart once had Gown and still has a map called "Gown's Bow"). In the arcade game Tux 2 there is a female penguin called "Trixi", and in FreeCiv the female leader name for the Antarctican civilization is "Tuxette".[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
