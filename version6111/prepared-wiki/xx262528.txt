Cooper's career began in the early 1970s at WCBS-TV, where he was writer and producer of Channel 2 News From The Newsroom, the first ever daily newscast to be aired from a working newsroom. During his time there, he worked with many prominent names including John Stossel, Linda Ellerbee, Lynn Sherr, Dave Marash, Rolland Smith, Pia Lindstrom and Joel Siegel among many others.
He resigned from WCBS-TV in 1976, after stating that he no longer liked the direction the program was heading in and was asked to join WABC-TV, where he was Assistant News Director of Eyewitness News for the next year. Here, Cooper received an Emmy for Outstanding News Coverage for mounting television's first newscast anchored live from the location of a breaking story.
It was during this time that Cooper also produced and directed the first music videos made for Warner Bros. Records, including videos for Rod Stewart, Seals and Crofts and Little Feat with Lowell George.

===Police films for the NYPD===

In 1981, Cooper went on to produce a multi-award-winning series for the New York City Police Department (NYPD). He was asked by New York City Police Commissioner at the time, Robert McGuire, to "make dramatic films containing storylines built around constitutional law issues" to improve teaching of constitutional law to police officers.[tpl]cite news|last=Basler|first=Barbara|title=New Police Training Films Take Cue From TV|url=http://dancooper.tv/jobseek/times.htm|accessdate=3 July 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 20, 1984[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Sotemayor|first=John|title=New York: Day By Day|url=http://dancooper.tv/jobseek/specda.htm|accessdate=3 July 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 12, 1986[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Tyre|first=Peg|title=Police Academy IV|url=http://dancooper.tv/jobseek/nymag-pd.jpg|accessdate=3 July 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 July 1986[/tpl] The movies starred James Earl Jones, Sam Waterston, Ken Howard, Rob Morrow among many others, while the cop roles were acted by 35 real police officers.

===Controversies===

In 2005, Cooper began writing a memoir, a dark comedy about his life and of his time working at Fox News titled Naked Launch, that contains criticism towards Fox News and its co-creator, Roger Ailes. The book received a lot of critical acclaim after Cooper began posting chapters of it on his website.[tpl]cite web|last=Cooper|first=Dan|title=Naked Launch: The Prologue|url=http://www.dancooper.tv/NakedLaunch.htm|publisher=Dan Cooper|accessdate=3 July 2011[/tpl] Naked Launch (and various interviews and news articles published after the book's launch) reveals that Cooper was at one point Roger Ailes's "confidante", exposing many details of Ailes's "paranoid" persona.Naked Launch: Prologue plus extras.

In 2009, Keith Olbermann accused Cooper of a Twitter defamatory conspiracy against him on his MSNBC broadcast, Countdown with Keith Olbermann.[tpl]cite web|last=Howe|first=Caleb|title=Keith Olbermann: Twitt|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/03/29/keith-olbermann-twit/|publisher=Politics Daily|accessdate=3 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Carson|first=Bob|title=Is Dan Cooper pretending to be Keith Olbermann?|url=http://www.nowpublic.com/culture/dan-cooper-pretending-be-keith-olbermann|publisher=Now Public|accessdate=3 July 2011[/tpl] Olbermann implied that Dan was part of the Fox News plot to defame him; specifically, running the Twitter account which Olbermann claimed he hadn't set up, even though MSNBC held the account in Olbermann's name.[tpl]cite web|last=Olbermann|first=Keith|title=Countdown with Keith Olbermann' for Friday, March 20, 2009|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29836240/|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=3 July 2011[/tpl] The accusations started when Olbermann allegedly received a Twitter email with Dan Cooper's name in it, which was later revealed to have been a Dan Cooper fan who was urging Olbermann to follow Cooper on Twitter.
