"Jenny Don't Be Hasty" is a song by Scottish singer/songwriter Paolo Nutini, written with Jimmy Hogarth and produced by Hogarth, which was his second single released on 25 September 2006. It was taken from his debut album These Streets, and was the follow-up to Nutini's debut single "Last Request". The lyrics, a personal experience of the singer, are about an 18 year old boy who wants to have a relationship with an older woman who is angry at him for having lied to her about his real age, and now says he is too young. This song reached #20 on the UK Singles Chart, and in Australia it peaked at #40 in the ARIA Charts on 8 April 2007.
