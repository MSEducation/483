This is the album that put the band back into commercial success after their 1987 release Za sve ove godine. Perhaps the most notable songs on this album are "Sviđa mi se ova stvar" which samples Los Lobos' "La Bamba", and The Isley Brothers' tune "Twist and Shout". The other song that is significant on this album is the song "Ti znaš" which has an opening guitar riff almost identical to U2's "Bad".
