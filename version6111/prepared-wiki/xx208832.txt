====Connecticut v. Turner====

In July 2009 the Connecticut case was handed to a division of the state court that handles more serious matters.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.philly.com/philly/wires/ap/news/state/new_jersey/20090714_ap_njbloggersviolencecaseinconncontinued.html | title=NJ blogger's violence case in Conn. continued | publisher=Philadelphia Inquirer | date= July 14, 2009 | first= | last= | accessdate =2009-07-15[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] In early February 2011, Turner appeared in a Hartford court for the Connecticut v. Turner pre-trial hearing on three counts of inciting injuries to persons.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2011/02/north_bergen_shock_jock_hal_tu.html | title=North Bergen "shock jock" Hal Turner in Connecticut tomorrow for hearing on charges he encouraged violence against lawmakers  | publisher=The Jersey Journal  | date= February 15, 2011  | first= | last= | accessdate =2011-03-15[/tpl] The three felony counts Turner is facing each carry one to 10 years in prison.
In late February 2011, the federal government reported that e-mails "show it appears Turner plans to pursue judicial and law-enforcement officials after he’s released from prison." On February 2, Turner wrote "when I get out, I’m gonna go after some ‘problems’ and take care of them in a manner that will be horrific."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-28/u-s-wants-to-destroy-convicted-blogger-hal-turner-s-guns.html | title=U.S. Wants to Destroy Convicted Blogger Hal Turner’s Guns   | publisher=Business Week  | date= February 28, 2011  | first= | last= | accessdate =2011-03-15[/tpl]
On March 25, 2011, Turner appeared in Hartford asking the court to be allowed to change his attorney, telling the judge, "I have no confidence in his ability to defend me."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.wfsb.com/news/27323892/detail.html | title=Blogger In Court On Threatening Charges   | publisher=WFSB  | date= March 25, 2011  | first= | last= | accessdate =2011-03-28[/tpl] The judge reluctantly allowed him to change his private attorney for a public defender citing Turner's unusually bad year. On April 7, with a public defender at his side, Turner pled not guilty and the case will go to trial.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/blogger-charged-with-encouraging-violence-against-conn-lawmakers-is-taking-his-case-to-trial/2011/04/07/AFR5XNxC_story.html | title=Blogger charged with encouraging violence against Conn. lawmakers is taking his case to trial | publisher=Washington Post  | date= April 7, 2011  | first= | last= | accessdate =2011-04-10[/tpl]
In July 2011, Turner's public defender asked for the case to be dismissed saying Turner's statements are free speech and that Connecticut courts don't have jurisdiction because his threats were made in New Jersey.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2011/07/north_bergen_hate_blogger_hal_1.html | title=North Bergen hate blogger Hal Turner set to argue case in Connecticut should be dismissed on free speech grounds | publisher=The Jersey Journal  | date= July 24, 2011  | first= | last= | accessdate =2011-07-24[/tpl] Prosecutor Thomas Garcia responded that Turner himself wrote that his intent behind the writing was to "foment direct action" against the lawmakers "personally."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.courant.com/news/local/statewire/hc-ap-ct-blogger-threatsjul26,0,4986941.story | title=Blogger wants Conn.

In September 2011, Turner asked Judge Carl J. Schuman for permission to represent himself after disagreeing with his public defender, John Stawicki, about defense strategy.[tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.courant.com/2011-09-08/news/hc-hartford-harold-turner-trial-0909-20110908_1_harold-hal-turner-beastly-government-officials-jury-selection | title=Blogger Who Allegedly Incited People To Injure Officials Will Act As Own Lawyer | publisher=Hartford Courant  | date= September 8, 2011  | first= | last= | accessdate =2011-07-24[/tpl] Judge Schuman agreed, but Stawicki remained as stand-by counsel.
