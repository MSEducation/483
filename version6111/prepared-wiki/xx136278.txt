[[Types of chocolate]]

CATEGORIES: Chocolate, Chocolate desserts

Chocolate is a range of products derived from cocoa (cacao), mixed with fat (i.e., cocoa butter) and finely powdered sugar to produce a solid confectionery. There are several types of chocolate according to the proportion of cocoa used in a particular formulation.
The use of particular name designations is sometimes subject to governmental regulation. 

==Terminology==

The cocoa bean (or other alternative) products from which chocolate is made are known under different names in different parts of the world. In the American chocolate industry:

==Classification==

Different forms and flavors of chocolate are produced by varying the quantities of the different ingredients. Other flavors can be obtained by varying the time and temperature when roasting the beans.
Flavors such as mint, vanilla, coffee, orange, or strawberry are sometimes added to chocolate in a creamy form or in very small pieces. Chocolate bars frequently contain added ingredients such as peanuts, nuts, fruit, caramel, and crisped rice. Pieces of chocolate, in various flavours, are sometimes added to cereals and ice cream.

===United States===

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the naming and ingredients of cocoa products:[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=163 | title=Title 21 — Food and Drugs, Chapter I, Sub chapter B — Food for Human Consumption, Part 163 — Cocoa Products | accessdate=1 May 2007|work=Title 21 — Food and Drugs |publisher=Food and Drug Administration Department of Health and Human Services[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hersheys.com/nutrition/chocolate.asp | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090126124820/http://hersheys.com/nutrition/chocolate.asp | archivedate=2009-01-26 | title=Types of Chocolate Products (from Hershey.com)| accessdate=1 May 2007[/tpl]
In March 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association, whose members include Hershey's, Nestlé, and Archer Daniels Midland, began lobbying the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the legal definition of chocolate to allow the substitution of "safe and suitable vegetable fats and oils" (including partially hydrogenated vegetable oils) for cocoa butter in addition to using "any sweetening agent" (including artificial sweeteners) and milk substitutes.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chocolateusa.org/pdfs/CMA-stakeholder.pdf | title=To Our Stake older | accessdate=27 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071202030257/http://www.chocolateusa.org/pdfs/CMA-stakeholder.pdf  |archivedate = 2 December 2007[/tpl] Currently, the FDA does not allow a product to be referred to as "chocolate" if the product contains any of these ingredients.(2007P-0085, Copy of 2007P-0085 Appendix C – search for cacao) To work around this restriction, products with cocoa substitutes are often branded or labeled as "chocolatey" or as in the case of Hershey's Mr. Goodbar containing vegetable oils, "made with chocolate".

===Canada===

The legislation for cocoa and chocolate products in Canada is found in Division 4 of the Food and Drug Regulations (FDR), under the Food and Drugs Act (FDA). The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the FDR and FDA (as it relates to food).[tpl]cite web|title=Responsibilities of the Agency: 11.

The use of cocoa butter substitutes in Canada is not permitted. Chocolate sold in Canada cannot contain vegetable fats or oils.[tpl]cite web|title=Division 4: Cocoa and Chocolate Products|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.%2C_c._870/page-64.html#h-65|work=Food and Drug Regulations|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|accessdate=February 16, 2012[/tpl]
The only sweetening agents permitted in chocolate in Canada are listed in Division 18 of the Food and Drug Regulations.[tpl]cite web|title=Division 18: Sweetening Agents|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.%2C_c._870/page-158.html#h-113|work=Food and Drug Regulations|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|accessdate=February 16, 2012[/tpl] Artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, acesulfame potassium, and sugar alcohols (sorbitol, maltitol, etc.) are not permitted.
Products manufactured or imported into Canada that contain non-permitted ingredients (vegetable fats or oils, artificial sweeteners) cannot legally be called “chocolate” when sold in Canada. A non-standardized name such as “candy” must be used.

===European Union===

Products labelled as "Family Milk Chocolate" elsewhere in the European Union are permitted to be labelled as simply "Milk Chocolate" in the U.K. and Ireland.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/chocguidancejun2009.pdf | title=Guidance on the Cocoa and Chocolate Products Regulations 2003 | accessdate=13 November 2010[/tpl]

===Japan===

In Japan, 'chocolate products' are classified on a complex scale (q.v. :ja:チョコレート#チョコレートの規格).

Products using milk chocolate or quasi milk chocolate as described above are handled in the same way as chocolate / quasi chocolate.

==Definition==

Chocolate is a product based on cocoa solid and/or cocoa fat. The amount and types of cocoa solids and fat that the term implies is a matter of controversy. Manufacturers have an incentive to use the term for variations that are cheaper to produce, containing less cocoa and cocoa substitutes, although these variations might not taste as good.
There has been disagreement in the EU about the definition of chocolate; this dispute covers several ingredients, including the types of fat used, quantity of cocoa, and so on. But, in 1999, the EU at least resolved the fat issue by allowing up to 5% of chocolate's content to be one of 5 alternatives to cocoa butter: illipe oil, palm oil, sal, shea butter, kokum gurgi, or mango kernel oil.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EUY/is_26_5/ai_55116511 |title=EU Agrees on Chocolate Definition Upsetting Major Cocoa Producers | Food & Drink Weekly | Find Articles at BNET.com |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=1999-07-05 |accessdate=2011-12-05[/tpl]
A recent workaround by the US confection industry has been to reduce the amount of cocoa butter in candy bars without using vegetable fats by adding polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR), which is an artificial castor oil-derived emulsifier that simulates the mouthfeel of fat. Up to 0.3% PGPR may be added to chocolate for this purpose.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science-Nutrition/Let-the-chocolate-flow |title=Let the chocolate flow |publisher=Foodnavigator.com |date=2001-04-11 |accessdate=2011-12-05[/tpl]
