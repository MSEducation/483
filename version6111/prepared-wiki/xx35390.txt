1,000 Hours is the debut EP by the American punk rock band Green Day. It was released in April 1989 through Lookout! Records, the label that nurtured the band's development in their early years before their signing with a major label in 1993.

==Recording and release==

1,000 Hours was recorded in 1988 while the band was still named "Sweet Children", and released in April 1989 on vinyl only, with several different colors of vinyl available blue, green, purple, yellow, and clear in limited quantities. Upon its release, it was also available with a pink cover vinyl only. Shortly after it was recorded, the band changed their name to Green Day, despite the objections of Lookout Records' owner Lawrence "Larry" Livermore.
In 1991, all of the songs from 1,000 Hours were reissued on 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. 1,000 Hours remained in print on the Lookout! label until August, 2005 when Green Day removed their catalog from Lookout! Records.
Since March 24, 2009, 1,000 Hours (along with Slappy) has been back in print as a bonus to the vinyl reissue of the 39/Smooth album.
