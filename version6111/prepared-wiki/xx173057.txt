Middle of Nowhere Acoustic is a live acoustic album and DVD by Hanson. It was recorded on May 5, 2007 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of their third album Middle of Nowhere. The CD/DVD combo was released on December 12, 2007 via Hanson's official website.

==Recording Event==

The album and DVD were recorded in two sessions on May 5, 2007.  Approximately 20 fans were chosen to sit in on both recording sessions, for continuity purposes in the video.  Not all aspects of the recording sessions made it to the CD/DVD - for example, the band performed the song "Something Going Round" off their 2007 album The Walk, but that particular number was never released as a part of the Middle of Nowhere Acoustic collection.
After each recording session, the band took group photos with fans, and then merchandise tables were opened where fans could buy limited-edition anniversary T-shirts as well as regular Hanson merchcandise, to include shirts, posters, keychains, and more. The shirts were black, with an orange and yellow design reminiscent of the design and color scheme from the Middle of Nowhere album.
