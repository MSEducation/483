Claude Comair  is the founder of DigiPen Institute of Technology and a co-founder of the Nintendo Software Technology Corporation in Redmond, Washington, a subsidiary of Nintendo Co. Ltd. of Kyoto.
Comair was born and raised in the hamlet of Tannourine, located in the Batroun District of Lebanon. He has received two degrees, one in Architecture and one in Environmental Engineering, and was invited to be a faculty member at the Osaka University in 1983. He has worked on games for Nintendo, Digital Eclipse Software, Inc., Intelligent Systems Co., Ltd. and Namco.
Comair originally went to school in Paris to become a doctor, but he returned to Lebanon out of worry for his family members and the condition of the country at the time. 
Comair studied digital architecture at Universit√© Saint-Esprit de Kaslik. He was offered an opportunity to do research with computers for the Japanese government. He met his wife Michele in Japan and they moved to her native country, Canada (although Michele is of Chinese descent), in 1988, where they first set up DigiPen. 
In 1996, Comair moved to Redmond, Washington, bringing the school with him. In Redmond, Comair served as one of the founders of Nintendo Software Technology, which has kept a strong relationship with DigiPen, hiring graduates as well as providing instructors.
