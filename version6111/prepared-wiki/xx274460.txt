==Biography==

On June 3, 1908, Blasi won Italy's first national marathon championship in Rome in a time of 3:01:04.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arrs.net/NC_MaraITA.htm |title=National Marathon Champions for Italy |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |date=September 2, 2011 |month= |year= |work= |publisher=Association of Road Racing Statisticians |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doibroken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |embargo= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Martin |first1=David E. |authorlink1= |last2=Gynn |first2=Roger W.H. |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=The Olympic Marathon |trans_title= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Qb125O62NVQC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&q&f=false |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Human Kinetics Publishers |location= |language= |isbn=9780880119696 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=66, 70 |at= |trans_chapter= |chapter=1908-London: Pietra Steals the Show as Hayes Captures the Gold |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=Qb125O62NVQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA63#v=onepage&q&f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=[/tpl] Given that the race also served as the nation's Olympic trial for that year's Games, he earned a spot on the Italian Olympic team with Augusto Cocca and Dorando Pietri. The following month in London, Blasi was one of 56 who lined-up to start the marathon on a warm and muggy afternoon.[tpl]cite book |last1=Cook |first1=Theodore Andrea |authorlink1=Theodore Andrea Cook |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=The Fourth Olympiad London 1908 Official Report |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1908/1908.pdf |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format=pdf |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |type= |edition= |series= |volume= | date=May 1909 |origyear= |publisher=British Olympic Association |location=London |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=74â€“75 |at= |trans_chapter= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=[/tpl] He dropped out after 8 miles and did not finish. Blasi later won his second consecutive national championship with a 2:38:30 on a 40 kilometer course in Milan on September 19, 1909. One week later on an official distance course in Voltri, Italy, his 2:48:44 mark lowered the Italian marathon record set three months earlier by Arturo deMaria.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arrs.net/RecProg/RP_ITAR.htm|title=ITA Record Progressions- Road |first= |last= |authorlink= |author=Malcolm Heyworth, Andy Milroy |date=December 15, 2010 |month= |year= |work= |publisher=Association of Road Racing Statisticians |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doibroken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |embargo= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=[/tpl]
On April 2, 1910, Blasi was one of ten professional competitors in a marathon with 16,000 spectators at the Polo Grounds in New York City.[tpl]cite news |title=Marathon Derby Is Won By Swede: Gustave Ljungstrom Distances Competitors, Lowering Record |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042462/1910-04-03/ed-1/seq-34.pdf |format=pdf |agency=AP |newspaper=Los Angeles Herald |publisher= |location=Los Angeles |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=April 3, 1910 |page=3 (Part III) |pages= |at= |accessdate=September 26, 2011 |language= |trans_title= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |ref=[/tpl] Dropping out after 18 miles, he was reportedly "carried to his dressing room".[tpl]cite news |title=Swede First In Marathon Race: Ljungstrom Beats Classic Field Of Entries At New York |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VSlCAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gKoMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5902%2C7101105 |format= |agency= |newspaper=The Telegraph-Herald |publisher= |location=Dubuque, Iowa |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=April 3, 1910 |page=1 |pages= |at= |accessdate=September 26, 2011 |language= |trans_title= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |ref=[/tpl] Supporters of Blasi and another Italian runner, Fortunio Zantis, forced an early end to another marathon in Rocky Point, Rhode Island on July 10, 1910 by crowding the track and attempting to trip the leader, Patrick Dineen of Boston.[tpl]cite news |title=Marathon Races Ended In A Row |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vmY1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=DhQLAAAAIBAJ&pg=4099%2C4333869 |format= |agency= |newspaper=The Meridian Morning Record |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=July 11, 1910 |page=9 |pages= |at= |accessdate=September 26, 2011 |language= |trans_title= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |ref=[/tpl] Dinnen, who completed 21 laps, was declared the winner while Blasi finished in fifth. Three weeks later at the Rocky Point baseball grounds, 3,500 spectators witnessed Blasi compete with five other runners in a 20-mile race that was subsequently believed to have been "considerably less than 18 miles".[tpl]cite news |title=Ted Crooks Won Near-Marathon: Rocky Point Race Proved Uninteresting - Two Runners Missing |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=u-8gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oHMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4053%2C3020602 |format= |agency= |newspaper=The Day |publisher= |location=New London, Connecticut |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=August 1, 1910 |page=10 |pages= |at= |accessdate=September 26, 2011 |language= |trans_title= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |ref=[/tpl] He was reported to have led Zantis at the half-mile post by 45 yards and crossed the mile mark first in 4:36 before fading to a fourth place finish.
