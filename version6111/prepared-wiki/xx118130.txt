CATEGORIES: State highways in Iowa

Iowa Highway 8 is a state highway that runs from east to west in east central Iowa.  Highway 8 is a short state highway in Iowa, at only [tpl]convert|14|mi[/tpl] long.  Iowa 8 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 63 in Traer and ends at an intersection with U.S. Route 218 northwest of Garrison.  The route has largely remained the same since its designation.

==Route description==

Iowa 8 begins in downtown Traer at an intersection with US 63.  As it exits the small community, it turns to the southeast and then again to the east, forming a long S curve.  Through Tama County, the highway travels over a plain with farmland on either side of the road.[tpl]Google maps|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Dysart,+IA&hl=en&ll=42.181469,-92.356911&spn=0.168673,0.373535&sll=41.56667,-93.606516&sspn=0.340606,0.43396&t=h&hnear=Dysart,+Tama,+Iowa&z=12&layer=c&cbll=42.181466,-92.410548&panoid=jYodizohKcTy-Mxvb9oKUA&cbp=12,87.04,,0,9.18|title=StreetView of Iowa Highway 8 east of Traer|accessdate=February 6, 2014[/tpl]  [tpl]convert|2|mi|spell=In[/tpl] west of Dysart, the road is intersected by Iowa 21, which joins Iowa 8 from the north.  For the next [tpl]convert|2.5|mi[/tpl], the two highways run together until they reach the eastern limits of Dysart, which is also the Tama–Benton county line.  Now in Benton County, the Iowa 8 continues due east.  The final [tpl]convert|3|mi|spell=in[/tpl] of the route are much hillier than the preceding [tpl]convert|10|mi|spell=in[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|last=Iowa Geographic Map Server|title=24K Topographic Maps|url=http://ortho.gis.iastate.edu/client.cgi?zoom=30&x0=555303&y0=4670061&layer=drg24&action=pan&pwidth=900&pheight=300|publisher=Iowa State University|accessdate=February 6, 2014[/tpl]   The highway ends at the midpoint of a 90-degree turn along US 218 northwest of Garrison.

==History==

Prior to becoming a primary highway, Iowa 8's route was a part of the Diagonal Trail, which connected Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and Danville, Illinois.  Through Iowa, it passed through Davenport, Cedar Rapids, Iowa Falls, Spencer, and Spirit Lake.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iowadot.gov/autotrails/diagonaltrail.html|title=Diagonal Trail|last=Iowa Department of Transportation|accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl]  The Diagonal Trail was registered with the Iowa State Highway Commission on December 4, 1918.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iowadot.gov/autotrails/markhansen/Scan-0001_600dpi.pdf|title=Iowa Registered Highway Routes 1914–1925|last=Iowa Department of Transportation|year=1986|accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl]  When the primary highway system was created, a portion of the Diagonal Trail was assigned Primary Road No. 58.[tpl]cite map|publisher=Rand McNally & Company|title=Junior Road Map: Eastern Iowa |url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/NorthCentral/Iowa/unitedstates1926ra_045.html|year=1926|accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl]  When the eastern portion of Iowa 58 was rerouted, Iowa 8 was formed.[tpl]when?|date=February 2014[/tpl]  Since its designation, the route mostly has remained unchanged.  Two sharp curves east of Traer were eliminated for a straighter route with one more-gradual curve.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ortho.gis.iastate.edu/client.cgi?zoom=10&x0=546143&y0=4670660&gwidth=6000&gheight=6000&pwidth=600&pheight=600&layer=ortho_1930&wmtver=1.0|title=1930s Aerial Photos|last=Iowa Geographic Map Server|publisher=Iowa State University, USDA|accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl]
