Montclair State University Station at Little Falls is a New Jersey Transit rail station in the Great Notch area of Little Falls, New Jersey on the Montclair-Boonton Line.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.njtransit.com/rg/rg_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=TrainSchedulesFrom&selStation=38081|title=Station Information: Montclair State University|publisher=New Jersey Transit|accessdate=2009-07-07[/tpl] The station, which opened on October 20, 2004, is located on Clove Road near Route 46 and the Montclair State University campus, and was built at a cost of [tpl]US$|26 million[/tpl], following the completion of the Montclair Connection. Although the station itself was not officially open, a temporary platform was built to allow the under-construction station to serve one of its main purposes as the Montclair-Boonton Line's primary transfer station.
On weekdays, every train on the Montclair-Boonton Line stops here.  Midtown Direct service to Penn Station terminates here, as the line west of the nearby yard is not electrified. The station is a major transfer point for riders because many trains terminate here, it is the first station on the line with service to New York Penn Station, and it is the first local stop of express trains. The station is a sheltered, two-tracked island platform with an elevated walkway over the tracks connecting it to the parking deck and the college campus. The station is equipped with ticket machines and monitors displaying arrivals and departures. It is accessible as the platform is fully elevated and elevators are available in addition to stairs. The station was intended to be a Park-and-Ride, near a highway and with a large parking deck.
There is no connecting bus service directly to the station, as the university's bus stop is on the opposite side of campus near the Montclair Heights station. Campus shuttles, however, do serve the station.

==Service==

Although the Montclair-Boonton Line recently added weekend service, Montclair State University is not served on weekends as Bay Street is the weekend terminus for trains to and from Hoboken.[tpl]cite web|url=http://themontclarion.org/archives/1046|title=Montclair-Booton Line Extends its Trail: MSU Not on the Stop List|publisher=The Montclarion (MSU newspaper)|date=2009-01-26|accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]
