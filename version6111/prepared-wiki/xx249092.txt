The building in the background is Southeastern's Saint Tammany Hall, namesake of Saint Tammany Parish.
It crosses US 51 and, after traversing south of Southeastern's University Center and crossing North General Pershing Street, leads to the University's main entrance; from there, continuing east, LA 3234 crosses North Oak Street and the Canadian National Railway before ending in a T-intersection on LA 1065 (North Cherry Street). 
LA 3234 is four lanes wide with a center turning lane except on the small segment west of I-55 where it is only two lanes wide.
In passing through Southeastern, LA 3234 separates the north and south campuses, which are joined by a pedestrian underpass beneath LA 3234.  It is Louisiana's sole example of a pedestrian underpass beneath a state highway on a university campus.
LA 3234 has helped provide for enrollment growth at Southeastern and has contributed to the popularity of the University Center as a venue for events.
