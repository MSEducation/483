The Triumph Motor Company was a British car and motor manufacturing company.  The Triumph marque (trade-name) is owned currently by BMW. The marque had its origins in 1885 when Siegfried Bettmann (1863–1951) of Nuremberg formed S. Bettmann & Co and started importing bicycles from Europe and selling them under his own trade name in London. The trade name became "Triumph" the following year, and in 1887 Bettmann was joined by a partner, Moritz (Maurice) Schulte, also from Germany. In 1889 the businessmen started producing their own bicycles in Coventry, England.

==History==

===Triumph Cycle Company===

The company was renamed the Triumph Cycle Co. Ltd. in 1897.[tpl]cite book |last=Robson |first=Graham |title=The Story of Triumph Sports Cars |year=1972 |publisher=MRP |location=Croydon |isbn=0-900549-23-8[/tpl] In 1902 it began producing Triumph motor cycles at their works in Coventry on Much Park Street. At first these used engines purchased from another company, but the business prospered and they soon started making their own engines. In 1907 they purchased the premises of a spinning mill on Priory Street to develop a new factory. Major orders for the 550 cc Model H were made by the British Army during World War 1 and by 1918 they were Britain's largest maker of motorcycles.
In 1921, Bettmann was persuaded by his general manager Claude Holbrook (1886–1979), who had joined the company in 1919, to acquire the assets and Clay Lane premises of the Dawson Car Company and start producing a car and 1.4 litre engine type named the Triumph 10/20 designed for them by Lea-Francis, to whom they paid a royalty for every car sold.[tpl]cite book |last=Georgano |first=N.   | authorlink=G.N. Georgano |coauthors= |title=Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile |year=2000 |publisher=HMSO |location=London |isbn=1-57958-293-1[/tpl]  Production of this car and its immediate successors was moderate, but this changed with the introduction in 1927 of the Triumph Super 7, which sold in large numbers until 1934.

===Triumph Motor Company===

In 1930 the company's name was changed to Triumph Motor Company. Holbrook realized he could not compete with the larger car companies for the mass market, so he decided to produce expensive cars, and introduced the models  Southern Cross and Gloria.  At first these used engines made by Triumph but designed by Coventry Climax, but from 1937 Triumph started to produce engines to their own designs by Donald Healey who had become the company’s Experimental Manager in 1934.
The company encountered financial problems however and in 1936 the Triumph bicycle and motorcycle businesses were sold, the latter to Jack Sangster of Ariel to become Triumph Engineering Co Ltd. Healey purchased an Alfa Romeo 8C 2300 and developed a new car model with an Alfa inspired straight-8 engine type named the Triumph Dolomite'.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.rickcarey.com/Catalog%20Descriptions/RM_Amelia_02_%20Monza_2211125.htm|title=Alfa Romeo 8C 2300|accessdate=2007-08-16|work=rickcarey.com[/tpl] Three of these cars were made in 1934, one of which was used in competition and destroyed in an accident. The Dolomites manufactured from 1937 to 1940 were unrelated to these prototypes.
In July 1939, the Triumph Motor Company went into receivership and the factory, equipment and goodwill were offered for sale. Thomas W. Ward Ltd. purchased the company and placed Healey in charge as general manager, but the effects of World War II again stopped the production of cars and the Holbrook Lane works were completely destroyed by bombing in 1940.[tpl]cite journal |last=Langworth |first=Richard M. |date=Second Quarter 1973 |title=Trundling Along With Triumph – The story thus far... |journal=Automobile Quarterly |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=128–129 |publisher=Automobile Quarterly Inc. |lccn=62-4005|ref=Trundling[/tpl]
