==Biography==

The band was formed in late 2012[tpl]cite news|url=http://blogs.citypaper.com/noise/index.php/2013/06/album-review-the-ghetto-tryna-kill-me-by-the-white-mandingos/|publisher=Baltimore City Paper|last=Woods|first=Baynard|title=Album Review: The Ghetto is Tryna Kill Me, by the White Mandingos|date=14 June 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] when Jenkins met up at Jenifer's house in Woodstock to discover if there was anything in common between their respective favourite music genres. They considered their initial collaborations unimpressive, so Jenkins suggested collaborating with Murs, who provided lyrics.[tpl]cite journal|title=Punk and hip-hop veterans team up|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-white-mandingos-embrace-hardcore-in-the-ghetto-is-tryna-kill-me-song-premiere-20130304|last=Goldwatch|first=Jason|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=4 March 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] They have described their influences as hip-hop, West Coast rap, The Isley Brothers, Led Zeppelin and reggae.
While the band's music has been described as "rap-rock", Jenkins rejects that term, stating "I don't like 'rap rock' at all. Like I hate it. I think it's — it's terrible!" and has explained that "what we've come together to do is just an extension of all of our experiences as black men, but we're not just limited to being black".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.opb.org/artsandlife/article/npr-the-white-mandingos-music-that-defies-definition/|title=The White Mandingos: Music That Defies Definition|publisher=OPB|date=13 August 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] Murs has complained that black music hasn't envolved since the 1980s, and that the music industry places no expectations on black rock groups being successful.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/06/the-white-mandingos-interview|title=Interview: The White Mandingos Are Not Unicorns|publisher=Complex|last=Margolis|first=Daniel|date=14 June 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] Unlike many new bands, Jenkins places little importance on social media, through he did praise Wikipedia, saying "Wikipedia is nice. It’s a lot of nice people coming together sharing information – no one’s making money. Shout out to Wikipedia."
Their first album, The Ghetto Is Tryna Kill Me was released in June 2013, and followed with a short tour of the eastern United States, including gigs in New York's New Museum, Boston and Washington DC. The album is a concept album around Tyrone White, a young black man from a New York City housing project,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtvhive.com/2013/06/13/white-mandingos-ghetto-is-tryna-kill-me/|title=Get to Know the White Mandingos|publisher=MTV Hive|last=Moore|first=Marcus|date=13 June 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/music/2013/06/11/listen-the-white-mandingos-the-ghetto-is-tryna-kill-me/ |title=Listen: The White Mandingos, The Ghetto Is Tryna Kill Me |first=Marcus J. |last=Moore |date= 11 June 2013 |newspaper=Washington City Paper[/tpl] who subsequently obtains a recording contract and gets a white girlfriend. Jenifer and Jenkins have described the album Tommy by The Who as an important influence.  Reviewing the album, Baltimore City Paper 's Baynard Woods thought the group "actually manage to do service to punk and hip hop" and praised the band's sense of humour, particularly the music video for their first single, "My First White Girl". Washington City Paper's Marcus J Moore described the video for the group's "Warn A Brotha" as "a cool ode to skateboarding".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/music/2013/07/19/dmv-beats-shy-glizzy-uptown-xo-the-white-mandingos-yung-gleesh-alli-the-abstract/|last=Moore|first=Marcus|title=Warn A Brotha|publisher=Washington City Paper|date=19 July 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl]
