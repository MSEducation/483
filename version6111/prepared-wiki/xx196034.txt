Viaggiatrice solitaria - Il meglio di Alice is a compilation album of recordings by Italian singer-songwriter Alice, released by EMI Music in 1995.
Unlike EMI Italiana's 1994 best of package Il vento caldo dell'estate, which mainly included tracks from the artist's early career plus a disco remix of the 1982 duet "Chan-son Egocentrique" with Franco Battiato which surprisingly omitted all vocals by the composer himself, this compilation was produced with both the participation and approval of Alice. Viaggiatrice solitaria focuses on material from the albums Mezzogiorno sulle Alpi (1992), Il sole nella pioggia (1989) and Park Hotel (1986) - and it includes the original unremixed duet version of "Chan-son Egocentrique".
Viaggiatrice Solitaria (meaning "Solitary Traveller") became the final collaboration between the artist and the EMI Music label. Her first studio album for WEA/Warner Music, Charade, was released later that same year.
