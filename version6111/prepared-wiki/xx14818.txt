Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells.[tpl]cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of Biology|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-920462-5|edition=6th|editor=Robert.S Hine|page=113[/tpl] Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle. In eukaryotes, there are two distinct type of cell division: a vegetative division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell (mitosis),[tpl]cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Anthony J.F.|title=Introduction to Genetic Analysis|year=2012|publisher=W.H.

Meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions: homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division, and sister chromatids are separated in the second division.[tpl]Cite book  | author = Griffiths JF, Gelbart WM, Lewontin RC, Wessler SR, Suzuki DT, Miller JH | title = Introduction to Genetic Analysis | year = 2005 | publisher = W.H.

All cell divisions, regardless of  organism, are preceded by a single round of DNA replication.
For simple unicellular organismsSingle cell organisms. See discussion within lead of the article on microorganism. such as the amoeba, one cell division is equivalent to reproduction – an entire new organism is created. On a larger scale, mitotic cell division can create progeny from multicellular organisms, such as plants that grow from cuttings. Cell division also enables sexually reproducing organisms to develop from the one-celled zygote, which itself was produced by cell division from gametes. And after growth, cell division allows for continual construction and repair of the organism.[tpl]cite book | last = Maton | first = Anthea | authorlink = | coauthors = Hopkins, Jean Johnson, Susan LaHart, David, Quon Warner, David, Wright, Jill D | title = Cells: Building Blocks of Life | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 1997 | location = New Jersey | pages = 70–74 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-423476-6 [/tpl] A human being's body experiences about 10,000 trillion cell divisions in a lifetime.[ref]

Cell division has been modeled by finite subdivision rules.J. W. Cannon, W. Floyd and W. Parry. Crystal growth, biological cell growth and geometry. Pattern Formation in Biology, Vision and Dynamics, pp. 65–82. World Scientific, 2000. ISBN 981-02-3792-8,ISBN 978-981-02-3792-9.
The primary concern of cell division is the maintenance of the original cell's genome. Before division can occur, the genomic information that is stored in chromosomes must be replicated, and the duplicated genome must be separated cleanly between cells. A great deal of cellular infrastructure is involved in keeping genomic information consistent between "generations".

==Variants==

Cells are classified into two main categories: simple, non-nucleated prokaryotic cells, and complex, nucleated eukaryotic cells. By dint of their structural differences, eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells do not divide in the same way. Also, the pattern of cell division that transforms eukaryotic stem cells into gametes (sperm cells in males or ova – egg cells – in females) is different from that of the somatic cell division in the cells of the body.

==Degradation==

Multicellular organisms replace worn-out cells through cell division. In some animals, however, cell division eventually halts. In humans this occurs on average, after 52 divisions, known as the Hayflick limit. The cell is then referred to as senescent. Cells stop dividing because the telomeres, protective bits of DNA on the end of a chromosome required for replication, shorten with each copy, eventually being consumed, as described in the article on telomere shortening. Cancer cells, on the other hand, are not thought to degrade in this way, if at all. An enzyme called telomerase, present in large quantities in cancerous cells, rebuilds the telomeres, allowing division to continue indefinitely.
