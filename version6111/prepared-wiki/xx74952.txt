M3 is a Canadian English language Category A specialty channel that is owned by Bell Media. Established in 1998 as MuchMoreMusic, the network began as a spin-off of the youth-oriented MuchMusic, targeting an older demographic with adult contemporary, classic hits, and classic rock music videos, along with music news programs and concert specials. Its lineup later expanded to incorporate pop culture programming (often sourced from the similar U.S. network VH1), reality shows, dramas and sitcoms.
The network is headquartered alongside its sister networks at 299 Queen Street West in Toronto, Ontario.

==History==

In June 1993, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) began accepting applications to licence new Canadian specialty channels[tpl]Citation | last=Enchin | first=Harvey | author-link= | date=September 13, 1993 | title=TV audiences in back seat: Channel applicant says priority is securing cable affiliation | periodical=The Globe and Mail | volume= | issue= | pages=B3 | id=ISSN 0319-0714 | url= [/tpl] for the first time since 1987.[tpl]Citation | last=Feschuk | first=Scott | author-link=Scott Feschuk | date=September 16, 1993 | title=Bidding hot for TV licences: 5 or 6 channels up for grabs | periodical=The Globe and Mail | volume= | issue= | pages=B1 | id=ISSN 0319-0714 | url= [/tpl] On August 31, 1993, MuchMusic and CITY-TV co-founder Moses Znaimer announced on-air the proposal by CHUM Limited to launch a specialty channel called MuchMoreMusic as an adult music/lifestyle channel, quoted as offering music more "familiar, tuneful, and melodic" for an audience who "could do with a little less rock and rap and metal".[tpl]Citation | last=Knight Ridder News Service | first= | author-link=Knight Ridder | date=September 1, 1993 | title=Burt throws a tantrum on fictional talk show | periodical=Toronto Star | volume= | issue= | pages=B6 | id=ISSN 0319-0781 | url= [/tpl] This followed CHUM's earlier application for MuchCountry, a country music channel. "Melodic pop, soft rock, jazz, soul and blues" were to be some of the genres played by MuchMoreMusic; according to MuchMusic, the new channel would be able to provide such music to the "sizable" portion of its existing audience who enjoyed such softer music but could not find it reliably on MuchMusic.[tpl]Citation | last=Bronskill | first=Jim | author-link= | date=February 24, 1994 | title=Two new music TV stations wouldn't give us stranglehold, MuchMusic creators say | periodical=The Gazette | volume= | issue= | pages=D6 | id=ISSN 0384-1294 | url= [/tpl]
At a subsequent February 1994 public hearing, the CRTC reviewed a total of seven applications for music channels, comprising five country music channels, MuchMoreMusic, and CHUM's MusiquExtra, which was to be a French-language adult contemporary counterpart.[tpl]Citation | last=Atherton | first=Tony | author-link= | date=February 8, 1994 | title=Country music channel tops list of CRTC TV applications Series | periodical=Ottawa Citizen | volume= | issue= | pages=F1 | id=ISSN 0839-3222 | url= [/tpl] In a Canadian Press article, commissioner Adrian Burns noted concerns with giving one operator control of multiple music channels; Znaimer, meanwhile, claimed that there was no room for more than one operator of music channels in Canada. In June, the MuchMoreMusic application was denied by the Commission, as well as the MuchCountry and MusiquExtra proposals;http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1995/..%5C..%5CDecisions%5C1994%5CDB94-287.htm out of the seven, the only application approved was Maclean-Hunter and Rawlco Communications' The Country Network, which has since become CMT.http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1994/DB94-284.HTM Subsequently, the CRTC was criticized for passing only 10 of the 48 total applications.[tpl]Citation | last=Zerbisias | first=Antonia | author-link=Antonia Zerbisias | date=June 11, 1994 | title=Broadcast blessings | periodical=Toronto Star | volume= | issue= | pages=C1 | id=ISSN 0319-0781 | url= [/tpl]
Then, in January 1996, the next round of licensing began, drawing another 44 applications; CHUM submitted nine of these, including MuchMoreMusic and the French-language adult contemporary channel, now called MusiMax (formerly MusicMax).[tpl]Citation | last=Zerbisias | first=Antonia | author-link= | date=January 13, 1996 | title=44 applicants seeking TV channel licences | periodical=Toronto Star | volume= | issue= | pages=F3 | id=ISSN 0319-0781 | url= [/tpl] The new application, delivered by MuchMusic programmer Denise Donlon on May 8, 1996, incorporated video testimonials by a number of Canadian musicians, including Anne Murray, Bruce Cockburn, Burton Cummings, Celine Dion, David Foster, Lawrence Gowan, Dan Hill and Marc Jordan, attesting to the need for the channel; Donlon conceded, in a Canadian Press article, that a number of Canadian musicians were no longer filming music videos because MuchMusic was not able to accommodate every music genre equally.[tpl]cite news | first= | last=Canadian Press | authorlink=Canadian Press | title=MuchMusic for boomers to be a kinder, gentler affair (MuchMoreMusic) | url= | work= | publisher=Canadian Press NewsWire | pages= | date=1996-04-25 | id= | accessdate= [/tpl] On the same day, CHUM also made pitches for Canadian Learning Television and Computer Access, a later rejected computer education channel.[tpl]Citation | last=Zerbisias | first=Antonia | author-link= | date=May 9, 1996 | title=Znaimer spins more music in licence bid | periodical=Toronto Star | volume= | issue= | pages=C4 | id=ISSN 0319-0781 | url= [/tpl]
MuchMoreMusic was licensed by the CRTC in 1996 (as well as some of CHUM's other proposals rejected in 1994, including CablePulse24, Space, and Musimax) and was launched on October 5, 1998 under the ownership of CHUM Limited.

===Early Years===

In January 1999, The Globe and Mail critic John Doyle commented on the channel's invariant hosting at the time: "It appears to be staffed by one person only, Jana Lynne White. The woman does everything -- interviews, running down the appalling video chart, promos, everything except come to your house and turn on the TV for you."[tpl]Citation | last=Doyle | first=John | author-link=John Doyle (critic) | date=January 23, 1999 | title=John Doyle's Critical List | periodical=The Globe and Mail | volume= | issue= | pages=4 | id=ISSN 0319-0714 | url= [/tpl] The channel's early lineup also included the MuchMusic program ClipTrip, transferred to MuchMoreMusic, along with its host Diego Fuentes, the winner of MuchMusic's 1995 VJ search. In May 2000, Bill Welychka also transferred from MuchMusic, to host Freshly Pressed and later The Loop. In April 2000, full-time staff and programming was expanded, including daytime "information segments". Studio space, at 299 Queen Street West, was shared with MuchMusic until May 2000, when it was moved to the fourth floor.[tpl]Citation | last=LeBlanc | first=Larry | author-link= | date=May 6, 2000 | title=AC channel M3 restructures to offer Canadian labels 'much more' choice | periodical=Billboard | volume=112 | issue=19 | pages=63â€“64 | id=ISSN 0006-2510 | url= [/tpl]
In September 2004, MuchMoreMusic launched a sister digital network, MuchMoreRetro, which focuses exclusively on classic music videos.

===Sale to CTV===

On June 22, 2007, CTVglobemedia gained control of MuchMoreMusic as a result of a takeover of CHUM Limited. On March 31, 2009, MuchMoreMusic was relaunched with a new on-air format and subsequently became known as MuchMore. The changeover took effect at 6:00 a.m. ET, with the first edition of the newly branded morning video flow series Juiced!
Ownership changed hands once again, when Bell Canada gained 100% control of CTVglobemedia's assets including MuchMore it did not already own, on April 1, 2011, MuchMore was taken over by Bell Media.
On September 19, 2013, Bell announced that MuchMore would be re-launched as M3 on September 30, 2013, shifting towards an entertainment-oriented "superstation" format with a focus on newly acquired dramas and comedy programs alongside music programming. Unlike MuchMore, which was marketed as a spin-off of MuchMusic, M3 is marketed as a separate brand from MuchMusic, to quell concerns over viewers incorrectly suggesting that the network was catered towards a youth demographic like MuchMusic due to its similar name. A high definition feed was also launched.[tpl]cite web|title=MuchMore changes the channel, rebrands as M3|url=http://www.marketingmag.ca/news/marketer-news/muchmore-changes-the-channel-rebrands-as-m3-89194|work=Marketing Magazine|accessdate=19 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=MuchMore channel to become M3 in the fall|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2013/07/26/muchmore_channel_to_become_m3_in_the_fall.html|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=19 September 2013|date=July 26, 2013[/tpl]
As part of the rebrand, MuchMoreRetro was re-branded as MuchRetro, aligning the channel with the MuchMusic brand. The MuchMore Countdown became the M3 Countdown and was relaunched with a new format on January 18, 2014.[tpl]cite web|title=5 Days to Go: Counting Down to the New M3 COUNTDOWN Hosted by Matt Wells, Premiering Jan. 18|url=http://bellmediapr.ca/Network/MuchMore/Press/5-Days-to-Go-Counting-Down-to-the-New-M3-COUNTDOWN-Hosted-by-Matt-Wells-Premiering-Jan-18|work=Bell Media|date= January 13, 2014|accessdate=18 April 2014[/tpl] It, along with the renamed M3Top20.ca, are currently the only remaining original music-related shows on the network.
