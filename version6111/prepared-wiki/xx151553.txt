The Communist Bulletin Group was a small left communist organisation based in Scotland.  It was founded in 1981 by groups in Edinburgh and Aberdeen which split from World Revolution (WR).  Many of its founders had originally been members of the Communist Workers Organisation but had left to join WR in 1977.
The split from WR was bitter, and WR accused the Communist Bulletin Group of theft.  The Communist Bulletin Group denied this, and published several harsh criticisms of WR and its international organisation, the International Communist Current.  In return, WR accused the Group of "parasitism".
In the early 1990s, the Communist Bulletin Group began co-operating with the Communist Workers Organisation, and contributed to its paper, Workers' Voice.  However, this came to an end in 1993 when the Communist Bulletin Group disbanded.
