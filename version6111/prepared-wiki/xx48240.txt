Pieces of Eight is the eighth studio album and second concept album by Styx, released on September 1, 1978.
Like the band's previous album, The Grand Illusion, it managed to achieve triple-platinum certification, thanks to the hit singles "Sing for the Day", "Blue Collar Man" and "Renegade".
The band members produced and recorded the album (like their previous three efforts) at Paragon Studios in Chicago with recording engineer Barry Mraz and mixing engineer Rob Kingsland. "I'm O.K" was recorded at Paragon and St. James Cathedral. This would be the last album to be produced at Paragon Studios.
The theme of the album, as Dennis DeYoung explained on In the Studio with Redbeard which devoted an entire episode to Pieces of Eight, was about "not giving up your dreams just for the pursuit of money and material possessions".
Eight of the album's ten tracks have vocals, and it features two instrumentals, the DeYoung synthesizer showcase "The Message" and Tommy Shaw's closing "Aku-Aku" (although for the latter, there was one lyric spoken, the title of the song). "The Message" serves as a prelude for "Lords of the Ring", and "Aku-Aku" is a postlude for "Pieces of Eight".
The album's cover was done by Hipgnosis. DeYoung stated in the same 1991 interview with Redbeard on the "In the Studio" episode that he initially hated the cover but grew to like it as he got older.

==Critical reception==

Mike DeGagne of Allmusic praised the album, saying that the songs on the album "rekindle some of Styx's early progressive rock sound, only cleaner." Rolling Stone reviewer Lester Bangs was more critical of the album, however, saying that "What's really interesting is not that such narcissistic slop should get recorded, but what must be going on in the minds of the people who support it in such amazing numbers. Gall, nerve and ego have never been far from great rock & roll. Yet there's a thin but crucial line between those qualities and what it takes to fill arenas today: sheer self-aggrandizement on the most puerile level. If these are the champions, gimme the cripples."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/pieces-of-eight-19781228 |title=Styx, Pieces of Eight |last=Bangs |first=Lester |work=Rolling Stone |publisher=Wenner Media |date=December 28, 1978 |accessdate=June 23, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zdxfjBcE |archivedate=June 23, 2011 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
The album peaked at #6 on the Billboard album chart, and like its predecessor would go triple platinum.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.styxworld.com/SilverStripe/concert-review-the-grand-illusion-pieces-of-eight-tour-atlanta-ga/ |title=Concert Review: The Grand Illusion/Pieces of Eight Tour - Atlanta, GA |last=Moseley |first=Willey |date=November 13, 2010 |accessdate=December 26, 2012 |quote=Moreover, the choice of 1977's The Grand Illusion and 1978's Pieces of Eight probably didn't come as any surprise, either—those two releases were STYX's first Triple Platinum albums.[/tpl]
