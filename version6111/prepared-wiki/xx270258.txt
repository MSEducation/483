San Francisco Performances is an organization which showcases chamber music, vocal and instrumental recitals, jazz and contemporary dance in the San Francisco Bay area. It was founded by Ruth Felt in 1979. The organization presents "internationally acclaimed and emerging performing artists, introduces innovative programs, and builds new and diversified audiences for the arts through education and outreach activities that also strengthen the local performing arts community."[tpl]cite web|title=About Us|url=http://sfperformances.org/aboutus/aboutus.html|publisher=San Francisco Performances|accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=San Francisco Performances|url=http://www.sfcv.org/events-calendar/organization-profiles/san-francisco-performances|publisher=San Francisco Classical Voice|accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl]

This is accomplished by commissioning new works, offering programs featuring compositions and premieres of the 20th and 21st century, and featuring American and international contemporary dance companies. Its current season offers over 200 performances and programs.[tpl]cite web|title=About Us|url=http://sfperformances.org/aboutus/aboutus.html|publisher=San Francisco Performances|accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl]
