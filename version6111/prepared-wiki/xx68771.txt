Ramana Maharshi [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ʌ|m|ə|n|ə|_|m|ə|ˈ|h|ɑr|ʃ|i[/tpl] (30 December 1879 – 14 April 1950) is widely acknowledged as one of the outstanding Indian gurus of modern times.[tpl]sfn|Godman|994[/tpl] He was born Venkataraman Iyer, in Tiruchuzhi,[tpl]refn|group=note|Also commonly spelled as Tiruchuli[/tpl] Tamil Nadu, South India.[tpl]sfn|Editor unknown|1988[/tpl]
At the age of sixteen, Venkataraman lost his sense of individual selfhood,[tpl]sfn|Godman|1985[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|Though many people have reported brief experiences of this, in Venkataraman's case it was permanent and irreversible. From that moment on, his sense of being an individual person ceased and never functioned in him again.[tpl]sfn|Godman|1985[/tpl][/tpl] an awakening[tpl]sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=23[/tpl] which he later recognised as enlightenment,[tpl]sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=23[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|Ramana: "When I later in Tiruvannamalai listened, how the "Ribhu Gita" and such sacred texts were read, I caught these things and discovered that these books named and analysed, what I before involuntarily felt, without being able to appoint or analyse. In the language of these books I could denote the state in which I found myself after my awakening as "cleaned understanding" (shuddham manas) or "Insight" (Vijñāna): as 'the intuition of the Enlightened'".[tpl]sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=23[/tpl][/tpl] and six weeks later left his home to journey to the holy mountain Arunachala, Tiruvannamalai, where he remained for the rest of his life.[tpl]sfn|Godman|1985[/tpl]
His first years were spent in solitude, but his stillness and his appearance as a sannyasin soon attracted devotees.[tpl]sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=37-38[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Godman|1985|p=4[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006[/tpl] In later years, he responded to questions, but always insisted that silence was the purest teaching.[tpl]sfn|Godman|1985|p=4[/tpl] His verbal teachings flowed "from his direct knowledge that consciousness was the only existing reality."[tpl]sfn|Godman|1985|p=5[/tpl] In later years, a community grew up around him, where he was available twenty-four hours a day to visitors.[tpl]sfn|Godman|1985|p=5[/tpl] Though worshipped by thousands, he never allowed anyone to treat him as special, or receive private gifts. He treated all with equal respect.[tpl]sfn|Godman|1985[/tpl] Since the 1930s his teachings have also been popularised in the west.[tpl]sfn|Lucas|2011[/tpl]
Venkataraman was given the name Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi by one of his earliest devotees, Ganapati Muni.[tpl]refn|group=note|Bhagavan means God, Sri is an honorific title, Ramana is a short form of Venkataraman, and Maharshi means 'great seer' in Sanskrit.[/tpl] This would be the name by which he became known to the world.[tpl]sfn|Godman|1985[/tpl]
In response to questions on self-liberation and the classic texts on Yoga and Vedanta, Ramana recommended self-enquiry as the principal way to awaken to the "I-I", realising the Self[tpl]sfn|Godman|1985|p=29-30[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=202-213[/tpl] and attaining liberation.[tpl]sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=195[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|Ramana Maharshi: "Liberation (mukti) is the total destruction of the I-impetus (aham-kara), of the "me"- and "my"-impetus (mama-kara)".[tpl]sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=195[/tpl][/tpl] He also recommended Bhakti, and gave his approval to a variety of paths and practices.David Godman, Meditation and concentration, from Be As You Are: The Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi

==Biography==

===Early years (1879–1896)===

====Family background====

Ramana Maharshi was born Venkataraman Iyer on 30 December 1879[tpl]refn|group=note|Ramana was born at 12:19 am, which per Vedic Astrology indicates a Virgo Ascendant with Most Effective Point (MEP)Mooltrikona, MOST EFFECTIVE POINT at 18d 37' in the Hasta naksatra, and with the natal MoonAcharya Bharat, The Moon: The Psyche. Vedic Astrology perspective in the janmanaksatra Purarvasu.[tpl]sfn|Bhagavadpada|2008[/tpl][/tpl] in the village Tiruchuzhi near Aruppukkottai, Madurai in Tamil Nadu, South India. His birth came upon Arudra Darshanam day, the day of the Sight of Siva. Venkataraman was the second of four children and born into an orthodox Hindu Brahmin family. His father was Sundaram Iyer (1848–1890), from the lineage of Parashara, and his mother Azhagammal (?-1922). He had two brothers Nagaswamy (1877–1900) and Nagasundaram (1886–1953), along with a younger sister Alamelu (1891/92-1953). Venkataraman's father was a respected man in town and a court pleader by profession.[tpl]sfn|Osborne|Year unknown[/tpl]

====Childhood (1879–1895)====

Venkataraman was popular, good at sports, mischievous, and was very intelligent with an exceptional memory which enabled him to succeed in school without having to put in very much effort. He had a couple of unusual traits. When he slept, he went into such a deep state of unconsciousness that his friends could physically assault his body without waking him up. He also had an extraordinary amount of luck. In team games, whichever side he played for always won. This earned him the nickname 'Tanga-kai', which means 'golden hand'.An Introduction to Sri Ramana's Life and Teachings. David Godman talks to John David
When Venkataraman was about 11, his father sent him to live with his paternal uncle Subbaiyar in Dindigul because he wanted his sons to be educated in English so they would be eligible to enter government service, and only Tamil was taught at the village school in Tiruchuzhi. In 1891, when his uncle was transferred to Madurai, Venkataraman and his elder brother Nagaswami moved with him. In Dindigul, Venkataraman attended a British School.
In 1892, Venkataraman's father Sundaram Iyer suddenly fell seriously ill and unexpectedly died several days later at the age of 42.[tpl]sfn|Krishna Bikshu|Year unknown[/tpl] For some hours after his father's death he contemplated the matter of death, and how his father's body was still there, but the 'I' was gone from it.

===Awakening (1895–1896)===

After leaving Scott's Middle School, Venkataraman went to the American Mission High School. One November morning in 1895, he was on his way to school when he saw an elderly relative and inquired where the relative had come from. The answer was "From Arunachala."[tpl]sfn|Krishna Bikshu|Year unknown[/tpl] Krishna Bikshu describes Venkataraman's response: 
A month later he came across a copy of Sekkizhar's Periyapuranam, a book that describes the lives of 63 Saivite saints, and was deeply moved and inspired by it.[tpl]sfn|Natarajan|2006[/tpl] During this period he began to visit, the nearby Meenakshi Temple in Madurai.Arthur Osborne, Ramana Maharshi and the Path of Self-Knowledge. Chapter 1: Early Years
Soon after, on 17 July 1896,[tpl]sfn|Natarajan|2006[/tpl] at age 16, Venkataraman had a life-changing experience. He spontaneously initiated a process of self-enquiry that culminated, within a few minutes, in his own permanent awakening. In one of his rare written comments on this process he wrote: 'Enquiring within Who is the seer? I saw the seer disappear leaving That alone which stands forever. No thought arose to say I saw. How then could the thought arise to say I did not see. In 1930, over a period of six weeks, Narasimha Swami had a series of conversations with Ramana on this experience. He summarised these conversations in his own words:David godman (7 may 2008), Bhagavan's death experience, quoting from "the editor's introduction", The Mountain Path, 1981, pp. 67–69[tpl]refn|group=note|Narasimha Swami came to the Ashram in 1925; his biography of Ramana was published in 1931. Narasimha did not record the exact words of Ramana:[tpl]sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=18[/tpl] "The account in the book was not a direct transcription of Bhagavan’s words, and the author makes this clear in a footnote which has appeared in most of the editions of the book. He said that he was merely summarising, in his own words, a series of conversations which he had with Bhagavan over a period of six weeks in 1930." Narasimha's footnote: "The exact words the death experience have not been recorded. The Swami as a rule talks quite impersonally. There is seldom any clear or pronounced reference to 'I' and 'you' in what he says. The genius of Tamil is specially suited for such impersonal utterances, and he generally talks Tamil. However, one studying his words and ways discovers personal references, mostly veiled. His actual words may be found too colourless and hazy to suit or appeal to many readers, especially of the western type. Hence the use here of the customary phraseology with its distinct personal reference."[tpl]sfn|Narasimha|2003|p=20, footnote[/tpl]David Godman (23 june 2008), More on Bhagavan's death experience For Narasimha Swami, Self Realization, see http://archive.org/details/SelfRealisation[/tpl]
According to David Godman, a more accurate exposition of this event is given in the Sri Ramana Leela, the Telugu biography of Ramana that was written by Krishna Bhikshu, which "is surprisingly short, but it does have interesting additions and variations from the English version that was recorded by Narasimha Swami":[tpl]refn|group=note|According to David Godman, yet another account is given by Ramana in Vichara Sangraham (Self-Enquiry): "Therefore, leaving the corpse-like body as an actual corpse and remaining without even uttering the word 'I' by mouth, if one now keenly enquires, 'What is it that rises as "I"?’ then in the Heart a certain soundless sphurana, 'I-I', will shine forth of its own accord. It is an awareness that is single and undivided, the thoughts which are many and divided having disappeared. If one remains still without leaving it, even the sphurana – having completely annihilated the sense of the individuality, the form of the ego, 'I am the body' – will itself in the end subside, just like the flame that catches the camphor. This alone is said to be liberation by great ones and scriptures. (The Mountain Path, 1982, p. 98)."  The arguments for this conclusion are given by David Godman in David Godman (1991), 'I' and 'I-I' – A Reader's Query. The Mountain Path, 1991, pp. 79–88. Part one[/tpl] [tpl]refn|group=note|David Godman gives his own account of Ramana's death-experience, based on Narasimha's notes of 8 January 1930 and 5 February 1930. See [/tpl]

Ramana summarised his insight into "aham sphurana" (Self-awareness)[tpl]refn|group=note|David Godman: "Bhagavan frequently used the Sanskrit phrase aham sphurana to indicate the 'I-I' consciousness or experience. Aham means 'I' and sphurana can be translated as 'radiation, emanation, or pulsation'."[/tpl] to a visitor in 1945:[tpl]refn|group=note|An extensive account on Ramana's use of the words "Self", "I-I" and "aham sphurana" is given in [/tpl]
At first, Ramana thought that he was possessed by a spirit, "which had taken up residence in his body". This feeling remained for several weeks. Later in life, he called his death experience akrama mukti, "sudden liberation", as opposed to the krama mukti, "gradual liberation" as in the Vedanta path of jnana yoga:[tpl]refn|group=note|Rama P. Coomaraswamy: "is to be distinguished from jîvan-mukti, the state of total and immediate liberation attained during this lifetime, and videha-mukti, the state of total liberation attained at the moment of death."[tpl]sfn|Coomaraswamy|2004[/tpl] See Swami Krishnananda, ''The Attainment of Liberation: Progressive Salvation for more info on "gradual liberation".[/tpl]
After this event, he lost interest in school-studies, friends, and relations. Avoiding company, he preferred to sit alone, absorbed in concentration on the Self, and went daily to the Meenakshi Temple, ecstatically devoted to the images of the Gods, tears flowing profusely from his eyes.[tpl]sfn|Osborne|Year unknown[/tpl]
Venkataraman’s elder brother, Nagaswamy, was aware of a great change in him and on several occasions rebuked him for his detachment from all that was going on around him. About six weeks after Venkataraman’s absorption into the Self, on 29 August 1896, he was attempting to complete a homework assignment which had been given to him by his English teacher for indifference in his studies. Suddenly Venkataraman tossed aside the book and turned inward in meditation. His elder brother rebuked him again, asking, "What use is all this to one who is like this?", referring to his behaviour as a sadhu.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=29[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=25[/tpl] Venkataraman did not answer, but recognised the truth in his brother’s words.

===First years at Tiruvannamalai (1896–1899)===

====Journey to Tiruvannamalai (1896)====

He decided to leave his home and go to Arunachala. Knowing his family would not permit this, he slipped away, telling his brother he needed to attend a special class at school. Fortuitously, his brother asked him to take five rupees and pay his college fees on his way to school. Venkataraman took out an atlas, calculated the cost of his journey, took three rupees and left the remaining two with a note which read: 
[tpl]quote|I have set out in quest of my Father in accordance with his command. This (meaning his person) has only embarked on a virtuous enterprise. Therefore, no one need grieve over this act. And no money need be spent in search of this. Your college fee has not been paid. Herewith rupees two.[tpl]sfn|Sri Ramanasramam|1981[/tpl][/tpl]
On the morning of 1 September 1896, Venkataraman boarded the train and travelled to Tiruvannamalai, where he was to stay the rest of his life. On the three occasions in later life Venkataraman referred to himself he used the name Arunachala Ramana.[tpl]sfn|Ganesan|p=9[/tpl]

====Arunachaleswara temple (1896–1897)====

In Tiruvannamalai he went straight to the temple of Arunachaleswara. There, he entered the sanctum sanctorum and embraced the linga in ecstasy. The burning sensation that had started back at Madurai, which he later described as "an inexpressible anguish which I suppressed at the time", merged in Arunachaleswara.
The first few weeks he spent in the thousand-pillared hall, but shifted to other spots in the temple and eventually to the Patala-lingam vault so that he might remain undisturbed. There, he would spend days absorbed in such deep samādhi that he was unaware of the bites of vermin and pests. Seshadri Swamigal, a local saint, discovered him in the underground vault and tried to protect him.[tpl]sfn|Sri Ramanasramam|1981[/tpl] After about six weeks in the Patala-lingam, he was carried out and cleaned up. For the next two months he stayed in the Subramanya Shrine, so unaware of his body and surroundings that food had to be placed in his mouth or he would have starved.

====Gurumurtam temple (1897–1898)====

In February 1897, six months after his arrival at Tiruvannamalai, Ramana moved to Gurumurtam, a temple about a mile out of Tiruvannamalai.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=47[/tpl] Shortly after his arrival a sadhu named Palaniswami went to see him. Palaniswami's first darshan left him filled with peace and bliss, and from that time on he served Ramana, joining him as his permanent attendant. From Gurumurtam to Virupaksha Cave (1899–1916) to Skandasramam Cave (1916–22), he took care for Ramana. Besides physical protection, Palaniswami would also beg for alms, cook and prepare meals for himself and Ramana, and care for him as needed.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006[/tpl] In May 1898 Ramana and Palaniswami moved to a mango orchard next to Gurumurtam.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=52[/tpl]
During this time, Ramana neglected his body, "completely disregarding his outward appearance".[tpl]sfn|ebert|2006|p=48[/tpl] He also neglected the ants which bit him incessantly.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=50[/tpl] Gradually, despite Ramana's desire for privacy, he attracted attention from visitors who admired his silence and austerities, bringing offerings and singing praises.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=51[/tpl] Eventually a bamboo fence was built to protect him.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=51[/tpl]
While living at Gurumurtam temple his family discovered his whereabouts. First his uncle Nelliappa Iyer came and pled with him to return home, promising that the family would not disturb his ascetic life. Ramana sat motionless and eventually his uncle gave up.[tpl]sfn|Sri Sadhu Om|2005-A[/tpl]

====Pavalakkunru temple (1898–1899)====

In September 1898 Ramana moved to the Shiva-temple at Pavalakkunru, one of the eastern spurs of Arunachala. His mother and brother Nagaswami found him here in December 1898. Day after day his mother begged him to return, but no amount of weeping and pleading had any visible effect on him. She appealed to the devotees who had gathered around, trying to get them to intervene on her behalf until one requested that Ramana write out his response to his mother.[tpl]sfn|Sri Ramanasramam|1981|p=34[/tpl] He then wrote on a piece of paper,
At this point his mother returned to Madurai saddened.

===Arunachala (1899–1922)===

====Virupaksha Cave (1899–1916)====

Soon after this, in February 1899, Ramana left the foothills to live on Arunachala itself.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|p=71[/tpl] He stayed briefly in Satguru Cave and Guhu Namasivaya Cave before taking up residence at Virupaksha Cave for the next 17 years, using Mango Tree cave during the summers, except for a six-month period at Pachaiamman Koil during the plague epidemic.[tpl]sfn|Natarajan|2006|p=27-29[/tpl]
In 1902, a government official named Sivaprakasam Pillai, with writing slate in hand, visited the young Swami in the hope of obtaining answers to questions about "How to know one's true identity". The fourteen questions put to the young Swami and his answers were Ramana's first teachings on Self-enquiry, the method for which he became widely known, and were eventually published as 'Nan Yar?', or in English, 'Who am I?’.[tpl]sfn|Ramana Maharshi|1982[/tpl]
Several visitors came to him and many became his devotees. Kavyakantha Sri Ganapati Sastri,[tpl]refn|group=note|Literally, "One who has poetry in his throat".[/tpl] a Vedic scholar of repute in his age with a deep knowledge of the Srutis, Sastras, Tantras, Yoga, and Agama systems, came to visit Ramana in 1907. After receiving instructions from him, he proclaimed him as Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. Ramana was known by this name from then on.[tpl]sfn|Sri Sadhu Om|2005-A|p=15[/tpl]
In 1911 the first westerner, Frank Humphreys, then a policeman stationed in India, discovered Ramana and wrote articles about him which were first published in The International Psychic Gazette in 1913.[tpl]refn|group=note|See The wanderling, Account of Frank Humphreys, First Western Disciple for quotes from these publications.[/tpl]
It is reported that in 1912, while in the company of disciples, an episode occurred where Ramana's vital life signs ceased for approximately 15 minutes, after which he displayed an enhanced ability to engage in practical affairs while remaining in Sahaja Samadhi:

====Skandashram (1916–1922)====

In 1916 his mother Alagammal and younger brother Nagasundaram joined Ramana at Tiruvannamalai and followed him when he moved to the larger Skandashram Cave, where Bhagavan lived until the end of 1922. His mother took up the life of a sannyasin, and Ramana began to give her intense, personal instruction, while she took charge of the Ashram kitchen. Ramana's younger brother, Nagasundaram, then became a sannyasi, assuming the name Niranjanananda, becoming known as Chinnaswami (the younger Swami).
During this period, Ramana composed The Five Hymns to Arunachala, his magnum opus in devotional lyric poetry. Of
them the first is Akshara Mana Malai.[tpl]refn|group=translation|Marital Garland of Letters[/tpl] It was composed in Tamil in response to the request of a devotee for a song to be sung while wandering in the town for alms. The Marital Garland tells in glowing symbolism of the love and union between the human soul and God, expressing the attitude of the soul that still aspires.Introduction to Sri Ramana's Hymns to Arunachala, from The Collected Works of  Sri Ramana Maharshi

====Mother's death (1922)====

Beginning in 1920, his mother's health deteriorated. On the day of her death, 19 May 1922, at about 8 a.m., Ramana sat beside her. It is reported that throughout the day, he had his right hand on her heart, on the right side of the chest, and his left hand on her head, until her death around 8:00 p.m., when Ramana pronounced her liberated, literally, 'Adangi Vittadu, Addakam' (‘absorbed'). Later Ramana said of this: "You see, birth experiences are mental. Thinking is also like that, depending on sanskaras (tendencies). Mother was made to undergo all her future births in a comparatively short time."A.R. Natarajan, The Maharshi and His Mother Her body was enshrined in a samadhi, on top of which a Siva lingam was installed and given the name Matrbhuteshwara, Shiva manifesting as mother.[tpl]sfn|Godman|2000|p=140[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=44[/tpl] To commemorate the anniversary of Ramana Maharshi's mother's death, a puja, known as her Aradhana or Mahapooja, is performed every year at the Matrbhuteshwara.

===Ramanashram (1922–1950)===

From 1922 till his death in 1950 Ramana lived in Sri Ramanashramam, the ashram that developed around the mother's tomb.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=107-114[/tpl]

====Commencement of Ramanashram (1920s)====

Ramana often walked from Skandashram to his mother's tomb. In December 1922 he didn't return to Skandashram, and settled at the base of the Hill, and Sri Ramanasramam started to develop. At first, there was only one hut at the samadhi, but in 1924 two huts, one opposite the samadhi and the other to the north, were erected. The so-called Old Hall was built in 1928. Ramana lived here until 1949.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=109[/tpl]
Sri Ramanasramam grew to include a library, hospital, post-office and many other facilities. Ramana displayed a natural talent for planning building projects. Annamalai Swami gave detailed accounts of this in his reminiscences.[tpl]sfn|Godman|1998[/tpl] Until 1938, Annamalai Swami was entrusted with the task of supervising the projects and received his instructions from Ramana directly.

====Discovery by westerners (1930s)====

In 1931 the classic biography of Ramana Maharshi, Self Realisation: The Life and Teachings of Ramana Maharshi, written by Narasimha Swami, was published.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=140[/tpl] Ramana then became relatively well known in and out of India after 1934 when Paul Brunton, having first visited Ramana in January 1931, published the book A Search in Secret India.[tpl]sfn|Brunton|1994[/tpl] In this book he described his meeting with Ramana Maharshi, and the effect this meeting had on him. Brunton also describes how Ramana's fame had spread, "so that pilgrims to the temple were often induced to go up the hill and see him before they returned home",[tpl]sfn|Brunton|1994|p=289[/tpl] and the talks Ramana had with a great variety of visitors and devotees.[tpl]sfn|Brunton|1994|p=292-294[/tpl] Brunton calls Ramana "one of the last of India's spiritual supermen",[tpl]sfn|Brunton|1994|p=301[/tpl] and describes his affection toward Ramana:
[tpl]quote|I like him greatly because he is so simple and modest, when an atmosphere of authentic greatness lies so palpably around him; because he makes no claims to occult powers and hierophantic knowledge to impress the mysteryloving nature of his countrymen; and because he is so totally without any traces of pretension that he strongly resists every effort to canonize him during his lifetime.[tpl]sfn|Brunton|1994|p=302[/tpl][/tpl]
While staying at Sri Ramanasramam, Brunton had an experience of a "sublimely all-embracing" awareness,[tpl]sfn|Brunton|1994|p=304-305[/tpl] a "Moment of Illumination".[tpl]sfn|Brunton|1994|p=310[/tpl] The book was a best-seller, and introduced Ramana Maharshi to a wider audience in the west.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=140[/tpl] Resulting visitors included Paramahansa Yogananda, Somerset Maugham (whose 1944 novel The Razor's Edge models its spiritual guru after Ramana),David Godman (1988), Somerset Maugham and The Razor's Edge, The Mountain Path, 1988, pp. 239–45 Mercedes de Acosta and Arthur Osborne.

====Later years (1940s)====

In 1939 started the building of a temple which was erected over the mother's samadhi, called Mathrubhuteswara, "God in the form of the mother".[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=113-114[/tpl] Ramana's relative fame spread throughout the 1940s. However, even as his fame spread, his lifestyle remained that of a renunciate. The 1940s also saw many of Ramana's most ardent devotees pass away. These included Echamma (1945), attendant Madhavaswami (1946), Ramanatha Brahmachari (1946), Mudaliar Granny and Lakshmi (1948).[tpl]sfn|Krishna Bikshu|Year unknown|chapter=40[/tpl] In the late 1940s Arthur Osborne joined the ashram. He was the first editor of Mountain Path in 1964, the magazine published by Ramanashram.

====Final years (1948–1950)====

In November 1948, a tiny cancerous lump was found on Ramana's arm and was removed in February 1949 by the ashram's doctor. Soon, another growth appeared and another operation was done by an eminent surgeon in March 1949 with radium applied. The doctor told Ramana that a complete amputation of the arm to the shoulder was required to save his life, but he refused. A third and fourth operation were performed in August and December 1949, but only weakened him. Other systems of medicine were then tried; all proved fruitless and were stopped by the end of March when devotees gave up all hope. To devotees who begged him to cure himself for the sake of his followers, Ramana is said to have replied, "Why are you so attached to this body? Let it go" and "Where can I go? I am here."[tpl]sfn|Osborne|Year unknown[/tpl]
By April 1950, Ramana was too weak to go to the hall and visiting hours were limited. Visitors would file past the small room where he spent his final days to get one final glimpse. Swami Satyananda, the attendant at the time, reports,
Henri Cartier-Bresson, the French photographer, who had been staying at the ashram for a fortnight prior to Ramana’s death, recounted the event:
[tpl]quote|"It is a most astonishing experience. I was in the open space in front of my house, when my friends drew my attention to the sky, where I saw a vividly-luminous shooting star with a luminous tail, unlike any shooting star I had before seen, coming from the South, moving slowly across the sky and, reaching the top of Arunachala, disappeared behind it. Because of its singularity we all guessed its import and immediately looked at our watches – it was 8:47 – and then raced to the Ashram only to find that our premonition had been only too sadly true: the Master had passed into parinirvana at that very minute." Ramana Maharshi was 71 years old at the time of his death.[tpl]sfn|Cohen|1980[/tpl][/tpl]
Cartier-Bresson took some of the last photographs of Ramana on 4 April 1950, and went on to take pictures of the mahasamadhi preparations. The New York Times in its article dated 16 April 1950, concluded: 

==Charisma==

===Devotion for Ramana Maharshi===

Ramana Maharshi was a charismatic person,[tpl]sfn|Sivaramkrishna|2008|p=16[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Thompson|2011|p=43[/tpl] who attracted many devotees. Early on, Ramana was worshipped by his devotees. People came to Ramana Maharshi for darshana,[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=55, 57[/tpl] devotion to God by looking at him in the person of a guru or incarnation.[tpl]sfn|Hinduism Today|2007|p=149-151[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Bowker|2003|p=111[/tpl] Objects being touched or used by him were highly valued by his devotees, "as they considered it to be prasad and that it passed on some of the power and blessing of the Guru to them".[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=152-153[/tpl] People also tried to touch his feet,[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006[/tpl] which is also considered to be darshana.[tpl]sfn|Hinduism Today|2007|p=151-152[/tpl] Also the water which he used to wash his hands was valued. The bathing-water he used became an object for achamaniyam, "sipping drops of water for religious purpose".[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=153[/tpl] Sri Ramana strongly discouraged this type of activity, and constantly reminded people to turn within.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] While he spoke highly of the power of being in the physical proximity of a guru, he also said that physical contact with the guru was not necessary.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] When one devotee asked if it would be possible to prostrate before Sri Ramana and touch his feet, he replied,
[tpl]quote|The real feet of Bhagavan exist only in the heart of the devotee. To hold onto these feet incessantly is true happiness. You will be disappointed if you hold onto my physical feet because one day this physical body will disappear. The greatest worship is worshipping the Guru's feet that are within oneself.[tpl]sfn|Godman|1994[/tpl][/tpl]
In later life, the amount of devotees and their devotion became so extensive that Ramana became restricted in his daily routine.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=124-125[/tpl] Measures had to be taken to prevent people touching him.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=125[/tpl] Several times Ramana tried to escape from the ashram, to return to a life of solitude. Vasudeva reports:
[tpl]quote|Bhagavan sat on a rock and said with tears in his eyes that he would never again come to the Ashram and would go where he pleased and live in the forests or caves away from all men.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=126[/tpl][/tpl]
Ramana did return to the ashram, but has also reported himself on attempts to leave the ashram:
[tpl]quote|I tried to be free on a third occasion also. That was after mother's passing away. I did not want to have even an Ashram like Skandashram and the people that were coming there then. but the result has been this Ashram Ramanashram and all the crowd here. Thus all my three attempts failed.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=126[/tpl][/tpl]

===How Sri Ramana Lived===

Ramana was noted for his belief in the power of silence and his relatively sparse use of speech, as well as his lack of concern for fame or criticism.bhagavan-ramana.org, Sri Ramana Maharshi's Response to Criticism Ramana was noted for his unusual love of creatures and plants.[tpl]refn|group=note|One of the aspects of Shiva is Pashupati, "Lord of all animals".[tpl]sfn|Bowker|2003|p=60[/tpl][/tpl] On the morning of 18 June 1948, he realised his favourite cow Lakshmi was near death. Just as he had with his own Mother, Ramana placed his hands on her head and over her heart. The cow died peacefully at 11:30 a.m. and Ramana later declared that the cow was liberated.A. R. Natarajan, Timeless in Time
He led a modest and renunciate life. However, a popular image of him as a person who spent most of his time doing nothing except silently sitting in samadhi is highly inaccurate, according to David Godman, who has written extensively about Ramana. According to Godman, from the period when an Ashram began to rise around him after his mother arrived into his later years, Ramana was actually quite active in Ashram activities such as cooking and stitching leaf plates until his health failed.An Introduction to Sri Ramana's Life and Teachings. David Godman talks to John David. Page 3

===Lineage===

====Sri Ramana did not create any lineage====

Ramana did not publicise himself as a guru,[tpl]sfn|Forsthoefel|2005|p=37[/tpl] never claimed to have disciples,Geoffrey D. Falk, Stripping the Gurus. CHAPTER XXI. SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE A GOD (ANDREW COHEN) and never appointed any successors.John David, An Introduction to Sri Ramana's Life and Teachings. David Godman talks to John David. Page 6arunachala-ramana.org, Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi – Great Sage or Milch cow?[tpl]refn|group=note|"In actuality each of us is privy to his knowledge and blessing without any intermediary if we are open and receptive to the teachings. Each of us legitimately can claim lineage from Bhagavan although he himself was not part of any succession but stood alone, and in that sense of linear continuity he neither received nor gave initiation. But that is not the point, because though we each have the right to receive his grace, it is entirely different when it comes to assuming authority to disseminate the teachings. It is here we need to be very clear and separate the claims of wannabe gurus from the genuine devotees who are grateful recipients of grace."[/tpl] While a few who came to see him are said to have become enlightened through association,[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|For example, H. W. L. PoonjaPapaji Biography, With Ramana Again''[/tpl] he did not publicly acknowledge any living person as liberated other than his mother at death.[tpl]sfn|Osborne|1959|p=74[/tpl] Ramana never promoted any lineage.[tpl]refn|group=note|"There have been many senior devotees of Bhagavan who, in their own right, had both the ability and authority to teach in his name. Muruganar, Sadhu Natanananda and Kunju Swami are some of those who immediately spring to mind. None of them to my knowledge ever claimed pre-eminence and the prerogative to teach. They knew two things. One, there would be many who would bow to their superior knowledge and set them up as an independent source, but secondly, they also knew that to abrogate for themselves the privilege would run contrary to Bhagavan’s mission or purpose."[/tpl]
With regard to Sri Ramana Ashram, Sri Ramana had in 1938 executed a legal will bequething all the Ramanashram properties to his younger brother Niranjanananda and his descendants. The Ramanashram as in 2013 is run by Sri Niranjananda's grandson Sri V.S. Raman. Ramanashram is legally recognised as a public religious trust whose aim was to maintain Ramanasramam in a way that was consonant with Sri Ramana's declared wishes that is the ashram should remain open as a spiritual institution so that anyone who wished to could avail themselves of its facilities.

====Sri Ramana was not part of any lineage====

Although Ramana's teachings have often been labelled as Advaita Vedanta,[tpl]sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79[/tpl] he never received initiation into the Dashanami Sampradaya or any other sampradaya[tpl]refn|group=note|A sampradaya is a "tradition" or a "religious system".[tpl]sfn|Gupta|2002[/tpl] It is a succession of masters and disciples and their teachings.[/tpl] as a sannyasin.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=89[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|During a court case over the management of the ashram, Ramana declared himself an atiasrama,David Godman, Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi the Atiasrami, The Mountain Path, 1991, pp. 112–21 beyond all caste and religious restrictions, not attached to anything in life.[/tpl] A sannyasin belonging to the Sringeri Sharada Peetham, one of the monasteries founded by Adi Shankara, once tried to persuade Ramana to be initiated into sannyasa, but Ramana refused.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=89[/tpl] In the Arunachala Puranam,[tpl]refn|group=translation|Arunachala Puranam, Chapter Two[/tpl] left behind by an old man, Ramana found the following verse:  [tpl]quote|Those who reside within the radius of three yojanas (30 miles) of this place Arunachala, even if they have not had initiation, shall by my supreme decree attain Liberation, free from all attachments.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=89[/tpl][/tpl]
Ramana copied this verse on a slip of paper, and when the sannyasin returned, Ramana showed the verse, where-after the sannyasin gave up and left.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=89[/tpl]

===Context===

C.G. Jung objected to regarding Ramana as an "isolated phenomenon"[tpl]sfn|Wehr|2003[/tpl] Jung wrote the foreword to Heinrich Zimmer's Der Weg zum Selbst, "The Path to the Self" (1944),[tpl]sfn|Wehr|2003[/tpl] an early collection of translations of Ramana's teachings in a western language. According to Wehr, Jung regarded Ramana Maharshi not to be an "isolated phenomenon",[tpl]sfn|Wehr|2003[/tpl] but a token of Indian spirituality, "manifest in many forms in everyday Indian life":[tpl]sfn|Wehr|2003[/tpl]
[tpl]quote|He is of a type that has always existed and always will. Therefore it was not necessary to seek him out... He is merely the whitest spot on a white surface.[tpl]sfn|Hayman|1999|p=350[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|Jung's foreword is famously quoted in "The Spiritual Teachings of Ramana Maharshi", but after having undergone editing, as saying: "He is genuine and, in addition to that, something quite phenomenal. In India, he is the whitest spot in a white space. What we find in the life and teachings of Sri Ramana is the purest of India."[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|Nevertheless, in India Ramana Maharshi is regarded as one of the outstanding religious figures of modern India, together with people like Ram Mohan Roy, the founder of the Brahmo Samaj, Dayananda Saraswati, the founder of the Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Sri Aurobindo, Rabindranath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.[tpl]sfn|Sinari|2000[/tpl][/tpl][/tpl]
Alan Edwards has placed Ramana Maharshi in the context of western Orientalism, arguing that
[tpl]quote|...scholarship can misinterpret and misrepresent religious figures because of the failure to recognise the presence of stereotypes and assumptions, and also because of the failure to maintain critical distance when dealing with the rhetoric of devotional literature."New Zealand Asian Studies Society Inc, Newsletter No. 22, May 2011[tpl]refn|group=note|See Alan Edwards (2012), Ramana Maharshi and the Colonial Encounter.

====Indian context====

According to Zimmer and Jung, Ramana's appearance as a mauni, a silent saint absorbed in samadhi, fitted into pre-existing Indian notions of holiness.[tpl]sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=53-55[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Jung|1948|p=226-228[/tpl] They placed the Indian devotion toward Ramana Maharshi in this Indian context.[tpl]sfn|Jung|1948|p=226-228[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Wehr|2003[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|Michaels uses Bourdieu's notion of habitus to point to the power of "culturally acquired lifestyles and attitudes, habits and predispositions, as well as conscious, deliberate acts or mythological, theological, or philosophical artifacts and mental productions"[tpl]sfn|Michaels|2004|p=7[/tpl] in his understanding of Hinduism.[/tpl]

Ramana himself considered God, Guru and Self to be the manifestations of the same reality.A. Devaraja Mudaliar, Is a "living" Guru necessary? One of these manifestations is the mountain Arunachala, which is considered to be the manifestation of Shiva.[tpl]sfn|Godman|1985|p=2[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Cornille|1992|p=83[/tpl] It can be worshipped through the mantra "Om arunachala shivaya namah!"[tpl]sfn|Frawley|2000|p=121-122[/tpl] and by Pradakshina, walking around the mountain, a practice which was often performed by Ramana.[tpl]sfn|Cornille|1992|p=83[/tpl] Ramana considered Arunachala to be his Guru.[tpl]sfn|Cornille|1992|p=83[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Poonja|2000|p=59[/tpl] Asked about the special sanctity of Arunachala, Ramana said that Arunachala is Shiva himself.[tpl]sfn|Venkataramiah|1936|p=Talk 143[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|Shankara saw Arunchala as Mount Meru, which is in Indian mythology the axis of the world, and the abode of Brahman and the gods.Encyclopedia Britannica, Mount Meru[/tpl]  In his later years, Ramana said it was the spiritual power of Arunachala which had brought about his Self-realisation.[tpl]sfn|Godman|1985|p=2[/tpl] He composed the Five Hymns to Arunachala as devotional song.[tpl]sfn|Cornille|1992|p=83[/tpl] In later life, Ramana himself came to be regarded as Dakshinamurthy,[tpl]sfn|Frawley|1996|p=92-93[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Paranjape|2009|p=57-58[/tpl] an aspect of Shiva as a guru.

====Western context====

In the 1930s Ramana Maharshi's teachings were brought to the west by Paul Brunton in his A Search in Secret India.[tpl]sfn|Lucas|2011|p=99[/tpl] When this book was published in 1934, the western world had already been exposed to Indian religious thought for 150 years.[tpl]sfn|Renard|2010|p=176[/tpl] In 1785 appeared the first western translation of a Sanskrit-text.[tpl]sfn|Renard|2010|p=176[/tpl] It marked the growing interest in the Indian culture and languages.[tpl]sfn|Renard|2010|p=177[/tpl] The first translation of Upanishads appeared in two parts in 1801 and 1802,[tpl]sfn|Renard|2010|p=177[/tpl] which influenced Arthur Schopenhauer, who called them "the consolation of my life".[tpl]sfn|Renard|2010|p=178[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|And called his poodle "Atman".[tpl]sfn|Renard|2010|p=178[/tpl][/tpl] Early translations also appeared in other European languages.[tpl]sfn|Renard|2010|p=183-184[/tpl]
A major force in the mutual influence of eastern and western ideas and religiosity was the Theosophical Society,[tpl]sfn|Renard|2010|p=185-188[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sinari|2000[/tpl] of which Paul Brunton also had been a member. It searched for ancient wisdom in the east, spreading eastern religious ideas in the west.[tpl]sfn|Lavoie|2012[/tpl] One of its salient features was the belief in "Masters of Wisdom",[tpl]sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|See also Ascended Master Teachings[/tpl] "beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others".[tpl]sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32[/tpl] The Theosophical Society also spread western ideas in the east, aiding a modernisation of eastern traditions, and contributing to a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.[tpl]sfn|McMahan|2008[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|The Theosophical Society had a major influence on Buddhist modernism[tpl]sfn|McMahan|2008[/tpl] and Hindu reform movements,[tpl]sfn|Sinari|2000[/tpl] and the spread of those modernised versions in the west.[tpl]sfn|McMahan|2008[/tpl] The Theosophical Society and the Arya Samaj were united from 1878 to 1882, as the Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj.[tpl]sfn|Johnson|1994|p=107[/tpl] Along with H. S. Olcott and Anagarika Dharmapala, Blavatsky was instrumental in the Western transmission and revival of Theravada Buddhism.[tpl]sfn|McMahan|2008|p=98[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Gombrich|1996|p=185-188[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fields|1992|p=83-118[/tpl][/tpl] Another major influence was Vivekananda,[tpl]sfn|Renard|2010|p=189-193[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81[/tpl] who popularised his modernised inerpretation[tpl]sfn|Rambachan|1994[/tpl] of Advaita Vedanta in the 19th and early 20th century in both India and the west,[tpl]sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81[/tpl] emphasising anubhava ("personal experience"[tpl]sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=1[/tpl] over scriptural authority.[tpl]sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=1[/tpl]
Brunton also wasn't the first westerner who searched for masters in India.[tpl]sfn|Renard|2010|p=193[/tpl] Renard mentions Edward Carpenter as the most remarkable example, who wrote about his visit to a "Gnani" (jnani) in his "Adam's Peak to Elephanta'', published in 1892.[tpl]sfn|Renard|2010|p=193-194[/tpl]
Jung and Zimmer were two of the first westerners to pick up Ramana's teachings. Jung also wrote,
[tpl]quote|The life and teachings of Sri Ramana are important not only for the Indian but also for the Westerner. Not only do they form a record of great human interest, but also a warning message to a humanity which threatens to lose itself in the chaos of its unconsciousness and lack of control.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl][/tpl]
Stimulated by Arthur Osborne, in the 1960s Bhagawat Singh actively started to spread Ramana Maharshi's teachings in the USA.[tpl]sfn|Lucas|2011|p=99[/tpl] Since the 1970s western interest in Asian religions has seen a rapid growth. Ramana Maharshi's teachings have been further popularised in the west as neo-Advaita via H. W. L. Poonja and his students.[tpl]sfn|Swartz|2008|p=306-307[/tpl][tpl]sfn|lucas|2011|p=94[/tpl]

==Teachings==

Ramana gave upadesa, "instruction or guidance given to a disciple by his Guru",Arthur Osborne, Ramana Maharshi and the Path of Self-Knowledge. Glossary pointing to the true Self of the devotees and showing them the truth of it.[tpl]sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=192[/tpl]
Early on, Ramana attracted devotees who would sit in his company, and ask him questions. Several devotees recorded the answers to their own specific questions, or kept the sheets of paper on which Ramana answered, and had them later published.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=78[/tpl] Other devotees recorded the talks between Ramana and devotees, a large amount of which have also been published.
Though his teaching is consistent with and generally associated with Hinduism, the Upanishads and Advaita Vedanta, there are some differences with the traditional Advaitic school. Ramana gave his approval to a variety of paths and practices from various religions.

===Silence===

Ramana's main means of instruction of his devotees was through silence:Sr Ramanashram, Teachings[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=211-213[/tpl]
[tpl]quote|Sri Ramana used words sparingly and gave his most profound instruction in silence.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=144[/tpl][/tpl]
His method of teaching has been compared to Dakshinamurti, Shiva in the ascetic appearance of the Guru, who teaches through silence:
[tpl]quote|One evening, devotees asked Sri Ramana to explain the meaning of Shankara's hymn in praise of Dakshinamurti (Dakshinamurthy Stotram). They waited for his answer, but in vain. The Maharishi sat motionless on his seat, in total silence.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=212[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|This reminds of the use of silence by the householder Vimalakirti in the Vimalakirti Sutra, a popular Buddhist sutra.[/tpl][/tpl]
Commenting on the Dakshinamurti Stotra, Ramana said:
[tpl]quote|Silence is the true upadesa. It is the perfect upadesa. It is suited only for the most advanced seeker. The others are unable to draw full inspiration from it. Therefore, they require words to explain the Truth. But Truth is beyond words; it does not warrant explanation. All that is possible is to indicate It. How is that to be done?[tpl]sfn|Venkatramaiah|2000|p=433[/tpl][/tpl]

===Self-enquiry===

[tpl]Main|Self-enquiry[/tpl] [tpl]See also|Jnana Yoga|Hua Tou|Vipassana[/tpl]
Ramana urged people who came to him to practice self-enquiry. He directed people to look inward rather than seeking outside themselves for Realization: "The true Bhagavan resides in your Heart as your true Self. This is who I truly am".[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] Ramana's teachings about self-enquiry have been classified as the Path of Knowledge (Jnana marga) among the Indian schools of thought.

====Questioning "Who am I?"====

In response to questions on self-liberation and the classic texts on Yoga and Vedanta, Ramana recommended self-enquiry as the means to awaken to the "I-I"[tpl]refn|group=note|Ramana Maharshi: "(Aham, aham) ‘I-I’ is the Self; (Aham idam) “I am this” or “I am that” is the ego. Shining is there always. The ego is transitory; When the ‘I’ is kept up as ‘I’ alone it is the Self; when it flies at a tangent and says “this” it is the ego." [tpl]sfn|Venkataramiah|2000|p=363[/tpl] David Godman: "the expression 'nan-nan' ('I-I' in Tamil) would generally be taken to mean 'I am I' by a Tamilian. This interpretation would make 'I-I' an emphatic statement of Self-awareness akin to the biblical 'I am that I am' which Bhagavan occasionally said summarised the whole of Vedanta. Bhagavan himself has said that he used the term 'I-I' to denote the import of the word 'I'."[/tpl] and the Self:[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=202-213[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|"Self" refers to the Ātman.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=202-213[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|According to David Godman, the "I-I" is an intermediary realisation between the "I" (ego) and the Self: "The verses on 'I-I' that Bhagavan wrote are open to two interpretations. They can be taken either to mean that the 'I-I' is experienced as a consequence of realisation or as a precursor to it. My own view, and I would stress that it is only a personal opinion, is that the evidence points to it being a precursor only.David Godman (1991), "I" and "I-I" – A Reader's Query. The Mountain Path, 1991, pp. 79–88. Part two Ramana Maharshi: "Liberation (mukti) is the total destruction of the I-impetus (aham-kara, of the "me"- and "my"-impetus (mama-kara)".[tpl]sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=195[/tpl][/tpl]
[tpl]quote|Enquiry in the form 'Who am I' alone is the principal means. To make the mind subside, there is no adequate means other than self-enquiry. If controlled by other means, mind will remain as if subsided, but will rise again".[tpl]refn|group=note|"Nan Yar" by Sri Ramana as reproduced in Path of Sri Ramana, Part One, Fifth Edition. Page 149, :152.[/tpl][/tpl]
Basically "self-enquiry" is the constant attention to the inner awareness of "I" or "I am").[tpl]refn|group=note|Strictly speaking, "self-enquiry" is not the investigation of the "Self", "atman", but of the "I" or "heart", "aham" (Sanskrit), "nan" (Tamil).[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|According to Sadu Om, self-enquiry can also be seen as 'Self-attention' or 'Self-abiding'.[tpl]sfn|Sri Sadhu Om|2005-A[/tpl][/tpl] Sri Ramana Maharshi frequently recommended it as the most efficient and direct way of discovering the unreality of the ‘I'-thought. Enquiring the "I"-thought, one realises that it raises in the hṛdayam (heart[tpl]refn|group=note|"Hṛdayam" consists of two syllables 'hṛt' and 'ayam' which signify "I am the Heart".Vichara Marga, Ramana Maharshi's "Who Am I?" The use of the word "hṛdayam" is not unique to Ramana Maharshi. A famous Buddhist use is the Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya Sutra, the Heart Sutra[/tpl]). The 'I'-thought will disappear and only "I-I"David Godman (1991), 'I' and 'I-I' – A Reader's Query, The Mountain Path, 1991, pp. 79–88. Part one or Self-awareness remains, which is Self-realization or liberation:[tpl]cite web|title=Self-enquiry|url=http://www.hinduism.co.za/self-enq.htm|accessdate=29 December 2012[/tpl]
[tpl]quote|What is finally realized as a result of such enquiry into the Source of Aham-vritti (I-thought) is verily the Heart as the undifferentiated Light of Pure Consciousness, into which the reflected light of the mind is completely absorbed.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=210-211[/tpl][/tpl]
Ramana warned against considering self-enquiry as an intellectual exercise. Properly done, it involves fixing the attention firmly and intensely on the feeling of 'I', without thinking. Attention must be fixed on the 'I' until the sense of "I" disappears and the Self is realised. Ramana's written works contain terse descriptions of self-enquiry. Verse thirty of Ulladu Narpadu:
Verses nineteen and twenty of Upadesa Undiyar describe the same process in almost identical terms:

Ramana considered the Self to be permanent and enduring,[tpl]sfn|Venkataramiah|2000|p=463[/tpl] surviving physical death.[tpl]sfn|Venkataramiah|2000|p=308[/tpl] "The sleep, dream and waking states are mere phenomena appearing on the Self",[tpl]sfn|Venkataramiah|2000|p=462[/tpl] as is the "I"-thought.[tpl]sfn|Venkataramiah|2000|p=463[/tpl] Our "true nature" is "simple Being, free from thoughts".[tpl]sfn|Venkataramiah|2000|p=467[/tpl] Ramana's own death experience when he was 16 already contains the practice of self-enquiry. After raising the question 'Who am I?' he "turned his attention very keenly towards himself".[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

====Nan Yar?====

His earliest teachings are documented in the book Nan Yar? (Who am I?), in which he elaborates on the "I" and Self-enquiry:[tpl]refn|group=note|The original book was first written in Tamil, and published by Sri Pillai.[tpl]sfn|Ramana Maharshi|1982[/tpl] The essay version of the book (Sri Ramana Nutrirattu) prepared by Ramana is considered definitive, as unlike the original it had the benefit of his revision and review. "Nan Yar" was documented by his disciple M. Sivaprakasam Pillai, who was already heavily influenced by traditional Advaita, and so had added notes about the traditional Advaitic negation method for his own clarification; these additional notes were later removed by Sri Ramana.[tpl]sfn|Sadhu Om|2005-A|p=147[/tpl] A careful translation with notes is available in English as 'The Path of Sri Ramana, Part One' by Sri Sadhu Om, one of the direct disciples of Ramana.[tpl]sfn|Sri Sadhu Om|2005-A[/tpl][/tpl]

===Bhakti===

Although he advocated self-enquiry as the fastest means to realisation, he also recommended the path of bhakti and self-surrender (to one's deity or guru) either concurrently or as an adequate alternative, which would ultimately converge with the path of self-enquiry.[tpl]sfn|Sri Sadhu Om|2005-B[/tpl]

Throughout his life, through contact with educated devotees like Ganapata Muni,[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=147[/tpl] Ramana Maharshi became acquainted with works on Shaivism and Advaita Vedanta, and used them to explain his insights:[tpl]sfn|Narasimha|1993|p=24[/tpl]
[tpl]quote|People wonder how I speak of Bhagavad Gita, etc. It is due to hearsay. I have not read the Gita nor waded through commentaries for its meaning. When I hear a sloka (verse), I think its meaning is clear and I say it. That is all and nothing more.[tpl]sfn|Venkataramiah|2000|p=315[/tpl][/tpl]

===Study through devotees===

Already in 1896, a few months after his arrival at Arunachala, Ramana attracted his first disciple, Uddandi Nayinar,[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=45-46[/tpl] who recognised in the him "the living embodiment of the Holy Scriptures".[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=46[/tpl] Uddandi was well-versed in classic texts on Yoga and Vedanta, and recited texts as the Yoga Vasistha and Kaivalya Navaneeta in Ramana's presence.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=46[/tpl]
In 1897 Ramana was joined by Palaniswami, who became his attendant.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=51-52[/tpl] Palaniswami studied books in Tamil on Vedanta, such as Kaivalya Navaneeta, Shankara's Vivekachudamani, and Yoga Vasistha. He had difficulties understanding Tamil. Ramana read the books too, and explained them to Palanaswami.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=53[/tpl]
As early as 1900, when Ramana was 20 years old, he became acquainted with the teachings of the Hindu monk and Neo-Vedanta[tpl]sfn|Mukerji|1983[/tpl][tpl]sfn|King|1999[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|See also.Kelamuni, Explorations in Neo-Vedanta and Perennialism[/tpl] teacher Swami Vivekananda through Gambhiram Seshayya. Seshayya was interested in yoga techniques, and "used to bring his books and explain his difficulties".[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=77[/tpl] Ramana answered on small scraps of paper, which were collected after his death in the late 1920s in a booklet called Vichara Sangraham, "Self-enquiry".[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=77[/tpl]

===Referred works===

thumb| Adi Shankara with Disciples, by Raja Ravi Varma (1904) Ramana often mentioned and encouraged the study of the following classical works[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=147[/tpl] which are associated with Advaita Vedanta and Shaivism: 

===Shaivism===

Though Ramana's teachings are often considered to be akin to Vedanta, his spiritual life is also associated with Shaivism.[tpl]refn|group=note|Shankara himself was said to be a shaivite, or even a reincarnation of Shiva.[tpl]sfn|Dalal|2011|p=371[/tpl][/tpl] In contrast to Shankara's Vedanta, which speaks of Maya and sees "this world as a trap and an illusion, Shaivism says it is the embodiment of the Divine".[tpl]sfn|Shankarananda|2011[/tpl] It speaks of "the Goddess Shakti, or spiritual energy, portrayed as the Divine Mother who redeems the material world".[tpl]sfn|Shankarananda|2011[/tpl]
Shaiva Siddhanta, the Shaivism which is prevalent in Tamil Nadu, combines the original emphasis on ritual fused with an intense devotional tradition expressed in the bhakti poetry of the Nayanars.[tpl]sfn|Flood|1996|p=168[/tpl] The Tamil compendium of devotional songs known as Tirumurai, along with the Vedas, the Shaiva Agamas and "Meykanda" or "Siddhanta" Shastras, form the scriptural canon of Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta.[tpl]sfn|Arulsamy|1987|p=1[/tpl] Osborne notes that Ramana was born at Arudra Darshan, the day of the 'Sight of Siva'
As a youth, prior to his awakening, Ramana read the Periya Puranam, the stories of the 63 Tamil saints.[tpl]sfn|Narasimha|1993|p=17[/tpl] In later life, he told those stories to his devotees:
[tpl]quote|When telling these stories, he used to dramatize the characters of the main figures in voice and gesture and seemed to identify himself fully with them.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=147[/tpl][/tpl]
In later life, he came to be regarded as a Dakshinamurthy, an aspect of Shiva as a guru of all types of knowledge, and bestower of jnana. This aspect of Shiva is his personification as the supreme or the ultimate awareness, understanding and knowledge.[tpl]sfn|Dallapiccola|2002[/tpl] This form represents Shiva in his aspect as a teacher of yoga, music, and wisdom, and giving exposition on the shastras.
Ramana considered the Self to be his guru, in the form of the sacred mountain Arunachala, where he spent his adult life.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2011[/tpl] Arunachala is a holy hill at Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu, where the Annamalaiyar Temple, a temple of Lord Shiva is located. It is one of the five main shaivite holy places in South India.[tpl]sfn|Singh|2009[/tpl]
One of the works that Ramana used to explain his insights was the Ribhu Gita, a song at the heart of the Shivarahasya Purana, one of the 'Shaiva Upapuranas' or ancillary Purana regarding Shiva and Shaivite worship. Another work used by him was the Dakshinamurthy Stotram, a text by Shankara.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=147[/tpl] It is a hymn to Shiva, explaining Advaita Vedanta.

===Vedanta===

Ramana's teachings are often interpreted as Advaita Vedanta, though Ramana Maharshi never "received diksha (initiation) from any recognised authority".Sri Ramanasramam, "A lineage of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi?"[tpl]refn|group=note|Advaita Vedanta has become a broad current in Indian Culture,[tpl]sfn|King|1999|p=135[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sinari|2000[/tpl] extending far beyond the Dashanami Sampradaya. It was popularised in the 20th century in both India and the west by Vivekananda,[tpl]sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81[/tpl][tpl]sfn|King|1999|p=135[/tpl] who emphasised anubhava ("personal experience"[tpl]sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=1[/tpl] over scriptural authority,[tpl]sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=1[/tpl] Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan,[tpl]sfn|King|1999|p=135[/tpl] and western orientalists who regarded Vedanta to be the "central theology of Hinduism".[tpl]sfn|King|1999|p=135[/tpl] Oriental scholarship portrayed Hinduism as a "single world religion",[tpl]sfn|King|1999|p=135[/tpl] and denigrated the heterogeneousity of Hindu beliefs and practices as 'distortions' of the basic teachings of Vedanta.[tpl]sfn|King|1999|p=135[/tpl] The same tendency to prefer an essential core teaching has been prevalent in western scholarship of Theravada Buddhism,[tpl]sfn|mcMahan|2008[/tpl] and has also been constructed by D.T. Suzuki in his presentation of Zen-Buddhism to the west.[tpl]sfn|McMahan|2008[/tpl][tpl]sfn|McRae|2003[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|David Gordon White notes: "Many Western indologists and historians of religion specializing in Hinduism never leave the unalterable worlds of the scriptures they interpret to investigate the changing real-world contexts out of which those texts emerged". He argues for "an increased emphasis on non-scriptural sources and a focus on regional traditions".[tpl]sfn|White|2006|p=104[/tpl][/tpl] It was via his devotees that he became acquainted with classic texts on Yoga and Vedanta.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Zimmer|1948[/tpl] Ramana himself did not call his insights advaita:

There are differences with the traditional Advaitic school. Advaita recommends a negationist neti, neti (Sanskrit, "not this", "not this") path,[tpl]refn|group=note|The traditional Advaitic (non-dualistic) school advocates "elimination of all that is non-self (the five sheaths) until only the Self remains".Vivekachudamani, Verse 210, Sri Sankaracharya. No exact edition given. The five kosas, or sheaths, that hide the true Self are: Material, Vital, Mental, Knowledge, and Blissful.[/tpl] or mental affirmations that the Self was the only reality, such as "I am Brahman" or "I am He". Ramana advocated the enquiry "Nan Yar" (Tamil, "Who am I"). And Sri Ramana, unlike the traditional Advaitic school, strongly discouraged devotees from adopting a renunciate lifestyle and renouncing their responsibilities. To one devotee who felt he should abandon his family, whom he described as "samsara" (illusion), to intensify his spiritual practice, Sr Ramana replied,
[tpl]quote|Oh! Is that so? What really is meant by samsara? Is it within or without? Wife, children and others. Is that all the samsara? What have they done? Please find out first what really is meant by samsara. Afterwards we shall consider the question of abandoning them.[tpl]sfn|Letters from Sri Ramanasramam|1973[/tpl][/tpl]

==Notable devotees==

Over the course of Ramana's lifetime, people from a wide variety of backgrounds, religions, and countries were drawn to him. Some stayed for the rest of their lives (or his) and served him with great devotion, and others came for a single darshan and left, deeply affected by the peace he radiated.
Quite a number of devotees wrote books conveying Ramana's teachings: 
Several western authors have been instrumental in gaining western attention for Ramana Maharshi:
H. W. L. Poonja and his students have been instrumental in the further popularisation of Ramana through the so-called Neo-Advaita or Satsang-movement.[tpl]sfn|Swartz|2008|p=306-307[/tpl][tpl]sfn|lucas|2011|p=94[/tpl] The Neo-Advaita movement has been criticised for its emphasis on insight alone, omitting the preparatory practices,Timothy Conway, Neo-Advaita or Pseudo-Advaita and Real Advaita-NondualityJames Swartz, What is Neo-Advaita? and Poonja has been sharply criticised for too easily authorising students to teach.[tpl]sfn|Caplan|2009|p=16-17[/tpl] Nevertheless, Neo-Advaita has become an important constituent of popular western spirituality.[tpl]sfn|Lucas|2011|p=109[/tpl]
Attendants of Ramana included Palaniswami (from 1897), Kunju Swami (from 1920), Madhava Swami, Ramanatha Brahmachari, Krishnaswami, Rangaswamy, Sivananda, Krishna Bhikshu and Annamalai Swami (from 1928). The devoted ladies who cooked for Bhagavan and his devotees in the ashram kitchen include Shantamma, Sampurnamma, Subbalakshmi Ammal, Lokamma, and Gowri Ammal.
Swami Ramdas visited Ramana Maharshi while on pilgrimage in 1922, and after darshan, spent the next 21 days meditating in solitude in a cave on Arunachala. Thereafter, he attained the direct realisation that "All was Rama, nothing but Rama".The Mountain Path, January 1965, Swami Ramdas
William Somerset Maugham, the English author, wrote a chapter entitled "The Saint" in his last book "Points of View." This chapter is devoted to Ramana Maharshi, whom Maugham had at one time visited before Indian independence.
Indian National Congress politician and freedom-fighter, O. P. Ramaswamy Reddiyar, who served as the Premier of Madras from 1947 to 1949, was also a devoted follower of Ramana Maharshi. Ramaswami Pillai, Balarama Reddy, Ramani Ammal, Kanakammal, Meenakshi Ammal, Perumalswami and Rayar are some of the other long standing devotees who came into the Sannadhi of Bhagavan during his life at Sri Ramanasramam.
Maurice Frydman (a.k.a. Swami Bharatananda), a Polish Jew who later translated Nisargadatta Maharaj's work "I Am That" from Marathi to English, was also deeply influenced by Ramana's teachings.
Many of the questions published in Maharshi's Gospel (1939) were put by Maurice, and they elicited detailed replies from the Maharshi. About Frydman, Sri Ramana had remarked "He (Maurice Frydman) belongs only here (to India). Somehow he was born abroad, but has come again here." Mountain Path, No. 1, 1977, Maurice Frydman by Dr. M.Sadashiva Rao

==Works==

===Writings===

Ramana "never felt moved to formulate his teaching of his own accord, either verbally or in writing".[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=78[/tpl] The few writings he is credited with "came into being as answers to questions asked by his disciples or through their urging".[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=78[/tpl] Only a few hymns were written on his own initiative.[tpl]sfn|Ebert|2006|p=78[/tpl]
Writings by Ramana are:

===Recorded talks===

Several collections of recorded talks, in which Ramana used Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam, have been published. Those are based on written transcripts, which were "hurriedly written down in English by his official interpreters".[tpl]refn|group=note|David Godman: "Because some of the interpreters were not completely fluent in English some of the transcriptions were either ungrammatical or written in a kind of stilted English which occasionally makes Sri Ramana sound like a pompous Victorian."[/tpl]
