Since the 1960s, the country has suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict. The conflict escalated in the 1990s, but since 2000 the conflict has decreased considerably.
Colombia is ethnically diverse, the descendants of the original native inhabitants, Spanish colonists, Africans originally brought to the country as slaves, and 20th-century immigrants from Europe and the Middle East have produced a diverse cultural heritage.  This has also been influenced by Colombia's varied geography, and the imposing landscape of the country has resulted in the development of very strong regional identities. The majority of the urban centres are located in the highlands of the Andes mountains, but Colombian territory also encompasses Amazon rainforest, tropical grassland and both Caribbean and Pacific coastlines.

==Etymology==

The name "Colombia" is derived from the last name of Christopher Columbus ([tpl]lang-it|Cristoforo Colombo[/tpl], [tpl]lang-es|Cristóbal Colón[/tpl]). It was conceived by the Venezuelan revolutionary Francisco de Miranda as a reference to all the New World, but especially to those under the Spanish and Portuguese rule. The name was later adopted by the Republic of Colombia of 1819, formed out of the territories of the old Viceroyalty of New Granada (modern-day Colombia, Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador, and northwest Brazil).[tpl]cite web|author=Carlos Restrepo Piedrahita|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/febrero1992/febrero2.htm|title=El nombre "Colombia", El único país que lleva el nombre del Descubrimiento|work=Revista Credencial|date=February 1992|accessdate=29 February 2008|language=Spanish[/tpl]
In 1835, when Venezuela and Ecuador parted ways, the Cundinamarca region that remained became a new country – the Republic of New Granada. In 1858 New Granada officially changed its name to the Granadine Confederation, then in 1863 the United States of Colombia, before finally adopting its present name – the Republic of Colombia – in 1886.
To refer to the country, the Colombian government uses the terms Colombia and República de Colombia.

==History==

===Pre-Columbian era===

Due to its geographical location, the present territory of Colombia was a corridor of population migration from Mesoamerica and the Andes to the Caribbean and Amazon. The oldest archaeological finds are from the Pubenza and El Totumo sites in the Magdalena Valley 100 km southwest of Bogotá, dating from about 14,400 BCE.[tpl]cite journal|last=Correal|first=Urrego G.|title=Nuevas evidencias culturales pleistocenicas y megafauna en Colombia|journal=Boletin de Arqueologia|year=1993|issue=8|pages=3–13[/tpl]  These sites correspond to the Paleoindian period (18,000-8000 BCE).  In Puerto Hormiga and other sites, traces from the Archaic Period (~8000-2000 BCE) have been found.  Vestiges indicate that there was also early occupation in regions like El Abra and Tequendama in Cundinamarca. The oldest pottery discovered in the Americas, found at San Jacinto, dates to 5000 - 4000 BCE.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hoopes|first=John|title=Ford Revisited: A Critical Review of the Chronology and Relationships of the Earliest Ceramic Complexes in the New World, 6000-1500 B.C. (1994)|journal=Journal of World Prehistory|year=1994|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1–50[/tpl]
By 10,500 BCE, the territory of what is now Colombia was inhabited by aboriginal people. Nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes existed near present-day Bogotá (at El Abra and Tequendama sites) which traded with one another and with cultures living in the Magdalena River Valley.Van der Hammen, T. and Correal, G. 1978: "Prehistoric man on the Sabana de Bogotá: data for an ecological prehistory"; Paleography, Paleoclimatology, Paleoecology 25:179–190 Between 5000 and 1000 BCE, hunter-gatherer tribes transitioned to agrarian societies; fixed settlements were established, and pottery appeared. Beginning in the 1st millennium BCE, groups of Amerindians including the Muisca, Quimbaya, and Tairona developed the political system of "cacicazgos" with a pyramidal structure of power headed by caciques. The Muiscas inhabited mainly the area of what is now the Departments of Boyacá and Cundinamarca high plateau (Altiplano Cundiboyacense). They farmed maize, potato, quinoa and cotton, and traded worked gold, emeralds, blankets, ceramic handicrafts, coca and salt with neighboring nations. The Taironas inhabited northern Colombia in the isolated Andes mountain range of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.Broadbent, Sylvia 1965: Los Chibchas: organización socio-política. Série Latinoamericana 5. Bogotá: Facultad de Sociología, Universidad Nacional de Colombia  The Quimbayas inhabited regions of the Cauca River Valley between the Occidental and Central cordilleras.

In 1717 the Viceroyalty of New Granada was originally created, and then it was temporarily removed, to finally be reestablished in 1739. The Viceroyalty had Santa Fé de Bogotá as its capital. This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America which had previously been under the jurisdiction of the Viceroyalties of New Spain or Peru and correspond mainly to today's Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama. So, Bogotá became one of the principal administrative centers of the Spanish possessions in the New World, along with Lima and Mexico City, though it remained somewhat backward compared to those two cities in several economic and logistical ways.

===Independence===

Since the beginning of the periods of conquest and colonization, there were several rebel movements under Spanish rule, most of them were either crushed or remained too weak to change the overall situation. The last one which sought outright independence from Spain sprang up around 1810, following the independence of St. Domingue (present-day Haiti) in 1804, which provided a non-negligible degree of support to the eventual leaders of this rebellion: Simón Bolívar and Francisco de Paula Santander.
A movement initiated by Antonio Nariño, who opposed Spanish centralism and led the opposition against the viceroyalty, led to the independence of Cartagena in November 1811, and the formation of two independent governments which fought a civil war – a period known as La Patria Boba. The following year Nariño proclaimed the United Provinces of New Granada, headed by Camilo Torres Tenorio. Despite the successes of the rebellion, the emergence of two distinct ideological currents among the liberators (federalism and centralism) gave rise to an internal clash which contributed to the reconquest of territory by the Spanish. The viceroyalty was restored under the command of Juan de Samano, whose regime punished those who participated in the uprisings. The retribution stoked renewed rebellion, which, combined with a weakened Spain, made possible a successful rebellion led by the Venezuelan-born Simón Bolívar, who finally proclaimed independence in 1819. The pro-Spanish resistance was finally defeated in 1822 in the present territory of Colombia and in 1823 in Venezuela.
The territory of the Viceroyalty of New Granada became the Republic of Colombia organized as a union of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela (Panama was then an integral part of Colombia). The Congress of Cúcuta in 1821 adopted a constitution for the new Republic. Simón Bolívar became the first President of Colombia, and Francisco de Paula Santander was made Vice President. However, the new republic was unstable and ended with the rupture of Venezuela in 1829, followed by Ecuador in 1830.
Colombia was the first constitutional government in South America, and the Liberal and Conservative parties, founded in 1848 and 1849 respectively, are two of the oldest surviving political parties in the Americas. Slavery was abolished in Colombia in 1851.[tpl]cite book | last = Aguilera| first = Miguel| title = La Legislacion y el derecho en Colombia| series = Historia extensa de Colombia| volume = 14| publisher = Lemer | year = 1965| location = Bogota| pages = 428–442[/tpl]
Internal political and territorial divisions led to the secession of Venezuela and Quito (today's Ecuador) in 1830. The so-called "Department of Cundinamarca" adopted the name "Nueva Granada", which it kept until 1856 when it became the "Confederación Granadina" (Granadine Confederation). After a two-year civil war in 1863, the "United States of Colombia" was created, lasting until 1886, when the country finally became known as the Republic of Colombia. Internal divisions remained between the bipartisan political forces, occasionally igniting very bloody civil wars, the most significant being the Thousand Days' War (1899–1902).

===20th century===

The United States of America's intentions to influence the area (especially the Panama Canal construction and control) led to the separation of the Department of Panama in 1903 and the establishment of it as a nation. The United States paid Colombia $25,000,000 in 1921, seven years after completion of the canal, for redress of President Roosevelt's role in the creation of Panama, and Colombia recognized Panama under the terms of the Thomson–Urrutia Treaty.
Colombia was engulfed in the Year-Long War with Peru over a territorial dispute involving the Amazonas department and its capital Leticia.
Soon after, Colombia achieved some degree of political stability, which was interrupted by a bloody conflict that took place between the late 1940s and the early 1950s, a period known as La Violencia ("The Violence"). Its cause was mainly mounting tensions between the two leading political parties, which subsequently ignited after the assassination of the Liberal presidential candidate Jorge Eliécer Gaitán on 9 April 1948. The ensuing riots in Bogotá, known as El Bogotazo, spread throughout the country and claimed the lives of at least 180,000 Colombians.[ref]
On 9 April 1948, Gaitán was assassinated outside his law offices in downtown Bogotá. The assassination marked the start of a decade of bloodshed, called La Violencia (the violence), which took the lives of an estimated 180,000 Colombians before it subsided in 1958.[/ref]
Colombia entered the Korean War when Laureano Gómez was elected as President. It was the only Latin American country to join the war in a direct military role as an ally of the United States. Particularly important was the heroic resistance of the Colombian troops at Old Baldy. [tpl]cite web|title= Colombia y los Estados Unidos en la Guerra de Corea|author1= Carlos Horacio Urán|publisher= The Kellogg Institute for International Studies|year= 1986|url= http://kellogg.nd.edu/publications/workingpapers/WPS/069.pdf|language= Spanish[/tpl]
From 1953 to 1964 the violence between the two political parties decreased first when Gustavo Rojas deposed the President of Colombia in a coup d'état and negotiated with the guerrillas, and then under the military junta of General Gabriel París Gordillo.
After Rojas' deposition, the Colombian Conservative Party and Colombian Liberal Party agreed to create the "National Front", a coalition which would jointly govern the country. Under the deal, the presidency would alternate between conservatives and liberals every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices. The National Front ended "La Violencia", and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance for Progress. In the end, the contradictions between each successive Liberal and Conservative administration made the results decidedly mixed. Despite the progress in certain sectors, many social and political problems continued, and guerrilla groups were formally created such as the FARC, ELN, EPL, MAQL and M-19 to fight the government and political apparatus.
Since the 1960s, the country has suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict between the government forces, left-wing guerrilla groups and right-wing paramilitaries.

===Recent history===

During the presidency of Álvaro Uribe, the government applied more military pressure on the FARC and other outlawed groups. After the offensive, many security indicators improved.  Since 2002 the violence decreased significantly, with some paramilitary groups demobilizing as part of a controversial peace process and the guerrillas lost control of much of the territory they had once dominated. Colombia achieved a great decrease in cocaine production, leading White House drug czar R. Gil Kerlikowske to announce that Colombia is no longer the world's biggest producer of cocaine.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45589&Cr=drugs&Cr1=#.UgRVaOEu3zo|title= Colombia grew less coca in 2012, UN survey reports |publisher= un.org|accessdate= 8 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/07/white-house-colombia-is-no-longer-top-cocaine-producer/1|title= Colombia no longer top cocaine producer| publisher=usatoday.com|accessdate= 24 April 2013|date=30 July 2012[/tpl]

==Geography==

The geography of Colombia is characterized by its six main natural regions that present their own unique characteristics, from the Andes mountain range region shared with Ecuador and Venezuela; the Pacific coastal region shared with Panama and Ecuador; the Caribbean coastal region shared with Venezuela and Panama; the Llanos (plains) shared with Venezuela; the Amazon Rainforest region shared with Venezuela, Brazil, Peru and Ecuador; to the  insular area, comprising islands in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.colombia-sa.com/geografia/geografia-in.html|title= Natural regions of Colombia and description of the three branches of the andes cordillera|publisher = colombia-sa.com |accessdate= 7 March 2014[/tpl]
Colombia is bordered to the east by Venezuela and Brazil; to the south by Ecuador and Peru; to the north by Panama and the Caribbean Sea; and to the west by Ecuador and the Pacific Ocean. Including its islands, it lies between latitudes 16°N and 5°S, and longitudes 66° and 84°W.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.granalisis.org/htm/colombia/ubicacion.htm|title= Location, boundaries and geography|publisher = granalisis.org |accessdate= 7 March 2014|language= Spanish [/tpl]
Part of the Ring of Fire, a region of the world subject to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions,[tpl]cite web |url= http://seisan.ingeominas.gov.co/RSNC/index.php/material-educativo|title= Colombia is part of the Ring of Fire|publisher = seisan.ingeominas.gov.co |accessdate= 7 March 2014|language= Spanish[/tpl]  Colombia is dominated by the Andes (which contain the majority of the country's urban centres). Beyond the Colombian Massif (in the south-western departments of Cauca and Nariño) these are divided into three branches known as cordilleras (mountain ranges): the Cordillera Occidental, running adjacent to the Pacific coast and including the city of Cali; the Cordillera Central, running between the Cauca and Magdalena river valleys (to the west and east respectively) and including the cities of Medellín, Manizales, Pereira and Armenia; and the Cordillera Oriental, extending north east to the Guajira Peninsula and including Bogotá, Bucaramanga and Cúcuta.
Peaks in the Cordillera Occidental exceed [tpl]convert|4700|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl], and in the Cordillera Central and Cordillera Oriental they reach [tpl]convert|5000|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. At [tpl]convert|2600|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl], Bogotá is the highest city of its size in the world.
East of the Andes lies the savanna of the Llanos, part of the Orinoco River basin, and, in the far south east, the jungle of the Amazon rainforest. Together these lowlands comprise over half Colombia's territory, but they contain less than 3% of the population. To the north the Caribbean coast, home to 20% of the population and the location of the major port cities of Barranquilla and Cartagena, generally consists of low-lying plains, but it also contains the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range, which includes the country's tallest peaks (Pico Cristóbal Colón and Pico Simón Bolívar), and the La Guajira Desert. By contrast the narrow and discontinuous Pacific coastal lowlands, backed by the Serranía de Baudó mountains, are sparsely populated and covered in dense vegetation. The principal Pacific port is Buenaventura.
The main rivers of Colombia are Magdalena, Cauca, Guaviare, Atrato, Meta, Putumayo and Caquetá. Colombia has four main drainage systems: the Pacific drain, the Caribbean drain, the Orinoco Basin and the Amazon Basin. The Orinoco and Amazon Rivers mark limits with Colombia to Venezuela and Peru respectively.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.colombia-sa.com/geografia/geografia-in-2.html|title= Hydrography of Colombia|publisher = colombia-sa.com |accessdate= 7 March 2014[/tpl]

===Climate===

Colombians customarily describe their country in terms of the climatic zones. Below [tpl]convert|1000|m|ft|0|sp=us[/tpl] in elevation is the tierra caliente (hot land), where temperatures are above [tpl]convert|24|°C|°F|1[/tpl]. About 82.5% of the country's total area lies in the tierra caliente.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/economia/colombia/eco1.htm|title= Thermal floors |publisher = banrepcultural.org |accessdate= 25 February 2014|language = Spanish[/tpl]
The majority of the population can be found in the tierra templada (temperate land, between [tpl]convert|1001|and|2000|m|ft|0|sp=us[/tpl]), where temperatures vary between [tpl]convert|17|and|24|°C|°F|1[/tpl] and the tierra fría (cold land, [tpl]convert|2001|and|3000|m|ft|0|sp=us[/tpl]).

In the tierra fría mean temperatures range between [tpl]convert|12|and|17|°C|°F|1[/tpl]. Beyond the tierra fría lie the alpine conditions of the forested zone and then the treeless grasslands of the páramos. Above [tpl]convert|4000|m|ft|0|sp=us[/tpl], where temperatures are below freezing, is the tierra helada, a zone of permanent snow and ice.

==Government and politics==

The government of Colombia takes place within the framework of a presidential representative democratic republic as established in the Constitution of 1991. In accordance with the principle of separation of powers, government is divided into three branches: the executive branch, the legislative branch and the judicial branch.  Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title V - Concerning the organization of the state - Chapter 1 - Concerning the structure of the state - Article 113)
As the head of the executive branch, the President of Colombia serves as both head of state and head of government, followed by the Vice President and the Council of Ministers. The president is elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms and is limited to a maximum of two such terms (increased from one in 2005). At the provincial level executive power is vested in department governors, municipal mayors and local administrators for smaller administrative subdivisions, such as corregimientos or comunas. Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title V - Concerning the organization of the state - Chapter 1 - Concerning the structure of the state - Article 115) All regional elections are held one year and five months after the presidential election. [tpl]cite web|url= http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/ayudadetareas/gobierno/gob3a.htm |title= The Government of Colombia|publisher = banrepcultural.org|accessdate = 14 March 2014|language = Spanish[/tpl] Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title VII - Concerning the executive branch) 
The legislative branch of government is represented nationally by the Congress, a bicameral institution comprising a 166-seat Chamber of Representatives and a 102-seat Senate.  Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title V - Concerning the organization of the state - Chapter 1 - Concerning the structure of the state - Article 114)  Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Chapter 4 - Concerning the senate - Article 171) The Senate is elected nationally and the Chamber of Representatives is elected in electoral districts. Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Chapter 5 - Concerning the chamber of representatives - Article 176) Members of both houses are elected to serve four-year terms two months before the president, also by popular vote.  Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title VI - Concerning the legislative branch - Chapter 1 - Concerning its structure and functions - Article 132) 
The judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Court, Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title VII - Concerning the judiciary branch - Chapter 2 - Concerning ordinary jurisdiction  - Article 234) consisting of 23 judges divided into three chambers (Penal, Civil and Agrarian, and Labour). [tpl]cite web|url= http://www.cortesuprema.gov.co/|title= Supreme Court of Colombia|publisher = cortesuprema.gov.co|accessdate = 15 March 2014|language = Spanish[/tpl]  The judicial branch also includes the Council of State, which has special responsibility for administrative law and also provides legal advice to the executive, the Constitutional Court, responsible for assuring the integrity of the Colombian constitution, and the Superior Council of Judicature, responsible for auditing the judicial branch.  Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title VIII - Concerning the judiciary branch) Colombia operates a system of civil law, which since 2005 has been applied through an adversarial system. 
Despite a number of controversies, most notably the ongoing parapolitics scandal, dramatic improvements in security and continued strong economic performance have ensured that former President Uribe remained popular among Colombian people, with his approval rating peaking at 76%, according to a poll in 2009.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.semana.com/politica/articulo/si-no-uribe-santos/103711-3 |title= Si no es Uribe, es Santos|publisher = semana.com |date= 1 June 2009|accessdate=15 March 2014 |author= Ipsos-Napoleon Franco poll|language = Spanish[/tpl] However, having served two terms, he was constitutionally barred from seeking re-election in 2010. In presidential elections held on 30 May 2010 the former Minister of defense Juan Manuel Santos received 46% of the vote. A second round was required since no candidate received over the 50% winning threshold of votes. In the run-off elections on 20 June 2010 against the second most popular candidate, Antanas Mockus who had scored 21%, [tpl]cite web|url= http://elpais.com/diario/2010/05/31/internacional/1275256801_850215.html|title= Santos gana con ventaja el primer asalto |publisher= elpais.com |accessdate= 15 March 2014|language = Spanish[/tpl] Santos was declared the winner. His term as Colombia's president runs for four years beginning 7 August 2010.

===Foreign affairs===

The foreign affairs of Colombia are headed by the President, as head of state, and managed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. [tpl]cite web|url= http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/en/ministry/the_ministry |title= The Ministry of Foreign Affairs|publisher = cancilleria.gov.co|accessdate = 15 March 2014[/tpl] Colombia has diplomatic missions in all continents. 
Colombia was one of the 4 founding members of the Pacific Alliance, which is a political, economic and co-operative integration mechanism that promotes the free circulation of goods, services, capital and persons between the members, as well as a common stock exchange and joint embassies in several countries.[tpl]cite web|url= http://alianzapacifico.net/en/home-eng/the-pacific-alliance-and-its-objectives/ |title= The Pacific Alliance and its Objectives|publisher = alianzapacifico.net|accessdate = 10 February 2014[/tpl] Colombia is also a member of the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the Organization of Ibero-American States, the Union of South American Nations and the Andean Community of Nations.

===Military===

The executive branch of government is responsible for managing the defense of Colombia, with the President commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The Ministry of Defence exercises day-to-day control of the military and the Colombian National Police. Colombia has 449,415 active military personnel. And in 2012 3.3% of the country's GDP went towards military expenditure, placing it 18th in the world. Colombia's armed forces are the largest in Latin America, and it is the second largest spender on its military after Brazil.[tpl]cite web|url= http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS |title= Military expenditure (% of GDP)|publisher = data.worldbank.org|accessdate = 15 December 2013[/tpl]
The Colombian military is divided into three branches: the National Army of Colombia; the Colombian Air Force; and the Colombian Navy. The National Police functions as a gendarmerie, operating independently from the military as the law enforcement agency for the entire country. Each of these operates with their own intelligence apparatus separate from the national intelligence agency (ANIC, in Spanish).

===Administrative divisions===

Colombia is divided into 32 departments and one capital district, which is treated as a department (Bogotá also serves as the capital of the department of Cundinamarca). Departments are subdivided into municipalities, each of which is assigned a municipal seat, and municipalities are in turn subdivided into corregimientos in rural areas and into comunas in urban areas. Each department has a local government with a governor and assembly directly elected to four-year terms, and each municipality is headed by a mayor and council. There is a popularly elected local administrative board in each of the corregimientos or comunas. [tpl]cite web|url= http://www.dane.gov.co/Divipola/|title= Codificación de la División Político-Administrativa de Colombia (Divipola)|language= Spanish|publisher = dane.gov.co|accessdate = 15 March 2014[/tpl]  Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title XI - Concerning the territorial organization)  Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title XI - Concerning the territorial organization - Chapter 3 - Concerning the municipal regime - Article 318)[tpl]cite journal|last= Herrera Llanos|first= W |date= 2011|title= Régimen municipal en Colombia (Continuación del tema sobre Organización Territorial)|publisher= Universidad del Norte|page=27|accessdate= 9 March 2014[/tpl]
In addition to the capital four other cities have been designated districts (in effect special municipalities), on the basis of special distinguishing features. These are Barranquilla, Cartagena, Santa Marta and Buenaventura. Some departments have local administrative subdivisions, where towns have a large concentration of population and municipalities are near each other (for example in Antioquia and Cundinamarca). Where departments have a low population (for example Amazonas, Vaupés and Vichada), special administrative divisions are employed, such as "department corregimientos", which are a hybrid of a municipality and a corregimiento.

==Economy==

Historically an agrarian economy, Colombia urbanised rapidly in the 20th century, by the end of which just 22.7% of the workforce were employed in agriculture, generating just 11.5% of GDP; 18.7% of the workforce were employed in industry and 58.5% in services, responsible for 36% and 52.5% of GDP respectively.
Colombia's market economy grew steadily in the latter part of the 20th century, with gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at an average rate of over 4% per year between 1970 and 1998. The country suffered a recession in 1999 (the first full year of negative growth since the Great Depression), and the recovery from that recession was long and painful. However, in recent years growth has been impressive, reaching 6.9% in 2007, one of the highest rates of growth in Latin America.

==Demographics==

With an estimated 46 million people in 2008, Colombia is the third-most populous country in Latin America, after Brazil and Mexico. It is also home to the second-largest number of Spanish speakers in the world after Mexico. At the beginning of the 20th century, Colombia's population was approximately 4 million."Colombia – Population". Library of Congress Country Studies. The population increased at a rate of 1.9% between 1975 and 2005, predicted to drop to 1.2% over the next decade. Colombia is projected to have a population of 50.7 million by 2015. These trends are reflected in the country's age profile. In 2005 over 30% of the population was under 15 years old, compared to just 5.1% aged 65 and over.
The population is concentrated in the Andean highlands and along the Caribbean coast. The nine eastern lowland departments, comprising about 54% of Colombia's area, have less than 3% of the population and a density of less than one person per square kilometer (two persons per square mile). Traditionally a rural society, movement to urban areas was very heavy in the mid-20th century, and Colombia is now one of the most urbanized countries in Latin America. The urban population increased from 31% of the total in 1938 to 60% in 1975, and by 2005 the figure stood at 72.7%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/colombia/36.htm |title=Colombia: A Country Study |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=16 May 2010[/tpl] The population of Bogotá alone has increased from just over 300,000 in 1938 to approximately 8 million today. In total seventy one cities now have populations of 100,000 or more (2013). As of 2010 Colombia has the world's largest populations of internally displaced persons (IDPs), estimated to be up to 4.3 million people. 
The life expectancy is 75.02 years in 2013 and infant mortality is 15 per thousand in 2012. [tpl]cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|title = Life expectancy at birth |publisher = cia.gov |accessdate= 5 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN|title= Mortality rate, infant (per 1,000 live births)|publisher = data.worldbank.org |accessdate= 5 March 2014[/tpl] In 2011, 93.2% of adults and 97.9% of youth are literate and the government spends about 4.4% of its GDP in education. 
Colombia is ranked third in the world in the Happy Planet Index.

===Languages===

More than 99.2% of Colombians speak the Spanish language, also called Castilian; 65 Amerindian languages, 2 Creole languages and the Romani language are also spoken in the country. English has official status in the San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina Islands.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/antropologia/lengua/clas2.htm |title= Languages of Colombia|publisher = banrepcultural.org|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ambafrance-co.org/Jon-Landaburu-Especialista-de-las |title= Jon Landaburu, Especialista de las lenguas de Colombia|publisher = ambafrance-co.org|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.lenguasdecolombia.gov.co/mapalenguas/inicio.swf |title= Map of the languages of Colombia|publisher = lenguasdecolombia.gov.co|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 October 2013[/tpl]
The overwhelming majority of Colombians speak Spanish (see also Colombian Spanish), but in total 101 languages are listed for Colombia in the Ethnologue database. The specific number of spoken languages varies slightly since some authors consider as different languages what others consider are varieties or dialects of the same language, the best estimates recorded that 70 languages are spoken in the country today. Most of these belong to the Chibchan, Arawak, Cariban,  language families. There are currently about 850,000 speakers of native languages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/CO|title=The Languages of Colombia |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=16 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.lenguasdecolombia.gov.co/content/ley-de-lenguas-nativas |title= Native languages of Colombia|publisher = lenguasdecolombia.gov.co|language = Spanish|accessdate= 25 March 2014[/tpl]

===Ethnic groups===

The descendants of the original native inhabitants, Spanish colonists, African people originally brought to the country as slaves and 20th-century immigrants from Europe and the Middle East have produced a diverse cultural heritage in Colombia.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.pedagogica.edu.co/storage/ps/articulos/pedysab15_09arti.pdf |title= The ethnic and cultural diversity of Colombia |publisher= pedagogica.edu.co |language = Spanish|accessdate= 26 March 2014[/tpl] The demographic distribution reflects a pattern is influenced by colonial history. Whites tend to live mainly in urban centers, particularly in Bogotá and the burgeoning highland cities. The populations of the major cities also include mestizos. Mestizo campesinos (people living in rural areas) also live in the Andean highlands where some Spanish conquerors mixed with the women of Amerindian chiefdoms. Mestizos include artisans and small tradesmen that have played a major part in the urban expansion of recent decades.Bushnell & Hudson, pp. 87–88.
According to the 2005 census, 49% of Colombia's population is Mestizo or of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry. Approximately 37% is of European ancestry (predominantly Spanish, and a part of Italian, French, and German). About 10.6% is of African ancestry. Indigenous Amerindians comprise 3.4% of the population. The 2005 census reported that the "non-ethnic population", consisting of whites and mestizos (those of mixed white European and Amerindian ancestry), constituted 86% of the national population.
Many of the Indigenous peoples experienced a reduction in population during the Spanish rule [tpl]cite web| url= http://www.colombia.com/colombiainfo/nuestrahistoria/esclavista.asp |publisher= colombia.com |title= Society and slavery|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 September 2013[/tpl] and many others were absorbed into the mestizo population, but the remainder currently represents over eighty distinct cultures.

==Culture==

Colombia lies at the crossroads of Latin America and the broader American continent, and as such has been hit by a wide range of cultural influences. Native American, Spanish and other European, African, American, Caribbean, and Middle Eastern influences, as well as other Latin American cultural influences, are all present in Colombia's modern culture. Urban migration, industrialization, globalization, and other political, social and economic changes have also left an impression.
Many national symbols, both objects and themes, have arisen from Colombia's diverse cultural traditions and aim to represent what Colombia, and the Colombian people, have in common. Cultural expressions in Colombia are promoted by the government through the Ministry of Culture.

===Literature===

Colombian literature dates back to pre-Columbian era; a notable example of the period is the epic poem known as the Legend of Yurupary. [tpl]cite book|title= Legend of Yurupary|publisher= Cooperativa Editorial Magisterio|isbn= 9789582008369|year=2006|url= http://books.google.com.co/books?id=s_ADFUglHo0C&lpg=PP1&hl=es&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] In Spanish colonial times notable writers include Hernando Domínguez Camargo and his epic poem to San Ignacio de Loyola, Juan Rodríguez Freyle (The Sheep) [tpl]cite web|url= https://sites.google.com/site/cursodeliteraturacolombiana/unidad-2/los-cronistas |title= Cronistas del Nuevo Reino de Granada|publisher= ihlc.udea.edu.co |accessdate= 31 March 2014[/tpl] and the nun Francisca Josefa de Castillo, representative of mysticism.

===Visual arts===

Colombian art has over 3,000 years of history. Colombian artists have captured the country's changing political and cultural backdrop using a range of styles and mediums. There is archeological evidence of ceramics being produced earlier in Colombia than anywhere else in the Americas, dating as early as 3,000 BCE.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.donquijote.org/culture/colombia/art/ |publisher= donquijote.org | title= Colombian Art|accessdate= 22 August 2013[/tpl]
The earliest examples of gold craftsmanship have been attributed to the Tumaco people [tpl]cite web| url= http://www.banrepcultural.org/gold-museum/tumaco |publisher= banrepcultural.org | title= Tumaco: People and Gold on the Pacific Coast|accessdate= 22 August 2013[/tpl] of the Pacific coast and date to around 325 BCE. Roughly between 200 BCE and 800 CE, the San Agustín culture, masters of stonecutting, entered its “classical period".  They erected raised ceremonial centres, sarcophagi, and large stone monoliths depicting anthropomorphic and zoomorphhic forms out of stone.[tpl]cite web| url= http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/744|publisher= unesco.org| title= San Agustín Archaeological Park|accessdate= 22 August 2013[/tpl]
Colombian art has followed the trends of the time, so during the 16th to 18th centuries, Spanish Catholicism had a huge influence on Colombian art, and the popular Baroque style was replaced with Rococo when the Bourbons ascended to the Spanish crown. More recently, Colombian artists Pedro Nel Gómez and Santiago Martínez Delgado started the Colombian Murial Movement in the 1940s, featuring the neoclassical features of Art Deco.
Since the 1950s, the Colombian art started to have a distinctive point of view, reinventing traditional elements under the concepts of the 20th century. Examples of this are the Greiff portraits by Ignacio Gomez Jaramillo, showing what the Colombian art could do with the new techniques applied to typical Colombian themes. Carlos Correa, with his paradigmathic “Naturaleza muerta en silencio” (silent dead nature), combines geometrical abstraction and cubism. Alejandro Obregón is often considered as the father of modern Colombian painting, and one of the most influential artist in this period, due to his originality, the painting of Colombian landscapes with symbolic and expressionist use of  animals, (specially the andean condor). Fernando Botero and  Omar Rayo are probably the most widely known Colombian artists in the international scene.

The Colombian sculpture from the sixteenth to 18th centuries was mostly devoted to religious depictions of ecclesiastic art, strongly influenced by the Spanish schools of sacred sculpture. During the early period of the Colombian republic, the national artists  were focused in the production of sculptural portraits of politicians and public figures, in a plain neoclassicist trend. During the 20th century, the Colombian sculpture began to develop a bold and innovative work with the aim of reaching a better understanding of national sensitivity.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.colombia.com/cultura/resenas/escultura.asp |title= Colombian sculptors|publisher = colombia.com|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 October 2013[/tpl]

==Education==

The educational experience of many Colombian children begins with attendance at a preschool academy until age five (Educación preescolar). Basic education (Educación básica) is compulsory by law. Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title II - Concerning rights, guarantees, and duties - Chapter 2 - Concerning social, economic and cultural rights - Article 67) It has two stages: Primary basic education (Educación básica primaria) which goes from first to fifth grade – children from six to ten years old, and Secondary basic education (Educación básica secundaria), which goes from sixth to ninth grade. Basic education is followed by Middle vocational education (Educación media vocacional) that comprises the tenth and eleventh grades. It may have different vocational training modalities or specialties (academic, technical, business, and so on.) according to the curriculum adopted by each school.
After the successful completion of all the basic and middle education years, a high-school diploma is awarded. The high-school graduate is known as a  bachiller, because secondary basic school and middle education are traditionally considered together as a unit called bachillerato (sixth to eleventh grade). Students in their final year of middle education take the ICFES test (now renamed Saber 11) in order to gain access to higher education (Educación superior).  This higher education includes undergraduate professional studies, technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies. Technical profesionnal institutions of Higher Education are also opened to students  holder of a qualification in Arts and Business. This qualification is usually awarded by the SENA after a two years curriculum.Vocational Education in Colombia, UNESCO-UNEVOC
Bachilleres (high-school graduates) may enter into a professional undergraduate career program offered by a university; these programs last up to five years (or less for technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies), even as much to six to seven years for some careers, such as medicine. In Colombia, there is not an institution such as college; students go directly into a career program at a university or any other educational institution to obtain a professional, technical or technological title. Once graduated from the university, people are granted a (professional, technical or technological) diploma and licensed (if required) to practice the career they have chosen. For some professional career programs, students are required to take the Saber-Pro test, in their final year of undergraduate academic education.
