The dong units occupy the area of the city center, which was formerly occupied by Gyeongju-eup.  Eup refers to a substantial village, whereas the myeon are more rural. The current divisions are as follows, using the numbers given on the map:

Oedong-eup (No.10) is linked by road and rail to the neighboring metropolis of Ulsan.    Thanks to this, it has been a center of the development of Gyeongju's automotive parts industry.   Three industrial complexes are located here.[tpl]ref|oedong1[/tpl]  Roughly 18,300 people live in Oedong-eup.[tpl]ref|oedong2[/tpl]  This population is served by six elementary schools, a middle school, and a high school.[tpl]ref|oedong3[/tpl]

Hyeongok-myeon (No.3) played a significant role in the history of Chondogyo, a Korean religion.  Choe Je-u, the founder of Chondogyo, used Gumi Mountain  as the base for his missionary activities in the early 1860s. The Gumi Mountain area is now part of Gyeongju National Park. Two elementary schools and a high school are located in Hyeongok-myeon, serving a population of 11,500.
