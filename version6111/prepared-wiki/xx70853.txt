[[Earl Grey tea]]

CATEGORIES: Blended tea, English beverages

Earl Grey tea is a tea blend with a distinctive citrus flavour and aroma derived from the addition of oil extracted from the rind of the bergamot orange, a fragrant citrus fruit.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4883068.stm|first=Ben |last=Richardson |title=Bergamot growers get whiff of success|date=6 April 2006|publisher=BBC News[/tpl]
Traditionally, the term "Earl Grey" has applied only to black teas that contain oil of bergamot as a flavouring.

==History==

Tea flavoured with bergamot to imitate the more expensive types of Chinese tea has been known in England at least since the 1820s. In 1837 there is a record of court proceedings against Brocksop & Co. who were found to have supplied tea "artificially scented, and, drugged with bergamot in this country", but there is no known published reference to an 'Earl Grey' tea before advertisements by Charlton & Co. of Jermyn Street in London in the 1880s, though 'Grey's Tea' is known from the 1850s [tpl]cite web|title=Foods of England|url=http://www.foodsofengland.co.uk/earlgreytea.htm|accessdate=1 January 2013[/tpl]
The Earl Grey blend, or "Earl Grey's Mixture", is assumed to be named after Charles Grey, the second Earl Grey, British Prime Minister in the 1830s and author of the Reform Bill of 1832. He reputedly received a gift, probably a diplomatic perquisite, of tea flavoured with bergamot oil.Kramer, Ione. All the Tea in China. China Books, 1990. ISBN 0-8351-2194-1. Pages 180-181. Bergamot orange (Citrus bergamia) is a small citrus tree which blossoms during the winter and is grown commercially in Calabria, Italy.[tpl]cite news|publisher=The Irish Times|date=30 September 2002|title=Have your cuppa, but go easy on the Earl Grey|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2002/0930/1033174037304.html|first=Muiris |last=Houston|quote=...Bergamot contains the psoralen derivatives bergapten and bergamottin. The adverse effects of bergamot oil in this patient are explained by the action of bergapten as a potassium channel blocker within muscle cells. By interrupting the normal flow of potassium, the cells become hyperexcitable, leading to the visible movements and cramps within the muscles. By drinking four litres a day of Earl Grey (equivalent to at least 16 cups of tea), the Austrian man was simply overdosing on essence of bergamot.[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?10698 | work = Germplasm Resources Information Network | title = Citrus bergamia Risso & Poit.

According to one legend, a grateful Chinese mandarin whose son was rescued from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men first presented the blend to the Earl in 1803. The tale appears to be apocryphal, as Lord Grey never set foot in China[tpl]cite book |author=Pettigrew, Jane |title=The Tea Companion: A Connoisseur's Guide (Connoisseur's Guides) |publisher=Running Press Book Publishers |location=Philadelphia, Pa |year=2004 |isbn=0-7624-2150-9[/tpl] and the use of bergamot oil to scent tea was then unknown in China.  However, this tale is subsequently told (and slightly corrected) as on the Twinings website, as "having been presented by an envoy on his return from China".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.twiningsusashop.com/earl-grey.html |title=Earl Grey |publisher=Twiningsusashop.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07[/tpl]
Jacksons of Piccadilly claim they originated Earl Grey's Tea, Lord Grey having given the recipe to Robert Jackson & Co. partner George Charlton in 1830. According to Jacksons, the original recipe has been in constant production and has never left their hands. Theirs has been based on China tea since the beginning.[tpl]cite news|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=24 July 2008|url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20080723-150279/More-than-just-a-pot-of-tea|title=More Than Just A Pot Of Tea|first=Micky |last=Fenix|quote=Stephen Twining traced back his family's business to the 1700s, when coffee houses as meeting places were the vogue.

To this day the formula—which mixes black China tea with other unknown teas—has remained unaltered.[/tpl]
According to the Grey family, the tea was specially blended by a Chinese mandarin for Lord Grey, to suit the water at Howick Hall, the family seat in Northumberland, using bergamot in particular to offset the preponderance of lime in the local water. Lady Grey used it to entertain in London as a political hostess, and it proved so popular that she was asked if it could be sold to others, which is how Twinings came to market it as a brand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.howickhallgardens.org/earlgreyteahouse.php |title=Howick Hall website |publisher=Howickhallgardens.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-28[/tpl]

===Use as a flavouring===

Earl Grey tea is used as a flavouring for many types of cakes and confectionery, such as chocolates, as well as savoury sauces.[tpl]Cite book |last=Joachim |first=David |year=2001 |title=Brilliant Food Tips and Cooking Tricks: 5,000 Ingenious Kitchen Hints, Secrets, Shortcuts, and Solutions |publisher=Rodale |isbn=978-1-57954-301-3 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=H6Jt42PIqQQC |page=502|quote=Earl Grey shallot sauce.[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Why tea is the new spice rack must-have |last=Miller |first=Norman |date=11 April 2009 |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/article6072842.ece[/tpl] For sauces, the flavour is normally created by adding tea bags to the basic stock, boiling for a few minutes and then discarding the bags. For sweet recipes, loose tea is often added to melted butter or hot cream and strained after the flavour is infused.[tpl]Cite book |last=Boyle |first=Tish |year=2002 |title=The good cookie: over 250 delicious recipes from simple to sublime |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-38791-6 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=H1MZ08dB4LUC |page=124 |quote=Chocolate dipped Earl Grey shortbread wedges.[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/99891436.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+16%2C+2002&author=Edward+Schneider&pub=The+Washington+Post&edition=&startpage=F.01&desc=Cooking+With+Tea%3B+%22As+for+pears%2C+I+poached+them+in+Earl+Grey%2C+a+tea+with+impeccable+prime+ministerial+credentials.%22|title=Cooking With Tea; "As for pears, I poached them in Earl Grey, a tea with impeccable prime ministerial credentials."|last=Schneider|first=Edward|date=16 January 2002|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=13 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Earl Grey tea cream and Eccles cakes|first=Marcus |last=Wareing|date=7 March 2008 |accessdate=13 November 2009 |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/database/earlgreyteacreamande_86363.shtml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080307064429/http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/database/earlgreyteacreamande_86363.shtml |archivedate=2008-03-07[/tpl]
There is a considerable history of Earl Grey tea being used as a drink mixer, in particular for gin, within the British Isles, somewhat similar in principle to the 'Irish Coffee', though this is seldom practiced today. During the later 19th century, poorer working class households began to combine the drinks as a minimum proof alcohol volume began to be meaningfully applied, following a 1855 revision to the Weights and Measures Act, to the relatively inexpensive spirit, making it unpalatable when taken neat.Owen Ruffhead, ed. (1763). Statutes at Large 1. p. 388. Retrieved 22 March 2014. Being somewhat similarly flavoured, the two made for an affordable and pleasant pairing, in addition to which the necessary boiling during preparation helped disarm water-borne contaminants. The drink became associated briefly in the inter-war period with middle-class - particularly, female - alcoholism during the interwar years of the 20th century; it would occasionally be referred to during this time as a 'Moseley Tea Service', after the bourgeois area of Birmingham.Robert M. Fogelson (1763). Bourgeois Nightmares: Suburbia, 1870-1930. p. 135. Retrieved 22 March 2014. 

==Toxicology==

In several studies, application of high concentrations of some brands of bergamot oil directly to the skin was shown to increase redness after exposure to ultraviolet light;[tpl]cite pmid|428611[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid|17669618[/tpl] however, this should not apply to ordinary oral consumption of Earl Grey tea.  Bergamot is a source of bergamottin which, along with the chemically related compound 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin, is known to be responsible for the grapefruit juice effect in which the consumption of the juice affects the metabolism of a variety of pharmaceutical drugs.[tpl]cite pmid|9723817[/tpl]
In one case study, a patient who consumed four litres of Earl Grey tea per day reported muscle cramps, which were attributed to the function of the bergapten in bergamot oil as a potassium channel blocker.  The symptoms subsided upon reducing his consumption of Earl Grey tea to one litre per day.[tpl]cite pmid|11988248 [/tpl]

The character Jean-Luc Picard of Star Trek: The Next Generation was known to request "Tea: Earl Grey, hot." aboard the ship on many occasions.
