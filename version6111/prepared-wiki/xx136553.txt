[[Patellar plexus]]

CATEGORIES: Nerves of the lower limb and lower torso, Nerve plexus

The terminal filaments of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve frequently communicate with the anterior cutaneous branches of the femoral nerve, and with the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve, forming with them the patellar plexus (also called the peripatellar plexus).
