WEAS-FM is a mainstream urban radio station licensed to Springfield, Georgia, but serving the Savannah Area. The station is owned by Cumulus Media. 
WEAS(FM) began operation in 1968 as an easy listening station to counter the country music format of the sister AM station (which had formerly been WJIV, with an R&B format, until 1960, and later as WEAS with the country format); the station's format was freeform progressive rock in the early part of the next decade. By the mid 1970s, the FM station switched to a similar urban format as today, as did the sister AM station, prior to it being sold and changed to a sports information station.  The AM and FM stations were previously owned by E.D. "Dee" Rivers, Jr, son of a former governor of Georgia.
WEAS-FM was previously licensed to Savannah, but moved to Springfield in order to allow WTYB to move to Tybee Island, in the Savannah metropolitan area. The station has historically targeted the African-American population in the Savannah area.
WEAS-FM was automated in its first few years, but changed to a live DJ when the format was changed from Easy Listening to R&B.
