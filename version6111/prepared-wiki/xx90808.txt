Michael Buffer (born November 2, 1944) is an American ring announcer for boxing and professional wrestling matches. He is known for his trademarked catchphrase, "Let's get ready to rumble!" and for pioneering a distinct announcing style in which he rolls certain letters and adds other inflections to a fighter's name. His half-brother is UFC announcer Bruce Buffer.

==Early life==

Buffer was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to an enlisted man in the United States Navy and his wife during World War II.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/9812/two.htm |title=Article Two – December 1998 |publisher=Boxing Monthly |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011[/tpl] His parents divorced when he was 11 months of age, and Buffer was then raised by foster parents, a school bus driver and housewife, in the Philadelphia suburb of Roslyn.[tpl]cite journal|last=O'Brien |first=Richard|title=Let's Get Ready to… |journal=Sports Illustrated|volume=76 |date=June 1992|pages=72–78.[/tpl] He enlisted in the United States Army during the Vietnam War at age 20 and served until age 23.

==Career==

===Boxing===

In 1982, Buffer began his career as a ring announcer. By 1983, he was announcing all boxing matches promoted by Bob Arum's Top Rank on ESPN, which gave him a national identity at a time when ring announcers were strictly locally hired talent.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] By 1984, Buffer developed the catchphrase "Let's get ready to rumble" in his announcing, which gained enormous popularity. He began the process of obtaining a federal trademark for the phrase in the 1980s, which he acquired in 1992. 
By the late 1980s, Buffer was the exclusive ring announcer for all bouts in Donald Trump-owned casinos. Trump said of Buffer, "He's great, he's the choice, he has a unique ability... I told my people, 'We got to have him.'" Buffer's work was also admired by many of the boxing greats. Sugar Ray Leonard once said, "When Buffer introduces a fighter, it makes him want to fight."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.internationalspeakers.com/speakers/ISBB-553JXN/Michael_Buffer |title=Michael Buffer – iSB Keynote Speakers and Entertainment |publisher=Internationalspeakers.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011[/tpl]
Buffer's fame has reunited him with long-lost family members. In 1989, Buffer was contacted by his birth-father after having seen him on television, who introduced him to his half-brothers.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] In the mid-1990s, Buffer brought on one of his half-brothers, Bruce Buffer, as his agent/manager. This grew into a business partnership to increase licensing productivity of the trademark.
Michael Buffer is currently the announcer for all HBO and RTL (Germany) boxing matches, along with Versus matches promoted by Top Rank.[tpl]cite web|url=http://imdb.com/name/nm0119354 |title=Michael Buffer |publisher=IMDb |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011[/tpl]

===Wrestling===

Buffer was formerly the exclusive ring announcer for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) main events featuring Hulk Hogan or other top WCW talent until 2001, when the organization folded.[tpl]cite web|url=http://imdb.com/name/nm0119354 |title=Michael Buffer |publisher=IMDb |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011[/tpl] The WCW's former parent company Time Warner owned through their pay-per-view subscription division HBO, which broadcast many matches from promoter Top Rank, of which Buffer is the lead ring announcer. The exclusivity of his contract with WCW prevented Buffer from announcing for other wrestling-type organizations, forcing him to stop announcing for the UFC (his only UFC cards were UFC 6 and UFC 7). However, when WCW ceased to exist, and Time Warner had no more affiliation with professional wrestling, Buffer was enabled to announce in other wrestling promotions. WWE wrestler Triple H created the phrase "Let's get ready to suck it!" as part of his D-Generation X act to mock Buffer while he was on WWF Raw's rival show WCW Monday Nitro during the Monday Night Wars.
On the August 18, 2007 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, for the first time in more than six years, Buffer returned to pro-wrestling ring announcing duties at Madison Square Garden in a boxing match between pro boxer Evander Holyfield (who was substituting for Montel Vontavious Porter) and pro wrestler Matt Hardy. Buffer appears in the Royal Rumble 2008 commercial, in which he begins to say "Let's get ready to rumble!" only to be superkicked by Shawn Michaels, causing him to fall over. As well as being in the commercial for the event, he was the guest ring announcer during the Royal Rumble match itself.
