==History==

The construction of the airport began in 1916 and was completed in 1917. Its operation as Lübeck Airbase started after the completion.  At the end of the First World War the airbase was shut down. In 1933, it re-opened and extended. During the Berlin Blockade the Royal Air Force flew coal to Berlin and refugees to West Germany using DC-3 Dakota aircraft.  
After the re-unification of Germany, the airport started to grow heavily. More and more airlines started flying from Lübeck-Blankensee. In 1997, the arrival terminal was re-constructed and extended. Ryanair started to operate from the airport in 2000 with the first flights to London-Stansted.  Ryanair's route system extended over the years until 2009. Wizz Air started operations in 2006 with flights to Gdańsk and later other eastern European destinations. Discussions about Ryanair opening a base at the airport have been held since 2009 without results. In 2010, both the financial crisis and the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull led to a general decrease in passenger numbers and destinations.
