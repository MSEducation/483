Thyrocopa apatela, (common names: Grasshopper Moth,http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2008/f/zt01830p062.pdf University of California, Berkeley and Haleakala flightless mothhttp://www.hear.org/starr/hiinsects/images/thumbnails/html/thyrocopa_apatela.htm Thyrocopa apatela, Haleakala flightless moth,(Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae)), is a species of brachypterous (flightless) moth from Maui. Hawaii.http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2008/f/zt01830p062.pdf A new species of flightless, jumping, alpine moth of the genus Thyrocopa from Hawaii
This species appears to be undergoing severe range reduction. Although it was found as low as 1,524 meters in the 1970s, recent collecting indicates it is now restricted to areas above 2,900 meters. This may be the result of the range expansion of introduced ants on Haleakala.
The length of the forewings is 8–11 mm. Adults are on wing from May to August. It is largely diurnal, though they occasionally come to light. Adults are mostly collected while hopping between sunny rocks. 
The larva is likely a generalist, feeding on Dubautia and other plant species found in the alpine scrub of Haleakala’s high elevation areas. Larvae have also been found feeding on wind-blown debris under small rocks.
