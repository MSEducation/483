Nicolas Carone (June 4, 1917 â€“ July 15, 2010) belonged to the early generation of New York School Abstract Expressionist artists whose artistic innovation by the 1950s had been recognized across the Atlantic, including Paris. New York School Abstract Expressionism, represented by Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline,    Conrad Marca-Relli and others became a leading art movement of the postwar era.
