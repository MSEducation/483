==Recording==

After Damon Dash began listening to The Black Keys, who he says became his favorite band, he reached out to the musicians to meet in person. Dash suggested that they enter the studio with Jim Jones, with whom Dash recently partnered to form Splash Records.[tpl]cite web|last=Langhorne |first=Cyrus |url=http://www.sohh.com/2009/05/jim_jones_talks_dipsets_h.html |title=Jim Jones Announces DJ Webstar Duet Deal, "I Got A Lot Of Music On the Airwaves'" [Video |publisher=Sohh.Com |date=2009-05-27 |accessdate=2010-12-12[/tpl] While recording with co-producer Joel Hamilton at Studio G,[tpl]cite web|url=http://theblackkeysfanlounge.com/2009/11/blakroc-interview-with-joel-hamilton-blakroc-co-producer-engineer/ |title=Blakroc: Interview with Joel Hamilton â€“ Blakroc Co-Producer / Engineer |publisher=The Black Keys Fan Lounge |date=2009-12-02 |accessdate=2010-12-12[/tpl] Mos Def interrupted the session, and ended up recording with them as well. With new artists being called in to work on the album, it was completed after eleven weeks recording. Included in the project are vocals from deceased rapper and former Roc-A-Fella Records artist Ol' Dirty Bastard, tapes which were signed over to his brief Roc4Life venture under Def Jam with the intention of an eventual album release. In order to release Blakroc, Dash has formed an independent record label in conjunction with the band. The first single for the album, "Ain't Nothing Like You (Hoochie Coo)", features a singing duet between The Black Keys' guitarist Dan Auerbach and Mos Def, with rap verses from Jim Jones; it was released on September 14, 2009.

===Blakroc 2===

In early September 2011, a trailer surfaced for Blakroc 2, the second album from Blakroc, the collaborative hip-hop project from the Black Keys and Damon Dash,http://www.prefixmag.com/news/the-black-keys-patrick-carney-says-blakroc-2-isnt-/56780/ however, later that month in an interview with Atlanta radio station 92.9 Dave FM, Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney said, "BlakRoc 2 is not coming out soon... there are no plans for that."http://www.donewaiting.com/2011/09/26/videothe-black-keys-have-no-current-plans-to-release-blakroc-2/
Carney said that the trailer is actually an unauthorized video that was pieced together about two years ago. They recorded "about eight songs" two years ago, but the album was never completed. A publicist has confirmed that there is no release date set for Blakroc 2. The trailer was posted on the YouTube channel of Damon Dash's DD172 media collective.http://pitchfork.com/news/44120-the-black-keys-second-hip-hop-album-blakroc-2-is-not-actually-happening/

==Reception==

===Critical response===

The album was generally received well by critics. The album reached Number 1 and Number 7 on the US Billboard Heatseakers chart and US Billboard Top Rap Albums respectively. Nick Neyland of BBC music stated in his review "this is a surprisingly compelling and welcome rejoining of the rap and rock worlds that successfully captures the off-the-cuff nature of the recording sessions."[tpl]cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13747-blakroc/ |title=Album Reviews: BlakRoc: Blakroc |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2009-12-01 |accessdate=2010-12-12[/tpl]
