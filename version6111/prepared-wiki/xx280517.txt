==History==

===Formation===

The Cascade Conference was formed in 1954 with eight schools from the Jackson County Conference. The original members were: Brooklyn, Concord, East Jackson, Grass Lake, Jackson Vandercook Lake, Michigan Center, Napoleon, Parma, and Springport high schools.

===Red and Blue===

With the growth of suburbs, some Cascade Conference schools grew more rapidly than others. This led to the creation of the Red and Blue divisions. Between 1983 and 1996, four schools were listed as Cascade-Red Members: Jackson Lumen Christi, Jackson Northwest, Parma Jackson County Western and Brooklyn Columbia Central. In 1996, Jackson Northwest and Jackson Lumen Christi left the Cascade Red for the Capital-Circuit Conference.[tpl]cite web|url=http://michigan-football.com/f/jcksonnw.htm |title=Jackson Northwest Mounties All-Time Michigan High School Football Scores |publisher=Michigan-football.com |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] Brooklyn Columbia Central left the Cascade Red after 1995 and competed as an independent for two years, before joining the Lenawee County Conference at the start of the 1997 school year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://michigan-football.com/f/columctl.htm |title=Brooklyn Columbia Central Golden Eagles All-Time Michigan High School Football Scores |publisher=Michigan-football.com |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] Parma Jackson County Western left the Cascade Red after the 1995 school year and joined the Twin Valley Conference.[tpl]cite web|url=http://michigan-football.com/f/parmajcw.htm |title=Parma Jackson County Western Panthers All-Time Michigan High School Football Scores |publisher=Michigan-football.com |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl]
