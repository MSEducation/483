George Kent Shuler (December 15, 1884 - October 16, 1942) was an American war hero and politician.

==Life==

He lived at Lyons, in Wayne County, New York. He married Blanche Stewart and they had two daughters.
He fought in World War I as a member of the United States Marine Corps, and finished the war as a captain, and was later promoted to major. He received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.
He ran for Congress in New York's 36th congressional district in 1920, but was defeated by Norman J. Gould.
As a captain, he had the distinction of commanding the small (four or five Marine) detachment that was dispatched by Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall to evict a drilling rig crew belonging to the Mutual Oil Company from the Teapot Dome oil field in Natrona County, Wyoming on July 30, 1922, and thus precipitating one of the major sources of scandal during the administration of President Warren G. Harding. (The eviction preceded without incident; the officials of the company even fed lunch to Captain Schuler and the men of his detachment  after drilling operations had ceased.) (pages 81-83, Teapot Dome, Morris R. Werner and Starr, John, Viking Press, 1959)
He was New York State Treasurer from 1923 to 1924, elected in 1922 but defeated for re-election in 1924 by Republican Lewis H. Pounds. He was a delegate to the 1924 Democratic National Convention.
