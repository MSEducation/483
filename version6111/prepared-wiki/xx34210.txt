[tpl]nihongo|Wario|ワリオ[/tpl] is a fictional character in Nintendo's Mario series who was designed as an antagonist to Mario. He first appeared in the 1992 Game Boy title Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins as the main antagonist and final boss. He was portrayed as an exaggerated version of Mario and his name is a variant of "Mario".  Wario was first designed by Hiroji Kiyotake, and is voiced by Charles Martinet, who also voices many other characters in the series.
Since his debut, Wario has become the protagonist and antihero of the Wario Land and WarioWare series, spanning handheld and console markets. In addition to appearances in spin-offs in the Mario series, he appears in cameos for Densetsu no Stafy 3 and Pilotwings 64. He has also been featured in other media such as the Super Mario Adventures graphic novel. The character has received a largely positive critical reception and has emerged as a well-established mascot for Nintendo. 

==Concept and creation==

A rival to Mario, Wario first appeared in the 1985 game Wrecking Crew in the character of Spike, a construction foreman.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kombo.com/article.php?artid=10570 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080603115614/http://www.kombo.com/article.php?artid=10570 |archivedate=June 3, 2008 |title=The History of Wario: Part 1|first=David|last=Oxford|publisher=Kombo |date=February 1, 2008 |accessdate=May 8, 2010[/tpl] Although he bears a slight resemblance to Spike, Wario did not debut until 1992. The first named appearance of the character occurred in the game Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins. He was designed by game artist Hiroji Kiyotake.[tpl]cite web |url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/100/1007864p4.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Game Boy |first=Travis|last=Fahs|publisher=IGN |date=July 27, 2009 |accessdate=August 8, 2009[/tpl] Wario's design arose from Super Mario Land's design team's distaste of making a game based around someone else's character. The creation of Wario allowed them a character of their own to "symbolize their situation".
Wario is portrayed as an exaggerated version of Mario; he has huge, muscular arms, a large moustache, and a bellicose cackle.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/360/360686p1.html |title=E3 2002: Hands on Wario World |author=IGN Staff|publisher=IGN |date=May 23, 2002|accessdate = August 29, 2011[/tpl] The name "Wario" is a portmanteau of "Mario" with the Japanese adjective [tpl]Nihongo|warui|悪い[/tpl] meaning "bad"; hence, a "bad Mario" (further symbolized by the "W" on his hat, an upside down "M").[tpl]cite web|url=http://stars.ign.com/objects/924/924285_biography.html |title=IGN: Wario Biography |publisher=IGN |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=June 12, 2010[/tpl] Voice actor Charles Martinet, who has voiced Mario since 1995, is also the voice for Wario. During the audition for the part, Martinet was told to speak in a mean and gruff-sounding tone. He described voicing Wario as a looser task than voicing Mario, since Mario's speaking manner and personality are more free-flowing, rising from the ground and floating into the air, while one of Wario's cornerstones is self-pity.[tpl]cite web |title=Charles Martinet Celebrates 15 Years of Wario with Kombo |first=David|last=Oxford|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100509085022/http://wii.kombo.com/article.php?artid=12729|archivedate=May 9, 2010|url=http://wii.kombo.com/article.php?artid=12729 |publisher=Kombo |accessdate=October 1, 2009 |date=September 15, 2008[/tpl] Starting with Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, Wario experiences rejuvenating effects from garlic in a similar manner as Mario is powered up by mushrooms. Wario often uses bombs, as in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 and Wario Blast. The WarioWare series prominently uses bombs as a visual motif to represent the time limit.
In video games in which Wario makes a cameo appearance, he is often portrayed as a villain. However, the development team for Wario Land: Shake It! stated that he was not really a villain, and they did not consider him one during development. They focused on his behavior, which alternates between good and evil.[tpl]cite web |title=Wario Land Interview |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/914/914577p1.html |author=IGN Staff|publisher=IGN |accessdate=September 6, 2009 |date=September 30, 2008[/tpl] Etsunobu Ebisu, a producer of The Shake Dimension, considered Wario to be a reckless character, who uses his strength to overwhelm others. Tadanori Tsukawaki, the design director of The Shake Dimension, described Wario as manly, and said he was "so uncool that he ends up being extremely cool". Because of this, he wanted Wario to act macho rather than silly and requested that the art designers emphasize his masculinity.[tpl]cite web |title=Drawing Wario: The animation of Wario Land |url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/News/2008/Drawing-Wario-The-animation-of-Wario-Land-250334.html |publisher=Nintendo of UK |date=September 18, 2008|accessdate=September 6, 2009[/tpl] Wario was chosen as the star of the WarioWare series because the developers felt he was the best character for the franchise because he often acted stupid.[tpl]cite web |title=Nintendo R&D1 Interview with the WarioWare team |url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/ncl_nintendo_wwiv_apr06_p1.asp |publisher=Kikizo|date=April 7, 2006|accessdate=September 6, 2009[/tpl]

==Appearances==

===Wario Land series===

Wario made his first appearance as a villain in the 1992 Game Boy video game Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, in which he captured Mario's castle. He also served as a villain in the 1993 Japan-only puzzle game Mario & Wario, in which he drops a bucket on the head of Mario, Princess Peach, or Yoshi.[tpl]cite web|title=Mario and Wario for SNES|publisher=GameSpot|url=http://www.gamespot.com/snes/puzzle/mariotowario/index.html|accessdate=June 30, 2009[/tpl] This was followed by the first game in the Wario Land series, Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 (1994), a platform game which marked Wario's first appearance as a protagonist and introduced his first villains, Captain Syrup and her Brown Sugar Pirates.[tpl]cite web |title=The Chronicles of Wario: A Retrospect |url=http://www.gamezone.com/editorials/i-u-the-chronicles-of-wario-a-retrospect-i-u |publisher=GameZone |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |date=February 15, 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/gameboy/wario_land_super_mario_land_3|publisher=Nintendo Life|first=Corbie|last=Dillard|date=February 17, 2012|accessdate=October 1, 2009[/tpl] His next adventure, 1995's Virtual Boy Wario Land, plays similarly and incorporates the ability to move in and out of the background. A sequel for the Game Boy title, Wario Land II, was released in 1998; it featured Captain Syrup's  return as the antagonist. This game also introduces Wario's invulnerability, allowing him to be burnt or flattened without sustaining damage. In 2000 Wario Land 3 was released to the Game Boy Color as another sequel; it used the same mechanics and concepts of its predecessor. The following year, the sequel Wario Land 4 debuted on the Game Boy Advance, incorporating Wario's ability to become burnt or flattened and reintroducing the ability to become damaged from standard attacks. In 2004, Wario World, the first console Wario platforming title, was released for the Nintendo GameCube; it featured three-dimensional graphics and gameplay and did not incorporate any major elements from previous platforming titles. Wario: Master of Disguise was released for the Nintendo DS in the 2007. The game introduced touch screen control of Wario and incorporated puzzles into the gameplay.[tpl]cite web |title=Wario: Master of Disguise Review |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/769/769918p1.html |publisher=IGN |first=Craig |last=Harris |accessdate=October 1, 2009 |date=March 2, 2007[/tpl] The series' most recent release, Wario Land: Shake It!, was released for the Wii in 2008 and reintroduced Captain Syrup. The game uses a hand-drawn animation style, and Wario's design required more than 2,000 frames of animation.

===WarioWare series===

In 2003, the Wario franchise introduced a new series of games, the first of which was WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames! for the Game Boy Advance. The game's premise involved Wario's decision to open a game development company to make money, creating short "microgames" instead of full-fledged games. The title's gameplay focused on playing a collection of microgames in quick succession. Mega Microgames! was later remade as WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Party Games! for the GameCube; it featured the same microgames but lacked a story mode and focused more on multi-player. In 2004, two sequels were released for the game. The first was the Game Boy Advance title WarioWare: Twisted!, which used the cartridge's a tilt sensor to allows microgames to be controlled by tilting the handheld left and right.[tpl]cite web|title=WarioWare: Twisted!

==Promotion and reception==

Since his appearance in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, Wario has become a well-established mascot for Nintendo,[tpl]cite web|last=Thomas |first=Lucas M. |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/101/1012415p1.html |title=The DSi Virtual Console Wishlist – DS Feature at IGN |publisher=IGN |date=August 17, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2010[/tpl] and he has received a largely positive reception.

They also listed his mustache as one of the best in Nintendo games.[tpl]cite book |title=Nintendo Power 250th issue! |year=2010 |publisher=Future US |location=South San Francisco, California |pages=46, 47[/tpl] Computer and Video Games found the levity of Wario's games "liberating" compared to big Nintendo franchises such as Mario and The Legend of Zelda. They also mention that, regarding the character, they "empathise more with the hopelessly materialistic Wario than goody brown-shoes Mario. Deep down, we'd all rather chase pounds over princesses."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/281076/features/time-machine-wario/ |title=Time Machine: Wario |work=Computer and Video Games |date=December 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2011[/tpl] IGN editor Travis Fahs comments that while Wario is not the most likeable character, his strong confidence overshadows his flaws and makes him entertaining.[tpl]cite web|last=Fahs |first=Travis |url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/894/894013p1.html |title=Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 Retro Review – Game Boy Review at IGN |publisher=IGN |date=July 25, 2008 |accessdate=June 12, 2010[/tpl] The website later ranked Wario 31st in a list of the "Top 100 Videogame Villains".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/videogame-villains/31.html |title=Wario is number 31 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=February 24, 2011[/tpl]  In the book A Parent's Guide to Nintendo Games: A Comprehensive Look at the Systems and the Games, Craig Wessel described Wario as a "sinister twist" on Mario.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bc8TAQAAIAAJ |title=A Parent's Guide to Nintendo Games: A Comprehensive Look at the Systems and the Games |publisher=Mars Publications |first=Craig|last=Wessel|year=2001 |accessdate=June 12, 2010[/tpl] In Icons of Horror and the Supernatural: An Encyclopedia of Our Worst Nightmares, Volume 1, S.
