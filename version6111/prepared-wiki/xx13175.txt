[[31]]

CATEGORIES: 31

Year 31 (XXXI) was a common year starting on Monday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Augustus and Seianus (or, less frequently, year 784 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 31 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
