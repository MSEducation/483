In the old part of the village, there were no roads (nowadays there is a cycling path), and all transport was done by water over one of the many canals. The lakes in Giethoorn were formed by peat unearthing.
Giethoorn was founded by fugitives from the Mediterranean region in around AD 1230.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zwaantje.nl/uk.giethoorn.html|title=Foundation of Giethoorn|accessdate= 2008-06-20[/tpl] Giethoorn was a separate municipality until 1973, when it became part of Brederwiede.[tpl]Repertorium Nederlandse Gemeenten[/tpl]
