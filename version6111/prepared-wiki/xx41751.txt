Russian Ark ([tpl]lang-ru|link=no|Русский ковчег[/tpl], Russkij Kovcheg) is a 2002 historical drama film directed by Alexander Sokurov. It was filmed entirely in the Winter Palace of the Russian State Hermitage Museum using a single 96-minute Steadicam sequence shot. The film was entered into the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3157774/year/2002.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Russian Ark |accessdate=25 October 2009|work=festival-cannes.com[/tpl]
An unnamed narrator wanders through the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. The narrator implies that he died in some horrible accident and is a ghost drifting through the palace. In each room, he encounters various real and fictional people from various periods in the city's 300-year history. He is accompanied by "the European", who represents the Marquis de Custine, a nineteenth-century French traveler. Russian Ark uses the fourth wall device extensively, but repeatedly broken and re-erected. At times the narrator and the companion interact with the other performers, while at other times they pass unnoticed.

==Plot==

On a winter's day, a small party of men and women arrive by horse-drawn carriage to a manor, side entrance of the Winter Palace. The narrator (whose point of view is always in first-person) meets another spectral but visible outsider, "the European", and follows him through numerous rooms of the palace. Each room manifests a different period of Russian history, but the periods are not in chronological order.
Featured are Peter the Great harassing one of his generals; a spectacular presentation of operas and plays in the era of Catherine the Great; an imperial audience in which Tsar Nicholas I is offered a formal apology by the Shah of Iran for the death of Alexander Griboedov, an ambassador; the idyllic family life of Tsar Nicholas II's children; the ceremonial changing of the Palace Guard; the museum's director whispering the need to make repairs during the rule of Joseph Stalin; and a desperate Leningrader making his own coffin during the 900-day siege of the city during World War II.
A grand ball follows, featuring music by Mikhail Glinka, with many of the participants in spectacular period costume, and a full orchestra conducted by Valery Gergiev, then a long final exit with a crowd down the grand staircase.
The narrator then leaves the building through a side exit and sees an endless ocean, but does not look back or see the building, which can be interpreted as an ark preserving Russian culture as it floats in the sea of time.

==Cast==

==Production==

The film displays 33 rooms of the museum, which are filled with a cast of over 2,000 actors and 3 orchestras. Russian Ark was recorded in uncompressed high definition video using a Sony HDW-F900. The information was not recorded compressed to tape as usual, but uncompressed onto a hard disk which could hold 100 minutes which was carried behind the cameraman as he traveled from room to room, scene to scene. Three attempts were made to complete the shot; the first two had to be interrupted owing to technical faults, but the third (and final chance to complete the shot owing to time constraints) was completed successfully.  Tilman Büttner, the director of photography and Steadicam operator, executed the shot on 23 December 2001.
In a 2002 interview, Büttner said that film sound was recorded separately. "Every time I did the take, or someone else made a mistake, I would curse, and that would have gotten in, so we did the sound later."[tpl]cite web | work=indieWIRE | title=Interview: Achieving the Cinematic Impossible | url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/interview_achieving_the_cinematic_impossible_russian_ark_dp_tilman_buttner_/ | accessdate=13 October 2011[/tpl] Lighting directors of photography on the film were Bernd Fischer and Anatoli Radionov.[tpl]cite web | work=Russiky kovcheg | title=Full Cast and Crew for Russiky kovcheg | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318034/fullcredits#cast | accessdate=1 August 2008[/tpl] The director later drew a distinction between the whole project and the achievements of Büttner by rejecting[tpl]cite web | work=The Island of Sokurov | title=To the European Film Awards | url=http://www.sokurov.spb.ru/island_en/ans_1.html | accessdate=1 August 2008[/tpl] Büttner's nomination for a European Film Academy award, believing that only the whole film should gain an award.

==Postproduction==

In postproduction the uncompressed HD 87-minute one-shot could be reworked in detail: besides many object removals, compositings, selective colour-corrections and digitally added focus changes, the whole film was continuously and dynamically reframed and for certain moments even timewarped. Most of this was executed on discreet logic's inferno system and leaving the picture uncompressed before being reprinted onto filmstock for theatrical distribution.

==Background==

The narrator's guide, "the European", is based on the Marquis de Custine, who visited Russia in 1839 and wrote a  book about his visit, La Russie en 1839. A few biographical elements from Custine's life are shown in the film.  Like the European, the Marquis' mother was friends with the Italian sculptor Canova and he himself was very religious. Custine's book mocks Russian civilization as a thin veneer of Europe on an Asiatic soul. Echoing this sentiment, the film's European comments that Russia is a theater and that the people he meets are actors. The Marquis' family fortune came from a porcelain works, hence the European's interest in the Sèvres porcelain waiting for the diplomatic reception. At the end of the film, which depicts the last imperial ball in 1913, the European appears to accept Russia as a European nation.
In One Breath, a documentary about the making of Russian Ark, written and directed by Knut Elstermann, gives more insight into the single long shot tracking techniques and formidable organisation behind the making of the film.

===Critical reviews===

Russian Ark received high critical acclaim. Roger Ebert wrote, "Apart from anything else, this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen.... The effect of the unbroken flow of images (experimented with in the past by directors like Hitchcock and Max Ophüls) is uncanny. If cinema is sometimes dreamlike, then every edit is an awakening. Russian Ark spins a daydream made of centuries."[tpl]cite web | work=Sun Times | title=Russian Ark | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030131/REVIEWS/301310304/1023 | accessdate=1 August 2008[/tpl]
