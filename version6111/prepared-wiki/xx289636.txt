==Description==

Viburnum australe grows as a deciduous, multi-stemmed shrub, reaching [tpl]convert|1|–|3|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl] in height.Donoghue, M.J. 1997. Viburnum. A flora of the Chihuahuan Desert region; M.D. Johnston (ed.) privately published., accessed 08.13.2013.

==Distribution and habitat==

Viburnum australe is native to the Sierra Madre Oriental in the Mexican states of Coahuila and Nuevo Léon. It also occurs in the United States in the Davis Mountains of Texas. V. australe inhabits mesic pine-oak forests above [tpl]convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl].Muller, C. H. (1939). Relations of the vegetation and climatic types in Nuevo Leon, Mexico.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

The generic name originated in Latin, where it referred to V. lantana.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zIOvJSJs-IkC |first=Umberto |last=Quattrocchi |title=CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names: Common Names, Scientific Names, Eponyms, Synonyms, and Etymology |volume=IV R-Z |year=2000 |publisher=Taylor & Francis US |isbn=978-0-8493-2678-3 |page=2793[/tpl] The specific epithet australe is derived from Latin australis, meaning "southern" (c.f. Australia).
Viburnum australe was described as a separate species by Conrad Vernon Morton in 1933, from a specimen collected in 1906 by Cyrus Guernsey Pringle. Subsequent taxonomists subsumed V. australe into Viburnum affine C.K.Schneid., which is itself considered a midwestern variety of Viburnum rafinesqueanum Schult.Estes, D. (2010). Viburnum bracteatum (Adoxaceae) expanded to include Viburnum ozarkense. Castanea, 75(2), 277-293., doi:10.2179/08-062.1. However, recent molecular phylogenetic work has revealed that V. australe is actually more closely related to V. ellipticum, from the Pacific Coast Ranges of the western United States, than it is to V. rafinesqueanum.Clement, W. L., & Donoghue, M. J. (2012). Barcoding success as a function of phylogenetic relatedness in Viburnum, a clade of woody angiosperms. BMC Evolutionary Biology, 12(1), 73., doi:10.1186/1471-2148-12-73. V. australe would therefore be considered a distinct species under the phylogenetic species concept.
Viburnum australe and V. ellipticum are closely related to three species from eastern North America: V. rafinesqueanum, V. molle, and the endangered V. bracteatum. These species, known as clade Mollodontotinus, are in turn more distantly related to the arrowwood species complex and its Neotropical relatives in clade Oreinodontotinus.Clement, W. L., & Donoghue, M. J. (2011). Dissolution of Viburnum section Megalotinus (Adoxaceae) of Southeast Asia and its implications for morphological evolution and biogeography.

==Conservation==

Viburnum australe is considered to be a rare species in the United States, where it is known from a single locality near the town of Madera Springs, Texas.Powell, A. M. (1998). Trees and shrubs of the Trans-Pecos and adjacent areas. University of Texas Press., page 386.
Like other species in clades Mollodontotinus and Oreinodontotinus, Viburnum australe is vulnerable to Pyrrhalta viburni, an invasive Eurasian leaf beetle. North American Viburnum, which did not coevolve with P. viburni, lack the physiological defenses that allow its Eurasian relatives to fend off beetle infestations, and have therefore been decimated in areas where P. viburni has become established.Desurmont, G. A., Donoghue, M. J., Clement, W. L., & Agrawal, A. A. (2011). Evolutionary history predicts plant defense against an invasive pest.
