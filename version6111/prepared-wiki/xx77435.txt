The Christian Heritage Party of Canada, also referred to as CHP Canada,http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=pol&document=index&dir=par&lang=e&textonly=false#CHP is a federal political party that advocates that Canada be governed according to Biblical principles. It believes "the purpose of civil government is to ensure security, freedom, and justice for all its citizens from conception till natural death, by upholding just laws".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chp.ca/en/policy/principles.html |title=Christian Heritage Party of Canada Guiding Principles |publisher=Chp.ca |date=January 18, 2013 |accessdate=March 14, 2013[/tpl]
This socially and fiscally conservative party held its founding convention in Hamilton, Ontario in November 1987, where Ed Vanwoudenberg was elected its first leader.  Jim Hnatiuk led the party from 2008 to early 2014, and David J. Reimer is the interim leader as of 1 February 2014.Paul Freston. Protestant political parties: a global survey  (2004) p 56
The party nominated candidates for the first time in the 1988 federal election, and ran numerous candidates in the 1993 and 1997 elections. It was unable to field 50 candidates in the 2000 election and was consequently de-registered by Elections Canada, the government elections agency. The party was re-registered in time for the 2004 election.
Many of its founders had been members of the Social Credit movement. The party hopes to "apply proven Judeo-Christian principles of justice and compassion to Canada's contemporary public policy needs".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chp.ca/en/party/about.html |title=About the CHP |publisher=Chp.ca |date=January 18, 2013 |accessdate=March 14, 2013[/tpl] The party claims that it seeks to represent all Canadians, and specifically denies any interest in converting all Canadians to Christianity. As of the 2011 election, the party has yet to obtain a seat in the House of Commons.

==Platform==

The Christian Heritage Party seeks to avoid a narrow platform, but rather implements the policy that "civil government is to ensure freedom and justice for a nation's citizens by upholding law and order in accordance with Biblical principles."
