The Oxford University Invariant Society, or 'The Invariants',  is a university society open to members of Oxford University, dedicated to promotion of interest in mathematics.Invariants Society Constitution, http://www.invariants.org.uk/constitution The society regularly hosts talks from prominent British mathematicianshttp://www.sciencecentral.com/site/501035 such as G. H. Hardy on wide ranging topics from the mathematics of juggling to the history of mathematics.http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Higman.html Biography of Graham Higmanhttp://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/about/history/ Oxford Maths Institute: History of Mathematics Many prominent British mathematicians were members of the society during their time at the University of Oxford.[tpl]cite book | authorlink = Donald J.

==History==

The Society was founded in 1936 by J. H. C. Whitehead, Graham Higmanhttp://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Higman.html Biography of Graham Higman and Jack de Wet.[tpl]cite journal |last=Wilson |first=Robin |title=Invariant Society 75th anniversary |journal=Oxford Mathematical Institute Newsletter |date=Spring 2011[/tpl] The name of the society was chosen at random by Higman from the titles of the books; in this case, Oswald Veblen's Invariants of Quadratic Differential Forms. The opening lecture was G. H. Hardy on Round Numbers.The Early History of the Invariant Society by Robin Wilson, printed in The Invariant (2010), Ben HoskinProfessor Graham Higman's Obituary in The Daily Telegraph
Though many members joined the forces during the war, meetings continued, including lectures by Douglas Hartree and H. A. Newman, as well as debates - 'Is Mathematics an end in itself?' - and mathematical films.The Early History of the Invariant Society by Robin Wilson, printed in The Invariant (2010), Ben Hoskin
