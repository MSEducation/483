The Nashville Songwriters Association International is a 501(c) not-for-profit trade organization that works to help songwriters in three ways: through legislative advocacy, through education and advice about the actual craft of songwriting, and through teaching about the music industry, and how to best position a song for success within it. They own the Bluebird Cafe.
The association was founded in the 1970s, with former singer-songwriter Lorene Mann as a co-founder.http://www.musicrow.com/2013/05/hit-singer-songwriter-lorene-mann-passes/
