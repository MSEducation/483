==History==

Wichita North High School was the second high school in the city of Wichita, completed in 1929.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
Due to the high school being located by a river, North is one of the few high schools in the United States that teaches canoeing. During the spring, the students hold an annual water festival called Waterfest which is held right before Wichita's annual Riverfest and it  includes floats from the various student organizations. Unique landmarks in close proximity to North are Mead Island and the Minisa Bridge.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
Increases in enrollment at North necessitated a number of additions to the building:  an auto mechanics shop (1950), girl's gymnasium (1951), and, in the fall of 1957 the three-story extension on the south wing. By 1972, thirteen annexes were in use. In 1975, North was allocated 1.7 million dollars from a bond issue. The funds were used to add a library, classrooms, provide extensive renovations to science classrooms, offices, and the woodworking room, add an extension to the small gymnasium, improve both the boys and girls physical education. dressing rooms and shower areas, and a number of other projects in rooms adjacent to the new or remodeled facilities. The improvements and/or additions made it possible to remove all but three annex buildings.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
Acquisition of land across from the school in 1977, 1980, and 1982 enabled the school district to provide ample student parking. Several senior classes have donated funds each year to be used to purchase a marquee sign for the student parking lot. The marquee is used to highlight student activities and provide recognition for worthy accomplishments of students. During the summer of 1988, the cafeteria was relocated to the first floor and classrooms were constructed in the former cafeteria. The change was made to make additional classrooms available to accommodate ninth grade students who started high school as a part of the restructuring plan.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
Since about 1977, the senior boys would participate in a rowdy school spirit club known as the "S" Section. The "S" Section is known for making obscure cheers and rants during North High's sporting events and pep rallies. Each member would have a red and white long sleeve t-shirt with the words "North High 'S' Section" on the front. The back would be the member's nickname as well as their graduation year. These would typically be worn by the members on days that pep rallies occurred.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
One of the famous pranks of North High students is to attempt to steal "Butch." "Butch" is a buffalo head that is mounted in the main hallway across from the administrative offices. This has been thwarted due to elaborate anti-theft alarms on the mascot. Although a prank with harmless intent, students who have attempted to kidnap "Butch" have been prosecuted.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
