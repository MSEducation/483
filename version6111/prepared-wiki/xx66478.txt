[[Truncated icosidodecahedron]]

CATEGORIES: Uniform polyhedra, Archimedean solids, Zonohedra

In geometry, the truncated icosidodecahedron is an Archimedean solid, one of thirteen convex isogonal nonprismatic solids constructed by two or more types of regular polygon faces.
It has 30 square faces, 20 regular hexagonal faces, 12 regular decagonal faces, 120 vertices and 180 edges – more than any other nonprismatic uniform polyhedron. Since each of its faces has point symmetry (equivalently, 180° rotational symmetry), the truncated icosidodecahedron is a zonohedron.

==Other names==

Alternate interchangeable names include: 
The name truncated icosidodecahedron, originally given by Johannes Kepler, is somewhat misleading. If one truncates an icosidodecahedron by cutting the corners off, one does not get this uniform figure: instead of squares the truncation has golden rectangles. However, the resulting figure is topologically equivalent to this and can always be deformed until the faces are regular.
The alternative name great rhombicosidodecahedron (as well as rhombitruncated icosidodecahedron) refers to the fact that the 30 square faces lie in the same planes as the 30 faces of the rhombic triacontahedron which is dual to the icosidodecahedron. Compare to small rhombicosidodecahedron.
One unfortunate point of confusion is that there is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron of the same name. See nonconvex great rhombicosidodecahedron.

===Variations===

Within Icosahedral symmetry there are unlimited geometric variations of the truncated icosidodecahedron with isogonal faces. The truncated dodecahedron, rhombicosidodecahedron, and truncated icosahedron as degenerate limiting cases.

==Area and volume==

The surface area A and the volume V of the truncated icosidodecahedron of edge length a are:
If a set of all 13 Archimedean solids were constructed with all edge lengths equal, the truncated icosidodecahedron would be the largest.

==Cartesian coordinates==

Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a truncated icosidodecahedron with edge length 2τ − 2, centered at the origin, are all the even permutations of:[tpl]mathworld|title=Icosahedral group|urlname=IcosahedralGroup[/tpl]
where τ = (1 + √5)/2 is the golden ratio.

==Orthogonal projections==

The truncated icosidodecahedron has seven special orthogonal projections, centered on a vertex, on three types of edges, and three types of faces: square, hexagonal and decagonal. The last two correspond to the A2 and H2 Coxeter planes.

==Spherical tiling==

The truncated icosidodecahedron can also be represented as a spherical tiling, and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection. This projection is conformal, preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.

==Related polyhedra and tilings==

This polyhedron can be considered a member of a sequence of uniform patterns with vertex figure (4.6.2p) and Coxeter-Dynkin diagram [tpl]CDD|node_1|p|node_1|3|node_1[/tpl].  For p < 6, the members of the sequence are omnitruncated polyhedra (zonohedrons), shown below as spherical tilings. For p > 6, they are tilings of the hyperbolic plane, starting with the truncated triheptagonal tiling.
