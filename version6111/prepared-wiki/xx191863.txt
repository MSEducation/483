==Career==

===2004–2009===

Shortly before her drama school graduation, Chastain attended a showcase for final-year students in Los Angeles, and was promptly signed to a holding deal by television producer John Wells.[tpl]cite web|first=Guy |last=Adams|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/red-hot-how-jessica-chastain-became-hollywoods-most-wanted-2372840.html|title=Red hot: How Jessica Chastain became Hollywood's most wanted |work=The Independent|date=22 October 2011|accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl] She relocated to California, took up residence in Venice Beach, and started auditioning for jobs, and was discovered by talent agent Hylda Queally.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/hylda-queally-268517|title=Hylda Queally|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=7 January 2014[/tpl] Facing early difficulty in even getting auditions for roles, she recalled that "being a redhead and not having very conventionally modern looks, it was confusing for people and they didn't know exactly where to put me."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/03/jessica-chastain-looks_n_2402496.html|title=Jessica Chastain: I Don't Look 'Modern' |work=The Huffington Post|date=1 March 2011|accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl] In her television debut, The WB network's pilot remake of the 1960s gothic soap opera Dark Shadows, she portrayed Carolyn Stoddard, who was originated by Nancy Barrett.[tpl]cite web|first=Drew |last=Taylor|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/interview-mama-star-jessica-chastain-talks-the-appeal-of-horror-movies-how-crystal-castles-inspired-her-and-whether-ghosts-or-the-oscars-are-scarier-20130119|title=Jessica Chastain Reveals How Crystal Castles Inspired Her 'Mama' Role, Says She Wants To Be A Bond Villain|work=IndieWire|date=19 January 2013|accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl] Directed by P. J. Hogan, the pilot did not live up to the network's expectations and the series was eventually not picked up for broadcast. Chastain later appeared in a guest stint on the medical drama series ER, which marked a professional watershed as she subsequently found a niche playing eccentric characters in television. "I did a job on ER as a psychotic woman, and after that got a lot of jobs in TV where I wasn't the normal one," she later said. "I played a lot of girls who had something off. Maybe they'd been the victim of some horrible accident. Or they were crazy."
From 2004 to 2006, she also appeared in television series such as Veronica Mars, Close to Home, and Law & Order: Trial By Jury. While working at Playwrights Horizons, she was recommended by her director to Al Pacino, who was looking for an unknown actress to star in his new production of Salome and hired her on the spot. The success of the play at Wadsworth Theatre, which sold out after getting positive reviews, helped bring her to the attention of several casting directors.
In 2008, she made her film debut as the title role in Dan Ireland's drama film Jolene which was based on the short story Jolene: A Life by E. L. Doctorow, itself inspired by Dolly Parton's song "Jolene", and follows her life over the course of ten years, as an abused 15-year-old foster child up until her life as a 25-year-old woman.[tpl]cite web|last=White|first=Armond|title=Dolly Did It First|url=http://www.nypress.com/article-21797-dolly-did-it-first.html|publisher=The New York Press|accessdate=January 17, 2013|date=October 27, 2010[/tpl] While the drama received mixed reviews, Chastain was generally praised for her performance, with New York Observer noting that she "not only holds her own corner of every scene, she's the only thing you want to watch."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.observer.com/2010/culture/jolene-was-worth-wait-two-year-old-film-finally-gets-spotlight | title = Jolene Was Worth the Wait: A Two-Year-Old Film Finally Gets the Spotlight| work =New York Observer | date = 27 October 2010| first = Rex |last=Reed [/tpl] It was later released in the United States on October 29, 2010 and Chastain won the Seattle International Film Festival Award for Best Actress.

The actresses worked together before shooting started, creating a consistent voice and mannerisms for their character, while Chastain also took classes in krav maga and German, and studied books about Josef Mengele and Mossad history to prepare herself for the film. Premiering at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival in September 2010, the film was released on August 31, 2011 and Chastain received positive reviews from critics and viewers.
