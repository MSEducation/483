==Natural minor scale==

The natural minor scale follows the sequence of steps:
In semitones, this is
If the white keys on the piano are played beginning on the sixth step of the C major scale, which is A, to the A an octave above, then a natural minor scale is produced. In this case the minor scale is called A minor, and this minor scale has no accidentals (sharps or flats). A minor is called the relative minor of C. Every major key has a relative minor, which starts on the sixth scale degree or step.
The natural minor scale can also be represented by the notation:
Each degree of the scale, starting with the tonic (the first, lowest note of the scale), is represented by a number. Their difference from the major scale is shown. Thus a number without a sharp or flat represents a major (or perfect) interval. A number with a flat represents a minor interval, and a number with a sharp (though there are none in this example) represents an augmented interval. In this example, the numbers mean: 1=unison, 2=major second, [tpl]music|b[/tpl]3=minor third, 4=perfect fourth, 5=perfect fifth, [tpl]music|b[/tpl]6=minor sixth, [tpl]music|b[/tpl]7=minor seventh, 8=octave. So, the natural minor scale consists of: 1, the tonic, followed by 2, a note a major second above the tonic, [tpl]music|b[/tpl]3, a note a minor third above the tonic, and so forth, up to 8, a note an octave above the tonic.
In rock and popular music examples of songs in Minor leys include The Moody Blues' "Nights in White Satin", Blondie's "Call Me", and Spinal Tap's "Lick My Love Pump".Stephenson, Ken (2002). What to Listen for in Rock: A Stylistic Analysis, p.39. ISBN 978-0-300-09239-4.
