==Overview==

Vassar was founded as a women's college in 1861 and became coeducational in 1969.[tpl]cite web|url=http://admissions.vassar.edu/about_first_1_4.html|title=Vassar Firsts|accessdate=2006-05-19[/tpl]
Vassar was the second of the Seven Sisters colleges, higher education schools then strictly for women, and historically sister institutions to the Ivy League. It was chartered by its namesake, brewer Matthew Vassar, in 1861 in the Hudson Valley, about 70 mi (115 km) north of New York City.  The first person appointed to the Vassar faculty was the astronomer Maria Mitchell, in 1865.
Vassar adopted coeducation in 1969. However, immediately following World War II, Vassar accepted a very small number of male students on the G.I. Bill. Because Vassar's charter prohibited male matriculants, the graduates were given diplomas via the University of the State of New York. These were reissued under the Vassar title after the school formally became co-educational.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aavc.vassar.edu/vq/articles/vassar_vets|title=Vassar's Vets: Forgotten Grads|accessdate=2007-08-11[/tpl] The formal decision to become co-ed came after its trustees declined an offer to merge with Yale University, its sibling institution, in the wave of mergers between the historically all-male colleges of the Ivy League and their Seven Sisters counterparts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/coeducation/the-vassar-yale-study.html|title=The Vassar-Yale Study|accessdate=2011-10-10[/tpl]
Vassar's campus, also an arboretum,[tpl]cite web|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/people/profiles/archives/0408profile.asp|title=Frances Daley Fergusson: Creating a campus that inspires|accessdate=2007-08-11[/tpl] is [tpl]convert|1000|acre|ha[/tpl] marked by period and modern buildings. The renovated library has unusually large holdings for a college of its size. It includes special collections of Ellen Swallow Richards, Albert Einstein, Mary McCarthy, and Elizabeth Bishop.
In its early years, Vassar was associated with the social elite of the Protestant establishment. E. Digby Baltzell writes that "upper-class WASP families educated their children at colleges such as Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and Vassar."[tpl]cite book|title=Judgment and Sensibility: Religion and Stratification|first=E.

Roughly 2,400 students attend Vassar, and 98% live on campus. About 60% come from public high schools, and 40% come from private schools (both independent and religious). Vassar is currently 57% women and 43% men, at national average for national liberal arts colleges.[tpl]cite web|url=http://admissions.vassar.edu/applyprospective_faq.html#ratio |title=Prospective Students FAQ |accessdate=2012-10-31[/tpl]  Students are taught by more than 290 faculty members, virtually all holding the doctorate degree or its equivalent. The student-faculty ratio is 8:1, average class size, 17.
In recent freshman classes, students of color comprised 25–33% of matriculants. International students from over 50 countries comprise 10% of the student body.  In May 2007, falling in with its commitment to diverse and equitable education, Vassar returned to a need-blind admissions policy wherein students are admitted by their academic and personal qualities, without regard to financial status.
Vassar president Frances D. Fergusson served for two decades. She retired in the spring of 2006, and was succeeded by Catharine Bond Hill, former provost at Williams College.
