[[Image:Ellora-caves-1.jpg|left|thumb|Wall carvings in Ellora Caves- A scene depicting Kalyanasundara -
the wedding of Shiva (four armed figure, right) and Parvati (two armed, left).]]
Parvati is depicted as interested in Shiva's tales and appearance from her very birth and eventually remembering her previous life as Sati. As Parvati grows into a young woman, she begins tapas (austerities) to please Shiva to grant her wish to reunite with him. She is portrayed as surpassing all other ascetics in austerity, undergoing severe mortifications and fasting. Finally, Shiva tests her devotion by appearing himself in disguise to criticize Shiva. Untouched by the act, Parvati retains her desire for Shiva, compelling him to marry her. After the marriage, Parvati moves to Mount Kailash, the residence of Shiva.Kinsley p.43
Kalidasa's epic Kumarasambhavam ("Birth of Kumara") details with matchlessly lyrical beauty the story of the maiden Parvati: her devotions aimed at gaining the favor of Shiva, the subsequent annihilation of Kamadeva, the consequent fall of the universe into barren lifelessness, the subsequent marriage of Parvati and Shiva, the birth of Kumara, and the eventual resurrection of Kamadeva after Parvati intercedes for him to Shiva.

==Main forms of Parvati==

As per devi bhagwata Purana, Goddess Parvati is lineal progenitor of all other goddesses. She is one who is source of all forms of goddesses. She is worshiped as one with many forms and name. Her different mood brings different forms or incarnation.

===Several Incarnations of the Goddess===

And many othersDevi Bhagwat Purana, tantra Chudamani, Lalita Sahsaranaam

==Association with Shiva==

Parvati's legends are intrinsically related to Shiva. In the goddess-oriented Shakta texts, that she is said to transcend even Shiva, and is identified as the Supreme Being. Just as Shiva is at once the presiding deity of destruction and regeneration, the couple jointly symbolise at once both the power of renunciation and asceticism and the blessings of marital felicity.
Parvati thus symbolises many different virtues esteemed by Hindu tradition: fertility, marital felicity, devotion to the spouse, asceticism, and power. Parvati represents the householder ideal in the perennial tension in Hinduism in the household ideal and the ascetic ideal, rethumb|Shiva and Parvati, Indiapresented by Shiva.Kinsley p.46 In classical Hindu mythology, the "raison d’être" of Parvati, and before that of Sati, is to lure Shiva into marriage and thus into a wider circle of worldly affairs.Kinsley p.35
Parvati tames Shiva, the "great unpredictable madman" with her presence. When Shiva does his violent, destructive Tandava dance, Parvati is described as calming him or complementing his violence by slow, creative steps of her own Lasya dance.Kinsley p.48 In many myths, Parvati is not as much his complement as his rival, tricking, seducing, or luring him away from his ascetic practices.
Three images are central to the mythology, iconography and philosophy of Parvati:
These images that combine the two deities, Shiva and Parvati, yield a vision of reconciliation, interdependence and harmony between the way of the ascetic and that of a householder.Kinsley p.49
The couple are often depicted in the Puranas as engaged in "dalliance" or seated on Mount Kailash or discussing abstract concepts in Hindu theology. Occasionally, they are depicted as quarrelling.Kennedy p.334 In stories of the birth of Kartikeya, the couple are described as love-making generating the seed of Shiva. Parvati's union with Shiva symbolises the union of a male and female in "ecstasy and sexual bliss".Tate, p.383 In art, Parvati is depicted seated on Shiva's knee or standing beside him (together the couple is referred to as Uma-Maheshvara or Hara-Gauri) or as Annapurna (the goddess of grain) giving alms to Shiva.Coleman p.65
Shaiva approaches tend to look upon Parvati primarily as the Shiva's submissive and obedient wife and helpmate. However, Shaktas focus on Parvati's equality or even superiority to her consort. The story of the birth of the ten Mahavidyas (Wisdom Goddesses) of Shakta Tantrism. This event occurs while Shiva is living with Parvati in her father's house. Following an argument, he attempts to walk out on her. Her rage manifests in the form of ten terrifying goddesses who block Shiva's every exit.
As the scholar David Kinsley explains,
Aum Girijayai cha vidmahe Shivapriyayai cha dhimahi tanno durgah prachodayat
May the goddess Durga, who is the daughter of the mountains and the beloved of lord Shiva illumine me with spiritual wisdom
Sarvamangala mangalye shive sarvardha sadhike sharanye tryambake gouri narayani namostute
I bow down to and take the refuge of the three eyed Mother Gouri(Parvati) of fair countenance,who is the embodiment of supreme auspiciousness,the giver of all the benedictions,the beloved of Lord Shiva and the power of lord Narayana.

==Relationship to Vishnu==

During the initial stages when Parvathi was performing intense puja to Shiva to obtain Shiva as her husband, Shiva kept testing her by destroying the Shiva lingam she constructed to perform puja. Vishnu then helped in constructing a Shiva lingam for Parvati which was not destroyed by Shiva because of the respect Shiva had towards Vishnu.Thus Vishnu helped Paravthi in continuing her puja for Shiva. This is when Parvathi tied a knot to Vishnu's hand and claimed him as her brother. This is the reason during the marriage of Shiva and Parvathi, Vishnu got involved in all the ceremonies that are supposed to be done by the bride’s brother. This is how Parvati is related to Vishnu as a sister. The interesting story about the relationship between vishnu and parvati is more clearly depicted in Markandeya Purana where it is said that Mahalakshmi or Durga was the only one. Then she transforms into Mahakali and Mahasarasvati. After which she ask them to evolve pair. Here Mahalakshmi gives rise to brahma and lakshmi, Mahakali evolved Shiv and Saraswati while Mahasarsvati gave rise to Vishnu and parvati. Then Mahalakshmi ordered rest to interchange pairs for marriage and Shiv was provided with parvati, vishnu with lakshmi and brahma with saraswati. Its quite interesting that Mahasarsvati who is godess of education gives birth to parvati and vishnu and both of them in future tells Geeta to Himalaya and Arjun respectively.

==Mother of Ganesha==

Though Ganesh is considered a son of Shiva and Parvati, the Matsya Puran, Shiva Puran and Skand Puran ascribe his birth to Parvati only, without any form of participation of Shiva.
Once while Parvati yearned to take a bath, there were no attendants around to guard her and stop anyone from accidentally entering the house. Hence she created an image of a boy out of turmeric paste which she prepared to cleanse her body, and infused life into it, instructed by her great form, Shakti, and thus Ganesh was born. Parvati was overjoyed that her own son was born and she ordered Ganesh not to allow anyone to enter the house. Ganesh obediently followed his mother's orders. After a while Shiva returned and tried to enter the house, and Ganesh stopped him. Shiva asked the child very politely to move but failed. Lord Shiva assigned his armed men to straighten out the boy, however, the boy wasn't scared of Lord Shiva's men. Ganesh was a proficient warrior and beat them with his beating stick. The Gods, Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu, had watched the ordeal from above, and went to tell they Shiva that his men were beaten by the boy. Shiva told Lord Vishnu and Brahma that a naughty boy has appeared in Kailash. Lord Brahma and Vishnu came up with the idea that they would disguise themselves as saints, and would go discipline the boy. When the disguised saints appeared before Ganesh, he was unaware of Lord Brahma's and Vishnu's hidden identities. The saints tried to set the boy straight, and make him apologize to Shiva but failed. Indra, who was also watching, came down with his huge heavenly army.
Parvati came to know of her son's predicament. In a fit of fury she created two Goddesses, Kali and Gauri. Parvati ordered them to help Ganesh kill the army of Indra. When the army tried to attack Ganesh, Gauri and Kali attacked them first. Kali used her scimitar to behead the soldiers of Indra, while Gauri used her trident to impale them. Meanwhile, Indra fled the battlefield and passed on news to Shiva that Kali and Gauri were aiding Ganesh. Shiva arrived at the battlefield, where Ganesh was standing. Once again Shiva asked the boy to move out of the way, but the boy refused. Ganesh then waged a war. Shiva lost his temper and beheaded Ganesh with his trident.
When Parvati came out and saw her son's lifeless body, she was consumed by anger. She asked Lord Shiva why he killed Ganesh. Lord Shiva tried to make Parvati understand what happened, but she wouldn't listen. She immediately revealed all of her female forms: the eight Mother Goddesses (Brahmani, Vaishnavi, Maheshwari, Kaumari, Varahi, Narasinghi and Chamunda), the ten Great Wisdoms (Kali, Tara, Shodashi, Bhuvaneshwari, Bhairavi, Chinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagla Mukhi, Matangi and Kamala), the nine Durgas (Shailputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skand Mata, Katyayani, Kaal Ratri, Maha Gauri and Siddhidatri), the eighteen Mother Goddesses (Kalika, Chamunda, Bhima, Dhriti, Brahmani, Narasinghini, Narayani, Varahi, Rudrani, Savitri, Chandavigrah, Kaumari, Indrani, Shivadooti, Jaya, Vijaya, Gayatri and Trishi), Jagadamba, Shaambhavi, Ambika, Shivadooti, Bhadrakali, Mahakali, Chandika, Sherawali, Narayani, Shakti, Adi Shakti, Adi Parashakti, Uma, Tripur, Kamakshi, Tulaja Devi, Jambhini, Mohini, Kalika, Mahadevi, Devi, Parameshwari, Maha Shakti, Bhagawati, Jagatmata, Devi Mata, Aparajita, Singhavahini, Vyaghravahini, Bhavani, Yudha Devi, the ten thousand armed Guhya Kalis, the 32 terrible female powers, and the 64 terrible female powers. Many more female warrior forms continued to pour out from Parvati. The female manifestations of Parvati asked for their orders, in front of the Trinity and the huge army of Gods. Seeking retribution for her son's death, Parvati ordered all of her forms to attack the Gods. The Goddesses obeyed their Mother's orders and attacked. They blew storms out of their mouths, burned the Gods alive, beheaded them, decapitated them by eating their skin, ate them alive, scratched them, choked them, impaled them through their chests, drank their blood, broke their bones and their necks, twisted their hands and legs, and swung them away. The Gods were getting slaughtered. All other creatures (humans, animals, etc.) were also destroyed in the crossfire.
Parvati took the form of the Goddess Mahamaya, and began to destroy the universe. She demanded the Trinity of Gods to resurrect her son by sunset or she would destroy all of creation, and all the Gods including the Trinity. The Trinity agreed.
Lord Vishnu, Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva, Indra, Demi Gods and Shiva's men gazed upon the destruction Mahamaya had caused. They found that one creature, an elephant, survived the carnage. Lord Shiva was overjoyed by this discovery. Lord Vishnu cut off elephant's head with his discus, as it would be used to replace the boy's head. Lord Brahma honored the creatures sacrifice and created a new head for the elephant. The elephant's severed head was then attached to Ganesh's body, bringing him back to life.
Mahamaya was busy destroying the universe and her forms killing the Gods to notice her son's resurrection, until she heard a tiny voice: 'Mother?' Goddess Mahamaya knew it was her son, Ganesh. She commanded all of her female forms to cease fighting. Parvati returned to her former self, no longer Mahamaya, and called back all her forms. Shiva showed the Goddess her son and his new head. Upon seeing Ganesh, Parvati was extremely pleased that her son was alive again. Shiva declared that the child be made head of the ghost-followers (Ganas) of Shiva, and worshipped by everyone before beginning any activity. The Gods accepted this condition. Ganesh is identified as a God named after his mother. He is called Umaputra, Parvatisuta, Gaurisuta, meaning son of Parvati and Heramba, "mother's beloved son".Kennedy p.353-4

==Iconography==

Naturally, Parvati’s unique characteristics have become more and more obscured, as she absorbed more and more goddesses into her iconography. Therefore, her depictions have become rather generic today. When shown with Shiva, she carries a blue lotus in full bloom, shows the abhaya mudra (hand gesture of fearlessness) and usually has one of her children on her knee. The only hint of her former occult status is the somewhat languid appearance of her eyes, as one who has recently emerged from deep meditation. Other goddesses are usually shown with large staring eyes as this is considered a mark of beauty. The consorts of the other two Gods of the trinity, Saraswati and Lakshmi, may be depicted alone, but Parvati hasn’t been depicted this way for many centuries.
The goddess is usually represented as a fair and beautiful.Wilkins pp.247
The colour of her vestments is milk-white, the colour of enlightenment and knowledge.  Since white is a combination of all hues it shows that She has all the qualities or Gunas. Since white also depicts huelesness, it indicates that She is devoid of all Gunas.  Hence, She is referred to as Trigunatmika (having the three gunas—Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas)—and at the same time being Nirguna (without any gunas). She has three eyes. Her accoutrements tend to be those of a Rishi (seer). She is also usually depicted with jatamukuta or a crown of matted hair, as Shiva is usually depicted.  She is also shown as having a crescent moon bound in her locks, like Shiva.
Images of Parvati, wearing a sacred thread something not many women are associated with and as this marks the second-birth or dwija it is seems an advanced concept far beyond early pashupatas, and with her hair styled in a top knot like a Rishi (seer) survive into the Chola period (approximately ninth century A.D.). In fact, these two particularities were the only means of distinguishing her statuary from the images of the Goddess Shri of the time.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl]
Her Mudras (symbolic hand gestures) are Kataka—fascination and enchantment, Hirana—the antelope, the powers of nature and the elusive, Tarjani—gesture of menace, and Chandrakal—the moon, a symbol of intelligence.  Kataka must be affected by one of the foremost hands as it is a means of drawing the worshiper closer. Tarjani must be described with the left hand, which symbolises contempt, and usually in the back set of hands. If Parvati is depicted with two hands, then Tarjani and Chandrakal may be dropped but Hirana and Kataka are signature except in very modern representations, where Abhaya (fearlessness), and Varada, (beneficence), are used.

===Mount===

Parvati’s Vahana (animal vehicle), is usually considered to be a Lion nowadays, in her form as Durga, but was probably originally one of the mountain lions native to the Himalayas. It was also, likely, a Lioness, as Parvati’s cult is so exclusively feminine.Myth of One Hindu Religion By Hadwa Dom pp.? Although there is no documentation to support an affiliation between Goddess Parvati and this wondrous, mythic animal, it does seem an appropriate vehicle for an ascetic magical mountain goddess with an exclusively female clergy and following.Bunce, Frederick W. Dictionary of Buddhist and Hindu Iconography, p. 266. India: DK Print World Pvt. Ltd., 1997. ISBN 81-246-0061-9 In certain aspects of Parvati, such as the Mahagouri form of the Navadurga group, her vahana is Shiva's vahana, Nandi, the sacred bull. In markandeypuran, it was depicted that lion represents Dharma (good) while mahishasur as Adharma(Bad). Godess putts her right leg over lions shoulder and left leg over mahishasur's shoulder, it shows she is balancing both and is above and behind good and bad. Historically Lion was first time provided to Durga by Himalaya when she was about to have fight with Mahishasur.

==Association with other goddesses==

In several myths, the presence of a dark, violent side of this otherwise benign Parvati is suggested. When approached by the gods to defeat demons, Parvati morphs back to her true self, shakti, which is pure energy, untamed, unchecked and chaotic. Her wrath crystallizes into a dark, blood thirsty, tangled-hair Goddess with an open mouth and a drooping tongue. This goddess is usually identified as the terrible mahakali or Kali. In Linga Purana, Parvati summons Kali on the request of Shiva, to destroy a female asura (demoness) Daruka. Even after destroying the demoness, Kali's wrath could not be controlled. She ran around the three worlds in her mad, blind fury and creation was endangered. To lower Kali's rage, Shiva appeared as a crying baby in the middle of a battlefield.http://www.siddhashram.org/a20010837.shtml The cries of the baby raised the maternal instinct of Kali who started breast-feeding Shiva and resorted back to her benign form as Parvati.Kennedy p.338 Kali is associated and identified with Parvati as Shiva's consort.Kinsley p.126
In Skanda Purana, Parvati is said to have assumed a form of a warrior-goddess and defeated a demon called Durg who assumes the form of a buffalo. Thereafter, she is by the name Durga.Kinsley p.96 In myths relating to her defeat of demons Sumbha and Nisumbha, Durga emerges from Parvati when Parvati sheds her outer sheath, which takes an identity of its own as a warrior goddess.
Although Parvati is considered to be synonymous with Kali, Durga, Kamakshi, Meenakshi, Gauri and many others in modern day Hinduism, many of these “forms” or incarnations originated from different sects, or traditions, and the distinctions from Parvati are pertinent.Kinsley pp. 4
The Shastras (sanctioned works of religious doctrine) attribute the golden colour of goddess Gauri’s skin and ornaments to the story of Parvati casting off her unwanted dark complexion after Shiva teased her, but the cult of Gauri tells a different story. Gauri is in essence a fertility Goddess, and is venerated as a corn mother which would seem to suggest that she owes her colouring to the hues of ripening grain, for which she is propitiated.The Shaktas: an introductory comparative study Payne A.E. 1933 pp. ??
So whatever be said, Goddess Parvati has two main forms, what actually shaktas says out of which one is Lalita who is Supreme in Srikula family of shaktism and second one is Durga or kali who is supreme in kalikula family.

==Attainment of the name Durga==

Demon Durgasur takes over the three worlds by absorbing the vedas which are the sources of power to the gods by the grace of Lord Brahma. The Gods go to Lord Shiva for help who requests Parvati to kill Durgasur. The reason being, Parvati, the original representation of Adi Shakti, the source of power to the vedas themselves, could palpably be the only recourse to destroy Durgasur even if he had the vedas protecting him. She creates a clone of herself in the form of a damsel messenger known as Kaal Ratri. Parvati orders Kaal Ratri to go to Durgasur to send a message to him asking him to surrender heaven back to the gods. Kaal Ratri tells Durgasur that Parvati had sent her as a messenger and gave him a chance to surrender.Durgasur,furious,orders his soldiers to take her to custody. Kaal Ratri assumes a gigantic size as her annihilative form and vanishes. Back at Kailasa Parvati imbues Kaal Ratri inside her body again and appears in the war field to fight Durgasur. Parvati gives her introduction to Durgasur that she is nature,the primodial power, not any God, man or a demon and after a long battle destroys him.
Since she destroyed the demon durgasur she was henceforth praised by the gods as Durga
This story has been taken from Srimad Devi Bhagavata Mahapurana. There is a general confusion in India regarding Durga being a combination of Parvati,Lakshmi and Sarasvati. But this is false as Durga is a form of Parvati. There has never been an involvement of Lakshmi or Sarasvati regarding Durga unlike those shown in popular mythological television shows.
The exact chapter of how Parvati(without Lakshmi or Sarasvati's involvement) takes the form of Durga is from the 7th book 28th chapter of Devi Bhagavata Mahapurana. The exact word to word translation is found in http://www.greenmesg.org/mantras_slokas/devi_shakambari-shakambari_mahatmyam.php
इति संप्रार्थिता देवी भुवनेशी महेश्वरी ।
अनंताक्षिमयं रूपं दर्शयामास पार्वती ॥३३॥
नीलांजनसमप्रख्यं नीलपद्मायतेक्षणम् ।
सुकर्कशसमोत्तुङ्गवृत्तपीनघनस्तनम् ॥३४॥
Iti Sam-Praarthitaa Devii Bhuvane(a-Ii)shii Mahea-Iishvarii |

Meaning:
33.1: Thus, when the Brahmins Prayed together to the Devi Bhuvaneshi Maheswari, ...
33.2: ... Devi Parvati Manifested Herself in a Divine Form shining with innumerable Eyes,
34.1: Her Color was distinct like the Dark-Blue Collyrium, and Her Eyes were wide like Blue Lotuses,
34.2: Her Breasts were High, Firm and Round.
In this verse the specific use of the word Parvati shows that Durga is but a form of Parvati.
Even later in the Devi Bhagavata Purana 9th book chapter one,Prakriti khanda Lord Narayana describes Durga as one of the 5 forms of Adi Shakti but specifically calls her the mother of Lord Ganesha and wife of Lord Shiva.
Lord Narayana tells Narada "By Her command came out five Forms of Her, either for the purpose of creation or for bestowing Favour and Grace to the Bhaktas (devotees). Durgâ the Mother of Lord Ganesha, comes, as the first, the most auspicious, loved by Lord Shiva. She is Nârâyanî, Visnu Mâyâ, and of the nature of Pûrna Brahmâ (the Supreme Brahmâ). This eternal, all auspicious Devî is the Presiding Deity of all the Devas and is, therefore, worshipped and praised by Brahmâ and the other Devas, Munis, and Manus. This Bhagavatî Durgâ Devî, (when She gets pleased) destroys all the sorrows, pains and troubles of the Bhaktas that have taken Her refuge, and gives them Dharma, everlasting name and fame, all auspicious things and bliss and all the happiness, nay, the Final Liberation! "
