[[Geothermal power in Japan]]

CATEGORIES: Geothermal power in Japan

Japan has favorable sites for geothermal power because of its proximity to the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc. In 2007, Japan had 535.2 MW of installed electric generating capacity, about 5% of the world total.
There are geothermal electric power plants at the following locations:

==History==

In 1966, Matsukawa Geothermal P/P in Iwate Pref., owned by Nihon Heavy Chemical Industory Corp., started the operation by 9.5MW. In 1967, Ohtake Geothermal P/P in Ohita Pref., owned by Kyushu Electric Power launched by 11MW. Following a few decades, Japanese Energy Policy drove the development of Geothermal energy, like a "Subsidy for the Cost of Geothermal Power Plant development" and increased the plant number. In 1996, total generation　reached 500MW. But, in 1979, "Act on the Rational Use of Energy" left the Geothermal energy from "New Energy" category, so, slackened it　up to the present.
In April 2011, Japanese Ministry of the Environment issued a "Study of Potential for the introduction of Renewable Energy" report.http://www.env.go.jp/earth/report/h22-02/full.pdf 平成２１年度　再生可能エネルギー導入ポテンシャル調査(pdf) It has shown total 19.14GW of Japanese geothermal resource potential.伊藤義康、 『分散型エネルギー入門』、講談社、2012年5月20日第1刷、ISBN 9784062577724、p.94-95
