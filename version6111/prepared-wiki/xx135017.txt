==Background==

A criminal called Scrubby has escaped. He was imprisoned for trying to steal the Magic Pendulum - which brings toys to life. Relik, a cuckoo clock, guards the pendulum. Scrubby appears suddenly and steals the pendulum. You, a hero called Inguz, are called on to recover the pendulum before the toys' magical world disappears...

==Gameplay==

You control a hero who has to traverse toyland and shoot evil toys, collect power-ups, and defeat bosses to advance levels. The gameplay is similar to that of the better known Metal Slug series of videogames.

Zeus also made a game for the Commodore Amiga called Risky Woods.
The soundtrack is composed of samples from various film scores, such as Passenger 57 and To Live And Die In LA.
