Xylitol is used as a diabetic sweetener which is roughly as sweet as sucrose with 33% fewer calories. Unlike other natural or synthetic sweeteners, xylitol is actively beneficial for dental health by reducing caries to a third in regular use and helpful to remineralization.[tpl]cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=LM|author2=Odusola, F|author3= Mandel, ID|title=Remineralizing potential, antiplaque and antigingivitis effects of xylitol and sorbitol sweetened chewing gum.|journal=Clinical preventive dentistry|date=Sep–Oct 1992|volume=14|issue=5|pages=31–4|pmid=1291185|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1291185|accessdate=13 November 2013[/tpl]  Multiple studies utilizing electron microscopy have indicated that xylitol is effective in inducing remineralization of deeper layers of demineralized enamel.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14700079http://www.drellie.com/pdfs/The-Remineralization-effects-of-XYLITOL.pdf Fair evidence was found that xylitol (as chewing gum, lozenges, etc.) reduced the incidence of acute middle ear infection in healthy children.[tpl]cite pmid |22071833 [/tpl]
Xylitol is naturally found in low concentrations in the fibers of many fruits and vegetables, and can be extracted from various berries, oats, and mushrooms, as well as fibrous material such as corn husks and sugar cane bagasse,[tpl]cite book |last=Gare |first=Fran |title=The Sweet Miracle of Xylitol |url=http://books.google.com/?id=5tgZG6Sb2aAC |date=February 1, 2003 |publisher=Basic Health Publications, Inc. |isbn=1-59120-038-5 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2005.08.015 | author = Rao, R.

or corncobs, which is hydrolyzed into xylose and catalytically hydrogenated into xylitol.  A study in rats found that xylitol had reduced or nonexistent side effects compared to other artificial sweeteners, and lower caloric value and cariogenicity than sucrose.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1159/000338440[/tpl]

==Production==

Xylitol was discovered almost simultaneously by German and French chemists in the late 19th century,[tpl]cite web|title=Xylitol FAQ's|url=http://xlear.com/xylitol-faq.aspx|publisher=Xlear|accessdate=March 14, 2012[/tpl] and was first popularized in Europe as a safe sweetener that would not affect insulin levels of people with diabetes.
Xylitol is produced by hydrogenation of xylose, which converts the sugar (an aldehyde) into a primary alcohol. It can also be extracted from natural sources, and is often harvested by tapping birch trees to produce birch sap.
Another method of producing xylitol is through microbial processes, including fermentative and biocatalytic processes in bacteria, fungi, and yeast cells, that take advantage of the xylose-intermediate fermentations to produce high yield of xylitol.[tpl]cite journal|last=Nigam|first=Poonam|author2=Singh, D.|title=Processes for Fermentative Production of Xylitol--a Sugar Substitute|journal=Process Biochemistry|year=1995|volume=30|pages=117–124|doi=10.1016/0032-9592(95)80001-8[/tpl] Common yeast cells used in effectly fermenting and producing xylitol are Candida tropicalis and Candida guilliermondii.[tpl]cite journal|last=Barbosa,|first=M.F.S.|author2=de Medeiros, M.B.|author3= de Manchilha, I.M.|author4= Schneider, H.|author5= Lee, H.|title=Screening of yeasts for production of xylitol from D-xylose and some factors which affect xylitol yield in Candida guillermondii|journal=J. Indust. Microbiol.|year=1988|volume=3|pages=241–251|doi=10.1007/bf01569582[/tpl]
Its dental significance was researched in Finland in the early 1970s.  There, scientists at Turku University demonstrated dental benefits in what became known as the "Turku sugar studies".

==Properties==

One gram of xylitol contains 2.4 kilocalories (kcal),[tpl]cite web|last=Walters|first=D. Eric|title=Xylitol|url=http://www.sweetenerbook.com/xylitol.html|work=All About Sweeteners |accessdate= March 14, 2012[/tpl] as compared to one gram of sugar, which has 3.87 kcal.[tpl]cite web|title=Sugars, granulated (sucrose)|url=http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/sweets/5592/2 |publisher= Self Nutrition Data|accessdate=March 14, 2012[/tpl] With a serving size of 100 grams, there are 387 calories. Xylitol has virtually no aftertaste, and is advertised as "safe for diabetics and individuals with hyperglycemia." This tolerance is attributed to the lower effect of xylitol on a person's blood sugar, compared to that of regular sugars as it has an extremely low glycemic index of 7 (glucose has a GI of 100).The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, January 1, 2002: International table of glycemic index and glycemic load values Retrieved 2012-08-26 Xylitol has no known toxicity or carcinogenicity, and is considered safe by the U.S. FDAhttp://www.tomsofmaine.com/ingredients/overlay/xylitol-flavor

===Dental care===

Xylitol is a “tooth-friendly”, nonfermentable sugar alcohol.[tpl]cite journal |last=Edwardsson|first=Stig|author2=Birkhed, Dowen|author3= Mejàre, Bertil|title=Acid production from Lycasin, maltitol, sorbitol and xylitol by oral streptococci and lactobacilli|journal=Acta Odontologica Scandinavica|year=1977|volume=35|issue=5|pages=257–263|pmid=21508|doi=10.3109/00016357709019801[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Drucker|first=D.B.|author2=Verran, J.|title=Comparative effects of the substance-sweeteners glucose, sorbitol, sucrose, xylitol and trichlorosucrose on lowering of pH by two oral Streptococcus mutans strains in vitro|journal=Archives of Oral Biology |year=1979 |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=965–970|doi=10.1016/0003-9969(79)90224-3|pmid=44996[/tpl]  It appears to have more dental health benefits than other polyalcohols.[tpl]cite journal | last = Maguire | first = A |author2=Rugg-Gunn, A J|title=Xylitol and caries prevention — is it a magic bullet? |journal=British Dental Journal |year=2003 |volume=194 |issue=8 |pages=429–436 |doi= 10.1038/sj.bdj.4810022 |url=http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v194/n8/abs/4810022a.html |accessdate= March 14, 2012|pmid=12778091[/tpl]  The structure of xylitol contains a tridentate ligand, (H-C-OH)3 that can rearrange with polyvalent cations like Ca2+. This interaction allows Ca2+ to be transported through the gut wall barrier and through saliva may remineralize enamel before dental caries form.[tpl]cite book |title= Functional foods, ageing and degenerative disease|year=2004|publisher=Woodhead Publishing |location= Cambridge, England |isbn=978-1-85573-725-9|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=E32UlBYUZhcC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA202#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Reusens, B.|editor=Remacle, Claude; Reusens, Brigitte |accessdate= March 14, 2012 |page=202[/tpl]
Early studies from Finland in the 1970s found compared to chewing sucrose-flavored gum, xylitol resulted in nearly two fewer cavities or missing teeth.[tpl]cite journal|title=Policy on the Use of Xylitol in Caries Prevention|journal=Reference Manual|year=2010 | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 42–44 | url = http://www.aapd.org/media/Policies_Guidelines/P_Xylitol.pdf|accessdate=March 14, 2012|publisher=American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry[/tpl]  Cavity-causing bacteria prefer six-carbon sugars or disaccharides, while xylitol is non-fermentable and cannot be used as an energy source - while still being taken up into the cell (due to similar shape) and leaving no room for the six-carbon sugars, interfering with bacterial growth and reproduction.  The harmful micro-organisms are starved in the presence of xylitol, allowing the mouth to remineralize damaged teeth with less interruption.  This same property renders it unsuitable for making bread as it interferes with the ability of yeast to digest sugars.  At least six grams of xylitol per day is thought to be needed for dental efficacy.
Xylitol also inhibits the growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as the attachment of Haemophilus influenzae on the nasopharyngeal cells.
The perception of sweetness obtained from consuming xylitol initiates the body to secrete saliva that acts as a buffer system against the acidic environment created by the microorganisms in the dental plaque. Increase in salivary pH can raise the falling pH to its neutral pH within few minutes of xylitol consumption.[tpl]cite journal|last=Scheinin|first=Arje|title=Dental Caries, Sugars and Xylitol|journal=Ann Med|year=1993|volume=25|pages=519–521[/tpl]
However, despite these promising conjectures two systematic reviews of clinical trials could not find conclusive evidence that xylitol was indeed superior to other polyols such as sorbitol[tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1875-595X.2011.00113.x | title = Effect of xylitol versus sorbitol: A quantitative systematic review of clinical trials | year = 2012 | last1 = Mickenautsch | first1 = Steffen | last2 = Yengopal | first2 = Veerasamy | journal = International Dental Journal | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 175–88 | pmid = 23016999[/tpl] or equal to that of topical fluoride in its anti-caries effect.[tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1875-595X.2011.00086.x | title = Anticariogenic effect of xylitol versus fluoride - a quantitative systematic review of clinical trials | year = 2012 | last1 = Mickenautsch | first1 = Steffen | last2 = Yengopal | first2 = Veerasamy | journal = International Dental Journal | volume = 62 | pages = 6–20 | pmid = 22251032 | issue = 1[/tpl]
In the 33-month Xylitol for Adult Caries Trial, participants were given lozenges of either five grams of xylitol or a sucralose-sweetened placebo. While this study initially found no statistically-significant reduction in 33-month caries increment among adults at an elevated risk of developing caries,[tpl]cite journal | url=http://jada.ada.org/content/144/1/21.abstract | title=Results from the Xylitol for Adult Caries Trial (X-ACT) | author=Bader, James D., et al. | journal=The Journal of the American Dental Association |date=Jan 2013 | volume=144 | issue=1 | pages=21–30 | doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2013.0010[/tpl] a further examination of data from this study revealed a significant reduction in the incidence of root caries in the group that received xylitol.[tpl]cite journal | title=Tooth-surface-specific Effects of Xylitol: Randomized Trial Results | author=Ritter, AV, Bader, JD, Leo, MC, Preisser, JS, Shugars, DA, Vollmer, WM, Amaechi, BT, Holland, JC | journal=Journal of Dental Research |date=June 2013 | volume=92 | issue=6 | pages=512–517 | doi=10.1177/0022034513487211[/tpl]
Xylitol is categorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a food additive.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.395| title=CITE: 21CFR172.395 | publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration | work=Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 | date=2012-04-01[/tpl]
Like other sugar alcohol-sweetened products, xylitol-sweetened products are allowed to be labeled with the claim that they do not promote dental cavities.

===Diabetes===

Possessing approximately 33% fewer calories, xylitol is a lower-calorie alternative to table sugar. Absorbed more slowly than sugar, it does not contribute to high blood sugar levels or the resulting hyperglycemia caused by insufficient insulin response. This characteristic has also proven beneficial for people suffering from metabolic syndrome, a common disorder that includes insulin resistance, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and an increased risk for blood clots.[tpl]cite journal|last=Martí|first=N.|author2=Funes, L.L.|author3= Saura, D.|author4= Micol, V.|title=An update on alternative sweeteners|journal=International sugar journal |date=July 2008 |volume=110 |issue=1315 |pages=425–429 |issn=0020-8841[/tpl]  Xylitol is used as a sweetener in medicines, chewing gum and pastilles.[tpl]cite web|last=Savola|first=Päivikki|title=Xylitol combats cavities |url=http://virtual.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=43050#xyl|work=Advanced food development and functional foods from Finland|publisher=Finfood - Finnish Food Information |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080411105055/http://virtual.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=43050#xyl |archivedate=April 18, 2008[/tpl]

===Source of energy===

Xylitol consumed is absorbed incompletely and some that are unabsorbed can be used as a dietary fiber in helping to maintain gut function that consequently uses bacterial fermentation to convert xylitol to short fatty acid chains that can be utilized in energy pathways. Xylitol is also useful in recovery after heavy exercise because of its ability to efficiently convert to glucose and glycogen.[tpl]cite journal|last=Vasilescu|first=Razvan|author2=Ionescu, A.M.|author3= Mihai, A.|author4= Carniciu, S.|author5= Ionescu-Tirgoviste, C.|title=Sweetners and metabolic diseases: Xylitol as a new player|journal=Proc. Rom. Acad.|year=2011|volume=2|series=B|pages=125–128[/tpl]

===Ear infection===

Xylitol chewing gum appears to decrease rates of acute otitis media in children going to daycare by 25%.[tpl]cite journal|last=Azarpazhooh|first=A|coauthors=Limeback, H; Lawrence, HP; Shah, PS|title=Xylitol for preventing acute otitis media in children up to 12 years of age.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Nov 9, 2011|issue=11|pages=CD007095|pmid=22071833[/tpl]

==Safety==

Xylitol has no known toxicity in humans. In one study, the participants consumed a diet containing a monthly average of 1.5 kg of xylitol with a maximum daily intake of 430 g with no apparent ill effects.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mäkinen, KK |title=Long-term tolerance of healthy human subjects to high amounts of xylitol and fructose: general and biochemical findings |journal=Internationale Zeitschrift fur Vitamin und Ernahrungsforschung Beiheft |volume=15 |issue= |pages=92–104 |year=1976 |pmid=783060 |doi= |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/783060 [/tpl] Like most sugar alcohols, it has a laxative effect because sugar alcohols are not fully broken down during digestion; albeit one-tenth the strength of sorbitol.[tpl]Clarify|date=June 2011[/tpl] The effect depends upon the individual. In one study of 13 children, four experienced diarrhea when consuming over 65 grams per day. Studies have reported adaptation occurs after several weeks of consumption.
As with other sugar alcohols, with the exception of erythritol, consumption in excess of one's laxation threshold (the amount of sweetener that can be consumed before abdominal discomfort sets in) can result in temporary gastrointestinal side effects, such as bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea. Adaptation, an increase of the laxation threshold, occurs with regular intake. Xylitol has a lower laxation threshold than some sugar alcohols, but is more easily tolerated than others such as mannitol and sorbitol.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wang, Yeu-Ming; van Eys, Jan |title=Nutritional significance of fructose and sugar alcohols |journal=Annual Review of Nutrition |volume=1 |pages=437–75 |year=1981 |pmid=6821187 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nu.01.070181.002253 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Sugar Alcohols|url=http://www.dm2nb.ca/pdf/patient_resources/diabetes/sugar_alcohols_cda.pdf|publisher=Canadian Diabetes Association|accessdate=March 14, 2012|date=May 2005[/tpl]

===Xylitol toxicity in dogs===

Xylitol is well established as a life-threatening toxin to dogs.  According to the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center, the number of cases of xylitol toxicosis in dogs has significantly increased since the first reports in 2002. Dogs that have ingested foods containing xylitol (greater than 100 milligrams of xylitol consumed per kilogram of bodyweight) have presented with low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can be life-threatening.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dunayer|first=Eric K.|author2=Gwaltney-Brant, Sharon M.|title=Acute hepatic failure and coagulopathy associated with xylitol ingestion in eight dogs|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association |date=October 2006 |volume=229|issue=7|pages=1113–1117|doi=10.2460/javma.229.7.1113|pmid=17014359[/tpl] Low blood sugar can result in a loss of coordination, depression, collapse and seizures in as little as 30 minutes.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dunayer|first=Erik K.|title=Hypoglycemia following canine ingestion of xylitol-containing gum|journal=Veterinary and human toxicology |date=April 2004|volume=46|issue=2|pages=87–88|pmid=15080212[/tpl] Intake of doses of xylitol (greater than 500 – 1000 mg/kg bwt) has been implicated in liver failure in dogs, which can be fatal.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dunayer|first=Erik K.|title=New findings on the effects of xylitol ingestion in dogs|journal=Veterinary Medicine|date=December 2006|volume=101|issue=12|pages=791–797|url=http://files.meetup.com/556343/xylitol%20in%20dogs.pdf|accessdate=March 14, 2012[/tpl] Possible cause of hypoglycemia experienced by dogs is the fact that the xylitol in gum is released more slowly and absorbed over longer period than when it is consumed as a pure form.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dunayer|first=Eric K|title=Hypoglycemia Following Canine Ingestion of Xylitol-Containing Gum|journal=Vet.
