[[Lysergic acid]]

CATEGORIES: Ergolines, Carboxylic acids

Lysergic acid, also known as D-lysergic acid and (+)-lysergic acid, is a precursor for a wide range of ergoline alkaloids that are produced by the ergot fungus and found in the seeds of Turbina corymbosa (ololiuhqui), Argyreia nervosa (Hawaiian Baby Woodrose) and Ipomoea tricolor (morning glories, tlitliltzin). Amides of lysergic acid, lysergamides, are widely used as pharmaceuticals and as psychedelic drugs (LSD).  Lysergic acid received its name as it was a product of the lysis of various ergot alkaloids.

==Synthesis==

Lysergic acid is generally produced by hydrolysis[tpl]cite journal| journal=J Biotechnol.|date=Nov 17, 2001| volume=84| issue=1 | pages=63–6| title=Hydrolysis of lysergamide to lysergic acid by Rhodococcus equi A4 | author=Martínková L, Kren V, Cvak L, Ovesná M, Prepechalová I[/tpl] of natural lysergamides, but can also be synthesized in the laboratory by a complex total synthesis for example by Woodward's team in 1956.[tpl]cite journal| title= The Total Synthesis of Lysergic Acid | journal= Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume= 78| pages= 3087–3114 |year=1956 |author=Edmund C. Kornfeld, E.J. Fornefeld, G. Bruce Kline, Marjorie J. Mann, Dwight E. Morrison, Reuben G. Jones and R.B. Woodward[/tpl] An enantioselective total synthesis based on a palladium catalyzed domino cyclization reaction has been described in 2011 by Fujii and Ohno.S. Inuki, A. Iwata, S. Oishi, N. Fujii and H. Ohno, J. Org. Chem. 2011, 76 (7), pp 2072–2083, [tpl]DOI|10.1021/jo102388e[/tpl]. Lysergic acid monohydrate crystallizes in very thin hexagonal leaflets when recrystallized from water. Lysergic acid monohydrate, when dried (140 °C at [tpl]convert|2|mmHg|Pa|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) forms anhydrous lysergic acid. 
The biosynthetic route is based on the alkylation of the amino acid tryptophan with dimethylallyl diphosphate (isoprene derived from 3R-mevalonic acid) giving 4-dimethylallyl-L-tryptophan which is N-methylated with S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Oxidative ring closure followed by decarboxylation, reduction, cyclization, oxidation, and allylic isomerization yields D-(+)-lysergic acid.

==Isomers==

Lysergic acid is a chiral compound with two stereocenters. The isomer with inverted configuration at  carbon atom 8 close to the carboxy group is called isolysergic acid. Inversion at carbon 5 close to the nitrogen atom leads to L-lysergic acid and L-isolysergic acid, respectively. Lysergic acid is listed as a Table I precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.List of Precursors and Chemicals Frequently Used in the Illicit Manufacture of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Under International Control, International Narcotics Control Board
