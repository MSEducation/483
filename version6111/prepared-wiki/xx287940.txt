Dirty Water is the second album released by the American rock band The Standells, and their first studio album. It was recorded in late 1965 and released in 1966.  

==Description==

The album title is taken from the song of the same name. The song "Dirty Water" was written by the album's producer, Ed Cobb. Its Boston and Charles River references are reportedly based on an experience that Cobb and his girlfriend had with a mugger in Boston in the mid-1960s.O'Nan, Stewart, and Stephen King.

(Note that this book incorrectly refers to The Standells as a Boston proto-punk group, rather than a California garage band.) As for the Standells band members, they were from Southern California and had never been to Boston before recording the song.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bostonspastime.com/dirtywater.html|title=Red Sox Fans Love Their Dirty Water|accessdate=2011-08-15[/tpl]
