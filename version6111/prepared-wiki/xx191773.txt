Mulamba said later that the team had underperformed, either in protest[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/andrewharding/2010/06/africas_abandoned_football_leg.html|title=Africa's abandoned football legend|last=Harding|first=Andrew|date=5 June 2010|work=BBC Online|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 June 2010[/tpl] or from loss of morale, after not receiving a promised $45,000 match bonus.

==Later life==

In 1994, Mulamba was honoured at the African Cup of Nations in Tunisia.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://simbasports.iquebec.com/interviewndaye.htm|title=Interview with Ndaye Mulamba|last=Maradas|first=Emmanuel|year=1998|work=African Soccer Magazine|accessdate=6 June 2010[/tpl] On returning to Zaire, was shot in the leg by robbers who mistakenly assumed a former sports star would be a wealthy target. Some new information goes against the "robber" theory, check the biography in the external links.  He was sheltered by Emmanuel Paye-Paye for eight months' recuperation. During the First Congo War, Mulamba's eldest son was killed and in 1996 he fled to South Africa as a refugee, alone and destitute. He went to Johannesburg and then Cape Town, where he was taken in by a family in a township.  In 1998, a minute's silence was held at the African Cup of Nations in Burkina Faso after an erroneous report that Mulamba had died in a diamond mining accident in Angola. By then Mulamba was unemployed and drinking heavily.
By 2010 Mulamba was working as a coach of local amateur teams and had married a local woman. Forgotten Gold, a documentary filmed in 2008–9, follows him in South Africa and on a visit back to Congo.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://tdb.berlinale-talentcampus.de/campus/project/profile/35848|title=Forgotten Gold|work=Berlinale Talent Campus|publisher=Berlin Film Festival|accessdate=6 June 2010[/tpl] He also met with Danny Jordaan, head of the organising committee for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
