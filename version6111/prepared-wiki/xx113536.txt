Theodor Hertzka, or Hertzka Tivadar (July 13, 1845, Budapest â€“ October 22, 1924, Wiesbaden) was a Jewish-Hungarian-Austrian economist and journalist.

==Life==

He studied at the universities of Vienna and Budapest, and in 1872 became a member of the editorial staff of the Neue Freie Presse of Vienna. In 1879 he founded the newspaper Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung, which he edited until 1886. He was a friend of Johannes Brahms.
Hertzka has been called the "Austrian Bellamy", because his novel Freiland, ein soziales Zukunftsbild (Leipzig, 1890), had a similar theme to that of Edward Bellamy's novel Looking Backward.
