[[Apam Napat]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu gods, Rigvedic deities, Sea and river gods

Apam Napat  is an eminent figure of the Indo-Iranian pantheon. In the Rig Veda, Apām Napāt is the supreme god of creation. He created all existential beings (Rig Veda 2.35.2)2 . In Zoroastrianism, Apąm Napāt is a divinity of water, see also Burz.
Apām Napāt in Sanskrit and Apąm Napāt in Avestan mean "son of waters" (see Ap (water)).
Sanskrit and Avestan napāt ("grandson") are cognate to Latin nepōs and English nephew, but the name Apām Napāt has also been compared to Etruscan Nethuns and Celtic Nechtan and Roman Neptune.
In Yasht 19 of the Avesta Apąm Napāt appears as the Creator of mankind. Here, there is an evident link between the glory of sovereignty (Khvarenah) and Apąm Napāt who protects Khvarenah as the royal glory of Iranian kings. Apām Napāt is sometimes, for example in Rigveda book 2 hymn 35 verse 3, described as a creator deity who originates in the cosmic waters (see: Agni). He is ascribed a golden splendour that can be associated with fire. The reference to fire may have originally referred to flames from natural gas or oil seepages surfacing through water, as in a fire temple at Surakhany near Baku in Azerbaijan (Jivanji Jamshedji Modi 1926).[tpl]Dubious|date=January 2009[/tpl] There is a conjecture that the word "naphtha" came (via Greek, where it meant any sort of petroleum) from the name "Apam Napat".Studies in ancient technology by R.
