Carol Creighton Burnett (born April 26, 1933) is an American actress, comedian, singer, and writer. She is best known for her long-running TV variety show, The Carol Burnett Show, for CBS. She has achieved success on stage, television, and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedy roles.
After a difficult childhood in San Antonio, Texas with alcoholic parents, Burnett discovered acting and comedy in college. She performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in Once Upon a Mattress, receiving a Tony Award nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on The Garry Moore Show for the next three years, and winning her first Emmy Award in 1962. Burnett moved to Los Angeles, California  and began an 11-year run on The Carol Burnett Show which was aired on CBS television from 1967 to 1978. With roots in vaudeville, The Carol Burnett Show was a variety show that combined comedy sketches, song and dance. The comedy sketches included film parodies and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's television run, and both she and the show won numerous Emmy and Golden Globe Awards.
During and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects. Her film roles include Pete 'n' Tillie (1972), The Four Seasons (1981), Annie (1982), Noises Off (1992), and Horton Hears a Who! (2008). On television, she has appeared in other sketch shows; in dramatic roles in 6 Rms Riv Vu (1974) and Friendly Fire (1979); in various well-regarded guest roles, such as in Mad About You, for which she won an Emmy Award; and in specials with Julie Andrews, Dolly Parton, Beverly Sills, and others. She was also back on Broadway in 1995 in Moon Over Buffalo, for which she was nominated for a Tony Award.

==Early life==

Burnett was born in San Antonio, Texas in 1933,[tpl]cite journal|title=Monitor|journal=Entertainment Weekly|date=Mar 19–26, 2013|year=2013|issue=1255/1256|pages=31[/tpl] the daughter of Ina Louise (née Creighton), a publicity writer for movie studios, and Joseph Thomas Burnett, a movie theater manager.Carol Burnett Biography (1933–)That her mother's maiden name was Creighton is confirmed in Carol's autobiography "One More Time" Both of her parents suffered from alcoholism, and at a young age, she was left with her grandmother, Mabel Eudora White. Her parents divorced in the late 1930s, and Burnett and her grandmother moved to an apartment near her mother’s in an impoverished area of Hollywood. There they stayed in a boarding house with her younger half-sister Chrissie.Carol Burnett Fan When Burnett was in the second grade, she briefly invented an imaginary twin sister named Karen, with Shirley Temple-like dimples. Motivated to further the pretense, Burnett recalled fondly that she "fooled the other boarders in the rooming house where we lived by frantically switching clothes and dashing in and out of the house by the fire escape and the front door. Then I became exhausted and Karen mysteriously vanished."Joan Downs. "Here's to you, Mrs. Hamilton." Life. Vol. 70, No. 18, May 14, 1971. pp 93–97.
For a while, she worked as an usherette at what is now the Hollywood Pacific Theatre (the forecourt of which is now the location of her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; see the section in the theatre's article for more information). After graduating from Hollywood High School in 1951, Burnett received an anonymous envelope containing $50 for one year's tuition at UCLA, where she initially planned on studying journalism.[tpl]cite news |url=http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2013-04-10/carol-burnett-carrie-and-me-mother-daughter-love-story/transcript |title=Carol Burnett: "Carrie and Me: A Mother-Daughter Love Story" |publisher=The Diane Rehm Show |date=April 10, 2013 |accessdate=April 28, 2013 | first=Diane | last=Rehm[/tpl] During her first year of college, Burnett switched her focus to theater arts and English, with the goal of becoming a playwright. She found she had to take an acting course to enter the playwright program; "I wasn't really ready to do the acting thing, but I had no choice."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thestar.com/comment/columnists/article/645801 |title=One laugh changed Carol Burnett's life |publisher=Toronto Star |date=June 6, 2009 |accessdate=September 18, 2009 | first=Richard | last=Ouzounian[/tpl] She followed a sudden impulse in her first performance; "Don't ask me why, but when we were in front of the audience, I suddenly decided I was going to stretch out all my words and my first line came out 'I'm baaaaaaaack!'" The audience response moved her deeply:
During this time, Burnett performed in several university productions, garnering recognition for her comedic and musical abilities. Her mother disapproved of her acting ambitions:
The young Burnett, always insecure about her looks, described her reaction to her mother's advice of "You can always write, no matter what you look like", in her 1986 memoir One More Time: "God, that hurt!"
In 1954, during her junior year, a professor invited Burnett and some other students to perform at a black-tie party. A man and his wife approached her afterward, as she was putting cookies in her purse to take home to her grandmother.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/story.html?id=2001007 |title=Carol Burnett's comedy reign extends into dramatic role |last=Birnie |first=Peter |publisher=Vancouver Sun |date=September 16, 2009 |accessdate=March 23, 2011[/tpl] Instead of reprimanding her, the man complimented Burnett's performance and asked about her future plans. When he discovered that she wanted to go try her luck with musical comedy in New York, but did not have enough money, he offered her and her boyfriend Don Saroyan each a $1000 interest-free loan on the spot. The conditions were that it was to be paid back in five years, his name was never to be revealed, and if she became a success, she would help others attain their dreams. Burnett took him up on his offer. She and Saroyan left college and moved to New York to pursue acting careers. That same year, Burnett's father died of causes related to his alcoholism.

==Career==

===Early career===

After spending her first year in New York working as a hat-check girl and failing to land acting jobs, Burnett along with other girls living at the Rehearsal Club, a boarding house for women seriously pursuing an acting career, put on The Rehearsal Club Revue on March 3, 1955. They mailed invitations to agents, who showed up along with stars like Celeste Holm and Marlene Dietrich, and this opened doors for several of the girls. Burnett was cast in a minor role on The Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney Show in 1955. She played the girlfriend of a ventriloquist’s dummy on the popular children’s program. This role led to her starring role opposite Buddy Hackett in the short-lived sitcom Stanley from 1956 to 1957.
After Stanley, Burnett found herself unemployed for a short time. She eventually bounced back a few months later as a highly popular performer on the New York circuit of cabarets and night clubs, most notably for a hit parody number called "I Made a Fool of Myself Over John Foster Dulles" (Dulles was Secretary of State at the time). In 1957, Burnett performed this number on both The Tonight Show, hosted by Jack Paar, and The Ed Sullivan Show. Burnett also worked as a regular on one of television's earliest game shows, Pantomime Quiz, during this time. In 1957, just as Burnett was achieving her first small successes, her mother died.
Burnett's first true taste of success came with her appearance on Broadway in the 1959 musical Once Upon a Mattress, for which she was nominated for a Tony Award. The same year, she became a regular player on The Garry Moore Show, a job that lasted until 1962. She won an Emmy Award[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/carol-burnett|title=Carol Burnett Emmy Winner|publisher=The Emmys|accessdate=2011-12-27[/tpl] that year for her "Outstanding Performance in a Variety or Musical Program or Series" on the show. Burnett portrayed a number of characters, most memorably the put-upon cleaning woman who would later become her signature alter-ego. With her success on the Moore show, Burnett finally rose to headliner status and appeared in the 1962 special Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall, co-starring her friend Julie Andrews. The show was produced by Bob Banner, directed by Joe Hamilton, and written by Mike Nichols and Ken Welch.[tpl]cite book |last1=Shulman |first1=Arthur |last2=Youman |first2=Roger|title=How Sweet It Was.

Burnett also guest-starred on a number of shows during this time, including The Twilight Zone episode "Cavender is Coming".
In 1964, Burnett starred in the Broadway musical Fade Out - Fade In, but was forced to withdraw after sustaining a neck injury in a taxi accident. She returned to the show later but withdrew again to participate in a variety show, The Entertainers, opposite Caterina Valente and Bob Newhart. The producers of Fade Out – Fade In sued the actress for breach of contract after her absences from the popular show caused its failure, but the suit was later dropped. The Entertainers ran for only one season.Suskin, Steven "Fade Out-Fade In", "Second Act Trouble" (2006), ISBN 1-55783-631-0, pp 90–93
Around the same time, Burnett became good friends with Jim Nabors, who was enjoying great success with his series Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.. As a result of their close friendship, Burnett played a recurring role on Nabors's show as a tough corporal, later gunnery sergeant. Nabors would later be her first guest every season on her variety show.Biography of Carol Burnett at www.nndb.com
In 1966, Lucille Ball became a friend and mentor to Burnett. After having guested on Burnett's highly successful CBS-TV special Carol + 2 and having the younger performer reciprocate by appearing on The Lucy Show, Ball reportedly offered Burnett her own sitcom called "Here's Agnes", to be produced by Desilu Productions. Burnett declined the offer, not wanting to commit herself to a weekly series. The two remained close friends until Ball's death in 1989. Ball sent flowers every year on her birthday. When Burnett awoke on the day of her 56th birthday in 1989, she discovered via the morning news that Ball had died. Later that afternoon, flowers arrived at Burnett's house with a note reading, "Happy Birthday, Kid. Love, Lucy."Fink, Mitchell. The Last Days of Dead Celebrities. Miramax, July 2006, 288 pages.

===The Carol Burnett Show===

In 1967, CBS offered to put Burnett in a weekly comedy series called Here's Agnes. However, Burnett had a stipulation in her ten-year contract with CBS that said she had five years from the date The Garry Moore Show ended to "push the button" on hosting thirty one-hour episodes of a music/comedy variety show. As a result, the hour-long Carol Burnett Show was born and debuted in September 1967, garnering 23 Emmy Awards and winning or being nominated for multiple Emmy and Golden Globe Awards every season it was on the air. Its ensemble cast included Tim Conway (who was a guest player until the ninth season),Interview on Entertainment Tonight. May 22, 2006. Harvey Korman, Lyle Waggoner, and the teenaged Vicki Lawrence, whom Burnett herself discovered and mentored. The network initially did not want her to do a variety show because they believed only men could be successful at variety, but Burnett's contract required that they give her one season of whatever kind of show she wanted to make.http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/10/entertainment/ca-34154?s=g&n=n&m=Broad&rd=www.google.com&tnid=1&sessid=ad58030466016a68964a5a2cf0fc4737e8af7121&uuid=ad58030466016a68964a5a2cf0fc4737e8af7121&pgtp=article&eagi=&cat=entertainment&page_type=article&exci=2000_10_10_entertainment_ca-34154&pg=1 LA Times Interview She chose to carry on the tradition of past variety show successes.
A true variety show, The Carol Burnett Show struck a chord with viewers. Among other things, it parodied films ("Went With the Wind" for Gone With the Wind), television ("As the Stomach Turns" for the soap opera As the World Turns) and commercials. Musical numbers were also a frequent feature. Burnett and her team struck gold with the original sketch "The Family", which eventually was spun off into its own television show called Mama's Family, starring Vicki Lawrence.
Burnett opened most shows with an impromptu question-and-answer session with the audience, lasting a few minutes, during which she often demonstrated her ability to humorously ad lib. On numerous occasions, she obliged when asked to perform her trademark[tpl]cite web |url=http://allday.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2008/03/12/4378081-carol-burnetts-tarzan-yell |title=Carol Burnett's Tarzan Yell |publisher=allDAY on Today |date=March 12, 2008 |accessdate=February 11, 2012[/tpl] Tarzan yell.
Burnett ended each show by tugging on her left ear, which was a message to her grandmother who raised her. This was done to let her know that she was doing well and that she loved her. During the show's run, Burnett's grandmother died. On an Intimate Portrait episode on Burnett, she tearfully recalled her grandmother's last moments: "She said to my husband Joe from her hospital bed 'Joe, you see that spider up there?' There was no spider, but Joe said he did anyhow. She said 'Every few minutes a big spider jumps on that little spider and they go at it like rabbits!!' And then she died. There's laughter in everything!"Lifetime Channel's Intimate Portrait episode on Burnett Burnett continued the tradition of tugging her ear.
The Carol Burnett Show ceased production in 1978, Four post-script episodes were produced and aired on ABC during the summer of 1979 under the title, Carol Burnett and Company basically using the same format and, with the exception of Harvey Korman and Lyle Waggoner, the same supporting cast. Beginning in 1977, the comedy sketches of Burnett's series were edited into half-hour episodes entitled Carol Burnett and Friends, which, for many years, proved to be extremely popular in syndication.

I Do! with Rock Hudson, and eleven years later, she took the supporting role of Carlotta Campion in the 1985 concert performance of Stephen Sondheim's Follies. Burnett made frequent appearances as a panelist on the game show Password, an association she maintained until the early 1980s (in fact, Mark Goodson awarded her his Silver Password All-Stars Award for best celebrity player; she's also credited with coming up with the title Password Plus, when it was originally planned to be titled Password '79).
In the 1980s and 1990s, Burnett made several attempts at starting a new variety program.

Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford (Louis Edmonds), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford (Ruth Warrick). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter.

===Lawsuits===

In 1981, Burnett won a judgment against National Enquirer for libel after it printed a short item implying that she had been drunk in a Georgetown, Washington, D.C. restaurant. The jury awarded Burnett $300,000 in compensatory damages and $1.3 million in punitive damages. The trial court reduced this to $50,000 in compensatory damages and $750,000 in punitive damages.  On appeal, punitive damages were further reduced to $150,000. See Carol Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.
In 2007, she sued 20th Century Fox for copyright infringement, trademark violation, invasion of privacy, and misappropriation of name and likeness over the use of an altered version of her signature closing song and the portrayal of her cleaning lady "charwoman" character in an episode of Family Guy."Carol Burnett v. Family Guy." The Smoking Gun. Retrieved on 2010-11-23. The lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge.Carol Burnett vs. Family Guy, 10 Zen Monkeys.com. Retrieved on July 3, 2007. The judge used Hustler Magazine v. Falwell as the general basis for the decision, ruling that the cartoon was a permissible parody of a public figure.[tpl]cite web|title=Burnett v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.|url=http://www.casp.net/cases/Burnett%20v.%20Twentieth%20Century%20Fox.html|work=California Anti-SLAPP Project|accessdate=April 25, 2011|quote=Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 51, 108 S.Ct. 876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41 (1988). Here, Family Guy put a cartoon version of Carol Burnett/the charwoman in an awkward, ridiculous, crude, and absurd situation in order to lampoon and parody her as a public figure. Therefore, the Court finds that a parodic character may reasonably be perceived in the Family Guy's use of the Charwoman because it is a “literary or artistic work that broadly mimics an author's characteristic style and holds it up to ridicule.”[/tpl]
