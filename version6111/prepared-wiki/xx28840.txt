Karolyi went around the classrooms trying to find the girls. He could not find them. But then he spotted Nadia in the classroom.  The other one, Viorica Dumitro went on to be one of Romania's top ballerina.  She was training with Károlyi by the time she was 7 years old, in 1968. She was one of the first students at the gymnastics school established in Onești by Béla and his wife, Marta. Unlike many of the other students at the Károlyi school, Comăneci was able to commute from home for many years because she lived in the town.Letters to a Young Gymnast.

Comăneci came in 13th in her first Romanian National Championships in 1969, at the age of just 8. Béla Károlyi thought this was unlucky and gave her a doll to remind her never to place 13th again[ref]
