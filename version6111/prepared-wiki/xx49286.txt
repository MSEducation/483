Population genetics is the study of the distributions and changes of allele frequency in a population, as the population is subject to the four main evolutionary processes: natural selection, genetic drift, mutation and gene flow. It also takes into account the factors of recombination, population subdivision and population structure. Studies in this branch of biology examine such phenomena as adaptation and speciation.
Population genetics was a vital ingredient in the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis. Its primary founders were Sewall Wright, J. B. S. Haldane and R. A. Fisher, who also laid the foundations for the related discipline of quantitative genetics.
Traditionally a highly mathematical discipline, modern population genetics encompasses theoretical, lab and field work. Computational approaches, often using coalescent theory, have played a central role since the 1980s.

This implies that all members belong to the same species and live near each other.[ref]

For example, all of the moths of the same species living in an isolated forest are a population. A gene in this population may have several alternate forms, which account for variations between the phenotypes of the organisms. An example might be a gene for coloration in moths that has two alleles: black and white. A gene pool is the complete set of alleles for a gene in a single population; the allele frequency for an allele is the fraction of the genes in the pool that is composed of that allele (for example, what fraction of moth coloration genes are the black allele). Evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population; for example, the allele for black color in a population of moths becoming more common.

==Four processes==

===1. Natural selection===

Natural selection is the fact that some traits make it more likely for an organism to survive and reproduce. Population genetics describes natural selection by defining fitness as a propensity or probability of survival and reproduction in a particular environment. The fitness is normally given by the symbol w=1-s where s is the selection coefficient. Natural selection acts on phenotypes, or the observable characteristics of organisms, but the genetically heritable basis of any phenotype which gives a reproductive advantage will become more common in a population (see allele frequency). In this way, natural selection converts differences in fitness into changes in allele frequency in a population over successive generations.
Before the advent of population genetics, many biologists doubted that small differences in fitness were sufficient to make a large difference to evolution.[tpl]cite journal | author=William B. Provine | title=The role of mathematical population geneticists in the evolutionary synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s | journal=Studies of the History of Biology | year=1978 | volume=1 | pages=167–192[/tpl] Population geneticists addressed this concern in part by comparing selection to genetic drift. Selection can overcome genetic drift when s is greater than 1 divided by the effective population size. When this criterion is met, the probability that a new advantageous mutant becomes fixed is approximately equal to 2s.[tpl]cite journal | author=JBS Haldane | title=A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection, Part V: Selection and Mutation | journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | year=1927 | volume=23 | pages=838–844 | bibcode=1927PCPS...23..838H | doi=10.1017/S0305004100015644 | issue=7[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1098/rstb.2009.0282[/tpl] The time until fixation of such an allele depends little on genetic drift, and is approximately proportional to log(sN)/s.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hermisson J, Pennings PS | title=Soft sweeps: molecular population genetics of adaptation from standing genetic variation |journal=Genetics |year=2005| volume=169 |pages=2335–2352 |doi=10.1534/genetics.104.036947 |pmid=15716498 |issue=4 |pmc=1449620[/tpl]

====Hardy–Weinberg principle====

Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough genetic variation in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was blending inheritance. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The Hardy–Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. According to this principle, the frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant in the absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.[tpl]cite book |author=Ewens W.J. |year=2004 |title=Mathematical Population Genetics (2nd Edition) |publisher=Springer-Verlag, New York |isbn=0-387-20191-2[/tpl] The Hardy–Weinberg "equilibrium" refers to this stability of allele frequencies over time.
A second component of the Hardy–Weinberg principle concerns the effects of a single generation of random mating. In this case, the genotype frequencies can be predicted from the allele frequencies. For example, in the simplest case of a single locus with two alleles: the dominant allele is denoted A and the recessive a and their frequencies are denoted by p and q; freq(A) = p; freq(a) = q; p + q = 1. If the genotype frequencies are in Hardy–Weinberg proportions resulting from random mating, then we will have freq(AA) = p2 for the AA homozygotes in the population, freq(aa) = q2 for the aa homozygotes, and freq(Aa) = 2pq for the heterozygotes.

===2. Genetic drift===

Genetic drift is a change in allele frequencies caused by random sampling. That is, the alleles in the offspring are a random sample of those in the parents.[ref]
