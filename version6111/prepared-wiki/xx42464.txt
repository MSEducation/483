Identified in the late 1980s with the 'Brit Pack' of new young British actors headed by Gary Oldman, Firth's rise to stardom progressed at a slower pace than many of his contemporaries.  It was not until his portrayal of Mr. Darcy in the 1995 television adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice that Firth became a household name.  The show was a hit in the UK and USA and established him as a marquee talent.  This led to roles in films such as The English Patient, Bridget Jones's Diary (for which he was nominated for a BAFTA), Shakespeare in Love and Love Actually.  In 2009 he received widespread critical acclaim for his leading role in A Single Man, for which Firth gained his first Academy Award nomination, and won a BAFTA Award.
In 2011, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was also selected as one of The Time 100."Full List – The 2011 TIME 100", Time, 21 April 2011. Retrieved 8 October 2012. He was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Winchester in 2007, and was made a Freeman of the City of London in 2012.
