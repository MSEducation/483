Marc Bellemare (born 3 May 1956) is a lawyer and politician from Quebec.

==Background==

He was born in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, studied Law at the Université de Montréal and was admitted to the Bar of Quebec in 1979.

==Provincial politics==

Bellemare ran as a star candidate with the Liberal Party in the Quebec election of 2003.  He was elected to the National Assembly of Quebec and represented the district of Vanier.
He was appointed to Premier Jean Charest's Cabinet on April 29, 2003 and served as Minister of Justice and Attorney General.  Bellemare pushed for harsher sentences for organized crime.  He was criticized several times by Justice Fraser Martin for the way he handled a juvenile prostitution case which took place in Quebec City and involved talk show host Robert Gillet.Le juge Martin critique à nouveau le procureur général Marc Bellemare, Le Journal de Montréal, February 6, 2004
For several years, Bellemare has been a strong advocate of abolishing Quebec's car insurance law.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ledevoir.com/2008/03/01/178475.html |title=Droit de poursuite: un débat sans fin |first=François |last=Desjardins |work=Le Devoir |date=March 1, 2008[/tpl]  He tried to convince his colleagues to abolish the provincial no fault car insurance plan that had been established in 1978.  The Liberals, who had made the proposed change part of their platform, soon abandoned the idea.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ledevoir.com/2004/01/29/46080.html |title=No fault: Québec imposera une limite |first=Tommy |last=Chouinard |work=Le Devoir |date=January 24, 2004[/tpl]  Disappointed, Bellemare resigned from his cabinet post on April 27, 2004 and relinquished his seat the next day, lasting less than a year in office.

==Mayoral candidate==

After months of rumors, Bellemare announced that he would be candidate for Mayor of Quebec City.  His announcement was made on March 11, 2004.  He also founded a political party, Vision Quebec, which was registered on February 22, 2005.  Bellemare ended up finishing a distant third. (See Quebec municipal elections, 2005)
An early mayoral election was called in 2007, after the death of incumbent Mayor Andrée Boucher.  Bellemare ran and finished a distant third again.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/regions/Quebec/2007/11/07/007-Bellemare_candidat.shtml |title=Marc Bellemare revient à la charge |work=Radio-Canada |date=November 7, 2007[/tpl]  He resigned as party leader on December 26, 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.quebecurbain.qc.ca/2007/12/31/fin-de-lepisode-municipal-pour-marc-bellemare/  |title=Fin de l’épisode municipal pour Marc Bellemare |first=Martin |last=Otis  |work=Québec urbain |date=December 31, 2007[/tpl]  In 2008, Bellemare unsuccessfully petitioned the Papal Nuncio to Canada for an eventual visit of Pope Benedict XVI in Quebec City.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.quebechebdo.com/article-177718-Le-pape-ferme-la-derniere-porte.html  |title=Le pape ferme la dernière porte |first=Nicolas |last=Bégin |work=Québec Hebdo |date=January 25, 2008[/tpl] Nonetheless, Bellemare was still listed as party leader on the Quebec Chief Election Officer's web site as of June 2008.
