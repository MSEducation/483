[[Illuminator (backlight)]]

CATEGORIES: Display technology, Casio brands, 1995 introductions

Illuminator is an electroluminiscent LCD backlight development used in some Casio watches (Also known as Fox Fire). The Timex corporation has its very own similar technology called Indiglo.

==History==

In response to the Indiglo backlight which Timex had introduced in 1992, Casio introduced in 1995 an electroluminescent backlight on its modules. One of the first models was the Casio DW-5600E, also well known as the G-Shock Illuminator (where the "E" of the model number means Electroluminescent), since one of the things that highlights this watch is the blue/green light that makes the display visible under any light condition.
In reference to this, domestic models (Japan) would typically bear the term "Foxfire", while export models bore "Illuminator."
