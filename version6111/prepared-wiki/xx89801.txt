[[A Time for Choosing]]

CATEGORIES: Speeches by Ronald Reagan, United States presidential election, 1964

A Time for Choosing, also known as The Speech, was a speech presented during the 1964 U.S. presidential election campaign by future president Ronald Reagan on behalf of Republican candidate Barry Goldwater.
Many versions of the speech exist, since it was altered over many weeks.  Contrary to popular belief, however, the speech was not given at the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, California as a nomination speech for Barry Goldwater.  Richard Nixon gave that nomination speech.  Reagan, though he campaigned for Goldwater, did not use "A Time for Choosing" until October 27, 1964, when it was part of a pre-recorded television program, Rendezvous with Destiny.  In his autobiography Reagan recalled going to bed that night "hoping I hadn't let Barry down."[tpl]cite book |last=Regan |first=Ronald |author-link=Ronald Reagan |year=1990 |title=An American Life: The Autobiography |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=0671691988 |location=New York City |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page=143 |isbn=0671691988 |accessdate=31 March 2014 |quote=When it was over, the others in the room said I had done well.

Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. In this speech, he revealed his ideological motivation: "The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/40_reagan/psources/ps_choose64.html |title=A Time for Choosing |publisher=PBS |accessdate=April 17, 2007[/tpl] He also said, "You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down. Up to man's age-old dream – the maximum of individual freedom consistent with order – or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism."Richard A. Harris, Daniel J. Tichenor.

Soon afterwards, Reagan was asked to run for Governor of California. To this day, this speech is considered one of the most effective ever made on behalf of a candidate. Nevertheless, Barry Goldwater lost the election by one of the largest margins in history. Reagan was later called the "Great Communicator" in recognition of his effective speech-making skills.
