"The Regina Monologues" is the fourth episode of The Simpsons fifteenth season, and originally aired November 23, 2003 in the United States. It was written by John Swartzwelder, and directed by Mark Kirkland. The episode sees the Simpson family travel to England on holiday. There, they meet several celebrities including Tony Blair, Evan Marriott, Ian McKellen and J. K. Rowling, who all appear as themselves. Meanwhile Abraham Simpson journeys to find Edwina, his long lost love, who is voiced by Jane Leeves.

==Plot==

Mr. Burns withdraws a $1000 bill from an ATM, but he drops it and an updraft carries it away to the Simpsons' house, where it is found by Bart and Milhouse. Marge makes Bart and Homer put up fliers so that the person who lost the bill can reclaim it. No one can describe it correctly so Lisa suggests that they spend the money on a vacation, but then decide against it because Homer always manages to ruin any trip they go on. After realizing he can make money from the bill, Bart displays it in a museum in his tree house. Mr. Burns visits and reclaims his money, forcing Bart to close his museum. However, Bart has made over $3000 from the museum so they decide to spend the money on a vacation for Marge. Grampa suggests they go to London, where he hopes to meet his long-lost love Edwina. During World War II, he made love to her after claiming he was going out to the front lines the next day, not realising that he was shipping out the next day (D-Day).
Upon their arrival in London the family is greeted by Tony Blair, whom Homer mistakes for Mr. Bean. They visit London's tourist attractions, and later meet J. K. Rowling and Ian McKellen. Grampa tries to contact Edwina whilst Bart and Lisa go on a "sugar rush" after discovering the joys of British chocolate. Homer and Marge rent a Mini Cooper and start to drive around London but get stuck on a roundabout. After literally driving in circles for hours, Homer decides to break out of it, plows straight through the gates of Buckingham Palace and slams into Queen Elizabeth II's horse-drawn carriage.
Homer is put on trial for causing harm to the Queen as well as wrecking her carriage. He calls the Queen an impostor, since her luggage is inscribed "H.R.H." which he believes is short for "Henrietta R. Hippo". The Queen, highly offended, demands that he be executed. He is taken away to the Tower of London to await his execution, where it is planned for his head to be stuck on a pike. The rest of the family call him from outside and Lisa tells him that he can use a secret tunnel that Sir Walter Raleigh built to escape. However, the tunnel leads straight into the Queen's bedroom, and she calls her guards. Homer pleads with the Queen to find it in her heart to forgive him and she allows him to leave the country on the condition that he take Madonna as well. As they prepare to leave, Edwina appears and introduces Grampa to her daughter Abbie, who looks and sounds like an English female version of Homer. Fearing that he is most likely the father, Abe runs away quickly.

==Production==

"The Regina Monologues" is (as of 2012) the last regular episode written by longtime Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder (though Swartzwelder was credited for contributing to the script to The Simpsons Movie).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.simpsonsmovie.com/main.html|title=About the DVD|publisher=The Simpsons Movie.com|accessdate=2007-11-29[/tpl] On the main page, click on "About the DVD" then on "Production Notes".

Tony Blair recorded his part for the episode in April 2003,[tpl]cite news|author= Staff writer|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/11/22/blair.simpsons/index.html|title=Tony Blair a 'Simpsons' guest star|date=2003-11-24|accessdate=2007-05-02|work= CNN.com|publisher=CNN[/tpl] in ten minutes at Downing Street.

The show's staff did not know whether Blair would actually record his lines until showrunner Al Jean and his wife were in London promoting the 300th episode of The Simpsons. They received a call stating: "If you go over to Downing Street tomorrow and can promise to get the recording done in 15 minutes, then the Prime Minister will do it". Jean was "so nervous, it was ridiculous" when he met Blair, an event he has cited as "one of the most fantastic moments of his life". Blair was the top choice to guest star in the episode, but the staff did not think they had a chance to get him to appear. Blair is the only head of government to guest star in the show, with Rudy Giuliani (who played himself in the episode "Stop or My Dog Will Shoot") the only other politician to guest star.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings.aspx?id=20070419fox13|title=Listings|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=The Futon Critic[/tpl]

The writers originally drew up a list of ten British celebrities they wanted to appear in the episode.[tpl]cite news|title=When Homer met Tony for tea and tourist tips at 10 Downing St|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/when-homer-met-tony-for-tea-and-tourist-tips-at-10-downing-st-757576.html|accessdate=2008-08-03|date=2003-11-22|work=The Independent|publisher= Independent News & Media|author=Burrell, Ian[/tpl] The Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams (a fan of the show) was included in a draft of the script acting as a tour guide and showing some of his relatives around London. Williams had to reject the part due to other engagements. The script also included a role for a musician; the staff had hoped to get David Bowie or Morrissey for the part but nothing came together. David and Victoria Beckham were also originally sought to guest star in the episode, and would be seen bickering on the street. The idea was dropped after Blair agreed to guest star, and it was deemed that they were not famous enough in the United States and so were not approached.[tpl]cite news|author= Staff writer|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/tv_film/newsid_2937000/2937711.stm|title=D'oh!

Tony Blair received criticism from a number of commentators for his appearance in the episode due to the fact that he recorded his part at the height of the war in Iraq.[tpl]cite news|title=When Ricky Met Homer|date=2007-05-27|work=The Australian Magazine|author=Viner, Brian; Kerrie Murphy|page=034[/tpl] Sunday Telegraph journalist Jack Roberts noted that it was "not Blair's finest hour".

When Blair left office in 2007, it was reported that his successor as Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, was also being lined up to guest star on the show. Animator Dan Povenmire noted that American audiences would probably require subtitles to understand what Brown was saying.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Audiences-Need-Subtitles-For-Gordon-Brown-On-Simpsons/Article/20080141301871?lpos=Politics_1&lid=ARTICLE_1301871_Audiences%2BNeed%2BSubtitles%2BFor%2BGordon%2BBrown%2BOn%2BSimpsons|title=Audiences Need Subtitles For Gordon Brown On Simpsons|accessdate=2008-07-28|date=2008-01-14|author=Brady, Enda|work=Sky News[/tpl] Voice actress Yeardley Smith noted that she would like Brown to appear in The Simpsons, but Brown ruled a guest role out stating: "I think Tony Blair did that, I don't think that is for me".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/31/arts/EU-A-E-TV-Britain-Brown-Simpsons.php?WT.mc_id=rssap_news|title=Britain's Brown rules out cameo role on "The Simpsons"|accessdate=2008-07-28|date=2007-10-31|work=International Herald Tribune|agency=Associated Press[/tpl] Series creator Matt Groening confirmed that Brown would not be approached for a part.

The episode has become study material for sociology courses at University of California Berkeley, where it is used to "examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show", and to figure out what it is "trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies". Some questions asked in the courses include: [tpl]quotation|â€¢ What aspects of American society are being addressed in the episode? â€¢ What aspects of them are used to make the points? â€¢ How is the satire conveyed: through language? drawing? music? â€¢ Is the behavior of each character consistent with his/her character as developed over the years? â€¢ Can we identify elements of the historical/political context that the writers are satirizing? â€¢ What is the difference between satire and parody?[tpl]cite web|url=http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/undergrads/syllabi/Soc190_1.pdf|publisher=University of California Berkeley|title=The Simpsons Global Mirror |year=2008|author=Thomas B.
