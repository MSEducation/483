[[Sarezzo]]

Sarezzo is a comune in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy. It is located in the Trompia valley. Neighbouring communes are Lumezzane, Villa Carcina, Polaveno and Gardone Val Trompia.  In 2011 its population was 13,547. The comune is made of four frazioni (villages): Sarezzo, Zanano, Ponte Zanano, and Noboli, although today these have grown into each other and there is no visible distinction. Indeed Sarezzo, 13Â km from the city centre of Brescia, is today part its urban area (population 350,000).
