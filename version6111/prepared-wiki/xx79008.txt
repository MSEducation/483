The Mediterranean diet is a modern nutritional recommendation originally inspired by the traditional dietary patterns of Greece, Spain, Italy and Morocco.Alberto Capatti et al., Italian Cuisine: A Cultural History, p. 106.; Silvano Serventi and Francoise Sabban, Pasta, p. 162. The principal aspects of this diet include proportionally high consumption of olive oil, legumes, unrefined cereals, fruits, and vegetables, moderate to high consumption of fish, moderate consumption of dairy products (mostly as cheese and yogurt), moderate wine consumption, and low consumption of meat and meat products."Get your Meds: the Mediterranean Diet and Health", Ellen Gooch, Epikouria Magazine, Fall 2005

Ferro-Luzzi, "The Mediterranean Diet: an attempt to define its present and past composition", European Journal of Clinical Nutrition 43:13-29 (1989) as quoted in Noah, op.cit.
The most commonly understood version of the Mediterranean diet was presented, among others, by Dr Walter Willett of Harvard University's School of Public Health from the mid-1990s on.[ref]

ISBN 0-7432-6642-0 Based on "food patterns typical of Crete, much of the rest of Greece, and southern Italy in the early 1960s", this diet, in addition to "regular physical activity," emphasizes "abundant plant foods, fresh fruit as the typical daily dessert, olive oil as the principal source of fat, dairy products (principally cheese and yogurt), and fish and poultry consumed in low to moderate amounts, zero to four eggs consumed weekly, red meat consumed in low amounts, and wine consumed in low to moderate amounts". Total fat in this diet is 25% to 35% of calories, with saturated fat at 8% or less of calories.
Olive oil is often considered characteristic of the Mediterranean diet, though in Egypt, Malta, and Israel, olive oil consumption is negligible. It contains a very high level of monounsaturated fats, most notably oleic acid, which epidemiological studies suggest may be linked to a reduction in coronary heart disease risk.Keys, A., Menotti, A., Karvonen, M. J., et al. (December 1986). "The diet and 15-year death rate in the seven countries study", Am. J. Epidemiol. 124 (6) 903–15. There is also evidence that the antioxidants in olive oil improve cholesterol regulation and LDL cholesterol reduction, and that it has other anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertensive effects.Covas, M. I., (March 2007). "Olive oil and the cardiovascular system". Pharmacol. Res. 55 (3) 175–86.

==History==

Although it was first publicized in 1945 by the American scientist Ancel Keys stationed in Pioppi, Italy, the Mediterranean diet failed to gain widespread recognition until the 1990s. Objective data showing that Mediterranean diet is healthy, first originated from the Seven Countries Study.
Mediterranean diet is based on what from the point of view of mainstream nutrition is considered a paradox: that although the people living in Mediterranean countries tend to consume relatively high amounts of fat, they have far lower rates of cardiovascular disease than in countries like the United States, where similar levels of fat consumption are found. A parallel phenomenon is known as the French Paradox.Bruno Simini, "Serge Renaud: from French paradox to Cretan miracle" The Lancet 355:9197:48 (1 January 2000) at Science Direct (subscription)
A diet rich in salads was promoted in England during the early Renaissance period by Giacomo Castelvetro in A Brief Account of the Fruits, Herbs, and Vegetables of Italy.Castelvetro. G., The Fruits, Herbs, and Vegetables of Italy, London, Viking, 1989, translated from the original published in 1614. He attempted, without success, to convince the English to eat more fruits and vegetables.

==Health effects==

A number of diets have received attention, but the strongest evidence for a beneficial health effect and decreased mortality after switching to a largely plant based diet comes from studies of Mediterranean diet, e.g. from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.[tpl]cite journal|title=Mediterranean dietary pattern and prediction of all-cause mortality in a US population: results from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study|authors=Mitrou PN, Kipnis V, Thiébaut AC, Reedy J, Subar AF, Wirfält E, Flood A, Mouw T, Hollenbeck AR, Leitzmann MF, Schatzkin A|journal=Arch Intern Med|date=2007-12-10|volume=167|issue=22|pages=2461–8|doi=10.1001/archinte.167.22.2461[/tpl]
The Mediterranean diet often is cited as beneficial for being low in saturated fat and high in monounsaturated fat and dietary fiber. One of the main explanations is thought to be the health effects of olive oil included in the Mediterranean diet.
The Mediterranean diet is high in salt content.[tpl]cite journal|author=C. Leclercq and A. Ferro-Luzzi|date=Mar 1991|title=Total and domestic consumption of salt and their determinants in three regions of Italy|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=45|issue=3|pages=151–9|pmid=2065639[/tpl] Foods such as olives, salt-cured cheeses, anchovies, capers, and salted fish roe all contain high levels of salt.
The inclusion of red wine is considered a factor contributing to health as it contains flavonoids with powerful antioxidant properties.[tpl]cite journal |author=Baron-Menguy C, Bocquet A, Guihot AL, et al. |title=Effects of red wine polyphenols on postischemic neovascularization model in rats: low doses are proangiogenic, high doses anti-angiogenic |journal=FASEB J. |volume=21 |issue=13 |pages=3511–21 |date=November 2007 |pmid=17595348 |doi=10.1096/fj.06-7782com [/tpl] "Chemical In Red Wine, Fruits, And Vegetables May Stop Cancer, Heart Disease, Depending On The Dose." ScienceDaily 1 November 2007.
Dietary factors are only part of the reason for the health benefits enjoyed by certain Mediterranean cultures. A healthy lifestyle (notably a physically active lifestyle or labour) is also beneficial.Cardiovascular disease risk factors: epidemiology and risk assessment. Dahlöf B. Am J Cardiol. 2010 Jan 4;105(1 Suppl):3A-9A."Resistance exercise in individuals with and without cardiovascular disease: 2007 update: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association Council on Clinical Cardiology and Council on Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Metabolism".

"Circulation". 2007 Jul 31;116(5) 572-84. Environment may also be involved. However, on the population level, i.e. for the population of a whole country or a region, the influence of genetics is rather minimal, because it was shown that the slowly changing habits of Mediterranean populations, from a healthy active lifestyle and Mediterranean diet to a not so healthy, less physically active lifestyle and a diet influenced by the Western pattern diet, significantly increases risk of heart disease."Cardiovascular disease risk factors and dietary habits of farmers from Crete 45 years after the first description of the Mediterranean diet".

A 2011 systematic review found that a Mediterranean diet appeared to be more effective than a low-fat diet in bringing about long-term changes to cardiovascular risk factors, such as lowering cholesterol level and blood pressure.[tpl]cite journal|last=Nordmann|first=AJ|coauthors=Suter-Zimmermann, K; Bucher, HC; Shai, I; Tuttle, KR; Estruch, R; Briel, M|title=Meta-analysis comparing Mediterranean to low-fat diets for modification of cardiovascular risk factors.|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|date=September 2011|volume=124|issue=9|pages=841–51.e2|pmid=21854893|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0034482/|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2011.04.024[/tpl]

The putative benefits of the Mediterranean diet for cardiovascular health are primarily correlative in nature; while they reflect a very real disparity in the geographic incidence of heart disease, identifying the causal determinant of this disparity has proven difficult. The most popular dietary candidate, olive oil, has been undermined by a body of experimental evidence that diets enriched in monounsaturated fats such as olive oil are not atheroprotective when compared to diets enriched in either polyunsaturated or even saturated fats.[tpl]cite journal |author=Brown JM, Shelness GS, Rudel LL |title=Monounsaturated fatty acids and atherosclerosis: opposing views from epidemiology and experimental animal models |journal=Curr Atheroscler Rep |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=494–500 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18377790 |doi=10.1007/s11883-007-0066-8 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Rudel LL, Kelley K, Sawyer JK, Shah R, Wilson MD |title=Dietary monounsaturated fatty acids promote aortic atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-null, human ApoB100-overexpressing transgenic mice |journal=Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=1818–27 |pmid=9812923 |url=http://atvb.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/18/11/1818 |date= November 1, 1998 |doi=10.1161/01.atv.18.11.1818[/tpl]
A recently emerging alternative hypothesis to the Mediterranean diet is that differential exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation accounts for the disparity in cardiovascular health between residents of Mediterranean and more northerly countries. The proposed mechanism is solar UVB-induced synthesis of Vitamin D in the oils of the skin, which has been observed to reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease, and which rapidly diminishes with increasing latitude.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wong A |title=Incident solar radiation and coronary heart disease mortality rates in Europe |journal=Eur J Epidemiol. |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=609–14 |year=2008 |pmid=18704704 |doi=10.1007/s10654-008-9274-y [/tpl] Interestingly, residents of the Mediterranean are also observed to have very low rates of skin cancer (which is widely believed to be caused by over-exposure to solar UV radiation); incidence of melanomas in the Mediterranean countries is lower than in Northern Europe and significantly lower than in other hot countries such as Australia and New Zealand.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] Its been hypothesized that some components of the Mediterranean diet may provide protection against skin cancer.
A study published in the Archives of General Psychiatry shows that people who followed the Mediterranean diet were less likely to develop depression.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sanchez-Villegas|first=A.|coauthors=Delgado-Rodriguez, M., Alonso, A., Schlatter, J., Lahortiga, F., Serra Majem, L., Martinez-Gonzalez, M.

==Medical research==

The Seven Countries Study[tpl]cite journal |author= |title=Coronary heart disease in seven countries |journal=Circulation |volume=41 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=I1–211 |date=April 1970 |pmid=5442782 [/tpl] found that Cretan men had exceptionally low death rates from heart disease, despite moderate to high intake of fat. The Cretan diet is similar to other traditional Mediterranean diets, consisting mostly of olive oil, bread, abundant fruit and vegetables, fish, and a moderate amount of dairy foods and red wine.
The Lyon Diet Heart Study[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4655 |title=Lyon Diet Heart Study[/tpl] set out to mimic the Cretan diet, but adopted a pragmatic approach. Realizing that some of the people in the study (all of whom had survived a first heart attack) would be reluctant to move from butter to olive oil, they used a margarine based on rapeseed (canola) oil. The dietary change also included 20% increases in vitamin C-rich fruit and bread and decreases in processed and red meat. On this diet, mortality from all causes was reduced by 70%. This study was so successful that the ethics committee decided to stop it prematurely so that the results could be made public immediately.[tpl]cite journal | author=de Lorgeril M, Salen P, Martin JL, Monjaud I, Delaye J, Mamelle N. | title=Mediterranean diet, traditional risk factors, and the rate of cardiovascular complications after myocardial infarction: final report of the Lyon Diet Heart Study | journal=Circulation | year=1999 | volume=99 | issue=6 | pages=779–85 | pmid=9989963 | doi=10.1161/01.cir.99.6.779[/tpl]
According to a 2008 study published in BMJ, the traditional Mediterranean diet provides substantial protection against type 2 diabetes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Martínez-González MA, de la Fuente-Arrillaga C, Nunez-Cordoba JM, et al. |title=Adherence to Mediterranean diet and risk of developing diabetes: prospective cohort study |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7657 |pages=1348–51 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18511765 |pmc=2427084 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39561.501007.BE [/tpl] The study involved over 13 000 graduates from the University of Navarra in Spain with no history of diabetes, who were recruited between December 1999 and November 2007, and whose dietary habits and health were subsequently tracked. Participants initially completed a 136-item food frequency questionnaire designed to measure the entire diet. The questionnaire also included questions on the use of fats and oils, cooking methods and dietary supplements. Every two years participants were sent follow-up questionnaires on diet, lifestyle, risk factors, and medical conditions. New cases of diabetes were confirmed through medical reports. During the follow-up period (median 4.4 years) the researchers from the University of Navarra found that participants who stuck closely to the diet had a lower risk of diabetes. A high adherence to the diet was associated with an 83% relative reduction in the risk of developing diabetes.The Traditional Mediterranean Diet Protects Against Diabetes Newswise, Retrieved on July 2, 2008.
A 2008 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine examined the effects of three diets: low-carb, low-fat, and Mediterranean. The study involved 322 participants and lasted for two years. The low-carb and Mediterranean diet resulted in the greatest weight loss, 12 lbs and 10 lbs, respectively. The low-fat diet resulted in a loss of 7 lbs. One caveat of the study is that 86% of the study participants were men. The low-carb and Mediterranean diets produced similar amounts of weight loss in the overall study results and in the men. In the remaining participants who were women, the Mediterranean diet produced 3.8 kg (8.4 lbs) more weight loss on average than the low-carb diet. However, the low-carb diet produced more favorable changes in blood lipids.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shai I, Schwarzfuchs D, Henkin Y, Shahar DR, Witkow S, Greenberg I, Golan R, Fraser D, Bolotin A, Vardi H, Tangi-Rozental O, Zuk-Ramot R, Sarusi B, Brickner D, Schwartz Z, Sheiner E, Marko R, Katorza E, Thiery J, Fiedler GM, Blüher M, Stumvoll M, Stampfer MJ; Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (DIRECT) Group. |title=Weight loss with a low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean, or low-fat diet. |journal=N Engl J Med |date=July 17, 2008 |pmid=18635428 |volume=359 |pages=229–241 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0708681 |issue=3[/tpl]
A meta-analysis published in BMJ in 2008 showed that following strictly the Mediterranean diet reduced the risk of dying from cancer and cardiovascular disease as well as the risk of developing Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The results report 9%, 9%, and 6% reduction in overall, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality respectively. Additionally a 13% reduction in incidence of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases is to be expected provided strict adherence to the diet is observed. As well, a 2007 study found that adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MeDi) may affect not only risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) but also subsequent disease course: Higher adherence to the MeDi is associated with lower mortality in AD. The gradual reduction in mortality risk for higher MeDi adherence tertiles suggests a possible dose-response effect.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/69/11/1084 |title=Mediterranean diet and Alzheimer disease mortality - Scarmeas et al. 69 (11): 1084 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000277320.50685.7c |publisher=Neurology |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2010-08-27[/tpl] [tpl]See also|Alzheimer's disease and diet[/tpl]
A study published in the BMJ in 2009 showed some components of the Mediterranean diet, such as high vegetable consumption and low meat and meat product consumption, are more significantly associated with low risk of mortality than other components, such as cereal consumption and fish consumption. As part of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study, researchers followed more than 23,000 Greek men and women for 8.5 years to see how various aspects of a Mediterranean diet affect mortality. Moderate alcohol consumption, high fruit and nut consumption, and high legume consumption were also associated with lower risk of mortality.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/338/jun23_2/b2337?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=mediterranean&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=date&resourcetype=HWCIT |title=Anatomy of health effects of Mediterranean diet: Greek EPIC prospective cohort study[/tpl]
Mediterranean Diet, articulated into extensive lifestyles interventions in a clinical follow-up study, improves renal artery circulation, decreasing renal resistive index, even without significant modifications of Insulin Resistance. This is a beneficial effect and modifies the pathophysiology of essential hypertension.
Another study reported in February 2010 found that the diet may help keep the brain healthy by reducing the frequency of mini-strokes that can contribute to mental decline.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.health.com/2010/02/08/mediterranean-diet-may-help-keep-you-smarter/ |title=Mediterranean Diet May Help Keep You Smarter - Health News - Health.com |publisher=News.health.com |date=2010-02-08 |accessdate=2010-08-27[/tpl]
Mediterranean Diet is becoming a comprehensive popular and successful translational paradigm for the promotion of healthier lifestyles.
A 2011 meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology analyzed the results of 50 studies (35 clinical trials, 2 prospective and 13 cross-sectional) covering about 535,000 people to examine the effect of a Mediterranean diet on metabolic syndrome. The researchers reported that a Mediterranean diet is associated with lower blood pressure, blood sugar, and triglycerides.
A 2012 follow-up study in Israel, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that even people who regain some weight after going on a Mediterranean diet can derive lasting benefits from it.[tpl]cite news |author=Judy Siegel-Itzkovich |date=October 10, 2012 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Health/Article.aspx?id=287200 |title=Mediterranean diet has long-term positive effects |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=February 19, 2014[/tpl]
A meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2013 compared Mediterranean, vegan, vegetarian, low-glycemic index, low-carbohydrate, high-fiber, and high-protein diets with control diets. The research concluded that Mediterranean, low-carbohydrate, low-glycemic index, and high-protein diets are effective in improving markers of risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
A recent randomized Spanish trial of diet pattern published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2013 followed almost 7,500 individuals over around 5 years found that individuals on a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts and olive oil had a 30 percent reduction in risk of having a major cardiovascular event and a 49 percent decrease in stroke risk. Subjects followed one of three different diets. They included either a low fat diet, a Mediterranean diet with 50 ml of extra virgin olive oil daily or a Mediterranean diet with 30 grams of mixed nuts. The nuts were primarily walnuts which have a high amount of omega-3 fatty acids.
Recently, an observational study published, November 5, 2013, in Annals of Internal Medicine concluded that following a Mediterranean diet might help middle-aged women to live longer and thrive. The study was a 15 years long observational study done to examine the association between dietary patterns at midlife and health in aging. The participants in this study were 10,670 women with dietary data and no major chronic diseases between 1984 and 1986. In addition, all the women were in their late 50s and early 60s. After reviewing the data of 15 years, researchers in this study calculated the outcomes and reported that middle-aged women who followed the Mediterranean diet had a 40% more chance to live up to age 70, compared with other participants who followed a dissimilar eating style.Landmark Studies on the Mediterranean Diet Published in 2013 [tpl]cite journal |author=Samieri C, Sun Q, Townsend MK, Chiuve SE, Okereke OI, Willett WC, Stampfer M, Grodstein F. |title=The association between dietary patterns at midlife and health in aging: an observational study |journal=Ann Intern Med |volume=159 |issue=9 |pages=584–91 |date=November 2013 |pmid=24189593 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-159-9-201311050-00004 [/tpl]
