[[Circumcision and law]]

CATEGORIES: Circumcision debate, Tort law, Common law, Children's rights

There exist laws restricting or regulating circumcision, some dating back to ancient times.  In a number of modern states, circumcision is presumed to be legal, but under certain circumstances, more general laws, such as laws about assault or child custody, may sometimes be interpreted as applying to situations involving circumcision.  Some countries have placed restrictions on circumcision.

==History==

There are ancient religious requirements for circumcision. The Hebrew Bible commands Jews to circumcise their male children on the eighth day of life, and to circumcise their male slaves ([tpl]bibleverse||Genesis|17:11–12|HE[/tpl]).
Laws banning circumcision are also ancient. The ancient Greeks prized the foreskin and disapproved of the Jewish custom of circumcision.[tpl]cite journal |last=Hodges |first=Frederick M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |month= |title=The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme |journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine |volume=75 |issue= 3|pages=375–405 |id= |url=http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/ |accessdate=22 January 2008 |quote=|doi=10.1353/bhm.2001.0119 |pmid=11568485[/tpl] 1 Maccabees, 1:60–61 states that King Antiochus IV of Syria, the occupying power of Judea in 170 BCE, outlawed circumcision on penalty of death.1 Maccabees, 1:60–61 one of the grievances leading to the Maccabean Revolt.
According to the Historia Augusta, the Roman emperor Hadrian issued a decree banning circumcision in the empire,The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome and some modern scholars argue that this was a main cause of the Jewish Bar Kokhba revolt of 132 CE.See, e.g., Alfredo M. Rabello, The Ban on Circumcision as a Cause of Bar Kokhba's Rebellion, 29 ISRAEL L. REV. 176 (1995) (Arguing that the Bar Kokhba rebellion against Roman rule was primarily motivated by the superimposition of foreign religious standards, rather than by some important notion of independence or sovereignty). The Roman historian Cassius Dio, however, made no mention of such a law, and blamed the Jewish uprising instead on Hadrian's decision to rebuild Jerusalem as Aelia Capitolina, a city dedicated to Jupiter.
Antoninus Pius permitted Jews to circumcise their own sons. However, he forbade the circumcision of non-Jews that were either foreign-slaves or non-Jewish members of the household, contrary to [tpl]bibleverse||Genesis|17:12|HE[/tpl] He also made it illegal for a man to convert to Judaism.Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2004.03.29 Antoninus Pius exempted the Egyptian priesthood from the otherwise universal ban on circumcision.

===Australia===

In 1993, a non-binding research paper of the Queensland Law Reform Commission (Circumcision of Male Infants) concluded that "On a strict interpretation of the assault provisions of the Queensland Criminal Code, routine circumcision of a male infant could be regarded as a criminal act", and that doctors who perform circumcision on male infants may be liable to civil claims by that child at a later date.QLRC: Circumcision of Male Infants No prosecutions have occurred in Queensland, and circumcisions continue to be performed.
In a case of sexual assault in Queensland, Australia (1997), a district court awarded a man damages for nervous shock after a botched attempt to circumcise him with a broken beer bottle in a drunken attack.

In 2002, Queensland police charged a father with grievous bodily harm for having his two sons, then aged nine and five, circumcised without the knowledge and against the wishes of the mother. The mother and father were in a family court dispute. The charges were dropped when the police prosecutor revealed that he did not have all family court paperwork in court and the magistrate refused to grant an adjournment.Mother's Fury as Boys Circumcised

===Bulgaria===

Male circumcision was very strongly discouraged in Bulgaria in the 1980s as part of attempts to pressure the country's Muslim minority but there was no actual legislation against the practice.'Under the Fez and the Foreskin', p113, The Orient Within (Cornell University Press, 2004) http://theorientwithin.com/

Male circumcision has traditionally been presumed to be legal under British law,[tpl]cite book |title=English Criminal Law and Ethnic Minority Customs |last=Poulter |first=Sebastian |publisher=Butterworths,London |isbn=0-406-18000-8 |year=1986 |url=http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/poulter/|quote= , no amount of parental agreement or support can legitimise the circumcision, excision or infibulation of a young girl in this country, unless the operation is for therapeutic purposes.[/tpl] however some authors have argued that there is no solid foundation for this view in English law.A covenant with the status quo? Male circumcision and the new BMA guidance to doctorsChristopher Price M.A.(Oxon), Male Circumcision: An Ethical and Legal Affront, 1997 http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/price/#n18
The passage of the Human Rights Act 1998 has led to some speculation that the lawfulness of the circumcision of male children is unclear.Circumcision After the Human Rights Act 1998
One 1999 case, Re "J" (child's religious upbringing and circumcision)Re J (child's religious upbringing and circumcision) said that circumcision in Britain required the consent of all those with parental responsibility, or the permission of the court, acting for the best interests of the child, and issued an order prohibiting the circumcision of a male child of a non-practicing Muslim father and non-practicing Christian mother with custody. The reasoning included evidence that circumcision carried some medical risk; that the operation would be likely to weaken the relationship of the child with his mother, who strongly objected to circumcision without medical necessity; that the child may be subject to ridicule by his peers as the odd one out and that the operation might irreversibly reduce sexual pleasure, by permanently removing some sensory nerves, even though cosmetic foreskin restoration might be possible. The court did not rule out circumcision against the consent of one parent. It cited a hypothetical case of a Jewish mother and an agnostic father with a number of sons, all of whom, by agreement, had been circumcised as infants in accordance with Jewish laws; the parents then have another son who is born after they have separated; the mother wishes him to be circumcised like his brothers; the father refuses his agreement. In such a case, a decision in favor of circumcision was said to be likely.
In 2001 the General Medical Council had found a doctor who had botched circumcision operations guilty of abusing his professional position and that he had acted "inappropriately and irresponsibly",[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1502729.stm | work=BBC News | title=Circumcision doctors 'abused position' | date=21 August 2001 | accessdate=30 April 2010[/tpl] and struck him off the register.Circumcision case GP told he can resume career A doctor who had referred patients to him, and who had pressured a mother into agreeing to the surgery, was also condemned. He was put on an 18-month period of review and retraining, and was allowed to resume unrestricted practice as a doctor in March 2003, after a committee found that he had complied with conditions it placed on him. According to the Northern Echo, he "told the committee he has now changed his approach to circumcision referrals, accepting that most cases can be treated without the need for surgery.".
Fox and Thomson (2005) argue that consent cannot be given for non-therapeutic circumcision. They say there is "no compelling legal authority for the common view that circumcision is lawful."
In 2005 a Muslim man had his son circumcised against the wishes of the child's mother who was the custodial parent. He was found not guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm by a majority verdict of the jury.icNetwork – Local and regional news, sport, entertainment and classifieds across the UK[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=4497150 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050523125330/http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=4497150 | archivedate=23 May 2005 | title=Muslim Accused of Assaulting Son Through Circumcision | date=3 May 2005 | accessdate=5 June 2011 | first=James | last=Tapsfield | publisher=The Scotsman | location=Edinburgh[/tpl]

===Finland===

In August 2006, a Finnish court ruled that the circumcision of a four-year-old boy arranged by his mother, who is Muslim, to be an illegal assault. The boy's father, who had not been consulted, reported the incident to the police.  A local prosecutor stated that the prohibition of circumcision is not gender-specific in Finnish law.  A lawyer for the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health stated that there is neither legislation nor prohibition on male circumcision, and that "the operations have been performed on the basis of common law."  The case was appealed[tpl]cite web |title=Court rules circumcision of four-year-old boy illegal |url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Court+rules+circumcision+of+four-year-old+boy+illegal/1135220958830[/tpl] and in October 2008 the Finnish Supreme Court ruled that the circumcision, " carried out for religious and social reasons and in a medical manner, did not have the earmarks of a criminal offence. It pointed out in its ruling that the circumcision of Muslim boys is an established tradition and an integral part of the identity of Muslim men".Supreme Court: Male Circumcision Not A Crime | Yle Uutiset | yle.fi In 2008, the Finnish government was reported to be considering a new law to legalise circumcision if the practitioner is a doctor and if the child consents.

In February 2010, a Jewish couple were fined for causing bodily harm to their then infant son who was circumcised in 2008 by a mohel brought in from the UK. Normal procedure for persons of Jewish faith in Finland is to have a locally certified mohel who works in Finnish healthcare perform the operation. In the 2008 case, the infant was not anesthetized and developed complications that required immediate hospital care. The parents were ordered to pay 1500 euros in damages to their child.

In 2004, a 22-year-old Rastafarian convert was forcibly circumcised by a group of Xhosa tribal elders and relatives. When he first fled, two police returned him to those who had circumcised him. In another case, a medically circumcised Xhosa man was forcibly recircumcised by his father and community leaders. He laid a charge of unfair discrimination on the grounds of his religious beliefs, seeking an apology from his father and the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa. According to South African newspapers, the subsequent trial became "a landmark case around forced circumcision."

The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare reviewed the law in 2005 and recommended that it be maintained, but found that the law had failed with regard to the intended consequence of increasing the safety of circumcisions. A later report by the Board criticised the low level of availability of legal circumcisions, partly due to reluctance among health professionals. To remedy this, the report suggested a new law obliging all county councils to offer non-therapeutic circumcision in their hospitals,[tpl]Cite report |title=Omskärelse av pojkar |url=http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/publikationer2007/2007-107-7 |month=March |year=2007 |publisher=National Board of Health and Welfare |language=Swedish |docket=2007-107-7 [/tpl] but this was later abandoned in favour of a non-binding recommendation.

===United States===

Circumcision of adults who grant personal informed consent for the surgical operation is not at issue and is unquestionably lawful.
In the United States, non-therapeutic circumcision of male children has long been assumed to be lawful in every jurisdiction provided that one parent grants surrogate informed consent, however Adler (2013) has recently challenged the validity of this assumption.Peter W. Adler. Is Circumcision Legal? 16(3) Richmond J. L. & Pub. Int. 439 (2013). As with every country, doctors who circumcise children must take care that all applicable rules regarding informed consent and safety are satisfied.J. Steven Svoboda, Robert S. Van Howe, James G. Dwyer, Informed Consent for Neonatal Circumcision: An Ethical and Legal Conundrum. 17 J Contemporary Health Law Policy 61 (2000)

Disputes between parents
Occasionally the courts are asked to make a ruling when parents cannot agree on whether or not to circumcise a child.
In January 2001 a dispute between divorcing parents in New Jersey was resolved when the mother, who sought to have the boy circumcised withdrew her request. The boy had experienced two instances of foreskin inflammation and she wanted to have him circumcised. The father, who had experienced a traumatic circumcision as a child objected and they turned to the courts for a decision. The Medical Society of New Jersey and the Urological Society of New Jersey both opposed any court ordered medical treatment. As the parties came to an agreement, no precedent was set.Accord Not To Circumcise Son Still Leaves Heated Legal Debate In June 2001 a Nevada court settled a dispute over circumcision between two parents but put a strict gag order on the terms of the settlement.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/cgi-bin/printable.cgi?/lvrj_home/2001/Jun-25-Mon-2001/news/16387263.html|title=Gag order issued|last=Thevemot|first=Carri Geer|date=25 June 2001|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal[/tpl] In July 2001 a dispute between parents in Kansas over circumcision was resolved when the mother's request to have the infant circumcised was withdrawn. In this case the father opposed circumcision while the mother asserted that not circumcising the child was against her religious beliefs. (The woman's pastor had stated that circumcision was "important" but was not necessary for salvation.) On 24 July 2001 the parents reached agreement that the infant would not be circumcised.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cirp.org/news/wichitaeagle07-24-01 |title=Agreement reached in circumcision case |date=25 July 2001 |publisher=The Wichita Eagle |accessdate=30 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cirp.org/news/wichitaeagle07-13-01/ |title=Wichitans fight over their son's circumcision |author=Alex Branch |date=13 July 2001 |publisher=The Wichita Eagle[/tpl]

In October 2006 a judge in Chicago granted an injunction blocking the circumcision of a 9-year-old boy. In granting the injunction the judge stated that "the boy could decide for himself whether to be circumcised when he turns 18."
In November 2007, the Oregon Supreme Court heard arguments from a divorced Oregon couple over the circumcision of their son. The father wanted his son, who turned 13 on 2 March 2008, to be circumcised in accordance with the father's religious views; the child's mother opposes the procedure.  The parents dispute whether the boy is in favor of the procedure. A group opposed to circumcision filed briefs in support of the mother's position, while some Jewish groups filed a brief in support of the father.[tpl]cite news |last=Gerstein |first=Josh |title=Ore.

Other disputes
In September 2004 the North Dakota Supreme Court rejected a mother's attempt to prosecute her doctor for circumcising her child without fully informing her of the consequences of the procedure. The judge and jury found that the defendants were adequately informed of possible complications, and the jury further found that it is not incumbent on the doctors to describe every "insignificant" risk.

===USSR===

Before glasnost, according to an article in The Jewish Press, Jewish ritual circumcision was forbidden in the USSR.Barbara Oka, "Soviet Jews Of All Ages Seek Circumcision", The Jewish Press, 14 March 1991. However, David E. Fishman, professor of Jewish History at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, states that, whereas the heder and yeshiva, the organs of Jewish education, "were banned by virtue of the law separating church and school, and subjected to tough police and administrative actions," circumcision was not proscribed by law or suppressed by executive measures.David E. Fishman, "Judaism in the USSR, 1917–1930: The Fate of Religious Education," in: Yaacov Ro'i, ed., Jews and Jewish Life in Russia and the Soviet Union (Cummings Center Series; London: Cass, 1995), 251–262; pp. 251–252.
Jehoshua A. Gilboa writes that while circumcision was not officially or explicitly banned, pressure was exerted to make it difficult. Mohels in particular were concerned that they could be punished for any health issue that might develop, even if it arose some time after the circumcision."There was no official prohibition of circumcision and, on the whole, even the propaganda attacks on it were relatively restrained, apparently out of consideration for the presence of many millions of Moslems ... in the Soviet Union. But at the same time numerous pressures were exerted to make observance of this precept circumcision difficult. Needless to say, Jewish members of the Communist Party were in an embarrassing situation when they personally faced the question whether to circumcise their sons ... And the uncertainty weighed heaviest on the mohalim themselves ... Any health problem developing in the baby some time after circumcision could serve to incriminate the mohel. It is easy to imagine, for example, the impact of news items on the death of children because of ... circumcision (and the punishments imposed on mohalim), even if there were no explicit legal bans on circumcision." Jehoshua A. Gilboa, A Language Silenced: The Suppression of Hebrew Literature and Culture in the Soviet Union (London: Associated University Press, 1982), pp. 34–35.
