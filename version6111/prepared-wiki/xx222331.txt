==History==

The area that makes up the Newtown-Stephensburg Historic District was originally settled in 1734 by German settler Peter Stephens.  Stephens travelled from Pennsylvania with Joist Hite in 1732.  Hite's grandson, Issac Hite, Jr. would later build the Belle Grove Plantation in nearby Middletown, Virginia.
Peter Stephens son, Lewis Stephens, was the owner of the original [tpl]convert|900|acre|km2[/tpl] that made up the town of Stephensburgh, as it was called when chartered and founded in September 1758.
Stephensburgh would become the second oldest town in the Shenandoah Valley (behind nearby Winchester, Virginia).  Since its beginnings, the town would be a commercial hub along the "Great Philadelphia Wagon Road" (what is now today U.S. Route 11) and the "Old Dutch Wagon Road" (what is today State Route 277).  Because Routes 11 and 277 were two very heavily traveled arteries through the 19th and 20th centuries, the town's businesses oriented towards transportation from the nationally known "Newtown Wagon" companies for the 1800s to today numerous service centers and eateries.
The historical integrity of the individual buildings and the general townscape that make up this historic area is impressive; little to no new construction has taken place in this area since the early 1940s.
