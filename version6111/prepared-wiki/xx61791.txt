Field Marshal Julian Hedworth George Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy [tpl]Post-nominals|post-noms=GCB GCMG MVO DCO[/tpl] (11 September 1862 – 6 June 1935) was a British Army officer who served as Governor General of Canada, the 12th since Canadian Confederation.
Known to friends as "Bungo", he was born to a noble family in Hertsmere, England, and educated at Eton College, along with his brothers. Upon graduation, Byng received a commission as a militia officer and thereafter saw service in Egypt and Sudan before he enrolled in the Staff College at Camberley. There, he befriended individuals who would be his contemporaries when he attained senior rank in France. Following distinguished service during World War I—specifically, with the British Expeditionary Force in France, in the Battle of Gallipoli, as commander of the Canadian Corps at Vimy Ridge, and as commander of the British Third Army—Byng was in 1919 himself elevated to the peerage. He was in 1921 appointed as governor general by King George V, on the recommendation of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Lloyd George, to replace the Duke of Devonshire as viceroy, and occupied that post until succeeded by the Viscount Willingdon in 1926. Byng proved to be popular with Canadians, due to his war leadership, though his stepping directly into political affairs became the catalyst for widespread changes to the role of the Crown in all of the British Dominions.
After the end of his viceregal tenure, Byng returned to the United Kingdom and there served as the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis and was promoted within the peerage to become Viscount Byng of Vimy. Three years after being appointed as a field-marshal, Byng died at his home on 6 June.

==Early life==

Byng was born at the family seat of Wrotham Park, in Hertsmere, as the seventh son and 13th and youngest child of the Earl of Strafford, who due to the size of his family ran a relatively frugal household, and Harriet Elizabeth Cavendish, daughter of the Lord Chesham.[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| p=2-3[/tpl] Until the age of 12, Byng was enrolled at Eton College, though he did not enter the sixth form. While it was at Eton that Byng first received the nickname "Bungo"—to distinguish him from his elder brothers "Byngo" and "Bango"[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| p=5[/tpl]—his time at the college was undistinguished, and he received poor reports; indicative of his attitude towards academics, he once traded his Latin grammar book and his brother Lionel's best trousers to a hawker for a pair of ferrets and a pineapple. Byng later claimed that he had been the school's worst "Scug", the colloquial term for an undistinguished boy.[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| p=6[/tpl]

==Military career==

With three sons already in the army and another already put up for the 7th Queen's Own Hussars, Byng's father did not think he could afford a regular army commission for his youngest son. Thus, at the age of 17, Byng was instead sent into the militia and on 12 December 1879 commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 2nd (Edmonton) Royal Middlesex Rifles.[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=24794| date=23 December 1879| startpage=7536| accessdate=8 April 2009[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|In the book Byng of Vimy: General and Governor General by Jeffrey Williams, Byng's date of commissioning is given as 27 August 1879.|group=n|name=Williams6[/tpl] He was promoted to lieutenant on 23 April 1881.[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=24968| date=3 May 1881| startpage=2118| accessdate=8 April 2009[/tpl] During this period, Byng also developed a liking for theatre and music halls, and by the age of 20 had taken an interest in the banjo.[tpl]Harvnb| Turner| 2005| p=19[/tpl]
At a meeting of the Jockey Club in 1882, Byng's father was asked about his sons by his long-time friend, Prince Edward, Prince of Wales. Upon hearing that Byng had not yet found a permanent career, the Prince offered a place for him in the Prince's own regiment, the 10th Royal Hussars. This was, however, the most expensive regiment in the army, the Earl of Strafford could only afford to give Byng 200 of the necessary 600 pounds he would need each year, and yet, the Prince's offer could not be refused. Byng himself was delighted at the opportunity, as both his uncle, the Lord Chesham, and his cousin, Charles Cavendish, had served in the regiment. By raising finances through buying polo ponies cheaply, using his excellent horsemanship to train them, and then selling them for a profit,[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| p=9[/tpl] Byng was able to transfer to the 10th Royal Hussars on 27 January 1883,[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=25192| date=26 January 1883| startpage=464| accessdate=9 April 2009[/tpl] and less than three months later joined the regiment in Lucknow, India.[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| p=7[/tpl]
It was while the regiment was en route home to the United Kingdom in 1884 that the Hussars were diverted to Sudan to join the Suakin Expedition and Byng, along with the rest of his regiment, on 29 February rode in the first line of the charge at the Battle of El Teb. The attack, which resulted in the deaths of both the squadron's other officers, was unsuccessful,[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| p=13[/tpl] and fighting continued, with Byng's horse being killed under him on 13 March at the Battle of Tamai. Most of the rebels were then dispersed shortly after and, on 29 March, the regiment re-embarked for Britain, arriving on 22 April, and proceeding to their new base at Shorncliffe Army Camp in Kent. During the summer of 1884, Byng spent much of his time playing polo and training recruits and horses, and in July, for his services in Sudan, was mentioned in despatches.[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| p=14[/tpl]
In June 1885, the regiment was relocated to the South Cavalry Barracks at Aldershot, where the Prince of Wales' eldest son, Prince Albert Victor, joined the regiment and thereafter the Prince of Wales and his other son, Prince George, became frequent visitors. Byng struck up a friendship with both Albert Victor and George, but did not socialise with them much outside of army circles. Byng was appointed as the regimental adjutant on 20 October 1886,[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=25635| date=19 October 1886| startpage=5056| accessdate=9 April 2009[/tpl] only nine days before the death of his father, who left Byng a watch and £3,500.[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| pp=15–16[/tpl] The regiment then moved again in 1887 to the barracks at Hounslow, where, after suspecting that contractors were selling him inferior meat, Byng spent several early mornings at the Smithfield market to learn the meat trade, eventually proving his case and having the contractors changed.[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| p=18[/tpl] It was also at this time that Byng became acquainted with the Lord Rowton, who, along with the Guinness Trust, was trying to improve housing for skilled workers in London. Byng accompanied Rowton around the poorest areas of the city and suggested that retired senior soldiers from the rank-and-file be hired to maintain order in the Rowton Houses that Rowton had set up, thus starting a long-lived tradition.[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| pp=18–19[/tpl]

===Staff College===

In 1888, the hussars again moved, this time to York, where Byng kept his men busy by raising successful cricket and football teams. Byng was promoted to captain on 4 January 1890,[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=26018| date=28 January 1890| startpage=476| accessdate=8 April 2009[/tpl] around the time he began to consider entering the Staff College at Camberley. He thus, in order to dedicate his time to preparatory studies, which continued when the regiment moved in 1891 to Ireland, resigned his commission as adjutant and turned down an invitation from Prince Albert Victor to join him in India as an equerry. After being detached for a time in order to serve and gain more experience in the infantry and artillery,[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| pp=19–20[/tpl] Byng sat and passed his entrance exams into the Staff College and secured a nomination in September 1892.[tpl]cite newspaper The Times| articlename=Naval & Military Intelligence| section=Official Appointments and Notices| day_of_week=Friday| date=2 September 1892| page_number=5| issue=33733| column=D[/tpl] A year before Byng entered the college, however, Albert Victor fell victim to the influenza pandemic that raged around the world, and, at the Prince's funeral on 20 January 1892, Byng commanded the pallbearers (all from the 10th Royal Hussars),[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=26254| date=4 February 1892| startpage=602| supp=yes| accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl] which was a significant display of trust shown Byng by the Prince of Wales.[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| p=21[/tpl]
Once Byng was enrolled at the Staff College, he found amongst his fellow students men with whom he would be closely associated more than two decades later—Henry Rawlinson, Henry Hughes Wilson, Thomas D'Oyly Snow, and James Aylmer Lowthorpe Haldane—and in 1894, while en route to visit a friend at Aldershot, travelled with a cadet at the nearby Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Winston Churchill.[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| p=23[/tpl] Byng also journeyed with his class to see the battlefields of the Franco-Prussian War at Alsace-Lorraine and accompanied to the United States one of his lecturers who was compiling information on a book on Stonewall Jackson.[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| p=22[/tpl] By December 1894, Byng graduated from the Staff College and was immediately appointed to command the A Squadron of the hussars. Only three years later, though, the regiment returned to Aldershot and Byng left to become adjutant of the 1st Cavalry Brigade, shortly before becoming the Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General (DAAG) of the Aldershot Command, and was promoted to the rank of major on 4 May 1898.[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| p=24[/tpl] Later that same year, Byng met at a local party Marie Evelyn Moreton, the only daughter of Sir Richard Charles Moreton, who had himself served as comproller at the Canadian royal and viceroyal residence of Rideau Hall, under the then Governor General of Canada the Marquess of Lorne.[tpl]cite web| url=http://archive.gg.ca/gg/fgg/bios/01/byng_e.asp | last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| title=Marshal, The Viscount Byng of Vimy| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=7 April 2009[/tpl] Evelyn, as she was known, later described her early encounters with Byng:
[tpl]cquote|When we met of a morning out riding, if he was free, the fun began—though it wasn't always fun for me because I was bewildered, as he was never the same two days running. Talk of women being mutable—he could have given points and a beating to any one of them! On Monday he would be in his most enchanting mood; Tuesday he would treat me as a pal and a man; Wednesday he would hardly remember that I existed; Thursday he would be icily polite; Friday he would thaw a little and by Saturday be back in Monday's delightful mood! What could anybody make of such vagaries?[tpl]Harvnb| Williams| 1983| pp=24–25[/tpl][/tpl]

===Commanding officer and World War I===

Byng was deployed in November 1899 to South Africa, where he was to act as a provost marshal,[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=27126| date=13 October 1899| startpage=6179| accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl] but was instead immediately given the local rank of lieutenant colonel and tasked with raising and commanding the South African Light Horse during the Second Boer War.[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=27152| date=9 January 1900| startpage=149| accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl] Byng thereafter served on the front lines, during which time he ended up in command of a group of columns, was mentioned in despatches five times, and in November 1900 was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel and in February 1902 to brevet colonel.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=27406 |date=14 February 1902 |startpage=940 |accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl] The beginning of 1902 brought more significant events for Byng, with his return to England in March, his marriage to Evelyn the following month, and in May his appointed to the Royal Victorian Order as a member 4th class.[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=27430| date=2 May 1902| startpage=2933| accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl] However, by the midpoint of the year, Byng was sent back to India to command the 10th Royal Hussars at Mhow and was appointed to the rank of a substantive lieutenant colonel on 11 October 1902.[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=27481| date=10 October 1902| startpage=6410| accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl]
In his first two years of marriage, Byng's wife suffered several miscarriages, resulting in the declaration that she would be unable to bear children. By January 1904, Byng had also, while playing polo, broken his right elbow so severely that it was feared he would have to quit the army. After four months' treatment in England, though, he was pronounced to be again fit for duty and in May became the first commandant of the new cavalry school at Netheravon.[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=27682| date=3 June 1904| startpage=3555| accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl] The posting was to be only a brief one, as, on 11 May 1905, Byng was made commander of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade at Canterbury, with the simultaneous temporary rank of brigadier general and substantive rank of colonel.[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=27827| date=15 August 1905| startpage=5618| accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl] After appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1906, he was again back in Aldershot, in command of the 1st Cavalry Brigade.[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=28012| date=12 April 1907| startpage=2505| 14 April 2009[/tpl]
It was April 1909 when Byng was promoted to major-general and,[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=28238| date=2 April 1909| startpage=2591| accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl] though he was placed on half pay, Byng—with added income from editing the Cavalry Journal and serving as the first north Essex District Commissioner for the Boy Scouts—purchased his first house, Newton Hall, in Dunmow, Essex. He would, however, only reside there for two years, as, exactly the same amount of time after taking command of the East Anglian Infantry Division of the Territorial Force in October 1910,[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=28424| date=14 October 1910| startpage=7254| accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl] Byng became commander of the British troops stationed in Egypt,[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=28663| date=15 November 1912| startpage=8375| accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl] where he remained until the outbreak of the First World War. He then returned briefly to the United Kingdom to take leadership of the 3rd Cavalry Division before going with the British Expeditionary Force to France and the First Battle of Ypres. His actions there were rewarded in March 1915 with appointment as a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George.[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=29102| date=16 March 1915| startpage=2621| accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl]
After three months serving as commander of the Cavalry Corps, beginning in May 1915, at which time he was also made a temporary lieutenant-general,[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=29432| date=7 January 1916| startpage=418| supp=yes|accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl] Byng was off to Gallipoli to head the IX Corps and supervise the successful British, Australian, and New Zealand forces withdrawal from the ill-fated campaign. For this, he was on 1 January 1916 elevated within the Order of the Bath to the rank of Knight Commander,[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=29507| date=14 March 1916| startpage=2872| supp=y| accessdate=9 April 2009[/tpl] but was not allowed much rest, as he spent the next month commanding the Suez Canal defences before returning to the Western Front to lead the XVII Corps. By June, he was in command of the Canadian Corps and was promoted when, for distinguished service, the King made substantive Byng's rank of lieutenant-general. Byng's greatest glory then came when he, along with his subordinate officer, the Canadian Major-General Arthur Currie, led the Canadian victory in April 1917 at the Battle of Vimy Ridge, an historic military milestone for the Dominion that inspired nationalism at home.
In June 1917, and holding the temporary rank of general,[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=30178| date=10 July 1917| startpage=6956| supp=y| accessdate=15 April 2009[/tpl] Byng took command of Britain's largest army, the Third Army, until the cessation of hostilities and, with those troops, conducted at the Battle of Cambrai the first surprise attack using tanks. This was later considered a key turning point in the war and Byng was honoured on 24 November 1917 by having his temporary rank of general made substantive,[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=30398| date=23 November 1917| startpage=12297| supp=y| accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl] as well as being made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1919 New Year's honours.[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=31092| date=31 December 1918| startpage=1| supp=y| accessdate=15 April 2009[/tpl] In the United States, Byng's exploits during World War I were commemorated near the town of Ada, Oklahoma, when a post office and power plant were in 1917 named after him, leading to the later emergence of the town of Byng.[tpl]Cite document| last=Milligan| first=Dorothy| contribution=BYNG| year=2007| title=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture| place=Oklahoma City| publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society| url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/B/BY003.html| accessdate=15 April 2009| ref=harv[/tpl] Further, Byng was in his own right raised on 7 October 1919 to the peerage as Baron Byng of Vimy, of Thorpe-le-Soken in the County of Essex.[tpl]London Gazette| issue=31610| date=21 October 1919| startpage=12890[/tpl] The next month, though he was offered the Southern Command, Byng retired from the military and moved to Thorpe Hall.[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=31640| date=11 November 1919| startpage=13768| supp=y| accessdate=15 April 2009[/tpl]

==Governor General of Canada==

After Byng was made in July 1921 a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Michael and St. George, it was announced on 2 August that King George V had, by commission under the royal sign-manual and signet, approved the recommendation of his British prime minister, David Lloyd George, to appoint Byng as his representative in Canada.[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=32424| date=16 August 1921| startpage=6483| accessdate=16 April 2009[/tpl] The designation of Byng proved less controversial than that of his predecessor, the Duke of Devonshire, due partly to the General's popularity, but also because the practice of prior consultation with the Canadian prime minister had been revived. Byng had not been Meighan's first choice for presentation to the King, since he preferred someone with more civilian credentials. Nevertheless, Byng was eventually chosen because he was both willing and available.[tpl]Cite book| last=Cooke| first=O.A.| last2=Hillmer| first2=Norman| contribution=Byng of Vimy, Julian Hedworth George, Viscount| title=The Canadian Encyclopedia| editor-last=Marsh| editor-first=James H.| place=Toronto| publisher=Historica Foundation of Canada| url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0001146| accessdate=16 April 2009| ref=harv[/tpl]
The Governor General travelled the length and breadth of the country, meeting with Canadians wherever he went. He also immersed himself in Canada's culture and came to particularly love hockey, rarely missing a game played by the Ottawa Senators. He was also fond of the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair, held each year in Toronto, and established the Governor General's Cup to be presented at the competition. Byng was also the first Governor General of Canada to appoint Canadians as his aides-de-camp (one of whom was future Governor General Georges Vanier) and approached his viceregal role with enthusiasm, gaining him popularity with Canadians on top of that received from the men he had commanded on the battlefields of Europe.

===King-Byng Affair===

While it had been acceptable prior to the turn of the 20th century for Canadian governors general to involve themselves in political affairs, being, as they were, representatives of the King in his British Council, Byng's tenure as viceroy of Canada was notable in that he became the first to step directly into political matters since the country had gained a degree of autonomy from the United Kingdom following the First World War: in the summer of 1926 he denied the recommendation of his prime minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, who sought to have parliament dissolved in order to avoid a vote of non-confidence in his government. The Governor General's course of action in what came to be colloquially known as the King-Byng Affair remains debated, though the consensus amongst constitutional historians is that Byng's moves were appropriate under the circumstances. Mackenzie King, however, made much of the scenario and its outcome in the election that eventually followed on 14 September, in which King's Liberal Party gained a majority of seats, seeing King once again appointed as prime minister. At the 1926 Imperial Conference, King then went on to use Byng and his refusal to follow his prime minister's advice as the impetus for widespread constitutional change throughout the British Commonwealth. Byng himself said of the matter: "I have to await the verdict of history to prove my having adopted a wrong course, and this I do with an easy conscience that, right or wrong, I have acted in the interests of Canada and implicated no one else in my decision."[tpl]cite book| last=Nicolson| first=Harold| authorlink=Harold Nicolson| title=King George the Fifth, His Life and Reign| publisher=Constable & Co. Ltd.| year=1952| location=London| pages=475–477| id=ASIN B001YV21JC[/tpl]

==Post-viceregal life==

Byng returned to England on 30 September 1926, and in January 1928 was created Viscount Byng of Vimy, of Thorpe-le-Soken in the County of Essex.[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=33348| date=17 January 1928| startpage=366| accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl] Later that year, he was appointed as the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and,[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=33437| date=9 November 1928| startpage=7302| accessdate=16 April 2009[/tpl] before his retirement in 1931, introduced a number of changes to the force, including a system of promotion based on merit rather than length of service, improvement in discipline, retirement of inefficient senior officers, an irregularity to policemen's beats (which had previously allowed criminals to work out the system), police boxes, the extensive use of police cars, and a central radio control room. In July 1932, Byng was once more promoted in the British military to the rank of field marshal[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=33872| date=11 October 1932| startpage=6416| accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl]—the highest rank an officer can attain—before he died suddenly of an abdominal blockage at Thorpe Hall on 6 June 1935.
Lord Byng of Vimy was buried at the 11th Century Parish Church of St. Leonard in Beaumont-cum-Moze.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.secretwater.org.uk/beaumont.htm|title=The United Benefice of Tendring, Little Bentley and Beaumont-cum-Moze|accessdate=19 May 2013[/tpl]
