Taroona High School is a co-educational state high school located in Taroona, a southern riverside suburb of greater Hobart, the capital of the island state Tasmania. The school has approximately 800 students in grades 7 to 10. In 2003, Taroona High School underwent a major redevelopment. The school's previous principal was David Hamlett, after the departure of Brendan Kelly at the end of 2006. The school caters for students in the southern suburbs of Hobart such as Taroona, Dynnyrne and Sandy Bay but students also come from a wide range of other areas such as West Hobart and Blackmans Bay.  The school's most notable former student is Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark.

Taroona High School is committed to transforming the learning environment of the school to promote innovation, creativity and excellence in all aspects of its operations. Mandatory subjects within the school vary depending on grade.

==Taroona Primary School==

Taroona High School participates a great deal with the Taroona Primary School, its neighbouring school, the two education facilities making up the Taroona Learning Centre. As a result, a large number of Taroona High students come from Taroona Primary School. The Taroona Learning Centre thus provides schooling from K - 10. .http://www.taroonaprimary.tased.edu.au/Handbook%20for%20TPS%20for%202007.doc
