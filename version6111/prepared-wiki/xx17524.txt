[[Pane carasau]]

CATEGORIES: Italian breads, Flatbreads, Cuisine of Sardinia

Pane carasau is a traditional flatbread from Sardinia.
It is thin and crisp, usually in the form of a dish half a meter wide. It is made by taking baked flat bread (made of durum wheat flour, salt, yeast and water), then separating it into two sheets which are baked again. The recipe is very ancient and was conceived for shepherds, who used to stay far from home for months at a time. Pane carasau can last up to one year if it is kept dry. The bread can be eaten either dry or wet (with water, wine, or sauces). 
A similar, yeast-free bread is called carta di musica in Italian, meaning music sheet, in reference to its large and paper-thin shape, which is so thin before cooking that a sheet of music can be read through it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2010/06/21/steam-power-carta-di-musica/|title=Steam power!

Remains of the bread were found in archeological excavations of nuraghi (traditional Sardinian stone buildings) and it was therefore already eaten on the island prior to 1000 BC.
The name of the bread comes from the Sardinian word “carasare”, referring to the crush of bread.
