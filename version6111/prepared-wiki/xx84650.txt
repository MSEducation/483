==Controversies==

===Investigation of alleged irregularities and deception===

At the 2005 British Comedy Awards show, the wrong show received the People's Choice Award.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.britishcomedyawards.com/peopleschoice.html |title=Past Winners: 2005 |work=People's Choice Awards at the British Comedy Awards |publisher=britishcomedyawards.com (official site) |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-05-11[/tpl] The award was "mistakenly given" to Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway even though The Catherine Tate Show received the most tabulated votes and should have been declared the winner, and Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly (Ant & Dec) were asked to return their 2005 award.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7390193.stm|title=Ant and Dec Return Comedy Prize |work=BBC News |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=8 May 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-11 |quote=Ant and Dec are reportedly appalled at the error over the prize caption. ... TV presenters Ant and Dec are to return a prize they were awarded at the 2005 British Comedy Awards after ITV revealed that they did not win. ... The Catherine Tate Show collected more votes for the People's Choice Awards, an independent report on the affair says. ... It is thought that presenter Robbie Williams had been given assurances that Ant and Dec were the winners. ...

ITV gave details of the incident as part of a statement responding to the record fine.[/tpl][tpl]Further|British Comedy Awards 2005#People's Choice Award[/tpl]
Charged by the awards show with investigating the allegations of irregularities, the independent law firm Olswang summarized its findings as follows: "Robbie Williams was invited to present an award. It was understood that he would be happy do so if the recipients were Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly.  In order to ensure his attendance, this assurance was given.  But it could not be definitively established that Williams' involvement led to the wrong winner being announced" added.
Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway did however receive the People's Choice Award at the British Comedy Awards 2006.[tpl]Cite web|title=People's Choice Award 2006 |url=http://www.britishcomedyawards.com/peopleschoice.html |work=British Comedy Awards 2006 |publisher=britishcomedyawards.com |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-05-11[/tpl]

===Phone-in scandal===

Beginning on 26 July 2007, British tabloid newspapers reported the alleged involvement of the British Comedy Awards in the 2007 British television phone-in scandal.  According to a report in The Sun, viewers telephoned a premium-rate number to vote for the People's Choice Award at the 2005 Awards during what was claimed to be a live broadcast; yet, at 22:30, the show went to a news broadcast, so that when the show returned, and viewers thought it was still live and thus still phoned the number, the last half-hour was in fact a recording as the vote had already finished, rendering the call-in votes given during the recording pointless and a misuse of the callers' money.
ITV announced that they postponed the British Comedy Awards 2007 due to the voting irregularities.  In a statement, the company said: "Pending conclusion of the investigation, broadcast of the British Comedy Awards 2007 will be postponed. ... ITV will not make any further comment regarding this matter until the conclusion of the investigation."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30100-1285266,00.html |title=ITV Axes British Comedy Awards |work=Sky News |publisher=sky.com |date=21 September 2007 |accessdate=2008-05-11 |quote=ITV is to drop the British Comedy Awards following the discovery of alleged phone vote irregularities in a previous show.[/tpl]
It was announced on 21 September 2007 that the British Comedy Awards 2007 would not be screened by ITV1; however, it was not confirmed then that the Awards would still take place in December, and it was not ruled out that they could be screened by another channel. The 2007 awards did take place on 5 December 2007, but that show was not televised. In early May 2008 Ofcom announced its fining and sanctioning ITV plc in a press release.
On 15 August 2008, it was announced that a similar scandal could have been committed in the award ceremony at the 2004 Awards.[tpl]Cite news|last=Conlan|first=Tara|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/aug/15/itv.ofcom|title=ITV company faces fine over a second British Comedy Awards deception|publisher=The Guardian|date=15 August 2008|accessdate=2008-08-15[/tpl]
Following The Russell Brand Show prank telephone calls row and his 12-week unpaid suspension from all of his BBC shows, Jonathan Ross resigned from presenting the 2008 awards, in agreement with ITV, as he did not want to "take away from the awards themselves or the many talented winners of the awards." Angus Deayton replaced Jonathan Ross as the host of the British Comedy Awards. Ross returned to presenting the awards in 2009.
