An emirate is a political territory that is ruled by a dynastic Muslim monarch styled emir. It also means principality.

==Etymology==

Etymologically  emirate or amirate ([tpl]Lang-ar|إمارة[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|imārah[/tpl], plural: [tpl]lang|ar|إمارات[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|imārāt[/tpl]) is the quality, dignity, office or territorial competence of any emir (prince, commander, governor etc.).

==As monarchies==

The United Arab Emirates is a federal state that comprises seven federal emirates, each administered by a hereditary emir, these seven forming the electoral college for the federation's President and Prime Minister. As most emirates have either disappeared, been integrated in a larger modern state or changed their rulers' styles, e.g. to malik (Arabic for king) or sultan, such true emirate-states have become rare.

==As provinces==

Furthermore, in Arabic the term can be generalized to mean any province of a country that is administered by a member of the ruling class, especially of a member (usually styled emir) of the royal family, as in Saudi Arabian governorates.

==List of independent Emirates==

==List of former and integrated emirates==

A list of emirates that have either ceased to exist, are not recognized and hold no real power, or were integrated into another country and preserved as "traditional states" arranged by location and in order of the date of the first leader styled "emir."
