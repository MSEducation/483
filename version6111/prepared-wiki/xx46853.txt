Mifepristone (or RU-486) is a synthetic steroid compound with both antiprogesterone and antiglucocorticoid properties. The compound is a 19-nor steroid with substitutions at positions C11 and C17 (17 beta-hydroxy-11 beta-phenyl 17 alpha-1-propynylestra-4,9-dien-3-one), which antagonizes cortisol action competitively at the receptor level.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gallagher P, Young AH | title = Mifepristone (RU-486) treatment for depression and psychosis: a review of the therapeutic implications | journal = Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–42 | date=March 2006 | pmid = 19412444 | pmc = 2671735 | doi = [/tpl]
Mifepristone is a progesterone receptor antagonist used as an abortifacient in the first months of pregnancy, and in smaller doses as an emergency contraceptive. Mifepristone is also a powerful glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, and has occasionally been used in refractory Cushing's Syndrome (due to ectopic/neoplastic ACTH/Cortisol secretion). During early trials, it was known as RU-38486 or simply RU-486, its designation at the Roussel Uclaf company, which designed the drug. The drug was initially made available in France, and other countries then followed—often amid controversy. It is marketed under tradenames Korlym and Mifeprex, according to FDA Orange Book.
Mifepristone was the first antiprogestin to be developed and it has been evaluated extensively for its use as an abortifacient. The original target for the research group, however, was the discovery and development of compounds with antiglucocorticoid properties.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hazra BG, Pore VS | title = Mifepristone (RU-486), the recently developed antiprogesterone drug and its analogues. | journal = J Indian Inst Sci. | year = 2001 | volume = 81 | pages = 287–98.[/tpl] It is these antiglucocorticoid properties that are of great interest in the treatment of severe mood disorders and psychosis. 
It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.[tpl]cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013[/tpl]

Under the FDA-approved regimen, a 600 mg dose is administered by a clinician following a counseling session. Two days later, a clinician administers 400 µg of another medicine, misoprostol, to induce contractions. In European studies, this method terminated 96 to 99% of pregnancies of up to 49 days gestation, but in one large multicenter trial in the United States conducted from September 1994 to September 1995, the efficacy was lower (92%), which the authors of the study suggested may have been due to lack of experience with this method in the United States and/or the design of their study.

Mifepristone can also be used in smaller doses as an emergency contraceptive; if taken after sex but before ovulation, it can prevent ovulation and so prevent pregnancy. In this role, a 10 mg dose is not as effective as the 600 mg dose, but has fewer side-effects.[tpl]cite journal | author = Piaggio G, von Hertzen H, Heng Z, Bilian X, Cheng L | title = Meta-analyses of randomized trials comparing different doses of mifepristone in emergency contraception | journal = Contraception | volume = 68 | issue = 6 | pages = 447–52 | date=December 2003 | pmid = 14698075 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-7824(03)00142-2 [/tpl] Mifeprex and Mifegyne are only available in 200 mg tablets.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wertheimer RE | title = Emergency postcoital contraception | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 62 | issue = 10 | pages = 2287–92 | date=November 2000 | pmid = 11126855 | doi = | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/1115/p2287.html [/tpl]
A review of studies in humans found that the contraceptive effects of the 10 mg dose were probably due mainly to its effects on ovulation, and not inhibition of implantation, but "the knowledge of the mechanism of action remains incomplete". Treatment with 200 mg of mifepristone changes steroid receptor expression in the fallopian tube, inhibits endometrial development, and effectively prevents implantation.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gemzell-Danielsson K, Marions L | title = Mechanisms of action of mifepristone and levonorgestrel when used for emergency contraception | journal = Hum.

==Contraindications==

In clinical trials, nearly all women using mifepristone experienced abdominal pain, uterine cramping, and vaginal bleeding or spotting for an average of 9–16 days. Up to 8% of women experienced some type of bleeding for 30 days or more. Other less common side effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, and fever.[tpl]cite web | title=Mifeprex label | publisher=FDA | url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2005/020687s013lbl.pdf | format=PDF | date=2005-07-19 | accessdate=2006-08-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060628212659/http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2005/020687s013lbl.pdf  |archivedate = 2006-06-28[/tpl] Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a very rare but serious complication.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lawton BA, Rose SB, Shepherd J | title = Atypical presentation of serious pelvic inflammatory disease following mifepristone-induced medical abortion | journal = Contraception | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 431–2 | date=April 2006 | pmid = 16531180 | doi = 10.1016/j.contraception.2005.09.003 [/tpl] Excessive bleeding and incomplete termination of a pregnancy require further intervention by a doctor (such as vacuum aspiration). Between 4.5 and 7.9% of women required surgical intervention in clinical trials. Mifepristone is contraindicated in the presence of an intrauterine device (IUD), as well as with ectopic pregnancy, adrenal failure, hemorrhagic disorders, inherited porphyria, and anticoagulant or long-term corticosteroid therapy.
The FDA prescribing information states that there are no data on the safety and efficacy of mifepristone in women with chronic medical conditions, and that "women who are more than 35 years of age and who also smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day should be treated with caution because such patients were generally excluded from clinical trials of mifepristone."

==Adverse effects==

No long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of mifepristone have been performed. Results from studies conducted in vitro and in animals have revealed no genotoxic potential for mifepristone.
Neonatal exposure to a single large dose of mifepristone in rats was not associated with any reproductive problems, although chronic low-dose exposure of newborn rats to mifepristone was associated with structural and functional reproductive abnormalities.
Teratology studies in mice, rats and rabbits revealed teratogenicity for rabbits, but not rats or mice.

A postmarketing summary found that, of about 1.52 million women who had received mifepristone until April 2011 in the United States, fourteen were reported to have died after application. Eight of these cases were associated with sepsis; the other six had various causes like drug abuse and suspected murder. Other incidents reported to the FDA included 612 non-lethal hospitalizations, 339 blood transfusions, 48 severe infections, and 2,207 (0.15%) adverse events altogether.[tpl]cite web|url=http://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF11G29.pdf |title=Mifepristone U.S. Postmarketing Adverse Events Summary through 04/30/2011 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl]

==Pharmacology==

In the presence of progesterone, mifepristone acts as a competitive progesterone receptor antagonist (in the absence of progesterone, mifepristone acts as a partial agonist). Mifepristone is a 19-nor steroid with a bulky p-(dimethylamino)phenyl substituent above the plane of the molecule at the 11β-position responsible for inducing or stabilizing an inactive receptor conformation and a hydrophobic 1-propynyl substituent below the plane of the molecule at the 17α-position that increases its progesterone receptor binding affinity.

In addition to being an antiprogestogen, mifepristone is also an antiglucocorticoid and a weak antiandrogen. Mifepristone's relative binding affinity at the progesterone receptor is more than twice that of progesterone, its relative binding affinity at the glucocorticoid receptor is more than three times that of dexamethasone and more than ten times that of cortisol; its relative binding affinity at the androgen receptor is less than one third that of testosterone. It does not bind to the estrogen receptor or the mineralocorticoid receptor.

Mifepristone as a regular contraceptive at 2 mg daily prevents ovulation (1 mg daily does not). A single preovulatory 10 mg dose of mifepristone delays ovulation by 3 to 4 days and is as effective an emergency contraceptive as a single 1.5 mg dose of the progestin levonorgestrel.

In women, mifepristone at doses greater or equal to 1 mg/kg antagonizes the endometrial and myometrial effects of progesterone. In humans, an antiglucocorticoid effect of mifepristone is manifested at doses greater or equal to 4.5 mg/kg by a compensatory increase in ACTH and cortisol. In animals, a weak antiandrogenic effect is seen with prolonged administration of very high doses of 10 to 100 mg/kg.

In medical abortion regimens, mifepristone blockade of progesterone receptors directly causes endometrial decidual degeneration, cervical softening and dilatation, release of endogenous prostaglandins and an increase in the sensitivity of the myometrium to the contractile effects of prostaglandins. Mifepristone induced decidual breakdown indirectly leads to trophoblast detachment, resulting in decreased syncytiotrophoblast production of hCG, which in turn causes decreased production of progesterone by the corpus luteum (pregnancy is dependent on progesterone production by the corpus luteum through the first 9 weeks of gestation—until placental progesterone production has increased enough to take the place of corpus luteum progesterone production). When followed sequentially by a prostaglandin, mifepristone 200 mg is (100 mg may be, but 50 mg is not) as effective as 600 mg in producing a medical abortion.

Contragestion is a term promoted by Étienne-Émile Baulieu in the context of his advocacy of mifepristone, defining it as inclusive of some hypothesized mechanisms of action of some contraceptives and those of mifepristone to induce abortion.[ref][tpl]cite book|last=Baulieu|first=Étienne-Émile|year=1985|chapter=RU 486: An antiprogestin steroid with contragestive activity in women|editor1-last=Baulieu|editor1-first=Étienne-Émile|editor2-last=Segal|editor2-first=Sheldon J|title=The antiprogesin steroid RU 486 and human fertility control (Proceedings of a conference on the antiprogestational compound RU 486, held October 23–25, 1984, in Bellagio, Italy)|location=New York|publisher=Plenum Press|pages=1–25|isbn=0-306-42103-8[/tpl]

It does not prevent fertilization or implantation, so technically it is an ABORTIFACIENT rather than a contraceptive. [/ref] Baulieu's definition of a contragestive included any birth control method that could possibly act after fertilization and before nine weeks gestational age.

==Neuroprotection==

Preclinical studies point to the potential neuroprotective actions of mifepristone. Mifepristone was found to protect rat primary hippocampal neurons, clonal mouse hippocampal cells, and organotypic hippocampal slice cultures against oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death induced by amyloid beta protein, hydrogen peroxide, and glutamate.[tpl]cite journal | author = Behl C, Trapp T, Skutella T, Holsboer F | title = Protection against oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death--a novel role for RU486 | journal = Eur.

==History==

In April 1980, as part of a formal research project at Roussel-Uclaf for the development of glucocorticoid receptor antagonists, chemist Georges Teutsch synthesized mifepristone (RU-38486, the 38,486th compound synthesized by Roussel-Uclaf from 1949 to 1980; shortened to RU-486); which was discovered to also be a progesterone receptor antagonist.[tpl]cite book |author=Baulieu, Étienne-Émile; Rosenblum, Mort |year=1991 |title=The "abortion pill" : RU-486, a woman's choice |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=0-671-73816-X[/tpl] [tpl]cite book |author=Lader, Lawrence |year=1991 |title=RU 486 : the pill that could end the abortion wars and why American women don't have it |location=Reading |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-57069-6[/tpl] [tpl]cite book|author=Villaran, Gilda |chapter=RU 486 |pages=155–190 |editor=Schlegelmilch, Bodo B.

====Subsection H====

Some drugs are approved by the FDA under sub-section H, which has two sub-parts. The first sets forth ways to rush experimental drugs, such as aggressive HIV and cancer treatments, to market when speedy approval is deemed vital to the health of potential patients. The second part of sub-section H applies to drugs that not only must meet restrictions for use due to safety requirements, but also are required to meet postmarketing surveillance to establish that the safety results shown in clinical trials are seconded by use in a much wider population. Mifepristone was approved under the second part of sub-section H. The result is that women cannot pick the drug up at a pharmacy but must now receive it directly from a doctor. Due to the possibility of adverse reactions such as excessive bleeding, which may require a blood transfusion and incomplete abortion, which may require surgical intervention, the drug is only considered safe if a physician who is capable of administering a blood transfusion or a surgical abortion is available to the patient in the event of such emergencies.[tpl]cite web | last = Woodcock | first = Janet | title = Testimony on RU-486 | work = Committee on Government Reform, House of Representatives | publisher = FDA | date = 2006-05-12 | url = http://www.fda.gov/ola/2006/mifepristone0517.html | accessdate = 2006-08-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060927090806/http://www.fda.gov/ola/2006/mifepristone0517.html  |archivedate = 2006-09-27[/tpl] The approval of mifepristone under Subsection H included a black box warning.

Mifepristone was banned in Australia in 1996. In late 2005, a Private Member's bill was introduced to the Australian Senate to lift the ban and transfer the power of approval to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). The move caused much debate in the Australian media and amongst politicians. The Bill passed the Senate on 10 February 2006, and mifepristone is now legal in Australia. It is provided regularly at several specialized abortion clinics per state.[tpl]cite web|title=Marie Stopes International Australia - Medical Abortion| year=2010|accessdate=2010-12-15|url=http://www.mariestopes.org.au/our-services/women/abortion/medical-abortion[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Abortion pill - RU486 (mifepristone)|publisher=Better Health Channel Victoria| date=July 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-15|url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/abortion_pill_ru486_%28mifepristone%29?open[/tpl]

Clinical trials of mifepristone in China began in 1985. In October 1988, China became the first country in the world to approve mifepristone. Chinese organizations tried to purchase mifepristone from Roussel Uclaf, who refused to sell it to them, so in 1992 China began its own domestic production of mifepristone. In 2000, the cost of medical abortion with mifepristone was higher than surgical abortion and the percentage of medical abortions varied greatly, ranging from 30% to 70% in cities to being almost nonexistent in rural areas.

A report from the United States Embassy in Beijing in 2000 said mifepristone had been widely used in Chinese cities for about two years, and that according to press reports a black market had developed with many women starting to buy it illegally (without a prescription) from private clinics and drugstores for about $15, causing Chinese authorities to worry about medical complications from use without physician supervision.[tpl]cite web|title=Family planning in China: RU-486, abortion, and population trends|publisher=U.S. Embassy Beijing|year=2000|accessdate=2006-09-14|url=http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/ru486.html[/tpl]

Mifepristone was approved for use in India in 2002, where medical abortion is referred to as "Medical Termination of Pregnancy" (MTP). It is only available under medical supervision, not by prescription, due to adverse reactions such as excessive bleeding, and there are criminal penalties for buying or selling it on the black market or over-the-counter at pharmacies.[tpl]cite web|title=Mifepristone can be sold only to approved MTP Centres: Rajasthan State HRC|publisher=Indian Express Health Care Management|year=2000|url=http://www.expresshealthcaremgmt.com/20040515/oped01.shtml[/tpl]
Medical abortion is available in Canada on a limited basis using methotrexate and misoprostol; mifepristone is not legally approved, and importation of that drug into Canada is currently illegal. Clinical trials were done in 2000 in various Canadian cities comparing methotrexate to mifepristone, after approbation by the federal government. While both drugs had overall similar results, mifepristone was found to act faster.."Results of the Canadian trials of RU486, the 'Abortion Pill'." (n.d.). Retrieved 2006-12-08.
