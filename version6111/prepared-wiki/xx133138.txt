The Basilica of St. Nazaire and St. Celse or St. Nazarius and St. Celsus (Basilique Saint-Nazaire-et-Saint-Celse de Carcassonne), is a basilica minor in Carcassonne, southern France, listed as a national monument of the country.
It was formerly the cathedral of Carcassonne until 1801, when it was replaced by the present Carcassonne Cathedral (Cathédrale Saint-Michel de Carcassonne).
The original church is thought to have been constructed in the 6th century during the reign of Theodoric the Great, the ruler of the Visigoths. On 12 June in 1096, Pope Urban II visited the town and blessed the stones used to build the cathedral of Saint Nazaire and Saint Celse; construction was completed in the first half of the twelfth century.[tpl]cite web| title=St Nazarius’ Basilica 11th – 20th Century | author=carcassonne.org| publisher= carcassonne.org | url=http://www.carcassonne.org/carcassonne_en.nsf/vuetitre/DocPatrimoineBasiliqueStNazaire5[/tpl] It was built on the site of a Carolingian cathedral, of which no traces remain. The crypt too, despite its ancient appearance, dates from the new construction. The church was enlarged between 1269 and 1330 in the Gothic style, largely at the expense of the Bishop of Carcassonne, Pierre de Rochefort.
The exterior was largely renewed by Viollet-le-Duc, while the interior has largely remained the Gothic original.
