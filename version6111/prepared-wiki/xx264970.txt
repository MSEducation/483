The Hai! series is animated differently from the original series, most notably, the head-to-body ratio is off, and it is also computer-generated in 3-D. It has never been aired in English, but has aired in Italian under the title of Hi! Hamtaro: Piccoli Criceti Grandi Avventure. There is a video game called Tottoko Hamutaro Hai!: Hamu Hamu Challenge! Atsumare Hai! in allusion to the series.
