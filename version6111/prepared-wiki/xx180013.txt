The New Frontiers School Board (NFSB) is an English-language school board in the province of Quebec. The school board was formerly known as the Chateauguay Valley English Protestant School Board until the Province of Quebec opted for linguistic, rather than Roman Catholic and Protestant, school boards. The new name was intended to reflect the regions that were initially placed under the oversight of the NFSB; however, the board's boundaries have since returned to their original scope.
The NFSB is responsible for anglophone public schools in southwestern Montérégie, most notably the towns of Ormstown and Huntingdon. The territory borders the United States to the south, Ontario to the west, the St. Lawrence River to the north and Autoroute 15 to the east.
