==History==

Asahiyama stable is one of the oldest continually-running stables in sumo, its current incarnation dating back to 1896. It is the only stable still in existence that can trace its lineage back directly to the days of the once-rival Osaka sumo organization where it had a strong base, producing the 28th yokozuna Ōnishiki Daigorō in 1918. During the 1970s the stable was home to six Tongan wrestlers (including Sione Vailahi and Tonga Fifita) recruited by former maegashira Futaseyama, but when he died in 1975 they were caught up in a succession dispute between former maegashira Ryūō and the man who eventually became the new head, former komusubi Wakafutase. They sided with Futaseyama's widow, who preferred Ryūō to take over, and were ultimately dismissed by the Japan Sumo Association.[tpl]Cite book |author=Sharnoff, Lora |title=Grand Sumo|publisher=Weatherhill |year=1993 |id=ISBN 0-8348-0283-x[/tpl][/ref] Watafutase led the stable until his death in 1997. Since then it has been led by former  ōzeki Daiju.
