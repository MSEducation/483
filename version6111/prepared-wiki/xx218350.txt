==Track listing==

==Notes==

The track "Interpretive Reading" is a mostly verbatim excerpt of the children's book A Ghost Named Fred. The reading is set to a background of musical improvocation and a chorus from Indio High School singing their school's alma mater song.
The main riff in the track "Cold Sore Superstars" was used in the song "No One Knows" on Queens of the Stone Age's 2002 album Songs for the Deaf. "Polly Wants a Crack Rock" is a precursor to the Eagles of Death Metal song "I Only Want You".
In the song "Winners" the names were those of real Indio High School students who were winners of a science fair in the 1960s.  Many of these students were from the Class of 1965.
The tracks "Ending" and "Piano Bench Breaks" were not present the vinyl versions. "Piano Bench Breaks" featuring a hidden track which advertises upcoming releases.
