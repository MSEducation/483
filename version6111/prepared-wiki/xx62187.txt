Far Beyond Driven is the seventh studio album by American groove metal band Pantera, released on March 22, 1994 through East West Records. Upon its release, it debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, making it the first extreme metal album to top the chart. It is also the first album where Darrell Abbott is credited as "Dimebag Darrell".

==Album information==

At the time of its release, Phil Anselmo was injured with ruptured disks in his back and was suffering from chronic pain from degenerative disk disease. Anselmo began drinking heavily, abusing painkillers, muscle relaxants and began experimenting with heroin to numb the pain."Phil Anselmo battled back from drugs and surgery to rock as hard as ever". NOLA.com. January 25, 2011. Retrieved November 29, 2011.
In an interview at Loyola University in March 2009, Anselmo said:
In the liner notes of the album, all the songs' lyrics are printed apart from the cover of "Planet Caravan". The liner note reads:
The Japanese and the Driven Downunder Tour '94 Souvenir Collection editions contain a bonus thirteenth track, "The Badge", a Poison Idea cover. This cover was also featured on The Crow soundtrack."The Crow (1994) - Soundtracks". Internet Movie Database.
The track "Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills" is a reference to the song "Good Friends and a Bottle of Wine" on the Ted Nugent album Weekend Warriors. The album is referenced in the Machine Head song "Aesthetics of Hate", the third track from the 2007 album The Blackening.
In August of 2013, it was announced that there will be a 20th anniversary re-release of the album in 2014.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWCkfho_6w

==Lyrics and style==

The band tuned lower on the album than on previous efforts, with many songs going as low as C# standard. Philip Anselmo's lyrics on the album were far more personal than on the previous albums. Songs such as "Becoming" and "25 Years" appear to be about Anselmo's early life. The song "Planet Caravan" is a cover from the heavy metal band Black Sabbath.

==Cover art==

The album's original artwork (a drill bit impaling an anus) was quickly replaced with a new image, depicting a skull impaled with a drill bit. The Driven Downunder Tour '94 – Souvenir Collection box set released in Australia and New Zealand contained a copy of the album with the original artwork. The LP re-pressing by Rhino Records also uses the original artwork.

==Release and reception==

===Commercial performance [tpl]anchor|Commercial Performance[/tpl]===

At midnight on March 22, 1994, Pantera launched the release of Far Beyond Driven with an extensive record store campaign. They travelled to 12 cities in almost five days with MTV documenting their progress. Bandmembers signed autographs, met fans, and promoted Far Beyond Driven. The band released "I'm Broken" as the album’s first single, which reached No. 19 on the UK Singles Chart, making it the band's highest charting single worldwide. The LP also contained the first cover song on one of their major-label releases—Black Sabbath’s "Planet Caravan" which served as the album's closing track and reached No. 21 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks and No. 26 on the UK Singles Chart. 
Pantera’s hard work paid off; by March the LP had sold over 185,000 copies and had reached No. 1 on the U.S Billboard 200 album charts and Australian charts upon release. It remained on the Billboard 200 for 29 weeks."Pantera Facts, information, pictures". Encyclopedia.com. Retrieved November 29, 2011.

===Critical===

Although the album had great commercial success it has received mixed reviews since its release. Rolling Stone gave the album four out of five stars.  However, AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia stated "Far Beyond Driven may have been Pantera's fastest selling album upon release, but it's hardly their best. In fact, although it shot straight to the number one spot on the Billboard sales chart in its first week (arguably the most extreme album ever to do so), this incredible feat doesn't so much reflect its own qualities as those of its predecessor, 1992's Vulgar Display of Power."
Rolling Stone (19 May 1994, p. 103) - 4 Stars - "A kind of aesthetics of thud...the real art smolders in the noise itself."
Entertainment Weekly (1 April 1994, p. 54) - "If you're burned out on raging young men spewing aggression atop jackhammering drums and grinding guitars, then pass on Pantera. But if you've still got a yen for that sort of fare, then you can't do much better than this slab of metallic mayhem." - Rating: B+
Melody Maker (2 April 1994, p. 35) - "Like great techno, it's utterly flawless music, free of any error, minimal and animal enough to make a screaming bloody mess of the head."
In November 2011, Far Beyond Driven was ranked number six on Guitar World magazine's top ten list of guitar albums of 1994.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/readers-poll-results-top-10-guitar-albums-1994 |title=Photo Gallery: The Top 10 Guitar Albums of 1994 |author=Grassi, Tony |publisher=GuitarWorld.com |accessdate=2011-11-08[/tpl]

==Tour==

Pantera toured South America, and were accepted into another "Monsters of Rock" billing. At that festival on June 4, 1994, the Abbott brothers got into a scuffle with journalists from the music magazine Kerrang! over unflattering cartoon depictions of drummer Vinnie Paul. Then in late June, Anselmo was charged with assault for hitting a security guard after he prevented fans from getting on stage, Anselmo was released on $5,000 bail the next day.[tpl]cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/BN/lib00142,0EAF97EAAE9DA721.html | title=DARIEN LAKE CONCERT FRAYS NERVES AGAIN BAND'S SINGER CHARGED WITH ASSAULT |publisher=Buffalo News | date=June 29, 1994  | first= | last= | accessdate = 2008-04-06[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/AD/lib00241,0EB47798D28863CB.html | title=N.O. native, Pantera singer, arrested in guard's assault |publisher=The Advocate | date=October 26, 1994   | first= | last= | accessdate = 2008-04-06[/tpl] The trial was delayed three times.[tpl]cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/BN/lib00142,0EAF9825A7209AA9.html | title=ROCK SINGER ASSAULT CASE ADJOURNED FOR THIRD TIME |publisher=Buffalo News | date=October 26, 1994   | first= | last= | accessdate = 2008-04-06[/tpl] In May 1995, he apologized in court and pleaded guilty to attempted assault and was sentenced to 100 hours of community service.[ref]
