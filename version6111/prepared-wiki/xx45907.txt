 |quote=NB. FreeKEYB is a [[Unicode]]-based dynamically configurable successor of K3PLUS supporting most [[keyboard layout]]s, [[code page]]s, and [[List of country calling codes|country code]]s. K3PLUS was an extended keyboard driver for DOS widely distributed in Germany at its time, with adaptations to a handful of other European languages available. It did support a sub-set of the FreeKEYB features already, but was statically configured and did not support [[dynamic dead code elimination]].}}</ref><ref name="Paul_2006_FreeKEYB">
