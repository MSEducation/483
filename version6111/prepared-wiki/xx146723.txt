==History==

At the time of the Domesday Book it was known as Codrie.  In 1086 it was mentioned as having a church, a mill, and a timber-framed court.  The mill descended with the manor until the 16th century.
The manor house known as Cotheridge Court which dates back to at least the 16th century stands at the south-western part of the village.  The 12th-century church of St. Leonard's stands not very far away, and is to this day a visitors centre.
Cotheridge was in the upper division of Doddingtree Hundred.  Worcestershire Family History Guidebook, Vanessa Morgan, 2011, p20 The History Press, Stroud, Gloucestershire. 
Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 Cotheridge Parish ceased to be responsible for maintaining the poor in its parish. This responsibility was transferred to Martley Poor Law Union.

In 1304 there were two vineyards belonging to the manor.  In the late 19th century the chief crops were wheat, beans, and hops with some land used for pasture.[tpl]Fact|date=May 2009[/tpl]
