==Advocate of the Flat Earth Theory==

Carpenter was a passionate advocate of the flat earth theory, which holds that the earth is not a globe, but a flat square which revolves on a central axis  with the sun stationary over the center.
Carpenter, a printer originally from Greenwich, England, published Theoretical Astronomy Examined and Exposed - Proving the Earth not a Globe in eight parts from 1864 under the name Common Sense. He later emigrated to Baltimore where he published A hundred proofs the Earth is not a Globe in 1885.[tpl]cite web |first=William |last=Carpenter |title=One hundred proofs that the earth is not a globe, (Baltimore: The author, 1885) |url=http://www.geocities.com/lclane2/hundreda.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080308062134/http://www.geocities.com/lclane2/hundreda.html |archivedate=2008-03-08 [/tpl]
Carpenter argued that:
Carpenter was a proponent of English writer Samuel Rowbotham (1816–1885), who produced a pamphlet, with Carpenter's assistance, called Zetetic Astronomy in 1849 arguing for a flat Earth and published results of many experiments that tested the curvatures of water over a long drainage ditch, followed by another called The inconsistency of Modern Astronomy and its Opposition to the Scripture. Rowbotham also produced studies, mostly printed by Carpenter, that purported to show the effects of ships disappearing below the horizon could be explained by the laws of perspective in relation to the human eye.[ref]
