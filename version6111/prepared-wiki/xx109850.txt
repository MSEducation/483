Arts & Crafts (also referred to as "A&C") was launched as a music company in 2003 by friends Jeffrey Remedios, a former Virgin Records executive and Kevin Drew, who co-founded flagship group Broken Social Scene (BSS) with Brendan Canning. The partnership was originally intended as a vehicle for self-release and artist management of Broken Social Scene's breakthrough album You Forgot It in People, and the structure quickly formed as a platform to release albums and manage the careers of artists directly affiliated with members of Broken Social Scene.
