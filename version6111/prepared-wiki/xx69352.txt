==History==

The University of South Australia was formed in 1991 with the merger of the South Australian Institute of Technology (SAIT) with three of the campuses (Magill, Salisbury and Underdale) of the South Australian College of Advanced Education (SACAE).[tpl]cite web|url=http://w3.unisa.edu.au/about/intro/genealogy.asp |title=genealogy |publisher=University of South Australia |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2013-10-27[/tpl]  The two other SACAE campuses, City and Sturt, were merged with the University of Adelaide and Flinders University respectively. To the former SACAE campuses of Magill, Salisbury and Underdale, SAIT added to the merger its three campuses at City East, The Levels (now known as Mawson Lakes) and Whyalla.
Salisbury campus was vacated in 1996, but its sale was held up for many years by litigation. In 1997, a new campus was opened at City West. In 2005, the campus at Underdale was closed as part of the Blueprint 2005 project, and its programmes were moved to other campuses. Some services still reside at Underdale such as Document Services.  Blueprint 2005 also involved a number of new buildings, in particular at City West and Mawson Lakes.[tpl]cite news | title = SA's campus makeover | work = The Advertiser | date = 27 November 2002 |accessdate = 2008-07-21[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = BLUEPRINT UniSA - ADVERTISING FEATURE - Ambitious plan a reality | work = The Advertiser | date = 26 April 2005 |accessdate = 2008-07-21[/tpl]

===History of SAIT===

The South Australian Institute of Technology was an educational institution with 3 campuses in Adelaide, SA. Under a government reform to education in 1991 it was given the option of merging with the newly formed TAFE SA or the South Australian College of Advanced Education to form the University of South Australia.  It had a broad range of topics making it a clear fit with neither institution.

==Structure==

A faculty structure was adopted in 1992, and in 1993 UniSA established the Australian Technology Network (ATN) with the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Curtin University of Technology in Perth, RMIT University in Melbourne and the University of Technology, Sydney.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
In 1994, the first two research institutes, the Ian Wark Research Institute and the Institute for Telecommunications Research were established, followed in 1996 by the Flexible Learning Centre, which played a major role in facilitating strategic directions for improving teaching and learning.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
In 1997, UniSA became one of the first universities to identify seven Graduate Qualities, which remain central to teaching and learning framework, and adopted a Statement of Commitment to Aboriginal Reconciliation.  A Statement of Strategic Intent was formalised in 1998 to clearly define the University's character and objectives, and the current divisional structure replaced the faculty structure.
Central to the University's evolution as a modern and diverse institution was Blueprint 2005, a $140 million project that saw the closure of the Underdale campus, the construction of major buildings at City West, City East and Mawson Lakes campuses, and the extension of others. Phase one was completed in early 2005 and phase two which included the construction of the Hawke Building at City West was completed in October 2007.

==Rankings and Achievements==

The University's global reputation continues to grow, as exemplified by the 2012 QS World University Rankings in which it was again ranked among the top three per cent of more than 10,000 universities worldwide. UniSA also increased its standing in The Times Higher Education rankings, and was ranked 23rd in the world (and number three in Australia) in the QS rankings of the top 50 universities aged under 50.
Programs are designed with strong professional emphasis and in partnership with industry, and more than 90 per cent of UniSA's graduates who go on to full-time work are employed in a professional occupation within four months of completing their degree. It was ranked in the world's top 200 universities on the employer reputation index of the QS Rankings, and is part of the Australian Technology Network of universities.
The University of South Australia continues to develop a strong research environment, and has six research institutes, 17 research centres and is a key partner in 13 Co-operative Research Centres. It ranks in the top one third of Australian universities for research income, and in the Excellence in Research for Australia 2012 evaluation more than 86 per cent of its assessed research was deemed to be of world-class standard or above.
The University of South Australia also maintains a strong commitment to teaching and learning, and ranks in the top 10 nationally for the proportion of its staff with a doctorate (69 per cent compared to a national average of 64 per cent). In addition, its MBA program is one of only three in Australia to have held a five-star rating for five consecutive years (as awarded by the Graduate Management Association of Australia) and in the 2012 International Student Barometer the University's overall average rating was in the top five of participating Australian institutions.

==Student activities==

USASA (University of South Australia Student Association, formerly UniLife) is a democratic organisation run by students, which is responsive to student needs. USASA improves the quality of student life by providing administrative support to over 100 sporting and social clubs, a diverse range of events throughout the year and free advocacy and advice services, and also produces the UniSA student magazine UniLife Magazine.
After the passing of the voluntary student unionism legislation the activities and collective voice of students was significantly diminished. However this has spurred the student association to work hard to offer students better value for money.

==Commercialisation==

ITEK was formed in 1999, its role is to implement an integrated framework for the management of intellectual property, from the early stages of research through to commercialisation (from the ITEK website). Through ITEK and the Wearable Computer Lab, the University established the gaming company A-Rage, which solely looked at augmented reality gaming systems.[tpl]cite web|last=Velikovsky|first=Joe|title=A-Rage presentation to the Australian Game Developers Conference|url=http://www.slideshare.net/joeteevee/arage-agdc-the-australian-game-developers-conference|accessdate=25 March 2013[/tpl] A-rage has since disbanded.
