 invasion of Utah by the [[United States Army]], after which Young agreed to step down from power and be replaced by a non-Mormon territorial governor, [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]].
To combat the notion that rank-and-file Mormons were unhappy under Young’s leadership, Cumming noted that he had offered to help any leave the territory who desired. Of the 50,000 inhabitants of the territory of Utah, the underwhelming response—56 men, 33 women, and 71 children, most of whom stated they left for economic reasons—impressed Cumming, as did the fact that Mormon leaders contributed supplies to the emigrants.

 Nevertheless, the LDS Church still wielded significant political power in the Utah Territory.

At Young's death in 1877, he was followed by other church presidents, who resisted efforts by the United States Congress to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages. In 1878, the United States Supreme Court, in Reynolds v. United States, decreed that "religious duty" to engage in plural marriage was not a valid defense to prosecutions for violating state laws against polygamy. Conflict between Mormons and the U.S. government escalated to the point that in 1890, Congress disincorporated the LDS Church and seized most its assets. Soon thereafter, church president Wilford Woodruff issued a Manifesto that officially suspended the practice.[tpl]lds|Official Declaration —|od|1[/tpl] Although this Manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, so that families would not be split apart or damaged, no new polygamous marriages would be performed. Relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. Relations further improved after 1904, when church president Joseph F. Smith again disavowed polygamy before the United States Congress and issued a "Second Manifesto", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease, as they were already against church doctrine since Woodruff issued the Manifesto. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of excommunicating its members found practicing polygamy and today actively distances itself from "fundamentalist" groups still practicing polygamy.In 1998 Gordon B. Hinckley stated, "If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose. Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this Church." Gordon B. Hinckley, "What Are People Asking About Us?" Ensign, November 1998, p. 70.

===Modern times===

During the 20th century, the church grew substantially and became an international organization, due in part to the spread of missionaries around the globe. In 2000, the church reported 60,784 missionaries“Statistical Report, 2000,” Ensign, May 2001, p. 22. and global church membership stood at just over 11 million. Worldwide membership surpassed 13 million in 2007Deseret Morning News 2008 Church Almanac p. 655 and reached 14 million in July 2010,[tpl]Citation |author=Michael De Groote |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700103390/14-million-Mormons-and-counting.html |title=14 million Mormons and counting |publisher=Deseret News |date=January 23, 2011[/tpl] with about six million of those within the United States.Peggy Fletcher Stack, "LDS Church ramps up on global stage", Salt Lake Tribune, September 14, 2010.

A number of official changes have taken place to the organization during the modern era. One significant change was the ordination of men of black African descent to the priesthood in 1978, which reversed a policy originally instituted by Brigham Young in 1852.Bush & Mauss 1984: 70 There are also periodic changes in the structure and organization of the church, mainly to accommodate the organization's growth and increasing international presence. For example, since the early 1900s, the church has instituted a Priesthood Correlation Program to centralize church operations and bring them under a hierarchy of priesthood leaders. During the Great Depression, the church also began operating a church welfare system, and it has conducted numerous humanitarian efforts in cooperation with other religious organizations including Catholic Relief Services and Islamic Relief, as well as secular organizations such as the American Red Cross.

==Teachings and practices==

===Authorized texts===

The theology of the LDS Church consists of a combination of biblical doctrines with modern revelations and other commentary by LDS leaders, particularly Joseph Smith. The most authoritative sources of theology are the faith's canon of four religious texts, called the standard works. Included in the standard works are the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. The Book of Mormon is said by the church to be "Another Testament of Jesus Christ" that Joseph Smith translated from buried golden plates. The LDS Church believes that the Angel Moroni told Smith about these golden plates and guided him to find them buried in the Hill Cumorah. The church believes that this Angel Moroni is at least partial fulfilment of Revelation 14:6 in the Bible. The church characterizes the Book of Mormon as "the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of their religion".History of the Church, 4:461.
The Bible, also part of the church's canon, is believed to be "the word of God as far as it is translated correctly".See [tpl]lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8[/tpl] ("We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.") Most often, the church uses the Authorized King James Version. Sometimes, however, parts of the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible (corrections and restorations of assertedly damaged or lost passages) are considered authoritative. Some excerpts of Smith's translation have been included in the Pearl of Great Price, which also includes further translations by Smith and church historical items. Other historical items and revelations are found in the Doctrine and Covenants.
Another source of authoritative doctrine is the pronouncements of the current Apostles and members of the First Presidency. The church teaches that the First Presidency (the prophet and his counselors) and the Quorum of Twelve Apostles are prophets[tpl]Cite conference  | title = The Sustaining of Church Officers: Presented by President Henry B. Eyring  | publisher = The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  | date = October 7, 2012| location = Salt Lake City, UT  | url = http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/the-sustaining-of-church-officers  | accessdate =January 23, 2013[/tpl] See paragraph 7; "It is proposed that we sustain the counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators." See also Search "The Sustaining of Church Officers" for past sustaining and that their teachings are generally given under inspiration from God through the Holy Spirit. Members of the church acknowledge (sustain) them regularly as prophets, seers, and revelators—this is done publicly twice a year at the church's worldwide general conference.

===Distinctive doctrines and practices===

Several doctrines and practices of the LDS Church are unique within Christianity. For example, the Mormon cosmology and plan of salvation include the doctrines of a pre-mortal life, three degrees of heaven, and exaltation. According to these doctrines every human spirit is a literal child of Heavenly Father, and each has the potential to continue to learn, grow, and progress in the eternities, eventually achieving eternal life (which Latter-day Saints view distinct from immortality), which is to become one with God in the same way that Jesus Christ is one with the Father, thus allowing the children of God to become divine beings or "gods" themselves,[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=74[/tpl] the LDS view of theosis, also referred to as becoming a "joint-heir with Christ.""Godhood," Encyclopedia of Mormonism, p. 554, "Those who achieve this state of perfection will become joint-heirs with Christ." The process by which this is accomplished is called exaltation, a doctrine which includes the reunification of the mortal family after the resurrection and the ability to have spirit children in the afterlife and inherit a portion of God's kingdom.[ref][tpl]citation | author=LDS Church | title=Gospel Principles | publisher=LDS Church | publication-place=Salt Lake City, Utah | year=1997 | url = http://www.lds.org/gospellibrary/materials/gospel/Start%20Here_01.pdf [/tpl] (listing among the "blessings given to exalted people" that "they will become gods,… and will be able to have spirit children….");
