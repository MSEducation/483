Great Expectations is Charles Dickens' thirteenth novel. It is his second novel, after David Copperfield, to be fully narrated in the first person.Bleak House alternates between a third-person narrator and a first-person narrator, Esther Summerson, but the former is predominant. Great Expectations is a bildungsroman, or a coming-of-age novel, and it is a classic work of Victorian literature. It depicts the growth and personal development of an orphan named Pip. The novel was first published in serial form in Dickens' weekly periodical All the Year Round, from 1 December 1860 to August 1861.[tpl]cite web|title=Was Dickens Really Paid By the Word?|url=http://dickens.ucsc.edu/resources/faq/by-the-word.html|work=University of California Santa Cruz: The Dickens Project|publisher=Regents of the University of California|accessdate=15 February 2013[/tpl] In October 1861, Chapman and Hall published the novel in three volumes.
Dickens originally intended Great Expectations to be twice as long, but constraints imposed by the management of All the Year Round limited the novel's length. Collected and dense, with a conciseness unusual for Dickens, the novel represents Dickens' peak and maturity as an author. According to G. K. Chesterton, Dickens penned Great Expectations in "the afternoon of his life and fame."[tpl]cite book|last=Chesterton|first=GK|title=Appreciations and Criticisms of the Works of Charles Dickens|year=1933|publisher=J.

It is set among the marshes of Kent and in London in the early to mid-1800s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/literature/great-expectations/at-a-glance.html |title=Great Expectations by Charles Dickens |publisher=Cliffsnotes |accessdate=30 October 2012[/tpl] From the outset, the reader is "treated" by the terrifying encounter between Pip, the protagonist, and the escaped convict, Abel Magwitch.[tpl]harvnb|Charles Dickens|1993|p=1[/tpl], introduction. Great Expectations is a graphic book, full of extreme imagery, poverty, prison ships, "the hulks," barriers and chains, and fights to the death. It therefore combines intrigue and unexpected twists of autobiographical detail in different tones. Regardless of its narrative technique, the novel reflects the events of the time, Dickens' concerns, and the relationship between society and man.
The novel has received mixed reviews from critics: Thomas Carlyle speaks of "All that Pip's nonsense,"Mark Cummings, ed. The Carlyle Encyclopedia, Cranbury, N. J., Asociated University Presses, 2004, p. 122. while George Bernard Shaw praised the novel as "All of one piece and Consistently truthfull."George Bernard Shaw, Charles Dickens; Modern Critical Views, Harold Bloom, ed. New York, Infobase Publishings, 2006, p. 60. Dickens felt Great Expectations was his best work, calling it "a very fine idea,"[tpl]cite web|url=http://laboratoires.univ-reunion.fr/oracle/documents/307.html|title=The Grotesque and Tragicomedy in Dickens' Great Expectations|accessdate=6 November 2012[/tpl] and was very sensitive to compliments from his friends: "Bulwer, who has been, as I think you know, extraordinarily taken by the book."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/english-association/publications/bookmarks/dickens/D12.pdf|title=Dickens Bookmarks 12 – Great Expectations|author=Ian Brinton|format=PDF|accessdate=25 January 2013[/tpl]
Great Expectations has a colourful cast that has entered popular culture: the capricious Miss Havisham, the cold and beautiful Estella, Joe the kind and generous blacksmith, the dry and sycophantic Uncle Pumblechook, Mr. Jaggers, Wemmick with his dual personality, and the eloquent and wise friend, Herbert Pocket. Throughout the narrative, typical Dickensian themes emerge: wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and the eventual triumph of good over evil. Great Expectations has become very popular and is now taught as a classic in many English classes. It has been translated into many languages and adapted many times in film and other media.

==Development history==

As Dickens began writing Great Expectations, he undertook a series of hugely popular and remunerative reading tours. He had separated from his wife, Catherine Dickens, and was keeping secret an affair with a much younger woman, Ellen Ternan. However, economic situations and the idea of romance dictated Great Expectations' design and implementation.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]

===Beginning===

In his Book of Memoranda, begun in 1855, Dickens wrote names for possible characters: Magwitch, Provis, Clarriker, Compey, Pumblechook, Orlick, Gargery, Wopsle, Skiffins, some of which became familiar in Great Expectations. There is also a reference to a "knowing man," a possible sketch of Bentley Drummle.[tpl]harvnb|Paul Schlicke|1999|p=259[/tpl] Another evokes a house full of "Toadies and Humbugs," foreshadowing the visitors to Satis House in chapter 11.Fred Kaplan, ed. Dickens' Book of Memoranda, 1981. Margaret Cardwell discovered the "premonition" of Great Expectations from a 25 September 1855 letter from Dickens to W. H. Wills, in which Dickens speaks of recycling an "odd idea" from the Christmas special "A House to Let" and "the pivot round which my next book shall revolve."Charles Dickens, letters, Letter to Wilkie Collins, 6 September 1858.[tpl]harvsp|Charles Dickens|1993|p=xiv[/tpl], introduction by Margaret Cardwell The "odd idea" concerns an individual who "retires to an old lonely house…resolved to shut out the world and hold no communion with it."
In a 8 August 1860 letter to Earl Carlisle, Dickens reported his agitation whenever he prepared a new book. A month later, in a letter to Forster, Dickens announced that he just had a new idea.Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, mid-September 1860 (?).

===Publication in All the Year Round===

Dickens was pleased with the idea, calling it "such a very fine, new and grotesque idea." He planned to write "a little piece," a "grotesque tragi-comic conception," about a young hero who befriends an escaped convict, who then makes a fortune in Australia and anonymously bequeaths his property to the hero. In the end, the hero loses the money because it is forfeited to the Crown. In his biography of Dickens, Forster wrote that in the early idea "was the germ of Pip and Magwitch, which at first he intended to make the groundwork of a tale in the old twenty-number form."[tpl]harvsp|John Forster|1872–1874|p=9.3[/tpl] Dickens presented the relationship between Pip and Magwitch pivotal to Great Expectations but without Miss Havisham, Estella, or other characters he later created.
As the idea and Dickens' ambition grew, he began writing. However, in September, the weekly All the Year Round saw its sales fall and its flagship publication, A Day's Ride by Charles Lever, lose favour with the public. Dickens "called a council of war," and believed that to save the situation, "the one thing to be done was for him to strike in."Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, 4 October 1860. The "very fine, new and grotesque idea" became the magazine's new support: weeklies, five hundred pages, just over one year (1860–1861), thirty-six episodes, starting 1 December. The magazine continued to publish Lever's novel until its completion on 23 March 1861, but it became secondary to Great Expectations. Immediately, sales resumed, and critics responded positively, as exemplified by The Times' praise: "Great Expectations is not, indeed, Dickens' best work, but it is to be ranked among his happiest."[tpl]cite news|last=Dallas|first=E.S.|title=Great Expectations|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/viewArticle.arc?pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1861-10-17-06|accessdate=25 January 2013|newspaper=The Times|date=17 October 1861|page=6[/tpl]
Dickens, whose health was not the best, felt "The planning from week to week was unimaginably difficult" but persevered.[tpl]harvsp|Paul Schlicke|1999|p=260[/tpl] He thought he had found "a good name," decided to use the first person "throughout," and thought the beginning was "excessively droll": "I have put a child and a good-natured foolish man, in relations that seem to me very funny."Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, beginning October 1860. Four weekly episodes were "ground off the wheel" in October,Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to Wilkie Collins, 14 October 1860. and apart from one reference to the "bondage" of his heavy task,Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to Edmund Yates, 24 February 1861. the months passed without the anguished cries that usually accompanied the writing of his novels. He did not even use the Number Plans or Mems;Nineteen double sheets folded in half: on the left, names, incidents, and expressions; on the right, sections of the current chapter. he only had a few notes on the characters' ages, the tide ranges for chapter 54, and the draft of an ending. In late December, Dickens wrote to Mary Boyle that "Great Expectations is a very great success and universally liked."Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to Mary Boyle, 28 December 1860.

===Editing===

Dickens gave six readings from 14 March to 18 April 1861, and in May, Dickens took a few days holiday in Dover. On the eve of his departure, he took some friends and family members for a trip by boat from Blackwall to Southend. Ostensibly for pleasure, the mini-cruise was actually a working session for Dickens to examine banks of the river in preparation for the chapter devoted to Magwitch's attempt to escape. Dickens then revised Herbert Pocket's appearance, no doubt, asserts Margaret Cardwell, to look more like his son Charley.[tpl]harvsp|Charles Dickens|1993|p=xxvii–xxx[/tpl] On 11 June 1861, Dickens wrote to Macready that Great Expectations had been completed and on 15 June, asked the editor to prepare the novel for publication.

===Revised ending===

Following comments by Edward Bulwer-Lytton that the ending was too sad, Dickens rewrote the ending. The original ending has Pip, who remains single, briefly see Estella in London; after becoming Bentley Drummle's widow, she has remarried.[tpl]cite web|url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/dickens/ending.html|title=The Ending of Great Expectations|accessdate=25 January 2013[/tpl] It appealed to Dickens due to its originality: "the winding up will be away from all such things as they conventionally go."Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, April 1861. Dickens revised the ending so that Pip now meets Estella in the ruins of Satis House. Dickens also changed the last sentence from "I could see the shadow of no parting from her." to "I saw no shadow of another parting from her" for the 1863 edition of the novel.[tpl]harvsp|Charles Dickens|1993|p=412[/tpl]
In a letter to Forster, Dickens explained his decision: "You will be surprised to hear that I have changed the end of Great Expectations from and after Pip's return to Joe's...Bulwer, who has been, as I think you know, extraordinarily taken with the book, strongly urged it upon me, after reading the proofs, and supported his views with such good reasons that I have resolved to make the change. I have put in as pretty a little piece of writing as I could, and I have no doubt the story will be more acceptable through the alteration."Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, 25 June 1861.
As Pip uses litotes, "no shadow of another parting," it is ambiguous whether Pip and Estella marry or if Pip remains single. However, Earle Davis points out that "it would be an inadequate moral point to deny Pip any reward after he had shown a growth of character," and that "Eleven years might change Estella too."[tpl]harvsp|Earle Davis|1963|pp=261–262[/tpl] Forster felt that the original ending was "more consistent" and "more natural"[tpl]harvsp|John Forster|1872–1874|p=9. 3[/tpl] but noted the new ending's popularity.[tpl]harvsp|Earle Davis|1963|p=262[/tpl] George Gissing called that revision "a strange thing, indeed, to befall Dickens" and felt that Great Expectations would have been perfect had Dickens not changed the ending in deference to Bulwer-Lytton.George Gissing wrote: "Great Expectations (1861) would be nearly perfect in its mechanism but for the unhappy deference to Lord Lytton's judgment, which caused the end to be altered. Dickens meant to have left Pip a lonely man, and of course rightly so; by the irony of fate he was induced to spoil his work through a brother novelist's desire for a happy ending, a strange thing, indeed, to befall Dickens."[tpl]harvsp|George Gissing|1925|p=19[/tpl], chapter III, The Story-Teller
In contrast, John Hillis-Miller stated that Dickens' personality was so assertive that Bulwer-Lytton had little influence, and welcomed the revision: "The mists of infatuation have cleared away, and Pip can be joined."[tpl]harvsp|John Hillis-Miller|1958|p=278[/tpl] Earl Davis notes that G.B. Shaw published the novel in 1937 for The Limited Editions Club with the first ending and that The Rhinehart Edition of 1979 presents both endings.[tpl]cite book|author=Charles Dickens|title=Great Expectations|location=New York|publisher=Holt Rinehart & Winston|year=1979|isbn=978-0030779008[/tpl]For a more detailed look into the revision of the ending, see Calum Kerr, From Magwitch to Miss Havisham: Narrative Interaction and Mythic Structure in Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations, [tpl]cite web|format=PDF|url=http://salempress.com/store/pdfs/expectations_critical_insights.pdf|title=Great Expectations, Critical Insights|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl]
George Orwell wrote, "Psychologically the latter part of Great Expectations is about the best thing Dickens ever did," but, like John Forster and several early 20th-century writers, including George Bernard Shaw, felt that the original ending was more consistent with the draft, as well as the natural working out of the tale."George Orwell: Charles Dickens".

==Publication history==

===In periodicals===

Dickens and Wills co-owned All the Year Round, one 75%, the other 25%. Since Dickens was his own publisher, he did not require a contract for his own works.[tpl]harvsp|Robert L. Patten|1978|p=271[/tpl] Although intended for weekly publication, Great Expectations was divided into nine monthly sections, with new pagination for each.[tpl]harvsp|Paul Schlicke|1999|p=261[/tpl] Harper's Weekly published the novel from 24 November 1860 to 5 August 1861 and All the Year Round published it from 1 December 1860 to 3 August 1861. Harper's paid £1000 for publication rights. Dickens welcomed a contract with Tauchnitz 4 January 1861 for publication in English for the European continent.

===Editions===

Robert L. Patten identifies four American editions in 1861 and sees the proliferation of publications in Europe and across the Atlantic as "extraordinary testimony" to Great Expectations' popularity.[tpl]harvsp|Robert L. Patten|1978|pp=288–293[/tpl] Chapman and Hall published the first edition in three volumes in 1861, five subsequent reprints between 6 July and 30 October, and a one-volume edition in 1862. The "bargain" edition was published in 1862, the Library Edition in 1864, and the Charles Dickens edition in 1868. To this list, Paul Schlicke adds "two meticulous scholarly editions," one Claredon Press published in 1993 with an introduction by Margaret Cardwell and another with an introduction by Edgar Rosenberg, published by Norton in 1999.

==Illustrations==

Publications in Harper's Weekly were accompanied by forty illustrations by John McLenan;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/art/illustration/mclenan/index.html|title=Illustrations de McLenan|accessdate=2 August 2012[/tpl] however, this is the only Dickens work published in All the Year Round without illustrations. In 1862, Marcus Stone,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.artmagick.com/pictures/artist.aspx?artist=marcus-stone|title=Image Gallery for Marcus Stone|publisher=ArtMagick|accessdate=28 January 2013[/tpl] son of Dickens' old friend, the painter Frank Stone, was invited to create eight woodcuts for the Library Edition. According to Paul Schlicke, these illustrations are mediocre yet were included in the Charles Dickens edition, and Stone created illustrations for Dickens' subsequent novel, Our Mutual Friend. Later, Henry Mathew Brock also illustrated Great Expectations and a 1935 edition of A Christmas Carol,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bookstallsf.com/dickens.html|title=Various editions of A Christmas Carol|publisher=The Bookstall|accessdate=28 January 2013[/tpl] along with other artists, such as John McLenan,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/art/illustration/mclenan/ge.html|title=Illustrations by John McLenan for Great Expectations|accessdate=4 September 2012[/tpl] F.

==Reception==

Robert L. Patten estimates that All the Year Round sold 100,000 copies of Great Expectations each week, and Mudie, the largest circulating library, which purchased about 1,400 copies, stated that at least 30 people read each copy.[tpl]harvsp|Robert L. Patten|1978|p=292[/tpl] Aside from the dramatic plot, the Dickensian humour also appealed to readers. Dickens wrote to Forster in October 1860 that "You will not have to complain of the want of humour as in the Tale of Two Cities,"Charles Dickens, Letters, Lettere to John Forster, beginning October 1860 an opinion Forster supports, finding that "Dickens' humour, not less than his creative power, was at its best in this book."[tpl]cite book|last=Forster|first=John|title=The Life of Charles Dickens|url=http://lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~matsuoka/CD-Forster-9.html#III|accessdate=30 January 2013[/tpl] Moreover, according to Paul Schlicke, readers found the best of Dickens' older and newer writing styles.[tpl]harvsp|Paul Schlicke|1999|p=263[/tpl]
Not all reviews were favourable; Margaret Oliphant's review, published May 1862 in Blackwood's Magazine, vilified the novel. Overall, Great Expectations received near universal acclaim. Critics hailed it as one of Dickens' greatest successes although often for conflicting reasons: GK Chesterton admired the novel's optimism; Edmung Wilson its pessimism; Humphry House in 1941 emphasized its social context; while in 1974, JH Buckley saw it foremost as a bildungsroman.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] John Hillis Miller wrote in 1958 that Pip is the archetype of all Dickensian heroes, and in 1970, QD Leavis asks "How We Must Read Great Expectations." In 1984, Peter Brook, at the wake of Jacques Derrida, offered a deconstructionist reading.[tpl]cite web|language=French|url=http://www.signosemio.com/derrida/deconstruction-et-differance.asp|title=Lucie Guillemette and Josiane Cossette, Deconstruction and difference, Trois-Rivières, Université du Québec|accessdate=2 August 2012[/tpl] The most profound analyst, according to Paul Schlicke, is probably Julian Moynahan, who, in a 1964 essay surveying the hero's guilt, made Orlick "Pip's double, alter ego and dark mirror image." Schlicke also names Anny Sadrin's extensive 1988 study as the "most distinguished."[tpl]harvsp|Paul Schlicke|1999|p=264[/tpl]

==Plot summary==

On Christmas Eve, around 1812,Meckier, Jerome. Dating the Action in Great Expectations: A New Chronology. Pip, an orphan who is about seven years old, encounters an escaped convict in the village churchyard while visiting the graves of his mother, father, and siblings. The convict scares Pip into stealing food and a file to grind away his shackles, from the home he shares with his abusive older sister and her kind, passive husband Joe Gargery, a blacksmith. The next day, soldiers recapture the convict while he is engaged in a fight with another convict; the two are returned to the prison ships from which they escaped.
Miss Havisham, a wealthy spinster who wears an old wedding dress and lives in the dilapidated Satis House, asks Pip's "Uncle Pumblechook" (who is actually Joe's uncle) to find a boy to play with her adopted daughter Estella. Pip begins to visit Miss Havisham and Estella, with whom he falls in love, with Miss Havisham's encouragement. Pip visits Miss Havisham multiple times, and during one of these visits, he brings Joe along. During their absence, Joe's wife is attacked by a mysterious individual and lives out the rest of her life as a mute invalid.
Later, when Pip is a young apprentice at Joe's blacksmith shop, a lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, approaches him and tells him he is to receive a large sum of money from an anonymous benefactor and must immediately leave for London, where he is to become a gentleman. Assuming that Miss Havisham is his benefactress, he visits her and Estella, who has returned from studying on the Continent.
Years later, Pip has reached adulthood and is now heavily in debt. Abel Magwitch, the convict he helped, who was transported to New South Wales where he eventually became wealthy, reveals himself to Pip as his benefactor. There is a warrant for Magwitch's arrest in England, and he will be hanged if he is caught. Pip and his friends Herbert Pocket and Startop hatch a plan for Magwitch to flee by boat. Pip also discovers that Estella is the daughter of Magwitch and Mr. Jaggers' housemaid, Molly, whom Jaggers defended in a murder charge and who gave up her daughter to be adopted by Miss Havisham.
Pip learns that Miss Havisham's fiancé jilted her, resulting in her strange behaviour and her desire to have revenge on men by using Estella to break Pip's heart. He confronts Miss Havisham with Estella's history. In a fit of depression and remorse, Miss Havisham accidentally sets her dress on fire. Pip saves her, but she eventually dies from her injuries, lamenting her manipulation of Estella and Pip.
A few days before the escape, Joe's former journeyman, Orlick, who was responsible for the attack on Mrs. Joe, attacks Pip. Herbert Pocket and his friends save Pip and prepare for the escape.
During the escape, Magwitch kills his enemy Compeyson, a con artist and Miss Havisham's fiancé. Police capture Magwitch and jail him. Pip visits a deathly ill Magwitch in jail and tells him that his daughter Estella is alive. Barely alive, Magwitch responds with a squeezing of Pip's palm and dies shortly after, before his execution. Pip has fallen ill when he is confronted with arrest for an unpaid debt; he awakens to find Joe has come to his rescue. Joe nurses Pip back to health and pays off the debt. Pip realises that in his fruitless pursuit of Estella and wealth, he has callously ignored Joe. Realising the error of his ways, Pip returns to propose to Biddy, a friend from his childhood in Kent, only to find that she and Joe have just married.
Pip asks Joe for forgiveness, and Joe forgives him. As Pip has lost his fortune upon Magwitch's death, he is no longer a gentleman. Pip promises to repay Joe and goes to Egypt, where he shares lodgings with Herbert and Clara and works diligently as a clerk.
Eleven years later, Pip visits the ruins of Satis House and meets Estella, whom her dead husband, Bentley Drummle, had abused. She asks Pip to forgive her, assuring him that misfortune has opened her heart and that she now empathises with Pip. As Pip takes Estella's hand and leaves the ruins of Satis House, he sees "no shadow of another parting from her."

==Background==

Great Expectations' only literary predecessor is another Dickens' bildungsroman, David Copperfield. The two books trace the psychological and moral development of a young boy to maturity, his transition from a rural environment to the London metropolis, the vicissitudes of his emotional development, and the exhibition of his hopes and youthful dreams and their metamorphosis, through a rich and complex first person narrative.[tpl]harvsp|Paul Schlicke|1999|pp=261–262[/tpl] Dickens was conscious of this similarity and, before undertaking his new manuscript, reread David Copperfield to avoid repetition.
The two books both detail homecoming. Although David Copperfield is based on much of Dickens personal experiences, Great Expectations provides, according to Paul Schlicke, "the more spiritual and intimate autobiography."[tpl]harvsp|Paul Schlicke|1999|p=262[/tpl] Even though several elements hint at the setting: Miss Havisham, partly inspired by a Parisian duchess, whose residence was always closed and in darkness, surrounded by "a dead green vegetable sea," recalling Satis House,[tpl]harvsp|John Forster|1872–1874|p=III, 1[/tpl]Cited by George Newlin, Understanding Great Expectations, Westport Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000, p.xiv and the countryside bordering Chatham and Rochester, no place name is mentioned,In Great Expectations, only London is named, along with its neighbourhoods and surrounding communities. nor a specific time period, which is indicated by, among other elements, older coaches, the title "His Majesty" in reference to George III, and the old London Bridge prior to the 1824–1831 reconstruction.[tpl]cite web|last=Allingham|first=Philip V.|title=The Genres of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations – Positioning the Novel (1)|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/ge/pva101.html|publisher=The Victorian Web|accessdate=26 April 2013|date=9 March 2001[/tpl]
The theme of homecoming reflects events in Dickens' life, several years prior to the publication of Great Expectations. In 1856, he bought Gad's Hill Place in Higham, Kent, which he had dreamed of living in as a child, and moved there from far-away London two years later. In 1858, in a painful divorce, he separated from Catherine Dickens, his wife of twenty-three years. The divorce alienated him from some of his closest friends, such as Mark Lemon. He quarreled with Bradbury and Evans, who had published his novels for fifteen years. In early September 1860, in a field behind Gad's Hill, Dickens made a great bonfire of almost his entire correspondence—only those letters on business matters were spared.Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to Wills, 4 September 1860Gladys Storey, Dickens and Daughter, London, Frederick Muller Ltd, 1939, pp.106–107 He stopped publishing the weekly Household Words at the summit of its popularity and replaced it with All the Year Round.
The Uncommercial Traveller, short stories, and other texts Dickens began publishing in his new weekly in 1859 reflect his nostalgia, as seen in "Dullborough Town" and "Nurses' Stories." According to Paul Schlicke, "it is hardly surprising that the novel Dickens wrote at this time was a return to roots, set in the part of England in which he grew up, and in which he had recently resettled."
Margaret Cardwell draws attention to Chops the Dwarf from Dickens' 1858 Christmas story "Going into Society," who, as the future Pip does, entertains the illusion of inheriting a fortune and becomes disappointed upon achieving his social ambitions.[tpl]harvsp|Charles Dickens|1993|p=xiv[/tpl] In another vein, Harry Stone thinks that Gothic and magical aspects of Great Expectations were partly inspired by Charles Mathews At Home, which was presented in detail in Household Words and its monthly supplement Household Narrative. Stone also asserts that  The Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices, written in collaboration with Wilkie Collins after their walking tour of Cumberland during September 1857 and published in Household Words from 3 to 31 October of the same year, presents certain strange locations and a passionate love, foreshadowing Great Expectations.[tpl]harvsp|Harry Stone|1979|pp=279–297[/tpl]
Beyond its biographical and literary aspects, Great Expectations appears, according to Robin Gilmour, as "a representative fable of the age."[tpl]harvsp|Robin Gilmour|1981|p=123[/tpl] Dickens is aware that the novel "speaks" to a generation applying, at most, the principle of "self help" and believed to have increased the order of daily life. That the hero Pip aspires to improve, not through snobbery, but through the Victorian conviction of education, social refinement, and materialism, was seen as a noble and worthy goal. However, by tracing the origins of Pip's "great expectations" to crime, deceit, and even banishment to the colonies, Dickens unfavourably compares the new generation to the previous one of Joe Gargery, which Dickens portrays as less sophisticated but more especially rooted in sound values, presenting an oblique criticism of his time. 

==Conciseness==

The format of the weekly periodical more-or-less limited Dickens, notes Paul Davis. It required short chapters, centred on a single subject, and an almost mathematical structure.[tpl]harvsp|Paul Davis|1999|=158[/tpl] The novel divides each of its three stages into twelve parts of equal length. This symmetry contributes to the impression of completion, underlined by a number of commentators, including George Gissing, who, when comparing Joe Gargery and Dan'l Peggotty (from David Copperfield), preferred the former, as he was a stronger character who lives "in a world, not of melodrama, but of everyday cause and effect."Cited by [tpl]harvsp|Paul Davis|1999|p=158[/tpl]
G. B. Shaw called the novel "compactly perfect"; similarly, Algernon Swinburne stated, "The defects in it are as nearly imperceptible as spots on the sun or shadow on a sunlit sea."Cited by David Trotter, Introduction to Great Expectations, Londron, Penguin Books, 1996, p.vii[tpl]harvsp|Michael Cordell|1990|pp=34, 24|id=Michael_Cordell.2C_.C3.A9d.1990[/tpl] This impression of excellence also comes from, according to Christopher Ricks, "the briskness of the narrative tone."Briskness here evokes abruptness.

Similar brevity is key to the "decantation", stated Ricks, particularly in the second sentence, showing Pip's chilling, pitiless indifference but "without making a terrific demonstration of mercilessness."Dickens and the Twentieth Century, Ed.

==Style and theme==

Great Expectations is written in first person and uses some language and grammar that has fallen out of common use since its publication. The title Great Expectations refers to the 'Great Expectations' Pip has of coming into his benefactor's property upon his disclosure to him and achieving his intended role as a gentleman at that time. Great Expectations is a bildungsroman, a novel depicting growth and personal development, in this case, of Pip.
Some of the major themes of Great Expectations are crime, social class, empire and ambition. From an early age, Pip feels guilt; he is also afraid that someone will find out about his crime and arrest him. The theme of crime comes into even greater effect when Pip discovers that his benefactor is in fact a convict. Pip has an internal struggle with his conscience throughout the book. Great Expectations explores the different social classes of the Georgian era. Throughout the book, Pip becomes involved with a broad range of classes, from criminals like Magwitch to the extremely rich like Miss Havisham. Pip has great ambition, as demonstrated constantly in the book.
