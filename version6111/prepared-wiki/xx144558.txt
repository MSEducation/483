The Raton Amtrak station is located at 201 South First Street in Raton, New Mexico. It occupies the former Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway depot, which was built in 1903. Like many of the Santa Fe depots, the station was designed in the Mission Revival style.
The station is staffed during the summer season when tourism for the Philmont Scout Ranch and the National Rifle Association (NRA) Whittington Center is at its peak.  During off-seasons, it is open at all train times, maintained by a caretaker.  Passengers with layovers there often visit the non-profit Old Pass Gallery, located on the station grounds in the restored 1910 Railway Express Agency building. The station also includes a former freight depot, which is scheduled to be converted into a combined day care center and offices for the Raton Senior Citizen Organization.Raton, NM Freight Depot (Santa Fe Surviving Depots; New Mexico)
