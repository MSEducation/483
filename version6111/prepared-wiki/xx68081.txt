Slint is an American rock band consisting of Brian McMahan (guitar and vocals), David Pajo (guitar), Britt Walford (drums and vocals), Todd Brashear (bass on Spiderland) and Ethan Buckler (bass on Tweez). They formed in Louisville, Kentucky, United States, in 1986 and disbanded following the recording of their second album, Spiderland, in 1990.
Since their break-up in 1992, they have reunited sporadically since 2005, with their most recent reunion in 2013.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/slint-to-reform | title=Slint To Reform! | publisher=Clash | date=July 23, 2013 | accessdate=July 23, 2013 | author=Murray, Robin[/tpl]

==History==

Walford and McMahan began performing music together at an early age, forming Languid and Flaccid with Ned Oldham (later of The Anomoanoan) while still in middle school.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.viceland.com/int/v10n5/htdocs/something.php |title=SOMETHING LIKE AN ANOMOANON – Is Something Like Will Oldham – Vice Magazine |publisher=Viceland.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/features/060310-davidgrubbs.shtml |title=PopMatters Music Feature | Louisville Born, Brooklyn Based |publisher=Popmatters.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://louisvillepunk.awardspace.com/Photos/LanguidFlaccid00.html |title=back |publisher=Louisvillepunk.awardspace.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20[/tpl]  Walford and McMahan later played together in the seminal Louisville punk band Squirrel Bait, though Walford left the band following their first recording session.[tpl]cite web|url=http://history.louisvillehardcore.com/index.php?title=Maurice |title=Maurice – Louisville Punk/Hardcore History |publisher=History.louisvillehardcore.com |date=2010-02-27 |accessdate=2010-11-20[/tpl]  Prior to Slint, Pajo and Walford (and, briefly, McMahan) were also in the band Maurice with future members of Kinghorse.  Walford, Pajo, and Buckler played their first show together in 1985 under the name Small Tight Dirty Tufts of Hair.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mog.com/jsguntzel/blog/21046 |title=Invisible Histories: Slint (Part 2) |publisher=Mog.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20[/tpl]
Slint's first album Tweez was recorded by Steve Albini in 1987 and released in obscurity on the Jennifer Hartman Records label in 1989.  It was followed two years later by the critically acclaimed Spiderland,[tpl]cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/5923-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/9/ |title=Staff Lists: Top 100 Albums of the 1990s |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2003-11-17 |accessdate=2010-11-20[/tpl] released on Touch and Go Records and recorded by Brian Paulson. Considered a seminal work,[tpl]cite web|last=Riggs |first=Richard |url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4136138 |title=Slowcore Week: Slint and Codeine – a shared musical language? / In Depth // Drowned In Sound |publisher=Drownedinsound.com |date=2009-02-17 |accessdate=2010-11-20[/tpl] Spiderland is an album characterized by dark, syncopated rhythms, sparse guitar lines and haunting subject matter. The record's impact was such that many fans and critics have suggested it is the first true post-rock album[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl], helping to usher in a new wave of bands seeking a move away from the unfettered aggression of hardcore punk but not its underlying ethic. The cover of Spiderland is from a series of photos of the band taken by the Louisville actor/musician Will Oldham. Spiderland culminates in the baleful "Good Morning, Captain", perhaps their most recognized track (it would later feature on the soundtrack to the Larry Clark film Kids).  Touch and Go Records reissued Tweez in 1993. Finally, in 1994 a brief untitled EP was released after the band broke up. This two-song record was actually recorded in 1989 and was originally intended to be released as a 12" single on Jennifer Hartman Records. Original copies of the Tweez LP included a flyer advertisement for the 12" as an insert. However, Slint signed to Touch & Go Records before it was sent to press and the master tapes were shelved.  It contained a previously unreleased track ("Glenn") and a reinterpretation of "Rhoda" from Tweez.
Members of Slint have since appeared in a number of bands.  In 2009, former guitarist David Pajo performed with Yeah Yeah Yeahs as a live back-up musician.  He briefly played bass in Interpol, and performs under the moniker PAJO and occasionally with his band Papa M.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/arts/music/06all.html?scp=3&sq=Jarmusch&st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Ben | last=Ratliff | title=Iggy and the Stooges at All Tomorrow's Parties | date=2010-09-05[/tpl]  Pajo has also been a member of Dead Child, Tortoise, Palace, The For Carnation, and the short-lived Billy Corgan-fronted rock band Zwan. Guitarist Brian McMahan formed The For Carnation in 1994 and also played with Will Oldham in Palace. Britt Walford played drums in Evergreen, and for The Breeders under the pseudonym Shannon Doughton on the album Pod and as Mike Hunt on the Safari EP.  Ethan Buckler plays in King Kong (the original line up of Slint makes up King Kong on the 1989 7" "Movie Star").
Nearly fifteen years after disbanding, three members of Slint — Brian McMahan, David Pajo, and Britt Walford — reunited to curate the 2005 All Tomorrow's Parties (ATP) music festival in Camber Sands, England. Also in 2005, Slint played a number of shows in the U.S. and in Europe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.descendo.com/slint/ |title=Slint reunion 2005 |publisher=Descendo.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl]  Though they insisted the reunion was short-term, the band regrouped once again in 2007 to perform Spiderland in its entirety in Barcelona as part of the Primavera Sound Festival, in London as part of the ATP Don't Look Back series of shows, as well as at a handful of dates in Europe, the U.S. (at Chicago's Pitchfork Music Festival, the Showbox in Seattle, and the Henry Fonda Theatre in Hollywood), and Canada.  In addition to performing the album and the EP Slint, they also debuted a new composition called "King's Approach",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.touchandgorecords.com/news/detail.php?id=238 |title=News | Touch and Go / Quarterstick Records |publisher=Touchandgorecords.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl] which remains unrecorded.
In a September 2012 interview conducted with Northern Irish music publication AU Magazine, David Pajo hinted at more activity from the band in the coming months: "We still communicate regularly and we've got some surprises for next year that fans will be excited about. I know I am."[tpl]cite web|url=http://iheartau.com/2012/09/david-pajo/ |title=David Pajo |publisher=iheartau.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24[/tpl]
The band reunited in December 2013 to play as one of the headliners of the final All Tomorrow's Parties holiday camp festival in Camber Sands, England.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/endofanerapart2.php |title=End Of An Era Part 2 curated by ATP & Loop - All Tomorrow's Parties |publisher=Atpfestival.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl]
In an August 2013 interview with Vish Khanna, former producer Steve Albini revealed that the band was working on remastering their second album Spiderland with producer Bob Weston.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://vishkhanna.com/2013/08/16/ep-24-steve-albini/ |title=Ep. #24: Steve Albini | Kreative Kontrol |publisher=Vishkhanna.com |date=2013-08-16 |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl]  The deluxe Spiderland box set was announced in January 2014.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/53769-slints-spiderland-gets-deluxe-box-set-reissue/ |title=Slint's Spiderland Gets Deluxe Box Set Reissue |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2014-01-30 |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl]
The band was also scheduled to perform at the 2014 Primavera Sound music festival.
