CATEGORIES: Garbage (band), 1994 debut albums

Angelfish is the 1994 self-titled debut and single studio album released by Scottish alternative rock group Angelfish, fronted by Shirley Manson. The Angelfish album was born out of necessity when Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie's record distributor MCA expressed interest in recording an album with Manson on lead vocals rather than furthering its commitment to the Mackenzies. The Mackenzies' record label boss Gary Kurfirst signed Manson as a solo artist, with the remaining Mackenzies performing as her backing band to circumvent the band's existing deal with MCA.[tpl]cite web |url =http://blokshok.co.uk/gmm/blok_music_Macs.htm |title =Goodbye Mr Mackenzie - Biog  |publisher = Blokshok Productions |accessdate = 2009-03-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090413184101/http://blokshok.co.uk/gmm/blok_music_Macs.htm| archivedate= 13 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Two single releases promoted the album, the first an EP for "Suffocate Me" was released mid-1993, while the second, "Heartbreak to Hate", was released to radio at the time of the album's release. The music video for "Suffocate Me" famously aired once by MTV during 120 Minutes, where it was seen by Garbage co-founder Steve Marker.[tpl]cite episode | series = Behind The Music | serieslink = Behind The Music | title = Garbage: Behind The Music | airdate= 2002-03-31 [/tpl]  Manson was asked to join Garbage, and accepted.153 F.Supp.2d 462 RADIOACTIVE, J.V., Plaintiff, v.
