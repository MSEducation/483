By the 1830s the north side was also opened and the Warman family settled here. Other settler names: Olsen, Dargavel, Stevenson, Millar, McPherson, Ward, and Harnett. The community reached its height in the late 19th century. By 1900 the community was in decline, the virgin forest of white pine and maple had been stripped from the land to supply the shipbuilding community down river at Kingston now Rexton.
