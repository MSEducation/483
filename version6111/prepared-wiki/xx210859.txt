Isabel Drescher (born 9 March 1994 in Dortmund) is a German figure skater. She is the 2007-2008 German national silver medalist.
She took her first skating lessons at the age of 5 in a public skating session in Unna, Germany and afterwards went to the club training sessions that took place twice a week. At age 7 she passed the necessary test to become part of the Northrhein-Westfalia skating team and started taking lessons at the regional training center in Dortmund where she trained until September 2009. She moved to Berlin and switched coach to Viola Striegler after many problems with her former coach Martina Dieck in September 2009, only one week after the Junior Grand Prix in Poland. 
In the fall of 2010 Drescher returned to Dortmund and resumed training with Martina Dieck. Drescher represents the TSCE Dortmund.
