==Production background==

The film was Swanson's first independent production which she later called an "agonizing ordeal". She chose to film another adaptation of Max Marcin and Charles Guernon's play as it had been filmed once before in 1919 starring Clara Kimball Young and was a resounding success on Broadway.Soister 2012 p.347-348 Swanson hired Albert Parker, who had directed the 1919 film in the hopes that the production would be quicker as Parker was already familiar with the material.[tpl]cite book|last=Koszarski|first=Richard |title=Hollywood On the Hudson: Film and Television in New York from Griffith to Sarnoff|year=2008|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-813-54293-6|page=132[/tpl]
Swanson ignored advice to shoot the film in Hollywood and opted to rent space William Randolph Hearst's Cosmopolitan Studios in New York City. Production began in September 1926 but problems quickly arose due to Swanson's lack of experience as a producer.Koszarski 2008 p.131 The production soon ran over budget and was marred by several other problems, mainly a suitable cameraman to deal with the films intricate double exposures.[tpl]cite book|last=Swanson|first=Gloria |title=Swanson On Swanson|year=1980|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-394-50662-6|page=321[/tpl]  According to Swanson's autobiography, cinematographer George Barnes was eventually secured though he is given no screen credit.

==Reception==

The Love of Sunya premiered at the grand opening of the Roxy Theatre in New York City on March 11, 1927. Swanson later wrote that the film received a standing ovation. Despite this initial good reception and decent reviews from critics,Soister 2012 p.349 the film performed poorly at the box office, and barely recouped its budget.[tpl]cite book|last=Balio|first=Tino|title=United Artists, Volume 1, 1919â€“1950: The Company Built by the Stars|year=2009|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0-299-23003-1|page=83[/tpl] Swanson felt it was terrible.  Due to its failure, producer Joseph M. Schenck convinced Swanson to come back to Hollywood and to film something more commercial. Swanson agreed but ended up filming the more controversial Sadie Thompson (1928) instead which became her most successful independent production.
