Los Cabos is a municipality located at the southern tip of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula, in the state of Baja California Sur. It encompasses the towns of Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo (the municipal seat), as well as the Resort Corridor that lies between the two. The area's economy, like many resort areas in Mexico, was based on fishing but is now geared towards tourism, though sport fishing and golf are the area's main attractions. Also tourists can enjoy watching whales. Whales visit the area in winter due to the warm waters.
The municipality had a population of 238,487 inhabitants according to the 2010 census. It has an area of [tpl]convert|3451.51|km2|sqmi[/tpl].
