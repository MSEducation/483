Macquarie Pass National Park is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, 90 km southwest of Sydney. It is located around the pass of the same name, which is on the Illawarra Highway and part of the Illawarra escarpment.
Macquarie Pass National Park was established in 1970 and protects a range of eucalypt forests and rainforest, including one of Australia's most southerly stands of subtropical rainforest.[tpl]cite book |title=The Rough Guide to Australia |last=Daly |first=Margo |year=2003 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=1-84353-090-2 |page=240 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=GLd1AmP8yckC |accessdate=12 January 2012 [/tpl] The pass was opened in 1898. It has been a major route into and out of the Illawarra coastal plain ever since. There is a major power line running east-west through the park.
As well as a diverse array of birdlife the park has swamp wallabies and wombats.
