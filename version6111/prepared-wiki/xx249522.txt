====10 January====

During the Early hours, light snow showers spread across parts of Central England and Wales. The maximum temperature was [tpl]convert|-13.5|°C|1[/tpl] in Altnaharra and a low of [tpl]convert|-18.4|°C|1[/tpl] was recorded at Kinbrace. In Ireland exceptionally heavy snowstorms moved across Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow counties during the late afternoon hours with up to a foot and more of snow in Kildare and Wicklow. These soon spread across the Irish Sea into Wales, Northwest England and the West Midlands, where North West Wales received up to 40 cm of snow, causing problems mostly for motorists who lived in rural areas.

====11 January====

Rain, sleet and snow travelled northwards throughout the early hours. Allenheads in England had fears over a potential [tpl]convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] snowdrift. A low of [tpl]convert|-21.0|°C|1[/tpl] was recorded in Altnaharra, Highland.

====12 January====

The weather system affecting South Wales and south-west England on the evening of the 12th moved onto The Midlands and South-east England where the snow persisted throughout the early hours until around midday, dropping a further 5–10 cm. The weather system continued north during the evening, affecting much of Northern England before reaching Scotland.
Many schools were once again closed across England and Wales. There were many road accidents and closures; the M25 motorway was down to one lane between Leatherhead and Reigate whilst roads stretching right across southern Great Britain were untreated, causing problems for commuters. Gatwick and Birmingham airports were closed and many flights were delayed at Heathrow.
Due to a mix of the bitter winter weather and the milder system trying to push in from the Atlantic, heavy snowfall in the United Kingdom resumed, with fresh accumulations, on top of existing snow, of up to 15 centimetres on 12 January in Wales and South-west England. Snow later fell in The Midlands and South-east England.
In places in north England (Holmfirth, Barnsley) freezing rain or sleet fell onto deep-frozen roads, making so much black ice that some people found that the only safe way to move about on roads was by crawling. Hospital accident and emergency units in the Sheffield, Rotherham, Doncaster and Barnsley areas of South Yorkshire reported being inundated by people with broken bones and sprains after slipping on what one council official in Sheffield described as the worst black ice seen in the area in living memory.

====14 January====

Southerly to south-easterly winds brought bands of snow to parts of northern Britain. An inch of snow fell in Glasgow with further accumulations in areas outside the towns and cities, disrupting travel.

====15 January====

On 15 January rain and thaw came to much of southwest England. In Manchester rain on frozen ground had overnight caused glazed frost which had largely gone by morning, and at midday the clouds were running fast from the south; the January snowfall was melting fast, but the pre-Christmas snowfall, where trodden, had half thawed to slush and then frozen hard to solid ice overnight, was slower to melt. In Scotland it melted fresh snow. Flood warnings were issued.

====18–20 January====

Heavy snowfall occurred in Wales and the Midlands between the 18th and 20th. Exceptionally heavy snow storms occurred on the Welsh Mountains, Shropshire Hills and the Pennines, causing problems on the highest roads. Significant accumulations of up to two feet were reported on the Berwyn range and in Snowdonia.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/weather/hi/uk_reviews/newsid_8527000/8527020.stm | work=BBC News | title=Review of UK weather on 18/02/10 | date=21 February 2010 | accessdate=6 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/weather/hi/uk_reviews/newsid_8526000/8526247.stm | work=BBC News | title=Review of UK weather on 19/02/10 | date=20 February 2010 | accessdate=6 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/weather/hi/uk_reviews/newsid_8527000/8527039.stm | work=BBC News | title=Review of UK weather on 20/02/10 | date=21 February 2010 | accessdate=6 April 2010[/tpl]

Widespread snowfall across Scotland brought extreme disruption. 61 cm of snow were recorded in Aviemore as hundreds of people were stranded in cars in Dunblane. Schools and transport services disrupted. Two people died in Glen Coe in an avalanche. Temperatures reached [tpl]convert|-19.2|C[/tpl] in Braemar. Some people in Perthshire were stranded in their cars for 17 hours. 45,000 homes in Scotland were left without power. 30 schools were closed.

The Department of Health predicted that up to 40,000 excess deaths could occur because of the coldest weather for over 40 years.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10619380&pnum=2 |title=UK winter set to be the coldest in 40 years |author=Emily Dugan, Andrew Johnson and Susie Mesure |date=10 January 2010 |agency=The Independent |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] The RSA Insurance Group estimated that the cold weather was costing £690 million per day, due to people unable to get to work or deliver goods, among other factors. Extra potholes and burst water pipes are also thought to have cost £61 million and £20 million in repairs. Use of natural gas has increased by one-third.http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/the-big-freeze-2010-an-audit-1863350.html(retrieved 10 January 2010)
