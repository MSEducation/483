Thomas Francis "Tommy" Dorsey, Jr. (November 19, 1905 – November 26, 1956Tommy Dorsey at Find a Grave) was an American jazz trombonist, trumpeter, composer, and bandleader of the Big Band era. He was known as "The Sentimental Gentleman of Swing", because of  his smooth-toned trombone playing. Although he was not known for being a notable soloist, his technical skill on the trombone gave him renown amongst other musicians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/jazz/biography/artist_id_dorsey_tommy.htm |title=Jazz: A Film By Ken Burns: Selected Artist Biography - Tommy Dorsey |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2013-02-05[/tpl] He was the younger brother of bandleader Jimmy Dorsey. After Dorsey broke with his brother in the mid-1930s, he led an extremely popular and highly successful band from the late 1930s into the 1950s.

==Early life==

Thomas Francis Dorsey, Jr., was born in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, the second of four children born to Thomas Francis Dorsey, Sr., a bandleader himself,Billboard, July 25, 1942 died July 13, 1942 and Theresa (née Langton) Dorsey.[ref]Dorsey, Thomas Francis Jr. ('Tommy,' 'The Sentimental Gentleman of Swing')
[/ref] He and Jimmy, his older brother by slightly less than two years, would become famous as the "Dorsey Brothers". The two younger siblings were Mary and Edward (who died young).[tpl]cite book |title=Livin' In A Great Big Way|last=Levinson |first=Peter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005|publisher=DaCapo |location=New York |isbn=978-0-306-81111-1|page=354 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=73VQl-2QwwoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=tommy+dorsey&ei=8aX5SsarIKaQyATLrujvBQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false[/tpl] Tommy Dorsey initially studied the trumpet with his father, only to later switch to the trombone.
At age 15, Jimmy recommended Tommy as the replacement for Russ Morgan in the 1920s territory band "The Scranton Sirens."  Tommy and Jimmy worked in several bands, including those of Tal Henry, Rudy Vallee, Vincent Lopez, Nathaniel Shilkret.  In 1923, Dorsey followed his brother Jimmy to Detroit to play in Jean Goldkette's band and later returned to New York in 1925 to play with the California Ramblers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/dorsey-tommy-thomas-francis-jr |title=Dorsey, Tommy (Thomas Francis Jr.) – Jazz.com | Jazz Music – Jazz Artists – Jazz News |publisher=Jazz.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-05[/tpl]  In 1927 he joined Paul Whiteman.  In 1929, the Dorsey Brothers had their first hit with "Coquette" for OKeh records.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/dorsey_tommy/bio.jhtml|title= Tommy Dorsey|publisher=VH1/William Ruhlmann/All Music Guide|date=date published unknown[/tpl]
In 1934, the Dorsey Brothers band signed with Decca records, having a hit with "I Believe In Miracles".[tpl]cite news|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=tommy dorsey|bio=true[/tpl] |title= Tommy Dorsey|publisher=Billboard|date= [/tpl] Future bandleader Glenn Miller was a member of the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra in 1934 and 1935, composing "Annie's Cousin Fanny",[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tuxjunction.net/tommydorsey.htm|title= Tuxedo Junction Tommy Dorsey|publisher=George Spink|year=2009[/tpl] "Tomorrow's Another Day", "Harlem Chapel Chimes", and "Dese Dem Dose", all recorded for Decca,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/dorseybros.html|title= Dorsey Brothers Orchestra|publisher=Scott Alexander|date=date published unknown[/tpl] for the band. Ongoing acrimony between the brothers, however, led to Tommy Dorsey's walking out to form his own band in 1935, just as the orchestra was having a hit with "Every Little Moment."
[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/dorsey-tommy-thomas-francis-jr |title= Encyclopedia of Jazz Musicians, Dorsey, Tommy|publisher= |date= [/tpl] Dorsey's orchestra was known primarily for its renderings of ballads at dance tempos, frequently with singers such as Jack Leonard and Frank Sinatra.

==His own band==

Tommy Dorsey's first band was formed out of the remains of the Joe Haymes band, and so began Dorsey's long-running practice of raiding other bands for talent. If he admired a vocalist, musician, or arranger, he would think nothing of taking over their contracts and careers.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]  Dorsey had a reputation for being a perfectionist.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.jazzwax.com/2009/07/interview-buddy-de-franco-opus-1.html |title= Jazz Wax: Interview Buddy DeFranco Opus 1|publisher=JazzWax|author=Marc Myers |date=July 9, 2009 [/tpl] He was volatile and also known to hire and fire (and sometimes rehire) musicians based on his mood.Peter Levinson quotes Tommy Dorsey as saying "Nobody leaves this band. I only fire people." Drummer Louis Bellson sees a more a benign Dorsey, as the same website quotes him, "He wanted you to play your best every night." see http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/mainHTML.cfm?page=levinson-dorsey.htmlOn George Spink's website, saxophonist Bud Freeman says that he quit twice and was fired three times during his employment with Dorsey. Also the same website says that singers Jo Stafford and the Pied Pipers quit the Dorsey band in 1942 because of an argument with Dorsey. see http://www.tuxjunction.net/tommydorsey.htm  The new band was popular from almost the moment it signed with RCA Victor with "On Treasure Island", the first of four hits for the new band in 1935. After his 1935 recording however, Dorsey's manager cut the "hot jazz" that Dorsey had mixed with his own lyrical style and instead had Dorsey play pop and vocal tunes.  Dorsey would keep his Clambake Seven as a Dixieland group that played during performances, too.  The Dorsey band had a national radio presence in 1936, first from Dallas and then from Los Angeles.  Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra took over comedian Jack Pearl's radio show in 1937.All radio references from "Dorsey, Thomas, Francis, Jr."

By 1939, Dorsey was aware of criticism that his band lacked a jazz feeling.  He hired arranger Sy Oliver away from the Jimmie Lunceford band."Jazz Wax""When I moved from the Lunceford band to Tommy Dorsey, I didn't change my writing approach. He made the transition. The band that Dorsey had when I joined him was Dixieland-orientated [tpl]sic[/tpl], and my sort of attack was foreign to most of the fellows he had. We both knew that to be the case, but he wanted a Swing band—so he changed personnel until he got the guys that could do it." Sy Oliver. see http://www.jazzprofessional.com/interviews/SyOliver_1.htm Sy Oliver's arrangements include "On The Sunny Side of the Street" and "T.D.'s Boogie Woogie"; Oliver also composed two of the new band's signature instrumentals, "Well, Git It" and "Opus One".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.jazzprofessional.com/interviews/SyOliver_1.htm|title= The Sy Oliver Story, Part 1 |publisher=Les Tomkins|year=1974 [/tpl]  In 1940, Dorsey hired singer Frank Sinatra from bandleader Harry James. Frank Sinatra made eighty recordings from 1940 to 1942 with the Dorsey band.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showIndividual&entity_id=3804&source_type=A |title= The Kennedy Center Biography of Frank Sinatra|publisher=The Kennedy Center|date= [/tpl]  Two of those eighty songs are "In The Blue of Evening" and "This Love of Mine".[tpl]cite news|url=http://sinatraguide.com/rca-albums.htm|title= Sinatra The Complete Guide|publisher=Brett Wheadon|year=1986 [/tpl] Frank Sinatra achieved his first great success as a vocalist in the Dorsey band and claimed he learned breath control from watching Dorsey play trombone."Encyclopedia of Jazz Musicians"Later Sy Oliver and Frank Sinatra would do a posthumous tribute album to Tommy Dorsey on Sinatra's Reprise records."I Remember Tommy" appeared in 1961. See http://www.billboard.com/album/frank-sinatra/i-remember-tommy/143607/review#/album/frank-sinatra/i-remember-tommy/143607/review In turn, Dorsey said his trombone style was heavily influenced by that of Jack Teagarden."Teagarden's technique had an enormous influence on trombonists after him. Tommy Dorsey, who was to become one of the most popular trombonists of the swing era, so respected Teagarden's playing that he refused to play a solo while Teagarden was in the same room." see "Online Trombone Journal" by David Wilken, http://www.trombone.org/articles/library/evojazz2.asp Among Dorsey's staff of arrangers was Axel StordahlSimon Says p.297 also see "Jerry Jazz Musician: Interview With Peter Levinson" http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/mainHTML.cfm?page=levinson.html who arranged for Frank Sinatra in his Columbia and Capitol records years.  Another member of the Dorsey band was trombonist Nelson Riddle, who later had a partnership as one of Sinatra's arrangers and conductors in the 1950s and afterwards."Yes, the musical discipline of Tommy Dorsey, that was such an ingredient of everything he did, was something that Nelson grabbed on to. As an arranger, Dorsey knew what he wanted and Nelson had to deliver a high standard of arranging. As Bill Finegan pointed out to me, playing all of those Sy Oliver charts gave Riddle the sense of how to write very dynamic arrangements, which he did about ten years later for Sinatra." see "Jerry Jazz Musician: Interview with Peter Levinson"  Another noted Dorsey arranger, who in the 1950s, married and was professionally associated with Dorsey veteran Jo Stafford, was Paul Weston.[tpl]cite news|url=http://web.cfa.arizona.edu/westonstafford/Jo/Biography/index.html|title=Jo Stafford Biography|publisher=The University of Arizona  College of Fine Art School of Music[/tpl] Bill Finegan, an arranger who left Glenn Miller's civilian band, arranged for the Tommy Dorsey band from 1942 to 1950.[tpl]cite news|url=http://jazz.com/music/2009/1/25/tommy-dorsey-lonesome-road|title=Tommy Dorsey: Lonesome Road|publisher=Jazz.com |date=2009?[/tpl]

But he also had some extra responsibility, and became Tommy's right-hand man, acting as 'straw-boss,' conducting rehearsals, filling in as director when Dorsey was momentarily off the bandstand during the course of a night, or, just for fun, when Tommy would play trumpet and Elman would play trombone." see: "Ziggy Elman: Fralich In Swing" by Chris Popa http://www.bigbandlibrary.com/ziggyelman.html Carl "Doc" Severinsen,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.spaceagepop.com/severins.htm|title=Space Age Pop Doc Severinson|publisher=Spaceagepop |year=2008[/tpl] and Charlie Shavers,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.swingmusic.net/Tommy_Dorsey_Biography.html|title=Legends of Big Band History|publisher=Swingmusic.net |date= 2004–2007[/tpl]  pianists Milt Raskin, Jess Stacy,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries--jess-stacy-1566532.html|title=Obituaries: Jess Stacy|publisher=Independent News and Media, Limited |date=January 4, 1995 | location=London | accessdate=May 25, 2010[/tpl] clarinetists Buddy DeFranco,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.buddydefranco.com/bio.html|title=Buddy's Bio|publisher=CYber Sytes Inc.|date=Unknown Date[/tpl] Johnny Mince,Harvey Pekar and Peanuts Hucko.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/peanuts-hucko-548303.html|title=Peanuts Hucko|publisher=Independent News and Media Limited | location=London | date=June 21, 2003 | accessdate=May 25, 2010[/tpl]  Others who played with Dorsey were drummers Buddy Rich,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Buddy_Rich.html|title=Buddy Rich|publisher=Drummerworld|date=Unknown date[/tpl] Louie Bellson,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.jazzwax.com/2009/02/louie-bellson-19242009.html|title=Louie Bellson 1924-2009|publisher=Jazzwax|year=2009[/tpl] Dave Tough saxophonist Tommy Reed, and singers Frank Sinatra, Jack Leonard,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.parabrisas.com/d_leonardj.php|title=Solid!

In 1942 Artie Shaw broke up his band and Dorsey hired the Shaw string section. As George Simon in Metronome magazine notes at the time, "They're used in the foreground and background (note some of the lovely obbligatos) for vocal effects and for Tommy's trombone."[tpl]cite book |title=Simons Says: The Sights and Sounds of the Big Band Era |last=Simon |first=George |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1971 |publisher=Arlington House |location=New Rochelle, NY |isbn=978-0-88365-001-1 |page=192 |page=491 |url= [/tpl]
As Dorsey became successful, he made business decisions in the music industry.  He loaned Glenn Miller money to launch Miller's successful band of 1938,[tpl]cite book |title=Glenn Miller and His Orchestra|last=Simon |first=George |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1980 |publisher=DaCapo |location=New York |isbn=978-0-306-80129-7 |page=147 |page=496 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DvLC5_RJS0MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Glenn+Miller+and+His+ORchestra&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false [/tpl] but Dorsey saw the loan as an investment, entitling him to a percentage of Miller's income. When Miller balked at this, the angry Dorsey got even by sponsoring a new band led by Bob Chester, and hiring arrangers who deliberately copied Miller's style and sound. Dorsey branched out in the mid-1940s and owned two music publishing companies, Sun and Embassy.Dorsey, Thomas Francis Jr. After opening at the Los Angeles ballroom, The Hollywood Palladium, on the Palladium's first night, Dorsey's relations with the ballroom soured and he opened a competing ballroom, The Casino Gardens circa 1944. Dorsey also owned for a short time a trade magazine called The Bandstand.
Tommy Dorsey disbanded his own orchestra at the end of 1946. Dorsey might have broken up his own band permanently following World War II, as many big bands did due to the shift in music economics following the war, but Tommy Dorsey's album for RCA, "All Time Hits" placed in the top ten records in February 1947.  In addition, "How Are Things In Glocca Morra?", a single recorded by Dorsey, became a top-ten hit in March 1947. Both of these successes made it possible for Dorsey to re-organize a big band in early 1947.VH1/William Rulmann/All Music Guide  The Dorsey brothers were also reconciling.  The biographical film of 1947, The Fabulous Dorseys describes sketchy details of how the brothers got their start from-the-bottom-up into the jazz era of one-nighters, the early days of radio in its infancy stages, and the onward march when both brothers ended up with Paul Whiteman before 1935 when The Dorsey Brothers' Orchestra split into two.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039365/|title=The Fabulous Dorseys (1947) |publisher=IMDB|date=date published unknown [/tpl]  In the early 1950s, Tommy Dorsey moved from RCA Victor back to the Decca record label."Tommy Dorsey" Billboard
Jimmy Dorsey broke up his own big band in 1953. Tommy invited him to join up as a feature attractionTommy and Jimmy Dorsey reunited on March 15, 1945, to record a V-Disc at Liederkranz Hall in New York City. Released in June 1945, V-Disc 451 featured "More Than You Know" backed with "Brotherly Jump". The songs featured the combined orchestras of Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. and a short while later, Tommy renamed the band the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra featuring Jimmy Dorsey.  In 1953, the Dorseys focused their attention on television.see "Tommy Dorsey" IMDB http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0234186/ On December 26, 1953, the brothers appeared with their orchestra on Jackie Gleason's CBS television show, which was preserved on kinescope and later released on home video by Gleason. The brothers took the unit on tour and onto their own television show, Stage Show, from 1955 to 1956. On numerous episodes, they introduced future noted rock musician Elvis Presley to national television audiences, prior to Presley's better known appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.scottymoore.net/studio50.html|title=CBS Studio 50 The Ed Sullivan Theater |publisher=James V.

==Married life==

Dorsey's married life was varied and, at times, lurid.Levinson 171-172  His first wife was 16-year-old Mildred Kraft, with whom he eloped in 1922, when he was 17.  They had two children, Patricia and Tom (nicknamed "Skipper"). They divorced in 1943 after Dorsey's affair with his former singer Edythe Wright.Levinson 148 He then wed movie actress Pat Dane in 1943, and they were divorced in 1947,Levinson 211 but not before he gained headlines for striking actor Jon Hall when Hall embraced Dorsey's wife. Finally, Dorsey married Jane Carl New b. 20 October 1923 in Dublin, Laurens County, Georgia; d. 24 August 2003 in Bay Harbor Island, Miami-Dade County, Florida see Jane Carl New Dorsey at Find a grave on March 27, 1948, in Atlanta, Georgia.

==Death and aftermath==

On November 26, 1956, Tommy Dorsey died at age 51 in his Greenwich, Connecticut, home. He had eaten a heavy meal and began choking in his sleep. He had begun taking sleeping pills regularly at this time, from which he was so sedated that he died in his sleep from choking.Levinson 299 Jimmy Dorsey led his brother's band until his own death from lung cancer the following year.  At that point, trombonist Warren Covington became leader of the band with Jane Dorsey's blessing"Tommy died with no will and reportedly left only about $15,000.... Since widow Janie New continued to need money to support her family and because she legally owned the rights to Tommy's library of arrangements, she was naturally very interested when Willard Alexander approached her about creating a Tommy Dorsey band."  Levinson 308-309 as she owned the rights to her late husband's band and name. Billed as the "Tommy Dorsey Orchestra Starring Warren Covington", they topped the charts in 1958 with "Tea For Two Cha-Cha".Levinson 309  After Covington led the band for a short period, Sam Donahue led it starting in 1961, continuing until the late 1960s.Levinson 309-310  Buddy Morrow conducted the Tommy Dorsey orchestra until his death on September 27, 2010.
