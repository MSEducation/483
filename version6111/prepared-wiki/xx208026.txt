Marian Dale Scott (26 June 1906 – 28 November 1993) was a Canadian painter.
She was born Marian Mildred Dale in Montreal. She showed talent at an early age, her first works being exhibited in 1918. After study in Paris and London she returned to her home city, where in 1928 she married the poet and law professor F. R. Scott. They had one son, the diplomat Peter Dale Scott.
Her career began with landscapes, followed by cityscapes which reflected her social concerns. In the 1940s she turned to abstraction, seeking inspiration in scientific literature.
She was a founding member of the short-lived but influential Contemporary Arts Society of Montreal (Société d'art contemporain, 1939–48), and was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts[tpl]cite web|title=Members since 1880|url=http://www.rca-arc.ca/en/about_members/since1880.asp|publisher=Royal Canadian Academy of Arts|accessdate=11 September 2013[/tpl] in 1973.
