==Biography==

===Early life in Manchester===

Foster was born to Robert Foster and Lilian Smith[tpl]sfn|Sudjic|2010|page=11[/tpl] in 1935 in Reddish, Stockport. Foster has no recollection of Reddish[tpl]sfn|Sudjic|2010|page=11[/tpl] as  his parents rented a terraced house, 4 Crescent Grove in Levenshulme, Manchester for fourteen shillings a week soon after his birth.[tpl]Cite news |title=Norman Foster: A Life in Architecture by Deyan Sudjic |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/may/23/norman-foster-biography-book-review |newspaper=The Observer |date=23 May 2010 |accessdate=6 October 2011 |location=London |last=Moore|first=Rowan[/tpl]
Foster's parents were diligent, hard workers - so diligent that Foster, as an only child, felt their heavy workload restricted his relationship with them and he was often looked after by neighbours or other family members.[tpl]sfn|Sudjic|2010|page=19[/tpl] He attended Grammar School in Burnage. He said he always felt 'different' at school and was bullied.[tpl]Cite news |title=The Guardian Profile: Sir Norman Foster: The master builder |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1999/jan/02/books.guardianreview10 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2 January 1999 |accessdate=6 October 2011 |location=London[/tpl] He retired into the world of books and was quiet and awkward in his early years making faux pas.[tpl]Cite news |title=Book review: Norman Foster: A Life in Architecture |url=http://www.scotsman.com/features/Book-review-Norman-Foster-A.6357545.jp |work=scotsman.com |date=13 June 2010 |accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl]
Manchester was 'one of the workshops of the world' during his childhood, and 'the embodiment of a great city'.[tpl]sfn|Sudjic|2010|page=32[/tpl] His father, Robert, worked at Metropolitan-Vickers at Trafford Park which fuelled his interest in engineering and design. As a youngster, he was fascinated with engineering and the process of designing which caused him to pursue a career designing buildings.[tpl]Cite news |title=Taller, higher, bigger, Foster |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2005/oct/24/architecture |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 October 2005 |accessdate=5 October 2011 |location=London[/tpl] Specific interests included aircraft, a hobby he maintains today; and trains, generated by viewing passing trains on the railway outside his terraced home during his childhood. Foster was not keen on sports, but frequently cycled to the Lake District from Manchester and back the same day.[tpl]Cite news |title=Norman Foster at 75: Norman's conquests |last=Glancey |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/jun/29/norman-foster-interview |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 June 2010 |accessdate=4 March 2012[/tpl]
Foster's father convinced him to take the entrance exam for Manchester Town Hall's trainee scheme[tpl]sfn|Sudjic|2010|page=27[/tpl] which he passed in 1951 and took a job as an office junior in the Treasurer's Department.[tpl]sfn|Sudjic|2010|page=27[/tpl] His parents were pleased, but he was disappointed. Bored with office work, he ventured into the city to observe buildings during his lunch breaks and sketched designs while at his desk. A clerk, Mr Cobb, became aware of Foster's interests. Cobb's son was studying architecture and his interest led to Foster considering a career in architecture.[tpl]sfn|Sudjic|2010|page=30[/tpl] After working in the Manchester City Treasurer's office Foster completed his National Service in 1953 serving in the Royal Air Force, a choice inspired by his passion for aircraft.[tpl]sfn|Sudjic|2010|page=34[/tpl]
Foster returned to Manchester, not wanting to return to the town hall as his parents wished and unsure of which path to follow.[tpl]sfn|Sudjic|2010|page=35[/tpl] With 7 O-levels, he applied for a job at a duplicating office machine company and when asked by the interviewer why he applied, Foster replied: 'mainly because it offered the prospect of a company car, and a £1,000 salary.'[tpl]sfn|Sudjic|2010|page=36[/tpl] Foster was searching for a world away from his working-class roots which led the alienation of his parents.[tpl]sfn|Sudjic|2010|page=37[/tpl]

===Education===

After failing to gain a job, Foster was led to John Beardstow, a local architect in Manchester. After a successful interview, he gained a job as an assistant to a contract manager at the practice.[tpl]sfn|Sudjic|2010|page=36[/tpl] Foster was unsure how to become an architect, and if it was even possible coming from a working-class background where money for tuition was slim. Nevertheless, he queried colleagues at the architecture practice for advice on how to become an architect. Advised to create a portfolio to hand to an architecture school, he took various drawings, such as perspective and shop drawings from Beardstow's practice as inspiration.[tpl]sfn|Sudjic|2010|page=39[/tpl] Foster intended to submit this portfolio to an architectural school in the hope of gaining, however inadvertently Beardstow was so impressed with the drawings he promoted the young Foster to the drawing department of the practice.[tpl]sfn|Sudjic|2010|page=40[/tpl] However after trying to convince Foster to stay and learn his trade as an architect at Beardstow's, Foster declined and wanted to pursue a place at an architecture school.
After he was discharged, in 1956 Foster won a place at the University of Manchester School of Architecture and City Planning. Foster failed to get a grant to help fund his studies, and being from a working-class background money was at a minimum. He took up a number of part-time jobs to fund his studies in Architecture.[tpl]Cite news |title=Norman Foster: Building the future |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/742087.stm |work=BBC News |date=9 May 2000 |accessdate=5 October 2011[/tpl] His jobs in his teenage years included being an ice-cream salesman, night-club bouncer and working night shifts at the local bakery to make crumpets. He combined these with self-tuition via visits to the local library in Levenshulme.[tpl]Cite news |title=Architect's Levenshulme [tpl]sic|nolink=y|inpsiration[/tpl] |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1076763_architects_levenshulme_inpsiration |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=5 October 2011|last=Thistlethwaite|first=Laura|publisher=M.E.N. Media[/tpl] Foster took a keen interest in the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Oscar Niemeyer and graduated from Manchester in 1961.
Foster won the Henry Fellowship to the Yale School of Architecture, where he met future business partner Richard Rogers and earned his Master's degree. Vincent Scully encouraged Foster and Rogers to travel in America for a year.How much does your building weigh, Mr. Foster?, Sternstunde Kultur, Schweizer Fernsehen, 4 December 2011. After returning to the UK in 1963 he set up an architectural practice as Team 4 with Rogers and the sisters Georgie and Wendy Cheesman. Georgie (later Wolton) was the only one of the team that had passed her RIBA exams allowing them to set up in practice on their own. Team 4 quickly earned a reputation for high-tech industrial design.

===Foster and Partners===

After Team 4 went their separate ways, Foster and Wendy Cheesman founded Foster Associates, which later became Foster and Partners in 1967. A long period of collaboration with American architect Richard Buckminster Fuller began in 1968 and continued until Fuller's death in 1983. They collaborated on several projects that became catalysts in the development of an environmentally sensitive approach to design – including the Samuel Beckett Theatre project.
Originally they concentrated on industrial buildings. The turning point was the 1969 administrative and leisure center for Fred. Olsen Lines in London Docklands, where workers and managers are not separated any more. Foster and Partners' breakthrough building in the UK was the Willis Faber & Dumas headquarters in Ipswich, of 1974. The client was a family run insurance company which wanted to restore a sense of community to the workplace. Foster created open plan office floors long before open-plan became the norm. In a town not over-endowed with public facilities, the roof gardens, 25 metre swimming pool and gymnasium enhanced the quality of life for the company's 1200 employees.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/nationaltreasures/2188199/Lord-Norman-Foster-portrait.html|title=Lord Norman Foster portrait|work=The Telegraph|date=24 June 2008|accessdate=1 October 2011|location=London|publisher=Telegraph Media Group[/tpl] The building has a full-height glass facade moulded to the medieval street plan and contributes drama, subtly shifting from opaque, reflective black to a glowing backlit transparency as the sun sets. The design was inspired by the Daily Express Building in Manchester a work Foster admired in his youth. The building is now Grade II* listed.
Foster gained a reputation for designing office buildings. In the 1980s he designed the HSBC Main Building in Hong Kong for HSBC. The building is marked by its high level of light transparency, as all 3500 workers have a view to Victoria Peak or Hong Kong bay and the Chinese mainland.[tpl]Cite book |title=Norman Foster |last=Treiber |first=Daniel |publisher=E & FN Spon |year=1995 |page=76[/tpl] Foster said that if the firm had not won the contract it would probably have been bankrupted. Foster believes that attracting young talent is essential, and is proud that the average age of people working for Foster and Partners is 32, just like it was in 1967.

===Present day===

Foster was assigned the brief for a development on the site of the Baltic Exchange in the 1990s. The Exchange was damaged beyond repair by a bomb left by the IRA. Foster + Partners submitted a plan for a 385 metre tall skyscraper, the London Millennium Tower, but its height was seen as excessive for London's skyline.[tpl]Cite news |title=London Millennium Tower |url=http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&lng=3&id=102960 |work=Emporis |accessdate=10 October 2011[/tpl] The proposal was scrapped and instead Foster proposed 30 St Mary Axe, "the gherkin" due to its design which alluded to its shape. Foster worked with engineers to integrate complex computer systems with the most basic physical laws, such as convection. Green, sustainable energy ideas include the complex facade which lets in air for passive cooling and vents it as it warms and rises.
Foster's earlier designs reflected a sophisticated, machine-influenced high-tech vision. His style has evolved into a more sharp-edged modernity. In 2004, Foster designed the tallest bridge in the world, the Millau Viaduct in southern France, with the Millau Mayor Jacques Godfrain stating; "The architect, Norman Foster, gave us a model of art."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4091813.stm|title=France shows off tallest bridge|work=BBC News|date=14 December 2004|accessdate=1 October 2011[/tpl]
In January 2007, The Sunday Times reported that Foster had called in Catalyst, a corporate finance house, to find buyers for Foster + Partners. Foster does not intend to retire, but sell his 80–90% holding in the company valued at £300M to £500M.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,176-2559000,00.html|title=Foster puts £500m firm up for sale | location=London | work=The Times | date=21 January 2007 | first=Fiona | last=Hamilton[/tpl]
In 2007, he worked with Philippe Starck and Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin Group for the Virgin Galactic plans.Carré d'Art, Jean-Pierre Thiollet, Anagramme Ed., 2008, p. 134
Foster currently sits on the Board of Trustees at architectural charity Article 25 who design, construct and manage innovative, safe, sustainable buildings in some of the most inhospitable and unstable regions of the world. He has also been on the Board of Trustees of The Architecture Foundation.
