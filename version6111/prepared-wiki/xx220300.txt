He then started teaching mathematics in "Nalandaramaya", Nugegoda, a Colombo suburb, for a small group of students. Just into a few months into the new venture, student admissions to his classes increased multi-fold, resulting in him resigning from the academic staff at Royal College, Colombo to dedicate himself to full-time tutoring.

Since the late 1970s until he died in 1995, he was tutoring G.C.E. Advanced level Mathematics to thousands of students a week,in many suburbs around  Sri Lanka. The number of students in his classes continued to grow until the very last class of the G.C.E. Advanced level in 1995. The most packed class was conducted in the Rotary Hall Nugegoda, in the main hall downstairs,where he used to do lectures most days of the week.
