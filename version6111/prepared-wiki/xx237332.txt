[[Kobophenol A]]

CATEGORIES: Oligostilbenoids, Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors

Kobophenol A is a compound with the formula C56H44O13. It can be thought of as a tetramer of the stilbene analog C14H12O4 with the loss of two water molecules and an oxygen atom (whether or not this is how it is formed). It can be isolated from Caragana chamlagu(+)-Î±-Viniferin, a Stilbene Trimer from Caragana chamlague, Inhibits Acetylcholinesterase.
