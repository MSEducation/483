On April 14, 2011, Entergy, the owner of Vermont Yankee, sued the state of Vermont to stay open despite the Senate's blocking vote.[tpl]cite news| title=Vermont Yankee Nuclear Plant Owner Entergy Sues State To Stay Open |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/18/vermont-yankee-nuclear-sues-state_n_850437.html |accessdate=2011-05-16 |work=Huffington Post |date=April 18, 2011[/tpl]Democracy Now news April 19, 2011
On August 14, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled on Wednesday, upholding a lower court’s decision that allowed the Vermont Yankee plant to keep running despite a seven-year effort by the Vermont Legislature to close it, finding that states are “pre-empted” from regulating safety by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, which made safety a federal responsibility.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/business/energy-environment/appeals-court-blocks-attempt-by-vermont-to-close-a-nuclear-plant.html | work=The New York Times | first=Matthew L. | last=Wald | title=Appeals Court Blocks Attempt by Vermont to Close a Nuclear Plant | date=August 14, 2013[/tpl]
On August 27, 2013, Entergy announced the plant will be closing in 2014.

==Controversy and operations==

===2007===

Cooling for the plant's steam condenser is provided by circulating water through it, drawn from the adjacent Connecticut river. This water does not come in contact with the nuclear reactor and is not radioactive.  The cooling towers are used to cool water returning from the condenser before it is discharged back into the river at times when it is too warm to comply with the environmental discharge permit. In 2007 the fourth cell of the west cooling tower collapsed, spilling some of the non-radioactive, cooling water.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/congress-docs/correspondence/2007/kennedy-10-31-2007.pdf |title=Letter to Senator Kennedy |author=Dale E. Klein |publisher=Nuclear Regulatory Commission |date=October 31, 2007 |accessdate=March 10, 2012[/tpl] The collapse was an "industrial safety event," which did not threaten the integrity of the reactor or release any radiation into the environment. The NRC stated that the remaining cooling tower had enough capacity to allow the plant to operate at full output, however, until September 16, 2007 the reactor was kept at 50% power.
The cause of the collapse was found to be corrosion in steel bolts and rotting of lumber. Entergy has asserted that future inspections will be much more stringent in order to prevent further problems.

===2008===

The cooling tower collapse caused Vermont's then governor, Jim Douglas, to question the reliability of the power station:Governor Urges NRC to Approve Independent Safety Assessment[tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl]  In March 2008, a State Senate committee recommended that the Legislature appoint a panel to oversee an independent review of the plant's reliability. The panel gave Vermont Yankee a generally positive review. "What this report suggests to me is there is not a cause or reason to seek the closure of the plant because of operational or safety concerns," said Public Service Commissioner, David O'Brien.[ref]

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission performed a tri-annual inspection July–August 2008. It found three "minor faults." An Associated Press report said that it had won "high marks."[tpl]cite news | author = Gram, Dave |title = Vt.

===2009===

In May 2009, the vice-president of operations at Vermont Yankee told the PSB during the reliability review that he did not believe there was any radioactively contaminated underground piping at the plant, but that he would check and respond to the panel.
In October 2009, Arnold Gundersen, a member of a special oversight panel convened by the Vermont General Assembly, confirmed that radioactive contamination had been detected in underground pipes. An Entergy spokesperson told Vermont Public Radio (VPR) that the earlier testimony was a "miscommunication."[ref]
