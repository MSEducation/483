===Campaigns in France===

Henry may have regarded the assertion of his own claims as part of his royal duty, but in any case, a permanent settlement of the national debate was essential to the success of his foreign policy.

====1415 campaign====

On 11 August 1415, Henry sailed for France, where his forces besieged the fortress at Harfleur, capturing it on 22 September. Afterwards, Henry decided to march with his army across the French countryside towards Calais, despite the warnings of his council.[tpl]Sfn | Barker | 2005 | p = 220[/tpl]  On 25 October 1415, on the plains near the village of Agincourt, a French army intercepted his route. Despite his men-at-arms being exhausted, outnumbered and malnourished, Henry led his men into battle, decisively defeating the French, who suffered severe losses. It is often argued that the French men-at-arms were bogged down in the muddy battlefield, soaked from the previous night of heavy rain, and that this hindered the French advance, allowing them to be sitting targets for the flanking English and Welsh archers. Most were simply hacked to death while completely stuck in the deep mud. Nevertheless, the victory is seen as Henry's greatest, ranking alongside the battle of Poitiers.
During the battle,[tpl]Cite book| last= Hibbert| first= Christopher| authorlink= Christopher Hibbert| title= Agincourt| year= 1964| publisher= Batsford| location= London| page= 114| chapter = During the battle| oclc = 460624273[/tpl] Henry ordered that the French prisoners taken during the battle be put to death, including some of the most illustrious who could be used for ransom.  Cambridge Historian Brett Tingley posits that Henry was concerned that the prisoners might turn on their captors when the English were busy repelling a third wave of enemy troops, thus jeopardising a hard-fought victory.
The victorious conclusion of Agincourt, from the English viewpoint, was only the first step in the campaign to recover the French possessions that he felt belonged to the English crown. Agincourt also held out the promise that Henry's pretensions to the French throne might be realised.

====Diplomacy and command of the sea====

Command of the sea was secured by driving the Genoese allies of the French out of the English Channel. While Henry was occupied with peace negotiations in 1416, a French and Genoese fleet surrounded the harbour at the English-garrisoned Harfleur. A French land force also besieged the town. To relieve Harfleur, Henry sent his brother, John of Lancaster, the Duke of Bedford, who raised a fleet and set sail from Beachy Head on 14 August. The Franco-Genoese fleet was defeated the following day after a gruelling seven-hour battle, and Harfleur was relieved. Diplomacy successfully detached Emperor Sigismund from France, and the Treaty of Canterbury (1416) paved the way to end the schism in the Church.

====1417–20 campaign====

So, with those two potential enemies gone, and after two years of patient preparation following the Battle of Agincourt, Henry renewed the war on a larger scale in 1417. Lower Normandy was quickly conquered, and Rouen was cut off from Paris and besieged. This siege cast an even darker shadow on the reputation of the king than his order to slay the French prisoners at Agincourt. Rouen, starving and unable to support the women and children of the town, forced them out through the gates believing that Henry would allow them to pass through his army unmolested. However, Henry refused to allow this, and the expelled women and children died of starvation in the ditches surrounding the town. The French were paralysed by the disputes between Burgundians and Armagnacs. Henry skilfully played them off one against the other, without relaxing his warlike approach.
In January 1419, Rouen fell. Those Norman French who had resisted were severely punished: Alain Blanchard, who had hanged English prisoners from the walls of Rouen, was summarily executed; Robert de Livet, Canon of Rouen, who had excommunicated the English king, was packed off to England and imprisoned for five years.[tpl]Citation | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=d2UNAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA256&lpg=RA1-PA256&dq=%22de+livet%22+king&source=web&ots=6oTuHSy6Yg&sig=MDFlASjwuEQVpd7SnYDPxZj-Xjw&hl=en | title = Henry V, the Typical Medieval Hero | author-link = Charles Lethbridge Kingsford | first = Charles Lethbridge | last = Kingsford | publisher = CP Putnam's Sons | place = London, New York | year = 1901[/tpl].
By August, the English were outside the walls of Paris. The intrigues of the French parties culminated in the assassination of John the Fearless by the Dauphin's partisans at Montereau (10 September 1419). Philip the Good, the new Duke, and the French court threw themselves into Henry's arms. After six months of negotiation, the Treaty of Troyes recognised Henry as the heir and regent of France (see English Kings of France), and on 2 June 1420, he married Catherine of Valois, the French king's daughter. From June to July 1420, Henry's army besieged and took the castle at Montereau. He besieged and captured Melun in November, returning to England shortly thereafter.

====1421 campaign and death====

On 10 June 1421, Henry sailed back to France for what would be his last military campaign.  From July to August, Henry's forces besieged and captured Dreux, thus relieving allied forces at Chartres.  That October, his forces lay siege to Meaux, capturing it on 2 May 1422.
Henry V died suddenly on 31 August 1422 at the Château de Vincennes near Paris, apparently from dysentery,Henry V (c.1387 - 1422). BBC perhaps toxic megacolon, which he had contracted during the siege of Meaux. He was almost 36 years old.
Shortly before his death, Henry V named his brother John, Duke of Bedford, regent of France in the name of his son Henry VI, then only a few months old. Henry V did not live to be crowned King of France himself, as he might confidently have expected after the Treaty of Troyes, because ironically, the sickly Charles VI, to whom he had been named heir, survived him by two months. Henry's comrade-in-arms and Lord Steward John Sutton, 1st Baron Dudley brought the body of King Henry home to England and bore the royal standard at his funeral.[tpl]Citation | last = Wilson | first = Derek | year = 2005 | title = The Uncrowned Kings of England: The Black History of the Dudleys and the Tudor Throne | publisher = Carroll & Graf | ISBN = 0-7867-1469-7[/tpl].
