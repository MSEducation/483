That's Life is a musical comedy series that appeared on the ABC television network in 1968â€“69, starring Robert Morse and E. J. Peaker as Bobby and Gloria Dickson.
The series focused on the lives of Bobby and Gloria, from their first meeting through their marriage, as their lives progressed, through Gloria's pregnancy and childbirth, as well as Bobby's work experiences at the Miller Chalk Company. Characters often broke into song, in the manner of musical plays and movies. Songs included well-known numbers (for example, Morse doing a duet with an office computer on "Anything You Can Do") and original tunes written for the program itself. Well-known stars often guest-starred in one-time roles. Kay Medford had a recurring role as Gloria's mother, Mrs. Quigley, who was often antagonistic to Bobby.
