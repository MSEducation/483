Uniontown Mall is a regional enclosed shopping mall in South Union Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania (just outside of the city of Uniontown, Pennsylvania). It is anchored by Sears, Bon-Ton, Burlington Coat Factory, J.C. Penney and other specialty stores; although it does not contain a food court.

==History==

The one-story mall opened in 1972 after being developed by the Crown American Corporation. Sears and Gee Bee were the mall's original anchor tenants.http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&dat=19730201&id=GstdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fl4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1307,513226 Bon-Ton and JCPenney were opened later. In 2008, the property was sold to the Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust. Since 1999, the mall's fifth anchor store, formerly home to Hess's, has been divided between a Roomful Express Furniture store and a branch of TeleTech (which specializes in providing customer service and telemarketing for various businesses). Two other major stores are Dunham's Sports and a six-screen Carmike Cinema. A military recruitment center is featured to provide possible career opportunities to qualified job seekers in the Fayette County area. The mall also replaced its branch of the Borders Express book chain with the regionally based Bradley's Book Outlet.
