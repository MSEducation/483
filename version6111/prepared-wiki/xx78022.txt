CATEGORIES: Split-Dalmatia County, Counties of Croatia

Split-Dalmatia County ([tpl]lang-hr|Splitsko-dalmatinska županija[/tpl]) is the central-southern Dalmatian county in Croatia. The administrative center is Split. The population of the county is 455,242 (2011). The land area is 4534 km2.
Physically, the county is divided into three main parts: an elevated hinterland (Dalmatinska zagora) with numerous karst fields; a narrow coastal strip with high population density; and the islands. Parts of the Dinaric Alps, including Dinara itself, form the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina while the Kozjak, Mosor and Biokovo mountains separate the coastal strip from the hinterland.
The most important economic activity is tourism. Manufacturing and agriculture are in decline.
The county is linked to the rest of Croatia by the newly built four-lane Split-Zadar-Karlovac-Zagreb highway and the Lika railway. Split-Kaštela international airport is used mostly by tourist charter flights in the summer. There is also a smaller paved airfield on the island of Brač.
In the hinterland, the larger towns are Sinj (pop. 11,500 town, 25,373 with villages), Imotski (4,350) and Vrgorac (2,200).
Besides the largest city, Split (189,000 city proper, 240,000 including Kaštela and Solin), the towns on the coast are Trogir (11,000), Omiš (6,500) and Makarska (13,400).
On the islands, the populations are smaller due to high levels of emigration, but are still mostly urban in character. The main townships are: Supetar (3,300) on the island of Brač; Hvar town (3,700) and Stari Grad (1,900) on Hvar; and Vis town (1,800) and Komiža (1,500) on Vis.

==History==

The name Dalmatia comes from an Illyrian tribe called the Dalmatae who inhabited in the area of the eastern Adriatic coast in the 1st millennium BC. It was part of the Illyrian kingdom between the 4th century BC until the Illyrian Wars in the 220s BC and 168 BC when the Roman Republic established its protectorate south of the river Neretva. Dalmatia as geographical name was in usage probably from the second half of the 2nd century BC for the area in the eastern Adriatic coast between Krka and Neretva rivers.S. Čače, Ime Dalmacije u 2. i 1. st. Prije KristaRadovi Filozofskog Fakulteta u Zadru, godište 40 za 2001. Zadar, 2003, pages 29,45. It was slowly incorporated into Roman possessions until the province of Illyricum was formally established c. 32-27 BC.
Dalmatia became part of the Roman province of Illyricum. In 9 AD, the Dalmatians raised the final of a series of revoltsCharles George Herbermann, The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference (1913) together with the Pannonians, but it was finally crushed, and in 10 AD, Illyricum was split into two provinces, Pannonia and Dalmatia which spread into larger area inland to cover all of the Dinaric Alps and most of the eastern Adriatic coast.M. Zaninović, Ilirsko pleme Delmati, pages 58, 83-84.  Dalmatia was the birthplace of the Roman Emperor Diocletian, who constructed Diocletian's Palace in the core of what is now present day Split.Michael Hogan, "Diocletian's Palace", The Megalithic Portal, ed.
