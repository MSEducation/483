CATEGORIES: Prionailurus, Animals described in 1831, Mammals of India, Mammals of Sri Lanka

The rusty-spotted cat (Prionailurus rubiginosus) is the cat family's smallest member and found only in India and Sri Lanka.Pocock, R.I. (1939) The Fauna of British India, including Ceylon and Burma. Mammalia. – Volume 1. Taylor and Francis, Ltd., London. Pp 276–280 It has been listed as Vulnerable by IUCN in 2002 as the total effective population size is below 10,000 mature individuals, with a declining trend due to habitat loss, and no subpopulation containing more than 1,000 mature breeding individuals.[tpl]IUCN |assessors=Khan, J., Mukherjee, S. |year=2008 |id=18149 |taxon=Prionailurus rubiginosus |version=2010.4[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

The rusty-spotted cat rivals the black-footed cat as the world's smallest wild cat. It is [tpl]convert|35|to|48|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, with a [tpl]convert|15|to|30|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] tail, and weighs only [tpl]convert|0.9|to|1.6|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. The short fur is grey over most of the body, with rusty spots over the back and flanks, while the underbelly is white with large dark spots. The darker colored tail is thick and about half the length of the body, and the spots are less distinct. There are six dark streaks on each side of the head, extending over the cheeks and forehead.[tpl]cite book|author=Sunquist, M., Sunquist, F. |year=2002 |title= Wild cats of the World |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location= Chicago |pages= 237–240|isbn= 0-226-77999-8[/tpl]

==Distribution and habitat==

Rusty-spotted cats have a relatively restricted distribution. They mainly occur in moist and dry deciduous forests as well as scrub and grassland, but are likely absent from evergreen forest.Nowell, K., Jackson, P. (1996) Rusty-spotted Cat Prionailurus rubiginosus In: Wild Cats: status survey and conservation action plan. IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group, Gland, Switzerland They prefer dense vegetation and rocky areas.Kittle, A., Watson, A. (2004) Rusty-spotted cat in Sri Lanka: observations of an arid zone population.

===Distribution of subspecies===

Two subspecies are recognized:
In India, they were long thought to be confined to the south, but records have established that they are found over much of the country. They were observed in the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park, in the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra, on India's east coast, and in eastern Gujurat.Pathak, B. J.

Cat News 53 In western Maharashtra, there is a breeding population of rusty-spotted cats in a human dominated agricultural landscape, where rodent densities are high.Athreya, V. (2010) Rusty-spotted cat more common than we think? Cat News 53 In July and August 2011, camera trap stations recorded the feline also in Corbett Tiger reserve in Uttarakhand.[tpl]Cite news |author=Indo-Asian News Service |year=2011 |title=Highly endangered cat species spotted in Corbett |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/eco-news/highly-endangered-cat-species-spotted-in-corbett_725829.html |publisher=Zee News Limited, 12 August 2011[/tpl]
In Sri Lanka, there are a few records from montane and lowland rainforest. There are two distinct populations, one in the dry zone and the other in the wet zone.Deraniyagala, P. E. P. (1956) A new subspecies of rusty spotted cat from Ceylon. Spolia Zeylanica 28: 113

==Ecology and behaviour==

The rusty-spotted cat is nocturnal and partly arboreal, spending the day sleeping in dense cover or shelter such as hollow logs. It feeds mainly on rodents and birds, but may also take lizards, frogs, or insects. They hunt primarily on the ground, making rapid, darting movements to catch their prey; they apparently venture into the trees primarily to escape larger predators rather than for food. As with other cats, they mark their territory by spraying urine.

===Reproduction===

Oestrus lasts five days, and mating is unusually brief. Since the cat is likely to be vulnerable during this period, its brevity may be an adaptation to help it avoid larger predators. The mother prepares a den in a secluded location, and gives birth to one or two kittens after a 65-70 day gestation. At birth, the kittens weigh just [tpl]convert|60|to|77|g|oz|abbr=on[/tpl], and are marked with rows of black spots. The cat reaches sexual maturity at around 68 weeks, by which time it has developed the distinctive adult coat pattern of rusty blotches. Rusty-spotted cats have lived for twelve years in captivity, but their lifespan in the wild is unknown.

==Threats==

Habitat loss and the spread of cultivation are serious problems for wildlife in both India and Sri Lanka. Although there are several records of rusty-spotted cats from cultivated and settled areas, it is not known to what degree cat populations are able to persist in such areas. There have been occasional reports of rusty-spotted cat skins in trade.
In some areas, they are hunted for food or as livestock pests.

==Conservation==

The Indian population is listed on CITES Appendix I. The Sri Lankan population is included on CITES Appendix II. The species is fully protected over most of its range, with hunting and trade banned in India and Sri Lanka.

===In captivity===

As of 2010, the captive population of P. r. phillipsi comprised 56 individuals in eight institutions, of which 11 individuals were kept in the Colombo Zoo and 45 individuals in seven European zoos.Bender, U. (2011). International Register and Studbook for the Rusty-Spotted Cat Prionailurus rubiginosus phillipsi (Pocock, 1939). Frankfurt Zoo, Frankfurt.
When raised in captivity as a pet, the rusty spotted cat is affectionate, playful, and expressive, and forms strong bonds with its keeper. Animal Diversity Web Prionailurus rubiginosus

==Local names==

In Sri Lanka, the rusty-spotted cat is known as Handun Diviya (හඳුන් දිවියා) or Kola Diviya (කොල දිවියා).
The terms 'Handun Diviya' and 'Kola Diviya' are also used by the local community to refer to the fishing cat. Both animals are nocturnal and elusive, and therefore it is difficult to determine which cat is specifically referred to as 'Handun Diviya'.
