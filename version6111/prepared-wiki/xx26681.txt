Frederick Carlton "Carl" Lewis (born July 1, 1961) is an American former track and field athlete and United Nations Goodwill Ambassador, who won 10 Olympic medals, including nine gold, and 10 World Championships medals, including eight gold. His career spanned from 1979 when he first achieved a world ranking to 1996 when he last won an Olympic title and subsequently retired. Lewis became an actor and has appeared in a number of films.[tpl]cite news |first= Nancy|last= Dillion|title= After the Gold, Their Lives Still Glitter.

IMDb.com Lewis is a vegan and attributes his best performances in 1991 to his switching to a vegan diet.
Lewis was a dominant sprinter and long jumper who topped the world rankings in the 100 m, 200 m and long jump events frequently from 1981 to the early 1990s, was named Athlete of the Year by Track & Field News in 1982, 1983, and 1984, and set world records in the 100 m, 4 × 100 m and 4 × 200 m relays. His world record in the indoor long jump has stood since 1984 and his 65 consecutive victories in the long jump achieved over a span of 10 years is one of the sport’s longest undefeated streaks. Over the course of his athletics career, Lewis broke ten seconds for the 100 metres 15 times and 20 seconds for the 200 metres 10 times.
His accomplishments have led to numerous accolades, including being voted "Sportsman of the Century" by the International Olympic Committee and being named "Olympian of the Century" by the American sports magazine Sports Illustrated. He also helped transform track and field from its nominal amateur status to its current professional status, enabling athletes to have more lucrative and longer-lasting careers. In 2011 he attempted to run for a seat as a Democrat in the New Jersey Senate, but was removed from the ballot due to the state's residency requirement.[tpl]cite news | url=http://vip.politickernj.com/51184/carl-lewis-ends-his-8th-district-state-senate-bid | title=Carl Lewis ends his 8th District state Senate bid, rules out run against Runyan | publisher=PolitickerNJ.com |author=Max Pizarro | date=September 23, 2011 | accessdate=September 29, 2011 [/tpl]  Lewis owns a marketing and branding company named C.L.E.G., which markets and brands products and services including his own.

==Athletic career==

===Early life, and emergence as a competitive athlete===

Frederick Carlton Lewis was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on July 1, 1961, the son of William and Evelyn Lewis. The couple ran a local athletics club that provided a crucial influence on both Carl and his sister, Carol.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/07/obituaries/william-lewis-track-coach-and-father-of-olympic-star.html?pagewanted=print|title=William Lewis, Track Coach and Father of Olympic Star|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 7, 1987|accessdate=January 30, 2009[/tpl] At age 13, Lewis began competing in the long jump, and he emerged as a promising athlete while attending Willingboro High School in his hometown of Willingboro Township, New Jersey.[tpl]cite news|last=Strauss|first=Robert|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/nyregion/worth-noting-carl-lewis-takes-honors-but-not-at-his-home-track.html |title=WORTH NOTING; Carl Lewis Takes Honors, But Not at His Home Track|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 2, 2001|accessdate=March 31, 2008|quote=Mr. Lewis, who graduated from Willingboro High School in 1979, was inducted into the Hall of Fame in Mobile, Ala., along with three fellow Olympians from the 1984 Games – the marathoner Alberto Salazar, the steeplechase runner Henry Marsh and Larry Myricks, a long jumper.[/tpl] As a junior, he was one of the top long jumpers in New Jersey, and by his senior year he was one of the top long jumpers in the world. Lewis was initially coached by his father, who coached other local athletes to elite status, including Tom Farrell, a local runner and eventual junior Olympic medalist and sub-4 minute miler. Many colleges tried to recruit Lewis, and he chose to enroll at the University of Houston where Tom Tellez was coach. Tellez would thereafter remain Lewis’ coach for his entire career. Days after graduating from high school in 1979, Lewis broke the high school long jump record with a leap of 8.13 m (26 ft 8 in).[tpl]cite journal|journal=Track and Field News|date=Jan 1981|volume=33|number=12|page=13[/tpl]
Lewis immediately decided to make a living off his athletic abilities, even though track and field was nominally an amateur sport. Upon meeting Tellez for the first time after arriving at the University of Houston in the fall of 1979, Lewis said, “I want to be a millionaire and I don’t ever want a real job.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.carllewis.com/ |title=CarlLewis.com |publisher=CarlLewis.com |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] At year’s end, Lewis achieved his first world ranking as tabulated by Track and Field News, an American publication and self-described “Bible of the Sport.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trackandfieldnews.com/ |title=Track & Field News: The Bible Of The Sport Since 1948 |publisher=Trackandfieldnews.com |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] He was 5thAll-Time World Rankings — Men’s Long Jump. Track & Field News 2002 in the world in the long jump. (All subsequent ranking references are according to Track and Field News.)
Lewis qualified for the American team for the 1980 Olympics in the long jump and as a member of the 4 × 100 m relay team. Though his focus was on the long jump, he was now starting to emerge as a sprint talent. The Olympic boycott meant that Lewis did not compete in Moscow. However, he did compete at the Liberty Bell Classic in July 1980, an alternate meet for boycotting nations. He jumped 7.77 m there for a Bronze medal, and the American 4 × 100 m relay team won Gold with a time of 38.61 s.OLYMPIC BOYCOTT GAMES.

===Breakthrough in 1981 and 1982===

In 1981, Lewis started to emerge as a dominant sprinter and long jumper.
At the start of 1981, Lewis’ best legal long jump was his high school record from 1979. On June 20, Lewis improved his personal best by almost half a meter by leaping 8.62 m (28 ft 3 in) at the TAC Championships while still a teenager.Track and Field News, January 1982; vol. 34, #12, p. 46 The jump made Lewis the number two long jumper in history, behind only Bob Beamon, and holder of the low-altitude record.
While marks set at the thinner air of high altitude are eligible for world records, some purists feel that there is some “taint” to the assistance that altitude gives to athletes in sprinting and jumping events.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weeklyscientist.com/ws/articles/records.htm |title=Olympic world records may be wrong |publisher=Weeklyscientist.com |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] Lewis was determined to set his records at sea level venues to avoid this “taint.” In response to a question about his skipping a 1982 long jump competition at altitude, he said, “I want the record and I plan to get it, but not at altitude. I don’t want that ‘(A)’ altitude after the mark.”Track and Field News, July 1982, vol. 35 #6, p. 61 When he gained prominence in the early 1980s, all the extant men’s sprint records and the long jump record had been set at the high altitude of Mexico City.
Also in 1981, Lewis became the fastest 100 m sprinter in the world. His relatively modest best from 1979 (10.67 s) improved to a world-class 10.21 the next year. But 1981 saw him run 10.00 s at the Southwest Conference Championships in Dallas on May 16, a time that was the third-fastest in history and stood as the low-altitude record.Track and Field News, July 1981, vol. 34 #6, p. 12 For the first time, Lewis was ranked number one in the world, in both the 100 m and the long jump. He won his first of six National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles for the University of Houston and won his first national titles in the 100 m and long jump. Additionally, he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aausullivan.org/winners_1981.html |title=The Sullivan Award Winner |publisher=Aausullivan.org |date=1961-07-01 |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] His loss to Larry Myricks at the TAC Indoor Championships in February would stand as his last loss in the long jump for more than a decade.
Since it was rare for an athlete to compete in and dominate both a track and a field event, comparisons were made to Jesse Owens, who dominated sprint and long jump events in the 1930s.Track and Field News, January 1982; vol. 34, #12, p. 74
In 1982, Lewis continued his dominance, and for the first time, it seemed someone might challenge Bob Beamon’s world record of 8.90 m in the long jump set at the 1968 Olympics, a mark often described as one of the greatest athletic achievements ever.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014092.html |title=Beamon made sport's greatest leap |publisher=Espn.go.com |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/cover/news/1999/12/02/awards/ |publisher=CNN | accessdate=April 28, 2010 | title=Sports Illustrated honors world's greatest athletes | date=December 3, 1999[/tpl] Before Lewis, 28 feet m had been exceeded on two occasions by two people: Beamon and 1980 Olympic champion Lutz Dombrowski. During 1982, Lewis cleared 8.53 m five times outdoors, twice more indoors, going as far as 8.76 m (28 ft 9 in) at Indianapolis on July 24.Track and Field News, January 1983, vol. 35 #12, p. 45 He also ran 10.00 s in the 100 m, the world’s fastest time, matching his low-altitude record from 1981. He achieved his 10.00 s clocking the same weekend he leapt 8.61 m twice, and the day he recorded his new low-altitude record 8.76 m at Indianapolis, he had three fouls with his toe barely over the board, two of which seemed to exceed Beamon’s record, the third which several observers said reached 30 ft (about 9.15 m). Some say Lewis should have been credited with setting a world record with that jump, claiming the track officials misinterpreted the rules on fouls.Track and Field News, August 1982, vol. 35, #6, p.28–29
He repeated his number one ranking in the 100 m and long jump, and ranked number six in the 200 m. Additionally, he was named Athlete of the Year by Track and Field News. From 1981 until 1992, Lewis topped the 100 m ranking six times (seven if Ben Johnson's 1987 top ranking is ignored), and ranked no lower than third. His dominance in the long jump was even greater, as he topped the rankings nine times during the same period, and ranked second in the other years.

===1983 and the inaugural World Championships===

For the first time, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the governing body of track and field, organized a World Championships, an event which would prove to be one of the biggest sporting events of the year worldwide. The championships boasted a then record number of participating countries for a sporting event (154), more than even the Olympics which had been plagued by politically motivated boycotts in its two previous celebrations and which would suffer another one in 1984.
At the World Championships, Lewis’ chief rival in the long jump was predicted to be the man who last beat him: Larry Myricks. But though Myricks had joined Lewis in surpassing 28 feet m the year before, he failed to qualify for the American team, and Lewis won at Helsinki with relative ease. His winning leap of 8.55 m defeated silver medalist Jason Grimes by 26 cm.Results – LONG JUMP – Men – Final. 1st IAAF World Championships in Athletics Helsinki 07/14-Aug-83. iaaf.org
He also won the 100 m with relative ease. There, Calvin Smith who had earlier that year set a new world record in the 100 m at altitude with a 9.93 s performance, was soundly beaten by Lewis 10.07 s to 10.21 s.Results – 100 METRES – Men – Final. 1st IAAF World Championships in Athletics Helsinki 07/14-Aug-83. iaaf.org Smith won the 200 m title,Results – 200 METRES – Men – Final. 1st IAAF World Championships in Athletics Helsinki 07/14-Aug-83. iaaf.org an event which Lewis had not entered, but even there he was partly in Lewis’ shadow as Lewis had set an American record in that event earlier that year. He won the 200 m June 19 at the TAC/Mobil Championships in 19.75 s, the second-fastest time in history and the low-altitude record, only 0.03 s behind Pietro Mennea’s 1979 mark. Observers here noted that Lewis probably could have broken the world record if he didn't ease off in the final metres to raise his arms in celebration.Track and Field News August 1983, vol. 36, #7, p.4, 9  [tpl]YouTube|OQ4CNxujGO4|See the end of the race in this video[/tpl].  Finally, Lewis ran the anchor in the 4 × 100 m relay, winning in 37.86 s, a new world record and the first in Lewis’ career.Results – 4 X 100 METRES – Men – Final. 1st IAAF World Championships in Athletics Helsinki 07/14-Aug-83. iaaf.org
Lewis’ year-best performances in the 100 m and long jump were not at the World Championships, but at other meets. He became the first person to run a sub-10 second 100 m at low-altitude with a 9.97 s clocking at Modesto May 14.Track and Field News, June 1983, vol. 36 #5, p. 6,7Track and Field News, January 1984, vol. 36 #12, p. 22 His gold at the World Championships and his other fast times earned him the number one ranking in the world that year, despite Calvin Smith's world record. At the TAC Championships on June 19, he set a new low-altitude record in the long jump, 8.79 m, and earned the world number one rankingTrack and Field News, January 1984, vol. 36 #12, p. 48 in that event. He was ranked number two in the 200 m despite his low-altitude record of 19.75 s, as Smith had won gold at Helsinki and titles won usually outweigh marks set for the rankers at Track and Field News. Lewis was again named Athlete of the Year by the magazine.

===1984 Olympics and the quest to equal Jesse Owens===

Lewis was one of the biggest sporting celebrities in the world by the start of 1984, but owing to track and field’s relatively low profile in America, Lewis was not nearly as well known there. The 1984 Olympic games in Los Angeles would make Lewis a household name in America.
Lewis and agent Joe Douglas, founder and manager of the Santa Monica Track Club of which Lewis was a member, frequently discussed his wish to match Jesse Owens' feat of winning four gold medals at a single Olympic Games and to “cash in” afterward with the lucrative endorsement deals which surely would follow. As it turned out, the former proved far more easily accomplished than the latter, at least in America.
Lewis started his quest to match Owens with a convincing win in the 100m, running 9.99 s to handily defeat his nearest competitor, fellow American Sam Graddy, by .20s. In his next event, the long jump, Lewis won with relative ease. But his approach to winning this event stoked controversy, even as knowledgeable observers agreed his approach was the correct one.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Track and Field News|date=September 1984|volume=37|number=8|page=47[/tpl] Since Lewis still had heats and finals in the 200m and the 4×100m relay to compete in, he chose to take as few jumps as necessary to win the event. He risked injury in the cool conditions of the day if he over-extended himself, and his ultimate goal to win four golds might be at risk. His first jump at 8.54m was, he knew, sufficient to win the event. He took one more jump, a foul, then passed his remaining four allotted jumps. He handily won gold, as silver medalist Gary Honey of Australia's best jump was 8.24 m. But the public was generally unaware of the intricacies of the sport and had been repeatedly told by the media of Lewis’ quest to surpass Bob Beamon’s legendary long jump record of 8.90 m. Lewis himself had often stated it was a goal of his to surpass the mark. A television ad with Beamon appeared before the final, featuring the record-holder saying, “I hope you make it, kid.”[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/09/arts/tv-review-abc-s-coverage-of-the-olympics.html?&pagewanted=print|title=TV Review; ABC'S Coverage of the Olympics|first=John|last=Corry|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 9, 1984[/tpl] So, when Lewis decided not to make any more attempts to try to break the record, he was roundly booed. When asked about those boos, Lewis said, "I was shocked at first. But after I thought about it, I realized that they were booing because they wanted to see more of Carl Lewis. I guess that's flattering."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usatf.com/athletes/bios/TrackAndFieldArchive/1997/lewis.asp|title=Carl Lewis|work=usatf.com[/tpl]
His third gold medal came in the 200 m, where he again won handily in a time of 19.80 s, a new Olympic record and the third fastest time in history.  Finally, he won his fourth gold when the 4 × 100 m relay team he anchored finished in a time of 37.83 s, a new world record eclipsing the record he helped set the year before at the World Championships.

===Lack of endorsements and public perception===

Lewis had achieved what he had set out to do. He had matched Jesse Owens’ legendary feat of winning four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics, and he had done so with relative ease. However, Lewis had also expected to win lucrative endorsement deals, but few if any were forthcoming in America. The long jump controversy was one reason. And, Lewis’ self-congratulatory conduct did not impress several other track stars. "He rubs it in too much," said Edwin Moses, twice Olympic gold medalist in the 400 m hurdles. "A little humility is in order. That's what Carl lacks."[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Lewis_Carl.html |title=ESPN Classic – King Carl had long, golden reign |publisher=Espn.go.com |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] Further, Lewis’ agent Joe Douglas compared him to pop star Michael Jackson, a comparison which did not go over well. Douglas said he was inaccurately quoted, but the impression that Lewis was aloof and egotistical was firmly planted in the public’s perception by the end of the 1984 Olympic Games.The Runner Stumbles p2, The New York Times, July 19, 1992. Accessed February 20, 2008.
Additionally, rumors at the time that Lewis was gay circulated, and though Lewis denied the rumors, they probably hurt his marketability as well. Lewis’ look at the Games, with a flattop haircut and flamboyant clothing, added fuel to the reports. "It doesn't matter what Carl Lewis's sexuality is," high jumper Dwight Stones said. "Madison Avenue perceives him as homosexual."[tpl]cite web|author=The Dallas Morning News |url=http://apse.dallasnews.com/contest1999/writing/40-100.anastasia1.html |title=APSE | Associated Press Sports Editors |publisher=Apse.dallasnews.com |date=1996-01-01 |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] Coca-Cola had offered a lucrative deal to Lewis before the Olympics, but Lewis and Douglas turned it down, confident that Lewis would be worth more after the Olympics. But Coke rescinded the offer after the Games. Nike had Lewis under contract for several years already, despite questions about how it affected his amateur status, and he was appearing in Nike television ads, in print, and on billboards. After the Games and faced with Lewis’ new negative image, Nike dropped him. "If you're a male athlete, I think the American public wants you to look macho," said Don Coleman, a Nike representative. "They started looking for ways to get rid of me," Lewis said. "Everyone there was so scared and so cynical they didn't know what to do." (Lewis and Nike eventually did split, and Lewis signed an endorsement deal with Mizuno.) Lewis himself would lay the blame on some inaccurate reporting, especially the “Carl bashing,” as he put it, typified by a Sports Illustrated article before the Olympics.The Runner Stumbles p3, The New York Times, July 19, 1992. Accessed February 20, 2008.
At year’s end, Lewis was again awarded the top rankings in the 100 m and the long jump and was additionally ranked number one in the 200 m. And for the third year in a row, he was awarded the Athlete of the Year title by Track & Field News. Lewis was drafted in the 10th round of the 1984 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls (the draft where the Bulls selected Michael Jordan with the number 3 pick), but did not play a game in the NBA. He was also drafted in the 12th round of the 1984 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys as a wide receiver, but was not signed.

===Ben Johnson emerges as a challenger===

After the Los Angeles Olympics, Lewis continued to dominate track and field, especially in the long jump, an event he would not lose for seven more years, but others started to challenge his dominance in the 100 m sprint. His low-altitude record had been surpassed by fellow American Mel Lattany with a time of 9.96 s shortly before the 1984 Olympics,Track and Field News, January/February 1986, vol. 39 #1–2, p. 14 but his biggest challenger would prove to be Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics. Johnson would beat Lewis once in 1985, but Lewis also lost to others, while winning most of his races. Lewis retained his number one rank that year; Johnson would place second. In 1986, Johnson defeated Lewis convincingly at the Goodwill Games in Moscow, clocking a new low-altitude record of 9.95 s. At year’s end, Johnson was ranked number one, while Lewis slipped to number three having lost more races than he won. He even seemed vulnerable in the long jump, an event he didn’t lose in 1986, or the year before, though he competed sparingly. Lewis ended up ranked second behind Soviet Robert Emmiyan, who had the longest legal jump of the year at 8.61 m.

===1987 World Championships===

The 1987 World Championships in Athletics in Rome saw Lewis regain the form he had in 1984, though he lost the biggest race of the year to Johnson.
To focus on his strongest event, the long jump, Lewis skipped the 200 m and made sure to take all his attempts. This was not to answer critics from the 1984 long jump controversy; this was because history’s second 29 ft long-jumper was in the field. Robert Emmiyan had leaped 8.86 m (29 ft 1 in) at altitude in May, just 4 cm short of Bob Beamon’s record.Track and Field News, July 1987, vol. 40 #7, p. 34 But Emmiyan's best was an 8.53 m leap that day, second to Lewis's 8.67 m. Lewis cleared 8.60 m four times.Results – LONG JUMP – Men – Final. 2nd IAAF World Championships in Athletics Roma 28-Aug/06-Sep-87. iaaf.org
In the 4 × 100 m relay, Lewis anchored the gold-medal team to time of 37.90 s, the third-fastest of all time.Results – 4 X 100 METRES – Men – Final. 2nd IAAF World Championships in Athletics Roma 28-Aug/06-Sep-87. iaaf.org
The event which was most talked about and which caused the most drama was the 100 m final. Johnson had run under 10.00 s three times that year before Rome,Track and Field News, January 1988, vol. 41, #1, p. 20 while Lewis had not managed to get under the 10.00 s barrier at all. But Lewis looked strong in the heats of the 100 m, setting a Championship record in the semi-final while running into a wind with a 10.03 s effort. In the final, however, Johnson won with a time which stunned observers: 9.83 s, a new world record. Lewis, second with 9.93 s, had tied the existing world record, but that was insufficient.Track and Field News, November 1987, vol. 40 #11, p. 9
While Johnson basked in the glory of his achievement, Lewis started to explain away his defeat. He first claimed that Johnson had false-started, then he alluded to a stomach virus which had weakened him, and finally, without naming names, said “There are a lot of people coming out of nowhere. I don’t think they are doing it without drugs.” He added, “I could run 9.8 or faster in the 100 if I could jump into drugs right away.”Track and Field News, December 1987, vol. 40, #12, p. 28 This was the start of Lewis’ calling on the sport of track and field to eliminate the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs. Cynics noted that the problem had been in the sport for many years, and it only became a cause for Lewis once he was actually defeated. In response to the accusations, Johnson replied "When Carl Lewis was winning everything, I never said a word against him. And when the next guy comes along and beats me, I won’t complain about that either".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9080-825664,00.html | work=The Times | location=London | title=Ambition naivety and tantalising prospect of inheriting the world | first=Owen | last=Slot | date=September 22, 2003 | accessdate=April 28, 2010[/tpl]

===The 1988 Olympics===

Lewis not only lost the most publicized showdown in track and field in 1987, he also lost his father. When William McKinley Lewis Jr. died, Lewis placed the gold medal he won for the 100 m in 1984 in his hand to be buried with him. "Don't worry,” he told his mother. “I'll get another one.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/lewiscarladd.html |title=ESPN Classic – More Info on Carl Lewis |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2003-11-19 |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] Lewis repeatedly referred to his father as a motivating factor for the 1988 season. “A lot happened to me last year, especially the death of my father. That caused me to re-educate myself to being the very best I possibly can be this season,” he said, after defeating Johnson in Zürich August 17.Track and Field News, October 1988, vol. 41, #10, p. 25
The defeat of Johnson shortly before the Olympics was part of a year-long grudge match between the two athletes. The Johnson camp had angrily defended their star against Lewis's (ultimately correct) drug accusations, but they also scrambled to prepare Johnson after he suffered a hamstring injury during the indoor season. When Lewis defeated Johnson in their first meeting since Rome’s World Championships, the drama for the Olympics only heightened. Lewis had run 9.93 s, the same time he ran when finishing second to Johnson the previous year. Johnson ran 10.00 s, indicating he was recovering from his injury, but not answering the question whether he’d be ready for the Olympic final a bit more than a month away.
The 100 m final at the 1988 Summer Olympics was one of the most sensational sports stories of the year and its dramatic outcome would rank as one of the most infamous sports stories of the century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/sports100/index.shtml |title=St. Petersburg Times: Top 100 sports stories |publisher=Sptimes.com |date=1993-04-30 |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] Johnson won in 9.79 s, a new world record, while Lewis set a new American record with 9.92 s. Three days later, Johnson tested positive for steroids, his medal was taken away and Lewis was awarded gold and credited with a new Olympic record.Track and Field News, November 1988, vol. 41 #11, p. 10–11
In the long jump, Robert Emmiyan withdrew from the competition citing an injury, and Lewis’ main challengers were rising American long jump star Mike Powell and long-time rival Larry Myricks. Lewis leapt 8.72 m, a low-altitude Olympic best, and none of his competitors could match it. The Americans swept the medals in the event for the first time in 84 years. In the 200 m, Lewis dipped under his Olympic record from 1984, running 19.79 s, but did so in second place to Joe DeLoach, who claimed the new record and Olympic gold in 19.75 s. In the final event he entered, the 4 × 100 m relay, Lewis never made it to the track as the Americans fumbled an exchange in a heat and were disqualified.
A subsequent honor would follow: Lewis eventually was credited with the 100 m world record for the 9.92 s he ran in Seoul. Though Ben Johnson's 9.79 s time was never ratified as a world record, the 9.83 s he ran the year before was. However, in the fallout to the steroid scandal, an inquiry was called in Canada wherein Johnson admitted under oath to long-time steroid use. The IAAF subsequently stripped Johnson of his record and gold medal from the World Championships. Lewis was deemed to be the world record holder for his 1988 Olympic performance and declared the 1987 100 m World Champion. The IAAF also declared that Lewis had also, therefore, twice tied the "true" world record (9.93 s) for his 1987 World Championship performance, and again at the 1988 Zürich meet where he defeated Johnson. However, those times were never ratified as records. From January 1, 1990, Lewis was the world record holder in the 100 m.Track and Field News, November 1989, vol. 42, #11, p. 37 The record did not last long, as fellow American and University of Houston teammate Leroy Burrell ran 9.90 s on June 14, 1991, to break Lewis's mark. Lewis also lost his ranking as number one sprinter in 1989 and 1990 though still remaining undefeated in the long jump.

===The 1991 World Championships: Lewis’ greatest performances===

Tokyo was the venue for the 1991 World Championships. In the 100 m final, Lewis faced the two men who ranked number one in the world the past two years: Burrell and Jamaican Raymond Stewart. In what would be the deepest 100 meters race ever to that time, with six men finishing in under ten seconds, Lewis not only defeated his opponents, he reclaimed the world record with a clocking of 9.86 s.Track and Field News, November 1991, vol. 44, #11, p. 9 Though previously a world-record holder in this event, this was the first time he had crossed the line with “WR” beside his name on the giant television screens, and the first time he could savour his achievement at the moment it occurred. He could be seen with tears in his eyes afterwards. "The best race of my life," Lewis said. "The best technique, the fastest. And I did it at thirty." Lewis's world record would stand for nearly three years. Lewis additionally anchored the 4 × 100 m relay team to another world record, 37.50 s, the third time that year he had anchored a 4 × 100 m squad to a world record.

====Long jump showdown versus Powell====

The 1991 World Championships are perhaps best remembered for the long jump final, considered by some to have been one of greatest competitions ever in any sport.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/in_depth/2001/world_athletics/1451929.stm |work=BBC News  | title=2001 Has A Lot To Live Up To | date=July 27, 2001 | accessdate=April 28, 2010[/tpl]"Powell breaking long jump world record named 5th Greatest Moment", USA Track & Field, November 19, 2004
Lewis was up against his main rival of the last few years, Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990. Lewis had at that point not lost a long jump competition in a decade, winning 65 consecutive meets. Powell had been unable to defeat Lewis, despite sometimes putting in jumps near world-record territory, only to see them ruled fouls.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usatf.com/athletes/bios/TrackAndFieldArchive/2001/Powell_Mike.asp |title=Mike Powell |publisher=Usatf.com |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] Or, as with other competitors such as Larry Myricks, putting in leaps which Lewis himself had only rarely surpassed, only to see Lewis surpass them on his next or final attempt.Track and Field News, September 1988, vol. 41 #9, p. 18–19Track and Field News, August 1991, vol. 44 #8, p. 14–15 Lewis's first jump was 8.68 m (28 feet, 5 ¾ inches), a World Championship record, and a mark bested by only three others beside Lewis all-time. Powell, jumping first, had faltered in the first round, but jumped 8.54 m to claim second place in the second round. Myricks was also in the competition, but he didn’t challenge the leaders.
Lewis jumped 8.83 m (28–11½), a wind-aided leap, in the third round, a mark which would have won every long jump competition in history save two. Powell responded with a long foul, estimated to be around 8.80 m. Lewis's next jump made history: The first leap ever beyond Bob Beamon's record. The wind gauge indicated the jump was wind-aided, so it could not be considered a record, but it would still count in the competition. 8.91 m (29–2¾) was the greatest leap ever under any condition. Now, only a world record could defeat Lewis.
In the next round, Powell responded. His jump was measured as 8.95 m (29–4½); this time, his jump was not a foul, and with a wind gauge measurement of 0.3 m/s, well within the legal allowable for a record. Powell had not only jumped 4 cm further than Lewis, he had eclipsed the 23-year-old mark set by Bob Beamon and done so at low altitude.
Lewis still had two jumps left, though he was now no longer chasing Beamon, but Powell. He leaped 8.87 m (29–1¼), which was a new personal best under legal wind conditions, then a final jump of 8.84 m (29–0). He thus lost his first long jump competition in a decade.Track and Field News, November 1991, vol. 44, #11, p. 30–31 Powell's 8.95 m and Lewis's final two jumps still stand as of October 2011 as the top three low altitude jumps ever. The farthest anyone has jumped since under legal conditions is 8.74 m.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/statistics/toplists/inout=o/age=n/season=0/sex=M/all=y/legal=A/disc=LJ/detail.html |title=Long Jump All Time List |publisher=Iaaf.org |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl]
Lewis’ reaction to what was one of the greatest competitions ever in the sport was to offer acknowledgment of the achievement of Powell. "He just did it," Lewis said of Powell's winning jump. "It was that close, and it was the best of his life.""29–4½! Soaring Powell Conquers Beamon's Record," The New York Times, August 31, 1991 Powell did jump as far or farther on two subsequent occasions, though both were wind-aided jumps at altitude: 8.99 m in 1992 and 8.95 m in 1994.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/athletics-heroes/displayhero.asp?HeroID=6250 |title=Sporting Heroes |publisher=Sporting Heroes |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] Lewis's best subsequent results were two wind-aided leaps at 8.72 m, and a 8.68 m under legal conditions while in the qualifying rounds at the Barcelona Olympics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.carllewis.com/carlstats7.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021010214507/http://www.carllewis.com/carlstats7.html |archivedate=2002-10-10 |title=Carl Lewis Career Facts & Statistics -LEWIS' 28 FOOT JUMPS |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2002-10-10 |accessdate=2012-09-06[/tpl]
In reference to his efforts at the 1991 World Championships, Lewis said, “This has been the greatest meet that I’ve ever had.”Track and Field News, November 1991, vol. .44, #11, p. 8 Track and Field News was prepared to go even further than that, suggesting that after these Championships, “It had become hard to argue that he is not the greatest athlete ever to set foot on track or field.”
Lewis's 1991 outstanding results earned him the ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year, an award he shared with gymnastics star Kim Zmeskal.

===The 1992 Olympics and 1993 World Championships===

After the heights reached in 1991, Lewis started to lose his dominance in both the sprints and the long jump. Though he anchored a world record 1:19.11 in the rarely run 4 × 200 m relay with the Santa Monica Track Club early in 1992,Track and Field News, June 1992, vol. 45, #6, p.4–5 he failed to qualify for the Olympic team in the 100 m or 200 m. In the latter race, he finished fourth at the Olympic trials behind rising star Michael Johnson who set a personal best of 19.79 s. It was the first time the two had ever met on the track.Track and Field News, August 1992, vol. 45, #6, p. 8 Lewis did, however, qualify for the long jump, finishing second behind Powell, and was eligible for the 4 × 100 m relay team.
At the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Lewis jumped 8.67 m in the first round of the long jump, beating Powell who did a final-round 8.64 m. In the 4 × 100 m relay, Lewis anchored another world record, in 37.40 s, a time which stood for 16 years. He covered the final leg in 8.85 seconds, the fastest officially recorded anchor leg ever until surpassed by Asafa Powell in 2007 with 8.84.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
Lewis competed at the 4th World Championships in Stuttgart in 1993, but finished fourth in the 100 m,Results – 100 METRES – Men – Final. 4th IAAF World Championships in Athletics Stuttgart 13/22-Aug-93. iaaf.org and did not compete in the long jump.

Injuries kept Lewis largely sidelined for next few years, then he made a comeback for the 1996 season.

===The 1996 Olympics===

Lewis qualified for the American Olympic team for the fifth time in the long jump, the only time an American man has done so.Track and Field News, September 1996, vol. 49, #9, p. 18 At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, injuries to world-record holder Mike Powell and the leading long-jumper in the world, Iván Pedroso, affected their performances. Lewis, on the other hand, was in good form. Though he did not match past performances, his third-round leap of 8.50 m won gold by 21 cm over second-place James Beckford of Jamaica.Track and Field News October 1996, vol. 49, #10, p. 36 He became one of only three Olympians to win the same individual event four times,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/profiles/bio_uk.asp?PAR_I_ID=38298 |title=International Olympic Committee – Athletes |publisher=Olympic.org |date=2004-08-13 |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] joining Danish sailor Paul Elvstrøm and discus thrower Al Oerter of the United States. Additionally, Lewis’ nine gold medals tie him for second on the list of multiple Olympic gold medalists with Paavo Nurmi, Larisa Latynina and Mark Spitz, behind American swimmer Michael Phelps.[tpl]cite book |title= The Complete Book of the Olympics: 2008 Edition |last= Wallechinsky |first= David |coauthors= Jaime Loucky |year= 2008 |publisher=Aurum Press |isbn= 978-1-84513-330-6 |page= 702 [/tpl]
Lewis' 8.50 meter jump was also officially declared tied with Larry Myricks for the masters record for the 35–39 age group.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.world-masters-athletics.org/records/outdoor-men |title=Records Outdoor Men |publisher=World-masters-athletics.org |date=2012-03-27 |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl]
Controversy struck when, as Track and Field News put it, "Lewis’ attitude in the whole relay hoo-hah a few days later served only to take the luster off his final gold." After Lewis’ unexpected long jump gold, it was noted that he could become the athlete with the most Olympic gold medals if he entered the 4 × 100 m relay team. Any member of the American Olympic men’s track and field team could be used, even if they had not qualified for the relay event. Lewis said, “If they asked me, I’d run it in a second. But they haven’t asked me to run it.” He further suggested on Larry King Live that viewers phone the United States Olympic Committee to weigh in on the situation. Lewis had skipped the mandatory relay training camp and demanded to run the anchor leg, which added to the debate. The final decision was to not add Lewis to the team. Olympic team coach Erv Hunt said, "The basis of their relay team’s opinion was 'We want to run, we worked our butts off and we deserve to be here.'"[tpl]Citation needed|date= June 2012[/tpl] The American relay team finished second behind Canada, the first time an American 4 x 100 m men’s relay team had been defeated in an Olympic final.
Lewis retired from track and field in 1997.
In 1999, Lewis was voted "Sportsman of the Century" by the International Olympic Committee,[tpl]cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Lewis,+Carl |title=Hutchinson encyclopedia article about Lewis|publisher=Encyclopedia.farlex.com |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] elected "World Athlete of the Century" by the International Association of Athletics Federations[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl] and named "Olympian of the Century" by Sports Illustrated. In 2000 his alma mater University of Houston named the Carl Lewis International Complex after him.

==Stimulant use==

In 2003, Dr. Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to Sports Illustrated which revealed that some 100 American athletes who failed drug tests from 1988 to 2000, arguing that they should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics but nevertheless cleared to compete.
Before showing the documents to Sports Illustrated Exum tried to use them in a lawsuit against USOC, accusing the organization of racial discrimination and wrongful termination against him and cover-up over the failed tests. His case was shortly dismissed by the Denver federal Court for lack of evidence. The USOC claimed his case "baseless" as he himself was the one in charge of screening the anti-doping test program of the organization and clarifying that the athletes were cleared according to the rules.Los Angeles Times, [tpl]Cite news|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2003/apr/23/sports/sp-oly23/2|title = Just a dash of drugs in Lewis, DeLoach|date = April 23, 2003 | work=Los Angeles Times|first=Alan|last=Abrahamson[/tpl]New York Times, [tpl]cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/17/sports/olympics-anti-doping-official-says-us-covered-up.html|title = Anti-Doping Official Says U.S. Covered Up|date = April 17, 2003 | work=The New York Times[/tpl]
Among the names of the athletes was Lewis. It was revealed that he tested positive three times at the 1988 Olympics Trials for minimum amounts of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, banned stimulants and bronchodilators also found in cold medication and due to the rules his case could lead to disqualification from the Seoul Olympics and from competition for six months. The levels of the combined stimulants registered in the separate tests were 2 ppm, 4 ppm and 6 ppm.Los Angeles Times, [tpl]Cite news|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2003/apr/23/sports/sp-oly23/2|title = Just a dash of drugs in Lewis, DeLoach|date = April 23, 2003 | work=Los Angeles Times|first=Alan|last=Abrahamson[/tpl] At the Olympic Trials athletes were required to declare on the drug-testing forms "over-the-counter medication, prescription drugs and any other substances you have taken by mouth, injection or by suppository". 
Lewis defended himself claiming he accidentally consumed the banned substances. After the supplements he was taking had been analyzed to prove his claims the USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use, since a dietary supplement he ingested was found to contain "Ma huang", the Chinese name for Ephedra (ephedrine is known to help weight loss). Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard were also found to have the same banned stimulants in their systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason.[tpl]cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/scorecard/news/2003/04/15/sc/ |publisher=Sports Illustrated| accessdate=October 10, 2012 | title=Scorecard[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/17/1050172709693.html |title=Carl Lewis's positive test covered up|publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2003-04-18 |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl]
The highest level of the stimulants Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988 but is now regarded as negative test. The acceptable level has been raised to ten parts per million for ephedrine and twenty-five parts per million for other substances.Wallechinsky and Loucky, The Complete Book of the Olympics (2012 edition), page 61 According to the IOC rules at the time, positive tests with levels lower than 10 ppm were cause of further investigation but not immediate ban. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who is an expert on ephedrine and other stimulants, agreed that "These levels are what you'd see from someone taking cold or allergy medicines and are unlikely to have any effect on performance."
Following Exum's revelations the IAAF acknowledged that at the 1988 Olympic Trials the USOC indeed followed the correct procedures in dealing with eight positive findings for ephedrine and ephedrine-related compounds in low concentration. The federation also reviewed in 1988 the relevant documents with the athletes' names undisclosed and stated that "the medical committee felt satisfied, however, on the basis of the information received that the cases had been properly concluded by the USOC as `negative cases' in accordance with the rules and regulations in place at the time and no further action was taken"Sports Illustrated, [tpl]Cite web|url = http://157.166.224.103/athletics/news/2003/04/30/iaaf_doping_ap/|title = IAAF: USOC followed rules over dope tests|date = April 30, 2003[/tpl]Los angeles Times, [tpl]Cite news|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2003/may/01/sports/sp-oly1|title = USOC's Actions on Lewis Justified by IAAF|date = May 1, 2003 | work=Los Angeles Times|first=Alan|last=Abrahamson[/tpl]
"Carl did nothing wrong. There was never intent. He was never told 'you violated the rules'" said Martin D.
