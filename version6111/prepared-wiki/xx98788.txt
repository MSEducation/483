[[Peak ground acceleration]]

CATEGORIES: Seismology and earthquake terminology, Earthquake engineering

Peak ground acceleration (PGA) is a measure of earthquake acceleration on the ground and an important input parameter for earthquake engineering, also known as the design basis earthquake ground motion (DBEGM)Nuclear Power Plants and Earthquakes, accessed 2011-04-08
Unlike the Richter and moment magnitude scales, it is not a measure of the total energy (magnitude, or size) of an earthquake, but rather of how hard the earth shakes in a given geographic area (the intensity). The Mercalli intensity scale uses personal reports and observations to measure earthquake intensity but PGA is measured by instruments, such as accelerographs, and it generally correlates well with the Mercalli scale.[tpl]cite web|title=ShakeMap Scientific Background.

The peak horizontal acceleration (PHA) is the most commonly used type of ground acceleration in engineering applications, and is used to set building codes and design hazard risks. In an earthquake, damage to buildings and infrastructure is related more closely to ground motion, rather than the magnitude of the earthquake.  For moderate earthquakes, PGA is  the best determinate of damage; in severe earthquakes, damage is more often correlated with peak ground velocity.

==Geophysics==

Earthquake energy is dispersed in waves from the epicentre, causing ground movement horizontally (in two directions) and vertically. PGA records the acceleration (rate of change of speed) of these movements, while peak ground velocity is the greatest speed (rate of movement) reached by the ground, and peak displacement is the distance moved.[tpl]cite web|  title=Explanation of Parameters|url=https://geohazards.usgs.gov/deaggint/2002/documentation/parm.php|work=Geologic Hazards Science Center|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=22 March 2011[/tpl] These values vary in different earthquakes, and in differing sites within one earthquake event, depending on a number of factors.  These include the length of the fault, magnitude, the depth of the quake, the distance from the epicentre, the duration (length of the shake cycle), and the geology of the ground (subsurface).  Shallow-focused earthquakes generate stronger shaking (acceleration) than intermediate and deep quakes, since the energy is released closer to the surface.[tpl]cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2007ewac.php#summary|title=Magnitude 6.6 – Near the west coast of Honshu, Japan|work=Earthquake summary|publisher=USGS|date=16 July 2001|accessdate=15 March 2011[/tpl]
Peak ground acceleration can be expressed in g (the acceleration due to Earth's gravity, equivalent to g-force) as either a decimal or percentage;  in m/s2 (1 g = 9.81 m/s2); or in Gal, where 1 Gal is equal to 0.01 m/s² (1 g = 981 Gal).
The ground type can significantly influence  ground acceleration, so PGA values can display extreme variability over distances of a few kilometers, particularly with moderate to large earthquakes.[tpl]cite web|title=ShakeMap scientific background.

Due to the complex conditions affecting PGA, earthquakes of similar magnitude can offer disparate results, with many moderate magnitude earthquakes generating significantly larger PGA values than larger magnitude quakes.
During an earthquake, ground acceleration is measured in three directions: vertically (V or UD, for up-down) and two perpendicular horizontal directions (H1 and H2), often north-south (NS) and east-west (EW).  The peak acceleration in each of these directions is recorded, with the highest individual value often reported.  Alternatively, a combined value for a given station can be noted.  The peak horizontal ground acceleration  (PHA or PHGA) can reached by selecting the higher individual recording, taking the mean of the two values, or calculating a vector sum of the two components. A three-component value can also be reached, by taking the vertical component into consideration also.
In seismic engineering, the effective peak acceleration (EPA, the maximum ground acceleration to which a building responds) is often used, which tends to be ⅔ – ¾ the PGA[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl].

==Seismic risk and engineering==

Study of geographic areas combined with an assessment of historical earthquakes allows geologists to determine seismic risk and  to create seismic hazard maps, which show the likely PGA values to be experienced in a region during an earthquake, with a probability of exceedance (PE).  Seismic engineers and government planning departments use these values to determine the appropriate earthquake loading for buildings in each zone, with key identified  structures (such as hospitals, bridges, power plants) needing to survive the maximum considered earthquake (MCE).
Damage to buildings is related to both peak ground velocity and PGA, and  the duration of the earthquake – the longer high-level shaking persists, the greater the likelihood of damage.

==Comparison of instrumental and felt intensity==

Peak ground acceleration provides a measurement of instrumental intensity, that is, ground shaking recorded by seismic instruments.  Other intensity scales measure felt intensity, based on eyewitness reports, felt shaking, and observed damage.  There is correlation between these scales, but not always absolute agreement since experiences and damage can be affected by many other factors, including the quality of earthquake engineering.
Generally speaking,

===Correlation with the Mercalli scale===

The United States Geological Survey developed an Instrumental Intensity scale which maps peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity on an intensity scale similar to the felt Mercalli scale. These values are used to create shake maps by seismologists around the world.

===Other intensity scales===

In the 7-class Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the highest intensity, Shindo 7, covers accelerations greater than 4 m/s² (0.41 g).

==PGA hazard risks worldwide==

In India, areas with expected PGA values higher than 0.36g are classed as "Zone 5", or "Very High Damage Risk Zone".
