At the end of the 18th century King Rama I submitted the city to the Ministry of Defense, which was responsible for all the southern provinces. During the administrative reform by King Chulalongkorn Phatthalung became part of the Monthon Nakhon Si Thammarat.

==Culture==

===Arts===

Manora or Nora (มโนราห์หรือโนรา) It is a kind of local performing art in the South. Phatthalung, in particular, is called an origin of the Manora dance. Assumably, it was an influence from the South of India, together with Lakhon Chatri (theatrical show by males). However, some dancing patterns were changed to match folk cultures in each province. There are 12 major dancing patterns. The audience will see dancing patterns and listen to lyrics sung by dancers, be they impromptu or composed verses.
Talung (ตะลุง) It is a popular folk performance in the South. Talung puppet figures are made of hard dried sheets of cattle hide cut and carved beautifully into characters for a shadow play. The characters are usually painted wholly in black and each of them is put firmly between a split bamboo slat called ‘Mai Tap.’ A character’s mouth and hands will be moved to accord with the narration. A Talung ensemble comprises puppet masters who are also vocalists, and a band, totalling not over 8 persons. The musical instruments include pipe, drum, Phon (a kind of local drum) and gong.

===Festivals===

Thale Noi Bird-watching Festival It was initiated in 1998 as an extra activity for the Amazing Thailand Year, and designed to suit the most important attraction of Phatthalung.
Khaeng Phon Lak Phra or Chak Phra Tradition (งานประเพณีแข่งโพนลากพระหรือชักพระ)  It is held on the fourteenth day of the waxing moon, the full moon day and the first day of the waning moon in the eleventh lunar month, which coincides with the End of Buddhist Lent. It is a tradition to move around Buddha images both by land and by river. In Phatthalung, it is observed by land. Beating Phon or local drum controls the movement of a Buddha image procession. Each procession representing a temple has its own drum beaters. When two processions meet, they exchange a challenging tune of drum beating. A Phon beating competition is, therefore, held every year at the Phatthalung Stadium and Hat Saen Suk Lampam (Lampam Beach), Amphoe Mueang Phatthalung. Activities in the event include a Phon beating contest by representatives from temples in Phatthalung and neighbouring provinces, a Phon procession contest, a Phon beating style contest, dancing performances, Sat Tom (throwing a traditional dessert made of sticky rice wrapped with a young leaf of Kapho or mangrove fan palm), a Buddha image procession contest, religious rites, water sports on the Lampam Lake, local arts and exhibition of Phatthalung and nearby provinces, such as Krachut or bulrush mat weaving and coconut shell products.
