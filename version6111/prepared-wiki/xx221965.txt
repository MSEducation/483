==Song information==

The song was originally written by Jim Steinman, Tony Hendra and Sean Kelly (and sung by Michael Simmons) for the short-lived television comedy series, Delta House. Steinman reworked the melody into the song "Dead Ringer for Love" for the Dead Ringer album, while portions of the lyric would later appear in his "Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young" Cher also wrote the song but remains uncredited.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.realmofdreams.com/steinman/sounds.html|title=Delta House Theme (Extended Version) - Michael Simmons|accessdate=2009-01-26|work=Realmofdreams[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The song was performed many times by Loaf but never by Cher. There is no footage of Cher and Loaf ever performing this song live together, and Cher appeared only in the music video. 
The song performed by Loaf is available in two live CDs; Live Around the World and Bat out of Hell: Live with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The song was also used in the Loaf's Hits out of Hell and in Cher's Greatest Hits: 1965–1992 compilations. The song can also be found on Cher's album Essential Collection. 
The track was released in the United Kingdom in November 1981 and debuted at number 63 on the UK Singles Chart, it slowly climbed the chart and peaked at number five in early February 1982.
Allmusic editor William Ruhlmann highlighted the song.Review by Allmusic, Retrieved 15 October 2013 Also, Donald A. Guarisco praised the lyrics "The tongue-in-cheek lyrics tell the tale of a guy who’s realized he cant "live by rock ‘n’ roll and brew alone" and sets his sights on his ideal woman (...) The lyric devotes equal time to his vampy object of affection", and added that "This unique blend of vocal and instrumental firepower makes "Dead Ringer For Love" feel like a long-lost outtake from the Grease soundtrack on steroids."Song review by AllmusicRetrieved October 15 2013
