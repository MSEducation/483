The marching band is also a longstanding tradition at Ohio State. It is the largest all-brass and percussion band in the world. The traditional school songs from "Carmen Ohio" to "Hang on Sloopy" to "Fight the Team Across the Field", are arranged to fit this instrumentation. The band is famous for "Script Ohio", during which the band marches single-file through the curves of the word "Ohio", much like a pen writes the word, all the while playing the French march "Le Regiment de Sambre et Meuse." At the end of the performance, the "i" in "Ohio" is "dotted" by a high-stepping senior sousaphone player.
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games are: Across the Field, The Ohio State University fight song and "Buckeye Battle Cry".
The tradition of high quality bands is not limited to the football field. OSU's School of Music contains several high quality concert bands consisting of graduate and undergraduate music majors and non-music majors. The OSU Wind Symphony, frequently receives praise on the national level, recently having been selected to perform at the 2003 College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA) Convention and at the Ohio Music Educators Association Conference in 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2008; the OSU Symphonic Band performed in 2007.

In 2007, Buckeye Bullet 2 was launched.  This follow-up effort was a collaboration between Ohio State engineering students and engineers from the Ford Motor Company and will seek to break the landspeed record for hydrogen cell powered vehicles.Buckeye Bullet 2.
A unique aspect to Ohio State's multi billion dollar endowment is the Student Investment Management Program.

===Residential life===

Ohio State operates 31 on-campus residence halls divided into three geographic clusters: South Campus (site of the university's original dormitories) (currently include joint dorms known as Steeb-Smith and Park-Stradley), North Campus (largely constructed during the post-war enrollment boom) and West Campus or "The Towers."  Within the residence hall system are 40 smaller living and learning environments defined by social or academic considerations.  Ohio State also offers four honors residence halls: Bradley Hall, Lincoln House, Siebert Hall, and Taylor Tower.
Separate housing for graduate and professional students is maintained on the Southern tier of campus near the medical complex.  Family housing is maintained at Buckeye Village at the far northern edge of campus beyond the athletic complex.  At the university's southeast corner along High Street, and across from the Moritz College of Law, new apartments have been built for law students in conjunction with the area's Campus Gateway project.

===Honors programs===

Ohio State offers two distinct honors programs for high ability undergraduates: Honors and Scholars. The Honors program is open to students in all majors.  The Scholars program is centered around thirteen specific programs such as "Architecture Scholars", "Media, Marketing, and Communications Scholars","Biological Sciences Scholars", "International Affairs Scholars", "Business Scholars" and "Politics, Society and Law Scholars."  Students in the Scholars program are expected to live and take select classes with other members of the program.  Additionally, Ohio State offers the Honors Collegium with membership extended to ten incoming freshmen and following the Spring of a student's first or second year to the university's top undergraduates.  Collegium students try to compete for internships, graduate schools and nationally competitive awards, such as the Marshall, Rhodes, or Truman Scholarships.
Ohio State also administers two large-scale scholarship programs to ensure access to the university to high-ability students from low-income or traditionally underrepresented groups.  The first of these, The Young Scholars Program, was initiated in 1988.  120 promising minority students from Ohio's nine largest urban public school districts are selected prior to entering high school.  The program offers a series of academic camps each summer and counseling throughout the students' high school careers.  Upon completion of the program, which also mandates a college preparatory curriculum and minimum grade point average, the students are guaranteed admission to Ohio State as well as any need-based financial aid necessary.  The Land Grant Scholarship was initiated in 2005.  This program seeks to ensure access to Ohio State to high-ability students from low-income backgrounds.  Ohio State has committed to offering a full-ride scholarship each academic year to at least one student from each of Ohio's 88 counties.
Ohio State maintains an honors center in the Kuhn Honors and Scholars House, which had served as the University President's residence until the 1960s. Three dormitories are designated all or in part as honors residences: Taylor, Bradley, and Lincoln.

===Activities and organizations===

The Ohio Union was the first student union built by an American public university.  The Ohio Union is dedicated to the enrichment of the student experience, on and off The Ohio State University campus.  The first Ohio Union, located on the south edge of the South Oval, was constructed in 1909 and was later renamed Enarson Hall. The second Ohio Union was completed in 1950 and was located prominently along High Street, southeast of the Oval. It was a center of student life at The Ohio State University for more than 50 years, providing facilities for student activities, organizations and events, and serving as an important meeting place for campus and community interaction. In addition, many student services and programs were housed in the union, along with dining and recreational facilities. The second Ohio Union was demolished in February 2007 to make way for the new Ohio Union, which was finished in 2010.  During this time, student activities had been relocated to Ohio Stadium and other academic buildings.
