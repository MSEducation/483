[[SH2D3C]]

SH2 domain containing 3C, also known as SH2D3C, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SH2D3C gene.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: SH2D3C SH2 domain containing 3C| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=10044| accessdate = [/tpl]

==Function==

Sh2d3c is a gene on human chromosome 9 that encodes an SH2 domain containing protein known as NSP3.  The mouse homologue is found on chromosome 2.  The NSP (Novel SH2-containing Protein) family of proteins contains three members, NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3 (this protein), all of which have a similar architecture, with an N-terminal SH2 domain, a proline serine rich region, which contains consensus sequences for MAP kinase substrates, and a conserved C-terminus, which binds to the Cas family of adapter proteins, and also shows homology to GEF domains.  
NSP3 was originally identified by three independent groups of researchers.[tpl]cite journal  | author=Lu Y, Brush J, Stewart TA |title=NSP1 defines a novel family of adaptor proteins linking integrin and tyrosine kinase receptors to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. |journal=J.

The shorter isoform, known as Chat (Cas/Hef1 associated signal transducer) is expressed in brain, lung, heart, kidney, muscle, liver, and intestine, while the larger isoform, known as Chat-H (the "H" is for Hematopoietic), is expressed in spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes.  The two isoforms differ only in their N-terminus, which has been shown by one group to be important for membrane localization.[tpl]cite journal  | author=Regelmann AG, Danzl NM, Wanjalla C, Alexandropoulos K |title=The hematopoietic isoform of Cas-Hef1-associated signal transducer regulates chemokine-induced inside-out signaling and T cell trafficking |journal=Immunity |volume=25 |issue= 6 |pages= 907–18 |year= 2006 |pmid=17174122 |doi=10.1016/j.immuni.2006.09.014  [/tpl]
Through its interaction with Hef1, Chat-H, has been shown to be an important regulator of lymphocyte adhesion, acting upstream of Rap1 in the integrin activation pathway.
