==History==

York University was established in 1959 as a non-denominational institution by the York University Act.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/documents/act1959.htm |title=York University Act, 1959 |publisher=Yorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02[/tpl] which received Royal Assent in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario on 26 March of that year.[tpl]cite web|author=P. Anisef And J. Lennards |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008242 |title=University |publisher=Thecanadianencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02[/tpl] Its first class was held in September 1960York University. The Canadian Encyclopedia. Retrieved on 2010-12-11. in Falconer Hall on the University of Toronto campus with a total of 76 students.
The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906, which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.
In the fall of 1961, York moved to its first campus, Glendon College, and began to emphasize liberal arts and part-time adult education. It became independent in 1965, after an initial period of affiliation with the University of Toronto (U of T), under the York University Act, 1965.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/documents/act1965.htm |title=York University Act, 1965 |publisher=Yorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02[/tpl] Its main campus on the northern outskirts of Toronto opened in 1965.
Murray Ross, who continues to be honoured today at the University in several ways – including the Murray G. Ross Award, was still vice-president of U of T when he was approached to become York University's new president.[tpl]cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005[/tpl] At the time, York University was envisaged as a feeder campus to U of T, until Ross's powerful vision led it to become a completely separate institution.Ross, Murray. The Way Must be Tried: Memoirs of a University Man. Toronto: Stoddart Publishing Company, 1992.
In 1965, the university opened a second campus, the Keele Campus, in North York. The Glendon campus became a bilingual liberal arts college led by Escott Reid, who envisaged it as a national institution to educate Canada's future leaders, a vision shared by Prime Minister Lester Pearson, who formally opened Glendon College in 1966.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/ycom/gazette/past/archive/031198.htm#gen3 |title=York University Gazette Online |publisher=Yorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://www.library.yorku.ca/dspace/handle/123456789/701 |title=YorkSpace: Item 123456789/701 |publisher=Library.yorku.ca |date=1966-09-30 |accessdate=2011-03-02[/tpl]
The first Canadian undergraduate program in dance opened at York University in 1970. In 1972, Canada Post featured the nascent institution on 8¢ stamps, entitled York University Campus, North York, Ont.[tpl]cite web|url=http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=(University.TITP.)+Or+(University.TITI.+And+null.B742.)&l=20&d=STMP&p=1&u=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/02011702_e.html&r=16&f=G&Sect1=STMP |title=Postage Stamp |publisher=Data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-01-06[/tpl] The first Canadian PhD. program in Women's Studies opened with five candidates in January 1992.
Its bilingual mandate and focus on the liberal arts continue to shape Glendon's special status within York University.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/ycom/profiles/past/aug00/current/features/article1.htm |title=Profiles Online – August 2000 – Features: GUIDING PRINCIPALS |publisher=Yorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02[/tpl] The new Keele Campus was regarded as somewhat isolated, in a generally industrialized part of the city. Petrol storage facilities are still located across the street. Some of the early architecture was unpopular with many, not only for the brutalist designs, but the vast expanses between buildings, which was not viewed as suitable for the climate. In the last two decades, the campus has been intensified with new buildings, including a dedicated student centre and new fine arts, computer science and business administration buildings, a small shopping mall, and a hockey arena. The Rexall Centre tennis stadium, built in 2004, is a perennial host of the Canada Masters tennis tournament. As Toronto has spread further out, York has found itself in a relatively central location within the built-up Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and in particular, near the Jane and Finch neighbourhood. Its master plan envisages a denser on-campus environment commensurate with that location. Students occupied the university's administration offices in March 1997, protesting escalating tuition hikes.
On November 6, 2008, the York University Senate suspended classes because of a strike by CUPE Local 3903. The local represents contract professors, teaching assistants, and graduate assistants. Classes resumed on Monday, February 2, 2009 after back-to-work legislation was passed by the Ontario Legislative Assembly[tpl]cite web|url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/toronto/archive/2008/11/05/classes-suspended-as-strike-hits-york-university.aspx |title=National Post.

===Faculties===

York University has eleven faculties, including the Faculties of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies (which was formed in July 2009 by the merger of the Atkinson Faculty of Liberal and Professional Studies and the Faculty of Arts), Science, Health, the Lassonde School of Engineering, Education, Fine Arts, Environmental Studies, the Schulich School of Business, Osgoode Hall Law School, Glendon College, and Graduate Studies.

Also, the Glendon and Schulich units are offering or are in the processes of preparing to offer degrees in public policy and administration. The University administration has, however, taken steps in some cases to unify departments in separate faculties, in part to support York's efforts to brand itself as a university focused on interdisciplinarity. For example, the Faculty of Health, opened on 1 July 2006, houses the School of Health Policy and Management, School of Kinesiology and Health Science, School of Nursing, and the Department of Psychology.

====Faculties====

====Seneca@York====

The Keele campus is host to a satellite facility of Seneca College,Seneca College, Seneca@York Campus. Location map for campus. and York University offers a number of joint programs with Seneca College:

===Libraries===

There are five libraries at York University.  Four of these libraries constitute the York University Libraries system: the Scott Library, Steacie Science and Engineering Library, Peter F. Bronfman Business Library, and the Leslie Frost Library (on Glendon Campus).   The fifth library, the Osgoode Hall Law Library, reports to the Dean of the Osgoode Hall Law School.  The Scott Library also contains within it the Clara Thomas Archives and Special Collections, the Map Library and the Sound and Moving Images Library.  Although the Archives of Ontario moved to York's Keele campus in April 2009, it is not affiliated with York University Libraries.

==Campuses==

===Keele Campus===

York's primary campus ("The Keele Campus") is located in the north of the City of Toronto and bordering York Region. It is the largest post-secondary campus in Canada at 457 acres.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/vpfa/aboutvpfa.html |title=Vice-President Finance and Administration of York University |publisher=Yorku.ca |date=2013-09-18 |accessdate=2014-01-06[/tpl] Most of the University's faculties reside here, including Liberal Arts, Fine Arts, Business, Law, Environmental Studies, Science and Engineering, Education, and Health. All together, nearly 50,000 students attend classes on the Keele campus.
York has over 200,000 living alumni. Although a large number of alumni live in Ontario, a significant number live in British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Alberta, New York, and Washington, D.C.  York also has over 25,000 alumni overseas.

===Glendon campus===

Glendon College, a bilingual liberal arts faculty which conducts its own recruitment and admissions and hosts its own academic programs, is also housed on its own campus on Bayview Avenue in North Toronto. Glendon is the only university-level institution in central Southern Ontario that offers university courses in both French and English; others elsewhere in Ontario include the University of Ottawa and Laurentian University in Sudbury. A shuttle bus runs regularly between the Glendon and the Keele campuses. Glendon students are free to take courses at the Keele campus (and vice-versa). However, there are students who consider getting from one campus to the other to be inconvenient, and thus the attractiveness of this option is not universal.

===Satellite campuses===

While most of the Schulich School of Business and Osgoode Hall Law School programs are offered at the Keele Campus, both of them maintain satellite facilities in downtown Toronto. Schulich operates the Miles S. Nadal Management Centre, while Osgoode Hall has a Professional Development Centre located at 1 Dundas Street West.

==Student life==

York University has over 54,000 students: about 48,000 undergraduates (approximately 38,500 of which are full-time and 7,500 part-time) and 5,900 graduate students.[tpl]cite web|title=Vital Statistics|url=http://www.yorku.ca/gro/York%20101.ppt|accessdate=29 November 2013[/tpl] Many students come from the Greater Toronto Area, but there is a sizeable population of students from across Canada and abroad, making York one of the most international universities in Canada. To serve this large population, there are 290 student clubs and organizations; six student-run publications and three broadcast programs; six art galleries; 33 on-campus eateries; and a retail mall. Undergraduate students at York are represented by the York Federation of Students, a student-elected body that sponsors most of the clubs, and engages in lobbying with the university administration as well as the provincial and federal governments. [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]

===Colleges and residences===

York has nine undergraduate residential colleges:

====The Village at York University====

The Village at York University http://studenthousing.info.yorku.ca/files/2012/10/Village.pdf off-campus student housing area has become a popular area of accommodation for many upper-year and post-graduate students, and the area has had a large amount of attention particularly for large parties hosted by students, including the annual Battle of the Village kegger held in March. There have also been many reports of the level of noise pollution from late-night parties from students living in the area.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/SpecialSections/SchoolsGuide/article/257819 |title=Schools Guide|York University: The city within a city |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2008-08-25 |accessdate=2011-03-02 |location=Toronto |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] Safety has also been a pressing issue.
The Village is a residential neighbourhood within the City of Toronto, occupying about 130 acres beyond the south boundary of York University's property. Residential dwellings in The Village are privately owned, and homeowners in this community are City of Toronto taxpayers. York University participates in the Village At York Town and Gown Committee, with representatives of residents of The Village; the York Federation of Students; Toronto Police Service and Toronto Fire Service, as well as other key municipal agencies and the local Councillors' office. This committee addresses concerns of residents, students, the City and the University, such as community safety and by-law enforcement and compliance.

===Newspapers and other publications===

Excalibur has been the university's autonomous student newspaper since 1966. In 2008, the YU Free Press was formed as an alternative campus newspaper.http://yufreepress.org/
Colleges and some programs also have individual newspapers or magazines. They include: The Flying Walrus (Stong College), MacMedia (McLaughlin College), The Pipe (Calumet College), Artichoke (Winters College), SOFA (Spotlight On Fine Arts), The Lexicon (Norman Bethune College), The Vandoo (Vanier College), The Phoenix (Founders College), Pro Tem (Glendon College), Obiter Dicta (Osgoode Law School), and The Insider (Schulich School of Business).
Existere – Journal of Arts and Literature (est. 1978) is a national publication with local and international contributors. It is financed by Vanier College Council. The journal publishes short fiction, poetry, non-fiction and art from novices and seasoned veterans. Several major writers got their early start in Existere.
YorkU Magazine (est. 2003) is the official magazine of York University. It is published 3 times a year in both a print and digital format.

===Sport===

The University is represented in Canadian Interuniversity Sport by the York Lions. Beginning in 1968 York's sporting teams were known as the "Yeomen", after the Yeomen Warders, the guardians of the fortress and palace at the Tower of London, otherwise known as Beefeaters. Later, the name "Yeowomen" was introduced to encourage women to participate in sports. Popular sentiment ran against this name scheme, however, as many students were fond of noting that a "Yeowoman" was fictitious, neither a real word nor having any historical merit. In 2003, after conducting an extensive internal study, the University replaced both names with the "Lions", as part of a larger renaming effort, and a new logo, now a white and red lion, was brought into line with the university's new visual scheme. The name change also brought York University in line with the 92% of other Canadian universities which use a single name for both sexes' sports teams. Ironically, students often refer to the female Lions teams as the "York Lionesses", even though the name "Lion" is intended to apply to both sexes.Canadian Interuniversity Sport. Universitysport.ca. Retrieved on 2010-12-11.
York offers 29 interuniversity sport teams, 12 sport clubs, 35 intramural sport leagues, special events and 10 pick-up sport activities offered daily.
York University has several athletic facilities, some of which are used for major tournaments. These include a football stadium, 4 gymnasia, 5 sport playing fields, 4 softball fields, 9 outdoor tennis courts, 5 squash courts, 3 dance/aerobic studios, 6 ice arenas, a swimming pool, an expanding fitness centre and the new Rexall Centre (home of the Rogers Tennis Cup).
In 2005, plans were made to build a new football and soccer stadium to host the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League and future football tournaments. These plans were scuttled, however, when a deal was signed by the Argos to remain at the Rogers Centre.

====Fight song====

Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games are: "York Song", sung to the tune "Harvard".[tpl]cite web|author=Rebecca Green |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000759SUBReadings |title=Fight Songs |publisher=Thecanadianencyclopedia.com |date=1990-10-09 |accessdate=2011-03-02[/tpl]
At sporting events, and in a host of frosh week events on campus, students are often heard singing and chanting the cheer "Deep in the Heart":
Another York Fight song that is used at Homecoming games is:
There are also college songs, particularly from the friendly feuds between Stong College and Bethune College, and the infamous Winters College and Vanier College cheer songs.

===Fraternities and sororities===

With both fraternities and sororities operating on campus, York University is home to a vibrant "Greek" community. Though the organizations are not officially recognized by the University, they do provide member students with valuable experiences throughout their post-secondary academic careers to supplement campus life. Many lifelong friendships are forged through these societies, which place a great deal of emphasis on academic achievement, leadership and philanthropy.

====Organizations====

Over the years, fraternities and sororities have operated unofficially on campus:
Fraternities:
Sororities:
Phi Delta Phi (ΦΔΦ) international legal fraternity, at Osgoode Law School, was given special dispensation when the law school became part of the university, as the fraternity's history with the law school dated back to 1896, and is recognized at York.

==Transit==

York University is sometimes referred to as a "commuter school". Over 65% of the students and staff have home addresses in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), particularly in York Region and downtown Toronto. Many students are opting for public transit owing to York's high parking fees. York intends to increase the fees for parking to combat congestion around campus and to support the goal of making Toronto more environmentally friendly.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
Close to fourteen hundred buses move people through the campus each day. An extension of the Yonge-University-Spadina line of the Toronto Subway is currently under construction. It will run directly under the campus, creating new stations at Keele Street and Finch Avenue (as Finch West station), at the centre of campus (as York University station), and at Steeles Avenue, interfacing with York Regional Transit (as Black Creek Pioneer Village station).
York University's Glendon and Keele campuses are served by the TTC. The Keele site is also served by York Region Transit buses (both regular and Viva) from the immediate north, GO Transit express buses from several other Toronto suburbs and colleges or universities (such as Sheridan College and UOIT) along with Greyhound buses for regional transportation. Transportation Services operates a shuttle service to GO Transit's York University train station on its Barrie corridor. As of November 20, 2009, express buses on the highly frequent 196 York University Rocket Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) bus route now use the dedicated York University Busway to transport students from Downsview station to York Lanes in about 15 minutes. It consists of bus-only lanes on Allen Road and Dufferin Street, and bus-only roadways through a hydro corridor north of Finch Avenue West, and along the east side of the campus. As of September 20, 2010, the Züm Route 501 provides service from Bramalea Terminal in Brampton to York University.

==Campus safety==

York University is physically located in a diverse area of Toronto. York University Department of Security Services provides security services on the university's campuses. York Security Services provide uniformed security staff which consist of campus liaison officers (community services unit) and the Investigative Unit which works closely with the Toronto Police Services. The investigative unit and Toronto Police Investigative Units and 31 Division work jointly on serious investigations. Patrols are conducted on foot, bicycle and vehicle. The security service is a member of the Ontario Association of College and University Security Administrators (OACUSA) and the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators (IACLEA). The campus community is over 55,000 people.
The department uses marked Ford Crown Victorias which are clearly identifiable with low-profile LED roof lights. The department responds to all calls for service, however incidents of a criminal nature should be reported to Toronto Police. Uniform security staff can be clearly identified by their dark cargo-style pants, red shirt (York University colour) and black exterior body armour (bulletproof vest covers). Residence watch staff are also posted nightly at all undergraduate residence buildings to provide an extra level of protection. As part of the campus safety system a student escort service is available to all members of the community. The escort staff are students hired on a part-time basis. In an emergency escort staff have immediate communication with Security Services.

===Incidents===

In June 2008, the university announced it had commissioned an external safety audit after a string of rapes on the university campus. During frosh week 2007, two men entered a campus dormitory and raped two students.[tpl]cite news|last=Kim|first=Yuni|title=York safety audit MIA|url=http://www.newsite.excal.on.ca/cms2/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5907:york-safety-audit-mia&catid=6:news&Itemid=66|accessdate=6 January 2014|newspaper=Excalibur (newspaper)|date=31 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526094617/http://www.newsite.excal.on.ca/cms2/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5907:york-safety-audit-mia&catid=6:news&Itemid=66|archivedate=26 May 2010[/tpl]York University rapist gets 8 years in prison - Crime - Canoe.ca.

==Controversies==

===Violation of academic freedom===

In the aftermath of an academic conference that took place in 2009, titled "Israel/Palestine: Mapping Models of Statehood and Paths to Peace",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/ipconf |title=Israel/Palestine: Mapping Models of Statehood and Paths to Peace conference |publisher=Yorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02[/tpl] which explored the possible models of statehood for Israel/Palestine, including the one state model, concerns were raised about the way the York Administration has handled the political pressure.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/controversy-brews-over-yorks-handling-of-conference-on-mideast/article1531004/ |title=Globe and Mail |publisher=Globe and Mail |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02 |location=Toronto[/tpl] Some of the organizers accused the York administration, mainly the then Dean of the Osgoode Hall Law School and the Associate Vice President for Research and Innovation, of putting undue pressure on the organizers in order to force them to change the content of the conference, invite or disinvite some speakers. The accusations[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fragilefreedomatyorku.ca/academic-freedom/field-notes/introduction/ |title=Accusations by conference organizers |publisher=Fragilefreedomatyorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02[/tpl] were supported by documents and emails that were obtained through the Freedom of Information and Privacy Protection Act.
The York administration appointed former Supreme Court of Canada Judge to review the issue, but the Iacobucci Review was problematic, and the terms of reference[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fragilefreedomatyorku.ca/academic-freedom/administrative-response/objections-to-iacobucci/ |title=Terms of Reference of Iacobucci review |publisher=Fragilefreedomatyorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02[/tpl] for the review were seen as an attack on academic freedom. The whole issue is being investigated by the Canadian Association of University Teachers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.caut.ca/news_details.asp?nid=1370&page=490 |title=Canadian Association of University Teachers |publisher=Caut.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02[/tpl]
In response to the allegations made, a University spokesperson said that the University should be judged the fact that event took place despite the pressure not to hold it, and that there is always internal discussion as part of the planning of all events. He added that "In the end, this conference did go on and we do not feel that academic freedom was breached."This page is available to GlobePlus subscribers. Theglobeandmail.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-11. Vice President and Provost, Patrick Monahan, said, about these allegation  that "Justice Iacobucci has looked at that and he doesn’t see any purpose in conducting further inquiries. Obviously there are a lot of different views about it.” Yet, it seems that the Iaccobucci Report is seen by many faculty members at Osgoode as controversial. In a letter from the Osgoode Hall Faculty Association, the Association said that it "considers the Iacobucci Report to be unsound and unreliable."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fragilefreedomatyorku.ca/wp-content/uploads/file/OHFA%20LETTER%20TO%20SENATE.pdf |title=letter from the Osgoode Hall Faculty Association |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02[/tpl] The Association also said that "the Report both jeopardizes academic freedom and fails to consider the troubling conduct of the York officials."

===Intimidation of Pro-Israel groups===

On February 11, 2009, approximately 100 pro-Palestinian students reportedly initiated a near-riot against a group of Jewish students during a news conference where speakers called for the impeachment of the York Federation of Students (YFS) executive. According to witnesses, the demonstrators, which reportedly consisted of members of the YFS and Students Against Israeli Apartheid (SAIA), shouted “Zionism equals racism!” and “Racists off campus!” One witness stated that “a riot broke out. They supporters started banging the door and windows, intimidating Jewish students and screaming antisemitic slurs.” The students barricaded themselves inside the Hillel offices, where protesters reportedly banged on the windows and attempted to force their way in.  Eventually police were called to escort Jewish students through the protesters.Democracy takes a beating at York by Atara Beck, The Jewish Tribune, February 17, 2009.An eyewitness account of this week's aggressive intimidation of Jewish students at York University by Jonathan Blake Karoly, National Post, February 12, 2009.Campuses awash in tension over Israel apartheid week By Craig Offman, National Post, March 3, 2009 (posted on Canada.com).York University sanctions student groups over rally clashes, National Post, March 5, 2009  The claims of anti-Semitic slurs were not reported by the media that were present at the time, as many believe that this accusation lacks credibility.http://www.zcommunications.org/the-israel-advocacy-push-to-reclaim-york-university-by-dan-freeman-maloy
Krisna Saravanamuttu, York Federation of Students' vice-president of equity, who took part in the protest, denied that the protesters shouted anti-semitic slogans, stating that "That is categorically false.

He did however, confirm that the protesters shouted "racism off campus" and "students united will never be defeated."Push to oust York student leaders stirs ethnic tensions by Elizabeth Church and Omar El Akkad, Globecampus.ca (The Globe and Mail), February 13, 2009.

In May 2009, York adjudicator Janet Mosher, who is an associate dean at York’s Osgoode Hall Law School, ruled that two York students, Krisna Saravanamuttu and Jesse Zimmerman, had violated the Student Code of Conduct due to their behaviour at the protest, which she described as “exclusionary and offensive” and which promoted an atmosphere of “hostility, incivility and intimidation.” Mosher noted that both students participated in the protest which pursued a group of Jewish students to Hillel’s lounge in York’s Student Centre, and swarmed outside shouting taunts. On a video of the incident, Saravanamuttu was shown clapping and apparently leading a chant of “Whose campus? Our campus!” as well as  participating in a chant of “Racists off campus." Saravanamuttu was fined $150 and both he and Zimmerman were given an official reprimand and human rights training.Two York students sanctioned over confrontation, Yfile, York's Daily Bulletin, May 26, 2009.Sanctions, reprimand imposed on York students, Jewish Tribune staff, Jewish Tribune, May 26, 2009.Jewish group questions TTC advisory panel choice by Megan O'Toole, National Post, March 8, 2010.
In February 2010, the campus group the Christians United for Israel (CUFI) and My Canada applied to use university space to host the Imagine With Usimaginewithus.ca  coalition event consisting of pro-Israel speakers. The University replied that the event could only proceed under certain conditions (which ultimately led to the event's cancellation when the organizers declined to comply with the terms):
These conditions drew criticism because they were not imposed on the organizers of Israel Apartheid Week which was being held on campus the same month.York University discriminates against Christian and Jewish coalition ahead of Israel Apartheid Week, Jewish Tribune, February 24, 2010. York's decision drew sharp criticism from David Frum who wrote in the National Post that "Since the anti-Israel people might use violence, the speech of the pro-Israel people must be limited. On the other hand, since the pro-Israel people do not use violence, the speech of the anti-Israel people can proceed without restraint." A York University spokesman subsequently told Frum that "all student groups that request university space" must meet "precisely same requirements" but that while the “process” and the “protocols” that were the same, a “needs-based assessment” of each particular case is necessary. Frum subsequently criticized the "utterly arbitrary ad hoc decision-making of a fathomlessly cowardly university administration." Frank Dimant, CEO of B'nai Brith Canada also sharply criticized York's justification, arguing that "York’s continued appeasement of anti-Israel agitators at the expense of Zionist Christians and Jews is unacceptable.”David Frum: Something's seriously wrong at York University by David Frum, National Post, February 27, 2010.
Professor Ed Morgan of the University of Toronto criticized York, citing a 1992 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that struck down a county government's increased fee for police protection for a controversial speaker because "speech cannot be financially burdened, any more than it can be punished or banned, simply because it might offend a hostile mob." Regarding the situation at York, Morgan wrote that "It's bad enough that there are "hostile mobs" on our campuses; making others pay for that hostility only rubs salt in our wounded freedoms."Free speech versus safety at York University, National Post, March 2, 2010.[tpl]dead link|date=March 2011[/tpl] Prof. Howard C.

===Strikes===

York University has a history of faculty and teaching assistant strikes. In 1997, there was a faculty strike by YUFA[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yufa.org/ |title=yufa.org |publisher=yufa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-06[/tpl] that lasted seven weeks. At the time, this was the second longest strike in Canadian University history.[tpl]cite web|last=Ripley|first=Louise|title=March 1997 YUFA On the Picket Lines|url=http://www.yufa.org/news/TenthAnniversaryStrike.html|publisher=YUFA|accessdate=6 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222015854/http://www.yufa.org/news/TenthAnniversaryStrike.html|archivedate=22 December 2008|date=20 March 2007[/tpl]
Key issues in the strike included retirement, funding, and institutional governance. In 2001, teaching assistants and contract faculty went on strike for 11 weeks, when the university broke its own record.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/article/532380|work=The Star|location=Toronto|title=Strike brings York to standstill|first=Louise|last=Brown|date=November 7, 2008[/tpl] The central issue in the 2001 disruption was the administration's proposed attempts to remove tuition indexation language.
A strike beginning on November 6, 2008York University Strike CUPE 3903 TAs Contract Faculty GAs & RAs. 3903strike.ca. Retrieved on 2010-12-11. concerned a variety of institutional grievances, including job security for contract professors, elimination of the Non-Academic Student Code of Conduct, creation of whistleblower protection, and fund indexation. On January 20, 2009, CUPE 3903 defeated a forced ratification vote that would have ended the strike. On January 24, Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty announced a rare Sunday recall of the provincial legislature in order to pass back-to-work legislation mandating an immediate end to the strike."Ontario to legislate end to York University strike", CBC News, January 24, 2009. On January 29, the York University Labour Disputes Resolution Act was passed in the provincial parliament on a count of 42–8 ending the long 85-day strike and setting a precedent for future university strikes in Ontario.

===Issuance of parking tickets===

Toronto City Counciler Howard Moscoe claims that York University is illegally issuing parking tickets to persons parking on York University property.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/city-councillor-tells-york-students-not-to-pay-parking-tickets-1.786475 |title=City councillor tells York students not to pay parking tickets - Toronto - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2014-01-06[/tpl] Legally the City of Toronto is the only regulatory body allowed to issue parking tickets. York University refuses to surrender student transcripts to students who have failed to pay parking fees. York University spokesman Richard Fisher states "It's identical to when you renew your taxi or driver's licences.  Unless you pay your fines, you don't get it renewed and that's because that's their last opportunity to actually get you before you depart.  And I think we are in the same situation."
