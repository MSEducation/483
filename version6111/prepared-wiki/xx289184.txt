The company began to run into difficulty in the late 1880s. Its mines were increasingly scattered and expensive. The rail network had a variety of gauges and used a mix of stationary engines and locomotives. Some of the plant was obsolete and operations were generally inefficient.[tpl]sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=18[/tpl]
However, there was continued demand for "Best Yorkshire Iron" for applications where safety was critically important.
In 1888 Low Moor was converted to a limited liability company, although descendants of the founders retained control.
The directors planned two new blast furnaces at the New Works, each [tpl]convert|70|ft[/tpl] high, with capacities of 340 and 240 tons per week.[tpl]sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=19[/tpl]
The first came into operation in 1892. In 1905 an electrical power station was built at the New Works, with boilers fired by gas from the blast furnaces. Apart from the heaviest machines, steam drives were replaced by electrical drives.[tpl]sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=21[/tpl] 
The outbreak of World War I (1914–1918) caused a temporary surge in demand for shell casings and drop forgings, including shoes for the tracks of the first tanks.[tpl]sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=20[/tpl]
After the war it was clear that future demand for wrought iron was uncertain. The company was taken over by Robert Heath & Sons of Staffordshire, creating a new company called Robert Heath And Low Moor Ltd. Efforts were made to reduce costs, although this affected quality.[tpl]sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=21[/tpl] 
Attempts to use high-sulphur coal created serious problems and destroyed the reputation of the works as a supplier of high quality iron, while a slump in heavy industry in the 1920s further reduced demand. The company poured money into attempts to diversify the operations, but did not succeed. In 1928 the company was declared bankrupt, and the Low Moor assets bought by Thos. W. Ward Ltd. Many of the mines, tracks and plant were closed or dismantled.[tpl]sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=22[/tpl] 
Some buildings were sold or leased to other companies, and some plant was modernised. Wrought iron production finally ended in 1957. 
As of 1971 new owners were producing alloy steel, making about 350 tons per week.[tpl]sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=23[/tpl]
