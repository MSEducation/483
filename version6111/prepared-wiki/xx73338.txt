The KVLY-TV mast (formerly the KTHI-TV mast) is a 2,063 ft (628.8 m) tall television-transmitting mast in Blanchard, Traill County, North Dakota, United States, used by Fargo station KVLY-TV channel 11. Completed in 1963, it was the tallest structure ever built until succeeded by the Warsaw radio mast in 1974; that mast collapsed in 1991, making the KVLY-TV mast again the tallest structure in the world until the Burj Khalifa overtook it in 2010. It remains the third-tallest structure in the world (since the construction of the Tokyo Skytree), and the tallest structure in the western hemisphere. It is a guyed mast, not a self-supporting structure, and is therefore not included in lists of tallest buildings. The height of the transmitting antenna itself is [tpl]convert|113|ft|m[/tpl] and is included in the height of the tower as the lattice tower itself ends around [tpl]convert|1950|ft|m[/tpl].[tpl]cite news| title= N.D.

==Overview==

The tower is located [tpl]convert|3|mi|km[/tpl] west of Blanchard, North Dakota, halfway between Fargo and Grand Forks.  It became the tallest artificial structure, and the first man-made structure to exceed [tpl]convert|2000|ft|m[/tpl] in height, upon the completion of its construction on August 13, 1963.  
The tower was built by Hamilton Erection Company of York, South Carolina and Kline Iron and Steel, and took thirty days to complete, at a cost of US$500,000.
Owned by Hoak Media of Dallas, Texas, the tower broadcasts at 356 kW on Channel 44 for television station KVLY-TV (channel 11 PSIP, an NBC affiliate) which is based in Fargo.  The tower provides a broadcast area of roughly [tpl]convert|9700|sqmi|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] which is a radius of about [tpl]convert|55.6|mi|km[/tpl].
Its height above mean sea level is [tpl]convert|3038|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. Some time after its completion, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposed a policy that states, "Although there is no absolute height limit for antenna towers, both agencies have established a rebuttable presumption against structures over 2,000 feet above ground level."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.fcc.gov/mb/policy/dtv/lighting.html| title=Antenna Tower Lighting and Marking Requirements| publisher=Federal Communications Commission| accessdate=2011-12-06[/tpl] The FCC and FAA may approve a taller structure in "exceptional cases." 
When the mast was built the call letters of the television station for which it was built were changed to KTHI, the "HI" referring to the height of the mast. The top is reachable by a two-person service elevator or ladder.
