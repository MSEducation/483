[tpl]nihongo|Michihiro Omigawa|小見川道大|Omigawa Michihiro|extra=born December 19, 1975[/tpl] is a Japanese mixed martial artist and judoka who has competed in mixed martial arts as a Lightweight and Featherweight. Omigawa has competed in the UFC, Pride FC, Cage Rage, World Victory Road, Dream, DEEP, and Shooto.

==Background==

Omigawa is from Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan and began training in judo when he was in elementary school. He attended Tsuchiuranichidai high school with fellow mixed martial artists Hayato Sakurai and Kazuyuki Miyata. Omigawa's grandfather, who he was named after, died the day before his graduation. Omigawa attended the International Budo University in the Chiba Prefecture of Japan.http://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/fighters/michihiro-omigawa
Omigawa has won various judo tournaments and medals during his career. He received the silver medal at the 2001 Asian Judo Championships in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, and obtained a bronze medal at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea all for the 66 kg weight class division.

==Early mixed martial arts career==

Omigawa made his professional mixed martial arts debut in 2005 against future UFC veteran Aaron Riley at Pride Bushido 7. Omigawa and Riley traded punches before Omigawa was knocked out by a head kick six minutes into the first round. Omigawa then fought for the British Cage Rage organization against future two-time K-1 HERO's Middleweight Champion, the Brazilian Gesias Calvacante. He again lost this fight by knockout, this time from an overhand right. These are, to this date, the only times Omigawa has ever been "finished" in his fights.
After a majority decision loss to Kazunori Yokota brought Omigawa's record to 1-4, he then strung together three consecutive wins in the DEEP organization, before making his UFC debut at UFC 76 against Matt Wiman. He lost this fight via unanimous decision. Omigawa then fought again for the UFC at UFC Fight Night: Swick vs Burkman against Brazilian Top Team's Thiago Tavares and lost again via unanimous decision.
After cutting down to the Featherweight division, Omigawa's recognition and career began to take off. Though he lost his division debut against future WEC and UFC veteran Jung Chan-Sung, Omigawa made a resurgence when he entered the Sengoku Featherweight Grand Prix tournament promoted by World Victory Road. As a heavy underdog he defeated the likes of WEC veteran LC Davis via unanimous decision and future UFC veteran Nam Phan via TKO. In the semi-final he faced then-undefeated Pancrase Featherweight Champion and future Sengoku Featherweight Champion Marlon Sandro. This fight was originally ruled as a majority draw before Omigawa was awarded the victory by split decision. This brought Omigawa to the final of the tournament against Masanori Kanehara (the semi-finalist loser) who stood in for Hatsu Hioki as Hioki could not continue to compete. Omigawa lost by a close split decision against Kanehara but in return earned him the recognition as a strong Featherweight.
After the tournament Omigawa continued to earn a spot as a world top 5 Featherweight, defeating the likes of former TKO Featherweight Champion as well as future Sengoku Featherweight Champion and Shooto Featherweight Champion Hatsu Hioki via a controversial split decision, future Dream Featherweight Champion Hiroyuki Takaya via TKO at Dynamite!! 2009, Micah Miller, and former WEC Featherweight Champion Cole Escovedo via armbar.

===Post-UFC===

Omigawa fought at Dream 18 against Tatsuya Kawajiri on New Year's Eve 2012. Omigawa lost via unanimous decision. The loss puts Omigawa at 1-6 in his last seven fights, all of which have went to a decision.

===Road FC===

In May of 2013, it was announced that Omigawa had signed with Korea's Road Fighting Championship and would debut against fellow judo practitioner, Bae Young Kwon at Road FC 12. After a back and forth fight, Omigawa lost a controversial decision.

===Shootboxing===

Bringing his boxing and judo skills to the kickboxing/grappling hybrid sport of shootboxing, Omigawa entered the 2013 -65kg S-Cup held at Shoot Boxing Battle Summit Ground Zero Tokyo 2013 in Tokyo, Japan on November 15, 2013. After defeating Yuki Hiroshi Kimaya by unanimous decision in the quarter-finals, he then faced fellow mixed martial artist "Wicky" Akiyo Nishiura in the semis. The fight was ruled a majority draw after the regulation three rounds and so went to an extension round to produce a winner, after which Omigawa was given the nod by all three judges. In the tournament final, he fell victim to a flying knee from Hiroaki Suzuki, losing by knockout in round two.Hiroaki Suzuki Wins 2013 65kg Shoot Boxing S-Cup鈴木博昭、S-cup 65kg日本トーナメント優勝：11.16 両国
