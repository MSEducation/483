==Summary==

Hajime Shinkai (Takuya Kimura) is a young, inexperienced pilot who struggles to achieve the dream of becoming a chief pilot some day. From the very beginning, it becomes clear that this is far from easy. The drama starts off with a flight back from Honolulu, Hawaii. When the captain feels unwell, Shinkai must land for him, but his sloppy landing earns him only criticism. Kouda Kazuki (Shinichi Tsutsumi), another chief pilot, criticizes his decision. Upset, Shinkai calls him cold and insensitive, resulting in a two-day suspension, during which he becomes acquainted with Ayumi Ogawa (Kō Shibasaki), a stubborn, straight-talking mechanic whose parents died in an airplane crash when she was just twelve. Coincidentally, her parents' death is related to Captain Kouda, who was supposed to lead the flight but called in sick at the last moment, to his later regret.
Another conflict was awaiting Shinkai, when Captain Kouda, Captain Jane, and he were on a flight as passengers. Captain Kouda notices that Fukaura Urara (Rina Uchiyama), a junior flight attendant, discriminates against different customers. On one occasion, she ignores the request of an old lady who asks for a cup of water and flirts with celebrity Kumakawa Tetsuya (who guest stars as himself). Angered, he grabs her hand to the galley and harshly scolds her. Because of this, she files a lawsuit against him, and does not change her mind despite persuasions. Eventually, she agrees to cancel the lawsuit if Shinkai will go out on a date with her, even forcing him to kiss her at one point. This consequently puts a damper on his love life. Aside from his life in the airplane, Shinkai struggles to seek approval from his father, who never understood his lifelong dream of becoming a pilot.
