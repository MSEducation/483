==Names==

Tolkien gave the same forest many different names:
The form Lórinand was also rendered in Quenya as Laurenandë and in Sindarin as Glornan or Nan Laur, all of the same meaning. Other, later names given to the land included the much later Rohirric name Dwimordene (from dwimor "phantom", an allusion to the perceived magic of the Elves), and the Westron name The Golden Wood.

==History==

Early in the First Age some of the Eldar left the Great March and settled in the lands east of the Misty Mountains. These elves became known as the Nandor and later the Silvan Elves. By [tpl]ME-date|SA|1200[/tpl] Galadriel had made contact with an existing Nandorin realm, Lindórinand, in the area that would later be known as Lothlórien, and planted there the golden mallorn trees which Gil-galad had received as a gift from Tar-Aldarion.[tpl]Harv|Unfinished Tales|1980|loc=A Description of Númenor|Ref=Unfinished Tales[/tpl]
The culture and knowledge of the Silvan elves was considerably enriched by the arrival of Sindarin Elves from west of the mountains and even the Silvan language was gradually replaced by Sindarin. Amongst these arrivals was Amdír, who became their first lord, as well as Galadriel and Celeborn, who also crossed the mountains and the Anduin to join these southern Nandor after the destruction of Eregion during the War of the Elves and Sauron. Ultimately, Amdír led an army out of the forest as part of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, just as Oropher, another Sindarin lord, led the Silvan Elves of the north in the same victory over Sauron, so it can be assumed that both northern and southern woodland realms had been founded by then.
With the gradual return of Sauron's malign influence to the forest east of Anduin, the northern Silvan Elves led by Thranduil son of Oropher (and father of Legolas), moved even further north to escape it, and those of the south returned west across the Anduin, although without their last Sindarin lord Amroth son of Amdír, who departed to Edhellond after his lover Nimrodel had fled there.
It was later revealed that Galadriel's Ring enriched the land by preserving its flora from death and decay, and in wielding it she created a powerful ward against all creatures of evil intent: in fact the only way that Galadriel's Lothlórien could have been conquered by Mordor is if Sauron himself, the master of all the Rings of Power, had come there.
Following the departure of Galadriel for Valinor at the beginning of the Fourth Age, the Elves of Lothlórien were ruled by Celeborn alone, who led them across the Anduin to found a new, larger realm, East Lórien, centred around Amon Lanc. By the time of the death of Queen Arwen, Celeborn and Galadriel's granddaughter, Lothlórien itself was deserted.

==Geography==

Lothlórien was located East of Moria between the Misty Mountains and the river Anduin. Other than a small strip of forested land to the south, the realm was located between the rivers Anduin and Silverlode, a region called the Naith (S. spearhead)[tpl]Harv|The Lost Road|1987|loc=Etymologies, SNAS|Ref=The Lost Road[/tpl] by the Elves or the Gore in Westron. The city of Caras Galadhon was located in the narrowest portion of the Naith, where the two rivers came together, called Egladil (possibly [tpl]ME-lang|lang=s|egol|elf|till|point[/tpl])[tpl]Harv|Salo|2004|loc=[/tpl] or the Angle.

==Legacy==

===Influence===

Many people have named their property or community "Lothlórien"; Notable examples include:
Songs about the place in Tolkien include Irish singer Enya's song "Lothlórien" from her album, Shepherd Moons. (Enya also wrote music heard in Peter Jackson's film of Lord of the Rings.) It is also the title of a song from the West End musical version of The Lord of the Rings.
Singer-songwriter Tori Amos named her daughter Natashya Lórien Hawley, after Lothlórien.The Independent on Sunday magazine interview.  16, Nov 2003
Music bands named Lothlorien, include Nashville indie rock band Lórien, the New Zealand Celtic folk group Lothlorien, and Brazilian metal band Lothlöryen.

===Adaptations===

As well as inspiring real-world places, Lothlórien has been depicted in other media.
In the  Middle-earth Role Playing supplement Lórien and the Halls of the Elven Smiths  (Iron Crown Enterprises, 1986), Lórien society is divided into several guilds, or "Glades" with each one taking a specific craft (such as baking, weaving or hunting). The hidden nature of the place is accorded to effects of the ring Nenya, and Elessar, the elf-stone — which are both said to slow the effects of time. Its particular geographic position, being sheltered by the Misty Mountains from storms, and the environmental effect of mallorn trees (which do not lose their leaves and so provide constant shelter from the elements all year round) are also claimed to cause a reduction in the effect of the passing seasons.
In The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria, Lorien was a region introduced to the game in March 2009, which allows players to visit Caras Galadhon and other locations, and complete quests from the elves.http://www.lotro.com/gameinfo/devdiaries/338-developer-diary-lothlorien-quest-notes Book 7: Leaves of Lorien
