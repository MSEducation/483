[[Equivalence class]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical relations

In mathematics, when a set has an equivalence relation defined on its elements, there is a natural grouping of elements that are related to one another, forming what are called equivalence classes. Notationally, given a set [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] and an equivalence relation [tpl]math|~[/tpl] on [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl], the equivalence class of an element [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl] in [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] is the subset of all elements in [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] which are equivalent to [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl]. It follows from the definition of the equivalence relations that the equivalence classes form a partition of [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl]. The set of equivalence classes is sometimes called the quotient set of [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] by [tpl]math|~[/tpl] and is denoted by [tpl]math|X / ~[/tpl]. 
When [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] has some structure, and the equivalence relation is defined with some connection to this structure, the quotient set often inherits some related structure. Examples include quotient spaces in linear algebra, quotient spaces in topology, quotient groups, homogeneous spaces, quotient rings, quotient monoids, and the quotient category.

==Notation and formal definition==

An equivalence relation is a binary relation [tpl]math|~[/tpl] satisfying three properties:[tpl]harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 122[/tpl]
The equivalence class of an element [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl] is denoted [tpl]math|a[/tpl] and is defined as the set
of elements that are related to [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl] by [tpl]math|~[/tpl]. An alternative notation [tpl]math|aR[/tpl] can be used to denote the equivalence class of the element [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl], specifically with respect to the equivalence relation [tpl]mvar|R[/tpl]. This is said to be the [tpl]mvar|R[/tpl]-equivalence class of [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl]. 
When an element is chosen (often implicitly) in each equivalence class, this defines an injective map called a section. If this section is denoted by [tpl]math|s[/tpl], one has [tpl]math|1= s(c) = c[/tpl] for every equivalence class [tpl]math|c[/tpl]. The element [tpl]math|s(c)[/tpl] is called a representative of [tpl]math|c[/tpl]. Any element of a class may be chosen as a representative of the class, by choosing the section appropriately.
Sometimes, there is a section that is more "natural" than the other ones. In this case, the representatives are called canonical representatives. For example, in modular arithmetic, consider the equivalence relation on the integers defined by [tpl]math|a ~ b[/tpl] if [tpl]math|a - b[/tpl] is a multiple of a given integer [tpl]math| n[/tpl], called the modulus. Each class contains a unique non-negative integer smaller than [tpl]math|n[/tpl], and these integers are the canonical representatives. The class and its representative are more or less identified, as is witnessed by the fact that the notation [tpl]math| a mod n[/tpl] may denote either the class or its canonical representative (which is the remainder of the division of [tpl]math| a[/tpl] by [tpl]math|n[/tpl]).

==Examples==

==Properties==

Every element [tpl]mvar|x[/tpl] of [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] is a member of the equivalence class [tpl]math|x[/tpl]. Every two equivalence classes [tpl]math|x[/tpl] and [tpl]math|y[/tpl] are either equal or disjoint. Therefore, the set of all equivalence classes of [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] forms a partition of [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl]: every element of [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] belongs to one and only one equivalence class.[tpl]harvnb|Maddox|2002|loc=p.74, Thm. 2.5.15[/tpl] Conversely every partition of [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] comes from an equivalence relation in this way, according to which [tpl]math|x ~ y[/tpl] if and only if [tpl]mvar|x[/tpl] and [tpl]mvar|y[/tpl] belong to the same set of the partition.[tpl]harvnb|Avelsgaard|1989|loc=p.132, Thm. 3.16[/tpl]
It follows from the properties of an equivalence relation that
In other words, if [tpl]math|~[/tpl] is an equivalence relation on a set [tpl]math|X[/tpl], and [tpl]mvar|x[/tpl] and [tpl]mvar|y[/tpl] are two elements of [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl], then these statements are equivalent:

==Graphical representation==

Any binary relation can be represented by a directed graph and symmetric ones, such as equivalence relations, by undirected graphs. If [tpl]math|~[/tpl] is an equivalence relation on a set [tpl]math|X[/tpl], let the vertices of the graph be the elements of [tpl]math|X[/tpl] and join vertices [tpl]mvar|s[/tpl] and [tpl]mvar|t[/tpl] if and only if [tpl]math|s ~ t[/tpl]. The equivalence classes are represented in this graph by the maximal cliques forming the connected components of the graph.[tpl]harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 123[/tpl]

==Invariants==

If [tpl]math|~[/tpl] is an equivalence relation on [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl], and [tpl]math|P(x)[/tpl] is a property of elements of [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] such that whenever [tpl]math|x ~ y[/tpl], [tpl]math|P(x)[/tpl] is true if [tpl]math|P(y)[/tpl] is true, then the property [tpl]mvar|P[/tpl] is said to be an invariant of [tpl]math|~[/tpl], or well-defined under the relation [tpl]math|~[/tpl].
A frequent particular case occurs when [tpl]mvar|f[/tpl] is a function from [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] to another set [tpl]mvar|Y[/tpl]; if  [tpl]math|1=f(x1) = f(x2)[/tpl] whenever [tpl]math|x1 ~ x2[/tpl], then [tpl]mvar|f[/tpl] is said to be a morphism for [tpl]math|~[/tpl], a class invariant under [tpl]math|~[/tpl], or simply invariant under [tpl]math|~[/tpl]. This occurs, e.g. in the character theory of finite groups. Some authors use "compatible with [tpl]math|~[/tpl]" or just "respects [tpl]math|~[/tpl]" instead of "invariant under [tpl]math|~[/tpl]".
Any function [tpl]math|f : X → Y[/tpl] itself defines an equivalence relation on [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] according to which [tpl]math|x1 ~ x2[/tpl] if and only if [tpl]math|1=f(x1) = f(x2)[/tpl]. The equivalence class of [tpl]mvar|x[/tpl] is the set of all elements in [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] which get mapped to [tpl]math|f(x)[/tpl], i.e. the class [tpl]math|x[/tpl] is the inverse image of [tpl]math|f(x)[/tpl]. This equivalence relation is known as the kernel of [tpl]mvar|f[/tpl].
More generally, a function may map equivalent arguments (under an equivalence relation [tpl]math|~X[/tpl] on [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl]) to equivalent values (under an equivalence relation [tpl]math|~Y[/tpl] on [tpl]mvar|Y[/tpl]).  Such a function is known as a morphism from [tpl]math|~X[/tpl] to [tpl]math|~Y[/tpl].
