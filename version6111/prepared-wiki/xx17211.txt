North Cascades National Park is a U.S. National Park located in the state of Washington. The park is the largest of the three National Park Service units that comprise the North Cascades National Park Service Complex. Several national wilderness areas and British Columbia parkland adjoin the National Park. The park features rugged mountain peaks and protects portions of the North Cascades range.

==Human history==

===Paleoindians and native Americans===

Human history in the region now part of North Cascades National Park dates back to the end of the last glacial period, and the region has been continuously inhabited for at least the last 8-10,000 years.[tpl]cite book|last=Apostol|first=Dean|coauthors=Marcia Sinclair|title=Restoring the Pacific Northwest: The Art and Science of Ecological Restoration in Cascadia|publisher=Island Press|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CsGyhzFBjyAC&pg=PA248&dq=archeology+of+north+cascades&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ck03U_jcLMngsASzu4LIBQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=archeology%20of%20north%20cascades&f=false|page=248|isbn=9781610911030|date=November 5, 2006|accessdate=March 29, 2014[/tpl] At that time, native American ancestors of Skagit tribes slowly advanced from Puget Sound into the interior mountainous region as the glacial ice retreated. Archeological evidence of continuous human presence in the North Cascades dates to 4,470 B.P. and rocks procured from sources in the region were used to manufacture stone tools and weapons for several millennia. Hozomeen chert, a type of rock well-suited to the fabrication of implements, was mined from near Hozomeen Mountain, just east of the park border, for the last 8,400 years. Hozomeen chert is part of the archeological record throughout the Skagit River Valley, west of the park and in regions to the east, indicating people visited the region if for no other purpose than to obtain raw materials.[tpl]cite book|last=McManamon|first=Francis P.|coauthors=Linda S.

The micro blades are part of an archeological assemblage that includes five distinct cultural periods, indicating that people were traveling into the mountains nearly 10,000 years ago.[tpl]cite web|last=Mierendorf|first=Robert|title=Archeology at Cascade Pass|work=North Cascades Resource Brief|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/historyculture/upload/Archeology-Cascade-Pass-Resource-Brief-2011-2.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=April 6, 2014[/tpl] The archeological excavation at Cascade Pass is one of the 260 prehistoric sites that have been identified in the park.[tpl]cite web|title=History and Culture|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/historyculture/index.htm|accessdate=April 6, 2014[/tpl] 
When white explorers first entered the area in the late 18th century, perhaps 1,000 Skagits lived there.[tpl]cite web|last=Thompson|first=Erwin N.|title=North Cascades History Basic Data|chapter=1|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/noca/hbd/chap1.htm|date=June 11, 2008|accessdate=March 29, 2014[/tpl] The Skagits lived in settlements, culling their needs from the waterways and traveling by way of canoe. Skagits formed a loose confederation of tribes that united if threatened by outside tribes such as the Haidas, who lived to the north. They erected large houses or lodges that might house multiple families, each with their own partioned area and entrance. The lodges were [tpl]convert|100|ft[/tpl] in length and [tpl]convert|20|to|40|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in width and the roofs were shed-styles, with a single-pitch; structures built by other Puget Sound tribes usually had gable roofs with more than one-pitch. The Skagits were generally lowlanders, who only ventured into the North Cascades during the summer months, and structures in the mountains were more modest, consisting mostly of temporary buildings erected with poles and covered with branches. The Skagits erected totem poles and participated in potlatch ceremonies, similar to the Haidas, but with less complexity and extravagance. By 1910, only about 56 Skagits remained in the region, but their numbers have since rebounded some.
Inland and residing to the north and east of the Skagits, the Nlaka'pamux (or Thompson Indians and named after explorer David Thompson), Chelan, Okanogan and Wenatchi tribes lived partly or year-round in the eastern sections of the North Cascades. The Skagits and Thompsons often had disputes, and raided each others camps in search of slaves or to exact retributions. Like the coastal based Skagits, inland tribes also constructed long lodges which were occupied by numerous familes, though the style of construction was slightly different as the lodges did not have partitions separating one family from another, and were frame constructed and covered with reed mats rather than from cedar planking. One Wenatchi lodge was described by Thompson as being [tpl]convert|240|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long. Inland tribes were more likely to travel on foot or horseback than by canoe since the inland regions were less densely forested. Inland tribes also had less bountiful fisheries and greater weather extremes due to being further away from the moderating influence of the Pacific Ocean. Additionally, inland tribes rarely erected totem poles or participated in potlatch ceremonies. By the the beginning of the 20th century, inland tribes, like their coastal neighbors, had much reduced populations from when they had first encountered white explorers a hundred years earlier, mostly due to smallpox and other diseases.

==Park management==

North Cascades National Park is managed by the National Park Service and the park headquarters is in Sedro-Woolley, Washington. North Cascades National Park is bisected by Ross Lake National Recreation Area, creating a northern and southern district or unit of the park. The southeast boundary of the southern district abuts Lake Chelan National Recreation Area; the park and two recreation areas are managed as the North Cascades National Park Complex.[tpl]cite map|publisher=National Park Service|title=North Cascades National Park Complex|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/upload/NOCAmap1.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=April 20, 2014[/tpl] The three entities were all established in 1968 and in 1988, much of the park complex was designated wilderness as the Stephen Mather Wilderness, preventing further non-natural alterations to 94 percent of the park.[tpl]cite web|title=North Cascades National Park 2012 Business Plan|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/parkmgmt/upload/NOCA_4-30_spreads.pdf|publisher=National Park Service|format=pdf|date=Spring 2012|accessdate=April 20, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Washington Park Wilderness Act of 1988|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/parkmgmt/washington-park-wilderness.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=April 20, 2014[/tpl] The mandate of the National Park Service is to "... preserve and protect natural and cultural resources". The Organic Act of August 25, 1916, established the National Park Service as a federal agency. One major section of the Act has often been summarized as the "Mission", "... to promote and regulate the use of the ... national parks ... which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."[tpl]cite web|title=The National Park System, Caring for the American Legacy|publisher=National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior|url=http://www.nps.gov/legacy/mission.html|accessdate=April 20, 2014[/tpl] In keeping with this mandate, hunting is illegal in the park, as is mining, logging and removal of natural or cultural resources. Additionally, oil and gas exploration and extraction are not permitted.
In 2013, North Cascades National Park recorded over 21,000 visitors, but adjoing Ross Lake National Recreation Area reported over 725,000 visitors and Lake Chelan National Recreation Area had just under 40,000 visitors. Peak visitation is between the months of June and September. The vast majority of visitors come to Ross Lake National Recreation Area which is easily accessible on Washington State Route 20, also known as the North Cascades Highway, and the only road which bisects the park complex. North Cascades National Park Complex had an operating base budget of $7,700,000 for fiscal year 2010, augmented by another $3,700,000 of non-base funding which can fluctuate significantly from year to year, and additional funding from revenue generated from concessionaire contracts and user fees. Much of the budget is for staffing, with 83 percent directed to pay for the employ of 81 permanent employees, not all of which are employed year-round, and the nearly 250 seasonal and term employees that work primarily in the summer months. 
The North Cascades National Park Complex management activities include facilities management, which oversees the maintenance and construction of roads, [tpl]convert|396|mi|[/tpl] of trails and 260 buildings, and resource management, which is involved in areas as diverse as fire management, biological resource management and glacier monitoring. Park employees also provide law enforcement, search and rescue, medical response, interpretive services and educational outreach, and the administrative division which oversees budgets, personnel and contracting services.

==Geography and geology==

===Glaciers===

In 1971, the park had 318 glaciers with an area of 117 km2 (Post et al., 1971), the most of any US park outside Alaska. All the glaciers in the park have retreated significantly from 1980 to 2013 and the rate is increasing.  The recent warmer climate has led to more summer melting and more winter melting events, reducing winter snowpack.  Several glaciers in the range have melted away in the last decade.Glacier Retreat in the Pacific Northwest North Cascades National Park Boston Glacier, on the north slope of Boston Peak, is the largest glacier in the park with an area of 7 km2. The other large glaciers (with areas greater than 2.5 km2) are:

===Attractions===

Nearly all of the national park is protected as the Stephen Mather Wilderness, so there are few maintained buildings and roads within the North and South units of the Park. The park is most popular with backpackers and mountain climbers.  One of the most popular destinations in the park is Cascade Pass, which was used as a travel route by Native Americans. It can be accessed by a four-mile (6 km) trail at the end of a gravel road. The North and South Picket Ranges, Mount Triumph, as well as Eldorado Peak and the surrounding mountains, are popular with climbers due to glaciation and technical rock. Mount Shuksan, in the northwest corner of the park, is one of the most photographed mountains in the country and the second highest peak in the park [tpl]convert|9127|ft|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl].

===Access===

Although a couple of gravel roads open to the public enter the park (Cascade River Road beginning at Marblemount off HWY #20 and the Upper Stehekin Valley Road accessed from Stehekin via tour-boat from Chelan), most automobile traffic in the region travels on the North Cascades Highway (Washington State Route 20), which passes through the Ross Lake National Recreation Area.
The nearest large town on the west side of the park is Sedro-Woolley, Washington, while Winthrop lies to the east. Chelan is located at the southeastern end of Lake Chelan where east-side access to the NCNP from Stehekin serves the Eastern Washington communities.

==Ecology==

Variation in rock and soil types, exposure, slope, elevation, and rainfall is reflected in the diverse plant life. Eight distinctive life zones support thousands of different plant species in the North Cascades greater ecosystem. No other National Park surpasses North Cascades National Park's over 1,630 vascular plant species recorded. Estimates of non-vascular and fungal species could more than double the number of plant species in the North Cascades.  The park contains an estimated [tpl]convert|236000|acre|km2[/tpl] of old-growth forests.
The park also has a diversity of animal species, including bald eagle, grey wolf, grizzly bear, mountain lion, lynx, moose, wolverine, and black bear.[tpl]cite web|title=North Cascades National Park: Wildlife|work=GORP|publisher=Orbitz|first=Karen|last=Kefauver|date=15 Sep 2010|accessdate=6 June 2012|url=http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/travel-ta-north-cascades-national-park-wildlife-sidwcmdev_067731.html[/tpl] The park is home to 75 species of mammals and 200 species of birds that either pass through or use the North Cascades for a breeding area. There are also 11 species of fish on the west side of the Cascades. Examples of amphibian species occurring in the park include the western toad (Bufo boreas) and the rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa).[tpl]cite web|first1=Ashley K.|last1=Rawhouser|first2=Ronald E.|last2=Holmes|first3=Reed S.|last3=Glesne|year=2009|url=http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/units/nccn/reports/inventory/NCCN_NOCA_Stream_Amphibian_Inventory_2005_20090215.pdf|title=A Survey of Stream Amphibian Species Composition and Distribution in the North Cascades National Park Service Complex, Washington State[/tpl]
The biodiversity of the area is threatened by global climate change and invasive exotic plant species. These exotic plants thrive by using man-made structures such as roads and trails. These invasive plants include the diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa) and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea).[tpl]cite web|title=Non-native plants|work=North Cascades National Park|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2012-06-06|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/naturescience/non-native-plants.htm[/tpl]
