==Formation==

The group's story begins with a dream, a dream urging him to moved to Austin, Texas from Miami, Florida as he explains: "If there's anything I can say about living in Miami and doing drugs, it's that I learned to play guitar". Spencer formed a band called Jez Spencer the original line-up was Gibb, Johnson, Stewart Cochran, Johnny Goudie and Einar. Johnson suggested Cochran, who he had seen play with Abra Moore and David Garza. Gibb e-mailed Cochran, who at the time was touring Europe with Jimmy LaFave. When Cochran got back to Texas, he hooked up with Johnson and Gibb at the Austin Rehearsal Complex (ARC), and after hearing some demos, decided that he was in for the long haul. Later, Johnny Goudie left early to formed his band Goudie. After eight months, Einar also left the group as he also participated on the band Goudie. The remaining members played with a numerous of bassists including George Reiff. For the next few months, Jez Spencer played shows, until Reiff left. That is when the band decided they wanted to really figure out their own unique sound and get serious and with that they found Glenn McGregor. Under the name of Jez Spencer they released one album 4 Track Mind. It was their overseas manager at the time, Mark Chaplin, that suggested they pitch their music to his London partner John Wadlow. After sending Wadlow a few of their demos, Gibb phoned him. Wadlow and Gibb clashed from the word go. Wadlow was not impressed with the band being un-named, and he only liked one of the songs, "In A Box," but he thought the chorus came in too late.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2007-08-17/524278/ |title=Spencer Gibb tiptoes atop 54 Seconds |last=Moser |first=Margaret |publisher=Austin Chronicle |accessdate=14 June 2013[/tpl]
