Sir Geoffrey Winston Russell Palmer [tpl]post-nominals|country=NZL-cats|KCMG|AC|QC[/tpl] (born 21 April 1942) served as the 33rd Prime Minister of New Zealand from August 1989 until September 1990, leading the Fourth Labour Government. He was responsible for considerable reforms of the country's legal and constitutional framework, such as the creation of the Constitution Act 1986, New Zealand Bill of Rights, Imperial Laws Application Act and the State Sector Act.

==Early life and education==

Palmer was born in Nelson and attended Nelson Central School, Nelson Intermediate School and Nelson College. At Victoria University of Wellington, he studied both political science and law. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1964 and a Bachelor of Laws in 1965. After working for a time in Wellington, he attended the University of Chicago's law school, gaining a Juris Doctor (doctorate of law) in 1967. He taught for a time at the University of Iowa and the University of Virginia, and undertook consultancy work for the Australian government. Eventually, in 1974, he was appointed to a professorship of law at Victoria University of Wellington, bringing him back to New Zealand. At the 1975 general election, Palmer took part in the "Citizens for Rowling" campaign.

==Political career==

===Member of Parliament===

In a 1979 by-election, Palmer was elected to Parliament as the member for Christchurch Central, having stood as the Labour Party candidate. He eventually became deputy Leader of the Opposition in 1983. When, in 1984, the Labour Party won the general elections, Palmer became Deputy Prime Minister of the Fourth Labour Government. He also became Attorney-General and Minister of Justice. The new justice minister, who had promoted proportional representation as a law professor in his book Unbridled Power?, also published in 1984, set up a Royal Commission to investigate the electoral system and propose modifications or alternatives. His Royal Commission reported in December 1986, recommending the Mixed Member Proportional system. After the 1987 elections, when Labour was re-elected, he also became Minister of the Environment, an area in which he took personal interest.

===Leadership===

The most notable feature of New Zealand politics at the time was the economic change promoted by the Finance Minister, Roger Douglas. Douglas was advancing free market monetarist policies involving extensive privatization of state assets and the removal of tariffs and subsidies. These policies, which contravened Labour's basic policy platform and campaign promises, were deeply unpopular with Labour's traditional support base, and resulted in a confrontation between Prime Minister David Lange and Roger Douglas. Lange also reneged from his promise to hold a binding referendum on the MMP system. Palmer conceded defeat on MMP at an April 1989 Labour regional conference, saying that the issue was "effectively dead for the immediate future." Eventually, Douglas was removed from Cabinet, but the dispute had weakened Lange enough that he resigned a month later. Palmer, being deputy leader, took over as Prime Minister. Electoral reformers in the Labour Party kept up the pressure, and in September 1989, after Palmer had become prime minister, the full annual conference of the Labour Party passed a remit endorsing a referendum on the principle of proportional representation. 
Palmer, however, was perceived by the public as being too closely involved with Douglas's reforms and academically remote. Of particular concern to many people was his work on the legal aspects of state sector rearrangement, such as his preparation of the State Owned Enterprises Act. The presence of David Caygill (a Douglas ally) as Minister of Finance further compounded perception that Palmer was doing nothing to address public concerns. The only area in which Palmer won praise from traditional left-wing supporters was in his handling of the Environment portfolio, which he kept when he became Prime Minister – it was his work here in iniating the resource management law reform process that eventually led to the creation of the Resource Management Act.Palmer, G., (1991). "Sustainability – New Zealand's resource management legislation." Resources: the Newsletter of the Canadian Institute of Resources Law No 34: 6 pp 3–10.
Two months before the 1990 elections, it was clear that Labour would not win. The perceived damage done by Roger Douglas's reforms, as well as Palmer's lack of general charisma, caused too many Labour supporters to abandon the party. In addition, Palmer was perceived as being too academic and aloof, reminding people of the paternalistic attitude that Douglas was accused of. Palmer was replaced by Mike Moore, who Labour believed would give it a better chance of winning. Palmer chose to resign from parliament, and was replaced in his seat by Lianne Dalziel. The attempt failed, however, and the opposition National Party under Jim Bolger won a landslide victory.
Geoffrey Palmer became the first Labour leader to leave the party leadership without ever leading the party into an election.

==After Parliament==

Palmer later went on to serve as Professor of Law at Victoria University again. He also held a position as Professor of Law at the University of Iowa, and worked for a time as a law consultant. The MMP system which he had helped promote was adopted in a 1993 referendum. In 1994, he established Chen Palmer & Partners, a specialist public law firm he began with Wellington lawyer Mai Chen. In September 2001 Palmer became a founding trustee of Motu Economic and Public Policy Research and in December 2002 was appointed to be New Zealand's representative to the International Whaling Commission (IWC). Palmer continued his involvement with, and teaching at Victoria University of Wellington and was regularly engaged as an expert consultant on public and constitutional law issues. His son Matthew Palmer is also a prominent legal academic and public servant.

===Law Commissioner===

On 1 December 2005 Palmer was appointed to the presidency of the New Zealand Law Commission (the government agency that reviews, reforms and seeks to improve the country's laws) by the Governor General for a term of five years. During his tenure, he persuaded the Government to engage in a programme of reviewing the old Law Commission reports with a view to actioning them. This resulted in a number of existing reports being actioned. Palmer stepped down from the Law Commission at the end of his tenure on 1 December 2010.

===UN Inquiry===

In August 2010 Palmer was chosen to chair a UN Inquiry panel[tpl]cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/08/02/un.panel.flotilla/index.html#fbid=-Re3pdEH4gC |title=UN panel on CNN | date=2 August 2010[/tpl]  into the fatal Israeli raid on the Mavi Marmara, a Turkish ship participating in a Gaza-bound protest flotilla in May of that year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/middle-east/3984251/Former-NZ-PM-to-lead-Gaza-flotilla-attack-probe |title=Former NZ PM to lead Gaza flotilla attack probe [/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10663218 |title=Palmer to head UN flotilla inquiry | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=3 August 2010[/tpl] The panel included the outgoing Colombian President Álvaro Uribe as the Vice-chair, and representatives from Turkey and Israel. The report, released on 2 September 2011, found that Israel's “naval blockade was imposed as a legitimate security measure in order to prevent weapons from entering Gaza by sea and its implementation complied with the requirements of international law,” and that Israeli soldiers enforcing the blockade faced “organized and violent resistance from a group of passengers” when they boarded the ship. However, the report also found that the Israeli soldiers responded with “excessive and unreasonable” force and recommended that Israel make “an appropriate statement of regret” and pay compensation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/world/middleeast/02flotilla.html |title=Report Finds Naval Blockade by Israel Legal but Faults Raid | work=The New York Times | first1=Neil |last1=MacFarquhar |first2=Ethan |last2=Bronner |date=1 September 2011[/tpl]
