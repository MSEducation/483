The international name for the body of water which is bordered by Japan, North Korea, Russia, and South Korea is disputed. In 1992, objections to the name Sea of Japan were first raised by North Korea and South Korea at the Sixth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/index.html|title=The Issue of the Name of the Sea of Japan|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan[/tpl]  The Japanese government supports the use of the name "Sea of Japan", while South Korea supports the name "East Sea", and North Korea supports the name "East Sea of Korea".  Currently, most international maps and documents use either the name Sea of Japan (or equivalent translation) by itself, or include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea, often with East Sea listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as a secondary name.  The International Hydrographic Organization, the international governing body for the naming of bodies of water around the world, in 2012 decided not to change the current single name "Sea of Japan" rejecting the South Korea's request to use "East Sea" together with "Sea of Japan"."IHO rejects Japan's proposal to rule out East Sea name", YONHAP NEWS AGENCY, 26 April 2012.

The involved countries (especially Japan and South Korea) have advanced a variety of arguments to support their preferred name(s).  Many of the arguments revolve around determining when the name Sea of Japan became the common name.  South Korea argues that historically the more common name was East Sea, Sea of Korea, or another similar variant.  South Korea further argues that the name Sea of Japan did not become common until Korea was under Japanese rule, at which time it had no ability to influence international affairs.  Japan argues that the name Sea of Japan has been the most common international name since at least the beginning of the 19th century, long before its annexation of Korea.  Both sides have conducted studies of antiquarian maps, but the two countries have produced divergent research results.  Additional arguments have been raised regarding the underlying geography of the sea as well as potential problems regarding the ambiguity of one name or the other.

==Arguments==

Both sides in the dispute have put forward a number of arguments to support their claims.

===Arguments based on historical maps===

====Arguments from South Korea====

According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for South Korea, the name Donghae (동해, literally East Sea) has been used in Korea for over 2,000 years, including in History of the Three Kingdoms (三國史記, 1145), the monument of King Gwanggaeto, and "Map of Eight Provinces of Korea" (八道總圖, 1530). The first documented map to name the area the Sea of Japan was the world map drawn by the Italian missionary Matteo Ricci in China (1602) named Kunyu Wanguo Quantu (坤輿萬國全圖).  No Japanese record published up to the late-18th century indicated any name for the body of water.[tpl]cite web|title=Naming of the East Sea|url=http://english.historyfoundation.or.kr/?sub_num=160|publisher=Northeast Asian History Foundation|year=2007 |accessdate=22 November 2010[/tpl] Furthermore, South Korea has pointed out that a few 19th-century Japanese maps referred to the sea as Chōsenkai (朝鮮海, literally Sea of Joseon), including the "Simplified Map of Japan's Periphery" (日本邊界略圖, 1809) and "New World Map" (新製輿地全圖, 1844). South Korea argues there was no standard name prior to Japan's military expansion in the region in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Additionally, it specifically states that the name Sea of Japan was not widely used, even in Japan, as late as the mid 19th century.[tpl]cite web|title=Legitimacy for Restoring the Name East Sea|url=http://www.mofat.go.kr/english/political/images/res/east_sea.pdf|publisher=South Korea Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade|date=May 2009 |accessdate=28 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]Dubious|date=April 2011[/tpl] Thus, South Korea argues that the current name reflects active promotion by Japan during a time when Korea could not represent its interests internationally.[tpl]cite web|title=Recent Changes in Geographical Names of Korean Cities and other Developments|url=http://www.un.org/depts/dhl/maplib/ungegn/session-20/working-papers/working-paper-48.pdf|title=Working Paper 48 of the UNGEGN Twentieth Session|publisher=United Nations|date=17–28 January 2000|accessdate=22 November 2010[/tpl]

====Arguments from Japan====

The Japanese government claims that the name Sea of Japan was internationally used since the 17th century and established by the early 19th century, during a period in which Japan was under an isolationist policy (Sakoku) of the Tokugawa shogunate, which restricted cultural exchange and commerce with foreign countries except China and the Netherlands until 1854.[tpl]cite web|title=Issue of naming of the Sea of Japan (Study in the Russian Federation) Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of Japan|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/study-6.html|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|year=2010 |accessdate=22 November 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www1.kaiho.mlit.go.jp/GIJUTSUKOKUSAI/nihonkai/position_eng.htm | title = Japanese Basic Position on the Naming of the "Japan Sea" | publisher =Japan Coast Guard | date=1 March 2005|accessdate=22 November 2010 [/tpl] Accordingly, they state, Japan could not have, at that time, had an influence on the international community regarding the naming of the sea.
The invention of the marine chronometer in the late 18th century enabled Western explorers, such as Jean Francois de Galaup from France, William Robert Broughton from Britain, and Adam Johann von Krusenstern (Ivan Fyodorovich Kruzenshtern) from Russia, to measure time and longitudes on the sea precisely and map the detailed shape of the Sea of Japan. Krusenstern was an admiral and explorer, who led the first Russian circumnavigation of the globe.[tpl]cite book |author=Adam Johann von Krusenstern |coauthors= |title=Voyage Round the World |year=1813 |publisher= |quote= | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SgXVHAAACAAJ&dq |isbn= [/tpl] According to Japanese records, it was Krusenstern who popularized the name "Mer du Japon" (Sea of Japan) in the West. In his work "Reise um die Welt in den Jahren" (1812), he wrote, "People also call this sea area the Sea of Korea, but because only a small part of this sea touches the Korean coast, it is better to name it the Sea of Japan." The original book was published in St. Petersburg in German and Russian, translated into Dutch, French, Swedish, Italian and English, and distributed widely among Europe. As a result, the international name of the sea changed from no name to the Sea of Japan, on the maps drawn by countries other than Japan or Korea during the 17th to 20th centuries. Thus, the Japanese side argues that the South Koreans misunderstand the history of the name.

====Surveys of antiquarian maps====

To provide evidence for the date when Sea of Japan came to be used internationally, both South Korea and Japan have undertaken surveys of various historical maps.
In 2004, South Korea surveyed ancient maps archived in the British Library, the Cambridge University Library, the University of Southern California (USC) East Asian Map Collection, the U.S. Library of Congress, the National Library of Russia, and the French National Library examined 762 maps.  They found that 440 maps had used Sea of Korea (Corea), Oriental Sea/East Sea, 122 had used Sea of Japan, and 200 had used other terms.[tpl]cite web|title=Naming of the East Sea|url=http://english.historyfoundation.or.kr/?sub_num=160|publisher=Northeast Asian History Foundation|year=2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110815174553/http://english.historyfoundation.or.kr/?sub_num=160|archivedate=15 August 2011|accessdate=2 September 2013[/tpl] In the French language, the word orientale includes both the meaning of "eastern" related to compass direction and the meaning of "oriental", the Asiatic region. The same ambiguity is present in the Russian language, with both "eastern" and "oriental" indicated by one word.
From 2003 to 2008, Japan conducted a number of surveys of different collections. In 2010, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) published their conclusions; they found that among 1,332 maps from the Berlin Library, 279 used Sea of Korea, Oriental Sea, or East Sea (or some combination thereof), 579 used Sea of Japan exclusively, 47 used China Sea (with or without other names), 33 used another term, and 384 used no term.[tpl]cite web|title=The Issue of the Naming of the Sea of Japan (Study in Germany)|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/study-7f.html|work=SEA OF JAPAN|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|year=2010|accessdate=15 October 2010[/tpl] MOFA said the Struck collection (a collection of antiquarian maps owned by a European map collector) showed that out of 79 maps, 35 used Sea of Japan, 9 used the Sea of Korea, 2 used Oriental Sea, and 33 were unmarked. MOFA reported that among four Russian libraries and document archives holding 51 maps, 29 used Sea of Japan, 8 used Sea of Korea, 1 used Korea Strait, 1 used East Sea, 1 used Sea of China, and 11 used no name.[tpl]cite web|title=Issue of naming of the Sea of Japan (Study in the Russian Federation)|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/study-6.html|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|year=2010|accessdate=15 October 2010[/tpl]  MOFA said that 1,213 maps from the U.S. Library of Congress, ones that gave a name for this body of water, showed that 87 percent used Sea of Japan, 8 percent used Sea of Korea, 5 percent used other terms, and none used Oriental Sea or East Sea.[tpl]cite web|title=Sea of Japan|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/pamph0903.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|date=February 2009|accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl] Similarly, MOFA said that 58 maps from the British Library and the University of Cambridge showed 86 percent used Sea of Japan, 14 percent used Sea of Korea, and none used Oriental Sea, East Sea, or other terms. MOFA said that they looked at 1,485 maps in the French National Library. They reported that 95 percent of 215 French maps used Sea of Japan.
In November 2007, the National Geographic Information Institute of South Korea published a report on a survey of 400 ancient maps.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.korea.kr/policy/pressReleaseView.do?newsId=155257262|title=세계사와 함께한 우리나라 지도역사를 한눈에… – 동해 ․ 독도 및 간도의 변화 집중조명 – |trans_title=At a glance of the World history and the history of the map of our country ... – Spotlight on the change of Donghae, Dokdo and Jiandao – | publisher=National Geographic Information Institute of Korea|date= November 2007|language=Korean[/tpl] Original text in HWP format in Korean is available here http://academic.naver.com/openUrl.nhn?doc_id=13076350&linkType=doclink According to the report, nine maps used East Sea for the water currently called Sea of Japan, while 31 maps used East Sea for the water currently called East China Sea. The number of maps used Sea of Japan is not disclosed. Furthermore the report says "In the late 18th century (1790–1830) the name Sea of Japan emerged. From the 19th century (1830 onward), there was a rapid increase in the use of the name Sea of Japan." Japan stated, "This clearly shows the fallacy of the ROK's assertion that the name Sea of Japan was the result of the Japanese policy of expansionism and colonial rule, and can be interpreted as affirming that the name Sea of Japan was in widespread use well before Japan's colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula".[tpl]cite web|title=The Government of the Republic of Korea(ROK) has recently published a survey that can be interpreted as withdrawing a part of its own assertion. |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/#6[/tpl]

===Geographical arguments===

Japan argues that, the name Sea of Japan has been and should be used because the marginal sea is separated from the Pacific Ocean by the Japanese Archipelago.[tpl]cite web|title=Sea of Japan|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/pamph0208.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|date=August 2002|accessdate=21 November 2010[/tpl] Korea argues that the adjective "East" describes its geographical position east of the Asian continent, although it is west of Japan and south of Russia. It states that this is analogous to the North Sea, which lies north of the European continent, but west of Scandinavian countries and east of Great Britain.
However Koreans call the sea on their east side the East Sea (동해, Donghae),[tpl]cite web|title=East Sea|publisher=Encyclopedia of Korean Ethnic Culture|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=236866&v=43|quote=Sea in the east of our country.|language=Korean[/tpl] on their south side the South Sea (남해, Namhae),[tpl]cite web|title=South Sea|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&i=121158&v=44|quote=Sea in the south of Korea|language=Korean[/tpl] and on their west side the West Sea (서해, Seohae).[tpl]cite web|title=West Sea|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&i=155504&v=43|quote=Sea in the west of Korean Peninsula|language=Korean[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The history of Korea|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=h4WhAna6dlMC&pg=PA8&dq=%22east+sea%22%E3%80%80%22west+sea%22%E3%80%80%22south+sea%22+korea&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22east%20sea%22%E3%80%80%22west%20sea%22%E3%80%80%22south%20sea%22%20korea&f=false|quote=Koreans have named the seas on its three sides the East Sea, the South Sea, and the West Sea. However, on most maps, the West Sea is called the Yellow Sea, and the East Sea is called the Sea of Japan.

===Arguments relating to ambiguity===

The Japanese Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department of the Japanese Coast Guard has claimed that the name East Sea is confusing and unsuitable as an international geographic name, because the local name for a variety of seas can be translated into English as East Sea.  Examples include Dōng Hǎi (东海), the Chinese name for the East China Sea; Biển Đông, the Vietnamese name for the South China Sea; and the Baltic Sea, which means East Sea in several European languages such as German (Ostsee), Swedish (Östersjön) and Finnish (Itämeri). East Sea is officially used as an English name for the water by the Government of Vietnam. Thus the Government of Vietnam uses East Sea for South China Sea in its English publications.[tpl]cite web|title=VN, China pledge to solve East Sea issue|date=20 April 2011|publisher=Socialist Republic of Việt Nam|url=http://thutuong.chinhphu.vn:2012/Home/VN-China-pledge-to-solve-East-Sea-issue/20114/1040.vgp[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=VN asserts sea and island sovereignty |date=09/06/2011|publisher=Socialist Republic of Việt Nam|url=http://thutuong.chinhphu.vn:2012/Home/VN-asserts-sea-and-island-sovereignty/20116/1025.vgp[/tpl]
Also the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China uses East Sea for East China Sea in its English publications.[tpl]cite web|title=The Fourth Round of Consultation on East Sea between China and Japan to Be Held |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of People's Republic of China|date= 2006-03-02|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/wjdt/wsrc/t238013.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Chinese Premier Meets with Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of People's Republic of China|date= 2008-10-24|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/zxxx/t519594.htm[/tpl]
In addition, [tpl]nihongo|East Sea|東海|Tōkai[/tpl] is not the Sea of Japan but the Pacific Ocean in the Japanese context. The regions on the east coast of Japan were named accordingly as the Tōkaidō region and the Tōkai region.
The Japanese government is concerned that the name change could set a bad precedent and cause more naming disputes worldwide.

==Position of international bodies==

The main two international organizations which have been involved in the naming dispute are the International Hydrographic Organization and the United Nations.

===International Hydrographic Organization===

The International Hydrographic Organization is an organization that coordinates with member countries over hydrographic issues.  One of the organization's functions is to help set international standards on the naming and delineation of nautical regions.  In 1929, the organization (then called the International Hydrographic Bureau) published "IHO Special Publication 23" (IHO SP 23), which established the name of the sea as Sea of Japan; however, at that time, Korea could not participate in the IHO because it was under Japanese rule.[tpl]cite web|title=IHO Special Publication 23|url=http://eastsea.nori.go.kr/eng/open_content/iho/magazine.asp|publisher=Korean Hydrographic and Oceanographic Administration|year=2004|accessdate=10 September 2010[/tpl]  South Korea officially joined the IHO in 1957.[tpl]cite web|title=Major Historical Background Information|url=http://www1.kaiho.mlit.go.jp/GIJUTSUKOKUSAI/nihonkai/keii_eng.htm|publisher=Japan Coast Guard|date=29 January 2009|accessdate=21 November 2010[/tpl]
In 1974, IHO released Technical Resolution A.4.2.6. This resolution stated that:
 It is recommended that where two or more countries share a given geographical feature (such as a bay, a strait, channel or archipelago) under different names, they should endeavor to reach agreement on a single name for the feature concerned. If they have different official languages and cannot agree on a common name form, it is recommended that the name forms of each of the languages in question should be accepted for charts and publications unless technical reasons prevent this practice on small scale charts. 
South Korea has argued that this resolution is relevant to the debate about the Sea of Japan and implies that both names should be used; Japan, however, argues that the resolution does not apply to the Sea of Japan, because it does not specify this body of water and only applies to geographical features for which sovereignty is shared between two or more countries.
The IHO agreed to conduct a survey available evidence in 2011. Previously, South Korea had been pushing the IHO to recommend only using the term East Sea, but announced on 2 May 2011, that it now preferred the gradual approach of using both names now, and eventually dropping the Sea of Japan name.[tpl]cite news|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2935590 |title=Gov’t goes easy on East Sea renaming demand |publisher=Korea Joongang Daily |date=2 May 2011[/tpl] (Archived by WebCite® at http://www.webcitation.org/5yNg4hY4N)
On 26 April 2012, the IHO announced that it had decided to use only "Sea of Japan" in its governing publication Limits of Oceans and Seas and rejected the alternative use of "East Sea" as proposed by South Korea.  According to the South Korean government, the organization will again discuss the issue of the name when it reconvenes in 2017.

===United Nations===

While the United Nations has never directly addressed the issue of establishing an official, standardized name for the sea, several resolutions and statements by the UN have had relevance to the topic.  Japan joined the United Nations in 1956, while South and North Korea both joined in 1991.[tpl]cite web|title=Member States of the United Nations|url=http://www.un.org/en/members|publisher=United Nations|date=3 July 2006|accessdate=10 September 2010[/tpl]
In 1977, the third U.N. Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names (UNCSGN) adopted Resolution III/20, entitled "Names of Features beyond a Single Sovereignty". The resolution recommended that "when countries sharing a given geographical feature do not agree on a common name, it should be a general rule of cartography that the name used by each of the countries concerned will be accepted. A policy of accepting only one or some of such names while excluding the rest would be inconsistent as well as inexpedient in practice."  As with IHO Technical Resolution A.4.2.6, South Korea and Japan disagree about whether or not this policy applies to the Sea of Japan.
In 1992, during the 1992 Sixth UNCSGN, the South Korean government, in their first time participating in UNCSGN, requested that the name of the sea be determined through consultation, which the North Korean representative concurred with.  The Japanese representative stated that the name of the Sea of Japan had already been accepted worldwide and that any change would introduce confusion. The conference recommended that the parties work together on the issue outside of the conference.[tpl]citation|title=Report of the Sixth UNCSGN Conference|id=United Nations Publication E.93.I.23|pages=21–22|publisher=United Nations|year=1993[/tpl]
In 1998, South Korea raised the issue again at the Seventh UNCSGN. Japan, however, opposed the method by which the South Korean government proposed the issue, arguing that they had not followed the proper procedure for doing so. Following some debate, South Korea withdrew the issue, and instead recommended that the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names work so that a resolution could be submitted to the Eighth UNSCGN conference. The president of the conference urged that Japan, South Korea, and North Korea work towards a mutually acceptable agreement.[tpl]cite web|title=Report of the Seventh UNCSGN Conference|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/7th-uncsgn-docs/7thUNCSGN-Report_E-.pdf|page = 18|publisher=United Nations|date = 13–22 January 1998|accessdate=30 March 2011[/tpl]
At the Eighth UNCSGN in 2002, South Korea and Japan presented a number of papers to the conference regarding their positions on the naming issue.  South Korea asked for a resolution to adjudicate the name, while Japan asked that the name be decided through resolution outside of the conference.  No resolution was passed, and the Committee again urged the countries to develop a mutually agreeable solution.  The chairman further noted that standardization could only occur after consensus had been reached.[tpl]cite web|title=Eighth UNCSGN Conference Report|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/8th-uncsgn-docs/8th_UNCSGN-E.pdf|publisher=United Nations|pages = 29–30|date = 27 August – 5 September 2002|accessdate=30 March 2011[/tpl] The same situation occurred at the Ninth conference in 2007. South Korea and North Korea both proposed a resolution by the UNCSGN, while Japan expressed a desire to settle the matter outside of the conference, and the Committee urged the members to seek a mutual agreement.[tpl]cite web|title=Ninth UNCSGN Conference Report|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/9th-uncsgn-docs/report%20of%209th%20uncsgn%20n0750902%20en.pdf|pages = 29–30|publisher=United Nations|date = 21–30 August 2007| accessdate=23 September 2010[/tpl]
On 23 April 2004, the United Nations affirmed in a written document to the Japanese government that it will continue using the name Sea of Japan in its official documents.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/un0406.html | title = The Policy of the United Nations Concerning the Naming of [tpl]'[/tpl]Sea of Japan[tpl]'[/tpl] | publisher = Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan |date=June 2004|accessdate =22 November 2010[/tpl] However, it agreed to leave the topic open for further discussion. In a letter to South Korea, it was explained that the UN was not determining the validity of either name, but wished to use the term most widely used until the parties resolved the disagreement.  The letter further stated, "The use of an appellation by the Secretariat based on the practice is without prejudice to any negotiations or agreements between the interested parties and should not be interpreted as advocating or endorsing any party's position, and can in no way be invoked by any party in support of a particular position in the matter."[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.mofat.go.kr/pdffiles/en_Eastsea_1.htm| title = The Practice of the Secretariat of the United Nations Concerning the Naming of the Sea Area between Korea and Japan, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of South Korea | accessdate =22 November 2010 | publisher = South Korea Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade[/tpl]
On 6 August 2012, representatives from North and South Korea addressed an assembly at the United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names, asking that the names "East Sea" and "Sea of Japan" be used concurrently for the sea.  [tpl]Ill|nl|Ferjan Ormeling[/tpl], chairman of the conference, responded that the organization had no authority to decide the issue and requested that the involved countries resolve the differences over the name amongst themselves.Jiji Press, "Genba stands firm on Senkakus; Koreas in 'East Sea' push", Japan Times, 8 August 2012, p. 2
