==History==

In the early 1920s the old boys of five of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales decided to establish a Sydney central business district base for their fellow alumni.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16319664 |title=SCHOOL CLUBS, LTD. |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954) |location=NSW |date=30 September 1926 |accessdate=8 August 2013 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]  Those involved in the development of this idea wanted to provide a clubhouse where men, who had recently left school and had undertaken business careers, could meet. It was anticipated that these club facilities would assist the schools' sporting and development appeals. The founding president was an Old Newingtonian, Eric Kelynack (1882-1957), who a former chairman of the Institute of Incorporated Accountants. He was the son of the Rev Dr William Kelynack a notable Methodist churchman and former President of Newington.[tpl]Citation | author1=Swain, Peter L.

==Facilities==

Initially some facilities were shared but each member school managed a separate club room in its own style. Because some members were under the legal drinking age the club didn't become licences until 1947. The original clubhouse was demolished in 1962 for the Australia Square development and the club transferred to a new building near Circular Quay. In the mid-1970s the club sold its premises and merged with the University Club. It moved to Phillip Street to form The University & Schools Club.The University And Schools Club â€“ Lawlink NSW Retrieved 8 August 2013
