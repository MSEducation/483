Though often confused with the Harvard Coop,[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] the store has no affiliation with Harvard University or the Harvard Coop bookstore, which is managed by Barnes & Noble.  With a focus on an academic and intellectual audience, the store's selection and customer service is repeatedly honored by local publications and surveys.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
