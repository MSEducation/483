==Description==

Valle is not included on many roadmaps, including the Rand McNally Road Atlas annual series.Rand McNally.  The Road Atlas '08. Chicago: Rand McNally, 2008, p. 7-8.  The town sits  to the west of the highway intersections, with some streets to the east of US 180. More recent online aerial photography maps alone reveal the enormous airport, and what appears to be an extensive subdivision layout, about 20 city blocks in length and width, but with only a few houses or trailers scattered around the many desert-lawned streets.  The area of Valle, Arizona has the appearance of subdivided roads due to a planned community in which [tpl]convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] lots were sold during the early 1960s.  These roads are all dirt with the exception of the two main highways (US 180 and AZ 64).  With the exception of a few property owners who have set up camp on their land, the area has not been developed.
Valle maintains no website. It has two main gas stations, several gift shops, and a small post office.
