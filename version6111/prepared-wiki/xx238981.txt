==About the Concerto==

The concerto was created after Kastle was invited to perform at UCLAâ€™s Royce Hall. After the invitation, he went to work on some music designed especially for the venue and its difficult acoustics. By the time he finished the Royce Concerto and before the contracts were signed, organizers had changed their minds about booking him. He refused to change the name.[ref]
