Orders Is Orders is a 1934 British comedy film starring Charlotte Greenwood, James Gleason and Cyril Maude about an American film crew who move into a British army barracks to start making a film, much to the commander's horror. Much of the film concerns the interaction between the American crew and the British officers.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024419/[tpl]cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6b2485fd |title=Orders Is Orders | BFI | BFI |publisher=Explore.bfi.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08[/tpl]

==Critical reception==

In The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall called the film, "a tepid farce...It is an adaptation of a minor stage work written by Ian Hay and Anthony Armstrong, and the wonder is that the producers, Gaumont-British, thought it worthy of such an excellent company of players. On the credit side of this piece of buffoonery and punning there are the interesting glimpses in a military barracks, splendid photography and sound recording and good-natured work by the cast."
