===Chicago Cubs and Cleveland Indians===

Carter first reached the majors in [tpl]by|1983[/tpl] with the Chicago Cubs,[tpl]cite journal|last=Doyle|first=Al|date=January 1987|title=Joe Carter: An Emerging Star for Revived Indians|journal=Baseball Digest|publisher=Lakeside Publishing|volume=46|issue=1|page=19|issn=0005-609X|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XDQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA19|accessdate=2009-05-07[/tpl] but was traded to the Cleveland Indians the following year, where he blossomed into a star. Carter emerged as a prolific power hitter, hitting as many as 35 home runs in a season and regularly driving in 100 or more runs. He usually hit nearly as many doubles as he did homers, and would get respectable numbers of triples in many years too. He was also a very good baserunner, stealing 20-30 bases a year with a high rate of success; in 1987, Carter became a rare member of the single-season 30–30 club for home runs/stolen bases. However, he was considered a below-average defensive outfielder. The Indians publicly criticized his defense and low batting average after he left, although Cleveland was a below average team after his departure, while Carter contributed to multiple championships elsewhere.

===San Diego Padres===

After a strong [tpl]by|1989[/tpl] season, Carter was traded by Cleveland to the San Diego Padres for prospects Sandy Alomar, Jr., Carlos Baerga, and Chris James. Although he continued to drive in runs, he also continued to have defensive problems. The Padres subsequently dealt him to the Toronto Blue Jays along with Roberto Alomar in exchange for star players Fred McGriff and Tony Fernández.

===Toronto Blue Jays===

Carter's overall game improved dramatically in [tpl]by|1991[/tpl], as he helped the Toronto Blue Jays win the division title and hit the game-winning single that clinched the AL East championship; he also emerged for the first time as a team leader. In [tpl]by|1992[/tpl], he helped the Jays win their first World Series championship, the first ever won by a Canadian-based team. Carter hit two home runs and recorded the final out of the Series, taking a throw to first base from reliever Mike Timlin to nab Otis Nixon of the Atlanta Braves, who bunted. This was the first time a World Series ended on a bunt.
Carter, along with Edwin Encarnación, are the only two Blue Jays to hit two home runs in one inning, with Carter's coming against the Baltimore Orioles in 1993 and Encarnacion's against the Houston Astros in 2013.

====1993 World Series====

In [tpl]by|1993[/tpl], the Blue Jays reached the World Series again, facing the Philadelphia Phillies. In Game 6, with the Blue Jays leading three games to two, Carter came to bat with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning with the Blue Jays trailing 6–5 and Rickey Henderson and Paul Molitor on base. On a 2–2 count, Carter hit a three-run walk-off home run off Phillies pitcher Mitch Williams (against whom he was 0–4 career) to win the World Series, only the second time a Series has ended with a home run (the other being in 1960, when Bill Mazeroski did it for the Pittsburgh Pirates against the New York Yankees), and the only time the home run has been hit by a player whose team was trailing in the bottom of the 9th inning in a potential championship clinching game. Upon hitting the home run, Carter went into a hysteria, jumping up and down many times, most notably while rounding first base, where his helmet came off.
Carter is also the only player ever to both record the final out in one World Series, and get a series-clinching walk-off hit in another.

====1994–1997====

Carter continued to play for the Blue Jays until 1997, and led the Blue Jays in home runs and RBIs in 1994 and 1995.
When he represented the Blue Jays at the 1996 All-Star Game, he received boos for his home run that won the Blue Jays the 1993 World Series, as the game took place at Veterans Stadium, then the home of the Philadelphia Phillies.[tpl]cite news|title=Carter Likes Even the Boos at the Vet|date=July 9, 1996|first=Sam|last=Carchidi|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|page=D6[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=To Phillie fans, Carter still Public Enemy No. 1|date=July 10, 1996|first=Hal|last=Bodley|newspaper=USA Today|page=3C|quote=Joe Carter...walked out onto the sizzling Veterans Stadium turf...held his head high...and heard the boos even before he was introduced.

===Baltimore Orioles and San Francisco Giants===

He became a free agent in [tpl]by|1998[/tpl] and briefly played for the Baltimore Orioles and San Francisco Giants before retiring. Carter ended his career by popping out to end the game in a one-game playoff against the Chicago Cubs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bluejays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080922&content_id=3526704&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=One-game playoffs have been epics | MLB.com: News |publisher=Bluejays.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28[/tpl]

===Career statistics===

Carter was named to five All-Star teams. In his career he hit 396 home runs and drove in 1445 runs. He drove in 100 runs in a season ten times, including the [tpl]by|1994[/tpl] year, which was cut short due to the strike that occurred 115 games into the year. He was the first player to record 100 RBI for three different teams in three consecutive seasons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Joe_Carter_1960&page=chronology|title=Joe Carter from the Chronology|author=Charlton, James|publisher=BaseballLibrary.com|accessdate=2008-11-03[/tpl] In 1993, while a Toronto Blue Jay, Carter set an American League record when he hit 3 home runs in a game for the fifth time in his career. (The record was tied 10 years later by another Blue Jay – Carlos Delgado.)
Carter was also involved in the final plays of four games in which the Blue Jays clinched a championship: 1) The game-winning single to clinch the 1991 American League East division championship, 2) catching the final out at first base in the 1992 World Series, 3) catching the final out on a fly ball to right field in the 1993 American League Championship Series, and 4) the walk-off home run in Game 6 of the 1993 World Series.
