==History==

In 1596, Rumana  appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being  in the nahiya of Tabariyya in the liwa of Safad. It had a population of 9 households, all Muslim. The villagers paid taxes on wheat, barley, fruit trees,   cotton, goats and beehives.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 188.
Biblical scholar Edward Robinson passed by the village in 1852, and assumed it was the ancient Rimmon of the Tribe of Zebulun.Robinson and Smith, 1856, p. 109 ff French explorer Victor Guérin described  the village in 1870s as being small, and protected from the outside  by a continuous wall, and hedges of cactus. He also found many fine remains from former times and also speculates that it might  be the Biblical site of Rimon, which is mentioned in the Book of Joshua.Guérin, 1880, pp. 365 ff (Joshua 19:13)  In the 1881 "Survey of Western Palestine",  the village (called Rummaneh)  was described as:  A small village built of stone, and containing about 70 Moslems. It is situated on a low ridge above the plain, and there are a few olive-trees around. The water supply is from cisterns and a well.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, vol. 1, p.    363
