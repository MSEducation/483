Oberlin College is a private liberal arts college in Oberlin, Ohio, noteworthy for having been the first American institution of higher learning to regularly admit female and black students in addition to white males. The Oberlin Conservatory of Music, part of the college, is the oldest continuously operating conservatory in the country."[tpl]cite web|title=Fast Facts - Oberlin College|url=http://new.oberlin.edu/about/fast-facts.dot|publisher=Oberlin College|accessdate=18 September 2013[/tpl] Oberlin is noted for its political and social significance, often serving as "the prototype for progress even in the face of strong resistance."[tpl]cite web|title=Oberlin College & Conservatory|url=http://www.oberlin.edu[/tpl]
Oberlin is a member of the Great Lakes Colleges Association and the Five Colleges of Ohio consortium.

==History==

Both the college and the town of Oberlin were founded in northern Ohio in 1833 by a pair of Presbyterian ministers, John Jay Shipherd and Philo P. Stewart.Cityofoberlin.com The ministers named their project after Jean-Frédéric Oberlin, an Alsatian minister whom they both admired. Oberlin attained prominence because of the influence of its second president, the evangelist Charles Finney, after whom one of the College's chapels and performance spaces is named. Asa Mahan (1800–1889) served as Oberlin's first president from 1835–1850.

A History of Oberlin College From Its Foundation Through the Civil War. Chicago:  R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company, 1943. Print. who lived in Connecticut. Shipherd and Stewart's vision was for both a religious community and school. For a more detailed history of the founding of the town and the college, see Oberlin, Ohio.
Oberlin has long been associated with progressive causes. Its founders bragged that "Oberlin is peculiar in that which is good." Oberlin was the first college in the United States to regularly admit African-American students, beginning in 1835. Oberlin College's role as an educator of African-American students prior to the Civil War and thereafter is historically significant.Constructing Black Education at Oberlin College
In 1844, Oberlin College graduated its first black student, George B. Vashon,[http://blackamericanweb.com/?q=articles/news/the_black_diaspora_news/18489 [tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] who became one of the founding professors at Howard UniversityJournal of Blacks in Higher Education Chronology of Major Landmarks in the Progress of African Americans in Higher Education, and the first black lawyer admitted to the Bar in New York State. The African Americans of Oberlin and those attending Oberlin College "have experienced intense challenges and immense accomplishments since their joint founding in 1833. Its African American and other students of color have used education and activism to influence the college, the town, and beyond. Their efforts have helped Oberlin remain committed to its values of freedom, social justice, and service."African Americans at Oberlin, Then and Now The College's approach to African Americans was by no means perfect.  Nonetheless, Oberlin graduates accounted for a significant percentage of African-American college graduates by the end of the 19th century.
It is also the oldest continuously operating coeducational institution, since having admitted four women in 1837. These four women, who were the first to enter as full students, were Mary Kellogg (Fairchild), Mary Caroline Rudd, Mary Hosford, and Elizabeth Prall. All but Kellogg graduated. Mary Jane Patterson graduated in 1862 as the first black woman to earn a B.A. degree. The college was listed as a National Historic Landmark on December 21, 1965, for its significance in admitting African Americans and women.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=450&ResourceType=Site|title=National Historic Landmarks Program - Oberlin College|work=|accessdate=8 May 2007[/tpl] The college had some difficult beginnings, and Keep and William Dawes were sent to England to raise funds for the college in 1839–40.The culture of English antislavery, 1780-1860, David Turley, p192, 1991, ISBN 0-415-02008-5, accessed April 2009
One historian called Oberlin "the town that started the Civil War" due to its reputation as a hotbed of abolitionism.Brandt, Nat (1990). The town that started the Civil War. Syracuse University Press. ISBN 0-8156-0243-X. Oberlin was a key stop along the Underground Railroad. In 1858, both students and faculty were involved in the controversial Oberlin-Wellington Rescue of a fugitive slave, which received national press coverage. Two participants in this raid, Lewis Sheridan Leary and John Anthony Copeland, along with another Oberlin resident, Shields Green, also participated in John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry.  This heritage was commemorated on campus by the 1977 installation of sculptor Cameron Armstrong's "Underground Railroad Monument" (a railroad track rising from the ground toward the sky)Underground Railroad Monument and monuments to the Oberlin-Wellington RescueOberlin-Wellington Rescue Monument and the Harper's Ferry Raid.Harper's Ferry Memorial
Oberlin College was also prominent in sending Christian missionaries abroad.  In 1881, students at Oberlin formed the Oberlin Band to journey as a group to remote Shanxi province in China. A total of 30 members of the Oberlin Band worked in Shanxi as missionaries over the next two decades. Ten died of disease and in 1900, fifteen of the Oberlin missionaries, including wives and children, were killed by Boxers or Chinese government soldiers during the Boxer Rebellion.Brandt, Nat Massacre in Shansi, Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1994
The Oberlin Shansi Memorial Association, an independent foundation, was formed in their memory. The Association, with offices on campus, sponsors Oberlin graduates to teach in China, India, and Japan. It also hosts scholars and artists from Asia to spend time on the Oberlin campus.
Mount Oberlin in Glacier National Park was named after the college.[tpl]cite web| title =Discovery and Exploration| work =| publisher =National Park Service| date =| url =http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/glac/adhi1b.htm| archiveurl =//web.archive.org/web/20060223005012/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/glac/adhi1b.htm| archivedate =2006-02-23| accessdate =2007-01-12[/tpl]
Oberlin's school colors are cardinal red and mikado yellow, often casually referred to as "crimson and gold."  Those colors were formally designated for the college by a faculty committee in 1889 and were drawn from the family coat of arms of John Frederick Oberlin.Oberlin College They remain in the official registry of school colors maintained by the American Council on Education.

===Dormitories and change in social rules===

Oberlin's older dormitories, such as Keep, Pyle, and Tank, were characterized by a home-like environment.  As the college acted to provide expanded newer dormitory and dining facilities, the new dorms, such as Dascomb, Harkness, Barrows, and North, were built with more institutional architecture.    Historian Geoffrey Blodgett, a professor and graduate of Oberlin, pointed out that campus dorms caused anger among students during the 1960s. Students reacted vocally against the new dorms of the 1950s and 1960s (Dascomb, East, North and South), calling them expedient "slabs" of "sleeping and feeding space".Blodgett, Geoffrey (May 11, 1995). "The Grand March of Oberlin campus plans". Oberlin Observer. Vol. 16 No. 17 Sec. Observations. (web archive: Oberlin.edu) Just as important, however, was student concern over what was perceived as archaic social and dining rules.  Historically, evening dining occurred at women's dorms and semi-formal attire was required.   Women were subjected to a curfew, enforced by an honor system and women's student panels, whereas men were not. A formal dating parlor with chaperones was maintained on the second floor of Wilder Hall.   Gradually, student activists began to press for change, and throughout the 1960s, the College implemented less and less restrictive social rules.  For college activists, dorm and social rules protests were dwarfed in importance by both the Civil Rights Movement and growing discontent with the Vietnam War. Hebrew House, as it was known, was set up as winter term project to operate similar to an Israeli kibbutz.
In 1970, Oberlin made the cover of Life as one of the first colleges in the country to have co-ed dormitories.College web site  The article featured two students who lived in South Hall. At first, the dorm was floor-by-floor co-ed, which was considered quite radical. Dean of Women Rose Montague and the two senior residents in the dorm at the time were guests on a Chicago TV station morning talk show soon after Life's article came out, to talk about the "experiment". The program, "Kennedy and Company," sought to reveal the "darker" side of co-ed dorm life from parents' perspective. The male senior resident (Lloyd Blanchard) was asked on live TV if he had "ever had sex in the dorm," to which he replied, "That's really none of your business." Starting in the 2010-11 school year—except for several women-only halls, Baldwin Cottage Women and Trans* Collective, and the Edmonia Lewis Center for Women and Transgender People—Oberlin students were allowed to room with students of any gender in any room on campus.Oberlin College | Resed Housing | Gender Policies

==Academics==

Of Oberlin's nearly 3,000 students, nearly 2,400 are enrolled in the College of Arts & Sciences, a little over 400 in the Conservatory of Music, and the remaining 180 or so in both College and Conservatory under the five-year Double-Degree program.[tpl]cite web|title=Applying to Oberlin: Double-Degree Program|url=http://new.oberlin.edu/applying/double-degree.dot|work=Oberlin College|accessdate=15 January 2013[/tpl]

===College of Arts & Sciences===

The College of Arts & Sciences offers over 45 majors, minors, and concentrations. Based on students graduating with a given major, its most popular majors over the last ten years have been (in order) English, Biology, History, Politics, and Environmental Studies. The College's science programs are considered strong, especially Biology, Chemistry and Physics. The college is home to the world's first undergraduate Neuroscience program.[tpl]cite web|title=Sciences at Oberlin|url=https://new.oberlin.edu/arts-and-sciences/sciences-at-oberlin/|publisher=Oberlin College|accessdate=23 February 2014[/tpl]

===Conservatory of Music===

The Conservatory is located on the college campus. Conservatory admission is rigorous, with over 1400 applicants worldwide auditioning for 120 seats. Students benefit from over 500 performances yearly, most free of charge, with concerts and recitals almost daily. The Conservatory was one of the recipients of the 2009 National Medal of Arts.NEA News Room: 2009 National Medal of Arts - The Oberlin Conservatory of Music

===Allen Memorial Art Museum===

The Allen Memorial Art Museum, with over 12,000 holdings, was the first college art museum west of the Alleghenies.Short Tour: Allen Art Museum

===College Library===

Oberlin College Library system is one of the largest and finest undergraduate libraries in the nation.  In addition to the main library there are branch libraries for art, music, and science, and a central storage facility.  The libraries have strong collections of print and media materials and provide access to an extensive array of online databases and journals.  Beyond the 2.4 million-plus items available on campus, Oberlin students have rapid access to more than 46 million volumes from over 85 Ohio institutions in through the OhioLINK consortium.Oberlin College Library  In addition to the breadth of its holdings, the Oberlin College Library is recognized for its quality: it received the Association of College and Research Libraries Excellence in Academic Libraries Award in 2002,[tpl]Wayback |date=20081020060754 |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/awards/excellenceacademic.cfm |title=Excellence in Academic Libraries Award [/tpl] and in 2006 Director of Libraries Ray English was named the ACRL's Academic-Research Librarian of the Year.[tpl]Wayback |date=20081020005242 |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/awards/librarianoftheyear/englishspeech.cfm |title=Ray English's Acceptance Speech [/tpl] In the summer of 2007 the main level of the main library was converted into an Academic Commons that provides integrated learning support and is a hub of both academic and social activity.

===OhioLINK consortium===

Oberlin students and faculty benefit by Oberlin's membership in the OhioLINK consortium, providing access to 12,000+ commercially licensed online journals, 130 databases, 18,000+ ebooks and is rapidly growing digital media collections. The OhioLINK Central Catalog represents the library holdings of 87 libraries in the state, including the State Library of Ohio, plus the Center for Research Libraries. The collection is nearing 10 million unique records representing 27.5 million holdings in the system, and undergraduates account for the larger percentage of OhioLINK online borrowing – the process by which any enrolled student can readily request the loan of books and other items from any other library in the system.

===Experimental College===

The college's "Experimental College" or ExCo program, a student-run department, allows any student or interested person to teach their own class for a limited amount of college credit. ExCo classes by definition focus on material not covered by existing departments or faculty.
Many courses supplement conventional disciplines, from languages and areas of cinema or literature, to musical ensembles like Steel Drums and Javanese gamelan, martial arts and forms of dancing.  Other ExCos cover an array of topics, in the past ranging from AquariumsFall 2002 Exco course listing to Wilderness SkillsSpring 2003 Exco course listing to Hacky Sack to philosophical discussions of Calvin and Hobbes.  Due to the nature of ExCo, while some staple courses are continued for years, the overall number and selection of classes offered varies dramatically from semester to semester. For example, 'Contracts and Social Order' was taught for only the Spring and Fall semesters in 2005 by an off-campus non-affiliated sociologist.EXCO Committee

===Winter Term===

Another aspect of Oberlin's academics is the Winter Term during the month of January. This term was created to allow students to do something outside the regular course offerings of the college. Students may work alone or in groups, either on or off campus, and may design their own project or pick from a list of projects and internships set up by the college each year. Students must complete a winter term project three years out of their four in the College of Arts and Sciences. Projects range from serious academic research with co-authorship in scientific journals, to humanitarian projects, to making avant-garde films about historic Chicago neighborhoods, to learning how to bartend. A full-credit project is suggested to involve five to six hours per weekday.Office of Winter Term

===Student Cooperative Association===

The Oberlin Student Cooperative Association, or OSCA, is a non-profit corporation that houses 175 students in four housing co-ops and feeds 620 students in nine dining co-ops. Its budget is more than $2 million, making it the third-largest of its kind in North America behind the Berkeley Student Cooperative and the Inter-Cooperative Council of Ann Arbor,[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl] and by far the largest relative to the size of the institution whose students it serves.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]
OSCA is entirely student-run, with all participating students working as cooks, buyers, administrators, and coordinators. Every member is required to do at least one hour per week of cleaning, ensuring that no one is valued above others. Most decisions within OSCA are made by modified consensus. Oberlin bans all fraternities and sororities, making the co-ops the largest student-organized social system at the college. In addition to OSCA's four housing and six dining cooperatives, Brown Bag Co-op is an OSCA-backed grocery that sells personal servings of food at bulk prices.
Outside of housing and dining, OSCA also includes the Bike, Film, Photography and, for a while, Pottery Co-op. These institutions are not only open to students, but any member of the Oberlin community. The services are intentionally open in order to foster a mutual bond between faculty, students and residents of the town. OSCA also funds the Nicaragua Sister Partnership (NICSIS), a "sister cooperative" with Nicaragua's National Union of Farmers and Ranchers (UNAG). NICSIS works as a micro-lending program with a mission to empower female members of the community and provide superior benefits for laborers.

===Art rental===

Oberlin's museum has a unique art rental program. At the beginning of every semester students camp out in front of the north gate of the college's Allen Memorial Art Museum to get first pick of original etchings, lithographs and paintings by artists including Renoir, Warhol, Dalí, and Picasso. For five dollars per semester, students can hang these works on their dorm room walls. The program was started in the 1940s by Ellen H. Johnson, a professor of art at Oberlin, in order to "develop the aesthetic sensibilities of students and encourage ordered thinking and discrimination in other areas of their lives."Angell, Sue (September 26, 2005). "Art Rental Still Going Strong After 60 Years". Oberlin Online: News and Features. (web link: Oberlin.edu)

===Film===

Thomas Edison's moving picture show was shown in Oberlin in February 1900.Blodgett, Geoffery. "The Early Apollo". Oberlin Online: News and Features. (web link: http://new.oberlin.edu/apollo/history.dot) Just seven years later, Oberlin's Apollo Theater opened, and became one of the first theaters to install sound equipment, for the 1928 release of The Jazz Singer, the first "talkie." The theater has since been a mainstay in the Oberlin community at its comfortable locale on south campus, and in 2012 became the centerpiece for The Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman Cinema Studies Center for Media Education and Production. It includes editing labs, an animation area, a recording studio and small projection screening room.Farkas, Karen (September 20, 2012). "Apollo Theatre in Oberlin reopens and includes new home for cinema studies department". Cleveland.Com". (web link: http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2012/09/apollo_theatre_in_oberlin_reop.html)

===Music===

In addition to Oberlin Conservatory, Oberlin has musical opportunities available for amateur musicians and students in the college.  The entirely student-run Oberlin College Marching Band (OCMB), founded in 1998, performs at various sporting events including football games, women's rugby, and pep rallies throughout the year.  There are a number of a cappella groups, including Pitch, Please (co-ed), the Obertones (all-male), the Acapelicans (all-female), Nothing But Treble (all-female), and 'Round Midnight (co-ed jazz). In addition, students in the college can form chamber groups and receive coaching through the Conservatory. Student composers also provide a demand for musicians to perform their work.
The college radio station WOBC-FM, and the party circuit (including the popular on-campus venue, The 'Sco) contribute to the campus music scene. Many alumni have pursued careers in popular and indie music, including members of the bands The Mars Volta, Rasputina, Come, Deerhoof, Liz Phair, Josh Ritter, Songs: Ohia, The Sea and Cake, Teengirl Fantasy, Tortoise, Trans Am, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Skeletons, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Due in part to both this and the school's proximity to Cleveland, the college attracts touring artists with a frequency nearly unparalleled among institutions of its size.

===Political activism===

Oberlin students have a reputation for being notably liberal, libertarian or progressive. The college was ranked among the Princeton Review's' list of "Colleges with a Conscience" in 2005.Colleges with a conscience Recent activism among the student body has resulted in a campus-wide ban on sales of Coca-Cola products.Taylor, Samantha (November 19, 2004). "College set to ban Coca-Cola". Oberlin Review (web link: Oberlin.edu)
In the 1960s, Memorial Arch became a rallying point for the College's civil rights activists and its anti-war movement. Oberlin supplied a disproportionate number of participants in Mississippi Freedom Summer, rebuilt the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in the Carpenters for Christmas project, supported NAACP sponsored sit-ins in Cleveland to integrate the building-trades, and with the SCLC participated in demonstrations at Hammermill Paper.
Oberlin is also known for its liberal attitude toward sexuality and gender expression. Oberlin was ranked among the 20 friendliest campuses for LGBT students in The Advocate's College Guide for LGBT Students.The Advocate College Guide for LGBT Students is the best ever road map to gay-friendly campuses. Even if we do say so ourselves. Several different student groups exist to support the interests of LGBT students and their allies.
The school hosts a student-run Sexual Information Center, where students may receive free or heavily discounted condoms and lubricant, confidential peer counseling on sexual issues, and free rides to clinics in the area. The Sexual Information Center sponsors Safer Sex Week, originally started in the 1980s as a response to the AIDS crisis. Oberlin's Drag Ball Committee hosts Drag Ball, which marks Transgender Awareness week. Both these events are well-attended by students, although they have drawn criticism from conservatives.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/articles/Read.aspx?GUID=63F0BBAF-685D-49D8-811D-FA1BF266CB2B |title=Radical Activist U: Oberlin College |date=2003-11-05 |accessdate=2008-10-02 |author=Pearce, Jean |publisher=FrontPageMag[/tpl]
A sampling of the school's past commencement speakers reflects its reputation for embracing diversity, ranging from Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Jesse L. Jackson to figures as varied as Pete Seeger and Robert Frost; even Adlai Stevenson appeared, a month prior to his death.

==Sustainability==

Oberlin College has demonstrated its commitment to the pursuit of sustainability on a  number of fronts. In 2006, Oberlin became one of the character institutions to sign the ACUPCC and set a target climate neutrality date for 2025.Oberlin College | Office of Environmental Sustainability | Carbon Neutrality Oberlin's innovative Adam Joseph Lewis Center For Environmental Studies, a building the Department of Energy labeled as one of the "milestone" buildings of the 20th century, incorporates a 4,600 square foot (425 square meter) photovoltaic array, the biggest of its kind in Ohio at the time. The AJLC also features a Living Machine, garden, orchard, and parking lot solar array.
The school utilizes biodiesel, hybrid, and electric vehicles for various purposes, offers financial support to a local transit company providing public transportation to the school, and has been home to the Oberlin Bike Co-op, a cooperatively run bicycle center, since 1986. Each residence hall  monitors and displays real time and historic electricity and water use. Some dorms also have special lamps which display a color depending on how real time energy use compares to the average historic energy use. The school's Campus Committee on Shareholder Responsibility provides students, faculty, and staff with the opportunity to make suggestions and decisions on proxy votes.
In 2007, Oberlin received a grade of "B+" from the Sustainable Endowments Institute's annual College Sustainability Report Card, and was featured among schools as a "Campus Sustainability Leader"."College Sustainability Report Card 2008" Sustainable Endowments Institute. Retrieved on July 20, 2008.  In 2008, Oberlin received an "A-" on the annual College Sustainability Report Card."College Sustainability Report Card 2009" Sustainable Endowments Institute.

According to a 2010 article in The Oberlin Review, renovated dorms may use more electricity.Rebecca Cable, Renovated Dorms May Use More Energy, The Oberlin Review, April 2010, p. 1. This is the case for several dorms renovated during the summer of 2008. The College architect, Steve Varelmann, has called the numbers "erratic and possibly unreliable." According to Varelmann, a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that previously non-functioning equipment started functioning again after the renovation.[ref]Rebecca Cable, Renovated Dorms May Use More Energy, The Oberlin Review, April 2010,
p. 4.[/ref] Students may also be at blame for their behavior: "What electronic devices are they using? Are they voluntarily reducing light usage? Are spaces experiencing increased use due to the improvements achieved from the renovation?"Rebecca Cable, Renovated Dorms May Use More Energy, The Oberlin Review, April 2010, p. 4. John Scofield, professor of physics at Oberlin concluded that "We are building more and more efficient buildings, yet we're using more energy."

==Publications and media==

Oberlin students publish a wide variety of periodicals. The college's largest publications are The Oberlin Review and The Grape. The Oberlin Review is a traditional weekly newspaper, focusing on current events, with a circulation of around 2,500. The Grape is Oberlin's student-run alternative newspaper. There is also a newspaper pertaining to the interests of students of color, called In Solidarity.
Magazines on campus include Wilder Voice, a magazine for creative nonfiction and long-form journalism,Wilder Voice Drivel Magazine, a satire and humor publication,Drivel Magazine The Plum Creek Review, a literary review containing student-written fiction, poetry, translations, and visual art,Plum Creek Review Headwaters Magazine, an environmental magazine,Headwaters Magazine and The Synapse, a science magazine.List of Oberlin College Student GroupsThe Synapse Magazine Spiral is a magazine focused on genre fiction.

==Athletics==

The school's varsity sports teams are the Yeomen and Yeowomen. The name Yeomen arose in the early 1900s (decade) as a result of blending the former team moniker with the school's official motto. Early on in the program, football players and other athletes were known simply as Oberlin Men or "O" Men. Eventually, as the athletic department became more cohesive, the Yeomen mascot was adopted, drawing on the phonetic sound of "O" Men and the schools official motto of "Learning and Labor". As women's sports became more prevalent, "Yeowomen" was adopted to describe the mascot representing women's athletics. They participate in the NCAA's Division III and the North Coast Athletic Conference. Oberlin's football team was the first team coached by John Heisman, who led the team to a 7–0 record in 1892. Oberlin is the last college in Ohio to beat Ohio State (winning 7–6 in 1921). Though in modern times, the football team was more famous for losing streaks of 40 games (1992–1996) and 44 games (1997–2001), the Yeomen have enjoyed limited success in recent years.
The college also hosts several private sports teams, including the Oberlin Ultimate team. Oberlin Ultimate was founded in 1976 and is often among the top 10 teams in its region. Recently, leaders of the Athletic Department and various club sports have spoken out in favor of increased institutional support for the teams, requesting that the College provide access to professional sports trainers and team transportation.[tpl]cite news |author=Karlgaard, Joe, et al. |title=Club Sports Demand Equal Attention |url=http://www.oberlin.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/ocreview/20080516.php?a=l_club_sports&sec=letters |work=The Oberlin Review |date=2007-10-05 |accessdate=2008-08-09 [/tpl]

===Football===

Oberlin football plays its home game at Savage Stadium.

===Cheerleading===

In 2011, Oberlin began its most recent attempt to feature a cheerleading squad. In 2006, a cheerleader fell from atop a pyramid at a football game, initiating the demise of Oberlin's Cheerleading Club. That injury prompted the school to restrict the club's activities, prohibiting stunting and tumbling, after which participation fizzled out. The club's charter, however, remained intact and was used to bring the squad back in 2011. Tryouts were held in the spring of 2011 and the cheerleading team went active at Oberlin's first home football game that Fall, a 42-0 win over Kenyon College. The squad also cheers for the basketball team and participates in spirit building and service events across campus and in the community.[tpl]cite web|last=Perry|first=Nick|title=Oberlin Cheerleading Club Revived|url=http://www.fearlessandloathing.com/2011/09/oberlin-cheerleading-club-revived/|publisher=Fearless and Loathing|accessdate=10 October 2011[/tpl]
