al-Nahr ([tpl]lang-ar|النهر[/tpl]) was a Palestinian village 14 km northeast of Acre. It was depopulated in May 1948 after a military assault carried out by the Carmeli Brigade as part of the Israel Defense Forces's Operation Ben-Ami. Immediately after the assault the village of al-Nahr was razed.Morris, 2004,  (third printing 2006), p 253Benvenisti, 2000, pp. 138-139

==History==

The twin villages of Al-Nahr and nearby al-Tall were both sites of ancient settlements atop the tel of Kabri. Recent excavations indicate habitation back to the sixth millennium BC.

In the  Ottoman period, the village appeared under the name of  El Qahweh in   Pierre Jacotin´s map from 1799.Karmon, 1960, p. 160
In 1875,  the French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village, which he called El Kahoueh. He found it to have 120 inhabitants, all Muslims.Guérin, 1880,  p. 31   In 1881  the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine described the village, then named El Kahweh, as  a  "stone village, containing about 250 Moslems,  situated on the plain, surrounded by figs, olives, mulberries, and pomegranates; there is a spring and flowing stream at this village."Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I,  p. 146
In villagers of Al-Nahr were Muslim, and lived principally of agriculture and animal husbandry.  In 1944/45 it had a population of 610 Arabs, with 5,261 dunams of land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in S. Hadawi, Village Statistics, 1945.

===1948 War and aftermath===

On March 27, 1948, hundreds of armed villagers and units of the Arab Liberation Army attacked a Jewish convoy near  Kabri, killing forty-nine Jews.  Six Arabs were also killed in the battle.  Two months later the commander of Operation Ben-Ami gave operational orders given that day were to "attack with the aim of capturing, the villages of Kabri, Umm al Faraj and Al-Nahr, to kill the men and and to destroy and set fire to the villages."Morris, 2004, pp. 253, 347. Benvenisti states that "the orders were carried out to the letter", while Morris writes that a number of villagers were apparently executed.Morris, 2004, p. 254.
The Israeli settlement of Kabri makes use of village land. The settlement of Ben Ami, named after the fallen commander of an attack on nearby Nahariyya, was also established on the village land.
In 1992, the village site was described as "Only two houses remain, and one of them is partially destroyed. A tall date-palm tree grows on the village site, which is overgrown by wild grasses, a few cactuses, and fig trees. The cemetery, on the western side of the village contains one identifiable grave. The nearby Fawwara spring has been fenced in and declared private property."
