[[33]]

CATEGORIES: 33

Year 33 (XXXIII) was a common year starting on Thursday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known in the Roman world as the Year of the Consulship of Ocella and Sulla (or, less frequently, year 786 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 33 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
