==Personal life==

Ullmann was born in Tokyo, Japan, the daughter of Viggo Ullmann, a Norwegian aircraft engineer who was working in Tokyo at the time, and Janna (née Lund), also Norwegian.  When she was two years old, the family relocated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where her father worked at the Norwegian air force base on Toronto Island (in Lake Ontario) during World War II.[tpl]cite news |work= Toronto Star |title=Unravelling Little Norway's Big Secrets |page=M03 |date=10 May 1986 |last=Jones |first=Donald[/tpl] Four years later, her father died of a brain tumor, an event that affected her greatly.

==Career==

Ullmann began her acting career as a stage actress in Norway during the mid-1950s. She continued to act in theatre for most of her career, and became noted for her portrayal of Nora in Henrik Ibsen's play A Doll's House, but became better known once she started to work with Swedish movie director Ingmar Bergman. She later acted, with acclaim, for 10 of his most-admired movies, including Persona (1966), The Passion of Anna (1969), Cries and Whispers (1972) and Autumn Sonata (1978), in which her co-actress, Ingrid Bergman, resumed her Swedish cinema career. She co-acted often with Swedish actor and fellow Bergman collaborator, Erland Josephson, with whom she made the Swedish television drama, Scenes from a Marriage (1973), which was also edited to feature-movie length and distributed theatrically. Ullmann acted with Laurence Olivier in A Bridge Too Far (1977), directed by Richard Attenborough.
Nominated more than 40 times for awards, including various lifetime achievement awards, she won the best actress prize three times from the National Society of Film Critics, three times from the National Board of Review, received three awards from the New York Film Critics Circle and a Golden Globe. During 1971, Ullmann was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for the movie The Emigrants, and again during 1976 for the movie Face to Face.
Ullmann made her New York City stage debut in 1975 also in "A Doll's House."  Appearances in "Anna Christie" and "Ghosts" followed, as well as the less than successful musical version of I Remember Mama. This show, composed by Richard Rodgers, experienced numerous revisions during a long preview period, then closed after 108 performances. She also featured in the widely deprecated musical movie remake of Lost Horizon during 1973.
In 1980 Brian De Palma, who directed Carrie, wanted Liv Ullmann to play the role as Kate Miller in the erotic crime thriller Dressed to Kill and offered her the role, but she declined because of the violence.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] The role then went on to Angie Dickinson. In 1982 Ingmar Bergman wanted Ullmann to play the main role as Emelie Ekdahl in his last feature film, Fanny and Alexander, and wrote this role for her with this in mind.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] But Ullmann felt this role was too sad and declined. Liv Ullmann later stated in interviews that turning down the role was one of the few things she really regrets.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
During 1984 she was chairperson of the jury at the 34th Berlin International Film Festival,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1984/04_jury_1984/04_Jury_1984.html |title=Berlinale: 1984 Juries|accessdate=21 November 2010 |publisher = Berlin International Film Festival[/tpl] and during 2002 chaired the jury of Cannes Film Festival. She introduced her daughter, Linn Ullmann, to the audience with the words: "Here comes the woman whom Ingmar Bergman loves the most". Her daughter was there to receive the Prize of Honour on behalf of her father; she would return to serve the jury herself during 2011.
In 2004 Ullmann revealed that she had gotten an offer in November 2003 to play in the popular American show, Sex and the City.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] Ullmann was amused by the offer and said that it was one of the few she actually regularly watched, but she turned down the offer.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] Later that year Steven Soderbergh wrote a role specially for Liv Ullmann in the movie Ocean's 12 and offered her this role, but also this role was turned down by Ullmann.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Ullmann narrated the Canada–Norway co-produced animated short movie The Danish Poet (2006), which won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film at the 79th Academy Awards during 2007.

==Directing career==

Ullmann's first film as a director was Sofie (1992), in which she directed her friend and former co-actor, Erland Josephson. She later directed the Bergman-composed movie Faithless (2000) and reprised her role for Scenes from a Marriage in Saraband (2003), Bergman's final telemovie. Faithless garnered nominations for both the Palme d'Or and Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival.
During 2006 Ullmann announced that she had been forced to end her longtime wish of making a movie based on A Doll's House. According to her statement, the Norwegian Film Fund was preventing her and writer Kjetil Bjørnstad from pursuing the project. Australian actress Cate Blanchett and British actress Kate Winslet had been cast intended in the main roles of the movie. She later directed Blanchett in the play A Streetcar Named Desire, by Tennessee Williams, at the Sydney Theatre Company in Sydney, Australia, which was performed September through October 2009, and then continued from 29 October to 21 November 2009 at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., where it won a Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Non-resident Production as well as actress and supporting performer for 2009. The play was also performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Brooklyn, New York.
In 2013 it was announced that Ullmann would direct a film adaptation of Miss Julie. The film, set to be released in 2014, stars Jessica Chastain, Colin Farrell and Samantha Morton.http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/01/entertainment/la-et-cm-jessica-chastain-miss-julie-liv-ullman-20130131
