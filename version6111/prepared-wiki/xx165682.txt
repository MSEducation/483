[[Visions Of...]]

CATEGORIES: Torch albums, 2003 EPs

Visions of... is an Torch studio EP, released independently on November 23, 2003 through Hardstar Records.
The band recorded a pre-production before the recording of their EP, although only 1 song would end up on the EP. B-sides includes the songs Far From Alone and Get Myself A Beer.
The album garnered good reviews, and would shortly after see them co-headlining the Taste New Norway Tour in Norway with friends Miksha and Turdus Musicus supporting the EP. During this tour, Torch established their position as one of the craziest live bands in Norway.
The EP is considered the band's most extreme release, and they occasionally perform the songs live. Blindfold for instance is often included on their set. A clip of Torch performing Blindfold can be found on this location.
