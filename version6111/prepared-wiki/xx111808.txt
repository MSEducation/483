[[Egginton]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Derbyshire

Egginton is a village in the local government district of South Derbyshire, England.  It is located just off Ryknild Street, otherwise known as the A38, between Derby and Stretton, Burton upon Trent.  It is historically a farming community.  Due to a historical legal situation, no alcohol is allowed to be sold in the village and hence there is no village pub. [tpl]fact|date=May 2012[/tpl]
In Fishpond Lane there is a row of tenants' cottages, some of which have their windows bricked up, dating back to the days of window-tax. 
The village does not have a war memorial in the normal sense but has a memorial hall which doubles as the village school and community hall.
