Rupert Darnley Anderson O.B.E., (29 April 1859 - 23 December 1944) was an English football player who played for Old Etonians, as well as the English national side.
Anderson was born in Liverpool, the fifth of six children. He was educated at Eton and then went up to Cambridge. His club career began and ended with Old Etonians. Unfortunately, he missed the team's 1879 F.A. Cup final triumph through injury.http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamPlyrsBios/PlayersA/BioAndersonRD.html
Also in 1879, Anderson made his sole appearance for the England team, playing in goal (his usual position being that of a forward) against Wales. The match was hampered by snowy conditions and the game was reduced to just sixty minutes of play. The game ended 2-1 to England.http://englandstats.com/players.php?pid=17
In March 1889, Anderson married Amy Harland and they went on to have five children.
