==Clinical Medical Ethics==

In the 1970s, Dr. Mark Siegler helped launch the field of clinical medical ethics in the Biological Sciences Division of the University of Chicago. Clinical medical ethics is a practical, applied field that aims to improve patient care and outcomes. Clinical ethics helps patients, families and professionals reach good clinical decisions based on medical facts, patient preferences, and ethical considerations. The MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago has played a major role in creating, establishing, and expanding the field of clinical medical ethics. In 1983, the MacLean Center was established after receiving a naming gift from Dorothy Jean MacLean and the MacLean family. The MacLean Center was inspired by the clinical models of William Osler and Alvan Feinstein. The Center has helped to change and expand American medical ethics by helping to bring ethics to the bedside. During the past 40 years, clinical ethics has emerged as one of the core components of the American bioethics movement. Today, virtually every major hospital has an ethics committee or ethics consultation service available to help resolve most ethical problems; scholarly clinical ethics papers are published widely in both bioethics and medical journals; medical organizations now have ethics committees and codes of ethics; newspapers cover important clinical ethics issues; and most importantly, clinical ethics deliberations and analyses have become part of the clinical conversation that occurs routinely in doctors’ offices and hospitals across the country.
