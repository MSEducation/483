CATEGORIES: Aviation magazines, South African magazines

SA Flyer is a South African aviation magazine published monthly in Johannesburg. The publication was originally founded in 1995 by Mike De Villiers and Mario Vergottini with the magazine's edition 1 released in July 1995. It was purchased by Guy Leitch in 2006 who has been running the magazine since.
Aimed at aircraft owners and pilots, there is a strong focus on safety which is reflected by the training-dedicated articles, anecdotal accounts of in-flight emergencies and accident reports. The magazine is generally composed of news, columns, featured articles, market-place listings, fly-in or airshow reports and sometimes a supplement featuring a popular aerodrome in South Africa.
FlightCom is also a South African magazine released in association with SA Flyer. FlightCom has been used as a vehicle to cover all aspects of the Aviation Industry in Africa and the Middle East. Consequently, it has a much broader scope and is very often focused on larger aircraft and airline operations. As part of SA Flyer, FlightCom now offers a quality magazine to cover the aviation events occurring in Africa and the Middle East.
