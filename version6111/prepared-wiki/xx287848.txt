CATEGORIES: Town and country planning in the United Kingdom

In England, an Asset of Community Value is land or property of importance to a local community which is subject to additional protection from developmenthttp://www.bathnes.gov.uk/services/neighbourhoods-and-community-safety/localism-and-community-planning/new-community-rights/as under the Localism Act 2011.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2421/contents/made Voluntary and community organisations can nominate an asset to be included on their local authority's register of ACVs.
The owner of an ACV must inform the local authority if they wish to sell the asset. If a group wants to buy the asset, they can trigger a  moratorium for six months, to give them a chance to raise the money to purchase the asset. The owner does not have to sell to a community group, the ACV listing only improves the chances of community groups being able to purchase by proving more time to raise funds, it does not require the owner to sell at a discount.  http://www.camden.gov.uk/ccm/content/community-and-living/localism-act-2011/localism-act-2011.en?page=3
