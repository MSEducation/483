==History==

What is now Route 45 was originally designated as a segment of pre-1927 Route 6 in 1917. This route was to head south from Camden and follow Route 45 to Mullica Hill, where it split into two branches, with one going to Salem on current Route 45 and another going to Bridgeton on current Route 77.[tpl]cite report|title=1917 Annual Report|publisher=New Jersey Department of Transportation|date=1917[/tpl][tpl]cite map |url=http://www.jimmyandsharonwilliams.com/njroads/1920s/maps/1927tt2.jpg|title=Map of New Jersey|year=1927|publisher=Tydol Trails|accessdate=2009-03-30[/tpl]  In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, pre-1927 Route 6 between Camden and Salem became Route 45.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319.[tpl]cite map|url=http://www.jimmyandsharonwilliams.com/njroads/1920s/images/1927_routes.gif|title=1927 New Jersey Road Map|publisher=State of New Jersey| accessdate=2008-10-08[/tpl] A bypass around Camden was created as the southern half of Crescent Boulevard, a part of U.S. Route 130, and Route 45 was rerouted to use the bypass up to the Airport Circle in Pennsauken Township. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the northern terminus of Route 45 was cut back to its current location in Westville to avoid the concurrency with U.S. Route 130.[tpl]Cite document|title=1953 renumbering|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1953_New_Jersey_state_highway_renumbering|publisher=New Jersey Department of Highways|accessdate=July 31, 2009|postscript=.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|accessdate=2009-07-20|title=New Road Signs Ready in New Jersey|publisher=The New York Times |date=December 16, 1952 |url=http://img123.imageshack.us/img123/6933/19521216newroadsignsreaiu6.jpg[/tpl]
In the late 1960s, the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) proposed construction of a [tpl]convert|10|mi|adj=on[/tpl] long, $20 million freeway along the Route 45 corridor in Gloucester County which would have extended from Exit 24 of Interstate 295 in Woodbury to a planned U.S. Route 322 freeway in Mullica Hill.[tpl]cite book|title=1985 Regional Transportation Plan|publisher=Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission |year=1969[/tpl] The New Jersey Department of Transportation never followed through on this proposal. A portion of Route 45 was widened to four lanes from the border of Woodbury to the border of Mantua Township by the 1980s.[tpl]cite map|publisher=State Farm Insurance|title= State Farm Road Atlas |year=1983|cartography=Rand McNally[/tpl] In 2012, the Mullica Hill Bypass was completed, and US 322 was removed from its concurrency with Route 45.[tpl]cite web|last=Forand|first=Rebecca|title=Route 322 Bypass now open|url=http://www.nj.com/gloucester-county/index.ssf/2012/01/route_322_bypass_now_open.html|work=Gloucester County Times|date=January 11, 2012|accessdate=February 7, 2012[/tpl]

==Future==

The New Jersey Department of Transportation is planning on rebuilding Route 45 in Woodbury to make it more friendly to pedestrians and bicyclists. The project calls for reducing the road from four lanes to three lanes while adding bike lanes, curb extensions to improve safety for pedestrians, and improvements to curb ramps and crosswalks. It is currently in the design stage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/works/njfit/route45.shtm|title=New Jersey FIT: Future In Transportation - Route 45 Road Diet Study|publisher=New Jersey Department of Transportation|accessdate=July 20, 2013[/tpl]
