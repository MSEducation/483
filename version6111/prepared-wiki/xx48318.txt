==History==

LFWA was created on 1 September 1991, taking command of what was previously Prairie Militia Area, Pacific Militia Area, and the Regular Force Army units and formations in western Canada from the northern lakehead region of Ontario to the Pacific Ocean.  At that point in time, the Militia Areas ceased to exist, and the seven subordinate Militia Districts were reorganised into four: British Columbia District, Alberta District, Saskatchewan District, and Manitoba-Lakehead District.[tpl]Cite web|title=Domestic Military Organization 1900-1999|publisher=Canadian Soldiers.com|date=22 February 2013|url=http://www.canadiansoldiers.com/organization/districts.htm[/tpl]
Later that decade, the four reserve force districts were again reorganized into three Canadian Brigade Groups.
In 2013, it LFWA was renamed 3rd Canadian Division.  With this change of name, the formation was also granted the identifying patch and historical lineage to the division that fought in the two world wars.
