Lysmata debelius is a species of cleaner shrimp indigenous to the Indo-Pacific. It is popular in the aquarium trade, where it is known as the fire shrimp, blood shrimp or scarlet cleaner shrimp.

==Taxonomy==

Lysmata debelius was first described by A. J. Bruce in 1983, based on type material from Polillo Island in the Philippines.[tpl]cite journal |author=A. J. Bruce |year=1983 |title=Lysmata debelius, new species, a new hippolytid shrimp from the Philippines |journal=Revue Française d'Aquariologie et Herpetologie |volume=4 |pages=115–120 |url=http://www.aquaportail.com/uploads/pdf/lysmata-debelius.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl] The specific epithet commemorates Helmut Debelius, who had collected the specimens and sent them to a zoologist for identification. A divergent population from Ari Atoll in the Maldives was later described as a separate species, L. splendida, by Rudolf Burukovsky.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rudolf N.

==Description==

Lysmata debelius grows up to [tpl]convert|3|cm[/tpl] long, with males and females appearing similar.[tpl]cite book |author=Helmut Debelius |year=1994 |title=Marine Atlas: the Joint Aquarium Care of Invertebrates and Tropical Marine Fishes |publisher=Steven Simpson Books |isbn=978-3-88244-051-5 |chapter=Natantia |pages=468–561 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EOY28s5U9ukC&pg=PA474[/tpl] It has a red body, with conspicuous white antennae and white tips to the third to fifth pereiopods.[tpl]cite book |author=Ricardo Calado |year=2008 |title=Marine Ornamental Shrimp: Biology, Aquaculture and Conservation |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-1-4051-7086-4 |chapter=Collected and traded species |pages=9–22 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vkjt5gS82MUC&pg=PA18[/tpl] There are white dots on the cephalothorax and legs; white dots on the abdomen distinguish L. splendida from L. debelius.

==Ecology==

Lysmata debelius is one of a group of species in the genus Lysmata that has the role of a cleaner shrimp in reef ecosystems, alongside L. ambonensis, L. grabhami and L. splendida.[tpl]cite journal |author=Andrew L. Rhyne & Junda Lin |year=2006 |title=A Western Atlantic peppermint shrimp complex: redescription of Lysmata wurdemanni, description of four new species, and remarks on Lysmata rathbunae (Crustacea: Decapoda: Hippolytidae) |journal=Bulletin of Marine Science |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=165–204 |url=http://decapoda.nhm.org/pdfs/27306/27306.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl] It is a popular aquarium pet.
L. debelius is a hermaphrodite and therefore any two individuals may mate. The hatching of eggs, moulting, and copulation cycle is identical to that of L. wurdemanni, yielding weekly batches of zoeae from each pair.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.advancedaquarist.com/issues/nov2004/breeder.htm |author=Porter Betts |year=2004 |title=Captive observations of fire shrimp larvae |publisher=Advanced Aquarist's Online Magazine[/tpl]
