The 1996–97 S.L. Benfica season involved Benfica competing in the Primeira Divisão and the Taça de Portugal. Benfica qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners Cup by winning the previous Taça de Portugal.[tpl]cite web|title=Squad 1996/97|url=http://www.foradejogo.net/team.php?team=2&ano=1997&escalao=0&mode=M|work=foradejogo.net[/tpl] 
Paulo Autuori was named new coach, replacing Mário Wilson. The season started with the humiliating defeat in the Supertaça, which damaged confidence in Autuori and in new reinforcements like Bermúdez and Jamir.[tpl]cite web|title=100 anos: Paulo Autuori|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=161950|work=record.xl.pt|date=26 May 2003[/tpl] 
In the Primeira Divisão, Benfica achieved first place by the third round, keeping it till 8th round, where a loss in Alvalade relegated them to second place. In the winter transfer window, regular starters Hélder and Dimas were sold, further exasperating the team defensive cohesion.  Two losses against Porto and Vitória Guimarães caused the dismissal of Autuori. Mário Wilson was interin for a game, another defeat, this time against Belenenses, causing the "Reds" to tumble down to third. It was the first time since 1957 that Benfica lost three league games in a row. Manuel José was named new manager. Benfica remained inconsistent, ending the season with another three straight defeats, against exactly the same clubs, 27 points from first place, and with ten league defeats, both a new record low.[tpl]cite book|title=Almanaque do Benfica|year=2012|publisher=Lua de Papel|isbn=978-989-23-2087-8|page=548[/tpl] 
In the Taça de Portugal, Benfica had the advantage of playing all of knockout matches at home, eliminating Porto on their way to the final. Great performances from Erwin Sánchez and Nuno Gomes, both of them joined the club the following season, prevented Benfica from lifting their second Portuguese Cup in the row. The season started an eight year period of trophyless seasons.[tpl]cite web|title=1996/97 - Boavista 3 - Benfica 2 (Final Taça de Portugal)|url=http://nacionalmaior.blogspot.pt/2009/08/199697-boavista-3-benfica-2-final-taca.html|work=nacionalmaior.blogspot.pt|date=9 August 2009[/tpl]  
In Europe, Benfica returned to the UEFA Cup Winners Cup, after reaching the semi-final three years earlier, but on this occasion, they were stopped by Rui Costa's Fiorentina in the quarter-final.[tpl]cite web|title=Efeméride – Benfica na Taça das Taças (1996/97)|url=http://aoutravisao.wordpress.com/2012/01/04/efemeride-benfica-na-taca-das-tacas-199697/|work=aoutravisao.wordpress.com|date=4 January 2012[/tpl]
