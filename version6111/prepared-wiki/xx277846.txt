George Garrett (born 1909) was an Irish hurler who played as a centre-back for the Cork senior team.
Born in Cork, Garrett first excelled at hurling in his youth. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-two when he joined the Cork senior team for the 1931 championship. Garrett went on to play a key role for Cork in what was a decade-long barren spell for the team, and won one All-Ireland medal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/cork/Profile.aspx|title=Cork GAA profile|publisher=Hogan Stand websitet|date=|accessdate=8 August 2013|first=|last=[/tpl]
