==Background==

The recording process of "Bad Girl" was featured on the second season of the MTV reality television show, Making the Band 4.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/shows/making_the_band_4/season_2/episode.jhtml?episodeID=132146|title=Making The Band 4 (Season 2) | Episode : Danity Kane Attacks! | Video, Photos | MTV|date=February 25, 2008|work=MTV.com|publisher=MTV Networks|at=Full Episode Summary|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v3lXvCTD|archivedate=December 17, 2010|accessdate=December 17, 2010|quote=Things keep going well for Danity Kane the next day in the studio, when Diddy comes through for them and gives them a 'cocky and sassy' track that fits their bad-girl personality.|postscript=.[/tpl] They received the track only after revealing their dissatisfaction with the direction of their album to Diddy (their executive producer).[tpl]Cite episode |title=Danity Kane Attacks!|url=http://www.mtv.com/shows/making_the_band_4/season_2/episode.jhtml?episodeID=132146|accessdate=December 17, 2010|series=Making the Band 4|serieslink=Making the Band#Season two|credits=Combs, Sean (Executive Producer)|network=MTV|airdate=February 27, 2008|season=2|number=5[/tpl]
After recording three songs (two of which being "Is Anybody Listening" and "Poetry"), the group feared that the songs revealed a trend that indicated Diddy's and the record label's concept for their new album.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/shows/making_the_band_4/season_2/episode.jhtml?episodeID=132146|title=Making The Band 4 (Season 2) | Episode : Bitchassness | Video, Photos | MTV|date=February 4, 2008|work=MTV.com|publisher=MTV Networks|at=Full Episode Summary|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v3s6ekYR|archivedate=December 18, 2010|accessdate=December 18, 2010|quote=Meanwhile, the ladies begin working on a new song, "Poetry", about a relationship where one person isn't being honest.|postscript=.[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/shows/making_the_band_4/season_2/episode.jhtml?episodeID=130765|title=Making The Band 4 (Season 2) | Episode : Battle of the Sexes | Video, Photos | MTV|date=January 28, 2008|work=MTV.com|publisher=MTV Networks|at=Full Episode Summary|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v3sYnIFV|archivedate=December 18, 2010|accessdate=December 18, 2010|quote=The girls nail a song called "Is Anybody Listening," proving that they already have a winning formula in place.|postscript=.[/tpl] These opinions were first voiced during a studio session with Jim Beanz, Aundrea Fimbres stating they wanted a "pop-international album". Next, Aubrey O'Day represented the band's opinions in a conversation with their A&R, Conrad Dimanche. "Conrad, please just understand when I say this ... album was more about learning and growing. And now, we found ourselves. So this album, to us, has to feel like we found ourselves, and we don't feel that yet." He tried to explain to her that the team's goal was "to have an incredible album", the same as Danity Kane's, but O'Day rebutted. She continued, stating the songs so far recorded consisted of "these 'I Want You Back', 'I Miss You', 'I Need You' songs," but clarified herself, adding, "I'm not saying there can't be those moments where we're vulnerable." She concluded, "We are strong women ... and we need to be able to sing that."
Dissatisfaction continued to be expressed as the girls received prospective tracks, with Dawn Richard commenting, "They just don't match us!" The group's unhappy comments reached a new level during a visit with their then label-mates, Day26, in the studio. While listening to their tracks "Are We in This Together" and "I'm the Reason", O'Day made the startling comment, "It's catchy. You know? It's like ... It's got energy. All of our tracks, I wanna slit my fucking throat ... I am so happy that people love you enough to give you good tracks."
After the numerous complaints, Diddy arranged a meeting with the band at Circle House Recording Studios. Getting over her initial nerves, O'Day relayed the same message to Diddy as she had to Dimanche. D. Woods helped convey this message, adding that they wanted to "understand his vision" and that they "had a different idea" and thought "he did too", going in a more uptempo direction. Diddy defended his stances on the issue, stating, "If I feel something, then I at least want to hear your texture on it. That's the play that I'm calling. Go run the play!" O'Day countered, continuing that the process of making the album was "personal" and that he would best understand this, him being a recording artist in his own right. She followed that the group understood that they would not love everything that they ever did and it would be a "compromise", but none of them have finished a track, wanting to perform it forever as part of their career.
Surprisingly, Diddy apologized for the lack of communication and started taking Danity Kane's opinion into account while creating the album. Days later, they received the uptempo track that would become "Bad Girl".

==Music video==

The music video for "Bad Girl" was shot late June to early July 2008 in Los Angeles, California and premiered on the MTV programming block FNMTV Premieres on July 25.[tpl]cite news |first=Chris|last=Harris|title=Danity Kane Embrace Femme Fatale Alter Egos In Fast-Paced 'Bad Girl' Clip|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1590198/20080630/kane__danity.jhtml?rsspartner=rssFeedBurner|work=MTV News|publisher=MTV Networks|date=June 1, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v3jyQQ8E|archivedate=December 17, 2010|postscript=.[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Bow Wow, Danity Kane, & Pink on ‘FNMTV’|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2008/07/24/bow-wow-danity-kane-pink-on-fnmtv/|work=Rap-Up|date=July 24, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2009|quote=Danity Kane are among the artists premiering new videos this Friday at 8 p.m. on 'FNMTV' ... the ladies of Danity Kane will premiere the video for their second single “Bad Girl” with Missy Elliott.|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v3FOHYkD|archivedate=December 17, 2010|postscript=.[/tpl] It was directed by Erik White and choreographed by Gil Duldulao. The video also includes cameos by featured rapper Missy Elliott, Qwanell Mosley (who was a member of Day26 and their label-mates at the time), and Talan Torriero of the hit MTV reality series Laguna Beach.[tpl]cite video |people=White, Erik (Director)|date=July 24, 2008|title=Danity Kane - Bad Girl (Video) Missy Elliott|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFzws_oKl9k|format=flv|medium= |language=Music video|publisher=Bad Boy Records|location=New York City, New York, United States|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=December 17, 2010[/tpl] It also reached the top position of the Billboard Hot Videoclip Tracks chart in 2008.kane|chart=Hot Videoclip Tracks}} [tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl]
The concept of the video is a graphic novel and stays true to the famous lyric in the song, "When the red light comes on, I transform," as each group member transforms into an alter ego of theirs after a flash of red light. In the first verse and the first chorus, Aubrey O'Day portrays a con trying to claim her innocence during interrogation with a detective (played by Torriero). After a flash of red light, "The Sweet Aubrey" transforms. Now wearing a tight leather catsuit, she throws him on the table, straddles him, and handcuffs him to her chair. She leans in for a kiss before making her escape. D. Woods portrays a peep show performer enchanting her suitor. After a flash of red light, "The Luscious D.Woods", now in all leather, grabs him and drags him into the peep show window. The impact knocks him out, leaving her to take all of his money.
During the second verse through the rap break, Dawn Richard portrays a damsel in distress strapped to an upright gurney in "Dr. Q's Secret Laboratory". Dr. Q (played by Mosley) examines, licks, and bites her while taking observations of her in a lustful manner. Time is about to run out for "The Lovely Dawn" when a flash of red light appears. Suddenly, she changes wardrobe, breaks free, grabs the doctor and slams him on the gurney, returning his lusty looks. Aundrea Fimbres portrays a hostage imprisoned in a dark basement, who is chained up and planning her escape. Her muscular captor looks over her with a metal pipe in his hands, contemplating his next move. After a flash of red light, "The Ravishing Aundrea" breaks free of the chains and knocks out her kidnapper. Meanwhile, Missy Elliott is seen beside a machine rapping the 2nd verse the same place where Dawn and Aundrea escapes.
In the bridge section of the song till the last chorus, Shannon Bex portrays a biker babe being chased through "Gotham City" on her motorbike by a male biker. He blows a kiss to her, showing his intentions. After a flash of red light, Bex transforms and kicks him in his face, knocking him off his motorbike.
Intermixed between these shots are all of the alter egos of Danity Kane, engaging in hard-hitting choreography, sometimes joined by "The Mighty Missy Elliott". The video ends with the "DK" logo transforming into a starry sky.
