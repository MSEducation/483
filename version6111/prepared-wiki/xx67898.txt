Amherstview is a community in Loyalist Township, Ontario.
It is located on the north shore of Lake Ontario and has a population of approximately 10,000. It is adjacent to the city of Kingston, and considered part of the greater Kingston area. Amherstview is named for Amherst Island, located directly to the south in Lake Ontario. When the community was first established in the 1950s, the spelling was generally "Amherst View".
The community is the eastern end of the Loyalist Parkway, a stretch of Highway 33 that travels along Lake Ontario, in an area in which many United Empire Loyalists settled.  Amherstview is home to Fairfield House which is itself situated in Fairfield Park on the shore of Lake Ontario.  Fairfield House was constructed in 1793 by the Fairfield family who were among the first Loyalists to settle the area.  It served as the family home and a portion of the building was also used as a tavern for some time.  The impressive limestone building is now a museum exhibiting period artifacts and furniture and offering guided tours.
Public transportation between Amherstview and Kingston is provided by Kingston Transit.
Since Amherstview is part of Loyalist Township, it has no legal boundaries. General boundaries are Lake Ontario to the south, the Canadian National rail line to the north, Coronation Boulevard to the east (the City of Kingston boundary), and Lennox and Addington County Road 6 to the west.
Amherstview is also home to the educational institution Amherstview Public School, and elementary and middle school composed of students in grades kindergarten through eighth grade.
