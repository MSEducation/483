The Tullie Smith House is a small plantation or farm house, built circa 1840 by Robert Smith. It is typical of the usual kind of plantation houses owned by small farmers.  The house was located in Dekalb County, Georgia on [tpl]convert|800|acre|km2[/tpl].  The last Smith to occupy the property was Tullie, the great-great-granddaughter of Robert.  By the 1960s the house was surrounded by highways and development, and was donated to the Atlanta Historical Society.  The house was moved in 1969 to its present site in Atlanta on the grounds of Swan House. 
The house has been restored and is operated by the Atlanta History Center as a 19th-century historic house museum known as the Smith Family Farm.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/atlanta/tul.htm|date=2008-10-07|work= TAtlanta: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary|title= Tullie Smith House|publisher=National Park Service[/tpl]  Living history presentations are given during special events.
