[[File:Selection Types Chart.png|thumb|left|A chart showing three types of selection.
1. Disruptive selection
2. Stabilizing selection
3. Directional selection]]
Natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range of values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is directional selection, which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time — for example, organisms slowly getting taller.[tpl]cite journal |author = Hoekstra H, Hoekstra J, Berrigan D, Vignieri S, Hoang A, Hill C, Beerli P, Kingsolver J |title = Strength and tempo of directional selection in the wild |journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume = 98 |issue = 16 |pages = 9157–60 |year = 2001 |pmid = 11470913 |pmc = 55389 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.161281098 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.9157H [/tpl] Secondly, disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common, with selection against the average value. This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in stabilizing selection there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity.[tpl]cite journal |author = Felsenstein |title = Excursions along the Interface between Disruptive and Stabilizing Selection |journal = Genetics |volume = 93 |issue = 3 |pages = 773–95 |date = November 1, 1979 |pmid = 17248980 |pmc = 1214112 |ref = harv [/tpl] This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.
A special case of natural selection is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates.[tpl]cite journal |author = Andersson M, Simmons L |title = Sexual selection and mate choice |journal = Trends Ecol. Evol. (Amst.) |volume = 21 |issue = 6 |pages = 296–302 |year = 2006 |pmid = 16769428 |doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2006.03.015 |ref = harv [/tpl] Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, large body size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males.[tpl]cite journal |author = Kokko H, Brooks R, McNamara J, Houston A |title = The sexual selection continuum |pmc = 1691039 |journal = Proc. Biol. Sci. |volume = 269 |issue = 1498 |pages = 1331–40 |year = 2002 |pmid = 12079655 |doi = 10.1098/rspb.2002.2020 |ref = harv [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Quinn|first=Thomas P.|author2=Andrew P.

Natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals and individual traits, are more or less likely to survive. "Nature" in this sense refers to an ecosystem, that is, a system in which organisms interact with every other element, physical as well as biological, in their local environment. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, defined an ecosystem as: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms...in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity and material cycles (ie: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system."Odum, EP (1971) Fundamentals of ecology, third edition, Saunders New York Each population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct niche, or position, with distinct relationships to other parts of the system. These relationships involve the life history of the organism, its position in the food chain and its geographic range. This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to delineate specific forces which, together, comprise natural selection.
Natural selection can act at different levels of organisation, such as genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and species.[tpl]cite book |last1 = Okasha |first1 = S. |year = 2007 |title = Evolution and the Levels of Selection |publisher = Oxford University Press |isbn = 0-19-926797-9 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author = Gould SJ |title = Gulliver's further travels: the necessity and difficulty of a hierarchical theory of selection |journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume = 353 |issue = 1366 |pages = 307–14 |year = 1998 |pmid = 9533127 |pmc = 1692213 |doi = 10.1098/rstb.1998.0211 |ref = harv [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author = Mayr E |title = The objects of selection |doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.6.2091 |journal = Proc.

===Biased mutation===

In addition to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias.[tpl]cite journal |author = Lynch, M. |year = 2007 |title = The frailty of adaptive hypotheses for the origins of organismal complexity |journal = PNAS |volume = 104 |pages = 8597–8604 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0702207104 |bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.8597L |pmid = 17494740 |pmc = 1876435 |issue = suppl. 1 [/tpl] If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve.[tpl]cite journal |title = Deterministic Mutation Rate Variation in the Human Genome |journal = Genome Research |author = Smith N.G.C., Webster M.T., Ellegren, H. |year = 2002 |volume = 12 |pages = 1350–1356 |doi = 10.1101/gr.220502 |url = http://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/9/1350.abstract |issue = 9 |pmid = 12213772 |pmc = 186654 [/tpl] Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes.[tpl]cite journal |author = Petrov DA, Sangster TA, Johnston JS, Hartl DL, Shaw KL |year = 2000 |title = Evidence for DNA loss as a determinant of genome size |journal = Science |volume = 287 |pages = 1060–1062 |doi = 10.1126/science.287.5455.1060 |issue = 5455 |bibcode = 2000Sci...287.1060P |pmid = 10669421 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author = Petrov DA |year = 2002 |title = DNA loss and evolution of genome size in Drosophila |journal = Genetica |volume = 115 |pages = 81–91 |doi = 10.1023/A:1016076215168 |issue = 1 |pmid = 12188050 [/tpl] Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution.[tpl]cite journal |author = Kiontke K, Barriere A , Kolotuev I, Podbilewicz B , Sommer R, Fitch DHA , Felix MA |year = 2007 |title = Trends, stasis, and drift in the evolution of nematode vulva development |journal = Current Biology |volume = 17 |pages = 1925–1937 |doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.061 |issue = 22 |pmid = 18024125 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author = Braendle C, Baer CF, Felix MA |year = 2010 |title = Bias and Evolution of the Mutationally Accessible Phenotypic Space in a Developmental System |journal = PLoS Genetics |volume = 6 | id = e1000877 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000877 |issue = 3 |editor1-last = Barsh |editor1-first = Gregory S |pages = e1000877 |pmid = 20300655 |pmc = 2837400 [/tpl] For example, according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution, mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment.[tpl]cite journal |last = Palmer |first = RA |title = Symmetry breaking and the evolution of development |journal = Science |year = 2004 |pages = 828–833 |volume = 306 |doi = 10.1126/science.1103707 |pmid = 15514148 |issue = 5697 |bibcode = 2004Sci...306..828P [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last = West-Eberhard |first = M-J. |year = 2003 |title = Developmental plasticity and evolution |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = New York |isbn = 978-0-19-512235-0 [/tpl]
Mutation bias effects are superimposed on other processes. If selection would favor either one out of two mutations, but there is no extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population.[tpl]cite journal |author = Stoltzfus, A and Yampolsky, L.Y. |year = 2009 |title = Climbing Mount Probable: Mutation as a Cause of Nonrandomness in Evolution |journal = J Hered |volume = 100 |pages = 637–647 |doi = 10.1093/jhered/esp048 |pmid = 19625453 |issue = 5 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author = Yampolsky, L.Y. and Stoltzfus, A |year = 2001 |title = Bias in the introduction of variation as an orienting factor in evolution |journal = Evol Dev |volume = 3 |pages = 73–83 |doi = 10.1046/j.1525-142x.2001.003002073.x |pmid = 11341676 |issue = 2 [/tpl] Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene. Most loss of function mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution.[tpl]cite journal |author = Haldane, JBS |year = 1933 |title = The Part Played by Recurrent Mutation in Evolution |journal = American Naturalist |volume = 67 |pages = 5–19 |jstor = 2457127 |doi = 10.1086/280465 |issue = 708 [/tpl] For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost.[tpl]cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.01.051 |pmid = 17306543 |volume = 17 |issue = 5 |pages = 452–454 |last = Protas |first = Meredith |title = Regressive evolution in the Mexican cave tetra, Astyanax mexicanus |journal = Current Biology |year = 2007 |last2 = Conrad |first2 = M |last3 = Gross |first3 = JB |last4 = Tabin |first4 = C |last5 = Borowsky |first5 = R |pmc = 2570642 |ref = harv [/tpl] This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in a bacterium during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability.[tpl]cite journal |author = Maughan H, Masel J, Birky WC, Nicholson WL |title = The roles of mutation accumulation and selection in loss of sporulation in experimental populations of Bacillus subtilis |doi = 10.1534/genetics.107.075663 |journal = Genetics |volume = 177 |pages = 937–948 |year = 2007 |issue = 2 |pmid = 17720926 |pmc = 2034656 [/tpl] When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size,[tpl]cite journal |author = Masel J, King OD, Maughan H |title = The loss of adaptive plasticity during long periods of environmental stasis |doi = 10.1086/510212 |journal = American Naturalist |volume = 169 |issue = 1 |pages = 38–46 |year = 2007 |pmid = 17206583 |pmc = 1766558 [/tpl] indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift.

===Genetic drift===

Genetic drift is the change in allele frequency from one generation to the next that occurs because alleles are subject to sampling error.[tpl]cite journal |volume = 21 |pages = R837–R838 |author = Masel J |title = Genetic drift |journal = Current Biology |year = 2011 |doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.007 |issue = 20 |pmid = 22032182 [/tpl] As a result, when selective forces are absent or relatively weak, allele frequencies tend to "drift" upward or downward randomly (in a random walk). This drift halts when an allele eventually becomes fixed, either by disappearing from the population, or replacing the other alleles entirely. Genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from a population due to chance alone. Even in the absence of selective forces, genetic drift can cause two separate populations that began with the same genetic structure to drift apart into two divergent populations with different sets of alleles.[tpl]cite journal |author = Lande R |title = Fisherian and Wrightian theories of speciation |journal = Genome |volume = 31 |issue = 1 |pages = 221–7 |year = 1989 |pmid = 2687093 |ref = harv |doi = 10.1139/g89-037 [/tpl]
It is usually difficult to measure the relative importance of selection and neutral processes, including drift.[tpl]cite journal |doi = 10.1038/nrg2207 |pmid = 17943192 |volume = 8 |issue = 11 |pages = 845–856 |last = Mitchell-Olds |first = Thomas |title = Which evolutionary processes influence natural genetic variation for phenotypic traits? |journal = Nature Reviews Genetics |year = 2007 |last2 = Willis |first2 = JH |last3 = Goldstein |first3 = DB |ref = harv [/tpl] The comparative importance of adaptive and non-adaptive forces in driving evolutionary change is an area of current research.[tpl]cite journal |author = Nei M |title = Selectionism and neutralism in molecular evolution |doi = 10.1093/molbev/msi242 |journal = Mol. Biol. Evol. |volume = 22 |issue = 12 |pages = 2318–42 |year = 2005 |pmid = 16120807 |pmc = 1513187 |ref = harv [/tpl]
The neutral theory of molecular evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes are the result of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift. Hence, in this model, most genetic changes in a population are the result of constant mutation pressure and genetic drift.[tpl]cite journal |author = Kimura M |title = The neutral theory of molecular evolution and the world view of the neutralists |journal = Genome |volume = 31 |issue = 1 |pages = 24–31 |year = 1989 |pmid = 2687096 |ref = harv |doi = 10.1139/g89-009 [/tpl] This form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned, since it does not seem to fit the genetic variation seen in nature.[tpl]cite journal |author = Kreitman M |title = The neutral theory is dead. Long live the neutral theory |journal = BioEssays |volume = 18 |issue = 8 |pages = 678–83; discussion 683 |year = 1996 |pmid = 8760341 |doi = 10.1002/bies.950180812 |ref = harv [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author = Leigh E.G. (Jr) |year = 2007 |title = Neutral theory: a historical perspective |journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology |pmid = 17956380 |volume = 20 |issue = 6 |pages = 2075–91 |doi = 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01410.x |ref = harv [/tpl] However, a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory, where a mutation that would be neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population. Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking, also known as genetic draft.[tpl]cite journal |volume = 55 |issue = 11 |pages = 2161–2169 |last = Gillespie |first = John H. |title = Is the population size of a species relevant to its evolution? |journal = Evolution |year = 2001 |pmid = 11794777 |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb00732.x[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |volume = 188 |pages = 975–996 |author = R.A.

The time for a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on population size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations.[tpl]cite journal |author = Otto S, Whitlock M |title = The probability of fixation in populations of changing size |journal = Genetics |volume = 146 |issue = 2 |pages = 723–33 |date = June 1, 1997 |pmid = 9178020 |pmc = 1208011 |ref = harv [/tpl] The number of individuals in a population is not critical, but instead a measure known as the effective population size.[tpl]cite journal |author = Charlesworth B |title = Fundamental concepts in genetics: Effective population size and patterns of molecular evolution and variation |journal = Nature Reviews Genetics  |volume = 10 |pages = 195–205 |year = 2009 |pmid = 19204717 |doi = 10.1038/nrg2526 |issue = 3 |ref = harv [/tpl] The effective population is usually smaller than the total population since it takes into account factors such as the level of inbreeding and the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.[tpl]cite journal |author = Asher D. Cutter and Jae Young Choi |title = Natural selection shapes nucleotide polymorphism across the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae |journal = Genome Research |volume = 20 |pages = 1103–1111 |year = 2010 |doi=10.1101/gr.104331.109 |pmid=20508143 |pmc=2909573 |issue = 8[/tpl]

===Genetic hitchhiking===

Recombination allows alleles on the same strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of recombination is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage.[tpl]cite journal |author = Lien S, Szyda J, Schechinger B, Rappold G, Arnheim N |title = Evidence for heterogeneity in recombination in the human pseudoautosomal region: high resolution analysis by sperm typing and radiation-hybrid mapping |journal = Am. J. Hum. Genet. |volume = 66 |issue = 2 |pages = 557–66 |year = 2000 |pmid = 10677316 |pmc = 1288109 |doi = 10.1086/302754 |ref = harv [/tpl] This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations, which is called their linkage disequilibrium. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft.[tpl]cite journal |doi = 10.1098/rstb.2000.0716 |pmid = 11127900 |volume = 355 |issue = 1403 |pages = 1553–1562 |last = Barton |first = N H |title = Genetic hitchhiking |journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |year = 2000 |pmc = 1692896 |ref = harv [/tpl] Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.

===Gene flow===

Gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations and between species. The presence or absence of gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due to the complexity of organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model, even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment.
If genetic differentiation between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in the local population and this may lead to organism within these populations to evolve mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important for the development of the biological species concept (BSC).
During the development of the modern synthesis, Sewall Wright's developed his shifting balance theory that gene flow between partially isolated populations was an important aspect of adaptive evolution.[tpl]cite journal |last1 = Wright |first1 = Sewall |year = 1932 |title = The roles of mutation, inbreeding, crossbreeding and selection in evolution |url = http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/wright.asp |journal = Proc. 6th Int. Cong. Genet |volume = 1 |issue = |pages = 356–366 [/tpl] However, recently there has been substantial criticism of the importance of the shifting balance theory.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Coyne | first1 = Jerry A. |author2=Barton, Turelli | title = Perspective: A Critique of Sewall Wright's Shifting Balance Theory of Evolution | journal = Evolution | year = 1997 | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | series = 3 | pages = 643–671 | doi = 10.2307/2411143 [/tpl]

==Outcomes==

Evolution influences every aspect of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by co-operating with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.
These outcomes of evolution are sometimes divided into macroevolution, which is evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, such as extinction and speciation and microevolution, which is smaller evolutionary changes, such as adaptations, within a species or population.[tpl]cite journal |author = Scott EC, Matzke NJ |title = Biological design in science classrooms |volume = 104 |journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |issue = suppl_1 |pages = 8669–76 |year = 2007 |pmid = 17494747 |pmc = 1876445 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0701505104 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.8669S [/tpl] In general, macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of microevolution.[tpl]cite journal |author = Hendry AP, Kinnison MT |title = An introduction to microevolution: rate, pattern, process |journal = Genetica |volume = 112–113 |pages = 1–8 |year = 2001 |pmid = 11838760 |doi = 10.1023/A:1013368628607 |ref = harv [/tpl] Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one – the difference is simply the time involved.[tpl]cite journal |author = Leroi AM |title = The scale independence of evolution |journal = Evol. Dev. |volume = 2 |issue = 2 |pages = 67–77 |year = 2000 |pmid = 11258392 |doi = 10.1046/j.1525-142x.2000.00044.x |ref = harv [/tpl] However, in macroevolution, the traits of the entire species may be important. For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels – with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as species selection acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.[tpl]sfn|Gould|2002|pp=657–658[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author = Gould SJ |title = Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |journal = Proc.

Scientific American July 20, 1998.TalkOrigins Archive response to Creationist claims – Claim CB932: Evolution of degenerate forms Although complex species have evolved, they occur as a side effect of the overall number of organisms increasing and simple forms of life still remain more common in the biosphere.[tpl]cite journal |author = Carroll SB |title = Chance and necessity: the evolution of morphological complexity and diversity |journal = Nature |volume = 409 |issue = 6823 |pages = 1102–9 |year = 2001 |pmid = 11234024 |doi = 10.1038/35059227 |ref = harv [/tpl] For example, the overwhelming majority of species are microscopic prokaryotes, which form about half the world's biomass despite their small size,[tpl]cite journal |author = Whitman W, Coleman D, Wiebe W |title = Prokaryotes: the unseen majority |doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.12.6578 |journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume = 95 |issue = 12 |pages = 6578–83 |year = 1998 |pmid = 9618454 |pmc = 33863 |ref = harv |bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.6578W [/tpl] and constitute the vast majority of Earth's biodiversity.[tpl]cite journal |author = Schloss P, Handelsman J |title = Status of the microbial census |journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev |volume = 68 |issue = 4 |pages = 686–91 |year = 2004 |pmid = 15590780 |pmc = 539005 |doi = 10.1128/MMBR.68.4.686-691.2004 |ref = harv [/tpl] Simple organisms have therefore been the dominant form of life on Earth throughout its history and continue to be the main form of life up to the present day, with complex life only appearing more diverse because it is more noticeable.[tpl]cite journal |author = Nealson K |title = Post-Viking microbiology: new approaches, new data, new insights |journal = Orig Life Evol Biosph |volume = 29 |issue = 1 |pages = 73–93 |year = 1999 |pmid = 11536899 |doi = 10.1023/A:1006515817767 |ref = harv [/tpl] Indeed, the evolution of microorganisms is particularly important to modern evolutionary research, since their rapid reproduction allows the study of experimental evolution and the observation of evolution and adaptation in real time.[tpl]cite journal |author = Buckling A, Craig Maclean R, Brockhurst MA, Colegrave N |title = The Beagle in a bottle |journal = Nature |volume = 457 |issue = 7231 |pages = 824–9 |year = 2009 |pmid = 19212400 |doi = 10.1038/nature07892 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2009Natur.457..824B [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author = Elena SF, Lenski RE |title = Evolution experiments with microorganisms: the dynamics and genetic bases of adaptation |journal = Nature Reviews Genetics  |volume = 4 |issue = 6 |pages = 457–69 |year = 2003 |pmid = 12776215 |doi = 10.1038/nrg1088 |ref = harv [/tpl]

===Adaptation===

Adaptation is the process that makes organisms better suited to their habitat.Mayr, Ernst 1982. The growth of biological thought. Harvard. p483: "Adaptation... could no longer be considered a static condition, a product of a creative past and became instead a continuing dynamic process."The Oxford Dictionary of Science defines adaptation as "Any change in the structure or functioning of an organism that makes it better suited to its environment". Also, the term adaptation may refer to a trait that is important for an organism's survival. For example, the adaptation of horses' teeth to the grinding of grass. By using the term adaptation for the evolutionary process and adaptive trait for the product (the bodily part or function), the two senses of the word may be distinguished. Adaptations are produced by natural selection.[tpl]cite journal |author = Orr H |title = The genetic theory of adaptation: a brief history |journal = Nature Reviews Genetics  |volume = 6 |issue = 2 |pages = 119–27 |year = 2005 |pmid = 15716908 |doi = 10.1038/nrg1523 |ref = harv [/tpl] The following definitions are due to Theodosius Dobzhansky.
Adaptation may cause either the gain of a new feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is bacterial adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying the target of the drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell.[tpl]cite journal |author = Nakajima A, Sugimoto Y, Yoneyama H, Nakae T |title = High-level fluoroquinolone resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa due to interplay of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump and the DNA gyrase mutation |journal = Microbiol.

Adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation may have different functions in related organisms. This is the result of a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within bat wings, for example, are very similar to those in mice feet and primate hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor.[tpl]cite journal |doi = 10.1554/05-233.1 |pmid = 16526515 |volume = 59 |issue = 12 |pages = 2691–704 |last = Young |first = Nathan M. |title = Serial homology and the evolution of mammalian limb covariation structure |journal = Evolution |year = 2005 |last2 = Hallgrímsson |first2 = B |ref = harv [/tpl] However, since all living organisms are related to some extent, even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as arthropod, squid and vertebrate eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates, can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function; this is called deep homology.[tpl]cite journal |doi = 10.1017/S1464793102006097 |pmid = 14558591 |volume = 78 |issue = 3 |pages = 409–433 |last = Hall |first = Brian K |title = Descent with modification: the unity underlying homology and homoplasy as seen through an analysis of development and evolution |journal = Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |year = 2003 |ref = harv [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi = 10.1038/nature07891 |pmid = 19212399 |volume = 457 |issue = 7231 |pages = 818–823 |last = Shubin |first = Neil |title = Deep homology and the origins of evolutionary novelty |journal = Nature |year = 2009 |last2 = Tabin |first2 = C |last3 = Carroll |first3 = S |ref = harv |bibcode = 2009Natur.457..818S [/tpl]

===Co-evolution===

Interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and co-operation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, such as a pathogen and a host, or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called co-evolution.[tpl]cite journal |author = Wade MJ |title = The co-evolutionary genetics of ecological communities |journal = Nature Reviews Genetics  |volume = 8 |issue = 3 |pages = 185–95 |year = 2007 |pmid = 17279094 |doi = 10.1038/nrg2031 |ref = harv [/tpl] An example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough-skinned newt and the evolution of tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the common garter snake.

For instance, an extreme cooperation exists between plants and the mycorrhizal fungi that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil.[tpl]cite journal |author = Paszkowski U |title = Mutualism and parasitism: the yin and yang of plant symbioses |journal = Current Opinion in Plant Biology |volume = 9 |issue = 4 |pages = 364–70 |year = 2006 |pmid = 16713732 |doi = 10.1016/j.pbi.2006.05.008 |ref = harv [/tpl] This is a reciprocal relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis. Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending signals that suppress the plant immune system.[tpl]cite journal |author = Hause B, Fester T |title = Molecular and cell biology of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis |journal = Planta |volume = 221 |issue = 2 |pages = 184–96 |year = 2005 |pmid = 15871030 |doi = 10.1007/s00425-004-1436-x |ref = harv [/tpl]
Coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved. An extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects, such as bees, termites and ants, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's germ cells to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth causes cancer.[tpl]cite journal |author = Bertram J |title = The molecular biology of cancer |journal = Mol. Aspects Med. |volume = 21 |issue = 6 |pages = 167–223 |year = 2000 |pmid = 11173079 |doi = 10.1016/S0098-2997(00)00007-8 |ref = harv [/tpl]

There are multiple ways to define the concept of "species". The choice of definition is dependent on the particularities of the species concerned.[tpl]cite journal |author = de Queiroz K |title = Ernst Mayr and the modern concept of species |journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume = 102 |issue = Suppl 1 |pages = 6600–7 |year = 2005 |pmid = 15851674 |pmc = 1131873 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0502030102 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6600D [/tpl] For example, some species concepts apply more readily toward sexually reproducing organisms while others lend themselves better toward asexual organisms. Despite the diversity of various species concepts, these various concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches: interbreeding, ecological and phylogenetic.[tpl]cite journal |doi = 10.1086/289701 |last = Ereshefsky |first = M. |title = Eliminative pluralism |journal = Philosophy of Science |volume = 59 |issue = 4 |pages = 671–690 |year = 1992 |jstor = 188136 [/tpl] The biological species concept (BSC) is a classic example of the interbreeding approach. Defined by Ernst Mayr in 1942, the BSC states that "species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups".[tpl]cite book |author = Mayr, E. |title = Systematics and the Origin of Species |year = 1942 |publisher = Columbia Univ. Press |place = New York |isbn = 978-0-231-05449-2 | page = 120 [/tpl] Despite its wide and long-term use, the BSC like others is not without controversy, for example because these concepts cannot be applied to prokaryotes,[tpl]cite journal |author = Fraser C, Alm EJ, Polz MF, Spratt BG, Hanage WP |title = The bacterial species challenge: making sense of genetic and ecological diversity |journal = Science |volume = 323 |issue = 5915 |pages = 741–6 |year = 2009 |pmid = 19197054 |doi = 10.1126/science.1159388 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2009Sci...323..741F [/tpl] and this is called the species problem. Some researchers have attempted a unifying monistic definition of species, while others adopt a pluralistic approach and suggest that there may be different ways to logically interpret the definition of a species. "
Barriers to reproduction between two diverging sexual populations are required for the populations to become new species. Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations. Depending on how far two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor, it may still be possible for them to produce offspring, as with horses and donkeys mating to produce mules.[tpl]cite journal |author = Short RV |title = The contribution of the mule to scientific thought |journal = J. Reprod. Fertil. Suppl. |issue = 23 |pages = 359–64 |year = 1975 |pmid = 1107543 |ref = harv [/tpl] Such hybrids are generally infertile. In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct. However, viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent species, or possess a totally new phenotype.[tpl]cite journal |author = Gross B, Rieseberg L |title = The ecological genetics of homoploid hybrid speciation |doi = 10.1093/jhered/esi026 |journal = J.

There are four mechanisms for speciation. The most common in animals is allopatric speciation, which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by habitat fragmentation or migration. Selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms.[tpl]cite journal |year = 2008 |title = Rapid large-scale evolutionary divergence in morphology and performance associated with exploitation of a different dietary resource |journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume = 105 |issue = 12 |pages = 4792–5 |pmid = 18344323 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0711998105 |author = Herrel, A.; Huyghe, K.; Vanhooydonck, B.; Backeljau, T.; Breugelmans, K.; Grbac, I.; Van Damme, R.; Irschick, D.J. |pmc = 2290806 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.4792H [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |year = 1997 |title = Adaptive differentiation following experimental island colonization in Anolis lizards |journal = Nature |volume = 387 |issue = 6628 |pages = 70–3 |doi = 10.1038/387070a0 |author = Losos, J.B. Warhelt, K.I. Schoener, T.W. |ref = harv |bibcode = 1997Natur.387...70L [/tpl] As selection and drift act independently on populations isolated from the rest of their species, separation may eventually produce organisms that cannot interbreed.[tpl]cite journal |author = Hoskin CJ, Higgle M, McDonald KR, Moritz C |year = 2005 |title = Reinforcement drives rapid allopatric speciation |journal = Nature |pmid = 16251964 |volume = 437 |issue = 7063 |pages = 1353–356 |doi = 10.1038/nature04004 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2005Natur.437.1353H [/tpl]
The second mechanism of speciation is peripatric speciation, which occurs when small populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment. This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental population. Here, the founder effect causes rapid speciation after an increase in inbreeding increases selection on homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.[tpl]cite journal |author = Templeton AR |title = The theory of speciation via the founder principle |url = http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/94/4/1011 |journal = Genetics |volume = 94 |issue = 4 |pages = 1011–38 |date = April 1, 1980 |pmid = 6777243 |pmc = 1214177 |ref = harv [/tpl]
The third mechanism of speciation is parapatric speciation. This is similar to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in that there is no physical separation between these two populations. Instead, speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations. Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat. One example is the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum, which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localised metal pollution from mines.[tpl]cite journal |author = Antonovics J |title = Evolution in closely adjacent plant populations X: long-term persistence of prereproductive isolation at a mine boundary |journal = Heredity |volume = 97 |issue = 1 |pages = 33–7 |year = 2006 |pmid = 16639420 |url = http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v97/n1/full/6800835a.html |doi = 10.1038/sj.hdy.6800835 |ref = harv [/tpl] Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil. Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation. Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause reinforcement, which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as character displacement, which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.[tpl]cite journal |author = Nosil P, Crespi B, Gries R, Gries G |title = Natural selection and divergence in mate preference during speciation |journal = Genetica |volume = 129 |issue = 3 |pages = 309–27 |year = 2007 |pmid = 16900317 |doi = 10.1007/s10709-006-0013-6 |ref = harv [/tpl]
Finally, in sympatric speciation species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat. This form is rare since even a small amount of gene flow may remove genetic differences between parts of a population.[tpl]cite journal |author = Savolainen V, Anstett M-C, Lexer C, Hutton I, Clarkson JJ, Norup MV, Powell MP, Springate D, Salamin N, Baker WJr |year = 2006 |title = Sympatric speciation in palms on an oceanic island |journal = Nature |volume = 441 |pages = 210–3 |pmid = 16467788 |doi = 10.1038/nature04566 |issue = 7090 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2006Natur.441..210S [/tpl] *[tpl]cite journal |author = Barluenga M, Stölting KN, Salzburger W, Muschick M, Meyer A |year = 2006 |title = Sympatric speciation in Nicaraguan crater lake cichlid fish |journal = Nature |volume = 439 |pages = 719–23 |pmid = 16467837 |doi = 10.1038/nature04325 |issue = 7077 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2006Natur.439..719B [/tpl] Generally, sympatric speciation in animals requires the evolution of both genetic differences and non-random mating, to allow reproductive isolation to evolve.[tpl]cite journal |author = Gavrilets S |title = The Maynard Smith model of sympatric speciation |journal = J.

One type of sympatric speciation involves cross-breeding of two related species to produce a new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during meiosis the homologous chromosomes from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it is more common in plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form polyploids.[tpl]cite journal |author = Wood TE, Takebayashi N, Barker MS, Mayrose I, Greenspoon PB, Rieseberg LH |title = The frequency of polyploid speciation in vascular plants |journal = Proc.

Speciation events are important in the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short "bursts" of evolution interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis, where species remain relatively unchanged.Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould, 1972. "Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism" In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., Models in Paleobiology. San Francisco: Freeman Cooper. pp. 82–115. Reprinted in N. Eldredge Time frames. Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press. 1985 In this theory, speciation and rapid evolution are linked, with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations. As a result, the periods of stasis in the fossil record correspond to the parental population and the organisms undergoing speciation and rapid evolution are found in small populations or geographically restricted habitats and therefore rarely being preserved as fossils.[tpl]cite journal |author = Gould SJ |title = Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |doi = 10.1073/pnas.91.15.6764 |journal = Proc.

===Extinction===

Extinction is the disappearance of an entire species. Extinction is not an unusual event, as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction.[tpl]cite journal |author = Benton MJ |title = Diversification and extinction in the history of life |journal = Science |volume = 268 |issue = 5207 |pages = 52–8 |year = 1995 |pmid = 7701342 |doi = 10.1126/science.7701342 |ref = harv |bibcode = 1995Sci...268...52B [/tpl] Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on Earth are now extinct,[tpl]cite journal |author = Raup DM |title = Biological extinction in Earth history |journal = Science |volume = 231 |issue = 4745 |pages = 1528–33 |year = 1986 |pmid = 11542058 |doi = 10.1126/science.11542058 |ref = harv |bibcode = 1986Sci...231.1528R [/tpl] and extinction appears to be the ultimate fate of all species.[tpl]cite journal |author = Avise JC, Hubbell SP, Ayala FJ. |title = In the light of evolution II: Biodiversity and extinction |journal = Proc.

The Holocene extinction event is an ongoing mass extinction associated with humanity's expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years. Present-day extinction rates are 100–1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30% of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century.[tpl]cite journal |author = Novacek MJ, Cleland EE |title = The current biodiversity extinction event: scenarios for mitigation and recovery |doi = 10.1073/pnas.091093698 |journal = Proc.

The role of extinction in evolution is not very well understood and may depend on which type of extinction is considered. The causes of the continuous "low-level" extinction events, which form the majority of extinctions, may be the result of competition between species for limited resources (competitive exclusion). If one species can out-compete another, this could produce species selection, with the fitter species surviving and the other species being driven to extinction. The intermittent mass extinctions are also important, but instead of acting as a selective force, they drastically reduce diversity in a nonspecific manner and promote bursts of rapid evolution and speciation in survivors.[tpl]cite journal |author = Jablonski D |title = Lessons from the past: evolutionary impacts of mass extinctions |journal = Proc.

Second, the diversity of life is not a set of completely unique organisms, but organisms that share morphological similarities. Third, vestigial traits with no clear purpose resemble functional ancestral traits and finally, that organisms can be classified using these similarities into a hierarchy of nested groups – similar to a family tree.[tpl]cite book |last = Darwin |first = Charles |authorlink = Charles Darwin |year = 1859 |title = On the Origin of Species |place = London |publisher = John Murray |edition = 1st |page = 1 |url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=16 |isbn = 0-8014-1319-2 [/tpl] However, modern research has suggested that, due to horizontal gene transfer, this "tree of life" may be more complicated than a simple branching tree since some genes have spread independently between distantly related species.[tpl]cite journal |author = Doolittle WF, Bapteste E |title = Pattern pluralism and the Tree of Life hypothesis |journal = Proc.

However, this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Further, as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry.

==Applications==

Artificial selection is the intentional selection of traits in a population of organisms. This has been used for thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals.[tpl]cite journal |author = Doebley JF, Gaut BS, Smith BD |title = The molecular genetics of crop domestication |journal = Cell |volume = 127 |issue = 7 |pages = 1309–21 |year = 2006 |pmid = 17190597 |doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.12.006 |ref = harv [/tpl] More recently, such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering, with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called directed evolution.[tpl]cite journal |author = Jäckel C, Kast P, Hilvert D |title = Protein design by directed evolution |journal = Annu Rev Biophys |volume = 37 |issue = 1 |pages = 153–73 |year = 2008 |pmid = 18573077 |doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832 |ref = harv [/tpl]

==Social and cultural responses==

In the 19th century, particularly after the publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859, the idea that life had evolved was an active source of academic debate centred on the philosophical, social and religious implications of evolution. Today, the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast majority of scientists. However, evolution remains a contentious concept for some theists.For an overview of the philosophical, religious and cosmological controversies, see: [tpl]cite book |authorlink = Daniel Dennett |last = Dennett |first = D |title = Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life |publisher = Simon & Schuster |year = 1995 |isbn = 978-0-684-82471-0 [/tpl] *For the scientific and social reception of evolution in the 19th and early 20th centuries, see: [tpl]cite web |last = Johnston |first = Ian C. |title = History of Science: Origins of Evolutionary Theory |work = And Still We Evolve |publisher = Liberal Studies Department, Malaspina University College |url = http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/darwin/sect3.htm |accessdate = May 24, 2007 [/tpl] *[tpl]cite book |authorlink = Peter J.

The teaching of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon in most of the first half of the 20th century. The Scopes Trial decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced later and became legally protected with the 1968 Epperson v. Arkansas decision. Since then, the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in pseudoscientific form as intelligent design, to be excluded once again in the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District case.[tpl]cite journal |last = Branch |first = Glenn |title = Understanding Creationism after Kitzmiller |journal = BioScience |date = March 2007 |volume = 57 |issue = 3 |pages = 278–284 |doi = 10.1641/B570313 |publisher = American Institute of Biological Sciences [/tpl]
