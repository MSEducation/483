CATEGORIES: Disused railway stations in Camden

Haverstock Hill railway station was opened by the Midland Railway in 1868 when it built its extension to St Pancras station. It lay between Belsize Tunnels and Lismore Circus, and served Haverstock Hill, Belsize Park and Gospel Oak, London.  
For a short period from 1878 and 1880, the MR operated the Super Outer Circle service through the station from St. Pancras to Earl's Court Underground station via tracks through Cricklewood, then using the Dudding Hill Line to South Acton and Hammersmith.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/circle.html#history |title=Circle Line, History |work=Clive's Underground Line Guides |accessdate=2008-02-13 [/tpl] 
The station was closed, as were others, in 1916 as a wartime economy measure, and was not re-opened.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books Some remnants of the platforms remain beside the track.
