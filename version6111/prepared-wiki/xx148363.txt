Sri Petaling LRT station is a LRT station in Sri Petaling, a suburb about 20Â km south of Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. The original name was Komanwel LRT station, where "Komanwel" is the Malay spelling for "Commonwealth".
The station is on the Sri Petaling Line and is the southern terminus for passenger services on the line. 
Sri Petaling LRT station was opened in 1998, along with 17 other stations, which at that time formed Star LRT Phase 2. It was then renamed Sri Petaling Line to avoid confusion from names that differ only in the phase number.
Vista Komanwel (also known as Vista Commonwealth) condominium (formerly used as 1998 Commonwealth Games Athletes Village) is within walking distance to this station.
