==History==

Wu worked at Wind Music, but found her duties unfulfilling. Wind Music founder Ken Yang encouraged Wu to observe and discover sounds in the Taiwanese wilderness, which she did, and began to preserve the sounds of nature by making audio recordings.
Early in her career, Wu helped distribute international bestselling albums such as Bleeding Wolves into Taiwan. In recent years, she has been involved in the revival of instrumental folk music. Her collaboration with ocarina artist You Xue-Zhi created interest in the instrument.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
