Beautiful Sin is a European power metal band. They are heavily influenced by the popular power metal band Helloween. 
Beautiful Sin began when Uli Kusch met a Belgian singer called Magali Luyten, and wanted to record an album with her band. He agreed to produce a demo-CD for the band, but the recordings were never released.
A few years later, Uli was considering creating a new project next to Masterplan in which he would write all the music himself. In autumn of 2004 he began talking to Magali once again – this time about forming a band together.
Rounding out the rest of the line-up would be Pagan's Mind's Jørn Viggo Lofstad and Steinar Krokmo (coming from Uli's adopted home, Norway), and also Kusch's Masterplan-mate, Axel Mackenrott.
After the release of The Unexpected, Carl Johan Grimmark was added as a second guitarist.
