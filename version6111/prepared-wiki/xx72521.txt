[[Cauchy–Binet formula]]

CATEGORIES: Determinants

In linear algebra, the Cauchy–Binet formula, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Jacques Philippe Marie Binet, is an identity for the determinant of the product of two rectangular matrices of transpose shapes (so that the product is well-defined and square). It generalizes the statement that the determinant of a product of square matrices is equal to the product of their determinants. The formula is valid for matrices with entries from any commutative ring.

==Statement==

==Special cases==

==Proof==

There are various kinds of proofs that can be given for the Cauchy−Binet formula. The proof below is based on formal manipulations only, and avoids using any particular interpretation of determinants, which may be taken to be defined by the Leibniz formula. Only their multilinearity with respect to rows and columns, and their alternating property (vanishing in the presence of equal rows or columns) are used; in particular the multiplicative property of determinants for square matrices is not used, but is rather established (the case n = m). The proof is valid for arbitrary commutative coefficient rings.
The formula can be proved in two steps:
For step 1, observe that for each row of A or column of B, and for each m-combination S, the values of det(AB) and det(Am,S)det(BS,m) indeed depend linearly on the row or column. For the latter this is immediate from the multilinear property of the determinant; for the former one must in addition check that taking a linear combination for the row of A or column of B while leaving the rest unchanged only affects the corresponding row or column of the product AB, and by the same linear combination. Thus one can work out both sides of the Cauchy−Binet formula by linearity for every row of A and then also every column of B, writing each of the rows and columns as a linear combination of standard basis vectors. The resulting multiple summations are huge, but they have the same form for both sides: corresponding terms involve the same scalar factor (each is a product of entries of A and of B), and these terms only differ by involving two different expressions in terms of constant matrices of the kind described above, which expressions should be equal according to the Cauchy−Binet formula. This achieves the reduction of the first step.
Concretely, the multiple summations can be grouped into two summations, one over all functions f:m → n that for each row index of A gives a corresponding column index, and one over all functions g:m → n that for each column index of B gives a corresponding row index. The matrices associated to f and g are
Using multi-linearity with respect to both the rows of A and the columns of B in the proof is not necessary; one could use just one of them, say the former, and use that a matrix product LfB either consists of a permutation of the rows of Bf(m),m (if f is injective), or has at least two equal rows.

==Relation to the generalized Kronecker delta==

As we have seen, the Cauchy–Binet formula is equivalent to the following:
where 
In terms of generalized Kronecker delta, we can derive the formula equivalent to the Cauchy–Binet formula:

==Geometric interpretations==

In the case m = 1 the parallelotope is reduced to a single vector and its volume its length. The above statement then states that the square of the length of a vector is the sum of the squares of its coordinates; this is indeed the case by the definition of that length, which is based on the Pythagorean theorem.

==Generalization==

The Cauchy–Binet formula can be extended in a straightforward way to a general formula for the minors of the product of two matrices. That formula is given in the article on minors.
