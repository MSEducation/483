[[Air trapping]]

CATEGORIES: Respiratory diseases

Air trapping, also called gas trapping, is an abnormal retention of air in the lungs where it is difficult to exhale completely.U. Joseph Schoepf; "6.4.9.5 Expiratory Hyperinflation - Air Trapping", Multidetector-Row CT of the Thorax Birkh√§user, 2005, p.101  It is observed in obstructive lung diseases such as asthma, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. 
Air trapping is not a diagnosis but is a presentation of an illness and can be used to find an appropriate diagnosis.

==Measurement and Function==

Exhaled volumes are measured by a pulmonary function test or simple spirometry, leading to an elevated residual volume and a measurement of forced expiratory volume. Air trapping is often incidentally diagnosed on computed tomography (CT) scanning.  On expiratory films, retained hyperlucent gas will be visualised in cases of air trapping.Javier Luca ya; A. L. Baert; Janet L. Strife; "4.6.5 Air Trapping", Pediatric Chest Imaging: Chest Imaging in Infants and Children, Springer, 2007, p. 92
Air trapping represents poorly aerated lung, but on its own is clinically benign. It is a common problem for smokers who dive. On diving the lung volume collapses and pushes air into the poorly aerated regions. On arising from a deep depth, these air-trapped areas of lung expand. This places great pressure on the lung tissue which can rupture.Johny A. Verschakelen; W. De Weber; "5.2.2 Air Trapping", Computed Tomography of the Lung: A Pattern Approach, Springer, 2007, p. 51
