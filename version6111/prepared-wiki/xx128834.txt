Having been a youth signing with hometown club Kilmarnock, McLean began his professional career when he moved south to join Sunderland in July 2002. The nearest he came to playing in the Sunderland first team was on the last day of the 2003–04 season when he was an unused substitute at Burnley. At the start of the following season he was still with Sunderland and had been allocated a squad number, but having slipped down to fifth choice goalkeeper he was released shortly after the season began. 
McLean signed for Dundee United in September 2004 and was initially third choice goalkeeper at he club. By the beginning of the 2006–07 season, he was installed as the regular backup to Derek Stillie, and had been named on the bench for United on numerous occasions. He was given his senior debut by manager Craig Brewster in October 2006, along with several youngsters, in an away SPL match at Falkirk.
