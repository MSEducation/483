==History==

Rogers had made several attempts to launch a multicultural station in Vancouver similar to its successful CFMT in Toronto. Unsuccessful applications to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) were made in 1996Decision CRTC 97-39, 31 January 1997 - CIVT (now a CTV station) was licensed instead. and again in 1999.Decision CRTC 2000-219, 6 July 2000 - CIVI (now a CTV Two station) and CHNU (now a Joytv station) were licensed.

Asked by the federal cabinet to pursue the matter further, in 2002, the commission asked for new applications for a Vancouver multicultural station and received two â€“ from Rogers and Multivan Broadcast, a newly formed consortium of local investors. The licence went to Multivan, with the CRTC citing its local ownership as one of the reasons for the decision.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2002-39, 14 February 2002 The station went on the air on June 27, 2003 from studios at the intersection of Pender and Columbia Streets in Vancouver's Chinatown under the name "channel m". 
Following a failed 2007 bid for the multicultural licences in Calgary and Edmonton, which were won by Rogers, Multivan announced an agreement to sell channel m to Rogers in July of that year. The sale was approved by the CRTC on March 31, 2008,CRTC Decision 2008-72CRTC Approves Rogers Acquisition of channel m and was finalized on April 30, 2008. With Rogers' recent acquisition of Citytv station CKVU-TV and the resulting sale of religious station CHNU-TV (formerly branded as "Omni.10") to S-VOX, the Omni Television brand moved to CHNM on September 1, 2008.
CHNM moved into sister station CKVU's studio facilities at 180 West 2nd Avenue (near the Vancouver Olympic Village) on September 7, 2010. CHNM won its first-ever Jack Webster Foundation Award for Excellence in Chinese Language Reporting, for a multi-part feature on the topic of earthquake preparedness.
