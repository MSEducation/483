[[Blaby Special (Tomato)]]

CATEGORIES: Tomato cultivars

The Blaby special cultivar is a red fruited tomato grown in the village of Blaby in Leicestershire until just after World War II. It was the main tomato cultivar supplied through England during the war. The cultivar ceased to be cultivated when the Shoults' Tomato Farm was closed after the war. The cultivar was brought back into cultivation in 2006 as a result of a campaign by Dr Russell Sharp of Lancaster University. It may have resulted from either a mutation or cross-breed of an older cultivar known as Anwell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Bid-revive-town-s-special-tomato-bears-fruit/story-12080665-detail/story.html |title=They were the pride and joy of Blaby â€“ before they were wiped out in the 1940s. |publisher=This is Leicestershire |date=2010-08-16 |accessdate=2013-06-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.growfruitandveg.co.uk/grapevine/seed-swap/blaby-special-tomato_4495.html |title=Blaby special tomato |publisher=Growfruitandveg.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-24[/tpl]http://www.wikio.co.uk/uk/england/east_midlands/leicestershire/blabyLeicester Mercury 16 August 2010, Scientist puts Blaby Special tomatoes back on the menu.
