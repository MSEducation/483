[[Linear interpolation]]

CATEGORIES: Interpolation

In mathematics, linear interpolation is a method of curve fitting using linear polynomials.

which can be derived geometrically from the figure on the right. It is a special case of polynomial interpolation with n = 1.
Solving this equation for y, which is the unknown value at x, gives

==Linear interpolation as approximation==

Linear interpolation is often used to approximate a value of some function f using two known values of that function at other points. The error of this approximation is defined as
where p denotes the linear interpolation polynomial defined above
It can be proven using Rolle's theorem that if f has a continuous second derivative, the error is bounded by
As you see, the approximation between two points on a given function gets worse with the second derivative of the function that is approximated. This is intuitively correct as well: the "curvier" the function is, the worse the approximations made with simple linear interpolation.

==Applications==

Linear interpolation is often used to fill the gaps in a table. Suppose that one has a table listing the population of some country in 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000, and that one wanted to estimate the population in 1994. Linear interpolation is an easy way to do this.
The basic operation of linear interpolation between two values is so commonly used in computer graphics that it is  sometimes called a lerp in that field's jargon. The term can be used as a verb or noun for the operation. e.g. "Bresenham's algorithm lerps incrementally between the two endpoints of the line."
Lerp operations are built into the hardware of all modern computer graphics processors. They are often used as building blocks for more complex operations: for example, a bilinear interpolation can be accomplished in three lerps. Because this operation is cheap, it's also a good way to implement accurate lookup tables with quick lookup for smooth functions without having too many table entries.

==Extensions==

===Accuracy===

If a C0 function is insufficient, for example if the process that has produced the data points is known be smoother than C0, it is common to replace linear interpolation with spline interpolation, or even polynomial interpolation in some cases.

===Multivariate===

Linear interpolation as described here is for data points in one spatial dimension. For two spatial dimensions, the extension of linear interpolation is called bilinear interpolation, and in three dimensions, trilinear interpolation. Notice, though, that these interpolants are no longer linear functions of the spatial coordinates, rather products of linear functions; this is illustrated by the clearly non-linear example of bilinear interpolation in the figure below. Other extensions of linear interpolation can be applied to other kinds of mesh such as triangular and tetrahedral meshes, including Bézier surfaces. These may be defined as indeed higher-dimensional piecewise linear function (see second figure below).

==History==

Linear interpolation has been used since antiquity for filling the gaps in tables, often with astronomical data. It is believed that it was used by Babylonian astronomers and mathematicians in Seleucid Mesopotamia (last three centuries BC), and by the Greek astronomer and mathematician, Hipparchus (2nd century BC). A description of linear interpolation can be found in the Almagest (2nd century AD) by Ptolemy.

==Programming language support==

Many libraries and shading languages have a 'lerp' helper-function, returning an interpolation between two inputs (v0,v1) for a parameter (t) in the closed unit interval 0,1:
This function is used for alpha blending (the parameter 't' is the 'alpha value'), and the formula may be extended to blend multiple components of a vector (such as spatial x,y,z axes, or r,g,b colour components) in parallel.
