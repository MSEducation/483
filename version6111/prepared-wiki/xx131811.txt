This Is My Country is an album by soul group The Impressions. It was their first album released on member Curtis Mayfield's label Curtom Records, originally in 1968.
Despite the Impressions' late '60s work being known for their social or inspirational viewpoint, such as the title track and "They Don't Know", the rest of the songs feature Mayfield's soul-based love songs. This was their first album which had the Impressions harmonizing less than previous releases, and letting Mayfield take the main vocal point.
