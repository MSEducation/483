[[Maevia]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae, Spider genera

Maevia is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders).
Maevia appears to have been a large blanket genus in its beginnings, with not closely related species from the New World and the region from India to the Moluccas being lumped there. As the type species is from North America, those that occur in the New World were left in the genus, with most others transferred to other genera. However, several species exist in Asia for which there has been no information since their description, often more than a hundred years ago, so transferring them to other genera proves difficult.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 270
