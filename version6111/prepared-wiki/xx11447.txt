CATEGORIES: Demographics of Venezuela, Demographics of South America

The Demographics of Venezuela are the condition and overview of Venezuela's peoples. Demographic topics include basic education, health, and population statistics as well as identified racial and religious affiliations.

==Overview==

The Venezuelan people comprise a combination of heritages. The historically present Amerindians, Spanish colonists, and African slaves have all contributed to varying degrees. Later, waves of European groups (Italians, Portuguese and Germans) migrated to Venezuela in the 20th century, influencing many aspects of Venezuelan life, including its culture, language, food, and music.
According to most sources, about half of the population is of racially mixed origin; Mestizos (European/Amerindian), Mulattos (European/African) and Zambos (Amerindian/African). Around one-fifth is said to be of European ancestry, and one-tenth African. The remaining Amerindian population is statistically small.Britannica Three Amerindian tribes located in the country are the Wayuu, located in the west, in Zulia State, and the Timoto-cuicas, also in the west, in Mérida State, in the Andes.
About 85% of the population live in urban areas in the northern portion of the country and currently resides in the urban conglomerations (Caracas, Maracay, Maracaibo, Valencia, etc.) that are concentrated in Venezuela's northern coastal mountain strip. Nearly half of Venezuela's geographic area lies south of the Orinoco River; however, this region contains only 5% of the Venezuelan population.
The World Factbook 2011 estimate puts Venezuela's total population at 27,635,743 inhabitants.Venezuela World Fact Book. CIA Additionally, over the past five years, Venezuelan society's general age structure has been trending towards the homologous structure found in Cuba, Western Europe, Japan, and other healthy and rapidly aging societies. Notably, there has been a significant increase in the proportion and gross numbers of elderly Venezuelans (aged 65 and up), as well as a corresponding drop in the total fertility.

==Population==

According to the 2010 revison of the World Population Prospects the total population was 28,980,000 in 2010, compared to only 5,094,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 29.5%, 64.9% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 5.6% was 65 years or older

==CIA World Factbook demographic statistics==

The following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.

===Total population===

===Population growth rate===

===Sex ratio===

===Literacy and education===

The accepted formal and demographic definition of the literacy rate is that proportion or percentage of the Venezuelan population older than age 15 that can both read and write. The below are 2006 estimates from the INE.

===Ethnicity===

According to an autosomal DNA genetic study conducted in 2008 by the University of Brasilia (UNB) the composition of Venezuela's population is:  60.60% of European contribution, 23% of Amerindian contribution and 16,30% of African contribution.[tpl]cite web|last=Godinho|first=Neide Maria de Oliveira|title=O impacto das migrações na constituição genética de populações latino-americanas|url=http://bdtd.bce.unb.br/tedesimplificado/tde_busca/arquivo.php?codArquivo=3873|publisher=Universidade de Brasília|accessdate=1 August 2012|year=2008[/tpl]

===Religious affiliation===

The overwhelming majority of Venezuelans denote themselves as adherents of Catholicism; this is true nominally if not in practice.
Alternatively, according to government estimates, 92% of the population is at least nominally Roman Catholic, and the remaining 8% are Protestant, a member of another religion, or non-religious. The Venezuelan Evangelical Council estimates that Evangelical Protestants constitute 10% of the population.International Religious Freedom Report 2008: Venezuela.
