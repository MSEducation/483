Stade du Rhône is an athletics stadium located in the Parc de Parilly in the commune of Venissieux in Lyon, France.

==History==

The Stadium was initially built as the Parilly Stadium, but it was renamed Stade du Rhône in 2012 after a major renovation in preparation for the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships. The newly development was inaugurated on 3 September 2012 and the main grandstand was named Tribune Tony Bertrand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leprogres.fr/rhone/2012/08/30/le-stade-de-parilly-rebaptise-stade-du-rhone|title=Parilly stadium renamed "stage of the Rhone"|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=9 August 2013|publisher=leprogres.fr|language=French[/tpl]
