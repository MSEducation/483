[[Nereis vexillosa]]

CATEGORIES: Polychaetes, Animals described in 1851

Nereis vexillosa belongs to the phylum Annelida, a group known as the segmented worms. It is generally iridescent green and can reach 30 cm in length. It can be distinguished by the size of the upper ligules on the notopodia of the posterior region of the body. The upper ligules are much larger than the lower ligules. It is also without a collar-like structure around the peristomium.KOZLOFF, E. 1996. Marine invertebrates of the Pacific Northwest, Univ. Wash. Press ISBN 0-295-97562-8

==Habitat==

Sand or rocks in intertidal and shallow marine waters.

==Range==

Pacific Ocean from eastern Siberia to western North America as far south as Santa Barbara, California.
also found in southern africa.....

==Behavior==

Nereis vexillosa is often found in burrows in the sand or in association with mussels and barnacles. Although it has an eversible proboscis that it uses for prey capture, N. vexillosa also feeds on algae which it attaches to the opening of its burrow. The algae also serve to regulate temperature, moisture and salinity during low tide.WOODIN, S.A. 1977. Algal “gardening” behavior by nereid polychaetes: Effects on soft-bottom community structure. Marine Biology, 44:39-42.

==Reproduction==

At sexual maturity, N. vexillosa’s body is transformed into a heteronereid or epitoke. This body form is full of gametes and its sole purpose is reproduction. Epitokous worms leave their burrows and enter the water column in spawning swarms. This spawning activity marks the end of the organism’s life cycle.JOHNSON, M. W. 1943. Studies on the life history of the marine annelid Nereis vexillosa. Biological Bulletin, 84:106-114.

==Importance==

Nereis vexillosa is an important food item for foraging birds in the intertidal zone.[ref]WOOTTON , J. T. 1997. Estimates and tests of per capita interaction strength: Diet, abundance, and impact of intertidally foraging birds. Ecological Monographs, 67:45-64.
