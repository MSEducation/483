</ref>  Consequently, the secret reconnaissance flights of this aircraft were the first active service missions of the Mosquito. In 1944, the journal ''[[Flight International|Flight]]''<ref>
</ref> gave 19 September 1941 as date of the first PR mission, at an altitude "of some 20 000 ft."
On 15 November 1941, 105 Squadron, RAF, took delivery of the first operational Mosquito Mk. B.IV bomber, serial no. W4064.Scott 1999, p. 6. Throughout 1942, 105 Sdn., based at RAF Horsham St. Faith, then from 29 September, RAF Marham, undertook daylight low-level and shallow dive attacks.  Apart from the famous Oslo raid, these were mainly on industrial targets in occupied Netherlands, plus northern and western Germany.Scott 1999, p. v – Foreword by Air Marshal Sir Ivor Broom The crews faced deadly flak and fighters, particularly FW 190’s, which they called “snappers.”  Germany still controlled Continental airspace, and the FW 190’s were often already airborne and at an advantageous altitude.  It was the Mosquito’s excellent handling capabilities, rather than pure speed, that facilitated those evasions that were successful.Scott, 1999, pp 25, 32 – 33, 37 – 38 During this daylight-raiding phase, aircrew losses were high – even the losses incurred in the squadron’s dangerous Blenheim era were exceeded in percentage terms.  The Roll of Honour shows 51 aircrew deaths from the end of May 1942 to April 1943.Scott, 1999, pp 197 - 200  In the corresponding period, crews gained three Mentions in Despatches, two DFM’s and three DFC’s.
The Mosquito was first announced publicly on 26 September 1942 after the Oslo Mosquito raid of 25 September.  It was featured in The Times on the 28 September, and the next day the newspaper published two captioned photographs illustrating the bomb strikes and damage.[ref]

Mosquitos were widely used by the RAF Pathfinder Force, marking targets for the main night-time strategic bombing force, as well as flying "nuisance raids" in which Mosquitos often dropped 4,000 lb "Cookies". Despite an initially high loss rate, the Mosquito ended the war with the lowest losses of any aircraft in RAF Bomber Command service. Post war, the RAF found that when finally applied to bombing, in terms of useful damage done, the Mosquito had proved 4.95 times cheaper than the Lancaster.AVIA 46/116 De Haviland Mosquito papers, 1939–1945. In April 1943, in response to "political humiliation" caused by the Mosquito, Hermann Göring ordered the formation of special Luftwaffe units (Jagdgeschwader 25, commanded by Oberstleutnant Herbert Ihlefeld and Jagdgeschwader 50, under Major Hermann Graf) to combat the Mosquito attacks, though these units, which were "little more than glorified squadrons", were not very successful against the elusive RAF aircraft.Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 79.
In one example of the daylight precision raids carried out by the Mosquito, on 20 January 1943, the 10th anniversary of the Nazis' seizure of power, a Mosquito attack knocked out the main Berlin broadcasting station while Commander in Chief Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring was speaking, putting his speech off air.Simons 2011, p. 160. Göring himself had strong views about the Mosquito, lecturing a group of German aircraft manufacturers in 1943 that:
In 1940 I could at least fly as far as Glasgow in most of my aircraft, but not now! It makes me furious when I see the Mosquito. I turn green and yellow with envy. The British, who can afford aluminium better than we can, knock together a beautiful wooden aircraft that every piano factory over there is building, and they give it a speed which they have now increased yet again. What do you make of that? There is nothing the British do not have. They have the geniuses and we have the nincompoops. After the war is over I'm going to buy a British radio set - then at least I'll own something that has always worked. "Boog et al. 2006, p. 407.
The Mosquito also proved a very capable night fighter. Some of the most successful RAF pilots flew the Mosquito. Bob Braham claimed around a third of his 29 kills in a Mosquito, flying mostly daytime operations, while on night fighters Wing Commander Branse Burbridge claimed 21 kills, and Wing Commander John Cunningham claimed 19 of his 20 victories at night on Mosquitos. Mosquitos of No. 100 Group RAF were responsible for the destruction of 257 German aircraft from December 1943 to April 1945. Mosquito fighters from all units accounted for 487 German aircraft during the war, the vast majority of which were night fighters.Boiten 1997, pp. 188-189.
One Mosquito is listed as belonging to German secret operations unit Kampfgeschwader 200, which tested, evaluated and sometimes clandestinely operated captured enemy aircraft during the war. The aircraft was listed on the order of battle of Versuchsverband OKL[tpl]'[/tpl]s, 2 Staffel, Stab Gruppe on 10 November and 31 December 1944. However, on both lists, the Mosquito is listed as unserviceable.Thomas and Ketley 2003, pp. 178–179.
The Mosquito flew its last official European war mission on 21 May 1945, when Mosquitos of 143 Squadron and 248 Squadron RAF were ordered to continue to hunt German submarines that might be tempted to continue the fight; instead of submarines all the Mosquitos encountered were passive E-boats.Bowman 2005, p. 119.

There are approximately 30 non-flying Mosquitos around the world with only one airworthy example. The largest collection of Mosquitos is at the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre in the United Kingdom, which owns three aircraft, including the first prototype, W4050, possibly the only initial prototype of a Second World War aircraft design still in existence in the 21st century.
After 50 years in storage, on August 11, 2012, Lynn Garrison’s ex-Spartan Air Services PR.35 Mosquito (RS700 CF-HMS) was transferred to the Bomber Command Museum, Nanton, Alberta for restoration by the Calgary Mosquito Aircraft Society with half of the funding provided by the City of Calgary.Cromer, Peter. "The Journey Begins." Calgarymosquitosociety.com. Retrieved: October 1, 2012.
The airworthy Mosquito in flying condition, Mosquito FB.26 KA114, was built in Canada in 1945 and was restored by Avspecs Limited of Ardmore, New Zealand; its first post-restoration flight was on 27 September 2012. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth flights were watched by several thousand spectators at a special air show at Ardmore on 29 September. The aircraft is owned by Jerry Yagen and was shipped to his Military Aviation Museum, a large collection of flying historic aircraft in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

Sixteen years earlier, in July 1996, the then-only airworthy Mosquito, RR299, G-ASKH, was destroyed in an airshow accident at Barton, Manchester; both aircrew were killed. A temporary loss of power in the left engine caused the pilot (with over 10,000 hours of flying experience) to lose control at low level; RR299 hit the ground at high speed in nearby woodland and disintegrated."De Havilland DH98 Mosquito T3, G-ASKH: AAIB Bulletin No: 6/97 Ref: EW/C96/7/9Category: 1.1."
