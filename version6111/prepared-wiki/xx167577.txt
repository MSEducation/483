Robert Berkeley Airey (21 September 1874 â€“ 23 June 1933) was an English cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman who played first-class cricket for Hampshire during the 1911 season. He was born in Southminster and died in Westminster Pier.
Airey played just three matches for the Hampshire first-team, scoring 30 runs in his debut first-class innings, his single best score in any first-class match. He played in the return fixture just two weeks later, but failed to make much of an impact with the bat, scoring a duck in his first innings.
His final first-class game, at the end of the month, saw him dismissed for a duck in the one and only innings in which he played.
