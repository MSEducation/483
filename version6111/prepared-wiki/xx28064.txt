==Method==

Figures used in this chart are based on the most up to date estimate or projectionsChina's Population: The Most Surprising Demographic Crisis, The Economist, 2013. by the national census authority where available, and are usually rounded off. Where updated national data are not available, figures are based on the 2013 estimates by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Documentation/pdf/WPP2012_HIGHLIGHTS.pdf | title=World Population Prospects The 2012 Revision: Highlights and Advance Tables | publisher=The Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations | pages=51–55 | accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl]
Because the compiled figures are not collected at the same time in every country, or at the same level of accuracy, the resulting numerical comparisons may create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.  A handful of nations have not conducted a headcount in over 3 decades, leaving us with high error margin estimates only.
Areas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities, such as the European Union,The European Union is a sui generis supranational union whose sovereign members delegate to it by treaty certain powers that are often exercised by sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 503,491,975 on January 1, 2012, it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list, and it has [tpl]#expr: 503491975 / [tpl]worldpop[/tpl] * 100 round 2[/tpl]% of the world's population — see [tpl]cite web | title=Total population | publisher=Eurostat |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&language=en&pcode=tps00001 | accessdate=2010-06-18[/tpl] that are not sovereign states, and dependent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as various countries' claims to Antarctica.
