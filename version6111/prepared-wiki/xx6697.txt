==Introduction and elimination rules==

As a rule of inference, conjunction introduction is a classically valid, simple argument form. The argument form has two premises, A and B. Intuitively, it permits the inference of their conjunction.
or in logical operator notation:
Here is an example of an argument that fits the form conjunction introduction:
Conjunction elimination is another classically valid, simple argument form. Intuitively, it permits the inference from any conjunction of  either element of that conjunction.

==Properties==

commutativity: yes
associativity: yes
distributivity: with various operations, especially with or
with material nonimplication:
with itself:
|}
idempotency: yes 
monotonicity: yes
truth-preserving: yes 
When all inputs are true, the output is true.
falsehood-preserving: yes 
When all inputs are false, the output is false.
Walsh spectrum: (1,-1,-1,1)
Nonlinearity: 1 (the function is bent)
If using binary values for true (1) and false (0), then logical conjunction works exactly like normal arithmetic multiplication.

==Applications in computer engineering==

In high-level computer programming and digital electronics, logical conjunction is commonly represented by an infix operator, usually as a keyword such as "AND", an algebraic multiplication, or the ampersand symbol "&". Many languages also provide short-circuit control structures corresponding to logical conjunction.
Logical conjunction is often used for bitwise operations, where 0 corresponds to false and 1 to true:
The operation can also be applied to two binary words viewed as bitstrings of equal length, by taking the bitwise AND of each pair of bits at corresponding positions. For example:
This can be used to select part of a bitstring using a bit mask.  For example, 10011101 AND 00001000  =  00001000 extracts the fifth bit of an 8-bit bitstring.
In computer networking, bit masks are used to derive the network address of a subnet within an existing network from a given IP address, by ANDing the IP address and the subnet mask.
Logical conjunction "AND" is also used in SQL operations to form database queries.
The Curry-Howard correspondence relates logical conjunction to product types.

==Set-theoretic correspondence==

The  membership of an element of an intersection set in set theory is defined in terms of a logical conjunction: x ∈ A ∩ B if and only if (x ∈ A) ∧ (x ∈ B). Through this correspondence, set-theoretic intersection shares several properties with logical conjunction, such as associativity, commutativity, and idempotence.

==Natural language==

The logical conjunction and in logic is related to, but not the same as, the grammatical conjunction and in natural languages.
English "and" has properties not captured by logical conjunction.  For example, "and" sometimes implies order.  For example, "They got married and had a child" in common discourse means that the marriage came before the child.  The word "and" can also imply a partition of a thing into parts, as "The American flag is red, white, and blue."   Here it is not meant that the flag is at once red, white, and blue, but rather that it has a part of each color.
