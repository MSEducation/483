The organization was founded in 1926 as the Motor Bus Division of the American Automobile Association. It was reorganized in 1930 as the National Association of Motor Bus Operators, and in 1960 changed its name to National Association of Motor Bus Owners. It adopted its present name in 1977.
To the public at large, the ABA is best known for its Top 100 Events in North America, an annual compendium of the best events for group travel in the United States and Canada. Each year, 100 U.S. and Canadian events are selected for the program. One event from each country is singled out for top honors. The program was begun in 1982, and today, the Top 100 Events get worldwide attention via television, radio and print media. The prime source for information about these events is Top 100 Events in North America magazine, distributed to ABA members and thousands of travelers worldwide.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.buses.org/ | title = American Bus Association web site | accessdate = 2011-01-01| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110207150649/http://www.buses.org/| archivedate= 7 February 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Mission statement==

==Top 100 Events in North America==

The ABA compiles an annual list of its selections as the best events for group travel in the United States and Canada. The events include celebrations, festivals, parades, fairs, exhibits, shows, commemorative events, etc. They are chosen by a committee of ABA-member motorcoach and tour operators from hundreds of events that have been nominated by ABA members. From among the winners, ABA names a Number One Event for the United States, and another one for Canada. The list and its members get worldwide publicity through television, radio, and print media.  
The Top 100 Events for the coming year are published in a full-color Top 100 Events in North America magazine which is distributed with the September/October issue of ABA's Destinations magazine. ABA distributes the magazine to all its members and to thousands of travelers worldwide. ABA's Web site also lists the winners and has links directly to the events.

The Marketplace features a highly organized series of opportunities for attendees to meet face-to-face in prescheduled seven-minute appointments. Other Marketplace events include professional education seminars, exhibits provided by suppliers, and familiarization tours of attractions in the host city.
