==History==

In 1964, the Bracero Program, which allowed Mexican agricultural workers to work legally in the U.S. on a seasonal basis, came to an end. Less than a year after the end of the Bracero Program, the Mexican Government launched the Border Industrialization Program (BIP) or the Maquiladora Program, to solve the problem of rising unemployment along the border.[tpl]cite book | title = Sociology: a global perspective | author = Joan Ferrante | page = 38 | year = 9780495005612[/tpl] The maquiladoras became attractive to the US firms due to availability of cheap labor, devaluations of peso and favorable changes in the US customs laws.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] In 1985, maquiladoras overtook tourism as the largest source of foreign exchange, and since 1996 they have been the second largest industry in Mexico behind the petroleum industry.[tpl]cite book|authors=Louie, Miriam C.Y.|title=Sweatshop warriors: immigrant women workers take on the global factory|publisher=South End Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-89608-638-8|page=69|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ui3QxHFbNPkC&pg=PA69[/tpl]
The North American Free Trade Agreement (1994) favorably impacted the growth of maquila plants. During the five years before NAFTA, the maquila employment had grown at the rate of 47%; this figure increased to 86% in the next five years. The number of maquila plants grew from about 2700 to about 3700 in 2001.[ref]
