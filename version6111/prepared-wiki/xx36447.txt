==Childhood and early years==

David Gahan was born as David Callcott into a working-class family, to parents Len Callcott[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] (a bus driver) and his wife Sylvia (a conductress or "clippy" on London buses), Dave was six months old when his father left the family. Sylvia and Len divorced two years later and his mother moved Dave and sister Sue (born 1960) to Basildon, Essex, after Sylvia met and married her second husband Jack Gahan (an administrator with Shell Oil). The Gahan family continued to grow with the birth of two more half-brothers Peter (born 1966) and Phil (born 1968). Dave and Sue were raised under the impression that their mother's second husband, Jack, was their natural father.
In 1972, when Dave Gahan was 10 years old, his stepfather died. David recalls how he "came home one day and found this bloke biological father at home". Of the incident, he has said: "I'll never forget that day. When I came home from school, there was this stranger in my mum's house. My mother introduced him to me as my real dad. I remember I said, that was impossible because my father was dead. How was I supposed to know who that man was? From that day on, Len often visited the house, until one year later he disappeared again. Forever this time. Since then he had no contact with us. By growing older, I thought about him more and more. The only thing my mother would say, was that he moved out to Jersey to open a hotel".""The Big Uncertainty Of Depeche Mode's Dave Gahan" (1987) from Belgian pop-magazine JOEPIE" Jaakko's Depeche Mode page. Retrieved 21 June 2010. "Mum had kept it back from me 'til there was a need to tell me about my birth father, it's a different generation and you can understand I guess she thought she was doing the right thing".
While attending Barstable School on Timberlog Close in Basildon, Gahan started bunking off school, got into trouble with the police, was suspended from school and ended up in juvenile court three times for offences ranging from joyriding and graffiti to criminal damage and theft. He enjoyed the thrill of stealing cars, driving them around, and setting them alight.[tpl]cite book |title=Just Can't Get Enough: The Making of Depeche Mode |last=Spence |first=Simon |authorlink= |year=2011 |publisher=Jawbone Press |isbn=978-1-906002-56-5 |page=89[/tpl] Gahan tells of the time: "I was pretty wild. I loved the excitement of nicking a motor, screeching off and being chased by the police. Hiding behind the wall with your heart beating gives you a real kick - 'will they get you?'".[tpl]cite book |title=Stripped: The True Story of Depeche Mode |page=31 |last=Miller |first=Jonathan |year=2004 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=1-84449-415-2[/tpl] In his final year at school, Gahan applied for a job as an apprentice fitter with North Thames Gas. He was told by his probation officer to be honest with the interviewer, and as a result, he admitted his criminal record but claimed he was a "reformed character". As a result, he did not get the job which, he claimed, led to him trashing his probation officer's office. His punishment was weekend custody at a sub-Borstal attendance centre in Romford for one year. Gahan recalls: "You had to work. I remember doing boxing, stuff like that. You had to have your hair cut. It was every weekend, so you were deprived of your weekend and it seemed like forever. I was told very clearly that my next thing was detention centre. To be honest, music saved me."[tpl]cite journal |journal=Uncut |title=Just Can't Get Enough |issue=May 2001 |first=Stephen |last=Dalton |page=45[/tpl]
Within six months of leaving Barstable School in July 1978, Gahan found and lost something on the order of twenty jobs, from selling soft drinks, working in a greengrocers in Basildon Bus Station, working as a cashier in Sainsbury's petrol station in Savacentre, to working on a construction site. Eventually, he earned a place at Southend Technical College, which he enjoyed immensely. After two years, he gained the British Display Society Award, which allowed him to get jobs doing displays in shop windows and shopping centres.

==Career in Depeche Mode (1980 – present)==

In March 1980, Vince Clarke, Martin Gore and Andy Fletcher formed the band Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar, Gore on keyboards and Fletcher on bass. Clarke and Fletcher soon switched to synthesisers. The same year, Gahan joined the band after Clarke heard him perform David Bowie's "Heroes".[tpl]Citation | last=Shaw | first=William | title=In The Mode | journal=Details magazine |date=April 1993 | pages=90–95, 168[/tpl] The band was soon renamed Depeche Mode, a name suggested by Gahan after he had come across a fashion magazine called Dépêche-mode.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Q Magazine |url=http://www.sacreddm.net/2000s/q010603/q010603main.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110724052008/http://www.sacreddm.net/2000s/q010603/q010603main.htm |archivedate=24 July 2011 |title=Cash For Questions: Dave Gahan |issue=June 2003 |first=Paul |last=Stokes |accessdate=30 October 2011[/tpl]
A new wave/synthpop pioneer of the early 1980s, Depeche Mode has explored new musical directions for over 30 years, and their sound has remained diverse since their inception. They have released thirteen studio albums, four greatest hits compilations and two remix albums. The band has achieved global sales in excess of 100 million."New Depeche Mode album number one in 20 countries" EmiMusic.com. 1 May 2009.
Gahan had expressed some resentment about never writing songs for Depeche Mode.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] In a 2003 interview he shared, "During the making of Exciter, sometimes I felt a bit frustrated that there was a lack of experimentation.""Zonkel, Phillip: Gahan no longer in such a hurry." Daily News (Los Angeles, CA). 24 August 2003. This led him, in 2004, to tell his bandmates that he wanted to write half of the songs on the new Depeche Mode album, and there was "no way" he could be involved in the band without contributing.Quan, Denise. "A Sobering Interview with Depeche Mode". CNN.com. 13 May 2009. Eventually there was a compromise, and three of Gahan's songs appeared on 2005's Playing the Angel: "Suffer Well" (nominated for a Grammy award), "I Want It All" and "Nothing's Impossible". "Suffer Well" was released as a single in 2006, reaching No. 12 in the UK.
Three more Gahan-penned songs, co-written with Christian Eigner and Andrew Phillpott, appeared on the band's 12th studio album, Sounds of the Universe, released on 20 April 2009. The songs are "Hole to Feed", "Come Back" and "Miles Away / The Truth Is". Gahan also wrote the lyrics to the B-side "Oh Well" but the music was done by Martin Gore. It is the first collaboration between the two."Depeche Mode present birth first song in 4 video postings" Side-Line.com. 24 November 2008.Details of the Universe[tpl]Dead link|date=June 2010[/tpl] "Hole to Feed" was released along with Gore's "Fragile Tension" as a double A-side single in late 2009.
In 2013, with the release of Depeche Mode's 13th album Delta Machine, Dave Gahan is credited for having written the songs "Broken", "Secret to the End", the single "Should Be Higher" and two B-sides "Happens All the Time" and "All That's Mine". Co-writer this time is Kurt Uenala. Gahan has written a second song in collaboration with Martin Gore, called "Long Time Lie".

==Solo albums (2003–present)==

In 1997, Gahan contributed to the tribute album "Dream Home Heartaches: Remaking/Remodeling Roxy Music" with the song "A Song For Europe".
In 2003, he released his first solo album, Paper Monsters (which he co-wrote with guitarist and friend Knox Chandler), followed by the Paper Monsters Tour (including a performance at 2003's Glastonbury Festival), singing both his new solo tracks and Depeche Mode fan favourites. His touring band included Knox Chandler on guitar, Martyn LeNoble (Porno for Pyros, Jane's Addiction, The Cult) on bass, Vincent Jones (Sarah McLachlan, The Grapes of Wrath) on keyboards, and Victor Indrizzo (Beck, Macy Gray) on drums.
The album was a moderate success. The first single "Dirty Sticky Floors" hit the Top 20 in the UK Singles Chart. The album became a Top 10 hit on the European album chart and a Top 40 hit in the UK Albums Chart. This success was backed by a world tour and a live DVD titled Live Monsters which was released in 2004. A year later, he also appeared as model and spokesperson of the Swedish mid-range fashion retailer J. Lindeberg and its S/S 2006 menswear line. The ads featured both him and seemingly random quotes like "What would happen if we all told the truth", "You can tell he's lying because his lips are moving", etc. These ads appeared prominently in international fashion press.
Gahan did a collaboration in 2003 with Junkie XL and handled the vocals for a song called "Reload" for this Dutch DJ's album Radio JXL: A Broadcast from the Computer Hell Cabin.

===Health===

Gahan is a recovering heroin addict. He has survived four brushes with death, living up to the nickname, "The Cat", that paramedics gave him during his roughest years in LA.[tpl]cite journal |journal=NME |url=http://www.sacreddm.net/1990s/nme180197/text2.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110724053356/http://www.sacreddm.net/1990s/nme180197/text2.htm |archivedate=24 July 2011 |title=Dead man talking |date=18 January 1997 |first=Keith |last=Cameron |accessdate=30 October 2011[/tpl]
In 1993, Gahan suffered a small heart attack during a performance in New Orleans, leaving his bandmates to improvise an encore without him.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Uncut |url=http://www.sacreddm.net/2000s/unc010501/unc010501main.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110724052422/http://sacreddm.net/2000s/unc010501/unc010501main.htm |archivedate=24 July 2011 |title=Just Can't Get Enough |issue=May 2001 |first=Stephen |last=Dalton |accessdate=30 October 2011[/tpl] His doctors advised him to take a break from the tour, but he refused.
The second brush came when he attempted suicide by slashing his wrists in August 1995: "It was definitely a suicide attempt", says Gahan, "but it was also a cry for help. I made sure there were people who might find me".[tpl]cite journal |journal=Arena |url=http://www.sacreddm.net/1990s/are010497/text2.htm |archiveurl=http://www.dmtvarchives.com/forum/index.php?topic=567.180#msg11703 |archivedate=7 May 2012 |title=Dead man talking |issue=April 1997 |first=Gareth |last=Grundy |accessdate=30 October 2011[/tpl]
On 28 May 1996, Gahan overdosed on a speedball  at the Sunset Marquis Hotel in Los Angeles, which resulted in his heart stopping for two minutes until he was revived by paramedics. Gahan said of the experience, "All I saw and all I felt at first was complete darkness. I've never been in a space that was blacker, and I remember feeling that whatever it was I was doing, it was really wrong". He has also claimed he saw/heard his then-girlfriend, his now wife Jennifer, calling him back. The album Ultra was eventually released once Gahan had completed a spell in rehab.
On 12 May 2009, shortly before the band were due onstage in Athens, Greece, for a concert on Depeche Mode's Tour of the Universe, Gahan fell ill in his dressing room. He was rushed to hospital where it was confirmed that he was suffering from a bout of gastroenteritis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.depechemode.com/news.html |title=depeche mode dot com |publisher=Depechemode.com |accessdate=19 August 2010[/tpl] A number of dates were either postponed or cancelled as further tests were conducted, revealing a low-grade malignant tumor in his bladder. Gahan underwent an operation to successfully remove the tumor. After doctor-ordered time to fully recover, the tour resumed in Leipzig, Germany, on 8 June.
Gahan later suffered a torn calf muscle while performing in Bilbao, Spain, on 9 July 2009, resulting in two further cancellations."Dave Gahan injured – Depeche Mode Cancel Final 2 Shows in Europe" Side-Line.com. 13 July 2009.
