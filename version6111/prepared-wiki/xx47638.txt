RA and wife M Grainer were regularly mentioned in the Cairns Post MM social notes columns as members of the MM rifle club the MM Queensland Country Women's Association or MM school functions from Jan 1918.

==RAAF==

After the outbreak of World War II, Grainer joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in December 1940 and was sent to Amberley, Queensland, posted to 73 Signals, given a course at Point Cook and assigned to Radar Station No. 58, Townsville. While stationed there, and in subsequent similar postings, he contributed to barracks recreation activities by scoring and organising numerous servicemen shows."On The Trail Of Inspector Maigret", Australian Women's Weekly, 27 June 1962, p. 42. In February 1940 he joined the RAAF entertainment unit. In the official report on his audition performance the only music piece mentioned by title was Ravel's Bolero,National Archives of Australia, "Ronald Erle Grainer RAAF entertainment audition report", p. 7/80. a seemingly simple instrumental riff which holds the listeners' attention in a similar manner to Grainer's later themes and signature tunes. Grainer had only a few months performing for his fellow airmen. In July 1944 he was admitted to the 3 RAAF Hospital seriously ill after sustaining a severe injury when a 44-gallon drum fell on his leg while he was travelling in a truck."Move over Rodgers Here Comes Grainer" Australian Womans Weekly 5 August 1964 p9 For a while the airforce medical team considered amputation but Grainer eventually recovered. He was discharged from the RAAF as permanently medically unfit in September 1945.National Archives of Australia, Series A9301, Control symbol 23963, Barcode 4564067: Grainer, Ronald Erle 1939–1948 A rehabilitation course took him to the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music, where he studied under Eugene Goossens."As soon as I was discharged in '46 I went to the Sydney Conservatorium to study under Sir Eugene Gossens", Ron Grainer statement quoted in article "Move Over Rodgers Here Comes Grainer", Australian Women's Weekly, 5 August 1964, p. 9.

==Early musical education and career==

Grainer received his teaching and performing diploma for pianoforte in December 1949.Sydney Morning Herald, 23 December 1949, p. 8. During 1950 and 1951 he began appearing in a series of solo artist radio shows for the Australian Broadcasting Commission.“Radio”, Adelaide Advertiser, 18 September 1950, p. 16, cp 5.4.51 p6, Townsville Bulletin 4.5.51 p3,  cp 4.9.51 p6 In August 1951 a presentation of Delius, Faure and Milhaud compositions by Grainer on Piano and Don Scott on violin was ridiculed in a newspaper review for the duo's “uncompromising disregard of mob appeal", "lack of practical concert sense" and "unrelievedly pastel colouring” set list that was “in need of a more impulsive and heartfelt spirit on the well tendered surface" having earlier said "by the time the programme ended the recital badly needed blood transfusion”.Sydney Morning Herald, 16 August 1951, p.4. By the mid 1950s Grainer had abandoned his classical repertoire and live concert work with such a determined change of attitude that he claimed in a 1964 magazine interview that he had "always loathed performing".

==London==

In 1952 Grainer left Australia for London with his wife Margot and 10-year-old stepdaughter Rel. He managed to find a three-month engagement playing piano in a nightclub along with other occasional jobs, the worst of which became a twelve-month stint with a comedy act called "The Allen Brothers and June". This required the classically trained Grainer to be hit on the head nightly by a falling grand piano lid and then to topple over into the orchestra pit. An experience he later said was even harder to do than a day's fencing in the Australian outback."Music from Paradise" New Idea 29.1.66 p49
At one stage to pay the rent on their room Grainer and his wife had to work as caretakers of a large block of London flats where he stoked two large boilers morning and night while Margot washed stairs and cleaned rooms."ABC On The Trail Of Inspector Maigret" Australian Women's Weekly 27 June 1962 p42"
To increase his public profile Grainer had two attempts at song contests: “England's Made of Us” (1956), an entry with lyricist David Dearlove for the First British Festival of Popular Song. which received the score of no points from the judges.Gordon Roxburgh “Songs For Europe” Telos Publishing Denbighshire p. 53–60 and the following year, “Don't Cry Little Doll” (1957) (also written with David Dearlove), which reached fourth place in the British Eurovision entry decider heats.
Grainer's most dramatic pre-success music involvement was with Before The Sun Goes Down, a  TV play which caused audience panic and questions to be raised in the British Parliament when it was shown on 20 February 1959. Taking inspiration from Orson Welles' 1938 radio drama of The War of the Worlds, the production used a similar format in which a regular program broadcast was interrupted by a fake public service announcement. In this instance it was about a mysterious and "terrifying" satellite seen hovering over the city of London.[tpl]citation |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1959/mar/16/television-bogus-news-broadcast#S5CV0602P0_19590316_HOC_407 |title=Television (Bogis News Broadcast) |publisher=Hansard |work=Common Sitting HC Debates |date= 16 March 1959 |volume=Vol 602 |quote=cc 161-72[/tpl]

He once indicated he felt a “trifle wistful” that so many people just associated him with the Doctor Who theme,“The Music Man”, The Age newspaper, Melbourne, 17 June 1966, p. 2. the only tune in his extensive portfolio that had its sound dynamics realised by someone else - Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.Brian Hodgson  "Delia Derbyshire" obituary The Guardian 7 July 2001The composition was not a rush job by Grainer.
