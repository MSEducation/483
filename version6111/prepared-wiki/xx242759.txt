==Name==

The name of the settlement was changed from Sveti Jurij ob Pesnici (literally, 'Saint George on the Pesnica River') to Jurski Vrh (literally, 'George Peak') in 1952. The name was changed on the basis of the 1948 Law on Names of Settlements and Designations of Squares, Streets, and Buildings as part of efforts by Slovenia's postwar communist government to remove religious elements from toponyms.Spremembe naselij 1948–95. 1996.
