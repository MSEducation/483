</ref> Labour's [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], [[Yvette Cooper]], claimed the loans should ensure that projects worth £13bn — including waste treatment projects, environmental schemes and schools — would not be delayed or cancelled. She also promised that the loans would be temporary and would be repaid at a commercial rate. But, at the time, [[Vince Cable]] of the [[Liberal Democrats]], subsequently [[Secretary of State for Business]] in the [[Coalition Government 2010–present|coalition]], argued in favour of traditional public financing structures instead of propping up PFI with public money:
In opposition at the time, even the Conservative Party considered that, with the taxpayer now funding it directly, PFI had become "ridiculous". Philip Hammond, subsequently Secretary of State for Transport in the coalition, said:
In an interview in November 2009, Conservative George Osborne, subsequently Chancellor of the Exchequer in the coalition, sought to distance his party from the excesses of PFI by blaming Labour for its misuse, despite it still bearing all the hallmarks of the policy devised by his own party.[ref]
</ref> At the time, Osborne proposed a modified PFI which would preserve the arrangement of private sector investment for public infrastructure projects in return for part-privatisation, but would ensure proper risk transfer to the private sector along with transparent accounting:

Despite being so critical of PFI while in opposition and promising reform, once in power George Osborne progressed 61 PFI schemes worth a total of £6.9bn in his first year as Chancellor. According to Mark Hellowell from the University of Edinburgh:
The high cost of PFI deals is a major issue, particularly in this time of economic hardship. There are arguments for renegotiating PFI deals in the face of reduced public sector budgets, or even for refusing to pay PFI charges on the grounds that they are a form of odious debt.[ref]
</ref> Critics such as Peter Dixon argue that PFI is fundamentally the wrong model for infrastructure investment, saying that public sector funding is the way forward.<ref name="PFI is a liability">
</ref>
In November 2010 the UK government released spending figures showing that the current total payment obligation for PFI contracts in the UK is £267 billion. Also, research has shown that in 2009 the Treasury failed to negotiate decent PFI deals with publicly owned banks, resulting in £1bn of unnecessary costs. This failure is particularly grave given the coalition's own admission in their national infrastructure plan that a 1% reduction in the cost of capital for infrastructure investment could save the taxpayer £5bn a year.
In February 2011 the Treasury announced a project to examine the £835m Queen’s Hospital PFI deal. Once savings and efficiencies are identified, the hope - as yet unproven -  is that the PFI consortium can be persuaded to modify its contract. The same process could potentially be applied across a range of PFI projects.

===Examples of PFI projects in the United Kingdom===

The Guardian published a full list of PFI contracts by department in July 2012.[tpl]cite news|title=PFI contracts: the full list|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jul/05/pfi-contracts-list?|accessdate=9 November 2013|newspaper=Guardian|date=5 July 2012[/tpl] 

==Development of PFI in Spain==

Examples of PFI projects in Spain include Parque de Valdebebas in Madrid, Ciutat de la Justicia in Barcelona, the Autovia de Noroeste in Murcia, and the Hospital Puerta de Hierro in Majadahonda.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.madrid.org/cs/Satellite?pagename=HospitalPuertaHierroMaja/Page/HPHM_home|title=Hospital Puerta de Hierro in Majadahonda|accessdate=30 September 2012[/tpl]  The translation of 'private finance initiative' in Spanish is 'la financiación privada de infraestructuras públicas'.

==Development of PFI in other countries==

As well as the UK, PFI has also been adopted, under various guises, in many other countries including: Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Greece, India,  Ireland, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain and the United States.

==Impact in the United Kingdom==

===Analysis===

A study by HM Treasury in July 2003 was supportive showing that the only deals in its sample which were over budget were those where the public sector changed their minds after deciding what they wanted and from whom they wanted to buy it.[tpl]Citation| first =| last =| title = PFI - Meeting The Challenge| publisher = HM Treasury| url = http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/[/tpl]
Also a report by the National Audit Office in 2009 found that 69 per cent of PFI construction projects between 2003 and 2008 were delivered on time and 65 per cent were delivered at the contracted price.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0809/private_finance_projects.aspx|title=Private Finance Projects|publisher=National Audit Office|accessdate=30 September 2012[/tpl]
However a report by the National Audit Office in 2011 was much more critical, finding that the use of PFI "has the effect of increasing the cost of finance for public investments relative to what would be available to the government if it borrowed on its own account" and "the price of finance is significantly higher with a PFI."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmtreasy/1146/114608.htm|title=Conclusions and recommendations|publisher=House of Commons|year=2011|accessdate=30 September 2012[/tpl]
An article in The Economist reports that:
[tpl]Block quote|Getting the private sector to build and run prisons has brought tangible benefits. One is speed: private jails are built in as little as two years, rather than the seven that they used to take when the government did the building. Running costs are lower too, mainly because staff are paid a quarter less than in the public sector (though senior managers are paid more) and get fewer benefits.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13962456?story_id=E1_TPJGNQVG|accessdate=2011-05-09|title=Private prisons: Criminal enterprises | work = The Economist|date=2009-07-02[/tpl][/tpl]
On the other hand, Monbiot argues that the specifications of many public infrastructure projects have been distorted to increase their profitability for PFI contractors, specifically:

PFI projects allowed the Ministry of Defence to gain many useful resources "on a shoestring"; PFI deals were signed for barracks, headquarters buildings, training for pilots and sailors, and an aerial refuelling service, amongst other things.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/8527469?story_id=E1_RVNSQGJ|accessdate=2011-05-09|title=Defence spending: Under PFIre | work = The Economist|date=2011-05-09[/tpl]
Individuals have speculated that some PFI projects have been shoddily specified and executed.  For example, in 2005 a confidential government report condemned the PFI-funded Newsam Centre at Seacroft Hospital for jeopardising the lives of 300 patients and staff. The Newsam Centre is for people with lifelong learning difficulties and the mentally ill. The report said that there were shortcomings "in each of the five key areas of documentation, design, construction, operation and management" at the hospital, which cost £47m. Between 2001-5 there were four patient suicides, including one which was left undiscovered for four days in an out-of-order bathroom. The coroner said that Leeds Mental Health Teaching NHS Trust, which is responsible for the facility, had failed to keep patients under proper observation. The government report said that the design and construction of the building did not meet the requirements for a facility for mental patients. The building has curving corridors which make patient observation and quick evacuation difficult. The report said that the building also constituted a fire hazard, as it was constructed without proper fire protection materials in the wall and floor joints. In addition, mattresses and chairs used below-standard fire-retardant materials. Patients were allowed to smoke in rooms where they could not be easily observed. The fire-safety manual was described as "very poor", and the fire-safety procedure consisted of a post-it note marked "to be provided by the Trust". Unsurprisingly the report concluded that "every section of the fire safety code" had been breached.
On the other hand, the building of two new PFI Police Stations on behalf of Kent Police serving the Medway area and the North Kent area (Gravesend and Dartford) is credited as a successful PFI project. Supporters say that the new buildings take into account the modern needs of the police better than the 60s/70s building, and that another advantage is that the old buildings can be sold for income or redeveloped into the police estate.

===National Health Service (NHS)===

A recent study by University College London, studying data at hospitals built since 1995, supports the argument that private-sector providers are more accountable to provide quality services: It showed that hospitals operating under PFI have better patient environment ratings than conventionally funded hospitals of similar age. The PFI hospitals also have higher cleanliness scores than non-PFI hospitals of similar age, according to data collected by the NHS.[tpl]cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/health/article7128092.ece|accessdate=2011-05-09|title=PFI-funded hospitals outshine peers in study of cleanliness - Times Online|date=2011-05-09|location=London|work=The Times|first=Angela|last=Jameson[/tpl]
There is evidence that the cost of hospitals ordered through PFI is adversely affecting the UK's National Health Service. Jonathan Fielden, chair of the British Medical Association's consultants' committee has said that PFI debts are "distorting clinical priorities" and impacting the treatment given to patients. Fielden cited the example of University Hospital Coventry where the NHS Trust was forced to borrow money in order to make the first £54m payment owed to the PFI contractor. He said that the trust was in the ignominious position of struggling for money before the hospital's doors even opened. The trust could not afford to run all the services that it had commissioned, and was having to mothball services and close wards.
The high cost of hospitals built under PFI is forcing service cuts at neighbouring hospitals built with public money. For example, overspending at the PFI-funded Worcestershire Royal Hospital has put a question mark over services at neighbouring hospitals. A Strategic Health Authority paper in 2007 noted debts at two hospitals in south-east London: Princess Royal University Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The paper attributed the debts in part to their high fixed PFI costs, and suggested that the same would soon apply at a third hospital in the area, Lewisham Hospital.
Peter Dixon, Chairman of University College Hospital, the largest PFI-built hospital in England, has gone on the record to say:

===Employment===

In the past, when spending was tight and budgets were cut, hospitals preferred to retain doctors and nurses and kept services running by spending less on building maintenance. Nowadays, under PFI, hospitals are forced to prioritise the contractual payments for their buildings over jobs and, according to figures published by the Department of Health, these committed payments can account for up to 20% of operating budget. Nigel Edwards, head of policy for the NHS Confederation, noted that:

Dr Jonathan Fielden, chair of the British Medical Association's consultants' committee has said that as a result of the high costs of a PFI scheme in Coventry "they are potentially reducing jobs". In fact by 2005 the hospital trust in Coventry was anticipating a deficit of £13m due to PFI and “drastic measures” were required to plug the gap including shutting one ward, removing eight beds from another, shortening the opening hours of the Surgical Assessment Unit, and the “rationalisation of certain posts” – which meant cutting 116 jobs.
Under PFI, many staff have their employment contracts automatically transferred to the private sector, using a process known as TUPE. In many cases this results in worse terms of employment and pension rights. Heather Wakefield, UNISON's national secretary for local government, has said:

===Debt===

The debt created by PFI has a significant impact on the finances of public bodies. As of October 2007 the total capital value of PFI contracts signed throughout the UK was £68bn. However, this figure pales into insignificance compared with the commitment of central and local government to pay a further £267bn over the lifetime of these contracts. To give regional examples, the £5.2bn of PFI investment in Scotland up to 2007 has created a public sector cash liability of £22.3bn and the investment of just £618m via PFI in Wales up to 2007 has created a public sector cash liability of £3.3bn.[tpl]Citation| first = Mark| last = Hellowell| first2 = Allyson M.| last2 = Pollock| title = Written Evidence to the National Assembly for Wales Finance Committee with Regards to its Inquiry on Public Private Partnerships| year = 2007| publisher = University of Edinburgh| url = http://www.health.ed.ac.uk/CIPHP/Documents/EvidencetoWelshFinanceCommittee_Dec2007_000.pdf[/tpl]  However, these debts are small compared to other public-sector liabilities.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15731336?story_id=E1_TVSPTPPG|accessdate=2011-05-09|title=PFInancing: The art of concealment | work = The Economist|date=2011-05-09[/tpl]
Annual payments to the private owners of the PFI schemes are due to peak at £10bn in 2017[tpl]Citation  | last=Timmins  | first=Nicholas  | title=PFI project costs exceed £200bn  | newspaper=Financial Times  | date=26 March 2010 | accessdate=26 June 2010  | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1c34b6f4-3877-11df-aabd-00144feabdc0.html[/tpl] and are already stretching constricted public sector budgets. Many NHS Trusts are now experiencing serious financial difficulties and, if the level of government spending falls, may become insolvent. In some cases Trusts are having to 'rationalise' spending by closing wards and laying off staff, but they are not allowed to default on their PFI payments: "In September 1997 the government declared that these payments would be legally guaranteed: beds, doctors, nurses and managers could be sacrificed, but not the annual donation to the Fat Cats Protection League". Should certain Trusts fail because they cannot meet their PFI payments, this will provide further opportunities for privatisation if the government brings in private healthcare corporations to run the hospitals instead.
Mark Porter, of the British Medical Association said: "Locking the NHS into long-term contracts with the private sector has made entire local health economies more vulnerable to changing conditions. Now the financial crisis has changed conditions beyond recognition, so trusts tied into PFI deals have even less freedom to make business decisions that protect services, making cuts and closures more likely."[ref]
