Animal testing, also known as animal experimentation, animal research, and in vivo testing, is the use of non-human animals in experiments (although some research about animals involves only natural behaviors or pure observation, such as a mouse running a maze or field studies of chimp troops). The research is conducted inside universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, farms, defense establishments, and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15004.htm#a7 |title="Introduction", Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures Report|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2012-07-13[/tpl] It includes pure research (such as genetics, developmental biology, and behavioral studies) as well as applied research (such as biomedical research, xenotransplantation, drug testing, and toxicology tests, including cosmetics testing). Animals are also used for education, breeding, and defense research. The practice is regulated to various degrees in different countries.
Worldwide it is estimated that the number of vertebrate animals—from zebrafish to non-human primates—ranges from the tens of millions to more than 100 million used annually.Meredith Cohn (2010-08-26). "Alternatives to Animal Testing Gaining Ground," The Baltimore Sun. Invertebrates, mice, rats, birds, fish, frogs, and animals not yet weaned are not included in the figures in the United States; one estimate of mice and rats used in the US alone in 2001 was 80 million.Carbone, p. 26.For figures from the European Commission, see:  DIRECTIVE 2010/63/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 22 September 2010. eur-lex.europa.eu Most animals are euthanized after being used in an experiment.Carbone, p. 22. Sources of laboratory animals vary between countries and species; most animals are purpose-bred, while others are caught in the wild or supplied by dealers who obtain them from auctions and pounds."Use of Laboratory Animals in Biomedical and Behavioral Research", Institute for Laboratory Animal Research, The National Academies Press, 1988 ISBN 0-309-07878-4.Cooper, Sylvia (1999-08-01).

Supporters of the use of animals in experiments, such as the British Royal Society, argue that virtually every medical achievement in the 20th century relied on the use of animals in some way,The use of non-human animals in research: a guide for scientists The Royal Society, 2004, p. 1 with the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences arguing that even sophisticated computers are unable to model interactions between molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms, and the environment, making animal research necessary in many areas."Science, Medicine, and Animals", Institute for Laboratory Animal Research, Published by the National Research Council of the National Academies 2004, p. 2 Animal rights, and some animal welfare, organizations—such as PETA and BUAV—question the legitimacy of it, arguing that it is cruel, poor scientific practice, poorly regulated, that medical progress is being held back by misleading animal models, that some of the tests are outdated, that it cannot reliably predict effects in humans, that the costs outweigh the benefits, or that animals have an intrinsic right not to be used for experimentation."Animals Used for Experimentation FAQs", People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals."UK Legislation: A Criticism", and "FAQs: Vivisection", British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection."Biomedical research", The Humane Society of the United States."Animal experimentation issues", Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.

==Definitions==

The terms animal testing, animal experimentation, animal research, ''in vivo'' testing, and vivisection have similar denotations but different connotations. Literally, "vivisection" means the "cutting up" of a living animal, and historically referred only to experiments that involved the dissection of live animals. The term is occasionally used to refer pejoratively to any experiment using living animals; for example, the Encyclopædia Britannica defines "vivisection" as: "Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals",Croce, Pietro (1999). Vivisection or Science? An Investigation into Testing Drugs and Safeguarding Health. Zed Books, ISBN 1856497321."Vivisection", ''Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2007. although dictionaries point out that the broader definition is "used only by people who are opposed to such work".[ref]Definitions in:

==History==

The earliest references to animal testing are found in the writings of the Greeks in the 2nd and 4th centuries BCE. Aristotle and Erasistratus were among the first to perform experiments on living animals.Cohen and Loew 1984. Galen, a physician in 2nd-century Rome, dissected pigs and goats, and is known as the "father of vivisection".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lpag.org/layperson/layperson.html#history |title=History of nonhuman animal research|publisher= Laboratory Primate Advocacy Group[/tpl] Avenzoar, an Arabic physician in 12th-century Moorish Spain who also practiced dissection, introduced animal testing as an experimental method of testing surgical procedures before applying them to human patients.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Abdel-Halim |first1=RE |title=Contributions of Ibn Zuhr (Avenzoar) to the progress of surgery: a study and translations from his book Al-Taisir |journal=Saudi medical journal |volume=26 |issue=9 |pages=1333–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16155644[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Abdel-Halim |first1=RE |title=Contributions of Muhadhdhab Al-Deen Al-Baghdadi to the progress of medicine and urology.

Animals have been used repeatedly through the history of biomedical research. The founders, in 1831, of the Dublin Zoo were members of the medical profession, interested in studying the animals both while they were alive and when they were dead.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/the-great-zoos-who-2669960.html | work=Irish Independent | first=John | last=Costello | title=The great zoo's who | date=2011-06-09[/tpl] In the 1880s, Louis Pasteur convincingly demonstrated the germ theory of medicine by inducing anthrax in sheep. In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning. Insulin was first isolated from dogs in 1922, and revolutionized the treatment of diabetes. On November 3, 1957, a Soviet dog, Laika, became the first of many animals to orbit the earth. In the 1970s, antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were developed using armadillos, then given to humans.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Scollard DM, Adams LB, Gillis TP, Krahenbuhl JL, Truman RW, Williams DL |title=The Continuing Challenges of Leprosy |journal=Clin.

Toxicology testing became important in the 20th century. In the 19th century, laws regulating drugs were more relaxed. For example, in the U.S., the government could only ban a drug after a company had been prosecuted for selling products that harmed customers. However, in response to the Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster of 1937 in which the eponymous drug killed more than 100 users, the U.S. congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed. Other countries enacted similar legislation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/SulfanilamideDisaster/default.htm |title=Taste of Raspberries, Taste of Death.

===Historical debate===

As the experimentation on animals increased, especially the practice of vivisection, so did criticism and controversy. In 1655, the advocate of Galenic physiology Edmund O'Meara said that "the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state."Ryder, Richard D. (2000). Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism. Berg Publishers, p. 54 ISBN 1859733301."Animal Experimentation: A Student Guide to Balancing the Issues", Australian and New Zealand Council for the Care of Animals in Research and Teaching (ANZCCART), accessed December 12, 2007, cites original reference in Maehle, A-H. and Tr6hler, U. Animal experimentation from antiquity to the end of the eighteenth century: attitudes and arguments. In N. A. Rupke (ed.) Vivisection in Historical Perspective. Croom Helm, London, 1987, p. 22. O'Meara and others argued that animal physiology could be affected by pain during vivisection, rendering results unreliable. There were also objections on an ethical basis, contending that the benefit to humans did not justify the harm to animals. Early objections to animal testing also came from another angle—many people believed that animals were inferior to humans and so different that results from animals could not be applied to humans.
On the other side of the debate, those in favor of animal testing held that experiments on animals were necessary to advance medical and biological knowledge. Claude Bernard—who is sometimes known as the "prince of vivisectors"Croce, Pietro. Vivisection or Science? An Investigation into Testing Drugs and Safeguarding Health. Zed Books, 1999, ISBN 1856497321 p. 11. and the father of physiology, and whose wife, Marie Françoise Martin, founded the first anti-vivisection society in France in 1883Rudacille, Deborah (2000). The Scalpel and the Butterfly: The Conflict, University of California Press, p. 19 ISBN 0520231546.—famously wrote in 1865 that "the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen"."In sickness and in health: vivisection's undoing", The Daily Telegraph, November 2003 Arguing that "experiments on animals ... are entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of man...the effects of these substances are the same on man as on animals, save for differences in degree", Bernard established animal experimentation as part of the standard scientific method.LaFollette, H., Shanks, N., Animal Experimentation: the Legacy of Claude Bernard, International Studies in the Philosophy of Science'' (1994) pp. 195–210.
In 1896, the physiologist and physician Dr. Walter B. Cannon said "The antivivisectionists are the second of the two types Theodore Roosevelt described when he said, 'Common sense without conscience may lead to crime, but conscience without common sense may lead to folly, which is the handmaiden of crime.[tpl]'"[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|pmid=1775539|title= A Physiologist's Views on the Animal Rights/Liberation Movement|year=1991|last1=Nicoll|first1=CS|volume=34|issue=6|pages=303, 306–8, 315|journal=The Physiologist[/tpl] These divisions between pro- and anti- animal testing groups first came to public attention during the brown dog affair in the early 1900s, when hundreds of medical students clashed with anti-vivisectionists and police over a memorial to a vivisected dog.Mason, Peter. The Brown Dog Affair. Two Sevens Publishing, 1997.
In 1822, the first animal protection law was enacted in the British parliament, followed by the Cruelty to Animals Act (1876), the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by Charles Darwin, who wrote to Ray Lankester in March 1871: "You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite agree that it is justifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not say another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Life-and-Letters-of-Charles-Darwinx29407.html |title=The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, Volume II |publisher=Fullbooks.com [/tpl]Bowlby, John (1991). Charles Darwin: A New Life, W. W. Norton & Company, p. 420 ISBN 0393309304. In response to the lobbying by anti-vivisectionists, several organizations were set up in Britain to defend animal research: The Physiological Society was formed in 1876 to give physiologists "mutual benefit and protection",[tpl]cite book|last=Ilman|first=John|title=Animal Research in Medicine: 100 years of politics, protest and progress. The Story of the Research Defence Society|year=2008|publisher=Research Defence Society|isbn=978-0-9560008-04|page=16[/tpl] the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research was formed in 1882 and focused on policy-making, and the Research Defence Society (now Understanding Animal Research) was formed in 1908 "to make known the facts as to experiments on animals in this country; the immense importance to the welfare of mankind of such experiments and the great saving of human life and health directly attributable to them."[tpl]cite book|title=Publications of the Research Defence Society: March 1908–1909; Selected by the committee|year=1909|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|page=xiv[/tpl]
Opposition to the use of animals in medical research first arose in the United States during the 1860s, when Henry Bergh founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), with America's first specifically anti-vivisection organization being the American AntiVivisection Society (AAVS), founded in 1883. Antivivisectionists of the era generally believed the spread of mercy was the great cause of civilization, and vivisection was cruel. However, in the USA the antivivisectionists' efforts were defeated in every legislature, overwhelmed by the superior organization and influence of the medical community. Overall, this movement had little legislative success until the passing of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, in 1966.Buettinger, Craig (1993-01-01) Antivivisection and the charge of zoophil-psychosis in the early twentieth century.

==Care and use of animals==

===The Three Rs===

The Three Rs (3Rs) are guiding principles for more ethical use of animals in testing.  These were first described by W.M.S. Russell and R.L. Burch in 1959.Russell, W.M.S. and Burch, R.L., (1959).  The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique, Methuen, London. ISBN 0900767782 http://altweb.jhsph.edu/pubs/books/humane_exp/het-toc  The 3Rs are – 
The 3Rs have a broader scope than simply encouraging alternatives to animal testing, but aim to improve animal welfare and scientific quality where the use of animals can not be avoided.  These 3Rs are now implemented in many testing establishments worldwide and have been adopted by various pieces of legislation and regulations.

===Regulations===

The regulations that apply to animals in laboratories vary across species. In the U.S., under the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (the Guide), published by the National Academy of Sciences, any procedure can be performed on an animal if it can be successfully argued that it is scientifically justified. In general, researchers are required to consult with the institution's veterinarian and its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which every research facility is obliged to maintain.Carbone, pp. 68–69. The IACUC must ensure that alternatives, including non-animal alternatives, have been considered, that the experiments are not unnecessarily duplicative, and that pain relief is given unless it would interfere with the study. Larry Carbone, a laboratory animal veterinarian, writes that, in his experience, IACUCs take their work very seriously regardless of the species involved, though the use of non-human primates always raises what he calls a "red flag of special concern."Carbone, p. 94. A study published in Science magazine in July 2001 confirmed the low reliability of IACUC reviews of animal experiments. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the three-year study found that animal-use committees that do not know the specifics of the university and personnel do not make the same approval decisions as those made by animal-use committees that do know the university and personnel. Specifically, blinded committees more often ask for more information rather than approving studies.[tpl]cite doi|10.1126/science.1061621[/tpl]
The IACUCs regulate all vertebrates in testing at institutions receiving federal funds in the USA. Although the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act do not include purpose-bred rodents and birds, these species are equally regulated under Public Health Service policies that govern the IACUCs.Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. nih.govTitle 9 – Animals and Animal Products. Code of Federal Regulations. Vol. 1 (2008-01-01). Animal Welfare Act regulations are enforced by the USDA, whereas Public Health Service regulations are enforced by OLAW and in many cases by AAALAC.

===Numbers===

Accurate global figures for animal testing are difficult to obtain. The British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) estimates that 100 million vertebrates are experimented on around the world every year, 10–11 million of them in the European Union.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.buav.org/pdf/VivisectionFAQs.pdf |title=Vivisection FAQ |publisher=British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection[/tpl] The Nuffield Council on Bioethics reports that global annual estimates range from 50 to 100 million animals. None of the figures include invertebrates such as shrimp and fruit flies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/fileLibrary/pdf/RIA_Report_FINAL-opt.pdf |title=The Ethics of research involving animals|publisher= Nuffield Council on Bioethics[/tpl] Also not included in the figures are animals bred for research and then killed as surplus, animals used for breeding purposes, and animals not yet weaned.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the total number of animals used in that country in 2012 was almost 950,000,[tpl]cite web|url=http://speakingofresearch.com/2014/02/17/usda-statistics-for-animal-used-in-research-in-2012/ |title=USDA Statistics for Animals Used in Research in 2012 |publisher=Speaking of Research[/tpl] down from almost 1.2 million in 2005,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/downloads/awreports/awreport2005.pdf |title=2005 Report on Enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture |format=PDF[/tpl] but this figure does not include rats and mice, which make up about 90% of research animals.The humane care and treatment of laboratory animals.

(1995) "The Animal Research Controversy. Protest, Process and Public Policy: An Analysis of Strategic Issues." Tufts University, North Grafton. cited in Carbone 2004, p. 26. In 1986, the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment reported that estimates of the animals used in the U.S. range from 10 million to upwards of 100 million each year, and that their own best estimate was at least 17 million to 22 million.Alternatives to Animal Use in Research, Testing and Education, U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment, Washington, D.C.:Government Printing Office, 1986, p. 64. In 1966, the Laboratory Animal Breeders Association estimated in testimony before Congress that the number of mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and rabbits used in 1965 was around 60 million. (Hearings before the Subcommittee on Livestock and Feed Grains, Committee on Agriculture, U.S. House of Representatives, 1966, p. 63.) In 2004, the Department of Agriculture listed 64,932 dogs, 23,640 cats, 54,998 non-human primates, 244,104 guinea pigs, 175,721 hamsters, 261,573 rabbits, 105,678 farm animals, and 171,312 other mammals, a total of 1,101,958, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2004 from 195,157 to 64,932, and from 66,165 to 23,640, respectively. ("Foundation for Biomedical Research, Quick Facts)
In the UK, Home Office figures show that 4.11 million procedures were carried out in 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/the-animals/numbers-of-animals |title=Numbers of Animals Used in Research in UK |publisher=Understanding Animal Research[/tpl] 3,020 procedures used non-human primates, down over 50% since 1988."2012 Animal Research Statistics from the Home Office", Understanding Animal Research (2013) A "procedure" refers here to an experiment that might last minutes, several months, or years. Most animals are used in only one procedure: animals are frequently euthanized after the experiment; however death is the endpoint of some procedures.

===Invertebrates===

Although many more invertebrates than vertebrates are used in animal testing, these studies are largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. In the case of C. elegans, the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known,[tpl]cite journal |last1=Antoshechkin |first1=I |last2=Sternberg |first2=PW |title=The versatile worm: genetic and genomic resources for Caenorhabditis elegans research |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=518–32 |year=2007 |pmid=17549065 |doi=10.1038/nrg2105[/tpl] while studies in the fly D. melanogaster can use an amazing array of genetic tools.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Matthews |first1=KA |last2=Kaufman |first2=TC |last3=Gelbart |first3=WM |title=Research resources for Drosophila: the expanding universe |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=179–93 |year=2005 |pmid=15738962 |doi=10.1038/nrg1554[/tpl] These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing, including their short life cycle and the ease with which large numbers may be housed and studied. However, the lack of an adaptive immune system and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Schulenburg |first1=H |last2=Kurz |first2=CL |last3=Ewbank |first3=JJ |title=Evolution of the innate immune system: the worm perspective |journal=Immunological Reviews |volume=198 |pages=36–58 |year=2004 |pmid=15199953 |doi=10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.0125.x[/tpl] Similarly, the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans,[tpl]cite journal |last1=Leclerc |first1=V |last2=Reichhart |first2=JM |title=The immune response of Drosophila melanogaster |journal=Immunological Reviews |volume=198 |pages=59–71 |year=2004 |pmid=15199954 |doi=10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.0130.x[/tpl] and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates;[tpl]cite journal |last1=Mylonakis |first1=E |last2=Aballay |first2=A |title=Worms and flies as genetically tractable animal models to study host-pathogen interactions |journal=Infection and Immunity |volume=73 |issue=7 |pages=3833–41 |year=2005 |pmid=15972468 |pmc=1168613 |doi=10.1128/IAI.73.7.3833-3841.2005[/tpl] however, fruit flies and waxworms can be useful in studies to identify novel virulence factors or pharmacologically active compounds.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kavanagh K, Reeves EP|pmid=14975532|year=2004|title=Exploiting the potential of insects for in vivo pathogenicity testing of microbial pathogens|volume=28|issue=1|pages=101–12|doi=10.1016/j.femsre.2003.09.002|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022674|title=Deciphering the Multifactorial Nature of Acinetobacter baumannii Pathogenicity|year=2011|editor1-last=Adler|editor1-first=Ben|last1=Antunes|first1=Luísa C.

Several invertebrate systems are considered acceptable alternatives to vertebrates in early-stage discovery screens.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Waterfield NR, Sanchez-Contreras M, Eleftherianos I, Dowling A, Yang G, Wilkinson P, Parkhill J, Thomson N, Reynolds SE, Bode HB, Dorus S, Ffrench-Constant RH|doi=10.1073/pnas.0711114105|title=Rapid Virulence Annotation (RVA): Identification of virulence factors using a bacterial genome library and multiple invertebrate hosts|year=2008|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=105|issue=41|pages=15967 |bibcode = 2008PNAS..10515967W [/tpl] Because of similarities between the innate immune system of insects and mammals, insects can replace mammals in some types of studies. Drosophila melanogaster and the Galleria mellonella waxworm have been particularly important for analysis of virulence traits of mammalian pathogens. Waxworms and other insects have also proven valuable for the identification of pharmaceutical compounds with favorable bioavailability. The decision to adopt such models generally involves accepting a lower degree of biological similarity with mammals for significant gains in experimental throughput.

At the onset of sleep, the rat would either fall into the water only to clamber back to the pot to avoid drowning, or its nose would become submerged into the water shocking it back to an awakened state.In the U.S., the numbers of rats and mice used is estimated at 20 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils.

Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but genetic manipulation is much harder in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science.[tpl]cite journal |author=Aitman TJ, Critser JK, Cuppen E, Dominiczak A, Fernandez-Suarez XM, Flint J, Gauguier D, Geurts AM, Gould M, Harris PC, Holmdahl R, Hubner N, Izsvák Z, Jacob HJ, Kuramoto T, Kwitek AE, Marrone A, Mashimo T, Moreno C, Mullins J, Mullins L, Olsson T, Pravenec M, Riley L, Saar K, Serikawa T, Shull JD, Szpirer C, Twigger SN, Voigt B, Worley K |title=Progress and prospects in rat genetics: a community view |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=40 |pages=516–22 |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/ng.147 |issue=5 |pmid=18443588[/tpl] Nearly 200,000 fish and 20,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm67/6713/6713.pdf |title=Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, Great Britain|year= 2004|work= British government |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-07-13[/tpl] The main species used is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004. Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests (Draize test) because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies.

====Cats====

Cats are most commonly used in neurological research. Over 25,500 cats were used in the U.S. in 2000, around half of whom were used in experiments which, according to the American Anti-Vivisection Society, had the potential to cause "pain and/or distress".Cat madness: human research using cats. AAVS newsletter (Winter 2003)

====Dogs====

Dogs are widely used in biomedical research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle. They are used as models for human diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States.Dog profile, The Humane Society of the United States The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Welfare Report for 2005 shows that 66,000 dogs were used in USDA-registered facilities in that year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/downloads/awreports/awreport2005.pdf |title=2005 Report on Enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture |format=PDF[/tpl] In the U.S., some of the dogs are purpose-bred, while most are supplied by so-called Class B dealers licensed by the USDA to buy animals from auctions, shelters, newspaper ads, and who are sometimes accused of stealing pets.Gillham, Christina (2006-02-17). "Bought to be sold", Newsweek.

====Non-human primates====

Non-human primates (NHPs) are used in toxicology tests, studies of AIDS and hepatitis, studies of neurology, behavior and cognition, reproduction, genetics, and xenotransplantation. They are caught in the wild or purpose-bred. In the U.S. and China, most primates are domestically purpose-bred, whereas in Europe the majority are imported purpose-bred.International Perspectives: The Future of Nonhuman Primate Resources, Proceedings of the Workshop Held April 17–19, pages 36–45, 46–48, 63–69, 197–200. Rhesus monkeys, cynomolgus monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and owl monkeys are imported; around 12,000 to 15,000 monkeys are imported into the U.S. annually.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asp.org/research/faq.html |title=Primatology FAQ |publisher=Asp.org[/tpl] In total, around 70,000 NHPs are used each year in the United States and European Union. Most of the NHPs used are macaques; but marmosets, spider monkeys, and squirrel monkeys are also used, and baboons and chimpanzees are used in the U.S; in 2006 there were 1133 chimpanzees in U.S. primate centers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/315/5811/450 |title=Science article on chimps in the USA |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2012-07-13[/tpl] The first transgenic primate was produced in 2001, with the development of a method that could introduce new genes into a rhesus macaque.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Chan AW, Chong KY, Martinovich C, Simerly C, Schatten G |title=Transgenic monkeys produced by retroviral gene transfer into mature oocytes |journal=Science |volume=291 |issue=5502 |pages=309–12 |year=2001 |pmid=11209082 |doi=10.1126/science.291.5502.309|bibcode = 2001Sci...291..309C [/tpl] This transgenic technology is now being applied in the search for a treatment for the genetic disorder Huntington's disease.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Yang SH, Cheng PH, Banta H, et al. |title=Towards a transgenic model of Huntington's disease in a non-human primate |journal=Nature |volume=453 |issue=7197 |pages=921–4 |year=2008|pmid=18488016 |doi=10.1038/nature06975 |pmc=2652570|bibcode = 2008Natur.453..921Y [/tpl] Notable studies on non-human primates have been part of the polio vaccine development, and development of Deep Brain Stimulation, and their current heaviest non-toxicological use occurs in the monkey AIDS model, SIV.Kathleen M.

===Sources===

Animals used by laboratories are largely supplied by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied from a few main stock centers.Invertebrate Animal Resources. National Center for Research Resources. ncrr.nih.gov For vertebrates, sources include breeders who supply purpose-bred animals; businesses that trade in wild animals; and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters also supply the laboratories directly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aesop-project.org/Oversight.htm |title=Who's Who of Federal Oversight of Animal Issues |publisher=Aesop-project.org[/tpl] Large centers also exist to distribute strains of genetically modified animals; the International Knockout Mouse Consortium, for example, aims to provide knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome.[tpl]cite journal |author1=International Mouse Knockout Consortium |last2=Collins |first2=FS |last3=Rossant |first3=J |last4=Wurst |first4=W |title=A mouse for all reasons |journal=Cell |volume=128 |issue=1 |pages=9–13 |year=2007 |pmid=17218247 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.12.018[/tpl]
In the U.S., Class A breeders are licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to sell animals for research purposes, while Class B dealers are licensed to buy animals from "random sources" such as auctions, pound seizure, and newspaper ads. Some Class B dealers have been accused of kidnapping pets and illegally trapping strays, a practice known as bunching.Class B dealers, Humane Society of the United States."Who's Who of Federal Oversight of Animal Issues", Aesop Project.Salinger, Lawrence and Teddlie, Patricia.

It was in part out of public concern over the sale of pets to research facilities that the 1966 Laboratory Animal Welfare Act was ushered in—the Senate Committee on Commerce reported in 1966 that stolen pets had been retrieved from Veterans Administration facilities, the Mayo Institute, the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, and Harvard and Yale Medical Schools.Francione, Gary.

Four states in the U.S.—Minnesota, Utah, Oklahoma, and Iowa—require their shelters to provide animals to research facilities. Fourteen states explicitly prohibit the practice, while the remainder either allow it or have no relevant legislation.Animal Testing: Where Do the Animals Come From?. American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. According to the ASPCA, the following states prohibit shelters from providing animals for research: Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, and West Virginia.
In the European Union, animal sources are governed by Council Directive 86/609/EEC, which requires lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported and is not a wild animal or a stray. The latter requirement may also be exempted by special arrangement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31986L0609:EN:NOT |title=Council Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu [/tpl] In 2010 the Directive was revised with Directive 2010/63/EU.[tpl]cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32010L0063:EN:NOT |title=Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes Text with EEA relevance |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu [/tpl] In the UK, most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the 1988 Animal Protection Act, but wild-caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification can be established.Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm67/6713/6713.pdf |title="Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals", Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, Home Office|year= 2004| page=87 |format=PDF[/tpl] The United States also allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Over half the primates imported between 1995 and 2000 were handled by Charles River Laboratories, or by Covance, which is the single largest importer of primates into the U.S.U.S. Primate Imports Spike International Primate Protection League April 2007

===Pain and suffering===

The extent to which animal testing causes pain and suffering, and the capacity of animals to experience and comprehend them, is the subject of much debate.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Duncan |first1=IJ |last2=Petherick |first2=JC |title=The implications of cognitive processes for animal welfare |journal=Journal of animal science |volume=69 |issue=12 |pages=5017–22 |year=1991 |pmid=1808195[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Curtis |first1=SE |last2=Stricklin |first2=WR |title=The importance of animal cognition in agricultural animal production systems: an overview |journal=Journal of animal science |volume=69 |issue=12 |pages=5001–7 |year=1991 |pmid=1808193[/tpl]
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in 2006 about 670,000 animals (57%) (not including rats, mice, birds, or invertebrates) were used in procedures that did not include more than momentary pain or distress. About 420,000 (36%) were used in procedures in which pain or distress was relieved by anesthesia, while 84,000 (7%) were used in studies that would cause pain or distress that would not be relieved.
In the UK, research projects are classified as mild, moderate, and substantial in terms of the suffering the researchers conducting the study say they may cause; a fourth category of "unclassified" means the animal was anesthetized and killed without recovering consciousness, according to the researchers. In December 2001, 1,296 (39%) of project licenses in force were classified as mild, 1,811 (55%) as moderate, 63 (2%) as substantial, and 139 (4%) as unclassified.Ryder, Richard D. "Speciesism in the laboratory," in Singer, Peter. In Defense of Animals: The Second Wave. Blackwell, 2006. p. 99. There have, however, been suggestions of systemic underestimation of procedure severity.Townsend, Mark (2003-04-20). "Exposed: secrets of the animal organ lab", The Guardian. The Home Office response to these allegations is Imutran Ltd: Response to the Home Affairs Committee – licensing and regulating the xenotransplantation research, homeoffice.gov.uk (2003-10-14);
The idea that animals might not feel pain as human beings feel it traces back to the 17th-century French philosopher, René Descartes, who argued that animals do not experience pain and suffering because they lack consciousness.Carbone, p. 149. Bernard Rollin of Colorado State University, the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals,Rollin drafted the 1985 Health Research Extension Act and an animal welfare amendment to the 1985 Food Security Act: see Rollin, Bernard. "Animal research: a moral science. Talking Point on the use of animals in scientific research", EMBO reports 8, 6, 2007, pp. 521–525 writes that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain, and that veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain.Rollin, Bernard. The Unheeded Cry: Animal Consciousness, Animal Pain, and Science. New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp. xii, 117–118, cited in Carbone 2004, p. 150. In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians, he was regularly asked to "prove" that animals are conscious, and to provide "scientifically acceptable" grounds for claiming that they feel pain. Carbone writes that the view that animals feel pain differently is now a minority view. Academic reviews of the topic are more equivocal, noting that although the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support,[tpl]cite journal |last1=Griffin |first1=DR |last2=Speck |first2=GB |title=New evidence of animal consciousness |journal=Animal cognition |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=5–18 |year=2004 |pmid=14658059 |doi=10.1007/s10071-003-0203-x[/tpl] some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=C |title=Assessing animal cognition: ethological and philosophical perspectives |journal=Journal of animal science |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=42–7 |year=1998 |pmid=9464883[/tpl] The ability of invertebrate species of animals, such as insects, to feel pain and suffering is also unclear.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Lockwood |first1=J. A. |title=The Moral Standing of Insects and the Ethics of Extinction |journal=The Florida Entomologist |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=70–89 |year=1987 |doi=10.2307/3495093 |jstor=3495093[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Degrazia |first1=David |last2=Rowan |first2=Andrew |title=Pain, suffering, and anxiety in animals and humans |journal=Theoretical Medicine |volume=12 |pages=193–211 |year=1991 |doi=10.1007/BF00489606 |issue=3 |pmid=1754965[/tpl]
The defining text on animal welfare regulation—the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals—defines the parameters that govern animal testing in the USA. It states "The ability to experience and respond to pain is widespread in the animal kingdom...Pain is a stressor and, if not relieved, can lead to unacceptable levels of stress and distress in animals.""Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals", ILAR, National Research Council, National Academies Press, 1996, p. 64, ISBN 0309053773. The Guide states that the ability to recognize the symptoms of pain in different species is vital in efficiently applying pain relief and that it is essential for the people caring for and using animals to be entirely familiar with these symptoms. On the subject of analgesics used to relieve pain, the Guide states "The selection of the most appropriate analgesic or anesthetic should reflect professional judgment as to which best meets clinical and humane requirements without compromising the scientific aspects of the research protocol". Accordingly, all issues of animal pain and distress, and their potential treatment with analgesia and anesthesia, are required regulatory issues in receiving animal protocol approval.

===Euthanasia===

Regulations require that scientists use as few animals as possible, especially for terminal experiments. However, while policy makers consider suffering to be the central issue and see animal euthanasia as a way to reduce suffering, others, such as the RSPCA, argue that the lives of laboratory animals have intrinsic value.Animal Procedures Committee: review of cost-benefit assessment in the use of animals in research The Animal Procedures Committee, June 2003 p46-7 Regulations focus on whether particular methods cause pain and suffering, not whether their death is undesirable in itself.Carbone, Larry. "Euthanasia," in Bekoff, M. and Meaney, C. Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Welfare. Greenwood Publishing Group, pp. 164–166, cited in Carbone 2004, pp. 189–190. The animals are euthanized at the end of studies for sample collection or post-mortem examination; during studies if their pain or suffering falls into certain categories regarded as unacceptable, such as depression, infection that is unresponsive to treatment, or the failure of large animals to eat for five days;[tpl]cite web|author=Dale Cooper |url=http://www.ahc.umn.edu/rar/euthanasia.html |title="Euthanasia Guidelines", Research animal resources|publisher=University of Minnesota[/tpl] or when they are unsuitable for breeding or unwanted for some other reason.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://si.pcarp.usp.br/pages/ceua/eutanasia/LA1.PDF%7C|title=Recommendations for euthanasia of experimental animals: Part 1|pmid=8938617|pages=293–316 (295)|year=1996|author=Close B, Banister K, Baumans V, Bernoth EM, Bromage N, Bunyan J, Erhardt W, Flecknell P, Gregory N, Hackbarth H, Morton D, Warwick C|volume=30|issue=4|journal=Laboratory animals|doi=10.1258/002367796780739871[/tpl]
Methods of euthanizing laboratory animals are chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress."Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals", ILAR, National Research Council, National Academies Press, 1996, p. 65, ISBN 0309053773. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal can be made to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.avma.org/resources/euthanasia.pdf |title=AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia, June 2007 edition, Report of the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia |publisher=Avma.org [/tpl]

==Research classification==

===Pure research===

Basic or pure research investigates how organisms behave, develop, and function. Those opposed to animal testing object that pure research may have little or no practical purpose, but researchers argue that it forms the necessary basis for the development of applied research, rendering the distinction between pure and applied research—research that has a specific practical aim—unclear."Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures Report", House of Lords, July 16, 2002. See chapter 3: "The purpose and nature of animal experiments." Retrieved July 6, 2010. Pure research uses larger numbers and a greater variety of animals than applied research. Fruit flies, nematode worms, mice and rats together account for the vast majority, though small numbers of other species are used, ranging from sea slugs through to armadillos.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Job |first1=CK |title=Nine-banded armadillo and leprosy research |journal=Indian journal of pathology & microbiology |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=541–50 |year=2003 |pmid=15025339[/tpl] Examples of the types of animals and experiments used in basic research include:

===Applied research===

Applied research aims to solve specific and practical problems. Compared to pure research, which is largely academic in origin, applied research is usually carried out in the pharmaceutical industry, or by universities in commercial partnerships. These may involve the use of animal models of diseases or conditions, which are often discovered or generated by pure research programmes. In turn, such applied studies may be an early stage in the drug discovery process. Examples include:

====Xenotransplantation====

Xenotransplantation research involves transplanting tissues or organs from one species to another, as a way to overcome the shortage of human organs for use in organ transplants.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Platt |first1=JL |last2=Lin |first2=SS |title=The future promises of xenotransplantation |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=862 |pages=5–18 |year=1998 |pmid=9928201 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09112.x|bibcode = 1998NYASA.862....5P [/tpl] Current research involves using primates as the recipients of organs from pigs that have been genetically modified to reduce the primates' immune response against the pig tissue.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Schuurman |first1=HJ |last2=Pierson Rn |first2=3rd |title=Progress towards clinical xenotransplantation |journal=Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library |volume=13 |pages=204–20 |year=2008 |pmid=17981539 |doi=10.2741/2671 |issue=13[/tpl] Although transplant rejection remains a problem, recent clinical trials that involved implanting pig insulin-secreting cells into diabetics did reduce these people's need for insulin.[tpl]cite journal |author=Valdés-González RA, Dorantes LM, Garibay GN, Bracho-Blanchet E, Mendez AJ, Dávila-Pérez R, Elliott RB, Terán L, White DJ|title=Xenotransplantation of porcine neonatal islets of Langerhans and Sertoli cells: a 4-year study |journal=European Journal of Endocrinology |volume=153 |issue=3 |pages=419–27 |year=2005 |pmid=16131605 |doi=10.1530/eje.1.01982[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Valdés-González RA, White DJ, Dorantes LM, Terán L, Garibay-Nieto GN, Bracho-Blanchet E, Dávila-Pérez R, Evia-Viscarra L, Ormsby CE, Ayala-Sumuano JT, Silva-Torres ML, Ramírez-González B |title=Three-yr follow-up of a type 1 diabetes mellitus patient with an islet xenotransplant |journal=Clinical transplantation |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=352–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17488384 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0012.2007.00648.x[/tpl]
Documents released to the news media by the animal rights organization Uncaged Campaigns showed that, between 1994 and 2000, wild baboons imported to the UK from Africa by Imutran Ltd, a subsidiary of Novartis Pharma AG, in conjunction with Cambridge University and Huntingdon Life Sciences, to be used in experiments that involved grafting pig tissues, suffered serious and sometimes fatal injuries. A scandal occurred when it was revealed that the company had communicated with the British government in an attempt to avoid regulation.Townsend, Mark (2003-04-20).

===Toxicology testing===

Toxicology testing, also known as safety testing, is conducted by pharmaceutical companies testing drugs, or by contract animal testing facilities, such as Huntingdon Life Sciences, on behalf of a wide variety of customers.Household Product Tests BUAV According to 2005 EU figures, around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests; which are about 10% of all procedures.Fifth Report on the Statistics on the Number of Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes in the Member States of the European Union, Commission of the European Communities, published November 2007 According to Nature, 5,000 animals are used for each chemical being tested, with 12,000 needed to test pesticides.[tpl]cite journal|author=Abbott, Alison|pmid=16281001|url=http://ethics.ucsd.edu/journal/2006/readings/Animal_Testing_More_than_a_cosmetic_change.pdf|title=Animal testing: More than a cosmetic change|journal=Nature|volume= 438|pages= 144–146|year=2005|doi=10.1038/438144a|issue=7065|bibcode = 2005Natur.438..144A [/tpl] The tests are conducted without anesthesia, because interactions between drugs can affect how animals detoxify chemicals, and may interfere with the results.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Watkins J |first1=3rd |title=Exposure of rats to inhalational anesthetics alters the hepatobiliary clearance of cholephilic xenobiotics |journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume=250 |issue=2 |pages=421–7 |year=1989 |pmid=2760837[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Watt |first1=JA |last2=Dickinson |first2=RG |title=The effect of diethyl ether, pentobarbitone and urethane anaesthesia on diflunisal conjugation and disposition in rats |journal=Xenobiotica |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=289–301 |year=1990 |pmid=2336839 |doi=10.3109/00498259009046848[/tpl]
Toxicology tests are used to examine finished products such as pesticides, medications, food additives, packing materials, and air freshener, or their chemical ingredients. Most tests involve testing ingredients rather than finished products, but according to BUAV, manufacturers believe these tests overestimate the toxic effects of substances; they therefore repeat the tests using their finished products to obtain a less toxic label.
The substances are applied to the skin or dripped into the eyes; injected intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously; inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them, or by placing them in an inhalation chamber; or administered orally, through a tube into the stomach, or simply in the animal's food. Doses may be given once, repeated regularly for many months, or for the lifespan of the animal.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
There are several different types of acute toxicity tests. The [tpl]LD50[/tpl] ("Lethal Dose 50%") test is used to evaluate the toxicity of a substance by determining the dose required to kill 50% of the test animal population. This test was removed from OECD international guidelines in 2002, replaced by methods such as the fixed dose procedure, which use fewer animals and cause less suffering.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Walum |first1=E |title=Acute oral toxicity |journal=Environmental health perspectives |volume=106 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=497–503 |year=1998 |pmid=9599698 |pmc=1533392 |doi=10.2307/3433801[/tpl]Inter-Governmental Organization Eliminates the LD50 Test, The Humane Society of the United States (2003-02-05) Abbott writes that, as of 2005, "the LD50 acute toxicity test ... still accounts for one-third of all animal toxicity tests worldwide."
Irritancy can be measured using the Draize test, where a test substance is applied to an animal's eyes or skin, usually an albino rabbit. For Draize eye testing, the test involves observing the effects of the substance at intervals and grading any damage or irritation, but the test should be halted and the animal killed if it shows "continuing signs of severe pain or distress".OECD guideline 405, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Humane Society of the United States writes that the procedure can cause redness, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or even blindness.Species Used in Research: Rabbit, Humane Society of the United States This test has also been criticized by scientists for being cruel and inaccurate, subjective, over-sensitive, and failing to reflect human exposures in the real world.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Wilhelmus |first1=KR |title=The Draize eye test |journal=Survey of ophthalmology |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=493–515 |year=2001 |pmid=11425356 |doi=10.1016/S0039-6257(01)00211-9[/tpl] Although no accepted in vitro alternatives exist, a modified form of the Draize test called the low volume eye test may reduce suffering and provide more realistic results and this was adopted as the new standard in September 2009.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Secchi |first1=A |last2=Deligianni |first2=V |title=Ocular toxicology: the Draize eye test |journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=367–72 |year=2006 |pmid=16954791 |doi=10.1097/01.all.0000244798.26110.00[/tpl]Draize rabbit eye test replacement milestone welcomed. Dr Hadwen Trust (2009-09-21) However, the Draize test will still be used for substances that are not severe irritants.
The most stringent tests are reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting less than a month (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.
These toxicity tests provide, in the words of a 2006 United States National Academy of Sciences report, "critical information for assessing hazard and risk potential".Toxicity Testing for Assessment of Environmental Agents" National Academies Press, (2006), p. 21.

====Cosmetics testing====

Cosmetics testing on animals is particularly controversial. Such tests, which are still conducted in the U.S., involve general toxicity, eye and skin irritancy, phototoxicity (toxicity triggered by ultraviolet light) and mutagenicity.Stephens, Martin & Rowan, Andrew. An overview of Animal Testing Issues, Humane Society of the United States
Cosmetics testing on animals is banned in India, the European Union, Israel and Norway[tpl]cite news|title=India Joins the EU and Israel in Surpassing the US in Cruelty-Free Cosmetics Testing Policy|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/monica-engebretson/cruelty-free-cosmetics-testing_b_3605460.html|date=March 16, 2014|author=Engebretson, Monica|publisher=The World Post[/tpl][tpl]cite press release|title=Cruelty Free International Applauds Congressman Jim Moran for Bill to End Cosmetics Testing on Animals in the United States|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/05/bc-cfi-idUSnPnpHM6w1+98+PRN20140305|date=March 5, 2014|author=|publisher=[/tpl] while legislation in the U.S. and Brazil is currently considering similar bans.[tpl]cite press release|title=Animal Attraction: Federal Bill to End Cosmetics Testing on Animals Introduced in Congress|url=http://www.khou.com/community/blogs/animal-attraction/Animal-Attraction---249254631.html|date=March 10, 2014|author=Fox, Stacy|publisher=Humane Society of the United States[/tpl] In 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union agreed to phase in a near-total ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics by 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company, L'Oreal, has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, asking that the ban be quashed. The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy.Osborn, Andrew & Gentleman, Amelia."Secret French move to block animal-testing ban", The Guardian (2003-08-19). Retrieved February 27, 2008.

===Drug testing===

Before the early 20th century, laws regulating drugs were lax. Currently, all new pharmaceuticals undergo rigorous animal testing before being licensed for human use. Tests on pharmaceutical products involve:

===Education===

Animals are also used for education. The Sonoran Arthropod Institute hosts an annual Invertebrates in Education and Conservation Conference to discuss the use of invertebrates in education.http://neurosci.arizona.edu/iecc There also are efforts in many countries to find alternatives to using animals in education.Dalal, Rooshin et al. Replacement Alternatives in Education: Animal-Free Teaching abstract from Fifth World Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life Sciences, Berlin, August 2005.
In November 2013, the US-based company Backyard Brains released for sale to the public what they call the "Roboroach", an "electronic backpack" that can be attached to cockroaches. The operator is required to amputate a cockroach's antennae, use sandpaper to wear down the shell, insert a wire into the thorax, and then glue the electrodes and circuit board onto the insect's back. A mobile phone app can then be used to control it via Bluetooth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24455141|title=Row over US mobile phone 'cockroach backpack' app|publisher=BBC News|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=9 November 2013[/tpl] It has been suggested that the use of such a device may be a teaching aid that can promote interest in science. The makers of the "Roboroach" have been funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and state that the device is intended to encourage children to become interested in neuroscience.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/11/01/cyborg-cockroaches-are-coming-but-not-if-peta-has-anything-to-say-about-it/|title=Resistance is Futile: PETA Attempts to Halt the Sale of Remote-Controlled Cyborg Cockroaches|work=Time|date=1 November 2013|author=Hamilton, Anita|accessdate=10 November 2013[/tpl]

===Defense===

Animals are used by the military to develop weapons, vaccines, battlefield surgical techniques, and defensive clothing. For example, in 2008 the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency used live pigs to study the effects of improvised explosive device explosions on internal organs, especially the brain.Brook, Tom Vanden, "Brain Study, Animal Rights Collide", USA Today (2009-04-07), p. 1.
In the US military, goats are commonly used to train combat medics. (Goats have become the main animal species used for this purpose after the Pentagon phased out using dogs for medical training in the 1980s.) While modern mannequins used in medical training are quite efficient in simulating the behavior of a human body, trainees feel that "the goat exercise provides a sense of urgency that only real life trauma can provide".  Besides the US, six other NATO countries, including Poland and Denmark, use live animals for combat medic training.

==Ethics==

===Viewpoints===

The ethical questions raised by performing experiments on animals are subject to much debate, and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the 20th century.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Rollin |first1=Bernard E. |title=The Regulation of Animal Research and the Emergence of Animal Ethics: A Conceptual History |journal=Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics |volume=27 |pages=285–304 |year=2006 |doi=10.1007/s11017-006-9007-8 | pmid=16937023 |issue=4[/tpl] There remain disagreements about which procedures are useful for which purposes, as well as disagreements over which ethical principles apply to which species. The dominant ethical position worldwide is that achievement of scientific and medical goals using animal testing is desirable, so long as animal suffering and use is minimized.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/pl99198.htm |title=1985 Amendment to Animal Welfare Act |publisher=Nal.usda.gov |accessdate=2012-07-13[/tpl] The British government has additionally required that the cost to animals in an experiment be weighed against the gain in knowledge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15003.htm |title=Summary of House of Lords Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures |publisher=UK Parliament|date=2002-07-24 |accessdate=2012-07-13[/tpl] Some medical schools and agencies in China, Japan, and South Korea have built cenotaphs for killed animals.韓国・食薬庁で「実験動物慰霊祭」挙行 In Japan there are also annual memorial services (Ireisai 慰霊祭) for animals sacrificed at medical school.
A wide range of minority viewpoints exist. The view that animals have moral rights (animal rights) is a philosophical position proposed by Tom Regan, among others, who argues that animals are beings with beliefs and desires, and as such are the "subjects of a life" with moral value and therefore moral rights.Singer, Peter (ed.). "A Companion to Ethics". Blackwell Companions to Philosophy, 1991. Regan still sees ethical differences between killing human and non-human animals, and argues that to save the former it is permissible to kill the latter. Likewise, a "moral dilemma" view suggests that avoiding potential benefit to humans is unacceptable on similar grounds, and holds the issue to be a dilemma in balancing such harm to humans to the harm done to animals in research.Page 244, Chapter 14, Discussion of ethical issues in: The ethics of research involving animals at the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. Published 25 05 2005 In contrast, an abolitionist view in animal rights holds that there is no moral justification for any harmful research on animals that is not to the benefit of the individual animal. Bernard Rollin argues that benefits to human beings cannot outweigh animal suffering, and that human beings have no moral right to use an animal in ways that do not benefit that individual. Another prominent position is that of philosopher Peter Singer, who argues that there are no grounds to include a being's species in considerations of whether their suffering is important in utilitarian moral considerations.Rollin, Bernard E. (1998) "The moral status of animals and their use as experimental subjects," in Kuhse, Helga and Singer, Peter (eds.). "A Companion to Bioethics". Blackwell Publishing, ISBN 063123019X.

Concerns have been raised over the mistreatment of primates undergoing testing. In 1985 the case of Britches, a macaque monkey at the University of California, Riverside, gained public attention. He had his eyelids sewn shut and a sonar sensor on his head as part of an experiment to test sensory substitution devices for blind people. The laboratory was raided by Animal Liberation Front in 1985, removing Britches and 466 other animals.Franklin, Ben A. (1987-08-30) "Going to Extremes for 'Animal Rights'", The New York Times. The National Institutes of Health conducted an eight-month investigation and concluded, however, that no corrective action was necessary.[tpl]cite journal|author=Holden, Constance|pmid=3952503|year=1986|title=A pivotal year for lab animal welfare|volume=232|issue=4747|pages=147–50|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.3952503|bibcode = 1986Sci...232..147H [/tpl] During the 2000s other cases have made headlines, include experiments at the University of CambridgeLaville, Sandra (2005-02-08).

===Threats to researchers===

In 2006, a primate researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shut down the experiments in his lab after threats from animal rights activists. The researcher had received a grant to use 30 macaque monkeys for vision experiments; each monkey was anesthetized for a single physiological experiment lasting up to 120 hours, and then euthanized.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Malone |first1=B. J. |last2=Kumar |first2=V. R. |last3=Ringach |first3=D.

Demonstrations were held in front of his home. A Molotov cocktail was placed on the porch of what was believed to be the home of another UCLA primate researcher; instead, it was accidentally left on the porch of an elderly woman unrelated to the university. The Animal Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the attack.Epstein, David (2006-08-22). Throwing in the Towel, Inside Higher Education As a result of the campaign, the researcher sent an email to the Primate Freedom Project stating "you win," and "please don't bother my family anymore."Predators Unleashed, Investor's Business Daily (2006-08-24) In another incident at UCLA in June 2007, the Animal Liberation Brigade placed a bomb under the car of a UCLA children's ophthalmologist who experiments on cats and rhesus monkeys; the bomb had a faulty fuse and did not detonate.McDonald, Patrick Range (2007-08-08). UCLA Monkey Madness, LA Weekly''. UCLA is now refusing Freedom of Information Act requests for animal medical records.
These attacks, as well as similar incidents that caused the Southern Poverty Law Center to declare in 2002 that the animal rights movement had "clearly taken a turn toward the more extreme," this prompted the US government to pass the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act and the UK government to add the offense of "Intimidation of persons connected with animal research organisation" to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005.[tpl]cite journal |title=When animal rights turns ugly |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=26 |pages=603–5 |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/nbt0608-603 |issue=6 |pmid=18536673 |last1=Huggett |first1=B[/tpl] Such legislation, and the arrest and imprisonment of extremists may have decreased the incidence of attacks.Herbert, Ian (2007-01-27).

==Alternatives to animal testing==

Many scientists and governments state that animal testing should cause as little suffering to animals as possible, and that animal tests should only be performed where necessary. The "Three Rs"[tpl]Cite journal|author=Flecknell P |title=Replacement, reduction and refinement |journal=ALTEX |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=73–8 |year=2002 |pmid=12098013[/tpl] are guiding principles for the use of animals in research in most countries.
