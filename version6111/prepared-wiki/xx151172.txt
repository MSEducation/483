Panties Productions is an all-female Canadian theatre company from Edmonton, Alberta. It was founded in 2002 by Jocelyn Ahlf, Belinda Cornish, Jana O'Connor, Celina Stachow and Dana Wylie. The company has since produced six original plays (including Hump, Paradise City, and Princess) and earned nine Elizabeth Sterling Haynes Award nominations. They have also toured across Canada with their musical Burlesque.
In 2005, they received an Elizabeth Sterling Haynes Award for their surreal sketch comedy show Lobster Telephone, co-written with Mark Meer, which then toured to Dad's Garage Theatre Company in Atlanta, and the Improv Olympic West in Los Angeles. Panties Productions works with and has been fostered by Rapid Fire Theatre.
