The Octopus card is a reusable contactless stored value smart card for making electronic payments in online or offline systems in Hong Kong. Launched in September 1997 to collect fares for the territory's mass transit system, the Octopus card system is the second contactless smart card system in the world, after the Korean Upass, and has since grown into a widely used payment system for all public transport in Hong Kong,[tpl]cite web|url=http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/External/lac/lac.nsf/Sectors/Transport/D5A576A039A802C0852568B2007988AD?OpenDocument|title=Hong Kong Smart Card System|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=13 February 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070304050613/http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/External/lac/lac.nsf/Sectors/Transport/D5A576A039A802C0852568B2007988AD?OpenDocument |archivedate = 4 March 4 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] leading to the development of Oyster Card in London.
The Octopus has also grown to be used for payment in many retail shops in Hong Kong, from convenience stores, supermarkets, fast-food restaurants, on-street parking meters, car parks, to other point-of-sale applications such as service stations and vending machines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/en/index.jsp|title=Octopus Products|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=21 February 2007[/tpl]
The Octopus card is recognised internationally, winning the Chairman's Award of the World Information Technology and Services Alliance's 2006 Global IT Excellence Award for being the world's leading complex automatic fare collection and contactless smartcard payment system, and for its innovative use of technologies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.witsa.org/press/05-04-06_WITSA_AWARDS_rev.doc|title=WITSA Announces 2006 Global IT Excellence Award Winners|publisher=World Information Technology and Services Alliance|date=4 May 2006|accessdate=1 May 2007|format=DOC[/tpl] According to Octopus Cards Limited, operator of the Octopus card system, there are more than 20 million cards in circulation,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/octopus-for-businesses/benefits-for-your-business/en/index.html|title=Statistics|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=14 November 2010[/tpl] nearly three times the population of Hong Kong. The cards are used by 95% of the population of Hong Kong aged 16 to 65, generating over 12 million daily transactions worth a total over HK$130 million.
The slogan of Octopus Card Limited and its products (the cards) is Making Everyday Life Easier,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/home/en/index.html|title=Homepage|publisher= Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=14 November 2010[/tpl] which is part of the mission statement of the corporation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/mission/en/index.jsp|title=Octopus Holdings Mission|publisher= Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=2 July 2009[/tpl]

==History==

Previously, Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) adopted a system to recirculate magnetic plastic cards as fare tickets when it started operations in 1979. Another of the territory's railway networks, the Kowloon-Canton Railway (KCR), adopted the same magnetic cards in 1984, and the stored value version was renamed Common Stored Value Ticket. In 1989, the Common Stored Value Ticket system was extended to Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) buses providing a feeder service to MTR and KCR stations and to Citybus, and was also extended to a limited number of non-transport applications, such as payments at photobooths and for fast food vouchers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tradelink-ebiz.com/english/331n08or3m9a51l/newscast/ss_0412a.html|title=Our winning card|publisher=Tradelink Electronic Commerce Limited|date=January 2005|accessdate=21 April 2007[/tpl]
The MTR Corporation eventually decided to adopt more advanced technologies, and in 1993 announced that it would move towards using contactless smartcards. To gain wider acceptance, it partnered with four other major transit companies in Hong Kong to create a joint-venture business to operate the Octopus system in 1994, then known as Creative Star Limited.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/history/en/index.jsp|title=Our History|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|accessdate=17 May 2007[/tpl]
The Octopus system was launched after three years of trials on 1 September 1997.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/publications/economicperspectives/ep_4qtr2005_part3_clark_.pdf|title=Shopping without cash: The emergence of the e-purse|author=Carol L. Clark|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|year=2005|format=PDF|page=12|accessdate=22 March 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070621111847/http://www.chicagofed.org/publications/economicperspectives/ep_4qtr2005_part3_clark_.pdf |archivedate = 21 June 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Three million cards were issued within the first three months of the system's launch. The quick success of the system was compelled by the fact that MTR and KCR required all holders of Common Stored Value Tickets to replace their tickets with Octopus cards in three months or have their tickets made obsolete, which drove commuters to switch quickly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ln.edu.hk/socsp/staff/luciaindex.php#publications|title=Coercing Consensus: Unintended success of the Octopus electronic payment system|publisher=the 6th International Conference on Politics and Information Systems, Technologies and Applications (PISTA)|author=Lucia L.S. Siu|date=June 2008|accessdate=30 June 2008[/tpl] Another reason was the coin shortage in Hong Kong in 1997. With the transfer of Hong Kong away from British rule, there was a belief that the older Queen's Head coins in Hong Kong would appreciate in value, so many people hoarded these older coins and waited for their value to increase.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sc.info.gov.hk/gb/www.fstb.gov.hk/fsb/ppr/press/p980218e.htm|title=Supply of new coins will continue|publisher=Hong Kong SAR Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau|date=18 February 1998|accessdate=25 April 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/hkma/eng/public/ar97/ch04.htm|title=Hong Kong Monetary Authority Annual Report 1997|publisher=Hong Kong Monetary Authority|year=1997|accessdate=25 April 2007[/tpl]
The Octopus system was quickly adopted by other Creative Star joint venture partners, and KMB reported that by 2000, most bus journeys were completed using an Octopus card, with few coins used.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kmb.hk/english.php?page=next&file=news/service/news3q03/news2003112701.html|title=Development of KMB's Octopus Payment System|publisher=The Kowloon Motor Bus Company|accessdate=25 April 2007[/tpl] Boarding a bus in Hong Kong without using the Octopus card requires giving exact change, making it cumbersome compared to using the Octopus card. By November 1998, 4.6 million cards were issued, and this rose to 9 million by January 2002.
In 2000, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority granted a deposit-taking company license to the operator, removing previous restrictions that prohibited Octopus from generating more than 15 percent of its turnover from non-transit related functions. This allowed the Octopus card to be widely adopted for non-transit-related sales transactions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss48.pdf|title=Survey of electronic money developments|publisher=Bank for International Settlements|date=November 2001|accessdate=16 April 2007|format=PDF[/tpl] On 29 June 2003, the Octopus card found another application when the Hong Kong Government started to replace all its 18,000 parking meters with a new Octopus card operated system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200306/27/0627317.htm|title=Octopus-card operated parking meters to launch on 29 June|publisher=Hong Kong SAR Government|date=27 June 2003|accessdate=25 April 2007[/tpl] The replacement was completed on 21 November 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.td.gov.hk/transport_in_hong_kong/parking/carparks/octopus_operated_parking_meters/index.htm|title=Octopus operated Parking Meter|publisher=Transport Department of the HKSAR|date=19 July 2005|accessdate=11 April 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071130032827/http://www.td.gov.hk/transport_in_hong_kong/parking/carparks/octopus_operated_parking_meters/index.htm |archivedate = 30 November 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

==Etymologies and logo==

The Cantonese name for the Octopus card, Baat Daaht Tùng ([tpl]zh|t=[tpl]linktext|八|達|通[/tpl][/tpl]), translates literally as "eight-arrived pass" (though in Chinese it was accepted as "go-everywhere pass"), where Baat Daaht may translate as "reaching everywhere". It was selected by the head of the MTR Corporation, the parent company of Octopus Cards Limited, in a naming competition held in 1996.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/milestones/tc/index.jsp|title=八達通控股有限公司里程碑 (lit. Milestones of Octopus Holdings Limited)|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|accessdate=28 February 2007|language=Traditional Chinese[/tpl] The number eight refers to the cardinal and ordinal directions, and the four-character idiom sei tùng baat daaht ([tpl]zh|t=[tpl]linktext|四|通|八|達[/tpl][/tpl]), a common expression loosely translated as "reachable in all directions".[tpl]cite dictionary|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Chinese Idioms|url=http://dict.idioms.moe.edu.tw/pho/fyb/fyb01352.htm|title=四通八達|publisher=Ministry of Education, R.O.C.|location=Taipei, Taiwan|accessdate=16 June 2010|language=Traditional Chinese[/tpl] It is also considered a lucky number in Chinese culture, and the phrase baat daaht can possibly be associated with the similar-sounding faat daaht, which means "getting rich" ([tpl]zh|t=[tpl]linktext|發|達[/tpl][/tpl]) in the local dialect.
The English name Octopus card was also selected from the naming competition,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/milestones/en/index.jsp|title=Octopus Holdings Milestones|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|accessdate=28 February 2007[/tpl] and coincides with the number eight in the Cantonese name, since an octopus has eight tentacles.
The logo used on the card features a Möbius strip in the shape of an infinity symbol.

==Types of cards==

There are two main types of Octopus card (On-Loan and Sold), and two less common types (the Airport Express Tourist and the MTR Airport Staff).
On-Loan cards are issued for usage in day-to-day functions, primarily for fare payment in transport systems. They are further classified into Child, Adult, Elder, and Personalised categories, with the first three based on age and different amounts of fare concession.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/cardtype/en/loan.jsp|title=On-Loan Octopus|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=13 February 2007[/tpl] With the exception of the Personalised cards, On-Loan cards are anonymous; no personal information, bank account, or credit card details are stored on the card,[tpl]cite web|url=http://rfid.idtechex.com/knowledgebase/en/casestudy.asp?freefromsection=114|title=Hong Kong Octopus financial/transport card, China|publisher=The RFID Knowledgebase|date=19 November 2006|accessdate=21 February 2007[/tpl] and no identification is required for the purchase of these cards. If an owner loses a card, only the stored value and the deposit of the card are lost. On-Loan Octopus cards may be purchased at all MTR stations, the KMB Customer Service Centre, New World First Ferry (NWFF) Octopus Service Centres, and the New World First Bus (NWFB) Customer Service Centre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/apply/en/index.jsp|title=How to get Your Octopus|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=21 February 2007[/tpl] A student on-loan Octopus Card was initially issued, but was discontinued in 2005.[tpl]cite news|title=已停售學生八達通 港鐵多扣錢 (lit. MTR deduces extra fare from the obsoleted Student Octopus card)|publisher=Ming Pao|language=Traditional Chinese|date=2 December 2007[/tpl]
The rainbow-coloured Personalised card is available on registration. The name and, if opted, a photo of the holder are imprinted on the cards. They can function automatically as a Child, Adult, or Elder card by recognising the cardholder's age stored on the card, hence accounting for different concessionary fares. As of 2003, there were 380,000 holders of Personalised Octopus cards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200305/21/0521207.htm|title=LCQ4 : Octopus card has a maximum reserved value of $35|publisher=Hong Kong SAR Government Information Centre|date=21 May 2003|accessdate=13 May 2007[/tpl] In addition to all the functions of an ordinary card, this card can be used as a key card for access to residential and office buildings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/other/access/en/index.jsp|title=Access Control|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=21 February 2007[/tpl] If a Personalised card is lost, the holder may report the loss by phone to prevent unauthorised use of the card. A refund would then be issued to the holder of the card for the deposit and the value that remained on the card six hours after the loss is reported, minus a HK$30 card cost and a HK$20 handling fee.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/report/en/index.jsp|title=Lost Card Reporting|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=15 February 2007[/tpl]
A Personalised card with "student status" is available for students in Hong Kong. To be eligible for this card, the applicant must be a full-time Hong Kong student aged between 12 and 25.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/whatsnew/studentoct/studoct0607_e.htm|title=Student Travel Scheme (Academic year 2006 / 2007)|publisher=MTR Corporation|accessdate=15 February 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070311043623/http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/whatsnew/studentoct/studoct0607_e.htm |archivedate = 11 March 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] This type of Personalised card is automatically issued to a student who applies for student concessionary privileges. Additionally, they can be used for school administrative tasks such as the recording of student attendance and the management of library loans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/other/campuses/en/index.jsp|title=School Campuses|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=21 February 2007[/tpl]
In contrast to On-Loan cards, Sold cards are sponsored and branded cards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/cardtype/en/sold.jsp|title=Sold Octopus|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=13 February 2007[/tpl] They are souvenir cards that are frequently released by Octopus Cards Limited. The designs for these cards usually come from fictional characters in popular culture, or they are inspired by Chinese cultural events such as Chinese New Year. These cards are sold at a premium, have limited or no initial stored value, and cannot be refunded, but they can otherwise be used as ordinary cards. An example of the Sold card is the Mcmug and Mcdull collection. It was launched at the end of January 2007 to coincide with the beginning of the Year of the Pig, it features two differently designed versions of the card and is sold for HK$138 per set. Each set comes with an Adult Octopus card, with a pouch for the card, a matching strap and a Mcmug or Mcdull ornament.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20070129.jsp|title=Launch of Mcmug and Mcdull Limited Edition Octopus to Greet the Year of the Pig|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|date=29 January 2007|accessdate=16 February 2007[/tpl] Octopus Cards Limited has launched new collections of these cards for such occasions as the Mid-Autumn Festival, the passing of the year 2004, and the release of the movie DragonBlade. Sold Octopus cards may be purchased at selected MTR stations, and all 7-Eleven stores.
The special-purpose card, Airport Express Tourist Octopus, was introduced by Octopus Cards Limited to target tourists in Hong Kong. Two versions of this card are offered, a HK$220 card with a free single ride on the Airport Express, the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) train line that runs between the Hong Kong International Airport and the urban areas of Hong Kong, and a HK$300 card with two free single rides included. The airport journeys are valid for 180 days from the date of purchase. Both versions allow three days of unlimited rides on the MTR and include a HK$50 refundable deposit. Usable value on these cards may be added if necessary. These tourist Octopus cards may be used only by tourists staying in Hong Kong for 14 or fewer days; users may be required to produce a passport showing their arrival date in Hong Kong. Airport Express Tourist Octopus is available for purchase at all MTR stations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/tourists/en/index.jsp|title=Octopus for Tourists|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=21 February 2007[/tpl]
The other special-purpose card, the MTR Airport Staff Octopus, is available for the staff of Hong Kong International Airport and AsiaWorld-Expo, a convention centre close to the airport, for commuting at a reduced fare between the airport and MTR stations via the Airport Express. Staff who apply for the card may use it for a discount of up to 64 percent for Airport Express single journey fares.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr05-06/english/panels/tp/papers/tp0526cb1-1935-1e.pdf|title=Panel on Transport Meeting on 26 May 2006 Response to Questions|publisher=Legislative Council|accessdate=16 June 2010|format=PDF[/tpl] The MTR Airport Staff Octopus is available upon application via the company for which that a staff member works.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/faq/en/type.jsp#faq5|title=FAQ: How do I apply for an MTR Airport Staff Octopus?|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=28 February 2007[/tpl]

==Card usage==

The Octopus card was introduced for fare payment on the MTR initially, but the use of the card quickly expanded to other retail businesses in Hong Kong. The card is now commonly used in most major public transport, fast food restaurants, supermarkets, vending machines, convenience stores, photo booths,  parking meters, car parks and many other retails business where small payment are frequently made by customers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~tijo/seminar/Case_Studies_and_Profiles_Report.pdf|title=Smart Card Case Studies and Implementation Profiles|publisher=Smart Card Alliance|date=December 2003|accessdate=22 February 2007|format=PDF[/tpl] As of 21 November 2004, all parking meters in Hong Kong were converted. They no longer accept coins and Octopus became the only form of payment accepted.
Notable businesses that started accepting Octopus cards at a very early stage include PARKnSHOP, Wellcome, Watsons, 7-Eleven, Starbucks, McDonald's, and Circle K.
Octopus cards also double as access control cards in buildings and for school administrative functions. At certain office buildings, residential buildings, and schools, usage of an Octopus card is required for entry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://badgerherald.com/oped/2004/02/05/view_from_abroad_hon.php|title=View from abroad: Hong Kong's 'Octopus card' technology puts even credit card to shame|publisher=The Badger Herald|date=5 February 2004|accessdate=31 May 2007[/tpl]

===Payments===

Making or recording a payment using the card for public transport or purchases at Octopus-enabled retailers can be done by holding the card against or waving it over an Octopus card reader from up to a few centimetres away. The reader will acknowledge payment by emitting a doot sound, and displaying the amount deducted and the remaining balance of the card.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hong-kong-travel.org/Octopus.asp|title=Octopus|publisher=Hong Kong Travel|accessdate=11 March 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071111155354/http://www.hong-kong-travel.org/Octopus.asp |archivedate = 11 November 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Standard transaction time for readers used for public transport is 0.3 seconds, while that of readers used for retailers is 1 second.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cw.com.hk/computerworldhk/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=316427|title=Scrap the coins|publisher=Computerworld Hong Kong|date=1 April 2006|accessdate=11 March 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929202201/http://www.cw.com.hk/computerworldhk/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=316427 |archivedate = 29 September 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] When using the MTR system, the entry point of commuters is noted when a passenger enters, and the appropriate amount based on distance traveled will be deducted when the users validate their cards again at the exit point.
The MTR usually charges less for journeys made using an Octopus card instead of conventional single-journey tickets. For example, the adult fare of a single journey from Chai Wan to Tung Chung is HK$20.70 with an Octopus card, and HK$23.50 with a single journey ticket. Other public transport operators also offer intermittent discounts for using Octopus cards on higher fares and round-trip transits on select routes.[tpl]cite web |title = Citybus & NWFB Offer New Octopus Same Day Return Fare Discounts on Jointly-operated Cross Harbour Tunnel Routes from 1 July |publisher = New World First Bus |date = 27 June 2006 |url = http://www.nwfb.com.hk/eng/news/database/news05.asp?news_id=1015&yr=2006&cate=A |doi = |accessdate = 15 May 2007[/tpl]
On 6 November 2005, Octopus Cards Limited launched Octopus Rewards, a program that allows cardholders to earn rewards at merchants that are partners in the program. Participating merchants provide consumers with tailor-made offers and privileges.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20051105.jsp|title=Octopus Rewards Grand Launch|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|date=5 November 2005|accessdate=17 March 2007[/tpl] The rewards that the program offers are in the form of points, or reward dollars, stored on the card. Once a card is registered for the program, the cardholder may accumulate reward points by making purchases at participating merchants, and payments may be made in the form of cash, credit cards, or Octopus cards themselves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/works/en/index.jsp|title=How It Works|publisher=Octopus Rewards Limited|accessdate=17 March 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070210015251/http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/works/en/index.jsp  |archivedate = 10 February 2007[/tpl] The rate at which reward points are earned per dollar-amount purchase differs by the merchant at which that the purchases are made. At Wellcome, for example, one point is earned for every purchase of HK$200;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/earning/where/en/popWellcomeDetails.jsp|title=Wellcome|publisher=Octopus Rewards Limited|accessdate=17 March 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070526173707/http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/earning/where/en/popWellcomeDetails.jsp  |archivedate = 26 May 2007[/tpl] and at Watsons, points are earned at a rate of 0.5 percent per dollar amount of a purchase.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/earning/where/en/popWatsonsDetails.jsp|title=Watsons|publisher=Octopus Rewards Limited|accessdate=17 March 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928080724/http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/earning/where/en/popWatsonsDetails.jsp  |archivedate = 28 September 2007[/tpl] Once these reward dollars are accumulated, they may be redeemed as payment for purchases at partner merchants for at least HK$1 per reward dollar. To redeem the accumulated reward dollars, cardholders must use the entire value amount in whole, and may not elect to use it partially. If the purchase price is lower than the amount of reward dollars available, the amount difference remains stored on the card.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/redeeming/en/index.jsp|title=Redeeming|publisher=Octopus Rewards Limited|accessdate=17 March 2007[/tpl] Founding partners for the Octopus Rewards program include HSBC, UA Cinemas, Watsons, Wellcome, and McDonald's.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/earning/en/index.jsp|title=Earning|publisher=Octopus Rewards Limited|accessdate=17 March 2007[/tpl]

===Enquiring balances, adding value and refunding===

In MTR stations, enquiry machines can be found where cardholders may place their Octopus cards on the machines and the machines will display the balances along with a history of last ten usages.
Monetary value can be added to the card through a number of ways. Add Value Machines, located at MTR stations, can be used to add more value to the cards. The machines accept cash, and selected machines are also able to accept Electronic Funds Transfer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/payment/reload/en/index.jsp|title=Reload Your Octopus: Overview|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=19 March 2007[/tpl] Alternatively, value may be added with cash at authorised service providers such as PARKnSHOP, Wellcome, Watsons, 7-Eleven, Circle K, and Café de Coral, and also at customer service centres and ticketing offices at other transport stations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/payment/reload/en/other.jsp|title=Reload Your Octopus: Other Reload Methods|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=19 March 2007[/tpl]
An Octopus card may store a maximum value of HK$1,000, with an On-Loan card having an initial deposit value of HK$50 and a Sold card having no initial deposit value. Negative value is incurred on a card if it is used with insufficient funds—both types of cards may carry a maximum negative value of HK$35 before value needs to be added to them again for use.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/faq/en/type.jsp#faq1|title=FAQ: What is the difference between On-loan Octopus and Sold Octopus?|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=22 March 2007[/tpl] At the time, the maximum cost of a trip on any of the rail networks except the Airport Express and first class of the MTR East Rail line was HK$34.8, the cost of travelling between East Tsim Sha Tsui Station and Lo Wu Station;[ref]
