"Hallelujah I Love Her So" is a rhythm and blues single written by and released by American singer Ray Charles in 1956 on the Atlantic label. It would later appear on Ray Charles' self-titled first LP for Atlantic Records in 1957.
The song peaked at number five on the Billboard R&B chart and much like "I Got a Woman" and "This Little Girl of Mine", it was a song based on a gospel hymn with lyrics changed around to fit a secular blues format.
These songs predated the groundbreaking success Charles had near the end of the fifties with "What'd I Say" but they helped contribute to Charles' huge success with the R&B community at the time.
"Hallelujah I Love Her So" is a testament to the joyous release of love, featuring a sophisticated horn arrangement, and memorable tenor sax solo (by Don Wilkerson).
