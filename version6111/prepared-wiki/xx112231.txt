==Political career==

Railsback served as a member of the Illinois State House of Representatives from 1962-1966 before being elected as a Republican to Congress in 1966.[tpl]cite web|url= http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/rae-raines.html|title=Thomas Railsback |publisher= The Political Graveyard|accessdate= October 19, 2012[/tpl] He was elected in 1966 defeating freshman Democrat Gale Schisler in a hotly competitive race. The race was a very friendly one with little to no negative attacks on each other, though Railsback credited his victory to the unpopularity of President Lyndon Johnson. A moderate Republican, he served on the House Judiciary Committee in the mid-1970s.  He voted for one of the articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon when they were pending in committee, one of six Republicans to support at least one article.
In 1980, the Congressman was one of three U.S. House members (the others were future Vice President Dan Quayle (R-Indiana) and Tom Evans (R-Delaware)) involved in the controversial Florida golfing trip with lobbyist Paula Parkinson.[tpl]cite news | title=THE REPUBLICANS IN NEW ORLEANS: MAN IN THE NEWS; Baby Boomer With Right Credentials: James Danforth Quayle | first=Susan F. | last=Rasky | publisher=New York Times | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/17/us/republicans-new-orleans-man-baby-boomer-with-right-credentials-james-danforth.html?pagewanted=all | date=August 17, 1988 | accessdate=2009-11-01[/tpl]
In 1982, Railsback's district was renumbered as the 17th District; Illinois had lost two districts after the 1980 census.  He was defeated for renomination by a considerably more conservative Republican, State Senator Kenneth G. McMillan.[tpl]cite news | title=U.S. Rep.
