==Disciplinary issues==

While with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds as a nineteen year old, Nolan was involved in an altercation with R.J. Mahalak of the Plymouth Whalers in March, 2009. In an unprovoked attack,[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.saultstar.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1478860&archive=true |title = Jordan Nolan suspended 20 games |author = Ruicci, Peter |publisher = The Sault Star |date = |work = |accessdate= 9 May 2012 [/tpl] Nolan punched Mahalak twice in the face, giving him a concussion as he fell to the ice and struck his head. As a result, Nolan received a 20-game suspension by the OHL. "They believed it was vicious enough for a 20-game suspension and they felt it was fortunate the player (Mahalak) wasn't hurt more severely", said Greyhounds' general manager Dave Torrie. "(But) that was one of the scariest things I've ever seen. He (Nolan) went after a player who wasn't going to fight. You have to pay consequences," said Whalers' head coach and general manager Mike Vellucci of the incident.
In the NHL, Nolan has faced disciplinary action from the league on multiple occasions. On March 24, 2013, Nolan was fined $1,436.94 by the league for a cross-check to the head of Vancouver Canucks' forward Henrik Sedin. The fine was the maximum allowed under the league's Collective Bargaining Agreement.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/kings-jordan-nolan-fined-for-cross-check-on-canucks-henrik-sedin-1.1342439 |title = Kings' Jordan Nolan fined for cross-check on Canucks' Henrik Sedin |author = The Associated Press |publisher = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date = 24 March 2013 |work = |accessdate= 10 March 2014 [/tpl]
