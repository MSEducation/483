==Economy==

For a long time, Aubange has been linked with siderurgy. There were two big factories in Athus and in Halanzy and also a mine. But because of the concurrence of the foreign markets (especially the ones from Asia and Africa), siderurgy as not profitable anymore and all the factories closed one after another in the whole area.
Now the politics have tried to found new ways to develop the economy. One of the most well-known activities is the Railway Containers Terminal of Athus which deals with thousands of containers each year from the big harbors of the North Sea like Antwerp and Rotterdam to the inland of France, Germany or Luxemburg.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tca.be/en/index.htm|title=Athus Container Terminal|work=Official website of Athus Container Terminal[/tpl].

==Transports==

There are three railway stations in the municipality: in Athus, in and in Halanzy.
The municipality is located nearby the highway E411 which links Brussels to Luxemburg City. It is situated at 30 kilometers from the capital of the Grand-Duchy and from its international airport.
