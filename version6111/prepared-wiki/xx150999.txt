==Career==

Barth started his political career with the National Liberal Party. He soon rejected the Manchesterism of the old liberals, though, and claimed that liberalism needed a social programme. To that end, he sought the cooperation of the with the Social Democrats, and at multiple times voted against his own party. In the German Freeminded Party (Freisinnige Partei), founded in 1884, Barth would soon found himself opposed to the leadership of Eugen Richter. When the Freeminded Party split in 1893, Barth became a member of the Freeminded Union (Freisinnigen Vereinigung), instead of the Freeminded People's Party of Richter. In 1903, Friedrich Naumann would join the Freeminded Union as well. Barth however would found the Democratic Union (Demokratische Vereinigung) in 1908, together with Rudolf Breitscheid and Hellmut von Gerlach, after the Freeminded Union's participation in the Bülow-Block coalition in the 1907 elections.
Barth founded the liberal weekly Die Nation (The Nation) in 1883 and remained as editor until his death in 1909.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9906E7DB1E31E733A25757C0A9609C946897D6CF|title=New York Times obituary|date=4 June 1909|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=12 March 2010 | format=PDF[/tpl]
