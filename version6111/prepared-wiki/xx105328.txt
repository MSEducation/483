Chances Are was a compilation album by Bob Marley released in 1981 by WEA International throughout the world (and specifically through the Cotillion imprint of Atlantic Records in the U.S.).

==Background==

Commissioned by Danny Sims (co-founder and owner of JAD Records) and issued after Marley's death in May 1981, Chances Are was a collection of previously unreleased recordings from 1968 to 1972 that were produced by JAD during Marley's time living in the U.S. and otherwise working with JAD back and forth from Jamaica to the States.  The selected tracks on this collection were overdubbed, remixed, and in many cases, extended beyond their original duration specially for this album.
The majority of songs on this album were re-released on the Black Progress compilation album in 1997 (also released by JAD through the former KOCH International, prior to their original versions being issued on the Complete Wailers series.) The only song not reissued in this version is Mellow Mood, although there was a limited CD pressing of Chances Are printed in the early nineties.
