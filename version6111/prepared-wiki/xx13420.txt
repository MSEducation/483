[[46]]

CATEGORIES: 46

Year 46 (XLVI) was a common year starting on Saturday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Asiaticus and Silanus (or, less frequently, year 799 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 46 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.  The year 46 was the dubbed "The Last Year of Confusion" in that it was the last of a series of extra-long years (it lasted 445 days) resulting from the Julian Reform.
