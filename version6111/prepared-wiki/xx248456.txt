==Critical response==

Roger Friedman, writing for Fox News, said that this was a "numbingly mesmerizing documentary" in which "You have rarely seen such a collection of vacuous and tiresome people". He complains that "the 'It Girls' of 2002...  are an inarticulate and alarming lot of long legged blondes without a thought in their heads".
Mary Robbins, in the New York Times, wrote that the film suffered from poor timing, because the bad economic conditions at the time had "made expensive parties, and girls who were famous for nothing, less and less appealing."[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/07/style/where-have-all-the-it-girls-gone.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Where Have All The It Girls Gone? |first=Mary |last=Robbins |date=7 April 2002 |work=New York Times (page 99 of the New York edition) |publisher=New York Times Company |accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl]

A reviewer for the Baltimore Sun wrote: "As if high school social castes weren't traumatic enough. This "documentary" allegedly attempts to explore the new It Girl, but really reminds us that the hierarchy we like to think we left behind in high school is alive and kicking in the adult world." and "Even with its occasional snarky snippets, the show can be hard to endure for those of us among the proletariat. But after a while, the documentary begins to resemble a drama, and the Hilton girls and their beautiful friends become mere characters in a nouveau Restoration comedy -- School for Scandal meets Page Six."[tpl]cite news |title=In a high-society game of glamour -- they're It |author=Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |date=7 April 2002 |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-04-07/entertainment/0204070401_1_paris-hilton-girls-johnson |accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl]
