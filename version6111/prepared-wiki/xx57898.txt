In July 2004, about 70 subdomains were set up. As of 28 November 2010, twenty-five versions each have more than 1,000 articles. The largest Wikiquote is the Polish project with over 22,600 articles, followed by the English, Italian, German, Portuguese and Russian sites with over 5,000 articles each, and then by the Slovak, Spanish, Bulgarian, Bosnian, Turkish, Slovenian and French (which was restarted in December 2006, after being taken down for legal reasons). Fifty-three language versions have 100 or more articles.[tpl]cite web |title=Wikiquote Statistics|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikiquote#Statistics| work=Wikipedia:Meta|accessdate=29 November 2010[/tpl]
