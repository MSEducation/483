==Resolution==

===Observations===

The Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism was one of the greatest threats to international peace and security and that it could not be associated with any religion, nationality or ethnic group. It acknowledged that military and intelligence operations alone could not defeat terrorism, and that underlying causes should be addressed. There was also concern over the increasing number of abductions and kidnappings by terrorist groups with a political motive. 
Member States were reminded of their obligation to prevent and suppress terrorism and the criminalise its financing. They also had to have effective border controls and information exchanges regarding the movement of terrorists; the presence of safe havens for terrorists was also a problem. The Council also emphasised its role in the fight against terrorism.

The Council emphasised that the role of the CTC was to ensure the full implementation of Resolution 1373.
