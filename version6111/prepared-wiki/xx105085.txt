Mozart and Salieri ([tpl]lang|ru|Моцарт и Сальери[/tpl], Motsart i Salyeri) is a one-act opera in two scenes by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, written in 1897 to a Russian libretto taken almost verbatim from Alexander Pushkin's 1830 verse drama of the same name.
The story follows the apocryphal legend that Antonio Salieri poisoned Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart out of jealousy over the latter's music.Davies, Peter J., "Mozart's Illnesses and Death - 2. The Last Year and the Fatal Illness" (October 1984).  The Musical Times, 125 (1700): pp. 554-557, 559-561. Rimsky-Korsakov incorporated quotations from Mozart's Requiem and Don Giovanni into the score.  Richard Taruskin has placed this opera in the historical context of the development of the realistic tradition in Russian opera.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://mq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/LVI/3/431 | last=Taruskin | first=Richard | title=Realism as Preached and Practiced: The Russian Opera Dialogue | journal=The Musical Quarterly | volume=LVI | issue=3 | pages=431–454 | year=1970 | accessdate=2007-10-16 | doi=10.1093/mq/LVI.3.431[/tpl]

==Performance history==

The first performance took place at the Solodovnikov Theater in Moscow, presented by the Moscow Private Russian Opera,  Moscow on 7 December 1898 (O.S. 25 November). The conductor was Iosif Truffi and scenic designer was Mikhail Vrubel.
Feodor Chaliapin, who originated the role of Salieri, claimed to have often sung the piece as a monodrama, as the role of Mozart goes no higher than g and was within his range. 
In Britain the first UK performance was presented on 11 October 1927, again with Chaliapin as Salieri,trove.nla while the first U.S. one took place in Forest Park, Pennsylvania, in 1933.Harlow Robinson, "Rimsky-Korsakov's Mozart and Salieri".  New York Times, 16 August 1981.

==Synopsis==

Time: End of the 18th century
Place: Vienna, Austria

===Scene 1===

Salieri enjoys high social position as a composer, and has dedicated himself to the service of his art.  Secretly, however, he is jealous of Mozart's works because he recognizes their superior quality, especially given what he sees as the "idle" character of Mozart.  Salieri invites Mozart to dinner and plans to poison him.

===Scene 2===

Mozart and Salieri are dining at an inn. Mozart is troubled by his work on his Requiem, which a stranger in black commissioned from him.  Mozart recalls Salieri's collaboration with Pierre Beaumarchais and asks if could be true that Beaumarchais once poisoned someone, for genius and criminality are surely incompatible. Salieri then surreptitiously pours poison into Mozart's drink.  Mozart begins to play at the keyboard, as Salieri begins to cry. Mozart sees this, but Salieri urges Mozart to continue. Mozart begins to feel ill, and leaves.  Salieri ends the opera pondering Mozart's belief that a genius could not murder: did not Michelangelo kill for his commissions at the Vatican, or were those idle rumors?
