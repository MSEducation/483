The Bilders are various lineups of musicians coordinated by a New Zealand writer and musician. The first Bilders sprang from Vacuum (1977–79) and were known as Kazaportico. Other groups followed in quick succession: Six Impossible Things, Die Bilder, Above Ground, Bilderbergers, Builders, Soluble Fish and other permutations or homophones of the word Builders. Bilders' material is known for 'rough' music making (often live in the studio), and a lo-fi recording style that has produced "many genuine classic compositions".Dix, John (1988).
