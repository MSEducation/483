Civil disobedience is the active, professed refusal to obey certain laws, demands, and commands of a government, or of an occupying international power. Civil disobedience is commonly, though not always,[tpl]citation|title=Violent Civil Disobedience and Willingness to Accept Punishment|volume=8|issue=2|date=June 2007|publisher=Essays in Philosophy|url=http://www.humboldt.edu/~essays/mararo.html[/tpl][tpl]citation|title=The justifiability of violent civil disobedience|author=J Morreall|publisher=Canadian Journal of Philosophy|pages=35–47|year=1976|issue=1|volume=6|journal=Canadian Journal of Philosophy|jstor=40230600[/tpl] defined as being nonviolent resistance. It is one form of civil resistance. In one view (in India, known as ahimsa or satyagraha) it could be said that it is compassion in the form of respectful disagreement.

One of the oldest depictions of civil disobedience is in Sophocles' play Antigone, in which Antigone, one of the daughters of former King of Thebes, Oedipus, defies Creon, the current King of Thebes, who is trying to stop her from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial.  She gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law.  She is not at all afraid of the death he threatens her with (and eventually carries out), but she is afraid of how her conscience will smite her if she does not do this.Sophocle's Antigone, Project Gutenberg, F. Storr translation, 1912, Harvard University Press
Following the Peterloo massacre of 1819, poet Percy Shelley wrote the political poem The Mask of Anarchy later that year, that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time—and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of social action. It is perhaps the first modern[tpl]vague|date=November 2010[/tpl] statement of the principle of nonviolent protest.[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl] A version was taken up by the author Henry David Thoreau in his essay Civil Disobedience, and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of Satyagraha. Gandhi's Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action.Thomas Weber, "Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor," Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 28–29. In particular, it is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley's Masque of Anarchy to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India.Thomas Weber, "Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor," Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 28.
Thoreau's 1848 essay Civil Disobedience, originally titled "Resistance to Civil Government", has had a wide influence on many later practitioners of civil disobedience. The driving idea behind the essay is that citizens are morally responsible for their support of aggressors, even when such support is required by law. In the essay, Thoreau explained his reasons for having refused to pay taxes as an act of protest against slavery and against the Mexican-American War. He writes, "If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man's shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too. See what gross inconsistency is tolerated. I have heard some of my townsmen say, 'I should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves, or to march to Mexico; — see if I would go'; and yet these very men have each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by their money, furnished a substitute."

==Etymology==

Thoreau's 1849 essay "Resistance to Civil Government" was eventually renamed "Essay on Civil Disobedience." After his landmark lectures were published in 1866, the term began to appear in numerous sermons and lectures relating to slavery and the war in Mexico.The Gospel Applied to the Fugitive Slave Law 1850: A Sermon, by mayur (1851)"The Higher Law," in Its Application to the Fugitive Slave Bill:... by John Newell and John Chase Lord (1851)The Limits of Civil Disobedience: A Sermon..., by Nathaniel Hall (1851)The Duty and Limitations of Civil Disobedience: A Discourse, by Samuel Colcord Bartlett (1853) Thus, by the time Thoreau's lectures were first published under the title "Civil Disobedience," in 1866, four years after his death, the term had achieved fairly widespread usage.
It has been argued that the term "civil disobedience" has always suffered from ambiguity and in modern times, become utterly debased. Marshall Cohen notes, "It has been used to describe everything from bringing a test-case in the federal courts to taking aim at a federal official. Indeed, for Vice President Agnew it has become a code-word describing the activities of muggers, arsonists, draft evaders, campaign hecklers, campus militants, anti-war demonstrators, juvenile delinquents and political assassins."[tpl]citation|title=Civil Disobedience in a Constitutional Democracy|author=Marshall Cohen|publisher=The Massachusetts Review|volume=10|issue=2|date=Spring 1969|pages=211–226[/tpl]
LeGrande writes that "the formulation of a single all-encompassing definition of the term is extremely difficult, if not impossible. In reviewing the voluminous literature on the subject, the student of civil disobedience rapidly finds himself surrounded by a maze of semantical problems and grammatical niceties. Like Alice in Wonderland, he often finds that specific terminology has no more (or no less) meaning than the individual orator intends it to have." He encourages a distinction between lawful protest demonstration, nonviolent civil disobedience, and violent civil disobedience.[tpl]citation|publisher=Northwestern University|doi=10.2307/1141639|title=Nonviolent Civil Disobedience and Police Enforcement Policy|author=J. L. LeGrande|volume=58|issue=3|date=Sep 1967|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science|pages=393–404|jstor=1141639[/tpl]
In a letter to P.K.Rao, dated September 10, 1935, Gandhi disputes that his idea of civil disobedience was derived from the writings of Thoreau:Letter to P.K. Rao, Servants of India Society, September 10, 1935, Letter quoted in Louis Fischer's, The Life of Mahatma Gandhi, Part I, Chapter 11, pp. 87-88.

==Theories==

In seeking an active form of civil disobedience, one may choose to deliberately break certain laws, such as by forming a peaceful blockade or occupying a facility illegally[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl], though sometimes violence has been known to occur. Protesters practice this non-violent form of civil disorder with the expectation that they will be arrested. Others also expect to be attacked or even beaten by the authorities. Protesters often undergo training in advance on how to react to arrest or to attack, so that they will do so in a manner that quietly or limply resists without threatening the authorities.
Mahatma Gandhi outlined several rules for civil resisters (or satyagrahi) in the time when he was leading India in the struggle for Independence from the British Empire. For instance, they were to express no anger, never retaliate, submit to the opponent's orders and assaults, submit to arrest by the authorities, surrender personal property when confiscated by the authorities but refuse to surrender property held in trust, refrain from swearing and insults (which are contrary to ahimsa), refrain from saluting the Union flag, and protect officials from insults and assaults even at the risk of the resister's own life.
Civil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws, as distinguished from a constitutional impasse in which two public agencies, especially two equally sovereign branches of government, conflict. For instance, if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country's highest court, it would not be civil disobedience, since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen.[tpl]citation|title=Civil Disobedience|author=Rex Martin|publisher=Ethics|volume=80|issue=2|date=Jan 1970|pages=123–139[/tpl]
Ronald Dworkin held that there are three types of civil disobedience:
Some theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities. Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as trade unions, banks, and private universities can be justified if it reflects "a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken". The same principle, she argues, applies to breaches of law in protest against international organizations and foreign governments.
It is usually recognized that lawbreaking, if it is not done publicly, at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience. But Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality, we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking. If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his natural rights, he might, for instance, find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience. This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations.[tpl]citation|doi=10.2307/1122838|title=Lawyering for Justice in a Flawed Democracy|first2=David|last2=Luban|author=Stephen Ellmann|publisher=Columbia Law Review|volume=90|issue=1|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=Jan 1990|pages=116–190|jstor=1122838[/tpl] The Fully Informed Jury Association's publication "A Primer for Prospective Jurors" notes, "Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when Hitler's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house."[tpl]citation|url=http://fija.org/docs/BR_2010_QandA_primer.pdf|title=A Primer for Prospective Jurors|publisher=Fully Informed Jury Association[/tpl] By this definition, civil disobedience could be traced back to the Book of Exodus, where Shiphrah and Puah refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it. (Exodus 1: 15-19)Magonet, Jonathan (1992) Bible Lives (London: SCM), 8

===Violent vs. nonviolent===

There have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non-violent. Black's Law Dictionary includes nonviolence in its definition of civil disobedience. Christian Bay's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires "carefully chosen and legitimate means," but holds that they do not have to be nonviolent.[tpl]citation|author=Bay, Christian|title=Civil Disobedience|publisher=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences|volume=II|pages=473–486[/tpl] It has been argued that, while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects, rebellion is much more destructive; therefore, the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience, and if one cannot justify civil rebellion, then one cannot justify a civil disobedients' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest. Civil disobedients' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society's tolerance of civil disobedience.[tpl]citation|title=Civil Disobedience|author=Stuart M. Brown, Jr.|publisher=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=58|issue=22[/tpl] But McCloskey argues that "if violent, intimidatory, coercive disobedience is more effective, it is, other things being equal, more justified than less effective, nonviolent disobedience."[tpl]citation|doi=10.2307/2106847|title=Conscientious Disobedience of the Law: Its Necessity, Justification, and Problems to Which it Gives Rise|author=H. J. McCloskey|publisher=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=40|issue=4|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=Jun 1980|pages=536–557|jstor=2106847[/tpl]

===Revolutionary vs. non-revolutionary===

Non-revolutionary civil disobedience is a simple disobedience of laws on the grounds that they are judged "wrong" by an individual conscience, or as part of an effort to render certain laws ineffective, to cause their repeal, or to exert pressure to get one's political wishes on some other issue. Revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an active attempt to overthrow a government.[tpl]citation|title=Toward an Ethics of Civil Disobedience|author=Harry Prosch|publisher=Ethics|volume=77|issue=3|date=Apr 1967|pages=176–192[/tpl] Gandhi's acts have been described as revolutionary civil disobedience. It has been claimed that the Hungarians under Ferenc Deák directed revolutionary civil disobedience against the Austrian government.[tpl]citation|doi=10.2307/2023542|publisher=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=58|issue=21|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=October 12, 1961|pages=653–665|title=On Civil Disobedience|author=Hugo A. Bedau|jstor=2023542[/tpl] Thoreau also wrote of civil disobedience accomplishing "peaceable revolution."

===Collective vs. solitary===

The earliest recorded incidents of collective civil disobedience took place during the Roman Empire. Unarmed Jews gathered in the streets to prevent the installation of pagan images in the Temple in Jerusalem.[tpl]Or|date=January 2012[/tpl] In modern times, some activists who commit civil disobedience as a group collectively refuse to sign bail until certain demands are met, such as favorable bail conditions, or the release of all the activists. This is a form of jail solidarity.[tpl]citation|title=Path of Resistance|url=http://taghier.org/books/english/path_e.pdf|author=P Herngren|publisher=The Practice of Civil Disobedience|year=1993[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] There have also been many instances of solitary civil disobedience, such as that committed by Thoreau, but these sometimes go unnoticed. Thoreau, at the time of his arrest, was not yet a well-known author, and his arrest was not covered in any newspapers in the days, weeks and months after it happened. The tax collector who arrested him rose to higher political office, and Thoreau's essay was not published until after the end of the Mexican War.[tpl]citation|author=Gross, Robert A.|title=Quiet War With The  State; Henry David Thoreau and Civil Disobedience.|publisher=The Yale Review|date=October 2005|pages=1–17[/tpl]

==Techniques==

===Choice of specific act===

Civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts. Bedau writes, "There is a whole class of acts, undertaken in the name of civil disobedience, which, even if they were widely practiced, would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance (e.g. trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation)...Such acts are often just a harassment and, at least to the bystander, somewhat inane...The remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity." Bedau also notes, though, that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose. Some civil disobedients, such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and Voice in the Wilderness, which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the U.S. Government, directly achieve a desired social goal (such as the provision of medication to the sick) while openly breaking the law. Julia Butterfly Hill lived in Luna, a [tpl]convert|180|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl]-tall, 600-year-old California Redwood tree for 738 days, successfully preventing it from being cut down.
In cases where the criminalized behavior is pure speech, civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech. An example would be WBAI's broadcasting the track "Filthy Words" from a George Carlin comedy album, which eventually led to the 1978 Supreme Court case of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation. Threatening government officials is another classic way of expressing defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies. For example, Joseph Haas was arrested for allegedly sending an email to the Lebanon, New Hampshire city councilors stating, "Wise up or die."[tpl]citation|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Brown+case+e-mails+investigated&articleId=083dd586-0d54-4650-a9ca-07f99d4d3914|title=Brown case e-mails investigated|date=June 21, 2007|publisher=Union-Leader[/tpl]
More generally, protesters of particular victimless crimes often see fit to openly commit that crime. Laws against public nudity, for instance, have been protested by going naked in public, and laws against cannabis consumption have been protested by openly possessing it and using it at cannabis rallies.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig8/clark-d5.html |title=Civil Disobedience and the Libertarian Division of Labor|author=Clark, Dick|date=April 22, 2008|publisher=LewRockwell.com[/tpl]
Some forms of civil disobedience, such as illegal boycotts, refusals to pay taxes, draft dodging, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and sit-ins, make it more difficult for a system to function. In this way, they might be considered coercive.  Brownlee notes that "although civil disobedients are constrained in their use of coercion by their conscientious aim to engage in moral dialogue, nevertheless they may find it necessary to employ limited coercion in order to get their issue onto the table."[tpl]citation|title=The communicative aspects of civil disobedience and lawful punishment|author=Kimberley Brownlee|date=9 November 2006|journal=Criminal Law and Philosophy|volume=1|doi=10.1007/s11572-006-9015-9|issue=2|page=179|publisher=Criminal Law and Philosophy[/tpl] The Plowshares organization temporarily closed GCSB Waihopai by padlocking the gates and using sickles to deflate one of the large domes covering two satellite dishes.
Electronic civil disobedience can include web site defacements, redirects, denial-of-service attacks, information theft and data leaks, illegal web site parodies, virtual sit-ins, and virtual sabotage. It is distinct from other kinds of hacktivism in that the perpetrator openly reveals his identity. Virtual actions rarely succeed in completely shutting down their targets, but they often generate significant media attention.[tpl]citation|doi=10.1177/0002716204270338|title=The New Digital Media and Activist Networking within Anti-Corporate Globalization Movements|author=Jeffrey S. Juris|publisher=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=597|pages=189–208|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|issue=Cultural Production in a Digital Age|jstor=25046069|year=2005[/tpl]
Dilemma actions are designed to create a "response dilemma" for public authorities "by forcing them to either concede some public space to protesters or make themselves look absurd or heavy-handed by acting against the protest."Laura Moth, Today's Zaman, 19 June 2013, A standing dilemma in Taksim 

===Cooperation with authorities===

Some disciplines of civil disobedience hold that the protestor must submit to arrest and cooperate with the authorities. Others advocate falling limp or resisting arrest, especially when it will hinder the police from effectively responding to a mass protest.
Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases. For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community,Watts v. Indiana, [tpl]ussc|338|49|1949[/tpl] and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude.[tpl]citation|journal=The Yale Law Journal|title=A Postscript to the Miranda Project: Interrogation of Draft Protestors|author=John Griffiths and Richard E. Ayres|volume=77|issue=2|date=Dec 1967|pages=300–319[/tpl] Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote, "My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with--for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel--and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action."Thoreau, Henry David. Civil Disobedience.
Some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract, which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established, or else suffer the penalties set out in the law. Other civil disobedients who favor the existence of government still don't believe in the legitimacy of their particular government, or don't believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted. And still other civil disobedients, being anarchists, don't believe in the legitimacy of any government, and therefore see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others.

===Choice of plea===

An important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty. There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law.[tpl]citation|url=http://freestateproject.org/news/issues/civil_disobedience.php|title=Rules for Engaging in Civil Disobedience|publisher=Free State Project[/tpl] It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, "Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged," but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, "Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty." A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.actupny.org/documents/CDdocuments/ACTUP_CivilDisobedience.pdf|title=Civil Disobedience Training|publisher=ACT-UP|year=2003[/tpl] One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, "I plead for the beauty that surrounds us";[tpl]citation|author=Hurst, John|year=1978|title=A-plant protesters being freed|publisher=Los Angeles Times[/tpl] this is known as a "creative plea," and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty.
When the Committee for Non-Violent Action sponsored a protest in August 1957, at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas, Nevada, 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest. At a pre-arranged announced time, one at a time they stepped across the "line" and were immediately arrested. They were put on a bus and taken to the Nye County seat of Tonopah, Nevada, and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace, that afternoon.  A well known civil rights attorney, Francis Heisler, had volunteered to defend the arrested persons, advising them to plead "nolo contendere", as an alternative to pleading either guilty or not-guilty. The arrested persons were found "guilty," nevertheless, and given suspended sentences, conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
Paul Flower writes, "There may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice. But that is different than the notion that they must go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience. The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail, or by evading it. To accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience, to demean the seriousness of the protest...In particular, the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated."[tpl]citation|title=On Civil Disobedience in Recent American Democratic Thought|author=Paul F. Power|publisher=The American Political Science Review|volume=64|issue=1|date=Mar 1970|pages=35–47[/tpl]
Sometimes the prosecution proposes a plea bargain to civil disobedients, as in the case of the Camden 28, in which the defendants were offered an opportunity to plead guilty to one misdemeanor count and receive no jail time.[tpl]citation|author=Mirelle Cohen|title=The Camden 28 (review)|journal=Teaching Sociology|volume=35|issue=4|date=Oct 2007|pages=391–392[/tpl] In some mass arrest situations, the activists decide to use solidarity tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.nlg-la.org/index_files/cd_questions.pdf|title=Questions and Answers about Civil Disobedience and the Legal Process|author=National Lawyers Guild, LA Chapter[/tpl] But some activists have opted to enter a blind plea, pleading guilty without any plea agreement in place. Mohandas Gandhi pleaded guilty and told the court, "I am here to . . . submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen."[tpl]citation|title=Three Principles of Civil Disobedience: Thoreau, Gandhi, and King|publisher=Lewiston Morning Tribune|date=January 15, 2006|author=Nick Gier[/tpl]

==Legal implications of civil disobedience==

Barkan writes that if defendants plead not guilty, "they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine, or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience." A technical defense may enhance the chances for acquittal but make for more boring proceedings and reduced press coverage. During the Vietnam War era, the Chicago Eight used a political defense, while Benjamin Spock used a technical defense.[tpl]citation|title=Strategic, Tactical and Organizational Dilemmas of the Protest Movement against Nuclear Power|author=Steven E. Barkan|publisher=Social Problems|volume=27|issue=1|date=Oct 1979|pages=19–37[/tpl] In countries such as the United States whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes, some civil disobedients seek jury nullification. Over the years, this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as Sparf v. United States, which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative, and United States v. Dougherty, which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification.
Governments have generally not recognized the legitimacy of civil disobedience or viewed political objectives as an excuse for breaking the law. Specifically, the law usually distinguishes between criminal motive and criminal intent; the offender's motives or purposes may be admirable and praiseworthy, but his intent may still be criminal.[tpl]citation|title=Reconstructing the Criminal Defenses: The Significance of Justification|author=Thomas Morawetz|publisher=The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (1973-)|volume=77|issue=2|date=Summer 1986|pages=277–307[/tpl] Hence the saying that "if there is any possible justification of civil disobedience it must come from outside the legal system."[tpl]citation|author=Arthur W. Munk|title=Civil Disobedience: Conscience, Tactics, and the Law|publisher=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=397|date=Sep 1971|pages=211–212[/tpl]
One theory is that, while disobedience may be helpful, any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit. Therefore, conscientious lawbreakers must be punished.[tpl]citation|title=Legal Toleration of Civil Disobedience|author=Robert T. Hall|publisher=Ethics|volume=81|issue=2|date=Jan 1971|pages=128–142[/tpl] Michael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law, and then wins his case, then that act did not constitute civil disobedience.[tpl]citation|title=The Justifiability of Civil Disobedience|author=Michael Bayles|publisher=The Review of Metaphysics|volume=24|issue=1|date=Sep 1970|pages=3–20[/tpl] It has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification, as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law, is not civil disobedience.[tpl]citation|title=Justifying Political Disobedience|author=Leslie J. Macfarlane|publisher=Ethics|volume=79|issue=1|date=Oct 1968|pages=24–55[/tpl] Likewise, a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution, or by denying having committed the crime, or by fleeing the jurisdiction, is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient.
Courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience: "Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not, itself, the object of protest, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that  law."[tpl]cite court|url=http://openjurist.org/939/f2d/826/united-states-v-d-schoon|litigants=U.S.  v.

Along with giving the offender his "just deserts", achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment.[tpl]usc|18|3553[/tpl][tpl]citation|url=http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/1a1.htm|publisher=2009 Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual|title=3. The Basic Approach (Policy Statement)[/tpl] Brownee argues, "Bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law’s engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law."

This means that the objector has no right not to be punished. It is a matter for the state (including the judges) to decide on utilitarian grounds whether to do so or not."[tpl]citation|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldjudgmt/jd030320/sepet-2.htm|title=Judgments - Sepet (FC) and Another (FC) (Appellants) v.
