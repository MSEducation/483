This Ashur Khana was renovated by the Seventh Nizam under the advise of Nawab Zain Yar Jung. The main entrance and its roof remain unaltered on which 1299 H, the year of construction is engraved. The room in which the Alam is installed is a strong room and the Alam is kept in a safe made on the design of a Sarcophagus (Zarih).

There is a relic enclosed in this Alam as well. The relic is a piece of the wooden plank on which Janab Syeda was given her final ablution by her husband before burial.

The Relic was preserved in the calligraphic Alam with Arabic lettering of Allah, Mohammed and Ali. It was covered with an alloy of metals and gold. later Nasir-ud-daulah offered jewellery to the Alam which still exists.
