[[Ants of medical importance]]

CATEGORIES: Ants

Ants are capable of biting, stinging and spraying irritant chemicals. Most have only a mild effect on humans however a few can cause injury or sometimes even death. Like wasps, individual ants are capable of stinging multiple times.O'Rourke, Fergus J. (1956) The medical and veterinary importance of the formicidae. nsectes Sociaux 3(1):107-118 [tpl]doi|10.1007/BF02230671[/tpl]

==Fire ants==

The fire ant Solenopsis invicta is a species that is expanding in range around the world and is most often involved in medical emergencies. The species is aggressive and has a painful sting. A person typically encounters fire ants by inadvertently stepping into one of their mounds, which causes the ants to swarm up the person's legs, attacking en masse. The ants respond to pheromones that are released by the first ant to attack. The ants then swarm and immediately sting when any movement is sensed. People who are sensitive to the venom can die of anaphylaxis. In a survey of 29,300 physicians in the United States of America (in 1989), reports of 83 fatalities were obtained.Rhoades RB, Stafford CT, James FK Jr. (1989) Survey of fatal anaphylactic reactions to imported fire ant stings. Report of the Fire Ant Subcommittee of the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 84(2):159-62. PMID 2760357 Some fire ant attacks on humans confined to beds have also been noted it has been noted that fire ants can be a particular threat in medical facilities in some locations since they can have nesting colonies inside human habitations.deShazo RD, Kemp SF, deShazo MD, Goddard J. (2004) Fire ant attacks on patients in nursing homes: an increasing problem. Am J Med. 116(12):843-6. PMID 15178500

==Other species==

Apart from Solenopsis invicta and Solenopsis richteri, serious allergic reactions are known from ants belonging to 6 different subfamilies (Formicinae, Myrmeciinae, Ponerinae, Ectatomminae, Myrmicinae, and Pseudomyrmecinae) and 10 genera (Solenopsis, Formica, Myrmecia, Tetramorium, Pogonomyrmex, Pachycondyla, Odontomachus, Rhytidoponera, Pseudomyrmex, and Hypoponera).Klotz, John H.; Deshazo, Richard D.; Pinnas, Jacob L. ; Frishman, Austin M. ; Schmidt, Justin O. ; Suiter, Daniel R. ; Price, Gary W. ; Klotz, Stephen A. (2005) Adverse reactions to ants other than imported fire ants. Annals of allergy, asthma, & immunology 95(5):418-425
The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile is found in Argentina, Southern Europe, Southern USA and California. They are small and are found in human habitations. They often kill other ant species.Harris, R J (2002) Potential impact of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) in New Zealand and options for its control. Science for Conservation 196 PDF They have been noted as having the potential to carry pathogens in hospital environments.Fowler, H.G.; Bueno, O.C.; Sadatsune, T.; Montelli, A.C. 1993: Ants as potential vectors of pathogens in hospitals in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Insect Science and its Application 14: 367–370.
The Pharaoh ant, Monomorium pharaonis is found around the world. It is not known for its sting, but has been involved in respiratory allergies.Kim CW, Choi SY, Park JW, Hong CS. (2005) Respiratory allergy to the indoor ant (Monomorium pharaonis) not related to sting allergy. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 94: 301-6
Bulldog ants, genus Myrmecia are found in Australia and belong to the ant subfamily Myrmeciinae, and are among the most primitive extant ants. All but one of the sixty or so species are found in Australia. This species is known to cause some fatalities in sensitive humans.Forbes McGain and Kenneth D. Winkel (2002) Ant sting mortality in Australia Toxicon. 40(8):1095-1100
Bullet ants, genus Paraponera found from Nicaragua southward to the Amazon Basin and their close relatives of the genus Dinoponera are New World ponerines known for their painful stings.Haddad Junior Vidal, Cardoso João Luiz Costa, Moraes Roberto Henrique Pinto. (2005) Description of an injury in a human caused by a false tocandira (Dinoponera gigantea, Perty, 1833) with a revision on folkloric, pharmacological and clinical aspects of the giant ants of the genera Paraponera and Dinoponera (sub-family Ponerinae). Rev. Inst. Med. trop. S. Paulo 47(4): 235-238. [tpl]doi|10.1590/S0036-46652005000400012[/tpl]
Driver ants, genus Dorylus are found in the Old world, esp. West Africa and the Congo Basin. Unlike the army ants of the New World, Old World army ants have a functional sting, but rarely use it; this is more than compensated for by their razor-sharp, falcate mandibles. Dorylus spp. colonies also reach larger sizes than Eciton. The Siafu ants on Mount Meru in Tanzania were implicated in the death of a missing tourist to the Congo.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl]
Red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus found in Western USA are bright red myrmicine ants whose venom is the most potent of any ants species.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl]
