Statistics of the First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1994–95 season.

==Overview==

It was contested by 22 teams, divided in 3 groups with 6 teams, while the last group consisted of 4 teams. After the group stage, the best 2 teams from each group would go to a preliminary knockout playoff round. The 4 winners of those matches were once again grouped in a single group, and the team which placed first in that group would be declared as the overall winner of that session. The winner in the end was NK Čelik Zenica.
This was the first and only time that the league was played in this format.
