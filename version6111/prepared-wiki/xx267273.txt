==History and Initiatives==

MobME had humble beginnings when the initial capital for starting the business came from selling mobile SIM Cards and recharge coupons to college students.[tpl]cite news|last=Express|first=Indian|title=From coupon sellers to innovators|url=http://expressbuzz.com/education/from-coupon-sellers-to-innovators/265919.html|accessdate=5 February 2012|newspaper=Indian Express Buzz|date=18 Apr 2011[/tpl] In 2005, the company was registered under the name Torque. It was the first student initiative to be incubated in Technopark, Trivandrum. Later, the company was renamed to MobME.
In Jan 2012, MobME tied up with The National Science & Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board (NSTEDB), The Department of Science and Technology and Technopark, Trivandrum to set up India's first Publicâ€“private partnership telecom Business incubator named 'Startup Village' at Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation Park in Kalamassery.[tpl]cite news|title=India's First Startup Village at Kochi|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/kerala/india-s-first-startup-village-at-kochi-168227|accessdate=22 February 2012|newspaper=NDTV|date=18 Jan 2012[/tpl] This 'Startup Village' is modelled on Technology Incubators in Silicon Valley, United States and will focus mainly on student startups from college campuses.
