After an eponymous Italian album debut, the band changed its name twice, first to Silence in 1968 and then, in 1969, to Mott the Hoople. Ralphs remained with Mott the Hoople until 1973. 
In 1974, he founded Bad Company along with vocalist Paul Rodgers from Free. The band's debut album that year included the Ralphs'-penned hit "Can't Get Enough", for which Ralphs tuned his guitar in the open-C tuning C-C-G-C-E-C, stating, "It never really sounds right in standard tuning. It needs the open C to have that ring."[tpl]cite journal|title=Mick Ralphs: The rock 'N' roll fantasy continues|first=Lisa|last=Sharken|date=15 May 2001|accessdate=21 February 2013|ref=harv|url=http://www.vintageguitar.com/2801/mick-ralphs/|journal=Vintage Guitar|[/tpl] The debut album reached number one in the United States.

Bad Company reformed with different lineups between 1986 and 1998. But after a reunion tour with the original foursome in 1999, Ralphs announced that he was giving up touring, something he was never comfortable with in either band, since he has a morbid fear of flying.[tpl]fact|date=February 2014[/tpl]
Ralphs second solo album It's All Good, an instrumental, came out in 2001. Two years later his That's Life – Can't Get Enough album was released, including a demo version of "Can't Get Enough".Allmusic.com – album overview

On 2 July 2008, it was announced that the original line-up of Bad Company (minus Boz Burrell who died in September 2006) would do a one-off gig at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida on 8 August 2008.Bad Company News According to Paul Rodgers, they did this gig to 'protect the legacy they have built and cement the rights to the trademark Bad Company for touring'.Queen News The now regular line-up of Bad Company includes Ralphs, along with Rodgers and Kirke.
Mott the Hoople, including Ralphs, reunited for two shows at the Blake Theatre in Monmouth close to Rockfield studios where they rehearsed before playing five concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, during September and October 2009.

In 2011, Ralphs formed The Mick Ralphs Blues Band with musicians he met while guesting at a jam session at the Nag's Head pub in High Wycombe: Stuart Son Maxwell, harmonica/vocals; Jim Maving, guitar; Sam Kelly, drums; Dickey Baldwin, bass. The band's website states that Ralphs is seeking to explore his blues and soul roots, playing covers of classic blues and R&B songs. The band made its debut as Mick Ralphs and Co at Jagz Club in Ascot in June 2011, changing the name to the Mick Ralphs Blues Band soon afterwards. More dates were announced for late 2011 and early 2012.
