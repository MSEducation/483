The Housing (Financial Provisions) Act 1924 (14 & 15 Geo. V c. 35) was an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom.
The act increased government subsidies to be paid to local authorities to build housing for rent for low paid workers from £6 to £9. It also extended the time over which the subsidy was paid from 20 to 40 years. Around 508,000 houses were built under this act.
The act was introduced by the first Labour government, and was also known as the Wheatley Housing Act after John Wheatley the minister who introduced it.
