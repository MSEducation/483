Outside the Bolivar city limits, SR 18/SR 125 continue north through the Hatchie River bottoms before reaching the community of Shandy.

SR 18 in northern Hardeman County traverses sparsely populated farmland and swampland and intersects with SR 138 and SR 100.  The junction of SR 18 & SR 100 is a grade-separated diamond interchange where SR 18 expands briefly to a four-lane divided highway.  North of this intersection, SR 18 resumes its northbound routing towards Jackson as a rural two-lane highway.

==History==

Little has changed along SR 18 since its designation as a state route.  Prior to 1981, SR 18 had one alternate route near Grand Junction which was originally signed as State Route 18A.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|year=1981â€“1982|title=1981 Tennessee Official Transportation Map|encyclopedia=|publisher=Tennessee Department of Transportation|location=Nashville, Tennessee[/tpl]  This entire route was renamed to what is now known as Tennessee State Route 368.
SR 18 roughly follows the original route of the Mississippi Central Railroad.

==Future==

In Hardeman County, an Environmental Impact Statement is currently underway to determine the feasibility of widening SR 18 from its current two-lane status to a divided four-lane highway.Tennessee Department of Transportation, SR 18 Improvement Website  This work is part of a larger effort by TDOT to widen SR 18 from Bolivar north to Jackson as directed in House Joint Resolution 16 of the 98th Tennessee General Assembly.98th Tennessee General Assembly, House Joint Resolution No. 16, 1993
