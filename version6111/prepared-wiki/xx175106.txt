==The name==

According to an old legend, the town is named after a girl later known as Saint Thora who was drowned by her stepmother, found on the shore of Torekov, and buried by a blind man who then regained his sight.
However, the more prosaic explanation refers to two old words thora meaning height, and kove meaning cabin or hut. Svenskt ortnamnslexikon 2003
