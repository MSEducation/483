Mopsus is an Australian spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). The only species Mopsus mormon is commonly called Green jumping spider.

==Description==

At 12Â mm (female), this is one of Australia's larger jumping spiders, and very common in Queensland. It also occurs in New Guinea, northern New South Wales, the Northern Territory and Western Australia.
The males are strikingly colored and decorated with long white "side whiskers", which rise to a peak surmounted by a topknot of black hairs.Jackson 1983
Females don't have the whiskers and topknot, but instead feature a red and white elegant "mask".

==Behavior==

This species show an amazingly complex display repertoire, in some respects similar to that of several Phidippus species (P. johnsoni, P. femoratus) and Portia fimbriata. However, this is likely to be convergent evolution. Alternative mating tactics have been described, depending on the location of the female. If she is away from her nest, a type of courtship common with many other species is observed. If she is found at a nest, probing and other behaviors similar to Phidippus johnsoni occur. This second courtship seems not to depend on vision. Like many other salticids, the adult lives together with the subadult female in an adjacent nest until it matures, then mates with her inside her nest.
