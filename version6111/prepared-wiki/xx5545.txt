==Historical populations==

The biggest population difficulty in Kuwait involves the Bidoon, stateless people numbering just over 100,000 who are classed as illegal residents and who are trying to claim Kuwaiti citizenship.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21857431 |title=Kuwait MPs pass law to naturalise 4,000 stateless Bidun |work=BBC News |date=20 March 2013[/tpl]  Critics argue that these people are Arabs who migrated from Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia; a large part of the problem the Bidoon face is that these other states do not consider them as their nationals either.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/stateless-kuwait-who-are-bidoon |title=Stateless in Kuwait: Who Are the Bidoon? |work=Open Society Foundations |date=24 March 2011[/tpl]  In 2013 a law was passed to grant citizenship to 4,000 of these people as part of an attempt to resolve the problem.  However, the government has said that only a third of the Bidoon would qualify for possible naturalisation as it considers that the rest hold other nationalities, with officials alleging that they have destroyed their documents in order to claim Kuwaiti citizenship.
