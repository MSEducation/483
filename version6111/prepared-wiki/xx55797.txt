After her death, Funk married her sister, Helen G. Thompson. Funk had two children, Wilfred J. Funk and Lida Scott.[tpl]cite news|last=Johnson|first=William E.|title=Sept. 30, 1839--Isaac Kaufman Funk--April 4, 1912|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f1ExAQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA866&ots=Dkw300wWE-&dq=Union%20Advocate%20AND%20Funk&pg=PA866#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=American Advance|date=April 13, 1912|page=2[/tpl]  In 1872, Funk resigned from the ministry and made an extensive tour through Europe, northern Africa, and Asia Minor.
Funk was a prohibitionist and also interested himself in psychical research in his later years.[tpl]Cite Collier's|wstitle=Funk, Isaac Kauffman[/tpl] He founded the Voice in 1880,  an organ of the Prohibition Party, and he was the Prohibition candidate for mayor of New York.
In 1875Funk & Wagnalls New Encyclopedia. 1996. he founded the publishing firm of I.K. Funk & Company, with the help of a Wittenberg classmate, Adam Willis Wagnalls, a lawyer and accountant.  That year he founded and published the Metropolitan Pulpit (later its name was changed to Homiletic Review). Missionary Review also numbered among the many religious publications he founded after 1876. In 1890 the name of his company was changed to Funk & Wagnalls Company, to more accurately reflect Wagnalls' partnership.  In that same year, Funk published The Literary Digest, a departure from the religious works earlier in his career.Wagnalls Memorial Library (Country Living/January 2009)
Perhaps Funk's most important achievement was his Standard Dictionary of the English Language, the first volume of which was published in 1893. He worked with a team of more than 740 people. His aim was to provide essential information thoroughly and simply at the same time. In order to achieve this he placed current meanings first, archaic meanings second, and etymologies last.Funk & Wagnalls 1877 (Index of Publishing Houses) The dictionary was said to have cost Funk & Wagnalls over $960,000.[tpl]cite journal|title=Rev.

From 1901 until 1906, Funk & Wagnalls compiled the Jewish Encyclop√¶dia.  After Funk died in 1912, the publishing house eventually became a subsidiary of Thomas Y. Crowell Co.
