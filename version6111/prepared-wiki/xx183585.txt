==History==

Saqqa became a town of importance when king Abba Bagido made it his capital of Limmu-Ennarea in 1825, eclipsing his father's capital, Sappa.Mohammed Hassen, The Oromo of Ethiopia: a History 1570-1860 (Trenton: Red Sea Press, 1994), p. 103 It thrived as the major marketplace of the Gibe region, where the different kinds of Muslim traders (known as Jabarti and Afkala) bought gold, coffee, and ivory. In the mid-to-late 1830s, Abba Bagibo forbade foreign merchants to travel beyond Saqqa, so merchants from Gondar, Adwa, Derita and Dawe were forced to meet in his capital their counterparts from Kaffa, Kullo, and other southern regions.[tpl]Ref Ethiopia|Abir-1968|pages= p. 90[/tpl] However, by the mid-19th century it was eclipsed by the capital of the Kingdom of Jimma, Hirmata.Mohammed Hassan, The Oromo, p. 135
Here the Italian explorers Antonio Cecchi and Giovanni Chiarini were prisoners of king Abba Gomoli II from 23 November 1878 to 29 January 1879, when Negus Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam was finally able to persuade the rulers of Limmu-Ennarea to release them.during the Italian occupation, an Italian captain managed to handle the local population so badly that they were provoked and started something of a rebellion. By October 1937, reportedly the captain could hardly move outside his fort."Local History in Ethiopia" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 3 January 2008)
