[[10]]

CATEGORIES: 10

Year 10 (X) was a common year starting on Wednesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, throughout Roman Empire, it was known as the year of the consulship of Dolabella and Silanus (or, less frequently, year 763 ''ab urbe condita''). The denomination 10 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for counting years.
