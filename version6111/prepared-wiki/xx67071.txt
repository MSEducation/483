"Billie Jean" is a song by the American recording artist Michael Jackson. It is the second single from the singer's sixth solo album, Thriller (1982). It was written and composed by Michael Jackson and produced by him and Quincy Jones. Originally disliked by Jones, the track was almost removed from the album after he and Jackson had disagreements regarding it. There are contradictory claims to what the song's lyrics refer to. One suggests that they are derived from a real-life experience, in which a female fan claimed that Jackson had fathered one of her twins. Jackson himself, however, stated that "Billie Jean" was based on groupies he had encountered. The song is well known for its distinctive bassline and Jackson's vocal hiccups. The song was mixed 91 times by audio engineer Bruce Swedien before it was finalized.
"Billie Jean" became a worldwide commercial and critical success; "Billie Jean" was one of the best-selling singles of 1983 and is one of the best-selling singles worldwide. The song topped both the US and UK charts simultaneously. In other countries, "Billie Jean" topped the charts of Switzerland and reached the top ten in Austria, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. "Billie Jean" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1989. Rolling Stone magazine placed "Billie Jean" in the 58th spot on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.
Awarded numerous honors — including two Grammy Awards, one American Music Award and an induction into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame — the song and corresponding music video propelled Thriller to the status of best-selling album of all time. The song was promoted with a short film that broke down MTV's racial barrier as the first video by a black artist to be aired in heavy rotation.  Also, Jackson's Emmy-nominated performance on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, in which Jackson premiered his "moonwalk" also helped to popularize the song. The song was also promoted through Jackson's Pepsi commercials; during the filming of one commercial, Jackson's scalp was severely burned. Covered by modern artists, "Billie Jean" sealed Jackson's status as an international pop icon.

==Background==

Jackson stated several times that "Billie Jean" was based on the groupies he and his brothers encountered while part of The Jackson 5.Jackson, pp. 192–194Wadhams, pp. 418–422[tpl]cite news|title= Billie Jean files lawsuit saying that he is the one |date= December 20, 2008 |work= Philadelphia Daily News |url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&%7CDN&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=125F801F015B5DC8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |accessdate= March 13, 2010[/tpl] "Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a lot of girls. They used to call them groupies in the '60s." He added: "They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers."[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1615349/michael-jackson-answers-fan-questions-1996.jhtml |title= Michael Jackson Answers Fan Questions In 1996 Thailand Interview |first= Jocelyn |last= Vena |date= July 6, 2009 |publisher= MTV |accessdate= March 13, 2010[/tpl]
Jackson biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli promoted the theory that "Billie Jean" was derived from a real life experience the singer faced in 1981. The Magic & The Madness documents how a young woman wrote Jackson a letter, which informed the singer that he was the father of one of her twins.Taraborrelli, pp. 223–224[tpl]cite news|first= Sport |last= Murphy |title= Man in the moonwalk |url= http://www.nypost.com/seven/01272008/entertainment/music/man_in_the_moonwalk_427676.htm?page=0 |date= January 27, 2008 |work= New York Post |accessdate= February 15, 2009[/tpl] Jackson, who regularly received letters of this kind, had never met the woman in question and ignored it. The woman, however, continued to send Jackson more letters, which stated that she loved him and wanted to be with him. She wrote of how happy they would be if they raised the child together. She pondered how Jackson could ignore his own flesh and blood. The letters disturbed the singer to the extent that he suffered nightmares.
Following the letters, Jackson received a parcel containing a photograph of the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.

==Production==

Michael Jackson wrote "Billie Jean" with his female fans in mind, and later stated that when he wrote the song, he knew it would be a success: "A musician knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. I knew it was going to be big when I was writing it." The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: "The kid probably saved our lives."
Jackson faced numerous disagreements with the song's co-producer. Quincy Jones did not want "Billie Jean" to appear on Thriller; he felt that the song was too weak to be part of the collection.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/the-genius-----of-jacko-1681301.html |title= The genius of Jacko |first= Susan |last= Daly |date= March 21, 2009 |work= Irish Independent |accessdate= March 13, 2010[/tpl] The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song's bassline.Halstead, pp. 36–37 Jones wanted to cut Jackson's 29-second introduction, which was the longest one ever created at the time.[tpl]cite news |title= The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born: Number 1 |work= Blender |date= October 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= Thrills and spills and record breaks |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7117000.stm |first= Denise |last= Winterman |date= November 30, 2007 |work= BBC News |publisher= BBC |accessdate= March 13, 2010[/tpl] The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept.

In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted neither and the two fell out for several days.
Having resolved their differences, Jones had Jackson sing his vocal overdubs through a six-foot-long cardboard tube. Jackson's entire lead vocal was performed in one take; he had received vocal training every morning throughout the production of the song. Jazz saxophonist Tom Scott played the lyricon. Bass guitarist Louis Johnson was then brought in and he played his part on every guitar he owned, before Jackson finally settled for a Yamaha bass. Greg Phillinganes was also drafted in and he played the keyboard.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] He later said of the song, "'Billie Jean' is hot on every level. It's (sic) hot rhythmically moving action got Michael excited. It's hot sonically, because the instrumentation is so minimal, you can really hear everything. It's hot melodically ... lyrically and vocally. It affects you physically, emotionally, even spiritually."
The song was mixed by Bruce Swedien ninety-one times — unusual for Swedien, who usually mixed a song just once. Jones had told Swedien to create a drum sound that no one had ever heard before. The audio engineer was also told to add a different element: "sonic personality". "What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little things, like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat" Swedien later wrote. "The bottom line is that there aren't many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is." He concluded, "But I think that is the case with 'Billie Jean' — and that I attribute to sonic personality."

==Composition==

"Billie Jean" blends elements of post-disco,[tpl]cite web|title= Post-Disco |archiveurl= http://archive.is/Kk6tZ |archivedate= January 16, 2013 |work= Allmusic |url= http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/post-disco-ma0000012124/songs |accessdate= November 21, 2013 |publisher= All Media Network[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title= The Legacy of Michael Jackson |first= Adeyinka |last= Makinde |year= 2009 |quote= the song ‘Billie Jean’, presents rhythm and blues in a post-disco dance form. |url= http://www.black-history-month.co.uk/sitea/artists/micheal_jackson/articles/THE_LEGACY_OF_MICHAEL_JACKSON.html |work= Black-history-month.co.uk |accessdate= October 27, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title= The Year in Music – 1983 |quote= On the dance floor, David Bowie's "Let's Dance" and Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" defined the post-disco beat. |url= http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id199.htm |accessdate= October 27, 2013 |work= Eightiesclub.tripod.com[/tpl] rhythm and blues,[tpl]cite book|first= Richard J. |last= Ripani |year= 2006 |title= The New Blue Music: Changes in Rhythm & Blues, 1950–1999 |publisher= University Press of Mississippi |page= 146 |isbn= 1-57806-862-2[/tpl] funk, and dance-pop. The song opens with a standard drum beat along with a standard hi-hat, and it contains hardly any reverberation. After two bars, another standard open hi-hat enters. After two more bars, a repetitive bassline enters. Each time it passes through the tonic, the note is doubled by a distorted synth bass. This accompaniment is followed by a repetitive three-note synth, played staccato with a deep reverb. The defining chord progression is then established. Jackson's quiet vocals enter, accompanied by a finger-snap, which comes and goes during the verses, as the rhythm and chord progression repeats.
According to Daryl Hall, when Jackson was recording “We Are the World,” Jackson approached him and admitted to lifting the bassline for "Billie Jean" from a Hall & Oates song (apparently referring to Hall's "I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)" from the 1981 album Private Eyes): "Michael Jackson once said directly to me that he hoped I didn't mind that he copied that groove." Hall says he told Jackson that he had lifted the bassline himself, remarking, "it's something we all do."[tpl]cite web|url= http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_hall_oates_cant/ |title= Classic Tracks: Hall & Oates "I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)" |first= Gary |last= Eskow |work= Mix Online |publisher= NewBay Media |date= April 1, 2006 |quote= Listening to “I Can't Go for That” after letting it drift out of the mind for a while, one can clearly identify this track — one of the first pop hits to feature a drum machine — as a precursor to Michael Jackson's “Billie Jean” and the generation of songs built on drum machine tracks that came in its wake. “No question about it,” Hall agrees. “Michael Jackson once said directly to me that he hoped I didn't mind that he copped that groove. That's okay; it's something we all do. Eddie Van Halen told me that he copied the synth part from ‘Kiss on My List’ and used it in ‘Jump.’ I don't have a problem with that at all. |accessdate= January 13, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|first= Daryl |last= Hall |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-jackson-remembered-daryl-hall-on-the-ultimate-video-star-20090709 |title= Michael Jackson Remembered: Daryl Hall on the Ultimate Video Star |date= July 10, 2009 |work= Rolling Stone |accessdate= October 15, 2010 |publisher= Jann Wenner |quote= He sort of clung to Diana Ross pretty much, but at one point I was off to the side and he came over to me and said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I stole Billie Jean from you,' and I said, 'It's all right, man, I just ripped the base line off, so can you!'[/tpl]
According to Inside the Hits, the lyrics refer to the commotion created by Billie Jean on a dance floor. She entices the crowd with a seductive come-on before luring Jackson to her bedroom, through the fragrance of her perfume. Jackson's vocal range spanned from a high baritone to a falsetto and he usually wrote melodies to show this range. However, in the verses of "Billie Jean", the singer's vocals range from a tenor to a low falsetto. A four note falsetto is showcased in the chorus and, during the last line, Jackson peaks at a full octave. The song has a tempo of 117 beats per minute and is in the key of F-sharp minor. Following the first chorus, a cello-like synth eases in at the beginnings of both the third, and later, the fourth, verses. Upon the announcement that the baby's eyes resemble Jackson's, a voice laments, "oh no". This is met with Jackson's signature falsetto "hee hee". The bridge debuts the strings, and holds a pedal tone tonic with the exception of two lines and a chord leading into the chorus. Violins are then played, followed by a four-note minor guitar solo. During the solo, vocal shouts, screams and laughs are added. Throughout this, the chord progression remains unaltered and is laced with Jackson's vocal hiccups. All the musical and vocal elements are then brought together in the final chorus. In the fade, Jackson repeats the denial of fathering Billie Jean's child.

==Release and reception==

On December 1, 1982, Thriller was released to critical and commercial success.Taraborrelli, p. 222 A month later, on January 2, 1983, "Billie Jean" was released as the album's second single; it followed Jackson's successful duet with Paul McCartney on "The Girl Is Mine".Halstead, pp. 37–38George, p. 39 The song reached number one on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, where it remained for seven weeks. "Billie Jean" topped the R&B chart within three weeks, and became Jackson's fastest rising number one single since "ABC", "The Love You Save" and "I'll Be There" in 1970. It remained at number one for nine weeks, before the single was eventually replaced by The Gap Band's "Outstanding". "Billie Jean" peaked at number 9 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. It was also number one in the UK Singles Chart. "Billie Jean" and Thriller topped both the singles and album charts in the same week. This occurred on both sides of the Atlantic simultaneously, a feat very few acts have ever achieved. The song was the third best selling single of 1983 in the US and ninth in the UK. "Billie Jean" also reached number one in Switzerland, the top ten in Austria, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden.
In a Rolling Stone review, Christopher Connelly described "Billie Jean" as a "lean, insistent funk number whose message couldn't be more blunt: 'She says I am the one/But the kid is not my son'". He added that the track was a "sad, almost mournful song, but a thumping resolve underlies Jackson's feelings".[tpl]cite web|accessdate= January 13, 2014 |archivedate= February 5, 2007 |title= Rolling Stone's Thriller review |work= Rolling Stone |publisher= Jann Wenner |date= January 21, 1997 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070205080932/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/michaeljackson/albums/album/303823/review/6067536/thriller |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/michaeljackson/albums/album/303823/review/6067536/thriller |first= Christopher |last= Connelly[/tpl] Blender stated that the song was "one of the most sonically eccentric, psychologically fraught, downright bizarre things ever to land on Top 40 radio". They added that it was "frighteningly stark, with a pulsing, cat-on-the-prowl bass figure, whip-crack downbeat and eerie multi-tracked vocals ricocheting in the vast spaces between keyboards and strings". Overall, the magazine described the track as "a five-minute-long nervous breakdown, set to a beat". Stylus said of the song, "It's one of the best representations of film noir in pop music, ending with no resolution except a single mother and selfish, careless scumball."[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/diamond/michael-jackson-thriller.htm |title= Michael Jackson – Thriller – The Diamond |accessdate= February 21, 2009 |publisher= Stylus Magazine |first= Tal |last= Rosenberg |date= June 19, 2007[/tpl] In a review of Thriller 25, Allmusic observed that "Billie Jean" was "startling" in its "futuristic funk".[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/blog/post/the-funk-of-25-years-thriller-hits-the-quarter-century-mark |title= The Funk of 25 Years: Thriller Hits The Quarter Century Mark |accessdate= January 13, 2014 |publisher= All Media Network |work= Allmusic |first= Stephen |last= Thomas Erlewine |authorlink= Stephen Thomas Erlewine[/tpl] The track also won praise from Jackson biographers. Nelson George stated that Jerry Hey's string arrangement added danger to "Billie Jean", while J. Randy Taraborrelli added that it was "dark and sparse" by Quincy Jones' production standards.George, p. 23
"Billie Jean" has been recognized with numerous awards and honors. At the 1984 Grammy Awards the song earned Jackson two of a record eight awards; Best R&B Song and Best R&B Male Vocal Performance. It won the Billboard Music Award for favorite dance/disco 12" LP, and the magazine's 1980's poll named "Billie Jean" as the "Black Single of the Decade". The American Music Awards recognized the track as the Favorite Pop/Rock Single, while Cash Box honored the song with the awards for Top Pop Single and Top Black Single. The track was recognised with the Top International Single award by the Canadian Black Music Awards, and awarded the Black Gold Award for Single of the Year. "Billie Jean" has also been awarded for its sales. It won the National Association of Recording Merchandisers Gift of Music award for best selling single in 1984. By 1989, the standard format single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of at least one million units.Halstead, pp. 38–40George, pp. 39–43 The digital sales of "Billie Jean" were certified gold in 2005, for shipments of at least 500,000 units.[tpl]cite web|title= RIAA – Gold & Platinum Searchable Database – Billie Jean |url= http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Billie+Jean%22 |accessdate= February 24, 2009 |publisher= RIAA[/tpl] The total number of digital downloads of the song in the US, as of September 2011, stands at 2.2 million.[tpl]cite web|title= Ask Billboard: Who Has the Most Million-Selling Downloads? |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/467006/ask-billboard-who-has-the-most-million-selling-downloads |first= Gary |last= Trust |work= Billboard |publisher= Prometheus Global Media |date= September 30, 2011 |accessdate= May 7, 2012[/tpl] The digital sales of "Billie Jean" were certified 2x Platinum in US on May 9, 2013.[tpl]cite web|date= May 9, 2013 |url= http://riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=gp-gold-platinum-news&news_month_filter=5&news_year_filter=2013 |title= RIAA Adds Digital Streams To Historic Gold & Platinum Awards |accessdate= January 13, 2014 |publisher= RIAA[/tpl]

===Music video===

The short film for Jackson's "Billie Jean" is considered the video that brought MTV, until then a fairly new and unknown music channel, into mainstream attention. It was one of the first videos by a black artist to be aired regularly by the channel, as the network's executives felt black music wasn't "rock" enough.Campbell, p. 58 Directed by Steve Barron, the video shows a photographer who follows Jackson. The paparazzo never catches the singer, and when photographed Jackson fails to materialise on the developed picture. The entertainer dances his way to Billie Jean's hotel room and as he walks along a sidewalk, each tile lights up at his touch.[tpl]cite web|title= Michael Jackson: A Life in Film |first= Sean |last= Weitner |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20030306071527/http://www.flakmag.com/music/mj/videos.html |archivedate= March 6, 2003 |accessdate= February 15, 2009 |url= http://www.flakmag.com/music/mj/videos.html |work= Flak Magazine[/tpl] After he performs a quick spin, Jackson jumps and lands, freeze framed, on his toes. Upon arrival at the hotel, Jackson climbs the staircase to Billie Jean's room. Each step lights up as he touches it and a burnt out "Hotel" sign illuminates as he passes. The paparazzo then arrives at the scene and watches as Jackson vanishes under the covers of Billie Jean's bed. Trailed by the police, the paparazzo is then arrested for spying on Billie Jean. Jackson sported a new look for the video; Jheri curled hair. Jackson's clothes, a black leather suit with a pink shirt and a red bow tie, were copied by children around the US. Imitation became so severe that, despite pupil protests, Bound Brook High School banned students from wearing a single white glove like Jackson had on during the performance of "Billie Jean" at Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever.[tpl]cite web|title= School bans Michael Jackson attire |date= March 13, 1984 |url= http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=7NsvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mPsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6799,4585740&dq |work= Lakeland Ledger |accessdate= March 13, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title= White gloves banned |work= Ottawa Citizen |accessdate= March 13, 2010 |url= http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=jdEyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ue8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=5326,1479180&dq |date= March 14, 1984[/tpl]
Walter Yetnikoff, the president of Jackson's record label, CBS, approached MTV to play the "Billie Jean" video. He became enraged when MTV refused to play the video, and threatened to go public with MTV's stance on black musicians. "I said to MTV, 'I'm pulling everything we have off the air, all our product. I'm not going to give you any more videos. And I'm going to go public and fucking tell them about the fact you don't want to play music by a black guy.'" MTV relented and played the "Billie Jean" video in heavy rotation along with Prince's "Little Red Corvette".

===Motown 25===

On March 25, 1983, Jackson performed "Billie Jean" to critical and popular acclaim. Staged at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever was a celebration of Motown Records' twenty-fifth anniversary (despite the fact that Motown, launched in 1959, was only 24 years old in 1983). Organised by Suzanne de Passe, the event was to feature all of the most popular Motown acts, both past and present. The Motown stars were to reunite for one evening, to pay tribute to Berry Gordy and acknowledge his effect on their lives. Jackson initially refused the invitation, and stated that he did not want to perform live, or perform with his brothers again. Jackson reconsidered after a personal visit from Gordy, for whom the singer had great respect. Jackson would perform on the condition that he have a solo spot. Gordy agreed and it was decided that the singer would perform "Billie Jean".Taraborrelli, pp. 234–240
Following performances by Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson and Mary Wells, The Jacksons took to the stage for their first group performance together in eight years. The brothers sang a medley of their old hits. After they finished with "I'll Be There", they left Michael alone on stage. Jackson addressed the audience and then went into his routine. He wore black pants, leather penny loafers, a black sequined jacket, and a single white rhinestone glove. To begin his performance, Jackson snapped a fedora to his head and struck a pose — his right hand on his hat and his left leg bent. He then threw the hat aside and lip synced to "Billie Jean". During a musical interlude, the singer executed a move which many claim to have sealed his status as a pop icon.[tpl]cite news|first= Todd |last= Leopold |title= Michael Jackson: A life in the spotlight |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Music/01/30/jackson.life/ |publisher= CNN |date= June 6, 2005 |accessdate= February 15, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first= Bob |last= Cannon |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,301524,00.html |title= A Giant Step for Jackson |work= Entertainment Weekly |date= March 25, 1994 |accessdate= February 15, 2009[/tpl] Jackson glided backwards to perform the moonwalk, before he spun on his heels and landed en pointe.

Another childhood idol, Sammy Davis, Jr., had admired Jackson's black sequined jacket during the performance and later received it as a gift.Campbell, pp. 65–68
Jackson stated at the time that he was disappointed in his performance; he had wanted to remain on his toes longer than he had. Jackson subsequently said that "Billie Jean" was one of his favorite songs to perform live, but only when he did not have to do it the way he had on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever. "The audience wants a certain thing — I have to do the moonwalk in that spot", he later said. "I'd like to do a different version."
In a Top 100 list compiled by VH1 and Entertainment Weekly in 2000, Jackson's performance was ranked as the sixth greatest rock 'n' roll TV moment.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/07/24/entertainment/main217999.shtml |title= Top Rock TV Moment A Really Big Show |publisher= CBS News |date= July 24, 2000 |accessdate= February 15, 2009[/tpl] Five years later, Entertainment Weekly named Jackson's Motown 25 performance as one of the most important pop culture moments in history. "It was a moment that crossed over in a way that no live musical performance ever had. There was a messianic quality to it", Entertainment Weekly editor Steve Daly commented.[tpl]cite news|title= The 25 Most Important Pop Culture Moments |date= September 1, 2005 |publisher= CNN |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2005/US/09/01/cnn25.top25.entertainment/index.html |accessdate= February 15, 2009[/tpl] The performance has been shown on television numerous times. It is also featured on the DVDs: HIStory on Film, Volume II and the bonus DVD of Thriller 25.

===Pepsi commercials===

In 1984, Pepsi sponsored The Jacksons' Victory Tour. In return, Michael and his brothers were to star in two commercials for the company.Taraborrelli, pp. 279–289 Jackson had reworked "Billie Jean" for the commercial and entitled it "Pepsi Generation". The song was used as the official jingle for the commercials and released as a 7" promo single. The launch of "The Choice of a New Generation" campaign in February 1984 was attended by 1,600 people who were issued with a programme and the 7" single.Halstead, p. 205 During the filming of the second commercial, a firework exploded and Jackson's hair caught fire. The incident left the singer in need of reconstructive surgery.[tpl]cite news|title= Milestones: Feb. 6, 1984 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954175,00.html |work= Time |accessdate= February 15, 2009 |date= February 6, 1984[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/19/us/singer-has-operation-to-repair-burn-scar.html |title= Singer Has Operation To Repair Burn Scar |work= The New York Times |date= April 19, 1984 |accessdate= February 15, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first= Richard |title= Too Much Risk on the Set? |last= Zoglin |authorlink= Richard Zoglin |date= February 13, 1984 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926474-1,00.html |work= Time |accessdate= February 15, 2009[/tpl] The commercials were premiered at the Grammy Awards, where Jackson wore a hairpiece to cover his burns as he collected a record eight awards.[tpl]cite news|title= People: Mar. 12, 1984 |date= March 19, 1984 |accessdate= February 15, 2009 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921610,00.html |work= The New York Times[/tpl]

==Live performances==

Along with "Thriller", "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" and "Beat It", Billie Jean was performed for all of Jackson's tour concerts. After the ending chorus, the drum solo is always extended for a period of time as Jackson dances under one spotlight. The song almost always ends with Jackson singing "Billie Jean is not my lover" and throwing his hat towards the audience. Exceptions are some of the concerts in the Victory Tour, where he held his hat up and threw it afterwards.  Since the Victory Tour, the performance has evolved in terms of dance moves and overall song length.
Performances of the song are available on the HIStory on Film, Volume II, HIStory World Tour, Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour and Live at Wembley July 16, 1988 video albums.

==Billie Jean 2008==

Jackson's original version of "Billie Jean" was remixed by rapper and hip hop artist Kanye West for Thriller 25, a 25th anniversary reissue of Jackson's Thriller. Entitled "Billie Jean 2008", the remix garnered a mixed reception; most critics felt that it was impossible to improve upon the original. Bill Lamb, of About.com, described the remix as "lifeless", and added that it sounded like West had "entered the studio fully intimidated by the genius of the original".[tpl]cite web|first= Bill |last= Lamb |url= http://top40.about.com/od/albums/fr/mjacksonthril25.htm |title= Michael Jackson – Thriller 25 |work= About.com |publisher= The New York Times Company |accessdate= February 21, 2009[/tpl] Pitchfork Media's Tom Ewing explained that a guest verse "might have added dynamics to the mix's clumsy claustrophobia".[tpl]cite web|first= Tom |last= Ewing |date= February 15, 2008 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080218122855/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/48645-thriller-25th-anniversary-edition |url= http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/48645-thriller-25th-anniversary-edition |title= Michael Jackson – Thriller: 25th Anniversary Edition |publisher= Pitchfork Media |accessdate= February 21, 2009 |archivedate= February 18, 2008[/tpl] Mike Joseph, in review of Thriller 25 for PopMatters, described the track listing of the reissue as "pleasant" but West's "lazy" remix was the only exception. He added, "You've been given the opportunity to remix the most iconic single from one of the most iconic albums of all time, and all you can do is stick a drum machine on top of the song's original arrangement?".[tpl]cite web|first= Mike |last= Joseph |url= http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/michael-jackson-thriller-25 |title= Michael Jackson: Thriller 25 |accessdate= February 21, 2009 |publisher= PopMatters[/tpl] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone disliked the removal of the original bassline, and compared it to "putting Bobby Orr on the ice without a hockey stick".[tpl]cite web|first= Rob |last= Sheffield |archivedate= February 17, 2008 |accessdate= February 21, 2009 |date= February 21, 2008 |work= Rolling Stone |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080217033454/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/18290476/review/18305830/thriller_25_deluxe_edition |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/18290476/review/18305830/thriller_25_deluxe_edition |publisher= RealNetworks |title= Michael Jackson – Thriller 25 Deluxe Edition[/tpl] IGN's Todd Gilchrist praised West's remix and stated that it was a "pretty great track".

Hopefully I'll get it done". The singer later covered "Thriller" on Golden Gaze, from his second solo album, Golden Greats.[tpl]cite web|work= NME |date= March 17, 2000 |url= http://www.nme.com/news/ian-brown/2901 |title= Brown's Thriller killer! |accessdate= February 21, 2009[/tpl]
"Billie Jean" was recorded by American rock musician Chris Cornell for his Carry On album in 2007. Cornell said of his cover, "I didn't plan on it. It just sort of happened organically. I changed the music quite a bit, I didn't touch the lyrics." He added, "And it's not a joke. I took a completely different approach to it, musically."[tpl]cite web|first= Chris |last= Harris |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1545231/20061108/cornell_chris.jhtml |title= Chris Cornell Tackles Gospel – And Michael Jackson? – On Solo LP |publisher= MTV |date= November 8, 2006 |accessdate= February 21, 2009[/tpl] Cornell had previously performed the song live in Europe, including an acoustic set in Stockholm, Sweden in September, 2006.

MTV noted the "bluesier, more pained and impassioned feel" which stripped away "any pop elements of the original". Los Angeles Times described the track as "a grim, spooky take" on Jackson's "Billie Jean", and added that it was "amusing enough, even if it sounds a lot more like Metallica's 'Nothing Else Matters'". The newspaper concluded that "Jacko's mega hit survived the stunt translation".[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.calendarlive.com/music/reviews/cl-2albums05,0,6398293.story?coll=cl-albumreviews |first= Steve |last= Appleford |title= POP ALBUM REVIEW – Chris Cornell |archivedate= November 14, 2007 |date= June 5, 2007 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071114062427/http://www.calendarlive.com/music/reviews/cl-2albums05,0,6398293.story?coll=cl-albumreviews |work= Los Angeles Times |accessdate= February 21, 2009[/tpl]

==Legacy==

Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" is considered one of the most revolutionary songs in the history of pop music.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/jul/12/popandrock |title= How Billie Jean changed the world |work= The Guardian |date= July 12, 2007 |accessdate= February 21, 2009[/tpl] To accompany a single with a high-production music video was groundbreaking. "Billie Jean" aided Thriller in becoming the biggest selling album of all time and has been referenced by performers such as Justin Timberlake, Chris Brown and Usher.[tpl]cite news|first= Ben |last= Rayner |url= http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/302097 |title= The return of Michael Jackson's Thriller |work= Toronto Star |date= February 10, 2008 |accessdate= February 21, 2009[/tpl] The Guardian reflected that "more thought went into the production of this single than would go into the entire recording careers of Axl Rose, Coldplay, Shania Twain or Gwen Stefani." Jackson's live performances of the song overshadowed the track; many preferred to watch him dance to "Billie Jean" rather than to simply listen to it. The song and accompanying performances contributed to Jackson's status as a pop icon.
It was popularly believed that "Billie Jean" was an autobiographical song, referring to someone who claimed Jackson was the father of her child.  Based on this theory, Lydia Murdock wrote the song "Superstar", which was a minor hit in 1983, intending this song as a criticism of Jackson's purported denial of paternity.[tpl]cite book|first= John |last= Tobler |year= 1992 |title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years |edition= 1st |publisher= Reed International Books Ltd |location= London |page= 386 |id= CN 5585[/tpl]
Frequently listed in polls of the best songs ever made, "Billie Jean" was named the greatest dance record of all time by BBC Radio 2 listeners. After the announcement of the winner, presenter Zoë Ball said, "I'm delighted that "Billie Jean" has been voted the greatest dance record ever made. This is Jackson at his best." She continued, "This track is way up there for me — Jacko's rendition of it at the Motown 25th anniversary show has got to be one of the great live performances of all time. The bassline is awesome, the production is killer. It's just perfect."[tpl]cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ifs_news/hi/newsid_7507000/7507218.stm |title= Billie Jean voted top dance song |publisher= BBC |date= July 15, 2008 |accessdate= February 21, 2009[/tpl] In a list compiled by Rolling Stone and MTV in 2000, the song was ranked as the sixth greatest pop song since 1963. "I Want You Back" and "Beat It" were placed at numbers 9 and 22 respectively. The Beatles' "Yesterday", which Jackson owned the rights to, was placed at number one.[tpl]cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/entertainment/1027940.stm |title= Yesterday is top pop song |publisher= BBC |date= November 17, 2000 |accessdate= February 21, 2009[/tpl]
In a 2005 poll conducted by Sony Ericsson, "Billie Jean" was ranked as the world's third favorite song. Over 700,000 people in 60 different countries cast their votes. Voters from the UK placed "Billie Jean" at number one, ahead of "Thriller", with a further five of the top ten being solo recordings by Jackson. The song was placed at number 7 in MTV Europe's All-Time Top Ten R&B Songs. In a survey of over 600,000 people, Channel 4 and HMV revealed "Billie Jean" as the 16th best song in their Music of the Millennium poll. Rolling Stone placed the song at #58 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time (2010).[tpl]cite web|accessdate= June 20, 2012 |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/michael-jackson-billie-jean-20110525 |title= 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: Michael Jackson, 'Billie Jean'[/tpl]
In an interview, R&B artist Pharrell Williams stated that "Billie Jean" was one of his favorite songs. "It is hard to say if there is a greater song than "Billie Jean". I think there will never be a song like this one again, with this bassline, with this kind of effect, this eternalness, this perfection."Thriller 25: The Book, p. 26 The song has featured in the film Charlie's Angels and the 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. When re-released as part of the Visionary campaign in 2006, "Billie Jean" charted at No. 11 in the UK. It remained in the top 200 for over 40 weeks and was the most successful reissue by some distance. To this day, "Billie Jean" is still in heavy rotation; it is played on over 90% of the world's radios and receives more than 250,000 spins per week in clubs around the world.
