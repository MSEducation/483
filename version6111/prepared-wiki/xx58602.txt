The Canton of Schaffhausen (German: [tpl]Audio|De-Schaffhausen.ogg|Schaffhausen[/tpl]) is a canton of Switzerland. The principal city and capital of the canton is Schaffhausen.

==History==

Schaffhausen was a city-state in the Middle Ages, documented to have struck its own coins starting in 1045. It was then known as Villa Scafhusun.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title = Schaffhausen (city) | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | volume = 24 | pages = 312 | year = 1911 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ajsEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA312 | accessdate = 2009-04-18 [/tpl] Around 1049 Count Eberhard von Nellenburg founded a Benedictine monastery which led to the development of a community. This community achieved independence in 1190. In 1330 the town lost not only all its lands but also its independence to the Habsburgs. Then, in 1415 the Habsburg Duke Frederick IV of Austria sided with the Antipope John XXIII at the Council of Constance, and was banned by the Emperor Sigismund. As a result of the ban and Frederick's need of money, Schaffhausen was able to buy its independence from the Habsburgs in 1418. The city allied with six of the Swiss confederates in 1454 and allied with a further two (Uri and Unterwalden) in 1479.  Schaffhausen became a full member of the Old Swiss Confederation in 1501. The first railroad came to Schaffhausen in 1857. In 1944 Schaffhausen suffered from a bombing raid by United States Army Air Forces planes that accidentally strayed from Germany to neutral Switzerland.
The cantonal constitution was written in 1876 and revised in 1895.
The distinctive coat of arms bears the Schaffhauser Bock, (Billy Goat of Schaffhausen).

It lies west of Lake Constance and has a size of [tpl]convert|298|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].Canton Schaffhausen website, Geography [tpl]de_icon[/tpl]. Retrieved 18 April 2009  Much of the canton is productive agricultural land, with [tpl]convert|134.4|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] (about 45%) of the canton used for agriculture while an additional [tpl]convert|128.7|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] (about 43%) is wooded.  Most of the rest of the canton, [tpl]convert|31.8|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] (about 10%), is developed while only [tpl]convert|3.8|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] (1.3%) of the canton is unproductive (rivers, lakes or mountains).[tpl]cite web | last = Federal Department of Statistics | title = Arealstatistik – Kantonsdaten nach 15 Nutzungsarten| year = 2008 | url = http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/02/03/blank/key/01/zustand_und_entwicklung__tabelle.html | format = Microsoft Excel | accessdate = 2009-01-15 [/tpl][tpl]de_icon[/tpl]
The canton's territory is divided into three segments where German territory reaches the Rhine.  The large central part, which includes the capital Schaffhausen, in turn separates the German exclave of Büsingen am Hochrhein from the rest of Germany.  The small district of Rüdlingen-Buchberg lies to the southwest, and the third part contains Ramsen and Stein am Rhein to the east.  With the exception Vor der Brugg, part of Stein am Rhein, all three segments are separated from the rest of Switzerland by the Rhine.
Most of the canton lies on a plateau dominated by the Hoher Randen. The summit of this mountain is [tpl]convert|912|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The slopes of the mountain are gentle towards the south where it reaches the Rhine valley. Short and narrow valleys intersect these gentle slopes. The Klettgau is one such valley.
The Rhine Falls are the largest waterfalls in Europe and lie on the border of the canton of Schaffhausen and the canton of Zurich.
