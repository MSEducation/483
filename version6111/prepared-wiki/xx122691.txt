Portugal's first participation in the Summer Olympic Games took place at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden. The nation was represented by a delegation of six competitors, who took part in three sports but failed to win a medal. The Portuguese debut participation was marked tragically by the death of flag bearer Francisco Lázaro, who succumbed to serious dehydration after the marathon race.
