The Setesdal Line ([tpl]lang-no|Setesdalsbanen[/tpl]) is a heritage railway between Kristiansand and Byglandsfjord in southern Norway, 78 km long. It was built with a narrow gauge of [tpl]RailGauge|1067mm[/tpl], and opened to Hægeland 26 November 1895, and to Byglandsfjord 27 November 1896. Stations along the line included Mosby, Vennesla, Grovene (Grovane), Iveland and Hægeland.

==History==

When the Sørlandet Line was opened to Kristiansand in 1938, Grovane became the new terminal station for the Setesdal Line, with connection to the Sørlandet Line.
The Sørlandet Line was suspended from 1 September 1962, and the track was demolished between Byglandsfjord and Beihølen. The 6 km line between Beihølen and Grovane was, however, preserved by local enthusiasts. The Setesdalsbanen Hobby Club was established already in 1964.
Today, the Sørlandet Line is a railway museum with steam trains serving the 8 km line between Grovane and Røyknes. Four steam locomotives from 1894-1902 are preserved, along with a number of passenger and freight cars.
