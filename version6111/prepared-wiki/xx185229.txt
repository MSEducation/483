Dio of Alexandria ([tpl]lang-el|Δίων[/tpl]) was an Academic philosopher and a friend of Antiochus of Ascalon who lived in the 1st century BC. He was sent by his fellow-citizens as ambassador to Rome, to complain about the conduct of their king, Ptolemy XII Auletes. On his arrival at Rome he was poisoned by the king's secret agents, and the strongest suspicion of the murder fell upon Marcus Caelius.Cicero, Academica, iv. 4, pro Cael. 10, 21; Strabo, xvii.
