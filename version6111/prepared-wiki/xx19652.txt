The LGM-30 Minuteman is a United States land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), in service with the United States Air Force Global Strike Command. As of 2014, the LGM-30G Minuteman-III version is the only land-based ICBM in service in the United States. It is one component of the US nuclear triad—the other two parts of the triad being the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), and nuclear weapons carried by long-range strategic bombers. Each missile carries up to three nuclear warheads, which have a yield in the range of 300 to 500 kilotons. The Minuteman was the first MIRV-capable missile.
The letter “L” in “LGM” indicates that the missile is silo-launched; the “G” indicates that it is designed to attack ground targets; the “M” indicates that it is a guided missile.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=113 |title=Factsheets : LGM-30G Minuteman III |publisher=Af.mil |date=2010-07-26 |accessdate=2011-03-20|archiveurl=http://archive.is/HYdz|archivedate=2012-12-12[/tpl]
The name “Minuteman” comes from the Revolutionary War’s Minutemen. It also refers to its quick reaction time; the missile can be launched within minutes after the receipt of a valid launch order.[tpl]citation | format = PDF | url = http://csis.org/images/stories/poni/110921_Bott.pdf | publisher = Center for Strategic and International Studies | title = Unique and Complementary Characteristics of the U.S. ICBM and SLBM Weapons Systems by Mitch Bott | year = Date unspecified | page = 76[/tpl].[tpl]citation | format = PDF | url = http://csis.org/images/stories/poni/090827_unique_characteristics_icbm_slbm_systems.pdf | publisher = Center for Strategic and International Studies/Northrop Grumman | title = Discussion of the Unique and Complementary Characteristics of the ICBM and SLBM Weapon Systems | year = 2009 | page = 5[/tpl].

==History==

The previous versions, Minuteman-I and Minuteman-II, were in service from 1962 until 1997.
The Minuteman had two innovations that gave it a long practical service life, a solid rocket booster and a digital flight computer. This computer was one of the very first recognizably modern embedded systems.
The solid rocket booster made the Minuteman faster to launch than earlier ICBMs, which used liquid rocket propellants.
A reprogrammable inertial guidance system was a major risk in the original program. When first proposed, no one had built a digital computer that would fit in a missile. One program, the SM-64 Navaho, had already failed to produce such a system.
A digital computer was essential to obtain the accuracy gains that kept this weapon effective throughout the Cold War. As the Defense Mapping Agency (now part of National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency) mapped mass concentrations in the Earth more accurately, the inertial guidance software could be updated and loaded into the missiles to make them ever more accurate by having them compensate for these sources of gravity. Another gain that persuaded program managers to accept the risk of the computer was that the computer could also be used to test the missile, saving a large amount of weight in cables and connectors.

===Minuteman-I (LGM-30A/B or SM-80/HSM-80A)===

====Deployment====

The LGM-30A Minuteman-I was first test-fired on 1 February 1961,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/spp/military/program/6555th/6555c3-8.htm |title=The 6555th, Chapter III, Section 8, The MINUTEMAN Ballistic Missile Test Program |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=2011-03-20[/tpl] and entered into the Strategic Air Command’s arsenal in 1962, at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana;[tpl]cite web|title=BOEING LGM-30A MINUTEMAN IA|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=537|publisher=National Museum of the Air Force|accessdate=13 November 2013[/tpl] the “improved” LGM-30B became operational at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming, and Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri in 1963. All 800 Minuteman-I missiles were delivered by June 1965. Each of the bases had 150 missiles emplaced. F.E. Warren AFB had 200 of the Minuteman-IB missiles. Malmstrom AFB had 150 of the Minuteman-I and about five years later added 50 of the Minuteman-II similar to those installed at Grand Forks AFB, ND.

====Guidance====

The Minuteman-I Autonetics D-17 flight computer used a rotating air bearing magnetic disk holding 2,560 “cold-stored” words in 20 tracks (write heads disabled after program fill) of 24 bits each and one alterable track of 128 words. The time for a D-17 disk revolution was 10 ms. The D-17 also used a number of short loops for faster access of intermediate results storage. The D-17 computational minor cycle was three disk revolutions or 30 ms. During that time all recurring computations were performed. For ground operations the inertial platform was aligned and gyro correction rates updated. During flight, filtered command outputs were sent each minor cycle to the engine nozzles. Unlike modern computers, which use descendants of that technology for secondary storage on hard disk, the disk was the active computer memory. The disk storage was considered hardened to radiation from nearby nuclear explosions, making it an ideal storage medium. To improve computational speed, the D-17 borrowed an instruction look-ahead feature from the Autonetics-built Field Artillery Data Computer (M18 FADAC) that permitted simple instruction execution every word time.
The D-17B and the D-37C guidance and control computers were integral components of the Minuteman-I and Minuteman-II missiles, respectively, which formed a part of the United States ICBM arsenal. The Minuteman-III missiles, which use D-37D computers, complete the 1000 missile deployment of this system. The initial cost of these computers ranged from about $139,000 (D-37C) to $250,000 (D-17B).

===Minuteman-II (LGM-30F)===

The LGM-30F Minuteman-II was an improved version of the Minuteman-I missile. Development on the Minuteman-II began in 1962 as the Minuteman-I entered the Strategic Air Command’s nuclear force. Minuteman-II production and deployment began in 1965 and completed in 1967. It had an increased range, a greater throw weight and guidance system with better azimuthal coverage, providing military planners with better accuracy and a wider range of targets. Some missiles also carried penetration aids, allowing higher probability of kill against Moscow’s anti-ballistic missile system. The payload consisted of a single Mk-11C reentry vehicle containing a W56 nuclear warhead with a yield of 1.2 megatons of TNT (5 PJ).
The major new features provided by Minuteman-II were:
System modernization was concentrated on launch facilities and command and control facilities. This provided decreased reaction time and increased survivability when under nuclear attack. Final changes to the system were performed to increase compatibility with the expected LGM-118A Peacekeeper. These newer missiles were later deployed into modified Minuteman silos.
The Minuteman-II program was the first mass-produced system to use a computer constructed from integrated circuits (the Autonetics D-37C). The Minuteman-II integrated circuits were diode-transistor logic and diode logic made by Texas Instruments. The other major customer of early integrated circuits was the Apollo Guidance Computer, which had similar weight and ruggedness constraints. The Apollo integrated circuits were resistor-transistor logic made by Fairchild Semiconductor. The Minuteman-II flight computer continued to use rotating magnetic disks for primary storage.

===Minuteman-III (LGM-30G): the current model [tpl]anchor|Minuteman-III (LGM-30G)|reason=For wiki redirects[/tpl]===

The LGM-30G Minuteman-III program started in 1966, and included several improvements over the previous versions. It was first deployed in 1970. Most modifications related to the final stage and reentry system (RS). The final (third) stage was improved with a new fluid-injected motor, giving finer control than the previous four-nozzle system.
Performance improvements realized in Minuteman-III include increased flexibility in reentry vehicle (RV) and penetration aids deployment, increased survivability after a nuclear attack, and increased payload capacity. The missile retains a gimballed inertial guidance system.
Minuteman-III originally contained the following distinguishing features:
