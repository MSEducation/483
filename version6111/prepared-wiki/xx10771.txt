Reaganomics ([tpl]IPAc-en|r|eɪ|g|ə|ˈ|n|ɒ|m|ɪ|k|s[/tpl]; a portmanteau of Reagan and economics attributed to Paul Harvey)[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/28/AR2009022802096_2.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |title=Broadcaster Delivered 'The Rest of the Story' |accessdate=March 1, 2009 |date=March 1, 2009 | first=Joe | last=Holley[/tpl] refers to the economic policies promoted by U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the 1980s and still widely practiced. These policies are commonly associated with supply-side economics, referred to as trickle-down economics by political opponents and free market economics by political advocates.
The four pillars of Reagan's economic policy were to reduce the growth of government spending, reduce the federal income tax and capital gains tax, reduce government regulation, and tighten the money supply in order to reduce inflation.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last1=Niskanen |first1=William A. |authorlink=William A.

==Historical context==

Prior to the Reagan administration, the United States economy experienced a decade of rising unemployment and inflation (known as stagflation). Political pressure favored stimulus resulting in an expansion of the money supply. President Richard Nixon's wage and price controls were phased out.[tpl]cite book |first=Alan |last=Greenspan |authorlink=Alan Greenspan |title=The Age of Turbulence |publisher=Penguin Press |year=2007 [/tpl] The federal oil reserves were created to ease any future short term shocks. President Jimmy Carter had begun phasing out price controls on petroleum, while he created the Department of Energy. Much of the credit for the resolution of the stagflation is given to two causes: a three-year contraction of the money supply by the Federal Reserve Board under Paul Volcker, initiated in the last year of Carter's presidency (and continued during the Reagan presidency), and long-term easing of supply and pricing in oil during the 1980s oil glut.
In his stated intention to increase defense spending while lowering taxes, Reagan's approach was a departure from his immediate predecessors. Reagan enacted lower marginal tax rates in conjunction with simplified income tax codes and continued deregulation. During Reagan's presidency the annual deficits averaged 4.2% of GDP[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12039/HistoricalTables%5B1%5D.pdf |title=CBO Historical Tables |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04[/tpl] after inheriting an annual deficit of 2.7% of GDP in 1980 under president Carter. The real (inflation adjusted) rate of growth in federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan. GDP per working-age adult, which had increased at only a 0.8% annual rate during the Carter administration, increased at a 1.8% rate during the Reagan administration. The increase in productivity growth was even higher: output per hour in the business sector, which had been roughly constant in the Carter years, increased at a 1.4% rate in the Reagan years.
Before Reagan's election, supply side policy was considered unconventional by the moderate wing of the Republican Party, though in reality John F. Kennedy in his 1963 State of the Union address,  proposed substantial reduction in marginal tax rates, as well as a reduction in corporate tax rates. While running against Reagan for the Presidential nomination in 1980, George H. W. Bush had derided Reaganomics as "voodoo economics".[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/270292.stm |title=Reagonomics or 'voodoo economics'? |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-06-05 |accessdate=2012-01-04[/tpl] Similarly, in 1976, Gerald Ford had severely criticized Reagan's proposal to turn back a large part of the Federal budget to the states. Reagan's policies have since become widely accepted by many Republicans.

==Justifications==

In his 1980 campaign speeches, Reagan presented his economic proposals as a return to the free enterprise principles, free market economy that had been in favor before the Great Depression and FDR's New Deal policies. At the same time he attracted a following from the supply-side economics movement, which formed in opposition to Keynesian demand-stimulus economics. This movement produced some of the strongest supporters for Reagan's policies during his term in office.
The contention of the proponents, that the tax rate cuts would more than cover any increases in federal debt, was influenced by a theoretical taxation model based on the elasticity of tax rates, known as the Laffer curve. Arthur Laffer's model predicts that excessive tax rates actually reduce potential tax revenues, by lowering the incentive to produce; the model also predicts that insufficient tax rates (rates below the optimum level for a given economy) lead directly to a reduction in tax revenues.

==Policies==

President Reagan lifted remaining domestic petroleum price and allocation controls on January 28, 1981,[tpl]Cite web |title=Executive Order 12287 – Decontrol of Crude Oil and Refined Petroleum Products |date=January 28, 1981 |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1981/12881a.htm[/tpl] and lowered the oil windfall profits tax in August 1981. He ended the oil windfall profits tax in 1988.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.taxhistory.org/thp/readings.nsf/cf7c9c870b600b9585256df80075b9dd/edf8de04e58e4b14852570ba0048848b | title=Historical Perspective: The Windfall Profit Tax|date=Nov 10, 2005|author=Joseph J. Thorndike|accessdate=August 14, 2013[/tpl] Reagan followed his 1981 tax cuts with the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which sought to eliminate deductions, lower marginal rates for the wealthy, raise taxes on those earning less than $50,000 and simplify the number of tax brackets.

The 1982 tax increase undid a third of the initial tax cut. In 1983 Reagan instituted a payroll tax increase on Social Security and Medicare hospital insurance.

With the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Reagan and Congress sought to raise taxes on lower incomes, eliminate many deductions, and reduce the highest marginal rates. In 1983, Democrats Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt had offered a proposal; in 1984 Reagan had the Treasury Department produce its own plan. The eventual bipartisan 1986 act aimed to be revenue-neutral: while it reduced the top marginal rate, it also cleaned up the tax base by removing certain tax write-offs, preferences, and exceptions, thus raising the effective tax on activities previously specially favored by the code. Ultimately, the combination of the increase in tax rates on lower incomes and decrease in deductions raised revenue equal to about 4% of existing tax revenue.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.aei.org/article/economics/fiscal-policy/taxes/the-tax-reform-evidence-from-1986/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=The tax reform evidence from 1986 | date=October 24, 2011 | accessdate=January 21, 2012 | first1=Martin | last1=Feldstein[/tpl]
The primary effect of the tax changes over the course of Reagan's term in office was a change in the composition of federal receipts, towards more payroll taxes and new investment taxes, and away from higher earners and capital gains on existing investments. Federal revenue share of GDP fell from 19.6% in fiscal 1981 to 17.3% in 1984, before rising back to 18.4% by fiscal year 1989. Personal income tax revenues fell during this period relative to GDP, while payroll tax revenues rose relative to GDP.  President Ronald Reagan's 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income reduced the maximum capital gains rate to only 20%—its lowest level since the Hoover administration.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.ctj.org/hid_ent/part-2/part2-2.htm | publisher=Citizens for Tax Justice | title=The Hidden Entitlements: Capital Gains |accessdate=August 15, 2012[/tpl] This tax benefits the wealthy; however, in 1986 President Reagan set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages, with both topping out at 28 percent.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/us/politics/for-wealthy-tax-cuts-since-1980s-have-been-gain-gain.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Since 1980s, the Kindest of Tax Cuts for the Rich | date=2012-01-18 | accessdate=January 21, 2012 | first1=David | last1=Kocieniewski[/tpl]
Reagan significantly increased public expenditures, primarily the Department of Defense, which rose (in constant 2000 dollars) from $267.1 billion in 1980 (4.9% of GDP and 22.7% of public expenditure) to $393.1 billion in 1988 (5.8% of GDP and 27.3% of public expenditure); most of those years military spending was about 6% of GDP, exceeding this number in 4 different years. All these numbers had not been seen since the end of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1973.Historical tables, Budget of the United States Government, 2013, table 6.1. In 1981, Reagan significantly reduced the maximum tax rate, which affected the highest income earners, and lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 50%; in 1986 he further reduced the rate to 28%.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/effective_tax_rates2004.pdf |title= Effective Federal Tax Rates: 1979–2001 | publisher = Bureau of Economic Analysis | date = July 10, 2007[/tpl] The federal deficit under Reagan peaked at 6% of GDP in 1983, falling to 3.2% of GDP in 1987[tpl]cite news |title=The Democratic Fisc |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703995104575389430430274968.html |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=July 25, 2012 |accessdate=March 22, 2011[/tpl] and to 3.1% of GDP in his final budget.[tpl]cite news |title=US Federal Deficit as Percentage of GDP |url=http://www.multpl.com/u-s-federal-deficit-percent/table[/tpl] The inflation-adjusted rate of growth in federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan; however, federal deficit as percent of GDP was up throughout the Reagan presidency from 2.7% at the end of (and throughout) the Carter administration.

According to William A. Niskanen, one of the architects of Reaganomics, "Reagan delivered on each of his four major policy objectives, although not to the extent that he and his supporters had hoped", and notes that the most substantial change was in the tax code, where the top marginal individual income tax rate fell from 70.1% to 28.4%, and there was a "major reversal in the tax treatment of business income", with effect of "reducing the tax bias among types of investment but increasing the average effective tax rate on new investment". Roger Porter, another architect of the program, acknowledges that the program was weakened by the many hands that changed the President's calculus, such as Congress.Niskanen continues: "It is not clear whether this measure bias, increase effective tax rate on new investment was a net improvement in the tax code." President Reagan, has remained popular as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times over the course of his presidency, all in the name of fiscal responsibility.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/19/business/economy/tax-pledge-may-scuttle-deal-to-cut-deficit-economic-memo.html | work=The New York Times | title=Tax Pledge May Scuttle a Deal on Deficit | date=November 18, 2011 | accessdate=January 27, 2012 | first1=Catherine | last1=Rampell[/tpl] Reagan ultimately raised taxes more times than he cut them.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18563_162-7111732.html | work=CBS News | title=Reagan's Tax Increases | date=December 3, 2010 | accessdate=May 27, 2012 | first=Katie | last=Couric | authorlink = Katie Couric[/tpl] According to Paul Krugman, "Over all, the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut; as a share of GDP, the increase was substantially larger than Mr. Clinton's 1993 tax increase." According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, Reagan's tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut. Though since the Reagan tax reductions, top marginal tax rates have remained lower than at any point in US history since 1931, when the top marginal rate was raised from 25% to 63%.

==Results==

===Overview===

Spending during Reagan's two terms (FY 1981–88) averaged 22.4% GDP, well above the 20.6% GDP average from 1971 to 2009. In addition, the public debt rose from 26% GDP in 1980 to 41% GDP by 1988. In dollar terms, the public debt rose from $712 billion in 1980 to $2.052 trillion in 1988, a roughly three-fold increase. The unemployment rate rose from 7% in 1980 to 10.8% in 1982, then declined to 5.4% in 1988. The inflation rate declined from 10% in 1980 to 4% in 1988.
Some economists have stated that Reagan's policies were an important part of bringing about the second longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history.[tpl]cite news |title=Debt, Lies, and Inflation |author=Paul Craig Roberts |url=http://old.nationalreview.com/reagan/roberts200406101413.asp |newspaper=National Review |date=August 31, 1992 |accessdate=February 27, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=Jennifer M. |year=1994 |title=The 1990–1991 Recession: How Bad was the Labor Market? |journal=Monthly Labor Review |volume=117 |issue=6 |pages=3–11 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor: Bureau of Labor Statistics |url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1994/06/art1full.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=6 April 2011 [/tpl] Though other economists argue the longer 1990s expansion begun under George H.W. Bush in 1991 occurred after an increase in tax rates by Congress in November 1990, continuing through the Clinton administration, resulting in a 42% decrease in unemployment.

===Unemployment rates===

The job growth under the Reagan administration was an average of 2.1% per year, with unemployment averaging 7.5%. The unemployment averaged 6.4 percent under President Carter and 7.8 percent under President Ford.The National Unemployment Rate, The Bureau of Labor Statistics, bls.gov
Towards the end of his second term however the unemployment rate dropped to 5.4%.

===Growth rates===

Comparing the recovery from the 1981–82 recession (1983–1990) with the years between 1971 (end of a recession) through 1980 shows that the rate of growth of real GDP per capita averaged 3.05% under Reagan versus 2.14% under Carter.http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/USARGDPC/downloaddata?cid=32267 Following the recession, the unemployment rate had averaged slightly higher (6.75% vs. 6.35%), productivity growth lower (1.38% vs. 1.92%), and private investment as a percentage of GDP slightly less (16.08% vs. 16.86%). Real wages were lower following the recession, while real median family income grew by $4,000 during the Reagan period.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mindcontagion.org/html/real_wages.html |title=What's Happening with Real Wages |publisher=Mind Contagion |accessdate=August 12, 2012[/tpl] But, using U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data, real U.S. GDP in 2009 chained dollars divided by the U.S. population, shows that real per capita GDP went from $26,196.55 in the 4th quarter of 1976 to $28,447.21 4th quarter of 1980, a real increase of 8.6% during President Carter’s four years. President Reagan’s eight years in office saw per capita GDP grow another 23.4% to $35,097.83.[tpl]cite web |url=http://bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=9&step=1#reqid=9&step=3&isuri=1&910=X&911=0&903=6&904=1976&905=1988&906=Q |title=Table 1.1.6.

During the period 1980–1988, the percentage of the total population below the poverty level ranged from a low of 13.0% in 1980 and 1988 to a high of 15.2% in 1983, yet dropped 1.2% during his administration and dropped 3.3% from their high in 1983 to their low in 1988.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/historical/hstpov9.xls |title=Poverty, by Region |publisher=United States Census Bureau |format=Microsoft Excel spreadsheet |accessdate=August 12, 2012[/tpl] During Reagan's first term, critics pointed to homelessness as a visible problem in America's urban centers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/135/reagan.html |title=Reagan's Legacy: Homelessness in America |author=Peter Dreier |year=2004 |publisher=National Housing Institute |accessdate=April 29, 2011[/tpl] In the closing weeks of his presidency, Reagan told The New York Times that the homeless "make it their own choice for staying out there".[tpl]cite news |title=Reagan on Homelessness: Many Choose to Live in the Streets |author=Steven V.

===Federal income tax and payroll tax levels===

During the Reagan administration, federal receipts grew from $618 billion to $991 billion (an increase of 60%); while outlays grew from $746 billion to $1144 billion (an increase of 53%).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/budget.php |title=Federal Budget Receipts and Outlays |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/pdf/4a.pdf |title=Table 4.A1—Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, selected years 1937–2007 (in millions of dollars) |publisher=U.S. Social Security Administration |format=PDF |accessdate=August 12, 2012[/tpl] According to a 1996 report of the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress, during Reagan's two terms, and through 1993, the top 10% of taxpayers paid an increased share of income taxes (not including payroll taxes) to the Federal government, while the lowest 50% of taxpayers paid a reduced share of income tax revenue.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/jec/fiscal/tx-grwth/reagtxct/reagtxct.htm |title=The Reagan Tax Cuts: Lessons for Tax Reform |author=Christopher Frenze |date=April 1996 |work= |publisher=Congress of the United States, Joint Economic Committee |accessdate=March 22, 2011 |archivedate=February 26, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090226201115/http://www.house.gov/jec/fiscal/tx-grwth/reagtxct/reagtxct.htm[/tpl] Personal income tax revenues declined from 9.4% GDP in 1981 to 8.3% GDP in 1989, while payroll tax revenues increased from 6.0% GDP to 6.7% GDP during the same period. This represented a more regressive tax regime, with more revenue derived from the flat payroll tax versus the progressive income tax.

===Tax receipts===

The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 resulted in a reduced tax burden on the economy (~-3% of GDP)[tpl]cite web |author=Thorndike, Joseph J |publisher=Taxhistory.org |title=Historical Perspective: The Reagan Legacy |date= June 14, 2004 |url=http://www.taxhistory.org/thp/readings.nsf/cf7c9c870b600b9585256df80075b9dd/3df8b954567e6c8c85256eb300588d4b?OpenDocument |accessdate=November 28, 2007[/tpl] while other tax bills had neutral or, in the case of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, a (~+1% of GDP) increase in revenue as a share of GDP. It should be however noted that the study did not examine the longer-term impact of Reagan tax policy, including sunset clauses and "the long-run, [tpl]Sic|hide=y|fully|-[/tpl]phased-in effect of the tax bills".[tpl]cite journal|author=Office of Tax Analysis|publisher=United States Department of the Treasury|title=Revenue Effects of Major Tax Bills|date=2003, rev. Sept 2006|url=http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/tax-policy/library/ota81.pdf|id=Working Paper 81, Table 2|accessdate=2007-11-28[/tpl]  The fact that tax receipts as a percentage of GDP fell following the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 shows a decrease in tax burden as share of GDP. Total tax revenue from income tax receipts increased during this time. The economic growth and increase in GDP outpaced the increase in tax receipt revenue, resulting in a slightly reduced tax burden as a percentage of GDP for the economy.

===Fiscal consequences===

The nominal national debt rose from $900 billion to $2.8 trillion during Reagan's tenure, an average national budget deficit per year of $237.5 billion, as compared to an average national budget deficit per year of $56.9 billion during Carter's tenure. The federal deficit as percentage of GDP rose from 2.65% of GDP in 1980, Carter's final budget year, to 3.04% of GDP in 1988, Reagan's final budget year.US Federal Deficit As Percent Of GDP, Fiscal Years 1900 to 2010, Retrieved 2012-08-16

==Analysis==

According to a 1996 study by William A. Niskanen and Stephen Moore,Supply-Side Tax Cuts and the Truth about the Reagan Economic Record, by William A. Niskanen and Stephen Moore on 8 of the 10 key economic variables examined, the American economy performed better during the Reagan years than during the pre- and post-Reagan years. Real median family income grew by $4,000 during the Reagan period after experiencing no growth in the pre-Reagan years; it experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years. Interest rates, inflation, and unemployment fell faster under Reagan than they did immediately before or after his presidency. The only economic variable that was worse in the Reagan period than in both the pre- and post-Reagan years was the savings rate, which fell rapidly in the 1980s. The productivity rate was higher in the pre-Reagan years but lower in the post-Reagan years.
Stephen Moore stated, "No act in the last quarter century had a more profound impact on the U.S. economy of the eighties and nineties than the Reagan tax cut of 1981." He claims that Reagan's tax cuts, combined with an emphasis on federal monetary policy, deregulation, and expansion of free trade created a sustained economic expansion creating America's greatest sustained wave of prosperity ever. He also claims that the American economy grew by more than a third in size, producing a $15 trillion increase in American wealth. Consumer and investor confidence soared. Cutting federal income taxes, cutting the U.S. government spending budget, cutting useless programs, scaling down the government work force, maintaining low interest rates, and keeping a watchful inflation hedge on the monetary supply was Ronald Reagan's formula for a successful economic turnaround.
Milton Friedman stated, "Reaganomics had four simple principles: Lower marginal tax rates, less regulation, restrained government spending, noninflationary monetary policy. Though Reagan did not achieve all of his goals, he made good progress." The Real Free Lunch: Markets and Private Property Further, the Heritage Foundation stated, "the U.S. government must allow the entrepreneur to enjoy the rewards of success. If taxes take away most profit, then the entrepreneur will have less incentive to take a risk. If there are great restrictions on how the entrepreneur can use his profit, then there is little reason for the entrepreneur to take a risk. The entrepreneur's courage to take a risk is what leads to new American discoveries and what drives the U.S. economy forward. Reaganomics knows this. It is one of the reasons why Ronald Reagan has reduced American taxes dramatically."Reaganomics and Conservatism's Future: Two Lectures in China
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and its impact on the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) reduced nominal rates on the wealthy and eliminated tax deductions, while raising tax rates on lower-income individuals.http://taxfoundation.org/article/us-federal-individual-income-tax-rates-history-1913-2011-nominal-and-inflation-adjusted-brackets/Ferrara, Peter (May 5, 2011).Reaganomics Vs.

Economist Paul Krugman argued the economic expansion during the Reagan administration was primarily the result of the business cycle and the monetary policy by Paul Volcker.[tpl]cite news | url=http://people.stern.nyu.edu/nroubini/SUPPLY.HTM | work=Stern School of Business | title=Supply Side Economics: Do Tax Rate Cuts Increase Growth and Revenues and Reduce Budget Deficits ?

The CBO Historical Tables indicate that federal spending during Reagan's two terms (FY 1981–88) averaged 22.4% GDP, well above the 20.6% GDP average from 1971 to 2009. In addition, the public debt rose from 26.1% GDP in 1980 to 41.0% GDP by 1988. In dollar terms, the public debt rose from $712 billion in 1980 to $2,052 billion in 1988, a three-fold increase. Krugman argued in June 2012 that Reagan's policies were consistent with Keynesian stimulus theories, pointing to the significant increase in per capita spending under Reagan.NYT-Paul Krugman-Reagan was a Keynesian-June 2012
William Niskanen noted that during the Reagan years privately held federal debt increased from 22% to 38% of GDP, despite a long peacetime expansion. Second, the savings and loan problem led to an additional debt of about $125 billion. Third, greater enforcement of U.S. trade laws increased the share of U.S. imports subjected to trade restrictions from 12% in 1980 to 23% in 1988.
Economists Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales pointed out that many deregulation efforts had either taken place or had begun before Reagan (note the deregulation of airlines and trucking under Carter, and the beginning of deregulatory reform in railroads, telephones, natural gas, and banking). They stated, "The move toward markets preceded the leader Reagan who is seen as one of their saviors."Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists p. 268. Economists Paul Joskow and Roger Noll made a similar contention.American Economic Policy in the 1980s, ed. Martin Feldstein, NBER 1994, pp. 371–72.
Economist William A. Niskanen, a member of Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers wrote that deregulation had the "lowest priority" of the items on the Reagan agenda given that Reagan "failed to sustain the momentum for deregulation initiated in the 1970s" and that he "added more trade barriers than any administration since Hoover." By contrast, economist Milton Friedman has pointed to the number of pages added to the Federal Register each year as evidence of Reagan's anti-regulation presidency (the Register records the rules and regulations that federal agencies issue per year). The number of pages added to the Register each year declined sharply at the start of the Ronald Reagan presidency breaking a steady and sharp increase since 1960. The increase in the number of pages added per year resumed an upward, though less steep, trend after Reagan left office. In contrast, the number of pages being added each year increased under Ford, Carter, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and others.[tpl]Cite news |last=Friedman |first=Milton |date=June 11, 2004 |title=Freedom's Friend |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3020261.html |accessdate=December 30, 2006[/tpl] The number of pages in Federal Register is however criticized as an extremely crude measure of regulatory activity, because it can be easily manipulated (e.g. font sizes have been changed to keep page count low).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/09/reining-in-the-regulators-how-does-president-bush-measure-up |title=Reining in the Regulators: How Does President Bush Measure Up?|author=James Gattuso|date=September 28, 2004|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=21 August 2011[/tpl] The apparent contradiction between Niskanen's statements and Friedman's data may be resolved by seeing Niskanen as referring to statutory deregulation (laws passed by Congress) and Friedman to administrative deregulation (rules and regulations implemented by federal agencies).
