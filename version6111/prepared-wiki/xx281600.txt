Horace Henry Baxter (January 8, 1818 – February 17, 1884) was a Vermont businessman who served as Adjutant General of Vermont at the start of the American Civil War and President of the New York Central Railroad.

==Early life==

H. Henry Baxter, the son of Judge Henry Baxter, was born in Saxtons River, Vermont on January 8, 1818.  He attended schools in Windham and Windsor Counties and at age 15 he became a clerk in a Boston dry goods commission warehouse.  He worked in Boston for two years and became a supervisor of employees as the warehouse's head bookkeeper.Henry Hall, editor, America's Successful Men of Affairs, 1895, page 65-66
In the mid-1830s Baxter returned to Vermont, after securing the financing to open his own dry goods store in Bellows Falls.  Having extended credit to his customers during the Panic of 1837, Baxter did not receive timely repayment.  He closed the store when he was unable to run it profitably.Atlantic Publishing and Engraving, Memorial: H. Henry Baxter; Born January 18th, 1818, Died February 17, 1884, 1884, page 7

==Business career==

Despite bouts of ill health usually caused by overwork, Baxter was a large man with commanding presence.  Drawing on these traits and his experience managing employees in Boston, in the early 1840s Baxter bid successfully for the contract to grade rail bed and lay track for the Rutland and Burlington Railroad.  Baxter personally supervised his workers, and completed the Rutland and Burlington contract successfully.  His success led to construction work for other railroads, including the Western Vermont and Cleveland and Toledo.  Baxter then settled in Rutland and purchased the Rutland Marble Company.Henry Perry Smith, William S. Rann, editors, History of Rutland County, Vermont, Volume 2, 1886, pages 870-871Marcus Davis Gilman, editor, The Bibliography of Vermont, page 27  Baxter operated Rutland Marble in partnership with his brother John N. Baxter and Charles Clement and Sons, which included Percival W. Clement.  Rutland Marble employed Redfield Proctor as Manager.Vermont Historical Society, The Vermont Marble Company Treasurer’s Records, 2007, page 1
Baxter operated a farm on Creek Road.  Baxter called his farm Maple Grove, and raised cattle, sheep and thoroughbred horses.  Baxter also constructed a mansion at Maple Grove, which he called Grove Hall.  After his death his home was operated as the Crestwood Hotel until it was demolished in 1945.Louise McCoy, Rutland Historical Society Quarterly, Horace Henry Baxter 1818-1884, 1993, pages 37 to 59

==Military career==

Having served as a Captain in a militia unit called the Rutland Light Guards, in 1859 Baxter was appointed Adjutant General of the Vermont Militia, and was succeeded as company commander by William Y. W. Ripley.Lyman Williams Reddington, Centennial Celebration of the Organization of Rutland County, Vt., 1882, pages 26-27  He took steps to prepare the militia in anticipation of the Civil War, and also served as a Delegate to the Peace Conference that attempted to prevent the conflict.Lucius E. Chittenden, A Report of the Debates and Proceedings of the Conference Convention, 1864, page 465Vermont Adjutant General, Annual Report, 1957, page 2Vermont Historical Society, Vermont History, 1970, page 245
After the war started Baxter was responsible for recruiting the 1st Vermont Infantry, a regiment enlisted for three months' service.  Baxter used his own funds to ensure that 1st Vermont soldiers were equipped and paid prior to departing for service in the Washington, D.C. area, and rode at the head of the regiment as it departed Vermont.Memorial: H. Henry Baxter, page 51Leon Fink, Workingmen's Democracy: The Knights of Labor and American Politics, 1983, page 70
In 1861 he relinquished the Adjutant General's position in favor of someone with combat experience, and was succeeded by Peter T. Washburn, who had been the Lieutenant Colonel of the 1st Vermont and its de facto commander.Thomas D. Seymour Bassett, The Growing Edge: Vermont Villages, 1840-1880, 1992, page 137

An associate of Cornelius Vanderbilt, he was a major investor in the New York Central Railroad, serving as President from 1867 to 1869, and a member of the board of directors from 1869 until his death.New York State Engineer and Surveyor, State of New York Annual Report of the State Engineer and Surveyor, 1868, page 338Edward J.
