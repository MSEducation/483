</ref> [tpl]As of|2011|lc=on[/tpl], no widely accepted theory explain their properties. Relative to [[conventional superconductor]]s, such as elemental mercury or lead that are adequately explained by the BCS theory, cuprate superconductors (and other [[unconventional superconductor]]s) remain distinctive. There also has been much debate as to high-temperature superconductivity coexisting with [[magnetism|magnetic ordering]] in YBCO,<ref name = Sann2004>

[/ref] iron-based superconductors, several ruthenocuprates and other exotic superconductors, and the search continues for other families of materials. HTS are Type-II superconductors, which allow magnetic fields to penetrate their interior in quantized units of flux, meaning that much higher magnetic fields are required to suppress superconductivity. The layered structure also gives a directional dependence to the magnetic field response.
