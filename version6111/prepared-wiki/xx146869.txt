==Cover Art==

The cover art was done by Ed Repka, who has done artwork for other metal bands such as Megadeth, Death, Massacre, Nuclear Assault, Merciless Death, etc. The cover is related to the song "Hazardous Mutation", in which people without chemical suits are turned into mutants. The surviving humans are being chased by a mob of mutants in a red dump-truck.
