==History==

The Dvina merchant Kondratiy Kurochkin reached the mouth of the Pyasina in 1610. In 1614, an ostrog was built on the river to collect yasak from the natives. In 1935, before the Dudinka-Norilsk railway had been built, the Pyasina River and Lake Pyasino were used to deliver cargo to the site of the future city of Norilsk.По рельсам истории ("Rolling on the rails of history"), Zapolyarnaya Pravda, No. 109 (28.07.2007)
