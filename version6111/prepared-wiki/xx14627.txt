The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) is a group of states which are not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc. [tpl]As of|2012[/tpl], the movement has 120 members and 17 observer countries."NAM Members & Observers". 16th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, Tehran, 26–31 August 2012. Retrieved 24 August 2012.
The organization was founded in Belgrade in 1961, and was largely conceived by India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru; Burma's first Prime Minister U Nu; Indonesia's first president, Sukarno; Egypt's second president, Gamal Abdel Nasser; Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah; and Yugoslavia's president, Josip Broz Tito. All six leaders were prominent advocates of a middle course for states in the Developing World between the Western and Eastern blocs in the Cold War. The phrase itself was first used to represent the doctrine by Indian diplomat V. K. Krishna Menon in 1953, at the United Nations.[tpl]Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=v2pFvh9crtEC&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=krishna+menon+coined+non+alignment#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = Afghanistan in World Politics: (a Study of Afghan-U.S. Relations) | isbn = 978-8-121-20097-4 | last = Ma'Aroof | first = Mohammad Khalid | date = 1 January 1987[/tpl]
In a speech given during the Havana Declaration of 1979, Fidel Castro said the purpose of the organization is to ensure "the national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of non-aligned countries" in their "struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, and all forms of foreign aggression, occupation, domination, interference or hegemony as well as against great power and bloc politics".Fidel Castro speech to the UN in his position as chairman of the non-aligned countries movement 12 October 1979; "Pakistan & Non-Aligned Movement".

The countries of the Non-Aligned Movement represent nearly two-thirds of the United Nations's members and contain 55% of the world population.  Membership is particularly concentrated in countries considered to be developing or part of the Third World.Grant, Cedric. "Equity in Third World Relations: a third world perspective". International Affairs 71, 3 (1995), 567–587.
Members have at times included the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Argentina, Namibia, Cyprus, and Malta. While many of the Non-Aligned Movement's members were actually quite closely aligned with one or another of the super powers, the movement still maintained cohesion throughout the Cold War. Some members were involved in serious conflicts with other members (e.g., India and Pakistan, Iran and Iraq). The movement fractured from its own internal contradictions when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979. While the Soviet allies supported the invasion, other members of the movement (particularly predominantly Muslim states) condemned it.

==Origins==

The Non-Aligned movement was never established as a formal organization, but became the name to refer to the participants of the Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries first held in 1961.
The term "non-alignment" itself was coined by V.K. Krishna Menon in 1953 remarks at the United Nations. Menon's friend, Animesh Agrawal used the phrase in a 1954 speech in Colombo, Sri Lanka. In his speech in Colombo, Nehru described the five pillars to be used as a guide for Sino-Indian relations, which were first put forth by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. Called Panchsheel (five restraints), these principles would later serve as the basis of the Non-Aligned Movement. The five principles were:
A significant milestone in the development of the Non-Aligned Movement was the 1955 Bandung Conference, a conference of Asian and African states hosted by Indonesian president Sukarno, who gave a significant contribution to promote this movement. Bringing together Sukarno, U Nu, Nasser, Nehru, Tito, Nkrumah and Menon with the likes of Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai, and Norodom Sihanouk, as well as U Thant and a young Indira Gandhi, the conference adopted a "declaration on promotion of world peace and cooperation", which included Nehru's five principles, and a collective pledge to remain neutral in the Cold War. Six years after Bandung, an initiative of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito led to the first Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, which was held in September 1961 in Belgrade.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.namegypt.org/Relevant%20Documents/01st%20Summit%20of%20the%20Non-Aligned%20Movement%20-%20Final%20Document%20(Belgrade_Declaration).pdf|title=Belgrade declaration of non-aligned countries|publisher=Egyptian presidency website|date=6 September 1961|accessdate=23 April 2011|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5y9nJiTzr|archivedate =23 April 2011[/tpl] The term non aligned movement appears first in the fifth conference in 1976, where participating countries are denoted as members of the movement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.namegypt.org/Relevant%20Documents/5th%20Summit%20of%20the%20Non-Aigned%20Movement%20-%20Final%20Document%20(Sr.pdf|title=Fifth conference of heads of state or Government of non-aligned nations|publisher=Egyptian presidency website|date=6 September 1961|accessdate=23 April 2011|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5y9sSWils|archivedate =23 April 2011[/tpl]
At the Lusaka Conference in September 1970, the member nations added as aims of the movement the peaceful resolution of disputes and the abstention from the big power military alliances and pacts. Another added aim was opposition to stationing of military bases in foreign countries.
The founding fathers of the Non-aligned movement were:  Sukarno of Indonesia, Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, Gamal Abdul Nasser of Egypt and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana. Their actions were known as 'The Initiative of Five'.

==Organizational structure and membership==

The movement stems from a desire not to be aligned within a geopolitical/military structure and therefore itself does not have a very strict organizational structure.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nam.gov.za/background/background.htm| publisher =Government of Zaire|title=The Non-Aligned Movement: Background Information|accessdate=23 April 2011|date=21 September 2001[/tpl] Some organizational basics were defined at the 1996 Cartagena Document on  Methodology[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nam.gov.za/background/methodology.htm#METHODOLOGY|date=14–16 May 1996|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=Head of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Countries|publisher=Government of Zaire|title=Meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Methodology of the Movement of the Non-Aligned Countries, Caratagena de Indias, May 14–16, 1996[/tpl] The Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned States is "the highest decision making authority". The chairmanship rotates between countries and changes at every summit of heads of state or government to the country organizing the summit.
Requirements for membership of the Non-Aligned Movement coincide with the key beliefs of the United Nations. The current requirements are that the candidate country has displayed practices in accordance with the ten "Bandung principles" of 1955:

==Policies and ideology==

Secretaries General of the NAM had included such diverse figures as Suharto, an authoritarian anti-communist, and Nelson Mandela, a democratic socialist and famous anti-apartheid activist. Consisting of many governments with vastly different ideologies, the Non-Aligned Movement is unified by its commitment to world peace and security. At the seventh summit held in New Delhi in March 1983, the movement described itself as "history's biggest peace movement".[tpl]Cite book|title=Arms Transfer Limitations and Third World Security  |last=Ohlson |first=Thomas |coauthors= Stockholm International Peace Research Institute |year=1988 | location =Oxford|publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 978-0-198-29124-4 |page=198 [/tpl]  The movement places equal emphasis on disarmament. NAM's commitment to peace pre-dates its formal institutionalisation in 1961. The Brioni meeting between heads of governments of India, Egypt and Yugoslavia in 1956 recognized that there exists a vital link between struggle for peace and endeavours for disarmament.
During the 1970s and early 1980s, the NAM also sponsored campaigns for restructuring commercial relations between developed and developing nations, namely the New International Economic Order (NIEO), and its cultural offspring, the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO). The latter, on its own, sparked a Non-Aligned initiative on cooperation for communications, the Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool, created in 1975 and later converted into the NAM News Network in 2005.
The Non-Aligned Movement espouses policies and practices of cooperation, especially those that are multilateral and provide mutual benefit to all those involved. Many of the members of the Non-Aligned Movement are also members of the United Nations.  Both organisations have a stated policy of peaceful cooperation, yet the successes the NAM has had with multilateral agreements tend to be ignored by the larger, western and developed nation dominated UN.Morphet, Sally.  "Multilateralism and the Non-Aligned Movement: What Is the Global South Doing and Where Is It Going?".  Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations. 10 (2004), pp. 517–537.  African concerns about apartheid were linked with Arab-Asian concerns about Palestine and multilateral  cooperation in these areas has enjoyed moderate success. The Non-Aligned Movement has played a major role in various ideological conflicts throughout its existence, including extreme opposition to apartheid governments and support of guerrilla movements in various locations, including Rhodesia and South Africa. The support for these sorts of movements stems from a belief that every state has the right to base its policies and practices with national interests in mind and not as a result of relations to a particular power bloc.  The Non-Aligned Movement has become a voice of support for issues facing developing nations and it still contains ideals that are legitimate within this context.

==Role after the Cold War==

Since the end of the Cold War and the formal end of colonialism[tpl]clarify|date=October 2011[/tpl], the Non-Aligned Movement has been forced to redefine itself and reinvent its purpose in the current world system. A major question has been whether many of its foundational ideologies, principally national independence, territorial integrity, and the struggle against colonialism and imperialism, can be applied to contemporary issues. The movement has emphasised its principles of multilateralism, equality, and mutual non-aggression in attempting to become a stronger voice for the global South, and an instrument that can be utilised to promote the needs of member nations at the international level and strengthen their political leverage when negotiating with developed nations. In its efforts to advance Southern interests, the movement has stressed the importance of cooperation and unity amongst member states,Putting Differences Aside, Daria Acosta, 18 September 2006. but as in the past, cohesion remains a problem since the size of the organisation and the divergence of agendas and allegiances present the ongoing potential for fragmentation. While agreement on basic principles has been smooth, taking definitive action vis-à-vis particular international issues has been rare, with the movement preferring to assert its criticism or support rather than pass hard-line resolutions.Staff (7 August 2009). "Profile: Non-Aligned Movement". BBC News. Retrieved 24 August 2012. The movement continues to see a role for itself, as in its view, the world's-poorest nations remain exploited and marginalised, no longer by opposing superpowers, but rather in a uni-polar world,XII Summit, Durban, South Africa, 2–3 September 1998: Final Document, no. 10-11. and it is Western hegemony and neo-colonialism that the movement has really re-aligned itself against. It opposes foreign occupation, interference in internal affairs, and aggressive unilateral measures, but it has also shifted to focus on the socio-economic challenges facing member states, especially the inequalities manifested by globalization and the implications of neo-liberal policies. The Non-Aligned Movement has identified economic underdevelopment, poverty, and social injustices as growing threats to peace and security.

==Current activities and positions==

In recent years the organization has criticized certain aspects of US foreign policy. The US invasion of Iraq and the War on Terrorism, its attempts to stifle Iran and North Korea's nuclear plans, and its other actions have been denounced by some members of the Non-Aligned Movement as attempts to run roughshod over the sovereignty of smaller nations; at the most recent summit, Kim Yong-nam, the head of North Korea's parliament, stated that, "The United States is attempting to deprive other countries of even their legitimate right to peaceful nuclear activities."Staff (16 September 2006). "Non-Aligned Nations Slam U.S." CBC News. Retrieved 23 August 2012.
Since 1961, the organization has supported the discussion of the case of Puerto Rico's self-determination before the United Nations. A resolution on the matter was to be proposed on the XV Summit by the Hostosian National Independence Movement.[tpl]update after|2009|date=August 2012[/tpl][tpl]clarify|date=August 2012|reason=attribution in spanish.  at minimum, needs english translation of spanish headline appended to "trans_title" field.[/tpl] [tpl]cite news|author = Transcript | date = 14 July 2009 | url = http://www.cooperativa.cl/prontus_nots/site/artic/20090714/pags/20090714083311.html |title = No Alineados preparan apoyo a la libre determinación de Puerto Rico[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] El texto se presentaría al cierre de la cita del NOAL en Sharm el Sheij | trans_title = | publisher = Radio Cooperativa | language = Spanish | accessdate = 23 August 2012[/tpl]

Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.16-04-2009. See points 237, 238 & 239.
The movement is publicly committed to the tenets of sustainable development and the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, but it believes that the international community has not created conditions conducive to development and has infringed upon the right to sovereign development by each member state. Issues such as globalization, the debt burden, unfair trade practices, the decline in foreign aid, donor conditionality, and the lack of democracy in international financial decision-making are cited as factors inhibiting development.Statement on the implementation of the Right to Development, 7 January 2008.
The movement has been outspoken in its criticism of current UN structures and power dynamics, stating that the organisation has been utilised by powerful states in ways that violate the movement's principles. It has made a number of recommendations that it says would strengthen the representation and power of "non-aligned" states. The proposed UN reforms are also aimed at improving the transparency and democracy of UN decision-making. The UN Security Council is the element it considers the most distorted, undemocratic, and in need of reshaping.XII Summit, Durban, South Africa, 2–3 September 1998: Final Document, no. 55.
The movement has collaborated with other organisations of the developing world[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] primarily the Group of 77[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] forming a number of joint committees and releasing statements and documents representing the shared interests of both groups. This dialogue and cooperation can be taken as an effort to increase the global awareness about the organisation and bolster its political clout.[tpl]Cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Summits==

The conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries, often referred to as Non-Aligned Movement Summit is the main meeting within the movement and are held every few years:XV Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, Sharm El Sheikh, 11–16 July 2009: Previous Summits
Other meetings (such as the Bali meeting of 23–27 May 2011) are held between the official moments.
