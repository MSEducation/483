===L. Ron Hubbard and starting a religion for money===

While the oft-cited rumor that Hubbard made a bar bet with Robert A. Heinlein that he could start a cult is unproven, many witnesses have reported Hubbard making statements in their presence that starting a religion would be a good way to make money. These statements have led many to believe that Hubbard hid his true intentions and was motivated solely by potential financial rewards.
Editor Sam Merwin, for example, recalled a meeting: "I always knew he was exceedingly anxious to hit big money—he used to say he thought the best way to do it would be to start a cult." (December 1946)[tpl]cite book | last = Miller | first = Russell | authorlink = Russell Miller | title = Bare-faced Messiah, The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard | url = http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/bfm/bfmconte.htm | edition = First American | year = 1987 | publisher = Henry Holt & Co | location = New York | isbn = 0-8050-0654-0 | page = 133[/tpl] Writer and publisher Lloyd Arthur Eshbach reported Hubbard saying "I'd like to start a religion. That's where the money is." Writer Theodore Sturgeon reported that Hubbard made a similar statement at the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society. Likewise, writer Sam Moskowitz reported in an affidavit that during an Eastern Science Fiction Association meeting on November 11, 1948, Hubbard had said "You don't get rich writing science fiction. If you want to get rich, you start a religion."Sam Moskowitz affidavit, 14 April 1993 Milton A. Rothman also reported to his son Tony Rothman that he heard Hubbard make exactly that claim at a science fiction convention. In 1998, an A&E documentary titled "Inside Scientology" shows Lyle Stuart reporting that Hubbard stated repeatedly that to make money, "you start a religion."[tpl]cite news | title = Inside Scientology | publisher = A&E Network | date = 1998-12-14 | url = http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5464180198469193501 | accessdate = 2007-01-27 [/tpl]
According to The Visual Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, ed. Brian Ash, Harmony Books, 1977:
The following letter, written by L. Ron Hubbard, was discovered by the FBI during its raid on Scientology headquarters. The letter shows Hubbard turned Scientology into a "religion" for financial reasons:
 
 (1953)
 
 DEAR HELEN 10 APRIL
 RE CLINIC, HAS
The arrangements that have been made seem a good temporary measure. On a longer look, however, something more equitable will
have to be organized. I am not quite sure what we would call the place - probably not a clinic - but I am sure that it ought to be a
company, independent of the HAS [tpl]interp|the Hubbard Association of Scientologists[/tpl] but fed by the HAS. We don't want a clinic. We want one in operation but not in name. Perhaps we could call it a Spiritual Guidance Center. Think up its name, will you. And we could put in nice desks and our boys in neat blue with diplomas on the walls and 1. knock psychotherapy into history and 2. make enough money to shine up my operating scope and 3. keep the HAS solvent. It is a problem of practical business. I await your reaction on the religion angle. In my opinion, we couldn't get worse public opinion than we have had or have less customers with what we've got to sell. A religious charter would be necessary in Pennsylvania or NJ to make it stick. But I sure could make it stick. We're treating the present time beingness, psychotherapy treats the past and the brain. And brother, that's religion, not mental science.
 Best Regards,
  Ron

====Free Zone suppression====

The Church has taken steps to suppress the Free Zone, the term for a variety of groups and individuals who practice Scientology outside the strictures of the Church of Scientology proper, and shut down dissenters when possible. The CoS has used copyright and trademark laws to attack various Free Zone groups.Playing Dirty: The Secret War Against Beliefs, Omar V. Garrison, 1980 Accordingly, the Free Zone avoids the use of officially trademarked Scientology words, including 'Scientology' itself. In 2000, the Religious Technology Center unsuccessfully attempted to gain the Web domain www.scientologie.org from the World Intellectual Property Organization, in a legal action against the Free Zone.
Skeptic Magazine described the Free Zone as: "..a group founded by ex-Scientologists to promote L. Ron Hubbard's ideas independent of the COS of Scientology." A Miami Herald article wrote that ex-Scientologists joined the Free Zone because they felt that Church of Scientology leadership had: "..strayed from Hubbard's original teachings." One Free Zone Scientologist identified as "Safe" was quoted in Salon as saying: "The Church of Scientology does not want its control over its members to be found out by the public and it doesn't want its members to know that they can get scientology outside of the Church of Scientology."

====Litigation as harassment of critics====

In the past many critics of Scientology have claimed that they were harassed by frivolous and vexatious lawsuits.
Paulette Cooper was falsely accused of felony charges as she had been framed by the Church of Scientology's Guardian's Office. Furthermore, her personal life had been intruded upon by Scientologists who had attempted to kill her and/or draw her to suicide in a covert plan known as Operation Freakout that was brought to light after FBI investigations into other matters (See Operation Snow White).[tpl]cite web | first = Charles | last = Stafford | title = Church tried to infiltrate Pinellas police agencies | url = http://www.antisectes.net/sp-times-scientology-special-report-pulitzer-price.pdf#page=13 | work = Scientology: An in-depth profile of a new force in Clearwater | publisher = St. Petersburg Times | date = 1980-01-09 | accessdate = 2008-12-07 [/tpl] Original (PDF), 18M
A prominent example of litigation of its critics is the Church of Scientology's $416 million libel lawsuit s:Church of Scientology v. Behar against Time Warner as a result of their publication of a highly critical magazine article "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" by Richard Behar. A public campaign by the Church of Scientology accordingly ensued in an attempt to defame this Time Magazine publication. (See Church of Scientology's response)

==Personality tests==

In 2008 the 20-year-old daughter of Olav Gunnar Ballo, a Norwegian member of parliament, had taken a personality test organized by Scientologists in Nice, and received very negative feedback from it. A few hours later she committed suicide. French police started an investigation of the Scientology church. In the wake of the Ballo suicide linked to the personality test, the spokesman for the church in Norway called the link at accusation deeply unfair, and pointing out that the daughter had previously suffered eating disorders and psychiatric troubles.
The personality test has been condemned by the psychologist Rudy Myrvang. He called the test a recruitment tool, aimed at breaking down a person so that the Scientologists can build the test-taker back up.Police probe suicide linked to Scientologists Aftenposten, April 16, 2008

==Treatment of Scientologists in Germany==

Based on the 1993 IRS decision granting Scientology tax-exempt status, the U.S. Department of State formally criticized Germany for discriminating against Scientologists and began to note Scientologists' complaints of harassment and discrimination in its annual Human Rights Reports, starting from the 1993 report.[tpl]cite news|first=Douglas|last=Frantz|title=Scientology's Puzzling Journey From Tax Rebel to Tax Exempt|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E7DE1639F93AA35750C0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|work=New York Times|date=1997-03-09|accessdate=2008-10-26 [/tpl] Since then, the U.S. Department of State has repeatedly expressed its concerns over the violation of Scientologists' individual rights posed by "sect filters", whereby potential employees are required to divulge any association with Scientology before they are considered for a job.Lehmann, Hartmut (2004). Koexistenz und Konflikt von Religionen im Vereinten Europa, Wallstein Verlag, ISBN 3-89244-746-2, pp. 68–71 [tpl]de icon[/tpl] / [tpl]en icon[/tpl]Germany, America and Scientology, Washington Post, February 1, 1997Frantz, Douglas (1997-11-08). "U.S. Immigration Court Grants Asylum to German Scientologist", New York Times It has also warned that companies and artists associated with Scientology may be subject to "government-approved discrimination and boycotts" in Germany.[tpl]cite news | first = Ron | last = Tank | coauthors = Reuters | title = U.S. report backs Scientologists in dispute with Germany | url = http://www.cnn.com/US/9701/30/scientologists/index.html | work = | publisher = CNN | date = 1997-01-30 | accessdate = 2007-11-12 [/tpl] Past targets of such boycotts have included Tom Cruise and jazz pianist Chick Corea.
In 1997, an open letter to then-German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, published as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune, drew parallels between the "organized oppression" of Scientologists in Germany and Nazi policies espoused by Germany in the 1930s.[ref]
Schmid, John (1997-01-15). German Party Replies To Scientology Backers, International Herald Tribune[/ref] The letter was signed by Dustin Hoffman, Goldie Hawn, and a number of other Hollywood celebrities and executives.Bonfante, Jordan; van Voorst, Bruce (1997-02-10). "Does Germany Have Something Against These Guys?", Time Commenting on the matter, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of State criticized Germany's treatment of Scientologists and said that Scientologists were indeed discriminated against in Germany, but condemned any comparisons of this treatment to the Nazis' treatment of Jews as extremely inappropriate, an opinion echoed by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights.Staff (1998-04-02). "U.N. Derides Scientologists' Charges About German 'Persecution'", New York Times
German officials sharply rejected the accusations. They said that Germany guarantees the freedom of religion, but characterized Scientology as a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion, and emphasized that precisely because of Germany's Nazi past, Germany took a determined stance against all "radical cults and sects, including right-wing Nazi groups", and not just against Scientology. According to a 1997 Time magazine article, most Germans consider Scientology a subversive organization, with pollsters reporting 70% popular support for banning Scientology in Germany.
In late 1997, the United States granted asylum to a German Scientologist, Antje Victore, who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in her homeland. In 2000, the German Stern magazine published a report asserting that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part of her asylum application—ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a Scientologist—had in fact been written by fellow Scientologists at her request and that of the Office of Special Affairs and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax evasion at the time she applied for asylum.[tpl]cite journal | last = Kent | first = Stephen A. | authorlink = Stephen A.

(2000-07-26). "German visitor takes on Scientology", St. Petersburg Times German expatriate Scientologists resident in Clearwater, in turn, accused Caberta of stoking a "hate campaign" in Germany that had "ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of Scientologists" and maintained that Scientologists had not "exaggerated their plight for political gain in the United States". Mark Rathbun, a top Church of Scientology official, said that although Scientology had not orchestrated the case, "there would have been nothing improper if it had".

==Scientology and Wikipedia==

In an effort to adhere to Wikipedia policy, the Arbitration Committee of the English Wikipedia decided in late-May 2009 to restrict editing from Church of Scientology Internet Protocol addresses, to prevent self-serving edits by editors within CoS-administered networks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/29/wikipedia-bans-scientolog_n_208967.html|last=Shea|first=Danny|title=Wikipedia Bans Scientology From Site|date=2009-05-29|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2009-05-29[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/05/29/wikipedia_bans_scientology/|title=Wikipedia bans Church of Scientology|last=Metz|first=Cade|date=2009-05-29|work=The Register|accessdate=2009-05-29[/tpl]WP:ARBSCI A "host of anti-Scientologist editors" were topic-banned as well. The committee concluded that both sides had "gamed policy" and resorted to "battlefield tactics", with articles on living persons being the "worst casualties".

==Church of Scientology's response to criticism==

Scientology's response to accusations of criminal behavior has been twofold; the church is under attack by an organized conspiracy, and each of the church's critics is hiding a private criminal past. In the first instance, the Church of Scientology has repeatedly stated that it is engaged in an ongoing battle against a massive, worldwide conspiracy whose sole purpose is to "destroy the Scientology religion." Thus, aggressive measures and legal actions are the only way the church has been able to survive in a hostile environment; they sometimes liken themselves to the early Mormons who took up arms and organized militia to defend themselves from persecution.
The church asserts that the core of the organized anti-Scientology movement is the psychiatric profession, in league with deprogrammers and certain government bodies (including elements within the FBI and the government of Germany.[tpl]cite web|url=http://opposing.scientology.org/31-behnd.htm |title=What was Behind Attacks on Scientology in Spain, France, Germany and Italy? |publisher=Opposing.scientology.org |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl]) These conspirators have allegedly attacked Scientology since the earliest days of the church, with the shared goal of creating a docile, mind-controlled population. As an official Scientology website explains:
On the other hand, L. Ron Hubbard has proclaimed that all critics of Scientology are criminals. Hubbard wrote on numerous occasions that all of Scientology's opponents are seeking to hide their own criminal histories, and the proper course of action to stop these attacks is to "expose" the hidden crimes of the attackers. The Church of Scientology does not deny that it vigorously seeks to "expose" its critics and enemies; it maintains that all of its critics have criminal histories, and they encourage hatred and "bigotry" against Scientology. Hubbard's belief that all critics of Scientology are criminals was summarized in a policy letter written in 1967:
Scientology claims that it continues to expand and prosper despite all efforts to prevent it from growing; critics claim that the Church's own statistics contradict its story of continuing growth.Scientology#Membership statistics
The Church of Scientology has published a number of responses to criticism available online.[tpl]cite web|title= Those Who Oppose Scientology|publisher=Church of Scientology|url=http://opposing.scientology.org|accessdate=June 26, 2009[/tpl]
Analyses of Scientology's counter-accusations and actions against its critics are available on a number of websites, including the critical archive Operation Clambake.
