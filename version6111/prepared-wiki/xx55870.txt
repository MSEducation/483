[[Bifrons (demon)]]

CATEGORIES: Goetic demons

In demonology, Bifrons is a demon, Earl of Hell, with sixty legions of demons (Sixty-six according to  other authors) under his command. He teaches sciences and arts, the virtues of the gems and woods, herbs, and changes corpses from their original grave into other places, sometimes putting magick lights on the graves that appear like candles. He first appears as a monster, but then changes his shape into that of a man.
The origin of the name is the Roman god, Janus.
Other spellings: Bifrovs, Bifr√∂us
