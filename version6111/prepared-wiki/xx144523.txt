Royal Oak Intermediate, is an Intermediate school in Auckland, New Zealand.Royal Oak Intermediate Website Established in 1943, it is set in just over 3 hectares of level grounds close to Royal Oak Shopping complex.
The School was originally known as Manukau Intermediate School, so called for the school's proximity to the Manukau Harbour. With the growth of Manukau City in recent years, the Board of Trustees decided in 1997 that it was time to affirm that it was an Auckland school: accordingly it was decided to rename the school to "Royal Oak Intemediate" to better reflect its location.
Between the years of 1912 and 1922, the area now occupied by the school was the site of the "Boyd Zoo": a major local attraction at the time. Prior to the building being finally commissioned as a school, it was used initially as a temporary hospital during World War II. The school celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 1993.
