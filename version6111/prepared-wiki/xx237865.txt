大開色界演唱會 Opening the Sexual Boundaries Concert CD is a live concert album by cantopop singer Prudence Liew, released on May 29, 2008.

==Concert details==

This recording was made during the concert series of the same name held at the Hong Kong Coliseum on April 19, & April 20, 2008.  The concerts marked the first time Liew had a solo concert series at the venue and also her first official concert since she went on hiatus back in 1995.

==Release & format==

Along with the live recordings during the concert, Liew recorded a special track as a thank you to her fans.Universal Music Hong Kong article dated 06/19/08. Retrieved on October 18, 2009  The track is her signature song, "最後一夜 The Last Night", but instead of the original dance track, it was recorded as a ballad with solely a piano accompaniment.  The ballad version was originally sparked as an impromptu encore during the end of the concert on April 20 when Liew announced she had no more songs prepared, but opted to reprise one of her songs.Universal Music Hong Kong article dated 04/21/08. Retrieved on October 18, 2009  Both the live and the studio versions of the ballad are available in this 2-CD set.  The studio ballad version was also released as a radio airplay single to promote the concert album.
Two months after the CD release of the concert, Cinepoly Records released the DVD version of the concert as a 3 DVD set.  The DVD release contained mostly the same tracklist as the CD version, with the noticeable exclusion of Jan Lamb's performance due to his contract with another record company.  Additions include the music videos for four new songs as bonus tracks.  The DVD version also contains karaoke functions with optional karaoke-style subtitles and vocal reduction (as with most concert DVD releases in Hong Kong).
