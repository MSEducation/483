The park remains a popular Tokyo destination. On Sundays, it is especially busy when it is used as a gathering place for Japanese rock music fans. In spring, thousands of people visit the park to enjoy the cherry blossom during hanami. The landscaped park has picnic areas, bike paths, cycle rentals and public sport courts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.courtsoftheworld.com/courts/84:Japan/50:Tokyo/91:Yoyogi-Park |title=Profile of the basketball court at Yoyogi Park[/tpl] courtsoftheworld.com 
Tokyo's failed bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics included a proposal to redevelop Yoyogi Park. A new volleyball arena was to be built west of the Yoyogi National Gymnasium. It would have replaced an existing soccer field and athletic field. The arena would have remained after the Olympics as a multiple use venue.[tpl]cite web |url=http://tokyo-olympics2016.blogspot.com/2009/05/proposed-venues.html |title=Tokyo 2016 Olympics |accessdate=2009-10-30[/tpl] In Tokyo's 2020 Summer Olympics bid, Yoyogi National Gymnasium is the proposed venue for handball events.[tpl]cite web|title=Venue Plan|url=http://tokyo2020.jp/en/plan/venue/index.html|publisher=Tokyo 2020 Bid Committee|accessdate=8 July 2013[/tpl]
