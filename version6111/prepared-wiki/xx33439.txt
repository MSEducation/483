In addition to the obvious difficulties of preserving perishable material, there can be regulations complicating transport by rail, truck, or aircraft of liquid body fluids due to the fluids' possible classification as dangerous goods.[tpl]cite web|title=International Air Transit Association page on DGR (Dangerous Goods Regulations)|url=http://www.iata.org/ps/publications/dgr/Pages/manuals.aspx|accessdate=2011-08-05[/tpl]  Postal or transportation-security authorities might consider blood, spittle, excrement, etc., to be bio-hazardous substances.
