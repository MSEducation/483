The economy of Norway is a developed mixed economy with state-ownership in strategic areas of the economy. Although sensitive to global business cycles, the economy of Norway has shown robust growth since the start of the industrial era.  Shipping has long been a support of Norway's export sector, but much of Norway's economic growth has been fueled by an abundance of natural resources, including petroleum exploration and production, hydroelectric power, and fisheries.  Agriculture and traditional heavy manufacturing have suffered relative decline compared to services and oil-related industries, and the public sector is among the largest in the world as a percentage of the overall gross domestic product. The country has a very high standard of living compared with other European countries, and a strongly integrated welfare system. Norway's modern manufacturing and welfare system rely on a financial reserve produced by exploitation of natural resources, particularly North Sea oil.http://home.bi.no/a0310125/Bjornland_SJPE_1998.pdfhttp://www.offshorecenter.dk/filer/files/Project/Internationalisering/OCD%20report%20(Norway).pdfhttp://www.sv.uio.no/tik/forskning/publikasjoner/tik-artikkelserie/Ryggvik.pdfhttp://books.google.com.tw/books?id=jZIOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA221&lpg=PA221&dq=north+sea+oil+supports+norway+welfare&source=bl&ots=usTy9E4R8J&sig=6cdM3-tZTYAzS-C9vRVaSEQ2jWg&hl=zh-TW&sa=X&ei=YVbdULqbHuiOmQXvo4CIBw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=north%20sea%20oil%20supports%20norway%20welfare&f=false[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570842-oil-makes-norway-different-rest-region-only-up-point-rich | title= The rich cousin |author= |date= 1 February 2013|work= |publisher= The Economist |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]

==History==

===Pre-industrial revolution===

Prior to the industrial revolution, Norway's economy was largely based on agriculture, timber, and fishing. Norwegians typically lived under conditions of considerable scarcity, though famine was rare. Except for certain fertile areas in Hedemarken and Østfold, crops were limited to hardy grains, such as oats, rye, and barley; and livestock to sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, and some poultry; in places this was complemented with hunting. In areas of Central and Northern Norway, the Sami subsisted on the nomadic herding of reindeer. Fishing all around the coast was dangerous work, though fish such as herring, cod, halibut, and other cold-water species were found in abundance. The introduction of the potato to Norway (in the 18th century) provided considerable relief for Norwegians.
All around the coast, the harvesting of fish (including cod, herring, halibut, and other cold water species) was an important supplement to farming and was in many areas in the north and west the primary household subsistence. Fishing was typically supplemented with crop-growing and the raising of livestock on small farms.
The economic conditions in Norway did not lend themselves to the formation of feudal system, though several kings did reward land to loyal subjects who became knights.  Self-owning farmers were—and continue to be—the main unit of work in Norwegian agriculture, but leading up to the 19th century farmers ran out of land available for farming.  Many agricultural families were reduced to poverty as tenant farmers, and served as the impetus for emigration to North America.
