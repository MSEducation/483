The 11th Division (11. Division) was a unit of the Prussian/German Army.From the late 1800s, the Prussian Army was effectively the German Army, as during the period of German unification (1866-1871) the states of the German Empire entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies and only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous. It was formed in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) in November 1816 as a brigade, and became the 11th Division on September 5, 1818.Günter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939. (Biblio Verlag, Osnabrück, 1993), Bd. 1, p.105; Claus von Bredow, bearb., Historische Rang- und Stammliste des deuschen Heeres (1905), pp.420-421  The division was subordinated in peacetime to the VI Army Corps (VI. Armeekorps).Wegner, p. 57.  The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.  The division was recruited primarily in the Province of Silesia, mainly in the region of Lower Silesia.

==Order of battle in the Franco-Prussian War==

During wartime, the 11th Division, like other regular German divisions, was redesignated an infantry division. The organization of the 11th Infantry Division in 1870 at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War was as follows:A. Niemann, Der französische Feldzug 1870-1871 (Verlag des Bibliographischen Instituts, Hildburghausen, 1871), p. 46

==Pre-World War I organization==

German divisions underwent various organizational changes after the Franco-Prussian War.  The organization of the 11th Division in 1914, shortly before the outbreak of World War I, was as follows:Rangliste der Königlich Preußischen Armee (1914), pp. 71-72.

==Order of battle on mobilization==

On mobilization in August 1914 at the beginning of World War I, most divisional cavalry, including brigade headquarters, was withdrawn to form cavalry divisions or split up among divisions as reconnaissance units.  Divisions received engineer companies and other support units from their higher headquarters.  The 11th Division was again renamed the 11th Infantry Division. Its initial wartime organization was as follows:Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle

==Late World War I organization==

Divisions underwent many changes during the war, with regiments moving from division to division, and some being destroyed and rebuilt.  During the war, most divisions became triangular - one infantry brigade with three infantry regiments rather than two infantry brigades of two regiments (a "square division"). An artillery commander replaced the artillery brigade headquarters, the cavalry was further reduced, the engineer contingent was increased, and a divisional signals command was created. The 11th Infantry Division's order of battle in 1918 was as follows:
