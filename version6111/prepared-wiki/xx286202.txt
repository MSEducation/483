==Life==

Maria Belgica was born and raised in Delft. She must have been approximately 27 years old when she moved to Geneva, Switserland with her mother and sisters. Soon after she arrived in Geneva she decided to return to The Hague to negotiate a stipend she was entitled to with her uncle Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange and to request her inheritance from her aunt, Maria of Nassau, the Countess of Hohenlohe. She negotiated a deal with her uncle and soon afterwards she returned to Geneva. Her mother died soon after Maria Belgica returned to her.
Maria Belgica married a colonel baron Croll, who originally came from Heidelberg, Germany but had come to Geneva in the service of the Margrave of Baden-Durlach. The match was deemed unworthy of her, and her husband was seen as an opportunist. Croll was later given the title of Baron of Prangrins. The marriage was not a happy one, and a divorce was first approved and later rescinded by the government of Bern. Croll was however murdered in 1640 in Venice before any further decisions had been made. Maria Belgica passed away in Geneva in 1647. She was buried in the same chapel as her mother.
