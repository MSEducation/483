==Mambo Jambo==

Mambo Jambo, commonly known as Mambo nights, is a theme clubbing night held every Wednesday at Zouk in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. It is highly popular among the younger segment of the clubbing crowd in Singapore, and a Mambo experience is often regarded as an initiation ritual for many beginners into the local clubbing scene.

===Origins and Development as a clubbing institution===

While Zouk Club's vision was to introduce house music into Singapore, the concept of house music was not well-entrenched in the Asian clubbing landscape. Thus in order to make house music more appealing to the Singapore crowd, it introduced a blend of music which incorporated pop hits from the 70s and 80s with house music which were to be played every Wednesday night. Never seen as a long term plan, this retro theme night however became increasingly popular with the clubbing crowd and became one of the main highlights of the Singapore’s clubbing week event list. It eventually became the most well patronised weekday event in the Singapore clubbing scene.

===Music Type===

Mambo Jambo is a spin of the term mumbo jumbo which fittingly described the type of music peculiar to the theme night. It began with a somewhat unorthodox mix of 70s and 80s pop hits and house and over the years, it evolved and incorporated rock, dance and hip hop. A huge hit with the local clubbers, many imitators tried to follow the ‘retro’ theme formula with relatively lesser success. Zouk remained the standard bearer for this unique clubbing experience in Singapore.

===Special Dance Moves===

There are numerous songs that are well received by the clubbing club. However, the most popular are those that will rouse the crowd to making their peculiar dance moves. These moves, usually restricted to hand and upper body movements, are usually expressed in sync with the songs' progression and lyrics. Some of these songs includes Bananarama's Love in the First Degree,  Jason Donovan's Too Many Broken Hearts and Rick Astley's Together forever.
Example: Belinda Carlisle's Summer Rain (taken from Dylan Boey's Mambo Rocks article, published 8 August 4)
Step #1
Chorus: 'Oh my love, it's you...'
Your move: Bring both hands together to form a 'heart' over your left bosom, then use your right hand to point at 'you'.
Step #2
Chorus: 'that I dream of...'
Your move: Bring your right hand up and point to your right temple.
Step #3
Chorus: 'Oh my love, since that day...'
Your move: Bring both hands together to form a 'heart' over your left bosom, then raise your right hand upwards, palm facing up.
Step #4
Chorus: 'somewhere in my heart, I'm always...'
Your move: Bring your hands together and make a heart shape over your left bosom, then clap twice in rhythm with 'always'.
Step #5
Chorus: 'dancing with you in the summer rain...'
Your move: With both hands half-raised and your index finger and thumb pinched together, make little circles as you twirl your hands around for 'dancing'. When the chorus goes 'summer rain', stretch out your hands and make little ripples with your fingers as if simulating a shower of rain.
