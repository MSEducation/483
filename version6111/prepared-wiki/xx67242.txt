==Etymology==

Bacólod ([tpl]lang-en|Bacolod[/tpl]), is derived from bakólod (Old Spelling: bacólod), the Old Hiligaynon or Old Ilonggo (Old Spelling: Ylongo and Ilongo) word for a "hill, mound, rise, hillock, down, any small eminence or elevation",[tpl]cite web | title =VISAYAN-ENGLISH DICTIONARY (KAPULÚNGAN BINISAYÁ-ININGLÍS) | url=http://www.gutenberg.ph/previews/kaufmann/KVED-Body.pdf | accessdate = 2010-06-15[/tpl] since the resettlement was founded on a stony, hilly area, now the barangay of Granada.[tpl]cite web | title =The Official Website of Bacolod City | url=http://www.bacolodcity.gov.ph/bacolod_city.htm | accessdate = 2010-05-03| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100427021151/http://www.bacolodcity.gov.ph/bacolod_city.htm| archivedate= 27 April 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] It was officially called Ciudad de Bacólod (City of Bacolod) when Municipalidad de Bacólod (Municipality of Bacolod) was converted into a city in 1938.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

==History==

===Spanish colonial period===

Historical church accounts provide a glimpse of the early years of Bacolod as a mere small settlement by the riverbank known as Magsung̃ay (English: Magsungay). When the neighboring settlement of Bago was elevated into the status of a small town in 1575,http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-1.html it had several religious dependencies and one of which was the village of Magsung̃ay. The early missionaries placed the village under the care and protection of San Sebastián ([tpl]lang-en|Saint Sebastian[/tpl]) sometime in the middle of the 18th century.  A corregidor ([tpl]lang-en|magistrate[/tpl]) by the name of Luis Fernando de Luna, donated a relic of San Sebastián for the growing mission, and since then, the village came to be known as San Sebastián de Magsung̃ay.[tpl]cite web | title =BACOLOD, The City of Smiles | url=http://www.experiencephilippines.ph/LM/news/id-1207204337611.html | accessdate = 2010-05-03| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100609074822/http://www.experiencephilippines.ph/LM/news/id-1207204337611.html| archivedate= 9 June 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Bacolod was not established as a town until 1755 or 1756, after the inhabitants of the coastal settlement of San Sebastián de Magsung̃ay, were attacked by forces under Datu Bantílan of Sulu on July 14, 1755 and the villagers transferred from the coast to a hilly area called Bacólod. Bernardino de los Santos became the first gobernadorcillo ([tpl]lang-en|municipal judge or governor[/tpl]). The town of Bacolod was constituted as a parroquia ([tpl]lang-en|parish[/tpl]) in 1788 under the secular clergy, but did not have a resident priest until 1802, as the town was served by the priest from Bago, and later Binalbagan. By 1790, slave raids on Bacolod by Moro pirates had ceased.[tpl]cite web | title =Negros, the Island that Sugar Built | url=http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/negros.html | accessdate = 2010-05-03[/tpl]
On 11 February 1802, Fr. Eusebio Laurencio became acting parish priest of Bacolod. In September 1806, Fr. León Pedro was appointed interim parish priest and the following year became the first regular parish priest.[tpl]cite web | title =Bacolod City Tour | url=http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/r6_bacolodtour.html | accessdate = 2010-05-03[/tpl]
In September 1817, Fray ([tpl]lang-en|Friar[/tpl]) Julián Gonzaga from Barcelona was appointed as the parish priest. He encouraged the people to settle once again near the sea. He also encouraged migration to Bacolod and the opening of lands to agriculture and industry.
In 1846, upon the request of Msgr. Romualdo Jimeno, bishop of Cebu and Negros at that time, Gobernador General ([tpl]lang-en|Governor-General[/tpl]) Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa sent to Negros a team of Recollect missionaries headed by Fr. Fernando Cuenca. A decree of 20 June 1848 by Gobernador General Clavería ordered the restructuring of Negros politically and religiously. The following year (1849), Negros Island Gobernadorcillo Manuel Valdevieso y Morquecho transferred the capital of the Province of Negros from Himamaylan to Bacolod and the Augustinian Recollects were asked to assume spiritual administration of Negros, which they did that same year.  Transfer of Bacolod to the Recollects, however, took place only in 1871. Fray Mauricio Ferrero became the first Augustinian Recollect parish priest of Bacolod and successor to the secular priest, Fr. Mariano Ávila. In 1863, a compulsory primary public school system was set up.[tpl]cite web | title =Historical Perspective of the Philippine Educational System  | url=http://www.deped.gov.ph/about_deped/history.asp | accessdate = 2010-07-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100722150827/http://www.deped.gov.ph/about_deped/history.asp| archivedate= 22 July 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Education | url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/53.htm | accessdate = 2010-07-07[/tpl]
In 1889, Bacolod became the capital of Occidental Negros when the Province of Negros was politically divided into the separate provinces of Occidental Negros (Spanish: Negros Occidental) and Oriental Negros (Spanish: Negros Oriental).

===Negros Revolution===

The success of the uprising in Bacolod was attributed to the low morale of the local Spanish detachment, due to its defeat in Panay and Luzon and to the psychological warfare waged by Generals Aniceto Lacson and Juan Araneta. In 1897, a battle in Bacolod was fought at Matab-ang River. A year later, on November 5, 1898, the Negrense Revolucionarios ([tpl]lang-en|Negrense Revolutionary Army[/tpl]), armed with knives, bolos, spears, and rifle-like nipa palm stems, and pieces of sawali or amakan mounted on carts, captured the convento ([tpl]lang-en|convent[/tpl]), presently Palacio Episcopal ([tpl]lang-en|Bishop's Palace[/tpl]), where Coronel ([tpl]lang-en|Colonel[/tpl]) Isidro de Castro y Cisneros, well-armed cazadores ([tpl]lang-en|hunters[/tpl]) and platoons of Guardias Civiles ([tpl]lang-en|Civil Guards[/tpl]), surrendered.

===Cantonal Republic of Negros===

On 7 November 1898, most of the revolutionary army gathered together to establish a provisional junta and to confirm the elections of Aniceto Lacson as president, Juan Araneta as war-delegate, as well as the other officials. For a brief moment, the provinces of Occidental Negros and Oriental Negros were reunited under the cantonal government of the Negrense Revolucionarios, from 6 November 1898 to the end of February 1899, making Bacolod the capital. On March 1899, the American forces led by Colonel James G. Smith occupied Bacolod, the revolutionary capital of República Cantonal de Negros ([tpl]lang-en|Cantonal Republic of Negros[/tpl]).

===American colonial period===

República de Negros became a U.S. territory on April 30, 1901. Negros was once again separated, reverting Bacolod to its status as the capital of Occidental Negros.
The public school of Instituto Rizal ([tpl]lang-en|Rizal Institute[/tpl]) opened its doors to students on 1 July 1902.[tpl]cite web | title =The Negros Occidental High School History |url=http://www.freewebs.com/star96/thenohshistory.htm | accessdate = 2010-06-14[/tpl] Colegio de Nuestra Señora de la Consolación ([tpl]lang-en|College of Our Lady of Consolation[/tpl]), the first private institution in the province of Negros Occidental, was established in Bacolod by the Augustinian sisters on March 11, 1919 and opened in July 1919.[tpl]cite web | title =LCC holds alumni night |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/bacolod/lcc-holds-alumni-night | accessdate = 2010-06-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title =The Early History of La Consolacion College Bacolod |url=http://lccians.ning.com/forum/topics/2287525:Topic:1126 | accessdate = 2010-06-14[/tpl]

===Japanese occupation and Allied liberation===

In World War II, Bacolod City was occupied by the Japanese forces on May 21, 1942. Lieutenant General Kawano "Kono" Takeshi, the Japanese commanding officer of the 77th Infantry Brigade, 102nd Division, seized the homes of Don (honorific/lang-English:Sir) Generoso Villanueva, a prominent sugar planter—whose home (Daku Balay) served as the "seat of power" (occupational headquarters for the Japanese Forces in Negros and all of the Central Visayan region of the Philippines) and being the tallest building in the city served as the watchtower of the city—and the home of his brother-in-law, Don Mariano Ramos, the first appointed Presidente Municipal ([tpl]lang-en|Municipal President[/tpl]) of Bacolod. The home of Don Generoso was lived in by Lt General Takeshi throughout  the duration of the war and also served as his office and the home of Don Mariano was occupied by a Japanese Colonel serving under the command of Lt General Takeshi. The city was liberated by joint Filipino and American forces on May 29, 1945. It took time to rebuild the city after liberation.  However, upon the orders of Lt General Takeshi, both the homes of Don Generoso and Don Mariano were saved from destruction by the retreating Japanese forces.
In March 1945, upon the invasion of the American forces, the withdrawal of the Japanese army into the mountains and the temporary occupation of Bacolod by the US armed forces, the house of Don Generoso was then occupied by Major General Rapp Brush, commander of the 40th Infantry Division, known as the "Sun Burst" Division, for approximately five months. The local Philippine military built and established the general headquarters and camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army which was active from 1942 to 1946. The 7th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was also active from 1944 to 1946 and was stationed in Bacolod City after World War II.

When the country finally gained complete independence from the United States, the city's public markets and slaughterhouses were rebuilt during the administration of former mayor Vicente Remitió from 1947 to 1949. In 1948, a fire razed a portion of the records section of the old city hall that consumed the rear end of the building and with it, numerous priceless documents of the city.[tpl]cite web | title =THE BACOLOD CITY HALL STORY |url=http://www.bacolodcity.gov.ph/cityhallstory.htm | accessdate = 2010-06-14[/tpl] When Batas Pambansa Blg. 51 was approved on December 22, 1979 and came into effect in 1980, the chartered City of Bacolod was converted into a highly urbanized city. The political relations with Negros Occidental were severed and the residents effectively lost their eligibility to vote for provincial officials because of this new status.[tpl]cite web | title =BATAS PAMBANSA BILANG 51 | url=http://www.chanrobles.com/bataspambansa/bataspambansablg51.html | accessdate = 2010-06-16[/tpl] In January 1985, the original hardwood and coral structure of Palacio Episcopal was almost entirely destroyed by a fire. Among the damage of the raging fire were items of significant historical value. The reconstruction of Palacio which took more than two years, was completed in 1990.[tpl]cite web | title =Philippines / West Visayas / Negros / Bacolod City / Attractions |url=http://www.cockatoo.com/philippines/e-15wevi/ep-wev10_g8.htm | accessdate = 2010-06-14[/tpl]
