Freycinet is a national park on the east coast of Tasmania, Australia, 125 km northeast of Hobart. It occupies a large part of the Freycinet Peninsula, named after French navigator Louis de Freycinet, and Schouten Island.
Bordering the national park is the small settlement of Coles Bay, and the largest close town is Swansea.  Freycinet contains part of the rugged Tasmanian coastline and includes the secluded Wineglass Bay, voted by several travel authorities as one of the world's ten best beaches.  Famous features of the park include its red and pink granite formations and a series of jagged granite peaks in a line, called "The Hazards".
Founded in 1916, Freycinet is Tasmania's oldest park, along with Mount Field National Park.
Within the park Federal Hotels owns and operates Freycinet Lodge.
