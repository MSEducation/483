==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars and states "This was the only meeting on records by Adderley and Montgomery and, although not quite a classic encounter, the music swings hard and is quite enjoyable".Yanow, S. Allmusic Review accessed 19 October 2009 The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded the album 3½ stars stating "The Poll Winners session was a typical all-star meeting of the day, and if it seemed artificial at the time, how good it is to be able to hear, nearly 50 years on, Adderley, Montgomery and Brown in the same band. If there's nothing which could be called surprising, the opportunity to hear these players in their prime is a treat".[tpl]cite book|last = Cook|first = Richard|authorlink = Richard Cook (journalist)|coauthors = Brian Morton|title = The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings|origyear = 1992|edition = 8th|series = The Penguin Guide to Jazz|year = 2006|publisher = Penguin|location = London|isbn = 978-0-141-02327-4|pages = 9–10[/tpl]
