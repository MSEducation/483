The Sound of the Golden Hurricane is the school marching band for the University of Tulsa, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  The band is currently under the direction of Mr. Andrew Anderson; overseen by the Director of Instrumental Ensembles, Mr. Richard Wagner.  The percussion section of the band is directed by Mr. George Toumayan, and the band's colorguard is directed by Mr. Joe Martin.  It specializes in a style of music similar to that of drum corps, though the music selection of the group is geared more towards crowd entertainment, and not towards competitive success.
