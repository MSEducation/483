==History==

===Pearson family===

Pearson's Candy Company was founded as a confectionery distribution firm in 1909 by P. Edward Pearson and his brothers, John and Oscar.  Two more brothers, Waldemar and C. Fritz, joined the company several years later.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.pearsonscandy.com/about_us.cfm |title = About Us |author = Pearson's Candy Company |accessdate= 2008-01-01 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The five brothers determined manufacturing would be more profitable than distribution and, in 1912, introduced their first confection, the Nut Goodie.Kimmerle, pp. 138–139
Pearson's grew and began manufacturing for other companies, including Whitmans and Planters.  Pearson's introduced the Salted Nut Roll in 1933, at the height of The Great Depression.  The success of the Salted Nut Roll prompted other manufacturers to mimic the confection.  Pearson's subsequently changed the roll's name to the Choo Choo Bar, to distinguish the product.  The Choo Choo name, however, was not as successful, and the original name was restored with the Pearson's logo more prominently displayed.
By the end of World War II, the Pearson brothers had dropped the distribution aspect of the business.  The youngest brother, William Pearson, joined the family business in 1944, as did George Pearson, son of founder P. Edward Pearson.  In 1951, Pearson's acquired the Trudeau Candy Company, which brought Mint Patties and the Seven Up bar to Pearson's product line.  The company moved to a new manufacturing plant at its current address in 1959.  In 1962, Pearson’s acquired Milwaukee-based Sperry Candy Company, a company known for its Chicken Dinner Bar.  Pearson's, however, sold Sperry Candy to the Schuler Chocolate Factory of Winona, Minnesota five years later.[tpl]cite news |last=Moskowitz |first=Dara |url=http://www.citypages.com/databank/19/942/article6825.asp|title=The Ghost of Candy Bars Past|publisher=City Pages|date=1998-12-23|accessdate=2008-01-01[/tpl]

===Ownership changes===

The Pearson family sold the company in 1968 to ITT/Continental Baking, a New York firm.  ITT/Continental Baking sold the company to an out-of-state confectionery partnership in 1979.  During this time, sales declined due to problems with availability and product changes, such as a wrapper redesign and recipe change of the Nut Goodie.
In 1985, the company was purchased by Larry Hassler and Judith Johnston, the current CEO and COO, respectively.  The company’s previous owners had split up, causing the bank to offer the company in the leveraged buyout.  The Nut Goodie's original wrapper and recipe were restored and, despite the loss of a label contract with General Mills to produce Nature Valley granola bars, which accounted for 1.4 million bars daily and 85 percent of the company's total tonnage, Pearson's became profitable again in December 1992.  In early 1998, Pearson's acquired the Bun Bar trademark from Clark Bar America. Pearson's introduced Flurries in 2004.
In 2011, Pearson's was acquired by Brynwood Partners.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kare11.com/rss/article/935264/14/St-Pauls-Pearsons-Candy-Co-sold-|title=St. Paul's Pearson's Candy Co. sold|date=August 22, 2011|publisher=KARE-11[/tpl]

==Products==

===Current products===

Salted Nut Rolls and Mint Patties account for approximately 80 percent of the company’s sales; Nut Goodie and Bun Bars account for the remainder.  Mint Patties are sold nationally and Salted Nut Rolls are available in approximately 60 percent of the company's outlets.  The Bit-O-Honey brand was acquired from Nestle in 2013. In the Twin Cities, Salted Nut Rolls consistently rank number one or number three in sales.  Although the products are not sold internationally, the company is the 99th largest confectionery company in the world by revenue.
Pearson's utilizes 200 tons of peanuts, 400 tons of sugar, 100 tons of chocolate and 350 tons of corn syrup per month.  Products are produced in the company’s [tpl]convert|130000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl]. plant on three production lines.  Current products include:

===Discontinued products===

====Seven Up Bar====

The Seven Up Bar was a candy bar comprising seven different chocolate "pillows", each filled with a different flavor.  Flavors changed with the availability and popularity of ingredients, which included, among others, brazil nut, buttercream, butterscotch, caramel, cherry, coconut, fudge, mint, nougat and orange.  The high manufacturing costs and trademark issues with a soda manufacturer (The American Bottling Company, today Cadbury Schweppes), caused the bar to be retired in 1979.Lewis, p. 68

====Chicken Dinner Bar====

The Chicken Dinner Bar had been a product of the Sperry Candy Company, which was acquired by Pearson’s in 1962.  The bar, introduced during The Great Depression, was so called in reference to President Herbert Hoover’s promise of “a chicken in every pot”.Hale, p. 55  The bar did not contain chicken or other poultry products, but was, rather, a chocolate-covered nut roll.  Pearson’s discontinued the bar’s production after the acquisition. Early TV commercials sang "Chick - Chick - Chick - Chick - Chicken Dinner" similar to, and in the cadence of a rooster crowing.

====Flurries====

Flurries were chocolate mint fudge with a white coating that were introduced in 2004 and discontinued sometime later.
