==Directions==

Good pair of hiking boots recommended. From the lower city Hamilton travel south on Dundurn Street until you reach the base of the escarpment and reach the bottom of the 326 step metal stairway. Climb the first set of stairs halfway up and get off and turn right and walk west of the stairway along the Bruce Trail. Eventually you have to get off the Bruce Trail to reach the first creek. There is no trail to reach the falls and parts of the route to get there are tricky and dangerous. You will have to get off the Bruce Trail to reach the Creek. Once you reach the creek walk up it 200 metres to reach the waterfalls.
