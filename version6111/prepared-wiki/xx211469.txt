[[Highland Council election, 1995]]

CATEGORIES: Highland Council elections, 1995 in Scotland, Scottish local elections, 1995

The first elections to the Highland Council were held on 6 April 1995; the same day as elections to the 31 other new councils in Scotland. 72 councillors were elected from 72 wards using the plurality system (a.k.a. 'First Past the Post'). Independent councillors retained their status as the majority group, with councillors also being elected representing the Conservative Party, Labour Party, Liberal Democrats, and Scottish National Party. The newly elected council existed in 'shadow' form until it assumed its full powers on 1 April 1996.
