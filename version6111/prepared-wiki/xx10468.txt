[[Historical revisionism (negationism)]]

CATEGORIES: Historical revisionism (negationism), Pseudohistory, Theories of history

Historical revisionism is either the legitimate scholastic re-examination of existing knowledge about a historical event, or the illegitimate distortion of the historical record such that certain events appear in a more or less favorable light. For the former, i.e. the academic pursuit, see historical revisionism."The two leading critical exposés of Holocaust denial in the United States were written by historians Deborah Lipstadt (1993) and Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman (2000). These scholars make a distinction between historical revisionism and denial. Revisionism, in their view, entails a refinement of existing knowledge about an historical event, not a denial of the event itself, that comes through the examination of new empirical evidence or a re-examination or reinterpretation of existing evidence. Legitimate historical revisionism acknowledges a 'certain body of irrefutable evidence' or a 'convergence of evidence' that suggest that an event – like the black plague, American slavery, or the Holocaust – did in fact occur (Lipstadt 1993:21; Shermer & Grobman 200:34). Denial, on the other hand, rejects the entire foundation of historical evidence. ..." Ronald J. Berger. Fathoming the Holocaust: A Social Problems Approach, Aldine Transaction, 2002, ISBN 0-202-30670-4, p. 154. This article deals solely with the latter, the distortion of history, which—if it constitutes the denial of historical crimes—is also sometimes called negationism.[ref]'Negationism' derives from the French Le négationnisme, denoting Holocaust denial.(Kornberg, Jacques. The Future of a Negation: Reflections on the Question of Genocide.(Review) (book review), Shofar, January 2001) It is now also sometimes used for more general political historical revisionism as (PDF) UNESCO against racism world conference 31 August – 7 September 2001 "Given the ignorance with which it is treated, the slave trade comprises one of the most radical forms of historical negationism." 
Pascale Bloch has written in International law: Response to Professor Fronza's The punishment of Negationism (Accessed ProQuest Database, 12 October 2011) that:
[tpl]quote| "Revisionists" are understood as "negationists" in order to differentiate them from "historical revisionists" since their goal is either to prove that the Holocaust did not exist or to introduce confusion regarding the victims and German executioners regardless of historical and scientific methodology and evidence. For those reasons, the term "revisionism" is often considered confusing since it conceals misleading ideologies that purport to avoid disapproval by presenting "revisions" of the past based on pseudo-scientific methods, while really they are a part of negationism.|[/tpl][/ref]Kriss Ravetto (2001).

In attempting to revise the past, illegitimate historical revisionism appeals to the intellect—via techniques illegitimate to historical discourse—to advance a given interpretive historical view, typically involving war crimes or crimes against humanity. The techniques include presenting known forged documents as genuine; inventing ingenious, but implausible, reasons for distrusting genuine documents; attributing his or her own conclusions to books and sources reporting the opposite; manipulating statistical series to support the given point of view; and deliberately mis-translating texts (in languages other than the revisionist's).Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial, by Richard J. Evans, 2001, ISBN 0-465-02153-0. pg. 145. The author is a professor of Modern History, at the University of Cambridge, and was a major expert-witness in the Irving v. Lipstadt trial; the book presents his perspective of the trial, and the expert-witness report, including his research about the Dresden death count. Practical examples of negationism (illegitimate historical revisionism) include Holocaust denial and some Soviet historiography.Klaus Mehnert, Stalin Versus Marx: the Stalinist historical doctrine (Translation of Weltrevolution durch Weltgeschichte) Port Washington NY: Kennikat Press 1972 (1952), on the illegitimate use of history in the 1934–1952 period.Roger D. Markwick, Rewriting history in Soviet Russia : the politics of revisionist historiography, 1956–1974 New York ; Basingstoke : Palgrave, 2001, on legitimate Soviet Historiography particularly in the post 1956 period. Contemporarily, hate groups practice negationism on the Internet. In literature, the effects of historical revisionism are usually described in science fiction novels such as Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984), by George Orwell. Moreover, some countries have criminalised the negationist revision of certain historical events, while other countries mandate negationist views.

==Reasons for revisionism==

Historical revisionism is conducted to influence a target’s ideology and/or politics for a particular purpose. Revisionists understand Plato’s dictum that, "those who tell the stories also hold the power."Gary B. Nash, Forum on who owns history? History in the Classroom. Perspectives. October 1996. Sometimes the purpose is as innocent as wanting to sell more books or attract attention with a startling headline.Matthew d’Ancona, History men battle over Britain's future. The Times, 9 May 1994; ProQuest Database (. Retrieved 12 October 2011). Often, however, that purpose is to achieve a nation’s aims by transferring war guilt, demonizing an enemy, providing an illusion of victory, or preserving friendship.Harold D. Lasswell, Propaganda Technique in World War I. 1927, MIT Press, ISBN 0-262-62018-9 p.xxii-xxvii James M. McPherson, President of the American Historical Association in 2003, wrote that some would want revisionist history understood as, "a consciously falsified or distorted interpretation of the past to serve partisan or ideological purposes in the present."McPherson disagrees with this as the sole definition of revisionist history – he argues rightly that revisionism (academically) is the ‘lifeblood of history.’ James McPherson. Revisionist Historians. Perspectives, 2003. American Historical Association. Broadly understood, there are two motivations behind revisionist history: the ability to control ideological influence and to control political influence.

===Ideological influence===

Historical revisionists ..."seem to have been given a collective task in a nation's cultural development, the full significance of which is emerging only now: to redefine nation’s status in a changing world."Matthew d’Ancona; History men battle over Britain's future. The Times, 9 May 1994; ProQuest Database (. Retrieved 12 October 2011). History is a tool that contributes to the shaping of national identity, cultures, and memories. Through the study of history, individuals are imbued with a particular identity. By revising history, therefore, one has the ability to specifically craft that ideological identity.
Because historians are credited as people who single-mindedly pursue truth, revisionist historians capitalize on the profession’s credibility and present their pseudohistory as true scholarship.[tpl]cite book |first=Harold D. Lasswell |url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Propaganda_technique_in_the_world_war.html?id=e5PtAAAAMAAJ |title=Propaganda Technique in World War I.|year=1927 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-62018-9 | page=51[/tpl] By adding a measure of credibility to their work, their ideas are more readily accepted in the public mind. To an extent, historical revisionism is recognized as ‘truth-seekers’ finding different truths to fit the needed political, social, or ideological context.[tpl]harvnb|Lasswell|1927|page=53[/tpl]

===Political influence===

History provides insight into past political trends and helps predict political implications of the present. Revisionism can be used to cultivate specific politically motivated myths – sometimes with official consent.H.W. Brands, A Revisionist’s Burden, ‘The National Interest.’ Vol.102 Issue 0. July/August 2009. CIAO Database. Retrieved 3 November 2011. https://www.ciaonet.org/journals/ni/v102i0/09.html Self-taught, amateur, or dissident academic historians manipulate and/or misrepresent historical accounts to achieve deliberate political ends. Herodotus, for example, wrote his version of history to gather political support for the Greek system of government over the aggressive Persian despot.Ibid. Also, Communism and Soviet historiography treated reality and the party line as one and the same,Taisia Osipova, "Peasant rebellions: Origin, Scope, Design and Consequences", in Vladimir N. Brovkin (ed.), The Bolsheviks in Russian Society: The Revolution and the Civil Wars, Yale University Press, 1997, ISBN 0-300-06706-2. pp. 154–176. employing historical revisionism to advance a specific political (and ideological) agenda.Roger D. Markwick, Donald J. Raleigh, Rewriting History in Soviet Russia: The Politics of Revisionist Historiography, Palgrave Macmillan, 2001, ISBN 0-333-79209-2, pp. 4–5.

==Revisionist techniques==

Most (if not all) of the techniques used in historical revisionism are used for the purpose of deception and/or denial. The specific techniques of historical revisionism vary from using forged documents as genuine sources (or inventing reasons to distrust genuine documents), to exploiting opinions by taking them out of their historical context.Tennent H. Bagley, Spy Wars¸ Yale University Press, 2007. ISBN 0-300-12198-9, ISBN 978-0-300-12198-8, p.105. Other techniques include manipulating statistical series to support the given point of view, and deliberately mis-translating texts (into other languages)... etc. Instead of submitting their work to the challenges of a peer review, revisionists rewrite history to support an agenda, and often use fallacies to obtain the desired results. Because historical revisionism can be used to deny, deceive, or influence explanations and perceptions, it can be regarded as a technique of propaganda.Nagorski, Andrew. Russia’s New Normal: The Cold War may be over, but that doesn’t mean the threat from the Kremlin has entirely disappeared. Newsweek; World Affairs. 17 March 2008. LexisNexis Database(. Retrieved 12 October 2011)Vol. 151 No 11. ISSN: 0163-7053 Finally, techniques of historical revisionism operate within the intellectual battlespace in order to advance an interpretation or perception of history.Dionne, E.J. Jr. Cold War Scholars Fault Stalin: Soviet Historians Lean to U.S. View. The Washington Post. 26 July 1990. LexisNexis Database (. Retrieved 12 October 2011). First Section, p A3.
British historian Richard J. Evans describes the difference in technique between historians and revisionists thus:

===Deception===

Deception is offensively using falsified information, lying, and obscuring the truth to manipulate information or opinion. Revisionist historians use deception techniques to help achieve their political or ideological goals. Within literature, history distinguishes between books published by academic historians doing peer-reviewed work based on credible sources, and deceptive history books based on uncredible sources.[ref]Falsifier:
The distinction between types of history books rests upon the research techniques used in writing such histories; accuracy and revision are central to historical scholarship. When these techniques are purposefully sidestepped, the presented information may be considered deception.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]

===Denial===

Denial is defensively protecting information from being shared or claiming facts are untrue. Protection can include both physical security, and prevention techniques such as blame shifting, censorship, distraction, and media manipulation. Negationism is the denial of established historical facts – particularly in regards to denying the crimes of World War II and the Holocaust.

===Relativization and trivialization===

Comparing certain historical atrocities to other crimes commonly occurs in the context of historical revisionism, a practice also referred to as relativization. It does not make claims on facts, but moral judgements, in order to alter the public perception of the first atrocity. Although such comparisons may be frequent in revisionist context, their pronouncement is not necessarily part of revisionist intentions on facts, but an opinion on moral judgement.

==Examples==

===Cultural revolution===

====Chinese cultural revolution====

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, commonly known as the Cultural Revolution ([tpl]zh|c=文化大革命|p=Wénhuà Dàgémìng[/tpl]), was a social-political movement that took place in the People's Republic of China from 1966 through 1976. Set into motion by Mao Zedong, then Chairman of the Communist Party of China, its stated goal was to enforce communism in the country by removing capitalist, traditional and cultural elements from Chinese society, and to impose Maoist orthodoxy within the Party. The revolution marked the return of Mao Zedong to a position of power after the failed Great Leap Forward. The movement paralyzed China politically and significantly affected the country economically and socially.
The Revolution was launched in May 1966. Mao alleged that bourgeois elements were infiltrating the government and society at large, aiming to restore capitalism. He insisted that these "revisionists" be removed through violent class struggle. China's youth responded to Mao's appeal by forming Red Guard groups around the country. The movement spread into the military, urban workers, and the Communist Party leadership itself. It resulted in widespread factional struggles in all walks of life. In the top leadership, it led to a mass purge of senior officials who were accused of taking a "capitalist road", most notably Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. During the same period Mao's personality cult grew to immense proportions.
Millions of people were persecuted in the violent factional struggles that ensued across the country, and suffered a wide range of abuses including public humiliation, arbitrary imprisonment, torture, sustained harassment, and seizure of property. A large segment of the population was forcibly displaced, most notably the transfer of urban youth to rural regions during the Down to the Countryside Movement. Historical relics and artifacts were destroyed. Cultural and religious sites were ransacked.

====Chinese book burning====

The Burning of Books and Burying of Scholars ([tpl]zh|t=焚書坑儒|s=焚书坑儒|p=fénshū kēngrú|l=burning of books and burying (alive) of (Confucian) scholars|first=t[/tpl]) is the purported burning of writings and slaughter of scholars during the Qin Dynasty of Ancient China, between the period of 213 and 210 BC.
"Books" at this point probably referred to writings on bamboo strips which were then bound together[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] This contributed to the loss to history of many philosophical theories of proper government (known as "the Hundred Schools of Thought"). The official philosophy of government ("legalism") survived.
The "Burning of books and burying of scholars" was part of what is known as "the Fires of Qin". The Qin emperor died in 210 BC and national chaos ensued. However, despite the lack of a functioning central government to pursue this policy, what happened was further destruction of historical materials: the Qin capital city was sacked and burned in 207 BC, destroying official copies of works which had been retained in the imperial library and official archives, together with the Qin's own approved literary records. Together with the deaths of many scholars in these few years, the "burning of books and burying of scholars" resulted in an incalculable loss to the history of China, and to human knowledge in general.

====Nazi book burning====

The Nazi book burnings were a campaign conducted by the German Student Association of Nazi Germany to ceremonially burn books in Germany and Austria by classical liberal, anarchist, socialist, pacifist, communist, Jewish, and other authors whose writings were viewed as subversive or whose ideologies undermined the National Socialist administration. Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen (Polish: "Specjalna księga Polaków ściganych listem gończym", anglicized "Special Prosecution Book-Poland")HOLOCAUST OF NON-JEWISH POLES DURING WWII– was the proscription list prepared by Germans, before the war, that identified more than 61,000 members of Polish elites: activists, intelligentsia, scholars, actors, former officers, and others, who were to be interned or shot.
In France, in the 1940s, a group of anti-fascist exiles made a Library of Burned Books of all the books that Hitler ordered destroyed. This library contained copies of titles that were burned.  These book burnings from the Nazis was an idea to help cleanse German culture of Jewish and foreign influences, such as pacifism and decadent literature. The Nazis were going to make a "museum" of Judaism once the final solution was complete to house certain books that were "saved" by the Nazis themselves.[tpl]cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books:A Living History|year=2011|publisher=J.Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|pages=200–201[/tpl]

===United States History===

====Confederate revisionism====

Confederate revisionists (AKA "Civil War revisionists") and Neo-Confederates argue that the Confederate States of America was the defender, rather than the instigator, of the American Civil War, and that the Confederacy's motivation was the maintenance of states rights and limited government rather than the preservation and expansion of slavery.[tpl]cite web| title=Confronting Civil War Revisionism: Why the South Went To War | url=http://www.wallbuilders.com/libissuesarticles.asp?id=92 | author=David Barton |work=Wall Builders | date=December 2008 | accessdate=30 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title= Neoconfederate civil war revisionism: Those who commemorate the South's fallen heroes are entitled to do so, but not to deny that slavery was the war's prime cause| url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/dec/26/american-civil-war-usa | author=Barrett Brown |work=TheGuardian.com | date=27 December 2010 | accessdate=30 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news| title=Howard Swint: Confederate revisionism warps U.S. history | url=http://www.charlestondailymail.com/Opinion/Commentary/201106140917 | work=Charleston Daily Mail | date=June 15, 2011 | accessdate=30 December 2013[/tpl]

===War crimes===

====Japanese war crimes====

The post-war minimisation of the war crimes of Japanese imperialism is an example of 'illegitimate' historical revisionism;"Forgiving the culprits: Japanese historical revisionism in a post-cold war context" published in the International Journal of Peace Studies some contemporary Japanese revisionists, such as Yuko Iwanami (granddaughter of General Hideki Tojo),  propose that Japan’s invasion of China, and the Second World War, itself, were justified reactions to racist Western imperialism of the time."Now Tojo is a Hero"The Daily Telegraph. Sydney, Australia. 12 May 1998. LexisNexis Database.. Retrieved 23 November 2011. [tpl]login required[/tpl] On 2 March 2007, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe denied that the military had forced women into sexual slavery during the war, saying, "The fact is, there is no evidence to prove there was coercion". Before he spoke, some Liberal Democratic Party legislators also sought to revise Yohei Kono’s apology to former comfort women in 1993;"No government coercion in war's sex slavery : Abe", Japan Times, 2 March 2007 likewise, there was the controversial negation of the six-week Nanking Massacre in 1937–1938.[tpl]cite news | title=Japan's Revisionist History | work=Los Angeles Times | date=11 April 2005 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/11/opinion/oe-cunningham11 [/tpl]
Tsuneo Watanabe, editor-in-chief of the conservative newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, criticized the Yasukuni Shrine as a bastion of revisionism: "The Yasukuni Shrine runs a museum where they show items in order to encourage and worship militarism.

====Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings====

The Hibakusha ("explosion-affected people") of Hiroshima and Nagasaki seek compensation from their government and criticize it for failing to "accept responsibility for having instigated and then prolonged an aggressive war long after Japan's defeat was apparent, resulting in a heavy toll in Japanese, Asian and American lives."[tpl]cite news | title=Japan's Atomic Bomb Victims Complain that Their Government Still Neglects Them & Refuses to Take Responsibility | publisher=History News Network | date=8 December 2005| url=http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/13654.html[/tpl] Historians Hill and Yukiko have pointed out that attempts to minimize the importance of the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is revisionist history."Remembering the Atomic Bomb" by P.

====Serbian war crimes in the Yugoslav wars====

There have been a number of scholars and political activists who have publicly disagreed with mainstream views of Serbian war crimes in the Yugoslav wars of 1991–1999. Among the points of contention are whether the victims of massacres such as the Račak massacre and Srebrenica massacre were unarmed civilians or armed resistance fighters, whether death and rape tolls were inflated, and whether prison camps such as Sremska Mitrovica camp were sites of mass war crimes.
These scholars are labeled "revisionists" by their opponents. For example, the publication of Diana Johnstone's work has had a controversial reception. In her book, Fools' Crusade: Yugoslavia, Nato, and Western Delusions she questions that genocidal killings occurred in Srebrenica. The book was rejected by publishers in SwedenMarko Attila Hoare "Chomsky's Genocidal Denial", FrontPage magazine, 23 November 2005 prompting an open letter in 2003 defending Johnstone's book (and her right to publish) which was signed by, among others, Noam Chomsky, Arundhati Roy, Tariq Ali and John Pilger: "We regard Diana Johnstone’s Fools’ Crusade as an outstanding work, dissenting from the mainstream view but doing so by an appeal to fact and reason, in a great tradition.""To whom it may concern", hagglundsforlag (Sweden)"Attack of the Zarembites", Ordfront (Sweden), April 2004 On the other hand, Richard Caplan of Reading and Oxford University reviewed the work in  International Affairs, where he described the work as "a revisionist and highly contentious account of western policy and the dissolution of Yugoslavia".Richard Caplan "Fool's crusade: Yugoslavia, NATO and western delusions by Diana Johnstone Pluto Press, London", International Affairs, 79: 2, p.413-474, as reproduced on Political Reviewnet, 18 June 2003 The historian Marko Attila Hoare called it "an extremely poor book, one that is little more than a polemic in defence of the Serb-nationalist record during the wars of the 1990s - and an ill-informed one at that".Marko Attila Hoare "Chomsky's Genocidal Denial", FrontPage magazine, 23 November 2005

====Turkey and the Armenian Genocide====

Turkish laws such as Article 301, that state "a person who publicly insults Turkishness, or the Republic or the Turkish Grand National Assembly of Turkey, shall be punishable by imprisonment", were used to criminally charge the writer Orhan Pamuk with disrespecting Turkey, for saying that "Thirty thousand Kurds, and a million Armenians, were killed in these lands, and nobody, but me, dares to talk about it."Sarah Rainsford Author's trial set to test Turkey BBC 14 December 2005. The controversy occurred as Turkey was first vying for membership in the European Union (EU) where the suppression of dissenters is looked down upon.Madeleine Brand speaks with Hugh Pope Charges Against Turkish Writer Pamuk Dropped NPR 25 January 2005.  Article 301 originally was part of penal-law reforms meant to modernise Turkey to EU standards, as part of negotiating Turkey's membership to the EU.Turkey's new penal code touches raw nerves'' EurActiv 2 June 2005, updated 14 November 2005. In 2006, the charges were dropped due to pressure from the Turkish government.
On 7 February 2006, five journalists were tried for insulting the judicial institutions of the State, and for aiming to prejudice a court case (per Article 288 of the Turkish penal code).Writer Hrant Dink acquitted; trials against other journalists continue IFEX 9 February 2006. The reporters were on trial for criticising the court-ordered closing of a conference in Istanbul regarding the Armenian genocide during the time of the Ottoman Empire. The conference continued elsewhere, transferring locations from a state to a private university. The trial continued until 11 April 2006, when four of the reporters were acquitted. The case against the fifth journalist, Murat Belge, proceeded until 8 June 2006, when he was also acquitted. The purpose of the conference was to critically analyze the official Turkish view of the Armenian Genocide in 1915; a taboo subject in Turkey.Sarah Rainsford Turkey bans 'genocide' conference BBC News 22 September 2005. The trial proved to be a test case between Turkey and the European Union; the EU insisted that Turkey allow increased freedom of expression rights, as a condition to membership.Benjamin Harvey Fight halts Turkish journalists' trial in The Independent 8 February 2006.Associated Press Case Against 4 Turkish Journalists Dropped in The Guardian 11 April 2006.
The Republic of Turkey does not deny the Ottoman Armenian casualties, but denies they were genocide, specifically claiming that said deaths were consequence of war, and also were criminal killings neither approved nor committed by the Ottoman Empire.

===Soviet history===

During the existence of the Russian SFSR (1918–1991) and the Soviet Union (1922–1991), the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) attempted to ideologically and politically control the writing of both academic and popular history. These attempts were most successful in 1934–52 period. According to Mehnert, the Soviets attempt to control academic historiography (the writing of history by academic historians) to promote ideological and ethno-racial imperialism by Russians. During the 1928–56 period, modern and contemporary history was generally composed according to the wishes of the CPSU, not the requirements of accepted historiographic method. According to some authors, such as Mehnert, this practice was fundamentally corrupt.
During and after the rule of Nikita Khrushchev (1956–64), Soviet historiographic practice is more complicated. Although not entirely corrupted, Soviet historiography was characterized by complex competition between Stalinist and anti-Stalinist Marxist historians. To avoid the professional hazard of politicized history, some historians chose pre-modern, medieval history or classical history, where ideological demands were relatively relaxed and conversation with other historians in the field could be fostered;The Historian (journal) Encounters with Soviet Historians in The Historian (journal) November 1957. Vol 20. No 1. P.80-95 nevertheless, despite the potential danger of proscribed ideology corrupting historians’ work, not all of Soviet historiography was corrupt.
Control over party history and the legal status of individual ex-party members played a large role in dictating the ideological diversity and thus the faction in power within the CPSU. The history of the Communist Party was revised to delete references to leaders purged from the party, especially during the rule of Joseph Stalin (1922–53).[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]An example of changing visual history is the Party motivated practice of altering photographs.

In the Historiography of the Cold War, a controversy over negationist historical revisionism exists, where numerous revisionist scholars in the West have been accused of whitewashing the crimes of Stalinism, overlooking the Katyn massacre in Poland and disregarding the validity of the Venona messages with regards to Soviet espionage in the United States.John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr.

===Holocaust denial===

Many Holocaust deniers reject "denier" as an accurate description of their point of view, preferring, instead, the term "Holocaust revisionist";"Holocaust deniers often refer to themselves as 'revisionists', in an attempt to claim legitimacy for their activities". (The nature of Holocaust denial: What is Holocaust denial?, JPR report No. 3, 2000. Retrieved 16 May 2007) nonetheless, scholars prefer "Holocaust denier" to differentiate deniers from legitimate historical revisionists, whose goal is to accurately analyze historical evidence with established methods.[ref]To clarify the terminology of denial vs. "revisionism":
Hence, as retroactive minimisation of the Holocaust, Holocaust deniers have attached themselves to the Heimatvertriebenen (ethnic Germans expelled mainly from the eastern quarter of Germany annexed by Poland and the Soviet Union after the war), and have, per their opponents, attempted to use sympathy for said Germans, and blame the Jews[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] for the suffering of the Heimatvertriebenen. Moreover, when the discredited author David Irving[ref]Further information of how Irving was discredited as a historian:

===In textbooks===

====Japan====

The history textbook controversy centers upon the secondary school history textbook Atarashii Rekishi Kyōkasho ("New History Textbook") said to minimise the nature of Japanese militarism in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), in annexing Korea in 1910, in the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45), and in the Second World War (1939–45). The conservative Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform commissioned the Atarashii Rekishi Kyōkasho textbook with the purpose of traditional national and international view of that Japanese historical period. The Ministry of Education vets all history textbooks, and those that do not mention Japanese war crimes and atrocities are not vetted;[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl] however, the Atarashii Rekishi Kyōkasho de-emphasises aggressive Japanese Imperial wartime behaviour and the matter of Chinese and Korean comfort women.

====Pakistan====

Allegations of historical revisionism have been made regarding Pakistani textbooks in that they are laced with Indophobic and Islamist bias. Pakistan's use of officially published textbooks has been criticized for using schools to more subtlety foster religious extremism, whitewashing Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent and promoting "expansive pan-Islamic imaginings" that "detect the beginnings of Pakistan in the birth of Islam on the Arabian peninsula".Curriculum of hatred, Dawn, 20 May 2009 Since 2001, the Pakistani government has stated that curriculum reforms have been underway by the Ministry of Education.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.itacec.org/document/nep09/NCERT%20Pakistan%20paper%20BRJ.pdf|title=Curriculum Reforms in Pakistan – A Glass Half Full or Half Empty?|last=Jamil|first=Baela Raza|publisher=Idara-e-Taleem-o-Aagahi|accessdate=10 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tufts.edu/~ajalal01/Articles/conjuring.pdf|title=Conjuring Pakistan: History as Official Imagining|last=Jalal|first=Ayesha|work=International Journal of Middle East Studies, 27, (1995), 73–89|accessdate=10 April 2011[/tpl]The threat of Pakistan's revisionist texts, The Guardian, 18 May 2009

====Ex-Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo)====

In the 1990s following a massive western media coverage of the Yugoslav civil war, there was a rise of the publications considering the matter on historical revisionism of the Ex-Yugoslav region. One of the most prominent authors on the field of historical revisionism in the 1990s considering the newly emerged republics is Sir Noel Malcolm and his works Bosnia: A Short History (1994) and Kosovo: A Short History (1998), that have seen a robust debate among historians following their release. For example, following the release of Kosovo: A Short History (1998), the merits of the book were the subject of an extended debate in Foreign Affairs. Critics said that Malcolm's book Kosovo: A Short History (1998) was "marred by his sympathies for its ethnic Albanian separatists, anti-Serbian bias, and illusions about the Balkans".[tpl]sfn|Djilas|1998[/tpl] In late 1999, Thomas Emmert of the history faculty of Gustavus Adolphus College, Minnesota reviewed the book in Journal of Southern Europe and the Balkans Online and while praising aspects of the book also asserted that it was "shaped by the author’s overriding determination to challenge Serbian myths", that Malcolm was "partisan", and also complained that the book made a "transparent attempt to prove that the main Serbian myths are false".[tpl]sfn|Emmert|1999[/tpl]

====Russia====

In May 2009, Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev, established the History Commission of Russia (formally, the Presidential Commission of the Russian Federation to Counter Attempts to Falsify History to the Detriment of Russia's Interests) to counter aggressive attempts to rewrite history to Russian disadvantage, yet Alexander Cherkasov of the Memorial human-rights group, called it a regression to Soviet-era control.[tpl]cite news | title=Medvedev Creates History Commission | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=21 May 2009| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124277297306236553.html | first=Andrew | last=Osborn[/tpl] Historian Isaak Rozental says, "Their Kremlin’s approach is not to study history but to use it."[tpl]cite news | title=Back To the U.S.S.R.;  By pushing a patriotic view of history and the humanities, the Kremlin is reshaping the Russian mind.| work=Newsweek | date=20 August 2007| url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=4PDT-HG00-TX2J-24N2&csi=5774&hl=t&hv=t&hnsd=f&hns=t&hgn=t&oc=00240&perma=true | first=Owen | last=Matthews[/tpl]  The textbook History of Russia and the World in the 20th century (2004), by Nikita Zagladin, replaced the National History: 20th century, by Igor Dolutsky; Zagladin’s textbook was produced under the aegis of President Vladimir Putin, who wanted a more patriotic textbook. Critics of the textbook note the lack of detail about historical events such as the Siege of Leningrad (1941–44), the Gulag forced-labour camps, the Russo–Finnish Winter War (1939–40), the First Chechen War (1994–96), and the Second Chechen War (1999–2000), as serious factual inaccuracies; most egregious, the critics propose, is the absence of the Holocaust (1933–45), and the glorification of the rule of Josef Stalin (1922–53).Critics fear history book overlooks crimes by Maria Danilova of the Associated Press in the Daily Herald 17 August 2004.

===French law recognising colonialism's positive value===

On 23 February 2005, the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) conservative majority at the French National Assembly voted a law compelling history textbooks and teachers to "acknowledge and recognize in particular the positive role of the French presence abroad, especially in North Africa".http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000444898&fastPos=2&fastReqId=1461448112&categorieLien=id&oldAction=rechTexte Criticized by historians and teachers, among them Pierre Vidal-Naquet, who refused to recognise the French Parliament's right to influence the way history is written (despite the French Holocaust denial laws, see Loi Gayssot). That law was also challenged by left-wing parties and the former French colonies; critics argued that the law was tantamount to refusing to acknowledge the racism inherent to French colonialism, and that the law proper is a form of historical revisionism.In retaliation against the law, Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika refused to sign a prepared "friendly treaty" with France. On 26 June 2005, Bouteflika declared that the law "approached mental blindness, negationism and revisionism". In Martinique, Aimé Césaire, author of the Négritude'' literary movement, refused to receive UMP leader Nicolas Sarkozy, the incumbent president of France.[tpl]cite news | title=. | work=Le Nouvel Observateur | date=26 January 2006 | url= http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/politique/20060126.OBS3854/les-principales-prises-de-position.html[/tpl][ref]* [tpl]cite news | title=French Revisionism: Case Of Positive Role Of French Colonisation | work=The Cameroun Post | date=18 December 2005 | url=http://www.postnewsline.com/2005/12/french_revision.html[/tpl]

==Ramifications and Judicature==

Some countries have criminalised historical revisionism of historic events such as the Holocaust. The Council of Europe defines it as the "denial, gross minimisation, approval or justification of genocide or crimes against humanity" (article 6, Additional Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime).

===International law===

Some council-member states proposed an additional protocol to the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention, addressing materials and "acts of racist or xenophobic nature committed through computer networks"; it was negotiated from late 2001 to early 2002, and, on 7 November 2002, the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers adopted the protocol's final textFrequently asked questions and answers Council of Europe Convention on cybercrime by the US Department of Justice titled Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cyber-crime, Concerning the Criminalisation of Acts of a Racist and Xenophobic Nature Committed through Computer Systems, ("Protocol").Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime, concerning the criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems on the Council of Europe web site It opened on 28 January 2003, and became current on 1 March 2006; as of 30 November 2011, 20 States have signed and ratified the Protocol, and 15 others have signed, but not yet ratified it (including Canada and South Africa).APCoc Treaty open for signature by the States that signed the Treaty ETS 185. on the Council of Europe web site

Section 2 of Article 6 allows a Party to the Protocol, at their discretion, only to prosecute the violator if the crime is committed with the intent to incite hatred or discrimination or violence; or to use a reservation, by allowing a Party not to apply Article 6 – either partly or entirely.Explanatory Report on the additional protocol to the convention on cybercrime The Council of Europe's Explanatory Report of the Protocol says that the "European Court of Human Rights has made it clear that the denial or revision of 'clearly established historical facts – such as the Holocaust — . . . would be removed from the protection of Article 10 by Article 17' of the European Convention on Human Rights" (see the Lehideux and Isorni judgement of 23 September 1998);

==In fiction==

In the science fiction novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) by George Orwell, the government of Oceania continually revises historical records to concord with current politics. For example, when Oceania is at war with Eurasia, records indicate that this has always been the case, yet when they are no longer fighting the historical records are changed and the populace are brainwashed to believe that the two nations have always been allies. In the novel, historical revisionism is the principal method of propaganda used by the Ministry of Truth, where the protagonist, Winston Smith, works as a historical revisionist.Sparknotes 1984: Themes, Motifs and SymbolsOrwell, George 1984 New American Library 1 January 1961 ISBN 978-0-451-52493-5
In his novel, Orwell writes, "He who controls the present, controls the past. He who controls the past, controls the future."Orwell, George. 1984, New American Library 1 January 1961 ISBN 978-0-451-52493-5, p.37. This quote illustrates Orwell’s understanding of how the past can influence both ideology and politics, offers a counterpoint as to why protecting the scholarly practice of history is important, and describes the extreme effects of state-sponsored censorship.
