[[PLUR]]

CATEGORIES: Peace, Love, Etiquette, Acronyms

Peace Love Unity Respect, commonly shortened with PLUR, is the credo (see mantra)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/30/national/30seattle.html |title= Seattle's Shattered Rave 'Family'... |publisher=nytimes.com |accessdate=2007-11-27 |date=2006-03-30 |author=Jessica Kowal[/tpl] of the rave movement and Electronic Dance Music culture. Originating from early online discussions about rave culture conducted on usenet its usage has been common since the early 1990s, where it became de rigueur on club flyers and especially on club paraphernalia advertising underground outdoor trance parties.
It may be interpreted as the raver or clubber's essential philosophy of life, at least insomuch as it relates to interpersonal relationships, with basic directions on how people are expected to behave at a rave gathering. This universalist philosophy underpinning the tribal dance culture which began circling the globe with the rise of the internet, theoretically takes precedence over any chemical or musical aspects of the rave scene.[tpl]cite book |title=Rave Culture and Religion |last=St. John |first=Graham |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |page=149 |isbn=0-415-31449-6[/tpl]
Within the Kandi culture, there can be a symbolic handshake that rave-goers exchange with one another. This handshake usually includes the exchange of Kandi bracelets, which are handmade bracelets crafted with pony beads.[tpl]cite web|title=The Raver's Manifesto|url=http://peaceandloveism.com/blog/2009/09/peace-love-unity-and-respect-the-ravers-manifesto/[/tpl]

==Defined==

==Origins==

PLUR dates back to the late 80s and early 90s rave scene in the UK which incorporated House and Acid House music that originated in Chicago during the 80's. The term began as an informal discussion on alt.rave and alt.culture.zippies usenet lists. SF-raves mailing list archived at hyperreal also noted the use of the term and there is a flyer archive which would be worth trawling for evidence of the existence of PLUR. It should be noted that the term is really an aggregation of ideas synonymous with the earlier hippies and also hip hop culture, with the peace movement being an essential starting point to any be-in encounter or rave.
One of the earliest[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] uses of the term outside of usenet and the internet, most anecdotal, appears to be DJ Frankie Bones in June 1993. Supposedly in response to a fight that broke out at one of his epic Storm Raves in New York City, Bones is said to have got on the microphone and yelled: “If you don’t start showing some peace, love, and unity, I’ll break your faces.”[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/djfrankiebones/blog/537031087 |title= PLUR EXPLAINED & DEFINED - DJ Frankie Bones' Blog... |publisher=myspace.com |accessdate=2013-05-30 |date=2011-11-09 |author=DJ Frankie Bones[/tpl]

==Variations==

Later incarnations and variations of PLUR can be seen in the adoption of Pronioa and also Ubuntu, with PLUR and Pronoia often being interchangeable terms, depending upon ones company.
Superstar DJ and produced Diplo has his own version of PLUR which he uses called "PLURNT," which is PLUR and TURNT combined.
