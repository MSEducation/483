==International recognition==

The Republic of Macedonia became a member state of the United Nations on April 8, 1993, eighteen months after its independence from the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is referred within the UN as "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", pending a resolution, to the long-running dispute about the country's name. Unusually, the country's flag was not raised at UN Headquarters when the state joined the UN.Article on Former Yugoslav states It was not until after the country's flag was changed that it was raised at the UN Headquarters. Other international bodies, such as the European Union,[tpl]cite web | author =  European Commission | title = Background information — The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  | url = http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/international/bilateral/background/mk1_en.html | accessdate = 2006-10-01 [/tpl] European Broadcasting Union,[tpl]cite web | author =  European Broadcasting Union | title = Members' Logos | url = http://www.ebu.ch/members/members_logos.php | accessdate = 2006-10-01 [/tpl] and the International Olympic Committee [tpl]cite web | author = International Olympic Committee | title = LIST OF NATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEES PARTICIPATING IN THE XIX OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES IN SALT LAKE CITY | url = http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_258.pdf | accessdate = 2006-10-01 [/tpl] have adopted the same convention.

All UN member states currently recognise Macedonia as a sovereign state, but they are still divided over what to call it. A number of countries recognise the country by its constitutional name – the Republic of Macedonia – rather than the UN reference, notably four of the five permanent UN Security Council members (the UK, the United States,[tpl]cite news |title = US snubs Greece over Macedonia | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3981499.stm | work = | publisher = BBC News Online | pages = | page = | date = 2004-11-04 | accessdate = 2006-10-01 [/tpl] Russia, and the People's Republic of China) and over 130 other UN members.MIA Kosovo is the 127th country that the Republic of Macedonia has established diplomatic ties with under its constitutional name.

===Bulgaria===

Macedonia and Bulgaria have cooperative neighbourly relations. On 15 January 1992 Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia.Republic of Macedonia, bilateral cooperation.  Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Bulgaria, official website, 10 September 2011. Bulgaria has however refused to recognise the existence of a separate Macedonian nation and a separate Macedonian language. It argues that the Macedonians are a subgroup of the Bulgarian nation and that the Macedonian language is a dialect of  Bulgarian. This leads to some complications when signing treaties between these countries—they are signed with this long phrase in the end: "done in the official languages of the two states—Bulgarian language, according to the Constitution of Bulgaria and Macedonian language, according to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia".Agreement of free trade between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Bulgaria, Stability Pact for Southeast Europe, Retrieved on 2012-02-29.

===Greece===

Macedonia and Greece have excellent economic and business relations, with Greece being the largest investor in the country. However, the indeterminate status of the Republic of Macedonia's name arises from a long-running dispute with Greece. The main points of the dispute are:Floudas, Demetrius Andreas; [tpl]cite news |publisher= 24 (1996) Journal of Political and Military Sociology, 285|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_199601/ai_n8752910 | title= A Name for a Conflict or a Conflict for a Name? An Analysis of Greece's Dispute with FYROM", |accessdate=2008-02-11 | year=1996[/tpl]

==Issues==

===Flag issue===

The Republic of Macedonia's first post-independence flag caused a major controversy when it was unveiled. The use of the Vergina Sun on the flag was seen by Greece as territorial claim to the northern Greek region of Macedonia, where the golden larnax containing the symbol was unearthed in 1977 during excavations in Vergina by Greek archaeologist Manolis Andronikos. The Greek viewpoint was summed up in an FAQ circulated on the Internet in the late 1990s:

[/ref] 
The WIPO-protected Greek state symbol was removed from the flag under an agreement reached between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece in September 1995. The Republic agreed to meet a number of Greek demands for changes to its national symbols and constitution, while Greece agreed to establish diplomatic relations with the Republic and end its economic blockade.Floudas, Demetrius Andreas;  [tpl]cite web  |publisher= in: Kourvetaris et al. (eds.), The New Balkans, East European Monographs: Columbia University Press, 2002, p. 85 |url=http://www.intersticeconsulting.com/documents/FYROM.pdf | title= FYROM's Dispute with Greece Revisited[/tpl]

===Constitutional issue===

The Republic of Macedonia's first post-independence constitution, adopted on November 17, 1991 included a number of clauses that Greece interpreted as promoting secessionist sentiment among the Slavophone population of northern Greece, and making irredentist claims on Greek territory. Article 49 of the constitution caused particular concern. It read:
The Greek government interpreted this as a licence for the Republic of Macedonia to interfere in Greek internal affairs. Given long-standing Greek sensitivities over the position of the country's minority groups, the government saw this as being the most serious of the three main issues affecting relations between the two countries; the issue of the republic's symbols, by contrast, was seen as being of much less substantive importance, even though it aroused the loudest political controversy. The Greek prime minister at the time, Constantine Mitsotakis, later commented that
The offending articles were removed under the 1995 agreement between the two sides.
