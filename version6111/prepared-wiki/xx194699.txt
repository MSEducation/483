Grumpy Old Women Live is a stage show based on the BBC television series Grumpy Old Women.

==History==

===Inception===

The idea of a live show of Grumpy Old Women, which had already been successful on the television, came about in Spring 2005 to producer Judith Holder and Grumpy contributor Jenny Eclair, and co-written by the two.  Then cast the show, and rehearsals began for a mini-tour in the Autumn of 2005.  The original production was directed by Chris George, and mini-tour of seven dates set off in November 2005 and was a success.

===National and international tours===

In the Spring of 2006 the original cast, Jenny Éclair, Dillie Keane and Linda Robson set off on a 40 date sell out national tour.  Following this, they went straight into a four week West End run at the Lyric Theatre, Shaftesbury Ave.
For the Autumn tour two brand new members were recruited, Rhona Cameron and Annette Badland.  Together with Jenny Éclair they ventured off on another sell out national tour.  This led to the first international tour to Australia.
A success in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth proved beyond any doubt that the Grumpy Old Woman is a global phenomenon.  As stated in the official website, “from Cardiff to Canberra, women of a certain age could finally unite behind a common fear of graying hairs and sagging rears.  Around the world it was suddenly ok to celebrate the cellulite.  This again made the Grumpies very happy.  We came, we grumbled, we conquered.”
Two years after the first mini-tour, two new members were recruited, Denise Black and Britt Ekland.  Along with Dillie, the three went on nationwide complain-a-thon.
The show toured regional New Zealand in March 2010.  The director is David McPhail.  The stars of the show are Geraldine Brophy, Pinky Agnew, and Lyndee-Jane Rutherford.Christchurch Press

On the 23rd June 2008 the original cast (Jenny Eclair, Dillie Keane and Linda Robson) reunited for one night only at the Richmond Theatre; the performances (a matinee and an evening) were filmed for DVD.Grumpy Old Women | Tour Dates

===Grumpy Old Women Live 2: Chin Up Britain===

It was announced in March 2009 that brand new show Grumpy Old Women Live 2: Chin Up Britain will see Susie Blake (Coronation Street, The Victoria Wood Show) and Wendi Peters (Coronation Street, Bad Girls) star alongside original Grump Jenny Eclair, who is also co-writing with Judith Holder.  The show transferred to the Novello Theatre, London for an 8 week run from 14 April–5 June 2010.

==Reception==

Grumpy Old Women was a commercial and critical hit.  The Times called it a "slickly scripted evening of comedy," The Evening Standard said it was "uplifting than a reinforced Wonderbra," and The Daily Mail noted that "(this) rampaging, rumbustious show is tailor-made for women."GRUMPY OLD WOMEN Tickets.
