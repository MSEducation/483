This list of tallest buildings in Philadelphia ranks skyscrapers in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by height. The tallest building in the city is currently the 57-story Comcast Center, which at 975 feet (297 meters)[tpl]cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=4894|title=Comcast Center|accessdate=2007-08-21|publisher=SkyscraperPage.com[/tpl] is currently the 14th-tallest building in the United States. It was topped out on June 18, 2007, to become the tallest building in the city and the state. The new Comcast Innovation and Technology Center  will surpass this tower by a few hundred feet. (1,121) It will become the tallest building in the country outside of New York and Chicago. It will also become the first building in P.A. to reach over 1,000 feet. Construction is expected to begin sometime in the summer of 2014.[tpl]cite web|url =http://www.lfdriscoll.com/news/article.php?id=121|title=L.F. Driscoll Co. tops out Comcast Center|last=Cynwyd|first=Bala|accessdate=2007-08-22|publisher=L.F. Driscoll[/tpl] Another famous Philadelphia skyscraper is One Liberty Place, the city's 2nd-tallest building and the 17th-tallest in the country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=1libertyplace-philadelphia-pa-usa|title=One Liberty Place|accessdate=2007-08-21|publisher=Emporis.com[/tpl] and was Philly's tallest for 20 years. Six of the ten tallest buildings in Pennsylvania are in Philadelphia, with the remainder being in Pittsburgh.
Philadelphia's history of tall buildings is generally thought to begin with the 1754 addition of the steeple to Christ Church, which was one of America's first high-rise structures.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emporis.info/en/wm/bu/?id=christchurch-philadelphia-pa-usa|title=Christ Church|accessdate=2007-08-17|publisher=Emporis.com[/tpl] Through most of the 20th century, a "gentlemen's agreement" prevented buildings from rising higher than the 548-ft (167-m) Philadelphia City Hall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://phillyskyline.com/bldgs/cityhall/index.htm|title=City Hall|accessdate=2007-08-21|publisher=PhillySkyline.com[/tpl] Despite this, Philadelphia amassed a large collection of high-rise buildings. The completion of One Liberty Place in 1987 broke the agreement, and Philadelphia has since seen the construction of eight skyscrapers that eclipse City Hall in height.
Philadelphia has twice held the tallest habitable building in North America, first with Christ Church, then with City Hall. The latter reigned as the world's tallest building from 1901 to 1908,[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.galenfrysinger.com/philadelphia_city_hall.htm|title=City Hall|accessdate=2007-08-21|publisher=GalenFrysinger.com[/tpl] and is currently the world's second-tallest masonry building, only [tpl]convert|1.6|ft|m[/tpl] shorter[tpl]cite web |url = http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=178 |title= Philadelphia City Hall, Philadelphia |accessdate=2010-01-07 |last= |first= |coauthors= |work= |publisher= SkyscraperPage.com[/tpl] than Mole Antonelliana in Turin.[tpl]cite web |url = http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=19834 |title= Mole Antonelliana, Turin |accessdate=2010-01-07 |last= |first= |coauthors= |work= |publisher= SkyscraperPage.com[/tpl] Like other large American cities, Philadelphia went through a massive building boom in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in the completion of over 20 high-rise buildings. The city is the site of 15 skyscrapers at least  [tpl]convert|492|ft|m|0[/tpl] tall. Philadelphia now is one of only four American cities with two or more buildings over [tpl]convert|900|ft|m[/tpl] tall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?searchID=62605179|title=Diagram of Tallest Buildings in the United States|accessdate=2014-01-17|publisher=SkyscraperPage.com[/tpl]

==Timeline of tallest buildings==

Philadelphia has seen few city record-holders compared to other cities with comparable skylines. Although churches, cathedrals, and the like are not technically considered to be skyscrapers, Christ Church, after being surmounted with its lofty spire in 1754, stood as its tallest building for 102 years before being surpassed by the (no longer extant) spire of Tenth Presbyterian Church, which was only surpassed by the North American Building in 1900. Then, due to the "gentlemen's agreement" not to build higher than the top of the statue of William Penn atop City Hall, that building stood as the city's tallest structure for 86 years; it also held the world record for tallest habitable building from 1901 until the 1908 completion of the Singer Building in New York City.
