==The Wild Men of Paris==

Leading up to 1910 Gelett Burgess interviewed and wrote about avant-garde artists and artworks in and around Paris. The result of Burgess' investigation, The Wild Men of Paris,  was published in the May 1910 issue of Architectural Record; after his visit to the 1910 Salon des Indépendants, the anti-establishment art exhibition in Paris one year before the scandalous group exhibition that brought Cubism to the attention of the general public. An important painting by Pablo Picasso, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, was reproduced in this article; one of the first mentions of the founders of Cubism, Pablo Picasso , Georges Braque and Jean Metzinger to appear in the American press. Other important works were reproduced by Henri Matisse, Auguste Herbin and André Derain.[tpl]cite journal | last = Burgess | first = Gelett | authorlink = Gelett Burgess | title = The Wild Men of Paris | journal = Architectural Record | date = May 1910 | url = http://archrecord.construction.com/inthecause/0702MenOfParis/MenOfParis1.asp[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Sawicki | first = Nicholas | title = Inheriting Cubism: The Impact of Cubism on American Art, 1909-1938 | url = http://web.gc.cuny.edu/ArtHistory/part/part9/modernism/reviews/sawic.html | accessdate = 2007-02-27[/tpl]
