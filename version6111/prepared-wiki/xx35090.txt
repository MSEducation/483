Uno is a small unincorporated community in Hart County, Kentucky, United States, located east and slightly north of Horse Cave on U.S. Route 31E.  Its name is pronounced as "You know."  This is in reference to the historical practice of the selling of moonshine whiskey during prohibition.  Another name for this community is Clearpoint, Kentucky, which is derived from "Clear Pint", again in reference to its historical past as a location at which to buy moonshine.  The Clearpoint Presbyterian Church, located here, retains the old name.
The most famous business here for many years was the first Smith's Country Store, where country hams were sold. The second store in the chain was opened in Cave City, Kentucky, in nearby Barren County.
