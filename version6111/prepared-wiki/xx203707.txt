Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a 2010 comedy film co-written, produced and directed by Edgar Wright, based on the graphic novel series Scott Pilgrim by Bryan Lee O'Malley. The film is about a young Canadian musician named Scott Pilgrim meeting the girl of his dreams, an American delivery girl named Ramona Flowers. In order to win Ramona, Scott learns that he must defeat Ramona's "seven evil exes", who are coming to kill him.
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World was planned as a film after the first volume of the comic was released. Wright became attached to the project and filming began in March 2009 in Toronto. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World premiered after a panel discussion at the San Diego Comic-Con International on July 22, 2010. It received a wide release in North America on August 13, 2010, in 2,818 theaters.[tpl]cite web | title = Scott Pilgrim vs. the World | url= http://www.scottpilgrimthemovie.com/ | accessdate =August 21, 2010[/tpl] The film finished fifth on its first weekend of release with a total of $10.5 million.[tpl]mojo title|scottpilgrim[/tpl][tpl]Cite news | date = August 15, 2010 | title = 'The Expendables' Tops Weekend Box Office | url = http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/08/15/the-expendables-tops-weekend-box-office/ | newspaper = The Wall Street Journal | accessdate =August 18, 2010[/tpl] The film received generally positive reviews by critics and fans of the graphic novel, but it failed to recoup its production budget during its release in theaters, grossing $31.5 million in North America and $16 million internationally.Szklarski, Cassandra.

==Plot==

In Toronto, 22-year-old Scott Pilgrim, the bass guitarist for the band "Sex Bob-omb", begins dating high schooler Knives Chau, much to the disapproval of his friends. Soon, Scott meets an American girl, Ramona Flowers. Ramona begins appearing in Scott's dreams, and he becomes obsessed with Ramona, losing interest in Knives. While playing in a battle of the bands sponsored by one "G-Man Graves" for a record deal, Scott is attacked by Matthew Patel, who introduces himself as the first of Ramona's "evil exes". Scott defeats Patel and learns that, in order for them to date, he must defeat all seven of her evil exes.
Scott breaks up with Knives, who blames Ramona for taking Scott from her and begins trying to win him back. Scott battles Ramona's second evil ex, popular actor and skateboarder Lucas Lee, whom he defeats by tricking him into performing a dangerous skateboard grind that causes him to combust. Scott later encounters the third evil ex, Todd Ingram, who is dating Scott's ex-girlfriend, Natalie "Envy" Adams. Todd initially overpowers Scott using his psychic vegan abilities, but is stripped of his powers by the Vegan Police after Scott tricks him into drinking coffee with half and half cream, allowing Scott to defeat him.
Scott begins to grow upset with Ramona over her dating history by the defeat of the fourth ex, Roxy Richter. During the second round of the battle of the bands, Sex Bob-omb faces off against the fifth and sixth evil exes, twin Katayanagi brothers Kyle and Ken, earning Scott an extra life upon their defeat. During the battle, Scott sees Ramona together with her seventh evil ex, Gideon, who turns out to be G-Man Graves. The members of Sex Bob-omb accept Gideon's record deal, except for Scott, who leaves the band.
Upon returning home, Scott receives a phone call invitation from Gideon to his newly opened Chaos Theater where Sex Bob-omb is playing, claiming there to be "no hard feelings". Scott arrives and challenges Gideon to a fight, professing his love for Ramona and gaining a sword called the "Power of Love", which Gideon easily destroys. Knives then crashes the scene to fight Ramona over Scott. Scott goes to break up the girls' fight, only to accidentally reveal that he cheated on them with each other before he is killed by Gideon.
Ramona visits Scott in Limbo and apologizes for getting him involved in her affairs, revealing that Gideon had planted a mind control device in the back of her head. Scott realizes he still has an extra life and uses it to return to life at the moment in time when Gideon first called him. Scott reenters the Chaos Theater where he makes peace with his friends and challenges Gideon again, stating he is fighting for himself and gaining the much stronger "Power of Self-Respect" sword with which he strikes down Gideon. He then apologizes to Ramona and Knives for cheating on them, but Gideon interferes and knocks down Ramona, leading Scott and Knives to team up and defeat him. Free from Gideon's control, Ramona prepares to leave, but Knives accepts that her relationship with Scott is over and encourages him to follow Ramona. He does, and the two start their relationship anew.

===Differences from source material===

In order to condense the six novels into a single two-hour film, several major changes and cuts were made to the plot under the supervision of author Bryan Lee O'Malley.

==Cast==

Thomas Jane and Clifton Collins, Jr. appear uncredited as the Vegan Policemen. The author, Bryan Lee O'Malley, and his wife, Hope Larson, also appear uncredited as Lee's Palace bar patrons. Reuben Langdon (known for being the voices of Ken in Street Fighter IV and Dante in the Devil May Cry series) has a cameo as one of Lucas Lee's stunt doubles. Bill Hader provides the video-game inspired voice-over.

==Production==

===Development===

After artist Bryan Lee O'Malley completed the first volume of Scott Pilgrim, his publisher Oni Press contacted producer Marc Platt with the proposition for a film version.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/q-a-scott-pilgrim-creator-bryan-lee-o-malley/page:3|work=Total Film|title=Q&A: Scott Pilgrim creator Bryan Lee O'Malley| date=June 2, 2010|accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl] Universal Studios contracted Edgar Wright who had just finished his last film, Shaun of the Dead, to adapt the Scott Pilgrim comics. O'Malley originally had mixed feelings about a film adaptation, stating that he "expected them to turn it into a full-on action comedy with some actor that I hated" ultimately "didn't even care. I was a starving artist, and I was like, 'Please, just give me some money.'"[tpl]cite news | date= July 15, 2010 | last= Martens | first= Todd | title= Hero Complex for your Inner Fanboy | url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/07/comiccon-2010-scott-pilgrim-is-ready-to-put-up-a-fight.html | work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=July 16, 2010[/tpl]

Edgar Wright noted that O'Malley was "very involved" with the script of the film from the start, and even contributed lines to and "polished" certain scenes in the film. Likewise, due to the long development process, several lines from the various scripts written by Wright and Bacall ended up in books four and five as well.[tpl]cite web | date = August 16, 2010 | author = Dan | title = Geekadelphia: An EPIC Conversation with Edgar Wright & Michael Cera of Scott Pilgrim Vs.

O'Malley confirmed that no material from Scott Pilgrim's Finest Hour, the sixth Scott Pilgrim volume, would appear in the film, as production had already begun. While he had given ideas and suggestions for the final act of the film, he admitted to that some of those plans might change throughout the writing process and ultimately stated that "Their ending is their ending".[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/05/22/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-will-end-differently-than-the-graphic-novels/ |title= Scott Pilgrim vs. The World Will End Differently Than The Graphic Novels|first=Peter | last= Sciretta |accessdate=January 13, 2010[/tpl] O'Malley gave Wright and Bacall his notes for the sixth book while filming took place.

====Setting====

One of the producers, Miles Dale, said that the film is "the biggest movie ever identifiably set in Toronto."Schneller, Johanna. "Hollywood goes Toronto." The Globe and Mail. Saturday May 23, 2009. Updated Thursday August 23, 2012. Retrieved on December 7, 2012. "Nobody's switching mailboxes or changing the identity of St. Mike's school,..." which refers to St. Michael's Collegiate School The film features Casa Loma, St. Michael's College School, Sonic Boom, the Toronto Public Library Wychwood Library, a Goodwill location on St. Clair West, a Second Cup, and a Pizza Pizza. The developers planned to set the series in Toronto because, in Dale's words, "the books are super-specific in their local details" and director Edgar Wright wanted to use the imagery from the books, so Universal Studios had no plans to alter the setting. Dale stated that "Bathurst Street is practically the cerebral cortex of Scott Pilgrim".

===Casting===

Director Wright felt confident with his casting in the film. Wright stated that "Like with Hot Fuzz how we had great people in every single tiny part, it's the same with this. What's great with this is that there's people you know, like with Michael Cera and Jason Schwartzman, and then we have people who are up and coming, like Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza and Brie Larson, and then there's complete unknowns as well". There was no studio interference with casting more unknowns, as Wright stated that "Universal never really gave me any problems about casting bigger people, because in a way Michael Cera has starred in two $100 million-plus movies, and also a lot of the other people, though they're not the biggest names, people certainly know who they are."[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.collider.com/2010/05/25/scott-pilgrim-vs-world-interview-edgar-wright-michael-cera-jason-schwartzman/|work=Collider|title=Edgar Wright, Michael Cera, Jason Schwartzman Interview Scott Pilgrim vs. the World|date=May 25, 2010|accessdate=June 1, 2010[/tpl] Wright planned on casting Cera while writing Hot Fuzz after watching episodes of Arrested Development. Wright said he needed an actor that "audiences will still follow even when the character is being a bit of an ass." Edgar Wright ran all his casting decisions by O'Malley during the casting session.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/q-a-scott-pilgrim-creator-bryan-lee-o-malley/page:4|work=Total Film|title=Q&A: Scott Pilgrim creator Bryan Lee O'Malley|date=June 2, 2010|accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl] Mary Elizabeth Winstead was Wright's choice for Ramona Flowers two years before filming had started, because "she has a very sunny disposition as a person, so it was interesting to get her to play a version of herself that was broken inside. She's great in the film because she causes a lot of chaos but remains supernaturally grounded." Ellen Wong, a Toronto actress known mostly from a role in This Is Wonderland, auditioned for the part of Knives Chau three times. On her second audition, Wright learned that Wong has a green belt in tae kwon do, and says he found himself intrigued by this "sweet-faced young lady being a secret badass".

Edgar has created a truly unique film that is both envelope pushing and genre bending and when examined down the road will be identified as an important piece of filmmaking."
In the UK, the film opened in 408 cinemas, finishing second on its opening weekend with £1.6 million,[tpl]cite web|title=UK Box Office 27–29 August 2010|url=http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/article/16967/UK-Box-Office-27---29-August-2010|publisher=UK Film Council[/tpl] dropping to fifth place by the next weekend.

Metacritic has assigned an average score of 69, based on 38 reviews, which indicates generally favorable reviews.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world | title=Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010): Reviews | work=Metacritic | publisher= CBS Interactive | accessdate=August 29, 2010 [/tpl]
At a test screening, director Kevin Smith was impressed by the film saying "That movie is great. It's spellbinding and nobody is going to understand what the fuck just hit them. I would be hard pressed to say, 'he's bringing a comic book to life!' but he is bringing a comic book to life." Smith also said that fellow directors Quentin Tarantino and Jason Reitman were "really into it".[tpl]cite web| date = March 3, 2010 | url = http://thefilmstage.com/2010/03/03/exclusive-kevin-smith-talks-scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world/ | title = Kevin Smith Talks Scott Pilgrim | work = The Film Stage | accessdate =June 3, 2010 [/tpl] Singer for the band Sister and writer for Now, Carla Gillis, also commented on the film.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.nationalpost.com/arts/Scott+Pilgrim+marches+beat+Plumtree+Metric/3387032/story.html |title=Scott Pilgrim marches to the beat of a Plumtree (oh, and Metric, too) |last=Kaplan |first=Ben |date=August 11, 2010|work= National Post |location=Canada |accessdate=December 3, 2010[/tpl] Gillis was the singer of the now-disbanded Canadian group Plumtree, and their single "Scott Pilgrim" that inspired O'Malley to create the character and the series. In an interview describing the film and the song that inspired it, Gillis felt the film carried the same positive yet bittersweet tone of the song.
After premiere screenings at the San Diego Comic-Con International, the film received positive reviews. Variety gave the film a mixed review, referring to the film as "an example of attention-deficit filmmaking at both its finest and its most frustrating" and that "anyone over 25 is likely to find director Edgar Wright's adaptation of the cult graphic novel exhausting, like playing chaperone at a party full of oversexed college kids."[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117943219.html |work=Variety  |title= Scott Pilgrim vs. the World |last= Debruge |first = Peter |accessdate=July 23, 2010 |date= July 23, 2010[/tpl]
The Hollywood Reporter wrote a negative review, stating that "What's disappointing is that this is all so juvenile. Nothing makes any real sense...Michael Cera doesn't give a performance that anchors the nonsense." and "Universal should have a youth hit in the domestic market when the film opens next month. A wider audience among older or international viewers seems unlikely."[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/scott-pilgrim-vs-world-film-29836 |title= Scott Pilgrim vs. the World – Film Review|last=Honeycutt| first = Kirk|accessdate=July 23, 2010|date=July 23, 2010 | work = The Hollywood Reporter| quote = What's disappointing is that this is all so juvenile. Nothing makes any real sense. The "duels" change their rules on a whim, and no one takes the games very seriously, including the exes, who, when defeated, explode into coins the winner may collect. Certainly Cera doesn't give a performance that anchors the nonsense. His character sort of drifts, not really attached to any idea or goal other than winning the heart of an apparently heartless woman while dissing a girlfriend who, despite her "youth," seems ideally suited to his slacker personality.[/tpl]
David Edelstein of New York magazine wrote that "The film is repetitive, top-heavy: Wright blows his wad too early. But a different lead might have kept you laughing and engaged. Cera doesn't come alive in the fight scenes the way Stephen Chow does in the best (and most Tashlin-like) of all the surreal martial-arts comedies, Kung Fu Hustle."[tpl]cite web|url= http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/67400/|title= A Not So Super Hero|work=New York|last=Edelstein |first = David|authorlink= David Edelstein | date=August 1, 2010|accessdate= 2010-08-03[/tpl]
Cindy White at IGN gave the film a positive rating of 8/10 calling the film "funny and offbeat" as well as noting that the film is "best suited for the wired generation and those of us who grew up on Nintendo and MTV.

Nick Schager of Slant Magazine gave the film a positive review of three and a half stars out of four, calling Edgar Wright an "inspired mash-up artist, and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World may be his finest hybridization to date".[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world/4927 |work=Slant Magazine|title=Scott Pilgrim vs. the World |last=Schager |first =Nick|date= August 1, 2010|accessdate=August 3, 2010[/tpl] A. O. Scott made the film a "critics pick", stating "There are some movies about youth that just make you feel old, even if you aren't...Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has the opposite effect. Its speedy, funny, happy-sad spirit is so infectious that the movie makes you feel at home in its world even if the landscape is, at first glance, unfamiliar."[tpl]cite news|url= http://movies.nytimes.com/2010/08/13/movies/13scott.html |title= This Girl Has a Lot of Baggage, and He Must Shoulder the Load|work=The New York Times|last= Scott | first = A.O. | authorlink = A. O. Scott | date=August 12, 2010|accessdate=August 18, 2010[/tpl]  According to Michael Phillips, "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is different, and not just because it's funny first and everything else second. Director and co-writer Edgar Wright understands the appeal of the original Bryan Lee O'Malley graphic novels...O'Malley's manga-inspired books combine utter banality with superhero hyperbole, and it's a lot for a director to take on. Wright, who is British, has taken it on and won. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World lives and breathes the style of the original books, with animated squiggles and hearts and stars filling out the frame in many individual shots. Some of this is cute; some of it is better, weirder than 'cute.'" Phillips concludes:[tpl]cite web| first= Michael |last=Phillips| authorlink= Michael Phillips (critic)| url= http://chicago.metromix.com/movies/movie_review/movie-review-scott-pilgrim/2125354/content| date= August 11, 2010| title= Funny first and everything else second| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100826044023/http://chicago.metromix.com/movies/movie_review/movie-review-scott-pilgrim/2125354/content | archivedate= 2010-08-26 | publisher= Metromix| work= Chicago Tribune | accessdate=2013-08-17[/tpl]
 "To enjoy the film you must enjoy the brash, satiric spirit of hero's quest. Cera and his fellow ensemble members, including Kieran Culkin as Scott's roommate, Anna Kendrick as his snippy younger sister and the majestically dour Alison Pill as the band's drummer, mitigate the apocalyptic craziness with their deadpan wiles. At its best, Wright's film is raucous, impudent entertainment." 
After its premiere in Japan, several notable video game, film, and anime industry personalities have praised Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, among them Hironobu Sakaguchi, Goichi Suda, Miki Mizuno, Tomohiko Itō, Rintaro Watanabe, and Takao Nakano.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.edgarwrighthere.com/2011/03/01/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-notable-japanese-personalities-tributes-to-the-film/ | work = Edgar Wright Here | title = Scott Pilgrim Vs.

In June 2013, Scott Pilgrim creator Bryan Lee O'Malley, who is half Korean, half white, stated that he regretted the fact that the film's cast was predominantly white, and that there were not enough roles for minorities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://radiomaru.tumblr.com/post/53857149606/q-this-isnt-meant-to-be-an-insult-or-a-rant-or | work = Radiomaru.com | title = Ask | first= Bryan Lee | last=O'Malley | authorlink = Bryan Lee O'Malley |date=June 25, 2013|accessdate=July 11, 2013[/tpl]
