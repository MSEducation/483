The Mickey Slim was a drink that had short-lived popularity in the United States in the 1940s and 1950s.[tpl]cite web|title=Mickey Slim: Delicious World of Cocktail|url=http://cocktails.gourmetrecipe.com/cocktails-with-gin-mickey-slim_l54|publisher=zcocktails|accessdate=7 June 2012[/tpl] According to the The Dedalus Book of Absinthe by Phil Baker,The Dedalus Book of Absinthe by Phil Baker (Dedalus, 2001) ISBN 1-873982-94-1.[tpl]cite news|last=Lezard|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Lezard|title=In a green shade|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/dec/15/historybooks.highereducation2|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 December 2001[/tpl] it was made by combining gin with a pinch of DDT (also known as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), an insecticide that would later be banned in most countries; consumers of this concoction claimed that its effects were similar to absinthe.
Due to lack of documentary evidence, it has been questioned whether this is a modern urban legend.[tpl]cite web|title=The Myth of the Mickey Slim|url=http://www.microkhan.com/2010/06/09/the-myth-of-the-mickey-slim/|first=Brendan|last=Koerner|authorlink=Brendan I.

Time Magazine, August 1, 1971 reported that Pest Control Executive Robert Loibl and his wife Louise start breakfast with a 10-mg. capsule of DDT to demonstrate its safety. Elsewhere[tpl]where|date=November 2013[/tpl], it was reported that a University of Arizona professor did the same in the late 1980s. They would have mentioned any psychoactive effects. There have been no reports of this tasteless chemical having any psychoactive effects, thus it is unlikely that it has an effect "similar to absinthe", especially since the here assumed[tpl]by whom|date=January 2014[/tpl] "effect of absinthe", that is, the effect of the chemical thujone, has in recent times been revealed to be close to non-existent.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1186/1747-597X-1-14 |year=2006 |last1=Padosch |first1=Stephan A |last2=Lachenmeier |first2=Dirk W |last3=Kr√∂ner |first3=Lars U |journal=Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy |volume=1 |page=14[/tpl] This cocktail is surely an urban legend[tpl]or|date=November 2013[/tpl].
This beverage should not be confused with the knockout drink, the Mickey Finn.
