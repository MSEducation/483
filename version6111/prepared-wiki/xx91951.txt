The Institution of Engineers (India) (IEI) is the national organisation for engineers in India.http://www.ieindia.org  Institution of Engineers (India) Official Website - About IEI IEI has over 0.5 million members from 15 engineering disciplines in 99 centers or chapters in India and overseas; it is the largest multi-disciplinary engineering professional society in the English-speaking world.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] It is currently headquartered in Kolkata.

==History==

IEI was established in 1920 in Madras with Sir Thomas R. J. Ward as the founding president. It was formally inaugurated in 1921 by Lord Chelmsford, the then-Viceroy of British India. In 1935, IEI obtained the Royal Charter of Incorporation from King George V 'to promote and advance the science, practice and business of engineering'.
Sir Thomas Guthrie Russell (president 1933–34) lead the successful petition for a Royal Charter. The current president is Er Ashok Kumar Basa and the two Vice Presidents are Dr.L V Muralikrishna Reddy and Er S K Shukla
The Institution obtained the full membership of the Engineers Mobility Forum (EMF) at the Bi-annual International Engineers Meetings 2009 held at Kyoto, Japan on 17 June 2009. The IEI delegation to the meetings was led by its President, Rear Admiral K O Thakare.

==Membership categories==

===Membership designations===

===F.I.E. (Fellow)===

Fellowship (F.I.E.) is the most senior and most reputed engineering degree of IEI in engineering and technology awarded by The Institution of Engineers (India). Holders are entitled to use the post-nominals, F.I.E.. By dignity, F.I.E. (Fellowship of The Institution of Engineers India) is equivalent to a doctorate degree certificate (Ph.D.) in engineering and technology, awarded by recognized Indian universities

===M.I.E.===

Membership is also a more senior and more reputed engineering degree of IEI in engineering and technology awarded by The Institution of Engineers (India). Holders are entitled to use the post-nominals, M.I.E.. By dignity, M.I.E. (Membership of The Institution of Engineers India) is equivalent to a master degree certificate (M.Tech.) in engineering and technology, awarded by recognized Indian universities

===A.M.I.E. (Associate Member)===

Associate Member (A.M.I.E.) is a professional engineering degree certification awarded by the Institution. A.M.I.E.(Associate Member of The Institution of Engineers India) was earlier called A.I.E. (Associate of The Institution of Engineers India) and was even earlier known as Grad.I.E. (Graduate of The Institution of Engineers India). By Government of India A.M.I.E. (Associate Member) degree certificate is just equivalent to a bachelor degree certificate (B.Tech.) in engineering and technology, awarded by recognized Indian universities
For those who have not pursued a formal education in Engineering, an associate membership can be achieved by qualifying in the examinations conducted by the institution. This entails passing Section A, Section B and the Project Work, Laboratory Experiments examination of the Institution. Senior Technician Members and Technician Members shall, on passing the Section 'A&B' examination, be transferred to the class of Associate Member (A.M.I.E.) automatically.
As per clause 32(c) of Regulations of The Institution of Engineers (India), 8 Gokhale Rode, Kolkata. Senior Technician Member and Technician Member shall on passing Section ‘A&B’ Examination of The Institution of Engineers (India) be transferred to the class of Associate Member automatically, admitted as engineering graduate by IEI in their branch of engineering, and issued an engineering degree certificate of Associate Member (A.M.I.E.) with attachment to their branch of engineering and with publishing their A.M.I.E. details online in the website of The Institution of Engineers (India), which can be verified from their online verification link. Fee for transfer from Senior Technician Membership / Technician Membership to the Grade of Associate Membership (A.M.I.E.) is collected and absorbed during registration for Section B Examination.
Since 1928, an associate membership to the IEI has been deemed equivalent (by the Association of Indian Universities and the Union Public Service Commission) to an undergraduate degree in Engineering. The Indian Ministry of Human Resource Development considers that this qualification is equivalent to a B.E. and B.Tech degree awarded by recognized Indian university and to a British Bachelor's Honours degree.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ieindia.org/RECOGNITION.aspx |title=Recognitions of Institution Examinations |publisher=Institution of Engineers (India) |accessdate=13 September 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ieindia.org/PDF_IMAGES/ACADEMIC/UK_NARIC.pdf |title=NARIC certificate |accessdate=3 September 2013[/tpl] It is also recognized by the Foreign Credential Service of America as equivalent to a Bachelor's degree in engineering.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ieindia.org/PDF_IMAGES/ACADEMIC/Credential%20Evaluation.pdf | title=Academic Credential Evaluation Report |accessdate=3 September 2013[/tpl]

In addition to representing India in the Engineers Mobility Forum, the institution has been prominent in World Mining Congress (WMC), the World Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO), the Commonwealth Engineers’ Council (CEC), the Fédération Internationale du Béton (fib), and the Federation of Engineering Institutions of South and Central Asia (FEISCA). It has worldwide bilateral agreements with other professional societies.

==MHRD decision==

The MHRD, Department of Higher Education, Government of India released an Official Memorandum in 2012 stating that candidates enrolled with IEI, with permanent recognition up to May 31, 2013 only, will have equivalence for central government posts.http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/OM_06122012.pdf
A write petition was filed by IEI in Delhi High Court for quashing the orders of MHRD.http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=119047&yr=2013 Other professional bodies like The Institution Of Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering,http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=106538&yr=2013, and The Institution Of Civil Engineers (India) http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=106539&yr=2013, separately filed similar petitions against MCourt has put a stay on MHRD's decision to withdraw the recognition until final outcome of the petition.
