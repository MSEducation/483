[tpl]nihongo|Lennus II: Fuuin no Shito|レナスII　封印の使徒||"Lennus II: The Apostles of the Seals"[/tpl] is a role-playing video game released in 1996 by Asmik Corporation for the Super Famicom.

==Summary==

This video game is the sequel to Lennus; unlike Lennus, which Enix brought to North America under the title of 
Paladin's Quest, Lennus II was released only in Japan.
Lennus II was released on July 26, 1996, nearly four years after its predecessor, and a full month after the Nintendo 64; accordingly, it featured much-improved graphics and sound. The plot centers around a hero, Falus, who must find four orbs to avert apocalypse. Falus is the only character central to the player's party; other members are recruited and may be dismissed if a superior replacement is found. The music was critically acclaimed, and two of its tracks were recorded by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra for release on the Orchestral Game Concert compilations.[tpl]cite web | author=Farand, Eric | title=Orchestral Game Concert 4 | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ogc4/ | work=RPGFan.com | accessdate=2008-11-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author=Gann, Patrick | title=Orchestral Game Concert 5 | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ogc5/ | work=RPGFan.com | accessdate=2008-11-19[/tpl]
