British Sea Power are an indie rock band based in Brighton, [tpl]nowrap| East Sussex[/tpl], England, although three of the band members originally come from Natland (near Kendal), Cumbria, England. The wide-ranging nature of their material has led critics to liken their sound to a variety of groups, from The Cure and Joy Division to the Pixies and Arcade Fire.[tpl]Cite web| url= http://web.archive.org/web/20070812013815/http://www.bbc.co.uk./music/release/bqjw| title= BBC - Rock Indie Review - British Sea Power, Open Season| last=Long| first=Chris| work= BBC| publisher= Wayback Machine| accessdate= 6 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |last=Siebelt |first=Olli |title=British Sea Power |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/nbdp/ |accessdate=2007-09-14 |publisher=BBC |postscript=[/tpl][tpl]Cite web |last= |first= |title=British Sea Power Biography |url=http://music.aol.com/artist/british-sea-power/517469/biography |accessdate=2008-09-14 |postscript= [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |last= |first= |title=Review of Open Season |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A3840770 |accessdate=2007-09-14 |publisher= BBC |postscript= [/tpl] The band are famed for their live performances, the unusual lyrical content of their songs and the adventurous choice of locations for some of their shows.

==History==

===Early years and The Decline of British Sea Power===

British Sea Power's Yan and Hamilton are brothers[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/mar/13/elbow-doves-birdwatching-pop-music |title=Twitchin' the night away |date=2009-03-13 |author=Roy Wilkinson |quote=My younger brothers Yan and Hamilton are BSP's co-frontmen. |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-11-17 | location=London[/tpl] and were school friends with Wood in Kendal. They were in a number of bands together while at school, but after finishing his exams Yan moved to study at the University of Reading, where he met guitarist Noble, who was originally from Bury, Greater Manchester. A few years later, Hamilton and Wood joined them and formed a band.
They played some gigs and produced a 4 track demo in Reading as British Air Powers, before relocating to Brighton in search of a more active music scene. "British Sea Power" was actually the name of one of these demo tracks, and was eventually reworked into "Carrion". In Brighton, BSP amassed a strong local following, due mainly to their own club night called "Club Sea Power". The club nights featured many different support acts, including the Copper Family, a 200-year-old Sussex folk troupe, and other forms of entertainment such as a 1940s fashion show, and were most frequently hosted at the Freebutt and the Lift clubs.
Their first single, "Fear of Drowning", was issued in limited numbers on their own Golden Chariot label. The artwork for the B side, "A Wooden Horse", borrows heavily from the dust cover of the 1950 book The Wooden Horse that details the escape of Allied POWs during World War II. Geoff Travis of Rough Trade Records, impressed by seeing the band live, signed them to his label in September 2001. Originally a four-piece, Eamon Hamilton was recruited to play keyboards and bass drum in autumn 2002.
The Decline of British Sea Power, the band's first album, was released in June 2003 to critical acclaim. A single from the album, "Carrion", became the band's first Top 40 single. The album only charted in the lower reaches of the UK Album Chart but turned out to be a word-of-mouth success, selling well over 60,000 copies in the following two years and allowing them to play sell-out UK tours to audiences of over 1,000 people.

===Open Season===

thumb|left|Yan, Hamilton & Eamon - Grasmere Village Hall (2005)The follow-up, Open Season, was released in early April 2005, and also enjoyed wide critical praise. It showcased a more accessible, produced sound and charted at No. 13 in the UK Albums Chart. The lead single, "It Ended on an Oily Stage", charted at No. 18 in the UK Singles Chart a week earlier.
British Sea Power had won the 2004 Time Out Live Band of the Year award and by this time had built a reputation for elaborate and well-thought out live shows. Stages were often decorated with foliage and plastic birds and shows would generally finish with a semi-improvised song called "Rock in A", which sometimes lasted for over 20 minutes. Various members would climb riggings and tear down the foliage, while Eamon would walk around the audience beating his marching drum. The encore would sometimes see an eight-foot bear, Ursine Ultra, join in the performance. 
The stage antics have become one of the signatures of the band. Another is their choice of venues. Their tours have often included unusual locations such as the Scillonian Club on the Isles of Scilly, Grasmere Village Hall, the Czech Embassy in London and Carnglaze Caverns in Cornwall. They have also played in museums, libraries and sea forts.
The band has built up an eccentric image in interviews and press releases. This has included giving journalists grid references at which to meet them, and expressing obsessions with Field Marshal Montgomery and bird watching. Similarly, they appeared on the TV show Countryfile in which they discussed their love of the countryside and played an outdoor performance of the track "Canvey Island".
At the beginning of 2006, it was announced that Eamon had left British Sea Power to concentrate on his own band Brakes.[tpl]ref|ref-02[/tpl]
