Patrick Michael LaFontaine (born February 22, 1965) is an American former ice hockey center in the National Hockey League (NHL) who spent his entire career playing for the league's New York State-based teams; LaFontaine played for the New York Islanders from 1983 until 1991, the Buffalo Sabres from 1991 until 1997, and the New York Rangers from 1997 until his retirement in 1998, scoring 468 goals and 1,013 points along the way before his career was ended by concussions. His 1.17 points per game (1,013 points over 865 games) is the best among American-born ice hockey players, active or retired. LaFontaine served as an executive to the Buffalo Sabres' as the President of Hockey Operations until March 2014.

==Junior hockey==

Although he was born in St. Louis, LaFontaine grew up in Waterford, Michigan (his father, a Chrysler executive, moved the family to the Detroit area in 1972) and graduated from Waterford Kettering High School. LaFontaine began his junior career with the Verdun Juniors of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) during the 1982–83 season). In his only season in the QMJHL, LaFontaine contributed 104 goals and 130 assists for Verdun. LaFontaine's 234 points was tops in the league and he was awarded the Jean Béliveau Trophy as the top scorer, out-dueling future NHL icon Mario Lemieux. His rookie season broke many records, including Guy Lafleur's 40-game point-scoring streak and Mike Bossy's 70 goals by a rookie.
Other awards LaFontaine received that season were the Michel Brière Memorial Trophy as the MVP of the regular season, the Guy Lafleur Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs, the Michel Bergeron Trophy as the Offensive Rookie of the Year, the Mike Bossy Trophy as the best professional prospect, and the Frank J. Selke Memorial Trophy as the Most sportsmanlike player. Also in 1982–1983, Pat Lafontaine was chosen as the CHL Player of the Year.

==NHL career==

On October 1, 1981, the New York Islanders traded Bob Lorimer and Dave Cameron to the Colorado Rockies for the Rockies' (later market rival New Jersey Devils') first round draft pick in 1983; LaFontaine was selected by the Islanders in the 1st round as the 3rd pick overall in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft with that pick. After representing the United States in the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, LaFontaine joined the Islanders in time for the Stanley Cup Finals. His arrival was concurrent with the beginning of the end of the Islanders' dynasty, as the team was steeped deep in aging veterans. The Islanders lost the finals that year to the Edmonton Oilers, ending the team's run of consecutive Stanley Cup championships at four. LaFontaine had a strong performance, scoring two third-period goals during the Islanders' 5–2 loss to the Oilers in the fifth and deciding game of the series.
In the 1987 Stanley Cup playoffs, LaFontaine scored a the winning goal in the 4th overtime period of the seventh and decisive game between the Islanders and Washington Capitals, known as the "Easter Epic".  The game was started on Saturday, April 18, and concluded just before 2 a.m. on the 19, Easter Sunday.  "It was the most memorable moment in my hockey life," he later recalled. "Even today, wherever I go, people come up to me and start telling me where they were during the Easter Epic."[tpl]cn|date=June 2013[/tpl]
The Islanders continued to struggle and in 1989, they missed the playoffs for the first time since 1974. In the first game of the Islanders' next playoff series, in 1990, LaFontaine suffered the first of many concussions, after a controversial, open-ice hit by James Patrick of the New York Rangers. He fell on his head and was unconscious while being taken off the ice on a stretcher. The ambulance he took was delayed en route to the hospital by Ranger fans who rocked and pounded it as it left Madison Square Garden.[tpl]Cite news |title=HOCKEY; Bitterness Lingers Over Treatment of LaFontaine |first=Joe |last=Lapointe |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/07/sports/hockey-bitterness-lingers-over-treatment-of-lafontaine.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 7, 1990 |accessdate=June 2, 2013[/tpl] He was lost for the remainder of the series.
The 1990–91 season was a successful season for LaFontaine, but not the Islanders, who finished with a record of 25–45–10. LaFontaine, frustrated with his situation on Long Island, turned down a four year, $6 million contract offer and refused to report to the Islanders for the start of the 1991–92 NHL season.[tpl]cite news|title=Isles trade LaFontain|newspaper=The Hour|date=October 25, 1991|author=Associated Press[/tpl]  Three weeks into the season, on October 25, 1991, LaFontaine was traded, along with Randy Wood, to the Buffalo Sabres for four players, including former first overall pick Pierre Turgeon.
LaFontaine responded with a personal-best and team-record 148 points (53 goals and 95 assists).  The 148 points are also the most points ever scored by an American-born player in one season.[tpl]cite web|last=Morreale|first=Mike G.|title=In '92-93, LaFontaine's line was something special|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=645677|work=nhl.com|accessdate=August 12, 2013|date=November 17, 2012[/tpl]  His play-making ability helped his linemate Alexander Mogilny set a team season record with 76 goals, (as of 2013, both LaFontaine's 95 assists, 148 points and Mogilny's 76 goals still stand as the Sabres' team records for a single season). LaFontaine finished as runner-up to Mario Lemieux in the scoring race and earned a spot on the postseason NHL All-Star Second Team. He was also a finalist for the Hart Trophy as NHL MVP and the Lady Byng Trophy as the most sportsmanlike player. In 1994-95 he was awarded the Bill Masterton Trophy as the player who best exemplified the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to ice hockey.
LaFontaine is one of five players in NHL history to skate for all three teams based in the state of New York. The others were Mike Donnelly, Jason Dawe, Martin Biron, and Taylor Pyatt. Unique amongst them, LaFontaine played his entire career in the state of New York while Donnelly, Pyatt, Biron and Dawe all played for additional teams outside the state in their careers. LaFontaine once joked about it, saying "I think I'm the only player in history who has been traded twice and hasn't had to change his license plate."[tpl]cite news|last=Lapointe|first=Joe|title=HOCKEY; Rangers Finally Make Deal for LaFontaine|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/30/sports/hockey-rangers-finally-make-deal-for-lafontaine.html|accessdate=August 12, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 30, 1997[/tpl]

==Retirement==

The 1996–97 season was the beginning of the end of his career.  In a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, LaFontaine was hammered by François Leroux with a high hit to the head, knocking him out with a concussion, and resulted in post-concussion syndrome.   He was determined to return, even though the doctors advised against such an attempt.  Sabres management, in conjunction with team doctors and specialists, refused to clear LaFontaine to return, and recommended he retire.  LaFontaine, still believing he could play, was traded to the New York Rangers in a cost-cutting measure[tpl]cite web|title=Pat LaFontaine|url=http://www.sabresalumni.com/playerprofile.php?playerid=10219|work=All-Time Roster|publisher=Sabres Alumni Association|accessdate=March 21, 2011[/tpl] for a 2nd round draft choice in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft and future considerations on September 29, 1997.[tpl]cite web|title=All-Time Roster|url=http://rangers.nhl.com/club/atrplayer.htm?id=8448626|work=Pat LaFontaine|publisher=New York Rangers.com|accessdate=March 21, 2011[/tpl] During his one season with the Rangers, he tied for the team lead in goals scored, and recorded his 1,000th career NHL point.
In a game against the Ottawa Senators on March 16, 1998, LaFontaine accidentally collided with teammate Mike Keane and suffered another concussion.  LaFontaine missed the remainder of the season and all of the next season, announcing his retirement formally on October 12, 1999.[tpl]cite web|last=Morreale|first=Mike G.|title=Bruins shut Savard down for remainder of season|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=551872|work=News|publisher=NHL.com|accessdate=March 21, 2011|date=February 7, 2011[/tpl]
