Seta [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|t|ə[/tpl], plural: setae [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|t|iː[/tpl], is a biological term derived from the Latin word for "bristle". It refers to a number of different bristle- or hair-like structures on living organisms.

==Animal setae==

In zoology, most "setae" occur in invertebrates.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]

==Fungal setae==

In mycology, "setae" refer to dark brown, thick-walled, thorn-like cystidia found in corticioid and poroid fungi in the family Hymenochaetaceae.[tpl]cite book |author=Kirk PM, Cannon PF, Minter DW, Stalpers JA. |title=Dictionary of the Fungi |edition=10th |publisher=CABI |location=Wallingford |year=2008|page=116|isbn=978-0-85199-826-8[/tpl] Though mainly microscopic, the setae of some species may be sufficiently prominent to be visible with a hand lens.

==Plant setae==

In botany, "seta" refers to the stalk supporting the capsule of a moss or liverwort, and supplying it with nutrients. The seta is part of the sporophyte and has a short foot embedded in the gametophyte on which it is parasitic. Setae are not present in all mosses, but in some species they may reach 15 to 20 centimeters in height.[tpl]aut|Raven, Peter H.; Evert, R.F. & Eichhorn, S.E.[/tpl] (2005): Biology of Plants (7th ed.).

==Synthetic setae==

Synthetic setae are a class of synthetic adhesives that detach at will, sometimes called resetable adhesives, yet display substantial stickiness.  The development of such synthetic materials is a matter of current research.[ref]

The distinguishing characteristics of the gecko adhesion system have been described as (1) anisotropic attachment, (2) high pulloff force to preload ratio, (3) low detachment force, (4) material independence, (5) self-cleaning, (6) anti-self sticking and (7) non-sticky default state. ... The gecko’s adhesive structures are made from ß-keratin (modulus of elasticity approx. 2 GPa). Such a stiff material is not inherently sticky; however, because of the gecko adhesive’s hierarchical nature and extremely small distal features (spatulae are approx. 200 nm in size), the gecko’s foot is able to intimately conform to the surface and generate significant attraction using van der Waals forces.[/tpl][/ref]Engineers create new adhesive that mimics gecko toe hairs Physorg.com Jan 29, 2008Setae Research
