[[Avalancha de Éxitos]]

CATEGORIES: Café Tacuba albums, 1996 albums

Avalancha de Éxitos (Avalanche of Hits) was Café Tacuba's third album. In 1996, two years after their acclaimed Re, the band had amassed enough new music to fill four CDs, but couldn't winnow it down to a single album. So instead, they covered eight songs by other Spanish-speaking artists, who ranged from totally obscure to well-known.

==Track listing==

All the covers are very different from the originals - and from each other. Chilanga Banda is a hip-hop piece in Mexican slang (featuring the sound "ch"), and Ojalá Que Llueva Café is marked by fast-paced fiddle and rapid switching from chest register to head register - reminiscent, in fact, of yodeling. This is a continuation of the precedent the band established with Re, their previous album, of constant genre-shifting.
