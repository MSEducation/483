[[Hiranyaksha]]

CATEGORIES: Asura, Rakshasa

In Hinduism, Hiranyaksha ([tpl]lang-sa|हिरण्‍याक्ष[/tpl]) golden-eyed was an Asura of pre-ancient India and the son of Diti and Kashyap. 
He was slain by the god Vishnu after he (Hiranyaksha) took the Earth to the bottom of what has been described as the "Cosmic ocean".  
Vishnu assumed the Avatar of a boar - Varaha and dove into the ocean to lift the Earth, in the process slaying Hiranyaksha who was obstructing Him. The battle lasted one thousand years.  
He had an elder brother named Hiranyakashipu, who after having undertaken penances which made him  incredibly powerful and invincible unless several conditions were met, was later slain by Narasimha, another avatar of Vishnu.
Kashyapa (Sanskrit कश्यप kaśyapa) was an ancient sage (rishis), who is one of the Saptarshis in the present Manvantara; with others being Atri, Vashishtha, Vishvamitra, Gautama, Jamadagni, Bharadwaja 1
He was the father of the Devas, Asuras, Nagas and all of humanity. He married Aditi, with whom he fathered Agni, the Aditya.2 With his second wife, Diti, he begot the Daityas. Diti and Aditi were daughters of King Daksha Prajapati and sisters to Sati, Shiva's consort. 
Diti conceived a child in the evening time, whom she carried for a hundred years in the womb. She thus gave birth to Hiranyaksha.
