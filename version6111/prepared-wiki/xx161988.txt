==History==

Following the national trend of providing public parks, and with the closure of the nearby Temple Gardens, which had operated on a semi-public basis, the Lincoln Commons Act (1870) was passed. Monks Leys Common, located to the east of the city, was purchased by the Corporation through Act of Parliament. Authorisation was also given to sell [tpl]convert|3|acre|ha[/tpl] of the land for residential building purposes to help fund the layout and construction of the Arboretum, which would become Lincoln's first truly public park.
The Arboretum has a lodge at its west entrance on Monks Road, and has three terraces of housing adjoining it to its western edge: Arboretum View, Monks Leys Terrace, and Woodland View.

==Renovation of the Arboretum in 2002–2003==

The Arboretum reopened on 19 September 2003, following £3 million worth of restoration work to bring it back to its original state. Works have included: overhauling and improving the facilities at Abbey Lodge to provide a community access centre and visitor tea rooms, restoration of the Victorian bandstand, new period railings, restoration of a cast iron folly, new asphalt footpaths, refurbished gardens and extensive replanting, the introduction of a new children's maze, resurfacing of the major terrace feature, refurbishment of the ponds and bridges, underpinning and replacement of the stone steps, new lighting columns, installation of closed-circuit television (CCTV), refurbishment of the children play area, restoration of the lion statue and restoration of the two fountain features.[tpl]cite web|title=Lincoln Arboretum|url=http://www.visitlincoln.com/things-to-do/lincoln-arboretum|work=Visit Lincoln|accessdate=13 October 2013[/tpl]
