[[Gold(III) oxide]]

CATEGORIES: Gold compounds, Oxides, Sesquioxides

Gold(III) oxide (Au2O3) is the most stable oxide of gold. It is a red-brown, thermally unstable solid that decomposes at 160 °C.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw[/tpl] The hydrated form is weakly acidic and dissolves in concentrated alkali to form salts that are believed to contain the Au(OH)4 ion.
Anhydrous Au[tpl]sub|2[/tpl]O[tpl]sub|3[/tpl] can be prepared by heating amorphous hydrated gold(III) oxide with perchloric acid and an alkali metal perchlorate in a sealed quartz tube at a temperature of around 250 °C and a pressure of around 30 MPa.Jones PG, Rumpel H, Sheldrick GM, Schwartzmann E, Gold(III) Oxide and Oxychloride, Gold Bulletin 1980, 13, 56.
