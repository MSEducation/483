Political borders have a variety of meanings for those whom they affect.  Many borders in the world have checkpoints where border control agents inspect those crossing the boundary.
In much of Europe, such controls were abolished by the Schengen Agreement and subsequent European Union legislation. Since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the competence to pass laws on crossing internal and external borders within the European Union and the associated Schengen States (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein) lies exclusively within the jurisdiction of the European Union, except where states have used a specific right to opt-out (United Kingdom and Ireland, which maintain a common travel area amongst themselves). For details, see Schengen Area.
The United States has notably increased measures taken in border control on the Canada–United States border and the United States–Mexico border during its War on Terrorism (See Shantz 2010). One American writer has said that the [tpl]convert|3,600|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] US-Mexico border is probably "the world's longest boundary between a First World and Third World country".Murphy, Cullen. Roman Empire: gold standard of immigration. Los Angeles Times, June 16, 2007 (accessed here June 20, 2007)
Historic borders such as the Great Wall of China, the Maginot Line, and Hadrian's Wall have played a great many roles and been marked in different ways.  While the stone walls, the Great Wall of China and the Roman Hadrian's Wall in Britain had military functions, the entirety of the Roman borders were very porous, which encouraged Roman economic activity with neighbors.Murphy 2007 On the other hand, a border like the Maginot Line was entirely military and was meant to prevent any access in what was to be World War II to France by its neighbor, Germany.  Germany ended up going around the Maginot Line through Belgium just as it had done in World War I.
The most ancient, continuously existing international border is the border between Italy and Switzerland in the zone of Canton Tessin: established in 1516 by the Treaty of Fribourg between France, owner of Lombardy at time, and the Swiss Confederation, it was never suspended or changed for 498 years.Even if some borders in Western Europe were traced many years before, they were sometimes suspended during the last five centuries, especially during the Napoleonic era or World War II. It is not the case of present-day Swiss-Italian border in Tessin zone.

==Cross-border regions==

Macro-regional integration initiatives, such as the European Union and NAFTA, have spurred the establishment of cross-border regions. These are initiatives driven by local or regional authorities, aimed at dealing with local border-transcending problems such as transport and environmental degradation.Perkmann, M, Building governance institutions across European borders, Regional Studies, 1999, Vol: 33, Pages: 657 - 667, hdl.handle.net Many cross-border regions are also active in encouraging intercultural communication and dialogue as well as cross-border economic development strategies.
 In Europe, the European Union provides financial support to cross-border regions via its Interreg programme. The Council of Europe has issued the Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation, providing a legal framework for cross-border co-operation even though it is in practice rarely used by Euroregions.

==Border studies==

There has been a renaissance in the study of borders during the past two decades, partially from creation of a counter narrative to notions of a borderless world that have been advanced as part of globalization theory.D. Newman & A. Paasi, `Fences and neighbours in the post-modern world: boundary narratives in political geography', Progress in Human Geography, 22 (2), 186-207, 1998; D. Newman, "The lines that continue to separate us: Borders in our borderless world", Progress in Human Geography, Vol 30 (2), 1-19, 2006. Examples of recent initiatives are the Border Regions in Transition network of scholars,Border Regions in Transition IX Conference, North American and European Border Regions in Comparative Perspective: Markets, States and Border Communities, (January 12-15, 2008) Victoria, BC Canada and Bellingham, WA United States. the International Boundaries Research Unit at the University of Durham,International Boundaries Research Unit, University of Durham. the Association of Borderlands Studies based in North America,Association for Borderland Studies. the African Borderlands Research Network (ABORNE) and the founding of smaller border research centres at NijmegenNijmegen Centre for Border Research. and Queen's University Belfast.Centre for International Borders Research (CIBR) Queen's University Belfast

The following pictures show in how many different ways international and regional borders can be closed off, monitored, at least marked as such, or simply unremarkable.
