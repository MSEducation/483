The discography of Yellowcard, an American pop punk band from Jacksonville, Florida, consists of nine studio albums, eleven singles, two live albums, two extended plays, one video album, and two compilation albums.
Yellowcard released their debut album, Midget Tossing, on April 1, 1997, via DIY Records. This album, along with their next two albums, Where We Stand (1999) and One for the Kids (2001), failed to garner any chart success on the Billboard music charts. Also, no singles were ever released from any of these albums.
However, in 2003, they achieved success with the release of Ocean Avenue. The album charted within the Top 30 of the Billboard 200, as well as the Top 10 in New Zealand. The album's title track was a Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 single. This single, along with the follow-up single, "Only One", was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album was then certified Platinum in the US by July 2004.
Their fifth album, Lights and Sounds (2006), was an even bigger success on the Billboard 200, peaking within the Top 5. While not charting a Top 40 single on the Hot 100, the album's title track reached #50 on the chart, as well as becoming their highest chart entry on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks (now Alternative Songs) chart. They then released Paper Walls in 2007 before taking a two-year hiatus in 2008. They reformed in 2010 and released When You're Through Thinking, Say Yes on March 22, 2011. Their latest album, Southern Air, was released on August 14, 2012, which features the single "Always Summer".
