CATEGORIES: Anglo-Saxon writers, Vikings, 9th-century European people, 9th-century writers

Wulfstan of Hedeby (Latin Haithabu) was a late ninth century traveller and trader. His travel accounts, as well as those of another trader, Ohthere, were included in Alfred the Great's translation of Orosius' Histories. It is unclear if Wulfstan was English or indeed if he was from Hedeby, in today's northern Germany near the city of Schleswig.
According to this account,[tpl]clarify|date=September 2012[/tpl] Wulfstan undertook a journey by sea from Hedeby to the trading centre of Truso around the year 880. He names the lands the coasts he passes.
This may be the earliest recorded use of the word "Denmark" (or "Danemearcan").
