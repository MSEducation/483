 Our favourite story from the Plaza's long history concerns the management's way of keeping rowdy youngsters in check in those long gone days. The Plaza's secret weapon was a long pole with a stuffed boxing glove on the end. Anyone who started thowing popcorn, making too much noise or any committing any other misdemeanour would get a solid poke with the boxing glove from the extra long arm of the law!
