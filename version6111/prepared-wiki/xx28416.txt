Ralph Cook Craig (June 21, 1889 – July 21, 1972) was an American athlete, winner of the sprint double at the 1912 Summer Olympics.
Craig was born in Detroit, Michigan. Initially a hurdler, he developed into a sprinter at the University of Michigan. In 1910, he won the IC4A 220 y championship, repeating this the following year.
In 1912, Craig qualified for the Olympic team and went to Sweden, where he reached the final of the 100m. A big favourite was his compatriot Donald Lippincott, who had set a World Record of 10,6 in the heats. After no less than seven false starts, Craig won the race in 10,8 - Lippincott only finished third. Craig fought out another battle with Lippincott in the 200m, edging him to win the 200 m title. Craig was not a part of the American 4 x 100 m relay team, which was disqualified and didn't medal.
Immediately after the Olympics, Ralph Craig retired from the sport, although his brother, Jimmy, became an All American footballer in 1913.
In 1948, he made a return to the Olympics as an alternate on the US yachting team. Although he did not actually compete, Craig (59) carried the American flag at the opening ceremonies in London.
He died at Lake George, New York.
In 2010 he joined the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.http://www.usatf.org/news/view.aspx?duid=USATF_2010_11_04_13_44_20
