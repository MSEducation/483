There is a small community of French people in Korea

==History==

French people began coming to Korea as early as the seventeenth century, when French Catholic missionaries first came to the country.[tpl]citation|title=The Gospel in All Lands|year=1890|publisher=Methodist Episcopal Church Missionary Society|pages=413–414[/tpl] However, most missionaries came after the 1886 establishment of relations between France and Joseon Dynasty; the treaty signed between the two countries gave French missionaries the right to evangelise in Korea.[tpl]citation|title=구한말의 주한 프랑스인 사회 - 《뮈텔주교일기》를 중심으로/French Society in the Late Chosŏn Era - based Bishop Mutel's Diary|last=Choe|first=Jong-go|pages=79–117|volume=27|date=December 2006|accessdate=2007-05-31|url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/view/ar_view.asp?pid=569&isid=38167&arid=802176&topMenu=&topMenu1=|journal=Journal of the Research Foundation of Korean Church History[/tpl][tpl]citation|title=조불조약이 초기 개신교의 선교활동에 미친 영향/The Impact of the Korean-French Treaty on Protestantism in the Late 19th Century|last=Yi|first=Jin-gu|volume=27|date=December 2006|accessdate=2007-05-31|url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/view/ar_view.asp?pid=569&isid=38167&arid=802174&topMenu=&topMenu1=|journal=Journal of the Research Foundation of Korean Church History[/tpl]

==Distribution==

There were an estimated 2,700 French nationals in South Korea [tpl]asof|2006|lc=on[/tpl].[tpl]citation|url=http://www.korea.net/news/news/newsView.asp?serial_no=20061218015&part=112&SearchDay=2006.12.19|periodical=Korea.net|title=No melting pot, but Seoul still flavored with several dashes of migrant communities|date=2006-12-19|accessdate=2007-05-31[/tpl] Most are employed by French multinationals operating in the country. The largest concentration can be found in the Seorae Village in Seoul's Seocho-gu district, which because of its location on a hill is often compared to Montmartre in Paris. Korea's only school using French as the medium of instruction moved there in 1984.[tpl]citation|url=http://english.kbs.co.kr/life/path/1393425_14466.html|periodical=Korean Broadcasting System|title=French Village in Banpo-dong|last=Lee|first=Kyung-Taek|year=2006|accessdate=2007-05-31[/tpl] Most French children only attend elementary or middle school in Seoul, but then return to France afterwards.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/09/117_51142.html|periodical=The Korea Times|date=2009-09-02|accessdate=2009-09-03|last=Min|first=Ines|title=Costly Changes Impress Few Seorae Residents[/tpl]
In September 2009, the Seoul metropolitan government announced a five billion-won plan to renovate the area and make it more attractive to foreign residents by widening pedestrian walkways and putting up more signs in French. One portion of the pavement, starting from the entrance to Bangbae Middle School, is painted in red, white, and blue, the colours of the flag of France.[tpl]citation|periodical=Korea Herald|first=Annabelle|last=Lee|url=http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/NEWKHSITE/data/html_dir/2009/12/11/200912110071.asp|date=2009-12-11|accessdate=2009-12-11|title=The world within Seoul[/tpl]
