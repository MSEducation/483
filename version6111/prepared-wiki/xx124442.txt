==History==

Concerned about the world’s burgeoning nuclear arsenals, San Francisco philanthropist and activist Sally Lilienthal founded the organization in 1981.  Ploughshares enables individual contributors to pool resources and provide support for the most effective initiatives to prevent the spread and use of nuclear weapons. Since it was founded, Ploughshares has made grants totaling nearly 100 million to hundreds of people and organizations around the world, becoming the largest grantmaking foundation in the U.S. whose exclusive mission is peace and security funding.Nuclear Shadowboxing: Cold War Redux,  A.
