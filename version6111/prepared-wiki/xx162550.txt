In the 19th century, some leaders of the LDS Church taught that participation in [[plural marriage]] was also a requirement of exaltation.<ref>See, e.g., Brigham Young, "Remarks in the Bowery (August 19, 1866)", ''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' '''11''':266 at [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/JournalOfDiscourses3,4491 268]–[http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/JournalOfDiscourses3,4490 269] (1867); Joseph F.
