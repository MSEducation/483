CATEGORIES: Cooking, Survival skills, Home economics

Cooking or cookery is the art of preparing food for consumption with the use of heat. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world, reflecting unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends. The way that cooking takes place also depends on the skill and type of training an individual cook has. Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence of heat, most notably with Ceviche, a traditional South American dish where fish is cooked with the acids in lemon or lime juice. Sushi also uses a similar chemical reaction between fish and the acidic content of rice glazed with vinegar.
Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans, and some scientists believe the advent of cooking played an important role in human evolution.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090213-human-diet-cooking.html |title=Cooking Gave Humans Edge Over Apes? |author=Christine Dell'Amore in Chicago|date=13 February 2009 |publisher=National Geographic News [/tpl] Most anthropologists believe that cooking fires first developed around 250,000 years ago. The expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients. New inventions and technologies, such as pottery for holding and boiling water, expanded cooking techniques. Some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-new-spin-on-cooking |title=A New Spin on Cooking |author=W.

==History==

There is no clear archeological evidence when food was first cooked. Most anthropologists believe that cooking fires began only about 250,000 years ago, when hearths started appearing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Pennisi_99.html |title=Pennisi: Did Cooked Tubers Spur the Evolution of Big Brains? |publisher=Cogweb.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-07[/tpl] Phylogenetic analysis by Chris Organ, Charles Nunn, Zarin Machanda, and Richard Wrangham suggests that cooking may have been invented as far back as 1.8 million to 2.3 million years ago.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.pnas.org/content/108/35/14555.full?sid=95c4876b-9870-4259-888f-24a6179be4fc | title = Phylogenetic rate shifts in feeding time during the evolution of Homo | first = Chris | last = Organ | work= PNAS | date = 22 August 2011 | accessdate=17 April 2012[/tpl] 
Wrangham proposed cooking was instrumental in human evolution, as it reduced the time required for foraging and led to an increase in brain size. He estimates the percentage decrease in gut size of early humans directly correlates to the increase in brain size.[tpl]cite web|last=Bradt |first=Steve |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/11/why-cooking-counts/ |title=Why cooking counts | Harvard Gazette |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-07[/tpl] Most other anthropologists, however, oppose Wrangham,[tpl]cite web|url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Pennisi_99.html |title=Pennisi: Did Cooked Tubers Spur the Evolution of Big Brains? |work=Cogweb.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31[/tpl] stating that archeological evidence suggests that cooking fires began in earnest only about 300,000 years ago,[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140129-oldest-hearth-israel-cave-new-human-species-discovery-archaeology-science/ | title=Oldest Known Hearth Found in Israel Cave | publisher=National Geographic | date=29 January 2014 | accessdate=17 March 2014 | author=Smith, Roff[/tpl] when ancient hearths, earth ovens, burnt animal bones, and flint appear across Europe and the Middle East. Two million years ago, the only sign of fire is burnt earth with human remains, which most other anthropologists consider to be mere coincidence rather than evidence of intentional fire.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=cooking-up-bigger-brains |year=2008 |last1=Gorman |first1=RM |title=Cooking up bigger brains |volume=298 |issue=1 |pages=102, 104–5 |journal=Scientific American |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0108-102[/tpl] The mainstream view among anthropologists is that the increases in human brain size occurred well before the advent of cooking, due to a shift away from the consumption of nuts and berries to the consumption of meat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/99legacy/6-14-1999a.html |title=06.14.99 - Meat-eating was essential for human evolution, says UC Berkeley anthropologist specializing in diet |work=Berkeley.edu |date=1999-06-14 |accessdate=2012-01-31[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Meat+in+the+human+diet:+an+anthropological+perspective-a0169311689 |title=Meat in the human diet: an anthropological perspective. - Free Online Library |work=Thefreelibrary.com |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2012-01-31[/tpl]
Food has become a part of material culture, and cuisine is much more than a substance. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, food was a classic marker in Europe. However, in the nineteenth century, cuisine became a defining symbol of national identity. The discovery of the New World represented a major turning point in the history of food because of the movement of foods from and to Europe, such as potatoes, tomatoes, corn, yams, and beans. Food in America consisted of traditions that were adapted from England, but up until the end of this century, the presence of new ingredients along with the contact between diverse ethnic groups influenced experimentation. Industrialization was also a turning point that changed how food affected the nation.
During the period of industrialization, food began to be mass-produced, mass marketed, and standardized. Factories processed, preserved, canned, and packaged a wide variety of foods, and processed cereals quickly became a defining feature of the American breakfast.http://www.nordion.com/documents/the-history-of-food-irradiation.pdf In the twenties, freezing methods as well as the earliest cafeterias and fast food establishments emerged. This point in time is when processed and nationally distributed foods became a huge part of the nation's diet.
Along with changes in food, there have also been several changes in nutritional guidelines as well. Since 1916, there have been several different nutrition guidelines issued by the United States government, eventually leading up to the food pyramid.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/health/food-pyramid/|title=The history of the food pyramid|publisher=Washington Post|date=31 January 2011|accessdate=2013-04-18[/tpl] In 1916, "Food For Young Children" along with its sequel for adults, "How to Select Foods" was the first USDA guide to give specific dietary guidelines. Updated in the 1920s to these guides gave shopping suggestions for different-sized families along with a Depression Era revision which included four cost levels. In 1943, the USDA created the "Basic Seven" chart to make sure that people got the recommended nutrients. It included the first-ever Recommended Daily Allowances from the National Academy of Sciences. In 1956, the "Essentials of an Adequate Diet" brought recommendations which cut seven down to four groups that school children would learn about for decades. In 1979, a guide called "Food" was published, which addressed the link between too much of certain foods and chronic diseases. This publication also added "fats, oils, and sweets" to the four basic food groups and cautioned moderation. In 1992, the food pyramid was debuted. The USDA introduced this, which represented proportions of foods in a balanced diet. In 2005, the pyramid got a makeover and was renamed MyPyramid. Lastly, in 2011, "MyPlate" came about.

==Ingredients==

Most ingredients in cooking are derived from living organisms. Vegetables, fruits, grains and nuts as well as herbs and spices come from plants, while meat, eggs, and dairy products come from animals. Mushrooms and the yeast used in baking are kinds of fungi. Cooks also use water and minerals such as salt. Cooks can also use wine or spirits.
Naturally occurring ingredients contain various amounts of molecules called proteins, carbohydrates and fats. They also contain water and minerals. Cooking involves a manipulation of the chemical properties of these molecules.

===Carbohydrates===

Carbohydrates include the common sugar, sucrose (table sugar), a disaccharide, and such simple sugars as glucose (from the digestion of table sugar) and fructose (from fruit), and starches from sources such as cereal flour, rice, arrowroot, and potato. The interaction of heat and carbohydrate is complex.
tend to break down into simpler sugars when cooked, while simple sugars can form syrups. If sugars are heated so that all water of crystallisation is driven off, then caramelization starts, with the sugar undergoing thermal decomposition with the formation of carbon, and other breakdown products producing caramel. Similarly, the heating of sugars and proteins elicits the Maillard reaction, a basic flavor-enhancing technique.
An emulsion of starch with fat or water can, when gently heated, provide thickening to the dish being cooked. In European cooking, a mixture of butter and flour called a roux is used to thicken liquids to make stews or sauces. In Asian cooking, a similar effect is obtained from a mixture of rice or corn starch and water. These techniques rely on the properties of starches to create simpler mucilaginous saccharides during cooking, which causes the familiar thickening of sauces. This thickening will break down, however, under additional heat.

===Fats===

Types of fat include vegetable oils, animal products such as butter and lard, as well as fats from grains, including corn and flax oils. Fats can reach temperatures higher than the boiling point of water, and are often used to conduct high heat to other ingredients, such as in frying or sautéing.

===Proteins===

Edible animal material, including muscle, offal, milk, eggs and egg whites, contains substantial amounts of protein. Almost all vegetable matter (in particular legumes and seeds) also includes proteins, although generally in smaller amounts. Mushrooms have high protein content. Any of these may be sources of essential amino acids. When proteins are heated they become denatured (unfolded) and change texture. In many cases, this causes the structure of the material to become softer or more friable – meat becomes cooked and is more friable and less flexible. In some cases, proteins can form more rigid structures, such as the coagulation of albumen in egg whites. The formation of a relatively rigid but flexible matrix from egg white provides an important component in baking cakes, and also underpins many desserts based on meringue.

===Vitamins and minerals===

Vitamins are materials required for normal metabolism but which the body cannot manufacture itself and which must therefore come from external sources. Vitamins come from several sources including fresh fruit and vegetables (Vitamin C), carrots, liver (Vitamin A), cereal bran, bread, liver e ( B vitamins), fish liver oil (Vitamin D) and fresh green vegetables (Vitamin K). Many minerals are also essential in small quantities including iron, calcium, magnesium and sulphur; and in very small quantities copper, zinc and selenium. The micronutrients, minerals, and vitaminsLoss of nutrients when vegetables are cooked in fruit and vegetables may be destroyed or eluted by cooking. Vitamin C is especially prone to oxidation during cooking and may be completely destroyed by protracted cooking.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/359175.stm |work=BBC News | title=Cooking vegetables 'improves benefits' | date=2 June 1999 | accessdate=30 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]Failed verification|date=February 2013[/tpl]The bioavailability of some vitamins such as thiamin, vitamin B6, niacin, folate, and carotenoids are increased with cooking by being freed from the food microstructure. Hotz, Christine, and Rosalind S. Gibson. "Traditional food-processing and preparation practices to enhance the bioavailability of micronutrients in plant-based diets." The Journal of nutrition 137.4 (2007): 1097-1100.

===Water===

Cooking often involves water, frequently present in other liquids, which is both added in order to immerse the substances being cooked (typically water, stock or wine), and released from the foods themselves. Liquids are so important to cooking that the name of the cooking method used is often based on how the liquid is combined with the food, as in steaming, simmering, boiling, braising, and blanching. Heating liquid in an open container results in rapidly increased evaporation, which concentrates the remaining flavor and ingredients – this is a critical component of both stewing and sauce making.

==Methods==

There are very many methods of cooking, most of which have been known since antiquity. These include baking, roasting, frying, grilling, barbecuing, smoking, boiling, steaming and braising. A more recent innovation is microwaving. Various methods use differing levels of heat and moisture and vary in cooking time. The method chosen greatly affects the end result because some foods are more appropriate to some methods than others. Some major hot cooking techniques include:

==Cooking and health==

===Food safety===

When heat is used in the preparation of food, it can kill or inactivate harmful organisms, such as bacteria and viruses, as well as various parasites, tapeworms and Toxoplasma gondii being the most common. Food poisoning and other illness from uncooked or poorly-prepared food may be caused by bacteria such as pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Campylobacter, viruses such as noroviruses, and protozoa such as Entamoeba histolytica. Parasites may be introduced through salad, meat that is uncooked or not thoroughly done rare, and unboiled water.
The sterilizing effect of cooking depends on temperature, cooking time, and technique used. However, some bacteria such as Clostridium botulinum or Bacillus cereus, can form spores that survive cooking, which then germinate and regrow after the food has cooled. It is therefore recommended that cooked food should not be reheated more than once to avoid repeated growths that allow the bacteria to proliferate to dangerous level.Safe Food Australia – A Guide to the Food Safety Standards
Cooking prevents many foodborne illnesses that would otherwise occur if the food was eaten raw. Cooking also increases the digestibility of some foods such as grains or lactose because most foods, when raw, are inedible, and some are poisonous. For example kidney beans are toxic when raw or improperly cooked, due to the presence of phytohaemagglutinin which can be inactivated after cooking for at least ten minutes at 100 °C.[tpl]cite journal |author=Noah ND, Bender AE, Reaidi GB, Gilbert RJ |title=NEWS, NOTES, AND EPIDEMIOLOGY |journal=Br Med J |volume=281 |issue=6234 |pages=236–7 |date=Jul 1980 |pmid=7407532 |url= |pmc=1713670[/tpl] Slow cooker however may not reach the desired temperature and cases of poisoning from red beans cooked in slow cooker have been reported.
Other considerations for food safety include preparation, handling, and storage of food. According to the USDA, the temperature range from 40 °F to 140 °F (4 to 60 °C), is the "Danger zone" where bacteria is likely to proliferate, food therefore should not be stored in this temperature range.  Washing of hands and surfaces, and avoidance of cross-contamination are good practices in food safety.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Factsheets/Basics_for_Handling_Food_Safely/index.asp |title=Basics for Handling Food Safely |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=1 April 2012 [/tpl] Food prepared on plastic cutting boards may be less likely to harbor bacteria than wooden ones,[tpl]cite web|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/health/foodsafety/az1076.html|title=Cutting Boards (Plastic Versus Wood)|publisher=Cooperative Extension, College of Agriculture & Life Sciences, the University of Arizona|work=Food Safety, Preparation and Storage Tips|year=1998|accessdate=21 June 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060613074257/http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/health/foodsafety/az1076.html  |archivedate = 13 June 2006[/tpl] other research however suggested otherwise.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/cutting_board.htm|title=Cutting Boards – wood or plastic?|work=ReluctantGourmet.com|accessdate=21 June 2006[/tpl] Washing and sanitizing cutting boards is highly recommended, especially after use with raw meat, poultry, or seafood. Hot water and soap followed by a rinse with a diluted antibacterial cleaner, or a trip through a dishwasher with a "sanitize" cycle, are effective methods for reducing the risk of illness due to contaminated cooking implements.

===Effects on nutritional content of food===

Proponents of Raw foodism argue that cooking food increases the risk of some of the detrimental effects on food or health. They point out that the cooking of vegetables and fruit containing vitamin C both elutes the vitamin into the cooking water and degrades the vitamin through oxidation. Peeling vegetables can also substantially reduce the vitamin C content, especially in the case of potatoes where most vitamin C is in the skin.Potatoes, nutrition and diet However, research has shown that in the specific case of carotenoids a greater proportion is absorbed from cooked vegetables than from raw vegetables.
German research in 2003 showed significant benefits in reducing breast cancer risk when large amounts of raw vegetable matter are included in the diet. The authors attribute some of this effect to heat-labile phytonutrients.Nutr Cancer. 2003;46(2):131-7 Sulforaphane, which may be found in vegetables such as broccoli, has been shown to be protective against prostate cancer, however, much of it is destroyed when the vegetable is boiled.[tpl]cite doi|10.1021/jf990082e [/tpl]

===Cooking and carcinogens===

In a human epidemiological analysis by Richard Doll and Richard Peto in 1981, diet was estimated to cause a large percentage of cancers.[tpl]cite pmid|7017215 [/tpl] Some of these cancers may be caused by carcinogens in food generated during cooking process, although it is often difficult to identify the specific components in diet that serve to increase cancer risk. Many food, such as beef steak and broccoli, contain low concentrations of both carcinogens and anticarcinogens.[tpl]cite book |title=Carcinogens and Anticarcinogens in the Human Diet |publisher=National Academy Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-309-05391-9 [/tpl]
Several studies published since 1990 indicate that cooking meat at high temperature creates heterocyclic amines (HCAs), which are thought to increase cancer risk in humans. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute found that human subjects who ate beef rare or medium-rare had less than one third the risk of stomach cancer than those who ate beef medium-well or well-done.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/heterocyclic-amines |title=Heterocyclic Amines in Cooked Meats |publisher=National Cancer Institute [/tpl] While eating meat raw may be the only way to avoid HCAs fully, the National Cancer Institute states that cooking meat below [tpl]convert|212|F[/tpl] creates "negligible amounts" of HCAs. Also, microwaving meat before cooking may reduce HCAs by 90%. Nitrosamines, present in processed and cooked foods, have also been noted as being carcinogenic, being linked to colon cancer.
Research has shown that grilling, barbecuing and smoking meat and fish increases levels of carcinogenic Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). In Europe, grilled meat and smoked fish generally only contribute a small proportion of dietary PAH intake since they are a minor component of diet – most intake comes from cereals, oils and fats.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out154_en.pdf |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons – Occurrence in foods, dietary exposure and health effects |author=Scientific Committee on Food |date=4 December 2002 |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=21 August 2010[/tpl] However, in the US, grilled/barbecued meat is the second highest contributor of the mean daily intake of benzoapyrene at 21% after ‘bread, cereal and grain’ at 29%.
Baking, grilling or broiling food, especially starchy foods, until a toasted crust is formed generates significant concentrations of acrylamide, a possible carcinogen.[tpl]cite journal|author = Tareke E, Rydberg P. et al.|title = Analysis of acrylamide, a carcinogen formed in heated foodstuffs|journal = J.

===Other health issues===

Cooking dairy products may reduce a protective effect against colon cancer. Researchers at the University of Toronto suggest that ingesting uncooked or unpasteurized dairy products (see also Raw milk) may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1080/01635589509514381 |author=Corpet DE, Yin Y, Zhang XM, et al. |title=Colonic protein fermentation and promotion of colon carcinogenesis by thermolyzed casein |journal=Nutr Cancer |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=271–81 |year=1995 |pmid=7603887 |pmc=2518970 [/tpl] Mice and rats fed uncooked sucrose, casein, and beef tallow had one-third to one-fifth the incidence of microadenomas as the mice and rats fed the same ingredients cooked.[tpl]cite journal |author=Corpet DE, Stamp D, Medline A, Minkin S, Archer MC, Bruce WR |title=Promotion of colonic microadenoma growth in mice and rats fed cooked sugar or cooked casein and fat |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=50 |issue=21 |pages=6955–8 |date=November 1990 |pmid=2208161 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2208161[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1093/jnci/84.13.1026 |author=Zhang XM, Stamp D, Minkin S, et al. |title=Promotion of aberrant crypt foci and cancer in rat colon by thermolyzed protein |journal=J.

According to the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, health benefits claimed by raw milk advocates do not exist. "The small quantities of antibodies in milk are not absorbed in the human intestinal tract," says Barbara Ingham, PhD, associate professor and extension food scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "There is no scientific evidence that raw milk contains an anti-arthritis factor or that it enhances resistance to other diseases.""Got Milk?" by Linda Bren. FDA Consumer. Sept–Oct 2004.
Heating sugars with proteins or fats can produce Advanced glycation end products ("glycotoxins").[tpl]Cite journal| author = Koschinsky T, He CJ, Mitsuhashi T, Bucala R, Liu C, Buenting C, Heitmann K, Vlassara H | title = Orally absorbed reactive glycation products (glycotoxins): An environmental risk factor in diabetic nephropathy | journal =Proc.

==Science of cooking==

The application of scientific knowledge to cooking and gastronomy has become known as molecular gastronomy. This is a subdiscipline of food science. Important contributions have been made by scientists, chefs and authors such as Herve This (chemist), Nicholas Kurti (physicist), Peter Barham (physicist), Harold McGee (author), Shirley Corriher (biochemist, author), Heston Blumenthal (chef), Ferran Adria (chef), Robert Wolke (chemist, author) and Pierre Gagnaire (chef).
Chemical processes central to cooking include the Maillard reaction – a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid, a reducing sugar and heat.

==Home-cooking vs. factory cooking==

Although cooking has traditionally been a process carried out informally in a home or around a communal fire, cooking is also often carried out outside of personal quarters, for example at restaurants, or schools. Bakeries were one of the earliest forms of cooking outside the home, and bakeries in the past often offered the cooking of pots of food provided by their customers as an additional service. In the present day, factory food preparation has become common, with many "ready-to-eat" foods being prepared and cooked in factories and home cooks using a mixture of scratch made, and factory made foods together to make a meal.
"Home-cooking" may be associated with comfort food, and some commercially produced foods are presented through advertising or packaging as having been "home-cooked", regardless of their actual origin.
