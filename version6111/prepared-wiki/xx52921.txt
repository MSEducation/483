In video gaming, a boss is an enemy-based challenge (and a computer-controlled opponent in such a challenge).Burt, Andy (2008–4). "No More Heroes: The Killer Boss Guide", GamePro vol. 235, pg. 66. A fight with a boss character is commonly referred to as a boss battle or boss fight.Top 5 boss battles. MSNBC. Retrieved on 2008-03-25. Boss battles are generally seen at the climax of a particular section of the game, usually at the end of a stage or level, or guarding a specific objective, and the boss enemy is generally far stronger than the opponents the player has faced up to that point.Thompson, Clive.

==History==

The first interactive game to feature a boss was dnd, a 1975 role-playing video game for the PLATO system.Gary Whisenhunt, Ray Wood, Dirk Pellett, and Flint Pellett's DND. The Armory. Retrieved on 2008-04-08.dnd (The Game of Dungeons). Universal Videogame List. Retrieved on 2008-04-09. One of the earliest dungeon crawls, dnd implemented many of the core concepts behind Dungeons & Dragons. The objective of the game is to retrieve an "Orb" from the bottommost dungeon.The History of Computer Role-Playing Games Part 1: The Early Years (1980–1983). Gamasutra. Retrieved on 2008-04-07. The orb is kept in a treasure room guarded by a high-level enemy named the Gold Dragon. Only by defeating the Dragon can the player claim the orb, complete the game, and be eligible to appear on the high score list.
A 1980 example is the fixed shooter Phoenix, where the player ship must fight a giant mothership in the fifth and final level.Sterbakov, Hugh. (5 March 2008) The 47 Most Diabolical Video-Game Villains of All Time. Gamepro. Retrieved on 2008-04-28.

==Characteristics==

Bosses are usually significantly superior to regular enemies, and are usually found at the end of a level or area.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/id/2100116/ | title=Tough Love: Can a video game be too hard? | last=Thompson | first=Clive | work=Slate Magazine | accessdate=1 March 2009 | date=6 May 2004[/tpl] Most games also include a "final" boss, which is usually the main antagonist in the story, at the very end of the game. Some examples include Ganondorf from the The Legend of Zelda series, Bowser from the Mario franchise and Doctor Wily from Mega Man. While most games include a mixture of boss opponents and regular opponents, some games have only regular opponents and some games have only bosses – for example, Shadow of the Colossus has no enemies other than bosses.[tpl]cite web | last=Roper | first=Chris | year=2005 | title=Shadow of the Colossus Review | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/658/658991p1.html | work=IGN | accessdate=July 21 200[/tpl] In games such as Doom, a boss can reappear throughout the game as an uncommon enemy. In a similar vein, a relatively powerful enemy may be introduced via a boss battle, but later appear as an uncommon but strong enemy, after the player has had a chance to find more powerful weaponry or a weakness it may have.  An example of this is in Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia, where a boss reappears in later areas as a normal enemy, with the player even fighting two at once at one point.
Boss battles are typically seen as dramatic events. As such, they are usually characterized with unique music and cutscenes before and after the boss battle. Recurring bosses and final bosses may have their own specific theme music to distinguish them from other boss battles.
Some bosses require the player to defeat them in a certain way that may be unusual to normal attacks, such as requiring the player to use a certain weapon, such as in Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts, or hitting the boss in a certain area, termed a "weak point", such as in the Metroid series. Story-centered bosses of this type will sometimes require certain prerequisites to be performed during the fight for the player to succeed, such as a requirement that a partner must stay alive during the battle or sequence to be counted as a victory. The most common games that have these requirements are the games in the Grand Theft Auto franchise, which players can usually have a partner during a mission that they must protect; the final mission of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is an example of a boss battle that requires both a side character to remain alive and for additional actions to be taken in order to defeat him.
In some games, the boss returns after being defeated, sometimes in a new form with alternate attacks. This can repeat a certain number of times before the player faces their final and most powerful form. The Final Fantasy series is well known for this style of boss, as well as the Mega Man series of games.
As they can sustain a lot more damage than normal foes, bosses commonly have a health bar which is displayed either on or near them or in a specific location on the HUD, usually with their name or a portrait of them attached. In lieu of a health bar, some bosses, like those in the early Metroid games, change color, change attack patterns or, in the case of larger enemies, lose parts of their overall structure as they receive more and more damage. Although health bars or indicators were less common in the early days of video gaming, they are now found in many video game boss battles.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]

==Specific boss types==

===Miniboss===

A miniboss, also known as a middle boss, half-boss, sub-boss, or semi-boss, is a boss smaller and usually weaker than the main boss in the area or level. Some minibosses are simply stronger versions of regular enemies, like in the Kirby games. Some well known video game characters who usually take the role of a miniboss are Dark Link (The Legend of Zelda series), Vile (Mega Man X series) and Allen O'Neil (Metal Slug). The concept is parodied in the Disgaea series with the character Mid Boss. Minibosses are sometimes encountered later in the game as normal enemies.

===Superboss===

A superboss is a type of boss most commonly found in role-playing video games. They are considered optional enemies, though optional bosses are not all superbosses, and do not have to be defeated to complete the game. They are generally much more powerful than the bosses encountered as part of the main game's plot or quest, more difficult even than the final boss, and often the player is required to complete a sidequest or the entire game to fight the superboss. For example, in Final Fantasy VII, the player may choose to seek out and fight the Ruby and Emerald Weapons. Some superbosses will take the place of the final boss if certain requirements are met. This is common in fighting games, including Reptile in Mortal Kombat and Akuma in Super Street Fighter II Turbo. Some superbosses can also yield special items or skills that cannot be found any other way that can give a player a significant advantage during playthrough of the rest of the game, such as added experience or an extremely powerful weapon.

===Final boss===

The final boss is the opponent that is usually at the end of the game. They are usually the main antagonists of the game. Final bosses usually have their own special music tracks that are more dramatic than the music for the other bosses, and some final battles have the main theme of the game. The final boss is often fought during the final level, and after its defeat often is the end of the game. The levels they inhabit are usually heavily guarded by smaller enemies, making the route to the final boss difficult. It may also be that the final boss appears after the completion of additional levels, or after finding a few items and the hero gains a stronger form and fights with the true final boss. Although it is not common, some games make the final boss a character who is not the main antagonist, such as Clayface from Batman: Arkham City or Necron from Final Fantasy IX.
