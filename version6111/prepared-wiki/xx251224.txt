===Education===

He completed his education in Boston and fulfilled his apprenticeship there under Harvard-educated architect Abel C. Martin (1831–1879). Following his apprenticeship, he formed a partnership in Boston with George A. Moore as Moore & Starbuck Architects in 1873, followed by a partnership with Arthur H. Vinal as Starbuck & Vinal in 1877. Leaving Boston, he relocated to New Brunswick for a short while and from there he spent several years in Chicago, Illinois and was briefly in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. By 1894 he had established a practice in San Diego, California where he earned a reputation as a specialist in church architecture. 
After working on a church building in Fresno in 1902, he relocated to Oakland, California where he built a flourishing practice.  While practicing in Oakland, Starbuck formed a brief partnership with William Wilde which ended after a couple of years. After his well-publicized divorce he resettled in Fresno, California to rebuild his career and life in 1910. He retired at Decoto, now Union City, California.
