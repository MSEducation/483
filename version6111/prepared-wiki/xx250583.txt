The Togoland Congress (TCP) was a political party formed in 1951 to campaign for the unification of the Ewe people in British Togoland and French Togoland as a separate Ewe state. The party was defeated in the May 1956 UN plebiscite in British Togoland, which resulted in the unification of British Togoland and the Gold Coast. The Togoland Congress won two seats in the Gold Coast elections of July 1956, but did not survive for long afterwards.Daniel Miles McFarland, Historical Dictionary of Ghana, 1985, p. 173
