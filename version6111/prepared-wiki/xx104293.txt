[tpl]Nihongo|Toyotama-hime|豊玉姫|[/tpl] (Japanese for "luminous jewel"), better known as [tpl]Nihongo|Otohime|乙姫|[/tpl], is a goddess in Japanese mythology, and is featured in the Kojiki as well as Nihon Shoki. She is the beautiful daughter of Ryūjin, the god of the sea. She married the hunter Hoori and gave birth to a son, who in turn produced Emperor Jimmu, the first Emperor of Japan. After giving birth, she turned into a dragon or a wani and flew away.
The extinct crocodile genus Toyotamaphimeia was named after this deity, in direct reference to this myth.
