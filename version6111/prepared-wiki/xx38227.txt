A blood diamond (also called a conflict diamond, converted diamond, hot diamond, or war diamond) is a term used for a diamond mined in a war zone and sold to finance an insurgency, an invading army's war efforts, or a warlord's activity. The term is used to highlight the negative consequences of the diamond trade in certain areas, or to label an individual diamond as having come from such an area. Diamonds mined during the recent civil wars in Angola, Cote d'Ivoire, Sierra Leone, and other nations have been given the label.Conflict Diamonds.

Africa Renewal: January 2007.Global Summary 2008, Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. The term conflict minerals refers to analogous situations involving other gems. 

==History==

===Angola===

Angola, a colony of Portugal, gained independence on November 11, 1975. Although independent, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) fought in a civil war from 1974 to 2001. Between 1992 and 1998, in violation of the 1991 Bicesse Accords, UNITA sold diamonds, valued at US$3.72 billion,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=nr_8PuIMI9cC|title=The New South Africa|author=Guy Arnold|page=131|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2000|isbn=0-312-23517-8[/tpl] to finance its war with the government. The UN recognized the role that diamonds played in funding the UNITA rebels and in 1998 passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 1173 and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1176, banning the purchase of Blood diamonds from Angola.Conflict diamonds World Diamond Council website - DiamondFacts.org, accessed November 5, 2006[tpl]cite book|title=Security Council Resolution 1173|url=http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N98/166/52/PDF/N9816652.pdf|publisher=United Nations|year=1998[/tpl] Resolution 1173 was the first resolution by the UN which specifically mentioned diamonds in the context of funding a war. Reports estimated that as much as 20% of the total production in the 1980s was being sold for illegal purposes and 19% was specifically conflict in nature.The Kimberley Controls: How Effective? Partnership Africa Canada Website accessed January 7, 2007 By 1999, the illegal diamond trade was estimated by the World Diamond Council to have been reduced to 3.06% of the world's diamond production.Diamond Production Estimates - 1999 World Diamond Council website, accessed November 5, 2006Conflict diamonds World Diamond Council website - DiamondFacts.org, accessed November 5, 2006 The World Diamond Council reported that by 2004 this percentage had fallen to approximately 1%, where it has remained.http://www.venetiamajor.com.au/services/diamonds-gemstones/conflict-diamonds/ Venetia Major – "About conflict diamonds"
Despite the UN Resolution, UNITA was able to continue to sell or trade some diamonds in order to finance its war effort. The UN set out to find how this remaining illicit trade was being conducted and appointed Canadian ambassador Robert Fowler to investigate. In 2000, he produced the Fowler Report, which named those countries, organizations and individuals involved in the trade.  The report is credited with establishing the link between diamonds and third world conflicts,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=4kNErbPSzUUC|title=Diamonds and Conflict: Problems and Solutions|author=Arthur V. Levy|pages=5–6|publisher=N ova Publishers|year=2003 |isbn=1-59033-715-8[/tpl] and led directly to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1295, as well as the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.
From 1989 to 2003, Liberia was engaged in a civil war. In 2000, the UN accused Liberian president Charles G. Taylor of supporting the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) insurgency in neighboring Sierra Leone with weapons and training in exchange for diamonds. In 2001, the United Nations applied sanctions on the Liberian diamond trade. In August 2003, Taylor stepped down as president and, after being exiled to Nigeria, faced trial in The Hague. On July 21, 2006 he pleaded not guilty to crimes against humanity and war crimes, of which he was found guilty in April 2012.  On May 30, 2012, he began a 50-year sentence in a high security prison in the United Kingdom.
Around the time of the 1998 United States embassy bombings, al-Qaeda allegedly bought gems from Liberia as some of its other financial assets were frozen.Lucy Jones, Al-Qaeda 'traded blood diamonds', 20 February 2003, BBC News Online, Retrieved on 30 October 2007.
Having regained peace, Liberia is attempting to construct a legitimate diamond mining industry. The UN has lifted sanctions and Liberia is now a member of the Kimberley Process.[tpl]cite web|title=UN Security Council votes to lift ban on Liberian diamond exports|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/un-security-council-votes-to-lift-ban-on-liberian-diamond-exports-1.689632|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=11 December 2013[/tpl]

===Côte d'Ivoire===

Côte d'Ivoire  began to develop a fledgling diamond mining industry in the early 1990s. A coup overthrew the government in 1999, starting a civil war. The country became a route for exporting diamonds from Liberia and war-torn Sierra Leone.The Heart Of The Matter Sierra Leone, Diamonds & Human Security Partnership Africa Canada (PAC), accessed November 5, 2006 Foreign investment began to withdraw from Côte d'Ivoire. To curtail the illegal trade, the nation stopped all diamond mining and the UN Security Council banned all exports of diamonds from Côte d'Ivoire in December 2005. Despite UN sanctions, however, the illicit diamond trade still exists in Côte d'Ivoire. Rough diamonds are exported out of the country to neighboring states and international trading centers through the northern, Forces Nouvelles controlled section of the country, a group which is reported to be using these funds to re-arm.http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/861/en/campaigners_call_for_urgent_action_on_zimbabwe_blohttp://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/550/99/PDF/N0955099.pdf?OpenElement

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) has suffered numerous civil wars in the 1990s, but has become a member of the Kimberley Process and now exports about 8% of the world's diamonds. One of De Beers' most celebrated and priceless diamonds, the D-colour [tpl]convert|200|carat|g[/tpl] Millennium Star was discovered in the DRC and sold to De Beers during the height of the Civil War that took place in the early to mid-nineties.

===Republic of the Congo===

The Republic of the Congo (Congo-Brazzaville) was expelled from the Kimberley Process in 2004 because, despite having no official diamond mining industry, the country was exporting large quantities of diamonds, the origin of which it could not detail. It was also accused of falsifying certificates of origin. The Republic of the Congo was readmitted in 2007.[tpl]cite news|publisher=IPS|accessdate=2010-08-11|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40296|title=Blood Diamonds No Longer Congo-Brazzaville’s Best Friend|date=30 Nov 2007[/tpl]

===Zimbabwe===

Zimbabwe Diamonds are not considered conflict diamonds by the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.
In July 2010, the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme agreed that diamonds from the country's disputed Marange Diamond Fields could be sold on the international market,"Zimbabwe gets go-ahead to sell diamonds again", The Independent, July 17, 2010. after a report from the Scheme's monitor a month earlier described diamonds mined from the fields as conflict-free."Monitor to Clear Zimbabwe Diamonds", Wall Street Journal, May 28, 2010.

==Conflict diamond campaign==

Global Witness was one of the first organizations to pick up on the link between diamonds and conflicts in Africa in its 1998 report entitled "A Rough Trade".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/A_Rough_Trade.pdf|title=A Rough Trade: The Role of Companies and Governments in the Angolan Conflict|author=Dan Brown|publisher=Global Witness|accessdate=2011-04-11|date=1998-12-01[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=raO8jHBdDhYC|page=233|title=Glitter & Greed: The Secret World of the Diamond Empire|author=Janine P. Roberts|publisher=The Disinformation Company|year=2003|isbn=0-9713942-9-6[/tpl]  With the passing of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1173 in 1998, the United Nations too identified the conflict diamond issue as a funding for war.  The Fowler Report in 2000 detailed in depth how UNITA was financing its war activities, and in May 2000, led directly to the passing of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1295 and the diamond producing countries of southern Africa meeting in Kimberley, South Africa to plan a method by which the trade in conflict diamonds could be halted, and buyers of diamonds could be assured that their diamonds have not contributed to violence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/202/41606.html|title=Final Report of the UN Panel of Experts ("The "Fowler Report")|publisher=Global Policy Forum|date=2000-03-10|accessdate=2010-03-20|author=Robert Fowler|authorlink=Robert Fowler (diplomat)[/tpl][tpl]PDFlink|Resolution 1295 (2000)|publisher=UN Security Council|date=18 April 2000[/tpl] In this resolution the Security Council wrote:
 Welcomes the proposal that a meeting of experts be convened for the purpose of devising a system of controls to facilitate the implementation of the measures contained in Resolution 1173 (1998), including arrangements that would allow for increased transparency and accountability in the control of diamonds from their point of origin to the bourses, emphasizes that it is important that, in devising such controls, every effort be made to avoid inflicting collateral damage on the legitimate diamond trade, and welcomes the intention of the Republic of South Africa to host a relevant conference this year''http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/SC6988.doc.htm 

===Kimberley Process Certification Scheme===

On July 19, 2000, the World Diamond Congress adopted at Antwerp a resolution to strengthen the diamond industry's ability to block sales of conflict diamonds.Fact#6 World Diamond Council website - Diamond Facts.org, accessed December 8, 2006Diamond leaders in pact to ban 'conflict gems' funding African wars CNN.com, July 19, 2000. Accessed online December 9, 2006. Archived from http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/07/19/africa.diamonds.01.reut/index.html The resolution called for an international certification system on the export and import of diamonds, legislation in all countries to accept only officially sealed packages of diamonds, for countries to impose criminal charges on anyone trafficking in conflict diamonds, and instituted a ban on any individual found trading in conflict diamonds from the diamond bourses of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses. The Kimberley Process was led by the diamond-producing African countries themselves. Also in tourist countries like Dubai, the United Kingdom,[tpl]Clarify|date=January 2014[/tpl] before gemstone could be allowed through their airport to other countries, the Kimberley Certification must be presented by the gem's owner or obtained from a renowned attorney.Diamonds, Development, and Democracy by Nicky Oppenheimer
On January 17–18 of 2001, diamond industry figures convened and formed the new organization, the World Diamond Council. This new body set out to draft a new process, whereby all diamond rough could be certified as coming from a non-conflict source.Eli Izhakoff, Chairman's Report of the World Diamond Council 1st Annual Meeting World Diamond Council Website, accessed November 6, 2006
The KPCS was given approval by the UN on March 13, 2002,[tpl]PDFlink|UN Resolution 56/263 - The role of diamonds in fueling conflict: breaking the link between the illicit transaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts[/tpl] UN 96th plenary meeting, 13 March 2002, accessed online November 6, 2006 and in November, after two years of negotiation between governments, diamond producers, and Non-Government organizations, the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme was created.
The Kimberley Process attempted to curtail the flow of conflict diamonds, help stabilize fragile countries and support their development. As the Kimberley Process has made life harder for criminals, it has brought large volumes of diamonds onto the legal market that would not otherwise have made it there. This has increased the revenues of poor governments, and helped them to address their countries’ development challenges. For instance, some $125 million worth of diamonds were legally exported from Sierra Leone in 2006, compared to almost none at the end of the 1990s.

===Shortcomings and criticism===

The Kimberley Process has ultimately failed to stem the flow of blood diamonds, leading key proponents such as Global Witness to abandon the scheme.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16027011|title=NGO Global Witness leaves diamond vetting scheme|date=5 December 2011|accessdate=5 December 2011|publisher=BBC News[/tpl] In addition, there is no guarantee that diamonds with a Kimberley Process Certification are in fact conflict free.  This is due to the nature of the corrupt government officials in the leading diamond producing countries.  It is common for these officials to be bribed with $50 to $100 a day in exchange for paperwork declaring that blood diamonds are Kimberley Process Certified.[tpl]cite web|author=Ryan, E. Kieron|title=Blood Diamond Farce|date=11 August 2010|accessdate=12 December 2011|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig11/ryan-k1.1.1.html[/tpl]

===Transparency===

The Kimberley system attempted to increase governments' transparency by forcing them to keep records of the diamonds they are exporting and importing and how much they are worth. In theory, this would show governments their finances so that they can be held accountable for how much they are spending for the benefit of the country's population.  However non-compliance by countries such as Venezuela has led to the failure of accountability.
The company Materialytics has stated that it can trace the origin of virtually any diamond.Materialytics

The implementation of this legislation was key to the success of the KPCS, as the United States is the largest consumer of diamonds. The CDTA states: 'As the consumer of a majority of the world’s supply of diamonds, the United States has an obligation to help sever the link between diamonds and conflict and press for implementation of an effective solution.
The United States Department of State also maintains an office for a Special Adviser for Conflict Diamonds.  As of March 5, 2013, the position is held by Brad Brooks-Rubin.United States Department of State page on conflict diamonds USDoS

==Canadian policy==

During the 1990s diamond-rich areas were discovered in Northern Canada. Canada is one of the key players in the diamond industry. Partnership Africa Canada was created in 1986 to help with the crisis in Africa. This organization is also part of the Diamond Development Initiative. The Diamond Development Initiative helps improve and regulate the legal diamond industry.
The Kimberley Process was initiated in May 2000 by South Africa. Canada was a major supporter of passing this. Canada has passed several laws that help stop the trade of conflict diamonds. The laws deal with the export and import of rough diamonds, and also how they are transferred. In December 2002 the Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act was passed by the Canadian government. This act acts as a system that helps control the importing, exporting and transporting of rough diamonds through Canada. The Export and Import of Rough Diamonds also states that the Kimberley Process is the minimum requirement of certifying rough diamonds and a certificate is also required for all shipments of diamonds. This certificate is called the Canadian Certificate, it gives permission for an officer to seize any shipment of diamonds that does not meet the requirements of the Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act.Stop Blood Diamonds - Creating a Conflict Free Diamond World
The Government of the Northwest Territories of Canada (GNWT) also has a unique certification program. They offer a Government certificate on all diamonds that are mined, cut, and polished in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Canadian diamonds are tracked from mine, through the refining process to the retail jeweler with a unique diamond identification number (DIN) laser inscribed on the diamond's girdle. To obtain this certificate one must cut and polish the diamond in the NWT.
