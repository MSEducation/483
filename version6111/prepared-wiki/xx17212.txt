TEJO is the Tutmonda Esperantista Junulara Organizo, or World Esperanto Youth Organization.  TEJO was founded in 1938 under the name Tutmonda Junular-Organizo (World Youth Organization).  The current name was taken in 1952.  In 1956, TEJO became the youth section of the World Esperanto Association (Universala Esperanto-Asocio, UEA).  In 1971, the finances and administration of TEJO were fully integrated into the UEA.
TEJO is an organization for young speakers of Esperanto.  TEJO has individual members as well as member organizations.  There are 42+ member organizations plus about 13 national organizations that TEJO has contact with but which are not yet members.
TEJO organizes an International Youth Congress of Esperanto (Internacia Junulara Kongreso) each year in a different location around the world.  The IJK is an event of concerts, presentations, excursions, and recreation, usually of one week's duration and attended by a few hundred young people from many different countries.
TEJO also publishes the Pasporta Servo which is a hospitality network of Esperanto-speakers around the world willing to accept Esperanto-speaking guests.
TEJO publishes a magazine called Kontakto, aimed at beginners and young readers.
TEJO organizes several youth seminars each year.  These seminars bring together an international group of young people to discuss a current issue.  Past seminars have focused on human rights, globalization, language problems, and the Internet.  The seminars last for one week and often contain a training component so that participants not only take part in an international discussion, but leave having been taught new skills.
