Terry Edward Branstad (born November 17, 1946) is an American politician who is the 42nd and current governor of Iowa, having held the office since January 2011. Branstad was also the 39th governor of Iowa from 1983 to 1999, and President of Des Moines University from 2003 to 2009. He is a member of the Republican Party. Branstad is the longest-serving governor in Iowa history, and the second-longest serving governor in U.S. history (behind George Clinton of New York).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20091206/NEWS01/712069891|title=Branstad's stand questioned|publisher=Omaha.com|date=2009-12-06|accessdate=2010-08-29[/tpl]

On January 15, 2014, Branstad officially launched his re-election campaign for what would be an unprecedented sixth four-year term as Iowa governor, which would also make him the longest-serving governor in U.S. history (breaking the record held by George Clinton of New York, who served 21 years from 1777 to 1795, and from 1801 to 1804).

==Early life==

Born to a Norwegian-American Lutheran farming family in Leland, Iowa, Branstad received his undergraduate degree from the University of Iowa and his law degree from Drake University Law School.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=21728|title=Governor Terry E.

When elected governor at age 36, Branstad was the youngest chief executive in Iowa's history and when he left office, was Iowa's longest-serving governor. He served as Chair of the National Governors Association during 1989–1990, and was Chair of the Midwestern Governors Association. In 1997, he chaired the Education Commission of the States, the Republican Governors Association, and the Governors' Ethanol Coalition.
In 1991, Branstad ignored binding arbitration with employees of the State of Iowa's labor unions by vetoing a salary bill, was taken to court, and lost later in appeals in the state court system (AFSCME Iowa Council 61 et al., v. Branstad). In 1983, he vetoed a bill that would allow a state lottery.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xFcrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0dgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4172,3050692&dq=terry+branstad&hl=en |title=The Daily Reporter |publisher=News.google.com |date=1983-06-01 |accessdate=2013-07-19[/tpl] Iowa’s unemployment rate went from 8.5% when he took office to a record low 2.5% by the time he left office in 1999.
