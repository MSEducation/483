==History==

FM 1535 was designated in 1955. Its designation was officially changed to Urban Road 1535 (UR 1535) in 1995; however, as with other urban roads, TxDOT continues to sign the route with the farm-to-market route marker.[tpl]TxDOT|UR|1535[/tpl]
Historically, another FM 1535 was designated in Freestone County in 1949. This route was never constructed due to lack of funding and the designation was relinquished in 1955.
