[[Equilibrium unfolding]]

CATEGORIES: Protein structure, Equilibrium chemistry

In biochemistry, equilibrium unfolding is the process of unfolding a protein or RNA molecule by gradually changing its environment, such as by changing the temperature or pressure, adding chemical denaturants, or applying force as with an atomic force microscope tip.  Since equilibrium is maintained at all steps, the process is reversible (equilibrium folding).  Equilibrium unfolding is used to determine the conformational stability of the molecule.

==Theoretical background==

In its simplest form, equilibrium unfolding assumes that the molecule may belong to only two thermodynamic states, the folded state (typically denoted N for "native" state) and the unfolded state (typically denoted U).  This "all-or-none" model of protein folding was first proposed by Tim Anson in 1945,Anson ML, Protein Denaturation and the Properties of Protein Groups, Advances in Protein Chemistry, 2, 361-386 (1945) but is believed to hold only for small, single structural domains of proteins (Jackson, 1998); larger domains and multi-domain proteins often exhibit intermediate states.  As usual in statistical mechanics, these states correspond to ensembles of molecular conformations, not just one conformation.
The molecule may transition between the native and unfolded states according to a simple kinetic model 

==Chemical denaturation==

Protein stabilities are typically found to vary linearly with the denaturant concentration. A number of models have been proposed to explain this observation prominent among them being the denaturant binding model, solvent-exchange model (both by John SchellmanSchellmann, JA, The thermodynamics of solvent exchange, Biopolymers 34, 1015–1026 (1994)) and the Linear Extrapolation Model (LEM; by Nick PaceMyers JK, Pace CN, Scholtz JM, Denaturant m values and heat capacity changes: relation to changes in accessible surface areas of protein unfolding, Protein Sci. 4(10), 2138–2148 (1995)). All of the models assume that only two thermodynamic states are populated/de-populated upon denaturation. They could be extended to interpret more complicated reaction schemes.
The solvent exchange model (also called the ‘weak binding model’ or ‘selective solvation’) of Schellman invokes the idea of an equilibrium between the water molecules bound to independent sites on protein and the denaturant molecules in solution. It has the form:
Intuitively, the difference in the number of binding sites between the folded and unfolded states is directly proportional to the differences in the accessible surface area. This forms the basis for the LEM which assumes a simple linear dependence of stability on the denaturant concentration. The resulting slope of the plot of stability versus the denaturant concentration is called the m-value. In pure mathematical terms, m-value is the derivative of the change in stabilization free energy upon the addition of denaturant. However, a strong correlation between the accessible surface area (ASA) exposed upon unfolding, i.e. difference in the ASA between the unfolded and folded state of the studied protein (dASA), and the m-value has been documented by Pace and co-workers. In view of this observation, the m-values are typically interpreted as being proportional to the dASA. There is no physical basis for the LEM and it is purely empirical, though it is widely used in interpreting solvent-denaturation data. It has the general form:

The thermodynamic observables of denaturation can be described by the following equations:
