CATEGORIES: Farm to Market Roads in Texas

Farm to Market Road 1518 (FM 1518) is a farm-to-market road in the Greater San Antonio, Texas area.

==Route description==

The southern terminus of FM 1518 is at a junction with Loop 1604 in the southeastern Bexar County town of Adkins. It continues north through the town of St. Hedwig and crosses Interstate 10 at its exit 591. The route then passes to the east of Randolph Air Force Base before reaching FM 78 near Schertz, just west of the Guadalupe County line. Officially, FM 1518 is discontinuous here, and the route designation resumes at another point farther east along FM 78. Now in Guadalupe County, FM 1518 travels through the southwestern portion of Schertz and into Selma, where it ends at an intersection with Interstate 35's exit 174A.

==History==

FM 1518 was designated in 1949 as a short route that connected unincorporated southern Bexar county communities to SH 346 (which would ultimately become part of SH 16). The route was extended several times in the 1950s and 1960s, eventually creating a route of approximately [tpl]convert|66.5|mi|km[/tpl] that looped around the southwestern, southern, and eastern portions of the greater San Antonio area. The route would be greatly truncated in the 1970s due to the designation of Loop 1604; the mileage that remains reflects the current routing of FM 1518. In 1995, the northern portion of FM 1518, from Interstate 35 to FM 78 (now Urban Road 78), was officially redesignated as Urban Road 1518; however, as with other urban roads, TxDOT continues to sign the route with the farm-to-market route marker.
