Essential manifold a special type of closed manifolds. 
The notion was first introduced explicitly by Mikhail Gromov.Gromov, M.: Filling Riemannian manifolds, J. Diff. Geom. 18 (1983), 1–147.

==Definition==

A closed manifold M is called essential if its fundamental class M defines a nonzero element in the homology of its fundamental group π, or more precisely in the homology of the corresponding Eilenberg–MacLane space K(π, 1), via the natural homomorphism
where n is the dimension of M.  Here the fundamental class is taken in homology with integer coefficients if the manifold is orientable, and in coefficients modulo 2, otherwise.
