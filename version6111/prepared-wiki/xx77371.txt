The winning contestant would have the opportunity to work for Trump as the president of one of his companies for at least one year with an annual salary of $250,000.

Since its premier, the The Apprentice has spawned many licensed international versions as well as several unlicensed imitations.

The U.S. version of The Apprentice is the first version of reality game show franchise. It was broadcast on NBC and billed as "The Ultimate Job Interview". The show depicted a group of 15-18 businessmen and -women competing in an elimination  competition for a one-year, $250,000 job to run one of real estate magnate Donald Trump's companies. The position starts with an introductory one-year contract with a starting yearly salary of $250,000 USD.
The first season aired during winter and spring of 2004, executive produced by Mark Burnett, Jay Bienstock, and Donald Trump, who also hosts the show. The show led Trump to become known for his fateful catch phrase "You're Fired!". The theme song for the show is "For the Love of Money" by The O'Jays, and other themes and underscore are written by composers Mark T. Williams and Jeff Lippencott of Ah2 Music.

On 19 May 2007, Trump announced that he was "moving on from The Apprentice",[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl] effectively ending the series.

Each vehicle was driven by her friends and family, but viewers and cameramen were unaware of this. Some vehicles even came in more than once, but changed number registration plates, so as not to be caught by the cameras. This stunt was exposed while in the boardroom, Cullen fired her as a result. The story was in nearly all of the national newspapers in Ireland, and was the first major scandal to hit the show.
