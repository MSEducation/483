==Service history==

===World War II, 1945===

Following shakedown off Florida, LST-848 departed New Orleans on 24 February for the Pacific. After touching Balboa, Panama in the Canal Zone and West Coast ports, she proceeded to Hawaii, arriving at Kalua Harbor on 9 April. For the next six weeks, she engaged in amphibious exercises in the Hawaiian Islands before sailing to the Marianas. Arriving at Guam on 11 June, LST-848 shuttled troops and equipment from the Marianas to Okinawa for the duration of World War II.

===1945–1946===

When Japan accepted Allied peace terms, thereby ending the war, the landing ship was assigned to transport occupation forces in the Far East. Operating between the Philippines and Japan, LST-848 carried troops, vehicles, and cargo to support American forces in the Pacific. She departed Japan in early December and, after stays at Saipan and Pearl Harbor, arrived at San Francisco on 11 February 1946. Following operations along the West Coast, she sailed to Astoria, Oregon early in April and decommissioned at Vancouver, Washington on 10 August 1946. 
While berthed with the Columbia River group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, LST-848 was named USS ''Jerome County'' (LST-848) on 1 July 1955.

===1959–1965===

Jerome County recommissioned on 7 December 1959 with Lieutenant Kenneth H. Ruecker in command, then completed a shakedown along the Pacific coast. On 14 May 1960 she departed from San Pedro, California for mid-Pacific missile operations out of Midway Island. After five months in support of the U.S. missile program, she returned to San Diego late October. During 1961, Jerome County participated in amphibious training exercises along the California coast; then on 12 January 1962 she sailed for the mid-Pacific. Assigned to "Operation Dominic", she performed weather studies, charting, and communications during the U.S. nuclear tests of that year. The veteran LST returned to San Diego on 18 August to resume amphibious training exercises. From August 1962 until August 1965 Jerome County usually operated along the West Coast in addition to two mid-Pacific deployments.

===Vietnam War, 1965–1970===

Following the increased American commitment to assist the South Vietnamese government in their struggle against Communist aggression, Jerome County sailed for Southeast Asia on 10 August 1965. Arriving Chu Lai, South Vietnam on 11 September, she supported U.S. operations in Asia for the next three months. The landing ship returned San Diego on 22 December. Jerome County sailed again for the Far East on 3 March 1966 and arrived at Da Nang, South Vietnam, on 8 April. She unloaded her cargo and continued shuttling supplies, ammunition, and equipment in and out of the war zone until departing from Subic Bay on 1 September for home. She arrived at San Diego on 13 October and operated along the West Coast for the remainder of the year and into 1967 preparing for future action.

===Transfer to South Vietnam, and the Philippines===

In mid-1969 a planned fourth Southeast Asian deployment was cancelled, and Jerome County was instead prepared for transfer abroad. Decommissioned again on 1 April 1970 she was turned over, via lease, to the Republic of Vietnam Navy that same month.  She became the Republic of Vietnam Navy ship RVN ''Nha Trang'' (HQ-505) in April 1970.  Five years later, at the fall of South Vietnam, she escaped to the Philippines and subsequently became the Philippine Navy's RPS ''Agusan Del Sur'' (LT-54). The ship was decommissioned by 1986, and was discarded by the Philippine Navy about 1992. Her final fate is unknown.
