==Jayant Patel==

Queensland Health and the Bundaberg Base Hospital were involved in a scandal surrounding the employment of surgeon Jayant Patel.  The Queensland Medical Board approved his registration and he was then quickly promoted to Director of Surgery even though he lacked specific qualifications.[tpl]cite book |title=Improving Health Care Safety and Quality: Reluctant Regulators |last=Healy |first=Judith |year=2011 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |location=Farnham, England |isbn=0-7546-7644-7 |page=34 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=MIPURkuGhaMC |accessdate=22 January 2012[/tpl]
In March 2005, Rob Messenger raised concerns with Patel's medical practices in the Queensland Parliament after he was contacted by hospital nurse Toni Hoffman. Hoffman received the 2006 Australian of the Year Local Hero Award for her role as a whistleblower.
An inquiry into the matter known as the Morris Inquiry was started but was terminated on the grounds of perceived bias. A second inquiry known as the Davies Inquiry found that the Queensland Health district manager and the hospital's Director of Medical Services had mostly ignored more than 20 complaints regarding Patel.
On 1 July 2010, Patel was sentenced to seven years' jail after he was found guilty of three charges of manslaughter and one count of grievous bodily harm.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/totally-inadequate-verdict-split-on-patel-sentence-20100701-zph9.html?rand=1277963935139 |title='Totally inadequate': verdict split on Patel sentence |author=Amelia Bentley |accessdate=22 January 2012 |date=1 July 2010 |work=Brisbane Times |publisher=Fairfax Media [/tpl]

==2005 restructure==

Queensland Health was restructured toward the end of 2005 from 38 "health districts" to 20. There were a number consolidations particularly in the urban areas with the formation of the "Northside" and "Southside" Districts. Northside District included three major hospital facilities including The Prince Charles Hospital, Redcliffe and Caboolture Hospitals while Southside brought the Logan, Redlands, Beaudesert and Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Hospitals together. Somewhat strangely the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH) on the Northside, and the Princess Alexandra Hospital or regional centre on the Southside remained independent entities or Districts in their own right.
From September 2008 the 20 health service districts were further reduced to 15. According to a Queensland Health media release, nine districts remain unchanged. They are: Central Queensland, Townsville, Mackay, Cairns, Torres Strait, Cape York, Mount Isa, Central West and South West Districts.
Six new districts were created. They are:

==Health Quality and Complaints Commission==

In response to the Forster Review of Queensland Health Systems an independent Health Quality and Complaints Commission was established on 1 July 2006 to allow patients to lodge complaints about health matters.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hqcc.qld.gov.au/home/inner.aspx?pageID=53 |title=About us |publisher=Health Quality and Complaints Commission |accessdate=22 January 2012 [/tpl]
The Minister stated on 5 October 2005, that "The Forster Review found while Queensland Health's policy reflects contemporary best practice, its implementation has been poor and there is a lack of uniformity and quality in complaints systems across the State. People are unsure how to lodge complaints, staff don't feel confident in handling them and there is an inadequate system for informing Queensland Health about complaints or concerns." [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
The (full-time) Commissioner is Professor Michael Ward, a former Professor of Medicine at the University of Queensland.  There are also a number of part-time Assistant Commissioners.  
The Health Quality and Complaints Commission also has a role in the development and implementation of quality, safety and clinical practice standards throughout Queensland's public and private services and monitor best practice clinical governance and patient safety.
It was subject to review by an all-party Parliamentary Committee after its first full year of operation.

==Proposed Abolishment==

Former Premier Anna Bligh announced on 12 December 2011 that the department would be dismantled.  The decision was attributed to an "unacceptable culture", the theft of $16 million from the department and problems with the payroll system which has cost hundreds of millions of dollars.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/queensland-health-beyond-repair-to-be-broken-up-says-premier-anna-bligh/story-e6freoof-1226219984806 |title=Queensland Health beyond repair, to be broken up, says Premier Anna Bligh  |author=Steven Wardill & Koren Helbig |accessdate=22 January 2012 |date=12 December 2011 |newspaper=The Courier Mail |publisher=News Queensland [/tpl] The department was due to cease operations on 1 July 2012.
