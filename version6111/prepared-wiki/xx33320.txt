Sheffield [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Sheffield.ogg|ˈ|ʃ|ɛ|f|iː|l|d[/tpl] is a city and metropolitan borough in South Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, its name derives from the River Sheaf, which runs through the city. With some of its southern suburbs annexed from Derbyshire, the city has grown from its largely industrial roots to encompass a wider economic base. The population of the City of Sheffield is [tpl]English district population|GSS=E08000019[/tpl] ([tpl]English statistics year[/tpl])The mid-[tpl]English statistics year[/tpl] population for the whole City of Sheffield was [tpl]English district population|GSS=E08000019[/tpl] according to the Office for National Statistics ([tpl]English district population citation[/tpl]), though some population figures, like those given at List of English cities by population, use just the urban core of the city and are therefore lower. and it is one of the eight largest regional English cities that make up the Core Cities Group. Sheffield is the third largest English district by population.
During the 19th century, Sheffield gained an international reputation for steel production. Many innovations were developed locally, including crucible and stainless steel, fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population during the Industrial Revolution. Sheffield received its municipal charter in 1843, becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893. International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in traditional local industries during the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area.
The 21st century has seen extensive redevelopment in Sheffield along with other British cities. Sheffield's gross value added (GVA) has increased by 60% since 1997, standing at £9.2 billion in 2007. The economy has experienced steady growth averaging around 5% annually, greater than that of the broader region of Yorkshire and the Humber.
The city is located within the valleys of the River Don and its four tributaries, the Loxley, the Porter Brook, the Rivelin, and the Sheaf. 61% of Sheffield's entire area is green space, and a third of the city lies within the Peak District national park. There are more than 250 parks, woodlands and gardens in the city, and an estimated 2 million trees, giving Sheffield the highest ratio of trees to people of any city in Europe.

==History==

The area now occupied by the City of Sheffield has been inhabited since at least the late Upper Palaeolithic period, about 12,800 years ago.[tpl]cite journal |last=Pike |first=Alistair W.G. |last2=Gilmour|first2= Mabs|last3= Pettitt|first3= Paul|last4= Jacobid|first4= Roger|last5=Ripoll|first5= Sergio|last6= Bahn|first6= Paul|last7= Muñoz|first7= Francisco |year=2005 |title=Verification of the age of the Palaeolithic cave art at Creswell Crags, UK |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |volume=32 |issue=11 |pages=1649–1655 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2005.05.002[/tpl] The earliest evidence of human occupation in the Sheffield area was found at Creswell Crags to the east of the city. In the Iron Age the area became the southernmost territory of the Pennine tribe called the Brigantes. It is this tribe who are thought to have constructed several hill forts in and around Sheffield. Following the departure of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been the southern part of the Celtic kingdom of Elmet, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of Mercia.[tpl]cite journal |last=Cox |first=Tony |year=2003 |title=The Ancient Kingdom of Elmet |journal=The Barwicker |volume=39 |page=43 |url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesBritain/BritishElmet.htm|accessdate=17 July 2010[/tpl] Gradually, Anglian settlers pushed west from the kingdom of Deira. A Celtic presence within the Sheffield area is evidenced by two settlements called Wales and Waleswood close to Sheffield.The word Wales derives from the Germanic word Walha, and was originally used by the Anglo-Saxons to refer to the native Britons. In reference to the villages of Wales and Waleswood, S.O. Addy, in his A Glossary of Words Used in the Neighbourhood of Sheffield, p. 274, states "The Anglo-Saxon invaders or settlers called the old inhabitants or aborigines of this country wealas, or foreigners."

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that King Eanred of Northumbria submitted to King Egbert of Wessex at the hamlet of Dore (now a suburb of Sheffield) in 829,In an entry dated 827, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states "Egbert led an army against the Northumbrians as far as Dore, where they met him, and offered terms of obedience and subjection, on the acceptance of which they returned home" (transcription). Most sources (for example Vickers, Old Sheffield Town) state that the date given in the chronicle is incorrect, and that 829 is the more likely date for this event. a key event in the unification of the kingdom of England under the House of Wessex.[tpl]cite book|last=Fry|first=Plantagenet Somerset|title=The Kings & Queens of England & Scotland|year=1990|publisher=Grove Atlantic Press|isbn=0-8021-1386-9|authorlink=Plantagenet Somerset Fry|page=11[/tpl] After the Norman conquest, Sheffield Castle was built to protect the local settlements, and a small town developed that is the nucleus of the modern city.[tpl]cite book|last=Hunter|first=Joseph|title=Hallamshire: The History and Topography of the Parish of Sheffield in the County of York|publisher=Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mayor, and Jones|year=1819|pages=24–29|chapter=Sheffield under De Busli and De Lovetot[/tpl]
By 1296, a market had been established at what is now known as Castle Square,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/business-economy/markets/history-and-visits/history-of-the-markets-in-sheffield/markets-history---1700s-and-before |title=Markets history – 1700s and before |accessdate=7 October 2008 |publisher=Sheffield City Council |date=30 April 2008 [/tpl] and Sheffield subsequently grew into a small market town. In the 14th century, Sheffield was already noted for the production of knives, as mentioned in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales,Geoffrey Chaucer in The Reeve's Tale from his book The Canterbury Tales wrote: "Ther was no man, for peril, dorste hym touche. A Sheffeld thwitel baar he in his hose. Round was his face, and camus was his nose" and by the early 1600s it had become the main centre of cutlery manufacture in England outside of London, overseen by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire.[tpl]cite book|last=Hey|first=David|title=Mesters to Masters: a History of the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire|editor-first=Clyde |editor-last=Binfield |editor2-first=David |editor2-last=Hey|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|pages=12–25|chapter=The Establishment of the Cutlers Company|isbn=0-19-828997-9[/tpl] From 1570 to 1584, Mary, Queen of Scots, was imprisoned in Sheffield Castle and Sheffield Manor.[tpl]cite book|last=Leader|first=John Daniel|title=Mary queen of Scots in captivity: a narrative of events from January 1569, to December, 1584, whilst George Earl of Shrewsbury was the guardian of the Scottish Queen|publisher=Leader & Sons|year=1880|oclc=57701910|isbn=1-177-40664-0[/tpl]

The resulting poor conditions culminated in a cholera epidemic that killed 402 people in 1832. The population of the town grew rapidly throughout the 19th century; increasing from 60,095 in 1801 to 451,195 by 1901. The town was incorporated as a borough in 1842 and was granted a city charter in 1893.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/roles-who/lord-mayor/history-of-lord-mayor.html |title=History of the Lord Mayor |accessdate=13 October 2013 |publisher=Sheffield City Council|date=17 December 2012[/tpl] The influx of people also led to demand for better water supplies, and a number of new reservoirs were constructed on the outskirts of the town. The collapse of the dam wall of one of these reservoirs in 1864 resulted in the Great Sheffield Flood, which killed 270 people and devastated large parts of the town.[tpl]cite book|last=Harrison|first=Samuel|title=A complete history of the great flood at Sheffield on March 11 & 12, 1864|publisher=S.

A recession in the 1930s was halted by increasing international tensions as the Second World War loomed; Sheffield's steel factories were set to work manufacturing weapons and ammunition for the war effort. As a result, the city became a target for bombing raids, the heaviest of which occurred on the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940, now known as the Sheffield Blitz. More than 660 lives were lost and many buildings destroyed.[tpl]cite book|last=Walton|first=Mary|last2=Lamb|first2= Joseph Percy|title=Raiders over Sheffield: the story of the air raids of 12th & 15th December 1940|publisher=Sheffield City Libraries|year=1980|isbn=0-900660-55-4|oclc=7273086[/tpl]
In the 1950s and 1960s, many of the city's slums were demolished, and replaced with housing schemes such as the Park Hill flats. Large parts of the city centre were also cleared to make way for a new system of roads. Increased automation and competition from abroad resulted in the closure of many steel mills (see steel crisis). The 1980s saw the worst of this run-down of Sheffield's industries, along with those of many other areas of the UK.[tpl]cite book|last=Taylor|first=Ian R.|last2=Evans|first2= Karen |last3= Fraser|first3= Penny|title=A tale of two cities: global change, local feeling and everyday life in the North of England : a study in Manchester and Sheffield|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1996|pages=63–72|chapter=The catastrophic decline of Sheffield's industrial district|isbn=0-415-13829-9[/tpl] The building of the Meadowhall shopping centre on the site of a former steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating much needed jobs but hastening the decline of the city centre. Attempts to regenerate the city were kick-started when the city hosted the 1991 World Student Games, which saw the construction of new sporting facilities such as the Sheffield Arena, Don Valley Stadium, and the Ponds Forge complex.
Sheffield is changing rapidly as new projects regenerate some of the more run-down parts of the city. One such, the Heart of the City Project, has initiated a number of public works in the city centre: the Peace Gardens were renovated in 1998, the Millennium Galleries opened in April 2001, the Winter Gardens were opened in May 2003, and a public space to link these two areas, the Millennium Square, was opened in May 2006. Additional developments included the remodelling of Sheaf Square, in front of the recently refurbished railway station. The new square contains The Cutting Edge, a sculpture designed by Si Applied Ltd[tpl]cite web |url=http://public-art.shu.ac.uk/sheffield/kni420.html |title=SI (Chris Knight, Keith Tyssen and Brett Payne) with Keiko Mukaide 'Cutting Edge', 2006 |accessdate=15 March 2007 |work=Public Art Research Archive |publisher=Sheffield Hallam University [/tpl] and made from Sheffield steel.
Sheffield was particularly hard-hit during the 2007 United Kingdom floods and the 2010 Big Freeze. Many landmark buildings such as Meadowhall and the Sheffield Wednesday grounds flooded due to being close to nearby rivers that flow through the city.

==Government==

[tpl]Main|Sheffield City Council[/tpl] [tpl]See also|Sheffield local elections[/tpl]
Sheffield is governed at the local level by Sheffield City Council. It consists of 84 councillors elected to represent 28 wards—three councillors per ward. It is currently controlled by the Labour Party. Following the 2012 local elections, the distribution of council seats is Labour 60, Liberal Democrats 22, the Green Party two. The city also has a Lord Mayor; though now simply a ceremonial position, in the past the office carried considerable authority, with executive powers over the finances and affairs of the city council. As of 2013, the Lord Mayor is Vickie Priestley.
For much of its history the council was controlled by the Labour Party, and was noted for its leftist sympathies; during the 1980s, when Sheffield City Council was led by David Blunkett, the area gained the epithet the "Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire".[tpl]cite book|last=Price|first=David|title=Sheffield Troublemakers: Rebels and Radicals in Sheffield History|publisher=Phillimore & Co. Ltd|year=2008|pages=149–160|chapter=Blunkett and the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire|isbn=978-1-86077-569-7[/tpl] However, the Liberal Democrats controlled the Council between 1999 and 2001 and took control again from 2008 to 2011. The council is currently Labour controlled.
The majority of council-owned facilities are operated by independent charitable trusts. Sheffield International Venues runs many of the city's sporting and leisure facilities, including Sheffield Arena, Don Valley Stadium (now demolished and English Institute of Sport – Sheffield. Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust and the Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust take care of galleries and museums owned by the council.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/coresite/html/background.asp|title=Introducing Museums Sheffield|work=Museums Sheffield website|publisher=Sheffield Galleries & Museums Trust|accessdate=21 July 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090621014917/http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/coresite/html/background.asp |archivedate=21 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.simt.co.uk/about|title=About SIMT|work=Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust website|publisher=Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust|accessdate=15 July 2010[/tpl]

==Geography==

Sheffield is located at [tpl]Coord|53|23|N|1|28|W|type:city_region:GB[/tpl]. It lies directly beside Rotherham, from which it is separated largely by the M1 motorway. Although Barnsley Metropolitan Borough also borders Sheffield to the north, the town itself is a few miles further away. The southern and western borders of the city are shared with Derbyshire; in the first half of the 20th century Sheffield extended its borders south into Derbyshire, annexing a number of villages,[tpl]cite web |url=http://mdfs.net/Docs/Sheffield/Borders/ |title=The borders of Sheffield from 1843 to 1994 |accessdate=26 December 2005 |last=Harston |first=Jonathan G. |year=2005 |publisher=MDFS [/tpl] including Totley, Dore, and the area now known as Mosborough Townships. Directly to the west of the city are the Peak District National Park and the Pennine hill range.

Sheffield is a geographically diverse city.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.map21ltd.com/COSTC11/sheffield-case.htm  |title=Greenstructure and Urban Planning – Case Study – Sheffield, UK |accessdate=17 July 2010 |work=Greenstructures and Urban Planning |publisher=European Cooperation in the field of Scientific and Technical Research |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071229084359/http://www.map21ltd.com/COSTC11/sheffield-case.htm |archivedate = 29 December 2007[/tpl] The city nestles in a natural amphitheatre created by several hillsIt is often stated that Sheffield is built on seven hills (for an example, see George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier). However, a study by J.G.Harston found there to be eight. and the confluence of five rivers: Don, Sheaf, Rivelin, Loxley and Porter. As such, much of the city is built on hillsides with views into the city centre or out to the countryside. The city's lowest point is just [tpl]convert|29|m|ft|0[/tpl] above sea level near Blackburn Meadows, while some parts of the city are at over [tpl]convert|500|m|ft|0[/tpl]; the highest point being [tpl]convert|548|m|ft|0[/tpl] at High Stones, near Margery Hill. However, 79% of the housing in the city is between [tpl]convert|100|and|200|m|ft[/tpl] above sea level.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.map21ltd.com/COSTC11/arb-sheff.htm |title=Sheffield Metropolitan District – Major Greenspace and other Land Use Statistics|last=Beer|first=A.

Sheffield also has a very wide variety of habitat, comparing favourably with any city in the United Kingdom: urban, parkland and woodland, agricultural and arable land, moors, meadows and freshwater-based habitats. There are six areas within the city that are designated as sites of special scientific interest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/out--about/parks-woodlands--countryside/trees--woodlands/about-the-trees--woodlands-section|title=About Us – Trees & Woodlands Section|publisher=Sheffield City Council|accessdate=21 July 2009[/tpl]
The present city boundaries were set in 1974 (with slight modification in 1994), when the former county borough of Sheffield merged with Stocksbridge Urban District and two parishes from the Wortley Rural District. This area includes a significant part of the countryside surrounding the main urban region. Roughly a third of Sheffield lies in the Peak District National Park.

===Climate===

Like the rest of the United Kingdom, the climate in Sheffield is generally temperate. The Pennines to the west of the city can create a cool, gloomy and wet environment, but they also provide shelter from the prevailing westerly winds, casting a "rain shadow" across the area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/ne/|title=North East England: climate |publisher=Met Office|accessdate=18 July 2010[/tpl] Between 1971 and 2000 Sheffield averaged [tpl]convert|824.7|mm|in[/tpl] of rain per year; December was the wettest month with [tpl]convert|91.9|mm|in[/tpl] and July the driest with [tpl]convert|51.0|mm|in[/tpl].

More recently, a [tpl]convert|-4.4|C|F[/tpl] was recorded as a daytime maximum at Weston Park, on 20 December 2010.(from the Weston Park Weather Station statistics, which also can be viewed at Sheffield Central Library.)
On average, through the winter months (December–March), there are 67 days during which ground frost occurs.

The Weston Park Weather station, established in 1882, is one of the longest running weather stations in Great Britain. It has recorded weather for more than 125 years, and a 2008 report showed that the climate of Sheffield is warming faster than it has at any time during this period, with 1990 and 2006 being the hottest years on record.[tpl]cite web|last=Boon|first=Gaynor|title=Whatever the Weather Changing Climate Changing Cultures|url=http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/PDFs/climate_change.pdf|publisher=Museums Sheffield|accessdate=13 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] In collaboration with the Stockholm Environment Institute, Sheffield developed a carbon footprint (based on 2004/05 consumption figures) of 5,798,361 tonnes per year. This compares to the UK's total carbon footprint of 698,568,010 tonnes per year. The factors with the greatest impact are housing (34%), transport (25%), consumer (11%), private services (9%), public services (8%), food (8%), and capital investment (5%).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/environment/climate-change|title=Sheffield's Carbon Footprint|publisher=Sheffield City Council|accessdate=16 September 2009[/tpl] Sheffield City Council has signed up to the 10:10 campaign.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sheffieldismyplanet.co.uk/|title=Sheffield Is My Planet|work=Sheffield Is My Planet| publisher=Sheffield City Council|accessdate=7 July 2010[/tpl]

===Subdivisions===

Sheffield is made up of many suburbs and neighbourhoods, many of which developed from villages or hamlets that were absorbed into Sheffield as the city grew. These historical areas are largely ignored by the modern administrative and political divisions of the city; instead it is divided into 28 electoral wards, with each ward generally covering 4–6 areas.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/elections/ward-boundaries |title=Sheffield's Ward Boundaries |accessdate=29 December 2005 |publisher=Sheffield City Council[/tpl] These electoral wards are grouped into six parliamentary constituencies.

The population of Sheffield peaked in 1951 at 577,050, and has since declined steadily. However, the mid-2007 population estimate was 530,300—representing an increase of about 17,000 residents since 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=15106|title=Population estimates for UK, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland|work=National Statistics Online|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=22 July 2009[/tpl]
Although a city, Sheffield is informally known as "the largest village in England", because of a combination of topographical isolation and demographic stability. It is relatively geographically isolated, being cut off from other places by a ring of hills. (Local folklore insists that, like Rome, Sheffield was built "on seven hills".) The land surrounding Sheffield was unsuitable for industrial use, and now includes several protected green belt areas. These topographical factors have served to restrict urban spread, resulting in a relatively stable population size and a low degree of mobility.
In 1956, Hunt stated that "Modern Sheffield, a flourishing industrial city with over half a million inhabitants and a world-wide reputation, still retains many of the essential characteristics of the small market town of about five thousand people from which it has grown in the space of two and a half centuries." A 1970 survey has supported Hunt's characterisation, with more Sheffield residents able to identify a "home area" within the city than people from other large county boroughs were, and greatly more Sheffield residents expressing an unwillingness to leave their city than people from other large county boroughs did. This latter unwillingness was noted, by the survey analysis, as far more characteristic of the response that would be obtained by surveying a "a small urban or rural authority rather than a large county borough".

Sheffield has an international reputation for metallurgy and steel-making.There are numerous sources showing the international reputation of Sheffield for metallurgy, and in particular steel and cutlery manufacture. Some examples are: the Oxford English Dictionary, which begins its entry for Sheffield, "The name of a manufacturing city of Yorkshire, famous for cutlery"; and the Encyclopædia Britannica, which in its entry for "Sheffield" states that by 1830 Sheffield had earned "recognition as the world centre of high-grade steel manufacture". David Hey in the preface to his 1997 book Mesters to Masters: A History of the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire. (Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-828997-9) states "It (Sheffield) was known for its cutlery wares long before the incorporation of the Cutlers' Company in 1624, and long before it acquired an international reputation as the steel capital of the world." Many innovations in these fields have been made in Sheffield, for example Benjamin Huntsman discovered the crucible technique in the 1740s at his workshop in Handsworth.[tpl]cite journal|last=Mezenin|first=N.|year=1972|title=Huntsman|journal=Metallurgist|publisher=Springer|volume=16|issue=7|pages=510–512|doi=10.1007/BF00731738[/tpl] This process was rendered obsolete in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's invention of the Bessemer converter. Thomas Boulsover invented Sheffield Plate (silver-plated copper) in the early 18th century. Stainless steel was invented by Harry Brearley in 1912,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tilthammer.com/bio/brear.html |title=Harry Brearley 1871–1948 |accessdate=30 December 2006 |work=Tilt Hammer [/tpl] and the work of F.

===Local travel===

The A57 and A61 roads are the major trunk roads through Sheffield. These run east–west and north–south respectively, crossing in the city centre, from where the other major roads generally radiate spoke-like. An inner ring road, mostly constructed in the 1970s and extended in 2007 to form a complete ring,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/?pgid=87823&fs=b|title=Project History – The Inner Relief Road|last=Brown|first=Deborah|year=2008|publisher=Sheffield City Council|accessdate=19 July 2009[/tpl] allows traffic to avoid the city centre, and an outer ring road runs to the east, south east and north, nearer the edge of the city, but does not serve the western side of Sheffield.
