The Hongwu Emperor (Chinese: [tpl]lang|zh|[tpl]linktext|洪|武|帝[/tpl][/tpl], p Hóngwǔdì; 21 October 1368 – 24 June 1398), also known by his given name Zhu Yuanzhang ([tpl]lang|zh|朱元璋[/tpl]) and his temple name Ming Taizu ([tpl]lang|zh|明太祖[/tpl], lit. "Great Ancestor of the Ming"), was the founder and first emperor of the Ming Dynasty of China. His era name Hongwu means "vastly martial."
In the middle of the 14th century, with famine, plagues, and peasant revolts sweeping across China, Zhu rose to command the force that conquered China and ended the Yuan Dynasty, forcing the Mongols to retreat to the central Asian steppe. Following his seizure of the Yuan capital Khanbaliq (modern Beijing), Zhu claimed the Mandate of Heaven and established the Ming Dynasty in 1368. Trusting only in his family, he made his many sons powerful feudal princes along the northern marshes and the Yangtze valley. Having outlived his first successor, the Hongwu Emperor enthroned his grandson via a series of instructions; this ended in failure when the Jianwen Emperor's attempt to unseat his uncles led to the Yongle Emperor's successful rebellion.Chan Hok-lam.

Most of the historical sites related to Zhu Yuanzhang are located in Nanjing, the original capital of his dynasty.

==Early life==

Zhu Yuanzhang was born into a poor peasant family in a village in Zhongli, present day Fengyang, Anhui Province.Dreyer, 22–23. His father was Zhu Shizhen (朱世珍, original name Zhu Wusi 朱五四) and his mother was Chen Erniang. He had seven older siblings, several of whom were "given away" by his parents, as they did not have enough food to support the family.History of Ming, :zh:s:明史/卷1[tpl]![/tpl]vol. 1 When he was 16, the Yellow River broke its banks and flooded the lands where his family lived. Subsequently, a plague killed his family, except one brother.
Destitute, Zhu Yuanzhang accepted a suggestion to take up a pledge made by his late father and became a novice monk at the Huangjue Temple,Mote, J.F. Imperial China 900–1800 Harvard University Press (5 December 2003) ISBN 978-0-674-01212-7 pp.543–545 Google Books Search a local Buddhist monastery. He did not remain there for long as the monastery ran short of funds and he was forced to leave.
For the next few years, Zhu Yuanzhang led the life of a wandering beggar and personally experienced and saw the hardships of the common people.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] After about three years, he returned to the monastery and stayed there until he was around 24 years old. He learned to read and write during the time he spent with the Buddhist monks.

==Establishing a dynasty==

The monastery where Zhu Yuanzhang lived was eventually destroyed by an army that was suppressing a local rebellion. In 1352, Zhu joined one of the many insurgent forces that had risen in rebellion against the Mongol-ruled Yuan Dynasty. Zhu rose rapidly through the ranks and became a commander. His rebel force later joined the Red Turbans, a millenarian sect related to the White Lotus Society, and one that followed cultural and religious traditions of Buddhism, Zoroastrianism and other religions. Widely seen as a defender of Confucianism and neo-Confucianism among the predominant Han Chinese population in China, Zhu emerged as a leader of the rebels that were struggling to overthrow the Yuan Dynasty. The Red Turbans and Zhu both conquered the whole of China trying to reunite it like it was before the Mongols attacked.
In 1356, Zhu Yuanzhang's army conquered Nanjing, which became his base of operations and the official capital of the Ming Dynasty during his reign. Zhu's government in Nanjing became famous for good governance and the city attracted vast numbers of people fleeing from other more lawless regions. It is estimated that Nanjing's population increased by 10 times over the next 10 years.Ebrey, "Cambridge Illustrated History of China", pg. 191 In the meantime, the Yuan government had been weakened by internal factions fighting for control and it made little effort to retake the Yangtze River valley. By 1358, central and southern China had fallen into the hands of different rebel groups. During that time, the Red Turbans also split up. Zhu became the leader of a smaller faction (called "Ming" around 1360) while the larger faction, under Chen Youliang, controlled the center of the Yangtze River valley.
Zhu was able to attract many talents into his service. One of them was Zhu Sheng (朱升), who advised Zhu: "Build high walls, stock up rations, and don't be too quick to call yourself a king." Another, Jiao Yu, was an artillery officer who later compiled a military treatise outlining the various types of gunpowder weapons. Another one, Liu Ji, became one of Zhu's key advisors, and edited the military-technology treatise titled Huolongjing in later years.
Starting from 1360, Zhu and Chen Youliang fought a protracted war for supremacy over the former Red Turban territory. The pivotal moment in the war was the Battle of Lake Poyang in 1363, one of the largest naval battles in history. The battle lasted three days and ended with the defeat and retreat of Chen's larger sized navy. Chen died a month later in battle. Zhu did not participate personally in any battles after that and remained in Nanjing, where he directed his generals to go on campaigns.
In 1367, Zhu's forces defeated Zhang Shicheng's Kingdom of Dazhou, which was centered in Suzhou and had previously included most of the Yangtze River Delta and the Song Dynasty's capital city of Hangzhou.Edward L. Farmer, Zhu Yuanzhang and Early Ming Legislation: The Reordering of Chinese Society Following the Era of Mongol Rule. BRILL, 1995. ISBN 90-04-10391-0, ISBN 978-90-04-10391-7. On Google Books.

This victory granted Zhu's Ming government authority over the lands north and south of the Yangtze River. The other major warlords surrendered to Zhu and on 20 January 1368, Zhu proclaimed himself Emperor of the Ming Dynasty in Nanjing and adopted "Hongwu" as his era. His dynasty's mission was to drive away the Mongols and restore Han Chinese rule in China.
In 1368, Ming armies headed north to attack territories that were still under the Yuan Dynasty's rule. The Mongols gave up their capital city of Khanbaliq (Dadu, present-day Beijing) and the rest of northern China in September 1368 and retreated to Mongolia. The Ming army captured the last Yuan-controlled province of Yunnan in 1381 and China was unified under the Ming Dynasty's rule.

==Reign==

===Becoming emperor===

Zhu proclaimed himself Emperor of China in 1368. His capital city remained in Nanjing and his era was declared "Hongwu".
Under the Hongwu Emperor's rule, the Mongol bureaucrats who dominated the government in the Yuan Dynasty's time were replaced by Han Chinese officials. The Hongwu Emperor revamped the traditional Confucian examination system, from which potential state officials were selected from, based on merit and their knowledge of literature and philosophy. Candidates for positions in the civil service and the officers corps of the military were required to pass the imperial examination, as required by the Classics. The Confucian scholar-bureaucrats, previously marginalized during the Yuan Dynasty, were reinstated to their predominant roles in the government.
Mongol related things, including garments and names, were discontinued from use and boycotted. There were also attacks on palaces and administrative buildings previously used by the Yuan rulers.Stearns, Peter N., et al. World Civilizations: The Global Experience. AP Edition DBQ Update. New York: Pearson Education, Inc., 2006. 508.

===Land reform===

As the Hongwu Emperor came from a peasant family, he was aware of how peasants used to suffer under the oppression of the scholar-bureaucrats and the wealthy. Many of the latter, relying on their connections with government officials, encroached unscrupulously on peasants' lands and bribed the officials to transfer the burden of taxation to the poor. To prevent such abuse, the Hongwu Emperor instituted two systems: Yellow Records and Fish Scale Records. These systems served both to secure the government's income from land taxes and to affirm that peasants would not lose their lands.
However, the reforms did not eliminate the threat of the bureaucrats to peasants. Instead, the expansion of the bureaucrats and their growing prestige translated into more wealth and tax exemption for those in the government service. The bureaucrats gained new privileges and some became illegal money-lenders and managers of gambling rings. Using their power, the bureaucrats expanded their estates at the expense of peasants' lands through outright purchase of those lands and foreclosure on their mortgages whenever they wanted the lands. The peasants often became either tenants or workers, or sought employment elsewhere.Stearns, Peter N., et al. World Civilizations: The Global Experience. AP Edition DBQ Update. New York: Pearson Education, Inc., 2006. 511.
Since the beginning of the Ming government in 1357, great care was taken by the Hongwu Emperor to distribute land to peasants. One way was through forced migration to less dense areas.祖先记忆、家园象征与族群历史http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_4de7803801008ogq.html Some of those people were tied to a pagoda tree in Hongdong (洪洞大槐樹) and moved.山西社科网 Public works projects, such as the construction of irrigation systems and dikes, were undertaken in an attempt to help farmers. In addition, the Hongwu Emperor also reduced the demands for forced labour on the peasantry. In 1370, the Hongwu Emperor ordered that some lands in Hunan and Anhui should be given to young farmers who had reached adulthood. The order was intended to prevent landlords from seizing the land, as it also decreed that the titles to the lands were not transferable. During the middle part of his reign, the Hongwu Emperor passed an edict, stating that those who brought fallow land under cultivation could keep it as their property without being taxed. The policy was well received by the people and in 1393, cultivated land rose to 8,804,623 ching and 68 mou, something not achieved during any other Chinese dynasty.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
The Hongwu Emperor instigated the planting of 50 million trees in the vicinity of Nanjing, reconstructing canals, irrigation, and transporting southern people to the north for repopulation. He successfully managed to increase the population from 60 to 100 million.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=K9lsAuXqF3wC&pg=PA519|title=Exploring the Middle Ages|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation, Steven Maddocks, Dale Anderson, Jane Bingham, Peter Chrisp, Christopher Gavett|year=2006|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=0-7614-7613-X|page=519|accessdate=28 November 2010[/tpl]

===Military===

The Hongwu Emperor realized that the Mongols still posed a threat to China, even though they had been driven away after the collapse of the Yuan Dynasty. He decided to reassess the orthodox Confucian view that the military was an inferior class to the scholar bureaucracy. The Hongwu Emperor kept a powerful army which in 1384 he re-organized using a model known as the Wèisuǒ system ([tpl]zh|t=衛所制|s=卫所制|l=guard battalion[/tpl]). Each military unit consisted of 5,600 men divided into five battalions and ten companies.(In Chinese) She Yiyuan (佘一元), Shanhaiguan Chronicle (山海关志) By 1393 the total number of Wèisuǒ troops had reached 1,200,000. Soldiers were also assigned land on which to grow crops whilst their positions were made hereditary. This type of system can be traced back to the Fǔbīng System ([tpl]zh|c=府兵制[/tpl]) of the Sui and Tang Dynasties. While the Ming army was initially very effective, it lost its capacity for offensive operations after the death of the Yongle Emperor, and was defeated by the Mongols in 1449 during the Tumu Crisis.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
Training was conducted within local military districts. In times of war, troops were mobilized from all over the empire on the orders of the War Ministry, and commanders were appointed to lead them to battle. After the war, the army was disbanded into smaller groups and sent back to their respective districts, and the commanders had to return their authority to the state. This system helped to prevent military leaders from having too much power. However, one disadvantage was that the military was under the control of a civilian official for large campaigns, instead of a military general.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]

===Consolidating control===

The Hongwu Emperor expected everyone to obey his rule[tpl]cite web|url=http://rwxy.tsinghua.edu.cn/xi-suo/lsx/Learning/meeting2004/Complete/zhuhonglin.pdf |title=略論明太祖的教化性敕撰書 |publisher=Rwxy.tsinghua.edu.cn |accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl]http://www.iolaw.org.cn/showArticle.asp?id=490 and was infamous for killing many people during his purges.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.studa.net/lishi/080801/17542093.html |title=朱元璋的滥杀心理及其影响初探 |publisher=Studa.net |date=4 February 2009 |accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl] His tortures included flaying and slow slicing.劉辰. 國初事迹李默. 孤樹裒談楊一凡(1988). 明大誥研究.

A story goes that a Confucian scholar who was fed up with the Hongwu Emperor's policies decided to go to the capital and berate the emperor. When he gained an audience with the emperor, he brought his own coffin along with him. After delivering his speech he climbed into the coffin, expecting the emperor to execute him. The emperor however, impressed by this show of bravery, chose to spare the scholar's life. He was also said to have ordered the massacre of several thousand people living in Nanjing after having heard one talked about him without respect.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/8466/795137.html |title=有趣的南京地名 |publisher=People.com.cn |accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl]长乐街：秦淮影照古廊房馬生龍. 鳳凰台紀事 In 1380, after much killing, a lightning bolt struck his palace and he stopped the massacres for some time as he was afraid divine forces would punish him.徐禎卿. 剪勝野聞
The Hongwu Emperor also noted the destructive role of court eunuchs under the previous dynasties. He drastically reduced their numbers, forbidding them to handle documents, insisting that they remain illiterate, and executing those who commented on state affairs. The Hongwu Emperor had a strong aversion to the eunuchs, epitomized by a tablet in his palace stipulating: "Eunuchs must have nothing to do with the administration." This aversion to eunuchs did not long continue among his successors, as the Hongwu and Jianwen Emperors' harsh treatment of eunuchs allowed the Yongle Emperor to employ them as a power base during his coup. In addition to the Hongwu Emperor's aversion to eunuchs, he never consented to any of his marital relatives becoming court officials. This policy was fairly well-maintained by later emperors, and no serious trouble was caused by the empresses or their relatives.
The Hongwu Emperor attempted, and largely succeeded in, the consolidation of control over all aspects of government, so that no other group could gain enough power to overthrow him. He also buttressed the country's defenses against the Mongols. He increasingly concentrated power in his own hands. He abolished the chancellor's post, which had been head of the main central administrative body under past dynasties, by suppressing a plot for which he had blamed his chief minister. Many argue that the Hongwu Emperor, because of his wish to concentrate absolute authority in his own hands, removed the only insurance against incompetent emperors.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
However the Hongwu Emperor could not govern the sprawling Ming Empire all by himself and had to create the new institution of the "Grand Secretary". This cabinet-like organisation progressively took on the powers of the abolished prime minister, becoming just as powerful in time. Ray Huang argued that Grand-Secretaries, outwardly powerless, could exercise considerable positive influence from behind the throne.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] Because of their prestige and the public trust which they enjoyed, they could act as intermediaries between the emperor and the ministerial officials, and thus provide a stabilising force in the court. He executed tens of thousand officials and their relatives over sedition, treason, corruption and other charges.History of Ming, vol.139吳晗, 胡惟庸黨案考[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stnn.cc:82/arts/200702/t20070201_453086.html |title=朱元璋多疑殺人數萬？ 明初空印案之謎 |publisher=Stnn.cc:82 |date=1 February 2007 |accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl]http://vip.book.sina.com.cn/book/chapter_37777_20375.html南北榜，科场案制造20多个冤鬼[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]
In the Hongwu Emperor's elimination of the traditional offices of grand councilor, the primary impetus was Hu Weiyong's alleged attempt to usurp the throne. Hu was the Senior Grand Councilor and a capable administrator; however over the years, the magnitude of his powers as well as involvement in several political scandals eroded the paranoid emperor's trust in him. Finally, in 1380 the Hongwu Emperor had Hu and his entire family arrested and executed on charges of treason. Using this as an opportunity to purge his government, the Hongwu Emperor also ordered the execution of countless other officials, as well as their families, for associating with Hu. The purge lasted over a decade and resutled in more than 30,000 executions. In 1390, even Li Shanchang, one of the closest old friends of the Emperor who was rewarded as the biggest contributor to the founding of the Ming Empire, was executed along with over 70 members of his extended family. A year after his death, a deputy in the Board of Works made a submission to the Emperor appealing Li's innocence, arguing that since Li was already at the apex of honour, wealth and power, the accusation that he wanted to help someone else usurp the throne was clearly ridiculous. The Hongwu Emperor was unable to refute the accusations and finally ended the purge shortly afterwards.
Through the repeated purges and the elimination of the historical posts, the Hongwu Emperor fundamentally altered the centuries-old government structure of China, greatly increasing the emperor's absolutism.
He was extremely authoritarian, a virtual dictator, and governed directly over all affairs. The Hongwu Emperor personally wrote essays posted in every village throughout China warning the people to behave and of the horrifying consequences if they disobeyed.

===Legal code===

The legal code drawn up in the time of the Hongwu Emperor was considered one of the great achievements of the era. The History of Ming mentioned that as early as 1364, the monarchy had started to draft a code of laws. This code was known as Code of the Great Ming or Laws of the Great Ming (大明律). The emperor devoted much time to the project and instructed his ministers that the code should be comprehensive and intelligible, so as not to allow any official to exploit loopholes in the code by deliberately misinterpreting it. The Ming code laid much emphasis on family relations. The code was a great improvement on the code of the earlier Tang Dynasty in regards to the treatment of slaves. Under the Tang code, slaves were treated as a species of domestic animal; if they were killed by a free citizen, the law imposed no sanction on the killer. Under the Ming Dynasty, the law protected both slaves and free citizens.

===Confucianism===

Supported by the scholar-bureaucrats, the Hongwu Emperor accepted the Confucian viewpoint that merchants were solely parasitic. He felt that agriculture should be the country's source of wealth and that trade was ignoble. As a result, the Ming economic system emphasized agriculture, unlike the economic system of the Song Dynasty, which had preceded the Mongols and had relied on traders and merchant for revenues. The Hongwu Emperor also supported the creation of self-supporting agricultural communities.
However, his prejudice against merchants did not diminish the numbers of traders. On the contrary, commerce increased significantly during the Hongwu Era due to the growth of industry throughout the empire. This growth in trade was due in part to poor soil conditions and the overpopulation of certain areas, which forced many people to leave their homes and seek their fortunes in trade. A book titled Tu Pien Hsin Shu,[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] written during the Ming Dynasty, gave a detailed description about the activities of merchants at that time.

===Relations with Muslims===

The Hongwu Emperor ordered the construction of several mosques in Nanjing, Yunnan, Guangdong and Fujian,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vIUmU2ytmIIC&pg=PA170|title=Cheng Ho and Islam in Southeast Asia|author=Tan Ta Sen, Dasheng Chen|year=2000|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|page=170|isbn=981-230-837-7|page=291|accessdate=28 June 2010[/tpl] and had inscriptions praising the prophet Muhammed placed in mosques.

It was recorded that "His Majesty ordered to have mosques built in Xijing and Nanjing capital cities, and in southern Yunnan, Fujian and Guangdong." He also personally wrote a 100 word praise (baizizan) on Islam, Allah and the Prophet Muhammad.()[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jV9_YvgUmpsC&pg=PA77|title=The history of women's mosques in Chinese Islam: a mosque of their own|year=2000|authors=Maria Jaschok, Jingjun Shui|volume=|edition=illustrated |publisher=Psychology Press|location=|series=|page=77 |pages=|isbn=0-7007-1302-6|quote=For instance, in the early years of the Hongwu Emperor's reign in the Ming Dynasty, His Majesty ordered to have mosques built in Xijing and Nanjing capital cities and in southern Yunnan, Fujian and Guangdong.

The Ming Emperor Xuanzong once issued imperial orders to build a mosque in Nanjing in response to Zheng He's request (Liu Zhi, 1984 reprint: 358–374). Mosques built by imperial decree raised the social position of Islam, and assistance from upper-class Muslims helped to sustain religious sites in certain areas.|accessdate=20 December 2011[/tpl]
According to historian Jing Chee Tang, Hongwu Emperor and his cousin Koh Shiao-Tze were both Muslims. Hongwu Emperor is known to have married a woman from the Ma clan of Chee Min from Anhui.http://www.muslimheritage.com/uploads/1001_Years_of_Missing_Martial_Arts%20.pdf

===Foreign policy===

The Hongwu Emperor was a non interventionist, refusing to intervene in a Vietnamese invasion of Champa to help the Chams, only rebuking the Vietnamese for their invasion, being opposed to military action abroad.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yzWsAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA116|title=Early Ming China: a political history, 1355–1435|author=Edward L.

However, the Hongwu Emperor had harsh words for those who tried to threaten China. He sent a message to the Japanese that his army would "capture and exterminate your bandits, head straight for your country, and put your king in bonds", due to consistent raiding by Japanese Wokou pirates.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=C7dPlL7_yi4C&pg=PA28|title=China rising: peace, power, and order in East Asia |author=David Chan-oong Kang|year=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0-231-14188-2|page=28|accessdate=28 November 2010[/tpl]

===Development of the Ming Dynasty===

Although the Hongwu Era saw the introduction of paper currency, its development was stifled from the beginning. Not understanding inflation, the Hongwu Emperor gave out so much paper money as rewards that by 1425, the state was forced to reintroduce copper coins because the paper currency had sunk to only 1/70 of its original value.
During the Hongwu Era, the early Ming Dynasty was characterized by rapid and dramatic population growth, largely due to the increased food supply from the emperor's agricultural reforms.Stearns, Peter N., et al. World Civilizations: The Global Experience. AP Edition DBQ Update. New York: Pearson Education, Inc., 2006. 366. By the end of the dynasty, the population had risen by as much as 50%. This was stimulated by major improvements in agricultural technology, promoted by the pro-agrarian state which came to power in the midst of a pro-Confucian peasant's rebellion. During his reign, living standards also greatly improved.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]

==Death==

The Hongwu Emperor died on 24 June 1398 after reigning for 30 years at the age of 69. After his death, his physicians were penalized.History of Ming, vol.187 The Hongzhi Emperor and Jiajing Emperor's physicians were executed.徐乾學. 修史條議[tpl]Relevance-inline|date=November 2013[/tpl] He was buried at Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum on the Purple Mountain, east of Nanjing.

==Assessment==

Historians consider the Hongwu Emperor to have been one of the most significant emperors of China. As historian Ebrey puts it, "Seldom has the course of Chinese history been influenced by a single personality as much as it was by the founder of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang."Ebrey, "Cambridge Illustrated History of China", pg. 190 His rise to power was fast despite his having a poor and humble origin. In 11 years, he went from being a penniless monk to the most powerful warlord in China. Five years later, he became emperor of China. Simon Leys described him this way:  'an adventurer from peasant stock, poorly educated, a man of action, a bold and shrewd tactician, a visionary mind, in many respects a creative genius; naturally coarse, cynical, and ruthless, he eventually showed symptoms of paranoia, bordering on psychopathy.'Simon Leys, 'Ravished by Oranges' in New York Review of Books 20 December 2007 p.8

===Parents and ancestors===

Zhu's parents, grandparents, great-grandparents and great-great-grandparents were given posthumous Imperial titles.
 The great-great-grandfather of the Emperor was given the posthumous name of Emperor Xuan and the temple name of Dezu, and the great-great-grandmother was given the title of Empress Xuan.
