==Programs==

The Human Rights Campaign's priorities include: prevention of hate crimes and HIV/AIDS; advocacy for healthcare benefits, marriage, and adoption rights for same-sex couples; lobbying for a federal Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) and gender identity anti-discrimination laws; combating gay bashing in schools; and building relationships with straight allies, ethnic groups, religious leaders, and youth.[tpl]cite web|title=Issues: Human Rights Campaign|url=http://www.hrc.org/issues|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=February 21, 2012[/tpl]
The HRC Foundation provides educational resources and publications on coming out, transgender issues, LGBT-related healthcare topics and information about workplace issues faced by LGBT people, notably the Corporate Equality Index. It also maintains resources on LGBT parenting, religion and faith issues, immigration, and outreach for youth.Resources
The HRC Foundation's Coming Out Project provides information to people who are in the process of coming out.Resources: Coming Out
HRC lobbies for anti-discrimination, hate crimes laws, and worked on the passage of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded federal hate-crime law to allow the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.HRC: Matthew Shepard Act Referring to the law as a "historic milestone", former HRC President Joe Solmonese said its passage represents "the first time that we as a nation have explicitly protected the LGBT community in the law."President Barack Obama Signs Hate Crimes Legislation Into Law
The organization's work on health issues traditionally focused on responding to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In recent years, HRC has addressed discrimination in health care settings for LGBT employees, patients and their families. Since 2007, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation has published the "Healthcare Equality Index", which rates hospitals on issues such as patient and employee non-discrimination policies, employee cultural competency training, and hospital visitation rights for LGBT patients' families.Resources: Healthcare Equality Index As of 2013, the medical center at the University of California at San Francisco is the only institution in the United States to achieve perfect scores on the index.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=http://www.innovations.ahrq.gov/content.aspx?id=3851 |title=Inclusive Policies, Communication Protocols and Ongoing Training Lead to Culturally Competent Care for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Patients |date=2013-09-11 |accessdate=2013-09-18[/tpl] Lobbyists from the Human Rights Campaign worked with the Obama administration to extend hospital visitation rights to same-sex partners.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/15/AR2010041505502.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Michael D. | last=Shear | title=Obama extends hospital visitation rights to same-sex partners of gays | date=April 16, 2010[/tpl] In 2012, HRC announced the formation of its wide-ranging Health & Aging Program, which addresses both the health concerns of all LGBT Americans and the particular challenges faced by LGBT elders, including discrimination, mistreatment and isolation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/press-releases/entry/human-rights-campaign-foundation-expands-the-net-of-lgbt-healthcare-equalit|title=Human Rights Campaign Foundation Expands the Net of LGBT Healthcare Equality|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=March 8, 2013[/tpl]
HRC lobbied extensively for the repeal of the Don't Ask Don't Tell (DADT) law, which barred gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States military. Eric Alva, a gay Marine who was the first American wounded in combat in Iraq, has since been a spokesman on behalf of the Human Rights Campaign's efforts to repeal the law, and was invited to stand behind President Obama at the signing ceremony.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/22/AR2010122201888.html | work=The Washington Post | first1=William | last1=Branigin | first2=Debbi | last2=Wilgoren | first3=Perry | last3=Bacon Jr | title=Obama signs DADT repeal before big, emotional crowd | date=December 22, 2010[/tpl]

==History==

Steve Endean, who had worked with a previously established Gay Rights National Lobby from 1978, established the Human Rights Campaign Fund political action committee in 1980 to raise money for gay-supportive congressional candidates. In 1983, Vic Basile, at the time one of the leading LGBT rights activists in Washington, D.C., was elected as the first executive director. In October 1986, the HRC Foundation (HRCF) was formed as a non-profit organization.
In January 1989, Basile announced his departure, and HRC reorganized from serving mainly as a political action committee (PAC) to broadening its function to encompass lobbying, research, education, and media outreach.[tpl]cite journal|last=Birch|first=Elizabeth|title=The Human Rights Campaign: So Much More Than a Fund.|year=HRC Quarterly (Fall 1995)|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|pages=2–3|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/human_rights_campaign.html[/tpl] HRC decided on a new Statement of Purpose:
Tim McFeeley, a Harvard Law School graduate, founder of the Boston Lesbian and Gay Political Alliance, and a co-chair of the New England HRC Committee, was elected the new executive director. Total membership was then approximately 25,000 members.[tpl]cite book|last=Bailey|first=Mark|title="Human Rights Campaign."

In 1992, HRC endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time, Bill Clinton. In March 1993, HRC began a new project, National Coming Out Day. From January 1995 until January 2004, Elizabeth Birch served as the executive director of the HRC. Under her leadership, the institution more than quadrupled its membership to 500,000 members.[tpl]cite web|last=Althafer|first=Emily|title=Leading gay rights advocate to speak at UF|url=http://news.ufl.edu/2006/01/23/human-rights-talk/|publisher=University of Florida News: source: Adelisse Fontanet, xxx-1665 ext. 326|accessdate=February 22, 2012[/tpl]
In 1995, the organization dropped the word "Fund" from its name, becoming the Human Rights Campaign. That same year, it underwent a complete reorganization. The HRC Foundation added new programs such as the Workplace Project and the Family Project, while HRC itself broadly expanded its research, communications, and marketing/public relations functions. The organization also unveiled a new logo, a yellow equal sign inside of a blue square, which has become one of the most recognizable symbols in the LGBT community.[tpl]cite web|title=The HRC Story: About Our Logo|url=http://www.hrc.org/the-hrc-story/about-our-logo|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=February 22, 2012[/tpl]

===Marriage equality logo===

HRC shared a red version of its logo – selected because the color is synonymous with love – on social network services on March 25, 2013, and asked its supporters to do the same to show support for marriage equality in light of two marriage equality cases that were before the U.S. Supreme Court (United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry). The logo went viral, and Facebook saw a 120% increase in the number of profile photo changes on March 26. Celebrities such as George Takei, Beyonce, Sophia Bush, Padma Lakshmi, Martha Stewart and Ellen DeGeneres shared the logo with their millions of followers on social network services and U.S. senators, state governors and other elected officials did the same.[tpl]cite news|last=Thielman|first=Sam|title=DOMA Nation: The Human Rights Campaign had no idea this was going to happen|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/doma-nation-148206|accessdate=June 9, 2013|newspaper=Adweek|date=March 28, 2013[/tpl]

Critics of the HRC have accused the organization of favoring the Democratic Party. Andrew Sullivan, a conservative gay political columnist and blogger, has been critical of the HRC, calling it "a patronage wing of the Democratic party".Sullivan, Andrew.

HRC's endorsement of New York Republican Al D'Amato in his 1998 campaign for re-election to the U.S. Senate brought more criticism. HRC defended the endorsement because of D'Amato's support for Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) and repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell". However, many liberal LGBT leaders did not welcome D'Amato's many conservative stances, including his opposition to affirmative action and abortion.Kaiser, Charles. (July 18, 2000) The D'Amato Factor The Advocate. Retrieved February 22, 2012.
HRC has also been accused of overstating the number of its actual members in order to appear more influential in politics.Citizen Crain: Cooking the books at HRCThe Daily Dish | By Andrew Sullivan Former HRC President Joe Solmonese responded, saying that "membership is about more than contributions ... it's about sending e-mails to elected officials, volunteering time or lobbying members of Congress" and more than half of its members made contributions during the previous two years.HRC 'members' include all who ever donated $1 – Washington Blade originally here Earlier, HRC spokesperson Steven Fisher stated that its membership includes anyone who has donated at least $1.
Some transgender people have criticized the HRC for its stance on the 2007 version of ENDA, which enumerated sexual orientation as a protected category but not gender identity and expression.Schindler, Paul.
