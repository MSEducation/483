==Career==

Born in Hornsey, London, the son of a painter and decorator, Dickens left school at the age of sixteen and began working for his father. He then took a job as a buying clerk in an engineering firm for three months, before in 1946 deciding to pursue an ambition to become a champion racing cyclist. He moved to Paris after his National Service but failed to make a living at cycling, so he tried to make money by selling cycling cartoons to French magazines, including L'Équipe and Paris-Match. A self-taught artist, he had his first cartoon published in a British national newspaper in the Sunday Express on 30 September 1959.http://www.frankdickens.com/FD/Pages/Cartoons/Cartoons1Page.htm Work in the Evening Standard, Daily Sketch and Daily Mirror followed, and in December 1960 Dickens began a three-month period at the Sunday Times, where he took his strip "Oddbod". One of the characters in that strip was developed into the bowler-hatted Bristow. The Bristow strip first appeared in regional papers, before being taken up by the Evening Standard on 6 March 1962.
In 1971 the Bristow strip was produced on stage at the ICA, London, starring Freddie Jones, and in 1999 Dickens himself adapted it as a six-part series for BBC Radio 4, featuring Michael Williams, Rodney Bewes and Dora Bryan. Anne Karpf observed in The Guardian: "From cartoon strip to radio series is no longer a large leap, although Frank Dickens's Bristow, about an idle paper-pusher in a large firm, scarcely invites the kind of Superman cartoon radio techniques that have become so familiar. Yet the first in this new Radio 4 series cleverly managed to sound simultaneously knowing and naïf."The Guardian, 24 April 1999. 
Since 1966 twelve Bristow compilations in book form have been published: by Constable (1966), Allison & Busby (1970), Abelard-Schuman (1972, 1973, 1974, 1975), Futura (1976), Barrie & Jenkins (1978), Penguin Books (1981), Macmillan (1982), and Beaumont Book Company (Australia, 1977, 1978)."Bristow in Print". The most recent is The Big, Big, Big, Bristow Book (Little, Brown & Company, 2001).The Big Big Big Bristow Page.
The strip that brought Dickens greatest financial success, through syndication in the United States, was "Albert Herbert Hawkins: The Naughtiest Boy in the World" - which reportedly captures the "essential naughtiness" of its author.[tpl]cite web |url=http://opal.kent.ac.uk/cartoonx-cgi/artist.py?id=37 |title=Dickens, Frank |work=British Cartoon Archive |publisher=University of Kent |accessdate=5 October 2008 [/tpl]
