==Early years==

Curtis Jr. was born to Rochella Dixon and Curtis Sr. on May 1, 1973.[tpl]cite news|title=Politi: Jets' Curtis Martin has shown greatness beyond football, including forgiving his father|url=http://www.nj.com/jets/index.ssf/2012/01/politi_jets_curtis_martin_has.html|work=The Star-Ledger|author=Politi, Steve|date=28 January 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65D0MnwjP|archivedate=4 February 2012|accessdate=4 February 2012[/tpl] Curtis Sr. left the family in 1978 after turning to drugs and alcohol leaving Curtis' mother to support the family by working two jobs. During his youth, Curtis often moved around the various neighborhoods in Pittsburgh and was consistently surrounded by violence.[tpl]cite news|title=Pro Football; For Martin, a Mixture of Oil With Talent|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E3DC1438F937A25752C0A9639C8B63|work=The New York Times|author=Chass, Murray|date=14 January 2005|accessdate=4 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=AFC Playoffs / The Jets: Curtis Martin a football star by accident|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05014/441889.stm|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|author=Finder, Chuck|date=14 January 2005|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65D0WkXrc|archivedate=4 February 2012|accessdate=4 February 2012[/tpl] His grandmother, Eleanor Johnson, was found murdered with a knife in her chest and Martin at age 15 faced near-death when a loaded gun pointed at his head was pulled seven times but never fired.[tpl]cite news|title=For Martin, Hall Is Latest Stop in a Still Unfolding Career|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/04/sports/football/for-curtis-martin-hall-is-latest-stop-in-football-career.html|work=The New York Times|author=Pedulla, Tom|date=4 August 2012|accessdate=5 August 2012[/tpl]
He and his mother settled in Point Breeze prior to his sophomore year of high school where he began attending Taylor Allderdice High School which was known for its highly regarded academic reputation. He played basketball as a sophomore but did not participate in any sports during his junior year. At the insistence of his mother, who wanted him to participate in an extracurricular activity as a way to keep him away from crime and violence, Curtis began to play football during his senior year despite having never cared much for the sport.[tpl]cite news|title=Jets' Martin: High output, low profile|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/jets/2004-09-29-curtis-martin-cover_x.htm|work=USA Today|author=Mihoces, Gary|date=29 September 2004|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65D5n7A7M|archivedate=4 February 2012|accessdate=4 February 2012[/tpl]
Martin was considered a natural athlete according to former head coach Mark Wittgartner and became an immediate star on the football team as he played at the running back and linebacker positions. He also played on special teams and occasionally at quarterback. He ran for 1,705 yards and scored 20 touchdowns in his lone season of high school football. Martin graduated from Allderdice in 1991 and was inducted into their alumni hall of fame in 2011.[tpl]cite news|title=Allderdice to induct 6 to Alumni Hall of Fame|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-city/allderdice-to-induct-6-to-alumni-hall-of-fame-321622/|accessdate=July 18, 2012|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=October 31, 2011[/tpl]
Martin's performance at Allderdice attracted the attention of the University of Pittsburgh's football coach Paul Hackett. Though other offers were available, Martin decided to remain close to home and attend Pittsburgh.

==College career==

Martin, whom Hackett likened to Tony Dorsett, was expected to be a valued contributor to the Panthers when he arrived in 1991. However, injuries plagued much of his college career. As a junior he rushed for 1,045 yards in ten games but he missed the final two with a sprained shoulder.[tpl]cite news|title=Pro Football: Notebook; In Need of Running Backs, Patriots Pencil a Rookie Into the Starting Lineup|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/13/sports/pro-football-notebook-need-running-backs-patriots-pencil-rookie-into-starting.html?scp=2&sq=Curtis+Martin&st=nyt|work=The New York Times|author=Smith, Timothy W.|date=13 August 1995|accessdate=5 February 2012[/tpl] In 1994, Martin opened his senior year running for a career high 251 yards against Texas however the following week against Ohio he suffered a sprained ankle that sidelined him for the rest of the season.
Martin had the option to redshirt and play one more season at Pittsburgh or enter the NFL Draft. He chose to enter the draft stating "in the end it was the best thing to do". Draft analysts predicted that had Martin stayed another season at Pittsburgh and remained injury free he could have been a potential first round selection. Martin was highly touted for his speed, he ran a 4.4 in the 40 yard dash, and his slashing running style.

==Professional career==

===New England Patriots===

The Patriots lost three running backs to free agency upon the conclusion of the 1994 season and sought to fortify their backfield. One running back, Kevin Turner, was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles as a restricted free agent and Philadelphia sent a third round selection to New England. The Patriots used the selection to draft Martin in the 1995 NFL Draft despite concerns about his durability. Martin signed a contract with the team on July 19, 1995,[tpl]cite news|title=Transactions|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/19/sports/transactions-61096.html?scp=17&sq=Curtis+Martin&st=nyt|work=The New York Times|date=19 August 1995|accessdate=5 February 2012[/tpl] and made his NFL debut in the Patriots' week one win over the Cleveland Browns.[tpl]cite web|title=Curtis Martin Career Game Log|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MartCu00/gamelog/|publisher=Pro Football Reference|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65E8XKIeW|archivedate=5 February 2012|accessdate=5 February 2012[/tpl] Martin ran for 30 yards on his first carry and finished with 102 yards for the day.[tpl]cite web|title=Curtis Martin|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=299|publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65E8JgjbJ|archivedate=5 February 2012|accessdate=5 February 2012[/tpl] He became the first Patriots rookie to rush for 100 yards during their debut. Martin continued his impressive streak and rushed for over 100 yards eight more times during the season. He finished the season as the AFC's leading rusher with 1,487 yards and 14 touchdowns. He won the Offensive Rookie of the Year Award and was named to the Pro Bowl.
The following year, Martin only rushed for 100 yards twice during the season but recorded 1,152 yards and 14 rushing touchdowns. In the playoffs, Martin, playing in his first career playoff game, served as a key player in the Patriots' wild card victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. He rushed for a then franchise record 166 yards and three touchdowns including a 78-yard touchdown, the second longest touchdown run in playoff history at the time.[tpl]cite news|title=It's Open House for Patriots and Martin|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/08/sports/it-s-open-house-for-patriots-and-martin.html?scp=6&sq=Curtis+Martin&st=nyt|work=The New York Times|author=Eskenazi, Gerald|date=8 January 1997|accessdate=14 September 2012[/tpl] The Patriots went on to play in Super Bowl XXXI, but lost to the Green Bay Packers. Martin rushed for 42 yards, caught three passes for 28 yards, and scored a touchdown in the game. Martin was again named to the Pro Bowl.

===New York Jets===

After the 1997 season, Martin became a restricted free agent. On the first day of the free agency period Martin's agent, Eugene Parker, contacted the New York Jets to gauge their interest in potentially signing the running back.[tpl]cite web|title=Curtis Martin changed two franchises|url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/8224339/pro-football-hall-fame-curtis-martin-changed-course-two-franchises|publisher=ESPN New York|author=Cimini, Rich|date=4 August 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69fZXn4c5|archivedate=4 August 2012|accessdate=4 August 2012[/tpl] Negotiations ensued between Parker and Jets head coach and general manager Bill Parcells and an offer sheet was formulated. Though Martin had reservations about playing in New York and particularly for a division rival, the presence of his former coach Parcells influenced his decision to ultimately join the Jets.[tpl]cite news|title=Hall of Fame running back Curtis Martin never liked football, and he hated New York and the Jets|url=http://www.nj.com/jets/index.ssf/2012/07/curtis_martin_never_liked_foot.html|work=The Star-Ledger|author=Vrentas, Jenny|date=24 July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69fZyY3Z0|archivedate=4 August 2012|accessdate=4 August 2012[/tpl] On March 20, 1998, Martin signed a six-year $36 million poison pill contract.[tpl]cite news|title=Martin Signs Jet Offer Sheet|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/21/sports/sp-31288|work=Los Angeles Times|date=21 March 1998|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69fbpvvIn|archivedate=4 August 2012|accessdate=4 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=New York Jets could insert 'poison pill' into offer sheet to Cowboys WR Miles Austin|url=http://www.nj.com/jets/index.ssf/2009/04/will_the_new_york_jets_insert.html|work=The Star-Ledger|author=Hutchinson, Dave|date=8 April 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69fbaPPTC|archivedate=4 August 2012|accessdate=4 August 2012[/tpl] The "poison pill" was a clause in the contract that stated Martin would become an unrestricted free agent after one-year if the Patriots matched the offer and it would have forced New England to pay a $3.3 million roster bonus that would have compromised their salary cap. Under these conditions, the Patriots did not match the offer however they received the Jets' first and third round selections in the 1998 NFL Draft as compensation after filing a complaint with the NFL management council claiming the offer sheet violated the terms of the league's collective bargaining agreement at the time.[tpl]cite web|title=Jets-Pats rivalry transcends games|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/334/jets-pats-rivalry-transcends-games|publisher=ESPN|author=Graham, Tim|date=11 September 2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vo5dSwnR|archivedate=17 January 2011|accessdate=5 July 2010[/tpl]
In his first seven seasons with the Jets, Martin missed only one game and was selected to the Pro Bowl three times. In 1998, Martin gained 182 yards from scrimmage and scored two touchdowns against the Jacksonville Jaguars in a Jets playoff win. In 2004, Martin rushed for a season-high 196 yards against the Cincinnati Bengals in the team's home opener and would do so eight more times that season, finishing with 1,697 yards.[tpl]cite web|title=Martin rushes to the top|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/2012/8/1/Curtis-Martin-oldest-player-to-lead-NFL-in-rushing/|publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame|date=1 August 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69feXhWOS|archivedate=4 August 2012|accessdate=4 August 2012[/tpl] Martin won the NFL rushing title by one more yard than runner-up Shaun Alexander and became the oldest player, at age 31, in league history to win the rushing title.
