==History==

===First years===

The airline was established on 25 July 1988 as a joint-stock company, but had to wait two years before it could start services, due to a delay in air transport liberalization. It started operations on 7 July 1990 with a flight from Lisbon to Porto. It also flew from Lisbon to Faro that same day. It started operations with scheduled domestic and international charter flights, as scheduled international flights were not then permitted under Portuguese legislation. International scheduled flights started in June 1992 from Lisbon and Porto. 
The company's first airplanes were Fokker 100's and since late 1990's it has also purchased 8 Embraer 145, becoming the main competitor of state flag carrier TAP Portugal. Operating in the regional market, Portugália focused its operation in domestic routes, as well as on destinations in Spain, France, Italy, Germany and Morocco.

===International recognition===

The Company’s fleet stabilized in 2000 with 14 aircraft (6 Fokker 100 and 8 Embraer 145) still operating today. PGA asserted itself on the European market as a private and innovative airline, guided by high level service standards.
Portugália received the title of "Best Regional Airline" in Europe, in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, the Skytrax Award for Best Cabin Staff in Europe, in 2005 and 2006, and for Best Cabin Staff in Southern Europe, in 2007.

===Portugália maintenance & engineering===

Portugália developed its own maintenance services since its earliest days, however it only managed to have its own Hangar and to increase its base maintenance capabilities as of 2005 with the opening of its Hangar at Lisbon Portela Airport. Performing most of its Fokker and Embraer maintenance in house, Portugália managed to significantly improve its results.

===[tpl]anchor|Intergration in TAP Portugal Group[/tpl]Integration into TAP Portugal Group===

On 6 November 2006, TAP and Portugalia's owners Grupo Espirito Santo, announced TAP's acquisition of 99.81% of Portugalia shares, subject to approval by the regulatory authorities. It had 750 employees (at March 2007). Portugalia was to join the SkyTeam Alliance in 2008, but since it was bought by Star Alliance member TAP Portugal, it's not known if it will join Star Alliance as a regional member.
With the acquisition by TAP Portugal Group it undertakes a new business model. The Company stops working independently and starts working within a Group logic as a supplier of flight capacity by hiring its aircraft to TAP Portugal.
Fernando Pinto, president & CEO of TAP Portugal said that the airline's regional subsidiary, Portugália Airlines, is "important to the TAP results as it brings very important passengers from small cities to long distance services.",http://www.eraa.org/events/regional-airline-conference/875-rac2012-day-1-news-report during European Regional Airlines Association 2012 conference in Porto.
