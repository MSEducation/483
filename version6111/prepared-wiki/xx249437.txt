[[Simplicial map]]

CATEGORIES: Algebraic topology

In the mathematical discipline of simplicial homology theory, a simplicial map is a map between simplicial complexes with the property that the images of the vertices of a simplex always span a simplex. Note that this implies that vertices have vertices for images.
Simplicial maps are thus determined by their effects on vertices.  In particular, there are a finite number of simplicial maps between two given finite simplicial complexes.
Simplicial maps induce continuous maps between the underlying polyhedra of the simplicial complexes: one simply extends linearly using barycentric coordinates.
Simplicial maps which are bijective are called simplicial isomorphisms.

A simplicial approximation is homotopic to the map it approximates.
