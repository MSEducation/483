Cagliari ([tpl]IPA-it|ˈkaʎʎari|lang|It-Cagliari.ogg[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-sc|Casteddu[/tpl];[tpl]#tag:ref|Long name (defunct): Casteddu de Callaris|group=lower-alpha[/tpl] [tpl]lang-lat|Caralis[/tpl]) is an Italian municipality and the capital of the island of Sardinia, an Autonomous RegionRegione Autonoma della Sardegna of Italy. Cagliari's Sardinian name Casteddu literally means castle. It has nearly 150,000 inhabitants,2011 Italian National Census, http://dati.istat.it/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=DICA_POPALED&Lang=it while its metropolitan area (including Elmas, Assemini, Capoterra, Selargius, Sestu, Monserrato, Quartucciu, Quartu Sant'Elena and other 15 municipalities) has more than 480,000 inhabitants.
An ancient city with a long history, Cagliari has seen the rule of several civilizations. Under the buildings of the modern city there is a continuous stratification of human settlements of about five thousand years, from the Neolithic to today. There are some domus de janas, very damaged by cave activity, a large Carthaginian era necropolis, a Roman era amphitheater, a Byzantine basilica, two  Pisan-era towers, a strong system of fortification that made the town the core of the Spanish Habsburg imperial power in the western Mediterranean sea. Its natural resources have always been its sheltered harbor, the oft-powerfully fortified hill of Monti Castru, the modern Casteddu, the salt from its lagoons, and, from inland, the Campidanian plain wheat and the Iglesiente mines.
It was the capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia (which in 1861 became the Kingdom of Italy) from 1324 to 1848, when Turin  became the formal capital of the kingdom . Today the city is a regional cultural, educational, political and artistic centre, known for its diverse Art Nouveau architecture and several monuments.,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.it-schools.com/sections/travel-and-culture-in-italy/sardiniat/cagliari-art.shtml |title=Cagliari art (Italian Language Schools and Courses to Learn Italian in Italy.) |publisher=It-schools.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20[/tpl] and Sardinia's economic and industrial hub, having one of the biggest ports in the Mediterranean sea, an international airport, and the 106th highest income rate in Italy (among 8.092 comuni), comparable to that of several Northern cities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2011-03-26/milano-stacca-tutti-classifica-132221.shtml?uuid=AauRDnJD|title=Nell'Italia delle tasse Milano stacca tutti - Guarda il reddito del tuo Comune |publisher=Il Sole 24 ORE |date= |accessdate=2013-10-15[/tpl]

==History==

===Early history===

Cagliari has been inhabited since ancient times.  It occupies a favourable position between the sea and a fertile plain, and is surrounded by two swamps (which increased the defense from inner lands) and is close to high mountains towards which people could evacuate if everything else was lost. Some findings of prehistoric inhabitants were found in Monte Claro (the eponymous culture, from the Copper Age) and in Cape Sant'Elia (several domus de janas).
Karalis was established around the 8th/7th century BC as one of a string of Phoenician colonies in Sardinia, including Tharros.  Its foundation is linked to  its position across the  communication routes with Africa, as well as to its excellent port.
The Phoenician settlement was located in the Stagno di Santa Gilla,  west of the present centre of Cagliari.  This was also the site of the Roman Portus Scipio, and, when Arab pirates raided the area in the 8th century, it became the refuge for people fleeing from the city.  Further, other Phoenician settlements  have been found at Cape Sant'Elia.
In the 5th century BC Carthage took control of Sardinia, and Cagliari grew substantially under their domination, as testified by the large Tuvixeddu necropolis and other remains. Cagliari was a fortified settlement, in what is now the modern Marina quarter, with an annexed holy area in the modern Stampace.
Sardinia and Cagliari went under the Roman rule in 238 BC when the Romans defeated the Carthaginians.  No mention of it is found on the occasion of the Roman conquest of the island; but during the Second Punic War, it was the headquarters of the praetor, T. Manlius, from whence he carried on his operations against Hampsicora and the Carthaginians,Livy xxiii. 40, 41. and on other occasions was also the chief naval station of the Romans in the island, and the residence of the praetor.Id. xxx. 39.
Florus calls it the urbs urbinum, or capital of Sardinia, and represents it as taken and severely punished by Gracchus,ii. 6. § 35. but this statement is wholly at variance with the account given by Livy, of the wars of Gracchus, in Sardinia, according to which the cities were faithful to Rome, and the revolt was confined to the mountain tribes.xli. 6, 12, 17. In the Civil War between Caesar and Pompey, the citizens of Caralis were the first to declare in favor of the former, an example soon followed by the other cities of Sardinia;Julius Caesar Commentarii de Bello Civili i. 30. and Caesar himself touched there with his fleet on his return from Africa.Hirt. B. Afr. 98. A few years later, when Sardinia fell into the hands of Menas, the lieutenant of Sextus Pompeius, Caralis was the only city which offered any resistance, but was taken after a short siege.Cassius Dio xlviii. 30.
Cagliari continued to be regarded as the capital of the island under the Roman Empire, and though it did not become a colony, its inhabitants obtained the rights of Roman citizens.Pliny iii. 7. s. 13; Strabo v. p. 224; Pomponius Mela, ii. 7; Antonine Itinerary pp. 80, 81, 82, etc.
Roman public buildings were found to the west of Marina in Piazza del Carmine. There was an area of ordinary housing near Via Roma, and richer houses on the slopes of Marina.  The Amphitheatre is to the West of Castello.
A Christian community is attested in Cagliari at least as early as the 3rd century, and by the end of the century the city had a Christian bishop.  In the middle decades of the 4th century the bishop Lucifer of Cagliari was exiled because of his opposition to the Arian belief.   He was banished to the desert of Thebais by the emperor Constantius.Sozomen, Ecclesiastical History, 3.15 and 5.12
After the fall of the Western Empire Cagliari fell, together with the rest of Sardinia, into the hands of the Vandals, but appears to have retained its importance throughout the Middle Ages.
Claudian describes the ancient city as extending to a considerable length towards the promontory or headland, the projection of which sheltered its port: the latter affords good anchorage for large vessels; but besides this, which is only a well-sheltered road-stead, there is adjoining the city a large salt-water lake, or lagoon, called the Stagno di Cagliari, communicating by a narrow channel with the bay, which appears from Claudian to have been used in ancient times as an inner harbor or basin.Claud. B. Gild. 520-24. The promontory adjoining the city is evidently that noticed by Ptolemy ([tpl]lang|grc|Κάραλις πόλις καὶ ἄκρα[/tpl]), but the Caralitanum Promontorium of Pliny can be no other than the headland, now called Capo Carbonara, which forms the eastern boundary of the Gulf of Cagliari, and the southeast point of the whole island. Immediately off it lay the little island of Ficaria,Pliny l. c.; Ptolemy iii. 3. § 8. now called the Isola dei Cavoli.

===Giudicato of Cagliari===

Subsequently ruled  by the Vandals and then part of the Byzantine Empire, Cagliari became the capital of a gradually independent  giudicato. However, there is some evidence that during this period of independence from external rule, the city was deserted because it was too exposed to attacks by Moorish pirates coming from north Africa and Spain. Apparently many people left Caralis and founded a new town (named Santa Igia) in an area close to the Santa Gilla swamp on the west of Cagliari, but relatively distant from the sea. The giudicato of Cagliari comprised a large area of the Campidano plain, the mineral resources of the Sulcis region and the mountain region of Ogliastra.

===11th to 13th century===

During the 11th century, the Republic of Pisa began to extend its political influence over the giudicato of Cagliari. Pisa and the other maritime republic of Genoa had a keen interest in Sardinia because it was a perfect strategic base for controlling the commercial routes between Italy and North Africa.
In  1215 the Pisan Lamberto Visconti, giudice of Gallura, forced  Torchitorio IV of Cagliari and his wife Benedetta to give him the mount located east of Santa Igia. Soon  (1216/1217) Pisan merchants established there a new fortified city,  known as Castel di Castro, which can be considered as the ancestor of the modern city of Cagliari. Some of the fortifications that still surround the current district of Castello  were built by the Pisans, including the two remaining white limestone towers designed by architect Giovanni Capula (originally there were three towers that guarded the three gates that gave access to the district). Together with the district of Castello, Castel di Castro comprised the districts of Marina (which included the port) and later Stampace and Villanova. Marina and Stampace were guarded by walls, differently from Villanova, which was mostly home to peasants.
In 1258, after the defeat of  William III, the last giudice of Cagliari, the Pisans and their Sardinian allies (Arborea, Gallura and Logudoro) destroyed the old capital of Santa Igia. The Giudicato of Cagliari was divided into three parts: the northwest third went to Gallura; the central portion was incorporated into Arborea;  Sulcis and Iglesiente, on the south-west, were given to the Pisan della Gherardesca family, while the Republic of Pisa maintained the control over his colony of Castel di Castro.

===14th to 17th centuries===

During the 14th century the Crown of Aragon conquered Cagliari (Castel di Castro) after a battle against the Pisans. When Sardinia was finally conquered by the Catalan-Aragonese army, Cagliari (Castel de Càller or simply Càller in Catalan) became the administrative capital of the newborn Kingdom of Sardinia, one of the many kingdoms forming the Crown of Aragon, which later came under the rule of the Spanish Empire. However, due to the increasing importance of  the Americas within the Spanish Empire, Sardinia and  Cagliari lost importance.
The kings of Aragon, and later the kings of Spain, were  represented in Cagliari by a viceroy.

===18th century===

In 1718,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.charmingsardinia.com/booksardegna/SARDINIA-Cagliari-Villasimius-Costa%20Rei-Oristano-2009.pdf | title=Guide to Cagliari, Villasimius, Costa Rei  | work=CharmingSardinia |date=February 2009[/tpl] after a brief rule of the Austrian Habsburgs, Cagliari and Sardinia came under the House of Savoy. As ruler of Sardinia, the Savoys took the title of kings of the Sardinian kingdom. The Sardinian kingdom comprised Savoy and Nice (currently in France), Piedmont and Liguria, as well as Sardinia. Although Sardinian by name, the kingdom had its capital in Turin, in mainland Italy, where the Savoys resided. The parliament was also in Turin and its members were mainly aristocrats from Piedmont or the mainland.
In the late 18th century, during the Napoleonic wars, France tried to conquer Cagliari because of its strategic role in the Mediterranean sea. A French army landed on the Poetto beach and moved towards Cagliari, but the French were defeated by Sardinians who decided to defend themselves against the revolutionary army. People from Cagliari hoped to receive some concession from the Savoys in return for their defending the town: for example, aristocrats from Cagliari asked for a Sardinian representative in the parliament of the kingdom. When the Savoys refused any concession to the Sardinians, inhabitants of Cagliari rose up against the Savoys and expelled all representatives of the kingdom and people from Piedmont. This insurgence is celebrated in Cagliari during the "Die de sa Sardigna" (Sardinian Day) on the last weekend of April. However the Savoys regained control of the town after a brief period of autonomous rule.

===Modern age===

Starting in the 1870s, in the wake of the unification of Italy, the city experienced a century of rapid growth. Many buildings were erected by the end of the 19th century during the office of mayor Ottone Bacaredda. Numerous buildings combined influences from Art Nouveau together with the traditional Sardinian taste for floral decoration: an example is the white marble City Hall near the port. Bacaredda is also known for his strong repression of one of the earliest worker strikes at the beginning of the 20th century.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
During the Second World War Cagliari was heavily bombed by the Allies in February 1943. In order to escape from the danger of bombardments and difficulty of life, many people were evacuated from the city into the countryside.
After the Italian armistice with the Allies in September 1943, the German Army took control of Cagliari and the island, but soon retreated peacefully in order to reinforce their positions in mainland Italy. The American Army then took control of Cagliari. Airports near the city (Elmas, Monserrato, Decimomannu, currently a NATO airbase) were used by Allied aircraft to fly to North Africa or mainland Italy and Sicily.
After the war, the population of Cagliari grew again and many apartment blocks were erected in new residential districts, often created with poor planning, as were recreational areas.

==Geography==

The city of Cagliari is situated in the south of Sardinia, overlooking the center of the eponymous gulf, also called Golfo degli Angeli ("Bay of Angels") after an ancient legend. The city is spread over and around the hill of the historic district of Castello, and other nine limestone hills of the middle-late Miocene, unique heights of a little more than one hundred meters above sea level on the long plains of Campidano. The plain is actually a Graben formed during the Alpine orogeny of the Cenozoic, which separated Sardinia from the European continent, roughly where it is now the Gulf of Lion in France, and broke up with various up and down tectonic movements the ancient island Paleozoic skeleton.[tpl]cite book|title=Atlante della Sardegna|editor= R. Pracchi and A. Terrosu Asole|publisher= Editrice la Zattera|location=Cagliari|year=1971[/tpl]
The repeated intrusion of the sea left calcareous sediments that formed a series of hills that mark the territory of Cagliari: that where there is the fortified town near the harbor of the port and the birthplace of the city, Mount Urpinu, the St. Elias hill, also known as the Sella del Diavolo ("Saddle of the Devil") for its shape, Tuvumannu and Tuvixeddu, where there was the ancient Punic and Roman necropolis, the small Bonaria hill, where stands the basilica, and the San Michele hill, on top of which is the eponymous castle. The modern city has occupied the flat spaces between the hills and the sea to the south and south-east, along the Poetto beach, the lagoons and ponds of Santa Gilla and Molentargius, remains of more recent marine intrusions, in an articulate landscape, with many landmarks panoramas on the bay, the plain, the mountains that surround it at east (The Seven Brothers and Serpeddì) and west (mountains of Capoterra). In the cold, clear days of winter, from the highest points of the city, the snowy peaks of Gennargentu can be seen.

===Parks and recreation===

Cagliari is one of the "greenest" Italian city. Every citizen of Cagliari has available 87.5 square meters of public gardens and parks.http://www.istat.it/it/files/2013/06/Urbes_2013.pdf
Its mild climate allows the growth of numerous subtropical plants, such as Jacaranda mimosifolia, Ficus macrophylla, with some huge specimens in Via Roma and in the University Botanic Gardens, Erythrina caffra with its stunning red flowering, Ficus retusa, that provides shade for several streets in the city, Araucaria heterophylla, the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), the Canary Islands palm (Phoenix canariensis), the Mexican Fan Palm (Washingtonia robusta).
Major parks of the city include:
In addition Cagliari is the home of the Monumental Cemetery of Bonaria.
The  Molentargius - Saline Regional ParkParco Molentargius - Saline is located near the city. Some mountain parks, such as Monte Arcosu or Maidopis, with large forests and wildlife (Sardinian deer, wild boars, etc.) are also nearby

====Beaches====

The main beach of Cagliari is the Poetto. It stretches for about eight kilometers, from Sella del Diavolo (the Devil's Saddle) up to the coastline of Quartu Sant'Elena. Poetto is also the name of the district located on the western stretch of the strip between the beach and Saline di Molentargius (Molentargius's Salt Mine).
Another smaller beach is that of Calamosca near the Sant'Elia district.
On the coast between Calamosca and Poetto Beaches among the cliffs of the Sella del Diavolo, lays Cala Fighera, a small bay.
Cagliari is close to other  seaside locations, such as Nora, Santa Margherita di Pula, Chia, Tuerredda or Geremeas, Solanas, Villasimius, Costa Rei, still relatively unspoiled by tourism.

===Climate===

Cagliari has a Mediterranean climate (Csa in the Köppen climate classification) with hot, dry summers and very mild winters. The extreme values in summer sometimes slightly are over [tpl]convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] (sometimes with very high humidity), while in winter, under special and rare conditions drop slightly below zero. Heavy snowfalls occur on average every thirty years.
The average temperature of the coldest month, January, is about [tpl]convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl], and those of the warmest month, August, about [tpl]convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. But heat waves can occur, due to African anticyclone since June. From mid-June to mid-September, rain is a rare event, reduced to some storms in the afternoon. The rainy season starts in September, but the first cold days come in December, usually the wettest month as well.
Winds are frequent, especially the mistral and sirocco; in summer days a marine sirocco breeze (s'imbattu) lowers the temperature and the heat.

==Demographics==

According to the Commune Statistical Office, in 2012,Comune di Cagliari| Visualizza contenuto there were 156,538 people residing in Cagliari (-5,4% than in 2002), of whom 72,663 were male and 83,875 were female; the sex rate was 0.87. Minors (boy and children ages 18 and younger) totalled 12.92% of the population compared to pensioners that number 24.81%. The average age of Cagliari residents is 47.44. The ratio of the population aged >65 and the minor one, under age 65 population in the last 10 years has increased by 21.95%. The current birth rate of Cagliari is 6.29 births per 1,000 inhabitants. The average number of any components per household is 2.11 and the percentage number of households composed by a single person is 42.53%. 
The population of Cagliari is structured like those of all the countries of the first world, but especially with the prevalence of the elderly population. The trend of these rates is proportionally inverse with Cagliari metropolitan areas and suburbs, where most younger families move.
As of 2012, 4.26% (6,658 people) of the population was foreign, of which the largest group were Filipinos (21.33%), followed by Ukrainians (11.93%), Romanians (10.93%), Chinese (9.49%), and Senegalese (9.49%).
In 1928, during the fascist regime, the neighboring municipalities of Pirri, Monserrato, Selargius, Quartucciu and Elmas, were merged with that of Cagliari. Mussolini's regime wanted to streamline the local administration eliminating many small towns and at the same time show that Italy was a major power with many major cities. After the war these small municipalities gradually regained their autonomy except the former town of Pirri.
The first table shows the inhabitants of the town in its present borders, the second one the commune population with the others merged municipalities.

===Metropolitan area===

The metropolitan area of Cagliari totals 453,728 inhabitants according to the 2011 census, a slight increase (2.3%) compared to 2001 census.  It is composed by 24 municipalities along the coast of its gulf and in the inner Campidanu plain, until [tpl]convert|20|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] inside.
It covers an area on the plain of Campidanu between large basins (Santa Gilla lagoon and salt mills of about 1300 hectares), ponds (Molentargius, 1622 hectares) and the depopulated mountains up to 1,100 meters above sea level, largely covered by forests and mostly managed  by the Ente Foreste of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia, which are at west (mountains Capoterra and Pula [tpl]convert|256|km²|0|abbr=on[/tpl], Monte Arcosu WWF Natural Reserve 36 km²) and at east (Mount Serpeddì and Sette Fratelli 132 km²).
The metropolitan area is strictly statistical and does not imply any kind of administrative unity or function, even if it is fully included in the Cagliari Province. It is based on municipalities where there has been, between the last two censuses, an increasing population, in a region where the population is generally decreasing. These municipalities welcome immigrants to the urban area whose main nucleus, the city of Cagliari, has a high rate of aged population which is decreasing due to the high cost of homes, not accessible to young
In the last century, the population of the municipalities of the metropolitan area increased by 354% and in the last 50 years by 158% (1911: 128,444; 1961: 288,683; 2011: 454,819). For the whole of Sardinia this increase respectively was 88% and 15% (1911: 868,181; 1961: 1,419,362; 2011: 1,639,362). The urbanization towards the area of Cagliari was, in percentage terms, impressive, making the capital of the island a metropolis surrounded by rural areas increasingly depopulated.
This urbanization is also reflected in  the concentration in Cagliari of most of the economic activities and wealth.

==Economy==

According to 2010 data of Italian Ministry of Economy, the inhabitants of Cagliari returned an individual income tax per capita that was 127% of National average, while entire Sardinia returned only 81%.   The metropolitan area returned 97% of national average. As usual, the urban area income is greater than that of boroughs or countryside but in Sardinia the occurrence is particularly acute.Redditi Irpef 2010 in Italia
Cagliari is the capital city of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia. It is its administrative hub and headquarters, as well as of the regional and provincial offices of the Italian central administration. Cagliari is also the main trade and industrial center of the island, with numerous commercial sites and factories within its metropolitan boundaries.
The first department store (La Rinascente) was opened in 1931, in the center of the city, still opened. Nowadays there are many commercial centers in the metropolitan area (Le Vele, Santa Gilla, La Corte del Sole, Marconi) with most European chains of stores such as Auchan, MediaWorld, Euronics, Carrefour, Bata Shoes and others.
Cagliari is the main operational headquarters of the Banco di Sardegna, which belongs to BPER Group and is listed on the Milan Stock Exchange (BSRP), of the Banca di Cagliari and The Banca di Credito Sardo that belongs to the Intesa Sanpaolo Group.
The Macchiareddu-Grogastru area between Cagliari and Capoterra, in conjunction with a large international container terminal port at GiorginoPorto Canale Cagliari is one of the most important industrial areas of Sardinia. Cagliari also has one of the largest fish markets in Italy with a vast array of fish for sale to both the public and trade. The communications provider Tiscali has its headquarters in town, and Cagliari also has one of the biggest container terminals on the Mediterranean sea.
Multinational corporations like Coca Cola, Heineken, Unilever, Bridgestone and Eni Group have factories in town. Within its metropolitan area, at Sarroch,  is one of the six oil refinery supersites in Europe,  Saras.
Tourism is one of the major industries of the city, although historical venues such as its monumental Middle Ages and Early modern period defense system, its Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine ruins  are less highlighted if compared to the recreational beaches and coastline. Cruise ships touring the Mediterranean often make Cagliari a stop off for passengers and the city is a traffic hub to the nearest beaches of Villasimius, Chia, Pula and Costa Rei, and the urban beach of Poettu as well. Pula is home to the archaeological site of the Punic and Roman city of Nora. Especially in summer a lot of clubs and pubs are goals for youth and tourists, pubs and night-clubs are concentrated in the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, a narrow street in Stampace district, Marina district, near to the port and Castello district, as for clubs they are mostly on the Poetto beach (in summer), or in Viale Marconi (in winter).

==Main sights==

The old town (called Castello in Italian, Casteddu de susu in Sardinian, the upper castle) lies on top of a hill, with a view of the Gulf of Cagliari (also known as Angels Gulf). Most of its city walls are intact, and feature the two early 14th-century white limestone towers, the Torre di San Pancrazio and the Torre dell'Elefante; they are both typical examples of Pisan military architecture. The local white limestone was also used to build the walls of the city and many buildings. D. H. Lawrence, in his memoir of a voyage to Sardinia, Sea and Sardinia, undertaken in January 1921, described the effect of the warm Mediterranean sun-light on the white limestone city and compared Cagliari to a "white Jerusalem". The city is said to be built on seven hills (Sant'Elia, Bonaria, Monte Urpinu, Castello, Monte Claro, Tuvixeddu and San Michele).
The Promenade Deck and the Terrazza Umberto I were designed in 1896 by engineer Joseph Costa and Fulgenzio Setti. The entire building is in the classical style, with Corinthian columns, and was built of white and yellow limestone. It was opened in 1901. The staircase with two flights, by which you enter from Constitution Square, is interrupted in a covered walkway, and ends beneath the Arc de Triomphe, in the Terrazza Umberto I. In 1943, during World War II, the staircase and the Arch of Triumph were severely damaged by aerial bombardment, but after the conflict's end they were faithfully reconstructed.
From the Terrazza Umberto I, accessed via a short flight of steps, is the Bastion of Santa Caterina, where there was an old Dominican convent, destroyed by fire in 1800. According to the tradition,  the conspiracy to kill the Viceroy Camarassa in 1666 was set up in the  surroundings of the monastery.
The Promenade Deck was inaugurated in 1902. At first it was used as a banqueting hall, then during the First World War was used as an infirmary. In the thirties, during the period of sanctions, it was an exhibition of autarky. During World War II it served as a shelter for displaced people whose homes had been destroyed by bombs. In 1948 it hosted the first Trade Fair of Sardinia. After many years of decay, the Promenade was restored and re-evaluated as a cultural space reserved especially for art exhibitions.
The Cathedral was restored in the 1930s turning the former Baroque façade into a Medieval Pisan style façade, more akin to the original appearance of the church from the 13th century. The bell tower is original. The interior has a nave and two aisles, with a pulpit (1159–1162) sculpted for the Cathedral of Pisa but later donated to Cagliari. The crypt houses the remains of martyrs found in the Basilica of San Saturno (see below). Near the Cathedral is the palace of the Provincial Government (which used to be the island's governor's palace before 1900). In Castello is also the Sardinian Archaeological Museum, the biggest and most important regarding the prehistoric Nuragic civilisation of Sardinia. Finally, Castello hosts many craftsmen workshops in its tight lanes.
The Palaeo-Christian Basilica of San Saturnino, Dedicated to the martyr killed under Diocletian's reign, Saturninus of Cagliari (patron saint of the city), it was built in the 5th century. Of the original building the central part remain and the dome, to which two arms (one with a nave and two aisles) was added. A Palaeo-Christian crypt is also under the church of San Lucifero (1660), dedicated to Saint Lucifer, a bishop of the city. This has a Baroque façade with ancient columns and sculpted parts, some of which found in the nearby necropolis.
The Chiesa della Purissima is a church from the 16th century. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Bonaria (from which the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina gets its name) was built by the Catalans in 1324–1329 when they were besieging the Pisans in the  Castle. It has a small Gothic portal in the façade while the interior houses a wooden statue of the Madonna, which, after having been  thrown off a Spanish ship, had landed at the foot of the Bonaria hill. The cloister of the convent is home to the Marinery Museum.
The other early districts of the town (Marina, Stampace, Villanova) retain much of their original appeal.
Considerable other remains of the ancient city are still visible at Cagliari, including those of the Roman Amphitheatre, traditionally called Is centu scalas ("One hundred steps"), carved into a block of rock (the typical limestone from which Cagliari is built), and of an aqueduct, used to provide a water in which it is generally scarce. There exist also ancient cisterns of vast extent, the ruins of a small circular temple, and numerous sepulchres on a hill outside the modern town, which appears to have formed the necropolis of the ancient citySmyth's Sardinia, pp. 206, 215Valery, Voyage en Sardaigne, c. 57. The Amphitheatre still stages open-air operas and concerts during the summer.
The districts built in the 1930s have  examples of Art Deco architecture, as well as controversial examples of Fascist neoclassicism, such as the Justice Court (Palazzo di Giustizia) in the Republic Square. The Justice Court is close to the biggest town park, Monte Urpinu, with its pine trees and artificial lakes. The park includes a vast area of a hill. The Orto Botanico dell'Università di Cagliari, the city's botanical garden, is also of interest.

==Culture==

The city has numerous libraries and is also home to the State Archive, containing thousand of handwritten documents from the foundation of the Kingdom of Sardinia (1325 AD) to the present.
In addition to numerous local and university department libraries, the most important libraries are the old University Library,Biblioteche - Direzione regionale beni culturali e paesaggistici della Sardegna with thousands of ancient books, the Provincial Library,Provincia di Cagliari | Biblioteca Provinciale Ragazzi the Regional Library,, http://www.sardegnabiblioteche.it/biblioteche/regionale.html and the Mediateca of the Mediterranean,Comune di Cagliari| MEM - Mediateca del Mediterraneo: Biblioteca Comunale Generale e di Studi Sardi - Archivio Storico - Mediateca which contains the municipal archive and library collection.
In the first century before Christ a famous singer and musician from Cagliari, Tigellius, lived in Rome, and was quoted, not good-naturedly, from Cicero and Horace. The history of the Sardinian literature was born in Cagliari in the first century After Christ; in the funerary monument of Atilia Pomptilla, carved into the rock of the necropolis of Tuvixeddu, poems are engraved in Greek and Latin dedicated to his dead wife by her husband. Some of them, particularly those in the Greek language, have some literary merit.
The first Sardinian literary author known was the Bishop Lucifer of Cagliari, that in the fourth century after Christ, wrote severe pamphlets against the Arian heresy.

===Feast of Sant'Efis===

The Feast of St. Ephysius (Sant'Efisio in Italian, Sant'Efis in Sardinian) is the most important religious procession of Cagliari, taking place every year on May 1. In this festival,  thousands of people of folk groups from all over Sardinia wear their traditional costumes. The Saint is escorted by the traditional ancient Milicia, the Mayor deputy (Alter Nos), numerous confraternities and a convoy of pulled by oxen charriots, till to Nora (near modern Pula), [tpl]convert|35|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from Cagliari, where, according to tradition, the Saint was beheaded. In addition to being one of the oldest is also the longest Italian religious procession, with about [tpl]convert|70|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of walks in 4 days and the largest in the Mediterranean.
A plague  was propagating in Sardinia  since 1652. The epidemic infected Cagliari in particular, killing about ten thousand inhabitants. According to the legend, in 1656 St. Ephysius  appeared to the Spanish Viceroy, Francisco Fernández de Castro Andrade, Count of Lemos to request, in order to liberate the city from the plague, a   procession on 1 May. The Municipality of Cagliari swore that, if the plague disappeared,  a procession would be held every day in the saint's honor, starting from the Stampace district and ending at Nora where the saint was martyred. In September, the  plague ended, and the procession and festival was therefore regularly held starting from the following year on  May 1. The procession was held even during tha last war: tha Saint was charged on a lorry and, through the ruins of the city devastated by the bombs, regurarly arrived in Nora.

===Languages===

The native language of Cagliari is Sardinian (sardu), a Romance language, precisely the Campidanese dialect (campidanesu) in its local variant (casteddaju).
The variant of Cagliari in its high register has traditionally represented the linguistic model of reference for the entire southern area of the island, and the high social variant used by the middle class in the whole Campidanese domain, as well as the literary model of reference for writers and poets.
This language has become less spoken by the new generations in the city, which use Italian due to compulsory education and the means of mass communication.  Italian has increasingly become predominant in social relations, formal but also informal, relegating Sardinian to the role of sociological dialect; young people often have just passive competence, due to their relationship with elderly relatives who still speak it, as their parents too often speak only Italian, or just speak a mixed juvenile slang.
Cagliari was the metropolis of the Roman province, and accepted innovations coming from Rome, Carthage, Constantinople, and probably reflected late Latin urban dialects of the 5th-century core cities of the empire.

===Gastronomy===

Cagliari has some peculiar gastronomic traditions: unlike the rest of the island its cuisine is mostly based on seafood but not only. Many dishes are based on the wide variety of fish and seafood available. Although it is possible to trace influences from Spanish, Sicilian and Genoese cuisine, Cagliaritan food has a distinctive and unique character.

====Drinks====

After the collapse of the traditional parties in the 1990s, the mayors belonged to the party or the coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi.
