[[1992–93 FA Premier League]]

CATEGORIES: Premier League seasons, 1992–93 domestic association football leagues, 1992–93 in English football leagues

The 1992–93 FA Premier League was the first season of the Premier League, the top division of English football. The season began on 15 August 1992 and ended on 11 May 1993. The league was made up of the 22 clubs that broke away from The Football League at the end of the 1991–92 season. The new league was backed up by a five-year, £305 million deal with BSkyB to televise Premier League matches. In concept, the Premier League was identical to the old First Division of the Football League, which was now reduced to three divisions.

===Background===

In May 1992, the breakaway league signed a broadcasting rights contract with British Sky Broadcasting and the BBC valued at £304 million, the largest such agreement in the history of British sport.[tpl]cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F91F3C8ED2DFF10&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 |title=Premier League kicks off with £304m TV deal |first=Peter |last=Ball |work=The Times |accessdate=16 January 2009 |date=19 May 1992 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090301011104/http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F91F3C8ED2DFF10&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815| archivedate= 1 March 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The league's executive committee was unable, however, to secure title sponsorship for the new competition after eight clubs blocked a proposed £13 million deal with brewers Bass.[tpl]cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F91F3C8ED2DFF10&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 |title=Clubs ask Parry to resolve dispute over sponsorship |first=Dennis |last=Signy |work=The Times |accessdate=16 January 2009 |date=18 September 1992 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090301011104/http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F91F3C8ED2DFF10&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815| archivedate= 1 March 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Nonetheless, clubs began to utilise their dramatically increased wealth to fund a series of high-profile transfers.[tpl]cite book|title=The Economics of Football|first=Stephen|last=Dobson|author2=John A.

The structure of the new league was identical to that of the previous season's Football League First Division, comprising 22 teams, with each playing the other 21 twice for a total of 42 matches. Ipswich Town and Middlesbrough had been promoted from the old Second Division as champions and runners-up respectively, and Blackburn Rovers took the third promotion place after winning the 1991–92 Second Division playoff.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1991-92.html|title=England 1991/1992|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=15 January 2009|date=5 June 2004| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090201012024/http://rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1991-92.html| archivedate= 1 February 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Season summary===

The first Premier League title went to Manchester United, the club's first title for 26 years. Manchester United's Premier League title success was achieved with a 10-point lead over runners-up Aston Villa. Villa led the table for much of the season, but their challenge faded in the final weeks of the season and were out of contention three games before the season was over after they lost 1–0 at home to Oldham Athletic. Norwich City led the Premier League at Christmas in the unusual position of having a negative goal difference, their defensive frailties having been highlighted by a 7–1 defeat at Blackburn early in the season. Norwich eventually finished in third place, achieving European qualification in Mike Walker's debut season as manager. Blackburn, in the top division for the first time in almost 30 years, finished in fourth place.
Nottingham Forest's league form had suffered through the sale of key players like Des Walker and Teddy Sheringham, and they were bottom of the Premier League for much of the 1992–93 season. Their relegation was confirmed in early May when they lost to Sheffield United, and manager Brian Clough announced his retirement after 18 years as manager, which had yielded one league title, two European Cups and four League Cups. Next to go were newly promoted Middlesbrough, who fell from mid-table at Christmas to go down in second from bottom place. Last to go down were Crystal Palace, who failed to win their final game of the season which would have instead consigned Oldham Athletic to the final relegation place.

===Managerial changes===

The only manager to be dismissed from his job during the season was Chelsea's Ian Porterfield, who was sacked in February after a string of poor results. Club chairman Ken Bates replaced him on a temporary basis with David Webb, a former Chelsea player who scored the winning goal for the club in the 1970 FA Cup Final.[tpl]cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F91F9642773F623&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 |title=Chelsea appoint Webb to revive glory days |first=Dennis |last=Signy |work=The Times |accessdate=15 January 2009 |date=16 February 1993 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090301015040/http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F91F9642773F623&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815| archivedate= 1 March 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] At the end of the season, Bates opted not to offer a longer contract to Webb and instead appointed former Swindon Town manager Glenn Hoddle.[tpl]cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F91FB0C8C147F62&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 |title=Webb's brief reign brought to an end |first=Keith |last=Pike |work=The Times |accessdate=15 January 2009 |date=12 May 1993 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090301015057/http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F91FB0C8C147F62&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815| archivedate= 1 March 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F91FB86412B765B&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 |title=Hoddle aims to give Chelsea a touch of class |first=John |last=Goodbody |work=The Times |accessdate=15 January 2009 |date=5 June 1993 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090301015113/http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F91FB86412B765B&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815| archivedate= 1 March 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
