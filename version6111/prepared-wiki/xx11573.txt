===Effect on the United States===

In the post-war era, Americans struggled to absorb the lessons of the military intervention.Gerdes (ed). Examining Issues Through Political Cartoons: The Vietnam War pp. 14–15. As General Maxwell Taylor, one of the principal architects of the war, noted, "First, we didn't know ourselves. We thought that we were going into another Korean War, but this was a different country. Secondly, we didn't know our South Vietnamese allies...  And we knew less about North Vietnam.  Who was Ho Chi Minh?  Nobody really knew. So, until we know the enemy and know our allies and know ourselves, we'd better keep out of this kind of dirty business. It's very dangerous."[tpl]Harvnb|Karnow|1997|p=23[/tpl].Taylor paraphrases Sun Tzu, The Art of War, trans. Samuel B. Griffith. Oxford, UK. Oxford University Press, 1963. President Ronald Reagan coined the term "Vietnam Syndrome" to describe the reluctance of the American public and politicians to support further international interventions after Vietnam.
Some have suggested that "the responsibility for the ultimate failure of this policy withdrawal from Vietnam lies not with the men who fought, but with those in Congress..."[tpl]cite web | archiveurl = http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090331152606/http://www.vietnamwar.com/presidentnixonsrole.htm | archivedate = 31 March 2009 | url= http://www.vietnamwar.com/presidentnixonsrole.htm |title= President Richard Nixon's Role in the Vietnam War |publisher= Vietnam War | accessdate =17 October 2009[/tpl]  Alternatively, the official history of the United States Army noted that "tactics have often seemed to exist apart from larger issues, strategies, and objectives. Yet in Vietnam the Army experienced tactical success and strategic failure... The...Vietnam War...legacy may be the lesson that unique historical, political, cultural, and social factors always impinge on the military...Success rests not only on military progress but on correctly analyzing the nature of the particular conflict, understanding the enemy's strategy, and assessing the strengths and weaknesses of allies. A new humility and a new sophistication may form the best parts of a complex heritage left to the Army by the long, bitter war in Vietnam."
U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in a secret memo to president Gerald Ford that "in terms of military tactics, we cannot help draw the conclusion that our armed forces are not suited to this kind of war. Even the Special Forces who had been designed for it could not prevail."[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/exhibits/vietnam/750512a.htm | title = Lessons of Vietnam – Secret Memoranda to The President of the United States by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger | date = ca. 12 May 1975 | page = 3 |accessdate =11 June 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] Even Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara concluded that "the achievement of a military victory by U.S. forces in Vietnam was indeed a dangerous illusion."[tpl]Harvnb|McNamara|1999|p=368[/tpl].
Doubts surfaced as to the effectiveness of large-scale, sustained bombing. As Army Chief of Staff Harold Keith Johnson noted, "if anything came out of Vietnam, it was that air power couldn't do the job."Quoted in Bob Buzzano. [tpl]cite web|url = http://www.commondreams.org/views/041700-106.htm |title = 25 Years After End of Vietnam War, Myths Keep Us from Coming to Terms with Vietnam |accessdate=11 June 2008 |publisher= The Baltimore Sun Times | date = 17 April 2000[/tpl] Even General William Westmoreland admitted that the bombing had been ineffective. As he remarked, "I still doubt that the North Vietnamese would have relented."
The inability to bomb Hanoi to the bargaining table also illustrated another U.S. miscalculation. The North's leadership was composed of hardened communists who had been fighting for thirty years. They had defeated the French, and their tenacity as both nationalists and communists was formidable.  Ho Chi Minh is quoted as saying, "You can kill ten of my men for every one I kill of yours...But even at these odds you will lose and I will win."[tpl]Harvnb|Karnow|1997|p=17[/tpl].
The Vietnam War called into question the U.S. Army doctrine. Marine Corps General Victor H. Krulak heavily criticised Westmoreland's attrition strategy, calling it "wasteful of American lives... with small likelihood of a successful outcome." In addition, doubts surfaced about the ability of the military to train foreign forces.
Between 1965 and 1975, the United States spent $111 billion on the war ($686 billion in FY2008 dollars).[ref]

More than 3 million Americans served in the Vietnam War, some 1.5 million of whom actually saw combat in Vietnam."Echoes of Combat: The Vietnam War in American Memory". Stanford University. James E. Westheider wrote that "At the height of American involvement in 1968, for example, there were 543,000 American military personnel in Vietnam, but only 80,000 were considered combat troops."[tpl]Harvnb|Westheider|2007|p=78[/tpl]. Conscription in the United States had been controlled by the president since World War II, but ended in 1973.
By war's end, 58,220 American soldiers had been killed, more than 150,000 had been wounded, and at least 21,000 had been permanently disabled.The War's Costs[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl].

===Effects of U.S. chemical defoliation===

One of the most controversial aspects of the U.S. military effort in Southeast Asia was the widespread use of chemical defoliants between 1961 and 1971. They were used to defoliate large parts of the countryside to prevent the Viet Cong from being able to hide their weapons and encampments under the foliage. These chemicals continue to change the landscape, cause diseases and birth defects, and poison the food chain.[tpl]Harvnb|Palmer|2007[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvnb|Stone|2007[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|author=Lynne Peeples|date=10 July 2013|title=Veterans Sick From Agent Orange-Poisoned Planes Still Seek Justice|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/agent-orange-vietnam-veterans_n_3572598.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=4 September 2013[/tpl]
Early in the American military effort, it was decided that since the enemy were hiding their activities under triple-canopy jungle, a useful first step might be to defoliate certain areas. This was especially true of growth surrounding bases (both large and small) in what became known as Operation Ranch Hand. Corporations like Dow Chemical Company and Monsanto were given the task of developing herbicides for this purpose. American officials also pointed out that the British had previously used 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D (virtually identical to America's use in Vietnam) on a large scale throughout the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s in order to destroy bushes, crops, and trees in effort to deny communist insurgents the cover they needed to ambush passing convoys.[tpl]cite book |title=The Global Politics of Pesticides: Forging Consensus from Conflicting Interests |page=61 |author=Bruce Cumings |year=1998 |publisher=Earthscan[/tpl] Indeed, Secretary of State Dean Rusk told President John F. Kennedy on November 24, 1961, that "the use of defoliant does not violate any rule of international law concerning the conduct of chemical warfare and is an accepted tactic of war. Precedent has been established by the British during the emergency in Malaya in their use of aircraft for destroying crops by chemical spraying."[tpl]cite web|url=http://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v01/d275 |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1961–1963 Volume I, Vietnam, 1961, Document 275 |publisher=History.state.gov |accessdate=2014-02-24[/tpl]
The defoliants, which were distributed in drums marked with color-coded bands, included the "Rainbow Herbicides"—Agent Pink, Agent Green, Agent Purple, Agent Blue, Agent White, and, most famously, Agent Orange, which included dioxin as a by-product of its manufacture. About 12 million gallons (45,000,000 L) of Agent Orange were sprayed over Southeast Asia during the American involvement.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] A prime area of Ranch Hand operations was in the Mekong Delta, where the U.S. Navy patrol boats were vulnerable to attack from the undergrowth at the water's edge.
In 1961 and 1962, the Kennedy administration authorized the use of chemicals to destroy rice crops. Between 1961 and 1967, the U.S. Air Force sprayed 20 million U.S. gallons (75,700,000 L) of concentrated herbicides over 6 million acres (24,000 km2) of crops and trees, affecting an estimated 13% of South Vietnam's land. In 1965, 42% of all herbicide was sprayed over food crops. Another purpose of herbicide use was to drive civilian populations into RVN-controlled areas.[tpl]Harvnb|Kolko|1985|pp=144–5[/tpl].
Vietnamese victims affected by Agent Orange attempted a class action lawsuit against Dow Chemical and other US chemical manufacturers, but District Court Judge Jack B. Weinstein dismissed their case.[tpl]Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=380[/tpl]. In his 234-page judgment, Weinstein observed: "Despite the fact that Congress and the President were fully advised of a substantial belief that the herbicide spraying in Vietnam was a violation of international law, they acted on their view that it was not a violation at the time." They appealed, but the dismissal was cemented in February 2008 by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.[tpl]Harvnb|Crook|2008[/tpl]. As of 2006, the Vietnamese government estimates that there are over 4,000,000 victims of dioxin poisoning in Vietnam, although the United States government denies any conclusive scientific links between Agent Orange and the Vietnamese victims of dioxin poisoning. In some areas of southern Vietnam, dioxin levels remain at over 100 times the accepted international standard.[tpl]cite web|author=Anthony Faiola|date=13 November 2006|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/12/AR2006111201065.html|title=In Vietnam, Old Foes Take Aim at War's Toxic Legacy|publisher=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=8 September 2013[/tpl]
The U.S. Veterans Administration has listed prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, multiple myeloma, Diabetes mellitus type 2, B-cell lymphomas, soft-tissue sarcoma, chloracne, porphyria cutanea tarda, peripheral neuropathy, and spina bifida in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange.[tpl]cite web|title=Veterans' Diseases Associated with Agent Orange|url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/diseases.asp|publisher=va.gov|accessdate=4 September 2013[/tpl] Although there has been much discussion over whether the use of these defoliants constituted a violation of the laws of war, the defoliants were not considered weapons, since exposure to them did not lead to immediate death or incapacitation.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]

===Casualties===

Estimates of the number of casualties vary, with one source suggesting up to 3.8 million violent war deaths.[tpl]cite news |title=fifty years of violent war deaths: data analysis from the world health survey program: BMJ |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/336/7659/1482| date=23 April 2008|accessdate=5 January 2013[/tpl] From 1955 to 2002, data from the surveys indicated an estimated 5.4 million violent war deaths ... 3.8 million in Vietnam.
195,000–430,000 South Vietnamese civilians died in the war. 50,000–65,000 North Vietnamese civilians died in the war.  The Army of the Republic of Vietnam lost between 171,331 and 220,357 men during the war.[tpl]Harvnb|Thayer|1985|p=106[/tpl]. The official US Department of Defense figure was 950,765 communist forces killed in Vietnam from 1965 to 1974. Defense Department officials believed that these body count figures need to be deflated by 30 percent. In addition, Guenter Lewy assumes that one-third of the reported "enemy" killed may have been civilians, concluding that the actual number of deaths of communist military forces was probably closer to 444,000.  A detailed demographic study calculated 791,000–1,141,000 war-related deaths for all of Vietnam. Between 200,000 and 300,000Sliwinski himself estimates 240,000 wartime deaths, of which 40,000 were caused by U.S. bombing. ([tpl]Harvnb|Sliwinski|1995|p=48[/tpl]). He characterizes other estimates ranging from 600,000–700,000 as "the most extreme evaluations" (p. 42). Cambodians died during the war. About 60,000 Laotians also died,[tpl]Harvnb|Obermeyer|Murray|Gakidou|2008[/tpl]. and 58,220 U.S. service members were killed.

===Popular culture===

The Vietnam War has been featured extensively in television, film, video games, and literature in the participant countries. In American popular culture, the "Crazy Vietnam Veteran", driven mad or otherwise disturbed by his experiences in Vietnam, became a common stock character after the war.
One of the first major films based on the Vietnam War was John Wayne's pro-war film,  The Green Berets (1968). Further cinematic representations were released during the 1970s and 1980s, including Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter (1978), Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979), Oliver Stone's Platoon (1986) — based on his service in the U.S. Military during the Vietnam War, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket (1987), Hamburger Hill (1987), and Casualties of War (1989). Later films would include We Were Soldiers (2002) and Rescue Dawn (2007).
The war also influenced a generation of musicians and songwriters in Vietnam and the United States, both anti-war and pro/anti-communist. The band Country Joe and the Fish recorded "I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag" / The "Fish" Cheer in 1965, and it became one of the most influential anti-Vietnam protest anthems.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Trinh Cong Son was a South Vietnamese songwriter famous for his anti-war songs.
