Sense Field was an American indie rock band from California, formed in 1991 and disbanded in 2004, with reunion shows from 2012 to 2013.

==History==

Formed in 1991, Sense Field was one of several mid-90's post-hardcore and emo bands including Sunny Day Real Estate, Jimmy Eat World and Texas Is the Reason to achieve commercial success, who are largely credited with bringing this style of music to a more mainstream audience. Initially signed to Revelation Records, under whom they released three albums: Sense Field, Killed For Less and Building. They signed with the major label Warner Bros. Records in 1996, however problems within the label caused the band to sit in limbo for five years as the label re-staffed multiple times. The band were eventually released from their contract and Sense Field won the right to re-record the album they had originally written for Warner Bros. The album, Tonight and Forever, was released in September 2001 on the Canadian independent label Nettwerk.
The band experienced their greatest success in 2002 with the single "Save Yourself", initially part of a compilation of tracks for the television show Roswell.[tpl]cite news |author=Carla Hay |title=Sound Tracks |work=Billboard |date=16 Feb 2002 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FBAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14&dq=%22Sense+Field%22+%22Save+Yourself%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-BYZU-m8Mona4ATA8oHgCQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Sense%20Field%22%20%22Save%20Yourself%22&f=false |accessdate=2014-03-06[/tpl] The success of the song allowed the band to perform on late night television shows such as The Tonight Show and The Late Late Show, also seeing the song place on numerous 2002 best-of countdowns. The group quickly followed up the release with the 2003 album Living Outside[tpl]cite news |author=Andrew Bonazelli |title=Reviews: Sense Field - Living Outside |work=CMJ New Music Monthly |date=August 2003 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2ikEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58&dq=%22Sense+Field%22+%22Living+Outside%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=PxsZU5ePFKLm4QT-z4C4CQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Sense%20Field%22%20%22Living%20Outside%22&f=false |accessdate=2014-03-06[/tpl] which became their only album to chart, reaching #37 on U.S. Heatseekers.Billboard, Allmusic
Sense Field disbanded shortly after the release of Living Outside in January 2004, at the culmination of a world tour in support of their fifth and final album.

==Post Break-Up==

Following the demise of Sense Field the band members went on to other outfits.  Jon Bunch became the vocalist of Further Seems Forever.  They released one album with Bunch in the line up before that band also parted ways. In early 2006, Jon Bunch and his Further Seems Forever bandmate Derick Cordoba went on to create Fields Forever, a duo project that plays acoustic versions of Sense Field and Further Seems Forever songs.  Original drummer Scott McPherson became a sought after session player and also was a member of both Elliott Smith and Neil Finn's touring bands.  Rodney Sellars created the shoegaze revivalist outfit, The Year Zero, who released their debut album in mid-2006. Chris Evenson appeared in tandem with The Juliana Theory's Brett Detar for a song under the Belasana moniker which was featured on 2004's "Maybe This Christmas Tree".

==Reunion Shows==

Sense Field reunited for a Revelation Records 25 Year Anniversary Show on Thursday, June 7, 2012 at The Glass House in Pomona, California.
