Promenade (formerly Promenade II)[tpl]cite web|last=Sams|first=Douglas|title=Cousins Properties places bet on Promenade|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/print-edition/2012/01/13/cousins-properties-places-bet-on.html?page=all|work=Atlanta Business Chronicle|accessdate=2/10/2014[/tpl]  is a [tpl]convert|691|ft|m[/tpl] tall skyscraper in Midtown Atlanta.  It has 40 stories of office space and its construction was completed in 1990.  It is currently the seventh-tallest skyscraper in Atlanta.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl]
Set just off Peachtree Street on 15th Street, it sits on the same block as One Atlantic Center and was only the second major office tower in Midtown.  It is set diagonally to the street grid to maximize its impact on the skyline and allow tenants better views. Its postmodern design makes it seem even taller than it really is when viewed up close. It is clad in highly reflective glass and has a ziggurat-like tapering spire with stainless steel fins that are lit at night.  Promenade was intended to be the first of 3 towers of identical design on the block that it occupies.  The two other towers, of 48 and 58 stories, were never built due to the collapse of the commercial real estate market in the early 1990s. Promenade itself was originally planned for [tpl]convert|857|ft|m[/tpl] (57 stories) but was scaled back before completion due to the market collapse. The land they were to occupy is now home to the 41-story 1180 Peachtree Street office tower.
The architectural firms that worked on this project were Thompson, Ventulett, Stainback & Associates (TVS) and the Ai Group.  TVS, which was also responsible for the Concourse at Landmark Center highrise development on Atlanta's northern edge, has its headquarters in the building.  The engineering firm that worked on the Promenade was Thompson Company, Inc. (TCI).  TCI is also responsible for the Concourse at Landmark Center.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl]
