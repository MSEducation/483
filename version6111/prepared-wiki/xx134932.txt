==History==

The frequency rights of Channel 11 in Mega Manila was given to a joint venture of the influential religious groups El Shaddai headed by Mike Velarde and Jesus Is Lord Church headed by Eddie Villanueva in mid 1990s. Conflict of interests started the two groups to contest the full ownership of the company. The Philippine Congress, composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives intervened and awarded to Eddie Villanueva and Jesus Is Lord Movement the right to acquire the frequency held by Channel 11.  Villanueva paid Velarde for the stocks and assets held by Delta Broadcasting System (DBS). 
In the late 1990s, Entertainment Network (Enternet) headed by Benito Araneta and ZOE-TV entered an agreement for TV airtime lease. Enternet leased the morning and afternoon block  by airing CNBC Asia. After two years of airing, the two parties had disagreements on the signed contract, ZOE-TV stopped airing CNBC Asia and Enternet bolted out and filed a case on Villanueva. 
In 2001, ZOE-TV became the first TV station to air the second EDSA Revolution. In 2004, Villanueva resigned as Chairman on ZOE TV to run for Philippine President. After ending in the last position in the election, Villanueva regained the chairmanship and continued his TV talk shows on ZOE.
In the first quarter of 2005, Citynet Television, a subsidiary of GMA Network, Inc., and ZOE-TV entered to an agreement for Citynet leasing the entire TV airtime block of the station in exchange of an upgrading the facilities of ZOE and a ZOE-TV program on GMA Network every Monday midnight after its Sunday primetime block.
