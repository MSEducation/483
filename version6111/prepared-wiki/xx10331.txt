==Design==

The subject of road design is considered part of highway engineering. Structural road design is the science of designing a road for its environment in order to extend its longevity and reduce maintenance. The Shell pavement design method is used in many countries for the design of new asphalt roads.

==Construction==

Road construction requires the creation of a continuous right-of-way, overcoming geographic obstacles and having grades low enough to permit vehicle or foot travel.[tpl]cite web  | title = Kitsap County Road Standards 2006   | work =   | publisher = Kitsap County, Washington  | year = 2006  | url = http://www.kitsapgov.com/PW/pdf/Revised%20Road%20Standards.doc  | format = Doc | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-04-20 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] (pg15) and may be required to meet standards set by law[tpl]cite web  | title = Washington State County Road Standards  | work = Chapter 35.78 RCW requires cities and counties to adopt uniform definitions and design standards for municipal streets and roads  | publisher = Municipal Research & Services Center of Washington  | year = 2005  | url = http://www.mrsc.org/subjects/Transpo/stand/CoRdStand.aspx  | accessdate = 2007-04-20 [/tpl] or official guidelines.[tpl]cite web   | last = Shire of Wyndham East Kimberly | first =  | title = Guidelines for rural road design and construction technical specifications  | work = | publisher = Western Australia (The Last Frontier) |date=October 2006  | url = http://www.thelastfrontier.com.au/Publications/06K027005-061019-Rural%20Road%20Technical%20Specification%20complete%20(3).pdf  | format = PDF  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-04-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070710022035/http://www.thelastfrontier.com.au/Publications/06K027005-061019-Rural+Road+Technical+Specification+complete+(3).pdf  |archivedate = 2007-07-10[/tpl]  The process is often begun with the removal of earth and rock by digging or blasting, construction of embankments, bridges and tunnels, and removal of vegetation (this may involve deforestation) and followed by the laying of pavement material.

After design, approval, planning, legal and environmental considerations have been addressed alignment of the road is set out by a surveyor.[tpl]cite web  | last = Hart-Davis  | first = Adam   | title = Roads and surveying  | work = Discovering Roman Technology  | publisher = BBC.CO.UK  | date = 2001-06-01  | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/tech_02.shtml  | accessdate = 2007-04-22 [/tpl] The radii and gradient are designed and staked out to best suit the natural ground levels and minimize the amount of cut and fill. (page34) Great care is taken to preserve reference Benchmarks  (page59)
Roads are designed and built for primary use by vehicular and pedestrian traffic.  Storm drainage and environmental considerations are a major concern.  Erosion and sediment controls are constructed to prevent detrimental effects.  Drainage lines are laid with sealed joints in the road easement with runoff coefficients and characteristics adequate for the land zoning and storm water system.  Drainage systems must be capable of carrying the ultimate design flow from the upstream catchment with approval for the outfall from the appropriate authority to a watercourse, creek, river or the sea for drainage discharge. (page38 to 40)
A borrow pit (source for obtaining fill, gravel, and rock) and a water source should be located near or in reasonable distance to the road construction site. Approval from local authorities may be required to draw water or for working (crushing and screening) of materials for construction needs. The top soil and vegetation is removed from the borrow pit and stockpiled for subsequent rehabilitation of the extraction area. Side slopes in the excavation area not steeper than one vertical to two horizontal for safety reasons. (page 53 to 56 )
Old road surfaces, fences, and buildings may need to be removed before construction can begin.  Trees in the road construction area may be marked for retention. These protected trees should not have the topsoil within the area of the tree's drip line removed and the area should be kept clear of construction material and equipment. Compensation or replacement may be required if a protected tree is damaged. Much of the vegetation may be mulched and put aside for use during reinstatement. The topsoil is usually stripped and stockpiled nearby for rehabilitation of newly constructed embankments along the road. Stumps and roots are removed and holes filled as required before the earthwork begins. Final rehabilitation after road construction is completed will include seeding, planting, watering and other activities to reinstate the area to be consistent with the untouched surrounding areas. (page 66 to 67 )
Processes during earthwork include excavation, removal of material to spoil, filling, compacting, construction and trimming. If rock or other unsuitable material is discovered it is removed, moisture content is managed and replaced with standard fill compacted to meet the design requirements (generally 90-95% relative compaction).  Blasting is not frequently used to excavate the road bed as the intact rock structure forms an ideal road base. When a depression must be filled to come up to the road grade the native bed is compacted after the topsoil has been removed. The fill is made by the "compacted layer method" where a layer of fill is spread then compacted to specifications, the process is repeated until the desired grade is reached. (page 68 to 69 ).
General fill material should be free of organics, meet minimum California bearing ratio (CBR) results and have a low plasticity index. The lower fill generally comprises sand or a sand-rich mixture with fine gravel, which acts as an inhibitor to the growth of plants or other vegetable matter. The compacted fill also serves as lower-stratum drainage. Select second fill (sieved) should be composed of gravel, decomposed rock or broken rock below a specified Particle size and be free of large lumps of clay. Sand clay fill may also be used.  The road bed must be "proof rolled" after each layer of fill is compacted.  If a roller passes over an area without creating visible deformation or spring the section is deemed to comply. (page 70 to 72 )
Geosynthetics such as geotextiles, geogrids and geocells are frequently used in the various pavement layers to improve road quality. Geosynthetics perform four main functions in roads: separation, reinforcement, filtration and drainage; which increase the pavement performance, reduce construction costs and decrease maintenance.Koerner, R. M. (2012) Designing with geosynthetics, 6th Edition, Xlibris Corporation, USA
The completed road way is finished by paving or left with a gravel or other natural surface. The type of road surface is dependent on economic factors and expected usage. Safety improvements like Traffic signs, Crash barriers, Raised pavement markers, and other forms of Road surface marking are installed.
According to a May 2009 report by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and TRIP—a national transportation research organization—driving on rough roads costs the average American motorist approximately $400 a year in extra vehicle operating costs. Drivers living in urban areas with populations more than 250,000 are paying upwards of $750 more annually because of accelerated vehicle deterioration, increased maintenance, additional fuel consumption, and tire wear caused by poor road conditions.
When a single carriageway road is converted into dual carriageway by building a second separate carriageway alongside the first, it is usually referred to as duplication,Glossary: Princes Highway, Traralgon Bypass - Planning Assessment Report at The State of Victoria twinning or doubling.  The original carriageway is changed from two-way to become one-way, while the new carriageway is one-way in the opposite direction. In the same way as converting railway lines from single track to double track, the new carriageway is not always constructed directly alongside the existing carriageway.

==Maintenance==

Like all structures, roads deteriorate over time. Deterioration is primarily due to accumulated damage from vehicles, however environmental effects such as frost heaves, thermal cracking and oxidation often contribute.[tpl]cite web  |author=S.Kameyama, M.

Potholes on roads are caused by rain damage and vehicle braking or related construction works.
Pavements are designed for an expected service life or design life.  In some parts of the United Kingdom the standard design life is 40 years for new bitumen and concrete pavement.  Maintenance is considered in the whole life cost of the road with service at 10, 20 and 30 year milestones.[tpl]cite book  | last = O'Flaherty  | first = Coleman A. | title = Highways: The Location, Design, Construction & Maintenance of Road Pavements  | publisher = Elsevier  | year = 2002  | pages = 252    | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Ren4sWQ3jKkC&pg=PA252&dq=Pavements+are+designed+for+an+expected+service+life | isbn = 0-7506-5090-7 [/tpl]  Roads can be and are designed for a variety of lives (8-, 15-, 30-, and 60-year designs). When pavement lasts longer than its intended life, it may have been overbuilt, and the original costs may have been too high. When a pavement fails before its intended design life, the owner may have excessive repair and rehabilitation costs.  Some asphalt pavements are designed as perpetual pavements with an expected structural life in excess of 50 years.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Newcomb | first1 = David E. | last2 = Willis | first2 = Richard | last3 = Timm | first3 = David H. | title = Perpetual Asphalt Pavements: A Synthesis | publisher = Asphalt Pavement Alliance | date = 28 March 2010 | location = Lanham, Maryland | url = http://asphaltroads.org/images/documents/Perpetual_Pavement_Synthesis.pdf | accessdate = 2013-01-22[/tpl]

Virtually all roads require some form of maintenance before they come to the end of their service life. Pro-active agencies use pavement management techniques to continually monitor road conditions and schedule preventive maintenance treatments as needed to prolong the lifespan of their roads. Technically advanced agencies monitor the road network surface condition with sophisticated equipment such as laser/inertial Profilometers. These measurements include road curvature, cross slope, asperity, roughness, rutting and texture. This data is fed into a pavement management system, which recommends the best maintenance or construction treatment to correct the damage that has occurred.
Maintenance treatments for asphalt concrete generally include thin asphalt overlays, crack sealing, surface rejuvenating, fog sealing, micro milling or diamond grinding and surface treatments. Thin surfacing preserves, protects and improves the functional condition of the road while reducing the need for routing maintenance, leading to extended service life without increasing structural capacity.[tpl]cite web  |author=Ludomir Uzarowski, Michael Maher and Gary Farrington, Golder Associates Ltd. | title = Thin Surfacing - Effective Way of Improving Road Safety within Scarce Road Maintenance Budget  | work = Paper for presentation at the 2005 Annual Conference of the Transportation Association of Canada in Calgary, Alberta  | publisher = Transportation Association of Canada  | year = 2005  | url = http://www.tac-atc.ca/english/pdf/conf2005/s16/uzarowski2.pdf | format = PDF  | accessdate = 2007-05-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080407011631/http://www.tac-atc.ca/english/pdf/conf2005/s16/uzarowski2.pdf  |archivedate = 2008-04-07[/tpl]
Maintenance for the older concrete pavements that develop faults includes the technique called dowel bar retrofit. This involves cutting slots in the pavement at each joint, placing dowel bars in the slots, then filling them with concrete patching material. This method can extend the life of the concrete pavement for another 15 years.[tpl]cite web|title=Dowel Bars for New  and Existing Concrete  Pavements|url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/43EF56B4-68AB-4465-87AC-A29826132144/0/DowelBarsfolio_Feb2013Final.pdf|publisher=Washington State Department of Transporation|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Failure to maintain roads properly can create significant costs to society, in a 2009 report released by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (USA) about 50% of the roads in the USA are in bad condition with urban areas worse. The report estimates that urban drivers pay an average of $746/year on vehicle repairs while the average US motorist pays about $335/year. In contrast, the average motorist pays about $171/year in road maintenance taxes (based on 600 gallons/year and $0.285/gallon tax).

===Slab stabilization===

Distress and serviceability loss on concrete roads can be caused by loss of support due to voids beneath the concrete pavement slabs. The voids usually occur near cracks or joints due to surface water infiltration. The most common causes of voids are pumping, consolidation, subgrade failure and bridge approach failure. Slab stabilization is a non-destructive method of solving this problem and is usually employed with other Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR)  methods including patching and diamond grinding. The technique restores support to concrete slabs by filing small voids that develop underneath the concrete slab at joints, cracks or the pavement edge.
The process consists of pumping a cementitous grout or polyurethane mixture through holes drilled through the slab. The grout can fill small voids beneath the slab and/or sub-base. The grout also displaces free water and helps keep water from saturating and weakening support under the joints and slab edge after stabilization is complete. The three steps for this method after finding the voids are locating and drilling holes, grout injection and post-testing the stabilized slabs.
Slab stabilization does not correct depressions, increase the design structural capacity, stop erosion or eliminate faulting. It does, however, restore the slab support, therefore, decreasing deflections under the load. Stabilization should only be performed at joints and cracks where loss of support exists. Visual inspection is the simplest manner to find voids. Signs that repair is needed are transverse joint faulting, corner breaks and shoulder drop off and lines at or near joints and cracks. Deflection testing is another common procedure utilized to locate voids. It is recommended to do this testing at night as during cooler temperatures, joints open, aggregate interlock diminishes and load deflections are at their highest.

===Testing===

Ground penetrating radar pulses electromagnetic waves into the pavement and measures and graphically displays the reflected signal. This can reveal voids and other defects.
The epoxy/core test, detects voids by visual and mechanical methods. It consists of drilling a 25 to 50 millimeter hole through the pavement into the sub-base with a dry-bit roto-hammer. Next, a two-part epoxy is poured into the hole—dyed for visual clarity. Once the epoxy hardens, technicians drill through the hole. If a void is present, the epoxy will stick to the core and provide physical evidence.
Common stabilization materials include pozzolan-cement grout and polyurethane. The requirements for slab stabilization are strength and the ability to flow into or expand to fill small voids. Colloidal mixing equipment is necessary to use the pozzolan-cement grouts. The contractor must place the grout using a positive-displacement injection pump or a non-pulsing progressive cavity pump. A drill is also necessary but it must produce a clean hole with no surface spalling or breakouts. The injection devices must include a grout packer capable of sealing the hole. The injection device must also have a return hose or a fast-control reverse switch, in case workers detect slab movement on the uplift gauge. The uplift beam helps to monitor the slab deflection and has to have sensitive dial gauges.

June 2005. Better Roads.

===Joint sealing===

Also called joint and crack repair, this method’s purpose is to minimize infiltration of surface water and incompressible material into the joint system. Joint sealants are also used to reduce dowel bar corrosion in Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR)  techniques. Successful resealing consists of old sealant removal, shaping and cleaning the reservoir, installing the backer rod and installing the sealant. Sawing, manual removal, plowing and cutting are methods used to remove the old sealant. Saws are used to shape the reservoir. When cleaning the reservoir, no dust, dirt or traces of old sealant should remain. Thus, it is recommended to water wash, sand-blast and then air blow to remove any sand, dirt or dust. The backer rod installation requires a double-wheeled, steel roller to insert the rod to the desired depth. After inserting the backer rod, the sealant is placed into the joint. There are various materials to choose for this method including hot pour bituminous liquid, silicone and preformed compression seals.http://www.igga.net/File/Minimize-Wheel-Slap-Keep-Your-Joints-Narrow-_2004.pdf IGGAHow States Preserve Concrete Pavements: CPR pays off in extra pavement life.

==Safety considerations==

Careful design and construction of roads can increase road traffic safety and reduce the harm (deaths, injuries, and property damage) on the highway system from traffic collisions.
On neighborhood roads traffic calming, safety barriers, pedestrian crossings and cycle lanes can all protect pedestrians and cyclists.
Lane markers in some countries and states are marked with Cat's eyes or Botts dots, bright reflectors that do not fade like paint. Botts dots are not used where it is icy in the winter, because frost and snowplows can break the glue that holds them to the road, although they can be embedded in short, shallow trenches carved in the roadway, as is done in the mountainous regions of California.
For major roads risk can be reduced by providing limited access from properties and local roads, grade separated junctions and median dividers between opposite-direction traffic to reduce likelihood of head-on collisions.
The placement of energy attenuation devices (e.g. guardrails, wide grassy areas, sand barrels) is also common. Some road fixtures such as road signs and fire hydrants are designed to collapse on impact. Light poles are designed to break at the base rather than violently stop a car that hits them. Highway authorities may also remove larger trees from the immediate vicinity of the road.

==Environmental performance==

Careful design and construction of a road can reduce any negative environmental impacts.
Water management systems can be used to reduce the effect of pollutants from roads.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] Rainwater and snowmelt running off of roads tends to pick up gasoline, motor oil, heavy metals, trash and other pollutants and result in Water pollution.  Road runoff is a major source of nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are created as combustion byproducts of gasoline and other fossil fuels.[tpl]cite book|title=Stormwater Effects Handbook: A Toolbox for Watershed Managers, Scientists, and Engineers|publisher=CRC/Lewis Publishers|location=New York|year=2001|isbn=0-87371-924-7|url=http://unix.eng.ua.edu/~rpitt/Publications/BooksandReports/Stormwater%20Effects%20Handbook%20by%20%20Burton%20and%20Pitt%20book/MainEDFS_Book.html|author=G.

Roads are a chief source of environmental noise generation. In the early 1970s it was recognized that design of roads can be conducted to influence and minimize noise generation.C.Michael Hogan,  Analysis of highway noise, Journal of Water, Air, & Soil Pollution, Volume 2, Number 3, Biomedical and Life Sciences and Earth and Environmental Science Issue, Pages 387-392, September, 1973, Springer Verlag, Netherlands ISSN 0049-6979 Noise barriers are used to reduce noise pollution, in particular where roads are located close to built-up areas. Regulations can restrict the use of engine braking.
Motor vehicle emissions contribute air pollution. Concentrations of air pollutants and adverse respiratory health effects are greater near the road than at some distance away from the road. Road dust kicked up by vehicles may trigger allergic reactions."Road Dust - Something To Sneeze About." Science Daily, 1999-11-30. In addition, on-road transportation greenhouse gas emissions are the largest single cause of climate change, scientists say.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/107/8/3382 |title=Attribution of climate forcing to economic sectors |publisher=Pnas.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl]
