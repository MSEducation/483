[[Secrets of the Muse]]

CATEGORIES: 1997 albums

Secrets of the Muse is an album by Jordan Rudess recorded and released in 1997.
The album is composed entirely of improvisations on various synthesizers.  Improvisation is something that Rudess is well acquainted with, as seen in 4NYC and Christmas Sky both released in 2002.  The sound of the album is different from most of Rudess' carefully composed pieces as it takes on a slower, softer, more gentle approach.
