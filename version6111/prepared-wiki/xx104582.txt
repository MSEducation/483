In fall 2010, BRITA’s United Kingdom branch collaborated with fashion designer Orla Kiely to support the Breast Cancer Care Charity, which provides professional support and expert information to those affected by breast cancer. The partnership released a limited-edition Hydration Pack containing a water filter jug, three filter cartridges; and a reusable water bottle designed by Kiely and made of 100 percent recycled materials. For every pack sold, BRITA donated £1 to the Breast Cancer Care Charity.Mattu, J. (2010, October 7). BRITA and Orla Kielys hot pink collaboration.

The owner  of BRITA, Markus Hankammer, is the chairman of German 3rd Liga club SV Wehen Wiesbaden. When Heinz Hankammer was the owner, he promised them that if they were promoted to the 2.Fußball-Bundesliga he would build them a new stadium in Wiesbaden. They did, and hence the BRITA-Arena was built. BRITA is sponsored all over the stadium as well as on the shirt. Markus Hankammer is now the chairman, as his father, Heinz Hankammer, retired.
