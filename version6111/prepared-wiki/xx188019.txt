==Operations==

In the early 1950s its routes were Paris - Tunis - Damascus - Karachi - Bangkok - Saigon - Hanoi, Paris - Algiers - Fort Lamy (now N'Djamena) - Douala - Brazzaville - Tananarive (Antananarivo), Paris - Casablanca - Bamako - Abidjan, and Paris - Casablanca - Bamako - Dakar.
By 1957 the route continued beyond Saigon to Darwin, Brisbane, Noumea, and Auckland. As the airport for Tahiti began construction, T.A.I. began to fly to Bora Bora on the Society Islands in French Polynesia in 1958. Until the Tahiti airport opened in 1960 the island was served by TAI Short Solent flying boats.Davies, p. 278
In the late 1950s the airline flew Sud-Est Armagnac, Douglas DC-4s and Douglas DC-6s having a light green livery with white cabin top and fin. They bought their first Douglas DC-8 jet airliners during 1960. The company extended its service to Jakarta in Indonesia. The livery changed to an attractive yellow, green, and black striped tail with "T.A.I." on it, and a green stripe down the fuselage. The February 1959 OAG shows eleven departures a week from Orly: seven DC-6Bs to mainland Africa, two to Tananarive, one to Auckland and one DC-7C to Djakarta.
Millions of revenue passenger-kilometers, scheduled flights only: 300 in 1957 and 369 in 1960.
