Vampire Lesbians of Sodom is a satirical play written by Charles Busch. It features a series of vignettes that deals with the lives of two eponymous immortal vampire lesbians, a creature known as The Succubus who is also known as La Condessa or Magda Legerdemaine, and the virgin-turned-vampire who becomes known as Madelaine Astarte and Madelaine Andrews. The two are locked in eternal, if comic, antagonism after surviving the downfall of the mythical Biblical city in question. Particular conflict occurs when both women arrive in 1920s/1930s Broadway and Hollywood and masquerade as silent film stars. A final scene in Las Vegas in the 1980s sees them finally reach a truce.
