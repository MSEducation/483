Yuvan Shankar did his schooling at St. Bede's Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School in Chennai,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2008/01/26/stories/2008012651870600.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Of memories and a milestone | date=26 January 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/11/25/stories/2007112551270200.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Alumni invited to St. Bede's centenary celebrations | date=25 November 2007[/tpl] and discontinued his education after his tenth class.

P. Balasubrahmanyam and P. Susheela.

==Career==

===Film score and soundtracks===

====Early years (1997–2000)====

In 1996, following his mother's suggestion to take up music as a profession, Yuvan Shankar Raja started composing tunes for an album.[tpl]cite web|title=Yuvan Shankar Raja's Profile|url=http://www.ssmusic.tv/artist_profile.php?Opt=1&Language=&artId=20071100001|publisher=S S Music|accessdate=5 March 2010[/tpl] It was then that T. Siva, the producer of the Tamil language film Aravindhan, after hearing some of the tunes, asked to compose a trailer music. As the producer was so much impressed of which, he gave Yuvan Shankar the assignment to compose the entire film score including a soundtrack for that film. After consulting and getting consent from his parents, he accepted the offer; his music career started. His entry into the Tamil film and music industry had happened at age 16, thus becoming one of the most youngest composers ever in the industry, which, he says, was "purely accidental".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tfmpage.com/forum/archives/20550.03.13.03.html|title=YSR in London|publisher=tfmpage.com|accessdate=4 April 2009[/tpl]
However, both the soundtrack album as well as the film itself failed to attract audiences and to do well and Yuvan Shankar Raja's following projects Velai (1998) and Kalyana Galatta (1998) were not successful either; his compositions for these films did not receive good reviews or responses,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nilacharal.com/enter/review/ilayaraja.html|title=Masterpieces of Ilayaraja|publisher=nilacharal.com|accessdate=4 April 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.planetradiocity.com/musicopedia/music_director.php?Director=Yuvan%20Shankar%20Raja&conid=3288 |title=Yuvan Shankar Raja | Music Directors | Music Composers |publisher=Planetradiocity.com |date=31 August 1979 |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl] with one reviewer labelling the music and re-recording in the latter as "cacophony" and "poor".[tpl]cite web|url=http://indolink.com/tamil/cinema/Reviews/articles/KalyaaNa_Galaattaa_8242.html |title=KalyaaNa Galaattaa: Movie Review |publisher=Indolink.com |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl] The failures of his first projects caused that he was not offered any film projects and assignments subsequently.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2003/10/22/stories/2003102200060100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Generation NEXT | date=22 October 2003[/tpl] During this time of struggling, he was approached and assigned by director Vasanth to compose the music for his film Poovellam Kettuppar (1999). The soundtrack received very positive response, bring described as "fresh" and "different", with a critic from The New Indian Express citing that his "absolutely enchanting musical score ... bears testimony to his 'Raja' surname."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/art.nsf/(docid)/A194789BC4D9414965256941003DC8A7 |title=A mad, mad spin – The New Indian Express |publisher=Cscsarchive.org:8081 |date=29 November 1999 |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl] The album became very popular, particularly songs like "Irava Pagala" and "Chudithar Aninthu", gaining him first time notice, especially among young people and children.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/art.nsf/(docid)/D585681E7E02040365256940004D0E19 |title=Cinema – The Hindu |publisher=Cscsarchive.org:8081 |date=20 August 1999 |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl] The album would make possible his first breakthrough in the industry and proved to be a major turning point in his career. After working for two Sundar C. films, Unakkaga Ellam Unakkaga (1999) and Rishi (2000), which both fared averagely at the box office, he got to work for A. R. Murugadoss' directorial debut in 2000, the action flick Dheena starring Ajith Kumar, which went on to become a blockbuster and Yuvan Shankar Raja's first major successful film.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nilacharal.com/enter/review/ilayaraja.html |title=A Tamil entertainment ezine presenting interesting contents and useful services |publisher=Nilacharal |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl] Yuvan Shankar's songs were equally successful,[tpl]cite web|url=http://sify.com/movies/tamil/fullstory.php?id=14873661|title=Harris out, Yuvan in!|publisher=Sify|accessdate=5 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/41592.html|title=Ajith's 'Aegan' audio on October|publisher=IndiaGlitz|accessdate=5 March 2010[/tpl] which are considered to have played a major role for the film's great success.[tpl]cite web|title=Asal music director: Yuvanshankar Raja|url=http://www.tamilwire.com/21329-asal-music-director-yuvanshankar.html|publisher=tamilwire.com|accessdate=5 March 2010[/tpl] while his background score in the film was also well appreciated.

====Rise to prominence (2001–2003)====

Thanks to this film's enormous success, he eventually broke into the Tamil music scene as offers were pouring in subsequently. He was mainly approached by many young new directors. In 2001 he had three album releases, the first being Thulluvadho Ilamai, collaborating with Selvaraghavan for the first time.The film was directed by Kasthuri Raja, but his son Selvaraghavan wrote the script and worked with Yuvan Shankar Raja for the film's soundtrack album The soundtrack album of Thulluvadho Ilamai particularly appealed to the younger generation. The film itself, marking the debut of Selvaraghavan's brother Dhanush, released one year later and became a sleeper hit at the Chennai box office.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nanjilonline.com/music/kadhalkondaen_rev.asp |title=Kadhal Kondaen Music Review |publisher=NanjilOnline.com |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thiraipadam.com/cgi-bin/movie_review.pl?id=408&user_name=bbalaji&review_lang=english&lang=english |title=Kadhal Konden – Tamil Movie Review |publisher=Thiraipadam.com |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl] This was followed by Bala's Nandha (2001), for which he received rave reviews. He then gained notice by churning out "youthful music" in the college-life based April Maadhathil (2002), the romantic comedy films Kadhal Samrajyam (2002),The film was never released theatrically, the soundtrack was released in 2002 and Mounam Pesiyadhe (2002), Ameer's directorial debut film, and the triangular love story Punnagai Poove (2002), in which he also made his on-screen debut, appearing in some scenes and one song sequence.http://archives.chennaionline.com/interviews/yuvan.asp At the same time he made his Telugu debut with Seshu and Malli Malli Chudali and also composed for the Tamil films Junior Senior and Pop Carn, starring Malayalam actors Mammootty and Mohan Lal, respectively, all of which performing poorly at the box offices, though.
In 2003 Selvaraghavan's first independent directorial, the drama-thriller film Kaadhal Kondein released, which is considered a milestone for Yuvan Shankar Raja.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2005/feb/08spice.htm |title=Jaya bats for Tamil film industry |publisher=Rediff|date=8 February 2005 |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl] His work in the film, particularly his background score, was unanimously praised, leading to the release of a separate CD consisting of several film score pieces, a la "Hollywood-style", which was reportedly the first film score CD release in India. Furthermore, the film went on to become a blockbuster, cementing the film's lead artist Dhanush and Yuvan Shankar in the Tamil film and music industry.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2003/10/27/stories/2003102700060300.htm|title=Generation NEXT|work=The Hindu |accessdate=31 August 2009|location=Chennai, India|date=27 October 2003[/tpl] The same year, he worked in Vishnuvardhan's debut film, Kurumbu, which featured the first remix song in a Tamil film. By that time, in a career spanning less than a decade, Yuvan Shankar Raja had established himself as one of the leading and most-sought after music directors in the Tamil film industry, despite having worked predominantly with newcomers and in low-budget productions.

====Success (2004–2007)====

In 2007, he had a record ten album releases in one year. The first was the soundtrack of the romantic drama film Deepavali, following which the audios of the sports comedy film Chennai 600028, the Telugu family entertainer Aadavari Matalaku Ardhalu Verule, Vasanth's bilingual thriller film Satham Podathey (Kelkaatha Shabdam in Malayalam) and the romantic films Thottal Poo Malarum and Kannamoochi Yenada released, with the former three being well-received besides garnering positive reviews. The films, Chennai 600028, Venkat Prabhu's directorial debut, and Aadavari Matalaku Ardhalu Verule, Selvaraghavan's Telugu debut, in particular, were high commercial successes and became one of the year's most successful films in Tamil and Telugu, respectively. In late 2007 then, the audio and the film Kattradhu Thamizh got released. The soundtrack album, which was released as Tamil M. A., as well as the film itself, had been met with exceptionally positive reviews and critical acclaim. The music was widely considered a "musical sensation" and noted to be a proof of Yuvan Shankar Raja's "composing skills".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.musicindiaonline.com/ar/i/movie_name/9327/0/ | title=Audio Review : Tamil M A – Yuvan's symphonies shine through! | publisher=musicindiaonline.com | accessdate=6 December 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/oct/03sssouth.htm |title=Thamizh M.A – Music review |publisher=Rediff|accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Karthik |url=http://itwofs.com/milliblog/2007/09/11/tamil-ma-tamil-yuvan-shankar-raja/ |title=Tamil M.A (Tamil – Yuvan Shankar Raja) by Milliblog! |publisher=Itwofs.com |date=11 September 2007 |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl] However, despite outstanding reviews by critics, the venture failed to evoke the interest of the audience and did not enjoy much popularity. His final release of 2007 was Billa, a remake of the 1980 Rajinikanth-starrer of the same title. This film, remade by Vishnuvardhan, starring Ajith Kumar in the title role, also featured two remixes from the original version.

====Recent work (2008–present)====

In 2008, five films, featuring Yuvan's music were released, two of them being the Tamil and Kannada remakes of Aadavari Matalaku Ardhalu Verule, titled Yaaradi Nee Mohini and Anthu Inthu Preethi Banthu, respectively, which partly featured the original score and songs. The Tamil version, in particular, was able to repeat the success of the original film, emerging a high commercial success, while yielding Yuvan his second Filmfare nomination. The other releases that year include Seeman's Vaazhthugal, Venkat Prabhu's comedy-thriller Saroja, Ajith Kumar's action thriller Aegan and Silambarasan Rajendar's masala flick Silambattam, out of which, Saroja and Silambattam proved to be successful at the box office, with Yuvan Shankar's score in the former and his songs in the latter garnering accolades and several awards at the 2009 Isaiyaruvi Tamil Music Awards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mirchigossips.com/music/isayaruvi-music-awards-2008/ |title=Isayaruvi Sunfeast Tamil Music Awards 2008 | mirchigossips.in |publisher=Mirchigossips.com |date=11 July 2008 |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl] In 2009, nine of his soundtrack albums released. Excluding the romantic comedy Siva Manasula Sakthi, featuring his most popular song of the year "Oru Kal Oru Kannadi", all other films failed at the box office. Besides "Oru Kal", the songs "Siragual" (Sarvam) and "Aedho Saigiral" (Vaamanan) also became popular.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sify.com/movies/kollywood-top-10-songs-of-2009-news-tamil-kkfrdNecfdb.html |title=Kollywood- Top 10 Songs of 2009|publisher=Sify |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/jan/04/slide-show-1-top-tamil-albums-of-2009.htm |title=Top Tamil Albums of 2009 – Rediff.com Movies |publisher=Movies.rediff.com |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl] He had provided a rural score again in Kunguma Poovum Konjum Puravum and a sarangi-based score for the urban action drama of Ameer's Yogi.

In late 2009, the soundtrack album of Paiyaa released, which was regarded as a "blockbuster album" and "magnum opus",[tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/jun/23/slide-show-1-south-half-year-report-of-tamil-cinema.htm |title=Half-yearly BO report: Suriya rules Tamil – Rediff.com Movies |publisher=Movies.rediff.com |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.top10cinema.com/feature/5081/kaadhal-solla-vandhen-music-review |title=Kaadhal Solla Vandhen – Music Review | Articles – Features |publisher=Top 10 Cinema |date=17 June 2010 |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl] as it went on to become exceptionally popular, much prior to the film's release,http://www.deccanchronicle.com/tabloids/paiya’s-songs-turn-chartbuster-065 and probably one of Yuvan Shankar Raja's biggest success of his career. The song "Thuli Thuli" had become the first Tamil song to be featured in the India Top 20 list for April 2010, indicating that it was the most frequently played Tamil song on all Indian FM radio stations in the history of Tamil film music.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-06-01/news-and-interviews/28277283_1_song-music-industry-paiyaa|title=Yuvan's musical magic!|work=The Times of India|accessdate=1 June 2010|first1=Sreedhar|last1=Pillai|date=1 June 2010[/tpl] The film itself became one the highest earners of the year, particularly supported by Yuvan's score and songs. Along with Paiyaa, songs from three more films for which he composed music that year – Naan Mahaan Alla, Baana Kaathadi and Boss Engira Bhaskaran – featured among the Top 10 chartbusters of the year. In early 2010 he composed his first Bollywood song "Haq Se" as part of the ensemble soundtrack of the film Striker, starring his close friend Siddharth, which received thoroughly positive reviews. In 2011, he teamed up with Silambarasan again for the anthology film Vaanam, with the song "Evan Di Unna Pethan" from the album, that was released as a single, gaining popularity. His next film was Bala's Avan Ivan; Yuvan's songs generally fetched positive reviews.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/music-review-avan-ivan/20110512.htm |title=Review: Avan Ivan's music is impressive |publisher=Rediff|date=12 May 2011 |accessdate=13 July 2012[/tpl] He next composed a score that drew influence from several world music styles for the critically acclaimed independent gangster film Aaranya Kaandam,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/south-review-aaranya-kaandam/20110610.htm |title=Review: Aaranya Kaandam bypasses gangster cliches |publisher=Rediff|date=10 June 2011 |accessdate=13 July 2012[/tpl] winning high praise from critics.[tpl]cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/tamil/Aaranya-Kaandam/movie-review/8825713.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Aaranya Kaandam – The Times of India[/tpl] He went on to work in Venkat Prabhu's action thriller Mankatha, his biggest project till date, and Vishnuvardhan's first Telugu venture Panjaa. His last two releases of 2011 were the soundtrack albums to the action-masala films Rajapattai and Vettai, both of which received mixed response and failed to reach success. Yuvan Shankar Raja is currently working on nearly ten projects simultaneously, including Billa II, starring Ajith Kumar and Ameer's long-delayed Aadhi Bhagavan, aside from a couple of small films.
Besides Tamil films, he has also scored music for films in other South Indian languages. Around 35 of the Tamil films, for which he had composed music, were afterwards dubbed into Telugu, Kannada or Malayalam languages as were the respective soundtracks. Apart from these ones, he also worked "straightly" on Telugu projects such as Seshu, Malli Malli Chudali, Happy, Raam, Raju Bhai and Aadavari Matalaku Ardhalu Verule, making him a well-known popular composer in Andhra Pradesh, too.[tpl]cite news|title=South film industry gets bigger|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-31/news-interviews/29603728_1_tamil-nadu-film-industry-tamil-superstar/2|work=The Times of India|accessdate=23 June 2011[/tpl] His latest Telugu album Oy! has become a grand success as it topped the charts for several weeks.

====Non-cinematic output====

Aside from scoring film music and soundtracks, he also produces personal music albums from time to time.

==Music style and impact==

Yuvan Shankar Raja's music predominantly displays the use of Western musical elements. He is creditted with having introduced Hip-hop in the Tamil film music industry and having successfully integrated the genre into the Tamil musical mainstream. He has explored various genres, and experimented with new sounds. Yuvan Shankar Raja has not learnt Indian classical music,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/tamil/profile.php?id=111214778&cid=2409 |title=Welcome To |publisher=Sify |date=31 August 1979 |accessdate=13 July 2012[/tpl] although he has used complex swara patterns and carnatic rāgas in several films, including Nandha and Thulluvadho Ilamai. Critics have noted that Yuvan Shankar Raja's music has a "youthful character to it", with his compositions in particular appealing to the younger generation.
Yuvan Shankar Raja started the "era of remixes"; "Aasai Nooru Vagai" from Kurumbu (2004) is considered as the first remix in a Tamil film, following which several composers began remixing Tamil film songs from the 1970s and 80s. He has experimented with the fusion of old songs with his own original compositions, mixing and incorporating parts of them into his songs.e.g., "Theepidikka" from Arinthum Ariyamalum (2005); "Enga Area" from Pudhupettai (2005) In 2010, he and his friend and fellow actor Silambarasan released the song "Evan Di Unna Pethan" from the film Vaanam (2011) as a single, which generated the trend of releasing single tracks from film soundtracks in Tamil cinema several months prior to the actual release,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/article2701259.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Showbitz – Moving to direction | date=9 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/74555.html |title=Hit mantra of soup boys |publisher=IndiaGlitz |date=25 November 2011 |accessdate=13 July 2012[/tpl] although the first single in Tamil cinema had been released in 2001 already.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2002/10/25/stories/2002102501150300.htm |title=The Hindu : Fame on a platter |publisher=The Hindu |date=25 October 2002 |accessdate=13 July 2012[/tpl]
