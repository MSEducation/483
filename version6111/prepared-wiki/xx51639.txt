CATEGORIES: Mesopotamian mythology, Dragons, Sumerian words and phrases

In Sumerian mythology, Kur  is considered the first ever dragon, and usually referred to the Zagros mountains to the east of Sumer.  The cuneiform for "kur" was written ideographically with the cuneiform sign íÜ≥, a pictograph of a mountain."Sumerian Mythology" by Samuel Noah Kramer, p.110 It can also mean "foreign land".  Although the word for earth was Ki, Kur came to also mean land, and Sumer itself, was called "Kur-gal" or "Great Land".  "Kur-gal" also means "Great Mountain" and is a metonym for both Nippur and Enlil who rules from that city."Scenes from the Shadow Side", Frans Wiggermann, Mesopotamian Poetic Language, Brill, 1996, pp. 208-209  Ekur, "mountain house" was the temple of Enlil at Nippur. A second, popular meaning of Kur was "underworld", or the world under the earth.[ref]Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary:Jeremy A.

Kur was sometimes the home of the dead,http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/sum08.htm "Sumerian Mythology"] by Samuel Noah Kramer p.110 passim it is possible that the flames on escaping gas plumes in parts of the Zagros mountains would have given those mountains a meaning not entirely consistent with the primary meaning of mountains and an abode of a god.  The eastern mountains as an abode of the god is popular in Ancient Near Eastern mythology.
It is likely that this name coincides with the  modern day Kurds who are the predominant ethnicity inhabiting much of the Zagros mountain range.Hennerbichler believes the term Kurd and similar ethnic labels to have been derived from the Sumerian word stem ‚Äúkur‚Äù, meaning mountain. Hennenrbichler. (2012). The Origin of Kurds. Advances in Anthropology, 2.2: pp. 64-79. In modern Kurdish language, kur is the word for boy.
The underworld Kur is the void space between the primeval sea (Abzu) and the earth (Ma).
Kur is almost identical with "Ki-gal", "Great Land" which is the Underworld (thus the ruler of the Underworld is Ereshkigal "Goddess of The Great Land".  In later Babylonian myth Kur is possibly an Anunnaki, brother of Ereshkigal, Inanna, Enki, and Enlil.  In the Enuma Elish in Akkadian tablets from the first millennium BC, Kur is part of the retinue of Tiamat, and seems to be a snakelike dragon.  In one story the slaying of the great serpent Kur results in the flooding of the earth.http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/sum08.htm "Sumerian Mythology"] by Samuel Noah Kramer, p. 112  A first millennium BC cylinder seal shows a fire-spitting winged dragon‚Äîa nude woman between its wings‚Äîpulling the chariot of the god who subdued it, another depicts a god riding a dragon, a third a goddess.http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/sum08.htm "Sumerian Mythology"] by Samuel Noah Kramer, p. 114
