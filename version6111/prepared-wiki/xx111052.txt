Chris Whitaker (born 19 October 1974) is a retired Australian rugby union footballer. A much acclaimed scrum-half for Leinster in Ireland, he previously played for the New South Wales Waratahs, a state team representing New South Wales in Super Rugby.
He was constrained for many years, by the Wallabies captain, George Gregan. As such, he got minimal international game time, yet was in the squad for many a year. He first started playing rugby at Sydney Boys High School, graduating in 1992,http://www.shsobu.org.au/wp-content/uploads/sport.pdf which he attended in Sydney, and moved up through the ranks from there.
