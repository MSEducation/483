[[Mixed breed]]

CATEGORIES: Domesticated animals

A mixed breed is a domesticated animal descended from multiple breeds of the same species, often breeding without any human intervention, recordkeeping, or selective breeding. In contrast, crossbreed is where the animal's parentage is deliberately selected by humans, and hybrid is a mix between species.
