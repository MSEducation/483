St. John's Church in Savannah is a parish of the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia.
The church was formed in 1841 from the growing Christ Church, Savannah, as part of a plan to increase Episcopal presence in Georgia and to provide for a first bishop of the diocese. In addition to his Episcopal duties, the bishop would be rector of both St. John's and Christ Church. Stephen Elliott, Jr. was consecrated as Bishop of Georgia in February 1841.
St. John's first building was consecrated in 1853. When the congregation outgrew this building, the construction was undertaken of the current building (which is situated across from the historic Green-Meldrim House - now the church's parish house). The building was designed by Calvin N. Otis of Buffalo, NY,http://books.google.com/books?id=eDOHI4b408oC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=%22calvin+n.+otis%22+architect+savannah&source=bl&ots=BiJPHiocBy&sig=dEiHv9tpm7tjnDbq1TU1mpIycfI&hl=en&ei=SOroTKadDsalnweUv-HwDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false and was consecrated in May 1853.
The Parish continues to use the 1928 Book of Common Prayer, but nevertheless maintains, despite the generally conservative character of its congregation, cordial relations with the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia.
