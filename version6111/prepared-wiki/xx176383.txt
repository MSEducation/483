[[1974 college football season]]

CATEGORIES: 1974 NCAA Division I football season

The 1974 NCAA Division I football season finished with two national champions.  The Associated Press (AP) writers' poll ranked the University of Oklahoma, which was on probation and barred by the NCAA from postseason play, #1 at season's end.  The United Press International (UPI) coaches' poll, on the other hand, did not rank Oklahoma at all, by unanimous agreement of the 25 member coaches' board."UPI Coaches Omitting Oklahoma," Mansfield (O.) News Journal, Sep. 24, 1974, p19  The UPI trophy went to the University of Southern California (USC).  During the 20th Century, the NCAA had no playoff for the college football teams that would later be described as "Division I-A". The NCAA Football Guide, however, did note an "unofficial national champion" based on the top ranked teams in the "wire service" (AP and UPI) polls.  The "writers' poll" by Associated Press (AP) was the most popular, followed by the "coaches' poll" by United Press International) (UPI).  Starting in 1974, the UPI joined AP in issuing its final poll after the bowl games were completed.  Both polls operated under a point system of 20 points for first place, 19 for second, etc., whereby the overall ranking was determined.  The AP poll consisted of the votes of 60 writers, though not all voted in each poll, and the UPI poll was taken of a 25 member board.

November 30th 1974 - USC 55, Notre Dame 24 “The Comeback”  In one of the most notable comebacks in college football history, the 1974 Trojans erased a 24-point deficit to beat defending national champion Notre Dame, 55-24, in the Coliseum.12 Many football historians cite this game as one of USC's 10 greatest games.17 The Irish jumped out to a 24-0 lead, but with 10 seconds remaining before halftime, Anthony Davis scored on a 7-yard pass from Pat Haden.12 At the start of second half, Davis took the opening kickoff of and raced 102 yards for a score, opening the floodgates as USC rallied for 35 points in the third quarter.12 Davis scored 2 more touchdowns that quarter, and Haden threw two TD passes to J. K. McKay, the head coach's son.12 In the fourth quarter, Haden connected with Shelton Diggs for a touchdown and Charles Phillips returned an interception 58 yards for a touchdown.12 Adding to the shock of the comeback was the fact that USC scored 55 points in under 17 minutes.12 Anthony Davis scored 11 TD's in his 3 games against Notre Dame. After the game, the Rev. Theodore Martin Hesburgh, the then-president of Notre Dame, said to Trojan coach John McKay, "That wasn't very nice." McKay, an Irish Catholic known for his quick wit, replied, "That's what you get for hiring a Presbyterian! (referring to Parseghian's faith)"12 A few weeks later, Ara Parseghian announced his resignation, and the Irish gave him a fitting farewell present with an emotional 13-11 win over Alabama and Bear Bryant in the Orange Bowl.13
Oklahoma and Alabama, both 11-0-0, were the only undefeated and untied teams at season's end.  AP ranked Oklahoma first, and UPI ranked Alabama #1.

==Conference standings==

The following is an incomplete list of conference standings:

==Bowl games==

Nebraska defeated Florida in the Sugar Bowl played on New Year's Eve. On New Years Day, Penn State defeated the surprise SWC champion Baylor in the Cotton Bowl. Then things got really interesting. 3rd ranked Ohio State (led by Woody Hayes) and #4 USC (coached by John McKay) played in the Rose Bowl before a crowd of 106,721 in Pasadena.  Ohio State led 7-3 after three quarters, and 17-10 in the closing minutes.  With 2:03 left, Pat Haden fired a 38-yard pass to John McKay, Jr. (son of USC's coach) to make the score 17-16.  Coach McKay then passed up a chance for a tie over the favored Buckeyes, and ordered the Trojans to go for two.  Shelton Diggs dove and caught Haden's low pass in the end zone to give USC an 18-17 lead. Ohio State could only get close enough for a desperation 62-yard field goal attempt that fell about 8 yards short as time expired."The Great Gamble Pays Off In Trojan Win," Star-News (Pasadena), January 2, 1975, p B-1 
Alabama, coached by Bear Bryant was ranked #1 in the UPI poll, and #2 (behind on-probation Oklahoma) in the AP, as it went to the Orange Bowl, where it faced 9th ranked Notre Dame, playing its final game under Ara Parseghian.  The Irish went out to a 13-0 lead early in the game, but Bama battled back with a field goal, a touchdown and a two point run to close the score to 13-11 with three minutes left.  After ruling out an onside kick attempt, the Tide force a Notre Dame punt and got the ball back with 1:37 left. Quarterback Richard Todd attempted to drive the team to field goal range, but he threw his 3rd interception of the game, and Notre Dame ran out the clock to preserve the upset win.  
In the final UPI poll, USC was ranked first, with Alabama 2nd, Ohio State 3rd, Michigan 4th and Notre Dame 5th.  The Trojans were #2 in the AP poll, where the Oklahoma Sooners were the first place choice for 51 of the 60 writers.
