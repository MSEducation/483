Braddell-Westlake Secondary School was a government secondary school in Singapore.

==History==

Braddell-Westlake Secondary School was the result of a merger between Braddell Secondary School and Westlake Secondary School in 2000 in order to boost falling enrolment. Located along Braddell Road, it occupied the former premises of its component schools, and had the distinction of being one of the few secondary schools in Singapore to occupy two separate campuses. This was of an obvious benefit to the students, who had the facilities of two schools at their disposal, such as two canteens and a large combined school field. Ms Monica Quek was the principal from 2000-2003 before retiring, after which Mrs Catherine Seah replaced her and served as principal until the school's closure in 2005.
Initially, the lower secondary section was located in Campus 1 (formerly Braddell Secondary School) and the upper secondary section was located at Campus 2 (formerly Westlake Secondary School) although nearer towards the eventual merger, Campus 1 was closed and the remaining classes shifted to Campus 2. Although the yearly enrolment typically fell short of 1000 students, this caused a close-knit community of students to be formed in a cosy atmosphere.

==Closure==

The last graduating batch was in 2005, after which the school buildings were formally closed. The remaining staff and students were transferred to Guangyang Secondary School. Due to the relatively short time that the remaining students would be spending in the new school, they were given the option of retaining their former school uniform instead of purchasing the new uniform.
