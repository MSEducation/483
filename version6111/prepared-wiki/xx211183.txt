Among their best-known publications are the books Days of War, Nights of Love, Evasion, Recipes for Disaster: An Anarchist Cookbook and the pamphlet Fighting For Our Lives (of which, to date, they claim to have printed 600,000 copies), Inside Front and a decade of album releases by North American anarcho-punk artists. Several websites are maintained by individual cells of the collective, including Crimethinc.com, a clearing house for CrimethInc. activities operated by the Far East Cell which hosts excerpts from previously published works as well as a blog.
CrimethInc. is connected to publishing collectives/organizations with similar ideas, notably the Curious George Brigade which has produced a number of works, including Anarchy in the Age of Dinosaurs. In 2005, they began publishing a half-gloss journal, Rolling Thunder, with the byline "An Anarchist Journal of Dangerous Living", which released its fifth issue in 2008. CrimethInc. texts have received wide coverage in the anarchist media and in academic publications,[ref]References to CrimethInc. texts include:
