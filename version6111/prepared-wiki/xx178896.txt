Farthing Downs and Happy Valley ([tpl]gbmappingsmall|TQ303572[/tpl]) is a 120.5 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Coulsdon in the London Borough of Croydon. It was notified in 1987 for its biological and geological interest. Ideally situated very near the centre of Coulsdon, 'The Downs' are part of the Metropolitan Green Belt and a favourite haunt of dog walkers and joggers alike. There is evidence of a prehistoric enclosure system and Anglo-Saxon barrow cemetery on the site, which have been excavated by archaeologists. Brian Hope-Taylor surveyed three barrows in 1948/9 finding a number of skeletons. A later survey was performed by Barry Taylor in 2005.
