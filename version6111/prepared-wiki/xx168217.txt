</ref> About 65 percent of the poonga is covered by water and artefacts and signages.<ref name="OpenOnlyForSchoolchildren"/> In the first 2 months of its inauguration, nearly 4,000 children from several schools in the city and the nearby [[Kancheepuram District|Kancheepuram]] and [[Tiruvallur district|Tiruvallur]] districts have visited the park to learn about [[wetland]] conservation, [[Ecosystem management|eco-restoration]] and water management.<ref>

==Geography==

The Adyar river originates from Malaipattu tank near Manimangalam village in Sriperumbudur Taluk at about 15 km west of Tambaram and gains momentum as a stream from Chembarambakkam lake. It runs through Chennai for 42 km before draining into the Bay of Bengal, forming an estuary, which extends from the Adyar Bridge to the sandbar at the edge of the sea, with some small islets in-between. Just before joining the sea at a sand bar on the shore, one part of the river takes off northward beyond the Chettinad Palace as a small inlet of water forming a tidal creek. The creek takes a U-turn near Foreshore Estate. It surrounds what was formerly called Quibble Island, stopping short of completely encircling it. The estuary covers an area of about 300 acres. The low salinity, good shelters, calm conditions and high plankton availability in the creek serves as a good nursery for fish. The flow of tidal water in and out of the creek allowed for easy travel of boats. It therefore encouraged fishing and there was a thriving economy of fish trade here. However, with the city's sewage and effluence from its various industries, for some time, emptying into the river, the biological activities in the region was affected.
The Adyar wetland reserve is a significant link for birds on their great annual migrations, particularly the wading birds which feed on the coastal mudflats. Historically, approximately 200 species of migratory birds visited the Adyar Creek region but many are now on the endangered IUCN Red List. The restoration of this coastal wetland ecosystem will encourage many of these species to return.[ref]

==Early phase==

An estimated not more than 500 acres of undisturbed tropical dry evergreen forest remains in Tamil Nadu and the eco-park, aiming at the restoration of more than 350 acres, serves as a significant conservation effort to bring this vegetation back to the Coromandel coast. Owing to uncontrolled exploitation of the wetland due to urbanisation, the region became a degraded area by the end of the 20th century. When the Ambedkar Memorial was constructed, the damage to the ecosystem was challenged by the Citizen, consumer and civil Action Group (CAG) in the court. In 2000, the High Court directed the state government to preserve the wetlands. On 22 December 2003, the State Government handed over 58 acres of the area to the Corporation of Chennai to develop it into an eco park modelled on Tezozomac of Mexico.[ref]
