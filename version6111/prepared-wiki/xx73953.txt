==History==

===Creation===

In 1967, founding the Canadian Film Development Corporation (CFDC), the Canadian government allocates $10 million in support of the feature film industry. Michael Spencer is named the first executive director of the CFDC, which by then includes offices in Montreal and Toronto.

===1970s===

By 1976, the Canadian government has increased the CFDC’s budget to $25 million annually, at which point the decision is made to finance the corporation with an annual parliamentary appropriation.

===1980s===

The early 1980s sees the CFDC’s budget increased yet again and the creation of the Canadian Broadcast Program Development Fund to revitalize Canadian television programming. At the time, approximately 85% of all prime time programming on Canadian television is imported from other countries—namely the US.
Under the direction of André Lamy, in 1984 the CFDC is renamed “Telefilm Canada” to better reflect the organization’s full range of activities in both the film and television industries. With the creation of the Feature Film Fund aimed at supporting feature films by Canadian filmmakers and the Feature Film Distribution Fund that makes credit lines available to Canadian distributors, Telefilm Canada takes a central role in the development and growth of Canadian cinema around the world.

===1990s===

Now under the executive direction of François Macerola, the Canada Television and Cable Production Fund is created. The Fund is a private-public partnership between the federal government of Canada and the cable and satellite television industry, with Telefilm administering the Equity Investment component of the Fund.
By the end of the 1990s, in 1998, Telefilm Canada creates a five-year, $30-million multimedia fund, aptly-named The Multimedia Fund, with which to support Canadian work in the digital age. The Fund helps Canadians in multimedia to compete effectively in the new technologies arena.

===2000s===

With the new millennium, the Canadian government implements a new Canadian Feature Film Policy, From Script to Screen, that effectively creates the Canada Feature Film Fund (CFFF) to be managed by Telefilm Canada. Beginning April 1, 2001, with an annual budget of $100-million, the CFF’s primary objective is to build larger audiences in Canada and abroad for Canadian feature films with improved distribution and marketing.
Also that year, Telefilm Canada announces guidelines for the Canada New Media Fund, replacing the Multimedia Fund. Budgets grow from $6 million, to $9 million, and now sit at $14 million annually. 
The latter half of the decade brings about other changes for Telefilm. In 2005, the Minister of Canadian Heritage announces a new collaboration between the organization and the Canadian Television Fund and, with it, renewed funding of $100 million for Canadian television programming. While the Board of the Canadian Television is responsible for the governance of all programs, Telefilm heads up the administration and delivery of the CTF programs.[tpl]cite web|title=History|url=http://www.telefilm.ca/en/telefilm/telefilm/history|publisher=Telefilm Canada[/tpl]

===Present===

The 2012 Canadian federal budget cut funding for the National Film Board of Canada and Telefilm Canada by  10%.
Today, following a new four-year plan, Telefilm has made stimulating demand for Canadian screen-based content one of its top priorities.[tpl]cite web|title=Corporate Plan|url=http://www.telefilm.ca/en/telefilm/corporate-publications/corporate-plan|publisher=Telefilm Canada[/tpl]
