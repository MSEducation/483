</ref> Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely, and thereby reduce genetic variability. In contrast to [[natural selection]], which makes gene variants more common or less common depending on their reproductive success,<ref name = avers>[tpl]Cite journal | last = Avers | first = Charlotte | year = 1989 | title = Process and Pattern in Evolution | publisher = Oxford University Press | ref = harv | postscript = [/tpl]</ref> the changes due to genetic drift are not driven by environmental or adaptive pressures, and may be beneficial, neutral, or detrimental to reproductive success.
The effect of genetic drift is larger for alleles present in few copies than when an allele is present in many copies. Scientists wage vigorous debates over the relative importance of genetic drift compared with natural selection. Ronald Fisher held the view that genetic drift plays at the most a minor role in evolution, and this remained the dominant view for several decades. In 1968 Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution which claims that most of the changes in the genetic material are caused by neutral mutations and genetic drift.[ref]
