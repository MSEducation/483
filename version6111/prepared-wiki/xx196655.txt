===Blapps Posse===

The Blapps! Records (UK) label run by Jason Carter, released several records from 1989â€“1992 that are considered classics in the Baltimore area, as well as in the British rave scene. "Don't Hold Back", "Too Much Energy" and "Let the Freak" were sampled and played heavily by DJs and producers that would define the Baltimore club sound. Blapps! Records has 2 sublabels: Pure Bhoomie, Ruff Lick Records.
Blapps Posse (Aston Harvey of Freestylers & Jason Carter) were a London based production crew that created some very original sounds in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Their music combined house and hip hop influences - strong bass lines and house breaks, fused with the edge of rap vocals and beats.

===DJ Toolz===

Jason's relationship with Ninja Tune started after he met Coldcut with the DJ Toolz project and blossomed with the release of four breakbeat albums under the same name on sub-label Ninja Toolz.
