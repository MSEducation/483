Gary B.B. Coleman (January 1, 1947[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]February 14, 1994) was an American soul blues guitarist, singer, songwriter and record producer.
Originally a local-musician turned-blues promoter and session musician, Coleman recorded his debut album in 1986, which was re-released on Ichiban Records. Coleman issued several other albums, and produced most of Ichiban's blues catalog up to his death in 1994. On many occasions, Coleman undertook multi-instrumentalist duties in the recording studio. Coleman acknowledged both B.B. King in his "B.B." moniker; and his fellow-Texan, Freddie King.

==Biography==

Born in Paris, Texas, Coleman was working alongside Freddie King by the age of 15. Coleman later supported Lightnin' Hopkins in concert, and went on to form his own group. At this time he started simultaneously booking acts into nightclubs across three states; Texas, Oklahoma, and Colorado. This dual lifestyle in the Southwest continued for nearly twenty years.  In 1985, he created his own independent record label, called Mr. B's Records, and issued both a single, "One Eyed Woman", and his debut album, Nothin' But the Blues, the following year. The album proved to be popular. Ichiban Records signed Coleman to a recording contract, and duly re-released Nothin' But the Blues on their label in 1987. 
If You Can Beat Me Rockin' (1988) followed, and in the same year Coleman's duties expanded with Ichiban to include record production for other acts, songwriting, and becoming an A&R scout. He released a further six albums up to 1992, as well as production duties on albums from Blues Boy Willie, Chick Willis, Little Johnny Taylor, and Buster Benton (Money's the Name of the Game, 1989).
He continued to write material for others and sometimes played guitar and keyboards on their records. His own albums featured self-penned material, such as "I Fell in Love on a One Night Stand" and "If You Can Beat Me Rockin' (You Can Have My Chair)".
Coleman successfully continued to combine various roles until his early death in 1994.
