==Plot==

After having left their own world due to a loss of natural resources, the winged humanoid Nohrin settle on Jhamora with the permission of the ground-dwelling Lokni. But some of the Nohrin, led by would-be conqueror Sedessa, believe in the superiority of their own race and try to take land away from the Lokni. The parents of Delgo, a Lokni, are killed in the resulting conflict. Nohrin King Zahn is horrified by the war and admonishes Sedessa, who then poisons the Queen and almost kills Zahn as well. She is subsequently banished, and her wings are clipped off.
Delgo, meanwhile, is raised by Elder Marley, who tries to teach him how to use the power of magical stones. Once Delgo grows up, however, he gives in to his desire for revenge against the Nohrin as a whole. But then he meets Princess Kyla of the Nohrin and develops a tentative friendship with her. When she is kidnapped by Nohrin General Raius, who is actually working for Sedessa, Delgo and his friend Filo are blamed and arrested.
In the Nohrin prison, Delgo meets Nohrin General Bogardus, who was forced to illegally gamble with his weapons by Raius, because Bogardus opposed an all out war with the Lokni. Delgo, Filo, and Bogardus escape into some underground caverns and eventually reach Sedessa's stronghold and rescue Kyla. Together they hurry back to try to stop the war from taking place. They are too late, for the war has already begun. Bogardus meanwhile fights and defeats Raius, but is soon after mortally injured. Just as Bogardus dies, Delgo realizes that he was the Nohrin soldier who spared his life many years ago during the first war between the Nohrin and the Lokni.
Meanwhile, Sedessa's army of monsters join in the battle. Kyla convinces the Nohrin generals to direct their troops to stop fighting the Lokni and instead pick them up and fly them away from the battlefield. Filo then directs an entire stampede of large animals onto the battlefield, sending Sedessa's minions fleeing for their lives. Delgo goes off to face Sedessa and find King Zahn, whom she has taken prisoner. He finally manages to master the stone magic, and defeats Sedessa. He also puts the past behind him by saving her rather than letting her fall to her death.
However, Sedessa then attacks Kyla, who has come to Delgo's aid. The two struggle and Sedessa finally falls, her artificial wings being of no use. Later, during the celebrations, it turns out Raius wasn't dead, and he makes one last attempt to kill Delgo. He is subdued by a Nohrin, but not before he throws his spear at Delgo. Then, out of nowhere, the spear breaks in mid-air. Everyone turns to look at Filo, who has finally mastered his slingshot. Later, Delgo and Kyla's friendship blossoms into romance when they finally kiss.

==Production==

Fathom Studios began development on Delgo in 1999; animation work began in 2001. The movie was produced by Fathom in conjunction with Electric Eye Entertainment Corporation.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117939196.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 |title=Delgo |accessdate=2008-12-11 |last=Koehler |first=Robert |coauthors= |date=2007-02-05 |work= |publisher=Variety [/tpl]
In a 2001 interview, Marc Adler said that the film sets itself apart from other recent computer-animated films because it is not a comedy and also because it is "a very human story told in a non-human world". Maurer said that "the inspiration for the story really came from all of unrest we have in society today, prejudice, discrimination, hate crimes, violence – all of those terrible things. We wanted to tell a story where our heroes overcame these things personally and facilitated change among entire peoples."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.digitalmediafx.com/Interviews/jason-maurer.html |title=dFX Interview: Jason F. Maurer |accessdate=2008-12-22 |last=Tracy |first=Joe |coauthors= |year=2001 |work= |publisher=Digital Media FX [/tpl]
Fathom launched a "Digital Dailies" feature on the movie's official website,[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.delgo.com/dd/ |title = Digital Dailies |accessdate = 2012-09-03 |date =  |work = Delgo.com |publisher = Fathom Studios[/tpl] allowing fans to follow the production as it happened. Animators would post their work daily on the message board system and fans could see the directors' and producers' input as well as subsequent changes to the scenes. Chief Animator and Artistic Director Derek Winslow went on record in the January 2001 issue of US weekly, stating that "Delgo would be his finest creation" and "would outperform Shrek at the box office".

"By granting public access to our film as a work-in-process we are helping to educate students, burgeoning animators, and film enthusiasts about the procedures involved in the making of a computer animated movie."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.digitalmediafx.com/Interviews/marc-adler.html |title=dFX Interview: Marc Adler (About Delgo) |accessdate=2008-12-22 |last=Tracy |first=Joe |coauthors= |year=2001 |work= |publisher=Digital Media FX [/tpl] Adler said that they were "contacted by professors from the many universities who use the Digital Dailies in their classrooms".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.3dyanimacion.com/entrevistas/entrevistas.cfm?link=delgoen |title=fathom studios delgo |accessdate=2008-12-22 |last= |first= |coauthors= |year=2002 |work= |publisher=El Portal del 3D y la Animación [/tpl] The dailies "were receiving a half-million hits a month", and some of the crew members started to get offers from Hollywood studios (at one point Adler started hiding the identities of the crew with fancy aliases). Adler recruited main crew members locally from "Savannah College of Art and Design, Georgia Tech and smaller digital outfits". Students from the drama department of North Atlanta High School acted out some of the scenes to create reference material for the animators.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.accessatlanta.com/movies/content/movies/stories//2008/12/11/atlanta_animated_delgo.html |title=Atlanta talent creates animated epic ‘Delgo’ |accessdate=2008-12-22 |last=Ruhe |first=Pierre |coauthors= |date=2008-12-11 |work= |publisher=Atlanta Journal-Constitution [/tpl]
Adler said that their team created eight main characters, at least twenty "secondary characters", "twenty-two creatures, thirty plants, and fifty-six sets", as well as numerous background characters.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cgchannel.com/news/showfeature.jsp?newsid=1386&pid=3 |title= DELGO: Proof digital dreams can become reality |accessdate=2008-12-22 |last=Hénault |first= Jean-Eric |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher= CG Channel[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] According to Warren Grubb, Fathom's head animation director, one of the challenges with modeling the background elements was that "We couldn't even use most of the off-the-shelf systems at the time in creating the background assets because they were based on Earthly vegetation."[tpl]cite web |url= http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&category2=&article_no=3846&page=2 |title= Delgo and the Independent Spirit (Page 2) |accessdate=2008-12-22 |last=Godman |first=Martin |coauthors= |date=2008-12-04 |work= Animation World Magazine |publisher=AWN [/tpl]
The filmmakers put together kits with artwork and actual replicas of the stones used in the film to send to the actors, rather than just an offer letter. Once the cast had signed on, the filmmakers had to travel to where the actors were with all their equipment rather than have the actors come to them to record their voices.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/film/120811-AniShorts-Delgo.html |title=Animated Shorts: The Story of Delgo |accessdate=2008-12-22 |last=Fritz |first=Steve |coauthors= |date=2008-12-11 |work= |publisher= [/tpl] Anne Bancroft, the voice of villainess Sedessa, died in 2005, before production finished. On the film's end credits, the film is dedicated to her. Additionally, John Vernon, the voice of Judge Nohrin, died in 2005, making this his final film.
The directors acknowledge the influence of artist Roger Dean, specifically his album covers for Yes and Asia, on their backgrounds.DVD commentary track.

==Impact==

According to the Wall Street Journal, "the failure of Delgo to attract audiences reflects a glut of films in the crowded holiday corridor and highlights the challenges facing films made and marketed outside the Hollywood system."[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122956947512017319.html | title=Kids' Animated Film 'Delgo' Opens Poorly | publisher=The Wall Street Journal | date=2008-12-19 | accessdate=2009-01-24 | first=Lauren A.
