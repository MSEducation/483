[[Fender Bullet Bass]]

CATEGORIES: Fender electric bass guitars

The Fender Bullet Bass is an electric bass guitar model produced by Fender.  It was introduced in 1982 as a part of a new line of guitars meant to replace the outgoing Mustang and Musicmaster - Fender's so called "student" guitars.  The Bullet Bass had Mustang style pickups, but was available with a standard 34" neck in addition to the short scale 30" neck that the Mustang had.  These instruments were only produced in the USA for a couple years until Fender decided to transfer Bullet production to Japan in 1984/85.  They then fell under Fender's newly active Squier branding.
Unlike the Mustang, the Fender Bullet line has not been reissued by Fender - lending these rare instruments an air of mystery.
