[[Flag of Norfolk Island]]

CATEGORIES: Flags of Australia, Norfolk Island culture, Canadian pale

The flag of Norfolk Island was adopted on 17 January 1980. It depicts the Norfolk Island Pine (Araucaria heterophylla) in a central white stripe between two green stripes.
The flag's geometry is a triband. It is similar to the flag of Canada (upon which it was based)[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl], with its use of only two colours, and incorporating a prominent local floral symbol in the middle. As with the Canadian flag it has a 1:2 ratio. The central stripe is wider than the two outer stripes, the ratio being 7:9:7. The flag bears a striking resemblance to the flag of Lebanon (which also features a green tree), the flag of Nigeria (a plain vertical green and white triband), and the 1968â€“1979 flag of Rhodesia (a green and white triband with the state's coat of arms on the white band).
