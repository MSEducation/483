[[Radical initiator]]

CATEGORIES: Radical initiators

In chemistry, radical initiators are substances that can produce radical species under mild conditions and promote radical reactions.[tpl]JerryMarch[/tpl] These substances generally possess weak bondsâ€”bonds that have small bond dissociation energies. Radical initiators are utilized in industrial processes such as polymer synthesis. Typical examples are halogen molecules, azo compounds, and organic and inorganic peroxides.[tpl]March6th[/tpl]

==Major types of initiation reaction==

The sulfate radical adds to an alkene forming radical sulfate esters, e.g. .CHPhCH2OSO3-, that add further alkenes via formation of C-C bonds.  Many styrene and fluoroalkene polymers are produced in this way.

==Safety==

Some radical initiators such as azo compounds and peroxides are often unstable. They are often stored cold.
