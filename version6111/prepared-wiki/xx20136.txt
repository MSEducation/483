[[Codomain]]

CATEGORIES: Functions and mappings, Basic concepts in set theory

In mathematics, the codomain or target set of a function is the set [tpl]mvar|Y[/tpl] into which all of the output of the function is constrained to fall. It is the set [tpl]mvar|Y[/tpl] in the notation [tpl]math|f: X → Y[/tpl]. The codomain is also sometimes referred to as the range but that term is ambiguous as it may also refer to the image.
The codomain is part of a function [tpl]mvar|f[/tpl] if it is defined as described in 1954 by Nicolas Bourbaki,[tpl]cite book |title=Elements de Mathematique,Theorie des Ensembles |author=N.Bourbaki |authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki |publisher=Hermann & cie |page=76 |year=1954[/tpl] namely a triple [tpl]math|(X, Y, F)[/tpl], with [tpl]mvar|F[/tpl] a functional subsetA set of pairs is functional iff no two pairs have the same first component op. cit., p. 76 of the Cartesian product [tpl]math|X × Y[/tpl] and [tpl]math|X[/tpl] is the set of first components of the pairs in [tpl]mvar|F[/tpl] (the domain). The set [tpl]mvar|F[/tpl] is called the graph of the function. The set of all elements of the form [tpl]math|f(x)[/tpl], where [tpl]mvar|x[/tpl] ranges over the elements of the domain [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl], is called the image of [tpl]mvar|f[/tpl]. In general, the image of a function is a subset of its codomain. Thus, it may not coincide with its codomain. Namely, a function that is not surjective has elements [tpl]mvar|y[/tpl] in its codomain for which the equation [tpl]math|1=f(x) = y[/tpl] does not have a solution.
An alternative definition of function by Bourbaki op. cit., p. 77, namely as just a functional graph, does not include a codomain and is also widely used.[tpl]Harvnb|Forster|2003[/tpl], [tpl]Google books quote|id=mVeTuaRwWssC|pg=PA10|text=Some mathematical cultures make this explicit, saying that a function|pages 10–11[/tpl] For example in set theory it is desirable to permit the domain of a function to be a proper class [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl], in which case there is formally no such thing as a triple [tpl]math|(X, Y, F)[/tpl]. With such a definition functions do not have a codomain, although some authors still use it informally after introducing a function in the form [tpl]math|f: X → Y[/tpl].[tpl]Harvnb|Eccles|1997[/tpl], [tpl]Google books quote|id=ImCSX_gm40oC|pg=PA91|text=The reader may wonder at this variety of ways of thinking about a function|quote 1[/tpl], [tpl]Google books quote|id=ImCSX_gm40oC|pg=PA91|text=When defining a function using a formula it is important to be clear about which sets are the domain and the codomain of the function|quote 2[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Mac Lane|1998[/tpl], [tpl]Google books quote|id=MXboNPdTv7QC|pg=PA8|text=Here "function" means a function with specified domain and specified codomain|page 8[/tpl]Mac Lane, in [tpl]Harvnb|Scott|Jech|1967[/tpl], [tpl]Google books quote|id=5mf4Vckj0gEC|pg=PA232|text=Note explicitly that the notion of function is not that customary in axiomatic set theory|page 232[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Sharma|2004[/tpl], [tpl]Google books quote|id=IGvDpe6hYiQC|pg=PA91|text=Functions as sets of ordered pairs|page 91[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Stewart|Tall|1977[/tpl], [tpl]Google books quote|id=TLelvnIU2sEC|pg=PA89|text=Strictly speaking we cannot talk of 'the' codomain of a function|page 89[/tpl]

==Examples==

For a function
defined by
An alternative function [tpl]mvar|g[/tpl] is defined thus: 
While [tpl]mvar|f[/tpl] and [tpl]mvar|g[/tpl] map a given [tpl]mvar|x[/tpl] to the same number, they are not, in this view, the same function because they have different codomains. A third function [tpl]mvar|h[/tpl] can be defined to demonstrate why:
The compositions are defined
Function composition therefore is a useful notation only when the codomain  of the function on the right side of a composition (not its image, which is a consequence of the function and could be unknown at the level of the composition) is the same as the domain of the function on the left side.
The codomain affects whether a function is a surjection, in that the function is surjective if and only if its codomain equals its image.  In the example, [tpl]mvar|g[/tpl] is a surjection while [tpl]mvar|f[/tpl] is not.  The codomain does not affect whether a function is an injection.
