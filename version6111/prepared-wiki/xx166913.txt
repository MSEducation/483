Koya is a South-Central Dravidian language of the Gondi–Kui group. It is sometimes described as a dialect of Gondi (spoken in Adilabad district in Andhra Pradesh and in Gondwana region of Central India), but it is possibly mutually unintelligible with Gondi dialects.[tpl]cite book | title=The Dravidian languages | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Bhadriraju Krishnamurti | year=2003 | pages=25[/tpl]
