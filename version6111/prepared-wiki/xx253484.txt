Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu (born 5 February 1968, Alanya, Turkey) is a Member of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, where he represents Antalya Province and, since 26 December 2013, Minister of European Union Affairs and Chief Negotiator.

He was the president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe from 2010 to 2012.

==Early life==

Çavuşoğlu graduated from Ankara University in 1988 where he studied international relations. He then received a masters in economics from Long Island University in New York, and doctorates from Bilkent University and the London School of Economics, where he was for a time president of the Turkish Society.

While serving in parliament, he has chaired the Committee on Migration, Refugees and Population. In November 2009 he met the foreign minister of the Russian Federation, Sergei Lavrov, in the context of a report that the Assembly is preparing on the Soviet famine of 1932–1933.

==Council of Europe==

Çavuşoğlu joined the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in 2003 and soon after was named the head of the Turkish delegation and a vice-president of the Assembly. During the January 2010 session of the Assembly he was nominated and elected on 25 January 2010 to replace outgoing President Lluís Maria De Puig of Spain.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=turkish-parliamentarian-elected-president-of-pace-2010-01-25 |title= Turkish parliamentarian elected president of PACE |date= 25 January 2010 |first= Dönduü Sariişik |work= Hürriyet |accessdate= 26 January 2010[/tpl] In the October reshuffle, this was the reason given for why he did not receive extra responsibilities in Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government. His candidacy for this post was supported by all of Turkey's main parties. He became president just months before Turkey took up the chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (November 2010) and at the same time that there was a Turkish president of the Congress of the Council of Europe. In 2012 he was succeeded by France's Jean-Claude Mignon.

==Intervention in the 2014 Turkish Elections==

Çavuşoğlu was criticized because of his intervention in the municipality election in Antalya that took place in March, 30th 2014. When the opposing party candidate Mustafa Akaydin was ahead of the ruling party candidate, he visited the courthouse with his supporters and interrupted the counting process.
After his interruption, counting of votes was stopped. It was claimed that not already counted votes are from suburbs where the opposing party has more supporters, and supporters of Çavuşoğlu and the ruling party were trying to produce fake evidences to change the results.
