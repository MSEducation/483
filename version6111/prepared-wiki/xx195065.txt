==Design Philosophy==

Aronson’s work is characterized by its attention to moral and historical issues of place and culture.  His designs recognize both cultural and environmental relationships at the scale of the region and the site.  Aronson incorporates a modern aesthetic into an ancient landscape.  Lawrence Halprin, Aronson’s former employer and mentor, remarks that “In many ways Aronson’s attitudes and his process have transcended questions of detailed design.  I believe his work must be judged on a far larger basis-that of concept, basic philosophy, and the significant role that landscape architecture can play in determining the character and quality, not only of Israel, but also of our world and of the future.”
Another characteristic of Aronson’s work is selection of plants that hark back to agricultural and religious traditions.Loon, 2007, p28, 30-32Bennett, 2000, p60-67  According to Peter Jacobs, “the form and materials of Aronson’s projects are derived from a careful reading of the natural and cultural history of the landscape, an understanding of the urban place as much as the rural countryside.”Aronson, 1998, p11
In 2012, Aronson planned four "healing gardens" that adjoin the new entrance pavilion of Hadassah Medical Center in Ein Karem. The gardens employ the principles of biophilic design, which posits that nature and vegetation impact positively on human health.[tpl]cite web|last=Dvir |first=Noam |url=http://www.haaretz.com/misc/iphone-article/hadassah-hospital-is-taking-health-care-to-new-heights-1.412948 |title=Hadassah hospital is taking health care to new heights, Haaretz |publisher=Haaretz.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25[/tpl]
