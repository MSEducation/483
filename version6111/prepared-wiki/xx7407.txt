Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer web browser. Its flagship hardware products are Xbox game console and the Microsoft Surface series of tablets. It is the world's largest software maker measured by revenues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.softwaretop100.org/global-software-top-100-edition-2011 |title=Global Software Top 100 - Edition 2011 |publisher=Softwaretop100.Org|date=23 August 2011[/tpl] It is also one of the world's most valuable companies.[tpl]cite web | url=http://ycharts.com/rankings/market_cap | title=Market Cap Rankings | publisher=Zacks Investment Research | work=Ycharts | date=April 8, 2012 | accessdate=April 9, 2012[/tpl]
Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering, and subsequent rise in its share price, created an estimated three billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions. In May 2011, Microsoft acquired Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in its largest acquisition to date.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.searchofficespace.com/blog/sos-news/microsoft-buys-skype-for-8-5-billion.html |title=Microsoft buys Skype for $8.5 billion |publisher=The Search Office Space Blog |date=May 10, 2011 |accessdate=April 4, 2011[/tpl]
As of 2013, Microsoft is market dominant in both the IBM PC-compatible operating system and office software suite markets (the latter with Microsoft Office). The company also produces a wide range of other software for desktops and servers, and is active in areas including Internet search (with Bing), the video game industry (with the Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles), the digital services market (through MSN), and mobile phones (via the Windows Phone OS). In June 2012, Microsoft entered the personal computer production market for the first time, with the launch of the Microsoft Surface, a line of tablet computers.
With the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division to form Microsoft Mobile Oy, the company will re-enter the smartphone hardware market, after its' previous attempt, Microsoft Kin, which resulted from their acquisition of Danger Inc.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/applications/notify-the-next-of-kin/d/d-id/1090416|title=Notify The Next Of Kin |date=30 June 2010 |work=InformationWeek [/tpl]

==History==

===1972–83: Founding and company beginnings===

Paul Allen and Bill Gates, childhood friends with a passion in computer programming, were seeking to make a successful business utilizing their shared skills. In 1972 they founded their first company named Traf-O-Data, which offered a rudimentary computer that tracked and analyzed automobile traffic data. Allen went on to pursue a degree in computer science at the University of Washington, later dropping out of school to work at Honeywell. Gates began studies at Harvard.[tpl]cite web|title=Microsoft Company HIstory|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/microsoft-corporation-history/[/tpl]  The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems's (MITS) Altair 8800 microcomputer. Allen noticed that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device; after a call from Gates claiming to have a working interpreter, MITS requested a demonstration. Since they didn't actually have one, Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter. Although they developed the interpreter on a simulator and not the actual device, the interpreter worked flawlessly when they demonstrated the interpreter to MITS in Albuquerque, New Mexico in March 1975; MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC.[tpl]rp|108, 112–114|date=November 2012[/tpl] They officially established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as the CEO.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5085630.stm|title=Bill Gates: A Timeline|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=July 15, 2006|accessdate=July 17, 2010[/tpl] Allen came up with the original name of "Micro-Soft," the combination of the words microcomputer and software, as recounted in a 1995 Fortune magazine article. In August 1977 the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office, "ASCII Microsoft".[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n8/192_Kay_Nishi_bridges_the_cul.php|title=Kay Nishi bridges the cultural gap|author=Staples, Betsy|journal=Creative Computing|volume=10|issue=8|page=192|date=August 1984|accessdate=July 15, 2010[/tpl] The company moved to a new home in Bellevue, Washington in January 1979.
Microsoft entered the OS business in 1980 with its own version of Unix, called Xenix.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.computersourcemag.com/articles/viewer.asp?a=695|title=Under The Hood: Part 8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901182630/http://www.computersourcemag.com/articles/viewer.asp?a=695|archivedate=September 11, 2006|work=Computer Source|author=Dyar, Dafydd Neal|date=November 4, 2002|accessdate=July 14, 2010[/tpl] However, it was MS-DOS that solidified the company's dominance. After negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M OS, which was set to be used in the upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC).[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k9xS6t4ibxoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Engines+that+move+markets:+technology+investing+from+railroads+to+the&hl=en&ei=BJThTfsoiK3yA4bgoJQH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=november%201980&f=false |title=Engines that move markets |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 29, 2011[/tpl] For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products, branding it as MS-DOS, which IBM rebranded to PC DOS. Following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981, Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS. Since IBM copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. Due to various factors, such as MS-DOS's available software selection, Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Smart Computing|publisher=Sandhills Publishing Company|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/r0603/09r03/09r03.asp&guid=|title=Microsoft to Microsoft disk operating system (MS-DOS)|date=March 2002|accessdate=August 18, 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JO6kA0hebJIC&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210&dq=%22columbia+data+products%22+clone+bios&q=%22columbia%20data%20products%22%20clone%20bios|title=The Invisible Edge: Taking Your Strategy to the Next Level Using Intellectual Property|last=Blaxill|first=Mark|last2=Eckardt|first2=Ralph|publisher=Portfolio Hardcover|isbn=1-59184-237-9|date=March 5, 2009|accessdate=July 7, 2010[/tpl][tpl]rp|210|date=November 2012[/tpl] The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as a publishing division named Microsoft Press.[tpl]rp|232|date=November 2012[/tpl] Paul Allen resigned from Microsoft in February after developing Hodgkin's disease.[tpl]rp|231|date=November 2012[/tpl]

On July 27, 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division filed a Competitive Impact Statement that said, in part:
"Beginning in 1988, and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti-competitive "per processor" licenses. Under a per processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM's use of a competing PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft's use of per processor licenses has increased."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f0000/0045.htm |title=Competitive Impact Statement : U.S. v.

As the smartphone industry boomed beginning in 2007, Microsoft struggled to keep up with its rivals Apple and Google in providing a modern smartphone operating system. As a result, in 2010, Microsoft revamped their aging flagship mobile operating system, Windows Mobile, replacing it with the new Windows Phone OS; along with a new strategy in the smartphone industry that has Microsoft working more closely with smartphone manufacturers, such as Nokia, and to provide a consistent user experience across all smartphones using Microsoft's Windows Phone OS. It used a new user interface design language, codenamed "Metro", which prominently used simple shapes, typography and iconography, and the concept of minimalism.

Microsoft is an outspoken opponent of the cap on H1B visas, which allow companies in the U.S. to employ certain foreign workers.

==Criticism==

Criticism of Microsoft has followed the company's existence because of various aspects of its products and business practices. Ease of use, stability, and security of the company's software are common targets for critics. More recently, Trojan horses and other exploits have plagued numerous users due to faults in the security of Microsoft Windows and other programs. Microsoft is also accused of locking vendors into their products, and not following and complying with existing standards in its software.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/25/writing_history_with_microsofts_office/|title=Writing history with Microsoft's Office lock-in[/tpl] Total cost of ownership comparisons of Linux as well as OS X to Windows are a continuous point of debate.
The company has been in numerous lawsuits by several governments and other companies for unlawful monopolistic practices. In 2004, the European Union found Microsoft guilty in a highly publicized anti-trust case. Additionally, Microsoft's EULA for some of its programs is often criticized as being too restrictive as well as being against open source software.
Microsoft has been criticized (along with Yahoo, AOL, Google and others) for its involvement in censorship in the People's Republic of China.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/ | title=Corporate Complicity in Chinese Internet Censorship | accessdate=2006-11-23[/tpl] Microsoft has also come under criticism for outsourcing jobs to China and India."Who's buying Microsoft's outsourcing excuses?".

===Marketing===

In 2004, Microsoft commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of Windows Server 2003 to Linux; the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than Linux, thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company (i.e. lower TCO).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/158237_msftresearch27.html|title=Studies on Linux help their patron: Microsoft|author=Bishop, Todd|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|publisher=Hearst Seattle Media, LLC|date=January 27, 2004|accessdate=July 16, 2010[/tpl] This spurred a wave of related studies; a study by the Yankee Group concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the switching costs from Windows Server to Linux, although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and concern about being locked into using Microsoft products.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/operating_systems/yankee_independently_pits_windows_tco_vs_linux_tco.html|title=Yankee Independently Pits Windows TCO vs. Linux TCO |author=Foley, Mary Jo|work=eWeek |date=March 24, 2004 |accessdate=July 14, 2010[/tpl] Another study, released by the Open Source Development Labs, claimed that the Microsoft studies were "simply outdated and one-sided" and their survey concluded that the TCO of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other reasons.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2150210/linux-fans-hit-back-microsoft |title=Linux fans hit back at Microsoft TCO claims|author=Jaques, Robert|work=vnunet.com|date=February 13, 2006 |accessdate=August 18, 2008[/tpl]
