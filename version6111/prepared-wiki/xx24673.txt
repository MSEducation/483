Kennedy, and First Lady of the United States during his presidency from 1961 until his assassination in 1963. Five years later she married Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis; they remained married until his death in 1975. 
For the final two decades of her life, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis had a career as a book editor. She is remembered for her contributions to the arts and preservation of historic architecture, her style, elegance, and grace.Hall, Mimi.

Quote: "The prescience of her words is remarkable given the influence she ultimately had on fashion, interior decoration, and architectural preservation from the early 1960s until her death in 1994. A disappointing visit to the Executive Mansion when she was 11 left a deep impression, one she immediately acted upon when she knew she was to become first lady..." Retrieved February 13, 2011.

==Childhood==

Jacqueline Lee Bouvier was born in Southampton, New York in 1929, to Wall Street stockbroker John Vernou "Black Jack" Bouvier III (1891–1957) and Janet Norton Lee (1907–1989). Jackie's younger sister Caroline Lee Bouvier was born in 1933. The Bouviers divorced in 1940. Janet later married Standard Oil heir Hugh Dudley Auchincloss, Jr. in 1942 and had two more children: Janet Jennings Auchincloss (1945–1985) and James Lee Auchincloss (born 1947).

Michel Bouvier, Jacqueline's patrilineal great-great-grandfather, was born in France and was a contemporary of Joseph Bonaparte and Stephen Girard. He was a Philadelphia-based cabinetmaker, carpenter, merchant, and real estate speculator.Pottker, p. 9. Michel's wife, Louise Vernou, was the daughter of French émigré tobacconist John Vernou and English-born Elizabeth Clifford Lindsay. Michel and Louise's sons included John Vernou Bouvier, Sr. (Jackie's patrilineal great-grandfather) and Michel Charles Bouvier. Jackie's paternal grandfather John Vernou Bouvier Jr. fabricated a more noble ancestry for his family in his vanity family history book, Our Forebears.
