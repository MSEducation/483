By that time Amatieris wasn't an especially strong sports club as most of better Riga footballers were playing with RFK or JKS Riga and Amatieris had only two stars left - Augusts Skiltriters and Pēteris Lauks. Despite his young age Tarulis soon became the leader of the club which finished third in the Riga league in 1926.
