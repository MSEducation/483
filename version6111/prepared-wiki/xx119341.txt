==Football career==

Born in Azpeitia, Basque Country, Labaka reached Real Sociedad's youth system at the age of 17. After playing three years with the reserves he made his professional debuts with Real Unión (Segunda División B) and Ciudad de Murcia (Segunda División), spending one season with each club on loan.
On 24 October 2004 Labaka made his first-team – and La Liga – debut with Real Sociedad, in a 2–1 home win against RCD Mallorca, and finished his first season with 30 games and three goals as the Txuriurdin finished in 14th position; he only appeared in 11 league matches in 2006–07 as the club suffered relegation for the first time in 40 years, but regained first-choice status in the following campaigns.
In August 2011, 31-year-old Labaka was deemed surplus to requirements by new manager Philippe Montanier, and left Real to sign for Rayo Vallecano, freshly promoted to the top level. He retired in June 2013, after two seasons as a backup.
