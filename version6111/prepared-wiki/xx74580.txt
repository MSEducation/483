Parker started his film career in 1989 when he created the film Giant Beavers of Southern Sri Lanka. In 1992 he and Matt Stone made a holiday short titled Jesus vs. Frosty, which was an early forerunner of South Park. His first success came from Cannibal! The Musical. From there he made another short titled Jesus vs. Santa, which led him and college friend Stone to create South Park, which first aired in 1997. He has won five Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on South Park, winning one award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming One Hour or More) and four for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) (of eleven nominations).

==Early life==

Parker was born in Denver, Colorado, the son of Randy (a geologist) and Sharon (an insurance broker). The two share the first names and occupations of South Park characters Randy and Sharon Marsh.[tpl]fact|date=April 2014[/tpl] He has an older sister named Shelly, which is also the name of Stan Marsh's older sister. In the sixth grade, Parker wrote a sketch titled The Dentist and appeared in his school's talent show. He played the dentist and had a friend play the patient. The plot involved what can go wrong at the dentist; due to the amounts of fake blood involved, Parker's parents were called and were upset. "The kindergartners were all crying and freaking out," Parker recalled.[tpl]cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/10/30/8391792/index.htm|title=South Park creators haven't lost their edge|author=Devin Leonard|date=October 27, 2006|publisher=CNN |accessdate=June 17, 2011[/tpl] As a teenager, Parker developed a love for musical theatre, and joined the Evergreen Players, a venerable mountain community theater outside of Denver. At 14, he performed his first role as chorus member in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, Flower Drum Song and went on to also design sets for the community theater's production of Little Shop of Horrors. Parker attended high school at Evergreen High, where he continued his musical endeavors through starring as Danny Zuko in Grease. He also played piano for the chorus and was president of the choir counsel.[tpl]Cite news |last= |first= |title= Frank Rich’s Liner Notes for The Book of Mormon |newspaper=Playbill |date= May 20, 2011 |url=http://www.playbill.com/playblog/2011/05/frank-richs-liner-notes-for-the-book-of-mormon/ |postscript= [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]Cite news |last= Moore|first= John|title=The Book of Mormon: Colorado's kings of pop-culture subversion|newspaper=The Denver Post |date= June 12, 2011 |url=http://www.denverpost.com/commented/ci_18257045?source=commented-entertainment |postscript= [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]

==Career==

===South Park===

In 1992, Parker and Stone created Jesus vs. Frosty.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.spscriptorium.com/Treats/SOC1script.htm |title = The Spirit of Christmas: Jesus vs. Frosty |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = spscriptorium.com [/tpl] It included four boys, two resembling Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski, one called Kenny who looked like Cartman, and a fourth unnamed boy who looked like Kenny. Both Jesus vs. Frosty and Cannibal! The Musical were made while they were students at the University of Colorado film school, studying under both Stan Brakhage and Jerry Aronson. Afterwards, the two friends set off for Hollywood in hopes of making more movies. Brian Graden, then an executive at Fox, put Parker to work making a pilot for a musical children's television series called Time Warped. The pilot, called "Rom and Jul," was a love story about a Homo erectus and an Australopithecus. Fox passed on the series, but Graden paid Parker and Stone $1,200 to make a new version of The Spirit of Christmas he could send out as a video Christmas card.
They came up with two worthwhile ideas; one a sequel to Jesus vs. Frosty, titled Jesus vs. Santa, and one about a character that would later be recurring in South Park, Mr. Hankey.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.spscriptorium.com/SPinfo/SPTimeline1990s.htm |title = The South Park Timeline |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = spscriptorium.com [/tpl] They chose to write about the four boys. The result was The Spirit of Christmas, an animated short film that centered on four crude-acting, blob-shaped third-grade boys forced to intervene in a nasty fistfight between Jesus Christ and Santa Claus. The tape was a smash, passed around and copied endlessly in media circles in Los Angeles and New York City.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986869,00.html#ixzz1PPGAWYQn|title=The Next Generation|author=Ginia Bellafonte|date=August 18, 1997|publisher=Time |accessdate=June 17, 2011[/tpl] The video landed in the hands of Doug Herzog of Comedy Central. "It literally was the funniest thing I'd ever seen," he said in a 2006 interview. "We said, 'Develop a show.' So they went off and developed the show." Stone and Parker produced 13 episodes for season 1. As of 2007, Parker is credited with directing and writing the vast majority of South Park episodes, and voicing most of the regular and guest characters.Weinman, Jaime J. (April 23, 2007).

==Personal life==

In 2006, Parker married Emma Sugiyama. The officiant was 1970s sitcom producer Norman Lear.[tpl]cite news |url = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/10/30/8391792/index.htm |title = How Trey Parker and Matt Stone made South Park a success| date=2006-10-18|publisher =CNNMoney.com | first=Devin | last=Leonard[/tpl]Swanson, Carl (March 6, 2011).

In a September 2006 edition of the ABC News program Nightline, Parker expressed his views on religion, stating that he believes in "a God" and that "there is knowledge that humanity does not yet possess" while cautioning that it would take a long time to explain exactly what he meant by his belief in God. Parker believes all religions are "silly". He states that "All the religions are superfunny to me... The story of Jesus makes no sense to me. God sent his only son. Why could God only have one son and why would he have to die? It's just bad writing, really. And it's really terrible in about the second act." Parker further remarked, "Basically... out of all the ridiculous religion stories which are greatly, wonderfully ridiculous — the silliest one I've ever heard is, 'Yeah... there's this big giant universe and it's expanding, it's all gonna collapse on itself and we're all just here just 'cause... just cause'. That, to me, is the most ridiculous explanation ever."Jake Tapper and Dan Morris (September 22, 2006). "Secrets of South Park". Nightline/ABC News.
