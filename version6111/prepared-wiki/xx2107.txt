A cross section is the effective area that governs the probability of some scattering or absorption event. Together with particle density and path length, it can be used to predict the total scattering probability via the Beer–Lambert law.
In nuclear and particle physics, the concept of a cross section  is used to express the likelihood of interaction between particles.
This basic concept is then extended to the cases where the interaction probability in the targeted area assumes intermediate values - because the target itself is not homogeneous, or because the interaction is mediated by a non-uniform field. A particular case is scattering.

==Scattering==

The scattering cross-section, σscat, is a hypothetical area which describes the likelihood of light (or other radiation) being scattered by a particle.  In general, the scattering cross-section is different from the geometrical cross-section of a particle, and it depends upon the wavelength of light and the permittivity, shape and size of the particle.  The total amount of scattering in a sparse medium is determined by the product of the scattering cross-section and the number of particles present.  In terms of area, the total cross-section (σ) is the sum of the cross-sections due to absorption, scattering and luminescence

==Rate (particle physics)==

In scattering theory, particle physics and nuclear physics, the rate at which a specific subatomic particle reaction occurs is a physical quantity measuring the number of reactions per unit time.

===Partial cross section===

For a particle beam (say of neutrons, pions) incident on a target (liquid hydrogen), for each type of reaction in the scattering process labelled by an index r = 1, 2, 3..., it is calculated from:[tpl]cite book|author=B.R.

where N is the number of target particles, illuminated by the beam containing n particles per unit volume in the beam (number density of particles) traveling with average velocity v in the rest frame of the target, and these two quantities combine into the flux of the beam J = nv. The cross section of the reaction is σr. Since the beam flux has dimensions of length−2·time−1 and σr has dimensions of length2 while N is a dimensionless number, the rate W has the dimensions of reciprocal time - which intuitively represents a frequency of recurring events.
The above formula assumes the following:
These conditions are usually met in experiments, which allows for a very simple calculation of rate.
Sometimes the rate per unit target particle, or rate density, is more useful. For reaction r:[tpl]cite book|title=Radiation detection and measurement|edition=4th|publisher=Wiley|author=G.F.

===Total cross section===

The cross section σr is specifically for one type of reaction, and is called the partial cross section. The total cross section, and corresponding total rate of the reaction, can be found by summing over the cross sections and rates for each reaction:

===Differential cross section===

In terms of the differential cross section dσr(θ, φ) as a function of spherical polar angles θ and φ for reaction r, the differential rate is:
where dΩ = d(cosθ)dφ is the solid angle element in the vicinity of the event with vertex at the point of scattering. Integrating over θ and φ returns the rate for reaction r:
