==Center for American Progress Action Fund==

Formerly known simply as the American Progress Action Fund, the Center for American Progress Action Fund is a "sister advocacy organization" and is organizationally and financially separate from the Center for American Progress, although they share many staff and a physical address. Politico wrote in April 2011 that "The Center for American Progress Action Fund openly runs political advocacy campaigns, and plays a central role in the Democratic Party’s infrastructure, and the new reporting staff down the hall isn’t exactly walled off from that message machine, nor does it necessarily keep its distance from liberal groups organizing advocacy campaigns targeting conservatives.”[tpl]cite web|url= http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=8B8E1D74-C6A7-4CA7-A9C4-60103E217BA7|title= Center for American Progress news team takes aim at GOP|publisher=Politico[/tpl] Whereas the Center for American Progress is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, the fund is a 501(c)(4), allowing it to devote more funds to lobbying."Add to the Collective Genius."

==Criticism==

Some open government groups, such as the Sunlight Foundation and the Campaign Legal Center, criticize the Center's failure to disclose its contributors, particularly since it is so influential in appointments to the Obama administration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1208/16318.html |title=Where's transparency of Podesta group? |author=Ben Smith and Chris Frates |publisher=Politico.com |date= December 9, 2008 |accessdate=2011-07-07[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/opinion/29krugman.html?em|title=March of the Peacocks|last=Krugman|first=Paul|date=January 28, 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 30, 2010[/tpl]
In March 2008, ThinkProgress, a blog outlet of the Center for American Progress, posted that John McCain had plagiarized from a 1996 speech by Rear Admiral Timothy Ziemer.

==Green jobs==

A report from the Center for American Progress concludes that a $100 billion federal investment in clean energy technologies over 2009 and 2010 would yield 2 million new U.S. jobs, cutting the unemployment rate by 1.3% and put the nation on a path toward a low-carbon economy. The report, prepared by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts, proposes $50 billion in tax credits for energy efficiency retrofits and renewable energy systems; $46 billion in direct government spending for public building retrofits, mass transit, freight rail, smart electrical grid systems, and renewable energy systems; and $4 billion for federal loan guarantees to help finance building retrofits and renewable energy projects. The Center believes that clean energy investments would yield about 300,000 more jobs than if the same funds were distributed among U.S. taxpayers. The clean energy investments would also have the added benefits of lower home energy bills and reduced prices for non-renewable energy sources, due to the reduced consumption of those energy sources.[tpl]cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/enn.cfm#id_11979 |title=EERE News: EERE Network News |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |accessdate=2011-07-07[/tpl]
