==Continuing the legacy==

The Other Ones continued the musical legacy of the Grateful Dead, playing many Grateful Dead songs and utilizing a similar jam band style that emphasized musical improvisation.  The name of the band was taken from the title of the Grateful Dead song "That's It for the Other One", from 1968's Anthem of the Sun.  Although Jerry Garcia had died in 1995, "the other ones" from the Grateful Dead carried on.

==Album==

In 1999, The Other Ones released The Strange Remain, a two disk CD recorded live during their 1998 Furthur Festival tour.
