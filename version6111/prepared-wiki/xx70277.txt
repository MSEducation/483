CATEGORIES: Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Groups

SIGCOMM is the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Data Communications, which specializes in the field of communication and computer networks. It is also the name of an annual 'flagship' conference, organized by SIGCOMM, which is considered to be the leading conference in data communications and networking in the world. Known to have an extremely low acceptance rate (~10%), many of the landmark works in Networking and Communications have been published through it. 
Of late, a number of workshops related to networking are also co-located with the SIGCOMM conference. These include Workshop on Challenged Networks (CHANTS), Internet Network Management (INM), Large Scale Attack Defense (LSAD) and Mining Network Data (MineNet).
SIGCOMM also produces a quarterly magazine, Computer Communication Review, with both peer-reviewed and editorial (non-peer reviewed) content, and a bi-monthly refereed journal IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, co-sponsored with IEEE.
The SIGCOMM Award is made annually for outstanding lifetime technical achievement in the fields of data and computer communications and the SIGCOMM Best Student Paper Award is made annually for the outstanding paper at that year's conference.
