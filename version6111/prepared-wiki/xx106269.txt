SWiSH Max is generally considered to be a simpler and less costly Flash creation tool in comparison with Adobe Flash. SWiSH Max does not support some Adobe Flash features such as ActionScript 3.0, shape tweens, and bitmap drawing capabilities. It does, however, include general Flash creation features such as vector drawing, motion tweens, and symbol editing. In addition, SWiSH Max incorporates a number of automated effects and transitions, which make building certain Flash elements such as buttons, advanced transition effects, and interactive Flash sites simpler. One drawback of SWiSH Max is its inability to open or save .fla files, which limits exchanges between other programs to final .swf files.
The scripting used in SWiSH Max is a variation of ActionScript, commonly known as SWiSH script. SWiSH script contains most ActionScript 2.0 functionality, including support for ActionScript 2.0 classes in SWiSH Max 3.
SWiSH Max was designed for the Windows operating system and can run on a PC with a Pentium III 300Â MHz processor, 64MB RAM, and a monitor capable of 1024x768 screen resolution and 16-bit color display.
SWiSH Max3 added features such as a knife drawing tool, advanced shape operations, and ActionScript 2.0 classes.
The latest release of SwiSH Max is SWiSH Max4.
