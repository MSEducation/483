==Vodka==

42 Below used to be a little stronger than most other vodkas (84 proof). It uses a process that is closest to the grain (wheat) based vodka of Scandinavia. 42 Below is made from GE-free wheat.[tpl]Citation needed|date = April 2014[/tpl] The alcoholic content is now reduced to meet government tax levels, so gets a lower tax hence allows it compete with other big brands.[tpl]Cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] The name is supposed to refer to the southern latitude where it is produced just north of Wellington on the country's 42nd parallel and also to its 42% alcohol content.
42 Below flavours include feijoa, passionfruit, kiwifruit, and mānuka honey.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://cocktails.about.com/od/spiritreviews/fr/vodka_42below.htm|title = 42 Below Flavored Vodkas - Manuka Honey and Kiwi|accessdate = 24 April 2014|website = About.com|last = Graham|first = Colleen[/tpl]
