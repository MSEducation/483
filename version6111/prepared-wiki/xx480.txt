Christopher Morris (born 15 June 1962) is an English satirist, writer, director, actor, voice actor, and producer, known for his black humour, surrealism, and controversial subject matter. He has been hailed for his "uncompromising, moralistic drive" by the British Film Institute.[tpl]cite web|title=Morris, Christopher (1963– )|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1392135/index.html|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=29 December 2012[/tpl] His tendency to avoid the media spotlight has seen him become one of the more enigmatic figures in British comedy.
Morris was born in Bristol, and grew up in Huntingdonshire, the son of a village GP. He attended Stonyhurst College, a Catholic boarding school in rural Lancashire. After graduating from the University of Bristol with a degree in zoology, he began his career on BBC Local Radio stations.
In the early 1990s, Morris teamed up with his radio producer, Armando Iannucci, to create On The Hour, a satire of news programmes. This was expanded into a television spin off, The Day Today, which launched the career of Steve Coogan, and has since been hailed as one of the most important satirical shows of the 1990s.[tpl]cite news|author=Elizabeth Day |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/apr/04/disgusting-bliss-chris-morris-biography |title=Disgusting Bliss by Lucian Randall | Book review |work= The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= 4 April 2010|accessdate=18 September 2013 |location=London[/tpl] Morris further developed the satirical news format with Brass Eye, which lampooned celebrities whilst focusing on themes such as crime and drugs. For many, the apotheosis of Morris's career was a Brass Eye special, which dealt with the moral panic surrounding paedophilia. It quickly became one of the most complained about programmes in British television history, leading the Daily Mail to describe him as "the most loathed man on TV".The Guardian (London) 21 February 2003 Review: CHRIS MORRIS: THE MOVIE: The last time he was in the news, it was for the 'paedophile special' of his TV series Brass Eye. Now he's made a film – just 15 minutes long – which is tipped to win a Bafta on Sunday. In a rare interview, Britain's greatest contemporary satirist talks to Xan Brooks about making the film, celebrities and why he won't be tackling the war on terror  BYLINE: Xan Brooks
Meanwhile, Morris's postmodern sketch and ambient music radio show Blue Jam helped him to gain a cult following. He went on to win a BAFTA for Best Short Film after expanding a Blue Jam sketch into My Wrongs 8245–8249 & 117, which starred Paddy Considine. This was followed by Nathan Barley, a sitcom written in collaboration with a then little-known Charlie Brooker that satirised hipsters, and although a ratings bomb, found success upon its DVD release. Morris followed this by joining the cast of the Graham Linehan sitcom The IT Crowd; his first project in which he did not have writing or producing input.
In 2010, Morris directed his first feature-length film, Four Lions, which satirised Islamic terrorism through a group of inept British Pakistanis. Reception of the film was largely positive, earning Morris his second BAFTA, for "Outstanding Debut". Since 2012, he has directed four episodes of Iannucci's political comedy Veep.

===Early life===

Morris was born in Bristol, and grew up in a Victorian farmhouse in the village of Buckden, Huntingdonshire, which he describes as "very dull".If It Bleeds It Leads 6 June 1994 – By Simon Price – From The Melody Maker His father was the Buckden GP.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/7594826/Disgusting-Bliss-the-Brass-Eye-of-ChrisMorris-by-Lucian-Randall-review.html |title=Disgusting Bliss: the Brass Eye of Chris Morris by Lucian Randall: review |publisher=Telegraph |date=15 April 2010 |accessdate=18 September 2013 |location=London |first=Sameer |last=Rahim[/tpl] He has two younger brothers, including theatre director Tom Morris.Profile: Chris Morris, BBC Radio 4 From an early age he was a prankster, and also had a passion for radio.

===Radio career===

On graduating, Morris pursued a career as a musician in various bands, for which he played the bass guitar. He then went to work for Radio West, a local radio station in Bristol. He then took up a news traineeship with BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, where he took advantage of access to editing and recording equipment to create elaborate spoofs and parodies.[tpl]cite news|author=Andy Beckett |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/prank-master-chris-morriss-announcement-of-the-death-of-michael-heseltine-on-radio-1-was-just-one-among-many-notorious-japes-his-satire-is-big-with-the-media-but-how-popular-is-it-with-listeners-1377835.html |title=Prank master: Chris Morris's announcement of the death of Michael Heseltine on Radio 1 was just one among many notorious japes.

In July 1987, he moved on to BBC Radio Bristol to present his own show "No Known Cure", broadcast on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The show was surreal and satirical, with odd interviews conducted with unsuspecting members of the public. He was fired from Bristol in 1990 after "talking over the news bulletins and making silly noises".Morris, the man with a mission to cause offence. – Daily Mail (London) In 1988 he also joined, from its launch, Greater London Radio (GLR). He presented The Chris Morris Show on GLR until 1993, when he was fired after a sketch was broadcast involving a child "outing" celebrities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbjmgt.co.uk/artist/chris-morris |title=Chris Morris / Artists / PBJ – THE exclusive UK-based talent agency.

In 1991, Morris joined Armando Iannucci's spoof news project On the Hour. Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, it saw him work alongside Iannucci, Steve Coogan, Stewart Lee, Richard Herring and Rebecca Front. In 1994, Morris began a weekly evening show, the Chris Morris Music Show, on BBC Radio 1 alongside Peter Baynham and 'man with a mobile phone' Paul Garner. In the shows, Morris perfected the spoof interview style that would become a central component of his Brass Eye programme. In the same year, Morris teamed up with Peter Cook, as Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling, in a series of improvised conversations for BBC Radio 3, entitled Why Bother?.

===Move into television and film===

In 1994, a BBC 2 television series based on On the Hour was broadcast under the name The Day Today. The Day Today made a star of Morris, and marked the television debut of Steve Coogan's Alan Partridge character. The programme ended on a high after just one series, with Morris winning the 1994 British Comedy Award for Best Newcomer for his lead role as the Paxmanesque news anchor.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1460805.stm |title=UK | Chris Morris: Brass Neck |publisher=BBC News |date=27 July 2001 |accessdate=18 September 2013[/tpl]
In 1997, the black humour which had featured in On the Hour and The Day Today became more prominent in Brass Eye, another spoof current affairs television documentary, shown on Channel 4. Brass Eye became known for tricking celebrities and politicians into throwing support behind public awareness campaigns for made-up issues that were often absurd or surreal (such as a drug called cake and an elephant with its trunk stuck up its anus).
From 1997 to 1999 Morris created Blue Jam for BBC Radio 1, a surreal taboo-breaking radio show set to an ambient soundtrack. In 2000 this was followed by Jam, a television reworking. Morris released a 'remix' version of this, entitled Jaaaaam.
In 2001, a reprise of Brass Eye on the moral panic that surrounds paedophilia led to a record-breaking number of complaints – it still remains the third highest on UK television after Celebrity Big Brother 2007 and Jerry Springer: The Opera – as well as heated discussion in the press. Many complainants, some of whom later admitted to not having seen the programme (notably Beverley Hughes, a government minister),[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1335865/Minister-in-Brass-Eye-protest-has-not-even-seen-it.html |title=Minister in Brass Eye protest has not even seen it |first=Andy |last=McSmith |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=31 July 2001 |accessdate=20 May 2009 | location=London[/tpl] felt the satire was directed at the victims of paedophilia, which Morris denies. Channel 4 defended the show, insisting the target was the media and its hysterical treatment of paedophilia, and not victims of crime.
In 2002, Morris ventured into film, directing the short My Wrongs#8245–8249 & 117, adapted from a Blue Jam monologue about a man led astray by a sinister talking dog. It was the first film project of Warp Films, a branch of Warp Records. In 2002 this won the BAFTA for best short film. In 2005 Morris worked on a sitcom entitled Nathan Barley, based on the character created by Charlie Brooker for his website TVGoHome. Co-written by Brooker and Morris, the series was broadcast on Channel 4 in early 2005.

===Post 2005===

Morris was a cast member in The IT Crowd, a Channel 4 sitcom which focused on the information technology department of the fictional company Reynholm Industries. The series was written and directed by Graham Linehan (writer of Father Ted and Black Books, with whom Morris collaborated on The Day Today, Brass Eye and Jam) and produced by Ash Atalla (The Office). Morris played Denholm Reynholm, the eccentric managing director of the company. This marked the first time Morris has acted in a substantial role in a project which he has not developed himself.  Morris's character appeared to leave the series during episode two of the second series. His character made a brief return in the first episode of the third series.
In November 2007, Morris wrote an article for The Observer in response to Ronan Bennett's article published six days earlier in The Guardian. Bennett's article, "Shame on us", accused the novelist Martin Amis of racism. Morris's response, "The absurd world of Martin Amis", was also highly critical of Amis; although he didn't accede to Bennett's accusation of racism, Morris likened Amis to the Muslim cleric Abu Hamza (who was jailed for inciting racial hatred in 2006), suggesting that both men employ "mock erudition, vitriol and decontextualised quotes from the Qu'ran" to incite hatred.[tpl]cite news |last=Morris |first=Chris |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/nov/25/bookscomment.religion |title=The absurd world of Martin Amis |publisher=The Observer |date=25 November 2007 |accessdate=22 June 2008 |quote=Last week Amis was called a racist.

Morris served as script editor for the 2009 series Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle, working with former colleagues Stewart Lee, Kevin Eldon and Armando Iannucci. He maintained this role throughout its second (2011) and third series (2014).
Morris completed his debut feature film Four Lions in late 2009, a satire based on a group of Islamist terrorists in Sheffield.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2009/07/17/set-shot-from-chris-morris-four-lions/|title=Set shot from Chris Morris' Four Lions|publisher=Bleeding Cool.com|accessdate=26 July 2009[/tpl]

==Music==

Morris often co-writes and performs incidental music for his television shows, notably with Jam and the 'extended remix' version, Jaaaaam. In the early 1990s Morris contributed a Pixies parody track entitled "Motherbanger" to a flexi-disc given away with an edition of Select music magazine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQqzF7NdoXI|title=Chris Morris – Mother Banger (Pixies Parody)[/tpl] Morris supplied sketches for British band Saint Etienne's 1993 single "You're in a Bad Way" (the sketch 'Spongbake' appears at the end of the 4th track on the CD single).
