Don MacLaughlin (November 24, 1906 â€“ May 28, 1986) was an American soap opera actor.
He was born on November 24, 1906, in Webster, Iowa, under the name William Donald McLaughlin.
He originated the role of lawyer Chris Hughes on As the World Turns in 1956, and played the role until his death in 1986. Contract negotiations kept him (and his on-screen wife Helen Wagner) off the soap for most of the early 1980s, but the show finally welcomed the two back in a big storyline with heavy uses of past clips from the show: in the story, Chris and his wife Nancy were celebrating their fiftieth wedding anniversary. In real life, As the World Turns was celebrating its thirtieth anniversary on the air.
Prior to TV, MacLaughlin starred as the title character on radio's David Harding, Counterspy in the 1940s and 50s. Old time radio sites have broadcasts available.  He appeared in a 1948 Broadway production of Thornton Wilder's play The Happy Journey to Trenton and Camden.Don MacLaughlin at the Internet Broadway Database
