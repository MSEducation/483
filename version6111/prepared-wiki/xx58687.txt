The catchphrase "He Who Dares, Wins" was commonly used by Del Boy in British sitcom Only Fools and Horses.
The motto has been used by twelve elite special forces units around the world that in some way have historical ties to the British SAS.
An early statement of the idea is 'τοῖς τολμῶσιν ἡ τύχη ξύμφορος' ("fortune favours the bold") from the Ancient Greek soldier and historian Thucydides.
