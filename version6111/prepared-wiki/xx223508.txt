==History==

After being members of the Welsh League since the 1930s, in 1992 the club was one of the founder members of the League of Wales. After getting relegated in 1994, they bounced straight back as Welsh League Champions in 1994-95. They then spent another two years in Wales' top flight before being relegated again.
Since their second relegation back to the Welsh League, the club has dropped through the divisions to the point where in 2008 it was relegated to Division Three.
