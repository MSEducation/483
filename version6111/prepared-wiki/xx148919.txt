[[The Year 1941 (Prokofiev)]]

CATEGORIES: Suites by Sergei Prokofiev, 1941 compositions

Sergei Prokofiev wrote the symphonic suite The Year 1941 (Op. 90) in 1941.

==Background==

Prokofiev, along with other composers, was evacuated to Caucasus when Germany started attacking the Soviet Union in 1941. It was under such circumstances that Prokofiev began work on this symphonic suite. He was working on his epic opera War and Peace and the String Quartet No. 2 at the same time.

==Movements==

The whole suite lasts for around 15 minutes.

==Criticism==

Dmitri Shostakovich criticized the work's weak movements, lack of development and thought that the materials were under-developed and not thought through. Even Nikolai Myaskovsky, Prokofiev's closest friend, did not like the work. The suite has been described as evoking cold, abstract and inexpressive images in an attempt to oversimplify for greater clarity and comprehensibility.[tpl]cite book|last=Nestyev|first=Israel|title=Prokofiev|year=1961|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0804705851|pages=374[/tpl] However, the work does contain a wealth of melodic material and Prokofiev later used some of the ideas and motives for the film score to Igor Andreevich Savchenko’s (1906-1950) depiction of the events of the Great Patriotic War, Partisans in the Ukrainian Steppes (1942, film released 1943).
In 1948, Party officials, namely Tikhon Khrennikov, deemed the music unworthy of truly depicting the momentous events of the Great Patriotic War, and the Central Committee criticized it for its “anti-democratic, formalist tendency.” Sovetskaya Muzyka (Soviet Music magazine) also noted that “the music of the Suite, while at times very poetic, does not penetrate to the core of the events which are indissolubly associated, in our minds, with the tragic year of 1941”.[tpl]cite book|last=Nestyev|first=Israel|title=Prokofiev|year=1961|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0804705851|pages=328[/tpl] The Year 1941 remained unpublished and was subsequently barred from performance.
