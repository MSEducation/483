Much of his work was set in the Riverina region. His great-grandfather was Frederick Jenkins, who started Buckinbong Station.

==Critical Appraisal==

According to Ron Blaber (in the  Australian Dictionary of Biography) although Thwaites was: "seen by critics as romantic and sentimental, his thirty-one adventure novels—characterized by themes of struggle and redemption—were immensely popular, particularly with lending libraries, and sold more than four million copies. Written in 'tempestuous prose', they were crammed with incident and swung between Australian and exotic settings."
