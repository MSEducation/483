==Road to Kiev==

Six Ukrainian Premier League clubs that competed last year in the Soviet Supreme League started from the second round (1/8) of which included both Chornomorets and Metalist.
The two teams had some difficulties along the way. Chornomorets surprisingly lost its first game in Zhytomyr to Polissya 1:4 (!), but reinstated themselves in the return leg with a colossal 7:1 win. Then had to visit Zaporizhia two rounds in a row before qualifying for this final. Metalist came to the final after defeating Shakhtar in the semi-finals and were considered able to repeat their previous Soviet achievement by earning another national trophy.
