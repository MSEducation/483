James Wilson (3 June 1805 – 11 August 1860) was a Scottish businessman, economist and Liberal politician. He founded The Economist and the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China (which became Standard Chartered).

==Early life==

Wilson was born in Hawick in the Borders. His wealthy father William Wilson owned a textile mill, and his ancestors were local sheep farmers. He was the fourth of 15 children, of whom 10 reached adulthood. His mother died when James was young.[tpl]cite book|last=Bagehot|first=Walter|title=The collected works of Walter Bagehot|editor=Forrest Morgan|publisher=Routledge|volume=4|chapter=Memoir of Right Hon. James Wilson|isbn=978-0-415-13154-4[/tpl]
A successful disciplined autodidact scholar from a Quaker family, he was destined to be a schoolmaster but hated it so much that he "would rather to be the most menial servant in his father's mill". After considering studying for election to the Faculty of Advocates, against his family religion, he decided to be schooled in economics. So at the age of 16, he became an apprentice in a hat factory. Later, his father then bought the business for him and his elder brother, William. They left Scotland and moved to London, England when James was 19, with a gift of £2,000 each (£130,000 in 2005 pounds).[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]

==Business career in London==

The brothers established a manufacturing factory – Wilson, Irwin & Wilson – that they dissolved it in 1831. Wilson continued in the same line of business with much success (his net worth was £25,000 in 1837, or £1,630,000 in 2005 pounds). During the economic crisis of 1837, he lost most of his wealth when the price of indigo fell. By 1839 he sold most of his property and avoided bankruptcy. However, in 1853 he founded The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, which later merged with the Standard Bank to form Standard Chartered Bank in 1969.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]

==Journalistic career==

Wilson was generally opposed to privileging the Church of England, the secret ballot when it was proposed in 1853, and the Corn Laws. He wrote a pamphlet titled Influences of the Corn Laws, as affection all classes of the comminity, and particularly the landed interests. It slowly received positive feedback and Wilson's fame had grown. He then went on writing on currency, and especially The Revenue; or, What should the Chancellor do?. He started to write for newspapers, including the Manchester Guardian. In 1843 he established The Economist as a newspaper to campaign for free trade, and acted as Chief editor and sole proprietor for sixteen years. The Economist is still published today, now with a weekly circulation of over 1.6 million globally.The Economist circulation statistics

He was sent to India to establish the tax structure, a new paper currency and remodel the finance system of India after the revolt of 1857. However, he was in office only a year before he died. In 1860 he refused to leave the stifling summer heat of Calcutta, contracted dysentery and died in August of that year, aged 55.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] 
Strangely even though he contributed greatly to the financial set-up of the British empire in India, he lay buried unknown at a cemetery at Mullick Bazar in Kolkata. His grave was discovered in 2007 by CP Bhatia, an assistant commissioner of Income Tax, while he was researching a book on India's tax history. Due to the efforts of CP Bhatia the tombstone was restored by the Christian Burial Board, thus restoring some dignity to a man that was in a way one of the forefathers of the Indian Tax structure.business-standard.com 'In British times, the opium trade protected people from taxes'telegraphindia.com "Taxman rediscovers father of taxation"
