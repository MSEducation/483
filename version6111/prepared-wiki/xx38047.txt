==History==

Founded in June 1985, the studio is headed by the directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and the producer Toshio Suzuki. Prior to the formation of the studio, Miyazaki and Takahata had already had long careers in Japanese film and television animation and had worked together on Hols: Prince of the Sun and Panda! Go, Panda!; and Suzuki was an editor at Tokuma Shoten's Animage manga magazine.
The studio was founded after the success of the 1984 film Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, written and directed by Miyazaki for Topcraft and distributed by Toei Company. The origins of the film lie in the first two volumes of a serialized manga written by Miyazaki for publication in Animage as a way of generating interest in an anime version.[tpl]cite journal | title = First of Two-part Miyazaki Feature | journal=Animerica | volume = 1 | issue = 5 |date=July 1993 | page = 4[/tpl] Suzuki was part of the production team on the film and founded Studio Ghibli with Miyazaki, who also invited Takahata to join the new studio.
The studio has mainly produced films by Miyazaki, with the second most prolific director being Takahata (most notably with Grave of the Fireflies). Other directors who have worked with Studio Ghibli include Yoshifumi Kondo, Hiroyuki Morita and Gorō Miyazaki. Composer Joe Hisaishi has provided the soundtracks for most of Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli films. In their book Anime Classics Zettai!, Brian Camp and Julie Davis made note of Michiyo Yasuda as "a mainstay of Studio Ghibli’s extraordinary design and production team".[tpl]cite book |last1=Camp |first1=Brian |last2=Davis | first2=Julie|date=September 15, 2007 |title=Anime Classics Zettai |url=http://www.stonebridge.com/shopexd.asp?id=3|page=292 |location=Berkeley California |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |isbn=978-1-933330-22-8 |accessdate=February 14, 2014[/tpl]
In August 1996, Disney and Tokuma Shoten Publishing agreed that Disney would distribute international Tokuma's Studio Ghibli animated films.[tpl]cite news|title=August Issue News Section:Disney Will Distribute Japanese Animation|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.5/articles/newsmag1.5.html|accessdate=19 July 2011|newspaper=Animation World Magazine|date=August 1996[/tpl]
Many of Ghibli's works are distributed in Japan by Toho. Internationally, The Walt Disney Company has rights to all of Ghibli's output that did not have previous international distribution, including the global, non-Japan distribution rights to Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009|reason=which works had previous international distribution and who are the distributors?[/tpl] As of September 2011, they share North American theatrical rights with GKids while domestic right remain with Disney.GKids to distribute 13 Ghibli anime films in US
Over the years, there has been a close relationship between Studio Ghibli and the magazine Animage, which regularly runs exclusive articles on the studio and its members in a section titled "Ghibli Notes." Artwork from Ghibli's films and other works are frequently featured on the cover of the magazine. Between 1999 and 2005 Studio Ghibli was a subsidiary of Tokuma Shoten, the publisher of Animage.
In October 2001, the Ghibli Museum opened in Tokyo. It contains exhibits based on Studio Ghibli films and shows animations, including a number of short Studio Ghibli films not available elsewhere.
The studio is also known for its strict "no-edits" policy in licensing their films abroad due to Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind being heavily edited for the film's release in the United States as Warriors of the Wind. The "no cuts" policy was highlighted when Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein suggested editing Princess Mononoke to make it more marketable. A Studio Ghibli producer is rumoured to have sent an authentic Japanese sword with a simple message: "No cuts".[tpl]cite news |title=A god among animators |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,1569689,00.html |first=Xan |last=Brooks |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=September 14, 2005 |quote=There is a rumour that when Harvey Weinstein was charged with handling the US release of Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki sent him a samurai sword in the post.

On February 1, 2008, Toshio Suzuki stepped down from the position of Studio Ghibli president, which he had held since 2005, and Koji Hoshino (former president of Walt Disney Japan) took over. Suzuki said he wanted to improve films with his own hands as a producer, rather than demanding this from his employees. Suzuki decided to hand over the presidency to Hoshino because Hoshino has helped Studio Ghibli to sell its videos since 1996, also helping to release the Princess Mononoke film in the United States.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mainichi.jp/enta/mantan/news/20080201mog00m200025000c.html |title=スタジオジブリ社長に星野康二氏 |accessdate=February 1, 2008 |language=Japanese[/tpl] Suzuki still serves on the company's board of directors.

Sunday, September 1, 2013, Hayao Miyazaki held a press conference in Venice, confirming his retirement saying: “I know I’ve said I would retire many times in the past. Many of you must think, `Once again.’ But this time I am quite serious..." Now it is time for Hayao's son, Goro Miyazaki, to take the torch and follow in his father's footsteps.http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/09/06/hayao-miyazaki-retirement/
On January 31, 2014, it was announced that Gorō Miyazaki will direct his first anime TV series, Sanzoku no Musume Rōnya, an adaptation of Astrid Lindgren's Ronia the Robber's Daughter for NHK.
