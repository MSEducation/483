The genetic mutations leading to light skin, though different among East Asians and Western Europeans, suggest the two groups experienced a similar selective pressure due to settlement in northern latitudes.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Juzeniene |first1=Asta |last2=Setlow |first2=Richard |last3=Porojnicu |first3=Alina |last4=Steindal |first4=Arnfinn Hykkerud |last5=Moan |first5=Johan |title=Development of different human skin colors: A review highlighting photobiological and photobiophysical aspects |journal=Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology |volume=96 |pages=93–100 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2009.04.009 |pmid=19481954 |issue=2[/tpl] At what point these developments took place for sub-populations of Homo sapiens (and whether light skin also occurred independently in Homo neanderthalensis) is under debate. There is a long-standing hypothesis that the selection for lighter skin due to higher vitamin D absorption occurred soon after the Out of Africa migration some time before 40,000 years ago. A number of researchers disagree with this and suggest that the northern latitudes permitted enough synthesis of vitamin D combined with food sources from hunting to keep populations healthy, and only when agriculture was adopted was there a need for lighter skin to maximize the synthesis of vitamin D. The theory suggests that the reduction of game meat, fish, and some plants from the diet resulted in skin turning light many thousands of years after settlement in Eurasia.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=R. |last2=Khan |first2=B.S.

The length of time is also affected by cultural practices such as food intake, clothing, body coverings, and shelter usage which can alter the ways in which the environment affects populations.[[File:Homo neanderthalensis adult male - head model - Smithsonian Museum of Natural History - 2012-05-17.jpg|thumb|upright|Reconstruction of the head of the Shanidar 1 fossil, a Neanderthal male who lived c. 70,000 years ago (John Gurche 2010).

Our data suggest that inactive MC1R variants evolved independently in both modern humans and Neanderthals."[/ref]]] One of the most recently proposed drivers of the evolution of skin pigmentation in humans is based on research that shows a superior barrier function in darkly pigmented skin. Most protective functions of the skin, including the permeability barrier and the antimicrobial barrier, reside in the stratum corneum (SC) and the researchers surmise that the SC has undergone the most genetic change since the loss of human body hair. Natural selection would have favored mutations that protect this essential barrier; one such protective adaptation is the pigmentation of interfollicular epidermis, because it improves barrier function as compared to non-pigmented skin. In lush rainforests, however, where UV-B radiation and xeric stress were not in excess, light pigmentation would not have been nearly as detrimental. This explains the side-by-side residence of lightly pigmented and darkly pigmented peoples.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Elias|first1=P. M.|author2=G. Menon, B. K. Wetzel, J. W. Williams|title=Barrier requirements as the evolutionary "driver" of epidermal pigmentation in humans|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|year=2010|volume=22|issue=4|pages=526–537|doi=10.1002/ajhb.21043|pmid=20209486|pmc=3071612[/tpl]
Population and admixture studies suggest a three-way model for the evolution of human skin colour, with dark skin evolving in early hominids in Africa and light skin evolving partly separately at least two times after modern humans had expanded out of Africa.
For the most part, the evolution of light skin has followed different genetic paths in Western and Eastern Eurasian populations. Two genes however, KITLG and ASIP, have mutations associated with lighter skin that have high frequencies in Eurasian populations and have estimated origin dates after humans spread out of Africa but before the divergence of the two lineages.  All modern humans share a common ancestor who lived around 200,000 years ago in Africa. Comparisons between known skin pigmentation genes in chimpanzees and modern Africans show that dark skin evolved along with the loss of body hair about 1.2 million years ago and is the ancestral state of all humans. Investigations into dark skinned populations in South Asia and Melanesia indicate that skin pigmentation in these populations is due to the preservation of this ancestral state and not due to new variations on a previously lightened population.

==Age==

In Hominids the parts of the body not covered with hair, like the face and the back of the hands, starts out pale in infants and turns darker as animals are exposed to more sun. All human babies are born pale, regardless of what their adult color will be. In humans, melanin production does not peak until after puberty.
The skin of children becomes darker as they go through puberty and experience the effects of sex hormones.This darkening is especially noticeable in the skin of the nipples, the areola of the nipples, the labia majora in females, and the scrotum in males. In some people, the armpits become slightly darker during puberty. The interaction of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors on skin coloration with age is still not adequately understood, but it is known that men are at their darkest baseline skin colour around the age of 30, without considering the effects of tanning. Around the same age, women experience darkening of some areas of their skin.
Human’s skin color fades with age. Humans over the age of thirty have decreased melanin producing cells by about 10 to 20 percent per decade as melanocyte stem cells gradually die. The skin of face and hands has about twice the amount of pigment cells as unexposed areas of the body, as chronic exposure to the sun continues to stimulate melanocytes. The blotchy appearance of skin color of people of old age in the face and hands is due to the uneven distribution of pigment cells and to changes in the interaction between melanocytes and keratinocytes.

==Sexual dimorphism==

It has been observed that adult human females are consistently lighter in skin pigmentation than males in the same population. This form of sexual dimorphism is due to the requirement in human females for high amounts of calcium during pregnancy and lactation. Breastfeeding newborns, whose skeletons are growing, require high amounts of calcium intake from the mother’s milk (about 4 times more than during prenatal development),[tpl]cite journal|last=Kovacs|first=Christine|title=Vitamin D in pregnancy and lactation: maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes from human and animal studies|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|year=2008|volume=88|issue=2|page=520S–528S[/tpl] part of which comes from reserves in the mother's skeleton. Adequate vitamin D resources are needed to absorb calcium from the diet, and it has been shown that deficiencies of vitamin D and calcium increase the likelihood of various birth defects such as spina bifida and rickets. Natural selection has led to females with lighter skin than males in all indigenous populations because women must get enough vitamin D and calcium to support the development of fetus and nursing infant and to maintain their own health.
The sexes also differ in how they change their skin color with age. Men and women are not born with different skin color, they begin to diverge during puberty with the influence of sex hormones. Women can also change pigmentation in certain parts of their body, such as the areola, during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy and between 50 and 70% of pregnant women will develop the “mask of pregnancy” (melasma or chloasma) in the cheeks, upper lips, forehead, and chin. This is caused by increases in the female hormones estrogen and progesterone and it can develop in women who take birth control pills or participate in hormone replacement therapy.[tpl]cite journal|last=Costin and Hearing|title=Human skin pigmentation: Melanocytes modulate skin color in response to stress|journal=FASEB Journal|year=2007|volume=21|issue=4|pages=976–994|pmid=17242160|last2=Hearing|first2=V. J.|doi=10.1096/fj.06-6649rev[/tpl]

==Disorders of skin pigmentation==

Uneven pigmentation of some sort affects most people, regardless of bioethnic background or skin color. Skin may either appear lighter, or darker than normal, or lack pigmentation at all; there may be blotchy, uneven areas, patches of brown to gray discoloration or freckling. Skin pigmentation disorders occur because the body produces either too much or too little melanin.

===Depigmentation===

Various types of albinism are a result of a genetic mutations affecting different parts of the melanin production pathway. In a case of albinism, melanocytes can be entirely absent, fail to produce melanin, or melanosomes can fail to mature and be transferred to keranocytes. The ability to produce melanin in paths around the body is a condition known as vitiligo.

====Albinism====

Some types of albinism affect only the skin and hair, while other types affect the skin, hair and eyes, and in rare cases only the eyes. All of them are caused by different genetic mutations. Albinism is a recessively inherited trait in humans where both pigmented parents may be carriers of the gene and passed it down to their children.  Each child has a 25% chance of being albino and a 75% chance of having a normally pigmented children.Cummings (2011. "Human Heridity Principles and Issues". Cengage 9th edition. Retrieved 2014-02-16. One of the most common type of albinism is oculocutaneous albinism or OCA which has many subtypes which are caused by different genetic mutations.
Albinism is a serious problem in areas of high sunlight intensity, leading to extreme sun sensitivity, skin cancer, and eye damage.
Albinism is more common in some parts of the world than in others, but it is estimated that 1 in 70 humans carry the gene for OCA.
The most severe type of albinism is OCA1A, which is characterized by complete, lifelong loss of melanin production, other forms of OCA1B, OCA2, OCA3, OCA4, show some form of melanin accumulation and are less severe. The four known types of OCA are caused by mutations in the TYR, OCA2, TYRP1, and SLC45A2 genes.
Albinos often face social and cultural challenges (even threats), as the condition is often a source of ridicule, racism, fear, and violence. Many cultures around the world have developed beliefs regarding people with albinism. Albinos are persecuted in Tanzania by witchdoctors, who use the body parts of albinos as ingredients in rituals and potions, as they thought to possess magical power.BBC (27 July 2008). "Tanzania Albinos Targeted Again". BBC News (online edition). Retrieved 2010-01-03.

====Vitiligo====

Vitiligo is a condition that causes depigmentation of sections of skin. It occurs when melanocytes die or are unable to function. The cause of vitiligo is unknown, but research suggests that it may arise from autoimmune, genetic, oxidative stress, neural, or viral causes.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Halder | first1 = RM | last2 = Chappell | first2 = JL | title = Vitiligo update | journal = Seminars in cutaneous medicine and surgery | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 86–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19608058 | doi = 10.1016/j.sder.2009.04.008 [/tpl] The incidence worldwide is less than 1%.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nath SK, Majumder PP, Nordlund JJ |title=Genetic epidemiology of vitiligo: multilocus recessivity cross-validated |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=981–90 |year=1994 |pmid=7977362 |pmc=1918341[/tpl] Individuals affected by vitiligo sometimes suffer psychological discomfort because of their appearance.

===Hyperpigmentation===

Increased melanin production, also known as hyperpigmentation, can be:
Aside from sun exposure and hormones, hyperpigmentation can be caused by skin damage, such as remnants of blemishes, wounds or rashes.Cutis, August 2005, pp 19–23 This is especially true for those with darker skin tones.
The most typical cause of darkened areas of skin, brown spots or areas of discoloration is unprotected sun exposure. Once incorrectly referred to as liver spots, these pigment problems are not connected with the liver.
On lighter to medium skin tones, solar lentigenes emerge as small- to medium-sized brown patches of freckling that can grow and accumulate over time on areas of the body that receive the most unprotected sun exposure, such as the back of the hands, forearms, chest, and face. For those with darker skin colors, these discolorations can appear as patches or areas of ashen-gray skin.

==Exposure to sun==

Melanin in the skin protects the body by absorbing solar radiation. In general, the more melanin there is in the skin the more solar radiation can be absorbed. Excessive solar radiation causes direct and indirect DNA damage to the skin and the body naturally combats and seeks to repair the damage and protect the skin by creating and releasing further melanin into the skin's cells. With the production of the melanin, the skin color darkens, but can also cause sunburn. The tanning process can also be created by artificial UV radiation.
There are two different mechanisms involved. Firstly, the UVA-radiation creates oxidative stress, which in turn oxidizes existing melanin and leads to rapid darkening of the melanin, also known as IPD (immediate pigment darkening). Secondly, there is an increase in production of melanin known as melanogenesis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Agar, Nita; Young, Antony R. |title=Melanogenesis: a photoprotective response to DNA damage? |journal=Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis |volume=571 |issue=1–2 |pages=121–132 |year=2005 |pmid=15748643 |doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2004.11.016[/tpl] Melanogenesis leads to delayed tanning and first becomes visible about 72 hours after exposure. The tan that is created by an increased melanogenesis lasts much longer than the one that is caused by oxidation of existing melanin. Tanning involves not just the increased melanin production in response to UV radiation but the thickening of the top layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum.
A person's natural skin color has an impact on their reaction to exposure to the sun. Generally, those who start out with darker skin colour and more melanin have better abilities to tan. Individuals with very light skin and albinos have no ability to tan.[tpl]cite book|last=Fitzpatrick|first=T. B.|title=Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine|year=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=819–825|chapter=Normal skin color and general considerations of pigmentary disorders[/tpl] The biggest differences resulting from sun exposure are visible in individuals who start out with moderately pigmented brown skin: the change is dramatically visible as tan lines, where parts of the skin which tanned are delineated from unexposed skin.
Modern lifestyles and mobility have created mismatch between skin colour and environment for many individuals. Vitamin D deficiencies and UVR overexposure are concerns for many. It is important for these people to individually determine their diet and lifestyle according to their skin colour, the environment they live in, and the time of the year. When exposed to UVB, the entire exposed area of body’s skin of a highly dark-skinned person is able to between 3500 - 6500 IU of vitamin D, while a lightly pigmented person is able to make 10000-20000 IU of vitamin D. For practical purposes, such as exposure time for sun tanning, six skin types are distinguished following Fitzpatrick (1975), listed in order of decreasing lightness:

===Fitzpatrick scale===

Dark skin with large concentrations of melanin protects against ultraviolet light and skin cancers; light-skinned people have about a tenfold greater risk of dying from skin cancer, compared with dark-skinned persons, under equal sunlight exposure. Furthermore, UV-A rays from sunlight are believed to interact with folic acid in ways that may damage health.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Vorobey |first1=P |last2=Steindal |first2=AE |last3=Off |first3=MK |last4=Vorobey |first4=A |last5=Moan |first5=J |title=Influence of human serum albumin on photodegradation of folic acid in solution |journal=Photochemistry and photobiology |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=817–22 |year=2006 |pmid=16454580 |doi=10.1562/2005-11-23-RA-739[/tpl] In a number of traditional societies the sun was avoided as much as possible, especially around noon when the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight is at its most intense.

Modern lifestyles and mobility have created mismatch between skin colour and environment for many individuals. Vitamin D deficiencies and UVR overexposure are concerns for many. It is important for these people to individually determine their diet and lifestyle according to their skin colour, the environment they live in, and the time of the year. When exposed to UVB, the entire exposed area of body’s skin of a highly dark-skinned person is able to make between 3500 - 6500 IU of vitamin D, while a lightly pigmented person is able to make 10000-20000 IU of vitamin D.

==Geographic variation==

Approximately 10% of the variance in skin color occurs within regions, and approximately 90% occurs between regions.[tpl]Cite journal|title = Apportionment of global human genetic diversity based on craniometrics and skin color.|year = 2002|last = Relethford|first = J.

Furthermore, in some parts of the world where people from different regions have mixed extensively, the connection between skin color and ancestry has substantially weakened.[tpl]Cite journal|title = Implications of correlations between skin color and genetic ancestry for biomedical research|year = 2004|url = http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~parraest/profile/PDF%20files/Parra%20et%20al.%202004%20-Nature%20Genetics.pdf|last = Parra, EJ et. al|journal = Nature Genetics|volume = 36|issue = 11s|pages = 54–60|doi = 10.1038/ng1440|pmid=15508005|first1 = E J|last2 = Kittles|first2 = R A|last3 = Shriver|first3 = M D[/tpl] In Brazil, for example, skin color is not closely associated with the percentage of recent African ancestors a person has, as estimated from an analysis of genetic variants differing in frequency among continent groups.[tpl]Cite journal|title = Color and genomic ancestry in Brazilians|year = 2003|last = Parra, FC et al.|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|issue = 1|volume = 100|pages = 177–182|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0126614100|pmc=140919|pmid=12509516|first1 = F.

In general, people living close to the equator are highly darkly pigmented, and those living near the poles are generally very lightly pigmented. The rest of humanity shows a high degree of skin color variation between these two extremes, generally correlating with UV exposure. The main exception to this rule is in the New World, where people have only lived for about 10,000 to 15,000 years and show a less pronounced degree of skin pigmentation.
In recent times,[tpl]When|date=August 2013[/tpl] humans have become increasingly mobile as a consequence of improved technology, domestication, environmental change, strong curiosity, and risk-taking. Migrations over the last 4000 years, and especially the last 400 years, have been the fastest in human history and have led to many people settling in places far away from their ancestral homelands. This means that skin colors today are not as confined to geographical location as they were previously.

==Social status, colorism and racism==

thumb|right|200px|Skin colors according to von Luschan's chromatic scale According to classical scholar Frank Snowden, skin color did not determine social status in ancient Egypt, Greece or Rome. Relations between the major power and the subordinate state was viewed as more significant in a person's status than was their skin color.[tpl]harvnb|Snowden|1970[/tpl].
The preferred skin tone varies by culture and has varied over time. A number of indigenous African groups, such as the Maasai, associated pale skin with being cursed or caused by evil spirits associated with witchcraft. They would abandon their children born with conditions such as albinism and showed a sexual preference for darker skin.Africa: Dispelling Myths about Albinism, Pambazuka News, 10 September 2009
Many cultures have historically favored lighter skin for women. In Europe, before the Industrial Revolution, pale skin was preferred and was a sign of high social status. The poorer classes worked outdoors and got darker skin from exposure to the sun, while the upper class stayed indoors and had light skin. Light skin became associated with wealth and high position.[tpl]Cite web|first=Karl |last=Kruszelnicki |title=News in Science: Skin Colour 1 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2001/03/01/249992.htm?site=science/greatmomentsinscience|ref=harv |postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl] Women would even put lead-based cosmetics on their skin to artificially whiten their skin tone.[tpl]cite journal | url = http://journals.lww.com/melanomaresearch/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2006&issue=02000&article=00012&type=abstract | last1 = Agredano | title = Accessibility to air travel correlates strongly with increasing melanoma incidence | first1 = YZ | last2 = Chan | first2 = JL | last3 = Kimball | first3 = RC | last4 = Kimball | first4 = AB | author8 = Agredano, Yolanda Z.; Chan, Joanna L.; Kimball, Ranch C.; Kimball, Alexa B. | journal = Melanoma Research | date = February 2006 | volume =  16 | issue =  1 | pmid = 16432460 | pages = 77–81 | doi = 10.1097/01.cmr.0000195696.50390.23 [/tpl] However, when not strictly monitored, these cosmetics caused lead poisoning. Achieving a light-skinned appearance was additionally brought about in various other ways, including the use of arsenic to whiten skin, and powders. Other methods included wearing full-length clothes when outdoors, including gloves and parasols.

Thus, skin whitening cosmetic products are popular in East Asia.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/05/13/asia.whitening/|title=Skin Deep: Dying to be White|publisher=CNN|date=2002-05-15 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-03-23[/tpl] 4 out of 10 women surveyed in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines and South Korea used a skin-whitening cream, and more than 60 companies globally compete for Asia's estimated $18 billion market.Skin whitening big business in Asia.

Today, though a preference for lighter skin remains prevalent in the United States, many within the country regard tanned skin as both more attractive and healthier than pale skin.[tpl]cite web|title=Use of Sunscreen, Sunburning Rates, and Tanning Bed Use Among More Than 10 000 US Children and Adolescents|publisher=pediatrics.aappublications.org|date=2002-06-06 |quote=(PEDIATRICS Vol. 109 No. 6)|accessdate=2010-09-14|pages=1009–1014|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/109/6/1009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119318887/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 |title=Effects of Suntan on Judgements of Healthiness and Attractiveness by Adolescents – Broadstock – 2006 – Journal of Applied Social Psychology – Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date=2006-07-31 |accessdate=2012-08-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119292742/abstract |title=The Social Psychology of Tanning and Sunscreen Use: Self-Presentational Motives as a Predictor of Health Risk – Leary – 2006 – Journal of Applied Social Psychology – Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date=2006-07-31 |accessdate=2012-08-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news78679968.html |title=Tan is 'In': Study Finds Light Brown More Attractive than Pale or Dark Skin |publisher=Physorg.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18[/tpl] Western mass media and popular culture continued to reinforce negative stereotypes about dark skin,[tpl]Cite web|first=Steven |last=Balkaran|title=Mass Media and Racism |year=1999 |url=http://www.yale.edu/ypq/articles/oct99/oct99b.html|ref=harv|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] but in some circles pale skin has become associated with indoor office work while tanned skin has become associated with increased leisure time, sportiness and good health that comes with wealth and higher social status.
