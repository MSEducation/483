The Flag of Saint Helena was adopted on October 4, 1984. It is a defaced Blue Ensign, i.e., blue with the flag of the UK in the upper hoist-side quadrant and the Saint Helena shield centred on the outer half of the flag. The coat of arms of Saint Helena features a rocky coastline and three-masted sailing ship, with a Saint Helena Plover atop. Prior to the adoption of the current coat of arms and flag in 1984, the flag and shield showed the ship and coastal scene taken from the colonial seal of the colony.
Ships registered in Saint Helena fly the Red Ensign; there is no defaced variant for the territory.Flags of the World St Helena
