==Season==

Kentucky opened with a 38–14 loss to Louisville, then lost 24–3 at Cincinnati due to repeated special teams breakdowns.  A game in a driving rainstorm against Indiana remained a scoreless tie until the final seconds when a Kentucky field goal led to a 3–0 win.  A 65–0 loss at Florida and 35–7 loss at Alabama were followed by Kentucky blowing a second half lead to lose 25–14 to South Carolina.  After a 41–14 loss at LSU, Kentucky stood at 1–5 on the season and the firing of head coach Bill Curry was announced.  The Wildcats responded by reeling off three victories in a row: 24–17 against Georgia, 24–21 against Mississippi State and 25–0 against Vanderbilt.  A 56–10 loss to Tennessee ended the season with the Wildcats at 4–7.1997 Kentucky Wildcats Football Media Guide, p.209[tpl]cite web|title=1996 Kentucky Wildcats scores|url=http://www.jhowell.net/cf/scores/Kentucky.htm#1996|work=jhowell.ent|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kJByYIFZ|archivedate=October 5, 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=October 3, 2009[/tpl]
