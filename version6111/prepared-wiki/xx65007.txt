[[IBM Lotus Organizer]]

CATEGORIES: Lotus SmartSuite, Lotus Software software, OS/2 software, Personal information managers

Lotus Organizer was a personal information manager (PIM). It was initially developed by Threadz, a small British software house, reaching version 3.0. Organizer was subsequently acquired by Lotus Development Corporation, for whom the package was a Windows-based replacement for Lotus Agenda. For several years it was the unquestioned market leader until it was gradually overtaken by Microsoft Outlook.
Organizer is notable for using the ″leather-bound personal organizer″ graphical metaphor for its user interface. It is often bundled within Lotus SmartSuite.

==Status==

Product withdrawn. On 14 May 2013 IBM announced "Software withdrawal and discontinuance of support: Lotus SmartSuite , Lotus Organizer and Lotus 123". *http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS913-091

IBM no longer (from May 2013) continues to support and ship Lotus Organizer. Version 6.1 was the last version. It supported Windows 2000 and Windows XP.
In regard to Windows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit editions), IBM states: 
“The 32-bit version and 64-bit version of Windows 7 are supported by IBM/Lotus. No major compatibility issues have been reported when running SmartSuite or Organizer on the Windows 7 rawversion. Therefore, Lotus Product Support is available to take calls related to Windows 7 from licensed SmartSuite and Organizer customers who are on active maintenance.... The version SmartSuite Millennium or Lotus Organizer that lists Windows XP also works on Windows Vista and Windows 7.”

==Versions==

===Microsoft Windows===

Organizer is a part of Lotus SmartSuite, but is also sold as a single application. The latest releases of SmartSuite do not include the current version of Organizer; it is sold separately only.
Versions up to 2 were 16-bit programs. Later versions are 32-bit programs.

===IBM OS/2===

The first OS/2 version was released in 1998. Until then, the Windows 16-bit version had been used. The last version is 1.7 from 2001. Later revisions of SmartSuite did not upgrade Organizer, although some fixes have been made.
Organizer for OS/2 uses the .or4 file format. This means that it cannot exchange data files with the later Windows versions, other than by importing and exporting data.
The features and user interface for Organizer for OS/2 are similar to that of Organizer 97 for Windows. It lacks later improvements, such as importing and exporting vCard and iCalendar files, and synchronisation with PDAs.
