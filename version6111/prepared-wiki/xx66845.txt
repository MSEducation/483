Sansoen Phra Barami or Sanrasoen Phra Barami ([tpl]lang-th|สรรเสริญพระบารมี[/tpl], lit: Glorify his prestige.) is the royal anthem of Thailand. The lyrics were composed by Prince Narisaranuvadtivongs, around 1913, and were later revised by King Rama VI. 
There is no certainty about the identity of the song's composer. The music may have been  composed by a Russian composer named Pyotr Schurovsky[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl], while other sources mention several Thai musicians and the Dutch musician Heutzen as the authors.

The royal anthem is performed during state occasions, as well as when a high-ranking member of the royal family is present for a function.  In addition, the royal anthem is still played before the beginning of each film in movie theatres, as well as before the commencement of the first act in plays, musicals, concerts, and most other live performances of music or theatre in Thailand. At the beginning and closing of television and radio programing, the anthem is also played. For example, Channel 7 airs a video of the anthem, with pictures of King Bhumibol Adulyadej from his birth to the present day shown.
In April, 2008, it was reported that a Thai citizen was facing criminal charges of lèse majesté for failing to stand for the playing of the Royal Anthem at a movie theatre in Bangkok.http://www.bangkokpost.com/News/23Apr2008_news04.php
