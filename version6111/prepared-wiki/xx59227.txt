Nantucket Airlines is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cape Air based in Hyannis, Massachusetts, United States.  
The airline offers regularly scheduled passenger service between Barnstable Municipal Airport in Hyannis and Nantucket Memorial Airport on the island of Nantucket. Nantucket also has service from Boston Logan Airport to Nantucket Memorial Airport.
Nantucket Airlines, or ACK Air as it is commonly referred to (ACK is the 3 letter identifier for Nantucket's Airport) utilizes a fleet of 6 Cessna 402C Businessliners/Utililiners (the Cape Air/Nantucket Airlines fleet consists of 60 Cessna 402Cs with 5 painted in the ACK Air livery and the remaining 55 painted in the Cape Air livery).  
Although the 5 ACK Air planes are generally used for the Hyannis-Nantucket route, it is not uncommon to see the planes used on other routes in the Cape Air New England region. Cape Air planes are also used on the Hyannis-Nantucket route during peak travel times.
