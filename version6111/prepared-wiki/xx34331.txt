Stefan Zweig ([tpl]IPA-de|tsvaɪk|lang[/tpl]; November 28, 1881 – February 22, 1942) was an Austrian novelist, playwright, journalist and biographer. At the height of his literary career, in the 1920s and 1930s, he was one of the most popular writers in the world."Stefan Zweig: The Secret Superstar" by Julie Kavanagh, Intelligent Life, (northern) spring 2009

==Biography==

Zweig was born in Vienna, the son of Moritz Zweig (1845–1926), a wealthy Jewish textile manufacturer, and Ida Brettauer (1854–1938), from a Jewish banking family.Prof.Dr. Klaus Lohrmann "Jüdisches Wien. Kultur-Karte" (2003), Mosse-Berlin Mitte gGmbH (Verlag Jüdische Presse) Joseph Brettauer did business for twenty years in Ancona, Italy, where his second daughter Ida was born and grew up, too.
Zweig was related to the Czech writer Egon Hostovský, who described Zweig as "a very distant relative";Egon Hostovský: Vzpomínky, studie a dokumenty o jeho díle a osudu, Sixty-Eight Publishers, 1974 some sources describe them as cousins.
Zweig studied philosophy at the University of Vienna and in 1904 earned a doctoral degree with a thesis on "The Philosophy of Hippolyte Taine". Religion did not play a central role in his education. "My mother and father were Jewish only through accident of birth", Zweig said later in an interview. Yet he did not renounce his Jewish faith and wrote repeatedly on Jews and Jewish themes, as in his story Buchmendel. Zweig had a warm relationship with Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, whom he met when Herzl was still literary editor of the Neue Freie Presse, then Vienna's main newspaper; Herzl accepted for publication some of Zweig's early essays. Zweig believed in internationalism and in europeanism; Herzl's Jewish nationalism could not therefore have had much attraction, as The World of Yesterday, his autobiography, makes clear. The Neue Freie Presse did not review Herzl's Der Judenstaat.[tpl]cite book|last=Elon|first=Amos|title=The Pity of it All|year=2002|publisher=Metropolitan Books|location=New York|page=287[/tpl] Zweig himself called Herzl's book an "obtuse text, a piece of nonsense".
At the beginning of World War I, patriotic sentiment was widespread, and extended to many German and Austrian Jews: Zweig, as well as Martin Buber and Hermann Cohen, all showed support.Elon, 320 Zweig, although patriotic, refused to pick up a rifle; instead, he served in the Archives of the Ministry of War, and soon acquired a pacifist stand like his friend Romain Rolland, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature 1915. Rolland soon moved to Switzerland until the end of the war. Zweig remained a pacifist all his life and advocated the unification of Europe. Like Rolland, he wrote many biographies. His Erasmus of Rotterdam he called a "concealed self-portrayal" in The World of Yesterday.
Zweig married Friderike Maria von Winternitz (born Burger) in 1920; they divorced in 1938. As Friderike Zweig she published a book on her former husband after his death.[tpl]cite book |title=Stefan Zweig – Wie ich ihn erlebte |first=Friderike |last=Zweig |authorlink= |publisher=F.A.

Zweig's secretary in Salzburg from November 1919 to March 1938 was Anna Meingast (13 May 1881, Vienna – 17 November 1953, Salzburg).[tpl]cite news|url=http://search.salzburg.com/display/SNA31658-20001215|title=Wichtiges zu Stefan Zweig: Das Salzburger Literaturarchiv erhielt eine bedeutende Schenkung von Wilhelm Meingast |author=Werner Thuswaldner|work=Salzburger Nachrichten|date=December 14, 2000|accessdate=March 15, 2014[/tpl]
In 1934, following Hitler's rise to power in Germany, Zweig left Austria. He lived in England (in London first, then from 1939 in Bath). Because of the swift advance of Hitler's troops westwards, Zweig and his second wife crossed the Atlantic Ocean and travelled to the United States, where they settled in 1940 in New York City, and traveled. On August 22, 1940, they moved again to Petrópolis, a town in the conurbation of Rio de Janeiro.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,4210755,00.html|title=Revivendo o país do futuro de Stefan Zweig|author=Júlia Dias Carneiro|publisher=Deutsche Welle |quote=|date=April 30, 2009|accessdate=February 23, 2012[/tpl] Feeling more and more depressed by the growth of intolerance, authoritarianism, and Nazism, and feeling hopeless for the future for humanity, Zweig wrote a note about his feelings of desperation. Then, in February 23, 1942, the Zweigs were found dead of a barbiturate overdose in their house in the city of Petrópolis, holding hands.[tpl]cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70815FA3A5F167B93C6AB1789D85F468485F9&scp=10&sq=Stefan%20Zweig&st=cse|title=Stefan Zweig, Wife End Lives In Brazil|author=|publisher=The United Press in The New York Times|quote=Stefan Zweig, Wife End Lives In Brazil; Austrian-Born Author Left a Note Saying He Lacked the Strength to Go on – Author and Wife Die in Compact: Zweig and Wife Commit Suicide|date=February 23, 1942|accessdate=February 23, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Died |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,773116,00.html |quote=Died. Stefan Zweig, 60, Austrian-born novelist, biographer, essayist (Amok, Adepts in Self-Portraiture, Marie Antoinette), and his wife, Elizabeth; by poison; in Petropolis, Brazil. Born into a wealthy Jewish family in Vienna, Zweig turned from casual globe-trotting to literature after World War I, wrote prolifically, smoothly, successfully in many forms. His books banned by the Nazis, he fled to Britain in 1938 with the arrival of German troops, became a British subject in 1940, moved to the U.S. the same year, to Brazil the next. He was never outspoken against Naziism, believed artists and writers should be independent of politics. Friends in Brazil said he left a suicide note explaining that he was old, a man without a country, too weary to begin a new life. His last book: Brazil: Land of the Future.|work=Time magazine |date= March 2, 1942|accessdate=2010-06-30 [/tpl] He had been despairing at the future of Europe and its culture. "I think it better to conclude in good time and in erect bearing a life in which intellectual labour meant the purest joy and personal freedom the highest good on Earth", he wrote.
The Zweigs' house in Brazil was later turned into a museum and is now known as Casa Stefan Zweig.

==Work==

Zweig was a prominent writer in the 1920s and 1930s, befriending Arthur Schnitzler and Sigmund Freud.[tpl]cite book|last=Fowles|first=John|title=Introduction to "The Royal Game"|year=1981|publisher=Obelisk|location=New York|pages=ix[/tpl] He was extremely popular in the United States, South America and Europe, and remains so in continental Europe; however, he was largely ignored by the British public,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2010/mar/26/stefan-zweig-michael-hofmann | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Stefan Zweig? Just a pedestrian stylist | first=Stuart | last=Walton | date=March 26, 2010[/tpl] and his fame in America has since dwindled. Since the 1990s there has been an effort on the part of several publishers (notably Pushkin Press and The New York Review of Books) to get Zweig back into print in English.[tpl]cite news|last=Lezard|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Lezard|title=The World of Yesterday by Stefan Zweig|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/dec/05/world-yesterday-stefan-zweig-review|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=26 September 2010 | location=London | date=December 5, 2009[/tpl] Plunkett Lake Press Ebooks has begun to publish electronic versions of his non-fiction as well.
Criticism over his oeuvre is severely divided between some English-speaking critics, who despise his literary style as poor, lightweight and superficial, and some of those more attached to the European tradition, who praise his humanism, simplicity and effective style.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kirjasto.sci.fi/szweig.htm |title=Stefan Zweig |website=Author's Calendar |last=Liukkonen |first=Petri |accessdate=2014-04-28[/tpl]
Zweig is best known for his novellas (notably The Royal Game, Amok, and Letter from an Unknown Woman – which was filmed in 1948 by Max Ophüls), novels (Beware of Pity, Confusion of Feelings, and the posthumously published The Post Office Girl) and biographies (notably Erasmus of Rotterdam, Conqueror of the Seas: The Story of Magellan, and Mary, Queen of Scotland and the Isles and also posthumously published, Balzac). At one time his works were published without his consent in English under the pseudonym "Stephen Branch" (a translation of his real name) when anti-German sentiment was running high. His biography of Queen Marie-Antoinette was later adapted as a Hollywood movie, starring the actress Norma Shearer in the title role.
Zweig's autobiography, The World of Yesterday, was completed in 1942 on the day before he committed suicide. It has been widely discussed as a record of "what it meant to be alive between 1881 and 1942" in central Europe; the book has attracted both critical praise and hostile dismissal.
Zweig enjoyed a close association with Richard Strauss, and provided the libretto for Die schweigsame Frau (The Silent Woman). Strauss famously defied the Nazi regime by refusing to sanction the removal of Zweig's name from the programme Richard Strauss/Stefan Zweig: BriefWechsel, 1957, translated as A Confidential Matter, 1977 for the work's première on June 24, 1935 in Dresden. As a result, Goebbels refused to attend as planned, and the opera was banned after three performances. Zweig later collaborated with Joseph Gregor, to provide Strauss with the libretto for one other opera, Daphne, in 1937.

During his stay in Brazil, Zweig wrote Brasilien, Ein Land der Zukunft (Brazil, Land of the Future) which was an accurate analysis of his newly adopted country and in his book he managed to demonstrate a fair understanding of the Brazilian culture that surrounded him.
Zweig was a passionate collector of manuscripts. There are important Zweig collections at the British Library and at the State University of New York at Fredonia. The British Library's Stefan Zweig Collection was donated to the library by his heirs in May 1986. It specialises in autograph music manuscripts, including works by Bach, Haydn, Wagner, and Mahler. It has been described as "one of the world's greatest collections of autograph manuscripts".The Zweig Music Collection at the British Library One particularly precious item is Mozart's "Verzeichnüß aller meiner Werke"Mozart's "Verzeichnüß aller meiner Werke" at the British Library Online Gallery accessed October 14, 2009 – that is, the composer's own handwritten thematic catalogue of his works.
The 1993–1994 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour.

==Adaptations==

Artist Jeff Gabel created an English-language adaptation of Vierundzwanzig Stunden aus dem Leben einer Frau in a large-scale comic book format in 2004, titled 24 Hours in the Life of a Woman.
Wes Anderson's 2014 film The Grand Budapest Hotel claims in its end-credits that it is partially inspired by Zweig's novels. Anderson unabashedly claimed to have "stolen" from Zweig's novels Beware of Pity and The Post-Office Girl in writing the film, and it features actors Tom Wilkinson as The Author, a character based loosely on Zweig, and Jude Law as his younger, idealised self seen in flashbacks. Anderson also claimed that the film's protagonist, the concierge Gustave H., played by Ralph Fiennes, is based on Zweig. In the film's opening sequence, a teenaged girl visits a shrine for The Author, which includes a bust of him wearing Zweig-like spectacles and celebrated as his country's "National Treasure".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10684250/I-stole-from-Stefan-Zweig-Wes-Anderson-on-the-author-who-inspired-his-latest-movie.html|title='I stole from Stefan Zweig': Wes Anderson on the author who inspired his latest movie|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2014-03-08[/tpl]
The 2013 French film A Promise ([tpl]Lang|fr|Une promesse[/tpl]) is based on Zweig's novella Journey into the Past ([tpl]Lang|de|Reise in die Vergangenheit[/tpl]).
