[[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)]]

CATEGORIES: Eastern Orthodox saints, Christian saints from the Old Testament

Zechariah [tpl]IPAc-en|z|ɛ|k|ə|ˈ|r|aɪ|.|ə[/tpl] ([tpl]Hebrew Name|זְכַרְיָה|Zekharya|Zəḵaryā[/tpl], "YHWH has remembered"; [tpl]lang-ar|زكريّا[/tpl] Zakariya or Zakkariya; [tpl]lang-el|Ζαχαρίας[/tpl] Zakharias; [tpl]lang-la|Zacharias[/tpl]) was a person in the Hebrew Bible and traditionally considered the author of the Book of Zechariah, the eleventh of the Twelve Minor Prophets. He was a prophet of the two-tribe Kingdom of Judah, and like Ezekiel was of priestly extraction. He describes himself ([tpl]Bibleverse||Zechariah|1:1|HE[/tpl]) as "the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo." In Ezra [tpl]Bibleverse-nb||Ezra|5:1|HE[/tpl] and [tpl]Bibleverse-nb||Ezra|6:14|HE[/tpl] he is called "the son of Iddo," who was properly his grandfather. His prophetical career began in the second year of Darius, king of Persia (B.C. 520), about sixteen years after the return of the first company from their Babylonian exile. He was contemporary with Haggai (Ezra 5:1).
Not much is known about Zechariah’s life other than what may be inferred from the book. It has been speculated that his ancestor Iddo was the head of a priestly family who returned with Zerubbabel ([tpl]bibleverse||Nehemiah|12:4|HE[/tpl]), and that Zechariah may himself have been a priest as well as a prophet. This is supported by Zechariah's interest in the Temple and the priesthood, and from Iddo's preaching in the Books of Chronicles.

==Possibility of martyrdom==

In the New Testament Gospel of Matthew,[tpl]Bibleref|Matthew|23:35[/tpl]: "that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous unto the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the sanctuary and the altar." ASV (Public Domain) Jesus is quoted as stating that Zechariah son of Barachiah was killed between the altar and the temple.  A similar quotation is also found in the Gospel of Luke.[tpl]Bibleref|Luke|11:51[/tpl]: "from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary: yea, I say unto you, it shall be required of this generation." ASV (Public Domain) 
Although there is an indication in Targum Lamentations that "Zechariah son of Iddo" was killed in the Temple,Targum on Lam 2:20: "Is it right to kill priest and prophet in the Temple of the Lord, as when you killed Zechariah son of Iddo, the High Priest and faithful prophet in the Temple of the Lord on the Day of Atonement because he told you not to do evil before the Lord?" Cited with permission from English translation by C.M.M. Brady at http://www.targum.info/meg/tglam.htm.  scholars generally understand this as a reference to the death of a much earlier figure, Zechariah ben Jehoiada.Brady, 1999, “Targum Lamentations’ Reading of the Book of Lamentations” (1MB pdf), page 116. As Abel was the first prophetic figure killed in the Hebrew Scriptures, and Zechariah ben Jehoiada was the last figure killed in those Scriptures, which conclude with 1 and 2 Chronicles, they represent the full historical scope of prophetic martyrdom. By using their names Jesus brings to bear on the Jewish establishment of his day the cumulative guilt for killing those prophets, to which within a few days they would add his own death. The logic of the accusation means that the reference is almost certainly to Zechariah ben Jehoiada.

==Bahá'í Faith==

Zechariah is mentioned in the Summons of the Lord of Hosts, a collection of the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, in the Súriy-i-Haykal.Comparison of the Suriy-i-Haykal and the Prophecies of Zechariah by Cynthia C. Shawamreh, written for the Wilmette Institute, December 1998

==Islam==

The Qur'an mentions only 25 prophets by name, including a different Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist. Muslims believe that many prophets were sent to mankind to spread the message of God, including many not mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, although this particular Zechariah is not mentioned by name in the Qur'an, some scholars, including Abdullah Yusuf AliThe Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary, Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Note 364: "Examples of the Prophets slain were: "the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar" (Matt. 23:35) and Muhammad Asad, have suggested that Qur'anic verses mentioning the martyrdom of prophets and righteous men are a reference to the slaying of, among others, Zechariah son of Berechiah.

==Liturgical commemoration==

On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, his feast day is February 8. He is commemorated with the other minor prophets in the calendar of saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on July 31.
