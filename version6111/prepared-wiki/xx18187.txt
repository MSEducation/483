Father's Day is a celebration honoring fathers and celebrating fatherhood, paternal bonds, and the influence of fathers in society. Many countries celebrate it on the third Sunday of June, but it is also celebrated widely on other days. Father's Day was created to complement Mother's Day, a celebration that honors mothers and motherhood.

==History==

Father's Day was inaugurated in the United States in the early 20th century to complement Mother's Day in celebrating fatherhood and male parenting.
After the success obtained by Anna Jarvis with the promotion of Mother's Day in the US, some[tpl]who|date=June 2013[/tpl] wanted to create similar holidays for other family members, and Father's Day was the choice most likely to succeed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] There were other persons in the US who independently thought of "Father's Day",Myers, 1972, p. 185Larossa, 1997. pp. 172-173 but the credit for the modern holiday is often given to Sonora Dodd, who was the driving force behind its establishment.
Father's Day was founded in Spokane, Washington at the YMCA in 1910 by Sonora Smart Dodd, who was born in Arkansas. Its first celebration was in the Spokane YMCA on June 19, 1910.[tpl]cite web| title = Father's Day (United States)| url = http://www3.kumc.edu/diversity/other/fathers.html | accessdate = 2008-05-30[/tpl] Her father, the Civil War veteran William Jackson Smart, was a single parent who raised his six children there. After hearing a sermon about Jarvis' Mother's Day in 1909, she told her pastor that fathers should have a similar holiday honoring them. Although she initially suggested June 5, her father's birthday, the pastors did not have enough time to prepare their sermons, and the celebration was deferred to the third Sunday of June.
It did not have much success initially. In the 1920s, Dodd stopped promoting the celebration because she was studying in the Art Institute of Chicago, and it faded into relative obscurity, even in Spokane.Schmidt, 1997. p. 278 In the 1930s Dodd returned to Spokane and started promoting the celebration again, raising awareness at a national level.Schmidt, 1997. p. 279 She had the help of those trade groups that would benefit most from the holiday, for example the manufacturers of ties, tobacco pipes, and any traditional present to fathers.Schmidt, 1997. pp. 275, 283–284, 286, 288, 290, 292 Since 1938 she had the help of the Father's Day Council, founded by the New York Associated Men's Wear Retailers to consolidate and systematize the commercial promotion.Schmidt, 1997. p. 275,288-290 Americans resisted the holiday during a few decades, perceiving it as just an attempt by merchants to replicate the commercial success of Mother's Day, and newspapers frequently featured cynical and sarcastic attacks and jokes.Schmidt, 1997. pp. 280–283; Larossa, 1997. p. 174 But the trade groups did not give up: they kept promoting it and even incorporated the jokes into their adverts, and they eventually succeeded.Schmidt, 1997. p. 283–290 By the mid-1980s the Father's Council wrote that "(...) Day has become a Second Christmas for all the men's gift-oriented industries."Schmidt, 1997. p. 286
A bill to accord national recognition of the holiday was introduced in Congress in 1913. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson went to Spokane to speak in a Father's Day celebrationMyers, 1972. pp. 186-187 and wanted to make it official, but Congress resisted, fearing that it would become commercialized.[tpl]citation |title= Father's Day – The un-Spokane history of Father's Day |date= June 13, 2007 |work=Daily American |url= http://www.dailyamerican.com/articles/2007/06/13/national_news/n_news794.txt [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl] US President Calvin Coolidge recommended in 1924 that the day be observed by the nation, but stopped short of issuing a national proclamation. Two earlier attempts to formally recognize the holiday had been defeated by Congress.[tpl]citation |title= Father Finally Granted A Day |work=Nashua Telegraph, part of The Telegraph |date= June 18, 1977 |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&dat=19770618&id=c6orAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Mv0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=6971,3560760 [/tpl] In 1957, Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith wrote a proposal accusing Congress of ignoring fathers for 40 years while honoring mothers, thus "singling out just one of our two parents". In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued the first presidential proclamation honoring fathers, designating the third Sunday in June as Father's Day. Six years later, the day was made a permanent national holiday when President Richard Nixon signed it into law in 1972.Schmidt, 1997. pp. 275-276
In addition to Father's Day, International Men's Day is celebrated in many countries on November 19 for men and boys who are not fathers.

A "Father's Day" service was held on July 5, 1908, in Fairmont, West Virginia, in the Williams Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church South, now known as Central United Methodist Church. Grace Golden Clayton was mourning the loss of her father when, on December 1907, the Monongah Mining Disaster in nearby Monongah killed 361 men, 250 of them fathers, leaving around a thousand fatherless children. Clayton suggested her pastor Robert Thomas Webb to honor all those fathers.[tpl]Cite news| last = Smith | first = Vicki | title = The first Father's Day | publisher=The Journal | date = June 15, 2003 | url = http://www.wvculture.org/HiStory/miscellaneous/fathersday02.html | accessdate=2006-11-07[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| last = Barth | first = Kelly | title = First Father's Day service in 1908 | publisher=Dominion Post (Morgantown, West Virginia) | date =June 21, 1987 | url = http://www.wvculture.org/HiStory/miscellaneous/fathersday01.html | accessdate=2006-11-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.creedholden.com/sites/fathersday/index_02.htm |title=The First Father's Day Service occurred in Fairmont, West Virginia, on July 5, 1908, at Williams Memorial Methodist Espiscopal Church |author=Reverend D.D. Meighen |date=June 5, 1908 |accessdate=2010-09-04[/tpl] Clayton chose the Sunday nearest to the birthday of her father, Methodist minister Fletcher Golden.
Clayton's event did not have repercussions outside of Fairmont for several reasons, among them: the city was overwhelmed by other events, the celebration was never promoted outside of the town itself and no proclamation was made in the City Council. Also two events overshadowed this event: the celebration of Independence Day July 4, 1908, with 12,000 attendants and several shows including a hot air balloon event, which took over the headlines in the following days, and the death of a 16-year-old girl on July 4. The local church and Council were overwhelmed and they did not even think of promoting the event, and it was not celebrated again for many years. The original sermon was not reproduced in press and it was lost. Finally, Clayton was a quiet person, who never promoted the event or even talked to other persons about it.
Clayton also may have been inspired by Anna Jarvis' crusade to establish Mother's Day; two months prior, Jarvis had held a celebration for her dead mother in Grafton, West Virginia, a town about 15 miles (24 km) away from Fairmont.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
In 1911, Jane Addams proposed a city-wide Father's Day in Chicago, but she was turned down.
In 1912, there was a Father's Day celebration in Vancouver, Washington, suggested by Methodist pastor J. J. Berringer of the Irvingtom Methodist Church. They believed mistakenly that they had been the first to celebrate such a day. They followed a 1911 suggestion by the Portland Oregonian.
Harry C. Meek, member of Lions Clubs International, claimed that he had first the idea for Father's Day in 1915. Meek claimed that the third Sunday of June was chosen because it was his birthday (it would have been more natural to choose his father's birthday). The Lions Club has named him "Originator of Father's Day". Meek made many efforts to promote Father's Day and make it an official holiday.

In the United States, Dodd used the "Fathers' Day" spelling on her original petition for the holiday,Schmidt, 1997, p. 276. but the spelling "Father's Day" was already used in 1913 when a bill was introduced to the U.S. Congress as the first attempt to establish the holiday,[tpl]Cite news| title = Father to have his day | work=The New York Times | date = October 3, 1913 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A0DE1DF133FE633A25750C0A9669D946296D6CF | quote = (...) a bill providing that "The first Sunday in June in each and every year hereafter be designated as Father's Day (...)"

In 1953 the proposal to celebrate Father's Day in all educational establishments on August 24, in honor of José de San Martín, was raised to the General Direction of Schools of Mendoza Province. The day was celebrated for the first time in 1958, on the third Sunday of June, but it was not included in the school calendars due to pressure from several groups.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.diadelpadre.org/docs/1798.htm | title = Sesiones ordinarias 2004 Orden del día n°1798: Día del Padre.

Schools in the Mendoza Province continued to celebrate Father's Day on August 24, and, in 1982, the Provincial Governor passed a law declaring Father's Day in the province to be celebrated on that day.
In 2004, several proposals to change the date to August 24 were presented to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies as a single, unified project. After being approved, the project was passed to the Senate of Argentina for final review and approval. The Senate changed the proposed new date to the third Sunday of August, and scheduled the project for approval. However, the project was never addressed during the Senate's planned session, which caused its ultimate failure.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.diadelpadre.org/body.htm | title = Día del Padre (Estado del trámite del proyecto de ley) | accessdate = 2008-07-12 [/tpl]

Regionally, it is also called men's day, Männertag, or gentlemen's day, Herrentag. It is tradition for groups of males (young and old but usually excluding pre-teenage boys) to do a hiking tour with one or more smaller wagons, Bollerwagen, pulled by manpower. In the wagons are wine or beer (according to region) and traditional regional food, Hausmannskost. Many men use this holiday as an opportunity to get drunk. According to the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, alcohol-related traffic accidents multiply by three on this day.[tpl]citation |title= Der Tag der gefragten Väter |date= June 9, 2013 |language= German |work= Tiroler Tageszeitung |url= http://www.tt.com/Tirol/6673231-2/der-tag-der-gefragten-väter.csp |quote= Bei unseren deutschen Nachbarn ist der Vatertag – der dort zu Christi Himmelfahrt gefeiert wird – nicht von Ausflügen mit der Familie oder kleinen Geschenken der Kinder gekennzeichnet, sondern von einer Lokaltour in feucht-fröhlicher Männerrunde.

These traditions are probably rooted in Christian Ascension Day's processions to the farmlands, which has been celebrated since the 18th century.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/booze-brothers-father-s-day-debauchery-in-deutschland-a-414461.html|title=Booze Brothers: Father's Day Debauchery in Deutschland|publisher=Spiegel|date= May 4, 2006 |accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.stern.de/panorama/vatertag-an-christi-himmelfahrt-von-modischen-herrenpartien-und-der-erhoehung-jesu-1565801.html|title= Von modischen Herrenpartien und der Erhöhung Jesu |date=May 12, 2010|publisher=Der Stern|language=German|accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl] Men would be seated in a wooden cart and carried to the village's plaza, and the mayor would award a prize to the father who had the most children, usually a big piece of ham. In the late 19th century the religious component was progressively lost, especially in urban areas such as Berlin, and groups of men organized walking excursions with beer and ham. By the 20th century it had evolved into a holiday for getting drunk. Most German fathers control their alcohol intake and simply take relaxed walks with friends, but the minority of people who get very drunk are very noisy and troublesome, and they give a bad name to the holiday. Many modern fathers opt to spend the day with their families instead and refrain from getting drunk. Many people will take the following Friday off at work, and some schools are closed on that Friday as well; many people then use the resulting four-day long weekend for a short vacation.

In Thailand, Father's Day is set as the birthday of the king. December 5 is the birthday of the current king, Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX). Traditionally, Thais celebrate by giving their father or grandfather a Canna flower (ดอกพุทธรักษา Dok Buddha Ruksa), which is considered a masculine flower; however, this is not as commonly practiced today. Thai people will wear yellow on this day to show respect for the king, because yellow is the Color of the day for Monday, the day King Bhumibol Adulyadej was born. Thais flood the Sanam Luang, a massive park in front of the palace, to watch the king give his annual speech, and often stay until the evening, when there is a national ceremony. Thais will light candles and show respect to the king by declaring their faith. This ceremony happens in almost every village in Thailand, and even overseas at Thai organizations.
It first gained nationwide popularity in the 1980s as part of a campaign by Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda to promote Thailand's royal family.
