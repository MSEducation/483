==Track listing==

All songs written by Jimmy Eat World except Track 5 written by The Wedding Present. The band also intended to include their cover of Duran Duran's song "New Religion," which originally appeared on a tribute album, but were denied permission by the record label that originally released it. Jim Adkins' original liner notes refer to the song "Better Than Oh" (from the Jimmy Eat World / Emery split 7"), but it is not included on the U.S. release.
