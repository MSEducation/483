===[tpl]anchor|colony[/tpl]Colony of Newfoundland===

In 1583 Newfoundland became England's first possession in North America and one of the earliest permanent English colonies in the New World[tpl]cite book |title=Sir Francis Drake |last=Sugden |first=John |year=1990 |publisher=Barrie & Jenkins |location= |isbn=0-7126-2038-9 |page=118 [/tpl] when it was claimed by Sir Humphrey Gilbert for Queen Elizabeth. Though English fishing boats had visited Newfoundland continuously since Cabot's second voyage in 1498 and seasonal fishing camps had existed for a century prior, similar was true of Basque, French, and Portuguese ships and camps, thus pressure to secure the island from foreign control led to the appointment of Proprietary Governors to establish colonial settlements on the island from 1610 to 1728. John Guy was governor of the first settlement at Cuper's Cove. Other settlements were Bristol's Hope, Renews, New Cambriol, South Falkland and Avalon which became a province in 1623. The first governor given jurisdiction over all of Newfoundland was Sir David Kirke in 1638.
Explorers soon realized that the waters around Newfoundland had the best fishing in the North Atlantic.Grant C. Head, Eighteenth Century Newfoundland: A Geographer’s Perspective (1976) By 1620, 300 fishing boats worked the Grand Bank, employing some 10,000 sailors; many continuing to come from Basque Country, Normandy, or Brittany. They dried and salted the cod on the coast and sold it to Spain and Portugal. Heavy investment by Sir George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, in the 1620s in wharves, warehouses, and fishing stations failed to pay off. French raids hurt the business, and the weather was terrible, so he redirected his attention to his other colony in Maryland.See Allan M. Fraser, "Calvert, Sir George" Dictionary of Canadian Biography online After Calvert left, small-scale entrepreneurs such as Sir David Kirke made good use of the facilities. Kirke became the first governor in 1639.John S. Moir, "Kirke, Sir David," Dictionary of Canadian Biography online  A triangular trade with New England, the West Indies, and Europe gave Newfoundland an important economic role.  By the 1670s there were 1700 permanent residents and another 4500 in the summer months.Gordon W. Handcock, "So Longe as There Comes Noe Women": Origins of English Settlement in Newfoundland (1989)
Basque fishermen, who had been fishing cod shoals off Newfoundland's coasts since the beginning of the sixteenth century, founded Plaisance (today Placentia), a haven which started to be also used by French fishermen. In 1655, France appointed a governor in Plaisance, thus starting a formal French colonization period of Newfoundland[tpl]cite web|url=http://collections.mun.ca/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/hist_trust&CISOPTR=242&CISOSHOW=123&REC=5|title=History of Placentia|publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland|accessdate=February 26, 2010[/tpl] as well as a period of periodic war and unrest between England and France. The Mi'kmaq, as allies with the French, were amenable to limited French settlement in their midst and fought with them against the English. English attacks on Placentia provoked retaliation by New France explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville who during King William's War in the 1690s destroyed nearly every English settlement on the island. The entire population of the English colony was either killed, captured for ransom, or sentenced to expulsion to England, with the exception of the those who withstood the attack at Carbonear Island and those in the then remote Bonavista. After France lost political control of the area after the Siege of Port Royal in 1710, the Mí'kmaq engaged in warfare with the British throughout Dummer's War, King George's War, Father Le Loutre's War and the French and Indian War. The French colonization period lasted until the Treaty of Utrecht, in 1713, which ended the War of the Spanish Succession and France ceded its claims to Newfoundland to the British (as well as its claims to the shores of Hudson Bay) and to the French possessions in Acadia. Afterward, under the supervision of the last French governor, the French population of Plaisance moved to Île Royale (now Cape Breton Island), part of Acadia which remained then under French control.
In the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), France had acknowledged British ownership of the island. However, in the Seven Years' War (1756–63), control of Newfoundland once again became a major source of conflict between Britain, France and Spain who all pressed for a share in the valuable fishery there. Britain's victories around the globe led William Pitt to insist that nobody other than Britain should have access to Newfoundland. The Battle of Signal Hill was fought in Newfoundland in 1762, when a French force landed and tried to occupy the island, only to be repulsed by the British.
From 1763 to 1767 James Cook made a detailed survey of the coasts of Newfoundland and southern Labrador, while he was commander of the HMS Grenville. The following year, 1768, Cook began is his first circumnavigation of the world. In 1796 a Franco-Spanish expedition again succeeded in raiding the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador destroying many of the settlements.
By the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), French fishermen were given the right to land and cure fish on the "French Shore" on the western coast. They had a permanent base on nearby St. Pierre and Miquelon islands; the French gave up their rights in 1904. In 1783, the British signed the Treaty of Paris with the United States that gave American fishermen similar rights along the coast. These rights were reaffirmed by treaties in 1818, 1854 and 1871 and confirmed by arbitration in 1910.
In 1854 the British government established Newfoundland's responsible government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/representative.html |title=Representative Government, 1832–1855|last=Webb |first=Jeff |accessdate=October 17, 2008[/tpl] In 1855, Philip Francis Little, a native of Prince Edward Island, won a parliamentary majority over Sir Hugh Hoyles and the Conservatives. Little formed the first administration from 1855 to 1858.  Newfoundland rejected confederation with Canada in the 1869 general election. Prime Minister of Canada Sir John Thompson came very close to negotiating Newfoundland's entry into Confederation in 1892.

===Dominion of Newfoundland===

Newfoundland remained a colony until acquiring Dominion status in 1907.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mapleleafweb.com/old/features/constitution/federalism/newfoundland-labrador/nfld-history.html|publisher= Mapleleafweb |title=Newfoundland & Labrador and Canadian Federalism – History of Newfoundland & Labrador|accessdate=February 5, 2011[/tpl] A dominion constituted a self-governing state of the British Empire or British Commonwealth and the Dominion of Newfoundland was relatively autonomous from British rule.
Newfoundland's own regiment, the 1st Newfoundland Regiment, fought in the First World War. On July 1, 1916, the German Army wiped out nearly the entire regiment at Beaumont Hamel on the first day on the Somme.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=Zoktc9xBDvwC&lpg=PP1&dq=.%20History%20of%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador%E2%80%8E&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true|title=Newfoundland and Labrador: a history|first=Sean Thomas |last=Cadigan|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8020-4465-5|page=[/tpl] The regiment went on to serve with distinction in several subsequent battles, earning the prefix "Royal". Despite people's pride in the accomplishments of the regiment, the Dominion's war debt due to the regiment and the cost of maintaining a trans-island railway led to increased and ultimately unsustainable government debt in the post-war era.
It was during this period of dominion status that the Labrador mainland and the island of Newfoundland merged into a single political entity. Since the early 1800s, Newfoundland and Quebec (or Lower Canada) had been in a border dispute over the Labrador region. In 1927, however, the British government ruled that the area known as modern day Labrador was to be considered part of the Dominion of Newfoundland.

===Commission of Government and confederation with Canada===

Due to Newfoundland's high debt load, arising from World War I and construction of the Newfoundland railroad, and decreasing revenue, due to the collapse of fish prices, the Newfoundland legislature voted itself out of existence in 1933,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/collapse_responsible_gov.html|title=Collapse of Responsible Government, 1929–1934|publisher=Heritage Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=February 5, 2011[/tpl] in exchange for loan guarantees by the Crown and a promise it would be re-established.[tpl]cite book |last=Malone |first=Greg |authorlink= |title=Don't Tell the Newfoundlanders: The True Story of Newfoundland's Confederation with Canada |url= |accessdate= |year=2012 |publisher=Alfred A Knopf Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-307-40133-5 |pages=8–10[/tpl] On February 16, 1934, the Commission of Government was sworn in, ending 79 years of responsible government. The Commission consisted of seven persons appointed by the British government. For 15 years no elections took place, and no legislature was convened.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/commission_gov.html|title=The Commission of Government, 1934–1949|publisher=Heritage Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=February 6, 2011[/tpl]
When prosperity returned with World War II, agitation began to end the Commission, and reinstate responsible government.Gene Long, Suspended State: Newfoundland Before Canada (1999) But, the British government created the National Convention in 1946, reflecting efforts in self-determination among European nationalities that followed WWII. The Convention was formally tasked to advise on the future of Newfoundland. Chaired by Judge Cyril J. Fox, it consisted of 45 elected members from across the province.
Several motions were made by Joey Smallwood (a member of the convention who later was elected as the first premier of Newfoundland[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/national.html |title=The Newfoundland National Convention |publisher=Heritage.nf.ca |accessdate=December 3, 2010[/tpl]) to examine joining Canada by sending a delegation to Ottawa. The first motion was defeated, although the Convention later decided to send delegations to both London and Ottawa to explore alternatives.Joseph Roberts Smallwood, I chose Canada: The Memoirs of the Honourable Joseph R. "Joey" Smallwood (1973) p. 256Richard Gwyn, Smallwood: The Unlikely Revolutionary (1972) In January 1948, the National Convention voted against putting Confederation onto the referendum 29 to 16; but, this vote was overruled by the British, which controlled the National Convention and the subsequent referendum.[tpl]cite book |last=Malone |first=Greg |authorlink= |title=Don't Tell the Newfoundlanders: The True Story of Newfoundland's Confederation with Canada |url= |accessdate= |year=2012 |publisher=Alfred A Knopf Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-307-40133-5 |page=145[/tpl]
Three main factions actively campaigned during the leadup to the referendums. Smallwood led the Confederate Association (CA), advocating union with the Canadian Confederation. They campaigned through a newspaper known as The Confederate. The Responsible Government League (RGL), led by Peter Cashin, advocated an independent Newfoundland with a return to responsible government. Their newspaper was The Independent. A third, smaller Economic Union Party (EUP), led by Chesley Crosbie, advocated closer economic ties with the United States. The EUP failed to gain much attention, and merged with the RGL after the first referendum."The 1948 Referendums", Library and Archives Canada
The first referendum took place on June 3, 1948; 44.5% of people voted for responsible government, 41.1% voted for confederation with Canada, while 14.3% voted for Commission of Government. Since none of the choices had gained over 50%, a second referendum with only the two more popular choices was held on July 22, 1948. The official outcome of that referendum was 52.3% for confederation with Canada and 47.7% for responsible (independent) government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.marianopolis.edu/nfldhistory/NewfoundlandJoinsCanada-Confederation1949.htm |title=Newfoundland Joins Canada) and Newfoundland and Confederation (1949) |publisher=.marianopolis.edu |accessdate=December 3, 2010[/tpl]
After the referendum, a seven-man delegation was picked by the British governor to effectively rubber stamp Canada's offer on behalf of Newfoundland. After six of the seven-man delegation signed, the British Government passed the British North America Act, 1949 through Parliament. Newfoundland officially joined Canada at midnight, March 31, 1949.
Following the declassification of secret Canadian and British government communications and internal government reports of the years prior to the referendum, historians have established that the British government (which effectively was also the Newfoundland government) had conspired with the Canadian government to manoeuvre Newfoundland into Confederation, in exchange for forgiveness of Britain's war debt.[tpl]cite book |last=Malone |first=Greg |authorlink= |title=Don't Tell the Newfoundlanders: The True Story of Newfoundland's Confederation with Canada |url= |accessdate= |year=2012 |publisher=Alfred A Knopf Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-307-40133-5 |pages=68–75[/tpl]
Subsequent to the referendum, there has been hearsay that the referendum was narrowly won by the responsible government side, but the result was fixed by the British governor.[tpl]cite book |last=Malone |first=Greg |authorlink= |title=Don't tell the Newfoundlanders: the true story of Newfoundland's confederation with Canada |url= |accessdate= |year=2012 |publisher=Alfred A Knopf Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-307-40133-5 |pages=225–26[/tpl] The governor ordered the ballots from the referendum to be burned shortly afterward.

==Provincial flag==

Newfoundland and Labrador's present provincial flag, designed by Newfoundland artist Christopher Pratt, was officially adopted by the legislature on May 28, 1980 and first flown on "Discovery Day" that year. Labrador has its own unofficial flag, created in 1973 by Mike Martin, former Member of the Legislative Assembly for Labrador South.
The blue is meant to represent the sea, the white represents snow and ice, the red represents the efforts and struggles of the people, and the gold represents the confidence of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. The blue triangles are a tribute to the Union Flag, and represent the British heritage of the province. The two red triangles represent Labrador (the mainland portion of the province) and the island. In Pratt's words, the gold arrow points towards a "brighter future".[tpl]cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/nfldhistory/NewfoundlandFlag.html|title=The Newfoundland Flag|accessdate=June 25, 2010[/tpl]
The "Pink, White and Green" is a flag of 19th-century origins that enjoyed popularity in portions of the island in the late 19th century. It was flown on some vessels into the 20th century. It was never adopted by the Newfoundland government.
A 1976 article reported that the tricolour flag was created in 1843 by then Roman Catholic Bishop of Newfoundland, Michael Anthony Fleming.The Monitor, July 1976, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newfoundland The colours were intended to represent the symbolic union of Newfoundland's historically dominant ethnic/religious groups: English, Scottish and Irish. Though popular, there is no historical evidence to support this legend.
Recent scholarship  suggests that the flag was first used in the 1870s or later by the Roman Catholic "Star of the Sea" fishermen's association. It resembled the unofficial flag of Ireland. The tri-colour flag remained relatively unknown outside of St. John's and the Avalon peninsula until the growth of the tourist industry since the late 20th century. It has been used as an emblem on items in gift shops in St. John's and other towns. Some tourists assume it is the Irish flag.
The "Pink, White and Green" has been adopted by some residents as a symbol of ties with Irish heritage and as a political statement. Many of the province's Protestants, who make up approximately 60% of the province's total population (with 57% claiming British Isles descent),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/demo30a-eng.htm?sdi=religion|title=Statistics Canada: Population by religion, by province and territory (2001 Census)|accessdate=June 22, 2010[/tpl] consider it a Catholic flag.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
Similarly, many of the province's Catholics, approximately 37% of the total population (with roughly 22% of the population claiming Irish ancestry),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/demo26b-eng.htm|title=2006 Statistics Canada National Census: Newfoundland and Labrador|publisher=Statistics Canada|date=July 28, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/highlight/Religion/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo=PR&View=1a&Code=10&Table=1&StartRec=1&Sort=2&B1=10&B2=All%20Religions%20in%20Canada|title=Religions in Canada: Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=June 22, 2010[/tpl] think that the current provincial flag does not satisfactorily represent them.Carolyn Lambert, "Emblem of our Country", Newfoundland and Labrador Studies, Volume 23, Number 1, 2008. But, a government-sponsored poll in 2005 revealed that 75% of Newfoundlanders rejected adoption of the Tricolour flag as the province's official flag.Mark Quinn, "Push for old Newfoundland flag fails to cause ripple, poll finds", Globe and Mail, October 29, 2005, A16

The fishing industry remains an important part of the provincial economy, employing roughly 20,000 and contributing over $440 million to the GDP. The combined harvest of fish such as cod, haddock, halibut, herring and mackerel was 150,000 tonnes (165,000 tons) valued at about $130 million in 2006. Shellfish, such as crab, shrimp and clams, accounted for 195,000 tonnes (215,000 tons) with a value of $316 million in the same year. The value of products from the seal hunt was $55 million. Aquaculture is a new industry for the province, which in 2006 produced over 10,000 tonnes of Atlantic salmon, mussels and steelhead trout worth over $50 million.
Newsprint is produced by one paper mill in Corner Brook with a capacity of 420,000 tonnes (462,000 tons) per year. The value of newsprint exports varies greatly from year to year, depending on the global market price. Lumber is produced by numerous mills in Newfoundland.
Apart from seafood processing, paper manufacture and oil refining,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nlrefining.com/|title=Project Review |publisher=Newfoundland and Labrador Refining Corporation|accessdate=June 17, 2008[/tpl] manufacturing in the province consists of smaller industries producing food,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.purity.nf.ca/|title=Purity Factories (Newfoundland food)|accessdate=October 26, 2007[/tpl] brewing and other beverage production, and footwear.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.terrafootwear.com/about.php|title=Terra Footwear – About|accessdate=May 31, 2010[/tpl]
Agriculture in Newfoundland is limited to areas south of St. John's, near Deer Lake and in the Codroy Valley. Potatoes, rutabagas, turnips, carrots and cabbage are grown for local consumption. Poultry and eggs are also produced. Wild blueberries, partridgeberries (lingonberries) and bakeapples (cloudberries) are harvested commercially and used in jams and wine making.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rodrigueswinery.com/ | title=Rodriques Winery | accessdate=October 26, 2007[/tpl] Dairy production is another huge part of the Newfoundland Agriculture Industry.
Tourism is also a significant contributor to the province's economy. In 2006 nearly 500,000 non-resident tourists visited Newfoundland and Labrador, spending an estimated $366 million. Tourism is most popular throughout the months of June–September, the warmest months of the year with the longest hours of daylight.

==Government and politics==

Newfoundland and Labrador is governed by a parliamentary government within the construct of constitutional monarchy; the monarchy in Newfoundland and Labrador is the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.[tpl]Cite journal| author=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=Canadian Heritage Portfolio| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| date=February 2009| edition=2nd| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pc-ch/publctn/gp-pg/ppc-chp/ppc-chp-eng.pdf| pages=3–4| isbn=978-1-100-11529-0| accessdate=May 23, 2011[/tpl] The sovereign is Queen Elizabeth II, who also serves as head of state of 15 other Commonwealth countries, each of Canada's nine other provinces, and the Canadian federal realm, and resides predominantly in the United Kingdom. As such, the Queen's representative, the Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador (presently Frank Fagan), carries out most of the royal duties in Newfoundland and Labrador.[tpl]cite web| last=Office of the Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador| title=Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador > Role and Duties| url=http://www.govhouse.nl.ca/lieutenantgovernor/role.html| publisher=Queen's Printer for Newfoundland and Labrador| accessdate=September 13, 2012[/tpl]
The direct participation of the royal and viceroyal figures in any of these areas of governance is limited; in practice, their use of the executive powers is directed by the Executive Council, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the unicameral, elected House of Assembly and chosen and headed by the Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador (presently Tom Marshall), the head of government.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/12/03/nl-dunderdale-premier-sworn-in-123.html| title=Dunderdale becomes 1st woman to lead N.L.| date=December 3, 2010| publisher=CBC| accessdate=January 19, 2011[/tpl] To ensure the stability of government, the lieutenant governor will usually appoint as premier the person who is usually the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Assembly. The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition (presently Dwight Ball) and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.[tpl]cite web| last=Library of Parliament| title=The Opposition in a Parliamentary System| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/researchpublications/bp47-e.htm| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=May 23, 2011[/tpl]
Each of the 48 Members of the House of Assembly (MHA) is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district. General elections must be called by the lieutenant governor on the second Tuesday in October four years after the previous election, or may be called, on the advice of the premier, should the government lose a confidence vote in the legislature.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.assembly.nl.ca/business/bills/Bill0440.htm| title=An Act To Amend The House of Assembly Act and the Elections Act, 1991| date=December 13, 2004| publisher=Queen's Printer for Newfoundland and Labrador| accessdate=January 20, 2011[/tpl] Traditionally, politics in the province have been dominated by both the Liberal Party and the Progressive Conservative Party. However, in the 2011 provincial election the New Democratic Party, which had only ever attained minor success, had a major breakthrough and placed second in the popular vote behind the Progressive Conservatives.[tpl]cite news|last=Moore|first=Oliver|title=‘Orange wave’ credited with slimming Tory majority in Newfoundland|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/provincial-elections/orange-wave-credited-with-slimming-tory-majority-in-newfoundland/article2198237/|accessdate=December 21, 2011|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=October 12, 2011[/tpl]

==Culture==

===Music===

Newfoundland and Labrador has a folk musical heritage based on the Irish, English and Scottish traditions that were brought to its shores centuries ago. Though similar in its Celtic influence to neighbouring Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador are more Irish than Scottish, and have more elements imported from English and French music than those provinces. Much of the region's music focuses on the strong seafaring tradition in the area, and includes sea shanties and other sailing songs. Some modern traditional musicians include Great Big Sea, The Ennis Sisters, Shanneyganock, Sharecroppers, Ron Hynes,  and The Navigators.

===Sports===

Newfoundland and Labrador has a somewhat different sports culture than the rest of Canada, owing in part to its long history separate from the rest of Canada and under British rule. Ice hockey, however, remains popular; the St. John's IceCaps play professionally at the Mile One Centre in St. John's, and the Newfoundland Senior Hockey League has teams around the island. Since the departure of the St. John's Fog Devils in 2008, Newfoundland and Labrador is the only province in Canada to not have a team in the Canadian Hockey League (should one ever join it would be placed in the QMJHL, which hosted the Fog Devils and has jurisdiction over Atlantic Canada).
Association football (soccer) and rugby union are both more popular in Newfoundland and Labrador than the rest of Canada in general. Soccer is hosted at King George V Park, a 10,000-seat stadium built as Newfoundland's national stadium during the time as an independent dominion. Swilers Rugby Park hosts the Swilers RFC in rugby union. Other sports facilities in Newfoundland and Labrador include Pepsi Centre, an indoor arena in Corner Brook; Shamrock Field, Canada's national Gaelic Games venue in St. John's; and St. Patrick's Park, a baseball park in St. John's.
Gridiron football, be it either American or Canadian, is practically nonexistent; it is the only Canadian province other than Prince Edward Island to have never hosted a Canadian Football League or Canadian Interuniversity Sport game; unlike Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador also lacks an amateur team.

==Transportation==

Within the province, the Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Transportation and Works operates or sponsors 15 automobile, passenger, and freight ferry routes which connect various communities along the province's significant coastline.[tpl]cite web|title=Summary of Services Available|url=http://www.tw.gov.nl.ca/ferryservices/schedules/highlights.html|publisher=Department of Transportation and Works|accessdate=February 20, 2013[/tpl]
