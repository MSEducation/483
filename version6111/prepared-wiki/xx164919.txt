Aparajita was Shilahara  ruler of north Konkan branch from 975 CE – 1010 CE.
Chhadvaideva was followed by his nephew Aparajita, the son of Vajjada. Aparajita was an ambitious king. He sought to extend his sphere of influence by alliance with the mighty kings of other countries. He probably represents the Vidyadhara king Shikhandaketu, mentioned in the Navasahasankacharita of Padmagupta, who sent his son Shashikhanda to render help to the Paramara king Sindhuraja (993 CE 1010 CE) in his invasion of South Kosala at the request of the Naga king of Bastar. Aparajita's extensive conquests, his alliance with the Paramaras, his assumption of grandiloquent titles and his refusal to recognise the suzerainty of the Later Chalukya s exasperated Satyashraya, the son of Tailapa. He invaded the kingdom of Aparajita and pressed as far as the capital Puri.(Dept. Gazetteer: 2002)
