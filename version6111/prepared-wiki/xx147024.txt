==Playing career==

===Club===

Meyler played his club hurling and football with the Our Lady's Island club in Wexford.  When he moved to Cork in 1982 he joined the famous St. Finbarr's club on the south side of the city.  He had much success with ‘the Barrs’, winning a grand total of eight county championship medals in both hurling and football.  The highlight of his career with St. Finbarr's came in 1987 when he was captain of the club's football team.  Although losing the county final to Imokilly, Meyler's side represented Cork in the provincial club championship.  A 2-15 to 1-5 trouncing of Kilrossanty of Waterford in the final gave Meyler a Munster club title.  The subsequent All-Ireland final saw 'the Barr's' take on Roscommon's Clann na nGael.  In atrocious conditions the Cork side won the game by 0-10 to 0-7 and Meyler had the honour of accepring the cup and collecting a coveted All-Ireland club football medal.[tpl]cite book| first=Eoghan| last=Corry| title=The GAA Book of Lists| publisher=Hodder Headline Ireland| year=2005| id= | page=421[/tpl]

===Inter-county===

In 1973 Meyler began his inter-county career with the Wexford minor hurling team.  He later played on the county’s under-21 side but had little success at either level.  Meyler also played both hurling and football with the Wexford senior teams in the later 1970s and early 1980s but had little success.  In 1983 he joined the Cork senior hurling team but remained on the subs bench for much of his tenure on Leeside.  He won an All-Ireland medal with the county in 1986, when he was a substitute in the final against Galway.  He retired from inter-county hurling in 1987.

==Early coaching career==

===Kerry===

In retirement from playing Meyler has maintained a keen interest in the game.  He first tried his hand at management when he took charge of the Kerry senior hurling team in 1992, in a county dominated by Gaelic football.Hurling: The Revolution Years p. 106 In his first few months in charge Kerry surprisingly reached the quarter-final stages of the National Hurling League.  A nine-point defeat by Tipperary was Kerry’s lot on that occasion, however, Tipp were made to work for the win.Hurling: The Revolution Years p. 110  The first round of the 1993 Munster championship pitted Kerry against Waterford.  While many people gave Kerry little chance Meyler’s side won the game by 4-13 to 3-12.Hurling: The Revolution Years p. 111  It was Kerry’s first championship victory in sixty-seven years.  The run of success came to an end in the next game as Tipp won by 4-21 to 2-9.  Meyler remained as manager of the Kerry senior hurlers until 1997; however the team failed to capture another significant victory in the championship. In his time in charge he brought Kerry to Div 1 of the National League.
In 2009 he made a return to Kerry to manage the Under 21 team for the All-Ireland B Championship, which they won with a win over Roscommon in the final.
He was back in charge of the senior team in 2010 and won the Div 3A league title after beating Derry in the final. He later led Kerry to a first Christy Ring Cup final but lost out by a point to Westmeath in Croke Park. He was also in charge of the Under 21 team for a second year as they retained their All-Ireland B title with a 10-point win over Meath in the final.
2011 saw Kerry just stay in Div 2 of the National Hurling League finishing just ahead of Westmeath, the side who had beat them in the Christy Ring Cup final the year before. Kerry for the second year in a row made the final of the Christy Ring Cup when they met another Leinster side, this time Wicklow, but unlike the year before Kerry ran out 2-21 to 2-09 winners to take a first ever Christy Ring Cup. He was also in charge of the Under 21 team and once again landed them the All-Ireland B title for the third year in a row after beating Westmeath in the final.
Kerry had a poor National League in 2012, losing out to Westmeath, Carlow and Derry; they picked up wins over Wicklow and Down to stay in Div 2A. They started the defence of their Christy Ring Cup away to Wicklow, who they had beat in the 2011 final but lost out in a shock result. They then played Kildare in the losers' round but again lost out and ended their campaign. Meyler stepped down after the loss.

===Kilmoyley===

After a number of seasons out of the spotlight, Meyler returned to management in the early 2000s when he took over as boss of Kerry club side Kilmoyley.
In 2001 his club reached the final of the Kerry Senior Hurling Championship for the first time in over a decade. Defending champions Ballyheigue provided the opposition on that occasion; however, it was Meyler’s side who claimed the victory by a single point 2-08 to 2-07. It was Kilmoyley’s first senior Kerry Senior Hurling Championship title since 1971. Kilmoyley faced famed Cork side Blackrock in the Munster Championship, in a close game the Cork sides greater experience to difference in the end. He also led Kilmoyley to the County League Div 1 title.
In 2002 Meyler’s side were back in the final, this time with Lixnaw providing the opposition. Once again the victory went to Kilmoyley on a 1-16 to 2-07 scorline. For the second year in a row Meyler's side faced Blackrock but again came up just short going down 1-12 to 2-13.
Lixnaw were accounted for again in 2003 this time on a 2-10 to 1-05 scoreline as Meyler’s side made in three county titles in-a-row, becoming the first team to do so since Ballyduff between 1991-93.  It was also Kilmoyley's first 3 in a row since the 1962-64 success. Kilmoyley once again entered the Munster Championship this time there drew Tipperary champions Toomevara, but like the 2 years before they came close but ended on the wrong side of a 3-18 to 2-11 scoeline. He once again led his side to a County League title as well as a Munster Senior League title when they beat Cork side Na Piarsaigh in the final.
A fourth consecutive county title was garnered in 2004 as KIlmoyley defeated Causeway 2-15 to 2-09. It was the first time in the clubs history that they won 4 titles in a row and along with Causeway from 1979 to 1982 are the only team to win 4 in a row. He also added a third County League title.
In 2009 he was back to Kilmoyley this time to train their minor team who won the Kerry Minor Hurling Championship beating Ballyduff 1-12 to 1-06 in the final.

===Ballinhassig & Courcey Rovers===

Both Ballinhassig and Courcey Rovers dwell form the South East division of Cork which is known as Carrigdhoun.  In 1991 Ballinhassig regraded to Junior hurling from Intermediate and met Courceys in the Semi final of the South East junior hurling championship.  The clubs would meet 13 times in 15 seasons between 1991 and 2005 in a hugh rivalry with Ballinhassig winning seven times to Courceys five with one draw. John Meyler managed both sides to win the Premier intermediate hurling championship. ( Ballinhassig 2005 & Courceys 2011).

===Cork===

Meyler also served as a selector with the Cork senior inter-county team in the early 2000s.  He became embroiled in something of a controversy in 2002, just prior to the Cork players' strike, when he became involved in a disagreement with All-Ireland winning captain Mark Landers.  After a training session at Páirc Uí Chaoimh Meyler told Landers to 'have a good look around this place. It'll be the last time you'll see it.'  Meyler didn't deny this statement; however, it was at odds with the views of Cork manager Bertie Óg Murphy.Hurling: the Revolution Years p. 289-293  He resigned along with the rest of the management team shortly afterwards.

===Carlow===

After stepping down as Kerry manager he took over as manager of the Carlow senior team.

===Shinty international===

In 2010 Meyler was a selector on the Irish Under 21 Shinty international team that played Scotland.

==Managing Wexford==

Meyler was confirmed as manager of the Wexford senior hurling team on 12 October 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2006/1012/wexford.html|title=Meyler confirmed as new Wexford boss|publisher=Irish Examiner|date=2006-10-12|accessdate=2008-10-10[/tpl]  Other candidates that expressed an interest in the job included former Limerick and Kilkenny hurlers Pat Herbert and Willie O'Connor.  His first season in charge got off to a good start as Wexford progressed through to the semi-final of the National Hurling League.  The county's arch-rivals, Kilkenny, provided the opposition and trounced Meyler's team on a score line of 2-22 to 2-7.  The subsequent Leinster Championship saw the two sides meeting again in the final.  That game turned into another rout as 'the Cats' defeated Wexford by double scores - 2-24 to 1-12.  The subsequent All-Ireland quarter-final saw Meyler having his best victory of the championship as Tipperary, the red-hot favourites, were beaten giving Wexford save passage into the All-Ireland semi-final.  Once again, Kilkenny provided the opposition and handed out another ten-point drubbing.
Meyler's second season in charge saw Wexford have a tough time in the National League.  They finished at the bottom of Division 1A, resulting in relegation to Division 2 for 2009.  Wexford later formally protested against Cork's readmittance to the National League after failing to play their first two games.  In the subsequent Leinster Championship Wexford gave an atrocious display against Dublin.  In the first-half Meyler's side scored two quick goals, however, it took over thirty minutes for the team to score their first point.  That game ended in a draw, however, Wexford went on to win the replay with another unconvincing performance.  The Leinster final on July 6 saw Wexford taking on arch-rivals Kilkenny.  The first half saw Wexford fight tooth and nail with 'the Cats' and they trailed by just two points at half-time. The second half saw Kilkenny emerge and score 2-4 in the first seven minutes to start a rout.  The final score of 5-21 to 0-17 resulted in defeat again for Meyler's side.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2008/0706/kilkenny_wexford.html?gaa|title=Kilkenny 5-21 Wexford 0-17|publisher=RTÉ Sport|date=2008-07-06|accessdate=2008-09-21[/tpl]  Wexford's next game in the championship was an All-Ireland quarter-final meeting with Waterford. That game was a lot closer than the pundits predicted, however, Waterford still won the day by 2-19 to 3-15.  Shortly after this defeat Meyler indicated that he wished to stay on as manager for a third season in 2009.  In early October 2008, however, he was informed by the Wexford County Board that he was being relieved of his duties.  Speculation has been rife since this announcement that a lack of confidence by the players in Meyler's ability forced the county board to take this course of action.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/shocked-meyler-forced-out-after-wexford-hurling-squad-lsquolose-confidencersquo-in-manager-1492626.html|title=Meyler forced out...|publisher=Irish Independent|date=2008-10-08|accessdate=2008-10-10[/tpl]
