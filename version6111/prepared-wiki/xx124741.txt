[[Bang Sai District (1404)]]

CATEGORIES: Amphoe of Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province

Bang Sai ([tpl]lang-th|บางไทร[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-th|bāːŋ sāj|pron[/tpl]) is a district (amphoe) in the southern part of Ayutthaya Province, central Thailand. There is another district of Ayutthaya which shares the same romanization Bang Sai, but has a different spelling in Thai.

==History==

The district goes back to the khwaeng Sena Noi, which was converted into an amphoe in 1898. It was renamed to Ratchakhram in 1923 as the name of central tambon. In 1925 the district office was relocated to tambon Bang Sai, which became the name of the district in 1939.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=56|issue=0 ก|pages=354–364|title=พระราชกฤษฎีกาเปลี่ยนนามอำเภอ กิ่งอำเภอ และตำบลบางแห่ง พุทธศักราช ๒๔๘๒|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2482/A/354.PDF|date=April 17, 1939|language=Thai[/tpl]
