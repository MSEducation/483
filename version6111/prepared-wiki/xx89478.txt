==Biography==

Victor de Broglie in Paris, the eldest son of Victor-François, 2nd duc de Broglie, the prince de Broglie attained the rank of maréchal de camp in the army. He adopted radical opinions and served with the Marquis de La Fayette and the Comte de Rochambeau in the American War of Independence,
The Prince was a member of the Jacobin Club, and sat in the National Constituent Assembly after the French Revolution, constantly voting on the Liberal side. He served as chief of the staff to the First Republic's Army on the Rhine, but, during the Reign of Terror, he was denounced, arrested, and guillotined in Paris.
Since the old duc de Broglie survived him, the prince de Broglie's eldest son, Victor, eventually became the third duc de Broglie. The prince's dying admonition to his little son was to remain faithful to the principles of the Revolution, however unjust and ungrateful it seemed then to be.
