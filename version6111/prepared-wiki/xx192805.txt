Diphosphorus tetraiodide, P2I4, is an orange crystalline solid, and a versatile reducing agent. The phosphorus atom has an NMR chemical shift of about +100 ppm (downfield of H3PO4) (+108 ppm in CS2). Phosphorus contains a rare oxidation state of +2 in this compound.

==Synthesis==

Diphosphorus tetraiodide is easily generated by the disproportionation of phosphorus triiodide in dry ether:
It can also be obtained by reacting phosphorus trichloride and potassium iodide in anhydrous conditions.[tpl] cite journal | author = H. Suzuki, T. Fuchita, A. Iwasa, T.
