==History==

===Toponymy===

Hollingworth was recorded Holisurde before 1059 and in 1086.[tpl]cite book|last=British Archaeological Association|title=The Archaeological journal, Volume 17|year=1860[/tpl] Holling, holi, holy, holyn or holyng mean holly and vrde, wurde, wurth or worth meaning a farm or open clearing where there were meadows. In 1059, Hollingworth was surrounded by dense forests. The Latin word Surde, also means dense or dumb suggesting that the name Holisurde may have been a combination of a placename and a Latin description of that particular place.[tpl]cite book|last=Johnston|first=James|title=The place-names of England and Wales[/tpl]

===Early history===

Hollingworth in Longdendale is located on an ancient pagan religious site known as Wedneshough Green. A grassy knoll opposite the Gunn Inn in Hollingworth, Wedneshough was anciently called 'Wedenshaw' or 'Wodens Hawe' after the pagan god Woden.[tpl]cite book|last=Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society|title=Transactions of the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society|year=1961[/tpl] The region was populated by a tribe of Celts called the Pecsaetans who are thought to have be absorbed into the British Celts of Longdendale called the Brigantes. This group became a distinct ethnic tribe within the Mercian Kingdom of the West Angles.[tpl]cite book|last=Millward|first=Roy|title=The Peak District|year=1975[/tpl] 
Hollingworth was part of the ancient Hundred of Hamestan before the year 1000 which is believed to be the ancient boundaries of the Pecsaetan tribesmen. After the Norman Conquest in 1086, The Hundred of Hamestan was redefined and renamed the Hundred of Macclesfield.[tpl]cite book|last=Oman|first=Sir Charles|title=England Before Norman Conquest|year=1949[/tpl]

===Manor===

Hollingworth was an ancient manor governed by a local lord. A single local family were in possession of the lordship of Hollingworth for more than 700 years and were styled 'Hollingworth of Hollingworth' or De Hollyngworth (Holynworth). In this part of Cheshire, local lords assumed the name of their manor as their surname. Some families, such as the Hollingworths were even granted distinct arms by the Earl of Chester.[tpl]cite book|last=Rylands|first=John Paul|title=The Visitation of Cheshire in the Year 1580, Made by Robert Glover, Somerse[/tpl]  Certain members of the Hollingworth family from Hollingworth Hall may carry the family's ancient arms, being three holly leaves.[tpl]cite book|last=Starken|first=Arthur|title=Lincolnshire pedigrees, Volume 2[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Noble|first=Mark|title=A history of the College of arms, and the lives of all the kings, heralds[/tpl] 
In 1059 during the Saxon reign of Cheshire, Hollingworth was owned by a 'freeman' who owed his rights to his senior lord; the then Saxon Earl of Chester, Edwin. The Earl was the chief lord of all the manors within the Hamestan Hundred including Hollingworth. Earl Edwin leased the manor of Hollingworth to a 'freeman' for his lifetime and that of his descendants for an annual rent and military service.  In 1059, Hollingworth was recorded as having 30 acres of productive farmland. The Saxon 'freeman' in possession of Hollingworth manor was later removed sometime before 1086 by the invading Normans.[tpl]cite book|last=Morris|first=John|title=Doomsday Book: Cheshire|year=1978[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=British Archaeological Association|title=The Archaeological journal, Volume 17|year=1844[/tpl]  The Hollingworth surname came into use after 1140 and before 1222, which contradicts Captain Robert De Hollyngworthe's (born 1791) claim, published in Burkes Landed Gentry, of the family's direct descent back to 1022.[tpl]cite book|last=Burke|first=Sir Bernard|title=A genealogical and heraldic dictionary of the landed gentryVolume 1|year=1862[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Chetham Society|title=Earl's manors listed under Henbury.

After the Norman Invasion, Earl Edwin's lands were forfeited and came under the control of the Normans. An account in 1086 for the Norman Earl of Chester, Hugh Lupus, shows that Hollingworth manor was barren and worthless during his reign.[tpl]cite book|last=Middleton|first=Thomas|title=Annals of Hyde and district: containing historical reminiscences of Denton, Haughton, Dukinfield, Mottram, Longdendale, Bredbury, Marple, and the neighbouring townships|year=1899[/tpl] Paul Howson and William Booth wrote that 'No population is recorded for the area covered by the later forest of Macclesfield or the Lordship of Longdendale ...'.[tpl]cite book|last=Howson and Booth|first=Paul and William|title=The financial administration of the lordship and County Chester 1272–1377[/tpl] The Lordship of Longdendale was a term that came into common use around 1359, to describe a parcel of manors which includes Hollingworth.[tpl]cite book|last=Harrop|first=John|title=Extenta dominii de Longdendale anno xxxiiij° Edwardi tercij: Extent of the lordship of Longdendale|year=1359[/tpl] The wholesale ejectment of the Saxons in possessions of manors in Longdendale appears to have specific to those lands under the control of Hugh Lupus as the Earl of Chester. The Earl replaced the original Saxon 'freeman' on the Cheshire side of Longdendale with a new group of Norman and Saxon farmers under the control of a local Saxon chieftain called Wulfric (pronounced Uluric). On the Derbyshire side of Longdendale, which was under the control of William the Conqueror (King William I), many ancient Saxon families were able to remain in control of their lands. Neighbouring towns in Derbyshire such as Padfield, Dinting, Charlesworth and Ludworth had the same Saxon owners before and after conquest. 
The Domesday Book shows that Hollingworth was held directly by the Earl of Chester with no local lord in control of the manor at this time. The Saxon chieftain Wulfric appears to have managed the various manors of Longdendale, including Hollingworth, on behalf of the Earl of Chester.[tpl]cite book|last=Higham|first=N.J|title=The origins of Cheshire|year=1993[/tpl] Heavily wooded and dangerous due to forest wolves, Hollingworth and the neighbouring manors of Mottram, Matley, Tintwistle and Stayley appear to have been a wilderness until as late as 1211. By 1140 local farmers in Longdendale begin to assume the name of their manor as their surname. Charters are recorded for the neighbouring manors of Newton in 1189, Bredbury in 1185 and Hyde in 1193 were the local lord is given a surname. Sometime shortly before 1211, a Norman knight of Saxon origins took up residence at Bucton Castle in neighbouring Tintwistle.[tpl]cite book|last=Selkirk|first=A|title=Current archaeology, Issues 214-225|year=2008[/tpl]  Sir William De Neville (De NovaVilla), ancestor had fought with William the Conqueror in 1066 and was therefore loyal to the Norman of Earl of Chester.[tpl]cite book|last=Swallow|first=Henry|title=De Nova Villa: or, The house of Nevill in sunshine and shade|year=1885[/tpl]  De Neville was installed as over-lord on behalf of the Earl of Chester to manage the local lords in possession of Hollingworth, Wolley, Broadbottom, Hattersley, Wernet, Matley, Stayley, Mottram-in-Longdendale and Tintwistle.[tpl]cite book|last=Harrop|first=John|title=Extenta dominii de Longdendale anno xxxiiij° Edwardi tercij: Extent of the lordship of Longdendale.|year=1359[/tpl] 
In 1211, William De Neville gave his son-in-law, Thomas de Burgh or Burgo, control of all the manors in Longdendale as the supreme over-lord. Around 1222, Thomas de Burgh took the neighbouring manor of Godley away from Albinus and gave it to Adam, son of Reginald de Bredbury.[tpl]cite book|last=Barraclough|first=Geoffrey|title=Facsimiles of early Cheshire charters|year=1957|publisher=Record Society of Lancashire and Cheshire[/tpl] Witness to this deed was a 'Tomas de Holinwurthe'.[tpl]cite book|last=Society of Antiquaries of London|title=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of London, Volume 1|year=1849[/tpl] 
The earliest records for the Hollingworth family of Hollingworth manor are Tomas de Holinwurthe circa 1222, 1246; and Henry de Holenwart in 1222.[tpl]cite book|last=Yeatman|first=John|title=THE FUDAL HISTORY OF THE COUNTY OF DERBYSHIRE|publisher=G. PHILLIPSON & SONS, MARKET PLACE.[/tpl]  The ancient manor of Hollingworth, which includes the minor manors of Thorncliffe and Wolley, was held by the senior family of de Holynworths of Hollingworth Hall by 'knight's service'. By 1359, the manor of Hollingworth was owned by different scions of the Hollingworth family.  Greater Hollingworth was owned by the senior branch of the family living at Hollingworth Hall as lords of Hollingworth manor. Little Hollingworth was inherited by a younger brother who lived at Old Mottram Hall who also married the heiress to Matley Hall. A younger sister held a share of Thorncliffe manor, also called Little Hollingwoth manor and was at Thorncliffe Hall in 1359.[tpl]cite book|last=Davenport|title=Davenport Puter Rolls for Longdendale|year=1359[/tpl]
The ancient family of Hollingworth migrated to London, Lincoln, Maidestone in Kent and Dale Abbey in Derbyshire. A pedigree for the original family shows they descended in a continuous male line from the original Lords of Hollingworth to the present day. Branches of this ancient family still live in England, Australia and New Zealand.
Local gentry owning lands within Hollingworth manor 1280–1378:
A list of nobles and gentry owning lands at Hollingworth was recorded among the Davenport family's Puter Collections for Longdendale; which was a tax raised to finance a medieval constabulary. People required to pay puter for their lands in Hollingworth before 1342, include Nicholas Holynworthe, Robert the son of John de Holinworthe, Adam de Holinworthe, William Thortolgh (de Thorncliffe), Dolbe Traz, William Wolegh,  William de le Soleris, Ralph de Wolegh, Dike de Wolegh, Robert de le Soleris, John de la Halle and Dikon de le Soler. By 1342, land owners now include John de Holynworthe (lord of Hollingworth), Robert de Holynworthe (Mottram Old Hall), Robert Godart, William son of Gilbert Godleigh, Richard Wolegh, William Peryson and Christiana daughter of John, Lord of Holynworthe who was the wife of Tom de Honford (Thorncliffe Hall). In 1357, the owners of land in Hollingworth remained much the same, however Robert de Holynworthe was managing the manor on behalf of his brother John while he was absent during the French wars. Note: John Hollingworth, Robert Hollingworth and Christiana Honford (née Hollingworth) all held their share of Hollingworth manor by knights service, so it was customary for members of the family to be absent during the various wars with the Welsh, Scots and French. By 1378, the ownership of lands must have changed considerably, as those paying puter were John de Holynworth, Thomas de Holynworth, Richard le Barker, William Godley and Richard Stavely.[tpl]cite book|title=The early history of the Davenports of Davenport|publisher=Manchester University Press[/tpl] 
By 1378, it would seem that at least seventeen different families had all owned lands within the manor of Hollingworth.

===Surname===

In the neighbouring manor of Ashton-under-lynne another family used the surname of Hollinworth in 1422. The rental roll of the manor of Ashton-under-Lynne in Lancashire, records a John de Hollinworth renting a farm at 'Birchenshaw', Syssot the wife of Dycon de Hollinworth, using 'Palden Wood', Richard de Hollinsworth with the farm at 'Palden Legh' and possibly the same Richard de Hollinworth, renting tenements within the village of Ashton.[tpl]cite book|last=Hibbert-ware|first=Samuel|title=Three Lancashire documents of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuriescomprising: I.--The great de Lacy inquisition, Feb. 16, 1311.

These people do not appear to have come from Hollingworth manor in Cheshire. When Hibbet-ware compiled the Ashton-under-lynne rental roll for 1422, he notes that the family of Hollinworth documented within this rental roll, obtain their surname from the farm located at a place called the 'hollies' within Lord Asshton's manor. This is evidence of men with a single name such as John, Dycon and Richard, being given the surname 'de Hollinworth'. Families originating from Ashton-under-lynne with the surname Hollingworth appear to be unrelated to the family of de Holynworthe of Hollingworth Hall. This example, demonstrates how the surname of Hollingworth came to be used in places other than the village of Hollingworth.[tpl]cite book|last=Hibbert-ware|first=Samuel|title=Three Lancashire documents of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuriescomprising: I.--The great de Lacy inquisition, Feb. 16, 1311.

==History==

The village is named after the Hollingworth of Hollingworth family. The Hollingworths of Hollingworth are descendants of the Anglo-Norman family Houxvert, from French houx vert, or green holly.Hollingworth.com, accessed 2 July 2006 (Note: there is no evidence to support Frank Hollingworth's claim. See history above)
This is the conjecture of Frank Hollingworth, and he has published no research to back up the claims made that the family came with the Normans, not conquered by the Normans. The family motto is "Disce ferenda pati", or "Suffer that which must be borne", which is a veiled reference to the Norman Conquest of 1066 and the resulting subjugation of the Anglo-Saxon inhabitants, of which the Hollyngworthe family was one, and the village named for the family. 
The family estate or manor was known as Hollingworth Hall, no longer standing, but the family's chapel does still remain. The Hollingworth/Hollingsworth name is an early Saxon name originating around 1022 when this family moved into northeast Cheshire and purchased an estate named Hollingworth Manor. (Note: there is no evidence to support Frank Hollingworth's claim. See history above) The name means a "Farm of Holly Trees". The Domesday Survey made during the Norman Conquests lists this manor as lying on the edge of a great woods at Macclesfield.DVHS Family History: Hollingworth, accessed 16 January 2008
A visitation by an official herald in 1580 included the gentry, John Hollingsworth, Gentleman and Robert Hollingsworth of Hollinsworth. A further record of the time period states that Robert of Hollingsworth Hall is of whom the family descends. He was listed as the Magistrate for the counties of Cheshire and Lancaster. The church and hall belonging to this family that contain the Hollingsworth Coat of Arms is still standing. The last family member to own the hall, Capt. Robert Hollingsworth, died in 1865. The motto included was "Learn to suffer what must be borne."

==Transport==

The village is served by the A628 road (leading to the Woodhead pass to Barnsley) and the A57 road (leading to the Snake Pass to Sheffield). Going west, the A57 joins the M67 motorway a couple miles from the village. The M67 goes towards Manchester.  It has severe traffic congestion.
