Unquestionable Presence is the second album by the death metal band Atheist. It was released in 1991 and added a new sound by using jazz-like harmonies, subtle Latin rhythms and unusual time signatures.

==Album information==

It is considered a landmark album in the genre of technical death metal.Badin, O. (December 2006). Terrorizer #151, "Death Metal: The DM Top 40", page 53. 
Bassist Roger Patterson wrote the bass lines for Unquestionable Presence, but died in a touring van accident before the recording sessions took place. His work, however, can be heard on the pre-production demos included with the 2005 re-release. Tony Choy was brought in as a replacement to play bass on the album.

==Reception==

James Hinchcliffe described the album in Terrorizer as "the very pinnacle of scorching yet brain-twisting technical metal". The Wire (p.Â 53) described Unquestionable Presence as a "more complex and progressive album, every song rocketing through multiple tricky time signatures and endless variations on already baffling riffs."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=6930013 |title=Atheist - Unquestionable Presence CD Album |publisher=Cduniverse.com |date=2005-08-30 |accessdate=2012-03-13[/tpl]
