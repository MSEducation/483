 "Because of the gravity of our position, the Supreme Command could not hope that air-raids on London and Paris would make the enemy more disposed to sue for peace. Permission was therefore refused for the use of a particularly effective incendiary bomb, expressly designed for attacks on the two capitals, which had been produced in great quantities during the month of August (1918) and which was to have been used in the air-bombardment of the two capitals. The considerable destruction which would have ensued would no longer be enough to influence the course of the war; one could not tolerate carrying out such destruction for its own sake."</ref> this planned raid was also reported in ''[[Le Figaro]]'' on 21 December 1918.<ref>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/63755791#pstart5312606 ''The Mail'' (Adelaide), 21 December 1918, p. 1]</ref> The lightness of elektron meant that a large aeroplane like the [[Zeppelin-Staaken Riesenflugzeuge|Zeppelin-Staaken R-type bomber]] could carry hundreds of bomblets.<ref>Hanson, Neil.

The German incendiary bomb weighed about 1Â kg and consisted of an outer casing made of elektron alloy, which was filled with thermite pellets and fitted with a fuse. The fuse ignited the thermite which in turn ignited the magnesium casing; it burned for about fifteen minutes. Trying to douse the fire with water only intensified the reaction. It could not be extinguished and burned at such a high temperature that it could penetrate armour plate.[ref]
