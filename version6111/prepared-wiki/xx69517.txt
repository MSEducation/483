The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco is an ecclesiastical territory or diocese of the Catholic Church in the northern California region of the United States. It covers the City and County of San Francisco and the Counties of Marin and San Mateo.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dsnfr.html | title=Catholic Hierarchy profile of the Archdiocese of San Francisco| accessdate=April 7, 2007[/tpl] The Archdiocese of San Francisco was canonically erected on July 29, 1853, by Pope Pius IX and its cathedral is the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption. 
The first church in the Archdiocese of San Francisco is older than the Archdiocese itself; Mission San Francisco de Asís was founded on June 29, 1776 by Franciscan Friars. The mission church that stands today was completed in 1791 and attached next door is Mission Dolores Basilica. The Franciscans who founded the mission also are credited with naming the City and County of San Francisco, and the entire region, after their patron, Saint Francis of Assisi.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.stmarycathedralsf.org/ | title=Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption| accessdate=April 7, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.missiondolores.org/ | title=Mission Dolores Basilica| accessdate=April 7, 2007[/tpl]

San Francisco once included among its suffragans the former dioceses of Grass Valley, Roman Catholic Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego, Monterey, Monterey-Fresno, and Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles.
The Chancellery Office of the Archdiocese of San Francisco, originally located in 1853 at California and Dupont Streets, moved in 1891 to 1100 Franklin Street, in 1955 re-located to 445 Church Street, on the Mission Dolores Basilica property. The present headquarters, as of 2001 of the Archdiocese of San Francisco are located at One Peter Yorke Way, a short street in San Francisco named after Father Peter Yorke, an Irish-American Catholic priest. Peter Yorke Way and Starr King Way are off of Geary Street as it becomes Geary Boulevard.

==Archbishops==

Two Archbishops of San Francisco have served as the leader of the episcopal conference of bishops and archbishops in the United States. Archbishop Edward Hanna served as the first chairman of the National Catholic Welfare Council (renamed National Catholic Welfare Conference in 1922) from its founding in 1919 until his retirement in 1935. Archbishop John R. Quinn was president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United States Catholic Conference from 1977–1980. To date, no sitting Archibishop of San Francisco has been elevated to cardinal. One former Archbishop of San Francisco, William Levada, was created a Cardinal in 2006 after being reassigned to serve as the Prefect for the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) in the Roman Curia.
