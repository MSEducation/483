==Career==

===Australia===

Jack Young started racing bikes with younger brother Frank on the Sand Pits at Findon in Adelaide, before starting his speedway career at the Kilburn Speedway on 9 May 1947 riding a 1926 Harley-Davidson Peashooter, riding alongside older brother Wally "Joey" Young (b. 1916 - d. 1990) and younger brother Frank. Jack and Frank both represented Australia in test matches against England. Quickly proving himself to be one of the best riders in Adelaide, Jack would win his first South Australian Championship in 1948. He would go on to win the SA Championship again in 1954, 1955, 1956, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1963 and 1964, all at Rowley Park Speedway. Young would win the Queensland State Championship in 1953 at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground, and the Victorian State Championship in 1957.
Despite his two World Championships, nine South Australian Championships and the Queensland and Victorian titles, Jack Young would never win or even place in the Australian Individual Speedway Championship. Young declined several invitations to ride in the Australian championship, often preferring to take a break from speedway to enjoy the Australian summer and go fishing.
Jack Young announced his retirement from Speedway in 1964 on the night he won his ninth and last SA Championship. Young and fellow Adelaide rider John Boulger hold the record for SA title wins with nine each.
In 2008, Young was inducted into the Australian Speedway Hall of Fame.

===International===

After winning his first South Australian championship in 1948 at Kilburn, as well as impressive displays for Australia in home Test's against England, Jack Young had the attention of British promoters. He was signed by the Edinburgh Monarchs in 1949 after they paid his fare to come over for a trial. He scored maximum points on his debut, winning all six of his rides.
In 1951, Jack Young made history by becoming the first second division rider to become World Champion when he won the title at the Wembley Stadium in London. He defeated England's Split Waterman and fellow Australian Jack Biggs in a three way run-off for the title after each had finished the meeting on 12 points.Henry, J. & Moultray, I. (2001). Speedway in Scotland. Stroud: Tempus Publishing  ISBN 0-7524-2229-4 Jack Young was a prolific scorer and collected many track records during his career.
In 1952 Young moved up a division by joining the West Ham Hammers, and also retained his World title, again at Wembley. He stayed with the Hammers until the end of the 1955 season. Young stayed in Australia for the next two seasons, but in 1958 he returned to the UK to ride for the Coventry Bees. After returning home to Adelaide in 1959, he again rode for the Bees in 1960 and 1961.
Jack Young's last World Final appearance was as a reserve rider for the 1961 Championship in Malmö, Sweden. Neither Young, nor the other reserve rider Leif Larsson from Sweden got to ride in the final.

==Death==

Jack died of a lung disorder in Adelaide's Modbury Hospital on 28 August 1987 at the age of sixty two.http://www.rowleypark.com/pictures/p17_sectionid/1/p17_imageid/505 Years of riding through dust clouds on British cinder tracks, as well as being a heavy cigarette smoker had left Young with Emphysema. He was survived by his wife Joan whom he had married on 12 May 1945 in the All Saints Church of England in the Adelaide suburb of Hindmarsh. Jack and Joan Young (born Joan Mary Carroll) had one son and two daughters.
Jack Young was the idol of a young rider from Christchurch, New Zealand who rode against him in Australia during the early 1960s, with the two forming a friendship that would last until Jack's passing in 1987. That rider, Ivan Mauger, would go on to win a record six Speedway World Championships (1968, 1969, 1970, 1972, 1977, 1979), three Long Track World Championships (1971, 1972, 1976), four Speedway World Team Cups (1968, 1971, 1972, 1979), and two Speedway World Pairs Championships (1969, 1970). Mauger credits advice he received from Young at the 1960 Australian Long Track Championship in Port Pirie for putting him on the path to becoming a World Champion.

==Jack Young Solo Cup==

The Jack Young Solo Cup is held in his honor every year at the Gillman Speedway in Adelaide after being previously held from 1990-1997 at the old North Arm Speedway. The first cup was won by Swedish rider Jimmy Nilsen. The second was won again by a Swedish rider, 1984 and 1988 Ice Racing World Champion Erik Stenlund. Ten times Australian Solo Champion Leigh Adams from Mildura holds the record with five wins in 1994 and 1997 at North Arm, and 2001, 2002 and 2003 at Gillman. The first South Australian rider to win the cup was Shane Bowes who won in 1996.
1995 winner Tomasz Gollob from Poland is the only rider to win the cup who has emulated Young's feat of winning the Speedway World Championship. Gollob won the 2010 Speedway Grand Prix series to become the 2010 World Champion, while Leigh Adams was the 1992 World Under-21 Champion.
With the closure of North Arm in 1997, and the new Gillman Speedway not ready for championship meetings until 2000, the Jack Young Solo Cup was not held from 1998-2000.
After being a single, six lap race for many years, the Jack Young Solo Cup is currently run in a championship format with riders earning points in the heats before the top scorers go into a semi final and then the final. The current holder of the Jack Young Solo Cup is Adelaide rider and current British Under 21 Champion Robert Branford who won the cup on 26 January 2014.
