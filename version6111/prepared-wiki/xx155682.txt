Mac Randall of The New York Observer described the band as "aggro-artsy trio fond of awkward time signatures, sly rhythmic manipulation, curlicuing vocal lines, and giving one song two separate track numbers for no obvious reason... These guys make a virtue out of attention-deficit disorder."  PopMatters called the band "one of the most exciting, if not one of the best, new acts in indie rock right now."Jagernauth,  Kevin (October 17, 2003). "The Forms: Icarus", PopMatters.
