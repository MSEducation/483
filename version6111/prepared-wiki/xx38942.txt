Donald "Don" King (born August 20, 1931) is an American boxing promoter whose career highlights include promoting "The Rumble in the Jungle" and the "Thrilla in Manila". King has promoted some of the most prominent names in boxing, including Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Larry Holmes, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Julio César Chávez, Ricardo Mayorga, Andrew Golota, Félix Trinidad, Roy Jones, Jr. and Marco Antonio Barrera. Almost all of them sued him for defrauding them; King settled most lawsuits for six- to eight-digit pay-offs while managing to avoid a conviction of felony fraud or time in jail.

==Early life==

King was born in Cleveland, Ohio. After dropping out of Kent State University, he ran an illegal bookmaking operation, and was charged for killing two men in incidents 13 years apart. The first was determined to be justifiable homicide after it was found that King shot Hillary Brown in the back and killed him while he was attempting to rob one of King's gambling houses.Don King - A Prison Education King was convicted of second degree murder for the second killing in 1966 after he was found guilty of stomping to death an employee, Sam Garrett, who owed him $600. In an ex parte meeting with King's attorney, the judge reduced King's conviction to nonnegligent manslaughter for which King served just under four years in prison. King was later pardoned for the crime in 1983 by Ohio Governor Jim Rhodes, with letters from Jesse Jackson, Coretta Scott King, George Voinovich, Art Modell, and Gabe Paul, among others, being written in support of King."SPORTS PEOPLE; Don King Pardoned", New York Times, January 5, 1983.

==Career==

King entered the boxing world after convincing Muhammad Ali to box in a charity exhibition for a local hospital in Cleveland with the help of singer Lloyd Price. Early on he formed a partnership with a local promoter named Don Elbaum, who already had a stable of fighters in Cleveland and years of experience in boxing. In 1974, King negotiated to promote a heavyweight championship fight between Muhammad Ali  and George Foreman in Zaire, popularly known as "The Rumble in the Jungle".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/usopen/2615095/Apple-Grapple-brings-a-gleam-to-Don-Kings-eye---Tennis.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=US Open: 'Apple Grapple' brings a gleam to Don King's eye.

King's rivals all sought to promote the bout, but King was able to secure the then-record $10 million purse through an arrangement with the government of Zaire.
King solidified his position as one of boxing's preeminent promoters the following year with the third fight between  Ali and Joe Frazier in Manila,Amazon.com: Only in America: The Life and Crimes of Don King: Jack Newfield: Books the capital of the Philippines, which King deemed the "Thrilla in Manila". Aside from promoting the premier heavyweight fights of the 1970s, King was also busy expanding his boxing empire.

Fighters like Larry Holmes, Wilfred Benítez, Roberto Durán, Salvador Sánchez, Wilfredo Gómez, and Alexis Argüello would all fight under the Don King Productions promotional banner in the 1970s.
For the next two decades, King continued to be among boxing's most successful promoters.

==Controversies==

Don King has been investigated for possible connections with organized crime. During a 1992 Senate investigation, King invoked the Fifth Amendment when questioned about his connection to mobster John Gotti.Finkelman, Paul.  Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present: From the Age of Segregation to the Twenty-First Century, Volume 1, p. 99 (Oxford University Press, 2008).

Mike Tyson, the former undisputed World Heavyweight Boxing Champion, says of his former manager, "(King is) a wretched, slimy, reptilian motherfucker. This is supposed to be my 'black brother', right?  He's just a bad man, a real bad man. He would kill his own mother for a dollar. He's ruthless, he's deplorable, he's greedy... and he doesn't know how to love anybody."Tyson (film), 2008

===Lawsuits and prosecutions===

====Muhammad Ali====

King has been involved in several litigation cases with boxers that were focused on fraud. In 1982 he was sued by Muhammad Ali for underpaying him $1.1 million for a fight with Larry Holmes. King called in an old friend of Ali, Jeremiah Shabazz, and handed him a suitcase containing $50,000 in cash and a letter ending Ali's lawsuit against King. He asked Shabazz to visit Ali (who was in hospital due to his failing health) and get him to sign the letter and then give Ali the $50,000. Ali signed. The letter even gave King the right to promote any future Ali fights. According to Shabazz, "Ali was ailing by then and mumbling a lot. I guess he needed the money." Shabazz later regretted helping King. Ali's lawyer cried when he learned that Ali had ended the lawsuit without telling him.[tpl]cite book | author=Newfield, Jack | title=The Life and Crimes of Don King: The Shame of Boxing in America| publisher=William Morrow| year=1995| isbn=978-0-9740201-0-5 | pages=162–4[/tpl]

====Larry Holmes====

Larry Holmes has alleged that over the course of his career King cheated him out of $10 million in fight purses, including claiming 25% of his purses as a hidden manager. Holmes says he received only $150,000 of a contracted $500,000 for his fight with Ken Norton, and $50,000 of $200,000 for facing Earnie Shavers, and claims King cut his purses for bouts with Muhammad Ali, Tex Cobb, and Leon Spinks, underpaying him $2 million, $700,000, and $250,000, respectively. Holmes sued King over the accounting and auditing for the Gerry Cooney fight, charging that he was underpaid by $2 to $3 million.[tpl]cite book | author=Newfield, Jack | title=The Life and Crimes of Don King: The Shame of Boxing in America| publisher=William Morrow| year=1995| isbn=978-0-9740201-0-5 | page=145[/tpl] Holmes sued King after King deducted a $300,000 'finder's fee' from his fight purse against Mike Tyson; Holmes settled for $150,000 and also signed a legal agreement pledging not to give any more negative information about King to reporters.[tpl]cite book | author=Newfield, Jack | title=The Life and Crimes of Don King: The Shame of Boxing in America| publisher=William Morrow| year=1995| isbn=978-0-9740201-0-5 | pages=147–8[/tpl]

====Tim Witherspoon====

Tim Witherspoon was threatened with being blackballed if he did not sign exclusive contracts with King and his stepson Carl. Not permitted to have his own lawyer present, he signed four "contracts of servitude" (according to Jack Newfield). One was an exclusive promotional contract with Don King, two were managerial contracts with Carl King, identical except one was "for show" that gave Carl King 33% of Witherspoon's purses and the other gave King a 50% share, more than is allowed by many boxing commissions. The fourth contract was completely blank.[tpl]cite book | author=Newfield, Jack | title=The Life and Crimes of Don King: The Shame of Boxing in America| publisher=William Morrow| year=1995| isbn=978-0-9740201-0-5 | pages=216–7[/tpl]
Other examples include Witherspoon being promised $150,000 for his fight with Larry Holmes, but receiving only $52,750. King's son Carl took 50% of Witherspoon's purse, illegal under Nevada rules, and the WBC sanctioning fee was also deducted from his purse.[tpl]cite book | author=Newfield, Jack | title=The Life and Crimes of Don King: The Shame of Boxing in America| publisher=William Morrow| year=1995| isbn=978-0-9740201-0-5 | page=219[/tpl] He was forced to train at King's own training camp at Orwell, Ohio, instead of Ali's Deer Lake camp which Ali allowed Witherspoon to use for free. For his fight with Greg Page he received a net amount of $44,460 from his guaranteed purse of $250,000. King had deducted money for training expenses, sparring partners, fight and airplane tickets for his friends and family. Witherspoon was never paid a stipulated $100,000 for his training expenses and instead was billed $150 a day for using King's training camp. Carl King again received 50% of his purse, despite Don King Promotions falsely claiming he had only been paid 33%.[tpl]cite book | author=Newfield, Jack | title=The Life and Crimes of Don King: The Shame of Boxing in America| publisher=William Morrow| year=1995| isbn=978-0-9740201-0-5 | pages=221–2[/tpl]  HBO paid King $1,700,000 for Witherspoon to fight Frank Bruno.

Though the documentary repeated many claims already made, King said he had now had enough. King's attorney said "It was slanted to show Don in the worst way. It was one-sided from day one, Don is a strong man, but he has been hurt by this."Promoter takes issue with SportsCentury piece January 13, 2005
The case was dismissed on summary judgment with a finding that King couldn't show "actual malice" from the defendants.
