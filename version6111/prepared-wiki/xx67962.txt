[[Snowplough turn]]

CATEGORIES: Skiing techniques

The snowplough turn (or snowplow turn) (or pizza), also known as a wedge turn, is a ski braking and turning technique taught to beginners. The front tips of the skis are brought together and the tails pushed wide apart, with the knees rolled inwards slightly. By applying pressure against the snow with the inside edges of the skis speed is reduced, making turning in such a configuration and stopping completely possible.
However, it is much less effective on steep runs, and much less efficient than the parallel turn used by advanced skiers.

==Terminology==

At the completion of a turn, the downhill ski is the outside ski, and the uphill ski is the inside ski.  When a new turn is initiated, the old inside ski becomes the new outside ski.
Once mastered the skier can move on to the somewhat more advanced turn, the Stem Christie.
