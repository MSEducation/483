Out of the Blue is an American fantasy sitcom that aired on ABC during the fall of 1979. It is chiefly notable as having featured a Mork & Mindy crossover, and for the controversy surrounding its status as a spin-off of Happy Days.
The series stars Jimmy Brogan as Random, an angel-in-training who is assigned to live with (and act as guardian angel for) a family and work as a high school teacher. The series aired from September 9 to December 16, 1979.  Nine episodes had been aired at the time of cancellation.  Some completed material was never broadcast.

==Spin-off debate==

Out of the Blue has engendered debate amongst some viewers concerning its precise relationship to Happy Days.  The controversy arises from the fact that the first episode of the show was broadcast a little over one week prior to an episode of  Happy Days featuring Jimmy Brogan as the character Random. Television observer and owner of Sitcoms Online, Todd Fuller, maintains that because "Chachi Sells His Soul" aired on September 18, 1979, Random's appearance on this Happy Days episode was a crossover.  He goes on to postulate: "The Happy Days episode was likely a promotional tool for Out of the Blue to make the character more known."Out of the Blue at sitcomsonline.com
Thom Holbrook, veteran crossover and spin-off analyst, sees the arguments against calling it a spin-off, but ultimately concludes: "Making it a crossover would be basing things all on an odd bit of scheduling decades ago.  The intent was spin off.  The tone of the Happy Days episode is that of a dry run on the character, that of a pilot episode."Out of the Blue at Thom Holbrook's Spin-Offs and Crossovers Pages
