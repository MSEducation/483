[[Choline acetyltransferase]]

CATEGORIES: EC 2.3.1

Choline acetyltransferase (commonly abbreviated as ChAT, but sometimes CAT) is a transferase enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. ChAT catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from the coenzyme, acetyl-CoA, to choline yielding acetylcholine (ACh). ChAT is found in high concentration in cholinergic neurons, both in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). As with all nerve terminal proteins, ChAT is produced in the body of the neuron and is transported to the nerve terminal, where its concentration is highest. Presence of ChAT in a nerve cell classifies this cell as a “cholinergic” neuron. In humans, the choline acetyltransferase enyzme is encoded by the CHAT gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Strauss WL, Kemper RR, Jayakar P, Kong CF, Hersh LB, Hilt DC, Rabin M | title = Human choline acetyltransferase gene maps to region 10q11-q22.2 by in situ hybridization | journal = Genomics | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 396–8 |date=February 1991 | pmid = 1840566 | doi = 10.1016/0888-7543(91)90273-H| url =  [/tpl]

==History & Discovery==

Choline acetyltransferase was first described by David Nachmansohn and A. L. Machado in 1943.[tpl]cite journal|last=Nachmansohn|first=D.|coauthors=A. L. Machado|title=The Formation of Acetylcholine. A New Enzyme: Choline Acetylase|journal=J. Physiol.|year=1943|volume=6|issue=5|pages=397–403[/tpl]  A German biochemist, Nachmansohn had been studying the process of nerve impulse conduction and utilization of energy-yielding chemical reactions in cells, expanding upon the works of Nobel laureates Otto Warburg and Otto Meyerhof on fermentation, glycolysis, and muscle contraction. Based on prior research showing that "acetylcholine’s actions on structural proteins" were responsible for nerve impulses, Nachmansohn and Machado investigated the origin of acetylcholine.[tpl]cite journal|last=BERMAN|first=R|coauthors=WILSON, IB; NACHMANSOHN, D|title=Choline acetylase specificity in relation to biological function.|journal=Biochimica et biophysica acta|date=September–October 1953|volume=12|issue=1-2|pages=315–24|pmid=13115440|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006300253901504|accessdate=2014-02-21[/tpl]
The acetyl transferase mode of action was unknown at the time of this discovery, however Nachmansohn hypothesized the possibility of acetylphosphate or phosphorylcholine exchanging the phosphate (from ATP) for choline or acetate ion.  It was not until 1945 that Coenzyme A (CoA) was discovered simultaneously and independently by three laboratories,[tpl]cite journal|last=Lipmann|first=Fritz|coauthors=N. O. Kaplan|title=A Common Factor in the Enzymatic Acetylation of  Sulfanilamide and of Choline|journal=J. Biol. Chem|year=1946|volume=162|pages=743–744[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Lipton|first=M. A.|journal=Federation Proc|year=1946|volume=5|page=145[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Nachmansohn|first=David|coauthors=M. Berman|title=Studies on choline acetylase: III. On the preparation of the coenzyme and its effects on the enzyme|journal=J. Biol. Chem|year=1846|volume=165|pages=551–563[/tpl]  Nachmansohn's being one of these. Subsequently acetyl-CoA, at the time called “active acetate,” was discovered in 1951.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lynen|first=F.|coauthors=Reichert & Rueff|journal=Liebigs Ann.|year=1951|volume=574|issue=1|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003269768901954[/tpl]  The 3D structure of rat-derived ChAT was not solved until nearly 60 years later, in 2004.[tpl]cite journal|last=Govindasamy|first=L|coauthors=Pedersen, B; Lian, W; Kukar, T; Gu, Y; Jin, S; Agbandje-McKenna, M; Wu, D; McKenna, R|title=Structural insights and functional implications of choline acetyltransferase|journal=Journal of structural biology|date=November 2004|volume=148|issue=2|pages=226–35|pmid=15477102[/tpl]

==Structure==

The 3D structure of ChAT has been solved by X-ray crystallography [tpl]PDB|2FY2[/tpl]. Choline is bound in the active site of ChAT by non-covalent interactions between the positively charged amine of choline and the hydroxyl group of Tyr552, in addition to a hydrogen bond between choline's hydroxyl group and a histidine residue, His324.
The choline substrate fits into a pocket in the interior of ChAT, while acetyl-CoA fits into a pocket on the surface of the protein. The 3D crystal structure shows the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA abuts the choline binding pocket – minimizing the distance between acetyl-group donor and receiver.

===Homology===

ChAT is very conserved across the animal genome. Among mammals, in particular, there is very high sequence similarity. Human and cat (Felis catus) ChAT, for example, have 89% sequence identity.
Sequence identity with Drosophila is about 30%.[tpl]cite journal|last=Oda|first=Y|title=Choline acetyltransferase: the structure, distribution and pathologic changes in the central nervous system.|journal=Pathology international|date=November 1999|volume=49|issue=11|pages=921–37|pmid=10594838[/tpl]

==Forms of ChAT==

There are two forms of ChAT: Soluble form& membrane-bound form.[tpl]cite journal|last=Collier|first=B.|title=Effects of Colchicine Application to Preganglionic Axons on Choline Acetyltransferase Activity and Acetylcholine Content and Release in the Superior Cervical Ganglion|journal=Journal of Neurochemistry|date=23 November 2002|volume=66|issue=3|page=1033|doi=10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.66031033.x[/tpl] The soluble form accounts for 80-90% of the total enzyme activity while the membrane-bound form is responsible for the rest of 10-20% activity.[tpl]cite journal|last=Eder-Colli|first=Lorenza|title=Study of subcellular localization of membrane-bound choline acetyltransferase in Drosophila central nervous system and its association with membranes|journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|date=25 May 1998|volume=10|issue=5|page=1644|doi=10.1046/j.1460-9568.1998.00177.x|pmid=9751137[/tpl] However, there has long been a debate on how the latter form of ChAT is bound to the membrane.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hersh|first=LB|title=Studies on detergent released choline acetyltransferase from membrane fractions of rat and human brain.|journal=Neurochem Res|date=December 1987|volume=12|issue=12|page=1059|pmid=2450285[/tpl] Some researchers claim that the membrane-bound form of ChAT is associated with synaptic vesicle[tpl]cite journal|last=Carrol|first=Paul|title=Membrane-bound choline-O-acetyltransferase in rat hippocampal tissue is associated with synaptic vesicles|journal=Brain Research|year=1994|volume=633|issue=1-2|page=112|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(94)91529-6|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006899394915296[/tpl] while the others argue the opposite.

===Common and Peripheral Isoforms of ChAT===

There exist two isoforms of ChAT, both encoded by the same sequence. The common type ChAT (cChAT) is present in both the CNS and PNS. Peripheral type ChAT (pChAT) is preferentially expressed in the PNS in humans, and arises from exon skipping (exons 6-9) during post-transcriptional modification. Therefore, the amino acid sequence is very similar, however pChAT is missing parts of the sequence present in cChAT. The pChAT isoform was discovered in 2000 based on observations that brain-derived ChAT antibodies failed to stain peripheral cholinergic neurons as they do for those found in the brain. This gene splicing mechanism which leads to cChAT and pChAT differences has been observed in various species, including both vertebrate mammals and invertebrate mollusks, suggesting this mechanism leads to some yet-unidentified evolutionary advantage.

==Function==

Cholinergic systems are implicated in numerous neurologic functions. Alteration in some cholinergic neurons may account for the disturbances of Alzheimer disease. The protein encoded by this gene synthesizes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine acts at two classes of receptors in the central nervous system – muscarinic and nicotinic – which are each implicated in different physiological responses. The role of acetylcholine at the nicotinic receptor is still under investigation. It is likely implicated in the reward/reinforcement pathways, as indicated by the addictive nature of nicotine, which also binds to the nicotinic receptor. The muscarinic action of acetylcholine in the CNS is implicated in learning and memory. The loss of cholinergic innervation in the neocortex has been associated with memory loss, as is evidenced in advanced cases of Alzheimer’s disease. In the peripheral nervous system, cholinergic neurons are implicated in the control of visceral functions such as, but not limited to, cardiac muscle contraction and gastrointestinal tract function.
