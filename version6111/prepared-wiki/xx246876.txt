Amy Correia (born September 12, 1968) is an American singer and songwriter who grew up in Lakeville, Ma.CBS News
Correia lived in New York’s Chinatown after graduating from Barnard College. She worked in advertising, writing copy by day, while at night honing her songwriting and performing in clubs like Sin-é Cafe on the lower east side. A chance meeting with Blind Melon guitarist, Christopher Thorn, who’d stopped by the small club while on tour, led the two to make several recordings which helped Correia eventually sign with Virgin Records.
While signed to Virgin Records, Correia recorded an album of songs at Daniel Lanois’ Kingsway Studios in New Orleans with Christopher Thorn producing, but the album went unfinished. Correia left Virgin with her master recordings and signed with Capitol/EMI, which released her debut “Carnival Love” in 2000. Correia recorded the album “Lakeville” with her own money. It was produced by Mark Howard, who also has produced Willie Nelson and Lucinda Williams. The Canadian label, Nettwerk, licensed and released it in 2004.
Her third album, “You Go Your Way”, recorded in 2009 with producer/arranger/bassist Paul Bryan, was funded by her fans. The story was picked up by Anthony Mason for CBS News, who featured Correia as one of a growing number of artists who are looking to their fans rather than a label to fund their albums.
