For the five years the mural existed it was often the centerpiece for national networks cutting to or from games while they were in town for sporting events.
Rockwell International owned the building starting in the mid-1960s and used it as its global headquarters, selling it in early 1972 and consolidating its headquarters staff in the U.S. Steel Tower blocks away.[tpl]cite news | author=Staff writers | title=NA Rockwell Building sold to Galbreath | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hMxRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K20DAAAAIBAJ&dq=rockwell-building&pg=5378%2C503101 | work=The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | page=13 | date=4 February 1972 | accessdate=2 May 2012[/tpl]
For a time, the father of Pittsburgh hockey, some claim of professional hockey, James Wallace Conant was the building manager for the complex.  He also was the longtime manager of the Schenley Park Casino and Duquesne Gardens.
The building was imploded by Controlled Demolition, Inc. on the afternoon of May 25, 1997.
