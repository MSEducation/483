Sellafield is a nuclear reprocessing site, close to the village of Seascale on the coast of the Irish Sea in Cumbria, England. The site is served by Sellafield railway station. Sellafield incorporates the original nuclear reactor site at Windscale, which is currently undergoing decommissioning and dismantling, and Calder Hall, another neighbour of Windscale, which is also undergoing decommissioning and dismantling of its four nuclear power generating reactors.
The total cost of decommissioning, which will be borne by UK taxpayers, is now considered to be in excess of £70 bn.

==Ownership and facilities==

Sellafield was previously owned and operated by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and then, following the division of UKAEA in 1971, British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL). However since 1 April 2005, it has been owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and is now operated by Sellafield Ltd.
In 2008 the NDA contracted the management of Sellafield Ltd to Nuclear Management Partners, a consortium of US company URS, British company AMEC, and AREVA of France. The initial contract is for five years, with extension options to 17 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nuclearmanagementpartners.com/about-company-profile.html|title=NMP Company Profile|publisher=Nuclear Management Partners|accessdate=19 June 2010[/tpl]
Facilities at the site include the THORP nuclear fuel reprocessing plant and the Magnox nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. It is also the site of the remains of Calder Hall,  now being decommissioned, as well as some other older nuclear facilities at Windscale.[tpl]cite book|last=Kragh|first=Helge|title=Quantum Generations: A History of Physics in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton NJ|year=1999|pages=286|isbn=0-691-09552-3[/tpl]
The UK's National Nuclear Laboratory also has its Central Laboratory on the Sellafield site.

==History==

Sellafield was a small rural community situated on the west (Irish Sea) coast of North-West England in the current county of Cumbria (and formerly in the county of Cumberland) in the parish of St Bridget Beckermet between the rivers Calder and Ehen. It consisted of High Sellafield (to the north, and which still exists) and Low Sellafield, which became incorporated in the Sellafield industrial site during the Second World War. The coming of the railway to west Cumberland in the mid-19th century, and the opening of Sellafield station and Sellafield junction (for the branch line to Beckermet and Egremont), provided important transport links for a remote part of England.
The Sellafield industrial site originated in 1942 with the construction of ROF Sellafield, a Second World War Royal Ordnance Factory, which with its sister factory, ROF Drigg, 7 km to the south-east and adjacent to the village of Drigg, produced TNT; TNT production ceased at both factories immediately following the defeat of Japan.[tpl]#tag:ref|Drigg is now the site of the Low Level Waste Repository for nuclear waste. 70% of the waste received at Drigg originates from Sellafield.[tpl]cite journal|last=unattributed|date=25 January 1989|title=BNF shows its rubbish dump|journal=The Journal|publisher=Newcastle Chronicle and Journal Ltd|location=Newcastle upon Tyne, UK|pages=18[/tpl]|group="nb"[/tpl] After the war, the Sellafield site was briefly in the ownership of Courtaulds for development as a factory, but was reacquired by the Ministry of Supply to adapt the site for the production of materials for nuclear weapons, principally plutonium, and construction of the nuclear facilities commenced in September 1947. The site was renamed Windscale (after a bluff on the north bank of the River Calder) to avoid confusion with the Springfields uranium processing factory near Preston. The building of the nuclear plants at Windscale Works was a huge construction project, requiring a peak of 5000 workers. The two air-cooled and open-circuit, graphite-moderated Windscale reactors (the "Windscale Piles") constituted the first British weapons grade plutonium-239 production facility, built for the British nuclear weapons programme of the late 1940s and the 1950s. Windscale Pile No. 1 was operational in October 1950 (just over three years from the start of construction at Sellafield), and Pile No. 2 in June 1951. Windscale was also the site of the prototype British Advanced gas-cooled reactor.
With the creation of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) in 1954, ownership of Windscale Works passed to the UKAEA. The first of four Magnox reactors became operational in 1956 at Calder Hall, adjacent to Windscale and across the River Calder, and the site became Windscale and Calder Works. Following the break-up of the UKAEA into a research division (UKAEA) and a production division, British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) in 1971, the major part of the site was transferred to BNFL. In 1981 BNFL's Windscale and Calder Works was renamed Sellafield as part of a major reorganisation of the site - up to that time there was a General Manager of Windscale Works and a General Manager of Calder Works, but afterwards there was one Head of the entire BNFL Sellafield site - as well as to possibly attempt to disassociate the site from press reports about its safety. The remainder of the site remained in the hands of the UKAEA and was still called Windscale.Cassidy, Nick, and Patrick Green. 1993. Sellafield: The contaminated legacy. London: Friends of the Earth.
Since its inception as a nuclear facility Sellafield has also been host to a number of reprocessing operations, which separate the uranium, plutonium, and fission products from spent nuclear fuel.Openshaw, Stan, Steve Carver, and John Fernie. 1989. Britain’s nuclear waste: Siting and safety. London: Bellhaven Press. The uranium can then be used in the manufacture of new nuclear fuel, or in applications where its density is an asset. The plutonium can be used in the manufacture of mixed oxide fuel (MOX) for thermal reactors, or as fuel for fast breeder reactors, such as the Prototype Fast Reactor at Dounreay. These processes, including the associated cooling ponds, require considerable amounts of water and the licence to extract water from Wast Water, formerly held by BNFL, is now held by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.
On 19 April 2005, leaked radioactive waste was discovered from ThORP (Thermal Oxide reprocessing plant) through a crack into a sump chamber which may have started as early as August 2004, and was categorised as a level 3 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale, resulting in fines.
In February 2009, NuGeneration (NuGen), a consortium of GDF Suez, Iberdrola and Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE), announced plans to build a new nuclear power station of up to 3.6GW capacity at Sellafield. In October 2009, NuGen purchased an option to acquire land around Sellafield from the NDA for £70m.[tpl]cite news |title=Our plans| url=http://www.nugeneration.com/our_plan.html| publisher=NuGeneration[/tpl]
On 18 October 2010 the UK government announced that Sellafield was one of the eight possible sites it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations.[tpl]cite news|title=Nuclear power: Eight sites identified for future plants|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11564152|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 October 2010|date=18 October 2010[/tpl] On 23 June 2011 the government confirmed the suitability of the site, and hoped an electricity generating company would choose to build a power station there by 2025.[tpl]cite news|title=New UK nuclear plant sites named|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13893974|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 June 2011|date=23 June 2011[/tpl]

==Major plants==

===The Windscale Piles===

Following the decision taken by the British government in January 1947 to develop nuclear weapons, Sellafield was chosen as the location of the plutonium production plant, with the initial fuel loading into the Windscale Piles commencing in July 1950.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/94-96/sutyagin/01-03.htm|title=The Role of Nuclear Weapons And Its Possible Future Missions|last=Sutyagin|first=Igor|year=1996|publisher=NATO|pages=I.3.

Unlike the early US nuclear reactors at Hanford, which consisted of a graphite core cooled by water, the Windscale Piles consisted of a graphite core cooled by air. Each pile contained almost 2000 tonnes (1,968 L/T) of graphite, and measured over 7.3 metres (24 ft) high by 15.2 metres (50 ft) in diameter. Fuel for the reactor consisted of rods of uranium metal, approximately 30 centimetres (12 in) long by 2.5 centimetres (1 in) in diameter, and clad in aluminium.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/267995/Getting+to+the+core+issue.htm|title=Getting to the core issue|author=George Coupe|date=14 May 2004|publisher=The Engineer|accessdate=23 October 2008[/tpl]

====The Windscale fire====

The Windscale Piles were shut down following a fire in Pile 1 on 10 October 1957 which destroyed the core and released an estimated 750  terabecquerels (20,000 curies) of radioactive material into the surrounding environment, including 22 TBq of Cs-137 and 740 TBq of iodine-131Chris Busby, Wings of Death (1995) p.89 which is taken up in the human body by the thyroid. As a precautionary measure, milk from surrounding farming areas was destroyed. Following the fire, Pile 1 was unserviceable, and Pile 2, although undamaged by the fire, was shut down as a precaution, by which time UK had enough plutonium for some atomic bombs and work was progressing well at the Fast Breeder Reactor at Dounreay.
In the 1990s, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority started to implement plans to decommission, disassemble and clean up both piles; the decommissioning is now partially complete. In 2004 Pile 1 still contained about 15 tonnes (14.76 L/T) of uranium fuel, and final completion of the decommissioning is not expected until at least 2037.

===The first generation reprocessing plant===

The first generation reprocessing plant was built to extract the plutonium from spent fuel to provide fissile material for the UK's atomic weapons programme, and for exchange with the United States through the US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement. It operated from 1951 until 1964, with an annual capacity of 300 tonnes (295 L/T) of fuel, or 750 tonnes (738 L/T) of low burn-up fuel. Following the commissioning of the Magnox reprocessing plant, it was itself recycled to become a pre-handling plant to allow oxide fuel to be reprocessed in the Magnox plant, and was closed in 1973.
As of 2014, the First Generation Magnox Storage Pond (FGMSP) remains as a priority decommissioning project. As well as nuclear waste, the pond holds about 1,200 cubic meters of radioactive sludge of unknown characteristics and 14,000 cubic meters of contaminated water.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/features/featurethe-cold-probe-4163473/ |title=The cold probe for sampling at Sellafield |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=22 January 2014 |accessdate=8 February 2014[/tpl]

In its early life Calder Hall primarily produced weapons-grade plutonium, with two fuel loads per year; electricity production was a secondary purpose.[tpl]cite web | title=Should the United States supply light water reactors to Pyongyang? | author=Peter Hayes | work=Nautilus Pacific Research | url=http://www.nautilus.org/archives/pub/ftp/napsnet/papers/hayes1193.txt| accessdate=21 August 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060307121518/http://www.nautilus.org/archives/pub/ftp/napsnet/papers/hayes1193.txt  |archivedate = 7 March 2006[/tpl] From 1964 it was mainly used on commercial fuel cycles; in April 1995 the UK Government announced that all production of plutonium for weapons purposes had ceased.

====Cooling towers====

Calder Hall had four cooling towers, built in 1950–1956 to cool the water from the station. The towers were 88 metres in height and used the natural draught hyperboloid design. The towers stood for 50 years, creating a landmark visible from the village of Seascale. Conflict arose over renovating Calder Hall and preserving the towers, but costs effectively defeated all attempts to do so.
Demolition
The four cooling towers were demolished by controlled implosions on Saturday 29 September 2007, by Controlled Demolition Inc. A period of 12 weeks was required to remove asbestos in the towers' rubble.[tpl]cite news | title=Sellafield towers are demolished| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cumbria/7019414.stm| accessdate=29 September 2007 | work=BBC News | date=29 September 2007[/tpl]

===Windscale Advanced Gas Cooled Reactor (WAGR)===

The Windscale Advanced Gas Cooled Reactor (WAGR)[tpl]cite web | title=Project WAGR | work=Project WAGR | url=http://www.sellafieldsites.com/what-we-do/featured-projects/wagr[/tpl] was a prototype for the UK's second generation of reactors, the advanced gas-cooled reactor or AGR, which followed on from the Magnox stations. The WAGR golfball is, along with the pile chimneys, one of the iconic buildings on the Windscale site (Windscale being an independent site within the Sellafield complex). Construction was carried out by Mitchell Construction and completed in 1962.Indictment: Power & Politics in the Construction Industry, David Morrell, Faber & Faber, 1987, ISBN 978-0-571-14985-8 This reactor was shut down in 1981, and is now part of a pilot project to demonstrate techniques for safely decommissioning a nuclear reactor.

===Magnox reprocessing plant===

In 1964 the Magnox reprocessing plant came on stream to reprocess spent nuclear fuel from the Magnox reactors.[tpl]cite web | title=History of Sellafield| work=Sellafield Web Page | url=http://www.sellafield.com/content.php?pageID=112&decade=1960| accessdate=21 August 2006[/tpl] The plant uses the "plutonium uranium extraction" Purex method for reprocessing spent fuel, with tributyl phosphate as an extraction agent. The Purex process produces uranium, plutonium and fission products as output streams. Over the 30 years from 1971 to 2001 B205 has reprocessed over 35,000 tonnes of Magnox fuel, with 15,000 tonnes of fuel being regenerated.[tpl]cite web | title=Continued discharges from Sellafield for ten more years| work=Bellona | url=http://bellona.no/bellona.org/english_import_area/energy/nuclear/sellafield/25306| accessdate=21 August 2006[/tpl] Magnox fuel is reprocessed since it corrodes if stored underwater, and routes for dry storage have not yet been proven.[tpl]cite web | title=RWMAC's Advice to Ministers on the Radioactive Waste Implications of Reprocessing | work=RWMAC | url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rwmac/reports/reprocess/16.htm | accessdate=21 August 2006[/tpl]

===Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant===

Between 1977 and 1978 an inquiry was held into an application by BNFL for outline planning permission to build a new plant to reprocess irradiated oxide nuclear fuel from both UK and foreign reactors. The inquiry was used to answer three questions:
 "1. Should oxide fuel from United Kingdom reactors be reprocessed in this country at all; whether at Windscale or elsewhere?
2. If yes, should such reprocessing be carried on at Windscale?
3. If yes, should the reprocessing plant be about double the estimated site required to handle United Kingdom oxide fuels and be used as to the spare capacity, for reprocessing foreign fuels?"[tpl]cite web | title=Windscale Inquiry | work=BOPCRIS – Unlocking Key British Government Publications | url=http://www.bopcris.ac.uk/bopall/ref17576.html | accessdate=21 August 2006[/tpl] The result of the inquiry was that the new plant, the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp) was given the go ahead in 1978, although it did not go into operation until 1994.

====2005 Thorp plant leak====

On 19 April 2005 83,000 litres of radioactive waste was discovered to have leaked in the Thorp reprocessing plant from a cracked pipe into a huge stainless steel-lined concrete sump chamber built to contain leaks.
A discrepancy between the amount of material entering and exiting the Thorp processing system had first been noted in August 2004. Operations staff, however, did not discover the leak until safeguards staff reported the discrepancies. Some 19 tonnes of uranium and 160 kilograms of plutonium dissolved in nitric acid has been pumped from the sump vessel into a holding tank.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/periodic-safety-review/thorp.htm|title=Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP) leak investigation and consent to restart|author=Nuclear Directorate|publisher=Health and Safety Executive|accessdate=9 June 2012[/tpl]
No radiation was released to the environment, and no one was injured by the incident, but because of the large escape of radioactivity to the secondary containment the incident was given an International Nuclear Event Scale level 3 cold blue categorisation. Sellafield Limited was fined £500,000 for breaching health and safety law. In January 2007 Sellafield was given consent to restart THORP.

===Highly Active Liquor Evaporation and Storage===

Highly Active Liquor Evaporation and Storage (HALES) is a department at Sellafield. It conditions nuclear waste streams from the Magnox and Thorp reprocessing plants, prior to transfer to the Waste Vitrification Plant.

===The vitrification plant===

In 1991 the Waste Vitrification Plant (WVP), which seals high-level radioactive waste in glass, was opened. In this plant, liquid wastes are mixed with glass and melted in a furnace, which when cooled forms a solid block of glass.
The plant has three process lines and is based on the French AVM procedure. Principal item is an inductively heated melting furnace, in which the calcined waste is merged with glass frit (glass beads of 1 to 2 mm in diameter). The melt is placed into waste containers, which are welded shut, their outsides decontaminated and then brought into air-cooled storage facilities. This storage consists of 800 vertical storage tubes, each capable of storing ten containers. The total storage capacity is 8000 containers, and 5000 containers have been stored to 2010.
Vitrification should ensure safe storage of waste in the UK for the middle to long term.

===The Sellafield MOX Plant===

Construction of the Sellafield MOX Plant (SMP) was completed in 1997, though justification for the operation of the plant was not achieved until October 2001.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080222/text/80222w0002.htm#column_1034W|title=Hansard, Written Answers: Sellafield|author=Malcolm Wicks|publisher="Hansard|id=22 February 2008 : Column 1034W|date=22 February 2008|accessdate=12 March 2008|format= – Scholar search|postscript=[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=June 2008[/tpl] Mixed oxide, or MOX fuel, is a blend of plutonium and natural uranium or depleted uranium which behaves similarly (though not identically) to the enriched uranium feed for which most nuclear reactors were designed. MOX fuel is an alternative to low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel used in the light water reactors which predominate in nuclear power generation. MOX also provides a means of using excess weapons-grade plutonium (from military sources) to produce electricity.
Designed with a plant capacity of 120 tonnes/year, it achieved a total output of only 5 tonnes during its first five years of operation.

===Enhanced Actinide Removal Plant===

Since its early days, Sellafield has discharged low-level radioactive waste into the sea, using a flocculation process to remove radioactivity from liquid effluent before discharge. Metals dissolved in acidic effluents produced a metal hydroxide flocculant precipitate following the addition of ammonium hydroxide. The suspension was then transferred to settling tanks where the precipitate would settle out, and the remaining clarified liquid, or supernate, would be discharged to the Irish Sea. In 1994 the Enhanced Actinide Removal Plant (EARP) was opened. In EARP the effectiveness of the process is enhanced by the addition of reagents to remove the remaining soluble radioactive species. EARP was enhanced in 2004 to further reduce the quantities of Technetium-99 released to the environment.[tpl]cite web | title=Treating a 50-year-old legacy of radioactive sludge waste | author=Ben Irons | work=Engineer Live | url=http://www.engineerlive.com/power-engineer/nuclear-power/14432/treating-a-50yearold-legacy-of-radioactive-sludge-waste.thtml | accessdate=21 August 2006[/tpl]

===Radioactive waste stores===

Sellafield has a number of radioactive waste stores, mostly on an interim basis while a national waste repository plan is developed and implemented.

===Fellside Power Station===

Fellside Power Station is a 168 MWe CHP gas-fired power station near the Sellafield site, which it supplies with steam and heat. It is run as Fellside Heat and Power Ltd, is wholly owned by Sellafield Ltd and is operated & managed by PX Ltd. It was built in 1993, being originally equally owned by BNFL and Scottish Hydro Electric (which became Scottish and Southern Energy in December 1998). The station uses three General Electric Frame 6001B gas turbines, with power entering the National Grid via a 132kV transformer. BNFL bought SSE's 50% share in January 2002.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/About%20us/enforcement/mergers/oft/Documents1/mergersandaquisitions%2050.pdf|format=PDF|title=British Nuclear Fuels plc’s completed acquisition of Fellside Heat and Power Limited|date=March 2002|publisher=OFGEM|accessdate=8 December 2008|postscript=[/tpl]

==Central Laboratory – National Nuclear Laboratory headquarters==

The Central Laboratory at Sellafield is the headquarters of the National Nuclear Laboratory and is the flagship nuclear Research and Development facility in the UK. It supports new reactor build, operation of reactors, operations of fuel processing plants and decommissioning and clean-up. The NNL's Central Laboratory is available to run a wide range of radioactive and non-radioactive experimental programmes. In addition, it offers a wide range of analytical services, building on its location on the Sellafield site and considerable expertise of its resident technologists. Customers range from Government and the NDA to site licence companies, utilities, nuclear specialists and universities. The facility has been designed with flexibility and collaboration firmly at its heart. Smaller experiments can be easily set, taking advantage of the modular nature of the laboratories. Larger experiments and rigs can be assembled off site, installed and pre-tested in non-radioactive areas prior to active testing.

==Sellafield Centre – Business and Information Centre==

Formerly the Sellafield Visitors' Centre, it is now the Business and Information Centre and is open Mon – Fri only. The centre is used for business events such as supplier forums and 'Meet the Buyer' events. Unfortunately The Sellafield Visitors Centre is completely closed, and there are no areas for the public to visit. (information confirmed by Sellafield 4 July 2012).
At its peak, the Visitors' Centre attracted an average of 1,000 people per day. In recent years, its popularity has deteriorated, prompting the change from tourist attraction to conference facility.

==Radiological releases==

Between 1950 and 2000 there were 21 serious incidents or accidents involving some off-site radiological releases that warranted a rating on the International Nuclear Event Scale, one at level 5, five at level 4 and fifteen at level 3. Additionally during the 1950s and 1960s there were protracted periods of known, deliberate, discharges to the atmosphere of plutonium and irradiated uranium oxide particulates.[tpl]cite journal | author=G A M Webb | title=Classification of events with an off-site radiological impact at the Sellafield site between 1950 and 2000, using the International Nuclear Event Scale | journal=Journal of Radiological Protection | volume=26 |date=March 2006 | url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0952-4746/26/1/002 | doi=10.1088/0952-4746/26/1/002 | pages=33–49 | pmid=16522943 | issue=1|bibcode = 2006JRP....26...33W | author-separator=, | display-authors=1 [/tpl] These frequent incidents, together with the large 2005 Thorp plant leak which was not detected for nine months, have led some to doubt the effectiveness of the managerial processes and safety culture on the site over the years.
In the effort to build an independent British nuclear weapon in the 1940s and 1950s, the Sellafield plant was constructed; diluted radioactive waste was discharged by pipeline into the Irish Sea.C.Michael Hogan. 2011. Irish Sea. eds. P.Saundry & C.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC Greenpeace claims that the Irish Sea remains one of the most heavily contaminated seas in the world because of these discharges.Sellafield nuclear reprocessing facility | Greenpeace UK However, Ocean scientist David Assinger has challenged this general suggestion, and cites the Dead Sea as the most radioactive sea in the world.http://www.challenger-society.org.uk/node/95 The Irish Sea: Not the Most Radioactive Sea in the World. The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR Convention) reports an estimated 200 kilograms (441 lb) of plutonium has been deposited in the marine sediments of the Irish Sea.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.ospar.org/eng/doc/pdfs/R3C4.pdf| title = Quality Status Report 2000 for the North East-Atlantic (Regional QSR III, Chapter 4 Chemistry, p66 | accessdate =3 June 2007| publisher =OSPAR Commission |format=PDF[/tpl] Cattle and fish in the area have been contaminated with plutonium-239 and caesium-137 from these sediments and from other sources such as the radioactive rain that fell on the area after the Chernobyl disaster. Most of the area's long-lived radioactive technetium comes from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at the Sellafield facility.[tpl]cite web | title=Technetium-99 Behavior in the Terrestrial Environment – Field Observations and Radiotracer Experiments-| work=Journal of Nuclear and Radiochemical Sciences, Vol. 4, No.1, pp. A1-A8, 2003 | url=http://www.radiochem.org/paper/JN41/j041Tagami.pdf| accessdate=23 August 2006|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060724180943/http://www.radiochem.org/paper/JN41/j041Tagami.pdf  |archivedate = 24 July 2006[/tpl]
Technetium-99 is a radioactive element which is produced by nuclear fuel reprocessing, and also as a by-product of medical facilities (for example Ireland is responsible for the discharge of approximately 11 grams or 6.78 gigabecquerels of technetium-99 each year despite not having a nuclear industry).[tpl]cite web | title=Report of Ireland on the Implementation of the OSPAR Strategy with regard to Radioactive Substances (June 2001) | work=Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government | url=http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/EnvironmentalRadiation/FileDownLoad,1336,en.pdf| accessdate=4 April 2008| pages= 2 para.9|format=PDF[/tpl]
Because it is almost uniquely produced by nuclear fuel reprocessing, technetium-99 is an important element as part of the OSPAR Convention since it provides a good tracer for discharges into the sea.
In itself, the technetium discharges do not represent a significant radiological hazard,[tpl]cite web | title= News Release: MINISTERS ANNOUNCE DECISION ON TECHNETIUM-99 | work=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs | url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2002/021211a.htm| accessdate=23 August 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060912002338/http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2002/021211a.htm  |archivedate = 12 September 2006[/tpl] and recent studies have noted "...that in the most recently reported dose estimates for the most exposed Sellafield group of seafood consumers (FSA/SEPA 2000), the contributions from technetium-99 and actinide nuclides from Sellafield (Discharges into the sea of radioactive effluents – mainly caesium-137 – from Sellafield amounted to 5200 TBq during the peak year, 1975.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.environment.no/Goals-and-indicators/Goals-and-indicators/Radioactive-pollution/Limit-radiation/Releases-of-technetium-99-and-caesium-137-from-Sellafield/--Releases-of-caesium-137-from-Sellafield-/ |title=State of the Environment Norway : Releases of caesium-137 from Sellafield |date=20 November 2011 |publisher=Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl]
There has been concern that the Sellafield area will become a major dumping ground for unwanted nuclear material, since there are currently no long-term facilities for storing High-Level Waste (HLW), although the UK has current contracts to reprocess spent fuel from all over the world. However, contracts agreed since 1976 between BNFL and overseas customers require that all HLW be returned to the country of origin. The UK retains low- and intermediate-level waste resulting from its reprocessing activity, and instead ships out a radiologically equivalent amount of its own HLW. This substitution policy is intended to be environmentally neutral and to speed return of overseas material by reducing the number of shipments required, since HLW is far less bulky.[tpl]cite web | title=INTERMEDIATE LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE SUBSTITUTION | work=DTI | url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file30058.pdf | accessdate=23 August 2006|format=PDF[/tpl]
1983 was the year of the "Beach Discharge Incident" in which high radioactive discharges containing ruthenium and rhodium 106, both beta-emitting isotopes, resulted in the closure of beaches along a 10-mile stretch of coast between St. Bees and Eskmeals, along with warnings against swimming in the sea.[tpl]cite journal|last=Morris|first=Michael|date=18 February 1984|title=Warnings go up on nuclear site beaches|journal=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Newspapers|location=UK|pages=3[/tpl]

===B30===

Building B30, colloquially known as dirty thirty, is a pond which was used to store spent fuel from MAGNOX power stations. The pond is 20 m wide, 150 m long and 6 m deep. Birds can land on its surface and take small amounts of radioactive substances with them. The pond was used from 1960 until 1986. A confinement wall is scheduled to be built in the future to help it withstand earthquakes. The pool is to be emptied and dismantled in years to come.
It is impossible to determine exactly how much radioactive waste is stored in B30; algae is forming in the pool, making visual examinations difficult. British authorities have not been able to provide the Euratom inspectors with precise data. The European Commission has thus sued Great Britain in the European Court of Justice.EUROPA - PRESS RELEASES - Press release - Nuclear safeguards: the Commission imposes binding measures to put an end to an infringement at the Sellafield site in the United Kin...Windscale, une passoire nucléaire rebaptisée Sellafield According to Greenpeace there is an expected 1300 kg of plutonium, 400 kg of which is in mud sediments.http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/files/pdfs/migrated/MultimediaFiles/Live/FullReport/6268.pdf It is thought the pool also contains waste from the Tokai Mura plant (Japan).NucNews - July 13, 2003
Radiation around the pool can get so high that a person is not allowed to stay more than 2 minutes, seriously affecting decommissioning.BBC - Cumbria - Places - So what the heck is this Sellafield thing all about? The pool is not watertight; time and weather have created cracks in the concrete, letting contaminated water leak.Plutonium Investigation

In 2007 an inquiry was launched into the removal of tissue from a total of 65 deceased nuclear workers, some of whom worked at Sellafield.[tpl]cite news |title=Sellafield organ removal inquiry |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6565409.stm | date=18 April 2007 |accessdate=18 May 2007[/tpl] It has been alleged that the tissue was removed without seeking permission from the relatives of the late workers. Michael Redfern QC has been appointed to lead the investigation.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/jul/10/health.nuclearindustry |title=Sellafield body parts scandal |last=Walker |first=Peter |date=10 July 2007 |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=25 September 2008[/tpl] At the same time The Observer revealed that official documents showed that during the 1960s volunteer workers at Sellafield had participated in secret Cold War experiments to assess the biological effect of exposure to radioactive substances, such as from ingesting caesium-134.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/apr/22/nuclear.world |title=Revealed: UK nuclear tests on workers |last=Doward |first=Jamie |date=22 April 2007 |work=The Observer |location=London |accessdate=17 November 2010[/tpl]

Sellafield staff did not breach any legal obligation, did not consider their actions untoward, and published the scientific information obtained in peer-reviewed scientific journals. It was the hospital pathologists, who were profoundly ignorant of the law, who breached the Human Tissue Act 1961 by giving Sellafield human organs, without any consents, under an informal arrangement.

===Health studies on Cumbria and Seascale===

In 1983, the Medical Officer of West Cumbria, is said by Paul Foot to have announced that cancer fatality rates were lower around the nuclear plant than elsewhere in Great Britain.Foot, Paul, London Review of Books, "Nuclear Nightmares", August 1988 In the early 1990s, concern was raised in the UK about apparent clusters of leukaemia near nuclear facilities.
A 1997 Ministry of Health report stated that children living close to Sellafield had twice as much[tpl]quantify|date=May 2013[/tpl] plutonium in their teeth as children living more than [tpl]convert|100|mi|km[/tpl] away. Health Minister Melanie Johnson said the quantities were minute and "presented no risk to public health".  This claim, according to a book written by Stephanie Cooke, was challenged by Professor Eric Wright, an expert on blood disorders at the University of Dundee, who said that even microscopic amounts of the man-made element might cause cancer.Stephanie Cooke (2009). In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age, Black Inc., p. 356.
Studies carried out by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) in 2003 reported no evidence of raised childhood cancer in general around nuclear power plants, but did report an excess of leukaemia (cancer of the blood or bone) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (blood cancer) near two other nuclear installations including Sellafield, the Atomic Weapons Establishment Burghfield and UKAEA Dounreay.
COMARE's conclusion was that "the excesses around Sellafield and Dounreay are unlikely to be due to chance, although there is not at present a convincing explanation for them".[tpl]cite web | title=COMARE 10th Report: The incidence of childhood cancer around nuclear installations in Great Britain | work=Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment | url=http://www.comare.org.uk/press_releases/comare_pr10.htm | accessdate=25 August 2006[/tpl] In earlier reports COMARE had suggested that "..no single factor could account for the excess of leukaemia and NHL but that a mechanism involving infection may be a significant factor affecting the risk of leukaemia and NHL in young people in Seascale."[tpl]cite web | title=Summary of the work of COMARE as published in its first six reports | work=Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment | url=http://www.comare.org.uk/documents/COMARE1-6reports.pdf| accessdate=25 August 2006|format=PDF[/tpl]
In a study published in the British Journal of Cancer, which also did not find an increase in any other cancers other than Leukemia, the authors of which attempted to quantify the effect population mixing might have on the Seascale leukaemia cluster. In the analysis of childhood leukaemia/NHL in Cumbria, excluding Seascale, they noted that if both parents were born outside the Cumbrian area (incomers), there was a significantly higher rate of leukaemia/NHL in their children. 1181 children were born in the village of Seascale between 1950 and 1989, in children aged 1–14 during this period, the Seascale cluster of 6 observed cases of NHL were noted. Two similarly aged children, born between 1950 and 1989, outside Seascale(in greater Cumbria) were also diagnosed with ALL/NHL before the end of 1992. The origin of birth of 11 of the 16 parents of these eight children was known, and found to be; 3 had parents born outside Cumbria and 3 had one parent born outside the UK. The studies authors strongly supported the hypothesis that the risk of ALL/NHL, in particular in the younger age group, increases with increased exposure to population mixing during gestation or early in life. Although they determined that the exact mechanism by which it causes these malignancies, apart from Kinlen's infection aetiology[ref]LJ Kinlen. Infection and childhood leukaemia near nuclear sites.

In an examination of all causes of stillbirth and infant mortality in Cumbria taken as a whole, between 1950 and 1993, 4,325 stillbirths, 3,430 neonatal death and 1,569 lethal congenital anomalies, occurred among 287,993 births. Overall, results did not infer an increased risk of still birth or neonatal death in Cumbria, with the rate of these negative outcomes being in line with the British baseline rate. With a cautioned connection between a small excess of increased risk of death from lethal congenital anomalies and proximity to municipal waste incinerators and chemical waste crematoriums being noted. With two examples of the latter crematoriums operating in both Barrow-in-Furness and further afield at Carlisle, crematoriums which may have emitted various chemical dioxins during their operation.Adverse pregnancy outcomes around incinerators and crematoriums in Cumbria, north west England, 1956–93 J Epidemiol Community Health 2003;57:456-461 doi:10.1136/jech.57.6.456
