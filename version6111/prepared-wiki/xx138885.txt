Plunkett's brother Colm also played for Tyrone. He is a second cousin to two-time All Star winning former Derry footballer Joe Brolly. His mother Maisie was a first cousin of Brolly's mother Ann, Maisie's mother Bridget and Brolly's grandfather Joe, being sister and brother. He is also cousin to Monaghan Defender/Forward Vincent Corey.

==Career==

Donaghy was part of the Tyrone team that went to their first All Ireland Final in 1986, against Kerry, and won an All Star Award for his contributions. He captained Tyrone to a further Ulster Championship success in 1989. He also played for Ireland against Australia.

===Legacy===

His playing abilities, being part of the first (relatively) successful Tyrone team, put him among the greats of Tyrone football. Donaghy was known for his great ability to catch a ball, and he was instantly recognisable on the pitch due to his "shaggy" blond hair. Donaghy stands at 6Â ft tall.http://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/gaa/extra/mhgbojqlqloj/
