==History==

"Loose Parts" began on 1999 as a collaborative effort between Dave Blazek (the writer) and John Gilpin (the illustrator). Both men worked in the marketing department at The Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News. In 2001 Gilpin stopped drawing for the single-panel cartoon and Blazek took up those duties as well; he now writes and draws for the cartoon.loosepartscomic.com
