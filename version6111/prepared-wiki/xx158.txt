It is one of the most significant Victorian era boomtowns in Australia. Just months after Victoria was granted separation from New South Wales, the Victorian gold rush transformed Ballarat from a small sheep station to a major settlement. Gold was discovered at Poverty Point on 18 August 1851 and news quickly spread of rich alluvial fields where gold could easily be extracted. Within months, approximately 20,000 migrants had rushed the district.[tpl]cite news | title = Victoria - Mount Alexander | date = 11 December 1852 | work = Sydney Morning Herald | page = 2 | accessdate =6 May 2012 | url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/12942220[/tpl] Several Australian mining innovations were made at the Ballarat diggings including the first use of a Chilean mill in 1851 and the first use of a mine cage in 1861.Davey, Christopher.

The Eureka Rebellion began in Ballarat and the only armed rebellion in Australian history, the Battle of Eureka Stockade, took place on 3 December 1854. In response to the event the first male suffrage in Australia  was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of democracy in Australia. The gold rush and boom gave birth in many other significant cultural legacies. The rebellion's symbol, the Eureka Flag has become a national symbol and is held at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka in Ballarat.

Proclaimed a city in 1871, its prosperity continued until late in the 19th century, after which its importance relative to both Melbourne and Geelong rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction. It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the 1956 Summer Olympics. It is the commercial capital of the Central Highlands and the largest city in the Goldfields region of Victoria—a significant tourist destination. Ballarat is known for its history, culture and its well preserved Victorian era heritage.

==History==

===Prehistory and European settlement===

Prior to the European settlement of Australia, the Ballarat region was populated by the Wathaurong people, an Indigenous Australian people.[tpl]cite web|title=Ballarat’s Indigenous Heritage|url=http://sheducationcom.ascetinteractive.biz/uploads//SovHill%20indigenousheritage%20notes%20ss1.pdf|work=Sovereign Hill Education|accessdate=19 August 2010[/tpl]  The Boro gundidj tribe's territory was based along the Yarrowee River.
The first Europeans to sight the area were an 1837 party of six mostly Scottish squatters from Geelong led by Somerville Learmonth who were in search of land less affected by the severe drought for their sheep to graze. The party scaled Mount Buninyong, among them were Somerville's brother Thomas Livingstone Learmonth, William Cross Yuille and Henry Anderson all three of which later claimed land in what is now Ballarat.
The Yuille family, Scottish settlers Archibald Buchanan Yuille and his brother William Cross Yuille arrived in 1837 and squatted a [tpl]convert|10000|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] sheep run. The first houses were built near Woolshed Creek by William Yuille and Anderson (Sebastopol), while Yuille erected a hut Black Swamp (Lake Wendouree) in 1838. Outsiders originally knew of the settlement as Yuille's Station and Yuille's Swamp. Archibald Yuille named the area "Ballaarat" which it is thought he derived from local Wathaurong Aboriginal words for the area, balla arat. The meaning of this word is not certain, however several translations have been made and it is generally thought to mean 'resting place'. In some dialects, balla means "bent elbow" which is translated to mean reclining or resting and arat meaning "place".

===1850s: Gold rush===

The first publicised discovery of gold in the region was by Thomas Hiscock in 2 August 1851 in the Buninyong region to the south.Griffiths Peter M, "Three Times Blest A History of Buninyong 1837–1901", Ballarat Historical Society pp13 The find brought other prospectors to the area and on 19 August 1851, John Dunlop and James Regan struck gold at Poverty Point with a few ounces.[tpl]cite news | title = Victoria | date = 5 November 1851 | work = The Courier | page = 2[/tpl] Within days of the announcement of Dunlop and Regan's find, a gold rush began, bringing thousands of prospectors to the Yarrowee valley which became known as the Ballarat diggings. Yields were particularly high with the first prospectors in the area extracting between half-an-ounceBallarat Diggings: From the Correspondent of the Geelong Advertiser. pg 2. The Argus. 13 September 1851 (which was more than the average wage of the time) and up to five ounces of alluvial gold per day. As news of the Australian gold rushes reached the world, Ballarat gained an international reputation as a particularly rich goldfield. As a result, a huge influx of immigrants occurred, including many from Ireland and China, gathering in a collection of prospecting shanty towns around the creeks and hills. In just a few months, numerous alluvial runs were established, several deep mining leads began, and the population had swelled to over 20,000 people.
The first Post Office opened on 1 November 1851. It was the first Victorian post office to open in a gold-mining settlement.[tpl]cite web| last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&country= | accessdate =11 April 2008| postscript =  [/tpl]  Parts of the district were first surveyed by William Urquhart as early as October 1851.[tpl]cite web|last=James|first=Ken|title=The surveying career of William Swan Urquhart, 1845–1864|url=http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/provenance/no8/SurveyingCareer1.asp|work=Public Record Office Victoria|publisher=Government of Victoria|accessdate=19 August 2010|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20091027064407/http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/provenance/no8/SurveyingCareer1.asp |archivedate = 27 October 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl] By 1852 his grid plan and wide streets for land sales in the new township of West Ballarat[tpl]cite book | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = Wendy | last2 = Nigel | first2 = Lewis | last3 = Elizabeth | first3 = Vines | last4 = Richard | first4 = Aitken | title = Ballarat: A Guide to Buildings and Areas 1851–1940 | publisher = Jacobs Lewis Vines Architects and Conservation Planners | year = 1981 | page = 11 | isbn = 0-9593970-0-0[/tpl] built upon a plateau of basalt contrasted markedly with the existing narrow unplanned streets, tents and gullies of the original East Ballarat settlement. The new town's main streets of the time were named in honour of police commissioners and gold commissioners of the time, with the main street, Sturt Street named after Evelyn Pitfield Shirley Sturt, Dana Street named after Henry Dana and Lydiard Street after his assistant, Doveton Street after Francis Crossman Doveton (Ballarat's first gold commissioner), Armstrong after David Armstrong and Mair Street after William Mair.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/503270/his%20report%2020%20oct%202011.pdf | title = Heritage Impact Statement - Civic Hall | accessdate =14 May 2012 | date = October 2011 | work = City of Ballarat | publisher = City of Ballarat[/tpl]  These officials were based at the government encampment (after which nearby Camp Street was named,) which was strategically positioned on an escarpment with an optimal view over the district's diggings.
The first newspaper, The Banner, published on 11 September 1853, was one of many to be distributed during the gold-rush period. Print media played a large role in the early history of the settlement.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Cornfield | first1 = Jason | last2 = Wickham | first2 = Dorothy | last3 = Gervasoni | first3 = Clare | title = The Eureka Encyclopedia | publisher = Ballarat Heritage Services | year = 2004 | page = 391 | isbn = 1-876478-61-6[/tpl] Ballarat attracted a sizable number of miners from the Californian 1848 gold rush and some were known as Ballafornians.K. T-. Livingston, Richard Jordan, Gay Sweely (2001) Becoming Australians: the movement towards federation in Ballarat and the nation p.34. Wakefield Press
Civil disobedience in Ballarat led to Australia's only armed civil uprising, the Eureka Rebellion (colloquially referred to as the Eureka Stockade) which took place in Ballarat on 3 December 1854. The event, in which 22 miners died, is considered to be a defining moment in Australian history.
The city earned the nickname "The Golden City" in the 1850s.Perkin, Corrie Golden city of Ballarat comes into the picture The Australian 1 September 2009 The gold rush population peaked at almost 60,000, mostly male diggers, by 1858.[tpl]cite news | title = Gold Rush Population Peak 1858-9-23 | date = 23 September 1858 | work = The Star | page = 2 | accessdate =6 May 2012 | url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/page/6460448?zoomLevel=1[/tpl]  However the early population was largely itinerant. As quickly as the alluvial deposits drew prospectors to Ballarat, the rate of gold extraction fluctuated and, as they were rapidly worked dry, many quickly moved to rush other fields as new findings were announced, particularly Mount Alexander in 1852, Fiery Creek[tpl]cite news | title = Colonial News, Victoria | date = 3 November 1855 | work = The Maitland Mercury & Hunter River General Advertiser | page = 3 | accessdate =6 May 2012 | url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/page/129327?zoomLevel=1[/tpl] in 1855, Ararat in 1857. By 1859, a smaller number of permanent settlers numbering around 23,000,[tpl]cite news | title = Summary for Europe - Introduction | date = 20 August 1860 | work = The Argus | page = 5[/tpl] many of whom had built personal wealth in gold, established a prosperous economy based around a shift to deep underground gold mining.
Confidence of the city's early citizens in the enduring future of their city is evident in the sheer scale of many of the early public buildings, generous public recreational spaces, and opulence of many of its commercial establishments and private housing. A local steam locomotive industry developed from 1854 with the Phoenix Foundry operating until 1906.[tpl]cite book |last1=Butrims |first1=Robert |last2=Macartney |first2=David |title=The Phoenix Foundry: Locomotive Builders of Ballarat |publisher=Australian Railway History Society | year=2013 |isbn=978-0-646-90402-3[/tpl] The railway came to the town with the opening of the Geelong-Ballarat line in 1862, and Ballarat developed as a major railway town. As the city grew, the region's original indigenous inhabitants were quickly expelled to the fringe and, by 1867, few at all remained.

===Victorian city===

From the late 1860s to the early 20th century, Ballarat made a successful transition from a gold rush town to an industrial-age city. The ramshackle tents and timber buildings gradually made way for permanent buildings, many impressive structures of solid stone and brick mainly built from wealth generated by early mining.
Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh visited between 9 and 13 December 1867 and, as the first royal visit, the occasion was met with great fanfare.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Clarke | first1 = Jan | title = Speak Out Boldly: The first 125 years of the Ballarat Courier | publisher = The Courier | year = 1992 | location = Ballarat | page = 12 | isbn =978-0-646-09971-2[/tpl] The Prince Room was prepared at Craigs Royal Hotel for his stay.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.craigsroyal.com.au/accommodation/Video/history/ | title = Craig's Royal Hotel - History | accessdate =30 June 2012 | publisher = craigsroyal.com.au[/tpl] The city's first civic centre—Prince Alfred Hall—erected over the Yarrowee between the two municipalities, was named in his honour during his visit. The later attempt of the Prince's assassination by Ballaratian Henry James O'Farrell was met with shock and great horror from locals.
Ballarat was proclaimed a city in 1871. Gong Gong reservoir was built in 1877 to alleviate flooding and to provide a permanent water supply. A direct railway to Melbourne was completed in December 1889.  Many industries and workshops had been established as a result of manufacturing and servicing for the deep lead mining industry.
Local boosterists at the start of the 20th century adopted the nickname "Athens of Australia", first used to describe the city by the prestigious Irish-Australian jurist and politician of the early 20th century Sir John Madden.THE ATHENS OF AUSTRALIA, Poverty Bay Herald, Volume XXXVI, Issue 11988, 3 November 1909, p. 7 Papers Past — Poverty Bay Herald — 3 November 1909 — "THE ATHENS OF AUSTRALIA."Douglas Pike, Geoffrey Serle : Australian dictionary of biography, Vol. 9, Melbourne University Press, 1983Frederic C.

The first electricity supply was completed in 1901 by the Electric Supply Company of Victoria.

===Declining fortunes===

Following the start of the 20th century, however, mining activity slowed and Ballarat's growth all but stopped—the city went into a period of decline.
The Sunshine rail disaster in 1908 resulted in the death of dozens of Ballarat residents.[tpl]Citation | title = Terrible railway disaster | newspaper = The Age |  publication-place = Melbourne | publisher = David Syme & Co | date = 21 August 1908[/tpl]  On 19 August 1909, a great storm lashed the city, resulting in the death of one person and injury of seven others. During the storm, a tornado swept across the city's northern and eastern suburbs destroying numerous homes in Ballarat North, Soldiers Hill, Black Hill and Ballarat East, lifting and then again touching down at Eureka where it destroyed more homes before dissipating."The Ballarat Tornado" p6. The Mercury. 25 August 1909"Furious Storm at Ballarat - several houses demolished, woman crushed to death, several persons injured" p5. The West Australian. 23 August 1909
Ballarat's significant representation during WWI resulted in heavy human loss. The city eventually lost first provincial status to Geelong.Progressive Geelong – Industrial Expansion. Development of the Harbour. The Argus, Melbourne 14 October 1921 p 8 In response, local lobbyists continually pushed the Victorian government for decentralisation, the greatest success being the Victorian Railways opening the Ballarat North Workshops in April 1917.[tpl]cite book| author = Lee, Robert| coauthors = Rosemary Annable, Donald Stuart Garden| title = The Railways of Victoria 1854–2004| date = 1 August 2007| publisher = Melbourne University Publishing Ltd| isbn = 978-0-522-85134-2| page = 144 [/tpl]  The Great Depression proved a further setback for Ballarat, with the closure of many institutions and causing the worst unemployment in the city's history, with over a thousand people in the dole queue.[tpl]rp|38[/tpl]
The city's two municipalities, Ballarat East and West Town Councils finally amalgamated in 1921 to form the City of Ballarat.[tpl]rp|32[/tpl]

===Since the 20th century===

While deep, the depression was also brief. The interwar period proved a period of recovery for Ballarat with a number of major infrastructure projects well underway including a new sewerage system. In 1930, Ballarat Airport was established. By 1931, Ballarat's economy and population was recovering strongly with further diversification of industry, although in 1936 Geelong displaced it as the state's second largest city.Geelong Ousts Ballarat. Population Surprises. The Argus (Melbourne) Tuesday 28 April 1936, page 10  During World War II an expanded Ballarat airport was the base of the RAAF Wireless Air Gunners' School as well as the base for USAAF Liberator bomber squadrons. In 1942, Ballarat became connected to the state electricity grid by a 66,000 kV line.[tpl]cite news | first = Julia | last = Balderstone | title = SEC offers historic lake property for sale | date = 20 February 1993 | work = The Courier [/tpl] Prior to this, power supply was generated locally.
In the Post-war era, Ballarat's growth continued. In response to an acute housing shortage, significantly suburban expansion occurred. An extensive Housing Commission of Victoria estate was built on the former Ballarat Common (today known as Wendouree West).[tpl]cite web|title=Wendouree West Profile and History|url=http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm#history|work=Wendouree West Community Renewal|accessdate=19 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100709075704/http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm| archivedate= 9 July 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The estate was originally planned to contain over 750 prefabricated houses. While planning for the estate began in 1949, main construction occurred between 1951 to 1962. During the 1970s a further 300 houses were constructed. Private housing in the adjacent suburb of Wendouree closely matched and eventually eclipsed this by the mid-1960s. The suburb of greater Wendouree and Wendouree West had evolved as the suburban middle-class heart of the city.
The 1950s brought a new optimism to the city. On 17 April 1952 it was announced that Lake Wendouree was to be the venue for rowing events of the 1956 Summer Olympics,[tpl]rp|55[/tpl] work soon began on an Olympic village in Gillies Street. A new prefabricted power terminal substation at Norman Street Ballarat North was constructed between 1951 and 1953 by the State Electricity Commission.Ballarat 'B' Power Station. Ballarat Historical Society - private collection The first Begonia Festival, a highly successful community celebration, was held in 1953.

In 23 November 1956, the Olympic torch was carried through the city and the following day the rowing events were held at the lake.[tpl]rp|56[/tpl] On 2 March 1958 the The Queen Mother visited Ballarat.
During the following decades, the city saw increased threats to its heritage. In 1964, the Ballarat City Council passed laws banning pillar supported verandahs in the CBD which threatened the removal of historic cast iron verandahs in the city. The by-law was met by staunch opposition from the National Trust who had begun campaigning to protect some of the city's most historic buildings.[tpl]rp|58[/tpl] By the 1970s, Ballarat began to officially recognise its substantial heritage and the first heritage controls were recommended to ensure its preservation. With the opening of Sovereign Hill, the city made a rapid shift to become a major cultural tourist destination visited by thousands each year.
The city continued to grow at the national average throughout the late 20th century and early 21st century. In 2008 the City of Ballarat released a plan directing that growth of the city over the next 30 years is to be concentrated to the west of the city centre. The Ballarat West Growth Area Plan was approved by the city and state government in 2010, planning an extensive fringe development consisting of 14,000 new homes and up to 40,000 new residents including new activity centres and employment zones.Ballarat West Local Structure Plan[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr |title=Ballarat West Local Structure Plan |publisher=Business Ballarat |accessdate=18 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100818045405/http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr| archivedate= 18 August 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Geography==

Ballarat lies at the foothills of the Great Dividing Range in Central Western Victoria. Also known as the Central Highlands, it is named so because of its gentle hills and lack of any significant mountains that are more common in the eastern sections of the Great Dividing Range. The city lies within a mostly gently undulating section of the midland plains which stretch from Creswick in the north, to Rokewood in the south, and from Lal Lal in the south-east to Pittong in the west.
Geologically the area consists of alluvial sediment and volcanic flows originating from now extinct volcanoes such as nearby Buninyong and Warrenheip which are the area's tallest peaks. As a result, the basin contains large areas of fertile agricultural soil.City of Ballarat (Maps, Population & Location – http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/Global/Maps/index.aspx) [tpl]dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl]  Ballarat itself is situated on an alluvial basin of the Yarrowee catchment and its tributary creeks penetrated by sub-ranges of schists composed of granites and quartz. Along with the visible river and creeks, the catchment basin has numerous active and inactive aquifers and natural wetlands, which are used for urban water supply, agriculture and recreation.
There are numerous densely forested areas around Ballarat, however due to historic wood milling and land clearing there remain no old-growth forests. The major natural bodies of water are in the west and include the former shallow swamps of Lake Wendouree which is central to the city's western suburbs and beyond Winter's Swamp and the large Lake Burrumbeet wetland complex. Almost all of the other numerous bodies of water have been created artificially and include several reservoirs, the largest being the White Swan Reservoir and smaller suburban lakes such as Lake Esmond.
The contiguous urban area of Ballarat covers approximately 90 km2 of the local government area's [tpl]convert|740|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl].2[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/550102/bps_c151_clause_21_04_final.pdf | title = Ballarat Planning Scheme - Land Use | accessdate =14 May 2012 | date = 18 March 2010 | work = City of Ballarat | publisher = City of Ballarat[/tpl] Approximately 90% of the urban area's land use is residential and suburban.  From the city centre this area extends north to approximately [tpl]convert|6|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] north to the hills around Invermay, approximately [tpl]convert|7.5|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] east to Leigh Creek in the foothills of Mount Warrenheip, approximately [tpl]convert|7|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] west along the plains to Lucas and approximately [tpl]convert|8.5|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] south along the Yarrowee river and Canadian creek valley to the fringe of Buninyong.  The central city is situated low in the valley of the Yarrowee and surrounded by hills such that the city skyline is visible only from the hills and the lower lying inner eastern suburbs. The reach of the Yarrowee toward Ballarat Central becomes a stormwater drain and is completely covered over as it flows under the CBD.

===City and suburbs===

Ballarat is a primarily low-rise city though apart from the area around Ballarat Airport there are few established height limits for buildings. The City of Ballarat defines two Major Activity Centres within the urban area - the Central Business District (CBD) and Wendouree with a high concentration of business, retail and community function based primarily on the Melbourne 2030 planning model and a further 11 neighbourhood activity centres.Ballarat Panel Report The tallest building in urban Ballarat is the seven-storey Henry Bolte wing of the Ballarat Base Hospital (1994). Beyond the central area, urban Ballarat extends into several suburban areas with a mixture of housing styles. Predominant styles are 19th century villas, Victorian terraces,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.australianterrace.com/terraced-houses-in/victoria/ballarat/|title=Ballarat|work=Australian Terrace Houses|accessdate=22 April 2014[/tpl] Federation homes and Georgian red brick homes. Settlement patterns around Ballarat consist of small villages and country towns, some with less than a few thousand people.
The Central Business District (located in Ballarat Central) is a large mixed-use office and retail district bounded to the north by railway lines, to the west by Drummond Street, to the south to Grant street and to the east by Princes Street and spanning the floodplain of the Yarrowee River. Lydiard, Sturt Streets, Armstrong, Doveton, Dana Street and Bridge Street (known as Bridge Mall) along with the historic centre of East Ballarat—Main Street and Bakery Hill have retained stands of commercial and civic buildings of state and national heritage significance.
The inner established suburbs were initially laid out around the key mining areas and include Ballarat East, Bakery Hill, Golden Point, Soldiers Hill, Black Hill, Brown Hill, Eureka, Canadian, Mount Pleasant, Redan, Sebastopol and Newington.
The post gold rush era has seen a boom in expansion, extending the conurbation north, south and west. To the west, Ballarat has expanded to Alfredton, Delacombe and Wendouree; to the north it has expanded to Ballarat North, Invermay Park, Invermay and Nerrina; to the east to Warrenheip and south to Sebastopol, Mount Clear and Mount Helen with the urban area encroaching the large town of Buninyong.
Wendouree is currently the only major suburban activity centre with a large indoor shopping mall—Stockland Shopping Centre (expanded in 2007[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl]) and also has a number of surrounding retail parks including a strip shopping centre along Howitt Street including the large retail chain Harvey Norman. Elsewhere are small suburban hubs with supermarkets such as IGA (supermarkets) and small stretches of shopfronts.
Unlike Melbourne, Ballarat does not have a defined urban growth boundary.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]  This has put continuing pressure on the city council to approve development applications for subdivisions outside of the city fringe. In response to lobbying by landholders, the Ballarat West Growth Area Plan, a major greenfield land development plan, was prepared and has approved by the city and state government to allow for planned fringe communities consisting of 14,000 new homes and up to 40,000 new residents, effectively doubling the city's urban area by extending the urban sprawl from Sebastopol, Delacombe and Alfredton west toward Bonshaw, Smythes Creek and Cardigan with a new suburb to be known as Lucas to be created.Henderson, Fiona Ballarat west suburb to be named Lucas The Courier 10 February 2011  New activity centres are to be developed at Delacombe and Alfredton.

==Economy==

The economy of Ballarat is driven by all three economic sectors, though contemporary Ballarat has emerged as a primarily service economy with its main industry being the service industry and its key areas of business including tourism, hospitality, retail, professional services, government administration and education.  Secondary industry including manufacturing, which had grown in the 20th century remains an important sector. The city's historic primary industry roots including mining and agriculture continue to play a role, though one that has declined since the 20th century. Industries emerging this century include information technology service sector and renewable energy.

===Service industries===

As a major service centre for the populous goldfields region, Ballarat has large sectors of employment in business including retail, professional services and trades as well as state and federal government branch offices for public services and health care and non-government service organisations. Collectively these industries employ more than half of the city's workforce and generate the bulk of the city's economic activity.
Ballarat is the main retail economy in the region. The city has several key retail districts including a pedestrian mall known as Bridge Mall comprising over 100 traders. There are also indoor shopping malls including Central Square Shopping Centre and Stockland Wendouree. better known as Wendouree Village, with a large number of specialty stores. Major department stores include Myer, Target, Big W, Kmart, Harvey Norman and Harris Scarfe.[ref]Harris Scarfe Ballarat store opens. The Courier.

Several tourist traps and spin-offs have capitalised on Sovereign Hill's tourism popularity, most of these have sprung up near the eastern entrance of the Western Freeway between Melbourne and Ballarat. They include Kryal Castle (1972), "Gold Rush Mini Golf" (2002) featuring the "Big Miner" (2006) one of Australia's big things (although the original proposal appeared larger and for the miner to hold the Eureka Flag)http://www.goldrushgolf.com.au/uploads/GoldrushEditorial_4_web.pdf at Ballarat's eastern entrance.

===Primary Industry===

As a goldrush boomtown, Ballarat began as a centre of primary industry. Thought gold no longer plays a pivotal role in the economy of the city, gold mining continues to the present date on a smaller scale with a main mine operating. There are still thought to be large, undiscovered gold reserves in the Ballarat region, with investigations being made by local and national companies to extract potentially as much gold as the Gold Rush days in the mid-1800s.

Ballarat has witnessed a significant growth surge since 2006 and the population of the City of Ballarat is becoming increasingly urban such that statistically, the LGA is now used as the ABS statistical division. Recent rapid growth has been attributed by demographers to increased commuter activity arising from surging house and land prices in Melbourne coupled with transport upgrades between Ballarat and Melbourne.

"...and in Ballarat, Victoria, a Tonight show ("Six Tonight") was carving its name into Australian television history. The show, hosted by Fred Fargher, ran for 13 years, and managed to attract many of the top name entertainers in the world, simply by offering them a limo ride to this beautiful country centre, a no-pressure spot on the show, and then a great dinner afterwards at one of the city's excellent restaurants. The sheer bravado of the offer enticed some of show business' biggest names".
