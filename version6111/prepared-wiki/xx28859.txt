[[Exponent (linguistics)]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistic morphology

An exponent is a phonological manifestation of a morphosyntactic property.  In non-technical language, it is the expression of one or more grammatical properties by sound. There are several kinds of exponents:

==Identity==

The identity exponent is both simple and common: it has no phonological manifestation at all.
An example in English:  
DEER + PLURAL → deer

==Affixation==

Affixation is the addition of a prefix, suffix or infix to a word.
An example in English: 
WANT + PAST → wanted

==Reduplication==

Reduplication is the repetition of part of a word.  
An example in Sanskrit: 
DA ("give") + PRESENT + ACTIVE + INDICATIVE + FIRST PERSON + SINGULAR → dadaami (the da at the beginning is from reduplication, a characteristic of class 3 verbs in Sanskrit)

==Internal modification==

There are several types of internal modification.  An internal modification may be segmental, meaning it changes a sound in the root.
An example in English: 
STINK + PAST = stank (i becomes a)
An internal modification might be a suprasegmental modification.  An example would be a change in pitch or stress.
An example of the latter in English (acute accent indicates stress): 
RECÓRD + NOUN = récord

==Subtraction==

Subtraction is the removal of a sound or a group of sounds.
An example in French: 
OEUF /œf/ ("egg") + PLURAL = œufs /ø/ (final f is lost)
