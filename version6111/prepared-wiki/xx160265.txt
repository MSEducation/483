[[Diacylglycerol (DAG) oil]]

CATEGORIES: Cooking oils

Diacylglycerol (DAG) oil is a cooking oil in which the ratio of triglycerides to DAG is shifted to contain mostly DAG, unlike conventional cooking oils, which are rich in TAG. Vegetable DAG oil, for example, contains 80% DAG75-3 Nutritional benefits of Enova oil and is used as a 1:1 replacement for liquid vegetable oils in all applications.Novel Food Information: Vegetable Diacylglycerol Oil

==How it Works==

DAG (Diacylglycerols) and TAG (triacylglycerols) are natural components in all vegetable oils. Through a patent-protected, enzymatic process, the DAG content of a combination of soy and canola oils is significantly increased. Unlike TAG, which is stored as body fat, DAG is immediately burned as energy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] With DAG-rich oil containing more than 80% DAG, less of the oil is stored as body fat as compared to traditional oils, which are rich in TAG.  Excess calories consumed by the body are converted into fat and stored regardless if it is consumed as DAG or TAG.

==FDA Designation==

DAG oil was designated as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by an outside panel of scientific experts and their conclusion has been reviewed and accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This GRAS determination is for use in vegetable oil spreads and home cooking oil. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has approved DAG oil to manage serum triglycerides after a meal, which leads to less build-up of body fat.

==Side Effects==

Because DAG oil is digested the same way as conventional vegetable oils, the potential side effects are no different than those of conventional oil. In addition, studies with animals and human subjects have shown no adverse effects from single dose or long-term consumption of DAG-rich oil. It has also been found that fat soluble vitamins status is not affected by the consumption of DAG-rich oil.H. Watanabe et al. Fat-soluble vitamin status is not affected by diacylglycerol consumption. Ann Nutr Metab. 2001; 45: 259-264

==Research==

Studies indicate that DAG oil has numerous health benefits, including reducing post-meal blood triglyceride levels. H. Taguchi et al. Double-blind controlled study on the effects of dietary diacylglycerol on post-prandial serum and chylomicron triacylglycerol responses in healthy humans. J Am Col Nutr. 2000; 19: 789-796 N. Tada et al. Dynamics of post-prandial remnant-like lipoprotein particles in serum after loading of diacylglycerols. Clin Chim Acta. 2001; 311: 109-117 K. Yamamoto et al. Long-term ingestion of dietary diacylglycerol lowers serum triacylglycerol in type II diabetic patients with hypertriglyceridemia. J Nutr. 2001; 131: 3204-3207 Clinical studies in Japan have also shown that DAG oil may increase overall metabolism, helping reduce the amount of fat already stored in the body. KC Maki et al. Consumption of diacylglycerol oil as part of a mildly reduced-energy diet enhances loss of body weight and fat compared with a triacylglycerol control oil. Am J Clin Nutr. 2002;76:1230-1236 T.

==Sales suspended voluntarily==

On September 16, 2009, Kao Corporation, maker of Econa Cooking Oil has voluntarily suspended sales of products containing DAG oil in Japan which includes cooking oil, mayonnaise, salad dressing, and pet food products.  The company is cited as considering suspending the sales of Enova Brand Oil sold in North America. [ref]

In its press release announcing the temporally suspension of Econa line of products, Kao sites questions raised by European researchers on uncertain health effect of fatty acid glycidyl esters. It states fatty acid glycidyl esters contained in the products are introduced as by-product of deodorization process. It however maintains that the main ingredient DAG (Diacylglycerol) is proven safe, and it plans to resume sale after reducing the amount of fatty acid glycidyl esters introduced in its production method.
