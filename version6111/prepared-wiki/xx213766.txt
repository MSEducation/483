==Plot==

Ramakrishnan (Prabhu Ganesan) has a suspicious-minded wife, Mythili (Abhirami), who thinks he is always having an affair with another woman, even though he is extremely faithful to her and wouldn't dream of betraying her in any way. Vishva (Livingston) has been married to a trusting Amudha (Vindhya) for several years. Seemingly unknown to Amudha, he has been having several affairs with numerous gorgeous women, but in the end she reveals that she knew all along and thought that he would change ("I want you to be my husband in all my births"). There is also Ramakrishnan's friend Thiru (Prabhu Deva) who falls accidentally in love with Susi (Gayatri Raguram). Ramakrishnan meets Tilotama (Monal) who is a call girl (She is set up by Vishva and he goes abroad). Mythili goes to her relatives house for two days, at which point Thilothama arrives to meet Ramakrishnan. Ramakrishnan considers sleeping with her but determines not to have the affair. But his wife, having forgotten something, comes back just in time to see her husband with Thilothama. Then some fun and twists come and they all get caught including Ramakrishnan. At the court Ramakrishnan's wife wants divorce. Ramakrishnan manages to convince his wife that he is true to her, and they live happily ever after. Thiru settles down as well, after Ramakrishnan discovers that his wife is pregnant.

The initial choices for the two leading female roles had been Gayatri Jayaraman and Sanghavi, but the two were replaced due to date issues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tamilguardian.com/tg155/culture.htm |title=Arts & Culture |publisher=Tamilguardian.com |date=2002-04-03 |accessdate=2012-08-05[/tpl]
