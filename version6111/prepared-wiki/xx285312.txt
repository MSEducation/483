Los Marcellos Ferial (in some recordings the name is listed as I Marcellos Ferial) are an Italian vocal group, mainly active in the sixties, consisting of Marcello Minerbi, Carlo Tim√≤ and Tullio Romano.
The vocal trio was formed by the label Durium as a response to the music of Latin America and the Caribbean which was then in vogue in Italy; in particular, the trio was called to record a cover version of the Los Hermanos Rigual song "Cuando calienta el sol" before the rival record company RCA could properly publish the original version in Italy. Their version reached the first place on the Italian Hit Parade, but provoked the reaction of RCA who subsequently sued Durium.[tpl]cite book|last=Eddy Anselmi|title=Festival di Sanremo: almanacco illustrato della canzone italiana|publisher=Panini Comics, 2009|isbn=8863462291[/tpl]
