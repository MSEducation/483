==College==

Flater attended the Colorado School of Mines.  In addition to playing soccer, he also played as a placekicker on the school’s football team.  In 1973, he scored a 63 yard field goal.  The Washington Redskins drafted Flater in the ninth round of the 1974 NFL Draft.

==NASL==

The Denver Dynamos of the North American Soccer League (NASL) drafted Flater in the 1975 NASL college draft.  That season, Flater scored ten goals in fifteen games with the Dynamos.  At the end of the 1975 season, the Dynamos moved to Minnesota where the team was renamed the Minnesota Kicks.  Flater made the move with the team and spent the next two seasons in Minnesota.  However, his scoring pace dropped to one goal in twelve games in 1977 and he moved to the Oakland Stompers for the start of the 1978 season.  He saw time in only four games with Oakland before being traded to the Portland Timbers.  In twenty-two games with the Timbers, he scored seven goals as Portland went to the NASL semifinals.  However, Flater suffered a major knee injury which put him out of the 1979 season.  He attempted a comeback in 1980, but played only three games with the Timbers before retiring.

In 1971, Flater joined the U.S. Olympic team as it began qualification for the 1972 Summer Olympics.  A tie with El Salvador on September 18, 1971 put the U.S. into the games.  However, the team tied once and lost twice, eliminating it from the tournament.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Sports Reference|title=Michael Flater Biography and Statistics|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/fl/michael-flater-1.html|accessdate=2009-10-26[/tpl]
