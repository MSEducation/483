The Mozambique Channel is an arm of the Indian Ocean located between Madagascar and Mozambique. The channel is approximately [tpl]convert|460|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] across at its narrowest point between Angoche, Mozambique, and Tambohorano, Madagascar.
The channel reaches a depth of 3,292 m (10,800 feet) about [tpl]convert|230|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] off the coast of Mozambique. A warm current flows in a southward direction in the channel, leading into the Agulhas Current off the east coast of South Africa. It is around 1,000 miles (1,600 km) long and the width of it varies from 250–600 miles (400–950 km).

==Extent==

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the limits of the Mozambique Channel as follows:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010[/tpl]
Despite being defined as the South African coast by the IHO, the western limit of the channel is more correctly defined as the coast of Southern Africa or, more specifically, of Mozambique.
