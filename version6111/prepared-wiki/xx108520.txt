[[Thoroughbred racing in New Zealand]]

CATEGORIES: Horse racing in New Zealand

The racing of Thoroughbred horses is a popular sport in New Zealand. The governing body is New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing Incorporated. The principal club is the Auckland Racing Club, which races at Ellerslie Racecourse (where the first Totalisator machine in the world was installed in 1919, see Sir George Julius).
Horses are frequently moved between New Zealand and its neighbour Australia, for races and for breeding purposes. Famous New Zealand racehorses include the great mares Desert Gold, Cuddle, Horlicks and Sunline, plus Carbine, Kindergarten, Phar Lap, Nightmarch, Gloaming, Rising Fast, Il Tempo, Advance, Tulloch and Grey Way. Both Australia and New Zealand claim Phar Lap. Gloaming was an Australian bred horse who raced in Australia and New Zealand.
Since 1882, New Zealand bred horses have won 40 Melbourne Cups and many other important races in Australia.ASB VRC Melbourne Cup Race Winners Retrieved on 2009-7-25 During the 2008-09 racing season 19 New Zealand bred Thoroughbreds won 22 Group One races around the world.Racetrack Sires 2009, June/August, 2009, Record season for the New Zealand breed, p.52
