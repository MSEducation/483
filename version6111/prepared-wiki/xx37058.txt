==History==

In 1918, when the Weimar Republic had been established, matters of aviation were provisionally assigned to the Reichsamt des Inneren (Imperial Ministry of the Interior). Later[tpl]When|date=February 2011[/tpl], the Reichsluftamt (Imperial Agency of Aviation'') was established.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lba.de/cln_009/nn_53934/DE/LBA/Geschichte/Geschichtennn=true|author=Luftfahrt-Bundesamt|title=Geschichte|language=German|accessdate=2009-06-09[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
After World War II, matters of aviation were initially handled by the administration of the Allied occupation powers. Some matters of aviation were transferred to  the '"Vorläufige Bundesstelle für Luftfahrtgerät und Flugunfalluntersuchung'" (Provisional Federal Office for Avionic Devices and Investigation of Aviation Accidents) established on 15 September 1953 in Bonn. Eventually, the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt was established by the Gesetz über das Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (Act on the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt) of 30 November 1954 (BGBl. I 354) and commenced operation on 1 February 1955.
In East Germany, the Hauptverwaltung der Zivilen Luftfahrt (Central Administration for Civil Aviation) was established on 1 Jan 1961. It was replaced by the Staatliche Luftfahrt-Inspektion der DDR (Public Department of Aviation of the GDR) on 1 Jan 1968, from which Luftfahrt-Bundesamt took over all operations and most of the staff on 4 October 1990, the day after German re-unification.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lba.de/cln_009/nn_54166/SharedDocs/download/BdP/Publikationen/LBA-Geschichte/Chronik,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/Chronik.pdf|title=Chronik des Luftfahrt-Bundesamts|author=Luftfahrt-Bundesamt|year=2004|language=German|accessdate=2009-06-09[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
On 28 September 2003, substantial competences were formally transferred to the European Aviation Safety Agency established by Regulation (EC) 1592/2002.
