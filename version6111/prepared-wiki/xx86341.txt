CATEGORIES: 2002 films, 2000s drama films

Speakeasy is a 2002 film about two men who become unlikely friends after a minor traffic accident.  Written and directed by Brendan Murphy, Speakeasy was a runner-up to become the first movie produced for Project Greenlight, a documentary series about the making of an independent film.  After Pete Jones's Stolen Summer was chosen for Project Greenlight instead, the show's founders, LivePlanet and Miramax, decided to produce Speakeasy also, as a normal film apart from the documentary series.
