Cardiff, New York is a small hamlet in Onondaga County, New York, located south of Syracuse. It was named after Cardiff, the capital of Wales.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA69#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

It was the site of the William C. "Stub" Newell farm where the "Cardiff Giant", a famous hoax, was "discovered" on October 16, 1869.
In 1993, Cardiff experienced a landslide where part of Bear Mountain rolled over houses and trapped a few residents. The early afternoon of April 27 changed the lives of many people who lived on Tully Farms Road. Properties were covered in mud and clay, 15 feet high in some places.
