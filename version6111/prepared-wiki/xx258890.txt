==History==

Rock was first settled in 1865 by Chicago and North Western Railway workers. J.R. Steele bought land in the community from the railroad in 1866 and settled there, and George English built a store there in the same year. The community was originally called Malton Spur, and a post office called Malton operated from March 28, 1879 to April 30, 1883; Henrietta Crawford served as postmaster of this post office. The community was then renamed Maple Ridge, but changed its name again to Rock when applying for a new post office. The new name was coined by John Niequist and was derived from the rocky terrain in the area. The new post office opened on June 16, 1886, with Niequist as postmaster.[tpl]cite book | last = Romig | first = Walter  | year = 1986 | title = Michigan Place Names | origyear= 1973 | publisher = Wayne State University Press | location = Detroit, Michigan | isbn = 0-8143-1838-X[/tpl]
