The principal design alternative to the twin-tube form has been the mono-tube shock absorber which was considered a revolutionary advancement when it appeared in the 1950s.  As its name implies, the mono-tube shock, which is also a gas-pressurized shock and also comes in a coilover format, consists of only one tube, the pressure tube, though it has two pistons.  These pistons are called the working piston and the dividing or floating piston, and they move in relative synchrony inside the pressure tube in response to changes in road smoothness.  The two pistons also completely separate the shock's fluid and gas components.  The mono-tube shock absorber is consistently a much longer overall design than the twin-tubes, making it difficult to mount in passenger cars designed for twin-tube shocks.  However, unlike the twin-tubes, the mono-tube shock can be mounted either wayâ€” it does not have any directionality.  It also does not have a compression valve, whose role has been take up by the dividing piston, and although it contains nitrogen gas, the gas in a mono-tube shock is under high pressure (260-360 p.s.i. or so) which can actually help it to support some of the vehicle's weight, something which no other shock absorber is designed to do.[ref]

Mercedes became the first auto manufacturer to install mono-tube shocks as standard equipment on some of their cars starting in 1958.  Because the design was patented, no other manufacturer could use it until 1971 when the patent expired.
