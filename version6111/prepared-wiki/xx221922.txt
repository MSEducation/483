Snoopy and His Friends is the third album by the Ocala, Florida group The Royal Guardsmen.
The group is best known for their hit recording of "Snoopy vs. the Red Baron", which was first released in 1966 as a 45rpm record single (it reached No. 2 in the US and No. 8 in the UK). The song, "Snoopy's Christmas", is still one of the Top 10 ‘non-traditional’ Christmas songs played during the month of December each year per BMI and ASCAP.[tpl]cn|date=August 2012[/tpl] Both songs appear on Snoopy and His Friends.
Charles Schulz, creator of the Peanuts comic strip (and the Snoopy character), drew the album artwork.
