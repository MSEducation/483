Air India FC, is an Indian professional football club founded in 1952, based in Mumbai, Maharashtra. They are sponsored by Air India and have enjoyed some success in the Mumbai Football League.
Founded in 1952, Air India Football Club is one of the oldest institutional sides in the country. Though never considered as frontrunners in the I-League, the Mumbai based club has often proved to be a thorn in the flesh for many top sides. They used to play in NFL 2nd Division but got promoted to Premier Division and have maintained their position there till now. Generally a low budget side, Air India’s best finish in the National Football League (now I-League) came in the 1997-1998 season when they were placed sixth in the table and their coach Bimal Ghosh received the Best coach award.
Four times champions in the local league in Mumbai, Air India are best known for nurturing youngsters into big time players. Many of these boys have played with distinction for bigger teams in the later years.http://the-aiff.com/pages/club/index.php?Aboutclub=40&ClubDetail=40
