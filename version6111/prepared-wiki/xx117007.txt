Paul Jason Hanley (born 12 November 1977 in Melbourne, Australia) is a professional male tennis player from Australia, specialising in doubles.
He made the 2005 Wimbledon and 2011 Australian Open finals in mixed doubles, playing with Tatiana Perebiynis and Chan Yung-jan respectively, falling short on both occasions. His current doubles partner is Jamie Murray; however, he has had his most successful partnerships with Wayne Arthurs and Kevin Ullyett. Hanley has an 8–4 win-loss record on the Australian Davis Cup Team. His highest doubles ranking to date has been World Number 5. His parents, Jay and Judy, co-own a tennis centre, which is one of the main reasons why Hanley pursued a career in the sport.
