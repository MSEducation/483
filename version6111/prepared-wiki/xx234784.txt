The Hunters ROTC was a Filipino guerrilla unit active during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, and was the main anti-Japanese guerrilla group active in the area near the Philippine capital of Manila.  It was created upon dissolution of the Philippine Military Academy in the beginning days of the war.

When war broke out in the Philippines, some 300 Philippine Military Academy and ROTC cadets, unable to join the USAFFE units because of their youth, banded together in a common desire to contribute to the war effort throughout the Bataan campaign. The "ROTC lads", as they were referred to, did their bit to protect the civilians and to assist the USAFFE forces by way of intelligence and propaganda.
After the surrender of American and Filipino forces on Bataan, and organized resistance ceased, the entire group went up the Antipolo mountains, bringing with them arms secured from civilians and USAFFE stragglers, and began calling themselves the Hunters.
The Hunters originally conducted operations with another guerrilla group called Marking's Guerrillas, with whom they went about liquidating Japanese spies. Led by Miguel Ver, a PMA cadet, the Hunters raided the enemy-occupied Union College in Manila and seized 130 Enfield rifles.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.rememberlosbanos1945.com/|title=Remember Los Banos 1945|accessdate=2009-10-17|publisher=Los Banos Liberation Memorial Scholarship Foundation, Inc.|year=2008[/tpl]

They were among the most aggressive guerrillas in the war and made the only guerrilla raid on a Japanese prison, Muntinglupa (New Bilibid), to free their captured members and to obtain arms.  They also participated in the liberation of Los Banos prison camp during liberation.  Captain Bartolomeo Cabangbang, leader of the central Luzon penetration party, said that the Hunters supplied the best intelligence data on Luzon.
