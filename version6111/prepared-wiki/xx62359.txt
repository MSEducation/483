==Career==

In 1976, Baio played the title character Bugsy Malone in the cult children’s gangster musical directed by Alan Parker, which also co-starred Jodie Foster. Baio and Foster later worked together again in the teen girl drama Foxes (1980), helmed by Adrian Lyne. When he was 16, Baio was then cast as The Fonz's cousin Chachi Arcola on Happy Days. During his time on Happy Days, Baio earned two Emmy Award nominations for his lead performances in the television movies Stoned (1981) and All the Kids Do It (1985). He won two Young Artist Awards during the Third Annual Youth in Film Awards (1980–1981) as Best Young Actor in a Television Special for Stoned and Best Young Comedian in Television or Motion Pictures for Happy Days. He also starred in the made-for-television youth drama specials The Boy Who Drank Too Much with Lance Kerwin and Senior Trip with Mickey Rooney.
In 1982, Baio was in a spin-off of Happy Days entitled Joanie Loves Chachi with Erin Moran, which lasted 17 episodes. That same year, he appeared opposite another actor, Willie Aames, in the film Zapped!, and recorded an album for RCA (he also recorded a second album The Boys Are Out Tonight the following year). During this same period, he also starred with Danny Aiello and undertook the lead role of Francis Geminiani in the special HBO cable television presentation of "Gemini", an adaptation of the Broadway comedy-drama "Happy Birthday, Gemini" by the award-winning playwright Alberto Innauranto. From 1984 until 1990, Baio starred in the syndicated comedy series Charles in Charge. In 1985, he was part of an ensemble cast for Alice in Wonderland, where he portrayed Pat the Pig. From 1987 through 1991, he was a director of the children's comedy series Out of This World.
During the 1990s, Baio appeared in various television programs, including the short-lived Look Who's Talking small screen spin-off Baby Talk. In 1991, he joined Diana Muldaur and Ally Walker in the NBC Monday Night Movie Perry Mason and the Case of the Fatal Fashion, as a young prosecutor. Between 1992 and 1995, he portrayed Dr. Jack Stewart in the medical mystery series Diagnosis: Murder starring Dick Van Dyke.

Baio's other movies include the independent films Very Mean Men (2000), Face to Face (2001) and The Bread, My Sweet (2001). Very Mean Men was a comedy directed by Tony Vitale about a mob war between two families. Baio served as a co-producer with his older brother Steven on said film, and even played the crucial role of impetuous crime scion Paulie Minnetti who unwittingly instigates the crime feud. Variety praised his performance, stating it was "a career-reviving turn by Scott Baio." [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]

He earned three Best Lead Actor prizes in the Atlantic City Film Festival, the Kansas City Halfway to Hollywood Film Festival and the San Diego Film Festival. The movie itself collected top accolades from the Santa Monica, Stony Brook, Marco Island, Houston World Festival and Iowa Hardacre Film Festival.
In 2005, Baio played himself in the Wes Craven film Cursed. Baio was also in the Emmy Award-winning comedy series Arrested Development as the madcap Bluth family's serious but overpaid lawyer, Bob Loblaw (pronounced similar to "Ba-bla-bla, a running joke). He took over the role of the clan's legal counselor from former Happy Days co-star Henry Winkler in four episodes: "Forget Me Now", "Notapusy", "Mr. F" and "Making a Stand".

His posting, “Taxes are DONE...That should feed, house & provide medical for a few lazy non working people at my expense. Have a great Monday!" was picked up by the blog Jezebel, and the heated web-based discussion between Baio, his wife, the Jezebel.com authors, Jezebel readers and Baio fans was covered by major news organizations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://entertainment.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/04/21/scott-baio-and-his-wife-in-another-twitter-tussle/|title=Scott Baio and his wife in another Twitter tussle...|date=April 21, 2010|publisher=Fox News.com|accessdate=April 23, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1245303/Happy-Days-star-Scott-Baio-calls-FBI-Twitter-death-threats-Michelle-Obama-joke.html|title=Happy Days star Scott Baio gets Twitter death threats after Michelle Obama 'joke'|first=Daily Mail Reporter|date=January 22, 2010|publisher=Daily Mail.co.uk|accessdate=April 23, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.longislandpress.com/2010/04/21/scott-baio-renee-baio-twitter-facebook-bad-attitudes/|title=Scott Baio, Renee Baio, Twitter, Facebook & Bad Attitudes|date=April 21, 2010|publisher=Long Island Press|accessdate=April 23, 2010[/tpl]
On July 1, 2010, he hosted The Dennis Miller Show and gave his views on current events, such as the BP oil spill. In May 2011, Baio was honored as a featured guest speaker during the Hollywood Congress of Republicans monthly meetup, saying, "I was never afraid to speak my mind. But I do remember times on a set where I'd hear my 'Liberal' friends talking and I didn't speak out. I stepped back and did not comment because there is a stigma the industry that if you talk a conservative and/or Republican, you don't work."
