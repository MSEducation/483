==Biography==

Sometimes called the "forgotten friar," Padre Fermín Lasuén actually governed the California Mission system three years longer than his more famous predecessor, Padre Junipero Serra. Lasuén was born at Vitoria in Álava, Spain on July 7, 1736 and joined the Franciscan Order as a teenager, entering the Friary of San Francisco shortly before his fifteenth birthday on March 19, 1751. On March 19, 1751, Lasuén was ceremoniously invested with his Franciscan habit. Archival Center of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, "Private notes on California'a Catholic Heritage", ed. by Msgr. Francis Weber, not paginated. 
In 1759, he left Cádiz with seventeen other friars while still a deacon to volunteer for ministry in the Americas. He arrived in New Spain in 1761 and was sent west to Las Californias in 1768. Following the establishment of Mission San Diego de Alcalá in 1769, he moved north to Alta California in 1773.  He based himself in San Diego and remained there until 1775; he helped establish Mission San Juan Capistrano before the murder of Father Luís Jayme. Kumeyaay Indian unrest caused his return to San Diego and the general withdrawal of Spanish operations. 
In late 1776 he went to San Luis Obispo before again returning to San Diego in 1777 when he was made minister there. He was appointed the second Presidente of the missions in California in 1785, following the death of Junípero Serra, and transferred to the Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo. Lasuén continued the work begun by Serra, establishing 9 more missions, bringing the total to 18 (the final total was 21). On his death he was succeeded by Padre Pedro Estévan Tápis.

==Intellect, Personality and Character==

Although of a more introspective and brooding temperament than his predecessor Junipero Serra, Lasuén was single-minded and a capable administrator, founding the remaining California missions.  Captain Alessandro Malaspina described Padre Lasuén as such: "...a man who in Christian lore, piety and conduct was truly apostolic, and his manner and learning unusual." Archival Center of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, "Private notes on California'a Catholic Heritage", ed. by Msgr. Francis Weber, not paginated.  It is clear from his diaries that Lasuén struggled with loneliness and perhaps some depression brought about by the extreme conditions he encountered in San Diego when he was asked to return to restore order after the murder of Fray Jayme. Lasuén described the ardors of missionary life as such:
At age 47, writing to his friend Fray Joseph de Jesus Maria Velez in 1783, Lasuén stated:  
His Christian zeal and sense of "civilizing" purpose led him to great lengths in order to acculturate native Americans, even using their language in his pursuit, despite the Spanish king's prohibition in that respect. News of the mistreatment of native Americans in the Mission of San Francisco reached governor of California Diego de Borica, also a Basque, who warned of a lawsuit against him should he not give up on his practices.[tpl]cite book |last1=Douglass|first1=William A.|last2=Douglass|first2=Bilbao, J.|date=1975(2005) |title=Amerikanuak: Basques in the New World |url=http://books.google.es/books?id=8KzfK1QwxDIC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|location=Reno, NV|publisher=University of Nevada Press |isbn=0-87417-625-5|accessdate=16 February 2014|page=192[/tpl]
