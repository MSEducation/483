Established as the Telecommunications Department of Malaya in 1946, it was privatised in 1987, and listed on Bursa Malaysia in 1990. Subsequent growth led to a demerger in 2008 of TM's mobile and fixed services, allowing the company to focus more intently on its core businesses of Internet and multimedia, data and fixed-line services.http://www.tm.com.my/ap/about/investor/Documents/TM_Eng_2010.pdf
