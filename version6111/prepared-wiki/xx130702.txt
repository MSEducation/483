Dick Pointer (before 1778 â€“ 1827) was an American frontier hero and an  African slave. He is best known for his bravery in the defence of Fort Donnally, in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, from a Shawnee attack in 1778.  During the attack he used a rifle to secure the front door against attackers.  Some years later, Pointer spoke before the Virginia General Assembly, requesting his own freedom in consideration for his act of bravery; he was emancipated in 1801.  He died in 1827.Clauson-Wicker & Rockefeller (2009), p. 99
