The Alunni del Sole ("Pupils of the Sun") is an Italian pop group, mainly successful in the seventies. 
The group, which takes its name from the eponymous novel by Giuseppe Marotta, was born in the late sixties when two brothers of Naples, Paolo Morelli (piano and vocals) and Bruno Morelli (guitars), sons of a composer and of a pianist, decided moving in Rome to pursue a musical career and to be closer to the record companies; there they formed the group with Giulio Leofrigio (drums) and Giampaolo Borra (bass guitar).[tpl]cite news|last=Luciano Gianfranceschi|title=Sangue fucecchiese negli Alunni del Sole|newspaper=Il Tirreno|date=13 May 2013[/tpl]
