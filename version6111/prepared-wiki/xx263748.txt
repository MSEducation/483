[[Pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide]]

CATEGORIES: Pheromones, Biochemistry

The pheromone biosynthesis activation neuropeptide (PBAN) is a neurohormone (member of the PBAN/pyrokinin neuropeptide family) that activates the biosynthesis of pheromones in moths. Moth females release PBAN into their hemolymph during the scotophase to stimulate the biosynthesis of the unique pheromone that will attract the conspecific males. PBAN release is drastically reduced after mating, contributing to the loss in female receptivity.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Rafaeli |first1=Ada |title=Pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN): Regulatory role and mode of action |journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology |volume=162 |issue=1 |pages=69–78 |year=2009 |pmid=18495120 |doi=10.1016/j.ygcen.2008.04.004[/tpl]

==Molecular mechanism of action==

The precise regulatory mechanisms exerted by PBAN on the different steps of pheromone biosynthesis remain to be determined. However, the receptor of this neuropeptide has been already cloned.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Matsumoto |first1=Shogo |last2=Hull |first2=J.

According to the effects of gene disruption in the pheromone synthesis of Bombykol (the main pheromone component of the silk moth Bombyx mori and the corn earworm moth), the increase in intracellular calcium levels turns to activate different key enzymes of the last steps of pheromone biosynthesis.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Ohnishi |first1=Atsushi |last2=Hull |first2=J.
