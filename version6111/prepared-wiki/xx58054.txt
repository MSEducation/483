==History==

Detroit Lake is situated over a historical road bed of the former Oregon Pacific Railroad.  This route was built by Colonel T. Egenton Hogg as a proposed transcontinental railroad.  Because of a lack of funding, the line terminated in Idanha, southeast of the lake.  Idanha had rail service until the 1950s, when the track was removed for installation of the Detroit and Big Cliff reservoirs.Oregon Pacific Railroad Detroit Lake was created in 1953 after the completion of the dam. Part of the Willamette Valley Projects, the lake was intended primarily for flood control and power generation but has become one of the major recreation resources in western Oregon.
