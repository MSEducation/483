The Pinewood Studios Group (officially Pinewood Shepperton plc) is a multinational film studio  and television studio company headquartered in Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, UK. The group runs Pinewood Studios, Shepperton Studios and Teddington Studios in the UK and Pinewood Toronto Studios, Pinewood Indomina Studios, Pinewood Studio Berlin and Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios in Canada, the Dominican Republic, Germany and Malaysia respectively.
To date over 1,500 productions have used facilities or services provided by The Pinewood Studios Group. By 2013 it is planned to have a combined square footage of nearly one million square feet of studio space across all of its facilities. The company was subject to a corporate takeover in 2011 by the Greater Manchester based company The Peel Group who subsequently acquired a majority control 73% stake whilst Warren James Jewellers retained a 27% shareholding, preventing a full takeover that has not impeded on the operational integrity of the company.[tpl]Cite news |title=Peel takeover cost Pinewood £2.4m |url=http://www.how-do.co.uk/north-west-media-news/other-media/peel-takeover-cost-pinewood-%C2%A32.4m-20120229100956657 |work=How Do |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=2012-03-18[/tpl]

==History==

The Pinewood Studios Group was formed by merger of Pinewood and Shepperton Studios at the start of the new millennium.  The company floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2004 as Pinewood Shepperton Plc.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2004/apr/01/film.filmnews|title=Pinewood Shepperton to float on stock market|date=1 April 2004|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=30 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3692587.stm|title=Pinewood share sale raises £46m|date= 7 May 2004|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 September 2011[/tpl] In 2005, Teddington Studios was purchased by the Group.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4399671.stm|title=Pinewood buys Teddington Studios|date= 1 April 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2005/apr/02/7|title=Teddington Studios sold to rival|date= 1 April 2005|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=30 September 2011[/tpl]
