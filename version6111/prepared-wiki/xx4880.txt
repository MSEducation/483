The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), originally the International Telegraph Union ([tpl]lang-fr|link=no|Union Internationale des Télécommunications[/tpl]), is a specialized agency of the United Nations that is responsible for issues that concern information and communication technologies.International Telecommunication Union The ITU coordinates the shared global use of the radio spectrum, promotes international cooperation in assigning satellite orbits, works to improve telecommunication infrastructure in the developing world, and assists in the development and coordination of worldwide technical standards.
ITU also organizes worldwide and regional exhibitions and forums, such as ITU TELECOM WORLD, bringing together representatives of government and the telecommunications and ICT industry to exchange ideas, knowledge and technology.
The ITU is active in areas including broadband Internet, latest-generation wireless technologies, aeronautical and maritime navigation, radio astronomy, satellite-based meteorology, convergence in fixed-mobile phone, Internet access, data, voice, TV broadcasting, and next-generation networks.
ITU, based in Geneva, Switzerland, is a member of the United Nations Development Group.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |title=UNDG Members |publisher=Undg.org |accessdate=15 May 2012[/tpl] Its membership includes 193 Member States and around 700 Sector Members and Associates.

==World Conference on International Telecommunications 2012 (WCIT-12)==

In December 2012, the ITU facilitated The World Conference on International Telecommunications 2012 (WCIT-12) in Dubai.  WCIT-12 was a treaty-level conference to address International Telecommunications Regulations: international rules for telecommunications, including international tariffs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/en/wcit-12/Pages/default.aspx |title=World Conference on International Telecommunications 2012 |publisher=Itu.int |accessdate=12 October 2012[/tpl] The previous conference to update the Regulations (ITRs) was held in Melbourne in 1988.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/3F/01/T3F010000010001PDFE.pdf |title=International Telecommunication Regulations |format=PDF |accessdate=12 October 2012[/tpl]
In August 2012, ITU called for a public consultation on a draft document ahead of the conference. It is claimed the proposal would allow government restriction or blocking of information disseminated via the internet and create a global regime of monitoring internet communications – including the demand that those who send and receive information identify themselves. It would also allow governments to shut down the internet if there is the belief that it may interfere in the internal affairs of other states or that information of a sensitive nature might be shared.
Telecommunications ministers from 193 countries attended the conference in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

===Changes to International Telecommunication Regulations===

The current regulatory structure was based on voice telecommunications, when the Internet was still in its infancy.Global Internet usage In 1988, telecommunications operated under regulated monopolies in most countries.  As the Internet has grown, organizations such as ICANN have come into existence to manage key resources such as Internet addresses and Domain Names.  Some outside the United States believe that the United States exerts too much influence over the governance of the Internet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/05/29/russia_calls_for_internet_revolution_15867.html |title=Russia calls for internet revolution |publisher=Indrus.in |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=12 October 2012[/tpl]

===Proposed Changes to the Treaty And Concerns===

Current proposals look to take into account the prevalence of data communications.  Proposals under consideration would establish regulatory oversight by the U.N. over security, fraud, traffic accounting as well as traffic flow, management of Internet Domain Names and IP addresses, and other aspects of the Internet that are currently governed either by community-based approaches such as Regional Internet Registries, ICANN, or largely national regulatory frameworks.Internet Society.

On 22 November 2012, the European Parliament passed a resolution urging member states to prevent ITU WCIT-12 activity that would "negatively impact the internet, its architecture, operations, content and security, business relations, internet governance and the free flow of information online". The resolution asserted that "the ITU ... is not the appropriate body to assert regulatory authority over the internet".
On 5 December 2012, the lower chamber of the United States Congress passed a resolution opposing U.N. governance of the Internet by a rare unanimous 397–0 vote. The resolution warned that "... proposals have been put forward for consideration at the WCIT-12 that would fundamentally alter the governance and operation of the Internet ... and would attempt to justify increased government control over the Internet ...", and stated that the policy of the United States is "... to promote a global Internet free from government control and preserve and advance the successful Multistakeholder Model that governs the Internet today." The same resolution had previously been passed unanimously by the upper chamber of the Congress in September.[tpl]cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/271153-house-approves-resolution-to-keep-internet-control-out-of-un-hands|title=House approves resolution to keep Internet control out of UN hands|publisher=The Hill|date=5 December 2012[/tpl]
On 14 December 2012, an amended version of the Regulations was signed by 89 of the 152 countries. Countries that did not sign included the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, India and the United Kingdom. The Head of the U.S. Delegation, Terry Kramer, said "We cannot support a treaty that is not supportive of the multistakeholder model of Internet governance".

===WCIT-12 Conference Participation===

The conference itself was managed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). While certain parts of civil society and industry were able to advise and observe, active participation was restricted to member states.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/net/about/basic-texts/convention/chapteri.aspx#3 |title=Convention of the ITU |publisher=Itu.int |accessdate=12 October 2012[/tpl] The Electronic Frontier Foundation expressed concern at this, calling for a more transparent multi-stakeholder process.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/05/eff-joins-coalition-denouncing-secretive-wcit-planning-process |title=EFF Joins Coalition Denouncing Secretive WCIT Planning Process |publisher=Eff.org |date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=12 October 2012[/tpl] Some leaked contributions can be found on the wcitleaks.org web site.
