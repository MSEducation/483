Youghal was a constituency represented in the Irish House of Commons to 1800. It was a corporation with burgesses and freemen under the patronage of the Earl of Shannon. Following the Act of Union 1800 the borough was disfranchised.

==History==

A Topographical Directory of Ireland, published in 1837, describes the Parliamentary history of the borough of Youghal in County Cork.
 
 The borough appears to have exercised the elective franchise by prescription, as, though no notice of that privilege appears in any of its charters, it continued to send two members to the Irish parliament from the year 1374 till the Union, since which period it has returned one member to the imperial parliament; the right of election was vested solely in the members of the corporation and the freemen, whether resident or not; but by the act of the 2nd of Wm. IV., cap. 88, it has been granted to the £10 householders, and the non-resident freemen have been disfranchised. A new boundary has been drawn round the town, including an area of 212 statute acres.
