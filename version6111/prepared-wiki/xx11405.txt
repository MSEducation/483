==Most popular vehicles==

There are over 1 billion bicycles in use worldwide.[tpl]Citation |url= http://www.worldometers.info/bicycles/ |publisher= Worldometers |title= Bicycles[/tpl] According to 2002 estimates, there are around 590 million cars in service in the world and 205 million motorcycles.[tpl]cite web |title=Passenger Cars; Map No. 31 |work=Worldmapper: The world as you've never seen it before |year=2002 |url=http://www.sasi.group.shef.ac.uk/worldmapper/display.php?selected=31 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Mopeds And Motorcycles Map No. 32 |work=Worldmapper: The world as you've never seen it before |year=2002 |url=http://www.sasi.group.shef.ac.uk/worldmapper/display.php?selected=32 [/tpl] The most popular vehicle model in history is the Chinese Flying Pigeon bicycle, with on the order of 500 million in service.[tpl]Citation |title= Flight of the Pigeon |last= Koeppel |first= Dan |magazine= Bicycling |date= January–February 2007 |volume= 48 |issue= 1 |ISSN=0006-2073 |publisher= Rodale, Inc. |pages= 60–66 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=isUDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60 |accessdate= 2012-01-28 [/tpl] The most popular motor vehicle is the Honda Super Cub motorcycle, having passed 60 million units in 2008.[tpl]Citation |title= Honda Sells Its 60 Millionth – Yes, Millionth – Super Cub |first= Chuck |last= Squatriglia |date= 23 May 2008 | url= http://blog.wired.com/cars/2008/05/honda-sells-its.html |magazine= Wired |accessdate= 2010-10-31 [/tpl][tpl]citation |title= That's 2.5 billion cc! |magazine=American Motorcyclist |publisher=American Motorcyclist Association |location=Westerville, Ohio | date= May 2006 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=qvUDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24 |issn=0277-9358 |page= 24 |accessdate= 2010-10-31 [/tpl] The top selling car in history is the Toyota Corolla, with at least 35 million produced.[tpl]Citation |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-18/toyota-ponders-recall-of-worlds-best-selling-car/334668 |title= Toyota ponders recall of world's best-selling car |date= 18 February 2010 |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation News Online [/tpl][tpl]citation |title= The Best-Selling Cars of All Time |date= 26 January 2012 |author= 24/7 Wall St.|url=  http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2012/01/26/best-selling-cars-all-time/#ixzz1knEw51HI |publisher= Fox Business [/tpl]

==Locomotion==

Locomotion is achieved by being towed by another vehicle or animal or by obtaining, converting and using energy. Hybrid and tribrid vehicles have more complicated designs that employ several different paths for energy to take before being used.

===Energy source===

It is essential that a vehicle have a source of energy to drive it. Energy can be extracted from the surrounding environment, as in the case of a sailboat, a solar-powered car or a streetcar. Energy can also be stored, in any form, provided it can be converted on demand and the storing medium's energy density and power density are sufficient to meet the vehicle's needs.
The most common type of energy source is fuel. External combustion engines can use almost anything that burns as fuel whilst internal combustion engines and rocket engines are tailor built to burn a specific fuel, typically gasoline, diesel or ethanol.
Another common medium for storing energy are batteries. Batteries have the advantage of being responsive, useful in a wide rage of power levels, environmentally friendly, efficient, simple to install and easy to maintain.[tpl]cite web| title = Comparing the Battery with other Power Sources| publisher = Battery University| url = http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/comparing_the_battery_with_other_power_sources| accessdate = 2011-07-23[/tpl] Batteries also facilitate the use of electric motors, which have their own advantages. On the other hand, batteries have low energy densities, short service life, poor performance at extreme temperatures, long charging times and difficulties with disposal (although they can usually be recycled). like fuel, batteries store chemical energy and can cause burns and poisoning in event of an accident.[tpl]cite web| title = Battery Safety| publisher = Electropaedia| url = http://www.mpoweruk.com/safety.htm| accessdate = 2011-07-23[/tpl] Batteries also lose effectiveness with time.[tpl]cite web| title = The Lifecycle of an Electric Car Battery| publisher = HowStuffWorks| url = http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/vehicles/electric-car-battery4.htm| accessdate = 2011-07-23[/tpl] The issue of charge time can be resolved by swapping discharged batteries with charged ones,[tpl]cite web| title = Advantages and Disadvantages of EVs| publisher = HowStuffWorks| url = http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/vehicles/electric-car-battery3.htm| accessdate = 2011-07-23[/tpl] however this incurs additional hardware cost and may be impractical for larger batteries. Moreover, there must be standard batteries for battery swapping to work at a gas station. Fuel cells are similar to batteries in that they convert from chemical to electrical energy, but have their own set of advantages and disadvantages.
Electrified rails and overhead cables are a common source of electrical energy on subways, railways, trams, and trolleybuses. 
Solar energy is a more modern development, and several solar vehicles have been successfully built and tested, including Helios, a solar-powered aircraft.
Nuclear power is a more exclusive form of energy storage, currently reserved for large ships and submarines, mostly military. Nuclear energy can be released by a nuclear reactor, nuclear battery or by repeatedly detonating nuclear bombs. There have been two experiments with nuclear-powered aircraft, the Tupolev Tu-119 and the Convair X-6.
Mechanical strain is another method of storing energy, where an elastic band or metal spring is deformed and releases energy as it is allowed to return to its ground state. Systems employing elastic materials suffer from hysteresis, and metal springs are too dense to be useful in many cases.[tpl]Clarify|date=July 2011[/tpl]
Flywheels store energy in a spinning mass. Because a light and fast rotor is energetically favorable, flywheels can pose a significant safety hazard. Moreover, flywheels leak energy fairly quickly and effect a vehicle's steering due to the gyroscopic effect. They have been used experimentally in gyrobuses.
Wind energy is used by sailboats and land yachts as the primary source of energy. It is very cheap and fairly easy to use, the main issues being dependence on weather and upwind performance. Balloons also rely on the wind to move horizontally. Aircraft flying in the jet stream may get a boost from high altitude winds.
Compressed gas is currently an experimental method of storing energy. In this case, compressed gas is simply stored in a tank and released when necessary. Like elastics, they have hysteresis losses when gas heats up during compression.
Gravitational potential energy is a form of energy used in gliders, skis, bobsleds and numerous other vehicles that go down hill. Regenerative braking is an example of capturing kinetic energy where the brakes of a vehicle are augmented with a generator or other means of extracting energy.[tpl]cite web| title = How Regenerative Braking Works| publisher = HowStuffWorks| url = http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-types/regenerative-braking.htm| accessdate = 2011-07-23[/tpl]
Human power is a simple source of energy that requires nothing more than humans. Despite the fact that humans cannot exceed [tpl]convert|500|W|hp|abbr=on[/tpl] for meaningful amounts of time,[tpl]cite web| title = Bicycle Power – How many Watts can you produce?| publisher = Mapawatt| url = http://blog.mapawatt.com/2009/07/19/bicycle-power-watts/| accessdate = 2011-07-23[/tpl] the land speed record for human-powered vehicles (unpaced) is [tpl]convert|133|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on[/tpl], as of 2009.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.wisil.recumbents.com/wisil/whpsc2009/results.htm|title = Battle Mountain World Human Powered Speed Challenge|accessdate = 25 August 2011|last = WHPSC|date=September 2009[/tpl]

===Motors and engines===

When needed, the energy is taken from the source and consumed by one or more motors or engines. Sometimes there is an intermediate medium, such as the batteries of a diesel submarine.[tpl]cite web| title = How do the engines breathe in diesel submarines?| publisher = How Stuff Works| date = 24 July 2006| url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/question286.htm| accessdate = 2011-07-22[/tpl]
Most motor vehicles have internal combustion engines. They are fairly cheap, easy to maintain, reliable, safe and small. Since IC engines burn fuel, they have long ranges but pollute the environment. A related engine is the external combustion engine. An example of this are steam engines. Aside from fuel, steam engines also need water, making them impractical for some purposes. Steam engines also need time to warm up, whereas IC engines can usually run right after being started, although this is not recommended in cold conditions. Steam engines burning coal release sulfur into the air causing harmful acid rain.[tpl]cite web| title = Coal and the environment| publisher = Kentucky Coal Education| url = http://www.coaleducation.org/lessons/twe/envi.pdf| accessdate = 2011-07-22[/tpl]
While intermittent internal combustion engines were once the primary means of aircraft  propulsion, they have been largely superseded by continuous internal combustion engines: gas turbines. Turbine engines are light and, particularly when used on aircraft, efficient.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] On the other hand, they cost more and require careful maintenance. They also get damaged from ingesting foreign objects and produce a hot exhaust. Trains using turbines are called gas turbine-electric locomotives. Examples of surface vehicles using turbines include M1 Abrams, MTT Turbine SUPERBIKE and the Millennium. Pulse jet engines are similar in many ways to turbojets, but have almost no moving parts. For this reason, they were very appealing to vehicle designers in the past, however their noise, heat and inefficiency has lend their abandonment. A historical example of a pulse jet in use was the V-1 flying bomb. Pulse jets are still occasionally used in amateur experiments. With the advent of modern technology, the pulse detonation engine has become practical and was successfully tested on a Rutan VariEze. While the pulse detonation engine is much more efficient that the pulse jet and even turbine engines, it still suffers from extreme noise and vibration levels. Ramjets also have few moving parts, but they only work at high speed meaning that their use is restricted to tip jet helicopters and high speed aircraft such as the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,834721,00.html|title=Here Comes the Flying Stovepipe |work=TIME|accessdate=2011-07-22| date=26 November 1965[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title = the heart of the SR-71 "Blackbird" : the mighty J-58 engine| publisher = aérostories| url = http://aerostories.free.fr/technique/J58/J58_01/page9.html| accessdate = 2011-07-22[/tpl]
Rocket engines are primarily used on rockets, rocket sleds and experimental aircraft. Rocket engines are extremely powerful. The heaviest vehicle to ever leave the ground, the Saturn V rocket, was powered by five F-1 rocket engines generating a combined 180 million horsepower[ref]
[tpl]cite web| title = Historical Timeline| publisher = NASA| url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/history/timeline/1950_prt.htm| accessdate = 2011-07-22[/tpl][/ref] (134,226 megawatt). Rocket engines also don't need to "push off" of anything, a fact that the New York Times denied in error. Rocket engines can be particularly simple, sometimes consisting of nothing more than a catalyst, as in the case of a hydrogen peroxide rocket.[tpl]cite web| title = Can you make a rocket engine using hydrogen peroxide and silver?| publisher = How Stuff Works| url = http://www.howstuffworks.com/question159.htm| accessdate = 2011-07-22[/tpl] This makes them an attractive option for vehicles such as jet packs. Despite their simplicity, rocket engines are often dangerous and susceptible to explosions. The fuel they run off may be flammable, poisonous, corrosive or cryogenic. They also suffer from poor efficiency. For these reasons, rocket engines are only used when absolutely necessary.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
Electric motors are used in motor vehicles, electric bicycles, electric scooters, small boats, subways, trains, trolleybuses, trams and experimental aircraft. Electric motors can be very efficient, over 90% efficiency is common.NEMA Design B electric motor standard, cited in Electrical Motor Efficiency Retrieved 2011-07-22. Electric motors can also be built powerful, reliable, low-maintenance and of arbitrary size. Electric motors can deliver a range of speeds and torques without necessarily using a gearbox (although it may be more economic to use one). Electric motors are limited in their use chiefly by the difficulty of supplying electricity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
Compressed gas motors have been used on some vehicles experimentally. They are simple, efficient, safe, cheap, reliable and operate in a variety of conditions. One of the difficulties encountered when using gas motors is the cooling effect of expanding gas. These engines are limited by how quickly they absorb heat from their surroundings.[ref]
[tpl]cite web| title = Pneumatic Engine| publisher = Quasiturbine| url = http://sites.google.com/site/quasiturbines/enginetypes/etypepneumatic| accessdate = 2011-07-22[/tpl][/ref] The cooling effect can, however, double as air conditioning. Compressed gas motors also lose effectiveness with falling gas pressure.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
Ion thrusters are used on some satellites and spacecraft. They are only effective in a vacuum, which limits their use to spaceborne vehicles. Ion thrusters run primarily off electricity but they also need a propellant such as caesium or more recently xenon.[tpl]cite web| title = Fact Sheet| publisher = NASA| url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs08grc.html| accessdate = 2011-07-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title = NASA – Innovative Engines| publisher = Boeing, Xenon Ion Propulsion Center| url = http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/xips/xips.html| accessdate = 2011-07-22[/tpl] Ion thrusters can achieve extremely high speeds and use little propellant however the are power hungry too. Most ion thrusters built today have small thrusts.[tpl]cite web| title = Frequently asked questions about ion propulsion| publisher = NASA| url = http://nmp.nasa.gov/ds1/tech/ionpropfaq.html| accessdate = 2011-07-22[/tpl]

===Converting energy to work===

The mechanical energy that motors and engines produce must be converted to work by wheels, propellers, nozzles, or similar means. 
Aside from converting mechanical energy into motions, wheels allow a vehicle to roll along a surface and, with the exception of railed vehicles, to steer.[tpl]cite web| title = How Car Steering Works| work = HowStuffWorks| publisher = HowStuffWorks| url = http://www.howstuffworks.com/steering.htm| accessdate = 2011-07-23[/tpl] Wheels are ancient technology, with specimens being discovered from over 5000 years ago.[tpl]cite web |title = World's Oldest Wheel Found in Slovenia| url = http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_relations/background_information/culture/worlds_oldest_wheel_found_in_slovenia/|date=March 2003| publisher = Government Communication Office of the Republic of Slovenia| author=Alexander Gasser| accessdate = 2011-07-23[/tpl] Wheels are used in a plethora of vehicles, including motor vehicles, armoured personnel carriers, amphibious vehicles, airplanes, trains, skateboards and wheelbarrows.
Nozzles are used in conjunction with almost all reaction engines.[tpl]cite web| title = Nozzles| publisher = NASA| url = http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/nozzle.html| accessdate = 2011-07-22[/tpl] Vehicles using nozzles include jet aircraft, rockets and personal watercraft.  While most nozzles take the shape of a cone or bell, some unorthodox designs have been created such as the aerospike. Some nozzles are intangible, such as the electromagnetic field nozzle of a vectored ion thruster.[tpl]cite web| title = LTI-20 Flight Dynamics| publisher = Lightcraft Technologies International| url = http://www.lightcrafttechnologies.com/rpi_www/technical/flight_dynamics.html| accessdate = 2011-07-22| quote = The ion thrusters use electromagnetic fields to vector the engine exhaust[/tpl]
Continuous tracks are sometimes used instead of wheels to power land vehicles. Continuous tracks have the advantage of a larger contact area, easy repairs on small damage and high maneuverability.[tpl]cite web| title = Week 04 – Continuous Track| publisher = Military Times| url = http://militarytimes.com/blogs/warrior-made/innovations/continuous-track/| accessdate = 2011-07-23[/tpl] Examples of vehicles using continuous tracks include tanks, snowmobiles and excavators. Two continuous tracks used together allow for steering. The largest vehicle in the world,[tpl]cite web| title = The Biggest (and Hungriest) Machines| publisher = Dark Roasted Blend| url = http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2006/11/biggest-and-hungriest-machines.html| accessdate = 2011-07-23[/tpl] the Bagger 288 is propelled by continuous tracks.
Propellers (as well as screws, fans and rotors) are used to move through a fluid. Propellers have been used as toys since ancient times, however it was Leonardo da Vinci who devised what was one of the earliest propeller driven vehicles vehicles, the "aerial-screw".[tpl]cite web| title = Early Helicopter Technology| publisher = U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission| url = http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Rotary/early_helicopters/HE1.htm| accessdate = 2011-07-23[/tpl] In 1661, Toogood & Hays adopted the screw for use as a ship propeller.[tpl]cite web| title = Brief History of Screw Development| publisher = Rod Sampson – School of Marine Science and Technology, Newcastle University| format = PDF| page = 10| url = http://research.ncl.ac.uk/cavitation/archive/MAR2010%20-%20propeller%20history.pdf| accessdate = 2011-07-23 |date=5 February 2008 [/tpl] Since then, the propeller has been tested on many terrestrial vehicles, including the Schienenzeppelin train and numerous cars.[tpl]cite web| title = Cars with Propellers: an Illustrated Overview| publisher = Dark Roasted Blend| url = http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2008/12/cars-with-propellers-essential.html| accessdate = 2011-07-23[/tpl] In modern times, propellers are most prevalent on watercraft and aircraft, as well as some amphibious vehicles such as hovercraft and ground effect vehicles. Intuitively, propellers cannot work in space as there is no working fluid, however some sources have suggested that since space is never empty, a propeller could be made to work in space.[tpl]cite web| title = Vacuum Propellers| author = John Walker| publisher = Fourmilab Switzerland| url = http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/vprop/| accessdate = 2011-07-23[/tpl]
Similarly to propellered vehicles, some vehicles use wings for propulsion. Sailboats and sailplanes are propelled by the forward component of lift generated by their sails/wings.[tpl]cite web| title = How Sailboats Move in the Water| work = HowStuffWorks| publisher = HowStuffWorks| url = http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/water-sports/sailboat3.htm| accessdate = 2011-08-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title = Three Forces on a Glider| work = NASA| publisher = NASA| url = http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/glidfor.html| accessdate = 2011-08-02[/tpl] Ornithopters also produce thrust aerodynamically. Ornithopters with large rounded leading edges produce lift by leading-edge suction forces.[tpl]cite web| title = How It Works| work = Project Ornithopter, University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies| publisher = Project Ornithopter, University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies| url = http://www.ornithopter.net/how_it_works_e.html| accessdate = 2011-08-02[/tpl]
Paddle wheels are used on some older watercraft and their reconstructions. These ships were known as paddle steamers. Because paddle wheels simply push off the water, their design and construction is very simple. The oldest such ship in scheduled service is the Skibladner.[tpl]cite web| title = Skibladner: the world's oldest paddle steamer| work = Skibladner| publisher = Skibladner| url = http://www.skibladner.no/engelsk/index.htm| accessdate = 2011-08-02[/tpl] Many pedalo boats also use paddle wheels for propulsion.
Screw-propelled vehicles are propelled by auger-like cylinders fitted with helical flanges. Because they can produce thrust on both land and water, they are commonly used on all-terrain vehicles. The ZiL-2906 was a Soviet designed screw-propelled vehicle that was meant to retrieve cosmonauts from the Siberian wilderness.[tpl]cite web| title = Véhicules Insolites (Strange Vehicles)| language = French| author = Jean Pierre Dardinier| publisher = Fédération Française des Groupes de Conservation de Véhicules Militaires| url = http://mvcgfrance.org/vzil.htm| accessdate = 2011-07-23[/tpl]

===Friction===

All or almost all of the energy added by the engine is usually lost as friction; so minimising frictional losses are very important in many vehicles. The main sources of friction are rolling friction and fluid drag (air drag or water drag).[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
Wheels have low bearing friction and pneumatic tyres give low rolling friction. Steel wheels on steel tracks are lower still.[tpl]cite web|last=Nice |first=Karim |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/tire4.htm |title=HowStuffWorks – How Tires Work |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2000-09-19 |accessdate=2013-01-08[/tpl]
Air drag can be minimised with aerodynamic features.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]

==Control==

===Steering===

Most vehicles, with the notable exception of railed vehicles, have at least one steering mechanism. Wheeled vehicles steer by angling their front or rear[tpl]cite web| title = The Reason for Rear-Wheel Steering| work = ThrustSSC Team| publisher = ThrustSSC Team| url = http://www.thrustssc.com/thrustssc/Engineering/rearster.html| accessdate = 2011-08-08[/tpl] wheels. The B-52 Stratofortress has a special arrangement where all four main wheels can be angled.[tpl]cite web| title = B-52 Stratofortress Design| work = Globalsecurity.org| publisher = Globalsecurity.org| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/b-52-design.htm| accessdate = 2011-08-08[/tpl] Skids can also be used to steer by angling them, as in the case of a snowmobile. Ships, boats, submarines, dirigibles and airplanes usually have a rudder for steering. On an airplane, a rudder is used in conjunction with ailerons for directional control.

===Stopping===

With no power, most vehicles come to a stop due to friction. In many cases however, it may be desirable to stop a vehicle faster than it otherwise would. For this reason almost all vehicles are equipped with a braking system. Wheeled vehicles are typically equipped with friction brakes, which use the friction between brake pads (stators) and brake rotors to slow the vehicle. Many airplanes have high performance versions of the same systems in their landing gear for use on the ground. A Boeing 757 brake, for example, has 3 stators and 4 rotors.[tpl]cite web| title = Flight Crew Training Manual – Brake Units| work = Boeing| publisher = Biggles-Software| url = http://www.biggles-software.com/software/757_tech/landing_gear/brake_units.htm| accessdate = 2011-08-07[/tpl] The Space Shuttle also uses frictional brakes on its wheels.[tpl]cite web| title = Landing gear system| date = 31 August 2000| publisher = NASA| url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-gear.html| accessdate = 2011-08-07[/tpl] On top of frictional brakes, hybrid/electric cars, trolly buses and electric bicycles can also use regenerative brakes to recycle some of the vehicle's potential energy. High-speed trains sometimes use frictionless Eddy-current brakes, however widespread application of the technology has been limited by overheating and interference issues.[tpl]cite news| title = Eddy-current braking: a long road to success| author = Jennifer Schykowski| date = 2 June 2008| newspaper = Railway Gazette| url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-gear.html| accessdate = 2011-08-07[/tpl]
Aside from landing gear brakes, most large aircraft have other ways of decelerating. In the context of aircraft, air brakes are aerodynamic surfaces that create friction with the airflow causing the vehicle to slow. These are usually implemented as flaps that oppose airflow when extended and are flush with aircraft when retracted. Reverse thrust is also a feature of many airplane engines. Propeller aircraft implement reverse thrust by reversing the pitch of the propellers, while jet aircraft implement it by redirecting their engine exhaust forward.[tpl]cite web| title = Thrust Reversing| work = Purdue University| publisher = Purdue University| url = https://engineering.purdue.edu/~propulsi/propulsion/jets/basics/reverse.html| accessdate = 2011-08-07[/tpl] On aircraft carriers, arresting gears are used to stop an aircraft instead of the above methods. Pilots may even apply full throttle on touchdown in case the arresting gear doesn't catch and a go around is needed.[tpl]cite web| title = How to land a jet plane on an aircraft carrier| author = ring_wraith| publisher = Everything2| url = http://everything2.com/title/How+to+land+a+jet+plane+on+an+aircraft+carrier| accessdate = 2011-08-07[/tpl]
Parachutes are used to slow down vehicles traveling at very high speeds. Parachutes have been used in land, air and space vehicles such as the ThrustSSC, Eurofighter Typhoon and Apollo Command Module. Some older Soviet passenger jets had braking parachutes for emergency landings.[tpl]cite web| title = Aircraft Museum – Tu-124| work = Aerospaceweb.org| publisher = Aerospaceweb.org| url = http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/jetliner/tu124/| accessdate = 2011-08-07[/tpl] Boats use similar devices called sea anchors to maintain stability in rough seas.
To further increase the rate of deceleration or where the brakes have failed, several mechanisms can be used to stop a vehicle. Automobiles and rolling stock usually have parking brakes that, while to designed to secure an already parked vehicle, can provide limited braking ability should the primary brakes fail.  A secondary procedure called forward-slip is sometimes used to slow airplanes by flying at an angle, incurring more drag.

==Legislation==

Motor vehicle and trailer categories are defined according to the following international classification:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/rf/DEFINITION_OF_VEHICLE_CATEGORIES.pdf |title=ACEA.be |publisher=ACEA.be |date= |accessdate=2013-01-08[/tpl]

===European Union===

In the European Union the classifications for vehicle types are defined by:[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/s06021.htm |title=Scadplus: Technical Harmonisation For Motor Vehicles |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-01-08[/tpl]
European Community, is based on the Community's WVTA (whole vehicle type-approval) system. Under this system, manufacturers can obtain certification for a vehicle type in one Member State if it meets the EC technical requirements and then market it EU-wide with no need for further tests. Total technical harmonization already has been achieved in three vehicle categories (passenger cars, motorcycles, and tractors) and soon will extend to other vehicle categories (coaches and utility vehicles). It is essential that European car manufacturers be ensured access to as large a market as possible.
While the Community type-approval system allows manufacturers to benefit fully from internal market opportunities, worldwide technical harmonization in the context of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) offers a market beyond European borders.

===Licensing===

In many cases, it is unlawful to operate a vehicle without a license or certification. The least strict form of regulation usually limits what passengers the driver may carry or prohibits them completely (e.g., a Canadian ultra-light license without endorsementsTransport Canada (1 June 2010). "Canadian Aviation Regulations, Part IV – Personnel Licensing and Training, Subpart 1 – Flight Crew Permits, Licences and Ratings". Retrieved 2011-07-21). The next level of licensing may allow passengers, but without any form of compensation or payment. A private driver's license usually has these conditions. Commercial licenses that allow the transport of passengers and cargo are more tightly regulated. The most strict form of licensing is generally reserved for school buses, hazardous materials transports and emergency vehicles.
The driver of a motor vehicle is typically required to hold a valid driver's license while driving on public lands, whereas the pilot of an aircraft must have a license at all times, regardless of where in the jurisdiction the aircraft is flying.

===Registration===

Vehicles are often required to be registered. Registration may be for purely legal reasons, for insurance reasons or to help law enforcement recover stolen vehicles. The Toronto Police Service, for example, offers free and optional bicycle registration online.https://webapp1.torontopolice.on.ca/BicycleRegistry/Submit Retrieved 2011-07-21 On motor vehicles, registration often takes the form of a vehicle registration plate, which makes it easy to identify a vehicle. In Russia, trucks and buses have their license plate numbers repeated in large black letters on the back.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] On aircraft, a similar system is used where a tail number is painted on various surfaces. Like motor vehicles and aircraft, watercraft also have registration numbers in most jurisdictions, however the vessel name is still the primary means of identification  as has been the case since ancient times. For this reason, duplicate registration names are generally rejected. In Ontario, boats with an engine power of [tpl]convert|10|hp|kW|1|abbr=on[/tpl] or greater require registration,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/boats/pleasurecraft.shtml |title=Retrieved 2011-07-21 |publisher=Servicecanada.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-01-08[/tpl] leading to the ubiquitous "[tpl]convert|9.9|hp|kW|1|abbr=on[/tpl]" engine.
Registration may be conditional on the vehicle being approved for use on public highways, as in the case of the UK[tpl]cite web| title = The Individual Vehicle Approval scheme| publisher = Directgov| url = http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/BuyingAndSellingAVehicle/ImportingAndExportingAVehicle/DG_177879| accessdate = 2011-07-22[/tpl] and Ontario.[tpl]cite web| title = Licensing a Vehicle in Ontario| publisher = Ministry of Transportation of Ontario| url = http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/vehicle/register.shtml| accessdate = 2011-07-22[/tpl] Many US states also have requirements for vehicles operating on public highways.US state law, cited in Detailed Vehicle Equipment Laws by State Retrieved 2011-07-22 Aircraft have more stringent requirements, as they pose a high risk of damage to people and property in event of an accident.

===Mandatory safety equipment===

In many jurisdictions, the operator of a vehicle is legally obligated to carry safety equipment with or on them. Common examples include seat belts in cars, helmets on motorcycles and bicycles, fire extinguishers on boats, buses and airplanes and life jackets on boats and commercial aircraft. Passenger aircraft carry a great deal of safety equipment including inflatable slides are rafts, oxygen masks, oxygen tanks, life jackets, satellite beacons and first aid kits. Some equipment such as life jackets has led to debate regarding their usefulness. In the case of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961, the life jackets saved many people but also led to many deaths when passengers inflated their vests prematurely.

==Right-of-way==

There are specific real-estate arrangements made to allow vehicles to travel from one place to another. The most common such arrangements are public highways, where appropriately licensed vehicles can navigate without hindrance. These highways are on public land and are maintained by the government. Similarly, toll routes are open to the public after paying a toll. These routes and the land they rest on may be government or privately owned or a combination of both. Some routes are privately owned but grant access to the public. These routes often have a warning sign stating that the government does not maintain the way. An example of this are byways in England and Wales. In Scotland, land is open to un-motorized vehicles if the land meets certain criteria. Public land is sometimes open to use by off-road vehicles. On US public land, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) decides where vehicles may be used. Railways often pass over land not owned by the railway company. The right to this land is granted to the railway company through mechanisms such as easement. Watercraft are generally allowed to navigate public waters without restriction as long as they don't cause a disturbance. Passing through a lock, however, may require paying a toll. Despite the common law tradition Cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos of owning all the air above one's property, the US supreme court ruled that aircraft in the US have the right to use air above someone else's property without their consent. While the same rule generally applies in all jurisdictions, some countries such as Cuba and Russia have taken advantage of air rights on a national level to earn money.[ref]

This is called prohibited airspace. Prohibited airspace is usually strictly enforced due to potential damage from espionage or attack. In the case of Korean Air Lines Flight 007, the airliner entered prohibited airspace over Soviet territory and was shot down as it was leaving.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]

==Safety==

For a comparison of transportation fatality rates, see: Air safety statistics.
Several different metrics used to compare and evaluate the safety of different vehicles. The main three are deaths per billion passenger-journeys, deaths per billion passenger-hours and deaths per billion passenger-kilometers.
