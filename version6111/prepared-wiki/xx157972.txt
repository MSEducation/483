Poetry is Khalish's passion. Though he thanks his construction business for providing him with the luxuries of life, it is at a poetic soiree that Khalish comes into his own."
He was born in 1935 in the state of Punjab, India. He graduated from Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya (also called Indore University) with a degree in civil engineering, but prior to that he obtained his first degree from Aligarh Muslim University.[tpl]Citation needed|date= June 2012[/tpl] His late father Shri Mohan Lal Bhayana, an Urdu scholar himself, advised him to study Urdu literature.[tpl]Citation needed|date= June 2012[/tpl] After joining Aligarh Muslim University, he mastered the Urdu language and Urdu literature and poetry.
