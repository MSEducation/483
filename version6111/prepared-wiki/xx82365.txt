Lee's Ferry (also known as Lees Ferry, Lee Ferry, Little Colorado Station and Saints Ferry[tpl]cite gnis|id=6959|name=Lees Ferry (historical)|entrydate=1980-02-08|accessdate=2013-01-05[/tpl]) is a site on the Colorado River in Coconino County, Arizona in the United States, about [tpl]convert|7.5|mi|km[/tpl] southwest of Page and [tpl]convert|9|mi|km[/tpl] south of the Utah-Arizona border.
Due to its unique geography – the only place in hundreds of miles from which one can easily access the Colorado River – it historically served as an important river crossing and starting in the mid-1800s was the site of a ferry operated by John Doyle Lee, for whom it is named. Boat service at Lee's Ferry continued for over 60 years before being superseded by a bridge in the early 20th century, which allowed for much more efficient automobile travel.
Lee's Ferry has also served as a military outpost for 19th century Mormon Utah, a center of limited gold seeking and since the 1920s the principal point at which river flow is measured to determine water allocations in the [tpl]convert|246000|mi2|km2|sing=on[/tpl] Colorado River basin. Today it is a well-known fishing and boat launching point, including for whitewater rafting trips through the Grand Canyon.

==Geography and geology==

Lee's Ferry is located in northern Arizona, at the point where the Paria River joins the Colorado from the north. Lying in an open valley directly downstream of Glen Canyon and shortly above Marble Canyon (the uppermost section of the Grand Canyon), it is the only place in more than [tpl]convert|260|mi|km[/tpl] where the Colorado is not hemmed in by sheer canyon walls, and was an important crossing point before the construction of Navajo and Glen Canyon Bridges in the 20th century.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.desertusa.com/colorado/leeferry/du_leeferry.html |title= Lee's Ferry: Crossing the Colorado River |publisher= DesertUSA |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] Here, the Colorado River is also much smoother and calmer than the stretches that lie above and below, with the exception of the former Glen Canyon reach that is now flooded under Lake Powell, formed by Glen Canyon Dam [tpl]convert|16|mi|km[/tpl] upstream. Lee's Ferry is designated within the southwesternmost extreme of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and is considered the northernmost end of Grand Canyon National Park.[tpl]cite map |publisher= ACME Mapper |title= USGS Topo Maps for United States |year= |cartography= United States Geological Survey |accessdate= 2013-01-04 |url= http://mapper.acme.com/[/tpl]
The surrounding valley formed because of a swell in the underlying rock of the Colorado Plateau that causes the regional elevation to intersect the Chinle and Moenkopi Formations, deposited in the Triassic about 208–245 million years ago.

==History==

===Early inhabitants and explorers===

In pre-Columbian times, the Lee's Ferry area was inhabited first by Paleo-Indians, who populated the region beginning about 11,500 years ago, and the Archaic culture, which established on the Colorado Plateau about 8,000 years ago.[tpl]cite web |url= http://cpluhna.nau.edu/People/paleoindians.htm |title= Paleoindian and Archaic Peoples |publisher= Northern Arizona University |work= Land Use History of North America |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] The Anasazi, Paiute and Navajo peoples, which have left more evidence of habitation in the valley, arrived only in the last 1,000 years or so.[tpl]cite web |url= http://cpluhna.nau.edu/Places/lees_ferry2.htm |title= Lees Ferry: The Earliest Years |publisher= Northern Arizona University |work= Land Use History of North America |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] Evidence exists that the Anasazi utilized the area sometime in the 1100s A.D., including the discovery of two ruins nearby on the Paria River. Indigenous peoples generally did not use the Lee's Ferry area and other canyon stretches of the Colorado River, preferring the open plains above for hunting. However, Lee's Ferry did later become a disputed territory between the Navajos and Paiutes, who recognized it as a valuable livestock watering point.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.azheritagewaters.nau.edu/loc_leesferry.html |title= Lees Ferry |publisher= Northern Arizona University |work= Arizona Heritage Waters |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl]
The first Europeans who happened upon Lee's Ferry were members of the Dominguez-Escalante Expedition, an attempt to find an overland route through the Southwest between Spanish settlements in present-day New Mexico and California and to convert as many Southwestern Native Americans as possible to Christianity.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/escalante-and-dominguez-begin-expedition |title= July 29, 1776: Escalante and Dominguez begin expedition |publisher= History.com |work= This Day In History |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] In late 1776, the party ran out of supplies in what is now southern Utah and having decided to turn back towards Santa Fe, had to find a way to cross the Colorado River.[tpl]cite web |url= http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/trappers,_traders,_and_explorers/dominguez-escalanteexpedition.html |author= Alexander, Thomas G. |title= Dominguez-Escalante Expedition |publisher= Utah History To Go |date= |work= Utah, The Right Place |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] Their Native American guides told them of two regional fords of the river, one at the site of Lee's Ferry and another at Glen Canyon. When the explorers arrived at Lee's Ferry in October, they found the river too wide and deep and had no choice but to head for the second ford more than [tpl]convert|40|mi|km[/tpl] upstream. Almost two weeks later they successfully crossed the river, and made it back to Santa Fe on January 2, 1777.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.arizonascenicroads.com/northern/fredonia_vermillion_words_from_the_road_4.html |title= Dominguez-Escalante |publisher= Arizona Scenic Roads |work= Fredonia-Vermillion Cliffs Scenic Road – Words from the Road |authors= Aleshire, Peter |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] This point, now submerged under Lake Powell, is named Crossing of the Fathers after Francisco Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, the two Franciscan priests who headed the expedition.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/explorers/sitea28.htm |title= Crossing of the Fathers (lost site) |publisher= U.S. National Park Service |work= Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings |date= 2005-03-22 |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl]
During the 19th century Lee's Ferry served as a gateway for the expansion of white settlement from Utah south into Arizona. Most of the settlers were Mormons, who had been long established in the Utah Valley near present-day Salt Lake City and were now looking for greener pastures.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nps.gov/glca/planyourvisit/lees-ferry.htm |title= Lees Ferry |publisher= U.S. National Park Service |work= Glen Canyon National Recreation Area |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] Although the river at Lee's Ferry is too deep to ford for most of the year, its relatively calm current presented an attractive site for crossing by boat. Jacob Hamblin successfully crossed the river here in 1864, and during the next few years the Mormon presence swelled to the scale of a small military outpost (Fort Meeks) in order to defend against Navajo raids. However, these works eventually fell into disrepair; as a result of not being able to sustain themselves in the valley.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nps.gov/glca/historyculture/leesferryhistory.htm |title= Lees Ferry History |publisher= U.S. National Park Service |work= Glen Canyon National Recreation Area |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl]

===John D. Lee and the ferry (1870–76)===

John D. Lee, for who Lee's Ferry is now named, came to the crossing in 1870 with the goal of setting up a permanent ferry service for Mormon settlers heading south to Arizona. In 1857, Lee had partaken in the Mountain Meadows Massacre, in which a group of Mormons and Native Americans attacked a passing non-Mormon wagon train from Arkansas, killing about 120 people. The ill-conceived attack was the result of animosity toward Arkansans after the murder of Mormon apostle Parley P. Pratt near Van Buren, Ark. Years after the massacre, the LDS church sent Lee to the remote Colorado River crossing to shield him from the law as part of an attempted cover-up.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-g-turner/mountain-meadows-massacre-revisisted_b_1962285.html |title= The Mountain Meadows Massacre Revisited |publisher= Huffington Post |author= Turner, John G. |date= 2012-10-18 |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl]
Lee arrived in September with two of his wives and his children, and created a small settlement named Lonely Dell. The ferry was formally established in January 1873, with the launching of the Colorado, the first of many boats that would ply the treacherous and fluctuating river at this point. The location of the ferry upstream from the Paria River confluence required passengers to traverse a dangerous incline nicknamed "Lee's Backbone" on their ascent up the south wall of the valley.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.gcrg.org/bqr/17-1/inscriptions.html |title= Historic Inscriptions at Lee's Ferry |publisher= Grand Canyon River Guides |work= |author= Knipmeter, Jim |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] Four years later, Lee was finally arrested by the U.S. government and tried for his role in the massacre. Found guilty, he was executed by firing squad at Mountain Meadows on March 28, 1877 – the sole scapegoat for the more than fifty Latter-day Saints and Native American men that had participated in the massacre—with almost certain direction from the highest officials of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[tpl]cite web |url= http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mountainmeadows/leeexecution.html |title= Last Words and the Execution of John D.

Lee |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl]

===Later years, 1877–1929===

After Lee's death, his wife Emma continued to operate the ferry for two years, in 1878 establishing an alternative ferry route below the confluence of the Paria River that allowed travelers to avoid the infamous Lee's Backbone segment. However, this route could not be used in the summer months due to dangerous high water levels from snowmelt. In 1879, the LDS Church bought the ferry and transferred its operation to Warren Marshall Johnson and family. In 1896 the ferry was transferred to Jim Emett, who installed a cable across the Colorado River to reduce the risk of boats washing downstream during high water.[tpl]cite web |url= http://cpluhna.nau.edu/Places/lees_ferry3.htm |title= The "Ferry" of Lees Ferry |publisher= Northern Arizona University |work= Land Use History of North America |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl]
During this time, Lee's Ferry and surrounds also attracted people after a series of gold strikes in southern Utah, beginning with Cass Hite, a prospector who discovered gold in Glen Canyon in 1883.[tpl]cite web |url= http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/mining_and_railroads/minorgoldrushesmajorgoldproduction.html |title= Minor Gold Rushes, Major Gold Production |publisher= Utah History To Go |author= Murphy, Miriam B. |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] Gold seekers came to the area as early as 1889, when two Mormon prospectors by the names of Holladay and Huntington began to explore the surrounds of Lees Ferry. The most extravagant investment was a full-scale mining operation led by Charles H. Spencer, head of the American Placer Company, who came to Lee's Ferry in 1910 planning to extract gold from the Chinle Formation.[tpl]cite web |url= http://grandcanyonhistory.clas.asu.edu/sites_coloradorivercorridor_leesferry.html |title= Lees Ferry |publisher= Arizona State University |work= Nature, Culture and History at the Grand Canyon |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] Spencer brought in tons of equipment including a [tpl]convert|92|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] steamboat, the Charles H. Spencer, reputedly the largest vessel ever to sail on the Colorado River upstream of the Grand Canyon.[tpl]cite web |url= http://cpluhna.nau.edu/Places/lees_ferry4.htm |title= 20th Century Land Use |publisher= Northern Arizona University |work= Land Use History of North America |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] The operation was a dismal failure, and Spencer left, broke, in 1912. The steamboat sank in 1921 and now lies in pieces along the Colorado from Glen Canyon to below Lee's Ferry.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nps.gov/archeology/sites/stateSubmerged/arizona.htm |title= Archeology Program |publisher= U.S. National Park Service |work= State Submerged Resources – Arizona |date= 2009-10-28 |accessdate=2013-01-04[/tpl]
The ferry itself continued to run until 1928; in 1929 the first Navajo Bridge was completed at a location four miles (6.4 km) downstream and allowed for far more efficient road travel between Utah and Arizona.[tpl]cite web |url= http://enpub.fulton.asu.edu/structures/SlideCollection/ThumbNails/Navajo%20Bridge%20Project.htm |title= Navajo Bridge Project |author= Rowland, Scott |publisher= Arizona State University |work= Fulton School of Engineering |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] Somewhat ironically, the ferry was instrumental in transporting materials for the bridge – at least until June 1928, when the ferryboat capsized, drowning three men and a Ford Model T. The ferry was never replaced, and the bridge was completed seven months later, relegating Lee's Ferry from a crowded transportation hub to a quiet backwater.

==Water rights==

Since August 1921, Lee's Ferry has been the site of a stream gage operated by the U.S. Geological Survey and has since accumulated one of the most extensive streamflow records ever made in the United States. The river flow here is the principal factor in allocating water to the seven U.S. and two Mexican states in the Colorado River basin. The Colorado River Compact of 1922 apportioned an equal portion of the river's flow to the Upper Basin (the U.S. states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming and northern Arizona) and the Lower Basin (Arizona, California and Nevada) each, with the individual "basins" divided by an imaginary line at Lee's Ferry.DeBuys 2011, p. 139
Including a later 1944 treaty with Mexico guaranteeing that country most of the remaining water in the river, the total allocations ran up to 16.5 million acre feet (20.3 km3), which was believed to be the natural flow of the Colorado River based on early observations at Lee's Ferry and other gages along the river.[tpl]cite web |url= http://treeflow.info/lees/gage.html |title= The Lees Ferry gaged flow record |publisher= TreeFlow |work= Colorado River Streamflow: A Paleo Perspective |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] To fully utilize these allocations and prevent water from "wasting" to the ocean, the U.S. federal government constructed a number of large storage dams on the Colorado River system.[tpl]cite web |url= http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2012/finalwebsite/problem/coloradoriver.shtml |title= Colorado River |publisher= Massachusetts Institute of Technology |work= Mission 2012: Clean Water |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] The canyon country around Lee's Ferry was considered for the site of the first dam, but was abandoned in favor of a site lower on the Colorado, in which Hoover Dam was completed in 1936.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.usbr.gov/projects//ImageServer?imgName=Doc_1232657383034.pdf |title= Glen Canyon Unit |author= Rogers, Jedediah |publisher= U.S. Bureau of Reclamation |year= 2006 |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] In the 1960s, the area was again investigated as part of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Colorado River Storage Project, culminating in the construction of Glen Canyon Dam in 1966.[tpl]cite web |url= https://www.wapa.gov/crsp/planprojectscrsp/crspproj.html |title= Colorado River Storage Project |publisher= Western Area Power Administration |work= CRSP Management Center |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] The filling of the resulting Lake Powell of 24.3 million acre feet (30.0 km3) inundated the Crossing of the Fathers, Charles Spencer's old mining operation and other historic landmarks of the area. Flood control at Glen Canyon also smoothed out the seasonal flux of the Colorado River that so beleaguered the ferry operations at Lee's Ferry in the past.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_rm/rm_gtr120/rm_gtr120_076_080.pdf |title= Glen Canyon Dam, Fluctuating Water Levels, and Riparian Breeding Birds: The Need for Management Compromise on the Colorado River in Grand Canyon |publisher= U.S. Forest Service |author= Brown, Bryan T.; Johnson, R, Roy |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl]
Lee's Ferry has long been a focal point of American Southwest water disputes, and has been called "both the physical and spiritual heart of water history in the arid West".[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.gcrg.org/docs/gtslib/kupel-02.pdf |title= Lee’s Ferry, Revisited |author= Kupel, Doug |publisher= Grand Canyon River Guides |work= |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-03[/tpl] From the 1940s onward, Colorado River flows were found to average significantly less than what was allocated under the two treaties, and 21st century studies have postulated that the actual sustainable flow past Lee's Ferry is between 13.5 and 14.7 million acre feet (16.7–18.1 km3), creating water supply issues for the river basin.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.swhydro.arizona.edu/archive/V4_N2/feature4.pdf |title= Colorado River Water Supplies: Back to the Future |author= Kuhn, Eric |publisher= University of Arizona |work= Southwest Hydrology, Vol. 4, No. 2 |date= March 2005 |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl]DeBuys 2011, p. 141

==Lee's Ferry today==

Lee's Ferry is considered the official beginning of Grand Canyon National Park on the Colorado River and is used as a fishing area and river rafting launch site. The main access is by Lees Ferry Road, which splits off from U.S. Route 89 at the hamlet of Marble Canyon, Arizona, on the west side of the Navajo Bridges. The Lonely Dell Ranch Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and expanded to include Lee's Ferry in 1997, features several buildings built during and after John D. Lee's brief tenure at the site along with some remnants of the Charles H. Spencer. The area is managed by the National Park Service within the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area as a historical site.
Lee's Ferry is the principal starting point for whitewater rafting trips through the Grand Canyon, which are said to offer "a trip backwards through time" as the river cuts through progressively older strata.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.geology.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Volume-15-Part-5-1968.pdf |title= Guidebook to the Colorado River, Part 1: Lee's Ferry to Phantom Ranch in Grand Canyon National Park |publisher= Brigham Young University Department of Geology |work= Studies for Students |author= Hamblin, W. Kenneth; Rigby, J. Keith |date= 1968-10-01 |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] The majority of trips are run by dedicated commercial rafting enterprises using both paddle and motorized inflatable rafts to carry large parties of tourists on the river (up to 24 passengers per raft) with most trips lasting one week to ten days. Some trips travel all the way to Lake Mead some [tpl]convert|277|mi|km[/tpl] downstream and can last several weeks.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/whitewater-rafting.htm |title= River Trips/Permits |publisher= U.S. National Park Service |work= Grand Canyon National Park |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] Permits for private trips are no longer backlogged on an extensive waiting list, but instead based on a lottery system.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.gadling.com/2009/11/30/rafting-the-grand-canyon-adventure-of-a-lifetime/ |title= Rafting the Grand Canyon: Adventure of a lifetime |author= Rhein, Jamie |publisher= Gadling |work= |date= 2009-11-30 |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] All but the most experienced rapid runners are discouraged from this potentially dangerous trip.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/overview-lees-ferry-diamond-ck.htm |title= 12 to 25 Day Noncommercial River Trips: Lees Ferry to Diamond Creek |publisher= U.S. National Park Service |work= Grand Canyon National Park |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl]
Trips upstream from the nearby Paria Riffle may be made without special permit (other than a day use boating fee) and users may travel [tpl]convert|16|mi|km[/tpl] upstream on calm waters to the foot of Glen Canyon Dam.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nps.gov/glca/planyourvisit/kayaking.htm |title= Kayaking |publisher= U.S. National Park Service |work= Glen Canyon National Recreation Area |date= |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl] This reach of the Colorado River is also well known for its status as a Blue Ribbon fishery, thanks to releases of cold, clear water from Glen Canyon Dam that make conditions ideal for introduced rainbow trout.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.gcdamp.gov/fs/LeesFTF.pdf |title= Lees Ferry Trout Fishery |publisher= Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program |date= December 2010 |accessdate= 2013-01-04[/tpl]

===In film===

Irvin Willat and a cast and crew of 200 people used Lee's Ferry during the filming of Heritage of the Plains (1924)."Picture Filmed Under Severe Difficulties." St. Petersburg Evening Independent. February 18. 1924 p 6. Web. October 15. 2013
Scenes from the movie Into the Wild (based on the book by Jon Krakauer) were shot on location at the Lee's Ferry National Park Service Station, which featured actors Emile Hirsch as Christopher McCandless and Steven Wiig as the Lee's Ferry Ranger, Steve Koehler.
