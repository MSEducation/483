"Preacher Man" is a song recorded by English girl group Bananarama.  It appears on the group's fifth studio album Pop Life and was released as the album's second single.  The track was co-written and produced by Youth with additional production and remix by Shep Pettibone.
"Tripping on Your Love" had been originally slated as the second single from the album, and some promotional singles of the song were sent to radios in late 1990. Around this time, however, group member Sara Dallin contracted meningitis, which delayed the release of the single some months. When recovered, London Records decided "Preacher Man" was a better choice for a single and so it was chosen for release in December 1990. "Tripping on Your Love" was eventually released as the album's fourth single. 
The pop/dance tune became the highest-charting and biggest-selling single released from the Pop Life album, climbing to number twenty in the UK singles chart.  The single was Bananarama's last appearance in the UK top twenty until "Move in My Direction" in 2005.  It briefly appeared in the Australian Kent Report chart, peaking at 100, but did not enter the 'official' Australian ARIA Chart top 100.  "Preacher Man" was not released in the United States.

==Music video==

The music video featured a man tied to a chair in the interrogation room of a prison. As he breaks down and goes crazy, the girls, as well as various other carnival-like costumed entertainers such as a midget and a girl in a winged outfit, appear as hallucinations before him. These scenes are intercut with the girls performing the song in front of candles. Harmonica player Johnny Mars appears on the video.[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p19170/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Johnny Mars|author=Richard Skelly |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=October 30, 2011[/tpl]
