[[Hydrogen safety]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrogen

Hydrogen safety covers the safe production, handling and use of hydrogen. Hydrogen poses unique challenges due to its ease of leaking, low-energy ignition, wide range of combustible fuel-air mixtures, buoyancy, and its ability to embrittle metals that must be accounted for to ensure safe operation. Liquid hydrogen poses additional challenges due to its increased density and the extremely low temperatures needed to keep it in liquid form.
Hydrogen is used as a feedstock in industrial processes including production of ammonia and methanol, and cooling electric generators in power stations.

==Summary==

Although hydrogen has many useful properties, some have serious safety implications:
On the other hand, in the context of safety, hydrogen's considerable buoyancy and lack of toxicity other than as an asphyxiant work in its favor.

==Hydrogen codes and standards==

Hydrogen codes and standards are codes and standards (RCS) for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, stationary fuel cell applications and portable fuel cell applications.
Additional to the codes and standards for hydrogen technology products, there are codes and standards for hydrogen safety, for the safe handling of hydrogenHySafe Initial Guidance for Using Hydrogen in Confined Spaces. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2012-07-13. and the storage of hydrogen.

===Guidelines===

The current ANSI/AIAA standard for hydrogen safety guidelines is AIAA G-095-2004, Guide to Safety of Hydrogen and Hydrogen Systems.[ref]

===Mixtures===

===Leaks===

===Liquid hydrogen===

Liquid Hydrogen requires complex storage technology such as the special thermally insulated containers and requires special handling common to all cryogenic substances. This is similar to, but more severe than liquid oxygen.  Even with thermally insulated containers it is difficult to keep such a low temperature, and the hydrogen will gradually leak away. (Typically it will evaporate at a rate of 1% per day.Peter Kushnir. Hydrogen As an Alternative Fuel . PB 700-00-3. Vol. 32, Issue 3, May–June 2000. almc.army.mil.)

==Prevention==

Hydrogen collects under roofs and overhangs, where it forms an explosion hazard; any building that contains a potential source of hydrogen should have good ventilation, strong ignition suppression systems for all electric devices, and preferably be designed to have a roof that can be safely blown away from the rest of the structure in an explosion.  It also enters pipes and can follow them to their destinations.  Hydrogen pipes should be located above other pipes to prevent this occurrence.  Hydrogen sensors allow for rapid detection of hydrogen leaks to ensure that the hydrogen can be vented and the source of the leak tracked down.  As in natural gas, an odorant can be added to hydrogen sources to enable leaks to be detected by smell. While hydrogen flames can be hard to see with the naked eye, they show up readily on UV/IR flame detectors.

==Incidents==

Hydrogen has been portrayed in the popular press as a relatively more dangerous fuel, and hydrogen in fact has the widest explosive/ignition mix range with air of all gases except acetylene. However this is mitigated by the fact that hydrogen rapidly rises and disperses before ignition, and unless the escape is in an enclosed, unventilated area, it is unlikely to be serious.
Demonstrations have shown that a fuel fire in a hydrogen-powered vehicle can burn out completely with little damage to the vehicle, in stark contrast to the expected result in a gasoline-fueled vehicle.
In a more recent event, an explosion of compressed hydrogen during delivery at the  Muskingum River Coal Plant (owned and operated by AEP) caused significant damage and killed one person.[ref]

During the 2011 Fukushima nuclear emergency, four reactor buildings were damaged by hydrogen explosions. Exposed Zircaloy cladded fuel rods became very hot and reacted with steam, releasing hydrogen.[tpl]Cite book|title=Nuclear Fuel Behaviour in Loss-of-coolant Accident (LOCA) Conditions|year=2009|publisher=Nuclear Energy Agency, OECD|isbn=978-92-64-99091-3|page=140|url=https://www.oecd-nea.org/nsd/reports/2009/nea6846_LOCA.pdf[/tpl]Hydrogen explosions Fukushima nuclear plant: what happened?.

To prevent further explosions, vent holes were opened in the top of the remaining reactor buildings.
