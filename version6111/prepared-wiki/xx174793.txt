==History==

The station signed on as KWIV in June 1957. KWIV originally broadcast as a 250-watt daytimer on 1050AM. In the 1970s, KWIV moved from 1050 to 1470, allowing Casper's KTWO to move from 1470 to 1030. The move to 1470AM allowed KWIV to raise its daytime power to 1,000 watts, and for the first time, broadcast at night at 500 watts. The station was assigned the call sign KKTY on May 1, 1992. September 1, 1992, the station changed its call sign to KWOG and on December 2, 1993, the station reverted to KKTY.[tpl]cite web |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=38387&Callsign=KKTY |title=KKTY Call Sign History |work=United States Federal Communications Commission, audio division[/tpl]
