[[Spread option]]

CATEGORIES: Options (finance), Derivatives (finance)

In finance, a spread option is a type of option where the payoff is based on the difference in price between two underlying assets.  For example the two assets could be crude oil and heating oil; trading such an option might be of interest to oil refineries, whose profits are a function of the difference between these two prices.  Spread options are generally traded over the counter, rather than on exchange.Global Derivatives: Spread optionInvestopedia:Spread option
A 'spread option' is not the same as an 'option spread'.  A spread option is a new, relatively rare type of exotic option on two underlyings, while an option spread is a combination trade: the purchase of one (vanilla) option and the sale of another option on the same underlying.

When K equals zero a spread option is the same as an option to exchange one asset for another. An explicit solution, Margrabe's formula, is available in this case.
In 1995 Kirk's Approximation,Kirk E. (1995); Correlation in the Energy Markets, in: Managing Energy Price Risk, Risk Publications and Enron, London, pp. 71â€“78 a formula valid when K is small but non-zero was published. This amounts to a modification of the standard Black-Scholes formula, with a special expression for the sigma (volatility) to be used, which is based on the volatilities and the correlation of the two assets.
The same year Pearson published an algorithmN. Pearson: An efficient approach for pricing spread options requiring a single numerical integration to compute the option value.
This method was improved upon in 2006 when Li, Deng and ZhouLi, Deng and Zhou: Closed-Form Approximations for Spread Option Prices and Greeks http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=952747 published accurate approximation formulas for both spread option prices and their Greeks.
