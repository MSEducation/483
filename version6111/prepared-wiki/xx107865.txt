[[Fish Creek (Saskatchewan)]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Saskatchewan, National Historic Sites in Saskatchewan

Fish Creek is a tributary of the South Saskatchewan River in Saskatchewan, Canada, northeast of Saskatoon. 
It is most famous as the site of the Battle of Fish Creek during the Northwest Rebellion of 1885 between General Frederick Middleton of the Canadian Militia and Gabriel Dumont, adjutant general of the Metis Provisional Government of Saskatchewan. It also gives its name to the surrounding rural municipality. The area is part of the aspen parkland biome.
Fish Creek was the southern border of the Southbranch Settlement of French Métis who settled in the Saskatchewan Valley region in the mid to late 19th Century. They knew it as Tourond's Coulee.  Dumont chose to fight the battle at this natural border region as a defensive action with his outnumbered forces as the Canadian troops drove north. Dumont had less than sixty Métis, and this small force held off the Canadian troops for a day.  The fighting took place on April 24.
The battle proved to be a success for the Métis forces in that bloodied Middleton's nose and stalled the Canadian advance on Batoche, Saskatchewan; capital of Louis Riel's provisional government, for another two weeks.
Fish Creek also gives its name to a Saskatchewan rural municipality, Fish Creek No. 402 which encompasses the area today.
