By the end of the Archaean c. 2500 Ma (million years ago), plate tectonic activity may have been similar to that of the modern Earth. There are well-preserved sedimentary basins, and evidence of volcanic arcs, intracontinental rifts, continent-continent collisions and widespread globe-spanning orogenic events suggesting the assembly and destruction of one and perhaps several supercontinents. Liquid water was prevalent, and deep oceanic basins are known to have existed by the presence of banded iron formations, chert beds, chemical sediments and pillow basalts.

==Geology==

Although a few mineral grains are known that are Hadean, the oldest rock formations exposed on the surface of the Earth are Archean or slightly older. Archean rocks are known from Greenland, the Canadian Shield, the Baltic Shield, Scotland, India, Brazil, western Australia, and southern Africa. Although the first continents formed during this eon, rock of this age makes up only 7% of the world's current cratons; even allowing for erosion and destruction of past formations, evidence suggests that continental crust equivalent to only 5-40% of the present amount formed during the Archean.Stanley, pp. 301-2
In contrast to Proterozoic rocks, Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments, such as graywackes, mudstones, volcanic sediments, and banded iron formations. Carbonate rocks are rare, indicating that the oceans were more acidic due to dissolved carbon dioxide than during the Proterozoic.[tpl]cite book |first=John D. |last=Cooper |first2=Richard H. |last2=Miller |first3=Jacqueline |last3=Patterson |title=A Trip Through Time: Principles of Historical Geology |location=Columbus |publisher=Merrill Publishing Company |year=1986 |page=180 |isbn=0675201403 [/tpl] Greenstone belts are typical Archean formations, consisting of alternating units of metamorphosed mafic igneous and sedimentary rocks. The meta-igneous rocks were derived from volcanic island arcs, while the metasediments represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island arcs and deposited in a forearc basin. Greenstone belts represent sutures between protocontinents.Stanley, pp. 302-3

Fossils of cyanobacterial mats (stromatolites, which were instrumental in creating the free oxygen in the atmosphere[tpl]cite web|title=Early life: Oxygen enters the atmosphere|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/earth/earth_timeline/first_life|publisher=BBC|accessdate=September 20, 2012[/tpl] ) are found throughout the Archean, becoming especially common late in the eon, while a few probable bacterial fossils are known from chert beds.Stanley, 307 In addition to the domain Bacteria (once known as Eubacteria), microfossils of the domain Archaea have also been identified.
Life was probably present throughout the Archean, but may have been limited to simple non-nucleated single-celled organisms, called Prokaryota (formerly known as Monera). There are no known eukaryotic fossils, though they might have evolved during the Archean without leaving any fossils.Stanley, pp. 306, 323 No fossil evidence has been discovered for ultramicroscopic intracellular replicators such as viruses.
