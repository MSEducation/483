il Giornale is an Italian daily newspaper published in Milan, Italy.

==History==

The newspaper was planned in 1972 by the journalist Indro Montanelli, together with the colleagues Enzo Bettiza, Ferenc Fejtő, Raymond Aron and others, after some disagreements with the new pro-left editorial line adopted by the newspaper Corriere della Sera, where Montanelli had been one of the most important contributors. 
The newspaper was launched on 25 June 1974[tpl]cite journal|author=Lapo Filistrucchi|title=The Impact of Internet on the Market for Daily Newspapers in Italy|journal=EUI Working Paper|date=February 2006|url=http://www.eea-esem.com/files/papers/EEA-ESEM/2007/1932/Paper1EUI-WPmod.pdf|accessdate=9 December 2013[/tpl] as Il Giornale Nuovo, with Indro Montanelli as editor and member of the publishing company board of directors and an editorial office composed of 59 journalists. 
In 1977 Montanelli, in financial difficulty, accepted an offer by Silvio Berlusconi, who thus became the publisher. Indro Montanelli edited and published il Giornale from its start, until Berlusconi entered politics in December 1993. At that time he left to found the short-lived daily newspaper La Voce.
In 1994, Berlusconi sold il Giornale to his brother Paolo and Vittorio Feltri replaced Indro Montanelli as editor.

Il Giornale della Libertà was a free weekly political, headed by Michela Vittoria Brambilla, and attached with Il Giornale, but was strictly criticized by the editorial staff and later went on strike (for the second time after the leaving of Indro Montanelli).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/05/sezioni/politica/sciopero-giornale/sciopero-giornale/sciopero-giornale.html |title=Inserto dei "Circoli della Libertà" e al "Giornale" scatta lo sciopero|work=la Repubblica|date=31 May 2007 |accessdate=15 January 2009|language=Italian[/tpl]
