The Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg (Heidelberg University, Ruperto Carola) is a public research university located in Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Founded in 1386, it is the oldest university in Germany and was the third university established in the Holy Roman Empire. Heidelberg has been a coeducational institution since 1899. Today the university consists of twelve faculties and offers degree programmes at undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels in some 100 disciplines.The university does not include departments of business, visual arts, and engineering, except for computer engineering.

The language of instruction is usually German.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eu.uni-hd.de/basileus/deutsch.html|title=Language skills required to study at Heidelberg University |accessdate=2012-10-12 |work=Heidelberg University [/tpl]
Rupert I, Elector Palatine established the university when Heidelberg was the capital of the Electoral Palatinate. Consequently, it served as a centre for theologians and law experts from throughout the Holy Roman Empire. Matriculation rates declined with the Thirty Years' War, and the university did not overcome its fiscal and intellectual crises until the early 19th century.[tpl]cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=University of Heidelberg[/tpl] Subsequently, the institution once again became a hub for independent thinkers, and developed into a "stronghold of humanism",[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fc.ethz.ch/facts/ir/rankings/thes_ranking/THES_World_University_Rankings_2005.pdf|title=Article on Heidleberg in THES 2005|accessdate=2008-05-16 |format=pdf|work=THES - QS World University Rankings 2005 kindly provided by ETH Zürich Homepage[/tpl] and a centre of democratic thinking.[tpl]harvnb|Cser|2007|p=?[/tpl] At this time, Heidelberg served as a role model for the implementation of graduate schools at American universities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://atlanticreview.org/archives/448-When-German-Universities-Were-Models-for-American-Universities.html|title=When German Universities were Models for American Universities|accessdate=2010-01-10|work=atlanticreview.org[/tpl] However, the university lost many of its dissident professors and was marked a NSDAP university during the Nazi era (between 1933 and 1945).

The university's noted alumni include eleven domestic and foreign Heads of State or Heads of Government.

==History==

===Founding===

The Great Schism of 1378 made it possible for Heidelberg, a relatively small city and capital of the Electorate of the Palatinate, to gain its own university.[tpl]harvnb|Cser|2007|page=31[/tpl] The Great Schism was initiated by the election of two popes after the death of Pope Gregory XI in the same year. One successor resided in Avignon (elected by the French) and the other in Rome (elected by the Italian cardinals). The German secular and spiritual leaders voiced their support for the successor in Rome, which had far-reaching consequences for the German students and teachers in Paris: they lost their stipends and had to leave.[tpl]harvnb|Wolgast|1986|page=1–2[/tpl]
Rupert I recognized the opportunity and initiated talks with the Curia, which ultimately lead to a Papal Bull for foundation of a university. After having received on October 23, 1385 the permission from pope Urban VI to create a school of general studies ([tpl]lang-la|studium generale[/tpl]), the final decision to found the university was taken on June 26, 1386 at the behest of Rupert I, Count Palatine of the Rhine.[tpl]harvnb|Wolgast|1986|page=3[/tpl] As specified in the papal charter, the university was modelled after University of Paris and included four faculties: philosophy, theology, jurisprudence, and medicine.[tpl]cite book|title=Charters of Foundation and Early Documents of the Universities of the Coimbra Group|series=Varia Letteren| editor-first1=Jos. M. M. |editor-last1=Hermans |editor-first2=Marc |editor-last2=Nelissen |edition=2 |publisher=Leuven University Press|year=2005 |isbn=978-90-5867-474-6 |pages=56–57[/tpl]
On October 18, 1386, a special Pontifical High Mass in the Heiliggeistkirche was the ceremony that established the university. On October 19, 1386, the first lecture was held, making Heidelberg the oldest university in Germany.[tpl]harvnb|Wolgast|1986|page=1[/tpl] In November 1386, Marsilius of Inghen was elected first rector of the university.[tpl]harvnb|Cser|2007|page=39[/tpl] The rector seal motto was semper apertus—i.e., "the book of learning is always open."[tpl]harvnb|Wolgast|1986|page=5–6[/tpl]
The university grew up quickly and in March 1390, 185 students were enrolled at the university.[tpl]harvnb|Cser|2007|page=40[/tpl]

===Early development===

Between 1414 and 1418, theology and jurisprudence professors of the university took part in the Council of Constance and acted as counselors for Louis III, who attended this council as representative of the emperor and chief magistrate of the realm. This resulted in establishing a good reputation for the university and its professors.[tpl]harvnb|Cser|2007|p=43[/tpl]
Due to the influence of Marsilius, the university initially taught the nominalism or via moderna. In 1412, both realism and the teachings of John Wycliffe were forbidden at the university but later, around 1454, the university decided that realism or via antique would also be taught, thus introducing two parallel ways ([tpl]lang|la|ambae viae[/tpl]).[tpl]harvnb|Gabriel|1974|pages = 459–61[/tpl]
The transition from scholastic to humanistic culture was effected by the chancellor and bishop Johann von Dalberg in the late 15th century. Humanism was represented at Heidelberg University particularly by the founder of the older German Humanistic School Rudolph Agricola, Conrad Celtes, Jakob Wimpfeling, and Johann Reuchlin. Æneas Silvius Piccolomini was chancellor of the university in his capacity of provost of Worms, and later always favored it with his friendship and good-will as Pope Pius II. In 1482, Pope Sixtus IV permitted laymen and married men to be appointed professors in the ordinary of medicine through a papal dispensation. In 1553, Pope Julius III sanctioned the allotment of ecclesiastical benefice to secular professors.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5611|title=Heidelberg University - Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Catholic Online[/tpl]
Martin Luther's disputation at Heidelberg in April 1518 made a lasting impact, and his adherents among the masters and scholars soon became leading Reformationists in Southwest Germany. With the Electorate of the Palatinate turn to the Reformed faith, Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, converted the university into a calvinsitic institution. In 1563, the Heidelberg Catechism was created under collaboration of members of the university's divinity school. As the 16th century was passing, the late humanism stepped beside Calvinism as a predominant school of thought; and figures like Paul Schede, Jan Gruter, Martin Opitz, and Matthäus Merian taught at the university. It attracted scholars from all over the continent and developed into a cultural and academic center.[tpl]harvnb|Cser|2007|p=[tpl]Page needed|date=November 2010[/tpl][/tpl] However, with the beginning of the Thirty Years' War in 1618, the intellectual and fiscal wealth of the university declined. In 1622, the then-world-famous Bibliotheca Palatina (the library of the university) was stolen from the University Cathedral and taken to Rome. The reconstruction efforts thereafter were defeated by the troops of King Louis XIV, who destroyed Heidelberg in 1693 almost completely.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/university/welcome/history.html|title=History of the University |accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sino.uni-heidelberg.de/students/tjuelch/Bauwerke%20Altstadt/Peterskirche.htm|title=A history of the Church of St. Peter|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage[/tpl]
As a consequence of the late Counter-Reformation, the university lost its Protestant character, and was channeled by Jesuits. In 1735, the Old University was constructed at University Square, then known as Domus Wilhelmina. Through the efforts of the Jesuits a preparatory seminary was established, the Seminarium ad Carolum Borromæum, whose pupils were also registered in the university. After the suppression of the Jesuit Order, most of the schools they had conducted passed into the hands of the French Congregation of Lazarists in 1773. They deteriorated from that time forward, and the university itself continued to lose in prestige until the reign of the last elector Charles Theodore, Elector Palatine, who established new chairs for all the faculties, founded scientific institutes such as the Electoral Academy of Science, and transferred the school of political economy from Kaiserslautern to Heidelberg, where it was combined with the university as the faculty of political economy. He also founded an observatory in the neighboring city of Mannheim, where Jesuit Christian Mayer labored as director. In connection with the four hundredth anniversary of the university, the elector approved a revised statute book that several professors had been commissioned to prepare. The financial affairs of the university, its receipts and expenditures, were put in order. At that time, the number of students varied from 300-400; in the jubilee year, 133 matriculated. As a consequence of the disturbances caused by the French Revolution, and particularly because of the Treaty of Lunéville, the university lost all its property on the left bank of the Rhine, so that its complete dissolution was expected.

===19th and early 20th century===

This decline did not stop until 1803, when the university was reestablished as a state-owned institution by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden, to whom the part of the Palatinate situated on the right bank of the Rhine was allotted. Since then, the university bears his name together with the name of Ruprecht I. Karl Friedrich divided the university into five faculties and placed himself at its head as rector, as did also his successors. During this decade Romanticism found expression in Heidelberg through Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, Ludwig Tieck, Joseph Görres, and Joseph von Eichendorff, and there went forth a revival of the German Middle Ages in speech, poetry, and art.
The German Students Association exerted great influence, which was at first patriotic and later political. After Romanticism had eventually died out, Heidelberg became a center of Liberalism and the movement in favor of German national unity. The historians Friedrich Christoph Schlosser and Georg Gottfried Gervinus were the guides of the nation in political history. The modern scientific schools of medicine and natural science, particularly astronomy, were models in point of construction and equipment, and Heidelberg University was especially noted for its influential law school. The university as a whole became the role model for the transformation of American liberal arts colleges into research universities, in particular for the then-newly established Johns Hopkins University. Heidelberg's professors were important supporters of the Vormärz revolution and many of them were members of the first freely elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848. During the late 19th century, the university housed a very liberal and open-minded spirit, which was deliberately fostered by Max Weber, Ernst Troeltsch and a circle of colleagues around them.
In the Weimar Republic, the university was widely recognized as a center of democratic thinking, coined by professors like Karl Jaspers, Gustav Radbruch, Martin Dibelius and Alfred Weber. Unfortunately, there were also dark forces working within the university: Nazi physicist Philipp Lenard was head of the physical institute during that time. Following the assassination of the liberal German-Jewish Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, he refused to half mast the national flag on the institute, thereby provoking its storming by communist students.

===Nazi era===

With the advent of the Third Reich in 1933, the university supported the Nazis like all other German universities at the time. It dismissed a large number of staff and students for political and racist reasons. Many dissident fellows had to emigrate and most Jewish and Communist professors that did not leave Germany were deported. At least two professors directly fell victim to Nazi terror.[tpl]harvnb|Wolgast|1986|p=146[/tpl] On 17 May 1933, members of the university faculty and students took part in book burnings at Universitätsplatz ("University Square")[tpl]harvnb|Cser|2007|p=278[/tpl] and Heidelberg eventually became infamous as a NSDAP university. The inscription above the main entrance of the New University was changed from "The Living Spirit" to "The German Spirit",[tpl]harvnb|Cser|2007|p=256[/tpl] and many professors paid homage to the new motto. The university was involved in Nazi eugenics: forced sterilizations were carried out at the women's clinic and the psychiatric clinic then directed by Carl Schneider was involved in Action T4 Euthanasia program.[tpl]harvnb|Remy|2002|pp=72–3, 107–10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.medizinische-fakultaet-hd.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php?id=109869&L=en|title=History |work=Medizinische Fakultät Heidelberg[/tpl]
After the end of World War II, the university underwent an extensive denazification.

===Federal Republic===

Since Heidelberg was spared from destruction during World War II, the reconstruction of the university was realized rather quickly. With the foundation of the Collegium Academicum, Heidelberg University became the home of Germany's first and, until today, only self-governed student hall. Newly laid statutes obliged the university to "The Living Spirit of Truth, Justice and Humanity".
During the 1960s and 1970s, the university grew dramatically in size. At this time, it developed into one of the main scenes of the left-wing student protests in Germany. In 1975, a massive police force arrested the entire student parliament AStA. Shortly thereafter, the building of the Collegium Academicum, a progressive college in immediate vicinity to the universities main grounds, was stormed by over 700 police officers and closed once and for all. On the outskirts of the city, in the Neuenheimer Feld area, a large campus for medicine and natural sciences was constructed.
Today, about 28,000 students are enrolled for studies at Heidelberg University.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university/heidelberguniversity/|title=QS - Heidelberg University statistics|accessdate=2010-10-02 |work=QS - Top Universities[/tpl] There are 4,196 full-time faculty, including 476 university professors. In 2007, and again in 2012, the university was appointed University of Excellence under an initiative started by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the German Research Foundation. This enhanced the German university system by establishing a small network of exceptionally well-funded universities, which are expected to generate strong international appeal.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/press/news/538e.html|title=Press Releases - Rector Prof. Eitel: "An invaluable opportunity to aim at goals that would otherwise have been unattainable." |accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage[/tpl]

==Campuses==

Heidelberg is a city with approximately 140,000 inhabitants. It is situated in the Rhine Neckar Triangle, a European metropolitan area with approximately 2.4 million people living there, comprising the neighboring cities of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Ludwigshafen, and a number of smaller towns in the perimeter. Heidelberg is known as the cradle of Romanticism, and its old town and castle are among the most frequented tourist destinations in Germany. Its pedestrian zone is a shopping and night life magnet for the surrounding area and beyond. Heidelberg is about 40 minutes by train away from Frankfurt International Airport.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.heidelberg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1090707_l2/index.html|title=Heidelberg City Information|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=heidelberg.de - City Homepage[/tpl]
Heidelberg University's facilities are, generally speaking, separated in two parts. The faculties and institutes of humanities and social sciences are embedded in the Old Town Campus. The sciences faculties and the medical school, including three large university hospitals, are located on the New Campus in the Neuenheimer Feld on the outskirts of Heidelberg.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/univ/besucher/wege.html |title=Maps of Heidelberg University|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage[/tpl]

===Old Town Campus===

The so-called New University is regarded as the center of the Old Town Campus. It is situated at the Universitätsplatz (University Square) in the pedestrian zone, in direct vicinity to the University Library and to the main administration buildings. The New University was officially opened in 1931. Its erection was largely financed by donations of wealthy American families, in line with a fundraising campaign of Jacob Gould Schurman, an alumnus of Heidelberg University and former United States Ambassador to Germany.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/presse/news/2005schurman2.html|title=7. Jacob Gould Schurman Public Lecture at Heidelberg University: "The Idea of the American Century"|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage[/tpl] It houses the new assembly hall, the largest lecture halls, and a number of smaller seminar rooms, mostly used by faculties of humanities and social sciences. Education in humanities and social sciences takes place to a great extent in buildings spread over the ancient part of town, though most are less than ten minutes walk from University Square. The faculties maintain their own extensive libraries and work spaces for students. Seminars and tutorials are usually held in the faculty buildings.

===New Campus===

The New Campus is in the Neuenheimer Feld district. It is now the largest part of the university, and the largest campus for natural sciences and life science in Germany. Almost all science faculties and institutes, the medical school, University Hospital Heidelberg, and the science branch of the University Library are situated on the New Campus. Most of the dormitories and the athletic facilities of the university can be found there as well. Several independent research institutes, such as the German Cancer Research Center and two of the Max-Planck-Institutes have settled there. The New Campus is also the seat of several biomedical spin-off companies. The old part of town can be reached by tram and bus in about 10 minutes. The Neuenheimer Feld campus has extensive parking lots for faculty and student vehicles for long term and short term parking, as well as visitors and patients of the various university hospitals. The Faculty of Physics and Astronomy is not located on either campus, but on the Philosophers' Walk, separated from the Old Town by the River Neckar, and some [tpl]convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] away from the New Campus. It also maintains observatory facilities on the Königstuhl Mountain.

===Bergheim Campus===

The Bergheim Campus is located in the former Ludolf Krehl clinic (named after Ludolf von Krehl) in the inner-city suburb of Heidelberg-Bergheim. Since March 2009 it has housed the institutes economics, political science, and sociology (together the Heidelberg University Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences) that formerly resided at the Old Town campus. The Bergheim campus offers one lecture theatre, several seminar rooms, the most modern of the university libraries, and a cafe (rather than the full cafeteria present in the other campuses).

===Libraries===

The University Library is the main library of the university, and constitutes together with the decentralized libraries of the faculties and institutes, the integral university library system comprising approximately 6.7 million printed books. It is Germany's most frequently used library, and it is currently placed 1st in a ranking of Germany's best libraries.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/presse/news2010/pm20100630_bibliotheksindex.html|title=Library ranking - Heidelberg finishes first|accessdate=2010-09-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage[/tpl] The University Library's stocks exceeded one million in 1934. Today, it holds about 3.2 million books, about 500,000 other media such as microfilms and video tapes, as well as 10,732 scientific periodicals. Moreover, it holds 6,600 manuscripts, most notably the Codex Manesse, 1,800 incunabula, 110,500 autographs, and a collection of old maps, paintings, and photographs. The further 83 decentralized libraries of the faculties and institutes hold another 3.5 million printed books. In 2005, 34,500 active users of the University Library accessed 1.4 million books a year. The conventional book supply is complemented by numerous electronic services. Around 3,000 commercial scientific journals can be accessed via e-journal.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/allg/profil/geschichte.html|title=Geschichte der Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=University Library of Heidelberg Homepage[/tpl] The University Library of today traces its roots back to the purchase of a chest of documents by the first Rector Marsilius von Inghen in 1388, which was stored in the Heiliggeistkirche, then the University Cathedral. Since 1978, the science branch of the University Library serves the institutes of natural sciences and medicine on the New Campus.

===Facilities abroad===

Heidelberg University founded a Center for Latin America in Santiago, Chile in 2001.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.heidelberg-center.uni-hd.de/english/center.html|title=The Center|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg Center for Latin America Homepage[/tpl] It has the task of organizing, managing, and marketing the courses of study maintained either independently by Heidelberg University or in cooperation with the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the University of Chile. Heidelberg University has arranged cooperation agreements with both of these universities. The center has responsibility for programs of postgraduate education. It also coordinates the activities of Heidelberg University in Latin America, and provides a platform for scientific cooperation. The university is also represented by a liaison office in New York. Its main tasks include promoting existing collaborations, building up new networks, creating joint study programs, and maintaining and expanding academic contacts with American universities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.magazine-deutschland.de/en/artikel-en/article/article/die-uni-heidelberg-in-new-york.html|title=Heidelberg University in New York|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Deutschland Magazin.de[/tpl] In addition, the Heidelberg South Asia Institute maintains branch offices in New Delhi, India; Islamabad, Pakistan; Kathmandu, Nepal; and Colombo, Sri Lanka.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/en/associated_chairs.php|title=Heidelberg South Asia Institute|accessdate=2012-05-28 |work=Heidelberg University website[/tpl]

==Organization==

===Governance===

The Rectorate is the 'executive body' of the university, headed by rector Bernhard Eitel. The rectorate consists of the chancellor, Angela Kalous, who is the head of the central administration and responsible for the university's budgeting, and three pro-rectors, who are responsible for international relations, teaching and communication, and research and structure respectively.
The Senate is the 'legislative branch' of the university. The rector and the members of the rectorate are senators ex officio, as are also the deans of the faculties, as well as the medical and managing directors of the University Hospital, and the university's equal opportunities officer. Another 20 senators are elected for four-year terms, within the following quotas: eight university professors; four academic staff; four delegates of the student body; and four employees of the university administration.
The University Council is the advisory board to the aforementioned entities and encompasses, among others, the former Israeli Ambassador to Germany Avi Primor, as well as CEOs of German industries.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/einrichtungen/organe/index.html|title=Universitätsorgane und Funktionsträger|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage [/tpl]

===Faculties===

After a 2003 structural reformation, the university consists of 12 faculties, which in turn comprise several disciplines, departments, and institutes. As a consequence of the Bologna process, most faculties now offer Bachelor's, Master's, and Ph.D. degrees to comply with the new European degree standard. Notable exceptions are the undergraduate programs in law, medicine, dentistry and pharmacy, from which students still graduate with the State Examination, a central examination at Master's level held by the State of Baden-Württemberg.

===Associated institutions===

===Partnerships===

The university has numerous partnerships nationally and internationally. In particular, it maintains longstanding collaborations in research and education with the following independent research institutes located in and around Heidelberg:

==Academic profile==

===School statistics===

The university employs more than 15,000 academic staff, most of them are physicians engaged in the University Hospital.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/facts/|title=Facts|accessdate=2010-09-18 |work=Heidelberg University[/tpl] As of 2008, the faculty encompasses 4,196 full-time staff, excluding visiting professors as well as graduate research and teaching assistants. 673 faculty members have been drawn from abroad. Heidelberg University also attracts more than 500 international scholars as visiting professors each academic year. The university enrolls a total of 26,741 students, including 5,118 international students. In addition there are 1,467 international exchange students at Heidelberg. 23,636 students pursue taught degrees, 4,114 of whom are international students, and 919 are international exchange students. 3,105 students pursue a doctoral degree, including 1,004 international doctoral students and 15 international exchange students. In 2007, the university awarded 994 Ph.D. degrees.

===Rankings===

===Organization and length of courses===

The academic year is divided into two semesters. The winter semester runs from October 1-March 31 and the summer semester from April 1-September 30. Classes are held from mid-October to mid-February and mid-April to mid-July. Students can generally begin their studies either in the winter or the summer semester. However, there are several subjects students can begin only in the winter semester. The standard time required to finish a Bachelor's degree is principally six semesters, and a further four semesters for consecutive Master's degrees. The normal duration of Ph.D. programs for full-time students is 6 semesters. The overall period of study for an undergraduate degree is divided into two parts: a period of basic study, lasting at least four semesters, at the end of which students must sit a formal examination, and a period of advanced study, lasting at least two semesters, after which students take their final examinations.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/courses/prospective/admission_int/application_international.html |title=Application and Matriculation for International Students|accessdate=2010-09-26 |publisher=Heidelberg University[/tpl]

In the winter-semester 2006/2007, the university offered 3,926 places in undergraduate programs restricted by numerus clausus, with an overall acceptance rate of 16.3%.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/presse/news06/2608stud.html|title=Universität Heidelberg – Pressemitteilungen 1|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage[/tpl] Most selective are the undergraduate programs in clinical medicine, molecular biotechnology, political science, and law, with acceptance rates of 3.6%,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zvs.de/Service/Download/Bew_Medizin_WS2006.pdf|title=Angebot- und Nachfrage nach Studienplätzen in bundesweit zulassungsbeschränkten Studiengängen zum Wintersemester 2006/2007 - Studiengang Medizin|accessdate=2008-05-16 |format=pdf|work=ZVS Homepage |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080408213549/http://www.zvs.de/Service/Download/Bew_Medizin_WS2006.pdf  |archivedate = 2008-04-08[/tpl] 3.8%, 7.6%[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rzuser.uni-hd.de/~it5/presse/news04/ausw.html|title=Universität Heidelberg – Pressemitteilungen 2|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage[/tpl] and 9.1%[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rzuser.uni-hd.de/~it5/presse/news04/2409ausw.html|title=Universität Heidelberg – Pressemitteilungen 3|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage[/tpl] respectively. The selection is exercised by allocating the best qualified applicants to a given number of places available in the respective discipline, thus depending primarily on the chosen subjects and the grade point average of the Abitur or its equivalent. For some majors and minors in humanities—particularly for conceptually non-vocational like classics and ancient history—unrestricted admission is granted under certain criteria (e.g., relevant language proficiency), as applications regularly do not exceed the number of places available. For prospective international undergraduate students, a language test for German—such as the DSH—is required. Admission to consecutive Master's programs always requires at least an undergraduate degree equivalent to the German grade "good" (i.e., normally B+ in American, or 2:1 in British terms). Except for the Master's programs taught in English, a language test for German must be passed as well. Ph.D. admission prerequisite is normally a strong Master's-level degree, but specific admission procedures vary and cannot be generalized.See the pages of the respective grad schools listed above for detailed information or start with Heidelberg Graduate Academy International applicants usually make up considerably more than 20% of the applicant pool and are considered individually by the merits achieved in their respective country of origin.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/press/news/press321_e.html|title=Heidelberg University - Press Releases|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage[/tpl]

Heidelberg's student newspaper "ruprecht" is — with editions of more than 10,000 copies — one of Germany's largest student-run newspapers. It was recently distinguished by the MLP Pro Campus Press Award as Germany's best student newspaper. The jury of journalists from major newspapers commended its "well balanced, though critical attitude" and its "simply great" layout that "suffices highest professional demands." The ruprecht is financed entirely by advertising revenues, thus retaining independence from university management. Some renowned journalists emerged from ruprecht[tpl]'[/tpl]s editorial board.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ruprecht.de/fileadmin/pdf/Presseberichte/2007_10_07_RNZ.pdf|title=Der "ruprecht" ist Deutschlands beste Studentenzeitung |accessdate=2008-05-16 |format=pdf |work=Rhein Neckar Zeitung online[/tpl]
However, the critical online student newspaper UNiMUT, which is run by the joint student council of the faculties, criticized the ruprecht often for being conformed, and exceedingly layout-oriented.[tpl]cite web |url=http://texte.ruprecht.de/zeigartikel.php?id=1437 |title=UniMUT – Der Kampf geht weiter!|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Ruprecht online[/tpl]
Heidelberg is also home of Germany's oldest student law review "StudZR". The journal is published quarterly, at the beginning and end of each semester break, and is circulated throughout all of Germany.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.studzr.de/html/menu_oben/uberuns_en.html |title=StudZR - About us|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=StudZR Homepage |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080224133537/http://www.studzr.de/html/menu_oben/uberuns_en.html  |archivedate = 2008-02-24[/tpl]
Heidelberg hosts 34 student corporations, which were largely founded in the 19th century. Corporations are to some extent comparable to the fraternities in the US. As traditional symbols (couleur) corporation members wear colored caps and ribbons at ceremonial occasions (Kommers) and some still practice the traditional academic fencing, a kind of duel, to "shape their members for the challenges of life." In the 19th and early 20th century, corporations played an important role in Germany's student life. Today, however, corporations include only a relatively small number of students. Their self-declared mission is to keep academic traditions alive and to create friendships for life. The corporations' often representative 19th-century mansions are present throughout the Old Town.
Heidelberg is not least famous for its student night life.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rhein-neckar-guide.de/heidelberg.html |title=Heidelberg night life|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Rhein-Neckar guide[/tpl] Besides the various parties regularly organized by the student councils of the faculties, the semester opening and closing parties of the university, the dormitory parties, and the soirées of Heidelberg's 34 student fraternities, the city, and the metropolitan area even more, offers night life for any taste and budget. Adjacent to University Square is Heidelberg's major night life district, where one pub is placed next to each other. From Thursday on, it is all night very crowded and full of atmosphere. Moreover, Heidelberg has five major discos. The largest of them is located at the New Campus. The city of Mannheim, which is about three times as large as Heidelberg, is a 15-minute train ride away, and offers an even more diverse night life, having a broad variety of clubs and bars well-frequented by both Heidelberg's and Mannheim's student community.

==In fiction and popular culture==

In 1880 Mark Twain humorously detailed his impressions of Heidelberg's student life in A Tramp Abroad. He painted a picture of the university as a school for aristocrats, where students pursued a dandy's lifestyle, and described the great influence the student corporations exerted on the whole of Heidelberg's student life.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/119/119-h/119-h.htm|title=A Tramp Abroad, By Mark Twain, Complete|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Project Gutenberg[/tpl]
In William Somerset Maugham's 1915 masterpiece novel Of Human Bondage, he described the one-year stay of the protagonist Philip Carey at Heidelberg University, in a largely autobiographical way. Heidelberg also featured in the respective film versions of the novel, released in 1934 (starring Leslie Howard as Philip, and Bette Davis as Mildred), 1946 (with Paul Henreid and Eleanor Parker in the lead roles), and 1964 (with Laurence Harvey and Kim Novak in the lead roles).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/351|title=Of Human Bondage, By William Somerset Maugham, Complete|accessdate=2009-02-10 |work=Project Gutenberg[/tpl]
The 1927 silent film The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg, based on Wilhelm Meyer-Förster's play Alt Heidelberg (1903), starring Ramón Novarro and Norma Shearer, continued Mark Twain's image of Heidelberg, showing the story of a German prince who comes to Heidelberg to study there, but falls in love with his innkeeper's daughter. Having been very popular in the first half of the 20th century, it presents the typical student life of the 19th and early 20th century, and it is today considered a masterpiece of the late silent film era.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018451/|title=The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg (1927)|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Internet Movie Database[/tpl] MGM's 1954 color remake The Student Prince, featuring the voice of Mario Lanza, is based on Sigmund Romberg's operetta version of the story.[tpl]cite web |url=http://musicaltheatreguide.com/composers/romberg/student_prince.htm|title=The Student Prince|accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Musical & Theatre Guide[/tpl]
