[[KTM Class 91]]

CATEGORIES: KTM Komuter

The Class 91 is a type of electric multiple unit currently operating on Keretapi Tanah Melayu's Electric Train Service (ETS) since 2009. In 2008 KTMB purchased a total of 5 sets of 6 car EMUs worth RM 240 million ringgit or $67 million (USD) from a joint venture between South Korea's Rotem Co. and Japan Mitsubishi Electric Corp. These cars are arranged in a 6-cars configuration for a total of 5 train sets. Facilities include toilets and buffet cars.

All five train sets were designed by the Marubeni Corporation, but were built by Hyundai Rotem of Korea and Mitsubishi Electric of Japan.[tpl]cite web|last=White|first=Stanley|title=Marubeni Gets $67 Million Malaysia Train-Car Order, Nikkei Says|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aGwXKvp1yE8o|work=Bloombery|publisher=BloomPUB|accessdate=19 July 2012[/tpl]  The design of the train sets follows very closely the IE 22000 Class of Ireland's InterCity trains. The major difference between the trainsets in Ireland and those used in Malaysia is that the Irish trainsets operate on a broad gauge rail while Malaysia uses metre gauge rails.[tpl]cite web|last=Kamimura|first=Sanako|title=Order Received for a  30-Car Commuter  Express Train in Malaysi|url=http://www.marubeni.com/dbps_data/_material_/maruco_en/data/magazines/pdf/2009/shosha_98.pdf|publisher=Marubeni|accessdate=19 July 2012[/tpl] 

==Operation==

The class 91 operates in a fixed 6-cars configuration. Unlike other KTM EMUâ€™s the class 91 is the first to introduce long distance train facilities such as onboard-toilets and cafe areas. Currently, class 91 sets are mainly used for long distance intercity travel between Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur.  In 2010-2012, 2 sets of KTM class 91 were being used for normal commuter use, while in commuter use, long distance facilities such as toilets and cafes were closed and locked.
The Class 91 usually operates at its service maximum of 140 km/h and is known to sometimes speed at 160 km/h during regular service at certain stretches.[tpl]cite web|last=Leung|first=Fredie|title=Electric trains to reduce travel time|url=http://thestar.com.my/metro/story.asp?file=/2010/8/24/central/6862337&sec=central|work=TheStarOnline|publisher=Star|accessdate=19 July 2012[/tpl] 
Train schedule is categorically separated into a number of fixed classes with different ticketing structure afforded to travelling at particular times. i.e. travelling during peak would incur premium ticket cost whereas travel during off-peak mid day incur a discounted fare.[tpl]cite web|last=ROSHIDI ABU SAMAH|title=Ipoh-KL electric train fare RM30-35|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/7/27/nation/20100727170250&sec=nation|work=TheStarOnline|publisher=Star|accessdate=19 July 2012[/tpl]

==Maintenance==

The Class 91 is stabled and maintained at Batu Gajah Rail Depot in Perak.

==Features==

The Class 91 is one of the first trains in KTMs inventory to feature onboard displays displaying current speed. Train seating is optimised for long distance seating with minimal standing space. Fixed large seats are placed traverse throughout the coach. LCD Displays within coach show feature films, with sound muted but with subtitled English.
During long distance operations, as many as 7 attendants will attend the train set.

==Expansion==

In the future, there are plans for an additional 20 sets.
