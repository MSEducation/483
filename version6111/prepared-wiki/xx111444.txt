==Toponymy==

Old Norse lang or Old English lång 'long' and Old Norse topt 'site of a house'. Etymological Homonymy with Langtoft, Lincolnshire and Lanquetot (Normandy, Languetot 12th century).

==History==

The chronicler Pierre de Langtoft took his name from the village. Also resident in the village during the same era was Margaret De Langtoft, who later became one of the five nuns that formed the Sisterhood of Rosedale Priory.
In the centre of the village is the village green which used to be pond. Some people still refer to this site as the pond. There is a monument to the people of the village that died in the two wars.
The village itself was flooded in 1657 and 1892. A plaque can be found commemorating the floods on the corner of Back Street and Front street that reads:
Minor flooding can be seen on Front Street during heavy rain and in 2007 the 'pond' flooded causing the road to be closed.

Several other small businesses are, however, present and thriving in the village. Broadband is available after a scheme to connect all Yorkshire villages by Yorkshire Forward. Broadband is also available over WiFi using Wireless mesh network in a project started before ADSL was made available. There is also a primary school although this recently announced the closure of the junior years which means that children will now catch the school bus to Driffield.
The village has grown over the past few years with many new houses being built. There is a joke that Langtoft is the village with "a house in every garden" reflecting the fact that a lot of homeowners' land has been sold to developers who have then built on it.
