[[Immorality]]

CATEGORIES: Morality, Ethics

The word "immoral" is normally used to describe persons or actions.  In a broader sense it can be applied to groups or corporate bodies, beliefs, religions, and works of art. To say that some act is immoral is to say that violates some moral laws, norms or standards.

==Aristotle==

Aristotle saw many vices as excesses or deficits in relation to some virtue, as cowardice and rashness relate to courage. Some attitudes and actions - such as envy, murder, and theft - he saw as wrong in themselves, with no question of a deficit/excess in relation to the mean.Aristotle, Ethics (1976) p. 102

==Religion and sexuality==

Immorality is closely linked with both religion and sexuality, not least in the western tradition.B. Kirkpatrick ed, Roget's Thesaurus (1998) p. 650 and p. 670 Max Weber saw rational articulated religions as engaged in a long-term struggle with more physical forms of religious experience linked to dance, intoxication and sexual activity.Max Weber, The Sociology of Religion (1971) p. 158 Durkheim pointed out how many primitive rites culminated in an abandonment of the distinction between licit and immoral behavior.Émile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1971) p. 383
Freud's dour conclusion was that "In every age immorality has found no less support in religion than morality has".S. Freud, Civilization, Society and Religion (PFL 12) p. 220

===Sexual immorality===

Coding of sexual behavior has historically been a feature of all human societies, as too has the policing of breaches of its mores - sexual immorality - by means of formal and informal social control.F. Dabhoiwala, 'The first sexual revolution', The Oxford Historian X (2012) p. 42-6 Interdictions and taboos among primitive societiesDurkheim, p. 410 were arguably no less severe than in traditional agrarian societies.S. Freud, On Sexuality (PFL 7) p. 271 In the latter, the degree of control might vary from time to time and region to region, being least in urban settlements;E. Ladurie, Montaillou (1980) p. 149 and p. 169 however, only the last three centuries of intense urbanisation, commercialisation and modernisation have broken with the restrictions of the pre-modern world,Dabhoiwala, p. 41-3 in favor of a successor society of fractured and competing sexual codes and subcultures, where sexual expression is integrated into the workings of the commercial world.Herbert Marcuse, One-Dimensional Man (2002) p. 78
Nevertheless, while the meaning of sexual immorality has been drastically redefined in recent times, arguably the boundaries of what is acceptable remain publicly policed and as highly charged as ever, as the decades-long debates over reproductive rights after Roe v. Wade, or 21st-century controversy over child images on Wikipedia and Amazon would tend to suggest.A. Lih, The Wikipedia Revolution (2010) p. 204-9

==Modernity==

Michel Foucault considered that the modern world was unable to put forward a coherent moralityG, Gutting ed., The Cambridge Companion to Foucault (2003) p. 87 - an inability underpinned philosophically by emotivism. Nevertheless modernism has often been accompanied by a cult of immorality,Eric Berne, Games People Play (1966) p. 70 as for example when John Ciardi acclaimed The Naked Lunch as "a monumentally moral descent into the hell of narcotic addiction".Quoted in J. Campbell, This is the Beat Generation (1999) p. 265

==Immoral psychoanalysis?==

Psychoanalysis received much early criticism for being the unsavory product of an immoral town - Vienna; psychoanalysts for being both unscrupulous and dirty-minded.Peter Gay, Freud (1989) p. 194-6
Freud himself however was of the opinion that "anyone who has succeeded in educating himself to truth about himself is permanently defended against the danger of immorality, even though his standard of morality may differ".S. Freud, Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (PFL 1) p. 485-6
