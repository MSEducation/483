The museum includes exhibits about the planets of the Solar System, space flight and the primates that were used in early space flight experiments conducted by the United States. The museum holds mock-ups and training units of many important space artifacts such as satellites, the Space Shuttle, and the lunar lander (the originals are still in space or on the moon).

===Outlying buildings===

The Clyde W. Tombaugh IMAX Theater and Planetarium has a projection dome that doubles as an IMAX screen and as a planetarium. IMAX-format films are screened daily.

==History==

The museum was originally created as the International Space Hall of Fame. In 1973 former Alamogordo mayor Dwight Ohlinger was inspired by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum to propose a Space Hall of Fame, and further to propose that it be built at Alamogordo because so much of the developmental work for the space program had been done in the Tularosa Basin.

Charles E. Nolan and Associates were hired as the architects.[tpl]Rp|39-40[/tpl] The main building was designed and constructed as a "golden cube" (a cube with a gold-tinted glass exterior) and dedicated on October 5, 1976, opening to the public on November 23, 1976.[tpl]Rp|40,44[/tpl] At the dedication ceremony the initial fifteen Hall of Fame members were inducted.[tpl]Rp|44[/tpl]
The planetarium was constructed in combination with an IMAX theater and opened in 1981.[tpl]Rp|51[/tpl] The combined facility was named after Clyde Tombaugh, New Mexico resident and discoverer of Pluto.
In 1987 the name of the facility was changed to Space Center, reflecting the growing role of the exhibits.[tpl]Rp|52[/tpl] In 2001 the name changed again to its present name of New Mexico Museum of Space History.[tpl]Rp|57[/tpl]
