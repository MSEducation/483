Hummus ([tpl]lang-ar|حُمُّص[/tpl]) is a Middle Eastern and Arabic food dip or spread made from cooked, mashed chickpeas blended with tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and garlic.Sami Zubaida, "National, Communal and Global Dimensions in Middle Eastern Food Cultures" in Sami Zubaida and Richard Tapper, A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East, London and New York, 1994 and 2000, ISBN 1-86064-603-4, p. 35.  Today, it is popular throughout the Middle East (including Turkey), North Africa (including Morocco), and in Middle Eastern cuisine around the globe.

==Etymology==

Hummus is an Arabic word (حمّص ḥummuṣ) meaning "chickpeas," and the complete name of the prepared spread in Arabic is [tpl]lang|ar|حمّص بطحينة[/tpl] ḥummuṣ bi ṭaḥīna, which means "chickpeas with tahini".Maan Z.

==History==

Many cuisine-related sources describe hummus as an ancient food,mideastfood.about.com, Hummus 101. Retrieved 28 February 2008.choice.com, More about hummus, "Hummus has existed for thousands of years.". Retrieved 5 May 2008.insidehookah.com Food - Hummus, "...it is evident that it’s been a Middle Eastern/Mediterranean favorite, and sometimes staple, for thousands of years.". Retrieved 5 May 2008. or connect it to famous historical figures such as Saladin.Percival, Jenny, Lebanon to sue Israel for marketing hummus as its own, guardian.co.uk, 7 October 2008. Retrieved 9 November 2009. Indeed, its basic ingredients—chickpeas, sesame, lemon, and garlic—have been eaten in the region for millennia.Tannahill p. 25, 61Brothwell & Brothwell passim
But in fact, there is no specific evidence for this purported ancient history of hummus bi tahina.http://www.straightdope.com, Who invented hummus?, 21 March 2001, "Hummus has been around for too long, in too many forms, and the origin is lost in antiquity... There's no way of knowing where it started...". Retrieved 5 May 2008. Though chickpeas were widely eaten in the region, and they were often cooked in stews and other hot dishes,e.g. a "simple dish" of meat, pulses and spices described by Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi in the 13th century, Tannahill p. 174 puréed chickpeas eaten cold with tahini do not appear before the Abbasid period in Egypt and the Levant.
The earliest known recipes for a dish similar to hummus bi tahina are recorded in cookbooks published in Cairo in the 13th century.Encyclopedia of Jewish Food, John Wiley & Sons, 2010, By Gil Marks, page 270 A cold purée of chickpeas with vinegar and pickled lemons with herbs, spices, and oil, but no tahini or garlic, appears in the Kitāb al-Wusla ilā l-habīb fī wasf al-tayyibāt wa-l-tīb;Lilia Zaouali, Medieval Cuisine of the Islamic World, University of California Press, 2007, ISBN 978-0-520-26174-7, translation of L'Islam a tavola (2004), p. 65 and a purée of chickpeas and tahini called hummus kasa appears in the Kitab Wasf al-Atima al-Mutada: it is based on puréed chickpeas and tahini, and acidulated with vinegar (though not lemon), but it also contains many spices, herbs, and nuts, and no garlic. It is also served by rolling it out and letting it sit overnight,Perry et al., p. 383 which presumably gives it a very different texture from hummus bi tahina.

==Nutritional information==

Hummus is high in iron and vitamin C and also has significant amounts of folate and vitamin B6.Bricklin, 1994, p. 115. The chickpeas are a good source of protein and dietary fiber; the tahini consists mostly of sesame seeds, which are an excellent source of the amino acid methionine, complementing the proteins in the chickpeas. Depending on the recipe, hummus carries varying amounts of monounsaturated fat.Hummus NutritionData.com Hummus is useful in vegetarian and vegan diets; like other combinations of grains and pulses, it serves as a complete protein when eaten with bread.

==Serving methods==

As an appetizer and dip, hummus is scooped with flatbread, such as pita. It is also served as part of a meze or as an accompaniment to falafel, grilled chicken, fish or eggplant. Garnishes include chopped tomato, cucumber, coriander, parsley, caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms, whole chickpeas, olive oil, hard-boiled eggs, paprika, sumac, ful, olives, pickles and pine nuts (as photographed in the "History" section). Outside the Middle East, it is sometimes served with tortilla chips or crackers.
Hummus ful (pronounced [tpl]IPA-ar|ˈfuːl|[/tpl]) is topped with a paste made from fava beans boiled until soft and then crushed. Hummus masubha/mashawsha is a mixture of hummus paste, warm chickpeas and tahini.

===Syria and Lebanon===

In Vegetarian Dishes from the Middle East, Arto der Haroutunian calls hummus, "One of the most popular and best-known of all Syrian dishes" and a "must on any mezzeh table."Arto der Hartoiunian  Vegetarian Dishes from the Middle East, London 1983, p.33. Syrians in Canada's Arab diaspora prepare and consume hummus along with other dishes like falafel, kibbe and tabouleh, even among the third and fourth-generation offspring of the original immigrants.[tpl]Citation|title=Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples|author=Paul R.

===Israel===

Hummus is a common part of everyday meals in Israel.Even mentioned by the Israel Defense Forces Cookbook, see Houston Chronicle "Diversity in the dining room helps ring in Israel's new year" A significant reason for the popularity of hummus in Israel is the fact that it is made from ingredients that, following Kashrut (Jewish dietary laws), can be combined with both meat and dairy meals. Few other foods can be combined with a wide variety of meals consistently with the dietary laws.Middle East, 2006, Lonely Planet, page 282 It is seen as almost equally popular amongst Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs. As a result of its popularity, Israelis elevated hummus to become a "national food symbol" and consume more than twice as much hummus as neighbouring Arab countries, according to figures by Tsabar Salads, a hummus manufacturer in Israel.Hummus brings Israelis, Palestinians to the table, The Christian Science Monitor, by Joshua Mitnick, July 25, 2007 Commenting on its popularity, Gil Hovav, an Israeli food editor interviewed on the BBC program Cooking in the Danger Zone, stated that "even during the intifada years Jews would sneak ... into the Muslim quarter just to have a vital, really genuine good humous [tpl]sic[/tpl]," and noted that like many dishes considered to be Israeli national foods, hummus is actually Arab.BBC Cooking in the Danger Zone: Israel and Palestinian Territories, pp. 5-6: "Humous is Arabic. Falafel, our national dish, our national Israeli dish, is completely Arabic and this salad that we call an Israeli Salad, actually it's an Arab salad, Palestinian salad." However, he also said, commenting on Iraqi, Egyptian, Syrian or Yemeni food in Israel, that "Jews came from these countries to Israel and they brought their food with them".Cooking in the Danger Zone: Israel and Palestinian Territories, page 3 Many restaurants run by Mizrahi Jews and Arab citizens of Israel are dedicated to hot hummus, which may be served as chick peas softened with baking soda along with garlic, olive oil, cumin and tahini. One of the fancier hummus versions available is hummus masabacha, made with lemon-spiked tahini garnished with whole chick peas, a sprinkling of paprika and a drizzle of olive oil.Food & Wine, May 2008; On the Hummus Hunt in Israel by Jen Murphy, p. 66, Hummus is sold in restaurants, supermarkets and hummus-only shops (known in Hebrew as humusiot).The perfect hummus debate

===Palestine and Jordan===

For Palestinians and Jordanians, hummus has long been a staple food, often served warm, with bread, for breakfast, lunch or dinner - usually on Friday mornings.Salloum and Peters, 1996, p. 204. All of the ingredients in hummus are easily found in Palestinian gardens, farms and markets, thus adding to the availability and popularity of the dish. In Palestinian areas, hummus is usually garnished, with olive oil, "nana" mint leaves, paprika, parsley or cumin.Ibrahim, Lailie, Institute for Middle East Understanding, Hummus, a Palestinian staple, 31 March 2006. Retrieved 9 March 2008. A related dish popular in the region of Palestine and Jordan is laban ma' hummus ("yogurt and chickpeas"), which uses yogurt in the place of tahini and butter in the place of olive oil and is topped with pieces of toasted bread.

===United States===

By the end of the 20th century, hummus had emerged as part of the American culinary fabric.Marks, Gil (2010), Encyclopedia of Jewish Food, John Wiley and Sons, pp. 269-271 In 2008, more than 15 million Americans consumed hummus on a regular basis. Hummus became a popular staple in American restaurants with the Armenian migration from Lebanon to Southern California and the East Coast after the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990).John Powell, "Encyclopedia of North American Immigration", Infobase Publishing, 2005, ISBN 1-4381-1012-X, 9781438110127, p. 176.[tpl]failed verification|date=January 2014[/tpl] It was further popularized in the United States by Jews returning from visits in Israel and by Israeli expatriates.
According to a 2010 market research, hummus consumption in the United States has increased by 35 percent over a period of 21 months, with sales reaching nearly $300 million. In 2006, hummus was present in 12 percent of American households, rising to 17 percent by early 2009.There’s Hummus Among Us By Elena Ferretti, Fox News, April 05, 2010 One commentator attributed the growth of Hummus to America’s embrace of ethnic foods, and to experimentation with exotic foods.
In November 2009, Gadi Lesin, President & CEO of the Israeli Strauss group food manufacturer said that market share of co-owned Sabra Dipping Company in the USA makes it the largest packaged hummus dip manufacturer in the world.[tpl]Citation |author=Aviv Levy |url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?QUID=1055,U1259186350557&did=1000517051 |title= זינוק במכירות חומוס שטראוס בארה"ב: כבשה 40% מהשוק |date=25 November 2009 |publisher=Globes |accessdate=25 November 2009[/tpl].

==Controversy==

In October 2008, the Association of Lebanese Industrialists petitioned to the Lebanese Ministry of Economy and Trade to request protected status from the European Commission for hummus as a uniquely Lebanese food, similar to the Protected Geographical Status rights held over regional food items by various European Union countries.Karam, Zeina, "Hummus war looms between Lebanon and Israel", Associated Press, 7 October 2008. Retrieved 10 December 2008.
Fadi Abboud, president of the Lebanese Industrialists Association, stated that "Israelis have usurped several Lebanese and oriental products".http://www.ali.org.lb/foodcampaignarticles.html According to Abboud, Lebanon exported the first hummus dish in 1959.[tpl]Cite news |title=Hummus war between Lebanon, Israel escalates |url=http://www.yalibnan.com/2010/01/09/hummus-war-between-lebanon-israel-escalates/ |newspaper=YaLIBNAN|date=January 9, 2010 |deadurl=no |accessdate=13 February 2014[/tpl]
As a response, food critic Janna Gur wrote: "The success of certain brands of Israeli hummus abroad may have been what brought about Abboud's anger", leading him to claim that Israel has been "stealing" their country's national dishes, like hummus, falafel, tabbouleh, and baba ghanouj.Gur, Janna (cited as 'Jana'), Santa Fe New Mexican, "Hummus History: Tales of a Wandering Chickpea", 21 October 2008. Retrieved 11 December 2008.
Also in response to Abboud's statement, Shooky Galili, an Israeli journalist specialising in food and who writes a blog dedicated to hummus,http://humus101.com/EN said that "trying to make a copyright claim over hummus is like claiming for the rights to bread or wine. ... Hummus is a centuries old Arab dish — nobody owns it, it belongs to the region".
As of late 2009, the Lebanese Industrialists Association was still "preparing documents and proof" to support its claim."Lebanese score in hummus war with Israel", Associated Press, 24 October 2009
