==Background==

While talking about the track, Ruffo said "If you listen to the artists that influenced me – Justin Timberlake, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Queen – and you listen to their vocal production, it's really intricate. We really tried to emulate the sound of a Quincy Jones-type production on this song. The idea was trying to bring some of the old skool vibe back, and I think that's sort of making a return with artists like Bruno Mars, Daft Punk/Pharrell and Robin Thicke anyway. In that sense it's actually the perfect time to release a song like this." http://www.hot91.com.au/music/845-johnny-ruffo-releases-new-single-untouchable
