Craven Cottage is the name of a football stadium located in Fulham, London. It has been the home ground of the Premier League club Fulham F.C. since 1896.
The ground's current capacity is 25,700, all-seated, though the record attendance is 49,335, for a game against Millwall Dockers, 8 October 1938.[tpl]cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/feature/_/id/841079?cc=5739 |title=A brief history of Fulham | first=Rob | last=Smyth |publisher=ESPNFC |date=5 July 2012|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl] Located next to Bishop's Park on the banks of the River Thames,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/visit/craven-cottage/cafe-at-the-cottage |title=Café at the Cottage |publisher=Fulham F.C.|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://voices.yahoo.com/best-stadiums-london-football-game-149949.html |title=Best Stadiums for the London Football Game | first=Sabah | last=Karimi |publisher=Yahoo |date=6 January 2007|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl] 'Craven Cottage' was originally a royal hunting lodge and has history dating back over 300 years.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jbYQ4gS05EEC&pg=PT17&lpg=PT17&dq=%E2%80%9DCRAVEN+COTTAGE%E2%80%9C+HUNTING+LODGE&source=bl&ots=aCQ6PgI_AI&sig=Oqz1mO7SPL22sIHGb6DJvvQGUmk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0VeKUv2wNOKy7AbD0YGICQ&ved=0CH4Q6AEwDg#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9DCRAVEN%20COTTAGE%E2%80%9C%20HUNTING%20LODGE&f=false |title=The football and real ale guide: Premiership | first=Richard | last=Stedman |publisher=Stedders Guides|year=2006|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl]

==History==

===Pre-Fulham===

The original 'Cottage' was built in 1780, by William Craven, the sixth Baron Craven[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2011/may/20/a-place-in-history |title=A Place In History |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=20 May 2011|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl] and was located on the centre circle of the pitch. At the time, the surrounding areas were woods which made up part of Anne Boleyn's hunting grounds.
The Cottage was lived in by Edward Bulwer-Lytton (who wrote The Last Days of Pompeii[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/Last-Days-Pompeii-Dodo-Press/dp/1406521647 |title=The Last Days of Pompeii | first=Edward | last=Bulwer-Lytton |publisher=Dodo Press |accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]) and other somewhat notable (and moneyed) persons until it was destroyed by fire in May 1888. Many rumours persist among Fulham fans of past tenants of Craven Cottage. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,   Jeremy Bentham,  Florence Nightingale and even Queen Victoria are reputed to have stayed there, although there is no real evidence for this. Following the fire, the site was abandoned. Fulham had had 8 previous grounds[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/july/01/moments-that-made-ffc |title=50 Moments That Made Fulham: 10. The Formation of the Club - 1879 |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=1 July 2013|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] before settling in at Craven Cottage for good. Therefore, The Cottagers have had 12 grounds overall (including a temporary stay at Loftus Road[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/september/11/top-10-loftus-road-matches |title=Top 10: Loftus Road Matches |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=11 September 2013|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]), meaning that only their former 'landlords' and rivals QPR have had more home grounds (14) in British football. Of particular note, was Ranelagh House, Fulham's palatial home from 1886–1888.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.derelictlondon.com/londons-long-lost-sports-grounds.html |title=London's Long Lost Sports Grounds |publisher=Derelict London |accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]

===Under construction: 1894–1905===

When representatives of Fulham first came across the land, in 1894, it was so overgrown that it took two years to be made suitable for football to be played on it. A deal was struck for the owners of the ground to carry out the work, in return for which they would receive a proportion of the gate receipts.
The first football match at which there were any gate receipts was when Fulham played against Minerva in the Middlesex Senior Cup, on 10 October 1896. The ground's first stand was built shortly after. Described as looking like an "orange box", it consisted of four wooden structures each holding some 250 seats, and later was affectionately nicknamed the "rabbit hutch".
In 1904 London County Council became concerned with the level of safety at the ground, and tried to get it closed. A court case followed in January 1905, as a result of which Archibald Leitch, a Scottish architect who had risen to prominence after his building of the Ibrox Stadium, a few years earlier,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.therangersarchive.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=93&Itemid=128 |title=Archibald Leitch - 'Engineering Archie': The Designer of Ibrox |publisher=The Rangers Archive |accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] was hired to work on the stadium. In a scheme costing £15,000 (a record for the time[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19009781 |title=Fulham's plans to increase Craven Cottage capacity approved |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 July 2012|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]), he built a pavilion (the present-day 'Cottage' itself) and the Stevenage Road Stand, in his characteristic red brick style.
The stand on Stevenage Road celebrated its centenary in the 2005–2006 season[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2005/august/15/stevenage-road-centenary |title=Stevenage Road Centenary |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=15 August 2005|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] and, following the death of Fulham FC's favourite son, former England captain Johnny Haynes, in a car accident in October 2005[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4353732.stm |title=Legendary Haynes dies after crash |publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 October 2005|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] the Stevenage Road Stand was renamed the Johnny Haynes Stand after the club sought the opinions of Fulham supporters.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/4480816.stm |title=Fulham re-name stand after Haynes |publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 November 2005|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]
Both the Johnny Haynes Stand and Cottage remain among the finest examples of Archibald Leitch football architecture to remain in existence and both have been designated as Grade II listed buildings.

===Establishing itself as a stadium===

An England v Wales match was played at the ground in 1907,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=90 |title=England 1 - 1 Wales |publisher=England Stats |date=18 March 1907|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/englandmatchreports/090-wales-1907 |title=England 1 - 1 Wales |publisher=England Match Reports |date=18 March 1907|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] followed by a rugby league international between England and Australia in 1911.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/kangaroos-tour-1911/game-7/england-vs-australia.html |title=England 6 lost to Australia 11 |publisher=The Rugby League Project |date=18 October 2011|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]
One of the club's directors Henry Norris, and his friend William Hall, took over Arsenal in the early 1910s,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/laying-the-foundations/club-moves-from-woolwich-to-highbury |title=Club moves from Woolwich to Highbury |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=16 December 2008|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] the plan being to merge Fulham with Arsenal,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/arsenal-stadium-highbury/arsenal-stadium-a-history |title=Highbury - A history |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=14 July 2008|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] to form a "London superclub" at Craven Cottage.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IcsXyTmY7MoC&pg=PT15&lpg=PT15&dq=ARSENAL+FULHAM+%E2%80%9CLONDON+SUPERCLUB%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=DM3r1GUKu3&sig=BbYTd_0Gmk1w80UEAqnyAdGwAgg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qVOLUsnLAtPN7AadyYHADw&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=ARSENAL%20FULHAM%20%E2%80%9CLONDON%20SUPERCLUB%E2%80%9D&f=false |title=Rebels for the Cause: The Alternative History of Arsenal Football Club | first=Jon | last=Spurling |publisher=Random House |date=2 November 2012|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] This move was largely motivated by Fulham's failure thus far to gain promotion to the top division of English football. There were also plans for Henry Norris to build a larger stadium on the other side of Stevenage Road but there was little need after the merger idea failed. During this era, the Cottage was used for choir singing and marching bands along with other performances, and Mass.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs0LBqzEDIM&feature=relmfuhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKDAASBY8yE&feature=relmfu
In 1933 there were plans to demolish the ground and start again from scratch with a new 80,000 capacity stadium. These plans never materialised mainly due to the Great Depression.
On 8 October 1938, 49,335 spectators watched Fulham play Millwall. The reason for this exceptionally large crowd was that the game at Stamford Bridge had suddenly been cancelled and so a lot of people made their way west to the Cottage that afternoon instead. It was the largest attendance ever at Craven Cottage and the record remains today, unlikely to be bettered as it is now an all-seater stadium with currently no room for more than 25,700. During the 1930-60's era, Fulham often averaged over 25,000. However, the official attendances can be considered somewhat dubious in this era as many fans would get in by climbing over the fence from Bishops Park into the Putney End. As at many other grounds, fans would sometimes pay at the turnstiles but not be counted.  This boot money would be given to the players (stuffed in their boots) and would not be counted in the gate money. The ground hosted several football games for the 1948 Summer Olympics.1948 Summer Olympics official report. pp. 45–6.

===Post-War===

It wasn't until after Fulham first reached the top division, in 1949, that further improvements were made to the stadium. In 1962 Fulham became the final side in the first division to erect floodlights.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/august/22/throwback-thursday |title=1962: Cook Lights Up The Cottage |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=22 August 2013|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] The floodlights were said to be the most expensive in Europe at the time as they were so modern. The lights were like large pylons towering 50 metres over the ground and were similar in appearance to those at the WACA. An electronic scoreboard was installed on the Riverside Terrace at the same time as the floodlights were installed and flagpoles flying the flags of all of the other first division teams were flown from them.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/fulham/171403/the-black-and-white-years-scorching-vintage-photos-of-fulhams-craven-cottage-between-1923-1978.html |title=The Black-And-White Years: Scorching Vintage Photos Of Fulham’s Craven Cottage, Between 1923-1978 | first=Chris | last=Wright |publisher=Who Ate All The Pies? |date=30 July 2013|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl] Following the sale of Alan Mullery to Tottenham Hotspur in 1964 (for £72,500) the Hammersmith End had a roof put over it[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/fulham-go-from-laughing-stock-to-serious-players-1947790.html |title=Fulham go from laughing stock to serious players | first=Steve | last=Tongue |publisher=Independent |date=18 April 2010|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl] at a cost of approximately £42,500.
Although Fulham was relegated, the development of Craven Cottage continued.

The stand is now better known as the Riverside Stand.
On Boxing Day 1963, Craven Cottage was the venue of the fastest hat-trick in the history of the English football league, which was completed in less than three minutes, by Graham Leggat. This helped his Fulham team to beat Ipswich 10–1 (a club record).Three minutes is the time quoted by his official website.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/incoming/article6235.ece/BINARY/Fulham+10-1+Ipswich |title=Ten for The 'Turkeys' | first=Bill | last=Holden |publisher=Daily Mirror |date=27 December 1963|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl] The international record is held by Jimmy O'Connor, an Irish player who notched up his hat trick in 2 minutes 14 seconds in 1967.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bournemouth/3485294.stm |title=Hayter keeps feet on ground | first=Mark | last=Mitchener |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 February 2004|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]
Between 1980 and 1984, Fulham rugby league played their home games at the Cottage. They have since evolved into the London Crusaders, the London Broncos and Harlequins Rugby League before reverting to London Broncos ahead of the 2012 season.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-league/15353867 |title=Harlequins revert to London Broncos name again for 2012 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 November 2011|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] Craven Cottage held the team's largest ever crowd at any ground with 15,013, at a game against Wakefield Trinity on 15 February 1981.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.napit.co.uk/viewus/infobank/rugby/superleague/harlequinsrl.php |title=Harlequins RLFC |publisher=Napit |accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]

===Modern times===

When the Hillsborough disaster occurred, Fulham were in the second bottom rung of The Football League,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/fulham/1988-1989/table |title=Fulham 1988-1989 : English Division Three (old) Table |publisher=Statto |accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl] but following the Taylor report Fulham's ambitious chairman Jimmy Hill tabled plans in 1996 for an all-seater stadium.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2395783/Fulham-pushed-out-Hill.html |title=Fulham pushed out Hill | first=Mihir | last=Bose |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=7 February 2003|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl] These plans never came to fruition, partly due to local residents' pressure groups, and by the time Fulham reached the Premiership, they still had standing areas in the ground, something virtually unheard of at the time. A year remained to do something about this (teams reaching the second tier for the first time are allowed a three-year period to reach the required standards for the top two divisions),[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/plymouth_argyle/6740273.stm |title=Plymouth forced to close terrace |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 August 2012|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19095689 |title=Peterborough back calls for safe standing at football grounds |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 June 2007|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-12600812 |title=Colchester MP wants return of football standing areas |publisher=BBC News |date=28 February 2011|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl] but by the time the last league game was played there, against Leicester City on 27 April 2002, no building plans had been made.

After one and a half seasons at Loftus Road, no work had been done on the Cottage. In December 2003, plans were unveiled for £8million worth of major refurbishment work to bring it in line with Premier League requirements.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/3326021.stm |title=Fulham return to Cottage |publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 December 2003|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://legacy.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning_decisions/strategic_dev/2004/jan0704/craven_cottage_appendix.pdf |title=Craven Cottage Stadium (Fulham Football Club) |publisher=Greater London Authority|date=3 December 2003|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl] With planning permission granted, work began in January 2004 in order to meet the deadline of the new season.

Their first game in the new-look 22,000 all-seater stadium was a pre-season friendly against Watford on 10 July 2004.

===Plans===

On 27 July 2012, Fulham FC were granted permission to redevelop the Riverside Stand, increasing the capacity of Craven Cottage to 30,000 seats.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11681/7939236/Cottage-expansion-granted |title=Cottage expansion granted |publisher=Sky Sports |date=27 July 2012|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl]http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2011/october/08/fulham-forever Beforehand various rumours arose including plans to return to ground-sharing with QPR in a new 40,000 seater White City stadium,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2370480/Fayed-scheme-for-Fulham-switch-to-new-White-City-stadium.html |title=Fayed scheme for Fulham switch to new White City stadium | first=Mihir | last=Bose |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=1 January 2004|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3774/the-sweeper/2012/01/28/2869994/the-sweeper-fulham-approached-by-qpr-about-interest-in-sharing-a- |title=The Sweeper: Fulham approached by QPR about interest in sharing a new stadium | first=Wayne | last=Versey |publisher=goal.com |date=28 January 2012|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl] although these now appear firmly on hold with the construction of the Westfield shopping centre on the proposed site. The board seem to have moved away from their ambition to make Fulham the "Manchester United of the south" as it became clear how expensive such a plan would be.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/08/premier-league-preview-fulham |title=Premier League preview No7: Fulham | first=Paul | last=Doyle |publisher=Guardian |date=8 August 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl] Yet Fulham's comfortable Premier League table positions in the previous years and the fact that, for the previous three seasons the ground has been filled to capacity, means stadium expansion is a viable option. With large spaces of land at a premium in south-west London, Fulham appear to be committed to a gradual increase of the ground's capacity often during the summer between seasons. The capacity of Craven Cottage has been increased during summers for instance in 2008 with a small increase in the capacity of the Hammersmith End. Fulham previously announced in 2007 that they are planning to increase the capacity of Craven Cottage by 4,000 seats,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/News/NewsArticles/2007/October/CottageRelease.aspx |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120421203942/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/News/NewsArticles/2007/October/CottageRelease.aspx |archivedate=21 April 2012 |title=Stadium Announcement |publisher= Fulham F.C.|date=3 April 2007 |accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl] but this is yet to be implemented.  There was also proposals for a bridge to span the Thames, for a redeveloped Riverside stand and a museum.:File:Model of proposed bridge.jpg[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/jan/17/newsstory.sport8?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 | work=The Guardian | first=Paul | last=Kelso | title=Development at Craven Cottage to include museum | date=17 January 2003[/tpl]
More substantial plans arose in October 2011 with the 'Fulham Forever' campaign.http://www.fulhamfc.com/stadium-development With Al-Fayed selling his Harrods department store for £1.5 billion in May 2010[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8669657.stm |title=Mohammed Al Fayed sells Harrods store to Qatar Holdings|publisher=BBC News|date=8 May 2010|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl] it is reasonable to presume that some of this money which has kick-started this larger scale plan into life. A detailed plan into the possibilities of expansion highlighted the Riverside Stand as the only viable area for expansion. The scheme involves the demolition of the back of the Riverside Stand with a new tier of seating added on top of the current one and a row of corporate boxes; bringing Craven Cottage up to 30,000 capacity.http://www.stadiumguide.com/fulham-and-brighton-push-for-stadium-expansion/ As this would be a major project in a sensitive area the club has taken into consideration many points local residents may have problems with. The riverside walk would be re-opened, light pollution would be reduced with the removal of floodlight masts, new access points would make match-day crowds more manageable and the new stand would be respectful in design to its position on the River Thames. Although there is no time scheme for when the project will begin, the club is already far into the consultation phase and it appeared would like to begin soon during 2012-13.http://www.fulhamfc.com/stadium-development/construction-phase Buckingham Group Contracting were chosen in March 2013 as the construction company for the project.http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2013/03/12/buckingham-set-to-score-with-15m-fulham-refurb/

==The ground as it stands==

===Hammersmith End===

The Hammersmith End (or Hammy) is the northernmost stand in the ground, the closest to Hammersmith. The roofing was financed through the sale of Alan Mullery to Spurs. It is traditionally the "home" end where the more vocal Fulham fans sit,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/help/faq/a-to-z-reference-guides |title=A to Z Reference Guides |publisher=Fulham F.C. |accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/help/faq/visiting-the-cottage |title=Visiting The Cottage |publisher=Fulham F.C.|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl] and many stand during games at the back rows of the stand. If Fulham win the toss, they usually choose to play towards the Hammersmith End in the second half. The stand had terracing until the reopening of the ground in 2004, when it was replaced with seating in order to comply with league rules following the Taylor Report. For several seasons, national flags of the players represented at Fulham were hung from the roof.[tpl]cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fulham_v_Pompey_(1).JPG#file |title=File:Fulham v Pompey (1).JPG |publisher=Wikipedia |accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl] There is a large permanent banner in the river corner reading "We Are Fulham".[tpl]cite web |url=http://cravencottagenewsround.wordpress.com/2008/03/01/slouching-towards-cheltenham-fulham-0-3-manchester-utd/ |title=Slouching towards Cheltenham: Fulham 0-3 Manchester Utd |publisher=Craven Cottage Newsround |date=1 March 2008|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl]

===Putney End===

The Putney End is the southernmost stand in the ground, nearest to Putney and backing onto Bishops Park.  This generally hosts visiting and 'neutral' supporters, though often this is mixed with home and away fans. When the ground became redeveloped, with the standing terraces replaced in 2003-04 the club applied for a licence to have a designated neutral area, in the rows closest to the Cottage, (nicknamed 'Little Switzerland'.http://bryanprzybilla.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/a-reminder-of-the-past-craven-cottage-brings-out-the-old-time-feel/) Due to Fulham's history of having no segregation in the Putney End and no history of crowd trouble, the FA gave the club special dispensation to allow for this, making Fulham the only club currently in the UK to have such an area.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.shoot.co.uk/stadium-special-4/ |title=Stadium special| first=George | last=Preece |publisher=Shoot |date=17 September 2013|accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl] Flags of every nationality in the Fulham squad were hung from the roofing, although they were removed after the 2006–07 season commenced and there is now an electronic scoreboard in place. There is a plane tree in the corner by the river,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/epltalk/304406352/ |title=Tree at Craven Cottage | first=The | last=Gaffer |publisher=Flickr |date=23 November 2006|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl] the only remaining tree in a senior British football ground.

===Riverside Stand===

The Riverside was originally terracing that backed onto the Thames. It also featured large advertising hoardings above the fans. By 1973, a proper seated stand had been built called the Eric Miller Stand (one of the directors at the time). The stand was opened in a prestigious friendly against S.L. Benfica, who included Eusébio in the team. The name of the stand became called simply The Riverside after the discovery of Eric Miller's suicide, who had been under investigation for fraud and embezzlement.
The Riverside Stand backs onto the River Thames and is elevated uniquely above the pitch[tpl]cite web |url=http://webzoom.freewebs.com/questforthe92/Fulham%20-%20Riverside%20Stand.JPG |title=Fulham - Riverside Stand.JPG | first=Richard | last=Hooper |publisher=Quest for the 92|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl] unlike the other 3 stands. It contains the corporate hospitality seating alongside Fulham fans. Jimmy Hill once referred to the Riverside being "a bit like the London Palladium" as Blocks V & W (the middle section) are often filled with the rich and famous (including often Al-Fayed). There are several Harrods advertising boardings and above these is the gantry, for the press and cameras. Tickets in this area are often the easiest to buy, not surprisingly they are also some of the more expensive.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/tickets/season-tickets/pricing-and-stadium-map |title=2013/14 Season Ticket Prices|publisher=Fulham F.C. |accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl] It has the Hammersmith End to its left, the Putney End to its right and is opposite the Johnny Haynes Stand.  During the 70s, Craven Cottage flooded, with water gushing in from the Riverside. The stand houses the George Cohen restaurant,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/hospitality/packages/george-cohen-restaurant |title=George Cohen Restaurant |publisher=Fulham F.C. |accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl] while on non-match days there is the Cottage Cafe, located near to the Cottage itself. (The River Café is also located nearby).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rivercafe.co.uk/rc_page.php?pg_id=12 |title=River Café |publisher=River Café |accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=loc:51.483889,-0.224167&hl=en&ll=51.479084,-0.22037&spn=0.017373,0.038581&t=h&z=15 |title=loc: 51.483889,-0.224167 |publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl] Under Tommy Trinder's chairmanship in the 60s, flags of all other teams in the Division 1 were proudly flown along the Thames. However, when Fulham were relegated in 1968,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/fulham/1967-1968/table |title=Fulham 1967-1968 : English Division One (old) Table |publisher=Statto |accessdate=22 November 2013[/tpl] Trinder decided not to change the flags as "Fulham won't be in this division next season". True to Tommy's prophecy, Fulham were relegated again.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/fulham/1968-1969/table |title=Fulham 1968-1969 : English Division Two (old) Table |publisher=Statto |accessdate=22 November 2013[/tpl] There is now a campaign to bring back the flags again.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl] The roof of the stand has been used by sponsors, with FxPro currently advertising in this way,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article7981884.ece/BINARY/original/Craven-Cottage.jpg |title=independent.co.uk |publisher=Independent|accessdate=22 November 2013[/tpl] and Pipex.com,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.premierfootballbooks.co.uk/images/fulham_aerial.jpg |title=premierfootballbooks.co.uk |publisher=Premier Football Books|accessdate=22 November 2013[/tpl] Lee Cooper Jeans and LG[tpl]cite web |url=http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2463/3586034488_bf80d76046_z.jpg?zz=1 |title=staticflickr.com |publisher=Flickr|accessdate=22 November 2013[/tpl] having previously done so. The end of the Riverside Stand towards the 'Smithy' End' indicates the end of the 'Fulham Wall', which is the mile post in The Boat Race.

===Johnny Haynes Stand===

Originally called the Stevenage Road Stand, after the road it backs onto,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.footballgroundguide.com/fulham/#Craven-Cottage-Fulham-Layout |title=Football Ground Guide: Craven Cottage, Fulham FC - Ground Layout |publisher=Football Ground Guide|accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl] the Johnny Haynes stand is the oldest remaining football stand in the Football League, originally constructed in 1905, and is a Grade II* listed building. Designed by Archibald Leitch, the stand contains the ticket office and club shop and features original wooden seating. Following his death in 2005, the stand was renamed after former player Johnny Haynes.
The exterior facing Stevenage Road has a brick façade[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/25645678@N06/sets/72157621791140557/detail/ |title=Craven Cottage Fulham FC Inside & Out |publisher=Flickr |date=1 August 2009|accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl] and features the club's old emblem in the artwork. Decorative pillars show the club's foundation date as 1880 though this is thought to be incorrect. Also, a special stone to commemorate Fulham 2000 and The Cottagers' return to Craven Cottage was engraved on the façade. The family enclosures are located in the two corners of the stand, one nearest to the Hammersmith End and one nearest to the Putney End.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/tickets/-/media/Tickets/Season%20Tickets/2013-14/Family%20Zone%20Season%20Ticket.ashx |title=Family Zone Season Tickets |publisher=Fulham F.C.|accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl] The front of the stand now contains plastic seating, but originally was a standing area. Children were often placed at the front of this enclosure and the area had a distinctive white picket fence to keep fans off the pitch up until the 1970s.

===The Pavilion===

The Cottage Pavilion dates back to 1905 along with the Johnny Haynes Stand, built by renowned football architect Archibald Leitch. The reason The Cottage was built was due to an oversight in the Stevenage Road Stand (as it was then), as Leitch had forgotten to accommodate changing rooms in his final plans.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/article/away-day-guide-fulham-872498.aspx |title=Away Day Guide: Fulham |publisher=Crystal Palace F.C. |date=29 July 2013|accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl] Besides being the changing rooms, the Cottage (also called The Clubhouse) is traditionally used by the players' families and friends who sit on the balcony to watch the game. In the past, board meetings used to be held in The Cottage itself as well. There is a large tapestry draped from the Cottage which says "Still Believe". It encapsulates the now-famous moment, when fans facing defeat against Hamburg SV in the Europa League semi-final roused the players with the chant of "Stand up if you still believe".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/fulham/7653889/Fulham-v-Hamburg-Roy-Hodgson-shows-his-England-manager-credentials.html |title=Fulham v Hamburg: Roy Hodgson shows his England manager credentials | first=John | last=Ley |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=29 April 2010|accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/30/fulham-hamburg-europa-league |title=Fulham's greatest game sees them back on the road to Hamburg | first=David | last=Hytner |publisher=Guardian |date=30 April 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philmcnulty/2010/04/hodgson_takes_the_acclaim.html |title=Hodgson and Fulham deserve the acclaim | first=Phil | last=McNulty |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 April 2010|accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl] In the three other corners of the ground there are what have been described as large 'filing cabinets', which are corporate boxes on three levels.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8al_iPsc0jQ
