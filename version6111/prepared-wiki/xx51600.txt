In evolutionary biology, mimicry is the similarity of one species to another which protects one or both.[tpl]cite book | last=King | first=R. C. | last2=Stansfield | first2=W. D. | last3=Mulligan | first3=P. K. | year=2006 | title=A dictionary of genetics | edition=7th | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | page=278 | isbn=0-19-530762-3 [/tpl] This similarity can be in appearance, behaviour, sound, scent and location. The mimics are found in similar places to their models. 
Mimicry occurs when a group of organisms,This "group" is often a species, but can also be a subgroup such as one particular sex or morph the mimics, evolve to share common perceived characteristics with another group, the models.In its broadest definition mimicry can include non-living models. The evolution is driven by the selective action of a signal-receiver or dupe.[tpl]cite journal | author=Wickler, W. | authorlink=Wolfgang Wickler | year=1965 | title=Mimicry and the evolution of animal communication | journal=Nature| volume=208 | issue=5010| pages =519–21 | doi =10.1038/208519a0 |bibcode = 1965Natur.208..519W [/tpl] Birds, for example, use sight to identify palatable insects (the mimics), whilst avoiding the noxious models. 
The model is usually another species except in cases of automimicry. The signal-receiver is typically another intermediate organism like the common predator of two species, but may actually be the model itself, such as a moth resembling its spider predator.{{cite web | url=http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2006/12/22/the-moth-in-spiders-clothing/ | title=A moth in spider's clothing Mimicry is related to camouflage, in which a species resembles its surroundings or is otherwise difficult to detect. In particular, mimesis, in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism, but one to which the dupe is indifferent, is an area of overlap between camouflage and mimicry.[tpl]cite journal | author = Pasteur, G. | date = 1982 | title = A classificatory review of mimicry systems |  journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 169–199 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 [/tpl] For example, animals such as flower mantises, planthoppers and geometer moth caterpillars that resemble twigs, bark, leaves or flowers are mimetic.p51 Crypsis (in the broad sense) is sometimes used to encompass all forms of avoiding detection, such as mimicry, camouflage and hiding.[tpl]cite book | author=Ruxton, G.

Though visual mimicry is most obvious to humans, other senses such as olfaction (smell) or hearing may be involved, and more than one type of signal may be employed.[tpl]cite book | author=Wickler, W. | year=1968 | title=Mimicry in plants and animals | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=New York [/tpl] Mimicry may involve morphology, behaviour, and other properties. In any case, the signal always functions to deceive the receiver by preventing it from correctly identifying the mimic. In evolutionary terms, this phenomenon is a form of co-evolution usually involving an evolutionary arms race.p161 It should not be confused with convergent evolution, which occurs when species come to resemble one another independently by adapting to similar lifestyles.
Mimics may have different models for different life cycle stages, or they may be polymorphic, with different individuals imitating different models. Models themselves may have more than one mimic, though frequency dependent selection favors mimicry where models outnumber mimics. Models tend to be relatively closely related organisms, but mimicry of vastly different species is also known. Most known mimics are insects, though many other animal mimics, including mammals, are known. Plants and fungi may also be mimics, though less research has been carried out in this area.[tpl]cite journal | author=Boyden, T.

==Etymology==

Use of the word mimicry dates back to 1637. It is derived from the Greek term mimetikos, "imitative", in turn from mimetos, the verbal adjective of mimeisthai, "to imitate". Originally used to describe people, it was only applied to other forms of life after 1851.[tpl]cite web | title=Online Etymology Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=mimicry&searchmode=none| author=Douglas Harper | date=2007-10-06[/tpl]

==Classification==

Many types of mimicry have been described. An overview of each follows, highlighting the similarities and differences between the various forms. Classification is often based on function with respect to the mimic (e.g. avoiding harm). Some cases may belong to more than one class, e.g. automimicry and aggressive mimicry are not mutually exclusive, as one describes the species relationship between model and mimic, while the other describes the function for the mimic (obtaining food).

===Defensive===

Defensive or protective mimicry takes place when organisms are able to avoid encounters that would be harmful to them by deceiving enemies into treating them as something else. The first three such cases discussed here entail mimicry of organisms protected by warning colouration: Batesian mimicry, where a harmless mimic poses as harmful; Müllerian mimicry, where two or more harmful species mutually advertise themselves as harmful; and Mertensian mimicry, where a deadly mimic resembles a less harmful but lesson-teaching model. The fourth case, Vavilovian mimicry, where weeds resemble crops, is important for several reasons; and humans are the agent of selection.
