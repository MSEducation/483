==History==

West Air Luxembourg was created in 2002 by West Air Europe as a sister company to West Air Sweden both to avoid the increasing labor costs of its Swedish operations and to move closer to the operational and decision centers of most of its customers. Over time, most of the West Air Sweden fleet was transferred to the West Air Luxembourg AOC, but the principal activity remained proving feeder services to the major overnight express carriers.
In 2011, parent West Air Europe agreed to merge with Atlantic Airlines to form West Atlantic.
In October 2013, West Atlantic announced the sale of its West Air Luxembourg subsidiary to FAST Logistics Luxembourg.http://www.westatlantic.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WAA-Publish.pdf Prior to the sale, West Atlantic moved all but one aircraft in the West Air Luxembourg fleet to the AOC of West Air Sweden.
