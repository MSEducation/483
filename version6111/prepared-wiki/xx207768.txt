Bay Area Bisexual Network (BABN) is social and networking group in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is the oldest and largest bisexual group in the San Francisco Bay Area. Since 1987 BABN has welcomed people who are just coming out or new to the area to have opportunities to meet and talk with other bisexuals.

==History==

Founded in 1987, BABN was the successor to the San Francisco Bisexual Center, which closed in 1984. It was inspired by the East Coast Bisexual Network Conference, and was founded by Lani Ka'ahumanu, Ann Justi and Maggi Rubenstein.[tpl]cite web|last=Cassell|first=Heather|title=Bisexual network celebrates 25 years|url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=68259|work=The Bay Area Reporter|accessdate=30 April 2013[/tpl] For nearly 10 years, BABN coordinated a speaker's bureau, a newsletter, retreats, and monthly cultural and educational forums. BABNâ€™s phone line offered one of very few ways for isolated bisexuals to find and connect with the bisexual community. Bi-Friendly was founded by BABN in 1988 as a way for bisexual and bi-friendly people to meet and socialize outside of bars and activist meetings. The group sponsored brunches, trips to the redwoods, movies, plays, baseball games etc.[tpl]cite web|title=About BABN|url=http://www.bayareabisexualnetwork.org/about-babn.html|work=Bay Area Bisexual Network|accessdate=30 April 2013[/tpl] BABN is holding Bi-Friendly meetings as of 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=BiFriendly|url=http://www.bayareabisexualnetwork.org/bifriendly.html|work=Bay Area Bisexual Network|accessdate=30 April 2013[/tpl]

For hundreds of bisexual people, the email lists are their only contact to the bi community. BABN also has social networking groups on Facebook, Tribe.net and others. A calendar of events is the most-used feature of the BABN website.[tpl]cite web|title=Calendar|url=http://www.bayareabisexualnetwork.org/calendar.html|work=Bay Area Bisexual Network|accessdate=30 April 2013[/tpl]
