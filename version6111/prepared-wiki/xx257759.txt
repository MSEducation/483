==Background==

Born in Hamilton, Ohio in 1962, Crystal Wilkinson was brought to her grandparents' farm in Indian Creek, Kentucky (about three miles east of Middleburg, Kentucky) when she was only six weeks old.  The only Black family in the area and like many farmers in Appalachia, Silas Wilkinson grew cash crops of tobacco and corn and produced sorghum molasses; and, given the few jobs available for African-American women in eastern Kentucky, Christine Wilkinson cleaned and cooked in the homes of the local schoolteachers of Casey County.  Wilkinson wrote that she "lived an enchanted childhood" and that her grandparents "gave me the freedom to explore the countryside and to write, to dream, to discover."[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] She wrote about her childhood and her upbringing in her award-winning book, Blackberries, Blackberries:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tobypress.com/books/blackberries.htm |title=Blackberries, Blackberries, by Crystal Wilkinson |publisher=The Toby Press |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21[/tpl]
