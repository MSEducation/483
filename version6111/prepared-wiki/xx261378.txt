Smither A history of the oratorio p.395.
The oratorio marks a departure from the settings of actual Gospel passion narratives such as the Latin Passio Secundum Ioannem of Alessandro Scarlatti to a more theatrical style. The four central roles are S. Pietro, S. Giovanni, Maria Maddalena, Giuseppe d'Arimatea - with John, Mary Magdalene and Joseph of Arimathea answering Peter's questions about the crucifixion.
