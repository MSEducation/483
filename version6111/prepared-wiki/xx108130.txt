Travis John "Chunks" Friend (born 7 January 1981 in Kwekwe, Midlands) is a former Zimbabwean Test and One Day International cricketer. Friend captained Zimbabwe in four under-19 ODIs and went on to play a full senior ODI for Zimbabwe aged 19. A stress fracture to his back set him back, but he later returned to the Test squad. One of the 15 "rebels" of Zimbabwean cricket, his international cricket career ended in 2004. In 2005 he was contracted by Derbyshire but made little impact in the County Championship and was not retained for 2006. In 2009 he signed up for the summer with Castletown Cricket Club on the Isle of Man â€“ the first time any of the island's teams could boast a former Test player.
He is now a commercial pilot and has worked for airlines such as Flybe and Qatar Airways.
