Destination Beyond is an album by the American ambient musician Steve Roach, released in 2009.  Roach infuses his signature atmospheric fabric of sound with a springy, trance-like groove reminiscent of the rhythm found in Arc of Passion.

==Concept==

As the title implies, Destination Beyond is a meditation on motion and the infinite point on the horizon that can never be reached.  The album includes a small introspection on this theme.  Roach writes that the "magnetic pull and drive towards the point on the horizon, towards the destination beyond . . . remains a constant theme and impetus in my life."

==Production==

Destination Beyond was created with analog synthesizers using real-time processing to produce a "pure natural flow."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.projekt.com/projekt/product.asp?sku=PRO00235 |title=Roach, Steve: Destination Beyond |publisher=Projekt |accessdate=3 February 2010[/tpl]
