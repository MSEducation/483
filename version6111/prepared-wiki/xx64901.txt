Austria and other European nations maintained an extensive system of post offices in the Ottoman Empire, typically motivated by the unreliable postal system of the Ottomans.

==First and last service period==

Austria gained permission in 1721 from the Ottoman Empire to operate a postal service for official correspondence only and subsequently this was extended to the opening of post offices and carrying mail for merchants.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M1DQooVS_oYC&lpg=PA229&pg=PA229#v=onepage&q=&f=false|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, Volume 2|page=229|accessdate=9 October 2009[/tpl] This resulted in 1748 with the establishment of a post office in Galata outside of Istanbul, and eventually extended to 65 locationsMueller Handbook 1961, Austrian Post Offices in the Levant throughout the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean. The oldest known cancellation is a double linear "CONSTAN-TINOPEL" in  1787.Österreich 1850-1918, Spezialkatalog und Handbuch, von Dr. Ulrich FERCHENBAUER, Wien 1981 (in German), p.407
The latest remaining Austrian post offices in Turkey area were closed on 30 September 1914.Ferchenbauer 1981 p.408

==Stamp issues==

Beginning in 1863, stamps of Lombardy-Venetia were used: 2 to 15 soldi, which can be recognized only by the cancellation.
After the losses of Lombardy in 1859 and Venetia in 1866,Handbook of Austria and Lombardy-Venetia Cancellations on the Postage Stamp Issues 1850-1864, Edwin MUELLER, 1961 (in English and German) Austria issued in 1867 and 1883 specific stamps, in appearance identical to Austrian stamps of the same period, but valued in soldi (2 to 50 soldi). 
Details on Levant Austria post-offices using the 1867 issue are given in Part III Postämter in der Levante.Die Poststempel auf der Freimarken-Ausgabe 1867 von Österreich und Ungarn, Edwin Mueller, 1930 (in German)
In 1886 this was changed to paras and piasters to match the Turkish money already used by other countries,  by surcharging the existing stamps of the offices, with further issues between 1888 and 1907: values ranging from 10 paras to 20 piasters.Ferchenbauer, p.429-448
The Jubilee issue of 1908-1914 included directly values in paras and in piasters.

Some of the 1867-1883 soldi issues are rather common in unused state, contrary to the kreuzer equivalent. An extreme case is the 2 soldi yellow fine beard, lately issued in 1882: the ratio in value is 50002000 € for a truly used stamp, versus 0.4 € unused (Yvert Catalog 2005)!
