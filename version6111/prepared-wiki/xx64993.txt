[[Limited liability company]]

CATEGORIES: Corporate taxation in the United States, Types of business entity

A limited liability company (LLC) is a flexible form of enterprise that blends elements of partnership and corporate structures. An LLC is not a corporation; it is a legal form of company that provides limited liability to its owners in the vast majority of United States jurisdictions. LLCs do not need to be organized for profit.[tpl]cite web|last=Richard A. McCray|first=Ward L.

==Overview==

A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a hybrid business entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship (depending on how many owners there are). An LLC, although a business entity, is a type of unincorporated association and is not a corporation. The primary characteristic an LLC shares with a corporation is limited liability, and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of pass-through income taxation. It is often more flexible than a corporation, and it is well-suited for companies with a single owner.
LLC members are subject to the same alter ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders. However, it is more difficult to pierce the LLC veil because LLCs do not have many formalities to maintain. So long as the LLC and the members do not commingle funds, it would be difficult to pierce veil.[tpl]cite book|last=Stein|first=Jacob|authorlink=Jacob Stein|title=Asset Protection for California Residents|page=170|year=2011|isbn=0-9839780-2-6[/tpl] Membership interests in LLCs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism. The charging order limits the creditor of a debtor-partner or a debtor-member to the debtor's share of distributions, without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights.[tpl]cite web|title=Charging Order Protection|author=Stein, Jacob|url=http://www.maximumasetprotection.com/publications/whitepapers/Charging-Order-Protection-of-LLCs-and-LPs.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2012[/tpl] Limited liability company members may, in certain circumstances, also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the LLC insolvent.See Del. Limited Liability Company Act § 18-607(b)

==Flexibility and default rules==

The phrase "unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement" (or its equivalent) is found throughout all existing LLC statutes[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] and is responsible for the flexibility the members of the LLC have in deciding how their LLC will be governed (provided it does not go outside legal bounds). State statutes typically provide automatic or "default" rules for how an LLC will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise.
Similarly, the phrase "unless otherwise provided for in the by laws" is also found in all corporation law statutes[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] but often refers only to a narrower range of matters.
The limited liability company ("LLC") has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the entire United States.  All fifty states now allow for some form of the LLC business structure, after Wyoming passed enabling legislation in 1977.  As the LLC's popularity has swelled, unforeseen issues have emerged[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl].
Effective August 1, 2013, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members. Under the amendment (prompted by the Delaware Supreme Court's decision last November in Gatz Properties, LLC v. Auriga Capital Corp), parties to an LLC remain free to expand, restrict, or eliminate fiduciary duties in their LLC agreements (subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).http://www.dlapiper.com/global/publications/Detail.aspx?pub=8429&RSS=true

==Income tax==

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an LLC is treated by default as a pass-through entity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iss4.pdf |title=Instruction SS-4 (Rev. January 2011) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04[/tpl] If there is only one member in the company, the LLC is treated as a “disregarded entity” for tax purposes, and an individual owner would report the LLC's income or loss on Schedule C of his or her individual tax return. Thus, income from the LLC is taxed at the individual tax rates. The default tax status for LLCs with multiple members is as a partnership, which is required to report income and loss on IRS Form 1065. Under partnership tax treatment, each member of the LLC, as is the case for all partners of a partnership, annually receives a Form K-1 reporting the member's distributive share of the LLC's income or loss that is then reported on the member's individual income tax return. On the other hand, income from corporations is taxed twice, once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders, thus more tax savings often results if a business formed as an LLC rather than a corporation.Presti and Naegele FAQ: What are the pros and cons of limited liability companies (LLCs)?
An LLC with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of IRS Form 8832.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8832.pdf |title=Form 8832 (Rev. January 2011) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04[/tpl] After electing corporate tax status, an LLC may further elect to be treated as a regular C corporation (taxation of the entity's income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the dividends or distributions once received as income by the members) or as an S corporation (entity level income and loss passes through to the members). Some commentators have recommended an LLC taxed as an S-corporation as the best possible small business structure. It combines the simplicity and flexibility of an LLC with the tax benefits of an S-corporation (self-employment tax savings).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legalzoom.com/incorporation-guide/corporate-tax-advantage.html |title=Tax Advantages of Corporations - Incorporation Guide |publisher=LegalZoom |accessdate=2012-01-04[/tpl]

==Advantages==

==Disadvantages==

Although there is no statutory requirement for an operating agreement in most jurisdictions, members of a multiple member LLC who operate without one may run into problems. Unlike state laws regarding stock corporations, which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders, most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company. Thus, in the absence of such statutory provisions, the members of an LLC must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document.

==Variations==

==International equivalents==

Companies with limited liability exist in business law worldwide. However, the limited liability company is a specific legal structure defined by the laws of U.S. states, with quite distinct characteristics. Many other countries have similar structures.

===Argentina===

Although not an exact equivalent, the Argentine variant of the LLC is called Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (S.R.L.) and it limits the liability of its members up to their capital contribution in the company. The equity is divided into equal stakes (can not be called "shares"), each one of which represents a percentage of the company and that can not be traded on the stock exchange. Their by-laws are regulated by law N° 19550Ley de Sociedades Comerciales (Spanish) http://www.cnv.gov.ar/LeyesYReg/Leyes/19550.htm and the commercial partnership is limited to a maximum of 50 partners.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===

Bosnian and Herzegovinian legislation, similarly to that in Croatia, contemplates LLCs as društvo s ograničenom odgovornošću (d.o.o.). Companies using this structure append the abbreviation d.o.o. to their company name. A shareholder or member in a d.o.o. is only personally liable up to the value of the member’s investment in the company.of Companies in BiH http://fipa.gov.ba/local_v2/default.asp

===Brazil===

The corporate structure in Brazilian law most similar to the American LLC is the Sociedade Limitada (“Ltda.”), under the new Brazilian Civil Code of 2002. The sociedade limitada is the new name of the sociedade por quotas de responsabilidade limitada, and it can be organized as empresária or simples, under this new code, roughly corresponding to the form types of comercial (“commercial”) and civil (“non commercial”) of the Commercial Code. A new law in Brazil has made it legal to obtain an LLC by a sole-proprietor called Empresa Individual de Responsabilidade Limitada (Eireli for short). The main requirement is capital of 62.200,00 reais (US$35.250,00).

===Bulgaria===

Bulgarian legislation contemplates LLCs as Дружество с ограничена отговорност (Druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost; Partnership with limited liability). Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation ООД (OOD) to their name. In case of an LLC with individual owner it is contemplated as Еднолично дружество с ограничена отговорност (Ednolichno druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost; One-man/ Single-member partnership with limited liability) and abbreviated as ЕООД (EOOD).Commerce Law of Bulgaria, English translation, Chapter 13, Section I, Article 116

===Chile===

Chilean law contemplates a certain form of LLC known as "Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada" (Limited Liability Association). Also (LLC) These companies are regulated by law N° 3.918. Among their most important characteristics we can say that:

===Czech Republic===

Czech legislation contemplates LLCs as společnost s ručením omezeným (s.r.o. or spol. s r.o.).

The Danish form of the LLC is the anpartsselskab (see ApS). The minimum capital is required by law to be at least DKK 80,000 (approximately US$16,000) 1 March 2010, DKK 125,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&hl=en&js=n&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.themis.dk%2Fsynopsis%2Findex.asp%3Fhovedramme%3D%2Fsynopsis%2Fdocs%2Flovsamling%2Fanpartsselskabsloven.html&sl=da&tl=en&history_state0= |title=Synopsis – Article 1, Paragraph 2 |publisher=Translate.google.com |accessdate= 5 May 2012[/tpl]

===Germany===

Because of its hybrid characteristics it is very difficult to determine the German equivalent. On one hand it is possible to consider it as a kind of Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (GmbH) because it has aspects of a corporation; on the other hand it could be considered to be a kind of Kommanditgesellschaft (KG), which is the German equivalent of a limited partnership. Based on the literal translation of the word “company”, an LLC should be considered to be a kind of KG without any liable partner. For the purpose of taxation, the Bundesfinanzministerium (German Federal Ministry of Finance) gives detailed guidelines of the circumstances under which an LLC is to be considered to be a “corporation” or as a “limited partnership”.Steuerliche Einordnung der nach dem Recht der Bundesstaaten der USA gegründeten Limited Liability Company. It is useful to note, however, that the original LLC statutes of Wyoming and other US states were more or less explicitly modeled after the GmbH.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.llc-reporter.com/16.htm |title=Historical Background of the Limited Liability Company |publisher=Llc-reporter.com |accessdate=2012-01-04[/tpl]

===Hong Kong===

===Hungary===

Hungarian legislation contemplates LLCs as Korlátolt felelősségű társaság.

US$16,000) starting capital. This amount has been recently reduced and currently (in 2009) the minimum starting capital is 500k HUF (approx. 2.7k USD). The time of formation by the new electronic formation option has been reduced from 2 weeks to 2 hours, additional cost of formation is around 100k HUF (approx. 540 USD). Kft.s can be formed by the cooperation of lawyers.
The Hungarian Kft. is the most common form of doing business in Hungary.

===Spain===

In Spain, LLCs are called Sociedad de responsabilidad limitada (SRL), "company of limited responsibility", or sociedad limitada (SL), or "limited partnership". They are tax subject, and company shares cannot be sold in a public market, the transference of them having to be done compulsorily in the presence of a civil law notary, in the same way other major properties have to be sold. Nonetheless, the responsibility of the partners is limited to the capital share they hold, and the minimum capital required by law for a S.L. is at least €3,000.

===Sweden===

Sweden has no equivalent of an LLC. The closest company form is the handelsbolag (lit.: "trade company"). The Swedish AB (aktiebolag; lit.: "share company"), like the handelsbolag, is a tax subject and is more similar to a US C Corporation than an LLC. The minimum capital required by law in an aktiebolag is SEK 50,000, although this may be in the form of assets as well as capital. It should be noted that the AB structure requires shareholders, a Board of Directors, and regular meetings of both, together with complete audited accounts once per year. Creation or purchase "off-the-shelf" of an AB is relatively cheap and tax effective, but liquidation of a created aktiebolag can be an expensive and time-consuming operation.Swedish Companies Registration Office about Aktiebolag http://bolagsverket.se/foretag/aktiebolag/ Creation of public limited liability companies, or aktiebolag, quoted on the stock exchange, requires a minimum capitalization of SEK 1,000,000, however the overall regulation of public companies in Sweden, especially regarding accounting methods and taxes, is thorough and detailed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bolagsverket.se/foretag/aktiebolag/starta_aktiebolag/privat_eller_publikt/publika_aktiebolag/ |title=Publika aktiebolag - Bolagsverket |publisher=Bolagsverket.se |accessdate=2012-01-04[/tpl]

===Switzerland===

A Swiss corporation is with respect to various matters different from a LLC (including a Swiss LLC): Most important is that a Swiss corporation may, neither by default nor by exercising any respective option provided by the Swiss law, be member-managed like a LLC, as the respective mandatory provisions of Swiss law provide that the board of directors has certain non-transferable duties.Swiss Code of Obligations, article 716a Furthermore, the shares of a Swiss corporation may also be issued to the bearer (bearer shares)Swiss Code of Obligations, article 622 paragraph 1 and, thus, not only in the name of a holder (registered shares), which, however, applies to the membership interests in a Swiss LLC, which may only be registered.

===Tajikistan===

In Tajikistan same as in Russia, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as "Ҷамъияти дорои масъулияти маҳдуд", abbreviated as "ҶДММ".

The new form of limited liability partnership (LLP), created in 2000, is similar to a US LLC in being tax neutral: member partners are taxed at the partner level, but the LLP itself pays no tax. It is treated as a body corporate for all other purposes including VAT. Otherwise, all companies, including limited companies and US LLCs, are treated as bodies corporate subject to United Kingdom corporation tax if the profits of the entity belong to the entity and not to its members.

===United States===

A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a relatively new business structure authorized by state statute.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98277,00.html |title=Limited Liability Company (LLC) |publisher=Irs.gov |date=2011-06-21 |accessdate=2012-01-04[/tpl] The LLC is chiefly inspired by the GmbH ("Company with limited liability"), a type of business organization in Germany, and by the limitada, a type of business organization available in many Latin American countries.
In the United States, the first limited liability company act appeared in Wyoming in 1977 as special interest[tpl]Clarify|date=May 2009[/tpl] legislation for an oil company.Keatinge et al.,"The Limited Liability Company: A Study of the Emerging Entity," 47 Business Lawyer 375, 383-384 (Feb. 1992) (citing Act of 4 March 1977, ch. 155, 1977 Wyo.Sess.Laws 512). In 1980, the Internal Revenue Service issued a private letter ruling to an LLC formed under the Wyoming LLC Act, indicating that the IRS would treat the LLC as a partnership for federal tax purposes.Priv. Ltr. Rul. 81-06-082, 1980 WL 137231 (18 Nov. 1980) However, later that year, the IRS proposed regulations that would deny partnership classification to any business entity in which no member bore personal responsibility for the entity's liabilities.Prop. Treas. Reg. § 301.7701-2, 45 Fed. Reg. 75,709 (1980) In 1982, Florida adopted an LLC act modeled on Wyoming's LLC Act.Fla.Stat.Ann. §§ 608.401–471 Due to uncertainty over the tax treatment of LLCs, no other states introduced LLC legislation until after 1988.Keatinge et al., "The Limited Liability Company: A Study of the Emerging Entity," 47 Bus. Law. 375, 383-384 (Feb. 1992) In 1988, the IRS issued a revenue ruling stating that it would treat a Wyoming-style LLC as a partnership for tax purposes.Rev.Rul. 88-76, 1988-2 C.B. 360. By 1996, nearly every state had enacted an LLC statute.Larry E. Ribstein, A Critique of the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act, 25 Stetson Law Review 312, 322 (1995). The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act in 1996 and revised it in 2006.Limited Liability Company (Revised). Uniform Law Commission.
A potential disadvantage specific to the United States is that LLCs are not considered to be corporations for the purposes of federal civil procedure; they are instead treated as partnerships. This affects the applicability of diversity jurisdiction in cases involving LLCs, barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the LLC is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties. Should one member of an LLC be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen, any case between the LLC and those parties must be heard in that state's courts; corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in which the corporation is incorporated (most commonly Delaware for large corporations, which has a small population) or has its principal place of business.
AOL was set up as a LLC during its ownership by Time Warner from 2001 to 2008. There is a similar setup for BMW's American subsidiary, BMW of North America, LLC. Chrysler has been an LLC since restructuring during the auto industry bailout of 2009, with a majority stake held by Fiat S.p.A..
