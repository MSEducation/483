==History==

In 1996, after finishing the restoration work on a Cessna 195, brothers Rolim Adolfo Amaro and João Francisco Amaro decided to buy some classic aircraft, and keep them near São Paulo, in order to make them available for flights on weekends with friends. However, once purchased, it was realised that the small collection could become a museum representative of the memory of aviation and the world. The brothers then decided to create the "Museu Asas de um Sonho" (Wings of a Dream Museum), that is currently maintained by the Education Service and Culture, a non-profit association founded by TAM on 23 December 1991, to administer the social programs of the company.
In 2006, the museum opened with 32 aircraft, but in future will house more than 80 aircraft.  The opening will also be part of the celebrations of 150 years of the city of São Carlos.

===Rebuilding===

In July 2008 the museum was closed to visitors in order to allow a complete reorganization of its installations, which included an expansion of the covered space from 9.5 thousand square metres to over 20 thousand square metres. Te grand re-opening occurred in June 2010 and among many new features the collection of 90 airplanes now holds the sole surviving S.55 seaplane christened "Jahú", a F4U Corsair, a BF 109, a Dassault Mirage III, a Brazilian aircraft Neiva Regente among others.

==Aircraft exhibits==

The museum has 35 aircraft in a historical building measuring 450 metres long by 130 metres wide and 11 metres high. The exhibits planned to be accessible to visitors in 2010 are as follows:
