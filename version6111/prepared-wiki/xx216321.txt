The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) is an American trade association that represents the six major Hollywood studios. It was founded in 1922 as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) to advance the business interests of its members. In its formative years it took on the role of devising guidelines for film content which resulted in the creation of the Production Code, and currently administers the MPAA film rating system. 
More recently, the MPAA has advocated for the motion picture and television industry through lobbying to protect creative content from piracy and for the removal of trade barriers. The MPAA has long worked to curb copyright infringement, including recent attempts to limit the sharing of copyrighted works via peer-to-peer file-sharing networks.  Former Democratic Senator Chris Dodd is the Chairman and CEO.

===Foundation and early history: 1922 to 1929===

The Motion Picture Association of America was founded in 1922 as a trade association of movie companies and was originally named the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA). Former Postmaster General Will H. Hays was named the association's first president.[tpl]cite book |title=The Dame in the Kimono: Hollywood, Censorship, and the Production Code |last1=Leff |first1=Leonard J. |last2=Simmons |first2=Jerold L. |year=2001 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location= |isbn=0813190118 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=14 February 2013[/tpl] At its founding, the MPPDA represented approximately 70 to 80 percent of the films made in the United States.[tpl]cite news |title=Ultimatum by Hays to Purify Movies |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20910F83F5D1A7A93C7A9178DD85F468285F9 |work=The New York Times |date=5 June 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]
The main focus of the MPPDA in its early years was on producing a strong public relations campaign to ensure that Hollywood remained financially stable and able to attract investment from Wall Street, while simultaneously ensuring that American films had a "clean moral tone".[tpl]cite news |title=Hays Attacks Censors; Says Film Men O.K. |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EhdLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IiENAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=2733%2C7216162 |work=The Evening News |date=26 May 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl] The MPPDA also instituted a code of conduct for actors in Hollywood films governing their behavior offscreen, and sought to protect American film interests abroad by encouraging film studios to avoid racist portrayals of foreigners.[tpl]cite news |title=Czar of Movies Hits Censorship |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Np5XAAAAIBAJ&sjid=t_MDAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=5826%2C734859 |work=The Spokesman-Review |date=25 January 1924 |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]
From the early days of the association, Hays spoke out against public censorship,[tpl]cite news |title=Hays Says Public Censors Will Fail |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0610FD395D1A7A93C7AB178CD85F468285F9 |work=The New York Times |date=25 July 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl] and the MPPDA worked to raise support from the general public for the film industry's efforts against such censorship.[tpl]cite news |title=Will Hays, Pledging Motion Picture Industry to Clean Pictures, Asks Public to Aid War on Evil Films |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFBbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QVANAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=4100%2C1398046 |work=Providence News |date=6 July 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl] At the time of the MPPDA's founding, regional censorship boards in the US often edited Hollywood films to comply with local laws regarding the onscreen portrayal of violence and sexuality. This resulted in negative publicity for the studios, and low numbers of theater goers, who were uninterested in films that were sometimes so severely edited that they were incoherent.
In 1924, Hays instituted "The Formula", a loose set of guidelines for filmmakers, in an effort to have the movie industry self-regulate the issues that the censorship boards had been created to address. "The Formula" requested that studios send synopses of films being considered for production to Hays for review. This effort largely failed, however, as studios were under no obligation to send their scripts to Hays's office, nor to follow his recommendations.[tpl]cite book |author=Gregory D. Black |title=Hollywood Censored: Morality Codes, Catholics, and the Movies |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521565928 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ybKqnNNR7hwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Hollywood+Censored:+Morality+Codes,+Catholics,+and+the+Movies&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hIweUZuEJsHe0QG6zoHgBg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA |accessdate=15 February 2013[/tpl]
In 1927, Hays oversaw the creation of a code of "Don'ts and Be Carefuls" for the industry. This list outlined potential issues that movies might encounter in different localities. The MPPDA also made the SRD available to the movie studios to review scripts and advise them about any problems. Again, despite Hays's efforts, studios largely ignored the "Don'ts and Be Carefuls", and by the end of 1929, the MPPDA received only about 20% of Hollywood scripts prior to production. Further, the number of censorship boards continued to increase, and by 1929 more than 50% of American moviegoers lived in a location overseen by such a board.

===The Production Code: 1930-1934===

In 1930, the MPPDA introduced the Production Code, sometimes called the Hays Code. The Code consisted of moral guidelines regarding what was acceptable to include in films.[tpl]cite news |title=Movie Industry to Bar Obscenity and Crime Scenes, Plan |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-K9FAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Pb0MAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=3907%2C1202519 |work=The Telegraph-Herald and Times-Journal |date=2 April 1930 |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl] Unlike the "Dont's and Be Carefuls", which the studios had ignored, the Production Code was endorsed by studio executives. The Code incorporated many of the "Don'ts and Be Carefuls" as specific examples of what could not be portrayed. Among other rules, the code prohibited inclusion of "scenes of passion" unless they were essential to a film's plot, "pointed profanity" in either word or action, "sex perversion", justification or explicit coverage of adultery, sympathetic treatment of crime or criminals, dancing with "indecent" moves, and white slavery.[tpl]cite news |title=Producers Adopt Code of Conduct For Screen Shows |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WyRkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WHsNAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=3606%2C4315324 |work=The Calgary Daily Herald |date=1 April 1930 |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl] Because studio executives had been involved in the decision to adopt the code, MPPDA-member studios were more willing to submit scripts for consideration. However, the growing economic impacts of the Great Depression of the early 1930s increased pressure on studios to make films that would draw the largest possible audiences, even if it meant taking their chances with local censorship boards by disobeying the Code.
In 1933 and 1934, the Catholic Legion of Decency, along with a number of Protestant and women's groups, launched plans to boycott films that they deemed immoral.[tpl]cite book |author=Matthew Bernstein |title=Controlling Hollywood: Censorship and Regulation in the Studio Era |year=2000 |isbn=0813527074 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dEYoT857G8UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Controlling+Hollywood:+Censorship+and+Regulation+in+the+Studio+Era&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eIseUamHDaa00AHX1oH4Bg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA |accessdate=15 February 2013[/tpl] In order to avert boycotts which might further harm the profitability of the film industry, the MPPDA created a new department, the Production Code Administration (PCA), with Joseph Breen as its head. Unlike previous attempts at self-censorship, PCA decisions were binding—no film could be exhibited in an American theater without a stamp of approval from the PCA, and any producer attempting to do so faced a fine of $25,000.

===The war years: 1935-1945===

In the years that immediately followed the adoption of the Code, Breen often sent films back to Hollywood for additional edits, and in some cases, simply refused to issue PCA approval for a film to be shown.[tpl]cite news |title=Pictures Purged |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-Z5fAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wzEMAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=3861%2C4395343 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |date=15 July 1934 |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl] At the same time, Hays promoted the industry's new focus on wholesome films[tpl]cite news |title=Newest Pictures Based on Classics |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=atRXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_fQDAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=2505%2C6402892 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |date=26 March 1935 |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl] and continued promoting American films abroad.[tpl]cite news |title=Will Hays Gets Italy to Lift Film Blockage |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PHYxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_yEEAAAAIBAJ&dq=will-hays&pg=6885%2C5924504 |work=The Milwaukee Journal |date=25 November 1936 |accessdate=19 February 2013[/tpl]
For nearly three years, studios complied with the Code. By 1938, however, as the threat of war in Europe loomed, movie producers began to worry about the possibility of decreased profits abroad. This led to a decreased investment in following the strictures of the code, and occasional refusals to comply with PCA demands. That same year, responding to trends in European films in the run-up to the war, Hays spoke out against using movies as a vehicle for propaganda.[tpl]cite news |title=Hays Scores Propaganda On Screens |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LE0bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=D0wEAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=4508%2C6029095 |work=The Pittsburgh Press |date=30 March 1938 |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]
In 1945, after 24 years as president, Hays stepped down from his position at the MPPDA, although he continued to act as an advisor for the Association for the next five years.[tpl]cite news |title=Eric Johnston to Rule Movies |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vipWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=o-QDAAAAIBAJ&dq=will-hays%20and%20johnston&pg=6105%2C4697631 |work=The Spokesman-Review |date=20 September 1945 |accessdate=19 February 2013[/tpl]

===The Johnston era: 1945-1963===

In 1945, the MPPDA hired Eric Johnston, four-time president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, to replace Will Hays.[tpl]cite news |title=Johnston Named Motion Picture Czar |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7NZYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jvUDAAAAIBAJ&dq=will-hays%20and%20johnston&pg=6668%2C3421898 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |date=19 September 1945 |accessdate=19 February 2013[/tpl] During his first year as president, Johnston rebranded the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America as the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).
He also created the Motion Picture Export Association (MPEA) to promote American films abroad by opposing production company monopolies in other countries.[tpl]cite book |author=Jon Lewis |title=Hollywood V.

In 1956, Johnston oversaw the first revision of the Production Code since its implementation in 1930. This revision allowed the treatment of some subjects which had previously been forbidden, including abortion and the use of narcotics, so long as they were "within the limits of good taste". At the same time, the revisions added a number of new restrictions to the code, including outlawing the depiction of blasphemy and mercy killings in films.[tpl]cite news |title=Motion Picture Code Made 'More Flexible' |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JRFWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cOIDAAAAIBAJ&dq=mpaa%20johnston&pg=6763%2C3434436 |work=Eugene Register Guard |date=17 December 1956 |accessdate=12 April 2013[/tpl]

===The Valenti era: 1966-2004===

==Anti-File Sharing efforts==

The MPAA's concerted efforts at fighting content sharing began in 1975 with the establishment of the Film Security Office, which sought to recover unauthorized recordings of films in order to prevent duplication. The MPAA has continued to pursue a number of initiatives to combat illegal distribution of Hollywood films, especially in response to new technologies. In the 1980s, it spoke out against VCRs and the threat that the MPAA believed they represented to the movie industry,[tpl]cite news |title=Putting the Bite On the Home VCR |author=William D.

Legal efforts at stopping homemade copies of broadcast television largely ended, however, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that such copying constituted fair use.[tpl]cite news |title='Distortion' Charged; DAT Anticopy Technology Debated At Joint Hill Hearing |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=3TVV-HHR0-0019-30PX&csi=6944&oc=00240&perma=true |work=Communications Daily |date=3 April 1987 |accessdate=6 March 2013[/tpl] The MPAA continued to support law enforcement efforts to stop bootleg production and distribution of videos tapes and laserdiscs into the 1990s,[tpl]cite news |title=Picture This |author=Seth Goldstein |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TAgEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=RA1-PA53&dq=MPAA%20laserdiscs&pg=RA1-PA53#v=onepage&q&f=false |work=Billboard |date=21 May 1994 |accessdate=19 March 2013[/tpl] and in 2000 took legal action against individuals posting DVD decryption software on the Internet.[tpl]cite news |title=Content de-scrambling fought |author=Sam Costella |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=414V-TG80-00J5-J3D9&csi=169977&oc=00240&perma=true |work=InfoWorld Daily News |date=6 September 2000 |accessdate=8 March 2013[/tpl] Following the release of RealDVD—an application that enabled users to make copies of DVDs—RealNetworks sued the DVD Copy Control Association and the major studios in 2008 over the legality of the software; RealNetworks accused the MPAA of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act,[tpl]cite news |title=RealNetworks accuses MPAA of antitrust violations |author=Greg Sandoval |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10240490-93.html |work=CNET |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2013[/tpl] but the judgment found that were no grounds for the claim and dismissed the suit.[tpl]cite news |title=Judge Slams MPAA ‘Cartel’ Allegations |author=David Kravets |url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/judge-slams-mpaa-cartel-allegations/ |work=Wired |date=11 January 2010 |accessdate=28 May 2013[/tpl] As of 2013, the MPAA has also continued to support law enforcement efforts to prevent illegal distribution of copyrighted materials online.[tpl]cite news |title=MPAA Cheers Prison Sentence For Leader Of Internet Piracy Ring |author=David Lieberman |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/01/mpaa-imagine-group-justice-department-conviction-sentencing/ |work=Deadline.com |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2013[/tpl] The MPAA and its British counterpart, the Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT), also funded the training of Lucky and Flo, a pair of Labrador Retrievers, to detect polycarbonates used in the manufacturing of DVDs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125679/article.html |title=MPAA Trains Dogs to Sniff Out Pirate DVDs |author=Jeremy Kirk |date=11 May 2006 |work=PCWorld |accessdate=5 March 2013[/tpl]

===Online file sharing===

In the early 2000s, the MPAA began to focus its anti-file sharing efforts on peer-to-peer file sharing, initially using a combination of educational campaigns[tpl]cite news |title=Music piracy persists at Boston U., nationwide despite lawsuits |author=Dan Atkinson |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4B6F-HJW0-00K4-105J&csi=172244&oc=00240&perma=true |work=University Wire |date=10 December 2003 |accessdate=8 March 2013[/tpl] and cease and desist letters to discourage such activity. In the first six months of 2002, the MPAA sent more than 18,000 such letters to internet service providers that hosted copyright-infringing content.[tpl]cite news |title=Shiver me timbers: Online bootlegs bane of entertainment industry |author=Simon Woolley |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4600-8XW0-015H-052Y&csi=244819&oc=00240&perma=true |work=Townsville Bulletin/Townsville Sun |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=8 March 2013[/tpl]
In late 2004, however, the MPAA changed course and filed lawsuits in a concerted effort to address copyright infringement on a number of large online file-sharing services, including BitTorrent and eDonkey.[tpl]cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2004/12/4467-2/ |title=MPAA lawsuits target BitTorrent, eDonkey and Direct Connect networks |author=Fred Locklear |date=14 December 2004 |work=Ars Technica |accessdate=5 March 2013[/tpl] The following year, the MPAA expanded its legal actions to include lawsuits against individuals who downloaded and distributed copyrighted material via peer-to-peer networks.[tpl]cite news |title=MPAA Anti-Piracy Lawsuits Target Individuals |author=Bary Alyssa Johnson |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4H0K-M4X0-01KX-14V2&csi=262320&oc=00240&perma=true |work=PC Magazine |date=29 August 2005 |accessdate=6 March 2013[/tpl]
The MPAA also played a role in encouraging the Swedish government to conduct a raid of the Pirate Bay file-sharing website in May 2006.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.slyck.com/story1227.html |title=Sweden Pressured to take Pirate Bay Action |author=Thomas Mennecke |date=20 June 2006 |work=Slyck.com |accessdate=5 March 2013[/tpl] Swedish officials have acknowledged that part of the motivation for the raid was the threat of sanctions from the World Trade Organization, along with a letter from the MPAA.[tpl]cite news |title=U.S. Joins Industry in Piracy War |author=Frank Ahrens |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/14/AR2006061402071.html |work=The Washington Post |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=6 March 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/4128/20060621/#.UTdo1nyY4RE |title=US threatened Sweden with sanctions over piracy |author=Adam Ewing |date=21 June 2006 |work=The Local |accessdate=6 March 2013[/tpl]
In 2013, the Center for Copyright Information unveiled the Copyright Alert System, a system established through an agreement between the MPAA, the Recording Industry Association of America, and five of the nation’s largest internet service providers.[tpl]cite news |title=MPAA-Backed Copyright Alert System Unveiled |author=Sean J.

Subscribers facing such action have a right to appeal to the American Arbitration Association.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/resources-faq/copyright-alert-system-faqs/ |title=Copyright Alert System FAQs |work=copyrightinformation.org |publisher=Center for Copyright Information |accessdate=25 April 2013[/tpl]

===Publicity campaigns===

The MPAA has also produced publicity campaigns to discourage piracy. The Who Makes Movies? advertising campaign in 2003 highlighted workers in the movie industry describing how piracy affected them. The video spots ran as trailers before movies, and as television advertisements.[tpl]cite news |title=H'wood steps up antipiracy fight |author=Brooks Boliek |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4BG8-SXP0-01V4-X35T&csi=12015&oc=00240&perma=true |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=23 July 2003 |accessdate=5 March 2013[/tpl] In 2004, the MPAA began using the slogan "You can click, but you can't hide". This slogan appeared in messages that replaced file-sharing websites after they had been shut down through MPAA legal action.[tpl]cite news |title=Movie body hits peer-to-peer nets |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4256449.stm |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2013[/tpl] It also appeared in posters and videos distributed to video stores by the MPAA.[tpl]cite news |title=MPAA Files Piracy Suits |author=Greg Hernandez |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4DTP-V1K0-TWDH-T3C9&csi=157105&oc=00240&perma=true |work=The Daily News of Los Angeles |date=17 November 2004 |accessdate=5 March 2013[/tpl] Also in 2004, the MPAA partnered with the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore to release a trailer shown before films in theaters called You Wouldn't Steal a Car.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040804074635/http://www.ipos.gov.sg/main/newsroom/media_rel/mediarelease1_270704.html |title=Be HIP at the Movies |author= |date=27 July 2004 |work=Intellectual Property Office of Singapore |accessdate=6 March 2013[/tpl] The trailer was later placed at the beginning of many DVDs in way that could not be bypassed, which triggered criticism and a number of parodies.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8106805.stm |title=Getting inside a downloader's head |author=Finlo Rohrer |date=18 June 2009 |work=BBC |accessdate=6 March 2013[/tpl]
In 2005, the MPAA commissioned a study to examine the effects of file sharing on movie industry profitability. The study concluded that the industry lost $6.1 billion per year to piracy, and that up to 44% of domestic losses were due to file sharing by college students. In 2008, the MPAA revised the percentage of loss due to college students down to 15%, citing human error in the initial calculations of this figure. Beyond the percentage of the loss that was attributable to college students, however, no other errors were found in the study.[tpl]cite news |title=MPAA admits mistake on downloading study |author=Justin Pope |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080207045516/http://www.newsweek.com/id/98009/page/1 |work=Newsweek |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=5 March 2013[/tpl]

==Accusations of copyright infringements against the MPAA==

The MPAA itself has been accused of copyright infringement. In 2007, the creator of a blogging platform called Forest Blog accused the MPAA of violating the license for the platform, which required that users link back to the Forest Blog website. The MPAA had used the platform for its own blog, but without linking back to the Forest Blog website. The MPAA subsequently took the blog offline.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2007/02/19/MPAA_violates_software_license/ |title=MPAA violates software license |author=Brett Thomas |date=19 February 2007 |work=bit-tech.net |accessdate=5 March 2013[/tpl] Also in 2007, the MPAA released a software toolkit for universities to help identify cases of file sharing on campus. The software used parts of the Ubuntu Linux distribution, released under the General Public License, which stipulates that the source code of any projects using the distribution be made available to third parties. The source code for the MPAA's toolkit, however, was not made available. When the MPAA was made aware of the violation, the software toolkit was removed from their website.[tpl]cite news |title=MPAA's University Toolkit hit with DMCA takedown notice after GPL violation |author=Ryan Paul |url=http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2007/12/mpaas-university-toolkit-hit-with-dmca-takedown-notice-after-gpl-violation/ |work=Ars Technica |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=5 March 2013[/tpl]
