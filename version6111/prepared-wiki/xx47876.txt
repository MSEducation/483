[[Ascension Frigatebird]]

CATEGORIES: Fregata, Fauna of Ascension Island, Animals described in 1758

The Ascension Frigatebird (Fregata aquila) breeds on the rocky slopes of the tiny Boatswain Bird Island just off Ascension Island in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It formerly bred on the larger island, but was exterminated by introduced cats, Brown Rats, and human persecution; in 2012 it was announced that a breeding pair had been found on Ascension Island following a project to exterminate feral cats.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/dec/08/frigatebird-returns-to-ascension |last=McKie |first=Robin |title=Frigatebird returns to nest on Ascension for first time since Darwin |newspaper=The Observer |date=8 December 2012 |accessdate=10 December 2012 [/tpl]
As with other frigatebirds, its movements outside the breeding season are little known because of identification problems within this difficult group, but it occurs off west Africa. It feeds on fish and similar surface prey such as small turtles.
This species is very similar to the other frigatebirds and is similarly sized to all but Lesser Frigatebird. It has a white axillary spur, and juveniles show a white head, and a distinctly white hind neck with no reddish-brown hue. It has a brown breast band.
A frigatebird found moribund in 1953 in Tiree, Scotland was identified at the time as Magnificent Frigatebird but the specimen was re-examined in 2002 and found to be an Ascension Frigatebird.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Wallbridge |first1=Grahame |last2=Small |first2=Brian |last3=McGowan |first3=Robert Y |year=2003 |title=From the Rarities Committee’s files: Ascension Frigatebird  on Tiree – new to the Western Palearctic  |journal=British Birds |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=58–73[/tpl] A juvenile was photographed at Bowmore on the island of Islay in July 2013.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-23202393 |title=Rare Ascension frigatebird recorded on Islay |publisher=BBC Highlands & Islands |date=7 July 2013 |accessdate=11 July 2013[/tpl]
