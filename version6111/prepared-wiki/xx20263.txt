==Mission statement==

On the contents page of each newsmagazine, The Economist[tpl]'[/tpl]s mission statement is written in italics.  It states that The Economist was 'First published in September 1843 to take part in "a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress".'

==History==

The Economist was founded by the British businessman and banker James Wilson in 1843, to advance the repeal of the Corn Laws, a system of import tariffs.From the Corn Laws to Your Mailbox, The MIT Press Log, 30 January 2007. Retrieved 11 June 2010. A prospectus for the "newspaper," from 5 August 1843 enumerated thirteen areas of coverage that its editors wanted the newspaper to focus on:[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1873493|title=Prospectus|accessdate=27 December 2006|work=The Economist|date=5 August 1843[/tpl]

==Opinions==

When the newsmagazine was founded, the term "economism" denoted what would today be termed "economic liberalism". The Economist generally supports free trade, globalisation,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17732859|title=Globalisation: The redistribution of hope|date=16 December 2010|work=The Economist|accessdate=23 April 2011[/tpl] and free immigration. It has been described as neo-liberal although occasionally accepting the propositions of Keynesian economics where deemed more "reasonable".[tpl]cite news|author=George Monbiot|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/jan/11/economy.g8|title=George Monbiot, Punitive – and it works|work=The Guardian|date=11 January 2005|accessdate=25 May 2012|location=London[/tpl] The news magazine favours a carbon tax to fight global warming.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11543656|title=Buttonwood: Let them heat coke|work=The Economist|date=14 June 2008|accessdate=25 May 2012[/tpl] According to former editor Bill Emmott, "the Economist's philosophy has always been liberal, not conservative".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,408484,00.html|title=Time for a referendum on the monarchy|accessdate=27 December 2006|work=Comment| date=8 December 2000| first=Bill|last=Emmot| location=London[/tpl] Individual contributors take diverse views. The Economist favours the support, via central banks, of banks and other important corporations. This principle can (in a much more limited form) be traced back to Walter Bagehot, the third editor of The Economist, who argued that the Bank of England should support major banks that got into difficulties.  Karl Marx deemed The Economist the "European organ" of "the aristocracy of finance".[tpl]cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte|year=1852|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch06.htm[/tpl]
The paper has also supported liberal causes on social issues such as recognition of gay marriages,Let them wed, cover article on 4 January 1996 legalisation of drugs,How to stop the drug wars, cover article on 7 March 2009.  The newspaper calls legalisation "the least bad solution". criticizes the U.S. tax model in a recent issue,[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21545981|title=Tax reform in America: A simple bare necessity|work=The Economist|date=|accessdate=25 May 2012[/tpl]  and seems to support some government regulation on health issues, such as smoking in public,[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16333351|title=Smoking and public health: Breathe easy|work=The Economist|date=10 June 2010|accessdate=25 May 2012[/tpl]  as well as bans on spanking children.Spare The Rod, Say Some, The Economist, 31 May 2008  The Economist consistently favours guest worker programs, parental choice of school, and amnestiesSense, not Sensenbrenner, The Economist, 30 March 2006 and once published an "obituary" of God.[tpl]Cite news|title=Obituary: God|work=The Economist|date=23 December 1999|url=http://www.economist.com/diversions/millennium/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=347578[/tpl] The Economist also has a long record of supporting gun control.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13447986|title=Lexington: Reflections on Virginia Tech|date=8 April 2009|work=The Economist|accessdate=13 April 2011[/tpl]
The Economist has endorsed both the Labour Party (in 2005) and the Conservative Party (in 2010)"The Economist backs the Conservatives", The Guardian (PA report), 29 April 2010 at general election time in Britain, and both Republican and Democratic candidates in the United States. Economist.com puts its stance this way:
[tpl]quotation|What, besides free trade and free markets, does The Economist believe in? "It is to the Radicals that The Economist still likes to think of itself as belonging. The extreme centre is the paper's historical position". That is as true today as when former Economist editor Geoffrey Crowther said it in 1955. The Economist considers itself the enemy of privilege, pomposity and predictability. It has backed conservatives such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. In foreign affairs it once, under Emmott's editorship declared itself openly "Americanophile", and it long supported the Americans in Vietnam, as it supported the later wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But in their time it also endorsed Harold Wilson and Bill Clinton, and it has long espoused a variety of liberal causes: opposing capital punishment from its earliest days, while favouring penal reform and decolonisation, as well as—more recently—gun control and gay marriage.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/help/about-us#About_The_Economist|title=About us|accessdate=1 May 2011|work=The Economist|date=18 November 2010[/tpl][/tpl]
The Economist frequently accuses figures and countries of corruption or dishonesty. In recent years, for example, it criticised former World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz; Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's Prime Minister (who dubbed it The Ecommunist);[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2005/09/324682.html|title=Report of Rome anti-war demo on Saturday 24th with photos|accessdate=27 December 2006|work=Independent Media Center [/tpl] Laurent-Désiré Kabila, the late president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Robert Mugabe, the head of government in Zimbabwe; and, recently, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the president of Argentina.[tpl]Cite news|title=Cristina in the land of make believe|work=The Economist|date=1 May 2008|url=http://www.economist.com/world/la/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11293743[/tpl] The Economist also called for Bill Clinton's impeachment and, after the emergence of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2647493|title=Resign Rumsfeld|accessdate=27 December 2006|work=The Economist|date=6 May 2004[/tpl] for Donald Rumsfeld's resignation. Though The Economist initially gave vigorous support for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, it later called the operation "bungled from the start" and criticised the "almost criminal negligence" of the Bush Administration's handling of the war, while maintaining, [tpl]as of|lc=y|2008|04[/tpl], that pulling out in the short term would be irresponsible.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RRRTGGP|title=Mugged by reality|accessdate=9 April 2007|work=The Economist|date=22 March 2007[/tpl] In the 2004 U.S. election, the editors "reluctantly" backed John Kerry.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_QTVPPQ|title=Crunch time in America|accessdate=27 December 2006|work=The Economist|date=2 November 2000[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3329802|title=The incompetent or the incoherent?|accessdate=27 December 2006|work=The Economist|date=28 October 2004[/tpl] In the 2008 U.S. election the newsmagazine endorsed Barack Obama, while using the election eve issue's front cover to promote his candidacy.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?source=most_commented&story_id=12511171| work=The Economist| title=It's time|date=30 October 2008[/tpl]  In the 2012 U.S. election, Barack Obama was again endorsed: the editorial said that they preferred Obama on the economy, foreign policy and health care, but criticised him for running a negative campaign against Romney and for a "poor appreciation of commerce".[tpl]cite news |title=Our American Endorsement.

==Tone and voice==

Though it has many individual columns, by tradition and current practice the magazine ensures a uniform voice—aided by the anonymity of writers—throughout its pages,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/styleguide/introduction|title=Style Guide | accessdate=8 February 2013|work=The Economist|date=27 September 2011[/tpl] as if most articles were written by a single author, which may be perceived to display dry, understated wit, and precise use of language.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/index.cfm?page=673927|title=The Economist — Tone|accessdate=27 December 2006|work=The Economist  [/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/research/johnson/|title=Johnson|accessdate=27 December 2006|work=The Economist|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
The paper's treatment of economics presumes a working familiarity with fundamental concepts of classical economics. For instance, it does not explain terms like invisible hand, macroeconomics, or demand curve, and may take just six or seven words to explain the theory of comparative advantage. Articles involving economics do not presume any formal training on the part of the reader and aim to be accessible to the educated layman. The newsmagazine usually does not translate short French (and German) quotes or phrases. It does describe the business or nature of even well-known entities, writing, for example, "Goldman Sachs, an investment bank".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.economist.co.uk/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10740475&CFID=1952750&CFTOKEN=20002991|title=A bank by any other name|accessdate=16 September 2008|work=The Economist  [/tpl]
Many articles include some witticism; image captions are often humorous puns and the letters section usually concludes with an odd or light-hearted letter. These efforts at humour have sometimes had a mixed reception. For example, the cover of 20 September 2003 issue, headlined by a story on the WTO ministerial meeting in Cancún, featured a cactus giving the middle finger.Issue Cover for 20 Sep 2003, economist.com Readers sent both positive and negative letters in response.Letters: Pointing the Finger, The Economist, 2 October 2003

===Editorial anonymity===

Articles often take a definite editorial stance and almost never carry a byline. Not even the name of the editor (since 2006, John Micklethwait) is printed in the issue. It is a long-standing tradition that an editor's only signed article during his tenure is written on the occasion of his departure from the position. The author of a piece is named in certain circumstances: when notable persons are invited to contribute opinion pieces; when journalists of The Economist compile special reports (previously known as surveys); for the Year in Review special edition; and to highlight a potential conflict of interest over a book review. The names of The Economist editors and correspondents can be located on the media directory pages of the website.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/mediadirectory|title=Media directory|publisher=The Economist|date=|accessdate=25 May 2012[/tpl] Online blog pieces are signed with the initials of the writer and authors of print stories are allowed to note their authorship from their personal web sites.[tpl]cite web|url=http://andreaskluth.org/2008/11/20/why-the-economist-has-no-bylines/|title=Why The Economist has no bylines | Hannibal and Me|publisher=Andreaskluth.org|accessdate=25 May 2012[/tpl]
The editors say this is necessary because "collective voice and personality matter more than the identities of individual journalists"[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.economist.com/help/about-us|title=The Economist — About us|accessdate=11 June 2012|work=The Economist|date=18 November 2010[/tpl] and reflects "a collaborative effort".[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.minnpost.com/stories/2008/04/29/1659/economist_editor_micklethwait_brings_his_global_perspective_to_the_twin_cities |title=Economist Editor Micklethwait brings his global perspective to the Twin Cities|accessdate=16 September 2008|date=29 April 2008|publisher=MinnPost.com[/tpl] In most articles authors refer to themselves as "your correspondent" or "this reviewer". The writers of the titled opinion columns tend to refer to themselves by the title (hence, a sentence in the "Lexington" column might read "Lexington was informed...").
American author Michael Lewis has criticized the magazine's editorial anonymity, labeling it a means to hide the youth and inexperience of those writing articles. "The magazine is written by young people pretending to be old people...If American readers got a look at the pimply complexions of their economic gurus, they would cancel their subscriptions in droves" quipped Lewis in 1991.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/1991/10/-quot-the-economics-of-the-colonial-cringe-quot-about-the-economist-magazine-washington-post-1991/7415/|title=The Economics of the Colonial Cringe: Pseudonomics and the Sneer on the Face of The Economist.|accessdate=27 April 2008|work=Washington Post[/tpl]
John Ralston Saul describes The Economist as a "magazine which hides the names of the journalists who write its articles in order to create the illusion that they dispense disinterested truth rather than opinion. This sales technique, reminiscent of pre-Reformation Catholicism, is not surprising in a publication named after the social science most given to wild guesses and imaginary facts presented in the guise of inevitability and exactitude. That it is the Bible of the corporate executive indicates to what extent received wisdom is the daily bread of a managerial civilization".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Doubters-Companion-Dictionary-Aggressive/dp/0743236602/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1371497990&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Doubter%27s+Companion%3A+A+Dictionary+of+Aggressive+Common+Sense |title=The Doubter's Companion: A Dictionary of Aggressive Common Sense |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl]

==Circulation==

Each of The Economist' issue's official date range is from Saturday to the following Friday. In the UK print copies are dispatched late Thursday, for Friday delivery to retail outlets and subscribers. Elsewhere, retail outlets and subscribers receive their copies on Friday or Saturday, depending on their location. The Economist posts each week's new content online at approximately 2100 Thursday evening UK time, ahead of the official publication date.
In 1877, the newspaper's circulation was 3,700. In 1920, it had risen to 6,000. Circulation increased rapidly after 1945, reaching 100,000 by 1970.
Circulation is audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC). From around 30,000 in 1960 it has risen to near 1 million by 2000 and by 2012 to about 1.5 million .[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] Sales inside North America were in 2007 around 54 percent of the total, with sales in the UK making up 14 percent of the total and continental Europe 19 percent. The Economist claims sales, both by subscription and at newsagents, in over 200 countries. Of its American readers, two out of three make more than $100,000 a year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5250996|title='Economist' Magazine Wins American Readers|date=8 March 2006|accessdate=27 December 2006|work=NPR [/tpl]
The Economist once boasted about its limited circulation. In the early 1990s it used the slogan "The Economist – not read by millions of people". "Never in the history of journalism has so much been read for so long by so few," wrote Geoffrey Crowther, a former editor.
The Economist Newspaper Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Economist Group. The publications of the group include the CFO brand family as well as the annual The World in..., the lifestyle bi-monthly Intelligent Life, European Voice, and Roll Call. Sir Evelyn Robert de Rothschild was Chairman of the company from 1972 to 1989.

==Letters==

The Economist frequently receives letters from senior businesspeople, politicians and spokespeople for government departments, non-governmental organisations and lobbies, but well written or witty responses from anyone are considered, and controversial issues frequently produce a torrent of letters. For example, the survey of corporate social responsibility, published January 2005, produced largely critical letters from Oxfam, the World Food Programme, United Nations Global Compact, the Chairman of BT Group, an ex-Director of Shell and the UK Institute of Directors.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.business-humanrights.org/Links/Repository/542754 |title= Compilation: Full text of responses to Economist survey on Corporate Social Responsibility (January–February 2005)|accessdate=3 February 2007|work=Business & Human Rights[/tpl]
Many of the letters published are critical of its stance or commentary. After The Economist ran a critique of Amnesty International and human rights in general in its issue dated 24 March 2007, its letters page ran a vibrant reply from Amnesty, as well as several other letters in support of the organisation, including one from the head of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8954694|title=Letters: On Amnesty International and human rights, Iraq, tax breaks 4 April 2007|accessdate=9 November 2007|work=The Economist|date=4 April 2007[/tpl] Rebuttals from officials within regimes such as the Singapore government are routinely printed, to comply with local right-of-reply laws without compromising editorial independence.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=CnZjYJ3TduUC&pg=PA173&lpg=PA173&dq=%22the+economist%22+singapore+%22letters+page&source=web&ots=f5J8dzz-rF&sig=WZlbfq5s7RHAa0IbThT7VaEg9lE&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result|title=The Media Enthralled: Singapore Revisited|author=Francis T.

Letters published in the newsmagazine are typically between 150 and 200 words long (and begin with the ritual salutation "Sir"). Previous to a change in procedure, all responses to on-line articles were usually published in "The Inbox".[tpl]cite news|author=Stay informed today and every day |url=http://www.economist.com/debate/theinbox/ |title=Latest blog posts |publisher=The Economist |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl] Comments can now be made directly under each article.

The Economist also produces the annual The World in Year publication. It also sponsors a writing award.

==Advertising==

In the late eighties, the Economist hired AMV BBDO, one of London's large advertising agencies. AMV was charged with broadening the newsmagazine's appeal beyond financial industry workers. To do this, AMV phased out advertisements based on the Economist's contents, and introduced feel-good advertising. These new ads made the Economist's advertisers feel that they were targeting a high-end market, made readers feel part of a special club, and made potential readers feel that they were missing out. Today, the 'White out of Red' advertising campaign is legendary. Almost every ad consists of a witticism written in white on a plain red background, usually with 'The Economist' in the bottom right-hand corner. For example: "I never read The Economist", Management trainee, Aged 42.

==Innovation Awards==

The Economist sponsors the yearly "The Economist Innovation Awards", in the categories of bioscience, computing and communications, energy and the environment, social and economic innovation, business-process innovation, consumer products and a special "no boundaries" category.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.economistconferences.co.uk/innovation/categories|title=Economist Innovation Awards Categories|publisher=The Economist Group|date=|accessdate=25 May 2012[/tpl] The awards have been held since 2002.

==Writing Prize==

In 1999 The Economist organized a global futurist writing competition, The World in 2050. Co-sponsored by Royal Dutch/Shell, the competition included a first prize of US $20,000 and publication in The Economist’s annual flagship publication, “The World In”.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&dat=20000422&id=01ZIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iBQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2003,2039685 | title=What is your vision of the future? | work=New Straights Times | date=April 22, 2000[/tpl]
Over 3,000 entries from around the world were submitted via a website set up for the purpose and at various Royal Dutch Shell offices worldwide.
The judging panel included Bill Emmott, Esther Dyson,[tpl]cite news |title= Angel Investor Esther Dyson Increases Dosage in Health Startups|url=http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-deals/2012-12-26-angel-investor-esther-dyson-increases-dosage-of-health-startups/ |work= Bloomberg News|date= December 26, 2012[/tpl] Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, then-chairman of Royal Dutch Shell, and Matt Ridley, a British scientist and member of the House of Lords.[tpl]cite news |title=Getting better all the time|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16103826|work= The Economist|date= May 13, 2010[/tpl]

==Censorship==

Sections of The Economist criticising authoritarian regimes are frequently removed from the magazine by the authorities in those countries. The Economist regularly has difficulties with the ruling party of Singapore (the People's Action Party), which had successfully sued it, in a Singaporean court, for libel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HL01Ae01.html|title=Inconvenient truths in Singapore|accessdate=31 January 2007|work=Asia Times [/tpl]
The Economist, like many other publications, is subjected to censorship in India whenever it depicts a map of Kashmir. The maps are stamped by Indian Customs officials as being "neither correct, nor authentic". Issues are sometimes delayed, but not stopped or seized.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/asiaview/2010/12/censorship_india|title=Censorship in India|work=The Economist | date=7 December 2010[/tpl]
On 15 June 2006 Iran banned the sale of The Economist when it published a map labelling the Persian Gulf simply as "Gulf"—a choice that derives its political significance from the Persian Gulf naming dispute.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150191582529&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title=Iran bans The Economist over map|accessdate=31 January 2007|work=The Jerusalem Post [/tpl]
In a separate incident, the government of Zimbabwe went further and imprisoned The Economist's correspondent there, Andrew Meldrum. The government charged him with violating a statute on "publishing untruth" for writing that a woman was decapitated by supporters of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front party. The decapitation claim was retracted .[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080222094910/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=2574|title=Guardian and RFI correspondent risks two years in jail|accessdate=2 April 2014|work=Reporters Without Borders[/tpl] and allegedly fabricated by the woman's husband. The correspondent was later acquitted, only to receive a deportation order.
On August 19, 2013, The Economist disclosed that the Missouri Department of Corrections had censored its June 29 issue. According to the letter sent by the Department, prisoners were not allowed to receive the issue because "1. it constitutes a threat to the security or discipline of the institution; 2. may facilitate or encourage criminal activity; or 3. may interfere with the rehabilitation of an offender".[tpl]cite news|title=The Economist in prison: About that missing issue|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2013/08/economist-prison|work=The Economist|accessdate=2 April 2014|date=19 August 2013[/tpl]

==Criticism and controversy==

In 1991, James Fallows argued in The Washington Post that The Economist suffers from British class snobbery, pretentiousness, and simplistic argumentation, and "unwholesomely purveys smarty-pants English attitudes on our US shores". He also accused it of an editorial line often contradicted by the news stories.
In 1999, Andrew Sullivan complained in the New Republic that it uses "marketing genius" to make up for deficiencies in analysis and original reporting, resulting in "a kind of Reader's Digest"[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3874750,00.html|title=Not so groovy.|accessdate=27 April 2008|work=The New Republic| location=London| date=14 June 1999[/tpl] for America's corporate elite.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news1999/july99/news4707.html|title=Nasty barbs fly between New Republic and Economist.|accessdate=27 April 2008|work=Media Life[/tpl] While Sullivan did acknowledge that the magazine's claim about the dotcom bursting would probably be accurate in the long run, the bubble would not burst in the US market until 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dataandinvestmentconsult.com/investment-research/effects-of-recession-and-dot-com-bubble.html|title=Effects of Recession and Dot Com Bubble|publisher=Data and Investment Consult|accessdate=8 May 2011[/tpl] Sullivan also pointed out that the magazine greatly exaggerated the danger the US economy was in after the Dow Jones fell to 7,400 during the 1998 Labor Day weekend and noted that the magazine's claim that the US economy was at a high risk of entering a recession was far from clear.  He also said that The Economist is editorially constrained because so many scribes graduated from the same college at Oxford University, Magdalen College, which he described as "a somewhat ineffective system for correcting internal flaws in a global magazine".  The Guardian wrote that "its writers rarely see a political or economic problem that cannot be solved by the trusted three-card trick of privatisation, deregulation and liberalisation".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/aug/21/pressandpublishing.business1|title=Economist thrives on female intuition|date=21 August 2005|work=The Guardian| location=London| accessdate=2 January 2013[/tpl]
In 2008, former editor of Newsweek Jon Meacham, a self described "fan", criticised The Economist's focus on analysis over original reporting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.observer.com/node/39374|title=Jon Meacham Wants Newsweek to Be More Like Hayes' Esquire.|accessdate=27 April 2008|work=New York Observer[/tpl]
In 2012, The Economist was accused — denied by the weekly — that it had hacked into the computer of Bangladesh Supreme Court Justice, Mohammed Nizamul Huq, leading to his resignation as the chairman of the International Crimes Tribunal.Discrepancy in Dhaka, The Economist, December 8, 2012.Economist accused of hacking ICT judge's computer, Washington Post, December 9, 2012.Economist magazine faces contempt in Bangladesh, Huffington Post, December 9, 2012.Bangladeshi war crimes tribunal issues notice to The Economist, The Indian Express, December 6, 2012.Tribunal chief's net talks, mail hacked, Daily Star, December 7, 2012.The trial of the birth of a nation, The Economist, December 15, 2012.
