James Michael Leathes Prior, Baron Prior, PC, known as "Jim Prior" (born 11 October 1927), is a British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he was a member of parliament (MP) from 1959 to 1987, representing the constituency of Lowestoft from 1959 to 1983 and the renamed constituency of Waveney from 1983 to 1987. He served in the Cabinet from 1970 to 1974, and from 1979 to 1984. He was made a life peer in 1987. Lord Prior served as the Chairman of the Arab British Chamber of Commerce from 1996 to 2004.
Although he was in the cabinet of Margaret Thatcher (1979–81) as employment minister, he disagreed with some of her views on trade unions and her monetarist economic policies generally. This made him a leader of the "wet" faction in the Conservative Party.Hugo Young, One of Us (1989) pp 193–99

==Life and career==

Prior was educated at Charterhouse School, before going on to Cambridge University, where he earned a first class honours degree in Land economy at Pembroke College. He did military service as an officer in the Royal Norfolk Regiment of the British Army, serving in Germany and India.
He was first elected to Parliament in 1959, and was Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from 1970–1972, then Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council until February 1974. He was one of several unsuccessful candidates in the Conservative Party's 1975 leadership election, entering at the second round and gaining 19 votes to Margaret Thatcher's 146.

==Cabinet years==

Under Margaret Thatcher he was Secretary of State for Employment from May 1979 to 14 September 1981. Of his appointment, Thatcher said of their relationship "we agreed that trade unions had acquired far too many powers and privileges. We also agreed that these must be dealt with one step at a time. But when it came down to specific measures, there was deep disagreement about how fast and how far to move."Margaret Thatcher, The Downing Street Years (HarperCollins, 1993), p. 28.
Prior is believed to have annoyed Thatcher by being too friendly with trade union leaders, with Thatcher writing "He Prior had forged good relations with a number of trade union leaders whose practical value he perhaps overestimated." And during his period in the Cabinet, he is believed to have angered the right wing of his party and the Prime Minister for not pressing far enough with anti-trade union legislation. In September 1981, Prior became Secretary of State for Northern Ireland[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thepost.ie/archives/2006/0702/charity-queens-and-their-subjects-15305.html|title=Charity queens and their subjects|last=Kehoe|first=Emmanuel|date=2 July 2006|work=The Sunday Business Post|accessdate=20 November 2010[/tpl] and was in this office until September 1984.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rMtAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zKUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6085,1400087&dq=jim-prior+northern-ireland&hl=en|title=Thatcher in sombre mood over pit talks|last=Parkhouse|first=Geoffrey|date=8 September 1984|work=Glasgow Herald|page=1|accessdate=20 November 2010[/tpl] This transfer was widely seen as a move by Thatcher to isolate Prior, who disagreed with her on a number of economic issues. The post of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was seen as a dumping ground to marginalise ministers. However when Prior resigned, Thatcher revealed that she was going to offer him another Cabinet post during the reshuffle, which would have very likely been a non-economic one.

==Later years==

In 1986, he collaborated with John Cassels and Pauline Perry to create the Council for Industry and Higher Education (CIHE) which would become the National Centre for Universities and Business in 2013.
He retired from Parliament in 1987 and was later created a life peer as Baron Prior, of Brampton in the County of Suffolk.He is Vice-President and was Chairman of the Rural Housing Trust. His son David Prior held the seat of North Norfolk between 1997–2001.

==In the media==

Prior was interviewed about the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series Tory! Tory! Tory!.
