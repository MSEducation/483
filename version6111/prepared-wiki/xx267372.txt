==Early-to-mid-life==

Tjalke Charles Gaastra was born in 1879, and immigrated to the mid-western United States with his family. Between the ages of 14 to 21, Gaastra worked as a hod carrier, bricklayer and logger. From 1901-1910, he was listed as an architect in Kenosha, Wisconsin. In 1911, Gaastra received his architecture license from the state of Illinois, and worked in Chicago for seven years designing schools. He married in 1917 and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1918. Gaastra was architect on the Gildersleeve home built for David Chavez in 1928, property originally owned by painter/photographer, Carlos Vierra.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newmexicoalhn.net/taos/taosobituaries1947.html |title=Taos County Obituaries 1947 |publisher=Newmexicoalhn.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-14[/tpl]

==Move to Albuquerque==

in 1923, T. Charles Gaastra, who had come to Santa Fe in 1918 and designed buildings using the emergent Santa Fe style, had moved his practice to the larger, more promising Albuquerque which left architects John Gaw Meem and Cassius McCormick in demand.
