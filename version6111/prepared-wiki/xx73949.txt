</ref>  The city of [[Latacunga]] was again leveled completely due to the mudslide deposits.
There was a major eruption from 1903 through 1904, and minor activity persisted until at least 1940 and possibly 1942.  (Note that direct observations of minor eruptions can be difficult because of bad weather, hence the uncertainty about the 1942 "eruption.")  The same source also reported increased thermal/seismic, non-eruptive activity in 1975 and 2002. In the most recent case of increased activity, fumarolic activity and sulfuric emissions increased and ice around the inside and on the southeastern side of the cone started to melt.  However, no actual eruption was observed.

===Climbing===

The first European who tried to climb the mountain was Alexander von Humboldt in 1802, however, he only reached a height of about 4500 m. In 1858 Moritz Wagner investigated the mountain, but he could not reach the summit either. On November 27, 1872, German geologist Wilhelm Reiss and his Colombian partner Angel Escobar finally reached the summit of Cotopaxi.[tpl]cite web|first=Eliot|last=Greenspan|title=Frommer's Ecuador and the Galápagos Islands|page=155|publisher=Wiley|location= USA|year= 2011|isbn=978-0-470-94951-1[/tpl] In 1873 it was again summited by Moritz Alphons Stübel, then in 1880 by Edward Whymper. Painters Rudolf Reschreiter and Hans Meyer reached the summit in 1903 and many of Reschreiter's paintings feature a view of Cotopaxi.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
In the late 20th century, summiting Cotopaxi became a major tourist draw. The José F. Ribas Refuge (Refugio José Félix Ribas) was built in 1971 at an elevation of 4800 m and enlarged in 2005. A tragedy occurred here on Easter Sunday 1996 when an avalanche partially buried the Refuge and dozens of tourists. The glacier above the Refuge was probably weakened by an earthquake that had shaken the entire Province of Cotopaxi for several days prior to the avalanche. In the warm midday sun a huge portion of the ice wall broke loose. Being Easter there were many day visitors on the mountain who were buried in the ice and snow. Those trapped in the Refuge broke windows on the downhill side to climb to safety, but 13 people died on the slope above. The Refuge itself is located in a valley and consequently vulnerable to future avalanches.
