The main vocalists of the group were Debbie Allen, Valerie Landsburg, Erica Gimpel, Carlo Imperato, Gene Anthony Ray, Lee Curreri, Lori Singer and P.R. Paul.
In 2008, television presenter Justin Lee Collins travelled to America to unite various members of the group in a show titled Bring Back...Fame.  They spoke of their success as a group in the UK and their live shows, and revealed that Erica Gimpel quit the group during the tour due to the pressures. Lansburg also talked about her surprise at the success of "Hi Fidelity". Curreri spoke about the music, saying that he was the only member to contribute to the writing of the songs and the only member to play an instrument on the recordings (synthesizer). However, Lori Singer also played the cello on some of the recordings. The show was transmitted on 27 December 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://uk-tv-guide.com/pick-of-the-day/27+December+2008/documentary-bring-back-fame-on-the-trail-of-an-80s-phenomenon/ |author= UK TV Guide | title=Bring Back Fame |accessdate=5 January 2009[/tpl]
