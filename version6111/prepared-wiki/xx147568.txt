[[Myanmar Premier League]]

CATEGORIES: Football competitions in Burma, National association football premier leagues

The Myanmar Premier League (since 2005 simply Myanmar League) was the top division of Burmese football in Myanmar from 1996 to 2009. The league consisted of Yangon-based football clubs, made up mostly of clubs run by various government ministries plus a few private football clubs. Founded in 1996, the league was an attempt to reform the Burma First Division football, which consisted of all government ministry run football clubs, by allowing private football clubs. Nonetheless, the Yangon-based league never gained traction with Burmese fans, and has been replaced by the Myanmar National League, the country's first ever professional league since March 2009. Finance and Revenue was the most successful club in the history of MPL, winning a total of 11 out of 13 championships.
