[[When the Sky Comes Down It Comes Down on Your Head]]

CATEGORIES: 2001 albums

When The Sky Comes Down It Comes Down On Your Head is the second full length album released by Edinburgh based shoegaze band The Zephyrs. It was recorded at The Substation in Cowdenbeath, Scotland. Additional recording took place at Blackwing Studios in London, and at the home of Rachel Goswell (of Mojave 3).
It includes several noteworthy guest musicians. Adele Bethel of Arab Strap performs vocals on "Modern Beats", Rachel Goswell sings on "Setting Sun" and Sean O'Hagan (The High Llamas and Stereolab) contributes string arrangements.
Allmusic called it "...a rare perfect record."
Southpaw Records folded on the very same week that they released this album. Unfortunately for the band, this meant that their publishing deal evaporated, as did their promotional and touring budget. And so, despite the critical acclaim this record received, the band did not have the finances to capitalise on it and each went back to their day jobs.
