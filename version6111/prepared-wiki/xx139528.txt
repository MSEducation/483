CATEGORIES: Military communications, Telephony equipment

Field telephones are mobile telephones intended for military use, designed to withstand wartime conditions. They can draw power from their own battery, from a telephone exchange (via a central battery known as CB), or from an external power source. Some need no battery, being sound-powered telephones.
Field telephones were first used in the First World War to direct troops. They replaced flag signals and the telegraph as an efficient means of communication. The first field telephones had a wind-up generator, used to power the telephone's ringer & batteries to send the call, and call the manually operated telephone central. This technology was used from the 1910s to the 1960s. Later the ring signal has been made electronically operated by a pushbutton, or automatic as on domestic telephones. The manual systems are still widely used, and are often compatible with the older equipment.
Field telephones operate over wire lines, sometimes commandeering civilian circuits when available, but often using wires strung in combat conditions.An account of line stringing in WW II At least as of World War II, wire communications were the preferred method for the U.S. Army, with radio use only when needed, e.g. to communicate with mobile units, or until wires could be set up. Field phones could operate point to point or via a switchboard at a command post.Signal Operations in the Corps and Army, FM 11-22, U.S. War Department, January 1945 A variety of wire types are used, ranging from light weight "assault wire," e.g. W-130 —[tpl]convert|30|lb/mi|abbr=off|disp=flip[/tpl]— with a talking range about [tpl]convert|5|mi|disp=flip[/tpl], to heavier cable with multiple pairs. Equipment for laying the wire ranges from reels on backpacks to trucks equipped with plows to bury lines.Wire and Cable Equipment, World War II
