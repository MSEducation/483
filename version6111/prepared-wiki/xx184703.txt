She was awarded the 1994 Gordon Allport Intergroup Relations Prize (with Eugene Borgida) for her research examining the effects of sexist advertising on men's behavior toward female job applicants. 
Her 2007 Sex Roles: A Journal of Research publication, "The interpersonal power of feminism: Is feminism good for relationships?" made the assertion that feminists make better lovers than non-feminists and sparked a stir in the academic community.
