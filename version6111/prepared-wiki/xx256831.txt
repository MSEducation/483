==History==

Early in its history, the club flirted with failed partnerships. In 1911, they joined with SV Niederschönhausen for a year. They merged with BFC vom Jahre 1893 in 1918 to play as Sportvereinigung Normannia vom Jahre 1893 in another short-lived partnership lasting just a year. In 1928, they adopted the name Berliner Sportclub Normannia before later becoming Sportverein Normannia. Throughout this period and through to the end of World War II, the team played lower-tier local football.
The club briefly disappeared in the aftermath of the war when occupying Allied authorities banned organizations across the country, including sports and football clubs, a part of the process of denazification. New clubs soon emerged in the latter half of 1945 and the membership of Normannia was re-organized as Sportgruppe Nordost alongside a large part of the former membership of Nordiska Berlin. Normannia was re-founded on 15 April 1950 and resumed its place as a lower-tier local side. The club's greatest success came with their advance to the Amateur Oberliga Berlin (III) for a single season turn in 1971–72.
Having been promoted from the 2009–10 Kreisliga Berlin A (Staffel 3), MSV Normannia 08 currently play in the 8th tier Bezirksliga Berlin (Staffel 2).
