[[Computer-mediated reality]]

CATEGORIES: Multimodal interaction, User interface techniques

Computer-mediated reality refers to the ability to add to, subtract information from, or otherwise manipulate one's perception of reality through the use of a wearable computer or hand-held device"Wearable,Tetherless, Computer-Mediated Reality", Technical Report #260, M.I.T. Medial Lab Perceptual Computing Section, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1994 such as a smart phone.
Typically, it is the user's visual perception of the environment that is mediated.  This is done through the use of some kind of electronic device, such as an EyeTap device or smart phone, which can act as a visual filter between the real world and what the user perceives.
Computer-mediated reality has been used to enhance visual perception as an aid to the visually impaired.  This example achieves a mediated reality by altering a video input stream light that would have normally reached the user's eyes, and computationally altering it to filter it into a more useful form.
It has also been used for interactive computer interfaces.Interactive Mediated Reality, Raphael Grasset, Jean-Dominique Gascuel, and Dieter Schmalstieg, Proc. ISMAR 2003, IEEE
The use of computer-mediated reality to diminish perception, by the removal or masking of visual data, has been used for architectural applications, and is an area of ongoing research (see for instance, here and here)

==Applications==

Applications of mediated reality include devices that help people see better, as well as devices for gaming and equipment repair, telemedicine, remote expert advice interfaces, and wayfinding.  Mediated reality is also used in roboticsDaniel Suarez: Daemon: Bot-mediated Reality (discussion of Mediated and Augmented Reality, bots, etc.) and drawing applications such as the "Loose and Sketchy" drawing package[ref]A Loose and Sketchy Approach in a Mediated Reality Environment, by Haller, M., Landerl, F., and Billinghurst, M.
