At the start of her career, Moore was known for her bubblegum pop sound, which she revealed was not the type of music she prefers, saying, "record company was like, 'Here are your songs.' I was like, 'Hi, I'm fourteen. I'll do anything.' Those albums are why I'm here today, but god damn, I should give a refund to anyone who bought my first record."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.monkeyouttanowhere.com/quotes/archives/2003/10/17_15_51.html|title=Interview:Mandy Moore explains her pop days|first=Leah|last=Collins|date=January 20, 2010|accessdate=2011-05-31|work=Dose.ca|publisher=Cananda.com[/tpl]
