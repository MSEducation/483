[[Human skin color]]

CATEGORIES: Skin physiology, Human appearance, Human genetics, Skin pigmentation

Human skin color ranges in variety from the darkest brown to the lightest pinkish-white hues. Human skin pigmentation is the result of natural selection. Skin pigmentation in human beings evolved to primarily regulate the amount of ultraviolet radiation penetrating the skin, controlling its biochemical effects.[tpl]cite book|last=Muehlenbein|first=Michael|title=Human Evolutionary Biology|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=192–213[/tpl]
The actual skin color of different humans is affected by many substances, although the single most important substance determining human skin color is the pigment melanin. Melanin is produced within the skin in cells called melanocytes and it is the main determinant of the skin color of darker-skinned humans. The skin color of people with light skin is determined mainly by the bluish-white connective tissue under the dermis and by the haemoglobin circulating in the veins of the dermis. The red color underlying the skin becomes more visible, especially in the face, when, as consequence of physical exercise or the stimulation of the nervous system (anger, fear), arterioles dilate.[tpl]cite book|last=Jablonski|first=N.G.|title=Skin: a Natural History|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley[/tpl]
There is a direct correlation between the geographic distribution of UV radiation (UVR) and the distribution of indigenous skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that highlight higher amounts of UVR reflect darker-skinned populations, generally located nearer towards the equator. Areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower concentration of UVR, which is reflected in lighter-skinned populations.[tpl]cite journal|last=Webb|first=A.R.|title=Who, what, where, and when: influences on cutaneous vitamin D synthesis|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|volume=92|issue=1|pages=17–25|pmid=16766240|year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2006.02.004[/tpl] Researchers suggest that human populations over the past 50,000 years have changed from dark-skinned to light-skinned and vice versa as they migrated to different UV zones,[tpl]cite journal|last=Jablonski|first=Nina G.|title=Why Human Skin Comes in Colors|journal=AnthroNotes|date=Spring 2011|volume=32|issue=1|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/ngj2/blogs/nina_jablonski/publications/Jablonski.2011.Anthro.Notes.pdf|accessdate=2013-07-20[/tpl] and that such major changes in pigmentation may have happened in as little as 100 generations (~2,500 years) through selective sweeps.[tpl]cite web|title=The Human Family Tree Facts|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/a-night-of-exploration/articles/the-human-family-tree-facts/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=2013-07-20[/tpl] Natural skin color can also darken as a result of tanning due to exposure to sunlight. The leading theory is that skin color adapts to intense sunlight irradiation to provide partial protection against the ultraviolet fraction that produces damage and thus mutations in the DNA of the skin cells.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Jablonski |first1=N.

In addition, it has been observed that adult human females are considerably lighter in skin pigmentation than males. Females need more calcium during pregnancy and lactation. The body synthesizes vitamin D from sunlight, which helps it absorb calcium. Females evolved to have lighter skin so their bodies absorb more calcium.[tpl]cite journal| last1=Jablonski| first1=N.G. |author2=Chaplin| title=The evolution of human skin coloration| journal=Journal of Human Evolution| year=2000| volume=39| pages=57–106| url=http://faculty.washington.edu/charles/562_f2011/Week%201/Jablonski%202004.pdf| doi=10.1006/jhev.2000.0403| pmid=10896812[/tpl] 
The social significance of differences in skin color has varied across cultures and over time, as demonstrated with regard to social status and discrimination.

==Melanin and genes==

Melanin is produced by cells called melanocytes in a process called melanogenesis. Melanin is made within small membrane–bound packages called melanosomes. As they become full of melanin, they move into the slender arms of melanocytes, from where they are transferred to the keratinocytes. Under normal conditions, melanosomes cover the upper part of the keratinocytes and protect them from genetic damage. One melanocyte supplies melanin to thirty-six keranocytes according to signals from the keranocytes. They also regulate melanin production and replication of melanocytes.[tpl]cite book|last=Jablonski|first=Nina|title=Living Color|year=2012|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, London|isbn=978-0-520-25153-3[/tpl] People have different skin colors mainly because their melanocytes produce different amount and kinds of melanin. The genetic mechanism behind human skin color is mainly regulated by the enzyme tyrosinase, which creates the color of the skin, eyes, and hair shades.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sturm|first=R. A.|title=A golden age of human pigmentation genetics|journal=Trends in Genetics|year=2006|volume=22|issue=9|pages=464–469[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last1=Sturm|first1=R. A.|author2=Teasdale, and N. F. Fox|title=Human pigmentation genes: Identification, structure and consequences of polymorphic variation|journal=Gene|year=2001|volume=277|issue=1–2|pages=49–62|pmid=11602344[/tpl] Differences in skin color are also attributed to differences in size and distribution of melanosomes in the skin. Melanocytes produce two types of melanin. The most common form of biological melanin is eumelanin, a brown-black polymer of dihydroxyindole carboxylic acids, and their reduced forms. Most are derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Eumelanin is found in hair, areola, and skin, and the hair colors grey, black, yellow, and brown. In humans, it is more abundant in people with dark skin. Pheomelanin, a pink to red hue is found in particularly large quantities in red hair,[tpl]Cite journal|title = Diversity of human hair pigmentation as studied by chemical analysis of eumelanin and pheomelanin|date = Dec 2011|last = Ito S, Wakamatsu K|journal = J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol.|issue = 12|pages = 1369|volume = 25|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-3083.2011.04278.x|pmid=22077870|first1 = S.|last2 = Wakamatsu|first2 = K.[/tpl] the lips, nipples, glans of the penis, and vagina.http://www.metacyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=COMPOUND&object=CPD-12380
Both the amount and type of melanin produced is controlled by a number of genes that operate under incomplete dominance.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for this sentence; "Incomplete and semi-dominance" section of "Dominance (genetics)" article has no citations either |date=February 2014[/tpl] One copy of each of the various genes is inherited from each parent. Each gene can come in several alleles, resulting in the great variety of human skin tones. Melanin controls the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun that penetrates the skin by absorption. While UV radiation can assist in the production of vitamin D, excessive exposure to UV can damage health.

==Genetics of skin color variation==

The understanding of the genetic underlyings behind human skin color variation is still incomplete, however genetic studies have discovered a number of genes that affect human skin colour in specific populations, and have shown that this happens independently of other physical features such as eye and hair colour. Different populations have different allele frequencies of these genes and it is the combination of these allele variations that bring about the complex, continuous variation in skin coloration we can observe today in modern humans. Population and admixture studies suggest a 3-way model for the evolution of human skin colour, with dark skin evolving in early hominids in sub-Saharan Africa and light skin evolving separately in Europe and East Asia after modern humans had expanded out of Africa.[tpl]cite journal |author=McEvoy Brian et al. |journal=Human Molecular Genetics |year=2006 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=176–181 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddl217 |url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/suppl_2/R176.full |title=The genetic architecture of normal variation in human pigmentation: an evolutionary perspective and model [/tpl][tpl]cite journal| author=Richard A Sturm |journal=Human Molecular Genetics |year=2009 |volume=18 |pages=9–17 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddp003 |title = Molecular genetics of human pigmentation diversity[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Norton |first1=H.

===Dark skin===

===Light skin===

For the most part, the evolution of light skin has followed different genetic paths in European and East Asian populations. Two genes however, KITLG and ASIP, have mutations that were associated with lighter skin that have high frequencies in both European and East Asian populations and have estimated origin dates after humans spread out of Africa but before the divergence of the European and Asian lineages around 30,000 years ago. Two subsequent genome-wide association studies found no significant correlation between these genes and skin color, and suggest that the earlier findings may have been the result of incorrect correction methods and small panel sizes of the earlier studies, or that the genes have an effect too small to be detected by the larger studies.[tpl]cite journal|title = Genetic Architecture of Skin and Eye Color in an African-European Admixed Population|date = March 2013|last = Beleza|first = Sandra et al.|journal = PLoS Genetics|issue = 3|pages = e1003372|volume = 9|doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003372|pmid = 23555287|pmc=3605137|last2 = Johnson|first2 = Nicholas A.|last3 = Candille|first3 = Sophie I.|last4 = Absher|first4 = Devin M.|last5 = Coram|first5 = Marc A.|last6 = Lopes|first6 = Jailson|last7 = Campos|first7 = Joana|last8 = Araújo|first8 = Isabel Inês|last9 = Anderson|first9 = Tovi M.|last10 = Vilhjálmsson|first10 = Bjarni J.|last11 = Nordborg|first11 = Magnus|last12 = Correia e Silva|first12 = António|last13 = Shriver|first13 = Mark D.|last14 = Rocha|first14 = Jorge|last15 = Barsh|first15 = Gregory S.|last16 = Tang|first16 = Hua[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|title = Genome-Wide Association Studies of Quantitatively Measured Skin, Hair, and Eye Pigmentation in Four European Populations|date = 31 October 2012|last = Candille|first = Sophie I. et al.|journal = PLoS ONE|issue = 10|pages = e48294|volume = 7|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0048294|pmid = 23118974|pmc=3485197|last2 = Absher|first2 = Devin M.|last3 = Beleza|first3 = Sandra|last4 = Bauchet|first4 = Marc|last5 = McEvoy|first5 = Brian|last6 = Garrison|first6 = Nanibaa’ A.|last7 = Li|first7 = Jun Z.|last8 = Myers|first8 = Richard M.|last9 = Barsh|first9 = Gregory S.|last10 = Tang|first10 = Hua|last11 = Shriver|first11 = Mark D.[/tpl]

====Europe====

A number of genes have been positively associated with the skin pigmentation difference between European and non-European populations. Mutations in SLC24A5 and SLC45A2 are believed to account for the bulk of this variation and show very strong signs of selection. A variation in TYR has also been identified as a contributor.
Research indicates the selection for the light-skin alleles of these genes in Europeans is comparatively recent, having occurred later than 20,000 years ago and perhaps as recently as 12,000 to 6,000 years ago.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Gibbons |first1=A. |doi=10.1126/science.316.5823.364a |title=AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGISTS MEETING: European Skin Turned Pale Only Recently, Gene Suggests |year=2007 |pages=364a |volume=316 |journal=Science |url=http://galsatia.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/blanche_paleur.pdf |pmid=17446367 |issue=5823[/tpl] In the 1970s, Luca Cavalli-Sforza suggested that the selective sweep that rendered light skin ubiquitous in Europe might be correlated with the advent of farming and thus have taken place only around 6,000 years ago;[tpl]cite journal |last1=Gibbons |first1=A. |doi=10.1126/science.316.5823.364a |title=AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGISTS MEETING: European Skin Turned Pale Only Recently, Gene Suggests |year=2007 |pages=364a |volume=316 |journal=Science |url=http://galsatia.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/blanche_paleur.pdf |pmid=17446367 |issue=5823[/tpl] "a suggestion made 30 years ago by Stanford University geneticist L. Luca Cavalli-Sforza ... that the early immigrants to Europe ... survived on ready-made sources of vitamin D in their diet. But when farming spread in the past 6000 years, he argued, Europeans had fewer sources of vitamin D in their food and needed to absorb more sunlight to produce the vitamin in their skin." This scenario found support in a 2014 analysis of mesolithic (7,000 years old) hunter-gatherer DNA from La Braña, Spain, which showed the version of these genes corresponding to dark skin color.Olalde et al., Derived immune and ancestral pigmentation alleles in a 7,000-year-old Mesolithic European Nature (2014) doi:10.1038/nature12960. "The La Braña individual carries ancestral alleles in several skin pigmentation genes, suggesting that the light skin of modern Europeans was not yet ubiquitous in Mesolithic time"

====East Asia====

A number of genes known to affect skin colour have alleles that show signs of positive selection in East Asian populations. Of these only OCA2 has been directly related to skin colour measurements, while DCT, MC1R and ATTRN are marked as candidate genes for future study.

===Tanning response===

Tanning response in humans is controlled by a variety of genes. MC1R variants Arg151Sys (rs1805007Reference SNP(refSNP) Cluster Report: rs1805007. Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (2008-12-30).), Arg160Trp (rs1805008Reference SNP(refSNP) Cluster Report: rs1805008.

Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (2008-12-30).) have been associated with reduced tanning response in European and/or East Asian populations. These alleles show no signs of positive selection and only occur in relatively small numbers, reaching a peak in Europe with around 28% of the population having at least one allele of one of the variations.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7581459 |title=Variants of the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor gene are associated with red hair and fair skin in humans |author=Valverde et al. |journal=Nature Genetics |year=1995 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=328–30 |doi=10.1038/ng1195-328|pmid=7581459 |last2=Healy |first2=Eugene |last3=Jackson |first3=Ian |last4=Rees |first4=Jonathan L. |last5=Thody |first5=Anthony J.

===Albinism===

Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a lack of pigment in the eyes, skin and sometimes hair that occurs in a very small fraction of the population. The four known types of OCA are caused by mutations in the TYR, OCA2, TYRP1, and SLC45A2 genes.ALBINISM, OCULOCUTANEOUS, TYPE IA; OCA1A, Johns Hopkins University
