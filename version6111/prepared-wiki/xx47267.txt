Athletes from twelve nations competed in St. Louis.

===Disputed===

Some sources also list athletes from the following nations as having competed at these Games.

==Medal count==

These are the top ten nations to win medals at the 1904 Games.
The nationalities of many medalists are disputed as many competitors were recent immigrants to the United States who had not yet been granted US citizenship.
The International Olympic Committee considers Norwegian-American wrestlers Charles Ericksen and Bernhoff Hansen to have competed for the United States; each won a gold medal. In 2012, Norwegian historians however found documentation showing that Ericksen did not receive American citizenship until March 22, 1905, and that Hansen, who was registered as an "alien" as late as 1925, probably never received American citizenship. The historians have therefore petitioned to have the athletes registered as Norwegians.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nrk.no/ol2012/nyheter/her-er-norges-ukjente-ol-gullvinner-1.8281024|work=NRK|title=Her er beviset som endrer norsk idrettshistorie|date=August 14, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/sport/usas-os-guld-var-egentligen-norges_7422064.svd|work=Svenska Dagbladet|title=USA-guld 1904 var Norges|date=August 14, 2012[/tpl] 
In May 2013 it was reported that the Norwegian Olympic Committee had filed a formal application for changing the nationality of the wrestlers in IOC's medal database.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/sport/kampsport/article3617871.ece|work=Nettavisen|title=Norges OL-historie skrives på nytt|date=May 3, 2013[/tpl]
The Australian Olympic Committee claims Francis Gailey as an Australian rather than an American as per the IOC records. He won three silver  medals and a bronze in swimming.http://corporate.olympics.com.au/F50BFE65-5056-B031-6AE23D104E37B9A4
Multi-medalist Frank Kugler is recognised as an American by the IOC although he was a German national at the time of the Games. http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ku/frank-kugler-1.html. The same applies to Swiss national Gustav Thiefenthaler. http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ti/gustav-tiefenthaler-1.html
The IOC also lists French-American Albert Corey as a United States competitor for his marathon silver medal, but (together with four undisputed Americans) as part of a mixed team for the team race silver medal. Other sources list these athletes as competitors for their country of birth rather than the United States.
