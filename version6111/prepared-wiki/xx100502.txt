Poulan is a brand name of the Swedish manufacturer Husqvarna AB, once a component of the Swedish conglomerate Electrolux.  In 2006 Electrolux spun off Husqvarna AB into its own company, with Poulan nested beneath. 

==History==

Poulan was originally an independent American company based in Shreveport, Louisiana, founded as Poulan Saw Co. in 1912 by chainsaw pioneer Claude Poulan. Purchased in late fifties or early sixties by the Beaird Company, also of Shreveport, it was known as Beaird-Poulan. The company was acquired by Emerson Electric in 1972, and was purchased by Electrolux several years later. A poulan chainsaw model 245a was featured in the 1974 movie The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.

==Poulan brand today==

The Poulan brand name is used primarily for outdoor power equipment, such as chainsaws, lawn mowers, and leaf blowers, aimed at the mid-level consumer marker.  Since Poulan is owned by Husqvarna, the two brands often share technologies.  In recent years Poulan has offered a more upscale "Poulan Pro" brand employing a black and gold color scheme instead of Poulan's traditional green.  As a result, Poulan products have been pushed even further downmarket. [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
Along with Poulan and Husqvarna brand products, Husqvarna also provides lawn mowers, lawn tractors, and other yard equipment to Sears that are sold under Sears' Craftsman house brand name.  Most mid-level Craftsman products are slightly altered Poulan products.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]
