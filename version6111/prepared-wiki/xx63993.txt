==History and construction==

By 1998, the Dallas Mavericks, then owned by H. Ross Perot, Jr., and the Dallas Stars were indicating their desire for a new facility to replace the dated Reunion Arena. Dallas taxpayers approved a new hotel tax and rental car tax to pay for a new facility to cover a portion of the funding, with the two benefiting teams, the Mavericks and the Stars, picking up the remaining costs, including cost overruns. The new arena was to be built just north of Woodall Rodgers Freeway near Interstate 35E on the site of an old power plant.http://www.americanairlinescenter.com/about-aacenter/overview.phphttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/01/business/commercial-real-estate-downtown-dallas-project-mired-in-disputes.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm
On March 18, 1999, American Airlines announced that it would be acquiring the naming rights for the arena for US$195 million.[tpl]cite web | publisher=American Airlines Center | url=http://www.americanairlinescenter.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/Page/PageID/73/ArticleID/126 | title=American and the Arena Group Announce Agreement To Name New Dallas Facility American Airlines Center | accessdate=25 October 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web | publisher=American Airlines Center | url=http://www.americanairlinescenter.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/Page/PageID/73/ArticleID/71 | title=Owners Add Upgrades to American Airlines Center | accessdate=25 October 2006[/tpl] American Airlines is headquartered in Fort Worth and is based at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.

==Design==

Principal design work was carried out by David M. Schwarz Architectural Services of Washington D.C. American Airlines Center was designed to be the heart of a new urban, commercial area designed to reinvigorate the city of Dallas called Victory Park. The facility itself features a conservative, traditional design with sweeping brick façades and smooth arches, and has been graced with a number of awards (below). The interior includes retractable seating, public art and a state-of-the-art technological arena. Because of the Quonset hut-like appearance of its roof and the fact that American Airlines holds the naming rights some fans have come to refer to it as "The Hangar".
On the south side of the arena AT&T Plaza (also called Victory Plaza) serves as the principal entrance into the facility, designed by artist Athena Tacha in 2000. The plaza provides an open space with fountains flanked by retail and office buildings. With several high-definition video displays from Daktronics mounted on the side of the arena and office buildings, the plaza is often used for outdoor events and movie showings.[tpl]cite web |title=Entertainment Venue – American Airlines Center|url=http://www.americanairlinescenter.com/about-aacenter/att_plaza.php|publisher=American Airlines Center|accessdate=February 1, 2013[/tpl]
