==History==

In the fall of November 1992, Senator David Boren, then Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, sponsored the National Security Act of 1992, attempting to achieve modest reform in the U.S. Intelligence Community.  His counterpart on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence was Congressman Dave McCurdy. The House version of the legislation included a separate Open Source Office, at the suggestion of Larry Prior, a Marine Reservist with Marine Corps Intelligence Command experience then serving on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence staff.
The Aspin-Brown Commission stated in 1996 that US access to open sources was "severely deficient" and that this should be a "top priority" for both funding and DCI attention.
In issuing its July 2004 report, the 9/11 Commission recommended the creation of an open source intelligence agency, but without further detail or comment.See page 413 of the 9-11 Commission Report (pdf). Subsequently, the WMD Commission (also known as the Robb-Silberman Commission) report in March 2005 recommended the creation of an Open Source Directorate at the CIA.
Following these recommendations, in November 2005 the Director of National Intelligence announced the creation of the DNI Open Source Center. The Center was established to collect information available from "the Internet, databases, press, radio, television, video, geospatial data, photos and commercial imagery."Office of the Director of National Intelligence. "ODNI Announces Establishment of Open Source Center". Press release, 8 November 2005. In addition to collecting openly available information, it would train analysts to make better use of this information. The OSC absorbed the CIA's previously existing Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), originally established in 1941, with FBIS head Douglas Naquin named as director of the Center.Ensor, David.

The OSC is located in the Reston Town Center development in Reston, Virginia, in the former headquarters of the FBIS.[tpl]cite web |title=High-Tech, Secure & Laboratory Environments |publisher=DNC Architects |url=http://www.dncarch.com/portfolio/hightech.htm |accessdate=April 4, 2013[/tpl][tpl]citation |author=Doug Naquin |title=Remarks by Doug Naquin, Director, Open Source Center |work=CIRA Newsletter |publisher=Central Intelligence Retirees' Association |volume=32 |issue=4 |year=2007 |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/naquin.pdf |accessdate=April 5, 2013[/tpl] The construction of the facility sparked some controversy in Reston, a planned community, due to the presence of a chained linked and barbed wire fence surrounding the buildings. In the late 1980s, the CIA agreed to install a more aesthetically pleasing fence around the buildings.[tpl]cite news |title=CIA Scraps Plan for More Reston Offices |newspaper=Washington Post |date=July 20, 1989 |page=V15[/tpl]
