[[Japanese Robin]]

CATEGORIES: Erithacus, Birds of Japan, Animals described in 1835

The Japanese Robin (Erithacus akahige, formerly Luscinia akahige) or komadori is a songbird. Recent research suggests that the East Asian robins belong into a new genus uniting them with some East Asian Luscinias such as the Siberian Blue Robin.[tpl]cite journal|last=Seki|first=Shin-Ichi |year=2006|title=The origin of the East Asian Erithacus robin, Erithacus komadori, inferred from cytochrome b sequence data|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=39|issue=3|pages=899â€“905|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.01.028|pmid=16529957[/tpl]
The name "Japanese Robin" is also sometimes used for the Red-billed Leiothrix (Leiothrix lutea). The specific name akahige is, somewhat confusingly, the common name of its relative Erithacus komadori in Japanese. [tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
