Scandinavian Airlines or SAS, previously Scandinavian Airlines System, is the flag carrier of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden,[tpl]cite web|title= Profile for SAS|publisher= Centre for Aviation|url= http://centreforaviation.com/profiles/airlines/sas-sk|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6A6cVm8vu|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-8-22[/tpl]|archivedate= [tpl]date|2012-8-22[/tpl][/tpl] and the largest airline in Scandinavia.
Part of the Scandinavian Airlines System Aktiebolag and headquartered at Stockholm-Arlanda Airport in Sigtuna, Sweden, the airline operates 182 aircraft to 90 destinations. The airline's only intercontinental hub is at Copenhagen-Kastrup Airport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flysas.com/en/us/Generic/Services/Route_map/ |title=Route map - SAS |publisher=Flysas.com |accessdate=2014-03-17[/tpl] Copenhagen-Kastrup airport is also the largest of three hubs for European routes, with Oslo-Gardermoen International Airport and Stockholm-Arlanda Airport as second and third respectively. Minor hubs also exist at Bergen-Flesland International Airport, Gothenburg-Landvetter Airport, Stavanger-Sola Airport and Trondheim-Værnes.
In 2012, SAS carried 25.9 million passengers, achieving revenues of SEK 36 billion.Annual Report 2012 sasgroup.net Retrieved on 22 August 2013. This makes it the ninth-largest airline in Europe. The SAS fleet consists of Airbus A319, A320, A321, A330 and A340, Boeing 737 Next Generation, and Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft.
The airline was founded in 1946 as a consortium to pool the transatlantic operations of Det Danske Luftfartselskab, Svensk Interkontinental Lufttrafik and Det Norske Luftfartselskap. The consortium was extended to cover European and domestic cooperation two years later. In 1951, all the airlines were merged to create SAS.
SAS is one of the founding members of Star Alliance.

==History==

===Founding===

The airline was founded on 1 August 1946, when Svensk Interkontinental Lufttrafik AB (an airline owned by the Swedish Wallenberg family), Det Danske Luftfartselskab A/S and Det Norske Luftfartselskap AS (the flag carriers of Denmark and Norway) formed a partnership to handle the intercontinental air traffic of these three Scandinavian countries.[tpl]cite web| title=Historie| publisher=SAS| url=http://www.sas.dk/da/Om-SAS-Danmark2/Historie/?vst=true[/tpl] Operations started on 17 September 1946. In 1948 the Swedish flag carrier AB Aerotransport joined SAS and the companies coordinated European operations and finally merged to form the SAS Consortium in 1951. When established, the airline was divided between SAS Danmark (28.6%), SAS Norge (28.6%) and SAS Sverige (42.8%), all owned 50% by private investors and 50% by their governments.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]

===Trans polar route===

In 1954, SAS was the first airline to initiate scheduled service over a polar route. The DC-6B flew from Copenhagen to Los Angeles, California, U.S.A. with stops in Søndre Strømfjord, Greenland, and Winnipeg, Canada. By summer 1956, the frequency of this service had increased to three flights per week. It was popular with Hollywood celebrities and film industry people, and the route turned out to be a publicity coup for SAS. Thanks to a tariff structure that allowed free transit to other European destinations via Copenhagen, this trans-polar route gained increasing popularity with American tourists throughout the 1950s. Starting in 1957, SAS initiated service on a second polar route when a DC-7C flew from Copenhagen to Tokyo, Japan, via Anchorage, Alaska, U.S.A.. At that time, the trans-polar service via Alaska was an compromise solution since the Soviet Union would not grant SAS - and other air carriers - permission to fly across Siberia between Europe and Japan, while the airspace of the PR China was also closed to overflights.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]  SAS publicized this service as "round the world service over the North Pole".[tpl]citation needed|date = October 2013[/tpl]

===Jet Era===

SAS entered the jet age in 1959 when the Caravelle entered service. In 1971, SAS put its first Boeing 747 jumbo jet into service.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]

===Acquisition of local airlines===

SAS gradually acquired control of the domestic markets in all three countries by acquiring full or partial control of local airlines, including Braathens and Widerøe in Norway, Linjeflyg and Skyways Express in Sweden and Cimber Air in Denmark. In 1989, SAS acquired 18.4% of Texas Air Corporation, parent company of Continental Airlines, in a bid to form a global alliance. This stake was later sold. During the 1990s, SAS also bought a 20% stake in British Midland. SAS bought 95% of Spanair, the second largest airline in Spain, as well as Air Greenland. There are plans to dispose of all of these holdingsSAS plans to sell Spanair and its stake in the British carrier bmi[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]International Herald Tribune and an agreement to divest more than 80 percent of the holdings in Spanair was signed with a Catalonian group of investors led by Consorci de Turisme de Barcelona and Catalana d'Inciatives in January 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cisionwire.se/sas/avtal-om-forsaljning-av-spanair-har-ingatts|title=SAS – press release (in Swedish)|publisher=Cision Wire|accessdate=2009-01-30[/tpl]

===Star Alliance founding member===

In May 1997 SAS formed the global Star Alliance network with Air Canada, Lufthansa, Thai Airways International and United Airlines. Four years earlier SAS unsuccessfully tried to merge with KLM, Star Alliance partner Austrian Airlines, and the now defunct Swissair, in a project called Alcazar.Talks Collapse On European Airline Merger[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]International Herald Tribune This failure led to the departure the following year of CEO Jan Carlzon, who was credited for the financial turnaround of the company starting in 1981 and who envisioned SAS ownership of multiple airlines worldwide. The ownership structure of SAS was changed in June 2001, with a holding company being created in which the holdings of the governments changed to: Sweden (21.4%), Norway (14.3%) and Denmark (14.3%) and the remaining 50% publicly held and traded on the stock market.

===Contemporary history (2004–present)===

In 2004 Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) was divided into four companies; SAS Scandinavian Airlines Sverige AB, SAS Scandinavian Airlines Danmark AS, SAS Braathens AS and SAS Scandinavian International AS. SAS Braathens was re-branded SAS Scandinavian Airlines Norge AS in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://se.yhp.waymaker.net/sasgroup/release.asp?id=147353|title=Press Release: SAS Braathens to be renamed SAS Norge|publisher=Waymaker (via SAS Group Press Release Archive)|accessdate=2010-03-23[/tpl] In October 2009 the four companies were once again united into one company, SAS Scandinavian System AB.
With the coming of low-cost airlines and decreasing fares in Scandinavia the business turned into the red. To be profitable again, the airline had to cut costs. In a first step the airline sold its stakes in other companies, such as bmi, Spanair and AirBaltic, and began to restructure its operations.[tpl]cite news|url=http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/10/01/sas-sells-remaining-stake-in-bmi-to-lufthansa/|title=SAS Sells Remaining Stake in BMI to Lufthansa|last=Nicholson|first=Chris V. |date=1 October 2009|work=New York Times|accessdate=18 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/30/spanair-idUSLU68460220090130|title=SAS sells Spanair for 1 euro, takes big charge|last=Roberts|first=Martin|coauthors=et al.|date=30 January 2009|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=18 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airbaltic.com/public/company_history.html|title=Company history|work=airBaltic.com|publisher=airBaltic|accessdate=18 November 2012[/tpl] This was to save costs by about 23 percent between 2008 and 2011. The next big cost-cutting measure followed by the end of 2011. It should generate cost savings of another three to four percent until 2015. In June 2012 the airline announced that they will extend this measure.volaspheric: SAS cuts costs In November 2012 the company came under heavy pressure from its owners and banks to implement even heavier cost-cutting measures as a condition for continued financial support. Negotiations with the respective trade unions took place for more than a week and exceeded the original deadline, but in the end SAS and the trade unions reached an agreement that would increase the worktime, cutting salary between 12-20%, pension and retirement plans, and thus keep the airline flying. SAS drew some criticism for how they handled the negotiations, in denying facilities to the union delegations.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.di.se/artiklar/2012/11/20/fackens-mardromsdygn-i-kopenhamn/|title= Nightmare for trade unions in Copenhagen |date=19 November 2012|work=Dagens Industri|accessdate=17 December 2012[/tpl]  [tpl]As of|2013|November[/tpl], there was the expectation that the company would show 2013 as its first profitable year since 2007.[tpl]Cite news|title = Cloudy Skies Remain for Carrier SAS|date = November 18, 2013|last = Schultes|first = Renée|newspaper = The Wall Street Journal|department = Money & Investing|page = C6[/tpl]

===Future fleet plans===

SAS has earlier stated that they plan to buy up to 55 new narrow-body aircraft to replace its McDonnell Douglas MD-80s and Boeing 737 Classics. But as a revised plan they will replace 9 McDonnell Douglas MD-80s and 11 Boeing 737 Classics with 17 leased Boeing 737 Next Generations. 17 McDonnell Douglas MD-80s will later be replaced by Airbus A320s.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-26/bombardier-s-c-series-is-contender-for-55-plane-sas-order-executive-says.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Ola | last=Kinnander | title=Bombardier's C-Series Is Contender for 55-Plane SAS Order, Airline Says | date=26 November 2010[/tpl]
On 20 June 2011, SAS announced an order for 30 new A320 next generation aircraft as part of its fleet harmonisation plan. SAS has earlier announced that the fleet will be harmonized. Its short range aircraft will consist of two types from 2015: Airbus A320 family at the base in Copenhagen and Boeing 737NG at the bases in Stockholm and Oslo. As of May 2013, the McDonnell Douglas MD-80s have been reduced to 6 of which all, are based in Copenhagen. The airline intends to further reduce the number of aircraft down to 5 by July and the last aircraft will be withdrawn from service in late October 2013. There are currently 6 leased A320s in the SAS fleet at the beginning of May 2013
As part of the transition, all the MD80s in Copenhagen will be replaced by leased Airbus A320 and be completed by the end of 2014. The leased A320s, in turn will be replaced by 30 new A320neos beginning in 2016. Airbus A320 is very attractive in the market and the SAS Group expects to finance the aircraft through a combination of leases and loans.
All the MD80s at the base in Stockholm will be replaced by leased Boeing 737NGs, which will be completed during 2013. Finally all the Boeing 737 Classics at the base in Oslo will be replaced by Boeing 737NGs and this will be completed by the end of 2014. As of December 2013 all Boeing 737 Classic is phased out and replaced by Boeing 737NG.
On 25 June 2013, SAS and Airbus signed a Memorandum of Understanding stating that SAS intends to buy 12 new generation aircraft, including 6 options. The agreement consists of 8 A350-900 with 6 options, and 4 A330-300E. The first new long haul aircraft to enter service will be the A330-300E, which will replace the aging A340-300 in 2015 as leasing agreements on these aircraft expire. The A350-900 is planned to enter service beginning in 2018. SAS has dubbed this “A total renewal of long haul fleet”, indicating that all former A340 and A330 will in fact be replaced.[tpl]cite web|url=http://se.yhp.waymaker.net/sasgroup/release.asp?id=269175 |title=SAS Group - Press |publisher=Se.yhp.waymaker.net |date=2013-06-25 |accessdate=2014-03-17[/tpl]

===Removal of SAS Dash Q400 fleet===

In September 2007, two separate incidents of similar landing gear failures occurred within four days of each other on SAS Dash 8-Q400 aircraft. A third incident occurred in October 2007. On 28 October 2007, in a move that was described as unique by the Swedish press, the board of directors announced that all 27 Dash 8 Q400 aircraft were to be removed from service due to three landing gear failures.SAS removes Dash 8 Q400 from service permanently
A press release from SAS said that the company had reached a settlement with Bombardier and Goodrich, whereby the airline would receive SEK one billion as compensation, while SAS would purchase 27 new aircraft, with an option of 24 more. These aircraft will consist of 13 of the CRJ900 Nextgen (10 to SAS and 3 to Estonian Air) and 14 of the updated Q400 Nextgen units (8 to airBaltic and 6 to Widerøe), with 7 additional options."News."

SAS received the first CRJ-900 on December 3, 2008, with others soon to follow. The CRJ900 fleet now consists of 12 aircraft.
SAS sold its original Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 fleet to Philippine Airlines for operation with subsidiary PAL Express, and also to Malev Hungarian Airlines.
In November 2007, it was revealed that Swedish Civil Aviation Authority began an investigation and accused Scandinavian Airlines System of cutting corners for maintenance. The airline reportedly made 2,300 flights in which safety equipment was not up to standard."Plane crash disaster narrowly avoided." The Copenhagen Post, September 10, 2007. Retrieved: December 6, 2009.

===Livery===

SAS planes look predominantly white, however, they are a very light beige with "Scandinavian" above the windows and "Airlines" below the windows in white lettering except for the belly which is actually white. The vertical stabilizers are blue with the traditional "SAS" logo on it. Also, the engine casing is painted in scarlet with the word Scandinavian in white, the thrust reversers are white.

==Services==

===Service classes===

SAS offers two service classes for intra-European flights, an economy class called "SAS Go" and a premium economy class called "SAS Plus". SAS Plus tickets are refundable, and include a meal, a double checked-in baggage allowance, and access to lounges and fast track immigration/security at the airport. The SAS Plus passengers are seated at the front of the aircraft but the seats there are otherwise the same as the SAS Go seats. The two-class system was introduced in June 2013, when business class was eliminated from intra-European flights.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.traveldailymedia.com/192395/sas-revamps-cabin-classes/|title=SAS revamps cabin classes|last=Elliott|first=Mark|publisher=Travel Daily Media|accessdate=12 June 2013[/tpl]
For long-haul flights business class, called "SAS Business", is still offered and features wide sleeper seats. Further back the seats offered on SAS Plus are wider than those in the SAS Go section. Meals are served to all passengers on long-haul flights.
SAS offers a continental breakfast on all flights departing before 9 o'clock in the morning.

===Lounges===

The following locations are SAS Scandinavian, Stockholm, and Business locations:

===Fingerprint biometric identification===

In 2006, SAS Sweden launched a new biometric system for use throughout Sweden. Each passenger's fingerprints are, for security purposes, matched to their respective checked baggage. The new technology will be phased in at all the airports served by SAS, although use of the system is voluntary for passengers. The system has been introduced in Norway.

===EuroBonus===

SAS's frequent-flyer program is called EuroBonus. Members also earn points on other Star Alliance flights.

===Fly Home Club===

Fly Home Club was SAS's membership club for Scandinavians living in Spain. It has closed ever since economic conditions have worsened in Spain and as Scandinavians living in Spain have decided to return home or change locations.
