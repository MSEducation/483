[[Borphukan]]

CATEGORIES: Ahom kingdom, Assamese-language surnames

Borphukan (Ahom language: Phu-Kan-Lung) was one of the five patra mantris (councillors) in the Ahom kingdom, a position that was created by the Ahom king Prataap Singha. The position included both executive and judicial powers, with jurisdiction of the Ahom kingdom west of Kaliabor river. The headquarters of Borphukan was based in Kaliabor and later shifted to Itakhuli in Guwahati during Lachit Borphukan period after the Mughals were ousted from Guwahati. This position was particularly important and powerful because of its distance from the Ahom capital, giving it a semblance of independence.  The region to the east of Kaliabor was governed by the Borbarua.
The Borphukan's residence was situated in the present Fansi Bazaar area of Guwahati.  The council-hall, called Dopdar, was situated about 300 yards west of the Bharalu stream.  The Borphukan's council was similar to the council-hall (Bor-Chora)  at the cipital and consisted of six Phukans  collectively called the Guwahatiya or Dopdariya Phukan.[tpl]Harvcol|Baruah|1992|pp=200â€“201[/tpl]  The Borphukan was assisted in administration by the Majindar Baruah (equivalent to a private secretary) whose residence was at the current Deputy Commissioner's residence.
