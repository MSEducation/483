A Wheatstone bridge is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown electrical resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of which includes the unknown component. Its operation is similar to the original potentiometer. It was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie in 1833 and improved and popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843.  One of the Wheatstone bridge's initial uses was for the purpose of soils analysis and comparison."The Genesis of the Wheatstone Bridge" by Stig Ekelof discusses Christie's and Wheatstone's contributions, and why the bridge carries Wheatstone's name.

At the point of balance, the ratio of

==Derivation==

First, Kirchhoff's first rule is used to find the currents in junctions B and D:
Then, Kirchhoff's second rule is used for finding the voltage in the loops ABD and BCD:
When the bridge is balanced, then [tpl]math|IG [tpl]=[/tpl] 0[/tpl], so the second set of equations can be rewritten as:
Then, the equations are divided and rearranged, giving:
From the first rule, [tpl]math|I3 [tpl]=[/tpl] Ix[/tpl] and [tpl]math|I1 [tpl]=[/tpl] I2[/tpl].  The desired value of [tpl]math|Rx[/tpl] is now known to be given as:
If all four resistor values and the supply voltage ([tpl]math|VS[/tpl]) are known, and the resistance of the galvanometer is high enough that [tpl]math|IG[/tpl] is negligible, the voltage across the bridge ([tpl]math|VG[/tpl]) can be found by working out the voltage from each potential divider and subtracting one from the other. The equation for this is:
where [tpl]math|VG[/tpl] is the voltage of node B relative to node D.

==Significance==

The Wheatstone bridge illustrates the concept of a difference measurement, which can be extremely accurate. Variations on the Wheatstone bridge can be used to measure capacitance, inductance, impedance and other quantities, such as the amount of combustible gases in a sample, with an explosimeter.  The Kelvin bridge was specially adapted from the Wheatstone bridge for measuring very low resistances.  In many cases, the significance of measuring the unknown resistance is related to measuring the impact of some physical phenomenon (such as force, temperature, pressure, etc.) which thereby allows the use of Wheatstone bridge in measuring those elements indirectly.
The concept was extended to alternating current measurements by James Clerk Maxwell in 1865 and further improved by Alan Blumlein in about 1926.

==Modifications of the fundamental bridge==

The Wheatstone bridge is the fundamental bridge, but there are other modifications that can be made to measure various kinds of resistances when the fundamental Wheatstone bridge is not suitable. Some of the modifications are:
