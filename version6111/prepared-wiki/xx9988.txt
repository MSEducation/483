Rush is a Canadian rock band formed in August 1968, in the Willowdale neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario. The band is composed of bassist, keyboardist, and lead vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist and backing vocalist Alex Lifeson, and drummer, percussionist, and lyricist Neil Peart. The band and its membership went through several re-configurations between 1968 and 1974, achieving their current form when Peart replaced original drummer John Rutsey in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first United States tour.
Since the release of the band's self-titled debut album in March 1974, Rush has become known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy. Rush's music style has changed over the years beginning with blues-inspired heavy metal, then encompassing progressive rock and a period with heavy use of synthesizers. Their musical style returned to a more guitar-oriented sound in 1989.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/presto-mw0000654443 |title=Presto |work=Allmusic.com |author=Gregory Heaney |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl] Their latest studio album, Clockwork Angels (2012) won the Album Of The Year Award from Progressive Music Awards.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.progrockmag.com/news/prog-awards-the-winners/ |date=September 5, 2012 |title=Prog Awards – The Winners |author=Jerry Ewing[/tpl] The supporting tour ran from September 2012 to August 2013.

==History==

===Early years (1968–76)===

The original line-up formed in the neighbourhood of Willowdale in Toronto, Ontario, by Lifeson, bassist and front man Jeff Jones, and drummer John Rutsey. Within a couple of weeks of forming, and before their second performance, bassist and lead vocalist Jones was replaced by Geddy Lee, a schoolmate of Lifeson. After several line-up reformations, Rush's official incarnation was formed in May 1971 consisting of Lee, Lifeson, and Rutsey. The band was managed by local Toronto resident Ray Danniels, a frequent attendee of Rush's early shows.[tpl]Cite book |last= Banasiewicz |first= Bill |title= Rush Visions: The Official Biography |publisher=Omnibus Press |year= 1990 |isbn= 0-7119-1162-2[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last= Banasiewicz |first= Bill |title= Rush Visions: The Official Biography (excerpt) |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/BanasiewiczVisions.htm |accessdate=March 10, 2007 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071011130610/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/BanasiewiczVisions.htm |archivedate= October 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes[/tpl]
After gaining stability in the line-up and honing their skills on the local bar/high school dance circuit, the band came to release their first single "Not Fade Away", a cover of the Buddy Holly song, in 1973. Side B contained an original composition, "You Can't Fight It", credited to Lee and Rutsey. The single generated little reaction and, because of record company indifference, the band formed their own independent record label, Moon Records. With the aid of Danniels and the newly enlisted engineer Terry Brown, the band released their self-titled debut album in 1974, which was considered highly derivative of Led Zeppelin. Rush had limited local popularity until the album was picked up by WMMS, a radio station in Cleveland, Ohio. Donna Halper, a music director and DJ working at the station, selected "Working Man" for her regular play list. The song's blue collar theme resonated with hard rock fans, and this newfound popularity led to the album being re-released by Mercury Records in the U.S.Halper, Donna.

Immediately after the release of the debut album in 1974, Rutsey was forced to leave the band due to health difficulties (stemming from diabetes) and his general distaste for touring. His last performance with the band was on July 25, 1974 at Centennial Hall in London, Ontario. Rush held auditions for a new drummer and eventually selected Neil Peart as Rutsey's replacement. Peart officially joined the band on July 29, 1974, two weeks before the group's first U.S. tour. They performed their first concert together, opening for Uriah Heep and Manfred Mann with an attendance of over 11,000 people at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on August 14. In addition to becoming the band's drummer, Peart assumed the role of principal lyricist from Lee, who had very little interest in writing, despite penning the lyrics of the band's first album.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/DEBUTlyrics.htm|title=Rush|publisher=www.2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=February 10, 2008[/tpl] Instead, Lee, along with Lifeson, focused primarily on the instrumental aspects of Rush. Fly by Night (1975), Rush's first album after recruiting Peart, saw the inclusion of the band's first epic mini-tale "By-Tor and the Snow Dog", replete with complex arrangements and multi-section format. Lyrical themes also underwent dramatic changes after the addition of Peart because of his love for fantasy and science-fiction literature.Fly By Night Review. Allmusic. Retrieved September 20, 2007. However, despite these many differences some of the music and songs still closely mirrored the blues style found on Rush's debut.
Following quickly on the heels of Fly By Night, the band released Caress of Steel (1975), a five-track album featuring two extended multi-chapter songs, "The Necromancer" and "The Fountain of Lamneth". Some critics said Caress of Steel was unfocused and an audacious move for the band because of the placement of two back-to-back protracted songs, as well as a heavier reliance on atmospherics and story-telling, a large deviation from Fly by Night.Greg Prato "Caress of Steel Review". Allmusic. Retrieved May 1, 2014. Intended to be the band's first "break-through" album, Caress of Steel sold below expectations and the promotional tour consisted of smaller venues, which led to the moniker the "Down the Tubes Tour".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/Tours.htm|title=Tour Archives|publisher=2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=April 17, 2006[/tpl] In light of these events, Rush's record label attempted to pressure them into moulding their next album in a more commercially friendly and accessible fashion. However, the band ignored the requests and developed their next album, 2112 with a 20-minute title track divided into seven sections. Despite this, the album was the band's first taste of commercial success and their first platinum album in Canada.Mini-Rush Bio. myTELUS/Music Beta. Retrieved November 3, 2008. The supporting tour for the album culminated in a three-night stand at Massey Hall in Toronto, which the band recorded for the release of their first live album titled All the World's a Stage.

===Mainstream success (1977–81)===

After 2112, Rush retreated to the United Kingdom to record A Farewell to Kings (1977) and Hemispheres (1978) at Rockfield Studios in Wales. These albums saw the band members expanding the use of progressive elements in their music. "As our tastes got more obscure," Geddy Lee said in a recent interview, "we discovered more progressive rock-based bands like Yes, Van der Graaf Generator and King Crimson, and we were very inspired by those bands. They made us want to make our music more interesting and more complex and we tried to blend that with our own personalities to see what we could come up with that was indisputably us."Wanderman, David. "Geddy Lee Interview". UGO.com, Trademarks such as increased synthesizer usage, lengthy songs reminiscent of miniature concept albums, and highly dynamic playing featuring complex time signature changes became a staple of Rush's compositions. To achieve a broader, more progressive palette of sound, Alex Lifeson began to experiment with classical and twelve-string guitars, and Geddy Lee added bass-pedal synthesizers and Minimoog. Likewise, Peart's percussion became diversified in the form of triangles, glockenspiel, wood blocks, cowbells, timpani, gong, and chimes. Beyond instrument additions, the band kept in stride with the progressive rock movement by continuing to compose long, conceptual songs with science fiction and fantasy overtones. However, as the new decade approached, Rush gradually began to dispose of their older styles of music in favour of shorter, and sometimes softer, arrangements. The lyrics up to this point (most of them written by Peart) were heavily influenced by classical poetry, fantasy literature, science fiction, and the writings of novelist Ayn Rand, as exhibited most prominently by their 1975 song "Anthem" from Fly By Night and a specifically acknowledged derivation in 2112 (1976).2112 and Ayn Rand Rush FAQ. Retrieved March 16, 2006.
Permanent Waves (1980) dramatically shifted Rush's style of music via the introduction of reggae and new wave elements.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Rush: Progressive To The Core|author=Geoff Barton|date=September 2006|journal=Classic Rock|volume=97[/tpl] Although a hard rock style was still evident, more and more synthesizers were introduced. Moreover, because of the limited airplay Rush's previous extended-length songs received, Permanent Waves included shorter, more radio-friendly songs such as "The Spirit of Radio" and "Freewill", two songs that helped Permanent Waves become Rush's first U.S. Top 5 album; both songs continue to make appearances on classic rock radio stations in Canada and the United States to this day.Review of Permanent Waves by Greg Prato Allmusic. Retrieved March 22, 2008. Meanwhile, Peart's lyrics shifted toward an expository tone with subject matter that dwelled less on fantastical or allegorical story-telling and more heavily on topics that explored humanistic, social and emotional elements. Rush joined with fellow Toronto-based rock band Max Webster on July 28, 1980 to record "Battle Scar" for their 1980 release, Universal Juveniles.[tpl]Cite book |last= Peart |first= Neil |title= Moving Pictures Tourbook – A Rush Newsreel |year= 1981 |url= http://www.cygnus-x1.net/links/rush/tourbook-movingpictures.php |accessdate=October 30, 2009[/tpl] While on tour together following the release, both bands would join between sets to play "Battle Scar". The song acted as both a transition from Max Webster to Rush, as well as a warm-up for Peart. In addition, Max Webster lyricist Pye Dubois offered the band lyrics to a song he had written. The band accepted; the song went on, after reworking by Peart, to become "Tom Sawyer".

Rush's popularity reached its pinnacle with the release of Moving Pictures in 1981. Moving Pictures essentially continued where Permanent Waves left off, extending the trend of highly accessible and commercially friendly progressive rock that helped thrust them into the spotlight. The lead track, "Tom Sawyer", is probably the band's best-known songRush Biography Allmusic guide, Jason Ankeny. Retrieved September 20, 2007. with "Limelight" also receiving satisfactory responses from listeners and radio stations. Moving Pictures was Rush's last album to feature an extended song, the eleven-minute "The Camera Eye". The song also contained the band's heaviest usage of synthesizers up to that point, hinting that Rush's music was shifting direction once more. Moving Pictures reached No.3 on the Billboard 200 album chart and has been certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.Moving Pictures Certification Search Moving Pictures.

Following the success of Moving Pictures and the completion of another four studio albums, Rush released their second live recording, Exit...Stage Left, in 1981. The album delineates the apex of Rush's progressive period by featuring live material from the band's Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures tours. As with their first live release, Exit...Stage Left identified the margin of a new chapter of Rush's sound.

===Synthesizer period (1982–89)===

The band underwent another radical stylistic transmutation with the recording of Signals in 1982.Signals Review by Greg Prato Allmusic. Retrieved March 22, 2008.

The band felt dissatisfied with Brown's studio treatment of Signals, while Brown was becoming more uncomfortable with the increased use of synthesizers in the music.Rush: Beyond The Lighted Stage Documentary Ultimately, Rush and Brown parted ways in 1983, and the experimentation with new electronic instruments and varying musical styles would come into further play on their next studio album.
The style and production of Signals were augmented and taken to new heights on Grace Under Pressure (1984). It was Peart who named the album, as he borrowed the words of Ernest Hemingway to describe what the band had to go through after making the decision to leave Terry Brown. Producer Steve Lillywhite, who gleaned fame with successful productions of Simple Minds and U2, was enlisted to produce Grace Under Pressure. However, he backed out at the last moment, much to the ire of Lee, Lifeson and Peart. Lee said "Steve Lillywhite is really not a man of his word....after agreeing to do our record, he got an offer from Simple Minds, changed his mind, blew us off,... so it put us in a horrible position." Rush eventually hired Peter Henderson to co-produce and engineer the album instead.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/GUPlyrics.htm|title=Grace Under Pressure|publisher=2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=February 16, 2008[/tpl]
Musically, although Lee's use of sequencers and synthesizers remained the band's cornerstone, his focus on new technology was complemented by Peart's adaptation of Simmons electronic drums and percussion. Lifeson's contributions on the album were decidedly enhanced to act as an overreaction to the minimalistic role he played on Signals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/GettSuccess.htm|title=Success Under Pressure|publisher=2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=May 7, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080624102316/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/GettSuccess.htm|archivedate=June 24, 2008[/tpl] Still, many of his trademark guitar textures remained intact in the form of open reggae chords and funk and new-wave rhythms.
With new producer Peter Collins, the band released Power Windows (1985) and Hold Your Fire (1987). The music on these two albums gives far more emphasis and prominence to Lee's multi-layered synthesizer work. While fans and critics took notice of Lifeson's diminished guitar work, his presence was still palpable. Lifeson, like many guitarists in the late 1980s, experimented with processors that reduced his instrument to echoey chord bursts and razor-thin leads. Hold Your Fire represents both a modest extension of the guitar stylings found on Power Windows, and, according to Allmusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia, the culmination of this era of Rush.Hold Your Fire Review Allmusic, Eduardo Rivadavia. Retrieved September 20, 2007. Whereas the previous five Rush albums sold platinum or better, Hold Your Fire only went gold in November 1987, although it managed to peak at number 13 on the Billboard 200.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/HYFlyrics.htm|title=Hold your Fire|publisher=2112.net|work=Power Windows website|accessdate=September 14, 2007[/tpl]
A third live album and video, A Show of Hands (1989), was also released by Anthem and Mercury following the Power Windows  and Hold Your Fire tours, demonstrating the aspects of Rush in the '80s. A Show of Hands met with strong fan approval, but Rolling Stone critic Michael Azerrad dismissed it as "musical muscle" with 1.5 stars, claiming Rush fans viewed their favourite power trio as "the holy trinity".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/321540/a_show_of_hands|title=A Show of Hands Review|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=June 6, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070817203049/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/321540/a_show_of_hands|archivedate=August 17, 2007[/tpl] Nevertheless, A Show of Hands managed to surpass the gold album mark, reaching number 21 on the Billboard 200.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/ASOHlyrics.htm|title=A Show of Hands|publisher=2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=December 18, 2010[/tpl] At this point, the group decided to change international record labels from Mercury to Atlantic.

===Return to guitar-oriented sound (1989–97)===

Rush started to deviate from their 1980s style with the albums Presto and Roll the Bones. Produced by record engineer and musician Rupert Hine, these two albums saw Rush shedding much of their keyboard-saturated sound. Beginning with Presto (1989), the band opted for arrangements that were notably more guitar-centric than the previous two studio albums. Although synthesizers were still used in many songs, the instrument was no longer featured as the centrepiece of Rush's compositions. Continuing this trend, Roll the Bones (1991) extended the use of the standard three-instrument approach with even less focus on synthesizers than its predecessor. While musically these albums do not deviate significantly from a general pop-rock sound, Rush incorporated traces of other musical styles. "Roll the Bones", for instance, exhibits funk and hip hop elements, and the instrumental track "Where's My Thing?" features several jazz components.Roll the Bones Allmusic:. Retrieved March 18, 2006. This return to three-piece instrumentation helped pave the way for future albums in the mid-90s, which would adopt a more straightforward rock formula.
The transition from synthesizers to more guitar-oriented and organic instrumentation continued with Counterparts (1993)Counterparts Review Allmusic Accessed April 18, 2007 [tpl]Wayback|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r188404|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|date =20070930041355|bot=DASHBot[/tpl] and its follow-up, Test for Echo (1996), again both produced in collaboration with Peter Collins. Musically, Counterparts and Test For Echo are two of Rush's most guitar-driven albums. Although the music in general did not meet the criteria for progressive rock, some songs adopted a dynamic format.Allmusic Test For Echo Review. Retrieved April 17, 2007. For instance, "Time and Motion" possesses multiple time signature changes and organ usage, while the instrumental track "Limbo", consists of multiple musical passages. Musically, Test For Echo still retained much of the hard rock/alternative style already charted on the previous record with Lifeson and Lee's playing remaining more or less unchanged; however, a distinct modification in technique became apparent in Peart's playing from his jazz and swing training under the tutelage of jazz instructor Freddie Gruber during the interim between Counterparts and Test For Echo.Neil Peart's tutelage Drummerworld. Retrieved April 18, 2007. In October 1996, in support of Test For Echo, the band embarked on a North American tour, the band's first without an opening act and dubbed "An Evening with Rush". The tour was broken up into two segments spanning October through December 1996 and May through July 1997 with the band taking a respite between tour legs.

===Hiatus and comeback (1997–2005)===

After wrapping up the tour promoting Test for Echo in 1997, the band entered a five-year hiatus primarily due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. Peart's daughter Selena died in an automobile accident in August 1997, followed by the death of his wife Jacqueline from cancer in June 1998. Peart took a hiatus to mourn and reflect, during which he traveled extensively throughout North America on his BMW motorcycle, covering [tpl]convert|88,000|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl]. At some point in his journey, Peart decided to return to the band. Peart wrote Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road as a chronicle of his geographical and emotional journey. In this book he writes of how he had told his bandmates at Selena's funeral, "consider me retired."Peart, Neil. Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road. Toronto: ECW Press. 2002. ISBN 1-55022-546-4 On November 10, 1998 a triple CD live album entitled Different Stages was released, dedicated to the memory of Selena and Jacqueline. Mixed by producer Paul Northfield and engineered by Terry Brown, it contained three discs packed with recorded performances from the band's Counterparts, Test For Echo, and A Farewell to Kings tours, marking the fourth officially released live album by the band.[tpl]cite web |last=Prato |first=Greg |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r380161|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Different Stages: Live - Rush |publisher=Allmusic |date= |accessdate= November 26, 2013[/tpl]

After a time to grieve and reassemble the pieces of his life, and while visiting long-time Rush photographer Andrew MacNaughtan in Los Angeles, Peart was introduced to his future wife, photographer Carrie Nuttall. Peart married Nuttall on September 9, 2000. In early 2001 he announced to his band mates that he was ready to once again enter the studio and get back into the business of making music. With the help of producer Paul Northfield the band returned in May 2002 with Vapor Trails, written and recorded in Toronto. To herald the band's comeback, the single and lead track from the album, "One Little Victory" was designed to grab the attention of listeners with its rapid guitar and drum tempos.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/VTnews.htm|title=Vapor Trails news archive|publisher=2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=March 16, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080616202159/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/VTnews.htm|archivedate=June 16, 2008[/tpl]  Vapor Trails marked the first studio recording not to include a single synthesizer, organ or keyboard part since the early 1970s. While the album is almost completely guitar-driven, it is mostly devoid of any conventional sounding guitar solos, a conscious decision made by Lifeson during the writing process. According to the band, the entire developmental process for Vapor Trails was extremely taxing and took approximately 14 months to finish, by far the longest the band had ever spent writing and recording a studio album. The album was supported by the band's first tour in six years, including first-ever concerts in Mexico City and Brazil, where they played to some of the largest crowds of their career.
A triple CD live album and dual DVD, Rush in Rio, was released in late October 2003 featuring an entire concert performance recorded on the last night of their Vapor Trails Tour, November 23, 2002, at Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

===Snakes & Arrows (2006–09)===

During promotional interviews for the R30 Live In Frankfurt DVD, the band revealed their intention to begin writing new material in early 2006. While in Toronto, Lifeson and Lee began the songwriting process in January 2006. During this time, Peart simultaneously assumed his role of lyric writing while residing in Southern California.

==Musical style and influences==

Rush's musical style has changed substantially over the years.

This fusion of heavy metal and progressive rock continued until the end of the 1970s. In the 1980s, Rush successfully merged their sound with the trends of this period, experimenting with New Wave, reggae and pop rock."Signals". Allmusic. Retrieved March 18, 2006. This period included the band's most extensive use of instruments such as synthesizers, sequencers, and electronic percussion. With the approach of the early '90s and Rush's characteristic sound still intact, the band transformed their style once again to harmonize with the alternative rock movement."Counterparts". Allmusic.

More than 40 years of activity has provided Rush with the opportunity for musical diversity across their discography. As with many bands known for experimentation, changes have inevitably resulted in dissent among critics and fans. The bulk of the band's music has always included synthetic instruments, and this has been a source of contention among fans and critics, especially the band's heavy reliance on synthesizers and keyboards during the 1980s, particularly on albums Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows, and Hold Your Fire."Grace Under Pressure".

===Geddy Lee===

Geddy Lee's high-register vocal style has always been a signature of the band – and sometimes a focal point for criticism, especially during the early years of Rush's career when Lee's vocals were high-pitched, with a strong likeness to other singers like Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin. A review in the New York Times opined that Lee's voice "suggests a munchkin giving a sermon."Pareles, Jon, A 20-Year-Old Band With Some New Tricks, The New York Times, March 10, 1994.

Lee is notable for his ability to operate various pieces of instrumentation simultaneously. This is most evident during live shows when Lee must play bass, supply lead vocals, manipulate keyboards, and trigger pedals during the course of a performance, as in the song "Tom Sawyer". Because of this, he is required to remain in one place during songs containing complex instrumentation. Lifeson and Peart are, to a lesser extent, responsible for similar actions during live shows.

During his adolescent years, he was influenced by Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page.Alex Lifeson profile Epiphone. Retrieved March 31, 2006. For versatility, Lifeson was known to incorporate touches of Spanish and classical music into Rush's guitar-driven sound during the 1970s. Taking a backseat to Lee's keyboards in the 1980s, Lifeson's guitar returned to the forefront in the 1990s, and especially on Vapor Trails (2002). During live performances, he is still responsible for cuing various guitar effects, the use of bass-pedal synthesizers and backing vocals.

===Neil Peart===

Peart has been voted the greatest rock drummer by music fans, critics and fellow musicians, according to Drummerworld.Neil Peart profile. Drummer World. Retrieved March 30, 2006.

Initially inspired by Keith Moon, Peart absorbed the influence of other rock drummers from the 1960s and 1970s such as Ginger Baker, Carmine Appice, and John Bonham.Anatomy of a Drum Solo DVD, Neil Peart (2005) accompanying booklet. (Republished in Modern Drummer Magazine, April 2006) Incorporation of unusual instruments (for rock drummers of the time) such as the glockenspiel and tubular bells, along with several standard kit elements, helped create a highly varied setup. Continually modified to this day, Peart's drumkit offers an enormous array of percussion instruments for sonic diversity. For two decades Peart honed his technique; each new Rush album introduced an expanded percussive vocabulary. In the 1990s, he reinvented his style with the help of drum coach Freddie Gruber.
Peart also serves as Rush's primary lyricist, attracting much attention over the years for his eclectic style. Known for penning concept suites and songs inspired by literature, music fan opinions of his writing have varied greatly, running the gamut from cerebral and insightful to pretentious and preachy. During the band's early years, Peart's lyrics were largely fantasy/science fiction-focused,Rush profile, John Mcferrin's Rock and Prog Reviews.

Despite completely dropping out of the public eye for five years after the gold-selling Test for Echo (which peaked at number 5 on the Billboard 200) and the band being relegated almost solely to classic rock stations in the U.S., Vapor Trails reached number 6 on the Billboard 200 chart in its first week of release in 2002 with 108,000 albums sold. It has sold approximately 343,000 units to date. The subsequent Vapor Trails tour grossed over $24 million and included the largest audience ever to see a headlining Rush show – 60,000 fans in São Paulo, Brazil. Nevertheless, Vapor Trails remains their first album not to achieve at least gold status in the United States.
However, Rush's triple CD live album, Rush in Rio (2003), was certified gold by the RIAA, marking the fourth decade in which a Rush album had been released and certified at least gold. Moreover, in 2004 Feedback cracked the top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart and received radio airplay. The band's 2007 album, Snakes & Arrows, debuted at number 3 (just one position shy of Rush's highest peaking albums, Counterparts (1993) and Clockwork Angels (2012), which both debuted at number 2) on the Billboard 200 selling approximately 93,000 its first week of release.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/News.htm|title=Snakes & Arrows chart rankings|publisher=2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=August 7, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927185503/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/News.htm|archivedate=September 9, 2007[/tpl] This marks the 13th studio album to appear in the Top 20 and the band's 27th album to appear on the chart regardless of position over the course of their career. The album also debuted at number 1 on the Billboard's Top Rock Albums chart, as well as peaking at number 1 on the Top Internet Albums chart when the album was released on the MVI format a month later.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/S&Anews.htm|title=Snakes and Arrows news page|publisher=2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=August 7, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822095019/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/S&Anews.htm|archivedate=August 22, 2008[/tpl] Still, Snakes & Arrows has yet to accumulate sales that approach or eclipse Vapor Trails or Rush in Rio.
The two consecutive tours in support of Snakes & Arrows in 2007 and 2008 accrued $21 million and $18.3 million, respectively, earning Rush the number 6 and 8 spots among the top ten summer rock concerts.[tpl]cite web|title=Midyear Music Biz Report Card: Top 10 Rock and Pop Tours|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/22026885/midyear_music_biz_report_card/3|publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine|accessdate=August 8, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090505141213/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/22026885/midyear_music_biz_report_card/3| archivedate= June 15, 2012[/tpl]Summer concert earnings USAToday.

==Live performances==

The members of Rush share a strong work ethic, desiring to accurately recreate songs from their albums when playing live performances. To achieve this goal, beginning in the late 1980s, Rush has included a capacious rack of digital samplers in their concert equipment to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, accompaniments, vocal harmonies, and other sound "events" in real-time to match the sounds on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members share duties throughout most songs. Each member has one or more MIDI controllers, which are loaded with different sounds for each song, and use available limbs to trigger the sounds while simultaneously playing their primary instrument(s).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|title=Rush Rolls Again|date=September 2002|publisher=OnStage Magazine|accessdate=December 18, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021018005414/http://onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|archivedate=October 18, 2002[/tpl] It is with this technology that the group is able to present their arrangements in a live setting with the level of complexity and fidelity fans have come to expect, and without the need to resort to the use of backing tracks or employing an additional band member.[tpl]cite web|url=http://2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900300backstageclub.htm|title=Backstage Club Newsletter|date=March 1990|publisher=2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=December 31, 2011[/tpl] The band members' coordinated use of pedal keyboards and other electronic triggers to "play" sampled instruments and audio events is subtly visible in their live performances, especially so on R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour, their 2005 concert DVD.
A staple of Rush's concerts is a Neil Peart drum solo. Peart's drum solos include a basic framework of routines connected by sections of improvisation, making each performance unique. Each successive tour sees the solo more advanced, with some routines dropped in favour of newer, more complex ones. Since the mid-1980s, Peart has used MIDI trigger pads to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area, such as a marimba, harp, temple blocks, triangles, glockenspiel, orchestra bells, tubular bells, and vibraslap as well as other, more esoteric percussion.

==Philanthropy==

Rush actively participates in philanthropic causes. The band was one of several hometown favourites to play Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto, also dubbed SARStock, at Downsview Park in Toronto on July 30, 2003, with an attendance of over half a million people. The concert was intended to benefit the Toronto economy after the SARS outbreaks earlier in the year.[tpl]cite web|title=RUSH - Tom Sawyer, Limelight and Dreamline - Live Toronto SARSfest 2003|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=82c_1322951593&comments=1|publisher=LiveLeak.com|accessdate=8 April 2012[/tpl] The band has also sustained an interest in promoting human rights. They donated $100,000 to the Canadian Museum for Human Rights after a concert they held in Winnipeg on May 24, 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfirst.ca/article/2008/05/29/rush_contribute_to_canadian_museum_for_human_rights|title=Rush Contribute to Canadian Museum for Human Rights|publisher=Winnipeg First|date=May 29, 2008|accessdate=July 25, 2008[/tpl] Rush continues to sell t-shirts and donate the proceeds to the museum.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2008/05/28/rush-cmhr.html?ref=rss|title=Rockers Rush donate cash to human rights museum|publisher=CBC News|date=May 28, 2008|accessdate=July 25, 2008[/tpl]
On July 24, 2013, Rush performed a benefit concert in Red Deer, Alberta, at the Enmax Centrium with all proceeds going to the Canadian Red Cross to help victims of the 2013 flooding that devastated many regions of southern Alberta. The original venue for the show, the Calgary Saddledome, was heavily damaged from the flooding and was unavailable for the concert date as originally planned.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rush.com/rush-to-perform-alberta-flood-relief-benefit-concert/ |title=To Perform Alberta Flood Relief Benefit Concert |publisher=RUSH |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-08-07[/tpl]

Rush has also been a big supporter of Little Kids Rock, a national nonprofit that works to restore and revitalize music education programs in disadvantaged U.S. public schools. They teamed up with Musician’s Friend and SABIAN to help Little Kids Rock provide percussion to public schools nationwide. They donated $500 of proceeds for every Neil Peart Paragon Cymbal Pack they sold, each of which came with a free splash cymbal personalized, autographed and dated by the Rush drummer himself. The cause-based marketing initiative raised over $50,000 for Little Kids Rock.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.littlekidsrock.org/friends/our-big-fans/rush/ |title=RUSH |publisher=Little Kids Rock |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19[/tpl]
