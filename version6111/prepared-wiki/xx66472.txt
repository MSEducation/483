Ashdod ([tpl]lang-he-n|אַשְׁדּוֹד[/tpl] [tpl]Audio|Ashdod.ogg|(audio)[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ar|اشدود[/tpl], إسدود Isdud) is the fifth-largest city in Israel, located in the Southern District of the country, on the Mediterranean coast, located 32 kilometres (20 mi) south of Tel Aviv, 20 km (12 mi) north of Ashkelon and 53 km (33 mi) west of Jerusalem. Ashdod is an important regional industrial center. The Port of Ashdod is Israel's largest port, accounting for 60% of the country's imported goods.
The first documented settlement in Ashdod dates to the Canaanite culture of 17th century BCE,[tpl]cite book|title=Ashdod – Seven levels of excavations|page=91|language=Hebrew|author=M. Dotan|publisher=Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, Ashdod branch|location=Israel|year=1990|id=ULI Sysno. 005093624 [/tpl] making the city one of the oldest in the world. Ashdod is mentioned 13 times in the Bible. During its history the city was settled by Philistines, Israelites, Byzantines, Crusaders and Arabs.[tpl]cite book|title=Events calendar in Israel and Ashdod|page=79|language=Hebrew|author=O.Kolani, B.Raanan, M.Brosh, S.Pipano|publisher=Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, Ashdod branch|location=Israel|year=1990|id=ULI Sysno. 005093624[/tpl]
Modern Ashdod was established in 1956 on the sand hills near the site of the ancient town, and incorporated as a city in 1968, with a land-area of approximately [tpl]convert|60|km2|sqmi[/tpl]. Being a planned city, expansion followed a main development plan, which facilitated traffic and prevented air pollution in the residential areas, despite population growth. According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, Ashdod had a population of 240,400 at the beginning of 2013, the sixth largest city in Israel,http://www.moin.gov.il/Subjects/Bchirot/Documents/num-member.pdf and had an area of [tpl]convert|47242|dunam|km2 sqmi[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/publications/local_authorities2005/pdf/108_0070.pdf|title=Local Authorities in Israel 2005, Publication #1295 – Municipality Profiles – Ashdod|publisher=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=April 14, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080529073224/http://www.cbs.gov.il/publications/local_authorities2005/pdf/108_0070.pdf| archivedate= 29 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] [tpl]he icon[/tpl]

==History==

===Antiquity===

The site of Ashdod in the Bronze Age and Iron Ages was at a tell just south of the modern city. It was excavated by archaeologists in nine seasons between 1962 and 1972. The effort the first few years was led by David Noel Freedman of the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary and Moshe Dothan.M. Dothan and David Noel Freedman, Ashdod I, The First Season of Excavations 1962, Atiqot, vol. 7, Israel Antiquities Authority, 1967David Noel Freedman, The Second Season at Ancient Ashdod, The Biblical Archaeologist, vol. 26, no. 4, pp. 134–139, 1963 The remaining seasons were under Dothan and the Israel Antiquities Authority.Moshe Dothan, Ashdod VI: The Excavations of Areas H and K (1968–1969) (Iaa Reports) (v. 6), Israel Antiquities Authority, 2005, ISBN 965-406-178-3
Human settlement in Ashdod dates from the Paleolithic Age. Ashdod is mentioned in documents written in Ugaritic, a language of ancient Canaan. At the end of the 13th century BCE the Sea Peoples conquered and destroyed Ashdod. By the beginning of the 12th century BC, the Philistines, generally thought to have been one of the Sea Peoples, ruled the city. During their reign, the city prospered and was a member of the Philistine pentapolis,[tpl]cite book|title=The Philistines |page=119|language=Hebrew|author=B.Frenkel|publisher=Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, Ashdod branch|location=Israel|year=1990|id=ULI Sysno. 005093624 [/tpl] which included Ashkelon, Ekron, Gath, and Gaza in addition to Ashdod.
In 950 BC Ashdod was destroyed during Pharaoh Siamun's conquest of the region. The city was not rebuilt until at least 815 BC. Around 715 BC, it was conquered by Sargon II,[tpl]Cite journal|title=Judah under Assyrian Hegemony: A Reexamination of Imperialism and Religion |pages=403–414|first=Mordechai |last=Cogan|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|volume=112|issue=3|year=1993|doi=10.2307/3267741|jstor=3267741|publisher=The Society of Biblical Literature|postscript=[/tpl] who destroyed the city and exiled its residents, including some Jews who were subsequently settled in Media and Elam.[tpl]cite web |first=Massoume |last=Price|publisher=Iran Chamber Society |title=A brief history of Iranian Jews |year=2001|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/religions/articles/history_of_iranian_jews1.php|accessdate=October 11, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070930181825/http://www.iranchamber.com/religions/articles/history_of_iranian_jews1.php| archivedate= 30 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Asdûdu led the revolt of Philistines, Judeans, Edomites, and Moabites against Assyria after expulsion of king Akhimeti, whom Sargon had installed instead of his brother Azuri. Gath (Gimtu) belonged to the kingdom of Ashdod at that time.[tpl]cite book|title=Yamani stronghold in Ashdod-Sea|page=125|language=Hebrew|author=J.

An Assyrian general Tartan gained control of Ashdod in 711,Isaiah 20:1[tpl]Cite journal |title=Philistia under Assyrian Rule |pages=86–102|author=H. Tadmor|journal=The Biblical Archaeologist|volume=29|issue=3|year=1966|doi=10.2307/3211004 |publisher=The American Schools of Oriental Research |postscript= |jstor=3211004[/tpl] and forced the "usurper" Yamani to flee. Mitinti was king at the time of Sennacherib, and Akhimilki in the reign of Esarhaddon. Psamtik I of Egypt is reported to have besieged the great city Azotus for twenty-nine years (Herodotus, ii. 157); the biblical references to the remnant of Ashdod (Jeremiah 25:20; cf Zephaniah 2:4) are interpreted as allusions to this event.
The city absorbed another blow in 605 BC, when Nebuchadnezzar conquered it. In 539 BC the city was rebuilt by the Persians, but was conquered in the wars of Alexander of Macedon.(Nehemiah 13:23)
In the Book of Nehemiah, the Ashdodites seem to represent the whole nation of the Philistines in the sixth century BC,at 13:23,24. the speech of Ashdod (which the younger generation of the Jews are described as adopting) would simply be the general Philistine dialect. Hugo Winckler explains the use of that name by the fact that Ashdod was the nearest of the Philistine cities to Jerusalem.[tpl]cite book|title=Geschichte Israels |page=224|authorlink=Hugo Wilckner|year=1898[/tpl]

====Biblical references====

Upon Joshua's conquest of the Promised Land, Ashdod was alloted to the Tribe of Judah (Book of Joshua 15:46).
In I Samuel 6:17 Ashdod is mentioned among the principal Philistine cities. After capturing the Ark of the covenant from the Israelites, the Philistines took it to Ashdod and placed it in the temple of Dagon. The next morning Dagon was found prostrate before the Ark; on being restored to his place, he was on the following morning again found prostrate and broken. The people of Ashdod were smitten with boils; a plague of mice was sent over the land (1 Samuel 6:5).[tpl]cite journal |author=Harris JC |title=The plague of Ashdod |url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/63/3/244|journal=Arch.

According to the Bible, during the 10th century BC Ashdod became, along with all the kingdom of Philistia, a patronage area of the Kingdom of Israel under the control of King David.
The capture of the city by King Uzziah of Judah shortly after 815 BC is mentioned within 2 Chronicles (26:6) and in the Book of Zechariah (9:6), speaking of the false Jews. In the Book of Isaiah (20:1), an Assyrian general named Tartan, sent by Sargon, gained control of Ashdod in 711.
In the Book of Nehemiah (13:23–24), some 5th century BC residents of Jerusalem are said to have married women from Ashdod, and half of the children of these unions were reportedly unable to understand Hebrew; instead, they spoke "the language of Ashdod".
The 1st century AD Book of Acts (8:40) refers to Azotus (the Hellenistic name of Ashdod) as the place in which Philip the Evangelist reappeared after he converted  the Ethiopian eunuch to Christianity.

===Hellenistic period===

The city prospered as Αzotus (Άζωτος) under the Hellenistic rule, until the Hasmonean Revolt. During the rebellion Judas Maccabeus arrived at its gates, but did not conquer it. He left it for his brother Jonathan, who conquered it in 147 BCE and destroyed the Temple of Dagon.[tpl]cite book|title=Battle of Ashdod (147BC)|page=135|language=Hebrew|author=S.Shapira|publisher=Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, Ashdod branch|location=Israel|year=1990|id=ULI Sysno. 005093624 [/tpl] According to Josephus (Antiquities of the Jews 13:15, volume 4), Alexander Jannæus possessed it. Pompey restored its independence by reconstructing its city walls, though it belonged to the dominion of Herod and Salome (Antiquities... 17:18, volume 9), and Vespasian had to later take it by force.
Despite its location four miles (6 km) from the coast, both Ptolemy and Josephus described it as a maritime city. This curious description may refer to Ashdod's control of a separate shore-edge harbor, called Azotus Paraliyus,[tpl]cite book|title=Ashdod Sea in Byzantic period|page=143|language=Hebrew|author=S.Piphano|publisher=Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, Ashdod branch|location=Israel|year=1990|id=ULI Sysno. 005093624 [/tpl] or Ashdod-Sea (Antiquities... 13:15, volume 4). The city's prominence continued until the 7th century, when  a citadel was built in Azotus Paraliyus as a stronghold against the Byzantine navy. To the west of the wooded height on which the city stands, traces of the ancient harbor Kal'at Al Mina can still be seen.

===Arab, Crusader and Mamluk periods===

Isdud came under Muslim rule in the seventh century. The geographer Ibn Khordadbeh referred to it as "Azdud,"  and described it as a postal station between al-Ramla and Gaza.Khalidi, 1992, p.110.

===Ottoman rule===

The location of the village on Via Maris enhanced the city's importance during the Ottoman rule. In 1596 CE, administrated by nahiya ("subdistrict") of Gaza under the liwa' ("district") of Gaza, the population of Ashdod numbered about 413.[tpl]cite book|author=A. Petersen|title=The Towns of Palestine under Muslim Rule AD 600–1600 |publisher=BAR International Series 1381|year=2005|page=133[/tpl] The villagers paid taxes on wheat, barley, sesame and fruit crops,  as well as goats and beehives.Hütteroth, Wolf-Dieter and Kamal Abdulfattah (1977), Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century. Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband 5. Erlangen, Germany: Vorstand der Fränkischen Geographischen Gesellschaft. p. 143. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.110.
In the late nineteenth century, Isdud was described as a village spread across the eastern slope of a low hill, covered with gardens. A ruined khan stood southwest of the village. Its houses were one-storey high with walls and enclosures built of adobe brick. There were two main sources of water: a pond and a masonry well. Both were surrounded by groves of date-palm and fig-trees.Conder and  Kitchener, SWP II, 1881, p.409. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 110-111.

===British Mandate===

During the Mandatory period, Isdud had two elementary schools; one for boys which was opened in 1922, and one for girls which started in 1942. By the mid-1940s the boy-school had 371 students, while the girl-school had 74.Khalidi, 1992, p.111.

===1948 war===

The village of Isdud was occupied by the Egyptian army on May 29, 1948 and became the Egyptians' northernmost position during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. While the Israelis failed to capture territory, and suffered heavy casualties, Egypt changed its strategy from offensive to defensive, thus halting their advance northwards.New York Times June 8, 1948 Egyptian and Israeli forces clashed in the surrounding area, with the Egyptians being unable to hold the Ad Halom bridge over the Lachish River. Israeli forces surrounded the town during Operation Pleshet, and shelled and bombed it from the air.[tpl]cite book|title=Battle Sites in the Land of Israel|page=24|language=Hebrew|publisher=Carta|location=Israel|year=2003|isbn=965-220-494-3|author=Yehudah Ṿalakh ...[/tpl] For three nights from 18 October the Israeli Air Force bombed Isdud and several other locations.Khalidi, 1992, p.112. Fearing encirclement, Egyptian forces retreated on October 28, 1948 and the majority of the residents fled. The 300 townspeople who remained were driven southwards by the Israel Defense Forces.[tpl]cite web |publisher=International Middle East media Center|title=From Isdud to Ashdod: One man's immigrant dream; another's refugee nightmare|date=April 13, 2006 |url=http://www.imemc.org/article/18022|accessdate=September 21, 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070926220630/http://www.imemc.org/article/18022| archivedate= 26 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]Benny Morris, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, Cambridge Press 2004 pp.471

===State of Israel===

In 1950, the moshavim of Sde Uziyahu and Shtulim were established to the east of Isdud, and in 1949 and 1953, Bnei Darom and Gan HaDarom were established north of Isdud. According to Khalidi, they were established on the village lands.Khalidi, 1992, 112-13.
The modern city of Ashdod was founded in 1956. On May 1, 1956, then finance minister Levi Eshkol approved the establishment of the city of Ashdod. "Ashdod Company Ltd.", a daughter company of City-Builders Company Ltd., was created for that purpose by Oved Ben-Ami and Philipp Klutznick.
The first settlers, twenty-two families of immigrants from Morocco arrived in November 1956,[tpl]cite book|title=Ashdod.

In July 1957, the government granted a [tpl]convert|24|km2|0|abbr=off[/tpl], approximately [tpl]convert|32|km|mi[/tpl] from Tel Aviv, to the Ashdod Company Ltd., for building the modern city of Ashdod. The building of the Eshkol A power station in Ashdod was completed in 1958 and included 3 units: 2 units of 50 megawatt, and one unit of 45 megawatt (with sea water desalination capabilities). The first settlers were 22 families from Morocco, followed by a small influx of Jews from Egypt.[tpl]cite web|last=Davis |first=Barry |url=http://www.jpost.com/Travel/Around-Israel/Ashdod-on-offer |title=Ashdod on offer | JPost | Israel News |publisher=JPost |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08[/tpl]

The building of the port of Ashdod began in April 1961. The port was inaugurated in November 1963, and was first utilized in November 1965, with the coming of the Swedish ship "Wiengelgad".
Large-scale growth of the city began in 1991, with the massive arrival of immigrants from the Soviet Union  and Ethiopia and infrastructure development. From 1990 to 2001 the city accepted more than 100,000 new inhabitants, a 150% growth.[tpl]cite web |publisher=The Center for Research and Information, Knesset|title=Data of population in the city of Ashdod|date=April 17, 2001 |url=http://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/docs/m00121.rtf|format=Word|accessdate=September 21, 2007|language=Hebrew| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070927215208/http://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/docs/m00121.rtf| archivedate= 27 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Urban development==

The modern city of Ashdod city was built outside the historic settlement site, on virgin sands. The development followed a main development plan.[tpl]cite web |publisher=The Society of Protection of Nature in Israel, Ashdod branch|title=Development Plan for city of Ashdod|year=2000 |url=http://www.geocities.com/parkholot3/mitaar.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071128094323/http://www.geocities.com/parkholot3/mitaar.pdf |archivedate=November 28, 2007|format=PDF [/tpl][tpl]he icon[/tpl] The planners divided the city into seventeen neighborhoods of ten to fifteen thousand people. Wide avenues between the neighborhoods make traffic flow relatively freely inside the city. Each neighborhood has access to its own commercial center, urban park, and health and education infrastructure. The original plan also called for a business and administrative center, built in the mid-1990s, when the city population grew rapidly more than doubling in ten years.
Three industrial zones were placed adjacent to the port in the northern part of the city, taking into account the prevailing southern winds which take air pollution away from the city.  The plan had its problems, however, including asymmetric growth of upscale and poorer neighborhoods and the long-time lack of a main business and administrative center.[tpl]cite book|title=New lineation plan to the city of Ashdod|page=29|language=Hebrew|author=J. Herz U. Fogel|publisher=Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, Ashdod branch|location=Israel|year=1990|id=ULI Sysno. 005093624 [/tpl]
The city was planned for a maximum of 250,000 inhabitants, and an additional area in the south was reserved for further development.
In 2012, a plan to build an industrial zone on part of the Ashdod Sand Dune was approved. The plan calls for a hi-tech industrial park, events halls, and coffee shops to be built adjacent to the train station. It will cover [tpl]convert|400|dunam|km2 sqmi|1[/tpl], including 130 dunams of built-up space, with the rest of the area being preserved as a nature reserve.[tpl]cite web|last=Rinat |first=Zafrir |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israeli-greens-up-in-arms-over-building-plans-on-last-stretch-of-major-sand-dunes.premium-1.485488 |title=Israeli greens up in arms over building plans on last stretch of major sand dunes Israel News | Haaretz Daily Newspaper |publisher=Haaretz.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Rinat |first=Zafrir |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/high-tech-and-banquets-creep-into-israel-s-last-surviving-dunes-1.449173 |title=High-tech and banquets creep into Israel's last surviving dunes Israel News | Haaretz Daily Newspaper |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2012-07-06 |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl] In addition, the Port of Ashdod is undergoing a massive expansion program,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dhvgroup.com/Projects/2011/Ashdod-port-expansion,-Israel?ui=/Markets/Water |title=Royal HaskoningDHV - Consultants, Project Managers and Engineers |publisher=Dhvgroup.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl] and a private hospital will be built in the city.[tpl]cite web|last=Even |first=Dan |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/despite-protests-new-israeli-hospital-in-ashdod-will-offer-private-medical-treatment-1.458521 |title=Despite protests, new Israeli hospital in Ashdod will offer private medical treatment Israel News | Haaretz Daily Newspaper |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl]

==Geography==

The Ashdod-Nitzanim sand dune nature reserve is a 20-kilometer (12-mile) stretch of sand dunes on the southern outskirts of Ashdod.

==Climate==

Ashdod has a Mediterranean climate with hot summers, pleasant spring and fall, and cool, rainy winters. As a seaside town, the humidity tends to be high many times year round, and rain occurs mainly from November to March. In winter, temperatures seldom drop below [tpl]convert|5|C|0[/tpl] and are more likely to be in the range of [tpl]convert|10|-|15|C|F|0[/tpl], while in summer the average is [tpl]convert|27|C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The average annual rainfall is [tpl]convert|510|mm|abbr=on[/tpl].
 

==Economy==

Ashdod is one of the most important industrial centers in Israel. All industrial activities in the city are located in northern areas such as the port area, the northern industrial zone, and around the Lachish River. The port of Ashdod is the largest port in Israel, handling about 60% of Israel's port cargo. It was mainly upgraded in recent years and will be able to provide berths for Panamax ships. Various shipping companies offices are also located in the port area which also is home to an Eshkol A power station and coal terminal.
The Northern industrial zone is located on Highway 41 and includes various industry including an oil refinery, which is one of only two in the country. The heavy industry zone located south of the Lachish River was once the main industrial center in Ashdod. Recently, however, leisure facilities have moved into the area. There is still some industry here, however, such as a Teva Pharmaceutical Industries plant, construction components producer Ashtrom, and Solbar a soybean oil producer. Ashdod is also home to Elta, a part of Israel Aircraft Industries where radar equipment, electronic warfare systems, and ELINT are developed.
Historically each neighborhood of Ashdod had its own commercial center. In 1990, however, when the mall shopping culture developed in Israel, the main commercial activity in Ashdod moved to malls. The first mall to open in Ashdod was the Forum Center in the industrial zone. Restaurants, bars and night clubs were opened in the area. Today, the Forum center is mainly used for offices. Lev Ashdod Mall, which opened in 1993, has been enlarged and upgraded since then.[tpl]cite web |last=kenyonim.com|title=Lev Ashdod Mall|url=http://www.kenyonim.com/mall.asp?mid=11[/tpl] [tpl]he icon[/tpl] Ashdod Mall, billed at the time as the city's largest shopping mall, has also been redesigned since its opening in 1995.[tpl]cite web |last=Ashdod News|title=Ashdod Mall closed its gates|date=December 1, 2005 |url=http://www.ashdodnews.co.il/economic_p2.asp?page_id=107&page_id_2=4286|accessdate=September 29, 2007[/tpl] [tpl]he icon[/tpl] City Mall, Ashdod was opened in a combined building with the central bus station in 1996,[tpl]cite web |last=kenyonim.com|title=City Mall, Ashdod|url=http://www.kenyonim.com/mall.asp?mid=58[/tpl] [tpl]he icon[/tpl] following the examples of the Tel Aviv Central Bus Station and the Jerusalem Central Bus Station.

==Education==

In 2013, Ashdod had 500 schools employing 3,500 teachers. The student population was 55,000. The city's education budget was NIS 418 million shekels.

==Transportation==

===Road===

Ashdod is located on the historic Via Maris. Highway 4 was developed following this route along the southern sea shore of Israel; it serves as the main connection to the north, towards the Tel Aviv metropolitan area, and to the south, towards Ashkelon.Ad Halom junction was planned as the main entrance to the city from the east.
Ashdod Interchange was opened in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3721041,00.html|title=Ad Halom interchange was opened|date=May 26, 2009|publisher=MYnet|accessdate=August 21, 2009[/tpl]
The interchange continues the freeway section of Highway 4 further south, by removing the traffic light at this junction, and also added grade separation with the railway.  The other main road in the area is Highway 41 which served the city from the start of its modern history. This road runs from west to east towards Gedera and it is the main transport link to the port of Ashdod and the industrial zones, and connects to Highway 4 with an interchange.
In late 2012, Ashdod won a NIS 220 million grant from the Israeli Transport Ministry to improve public transportation and decrease private car use. According to the municipality's plans, a 20-kilometer ring of road arteries will be given priority in public transportation. These arteries will carry four bus rapid transit lines.

===Buses===

A new central bus station opened in 1996. It serves as the terminus both for inter- and intracity lines. The central bus station is attached to the City Mall.  Intercity bus lines connect the city with most population centers in central and southern Israel. Following is the list of bus companies serving routes at the central bus station:
Due to the large Haredi population in Ashdod, many mehadrin lines connect the Haredi neighborhoods of Ashdod with other Haredi population centers, such as Bnei Brak, Jerusalem, Bet Shemesh, Modi'in Illit, Kiryat Gat, El'ad, Tzfat and other towns. The mehadrin lines are operated by Egged, Connex, Egged Ta'avura and Superbus, and do not use the central bus station.
The Egged Ta'avura company has been operating urban buses in Ashdod since 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.egged-taavura.co.il/p-62/|title=List of intracity lines in Ashdod|publisher=Egged Ta'avura|accessdate=November 23, 2008| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822090919/http://www.egged-taavura.co.il/p-62/| archivedate = August 22, 2008[/tpl] [tpl]he icon[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=New lines of public transportation |date=September 19, 2005 |work=Ashdod4u.com |url=http://www.ashdod4u.com/ArticlePrint.asp?ArticleID=4204 |accessdate=November 26, 2008[/tpl] [tpl]he icon[/tpl]  In addition, a share taxi service exists in Ashdod, operated by Moniyot HaIr.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taxi-city.co.il/?page=track|title=List of share taxi lines operated by Moniyot HaIr|publisher=Moniyot HaIr|accessdate=November 27, 2008[/tpl] [tpl]he icon[/tpl]  Most share taxi lines coincide with intracity bus lines.

In the 1960s Ashdod accepted a large number of immigrants from Romania, followed by a large number from Georgia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the 1970s. More than 60,000 Russian Jews from the former Soviet Union who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union settled in Ashdod. Recent demographic figures suggest that about 32%[tpl]cite web |last=Ashdod Municipality|title=Absorption and immigration|url=http://www.ashdod.muni.il/htmls/english/Openning_eng.asp[/tpl] of the city's population are new immigrants, 85% of whom are originally from the former Soviet Union.

Many of the 60,000 Marathi-speaking Bene Israel from Maharashtra, India who moved to Israel also settled there. Ashdod also receives a significant amount of internal migration,[tpl]cite web |last=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics |title=Internal migration in Israel|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/publications/in_migration02/pdf/e_print.pdf|issn = 0793-5382|format=PDF[/tpl] especially from the Gush Dan region.
