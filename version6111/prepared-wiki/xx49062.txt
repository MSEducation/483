About 23:00 on August 26, 1776, the first shots of the Battle of Long Island were fired near the Red Lion Inn (near present-day 39th St. and 4th Ave.). American pickets - part of Samuel John Atlee's Pennsylvania regiment - fired upon two British soldiers who were foraging in a watermelon patch near the Red Lion.History of the City of Brooklyn By Henry Stiles. p.269 (1867)
Around 01:00 on August 27, the British approached the vicinity of the Red Lion with between 200–300 troops. The American troops fired upon the British and after approximately two fusillades fled up the Gowanus Road toward the Vechte-Cortelyou House. Major Edward Burd who had been in command was captured along with a lieutenant and 15 privates.John J. Gallagher: Battle Of Brooklyn 1776 p.33 This first engagement was fought in the vicinity of 38–39 streets between 2nd. and 3rd. avenues near a swamp located adjacent to the Gowanus Road.
Newly promoted Brigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons a lawyer from Connecticut who had recently secured a commission in the Continental Army, and Colonel Samuel Atlee in command of the First Regiment of Pennsylvania Musketry - a veteran of the French and Indian War - were stationed further north on the Gowanus Road. Putnam had been awakened by a guard at 03:00 and told that the British were attacking through the Gowanus Pass.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=171[/tpl]. Putnam lit signals to Washington who was on Manhattan and then rode south to warn Stirling of the attack.[tpl]Harvnb|Lengel|2005|p=143[/tpl].
Stirling led two units of Colonel John Haslet's, 1st Delaware Regiment under the immediate command of Major Thomas Macdonough, and Colonel William Smallwood's 1st Maryland Infantry under the immediate command of Major Mordecai Gist - both Haslet and Smallwood were on courts-martial duty in Manhattan. Following close behind were Parson's Connecticut regiment with 251 men. Stirling led this combined force to reinforce Parsons and Atlee and stop the British advance. Stirling had a total of 1,600 troops at his command.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Stirling placed Atlee's men in an apple-orchard owned by Wynant Bennett on the southside of the Gowanus Road near present-day 3rd Avenue and 18 Street.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] Upon the approach of the British:
 We took possession of a hill about two miles from camp, and detached Colonel Atlee to meet them further on the road; in about sixty rods he drew up and received the enemy's fire and gave them a well-directed fire from his regiment, which did great execution, and then retreated to the hill.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] - General Parsons 
Stirling along with the Delaware and Maryland regiments took up positions just to the north Of Atlee's men on the slopes of a rise of land between 18 and 20 streets. Some of the Maryland troops were positioned on a small hill - called Blokje Berg (Dutch: cube or block hill) by the local Dutch–near 23 Street. At the base of this hill the Gowanus Road crossed a small bridge over a drainage ditch which drained a marshy area. When the British advanced up the Gowanus Road the American troops fired upon them from positions on the north side of the ditch. To the left were Colonel Peter Kachline's Pennsylvania regiment.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Just to the southeast of Blokje Berg were a few hills, amongst them was a hill which is the highest point in King's County at 220 feet which came to be known as Battle Hill–in what is today Greenwood Cemetery by the cemetery's boundary of 23 Street and Seventh Avenue. The British attempted to outflank the American positions by taking this hill. The Americans trying to prevent the British move also sent troops under Parsons and Atlee to take the hill. The British got there first but the Americans were able to dislodge them in fierce fighting.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Battle Hill was the site of especially brutal fighting, with the Americans inflicting the highest number of casualties against the British troops during the entire Battle of Long Island. Among those killed was British Colonel James Grant, which led the Americans to erroneously believe that they had killed General James Grant. He was alleged to have been shot by a Pennsylvanian rifleman who had been sniping at the British from up in a tree. Amongst the American dead was Pennsylvanian Colonel Caleb Parry who was killed while rallying his troops.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
In part due to the ferocity of the fighting and the number of British troops engaged, the Americans were still unaware that this was not the main British attack.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=172[/tpl].

===Battle Pass===

The Hessians, in the center under the command of General von Heister, began to bombard the American lines stationed at Battle Pass under the command of General John Sullivan.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|p=173[/tpl]. The Hessian brigades, waiting for the pre-arranged signal from the British, who at that time were in the process of outflanking the American lines did not attack. The Americans, still under the assumption that Grant's attack up the Gowanus Road was the main thrust had Sullivan send four hundred of his men to reinforce Stirling.
Howe fired his signal guns at 09:00 and the Hessians began to attack up Battle Pass while the main army came at Sullivan from the rear. Sullivan left his advance guard to hold off the Hessians while he turned the rest of his force around to fight the British. Heavy casualties mounted up between the Americans and the British and men on both sides fled out of fear. Sullivan attempted to calm his men and tried to lead a retreat. By this point the Hessians had overrun the advance guard on the heights and the American left had completely collapsed.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=174[/tpl]. Hand-to-hand fighting followed with the Americans swinging their muskets and rifles like clubs to save their lives. Many of the Americans who surrendered were bayoneted by the Hessians.[tpl]Harvnb|Lengel|2005|p=145[/tpl]. Sullivan, despite the chaos, managed to evacuate most of his men to Brooklyn Heights though Sullivan himself was captured.

===The Old Stone House/Vechte-Cortelyou House===

At 09:00, Washington arrived from Manhattan.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=175[/tpl]. Washington realized that he had been wrong about a feint on Long Island and he ordered more troops to Brooklyn from Manhattan. Washington's location on the battlefield is not known for sure, because accounts differ, but most likely he was at Brooklyn Heights where he could view the battle.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=176[/tpl].
On the American right, to the west, Stirling still held the line against Grant. Stirling held on for four hours, still unaware of the British flanking maneuver, and some of his own troops thought they were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. However, by 11:00, Grant, reinforced by 2,000 marines, hit Stirling's center and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians. Stirling pulled back but British troops were, at this point, coming at him in his rear south down the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across a Brouwer' Millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, on the other side of which was Brooklyn Heights.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=177[/tpl].

====Maryland 400====

Stirling ordered all of his troops, except a contingent of Maryland troops under the command of Major Mordecai Gist, to cross the creek. This group of Maryland troops became known to history as the Maryland 400, although they numbered about 260–270 men. Stirling and Gist led the troops in a rear-guard action against the overwhelming numbers of British troops which surpassed 2,000 troops supported by two cannon. Stirling and Gist led the Marylanders in two attacks against the British who were in fixed positions in and in front of the Vechte-Cortelyou House (known today as Old Stone House). After the last assault the remaining troops retreated across the Gowanus Creek. Some of the men who tried to cross the marsh were bogged down in the mud under musket fire and others who could not swim were captured. Stirling was surrounded and, unwilling to surrender to the British, broke through the British lines to von Heister's Hessians and surrendered to them. 256 Maryland troops were killed in the assaults in front of the Old Stone House and fewer then a dozen made it back to the American lines.[tpl]Harvnb|Lengel|2005|p=146[/tpl]. Washington, watching from a redoubt on nearby Cobble Hill (intersection of today's Court Street and Atlantic Avenue), was to have said, "Good God, what brave fellows I must this day lose!".[ref]
The 256 dead troops of the Maryland 400 were buried by the British in a mass grave on a hillock on farmer Adrian Van Brunt's land on the outskirts of the marsh. It was from this battle that Maryland gained its nickname "The Old Line State". This mass grave is believed to be around the southwest corner of what is today 3rd Ave. between 7th and 8th Streets.

===Disengagement===

After those American troops not killed or captured escaped behind the fortified American positions centered on Brooklyn Heights. Howe, in a move considered controversial to this day, ordered all of his troops to halt the attack, despite the protestations of many of the officers in his command who believed that they should push on to Brooklyn Heights. Howe had decided against a direct frontal assault against the entrenched American positions choosing instead to begin a siege and setting up lines of circumvallation around the American positions who he believed to be essentially trapped with his troops blocking escape by land and the Royal Navy in control of the East River which they would have to cross to reach Manhattan Island.
Howe's failure to press the attack, and the reasons for it, have been disputed. He may have wished to avoid the casualties his army suffered when attacking the Continentals under similar circumstances at the Battle of Bunker Hill.[tpl]Harvnb|Fischer|2006|p=99[/tpl]. He may also, in the European gentleman-officer tradition, have been giving Washington an opportunity to conclude his position was hopeless and surrender. Howe told Parliament in 1779 that his essential duty was to avoid excessive British casualties for insufficient purpose, and capturing Brooklyn Heights would likely not have meant capturing the entire American army. "The loss of 1000, or perhaps 1500 British troops, in carrying those lines, would have been but ill repaid by double that number of the enemy, could it have been supposed they would have suffered in that proportion."

==Aftermath==

===Retreat to Manhattan===

Washington and the army were surrounded on Brooklyn Heights with the East River to their backs.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=182[/tpl]. As the day went on, the British began to dig trenches, slowly coming closer and closer to the American defenses. By doing this, the British would not have to cross over open ground to assault the American defenses as they did in Boston the year before.[tpl]Harvnb|Lengel|2005|p=148[/tpl]. Despite this perilous situation, Washington ordered 1,200 more men from Manhattan to Brooklyn on August 28. The men that came over were two Pennsylvania regiments and Colonel John Glover's regiment from Marblehead, Massachusetts. In command of the Pennsylvania troops was Thomas Mifflin who, after arriving, volunteered to inspect the outer defenses and report back to Washington.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=183[/tpl]. In these outer defenses, small skirmishes were still taking place. On the afternoon of August 28, it began to rain and Washington had his cannon bombard the British well into the night.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=184[/tpl].
As the rain continued Washington sent a letter instructing General William Heath, who was at Kings Bridge between Manhattan and what is now the Bronx, to send every flat bottomed boat or sloop without delay in case battalions of infantry from New Jersey might come to reinforce their position.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=185[/tpl]. At 16:00, on August 29, Washington held a meeting with his generals. Mifflin advised Washington to retreat to Manhattan while Mifflin and his Pennsylvania Regiments made up the rear guard, holding the line until the rest of the army had withdrawn. The Generals agreed unanimously with Mifflin that retreat was the best option and Washington had orders go out by the evening.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=186[/tpl].
The troops were told that they were to gather up all their ammunition and baggage and prepare for a night attack. By 21:00, the sick and wounded began to move to the Brooklyn Ferry in preparation for being evacuated. At 23:00, Glover and his Massachusetts troops, who were sailors and fishermen, began to evacuate the troops.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=188[/tpl].
As more troops were evacuated, more troops were ordered to withdraw from the lines and march to the ferry landing. Wagon wheels were muffled, and men were forbidden to talk. Mifflin's rear guard was tending campfires to deceive the British and convince them that nothing was going on. At 04:00, on August 30, Mifflin was informed that it was his unit's turn to evacuate.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=189[/tpl]. Mifflin told the man who had been sent to order him to leave, Major Alexander Scammell, that he must be mistaken, but Scammell insisted that he was not and Mifflin ordered his troops to move out. When Mifflin's troops were within a half mile of the ferry landing Washington rode up and demanded to know why they were not at their defenses. Edward Hand, who was leading the troops, tried to explain what had happened, but Mifflin arrived shortly.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=190[/tpl]. Washington exclaimed "Good God! General Mifflin, I am afraid you have ruined us!" Mifflin explained that he had been told that it was his turn to evacuate by Scammell; Washington told him it had been a mistake. Mifflin then led his troops back to the outer defenses.
Artillery, supplies, and troops were all being evacuated across the river at this time but it was not going as fast as Washington had anticipated and daybreak soon came. A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there did not seem to be any American pickets and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=191[/tpl]. All 9,000 troops had been evacuated without a single life lost.

===Conclusion of the Campaign===

The British were stunned to find that Washington and the army had escaped. The next day, August 30, the British troops occupied the American fortifications. When news of the battle reached London, it caused many festivities to take place.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=195[/tpl]. Bells were rung across the city, candles were lit in windows and King George III gave General Howe the Order of the Bath.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=196[/tpl].
Washington's defeat revealed his deficiencies as a strategist who split his forces, his inexperienced generals who misunderstood the situation, and his raw troops that fled in disorder at the first shots.Charles Francis Adams, "The Battle of Long Island," American Historical Review Vol. 1, No. 4 (Jul. 1896), pp. 650-670 in JSTOR On the other hand his daring nighttime retreat has been seen by some historians as one of his greatest military feats.David McCullough, 1776 (2005). ISBN 978-0-7432-2671-4 Other historians concentrate on the failure of British naval forces to prevent the withdrawal.William L. Calderhead, "British Naval Failure at Long Island: A Lost Opportunity in the American Revolution," New York History, July 1976, Vol. 57 Issue 3, pp 321-338
General Howe remained inactive for the next half month, not attacking until September 15 when he landed a force at Kip's Bay.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=209[/tpl]. The British quickly occupied the city. On September 21, a fire of uncertain origin destroyed a quarter of New York City. In the immediate aftermath of the fire Nathan Hale was executed for spying. Although the Continentals were able to mount a victory at Harlem Heights in mid-September, Howe defeated Washington in battle again at White Plains and then again at Fort Washington.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=244[/tpl] Because of these defeats, Washington and the army retreated across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=262[/tpl].

===Casualties===

At the time, it was by far the largest battle ever fought in North America. If the Royal Navy is included, over 40,000 men took part in the battle. Howe reported his losses as 59 killed, 268 wounded and 31 missing. The Hessian casualties were 5 killed and 26 wounded.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=179[/tpl] The Americans suffered much heavier losses. About 300 had been killed and over 1,000 captured.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=180[/tpl] As few as half of the prisoners survived. Kept on prison ships, then transferred to locations such as the Middle Dutch Church, they were starved and denied medical attention. In their weakened condition, many succumbed to smallpox.[tpl]rp|191[/tpl]

==Legacy==

The most significant legacy of the Battle of Long Island was that it showed there would be no easy victory, and that the war would be long and bloody.[tpl]rp|2[/tpl]
