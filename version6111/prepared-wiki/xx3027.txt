==History==

Eugene is named after its founder, Eugene Franklin Skinner. Until 1889, it was named Eugene City.[tpl]cite news|last=Terry|first=John|title=Founder's wife suggests unique name for city of Eugene|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=September 4, 2010|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/O/index.ssf/2010/09/founders_wife_suggests_unique.html|accessdate=August 25, 2013[/tpl]   In 1846, Skinner erected the first cabin in the area.http://www.lanecountyhistoricalsociety.org/research-photocatalog.html It was used as a trading post and was registered as an official post office on January 8, 1850. At this time the settlement was known as Skinner's Mudhole. It was relocated in 1853 and named Eugene City,[tpl]cite web|title=Eugene|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195036/Eugene|work=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=August 25, 2013[/tpl]  but was not formally incorporated as a city until 1862. Skinner later ran a ferry service across the Willamette River where the Ferry Street Bridge now stands.
The first major educational institution in the area was Columbia College, founded a few years earlier than the University of Oregon. It fell victim to two major fires in four years, and after the second fire, the college decided not to rebuild again. The part of south Eugene known as College Hill was the former location of Columbia College. There is no college there today.
The town raised the initial funding to start a public university, which later became the University of Oregon, with the hope of turning the small town into a center of learning. In 1872, the Legislative Assembly passed a bill creating the University of Oregon as a state institution. Eugene bested the nearby town of Albany in the competition for the state university. In 1873, community member J.H.D. Henderson donated the hilltop land for the campus, overlooking the city.
The university first opened in 1876 with the regents electing the first faculty and naming John Wesley Johnson as president. The first students registered on October 16, 1876. The first building was completed in 1877; it was named Deady Hall in honor of the first Board of Regents President and community leader Judge Matthew P. Deady. The city's name was shortened from Eugene City to Eugene in 1889.
Eugene grew rapidly throughout most of the twentieth century, with the exception being the early 1980s when a downturn in the timber industry caused high unemployment. By 1985, the industry had recovered and Eugene began to attract more high-tech industries.

==Geography and climate==

===Geography===

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|43.74|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl], of which, [tpl]convert|43.72|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|0.02|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is water.[tpl]cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=December 21, 2012[/tpl] Eugene is located at an elevation of [tpl]convert|426|ft|0[/tpl].
To the north of downtown is Skinner Butte. Northeast of the city are the Coburg Hills. Spencer Butte is a prominent landmark south of the city. Mount Pisgah is southeast of Eugene and includes Mount Pisgah Arboretum and Howard Buford Recreation Area, a Lane County Park. Eugene is surrounded by foothills and forests to the south, east and west, while to the north the land levels out into the Willamette Valley and consists of mostly farmland.
The Willamette and McKenzie rivers run through Eugene and neighboring city, Springfield. Another important stream is Amazon Creek, whose headwaters are near Spencer Butte. The creek discharges into Fern Ridge Reservoir west of the city.

====Neighborhoods====

Eugene has 23 neighborhood associations:

===Climate===

Like the rest of the Willamette Valley, Eugene lies in the Marine West Coast climate zone (Köppen Csb), with Mediterranean characteristics. Temperatures can vary from cool to warm, with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Spring and fall are also moist seasons, with light rain falling for long periods. Winter snowfall does occur, but it is sporadic and rarely accumulates in large amounts: the average seasonal amount is [tpl]convert|5|in|cm|1[/tpl], and the median is 0. The record snowfall was 3 ft deep due to a pineapple express in late January 1969. Record snowfall for March was 8 inches deep in 2012.name = 'A truly historic "spring" snowstorm for Eugene ' The hottest months are July and August, with average highs of around [tpl]convert|82|°F|0[/tpl], with an average of 15 days per year above [tpl]convert|90|°F|1[/tpl]. The coolest month is December, with the average daytime high in the mid-40s°F (7–8 °C), and nights averaging just above freezing. There are 54 nights per year with a low below freezing, and about three days with highs not exceeding freezing. The record high low was [tpl]convert|73|°F|°C|abbr=on[/tpl] in 2006.
Eugene's average annual temperature is [tpl]convert|52.1|°F|1[/tpl], and annual precipitation at [tpl]convert|50.9|in|mm|sigfig=3[/tpl]. Eugene is slightly cooler on average than Portland. Despite being located about [tpl]convert|100|mi|sigfig=2[/tpl] south and having only a slightly higher elevation, Eugene has a more continental climate, less subject to the maritime air that blows inland from the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia River. Eugene's average August low is [tpl]convert|50.8|°F|1[/tpl], while Portland's average August low is [tpl]convert|56.5|°F|1[/tpl]. Average winter temperatures (and summer high temperatures) are similar for the two cities. This disparity may be additionally caused by Portland's urban heat island, where the combination of black pavement and urban energy use raises nighttime temperatures. A lesser heat island may also exist in the immediate downtown of Eugene.
Extreme temperatures range from [tpl]convert|-12|°F|°C|abbr=on[/tpl], recorded on December 8, 1972,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/daily/97404?climoMonth=12|title=December Daily Averages for Eugene, OR (97404)|publisher=weather.com|accessdate=December 2, 2011[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|108|°F|°C|abbr=on[/tpl] on August 9, 1981.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/daily/97404?climoMonth=8|title=August Daily Averages for Eugene, OR (97404)|publisher=weather.com|accessdate=December 2, 2011[/tpl]

===Religion===

Religious institutions of higher learning in Eugene include Northwest Christian University and New Hope Christian College. Northwest Christian University (formerly Northwest Christian College), founded in 1895, has ties with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). New Hope Christian College (formerly Eugene Bible College) originated with the Bible Standard Conference in 1919, which joined with Open Bible Evangelistic Association to create Open Bible Standard Churches in 1932. Eugene Bible College was started from this movement by Fred Hornshuh in 1925.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Open Bible Churches|title=Discover Open Bible Churches|url=http://www.openbible.org/about_discover.aspx|accessdate=August 11, 2011[/tpl]

The 340-member congregation of the Unitarian Universalist Church in Eugene (UUCE) purchased the former Eugene Scottish Rite Temple in May 2010.

===Community===

Eugene is noted for its "community inventiveness." Many U.S. trends in community development originated here. The University of Oregon's participatory planning process, known as The Oregon Experiment, was the result of student protests in the early 1970s. The book of the same name is a major document in modern enlightenment thinking in planning and architectural circles. The process, still used by the university in modified form, was created by Christopher Alexander, whose works also directly inspired the creation of the Wiki. Some of the research for the book A Pattern Language, which inspired the Design Patterns movement and Extreme Programming, was done by Alexander in Eugene. Not coincidentally, those engineering movements also had origins here. A Pattern Language is the best-selling book on architecture and planning of all time.
In the 1970s, Eugene was packed with cooperative and community projects. It still has small natural food stores in many neighborhoods, some of the oldest student cooperatives in the country, and alternative schools have been part of the school district since 1971. The old Grower's Market, downtown near the Amtrak depot, is the only food cooperative in the U.S. with no employees. It is possible to see Eugene's trend-setting non-profit tendencies in much newer projects, such as the Tango Center and the Center for Appropriate Transport. In 2006, an initiative began to create a tenant-run development process for downtown Eugene.
In the fall of 2003, neighbors noticed that "an unassuming two-acre remnant orchard tucked into the Friendly Area Neighborhood"[tpl]Cite news|first=Jessica|last=Hirst|title=Madison Meadow Saved|work=Eugene Weekly|date=December 18|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2008/12/18/news.html[/tpl] had been put up for sale by its owner, a resident of New York City.[tpl]Cite news|first=Edward|last=Russo|title= Clock ticking on Madison Meadow|work=The Register-Guard|date=April 5, 2007|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/registerguard/access/1250950201.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+5%2C+2007&author=Edward+Russo+The+Register-Guard&pub=The+Register+-+Guard&edition=&startpage=C.1&desc=Clock+ticking+on+Madison+Meadow|accessdate=August 1, 2009|page=C1[/tpl] Learning that a prospective buyer had plans to build several houses on the property, they formed a nonprofit organization called Madison Meadow[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.madisonmeadow.org|title=Madison Meadow|publisher=Madison Meadow|date=April 17, 2008|accessdate=November 13, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taxexemptworld.com/organizations/eugene_or_97405.asp|title=Eugene OR 97405- Tax Exempt Organizations and 97405 Eugene Oregon Non Profit Organizations|publisher=Taxexemptworld.com|date=August 21, 2012|accessdate=November 13, 2012[/tpl] in June 2004 in order to buy the property and "preserve it as undeveloped space in perpetuity."

The City of Eugene has an active Neighborhood Program. Several neighborhoods are known for their green activism. Friendly Neighborhood has a highly popular neighborhood garden established on the right of way of a street never built. There are a number of community gardens on public property. Amazon Neighborhood has a former church turned into a community center. Whiteaker hosts a housing co-op that dates from the early 70's that has repurposed both their parking lots into food production and play space. An unusual eco village with natural building techniques and large shared garden can be found in Jefferson Westside neighborhood. A several block area in the River Road Neighborhood is known as a Permaculture hotspot with an increasing number of suburban homes trading grass for garden, installing rain water catchment systems and food producing landscapes and solar retrofits. Several sites have planted gardens by removing driveways. A 65 tree filbert grove on public property is being restored by citizen volunteers in cooperation with the city of Eugene. There are deepening social and economic networks in the neighborhood.

====Anarchism====

During the late 1990s and early years of the 2000s, Eugene contained a community of anarchists situated in the Whiteaker neighborhood of west Eugene. This community gained international notoriety in 1999, due to its perceived role in the protests at the WTO Conference in Seattle that year.[tpl]Cite news|first = Kera|last = Abraham|title = Flames of Dissent|newspaper = Eugene Weekly|date = November 22, 2006|url = http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/11/22/coverstory.html|accessdate = June 10, 2007[/tpl] Following those protests, then-mayor Jim Torrey described the city as "the anarchist capital of the United States."
