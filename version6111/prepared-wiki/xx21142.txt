==Controversy==

==Anonymous involvement==

 In August of 2012 a group in the Anonymous irc channel #OpAlgeria started an operation against the ARPT (Autorite postal et telecommunication). This operation was started because the ARPT made a decision to require authorization of its users before allowing them to use any kind of encryption (for example; IpSec). They also will require authorization for any type of Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology (for example; PPTP, L2TP, GRE Tunneling, OpenVPN, and most other protocols that allow you protect your information).
