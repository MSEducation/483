Aretha Louise Franklin (born March 25, 1942) is an American singer and musician. Franklin began her career singing gospel at her father, minister C. L. Franklin's church as a child. In 1960, at age 18, Franklin embarked on a secular career, recording for Columbia Records only achieving modest success. Following her signing to Atlantic Records in 1967, Franklin achieved commercial acclaim and success with songs such as "Respect", "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" and "Think". These hits and more helped her to gain the title The Queen of Soul by the end of the 1960s decade.
Franklin eventually recorded a total of 88 charted singles on Billboard, including 77 Hot 100 entries and twenty number-one R&B singles, becoming the most charted female artist in the chart's history. Franklin also recorded acclaimed albums such as I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You, Lady Soul, Young, Gifted & Black and Amazing Grace before experiencing problems with her record company by the mid-1970s. After her father was shot in 1979, Franklin left Atlantic and signed with Arista Records, finding success with a cameo appearance in the film, The Blues Brothers and with the albums, Jump to It and Who's Zoomin' Who?. In 1998, Franklin won international acclaim for singing the opera aria, "Nessun Dorma", at the Grammys of that year replacing Luciano Pavarotti. Later that same year, she scored her final Top 40 recording with "A Rose Is Still a Rose".
Franklin has won a total of 18 Grammy Awards and is one of the best-selling female artists of all time, having sold over 75 million records worldwide.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.callandpost.com/index.php/entertainment/music/1329-thats-dr-aretha-franklin-to-you|title= That’s Dr. Aretha Franklin to you|publisher=Call and Post|date=2011-11-02[/tpl] Franklin has been honored throughout her career including a 1987 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in which she became the first female performer to be inducted.

==Early life==

Aretha Louise Franklin was born in Memphis, Tennessee, the daughter of Barbara (née) Siggers and Clarence LaVaughn Franklin. Her father, who went by the nickname, "C. L.", was an itinerant preacher originally from Shelby, Mississippi, while her mother was an accomplished piano player and vocalist.[tpl]sfn|Bego|2010|p=11[/tpl] Alongside Aretha, her parents had three other children while both C. L. and Barbara had children from outside their marriage. The family relocated to Buffalo, New York when Aretha was two. Prior to her fifth birthday, C. L. Franklin permanently relocated the family to Detroit, Michigan where he founded the Baptist church, New Bethel. Franklin's parents had a troubled marriage due to stories of C. L. Franklin's philandering and in 1948, they separated, with Barbara relocating back to Buffalo with her son, Vaughn, from a previous affair.
Contrary to popular notion, Franklin's mother did not abandon her children and Aretha would recall seeing her mother in Buffalo during summertime while Barbara also frequently visited her children in Detroit.[tpl]sfn|McAvoy|2002|pp=19-20[/tpl] Franklin's mother died on March 7, 1952, prior to Franklin's tenth birthday. Several women, including Franklin's grandmother Rachel, and Mahalia Jackson took turns helping with the children at the Franklin home.[tpl]sfn|McAvoy|2002|p=22[/tpl] During this time, Franklin learned how to play piano by ear.[tpl]sfn|McAvoy|2002|pp=20-21[/tpl] Franklin's father's emotionally-driven sermons resulted in him being known as the man with the "million-dollar voice" and earning over thousands of dollars for sermons in various churches across the country.[tpl]sfn|Dobkin|2006|p=48[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Feiler|2009|p=248[/tpl] Franklin's celebrity led to his home being visited by various celebrities including gospel musicians Clara Ward, James Cleveland and early Caravans members Albertina Walker and Inez Andrews as well as Martin Luther King, Jr., Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke.[tpl]cite news|author= |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-12-19/entertainment/ct-ent-1220-inez-andrews-obit-20121219_1_albertina-walker-gospel-inez-andrews |title=Inez Andrews: A towering gospel artist - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2014-03-20[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/arts/music/inez-andrews-gospel-singer-dies-at-83.html?_r=0|title=Inez Andrews, Gospel Singer, Dies at 83|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2014-03-20|first=Dennis|last=Hevesi|date=December 21, 2012[/tpl]

==Music career==

===Beginnings===

Just after her mother's death, Aretha began singing solos at New Bethel, debuting with the hymn, "Jesus, Be a Fence Around Me".[tpl]sfn|McAvoy|2002|p=22[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/music/5151565-421/roots--of-soul.html|title=Aretha Franklin’s roots of soul|author=Dave Hoekstra|date=12 May 2011|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=18 April 2012[/tpl] Four years later, when Aretha was 14, her father began managing her, bringing her on the road with him during his so-called "gospel caravan" tours for her to perform in various churches.[tpl]cite book|last=Carroll|first=Jillian|title=Aretha Franklin|year=2004|publisher=Raintree|location=Chicago|isbn=0-7398-7029-7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7nhDFoq_iQEC&pg=PA15[/tpl] He helped his daughter get signed to her first recording deal with J.V.B. Records, where her first album, Songs of Faith, was issued in 1956. Two singles were released to gospel radio stations including "Never Grow Old" and "Precious Lord, Take My Hand". Franklin sometimes traveled with the Caravans and The Soul Stirrers during this time and developed a crush on Sam Cooke, who was then singing with the Soul Stirrers prior to his secular career.
After turning 18, Aretha confided to her father that she aspired to follow Sam Cooke to record pop music. Serving as her manager, C. L. agreed to the move and helped to produce a two-song demo that soon was brought to the attention of Columbia Records, who agreed to sign her in 1960. Franklin was signed as a "five-percent artist".[tpl]sfn|Ebony|1964|p=88[/tpl] During this period, Franklin would be coached by choreographer Cholly Atkins to prepare for her pop performances. Before signing with Columbia, Sam Cooke tried to persuade Aretha's father to have his label, RCA sign Aretha. He had also been persuaded by local record label owner Berry Gordy to sign Aretha and her elder sister Erma to his Tamla label. Aretha's father felt the label was not established enough yet. Aretha's first Columbia single, "Today I Sing the Blues", was issued in September 1960 and later reached the top ten of the Hot Rhythm & Blues Sellers chart.

===Initial success===

In January 1961, Columbia issued Aretha's debut album, Aretha: With The Ray Bryant Combo. The album featured her first single to chart the Billboard Hot 100, "Won't Be Long", which also peaked at number 7 on the R&B chart. Mostly produced by Clyde Otis, Franklin's Columbia recordings saw her recording in diverse genres such as standards, vocal jazz, blues, doo-wop and rhythm and blues. Before the year was out, Franklin scored her first top 40 single with her rendition of the standard, "Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody", which also included the R&B hit, "Operation Heartbreak", on its b-side. "Rock-a-Bye" became her first international hit, reaching the top 40 in Australia and Canada. By the end of 1961, Franklin was named as a "new-star female vocalist" in Down Beat magazine.[tpl]sfn|Ebony|1964|p=85[/tpl] In 1962, Columbia issued two more albums, The Electrifying Aretha Franklin and The Tender, the Moving, the Swinging Aretha Franklin, the latter of which charted number 69 on the Billboard Pop LPs chart.
By 1964, Franklin began recording more pop music, reaching the top ten on the R&B chart with the ballad, "Runnin' Out of Fools" in early 1965. She had two R&B charted singles in 1965 and 1966 with the songs "One Step Ahead" and "Cry Like a Baby" while also reaching the Easy Listening charts with the ballads "You Made Me Love You" and "(No, No) I'm Losing You". By the mid-1960s, Aretha was netting $100,000 from countless performances in nightclubs and theaters.[tpl]sfn|Ebony|1964|p=85[/tpl] Also during that period, Franklin appeared on rock and roll shows such as Hollywood A Go-Go and Shindig!. However, it was argued that Franklin's potential was neglected at the label. Columbia executive John H. Hammond later said he felt Columbia did not understand Aretha's early gospel background and failed to bring that aspect out further during her Columbia period.[tpl]Gilliland|http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1|Show 52 – The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit. 8 : UNT Digital Library[/tpl]

===Commercial success===

In January 1967, choosing not to renew her Columbia contract after six years with the company, Franklin signed to Atlantic Records. That month, she  traveled to Muscle Shoals, Alabama to record at FAME Studios to record the song, "I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)" in front of the musicians of the famed Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. The song was later issued that February and shot up to number-one on the R&B chart, while also peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Aretha her first top ten pop single. The song's b-side, "Do Right Woman, Do Right Man", reached the R&B top 40, peaking at number 37. In April, Atlantic issued her frenetic version of Otis Redding's "Respect", which shot to number-one on both the R&B and pop charts and later became her signature song and was later hailed as a civil rights and feminist anthem.
Aretha's debut Atlantic album, I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You, also became commercially successful, later going gold. Aretha scored two more top ten singles in 1967 including "Baby I Love You" and "(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman". Franklin's rapport with producer Jerry Wexler helped in the creation of the majority of Aretha's peak recordings with Atlantic. In 1968, she issued the top-selling albums, Lady Soul and Aretha Now, which included some of Franklin's most popular hit singles including "Chain of Fools", "Ain't No Way", "Think" and "I Say a Little Prayer". In February 1968, Franklin earned the first two of her Grammys including the debut category for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance.Natalie Cole broke Franklin's "Best Female R&B Vocal Performance" winning streak with her 1975 single "This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)" (which, ironically, was originally offered to Franklin). On February 16, 1968, Aretha was honored with a day in her honor and was greeted by longtime friend Martin Luther King, Jr. who gave her the SCLC Drum Beat Award for Musicians just two months prior to his death.[tpl]sfn|Dobkin|2006|p=5[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Whitaker|2011|p=315[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Bego|2010|p=107[/tpl] In June 1968, she appeared on the cover of Time magazine.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19680628,00.html|title=TIME Magazine Cover:  Aretha Franklin|date=June 28, 1968 |work=Time|accessdate=September 30, 2011[/tpl]
Franklin's success expanded during the early 1970s in which she recorded top ten singles such as "Spanish Harlem", "Rock Steady" and "Day Dreaming" as well as the acclaimed albums, Spirit in the Dark, Young, Gifted & Black and her gospel album, Amazing Grace, which sold over two million copies. In 1971, Franklin became the first R&B performer to headline Fillmore West, later recording the live album, Aretha Live at Fillmore West.[tpl]cite web|title= Aretha Franklin songs|url=http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/aretha-franklin/songs[/tpl] – from the Bill Graham archives; requires free login.  Franklin's career began experiencing issues while recording the album, Hey Now Hey (The Other Side of the Sky), which featured production from Quincy Jones. Despite the success of the single, "Angel", the album bombed upon its release in 1973. Franklin continued having R&B success with songs such as "Until You Come Back to Me" and "I'm in Love" but by 1975, her albums and songs were failing to become a success. After Jerry Wexler left Atlantic for Warner Bros. Records in 1976, Franklin worked on the soundtrack to the film, "Sparkle", with Curtis Mayfield. The album yielded Aretha's final top 40 hit of the decade, "Something He Can Feel", which also peaked at number-one on the R&B chart. Franklin's follow-up albums for Atlantic including Sweet Passion, Almighty Fire and La Diva bombed on the charts and in 1979, Franklin opted to leave the company.

===Later years===

In 1980, Franklin signed with Clive Davis' Arista Records and that same year, gave a command performance at the Royal Albert Hall in front of Queen Elizabeth. Aretha also made an acclaimed guest role as a waitress in the comedy musical, The Blues Brothers. Franklin's first Arista album, Aretha, featured the #3 R&B hit, "United Together" and her Grammy-nominated cover of Otis Redding's "I Can't Turn You Loose". The follow-up, 1981's Love All the Hurt Away, included her famed duet of the title track with George Benson while the album also included her Grammy-winning cover of Sam & Dave's "Hold On, I'm Comin'". Franklin returned to the Gold standard - for the first time in seven years - with the album, Jump to It.  Its title track was her first top 40 single on the pop charts in six years.
In 1985, inspired by her desire to have a "younger sound" in her music, her fourth Arista album, Who's Zoomin' Who, became her first album to be certified platinum, after selling well over a million copies, thanks to the hits, "Freeway of Love", the title track and "Sisters Are Doing It for Themselves".Rolling Stone magazine, "Aretha Franklin's New Wave of Pop" by Eliza Graham, page 11. The following year's Aretha album nearly matched this success with the hit singles "Jumpin' Jack Flash", "Jimmy Lee" and "I Knew You Were Waiting for Me", her international number-one duet with George Michael. During that period, Aretha provided vocals to the theme songs of the shows, A Different World and Together.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-07-18/features/8602120160_1_abc-tv-aretha-franklin-brock-walsh|title=Writer's Ballad Tapped For Abc-tv Fall Theme|author=Patrick Goldstein|date=18 July 1986|publisher=South Florida Sun-Sentinel|accessdate=18 April 2012[/tpl] In 1987, she issued her third gospel album, One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism, which was recorded at her late father's New Bethel church, followed by Through the Storm in 1989. Franklin's 1991 album, What You See is What You Sweat flopped on the charts. Franklin returned to the charts in 1993 with the dance song, "A Deeper Love" and returned to the top 40 with the song, "Willing to Forgive" in 1994.
In 1998, Franklin returned to the top 40 with the Lauryn Hill-produced song, "A Rose Is Still a Rose", later issuing the album of the same name, which went gold. That same year, Franklin earned international acclaim for her performance of "Nessun Dorma" at the Grammy Awards. Her final Arista album, So Damn Happy, was released in 2003 and featured the Grammy-winning song, "Wonderful". In 2004, Franklin announced that she was leaving Arista after over 20 years with the label. To complete her Arista obligations, Aretha issued the duets compilation album, Jewels in the Crown: All-Star Duets with the Queen, in 2007. The following year, she issued the holiday album, This Christmas, Aretha, on DMI Records. In January 2009, Franklin again made international headlines for performing "My Country 'Tis of Thee" at President Barack Obama's inaugural ceremony with her church hat becoming a popular topic online. In 2010, Franklin accepted an honorary degree from Yale University.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/may/24/univ-confers-3243-degrees-at-309th-commencement|first=Lauren|last=Rosenthal|publisher=Yale Daily News|date=May 24, 2010|title=Univ. confers 3,243 degrees at 309th Commencement|accessdate=November 30, 2010[/tpl] In 2011, under her own label, Aretha's Records, she issued the album, Aretha: A Woman Falling Out Of Love.

==Music style and image==

Franklin has often been described as a great singer and musician due to "vocal flexibility, interpretive intelligence, skillful piano-playing, her ear, her experience."[tpl]sfn|Dobkin|2006|p=8[/tpl] Franklin's voice has been described as being a "powerful mezzo-soprano voice" and has been praised for her arrangements and interpretations of other artists' hit songs.[tpl]sfn|Whitaker|2011|p=312[/tpl] Of describing Franklin's voice as a youngster on her first album, Songs of Faith, released when she was just fourteen, Jerry Wexler explained that Franklin's voice "was not that of a child but rather of an ecstatic hierophant."[tpl]sfn|McMahon|2000|p=373[/tpl] Franklin's image went through rapid changes throughout her career. During the 1960s, Franklin was known for wearing bouffant hairdos and extravagant dresses that were sometimes surrounded enveloped in either mink fur or feathers. In the 1970s, embracing her roots, Franklin briefly wore the Afro hairdo and wore Afrocentric styled clothing admired by her peers. In the mid-1970s, after dropping weight, Franklin began wearing slinkier attire. By the 1980s, she had settled on wearing nightgowns and extravagant dresses.

==Personal life==

Aretha is the mother of four sons. Her first two children, Clarence (born January 28, 1955), and Edward (born January 22, 1957), were born before her 13th and 15th birthdays.[tpl]cite book|author=Nick Salvatore|title=Singing in a Strange Land: C.L.

During that period, Aretha's grandmother, Rachel, and sister, Erma, raised Aretha's boys while she pursued her musical career and other options including "hanging out with my friends."[tpl]sfn|Ebony|1995|p=32[/tpl] Rachel lived in a guest house behind her son C. L. Franklin's LaSalle Street home, with the Franklins having moved there from their Boston Street residence during the late 1950s. Aretha's third child, Ted White, Jr., was born in 1964.

(His name was devised from the first initials of his parents' names.) Aretha had married the much older Ted White in 1961, despite strong objections from her father. After a contentious marriage that involved domestic violence, she divorced him in 1969.[tpl]sfn|Bego|2010|pp=125-126[/tpl] She married actor Glynn Turman on April 11, 1978 at her father's New Bethel Baptist Church.

Aretha's sisters Erma and Carolyn were also professional musicians and often sang background on Aretha's hits. In 1969, following her divorce from Ted White, her brother, minister Cecil Franklin presided as her manager, a position he kept until his death from lung cancer on December 26, 1989. Youngest sister Carolyn preceded Cecil in death in April 1988 following a long bout with breast cancer. Erma Franklin later died of throat cancer in September 2002. Franklin's half-brother, Vaughn (born December 24, 1934) and half-sister Carl Kelley (née Jennings; born 1940) are still alive. Kelley is C. L. Franklin's daughter by Mildred Jennings, a then 12-year-old congregant of New Salem Baptist Church in Memphis, where C. L. was pastor.Salvatore, Nick, Singing in a Strange Land: C. L.
