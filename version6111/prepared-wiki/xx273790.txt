Samuel Ludlow (died 1853) was a British surgeon in the East India Company medical establishment, serving in the Bengal Presidency in British India during the first half of the 19th century.  Ludlow spent many years at the Delhi Residency, the headquarters of the British Resident to the Mughal Court in Delhi.  The Resident's Office was created some time after 1803, when the British acquired Delhi, which soon became the Delhi Territory within the Ceded and Conquered Provinces, a part of the Bengal Presidency.
Ludlow joined the Bengal medical department (season of 1804) and was appointed Assistant Surgeon, First Class, on 18 March 1805.[tpl]cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Lawrence Dundas |last2=Samuel|first2=E.

Ludlow is best known today for having constructed a house in the  Civil Lines, just outside the city walls of Old Delhi, which was christened "Ludlow Castle," a play on words on his surname, the building's turret, its decorative crennelations, and the 11th-century Ludlow Castle, Shropshire.  Ludlow Castle, Delhi, was later to become the Residency at Delhi, and, still later, in September 1857, be the site of a battery used by British troops in the Siege of Delhi to breach the city wall and retake the city.
