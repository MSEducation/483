==Background==

The SoShy-only version of the song premiered on October 16, 2009, on Ryan Seacrest's KIIS-FM radio show, On Air with Ryan Seacrest. Timbaland said the song is "very interesting — features this new artist on my label called SoShy from Paris. We're both rapping. The song, I can't describe it, it's so different. It's not different for me, but I can tell you this — it fits everything going on with the vampire theme. It fits everything with Twilight".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1621727/20090916/timbaland.jhtml |title=Timbaland's Shock Value 2 Inspired By 'Twilight' |date=2009-09-16 |last=Reid |first=Shaheem |publisher=MTV Network |accessdate=2009-10-04[/tpl] When asked about why he picked the song as the first single he said: [tpl]quote|I picked 'Morning After Dark' for the first single because the record has the most unique sound from the whole album and when I kept looking at my new artist, SoShy, her whole image fits, like, that song where the song is kinda hard, but not hard, but sexy. She just fit in 'Morning After Dark', she actually came up with the concept of the track. I had the track, but she came up with the concept and I had blended in the concept of wanting to be cool to make the hook kinda talking about a vampire... That is a Timbaland signature record.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a189016/timbaland-talks-shock-value-2.html/ |title=Music - News - Timbaland talks 'Shock Value 2' |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2009-11-28 |accessdate=2009-12-28[/tpl][/tpl]

==Critical reception==

Mariel Concepcion from Billboard magazine said "from the sounds of the first single, the producer is back in stride. Much like the material on his first set, the song heaves with massive sub-bass and weighty kick drums. ... Timbaland flirtatiously harmonizes over a galactic-sounding, double-speed piano and thumping beats. ... He croons on the catchy hook, which features his new label signee, SoShy. While comparisons to the 2007 cut "Return the Favor" are undeniable-lacking shock value on that end-this club banger will send shockwaves through your speakers nonetheless. However Nick Levine of Digital Spy was less impressed. He said "Sadly, this vamp-themed lead single, complete with oh-so-contemporary Twilight-inspired video, is somewhat lacking in bite. The production is suitably sinister, the beats are as sharp as tiny ice-picks, and there's capable support from Nelly Furtado and newcomer SoShy, but it's hard to shake the feeling that there's little here Timbo hasn't given us before. From a man who's built his reputation on boundary-pushing, that's a bit of a disappointment."

==Music video==

The music video was directed by Paul "Coy" Allen and was filmed in November 2009.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.videostatic.com/vs/2009/11/booked-timbaland-f-so-shy-paul-coy-allen-director.html |title=Video Static: Music Video News: BOOKED: Timbaland f/ SoShy - Paul Coy Allen, director  |publisher=videostatic |accessdate=2009-11-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://twitter.com/SOSHYSHY |title=soshy (soshyshy) on twitter  |publisher=soshy on twitter |accessdate=2009-11-13[/tpl] The video uses the version of the song that features only SoShy because Nelly's verse was recorded after Timbaland and SoShy filmed the music video. On November 16, 2009, Rap Up released a 50-second preview/teaser of what the video will entail. The video premiered exclusively on Timbaland's official website on November 22, 2009. The video is an estimated 7 minutes in length, longer than the song itself, featuring a story plot which begins with a girl who has been studying for a year in Italy, talking to her mother on the phone and then a friend who convinces her to go to a nightclub.  While she's talking the camera gives a closeup of a birthmark or scar in the shape of two overlapping circles.  On the way to the club, she is being tracked by a wall-walking vampire, as well as a black cat and Timbaland's character.  As the vampire moves in on her, Timbaland's character zips in between them without her noticing.  The cat changes into the form of a Japanese businessman to board the bus after her where SoShy appears singing her verses, and as she gets off the bus, SoShy intercepts the cat/businessman keeping him from leaving the bus after her. The girl meets yet another man at the club who appears to be a friend or lover, but as they are dancing, she notices a woman staring at her strangely while two other dancers mime a vampire attack on the dance floor.  Rattled, she runs out and her companion follows to comfort her and asks her to tell him what she saw, to which she replies "I think I saw a vampire". This scene is very similar to the iconic scene in Twilight upon which the video is based.  
Her friend's attitude immediately takes on a more threatening quality as a sudden lunar eclipse happens above them but before he can do anything he is confronted by Timbaland and SoShy's characters.  He tells them that this time he's brought a couple of friends, and the vampire and the cat man appear to back him up only for the three of them to be frightened away by much larger crowd that Timbaland summons.  The woman caught between the two sides looks down to see that her circular birthmark is glowing and looks like the eclipse, and the necklace worn by the vampire who was staring at her in the club.  She quickly wakes up from the dream, only to see that the television is playing what it was at the start of the dream and the phone is ringing with her mother on the other end as the black cat comes in through the window.   
On November 27, 2009, an edited version of the video was released for the version of the song that features Nelly Furtado. Nelly is featured in the video, appearing in a kitchen with a black cat while singing her verse.
