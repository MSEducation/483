The most basic endless grapevine sequence of steps may look as follows:
The sequence is then repeated.
The whole movement is in the same sidewise direction. The sequence may start from any of the four listed steps and may break at any place wherever it is convenient to move into another dance figure, e.g., into a grapevine in the opposite direction. 
Troy Kinney (1914) described the Grape-Vine as part of One-Step as follows: Troy Kinney, Margaret West Kinney (1914) "The Dance: Its Place in Art and Life" (public domain, digitized  by Google)
