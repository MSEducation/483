Kashubian or Cassubian (Kashubian: kaszëbsczi jãzëk, pòmòrsczi jãzëk, kaszëbskò-słowińskô mòwa; [tpl]lang-pl|język kaszubski, język pomorski, język kaszubsko-słowiński[/tpl]) is one of the Lechitic languages, a subgroup of the Slavic languages.Stephen Barbour, Cathie Carmichael, Language and Nationalism in Europe, Oxford University Press, 2000, p.199, ISBN 0-19-823671-9

==Assumed origins==

Kashubian is assumed to have evolved from the language spoken by some tribes of Pomeranians called Kashubians, in the region of Pomerania, on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea between the Vistula and Oder rivers.

===Related languages===

It is closely related to Slovincian and both are dialects of Pomeranian. Many linguists, in Poland and elsewhere, consider it a divergent dialect of Polish, although now it is usually recognized as the closest existing relative of Polish.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] Dialectal diversity is so great within Kashubian that a speaker of southern Kashubian has considerable difficulty in understanding a speaker of the northernmost dialects.
Like Polish, Kashubian includes about 5% loanwords from Low German, such as kùńszt (art), and some from High German.Anna Gliszczyńska.

ISSN 1896-2122. Other sources of loanwords include the Baltic languages, Russian and Polish. In dialects of Kashubian a schwa occurs.

==Today's speakers==

In the 2011 census, 106,000 [tpl]cite web | url = http://www.kaszubi.pl/aktualnosci/aktualnosc/id/169 | title = GUS podaje: ponad 100 tys. osób mówi po kaszubsku  | author = Ł.G. | date = 2012-07-26 | publisher = Kaszubi.pl | accessdate = 2012-08-01[/tpl] people in Poland declared that they mainly use Kashubian at home. All Kashubian speakers are also fluent in Polish. A number of schools in Poland use Kashubian as a teaching language. It is  an official alternative language for local administration purposes in Gmina Sierakowice, Gmina Linia and Gmina Parchowo in Pomeranian Voivodeship.

==Kashubian literature==

Important for Kashubian literature was Xążeczka dlo Kaszebov by Doctor Florian Ceynowa (1817–1881). Hieronim Derdowski (1852-1902 in Winona, Minnesota) was another significant author who wrote in Kashubian, as was Doctor Aleksander Majkowski (1876–1938) from Kościerzyna, who wrote the Kashubian national epic The Life and Adventures of Remus. Jan Trepczyk was a poet who wrote in Kashubian, as was Stanisław Pestka. Kashubian literature has been translated into Czech, Polish, English, German, Belarusian, Slovene and Finnish. A considerable body of Christian literature has been translated into Kashubian, including the New Testament, much of it by Fr. Adam Ryszard Sikora (OFM).o. prof. UAM dr hab.

==Education==

Following the collapse of Communism in Poland, attitudes on the status of Kashubian have been gradually changing. It has been included in the program of school education in Kashubia although not as a language of teaching nor as a required subject for every child, but as a foreign language taught 3 hours per week at parents' explicit request. Kashubian has some limited usage on public radio and had on public television. Since 2005 Kashubian has enjoyed legal protection in Poland as an official regional language. It is the only language in Poland with this status, which was granted by the Act of 6 January 2005 on National and Ethnic Minorities and on the Regional Language of the Polish Parliament.http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WDU20050170141 The act provides for its use in official contexts in ten communes where Kashubian speakers constitute at least 20 percent of the population.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]

===Dialects===

As wrote Friedrich Lorentz in the early 20th century there were three Kashubian dialects.
