==History==

The current firm is the result of the 1997 merger of Berrymans with Lace Mawer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/span-id=red20-years-of-the-lawyer/span-1997/130265.article |title=The Lawyer 20-years-of-the-lawyer – 5 December 2007 |work=The Lawyer |date=5 December 2007 |accessdate=2011-08-08[/tpl] The origins of the firm date back to the 18th century, when Joshua Lace gave his name to an already established law firm in Liverpool. In 1901, Frederic Berryman began the practice of Berrymans in the City of London and, in 1946, Arthur Mawer founded AW Mawer & Co in Manchester. Michael Brown is the current national senior partner(elected 2012)
