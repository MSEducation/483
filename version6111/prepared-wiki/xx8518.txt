Nicaragua (AmE [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Nicaragua.ogg|ˌ|n|ɪ|k|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|ɡ|w|ə[/tpl] [tpl]respell|nik-ə|RAH|gwə[/tpl], BrE [tpl]IPAc-en||ˌ|n|ɪ|k|ə|ˈ|r|æ|ɡ|j|u:|ə[/tpl] [tpl]respell|nik-ə|RAG|ew-ə[/tpl]), officially the Republic of Nicaragua ([tpl]lang-es|República de Nicaragua[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-es|reˈpuβlika ðe nikaˈɾaɣwa||República_de_Nicaragua.ogg[/tpl]), is the largest country in the Central American isthmus, bordering Honduras to the north and Costa Rica to the south. The country is situated between 11 and 14 degrees north of the Equator in the Northern Hemisphere, which places it entirely within the tropics. The Pacific Ocean lies to the west, and the Caribbean Sea to the east. The country's physical geography divides it into three major zones: Pacific lowlands; wet, cooler central highlands; and the Caribbean lowlands. On the Pacific side of the country are the two largest fresh water lakes in Central America—Lake Managua and Lake Nicaragua. Surrounding these lakes and extending to their northwest along the rift valley of the Gulf of Fonseca are fertile lowland plains, with soil highly enriched by ash from nearby volcanoes of the central highlands. Nicaragua's abundance of biologically significant and unique ecosystems contribute to Mesoamerica's designation as a biodiversity hotspot.
The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century. Nicaragua achieved its independence from Spain in 1821. Since its independence, Nicaragua has undergone periods of political unrest, dictatorship, and fiscal crisis—the most notable causes that led to the Nicaraguan Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. Nicaragua is a representative democratic republic, and has experienced economic growth and political stability in recent years. Since 2007, Daniel Ortega has been the President.
The population of Nicaragua, approximately 6 million, is multiethnic. Its capital, Managua, is the third-largest city in Central America. Segments of the population include indigenous native tribes from the Mosquito Coast, Europeans, Africans, Asians, and people of Middle Eastern origin. The main language is Spanish, although native tribes on the eastern coast speak their native languages, such as Miskito, Sumo, and Rama, as well as English Creole. The mixture of cultural traditions has generated substantial diversity in art and literature, particularly the latter given the various literary contributions of Nicaraguan poets and writers, including Rubén Darío, Pablo Antonio Cuadra  and Ernesto Cardenal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=es&tl=en&u=http://elcomercio.pe/edicionimpresa/Html/2008-01-20/nicaragua-eterna-tierra-poetas.html&act=url|title=Nicaragua, Eternal Land of Poets|publisher=Elcomercio.pe|accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl] The biological diversity, warm tropical climate, and active volcanoes make Nicaragua an increasingly popular tourist destination.[tpl]cite web|last=Dicum|first=G|title=The Rediscovery of Nicaragua|work=Travel Section|publisher=TraveThe New York Times|location=New York|date=2006-12-17|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/travel/17Nicaragua.html?ref=travel|accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Davis|first=LS|title=Nicaragua: The next Costa Rica?|work=Mother Nature Network|publisher=MNN Holdings, LLC|date=2009-04-22|url=http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/eco-tourism/stories/nicaragua-the-next-costa-rica|accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The name "Nicaragua" was coined by Spanish colonists based on the name Nicarao, chief of the most populous indigenous tribe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.questconnect.org/ca_nicaragua.htm|title=Background notes on Nicaragua|publisher=Questconnect.org|accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl]

==History==

===Pre-Columbian history===

In pre-Columbian times, in what is now known as Nicaragua, the indigenous people were part of the Intermediate Area, between the Mesoamerican and Andean cultural regions, and within the influence of the Isthmo-Colombian area. The Pipil migrated to Nicaragua from central Mexico after 500 BC.[tpl]cite journal|author=Fowler Jr|first=WR|year=1985|title=Ethnohistoric Sources on the Pipil Nicarao: A Critical Analysis|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=32|issue=1|pages=37–62|place=Columbus, Ohio|publisher=American Indian Ethnohistoric Conference|oclc=62217753|doi=10.2307/482092|jstor=482092[/tpl]:38; [tpl]cite journal|author=Kaufman, Terrence|authorlink=Terrence Kaufman|year=2001|title=The history of the Nawa language group from the earliest times to the sixteenth century: some initial results|url=http://www.albany.edu/anthro/maldp/Nawa.pdf|format=PDF|version=Revised March 2001|publisher=Project for the Documentation of the Languages of Mesoamerica|accessdate=2007-10-07[/tpl]
At the end of the 15th century, western Nicaragua was inhabited by several indigenous peoples related by culture to the Mesoamerican civilizations of the Aztec and Maya, and by language to the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area.[tpl]cite news|title=Nicaragua: Precolonial Period|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ni0013)|work=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=2007-06-29[/tpl], interpretation of statement: "the native peoples were linguistically and culturally similar to the Aztec and the Maya" Meanwhile, the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua was inhabited by other peoples, mostly Chibcha language groups.

===Colonial era===

In 1502, Christopher Columbus was the first European known to have reached what is now Nicaragua as he sailed southeast toward the Isthmus of Panama. On his fourth voyage, Columbus explored the Miskito Coast on the Atlantic side of Nicaragua.[tpl]cite news|title=Letter of Columbus on the Fourth Voyage|publisher=American Journey|url=http://www.americanjourneys.org/aj-068/summary/index.asp|accessdate=2007-05-09[/tpl] The first attempt to conquer what is now known as Nicaragua was by Gil González Dávila,[tpl]cite news|title=Nicaragua: History|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-214487/Nicaragua|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2007-08-21[/tpl] who arrived in Panama in January 1520. After exploring and gathering gold in the fertile western valleys, González was attacked by the indigenous people, some of whom were commanded by Nicarao and an estimated 3,000 led by the chief Diriangén.[tpl]cite news|title=The Spanish Conquest|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ni0014)|work=Library of Congress|accessdate=2007-08-21[/tpl]
It was not until 1524 that the first Spanish permanent settlements were founded. Conquistador Francisco Hernández de Córdoba founded two of Nicaragua's principal towns in 1524: Granada on Lake Nicaragua was the first settlement, followed by León at a location west of Lake Managua. Córdoba soon built defenses for the cities and attacked against incursions by the other conquistadors. Córdoba was later publicly beheaded following a power struggle with Pedro Arias Dávila. His tomb and remains were discovered during 2000 in the ruins of León Viejo.[tpl]cite news|title=Nicaragua Briefs: An Historic Find|publisher=Central American University – UCA|url=http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/1418|work=Envío|accessdate=2007-08-21[/tpl]
The clashes among Spanish forces did not impede their destruction of the indigenous people and their culture. The series of battles came to be known as The War of the Captains.[tpl]cite book|last=Duncan|first=David Ewing|title=Hernando de Soto – A Savage Quest in the Americas – Book II: Consolidation|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|year=1995[/tpl] Pedro Arias Dávila was a winner—although he had lost control of Panama, he moved to Nicaragua and successfully established his base in León. Through droit diplomatic machinations, he became the first governor of the colony.
Without women in their parties, the Spanish conquerors took Niquirano and Chorotega wives and partners, beginning the multi-ethnic mix of native and European stock now known as mestizo, which constitutes the great majority of population in western Nicaragua. Many indigenous people died as a result of new infectious diseases, compounded by neglect by the Spaniards, who controlled their subsistence.
In 1610, the Momotombo volcano erupted, destroying the capital. It was rebuilt northwest of what is now known as the Ruins of Old León. During the American Revolutionary War, Central America was subject to conflict between Britain and Spain. Horatio Nelson led expeditions against San Fernando de Omoa in 1779 and the San Juan in 1780, which had temporary success before being abandoned due to disease.

===Independence===

The Captaincy General of Guatemala was dissolved in September 1821 with the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire, and Nicaragua became part of the First Mexican Empire. After the monarchy of the First Mexican Empire was overthrown in 1823, Nicaragua joined the newly formed United Provinces of Central America, which was later renamed as the Federal Republic of Central America. Nicaragua finally became an independent republic in 1838.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=RS|title=Financing the Central American federation, 1821–1838|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=43|issue=4|pages=483–510|year=1963|doi=10.2307/2509898|jstor=2509898[/tpl]
Rivalry between the liberal elite of León and the conservative elite of Granada characterized the early years of independence and often degenerated into civil war, particularly during the 1840s and 1850s. Invited by the Liberals in 1855 to join their struggle against the Conservatives, a United States adventurer and filibuster named William Walker set himself up as president of Nicaragua, after conducting a farcical election in 1856. Costa Rica, Honduras and other Central American countries united to drive Walker out of Nicaragua in 1857,[tpl]cite book|last=Walker|first=W|title=The War in Nicaragua|publisher=S.H.

Great Britain, which had claimed the Mosquito Coast as a protectorate since 1655, delegated the area to Honduras in 1859 before transferring it to Nicaragua in 1860. The Mosquito Coast remained an autonomous area until 1894. José Santos Zelaya, president of Nicaragua from 1893 to 1909, negotiated the annexation of the Mosquito Coast to the rest of Nicaragua. In his honor, the region was named Zelaya Department.
Throughout the late 19th century, the United States (and several European powers) considered a scheme to build a canal across Nicaragua, linking the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic.[tpl]cite book|last=Colquhoun|first=AR|title=The key of the Pacific: the Nicaragua canal|publisher=Archibald Constable and Company|place=Westminster, England|year=1895|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/keypacificnicar02colqgoog#page/n6/mode/2up[/tpl]

===United States intervention (1909–33)===

In 1909, the United States provided political support to conservative-led forces rebelling against President Zelaya. On November 18, 1909, U.S. warships were sent to the area after 500 revolutionaries (including two Americans) were executed by order of Zelaya. Zelaya resigned later that year.
In August 1912, the President of Nicaragua, Adolfo Díaz, requested that the Secretary of War, General Luis Mena, resign for fear that he was leading an insurrection. Mena fled Managua with his brother, the Chief of Police of Managua, to start an insurrection. When the U.S. Legation asked President Díaz to ensure the safety of American citizens and property during the insurrection he replied that he could not and asked the United States to intervene in the conflict.[tpl]cite book|title=Foreign Relations of the United States|year=1912|page=1032[/tpl]

On September 21, 1956, Somoza was shot by Rigoberto López Pérez, a 27-year-old liberal Nicaraguan poet. Luis Somoza Debayle, the eldest son of the late dictator, was appointed President by the congress and officially took charge of the country. He is remembered by some for being moderate, but was in power only for a few years and then died of a heart attack.

===Nicaraguan Revolution===

In 1961, Carlos Fonseca turned back to the historical figure of Sandino, and along with two others (one of which was believed to be Casimiro Sotelo who was later assassinated) founded the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). After the 1972 earthquake and Somoza's apparent corruption, the ranks of the Sandinistas were flooded with young disaffected Nicaraguans who no longer had anything to lose.[tpl]cite news|title=The Sandinistas and the Revolution|publisher=Grinnell College|url=http://web.grinnell.edu/LatinAmericanStudies/this.html|accessdate=2007-05-09|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070206200536/http://web.grinnell.edu/LatinAmericanStudies/this.html|archivedate=2007-02-06[/tpl]
In December 1974, a group of FSLN, in an attempt to kidnap U.S. Ambassador Tuner Shelton, held some Managuan partygoers hostage (after killing the host, former Agriculture Minister Jose Maria Castillo), until the Somozan government met their demands for a large ransom and free transport to Cuba. Somoza granted this, then subsequently sent his National Guard out into the countryside to look for the perpetrators of the kidnapping, described by opponents of the kidnapping as 'terrorists'. Around this time, Chilean president Salvador Allende was assassinated in a Central Intelligence Agency backed military coup that brought Augusto Pinochet to power, leading several hundred Chilean refugees to join the Sandinista army in Nicaragua.[tpl]cite book|first=Pamela|last=Constable|first2=Arturo|last2=Valenzuela|year=1991|title=A Nation of Enemies: Chile Under Pinochet|pages=150|isbn=0-393-30985-1[/tpl]

On the Atlantic Coast, a small uprising occurred in support of the Sandinistas. The Black Sandinistas were challenged by a group of mestizo Sandinista fighters. The ensuing standoff between the two groups, with the Black Sandinistas occupying the National Guard barracks (the cuartel) and the mestizo group occupying the Town Hall (Palacio), gave the revolution on the Atlantic Coast a racial dimension absent from events in other parts of the country. One of the brigade's members, an Afro-Costa-Rican called Marvin Wright (known as Kalalu) became known for his speeches, which included elements of Black Power ideology. The introduction of a racial element into the revolution was not welcomed by the Sandinista National Directorate, which expelled Kalalu and the rest of the brigade from Nicaragua and sent them to Panama.[tpl]cite book|last=Baracco|first=L.|year=2007|title=Wadabagei: A Journal of the Caribbean and its Diaspora|volume=10|pages=4–23|issue=1[/tpl]

===1990s and the post-Sandinista era===

In the Nicaraguan general election, 1990, a coalition of anti-Sandinista parties (from the left and right of the political spectrum) led by Violeta Chamorro, the widow of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro, defeated the Sandinistas.

==Geography and climate==

[tpl]Main|Geography of Nicaragua|Climate of Nicaragua[/tpl] [tpl]See also|Volcanoes of Nicaragua|Wildlife of Nicaragua[/tpl]
Nicaragua occupies a landmass of [tpl]convert|130967|km²|0|abbr=on[/tpl], comparable to that of Greece or the state of Alabama. It lies between latitudes 10° and 15°N, and longitudes 79°[tpl]cite news|title=Nicaragua celebrates The Hague verdict (in Spanish)|url=http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/nacionales/269813-nicaragua-celebra-fallo-de-haya|accessdate=2012-11-19[/tpl] and 88°W.
Nearly one fifth of the territory is designated as protected areas like national parks, nature reserves, and biological reserves. The country is bordered by Honduras to the north, the Caribbean to the east, Costa Rica to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Geophysically, Nicaragua is surrounded by the Caribbean Plate, an oceanic tectonic plate underlying Central America and the Cocos Plate. Since Central America is a major subduction zone, Nicaragua hosts most of the Central American Volcanic Arc.
Nicaragua has three distinct geographical regions: the Pacific lowlands, fertile valleys which the Spanish colonists settled, the Amerrisque Mountains (North-central highlands), and the Mosquito Coast (Atlantic lowlands). The low plains of the Atlantic Coast are [tpl]convert|60|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] wide in areas. They have long been exploited for their natural resources.

===Pacific lowlands===

In the west of the country, these lowlands consist of a broad, hot, fertile plain. Punctuating this plain are several large volcanoes of the Cordillera Los Maribios mountain range, including Mombacho just outside Granada, and Momotombo near León. The lowland area runs from the Gulf of Fonseca to Nicaragua's Pacific border with Costa Rica south of Lake Nicaragua. Lake Nicaragua is the largest freshwater lake in Central America (20th largest in the world),[tpl]cite news|title=Large Lakes of the World|url=http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0001777.html|accessdate=2007-05-25[/tpl] and is home to some of the world's rare freshwater sharks (Nicaraguan shark).[tpl]cite news|title=The Nature Conservancy in Nicaragua|url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/centralamerica/nicaragua/|accessdate=2007-05-25[/tpl] The Pacific lowlands region is the most populous, with over half of the nation's population. The capital city of Managua is the most populous and is the only city with over 1.5 million inhabitants.
The eruptions of western Nicaragua's 40 volcanoes, many of which are still active, have sometimes devastated settlements but also have enriched the land with layers of fertile ash. The geologic activity that produces vulcanism also breeds powerful earthquakes. Tremors occur regularly throughout the Pacific zone, and earthquakes have nearly destroyed the capital city, Managua, more than once."Nicaragua." Encyclopedia Americana. Grolier Online. (200-11-20) http://lp.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=4067000
Most of the Pacific zone is tierra caliente, the "hot land" of tropical Spanish America at elevations under [tpl]convert|2000|ft|m|0[/tpl]. Temperatures remain virtually constant throughout the year, with highs ranging between [tpl]convert|85|and|90|°F|°C|1|abbr=on[/tpl]. After a dry season lasting from November to April, rains begin in May and continue to October, giving the Pacific lowlands [tpl]convert|40|to|60|in|mm|0[/tpl] of precipitation. Good soils and a favorable climate combine to make western Nicaragua the country's economic and demographic center. The southwestern shore of Lake Nicaragua lies within [tpl]convert|15|mi|km|0[/tpl] of the Pacific Ocean. Thus the lake and the San Juan River were often proposed in the 19th century as the longest part of a canal route across the Central American isthmus. Canal proposals were periodically revived in the 20th and 21st centuries.[tpl]cite web|title=TED CASE: Nicaragua Canal Proposal|publisher=american.edu|url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/nicanal.htm|accessdate=2011-07-16[/tpl] Roughly a century after the opening of the Panama Canal, the prospect of a Nicaraguan ecocanal remains a topic of interest.[tpl]cite web|author=Néfer Muñoz|title=An 'Eco-Canal' across Nicaragua|work=Accents|publisher=Tierramérica|location=Granada, Nicaragua|year=2001|url=http://www.tierramerica.net/2001/0506/iacentos.shtml|accessdate=2011-07-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Empresa Portuaria Nacional|title=Proyecto "Construcción del Puerto Monkey Point"|work=Proyectos|publisher=Empresa Portuaria Nacional|location=Managua|language=Spanish|year=2009|url=http://www.epn.com.ni/Puerto-mp.aspx|accessdate=2011-07-20[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Gustavo Alvarez|title=Empresas de seis países interesadas en Monkey Point|newspaper=elnuevodiario.com.ni|publisher=El Nuevo Diario|place=Managua|date=2008-02-18|language=Spanish|url=http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/economia/8704|accessdate=2011-07-20[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Wendy Álvarez Hidalgo|title=Harán puerto Monkey Point|newspaper=laprensa.co.ni|publisher=La Prensa|place=Managua|date=2010-07-07|language=Spanish|url=http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2010/07/07/economia/30625|accessdate=2011-07-20[/tpl]
In addition to its beach and resort communities, the Pacific lowlands contains most of Nicaragua's Spanish colonial architecture and artifacts. Cities such as León and Granada abound in colonial architecture; founded in 1524, Granada is the oldest colonial city in the Americas.[tpl]cite news|last=White|first=RL|title=Pittsburghers find once war-ravaged country is a good place to invest|date=2004-08-24|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04237/366377.stm|work=Post Gazette|accessdate=2007-05-09[/tpl]

===North-central highlands===

The central highlands are a significantly less populated and economically developed area in the north, between Lake Nicaragua and the Caribbean. Forming the country's tierra templada, or "temperate land", at elevations between [tpl]convert|2000|and|5000|ft|m|0[/tpl], the highlands enjoy mild temperatures with daily highs of 
[tpl]convert|75|to|80|°F|°C|1|abbr=on[/tpl]. This region has a longer, wetter rainy season than the Pacific lowlands, making erosion a problem on its steep slopes. Rugged terrain, poor soils, and low population density characterize the area as a whole, but the northwestern valleys are fertile and well settled.
The area has a cooler climate than the Pacific lowlands. About a quarter of the country's agriculture takes place in this region, with coffee grown on the higher slopes. Oaks, pines, moss, ferns and orchids are abundant in the cloud forests of the region.
Bird life in the forests of the central region includes Resplendent Quetzal, goldfinches, hummingbirds, jays and toucanets.

===Caribbean lowlands===

This large rainforest region is irrigated by several large rivers and is sparsely populated. The area has 57% of the territory of the nation and most of its mineral resources. It has been heavily exploited, but much natural diversity remains. The Rio Coco is the largest river in Central America; it forms the border with Honduras. The Caribbean coastline is much more sinuous than its generally straight Pacific counterpart; lagoons and deltas make it very irregular.
Nicaragua's Bosawás Biosphere Reserve is in the Atlantic lowlands, part of which is located in the municipality of Siuna; it protects [tpl]convert|1800000|acre|ha|0[/tpl] of La Mosquitia forest – almost 7% of the country's area – making it the largest rainforest north of the Amazon in Brazil.[tpl]cite news|title=Bosawas Bioreserve Nicaragua|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2006/1718459.htm|accessdate=2007-05-25[/tpl]
Siuna, Rosita, and Bonanza, known as the "Mining Triangle" are located in the RAAN, in the Caribbean lowlands.  Bonanza still contains an active gold mine owned by HEMCO.  Siuna and Rosita do not have active mines but panning for gold is still very common in the region.
Nicaragua's tropical east coast is very different from the rest of the country. The climate is predominantly tropical, with high temperature and high humidity. Around the area's principal city of Bluefields, English is widely spoken along with the official Spanish. The population more closely resembles that found in many typical Caribbean ports than the rest of Nicaragua.
A great variety of birds can be observed including eagles, turkeys, toucans, parakeets and macaws. Animal life in the area includes different species of monkeys, anteaters, white-tailed deer and tapirs.

==Government==

Politics of Nicaragua takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Nicaragua is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.
Between 2007 and 2009, Nicaragua's major political parties discussed the possibility of going from a presidential system to a parliamentary system. Their reason: there would be a clear differentiation between the head of government (Prime Minister) and the head of state (President). Nevertheless, it was later argued that the true reason behind this proposal was to find a legal way for current President Ortega to stay in power after January 2012 (this is when his second and last government period ends).

===Military===

The armed forces of Nicaragua consists of various military contingencies. Nicaragua has an Army, Navy and Air Force. There are roughly 14,000 active duty personnel, which is much less compared to the numbers seen during the Nicaraguan Revolution. Although the army has had a rough military history, a portion of its forces, which were known as the National Guard became integrated with what is now the National Police of Nicaragua. In essence, the police became a gendarmerie. The National Police of Nicaragua are rarely, if ever, labeled as a gendarmerie. The other elements and manpower that were not devoted to the National Police were sent over to cultivate the new Army of Nicaragua.
The age to serve in the armed forces is 17 and conscription is not imminent. As of 2006, the military budget was roughly 0.7% of Nicaragua's expenditures.

==Departments and municipalities==

Nicaragua is a unitary republic. For administrative purposes it is divided into 15 departments (departamentos) and two self-governing regions (autonomous communities) based on the Spanish model. The departments are then subdivided into 153 municipios (municipalities). The two autonomous regions are 'Región Autónoma Atlántico Norte'
and 'Región Autónoma Atlántico Sur', often referred to as RAAN and RAAS, respectively; until they were granted autonomy in 1985 they formed the single department of Zelaya.[tpl]cite news|title=Background and socio-economic context|url=http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/vam/wfp073961.pdf|format=PDF|page=9|accessdate=2007-05-09[/tpl]

Nicaragua is primarily an agricultural country; agriculture constitutes 60% of its total exports which annually yield approximately US $300 million.[tpl]cite news|title=General Information – Nicaragua: Economy|url=http://centralamerica.com/nicaragua/info/general.htm#economy|accessdate=2014-01-04[/tpl] Nearly two-thirds of the coffee crop comes from the northern part of the central highlands, in the area north and east of the town of Estelí. Soil erosion and pollution from the heavy use of pesticides have become serious concerns in the cotton district. Yields and exports have both been declining since 1985. Today most of Nicaragua's bananas are grown in the northwestern part of the country near the port of Corinto; sugarcane is also grown in the same district. Cassava, a root crop somewhat similar to the potato, is an important food in tropical regions. Cassava is also the main ingredient in tapioca pudding. Nicaragua's agricultural sector has benefited because of the country's strong ties to Venezuela. It is estimated that Venezuela will import approximately $200 million in agricultural goods.[tpl]cite web|last=Sánchez|first=E|url=http://www.centralamericadata.com/en/article/home/Nicaragua_Plans_to_Sell_Over_200_Million_to_Venezuela/925161|title=Nicaragua Plans to Sell Over $200 Million to Venezuela – CentralAmericaData :: The Regional Business Portal|publisher=CentralAmericaData|date=2010-03-29|accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl] In the 1990s, the government initiated efforts to diversify agriculture.

Fishing boats on the Caribbean side bring shrimp as well as lobsters into processing plants at Puerto Cabezas, Bluefields, and Laguna de Perlas. A turtle fishery thrived on the Caribbean coast before it collapsed from overexploitation.
Mining is not a major industry in Nicaragua,Dan Oancea: "Mining In Central America" contributing less than 1% of gross domestic product (GDP). Restrictions are being placed on lumbering due to increased environmental concerns about destruction of the rain forests. But lumbering continues despite these obstacles; indeed, a single hardwood tree may be worth thousands of dollars.
During the war between the US-backed Contras and the government of the Sandinistas in the 1980s, much of the country's infrastructure was damaged or destroyed.[tpl]cite news|last=Tartter|first=JR|title=The Nicaraguan Resistance|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?cstdy:10:./temp/~frd_famN::|work=Country Studies|accessdate=2007-11-02[/tpl] Transportation throughout the rest of the nation is often inadequate. For example, one cannot travel all the way by highway from Managua to the Caribbean coast. The road ends at the town of Rama.

The Centroamérica power plant on the Tuma River in the Central highlands has been expanded, and other hydroelectric projects have been undertaken to help provide electricity to the nation's newer industries. Nicaragua has long been considered as a possible site for a new sea-level canal that could supplement the Panama Canal.

Growth in the maquila sector slowed in the first decade of the 21st century with rising competition from Asian markets, particularly China. Land is the traditional basis of wealth in Nicaragua, with great fortunes coming from the export of staples such as coffee, cotton, beef, and sugar. Almost all of the upper class and nearly a quarter of the middle class are substantial landowners.
A 1985 government study classified 69.4 percent of the population as poor on the basis that they were unable to satisfy one or more of their basic needs in housing, sanitary services (water, sewage, and garbage collection), education, and employment. The defining standards for this study were very low; housing was considered substandard if it was constructed of discarded materials with dirt floors or if it was occupied by more than four persons per room.
Rural workers are dependent on agricultural wage labor, especially in coffee and cotton. Only a small fraction hold permanent jobs. Most are migrants who follow crops during the harvest period and find other work they can during the off-season. The "lower" peasants are typically smallholders without sufficient land to sustain a family; they also join the harvest labor force. The "upper" peasants have enough resources to be economically independent. They produce enough surplus beyond their personal needs, allowing them to participate in the national and world markets.
The urban lower class is characterized by the informal sector of the economy. The informal sector consists of small-scale enterprises that utilize traditional technologies and operate outside the legal regime of labor protections and taxation. Workers in the informal sector are self-employed, unsalaried family workers or employees of small-enterprises, and they are generally poor.
Nicaragua's informal sector workers include tinsmiths, mattress makers, seamstresses, bakers, shoemakers, and carpenters; people who take in laundry and ironing or prepare food for sale in the streets; and thousands of peddlers, owners of small businesses (often operating out of their own homes), and market stall operators. Some work alone, but others labor in the small talleres   (workshops/factories) that are responsible for a large share of the country's industrial production. Because informal sector earnings are generally very low, few families can subsist on one income.  “Nicaragua - SOCIETY”. Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress.

Nicaragua is currently a member of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, which is also known as ALBA. ALBA has proposed creating a new currency, the Sucre for use among its members. In essence, this means that the Nicaraguan córdoba will be replaced with the Sucre. Other nations that will follow a similar pattern include: Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Honduras, Cuba, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica and Antigua and Barbuda.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2009/12/13/nacionales/10246|title=Primera prueba del sucre en enero – LA PRENSA — EL Diario de los Nicaragüenses|publisher=Laprensa.com.ni|date=2010-06-16|accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl]

Nicaraguan Spanish has many indigenous influences and several distinguishing characteristics. For example, some Nicaraguans have a tendency to replace the "s" sound with an "h"" sound when speaking.Nicaraguan Americans—History, Indigenous Socieites, Colonial Period, Independence, Modern Era.

===Religion===

Religion is a significant part of the culture of Nicaragua and is referred to in the constitution. Religious freedom, which has been guaranteed since 1939, and religious tolerance are promoted by both the Nicaraguan government and the constitution.
Nicaragua has no official religion. Catholic Bishops are expected to lend their authority to important state occasions, and their pronouncements on national issues are closely followed. They can also be called upon to mediate between contending parties at moments of political crisis.[tpl]cite news|first=G|last=Dennis|title=Nicaragua: Religion|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ni0040)|work=Country Studies|accessdate=2007-10-30[/tpl]
The largest denomination, and traditionally the religion of the majority, is Roman Catholic. The numbers of practicing Roman Catholics have been declining, while members of evangelical Protestant groups and Mormons have been rapidly growing in numbers since the 1990s. There are also strong Anglican and Moravian communities on the Caribbean coast.
Roman Catholicism came to Nicaragua in the 16th century with the Spanish conquest and remained, until 1939, the established faith. Protestantism and other Christian denominations came to Nicaragua during the 19th century, but only gained large followings in the Caribbean Coast during the 20th century.
Popular religion revolves around the saints, who are perceived as intercessors (but not mediators) between human beings and God. Most localities, from the capital of Managua to small rural communities, honor patron saints, selected from the Roman Catholic calendar, with annual fiestas. In many communities, a rich lore has grown up around the celebrations of patron saints, such as Managua's Saint Dominic (Santo Domingo), honored in August with two colorful, often riotous, day-long processions through the city. The high point of Nicaragua's religious calendar for the masses is neither Christmas nor Easter, but La Purísima, a week of festivities in early December dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, during which elaborate altars to the Virgin Mary are constructed in homes and workplaces.
The country's close political ties have also encouraged religious ties. Buddhism has increased with a steady influx of immigration.Con Todo el Poder de la Informmación – El Nuevo Diario – Managua, Nicaragua. Archivo.elnuevodiario.com.ni. Retrieved on 2011-04-29.

===Ethnic groups===

The majority of the Nicaraguan population are Mestizos (mixed Amerindian and European), roughly 69%. 
17% of European origin, the majority of Spanish, German, Italian, English, Turkish, Danish or French ancestry.
About 9% of Nicaragua's population are black, and mainly reside on the country's Caribbean or Atlantic coast. The black population is mostly composed of black English-speaking Creoles who are the descendents of escaped or shipwrecked slaves; many carry the name of Scottish settlers who brought slaves with them, such as Campbell, Gordon, Downs and Hodgeson. Although many Creoles supported Somoza because of his close association with the US, they rallied to the Sandinista cause in July 1979 only to reject the revolution soon afterwards in response to a new phase of 'westernization' and imposition of central rule from Managua.[tpl]cite book|last=Baracco|first=L|year=2005|title=Nicaragua: The Imagining of a Nation. From Nineteenth-Century Liberals to Twentieth-Century Sandinistas|place=New York|publisher=Algora Publishing|chapter=From Acquiescence to Ethnic Militancy: Costeno Responses to Sandinista Anti-Imperialist Nationalism[/tpl] There is also a smaller number of Garifuna, a people of mixed West African, Carib and Arawak descent. In the mid-1980s, the government divided the department of Zelaya – consisting of the eastern half of the country – into two autonomous regions and granted the black and indigenous people of this region limited self-rule within the Republic.
The remaining 5% of Nicaraguans are Amerindians, the unmixed descendants of the country's indigenous inhabitants. Nicaragua's pre-Columbian population consisted of many indigenous groups. In the western region the Nicarao people, after whom the country is named, were present along with other groups related by culture and language to the Mayans. The Caribbean coast of Nicaragua was inhabited by indigenous peoples who were mostly chibcha related groups that had migrated from South America, primarily present day Colombia and Venezuela. These groups include the Miskitos, Ramas and Sumos. In the 19th century, there was a substantial indigenous minority, but this group was also largely assimilated culturally into the mestizo majority.

===Immigration===

Relative to its overall population, Nicaragua has never experienced any large-scale immigrant waves. The total number of immigrants to Nicaragua, both originating from other Latin American countries and all other countries, never surpassed 1% of its total population prior to 1995. The 2005 census showed the foreign-born population at 1.2%, having risen a mere .06% in 10 years.
In the 19th century, Nicaragua experienced modest waves of immigration from Europe. In particular, families from Germany, Italy, Spain, France and Belgium immigrated to Nicaragua, particularly the departments in the Central and Pacific region.
Also present is a small Middle Eastern-Nicaraguan community of Syrians, Armenians, Palestinian Nicaraguans, Jewish Nicaraguans, and Lebanese people in Nicaragua with a total population of about 30,000. There is also an East Asian community mostly consisting of Chinese, Taiwanese, and Japanese. The Chinese Nicaraguan population is estimated at around 12,000.[tpl]cite news|title=Nicaragua: People groups|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/countries.php?rog3=NU|work=Joshua Project|accessdate=2007-03-26[/tpl] The Chinese arrived in the late 19th century but were unsubstantiated until the 1920s.

===Diaspora===

The Civil War forced many Nicaraguans to start lives outside of their country. Many people emigrated during the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century due to the lack of employment opportunities and poverty. The majority of the Nicaraguan Diaspora migrated to the United States and Costa Rica, and today one in six Nicaraguans live in these two countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thedialogue.org/PublicationFiles/The%20Nicaragua%20case_M%20Orozco2%20REV.pdf|title=Microsoft Word - The Nicaragua case_M Orozco2 REV.doc|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl]
The diaspora has also seen Nicaraguans settling around in smaller communities in other parts of the world, particularly Western Europe. Small communities of Nicarguans are found in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Communities also exist in Australia and New Zealand. Canada, Brazil and Argentina in the Americas also host small groups of these communities. In Asia, Japan also hosts a small Nicaraguan community.
Due to extreme poverty in Nicaragua, many Nicaraguans are now living and working in neighboring El Salvador, a country that has the US dollar as currency.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/internacionales/102550|title=El Salvador inicia plan para regularizar a nicaragüenses residentes|publisher=El Nuevo Diario|date=May 18, 2011|accessdate=February 19, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.laprensagrafica.com/el-salvador/departamentos/214132-nicaragueenses-se-acogen-a-programa.html|title=Nicaragüenses se acogen a programa|author=Flor Lazo|publisher=La Prensa Gráfica|date=August 28, 2011|accessdate=February 19, 2012[/tpl]

===Largest cities===

==Culture==

Nicaraguan culture has strong folklore, music and religious traditions, deeply influenced by European culture but also including Amerindian sounds and flavors. Nicaraguan culture can further be defined in several distinct strands. The Pacific coast has strong folklore, music and religious traditions, deeply influenced by Europeans. It was colonized by Spain and has a similar culture to other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. The indigenous groups that historically inhabited the Pacific coast have largely been assimilated into the mestizo culture.
The Caribbean coast of the country, on the other hand, was once a British protectorate. English is still predominant in this region and spoken domestically along with Spanish and indigenous languages. Its culture is similar to that of Caribbean nations that were or are British possessions, such as Jamaica, Belize, the Cayman Islands, etc. Unlike on the west coast, the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean coast have maintained distinct identities, and some still speak their native languages as first languages.

===Music===

Nicaraguan music is a mixture of indigenous and European, especially Spanish, influences. Musical instruments include the marimba and others common across Central America. The marimba of Nicaragua is uniquely played by a sitting performer holding the instrument on his knees. He is usually accompanied by a bass fiddle, guitar and guitarrilla (a small guitar like a mandolin). This music is played at social functions as a sort of background music. The marimba is made with hardwood plates placed over bamboo or metal tubes of varying lengths. It is played with two or four hammers. The Caribbean coast of Nicaragua is known for a lively, sensual form of dance music called Palo de Mayo which is popular throughout the country. It is especially loud and celebrated during the Palo de Mayo festival in May. The Garifuna community (Afro-Indian) is known for its popular music called Punta.
Nicaragua enjoys a variety of international influence in the music arena. Bachata, Merengue, Salsa and Cumbia have gained prominence in cultural centers such as Managua, Leon and Granada. Cumbia dancing has grown popular with the introduction of Nicaraguan artists, including Gustavo Leyton, on Ometepe Island and in Managua. Salsa dancing has become extremely popular in Managua's nightclubs. With various influences, the form of salsa dancing varies in Nicaragua. New York style and Cuban Salsa (Salsa Casino) elements have gained popularity across the country.
Bachata dancing has also gained popularity in Nicaragua. Combinations of styles from the Dominican Republic and the United States can be found throughout the country. The nature of the dance in Nicaragua varies depending on the region. Rural areas tend to have a stronger focus on movement of the hips and turns. Urbanized cities, on the other hand, focus primarily on more sophisticated footwork in addition to movement and turns. A considerable amount of Bachata dancing influence comes from Nicaraguans living abroad, in cities that include Miami, Los Angeles and, to a much lesser extent, New York City. Tango has also surfaced recently in cultural cities and ballroom dance occasions.

===Literature===

The literature of Nicaragua can be traced to pre-Columbian times; the myths and oral literature formed the cosmogonic view of the world of the indigenous people. Some of these stories are still known in Nicaragua. Like many Latin American countries, the Spanish conquerors have had the most effect on both the culture and the literature. Nicaraguan literature has historically been an important source of poetry in the Spanish-speaking world, with internationally renowned contributors such as Rubén Darío, who is regarded as the most important literary figure in Nicaragua. He is called the "Father of Modernism" for leading the modernismo literary movement at the end of the 19th century. Other literary figures include Carlos Martinez Rivas, Pablo Antonio Cuadra, Alberto Cuadra Mejia, Manolo Cuadra, Pablo Alberto Cuadra Arguello, Orlando Cuadra Downing, Alfredo Alegría Rosales, Sergio Ramirez Mercado, Ernesto Cardenal, Gioconda Belli, Claribel Alegría and José Coronel Urtecho, among others.
The satirical drama El Güegüense, written in Nahuatl and Spanish, was the first literary work of post-Columbian Nicaragua. It is regarded as one of Latin America's most distinctive colonial-era expressions and as Nicaragua's signature folkloric masterpiece, a work of resistance to Spanish colonialism that combined music, dance and theater.[tpl]cite news|title=Showcasing Nicaragua's Folkloric Masterpiece – El Gueguense – and Other Performing and Visual Arts|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-150984344.html|work=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=2007-08-03[/tpl] The theatrical play was written by an anonymous author in the 16th century, making it one of the oldest indigenous theatrical/dance works of the Western Hemisphere.

===Cuisine===

The Cuisine of Nicaragua is a mixture of criollo food and dishes of pre-Columbian origin. The Spaniards found that the Creole people had incorporated local foods available in the area into their cuisine.[tpl]cite web|title=Try the culinary delights of Nicaragua cuisine|publisher=Nicaragua.com|url=http://www.nicaragua.com/cuisine/|accessdate=2006-05-08[/tpl] Traditional cuisine changes from the Pacific to the Caribbean coast; while the Pacific coast's main staple revolves around local fruits and corn, the Caribbean coast cuisine makes use of seafood and the coconut.
As in many other Latin American countries, corn is a main staple. Corn is used in many of the widely consumed dishes, such as the nacatamal, and indio viejo. Corn is also an ingredient for drinks such as pinolillo and chicha as well as sweets and desserts. In addition to corn, rice and beans are eaten very often.
Gallo pinto, Nicaragua's national dish, is made with white rice and red beans that are cooked together and then fried. The dish has several variations including the addition of coconut milk and/or grated coconut on the Caribbean coast. Most Nicaraguans begin their day with Gallopinto. Gallopinto is most usually served with carne asada, a salad, fried cheese, platains or maduros.
Many of Nicaragua's dishes include indigenous fruits and vegetables such as jocote, mango, papaya, tamarindo, pipian, banana, avocado, yuca, and herbs such as cilantro, oregano and achiote.
Nicaraguans also have been known to eat guinea pigs, tapirs, iguanas, turtle eggs, armadillos and boas but efforts are currently underway to curb this tendency.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]

===Sports===

Baseball is the most popular sport played in Nicaragua. Although some professional Nicaraguan baseball teams have recently folded, Nicaragua enjoys a strong tradition of American-style baseball. 
Baseball was introduced to Nicaragua during the 19th century. In the Caribbean coast, locals from Bluefields were taught how to play baseball in 1888 by Albert Addlesberg, a retailer from the United States.[tpl]cite news|first=B|last=Villa|title=LA HISTORIA DEL BÉISBOL EN LATINOAMERICA: Nicaragua|url=http://latinobaseball.com/cwb-history.php|work=Latino Baseball|accessdate=2007-07-29|language=Spanish[/tpl] Baseball did not catch on in the Pacific coast until 1891 when a group of mostly college students from the United States formed "La Sociedad de Recreo" (Society of Recreation) where they played various sports, baseball being the most popular. 
There are five teams that compete among themselves: Indios del Boer (Managua), Chinandega, Tiburones (Sharks) of Granada, León and Masaya. Players from these teams comprise the national team when Nicaragua competes internationally. 
The country has had its share of MLB players (including current  San Diego Padres Short Stop Everth Cabrera, Boston Red Sox pitcher Vicente Padilla, but the most notable is Dennis Martínez, who was the first baseball player from Nicaragua to play in Major League Baseball.[tpl]cite news|last=Washburn|first=G|title='El Presidente' happy in new job|url=http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050220&content_id=946722&vkey=news_bal&fext=.jsp&c_id=bal|work=Major League Baseball|accessdate=2007-08-21[/tpl] He became the first Latin-born pitcher to throw a perfect game, and the 13th in the major league history, when he played with the Montreal Expos against the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium in 1991.[tpl]cite news|title=Baseball's Perfect Games: Dennis Martinez, Montreal Expos|.

==Health care==

In June 2011, the United Nations Population Fund released a report on The State of the World's Midwifery. It contained new data on the midwifery workforce and policies relating to newborn and maternal mortality for 58 countries. The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Nicaragua is 100. This is compared with 102.6 in 2008 and 100.8 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 27 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 46. The aim of this report is to highlight ways in which the Millennium Development Goals can be achieved, particularly Goal 4 – Reduce child mortality and Goal 5 – improve maternal death. In Nicaragua the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 7 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 300.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State Of The World's Midwifery|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=August 2011[/tpl]
