==Political life==

Boland was in the Illinois House of Representatives for 16 years.
He was one of the most forceful voices[tpl]according to whom|date=February 2012[/tpl] concerning the admissions controversy at the University of Illinois, in which relatives of politicians close to ex-governor Rod Blagojevich were being admitted more easily by university officials.  Boland called on university officials, including B. Joseph White, to resign, saying "They were trusted to protect our university. In my eyes, they failed in that regard and they should resign."[tpl]cite web|date=June 7, 2009|url=http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2009/06/university-of-illinois-boland-white.html |title=U. of I. leaders urged to resign |work=Chicago Breaking News |publisher=Tribune Company | location=Chicago |accessdate=2010-08-29[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl]

In June 2011, Mike Boland announced that he was running for the Democratic nomination for 17th district congressman, which would then go up against the Republican freshman U.S. Representative Bobby Schilling.  Other competitors in the race at that time included Illinois State Senator David Koehler of Peoria; East Moline City Councilwoman Cheri Bustos, Freeport Mayor George Gaulrapp, and Quad Cities immigration lawyer Eric Reyes.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.pjstar.com/news/x1153512751/Boland-announces-bid-for-17th-District-seat | first = Chris | last = Kaergard | title = Boland announces bid for 17th District seat | date = August 24, 2011| work = PJStar.com | publisher = GateHouse Media | location = Peoria, Illinois | accessdate = 2012-02-25 [/tpl]  However, in October 2011, Boland dropped out of the Congressional race to run instead against incumbent Mike Jacobs for the Democratic nomination for Illinois State Senate in the 36th Legislative District.
EAST MOLINE, Illâ€” What was expected to be a close race for Illinois Senate in District 36 turned out to be a 10% victory for incumbent Mike Jacobs. Long time Illinois Representative Mike Boland had hoped to unseat Jacobs in a race that was tightly contested from the beginning.
