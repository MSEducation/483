[[Direct linear transformation]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry in computer vision, Projective geometry

Direct linear transformation (DLT) is an algorithm which solves a set of variables from a set of similarity relations:
This type of relation appears frequently in projective geometry.  Practical examples include the relation between 3D points in a scene and their projection onto the image plane of a pinhole camera, and homographies.

==Introduction==

An ordinary linear equation
Solutions can also be described in the case that the equations are over or under determined.

==Example==

To get rid of the unknown scalars and obtain homogeneous equations, define the anti-symmetric matrix
and the above homogeneous equation becomes
This can also be written
This set of homogeneous equation can also be written in matrix form

==More general cases==

This means that each value of k provides M homogeneous equations of the type

===Example p = 3===

In this particular case, the homogeneous linear equations can be written as
