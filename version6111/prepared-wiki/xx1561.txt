The European patent with unitary effect, more commonly known as the unitary patent, is a proposed new type of patent that would be valid in participating member states of the European Union.[tpl]#tag:ref|All EU member states except Italy and Spain, which abstained due to the exclusive use of English, French, and German languages, and Croatia, which subsequently acceded to the EU, joined the unitary patent regulation. States will only participate in the unitary patent if they ratify the UPC Agreement.|group=notes[/tpl] Unitary effect can be registered for a European patent upon grant, replacing validation of the European patent in the individual countries concerned.  The unitary effect means a single renewal fee, a single (group of) owner(s), a single object of property, and uniform protection, which means that revocation as well as infringement proceedings are to be decided for the unitary patent as a whole rather than for each country individually. Licensing is however to remain possible for individual countries.
Agreement on the two EU regulationsEU Regulations 1257/2012 and 1260/2012[tpl]cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/indprop/docs/patent/com2011-215-final_en.pdf |date=13 April 2011 |work=European Commission |accessdate=29 June 2012|title=Proposal for a Council regulation: implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection with regard to the applicable translation arrangements[/tpl] which make the unitary patent possible was reached during the European Council of 28–29 June 2012, and by the European Parliament on 11 December 2012.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/content/20121203FCS04313/3/html/Parliament-approves-EU-unitary-patent-rules |title=Parliament approves EU unitary patent rules |accessdate=11 December 2012 |date=11 December 2012 |work=European Parliament[/tpl] The provisions will apply once the related Agreement on a Unified Patent Court, which was signed by all EU member states except Croatia, Poland and Spain, enters into force.  However, Spain has introduced two actions for annulment,Case C-146/13 and Case C-147/13 against the two regulations, which are pending before the EU Court of Justice.
The negotiations which resulted in the unitary patent can be traced back to various initiatives dating to the 1970s.  At different times, the project, or very similar projects, have been referred to as the "European Union patent" (the name used in the EU treaties, which serve as the legal basis for EU competency), "EU patent", "Community patent", "European Community Patent", "EC patent"See for instance: European Patent Office (EPO) web site, EU Council agrees on next steps regarding the Community patent (EU patent), News, 8 December 2009. Consulted on 13 December 2009 and "COMPAT".European Commission, Internal Market, Stakeholders debate future policy on patents, Single Market News, Nr. 42, July 2006 (pdf)
By not requiring translations into a language of each contracting state, and by requiring the payment of only a single renewal fee for the group of contracting states, the unitary patent aims to be cheaper than European patents.  Instead, unitary patents will be accepted in English, French, or German with no further translation required after grant.[tpl]#tag:ref|There is a transition period of maximum 12 years during which there will be one translation made, either into English if the application is in French or German, or into any EU official language if the application was in English.|group=notes[/tpl] Machine translations will be provided, but will be, in the words of the regulation, "for information purposes only and should not have any legal effect".Regulation 1260/2012, whereas #11  The maintenance fees, with a single fee for the whole area, are also expected to be lower compared to renewal fees  for the whole area but the fees have yet to be announced.
The proposed unitary patent will be a particular type of European patent, granted under the European Patent Convention. A European patent, once granted, becomes a "bundle of nationally enforceable patents", in the states which are designated by the applicant, and the unitary effect would effectively create a single enforceable region in a subgroup of those 38 states, which may coexist with nationally enforceable patents ("classical" patents) in the remaining states.[tpl]#tag:ref|Similarly, Switzerland and Liechtenstein created a separate unitary patent under the European Patent Convention. However, the unitary patent for Switzerland and Liechtenstein is the only possible way to obtain a patent in these two countries. It is not possible to obtain a patent only in Switzerland but not Liechtenstein, or only in Liechtenstein but not Switzerland. In contrast, the existence of the EU unitary patent will still permit a patent proprietor not to choose the EU unitary patent and to rather select specific countries.|group=notes[/tpl] "Classical", non-unitary European patents hold exclusively for single countries and require the filing of a translation in some contracting states, in accordance with [tpl]EPC Article|65[/tpl].[tpl]#tag:ref|Although the filing of a translation under [tpl]EPC Article|65[/tpl] is often referred to as "validation", this term is in fact not used in the European Patent Convention.

==Legislative history==

In 2009, three draft documents were published regarding a community patent: a European patent in which the European Community was designated: 
Based on those documents, the European Council requested on 6 July 2009 an opinion from the Court of Justice of the European Union, regarding the compatibility of the envionsed Agreement with EU law: "‘Is the envisaged agreement creating a Unified Patent Litigation System (currently named European and Community Patents Court) compatible with the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community?’"[tpl]CELEX|62009CV0001[/tpl]
In December 2010, the use of the enhanced co-operation procedure, under which Articles 326–334 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that a group of member states of the European Union can choose to co-operate on a specific topic, was proposed by twelve Member States to set up a unitary patent applicable in all participating European Union Member States.Nikki Tait, "Brussels backs ‘single European patent’ plan", FT.com, 14 December 2010. Consulted on 15 December 2010. The use of this procedure had only been used once in the past, for harmonising rules regarding the applicable law in divorce across several EU Member States.
In early 2011, the procedure leading to the enhanced co-operation was reported to be progressing. Twenty-five Member States had written to the European Commission requesting to participate, with Spain and Italy remaining outside, primarily on the basis of ongoing concerns over translation issues. On 15 February, the European Parliament approved the use of the enhanced co-operation procedure for unitary patent protection by a vote of 471 to 160.European patent: Parliament gives go ahead for enhanced cooperation, European Parliament, published: 15 February 2011. Consulted on 15 February 2011. and on 10 March 2011 the Council gave their authorisation.Council authorises enhanced cooperation for EU Patent Two days earlier, on 8 March 2011, the Court of Justice of the European Union had issued its opinion, stating that the draft Agreement creating the European and Community Patent Court would be incompatible with EU law.ECJ Press release of 8 March The same day, the Hungarian Presidency of the Council insisted that this opinion would not affect the enhanced co-operation procedure.Press release of 8 March
In November 2011, negotiations on the enhanced co-operation system were reportedly advancing rapidly—too fast, in some views.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.europolitics.info/business-competitiveness/european-patent-moves-forward-art318386-7.html |title=European patent moves forward |date=16 November 2011 |publisher=Europolitics |accessdate=7 December 2011[/tpl] It was announced that implementation required an enabling European Regulation, and a Court agreement between the states that elect to take part.

Three instruments were proposed for the implementation of the EU patent:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legislative-initiatives/eu-patent.html|work=European Patent Office|title=Unitary patent / EU patent|date=16 May 2012|accessdate=29 June 2012[/tpl]
The system is based on EU law as well as the European Patent Convention (EPC). [tpl]EPC Article|142[/tpl] provides for establishing a common system for Parties to the EPC. Until now, only Liechtenstein and Switzerland have used this possibility to create a unified protection area (see Unitary patent (Switzerland and Liechtenstein)).Treaty between the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on Patent Protection (Patent Treaty) of 22 December 1978, OJ EPO 1980, 407, or [tpl]de icon[/tpl] Vertrag zwischen der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft und dem Fürstentum Liechtenstein über den Schutz der Erfindungspatente Die Bundesbehörden der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft.

====Role of the European Patent Office====

Some administrative tasks relating to the European patents with unitary effect will be performed by the European Patent Office.[tpl]cite video |people=Ingo Beckedorf |date=8–9 November 2012 |title=EPO boards of appeal and key decisions: The future of the boards in the light of the possible introduction of the unitary patent and Unified Patent Court (Part 3 of 3) |url=https://e-courses.epo.org/wbts/caselaw2012/index.html |publisher=European Patent Office |location=Munich, Germany |accessdate=November 16, 2013 |minutes=5:33 to 5:45[/tpl] These tasks include the collection of renewal fees and registration of unitary effect upon grant, exclusive licenses and statements that licenses are available to any person. Decisions of the European Patent Office regarding the unitary patent are open to appeal to the Unified Patent Court, rather than the EPO Boards of Appeal.Article 32(1)i, Agreement on a Unified Patent Court, implementing Article 9.3 of Regulation 1257/2012

====Translation requirements====

For a unitary patent no translation requirements will be in place, which significantly reduces the cost for protection in the whole area. In a transition period of maximum 12 years however there will be one translation made, either into English if the application is in French or German, or into any EU official language if the application was in English. In addition to the patent in German, French and/or English, machine translations will be provided, but will be, in the words of the regulation, "for information purposes only and should not have any legal effect".
In several contracting states, for nationally valid European patents, a translation has to be filed within a three-month time limit after the publication of grant in the European Patent Bulletin under [tpl]EPC Article|65[/tpl], otherwise the patent becomes is considered never to have existed (void ab initio) in that state.[tpl]#tag:ref|[tpl]EPC Article|2|2[/tpl] provides that "the European patent shall, in each of the Contracting States for which it is granted, have the effect of and be subject to the same conditions as a national patent granted by that State, unless this Convention provides otherwise." The provision of Article 65 EPC may therefore be viewed as an exception to Article 2(2) EPC. See also London Agreement (2000).|group=notes[/tpl]
For the 20 parties to the London Agreement, this requirement already has been abolished or reduced (e.g. by dispensing with the requirement if the patent is available in English, and/or only requiring translation of the claims). The effect for the participating countries is shown below:

A common patent court called "Unified Patent Court" (UPC) is planned to be constituted, serving as the single court having exclusive jurisdiction in infringement and revocation proceedings involving European patents in the 25 participating states (both if individual countries are designated and for the unitary patent).[tpl]cite web|url=http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/889924E4E28C5D0CC12578D3003F5046/$File/st11533_en.pdf |date=14 June 2011|work=Council of the European Union |accessdate=30 June 2012 |title=Draft agreement on a Unified Patent Court and draft Statute – Presidency text |quote=(...) the Unified Patent Court will be a court common to the Contracting Member States, thus situated within the judicial system of the European Union, with exclusive competence on their territories for European patents with unitary effect and European patents designating one or more Member States party to this Agreement[/tpl] The court would have two divisions: a court of first instance and a court of appeal.

==Costs==

Translation requirements as well as the requirement to pay yearly patent fees in all countries in which a European patent is designated, presently renders the European patent system costly in the European Union. In an impact assessment the European Commission estimated that the costs of obtaining a patent in all 27 EU countries would drop from over 32 000 euro (mainly due to translation costs) to 6 500 euro (for the combination of an EU, Spanish and Italian patent) due to introduction of the EU patent. Per capita costs of an EU patent were estimated at just 6 euro/million in the participating 25 countries (and 12 euro/million in the 27 EU countries for protection with an EU, Italian and Spanish patent).[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/indprop/docs/patent/sec2011-482-final_en.pdf|title=IMPACT ASSESSMENT Accompanying document to the Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection and Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection with regard to the applicable translation arrangements|work=European Commission|page=36|date=13 April 2012[/tpl]
How the EU Commission has presented the expected cost savings has however been sharply criticized as exaggerated and based on unrealistic assumptions. The EU Commission has notably considered the costs for validating a European patent in 27 countries while in reality only about 1% of all granted European patents are currently validated in all 27 contracting states. Based on more realistic assumptions, the cost savings are expected to be much lower than actually claimed by the Commission.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.platow.de/eu-patent--kostenreduzierungen-deutlich-uebertrieben/4444686.html |title=EU-Patent – Kostenreduzierungen deutlich übertrieben |last=Rox |first=Thomas |date=June 5, 2013 |website=platow.de |language=German |trans_title=EU Patent - Cost reductions clearly exaggerated |accessdate=July 3, 2013[/tpl]

==Earlier attempts==

===1970s and 1980s: proposed Community Patent Convention===

Work on a Community patent started in the 1970s, but the resulting Community Patent Convention (CPC) was a failure.
The "Luxembourg Conference on the Community Patent" took place in 1975 and the Convention for the European Patent for the common market, or (Luxembourg) Community Patent Convention (CPC), was signed at Luxembourg on 15 December 1975, by the 9 member states of the European Economic Community at that time. However the CPC never entered into force. It was not ratified by enough countries.
Fourteen years later, the Agreement relating to Community patents was made at Luxembourg on 15 December 1989. It attempted to revive the CPC project, but also failed. This Agreement consisted of an amended version of the original Community Patent Convention. Twelve states signed the Agreement: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and United Kingdom. All of those states would need to have ratified the Agreement to cause it to enter into force,89/695/EEC: Agreement relating to Community patents, Done at Luxembourg on 15 December 1989, Article 10 but only seven did so: Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and United Kingdom.Official Journal of the European Patent Office 4/2006 p. 328 (pdf)
Nevertheless, a majority of member states of the EEC at that time introduced some harmonisation into their national patent laws in anticipation of the entry in force of the CPC. A more substantive harmonisation took place at around the same time to take account of the European Patent Convention and the Strasbourg Convention.

===2000 to 2004: EU Regulation proposal===

In 2000, renewed efforts from the European Union resulted in a Community Patent Regulation proposal, sometimes abbreviated as CPR. It provides that the patent, once it has been granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) in one of its procedural languages (English, German or French) and published in that language, with a translation of the claims into the two other procedural languages, will be valid without any further translation. This proposal is aimed to achieve a considerable reduction in translation costs.
Nevertheless, additional translations could become necessary in legal proceedings against a suspected infringer. In such a situation, a suspected infringer who has been unable to consult the text of the patent in the official language of the Member State in which he is domiciled, is presumed, until proven otherwise, not to have knowingly infringed the patent. To protect a suspected infringer who, in such a situation, has not acted in a deliberate manner, it is provided that the proprietor of the patent will not be able to obtain damages in respect of the period prior to the translation of the patent being notified to the infringer.
The proposed Community Patent Regulation should also establish a court holding exclusive jurisdiction to invalidate issued patents; thus, a Community Patent's validity will be the same in all EU member states. This court will be attached to the present European Court of Justice and Court of First Instance through use of provisions in the Treaty of Nice.
Discussion regarding the Community patent had made clear progress in 2003 when a political agreement was reached on 3 March 2003. However, one year later in March 2004 under the Irish presidency, the Competitiveness Council failed to agree on the details of the Regulation. In particular the time delays for translating the claims and the authentic text of the claims in case of an infringement remained problematic issues throughout discussions and in the end proved insoluble.
In view of the difficulties in reaching an agreement on the community patent,Axel H. Horns, A Unified European Patent System – The Historical Perspective, IP::JUR blog, 18 February 2010. Consulted on 20 February 2010. other legal agreements have been proposed outside the European Union legal framework to reduce the cost of translation (of patents when granted) and litigation, namely the London Agreement, which entered into force on 1 May 2008—and which has reduced the number of countries requiring translation of European patents granted nowadays under the European Patent Convention, and the corresponding costs to obtain a European patentBruno van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, Malwina Mejer, "The London Agreement and the cost of patenting in Europe", European Journal of Law and Economics, Vol. 29, Number 2, April 2010, pages 211–237.— and the European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA), a proposal that has now lapsed.

====Reactions to the failure====

After the council in March 2004, EU Commissioner Frits Bolkestein said that "The failure to agree on the Community Patent I am afraid undermines the credibility of the whole enterprise to make Europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2010." Adding:
Jonathan Todd, Commission's Internal Market spokesman, declared:
European Commission President Romano Prodi, asked to evaluate his five-year term, cites as his weak point the failure of many EU governments to implement the "Lisbon Agenda", agreed in 2001. In particular, he cited the failure to agree on a Europewide patent, or even the languages to be used for such a patent, "because member states did not accept a change in the rules; they were not coherent".Wall Street Journal, 25 October 2004

====Support for the Regulation====

There is support for the Community patent from various quarters. From the point of view of the European Commission the Community Patent is an essential step towards creating a level playing field for trade within the European Union. For smaller businesses, if the Community patent achieves its aim of providing a relatively inexpensive way of obtaining patent protection across a wide trading area, then there is also support. [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
For larger businesses, however, other issues come into play, which have tended to dilute overall support. In general, these businesses recognise that the current European Patent system provides the best possible protection given the need to satisfy national sovereignty requirements such as regarding translation and enforcement. The Community Patent proposal was generally supported if it would do away with both of these issues, but there was some concern about the level of competence of the proposed European Patent Court. A business would be reluctant to obtain a Europe-wide patent if it ran the risk of being revoked by an inexperienced judge. Also, the question of translations would not go away – unless the users of the system could see significant change in the position of some of the countries holding out for more of a patent specification to be translated on grant or before enforcement, it was understood that larger businesses (the bulk of the users of the patent system) would be unlikely to move away from the tried and tested European Patent.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]

===Since 2005: stalemate and new debate===

Thus, in 2005, the Community patent looked unlikely to be implemented in the near future. However, on 16 January 2006 the European Commission "launched a public consultation on how future action in patent policy to create an EU-wide system of protection can best take account of stakeholders' needs." The Community patent was one of the issues the consultation focused on.European Commission, Internal Market, Commission asks industry and other stakeholders for their views on future patent policy, Brussels, 16 January 2006, More than 2500 replies were received. According to the European Commission, the consultation showed that there is widespread support for the Community patent but not at any cost, and "in particular not on the basis of the Common Political Approach reached by EU Ministers in 2003".
In February 2007, EU Commissioner Charlie McCreevy was quoted as saying:
The European Commission released a white paper in April 2007 seeking to "improve the patent system in Europe and revitalise the debate on this issue."[ref]Commission of the European Communities,
Communication from the European Parliament and the Council – Enhancing the patent system in Europe, Brussels, COM (2007), 29 March 2007[/ref] On 18 April 2007, at the European Patent Forum in Munich, Germany, Günter Verheugen, Vice-President of the European Commission, said that his proposal to support the European economy was "to have the London Agreement ratified by all member states, and to have a European patent judiciary set up, in order to achieve rapid implementation of the Community patent, which is indispensable".European Patent Office web site, "An incomplete European patent system puts European businesses at a competitive disadvantage".

In 2008, the idea of using machine translations to translate patents was proposed to solve the language issue, which is partially responsible for blocking progress on the community patent.James Nurton, Translation breakthrough for Community patent, Managing Intellectual Property, Weekly News, 26 April 2008.

===Agreement in December 2009, and language issue===
