Radha Mohan is an Indian film director of the South Indian film industry. He has, to date, directed six films, four of which have been critically acclaimed and box-office hits. A good friend of actor-producer Prakash Raj, he has directed five films for Prakash  Raj's Duet films: Azhagiya Theeye (Tamil), Mozhi (Tamil), Abhiyum Naanum (Tamil), Payanam (Tamil), and Gaganam (Telugu).
In reality, director Mohan's first film was Smile Please in 1996, and featured  Raj in the lead but the movie was never completed or released.
Known for his strong story lines and sensible and realistic portrayal of women, Mohan's films have largely been clean family entertainment. He has a penchant for humour in his films, and his films have been rib ticklers even though they carry strong messages and handling serious themes. 
Mozhi is his career's biggest hit, followed by Payanam.http://www.videos.behindwoods.com/videos-q1-09/director-interview/radha-mohan.html The director worked under R. V. Udayakumar before he did his first film release, Azhagiya Theeye.
