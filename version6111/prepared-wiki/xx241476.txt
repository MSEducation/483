Original Concept were a 1980s hip-hop group from Long Island, New York, arguably best known for their single “Can You Feel It.” They only made one album and it was notable for the absence of lyrics on many of the tracks. The group are perhaps better known for their production prowess and instrumentals than anything else.

==History==

In the early 1980s, a group of young men at WBAU FM formed a group called the "Concept Crew." Their show “The Operating Room” was broadcast on Monday nights from Adelphi University on the same station which featured the Spectrum City DJs (Chuck D and Flavor Flav) who later went on to form Public Enemy. The members were Doctor Dré, T-Money, Rapper G, Easy G and Wildman Steve.  By 1986, the group began calling themselves Original Concept and had released their first record, "Knowledge Me" in February of that year. The B-Side of "Knowledge Me" went on to become their first single, "Can You Feel It." The single has since gone on to become one of the most sampled source records in hip-hop music.
In 1988, the group was signed to Def Jam Records and in the Fall of that year they released their first and only album, Straight From the Basement of Kooley High! LP on Def Jam. The album features a notable but small cameo by Beastie Boys member, Mike D. on the track, "She's Got a Moustache". The album features samples from the likes of The Jackson 5, The Fat Boys, Run-D.M.C., and P-Funk.

==Where Are They Now?==

The members of the group were generally more successful in their subsequent solo careers as TV personalities and radio DJs than they were as a hip-hop group.
