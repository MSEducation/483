Binghamton University, or Binghamton University, State University of New York, commonly referred to as BU, is a public research university in the U.S. state of New York. The university is one of the four university centers in the State University of New York (SUNY) system. Since its establishment in 1946, the university has grown from a small liberal arts college, Harpur College, to a large doctoral-granting institution, presently consisting of six colleges and schools, and is now home to more than 16,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The legal and official name of the university is the State University of New York at Binghamton.[tpl]cite  web|url=http://bingdev.binghamton.edu/administration/procedures/500series/502.htm|title=BU Administration Procedures|publisher=SUNY Binghamton|accessdate=2010-10-17[/tpl]

==History==

===EstablishmentHistoryUniversity History===

Binghamton University was first established in 1946 as Triple Cities College to serve the needs of local veterans returning from World War II of the Triple Cities area. Thomas J. Watson of IBM was an early supporter of the college and provided some of the initial support and helped to establish it in Endicott, New York; the college was then a branch of Syracuse University. Originally, Triple Cities College offered local students the first two years of their education, while the following two were spent at Syracuse. However, starting in the 1948-1949 year, students were allowed to earn their degrees entirely in Binghamton. When the college split from Syracuse and became incorporated into the State University of New York (SUNY) in 1950, it was renamed Harpur College, in honor of Robert Harpur, a colonial teacher and pioneer who settled in the Binghamton area. It was one of only two public liberal arts schools in New York state in 1950 (the other was Champlain College, Plattsburgh). Among the four University Centers (Stony Brook, Albany, Buffalo and Binghamton), Binghamton was the first to join SUNY.
In 1955, the college began to plan its current location in Vestal, New York. This move was complete by 1961. The [tpl]convert|387|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] site was purchased from a local farmer, anticipating future growth for the school. Colonial Hall, the original building of the former campus, stands today as the Village of Endicott Visitor's Center.
After Harpur College was selected as one of the four university centers of SUNY in 1965, it was renamed the State University of New York at Binghamton.  As other schools were added to the University, Harpur College retained its name and its status as the largest of Binghamton's constituent schools—Harpur College of Arts and Sciences, with more than 60% of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in its degree programs.History of Harpur College
Since 1992, in an effort to differentiate itself from the SUNY system, the school has branded itself as "Binghamton University," or "Binghamton University, State University of New York".  It generally uses these names with exception to official documents and communications where it uses its legal name the State University of New York at Binghamton.  Further, the University's Administration Procedures discourages references to the University as "SUNY-Binghamton," "SUNY-B," "Harpur College," or other names not listed above.

===Past and current leaders===

The first president of Harpur College, who began as dean of Triple Cities College, was Glenn Bartle. The second president, G. Bruce Dearing, served several years during the Vietnam era, and then left to become vice chancellor for academic affairs at the SUNY Central Administration in Albany. Third in line was C. Peter Magrath, who came from the University of Nebraska, served from 1972–1974, then left in the summer of 1974 to become president at the University of Minnesota.
The fourth president at Binghamton was Clifford D. Clark, who left his position as dean of the Business school at the University of Kansas to serve as vice president for academic affairs at Binghamton in 1973, but quickly was asked to take on the job of acting president in the fall of 1974 when Magrath left for Minnesota. Clark then was selected as president and served from March 1975 through mid-1990. In Clark's presidency, he led the campus as it moved from primarily a four-year liberal arts college to a research university. Clark added the Anderson Center for the Performing Arts and inaugurated the Summer Music Festival, created the Harpur Forum (now called the Binghamton University Forum), established the Thomas J. Watson School of Engineering and Applied Science, fostered the expansion and development of the Decker School of Nursing.
Lois B. DeFleur became the University's fifth president upon Clark's retirement in 1990. Under her nearly 20-year tenure, the University experienced its most significant growth. She oversaw substantial additions to the student and faculty populations, vastly expanded research activities and funding, formalized Binghamton's fundraising efforts, expanded the physical footprint of the campus by approximately 20 buildings, launched Binghamton's "green" efforts for which they are now nationally recognized, transitioned the school from Division III athletics to Division I and catalyzed the biggest increase in academic ranking to date. DeFleur retired in 2010 and on July 1, C. Peter Magrath returned as president on an interim basis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.binghamton.edu/news/news-releases/news-release.html?id=996|title=SUNY Chancellor Nancy L. Zimpher Nominates C. Peter Magrath as Interim President at Binghamton University|date=May 20, 2010|publisher=SUNY Binghamton|accessdate=2010-10-17[/tpl]
On November 22, 2011, the SUNY Board of Trustees appointed Harvey G. Stenger, Jr. as the seventh president of Binghamton University, effective January 1, 2012. Stenger had been interim provost and executive vice president for academic affairs at the University at Buffalo since April 2011.Binghamton University - Inside: New University president named

===Thomas J. Watson===

Thomas J. Watson is an important figure in Binghamton's fabric. Having been a founding member of IBM in Broome County, Watson viewed the region as an area of great potential. In the early 1940s he collaborated with a group of local leaders to initiate the creation of Triple Cities College (of Syracuse University), which would later become Harpur College and then finally Binghamton University. He donated land at and around the original IBM site in Endicott, which the school called home for a few years. The campus broke ground at its current location in Vestal, in 1954. In 1967, the School of Advanced Technology was established—the precursor to the Thomas J. Watson School of Engineering and Applied Science that was founded in 1983.

==Organization==

===University leadership===

There are five administrative offices: Academic Affairs, Administration, Advancement, Research, and Student Affairs, each of which is managed by a vice president.
Binghamton is part of the State University of New York system and is one of four university centers of the SUNY system. The University is governed by the Board of Trustees of the SUNY system. The Binghamton University Council also exists to oversee certain aspects of the school's governance such as student conduct, budget and physical facilities. Nine of the ten members are appointed by the governor of New York, with the remaining member elected by the student body.Binghamton University Council
The University has an endowment of $81,919,000 as of 2012.Foundation: Annual Report 2011 The endowment and fundraising campaigns are managed by the Binghamton University Foundation, a not-for-profit corporation established to further the mission of Binghamton.http://www.binghamton.edu/ar-2012/endowment.html
Bold.Brilliant.Binghamton – The Campaign for Binghamton University, which ended June 30, 2012, has raised more than $100 million – exceeding the initial goal of $95 million.

===Colleges and schools===

Binghamton comprises the following colleges and schools:
The Graduate School administers advanced-degree programs and awards degrees through the six component colleges above. Graduate students will find almost 70 areas of study. Undergraduate and graduate students are taught and advised by a single faculty.
The University has announced plans to launch a law school, though some administrators have said that the plan is unlikely to continue.Binghamton University Pipe Dream, Plans for law school tabled by BU officials  This initiative is in its earliest stages though an external review has been completed and the University is moving forward with its proposal. The administration has been working with SUNY, the governor, the American Bar Association (ABA) and other important organizations regarding required accreditation, which the school expects by the time the first class graduates. No decision on where the school will be located has been made.Pressconnects.comThink.Binghamton.edu
Binghamton University has applied to open a new School of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacy. The plan is well received by the higher administration, including the NY governor Andrew Cuomo.  The school is set to open by Fall 2017.[tpl]cite web|title=Binghamton University pharmacy school to open by Fall 2017|url=http://www.bupipedream.com/news/28283/pharm-school/|accessdate=1 February 2014[/tpl]

==Campus==

Binghamton has grown to include roughly 120 buildings, including recent additions from a $2.2 billion SUNY capital plan. New facilities include a housing complex; academic facilities; an indoor multipurpose Events Center to accommodate the University's commencement exercises, Bearcat athletic events and other activities; an addition to the University Union and the partially completed Innovative Technologies Complex (ITC). Another significant addition is the $29 million University Downtown Center in downtown Binghamton, which opened in fall 2007 and houses the College of Community and Public Affairs. The 2007 soccer season saw the debut of a new outdoor soccer and lacrosse stadium, construction on a $66-million engineering and science building at the ITC is well underway and the University has broken ground for its Center of Excellence building, also at the ITC.
A feature of the main campus is that it is shaped like a brain. The primary road on campus creates a closed loop to form the cerebrum and cerebellum, and the main entrance road creates the spinal cord which leads up to a traffic circle (representing the medulla). The main road is thus frequently referred to as The Brain. The connector road, which goes behind the Mountainview and College-in-the-Woods residential communities, is closed for a portion of the year (from late fall to spring). The campus is spread over [tpl]convert|930|acre|km2[/tpl] just south of the Susquehanna River. It features a [tpl]convert|190|acre|km2[/tpl] Nature Preserve, which contains forest and wetland areas and includes a six-acre (24,000 m²) pond, named Harpur Pond, that adjoins the campus.

The Anderson Center has hosted world-class performers such as the Russian Symphony and Ballet, the Prague National Symphony and the Shakespearian Theater Company. In March 2006, an overflow house, filling all of the Anderson Center's theaters, was present to hear guest speaker Noam Chomsky.

====University Art Museum====

The University's art collection is housed at more than one location, but all within the Fine Arts Building. The building's main-level gallery hosts various artifacts which belong to the Permanent Collection, though typically showcases student work on a rotating basis. The Permanent Collection in the basement level of the building showcases ancient art from Egypt, China and other locales. Lastly, the Elsie B. Rosefsky Gallery, just off the Grand Corridor, displays special exhibits and portfolios.

====Events Center====

The Events Center is the area's largest venue for athletics, concerts, fairs and more. Home court to the Binghamton Bearcats basketball teams, the facility seats about 5,300 people for games. For concerts, Commencement and other larger events, the Events Center can hold up to 10,000 people. Home site for the America East Conference Men's Basketball Championships in 2005, 2006, and 2008, the court hosted the women's championships in 2007. It's also held intercollegiate indoor track meets, tennis matches and wrestling matches, as well as opening and closing ceremonies for the Empire State Games. Its construction cost $33.1M and it opened in 2004.

====Other athletic facilities====

Besides the Event Center, the north end of campus houses two separate gyms—the East Gym and the West Gym—for student recreation and varsity athletic purposes. The East Gym is currently undergoing a major renovation, which is expected to be complete in winter 2012. Other varsity facilities include baseball and softball fields, the Bearcats Sports Complex (a soccer and lacrosse stadium) and an outdoor track. Other student recreation features are a series of playing fields used for soccer, football, rugby and ultimate frisbee.

====Nature Preserve====

The University's Nature Preserve is [tpl]convert|190|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] located on the southern end of campus and is referred to as the largest laboratory on campus. Students have actively worked to make sure the space remains untouched. The preserve features approximately 10 miles(16 km) of maintained paths, a large lake, marsh areas, vernal pools, tall hills and a hill-top meadow. A popular hang-out spot is the long wooden boardwalk constructed across one of the marshes, overlooking the lake. For several years, there had been much controversy and discussion over the management of deer population that was rapidly growing. The decision to conduct a deer cull was made in 2011 in order to restore an ecologically balanced preserve. However, subsequent community opposition to the plan, for varied reasons, placed the planned culling on hold for the present time.

====Science Complex====

The science complex includes five instructional and office buildings, as well as a greenhouseBioGreenhouse.binghamton.edu and the Science Library. Buildings are named sequentially as Science 1 through 5.

====Academic Complex====

The Academic Complex is a two-building complex which opened in 1999. Academic A houses the School of Management and Undergraduate Admissions. Academic B houses the Decker School of Nursing and the School of Education.

====University Union====

The University Union is divided into two sections, sometimes referred to as the old Union and the new Union, sometimes referred to as Union East and West respectively, yet called "University Union (UU)" and "University Union West (UUW)" by the University itself. The Union houses many student organizations, a food co-op, the food court, Susquehanna Room dining area, a number of meeting spaces, many new classrooms, the University Bookstore and a branch of M&T Bank.
On August 23, 2013 President Barack Obama hosted a Town Hall in the University Union to discuss College Affordability with students, faculty, and staff at Binghamton University.http://www.nytimes.com/video/2013/08/23/us/politics/100000002403143/obama-speaks-at-binghamton.html

====Innovative Technologies Complex====

More commonly known as the ITC, the Innovative Technologies Complex is a new development intended to advance venture capital research in both the support of the University's activities as well as supporting local high-technology industry. Currently the complex includes two buildings: The Biotechnology Building, formerly belonging to NYSEG and now extensively renovated, and the Engineering & Science Building, opened in 2011. The University broke ground in October 2010 for the third building on the site, which will house the Small Scale Systems Integration and Packaging Center, a New York State Center of Excellence. A fourth building has been pitched under the SUNY2020 grant proposal and will house research facilities for the Health Sciences. Early talks indicated plans for a six-building complex at its completion.

===Residential communities===

Residence halls at Binghamton are grouped into seven communities. The apartment communities used to house graduate students, but now house undergraduates. Of the residential colleges, Dickinson Community and Newing College feature corridor-style double-occupancy rooms, while College-in-the-Woods mixes suites and double- and triple-occupancy rooms, and Hinman College and Mountainview College (the newest of the communities) consist of suites, exclusively. Susquehanna Community and Hillside Community contain only apartments.
The newly completed Newing College, opened in Fall 2011, is part of the University's East Campus building project. Newing and Dickinson communities are being taken down and new buildings are being erected in their stead, along with a new collegiate center and dining facility. The new buildings were unveiled in 2013.Residential Life Staff[tpl]Verify credibility|date=August 2010[/tpl]

===Current and future construction===

Currently, Binghamton is executing and planning several projects to facilitate the growth of the University in terms of population, research capacity and quality.Facilities.Binghamton.edu
The SUNY facility master plan for Binghamton University has released several plans through a couple of open forums, among which possible constructions of a new Globalization Center and a new Student Service & Academic Center were raised. The current visitor's parking lot and the East Campus will be the main venue where these constructions happen.Binghamton University Facilities Master Plan(FMP)

===Academics===

84% of undergraduate students at Binghamton are residents of New York state, with more than 60 percent from the greater New York City area and the remainder from all corners of the state. The remaining 16 percent of the undergraduate student body is made up of residents of other states in the U.S. (7.5 percent) and international students (8.5 percent) from around the world.Binghamton facts and figureshttp://www.binghamton.edu/president/clark/biography.html) Binghamton (SUNY) Overview - CollegeData College Profile Binghamton employs close to  600 full-time faculty, 93% of whom have PhDs or equivalents in their fields.Athletics.Binghamton.edu
Over the 20 year span that Defleur served as university president, the university experienced rapid growth in the number of undergraduates and marked increase in focus on athletics but a marked decline in number of graduate students and little focus on academic quality and accountability.http://chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-accountability/26374 In 1990 there were 9,150 undergraduates  and approximately 528 full time faculty (student/Faculty ratio of  18/1) .There are currently 641 full time faculty with 12,559 full time college students (Student/Faculty ratio of  20/1; Likely an overestimation of faculty since some don't teach and others teach only a half semester course a year to graduate students.) The increase in college students between 1990 and 2013 was accompanied by a decrease in graduate students from 3052 in 1990 to 1824 full time graduates students currently. The cut in graduate students by one third with the rise in undergraduates by one third has a negative impact on academics since relatively fewer instructors and TAs are available to undergraduates http://www.binghamton.edu/oira/cds/CDS_2013-2014%20FINAL%20-%20TC.pdf  [ref]http://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/25/opinion/l-cuny-and-suny-serve-new-york-proudly-binghamton-s-tradition-777190.html

===Curriculum===

Binghamton offers more than 80 academic undergraduate majors and more than 30 graduate majors. There also exist interdisciplinary programs that allow individualized degree programs at both the undergraduate and graduate level. There are also several combined-degree programs which allow students to complete both their undergraduate and graduate degrees in five years. The school offers several early assurance programs which guarantee acceptance to graduate/professional schools outside of Binghamton, such as SUNY Upstate Medical School. Binghamton is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.

===General education===

The University requires students to have completed 12 general education requirements in order to graduate, with some exceptionsWatson School Student Foreign Language Requirements depending on the school. These include courses in aesthetics, global inter-dependencies, humanities, laboratory science, composition and oral communication, mathematics, physical activity and wellness, social science and U.S. pluralism, even the proverbial underwater basketweaving.General Education at Binghamton Individual schools within the University have additional requirements.Harpur Writing Requirement Students in Harpur College must complete a minimum of 126 credits to graduate. Most classes at Binghamton are worth four credits, rather than the more usual three. The typical undergraduate's course load thus consists of four courses (for 16 credits) rather than the usual five (for 15 credits).

===Rankings and reputation===

Binghamton's QS World University Rankings have increased annually from 501 in 2008, to 601 in 2012 and 701 in 2013 with lower rankings reflecting better performance. http://www.topuniversities.com/node/4260/ranking-details/world-university-rankings/2013
Binghamton ranks 573rd in the world in terms of number of highly cited researchers according to the World Top 500 Universities rankings, while the academic quality of the university was not ranked. It is estimated to fall within the 101-150 category for the only academic area it was high enough  to be rated (social science) http://www.shanghairanking.com/World-University-Rankings/Binghamton-University.html

===Music===

To fans of the americana-psychedelic-rock band The Grateful Dead, the name "Harpur College" specifically refers to a legendary concert the band played at the college on May 2, 1970. The reverence in which this concert is held owes both to the quality of the performance and to the fact that high quality bootleg cassette recordings circulated widely among "DeadHeads" for decades before the recording was officially released on CD as Dick's Picks Volume 8. "The Harpur College show has long been prized by tape collectors as an example of the depth the Dead were capable of on any given night."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8438809.html | work=Boston Globe | first=Jimmy | last=Cawley | title=Grateful Dead Dick's Picks Volume 8/ Harpur College 05/02/70 Grateful Dead Records | date=September 4, 1997[/tpl]
