Rev. White met and married Izie Dora White (coincidentally she had the same last name) of Mill Village, Nova Scotia and together they raised a family of thirteen children. One of their children, Portia White, grew to become a world famous singer. Another, Bill Jr., became the first Black Canadian to run for federal political office in Canada when he stood as a candidate for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in the 1949 federal election. A third, Jack, was a noted Canadian labour union activist and the second black candidate to run for office in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. 
In 1916, Rev. White enlisted in the No. 2 Construction Battalion, an all black segregated unit serving in World War I. He was the only black chaplain in the entire British Army and was a commissioned officer serving with the rank of Captain.  Following the war Rev. White returned home to Halifax and was called to Cornwallis Street Baptist Church, a position he held for over 17 years. During the early  1930s, his services were broadcast over the radio every month, and they were heard throughout the Maritimes.
Rev. White died of cancer in September 1936.
His grandchildren include Senator Donald Oliver, politician and activist Sheila White and folk musician Chris White. The novelist and playwright George Elliott Clarke is his great-grandson.
