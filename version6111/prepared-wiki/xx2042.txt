</ref>  The current through the coil magnetizes the iron, and the field of the magnetized material adds to the field produced by the wire.  This is called a '''ferromagnetic-core''' or '''iron-core coil'''.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=soSsLATmZnkC&pg=PA346&dq=iron+core  Laplante 1999, p. 346]</ref>  A ferromagnetic core can increase the magnetic field of a coil by hundreds or thousands of times over what it would be without the core.  A '''ferrite core coil''' is a variety of coil with a core made of [[ferrite core|ferrite]], a [[ferrimagnetic]] ceramic compound.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=soSsLATmZnkC&pg=PA243&dq=ferrite+core  Laplante 1999, p. 243]</ref>  Ferrite coils have lower losses at high frequencies.
A coil without a ferromagnetic core is called an air-core coil.Laplante 1999, p. 19 This includes coils wound on plastic or other nonmagnetic forms, as well as coils which actually have empty air space inside their windings.

==Types of coils==

Coils can be classified by the frequency of the current they are designed to operate with:
Coils can be classified by their function:

===Electromagnets===

Electromagnets are coils that generate a magnetic field for some external use, often to exert a mechanical force on something.Newnes 2002, p. 113  A few specific types:  

===Inductors===

Inductors or reactors are coils which generate a magnetic field which interacts with the coil itself, to induce a back EMF which opposes changes in current through the coil.  Inductors are used as circuit elements in electrical circuits, to temporarily store energy or resist changes in current.  A few types:

===Transformers===

A transformer is a device with two or more magnetically coupled windings (or sections of a single winding).  A time varying current in one coil (called the primary winding) generates a magnetic field which induces a voltage in the other coil (called the secondary winding). A few types: 

===Transducer coils===

These are coils used to translate time-varying magnetic fields to electric signals, and vice versa.  A few types:
There are also types of coil which don't fit into these categories.
