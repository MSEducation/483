==Musical career==

===U2===

On 25 September 1976, Bono, David Evans ("The Edge"), his brother Dik and Adam Clayton responded to an advertisement on a bulletin board at Mount Temple posted by fellow student Larry Mullen Jr. to form a rock band. The band had occasional jam sessions in which they did covers of other bands. Tired of long guitar solos and hard rock, Bono wanted to play Rolling Stones and Beach Boys songs. Unfortunately the band could not play covers very well, so they started writing their own songs.
The band went by the name "Feedback" for a few months, before changing to "The Hype" later on. After Dik Evans left the group to join another local band, the Virgin Prunes, the remaining four officially changed the name from "The Hype" to "U2". Initially Bono sang, played guitar and wrote the band's songs. He said of his early guitar playing in a 1982 interview, "When we started out I was the guitar player, along with the Edge—except I couldn't play guitar. I still can't. I was such a lousy guitar player that one day they broke it to me that maybe I should sing instead. I had tried before, but I had no voice at all. I remember the day I found I could sing. I said, 'Oh, that's how you do it.'".[tpl]cite journal|title=Bono in San Antonio |journal=U2 magazine|issue=3|date=May 1982[/tpl] When The Edge's guitar playing improved, Bono was relegated mostly to the microphone, although he occasionally still plays rhythm guitar and harmonica. As of 2006, Bono has taken piano lessons from his children's piano teacher as a means to improve his songwriting.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/story/bono-takes-piano-lessons_02_06_2006 |title=U2—Bono Takes Piano Lessons|publisher=Contactmusic.com|date=6 February 2006 |accessdate=14 February 2008[/tpl]
Bono writes the lyrics for almost all U2 songs, which are often rich in social and political themes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.atu2.com/band/bono/|title=Bono: Biography from @U2|publisher=atU2.com|accessdate=19 November 2010[/tpl] His lyrics frequently allude to a religious connection or meaning, evident in songs such as "Gloria" from the band's album October and "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" from The Joshua Tree.Stockman (2005) During the band's early years, Bono was known for his rebellious tone which turned to political anger and rage during the band's War, The Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum eras. Following the Enniskillen bombing that left 11 dead and 63 injured on 8 November 1987, the Provisional IRA paramilitaries threatened to kidnap Bono. IRA supporters also attacked a vehicle carrying the band members. These acts were in response to his speech condemning the Remembrance Day Bombing during a live performance of "Sunday Bloody Sunday". The singer had been advised to cut his on-stage outburst from the Rattle and Hum film, but it was left in.[tpl]cite video|people=Hamlyn, Michael (producer), and Joanou, Phil (director)|year=1988|title=Rattle and Hum|medium=Motion picture|location=United States|publisher=Paramount Pictures[/tpl] Also featured in the film is footage of Bono spray-painting a monument during an outdoor performance; Bono was forced to pay a fine.
U2's sound and focus dramatically changed with their 1991 album, Achtung Baby. Bono's lyrics became more personal, inspired by experiences related to the private lives of the members of the band. During the band's Zoo TV Tour several of his stage personas were showcased; these included "The Fly", a stereotypical rock star, the "Mirror Ball Man", a parody of American televangelists, and "Mr. MacPhisto", a combination of a corrupted rock star and the Devil.
During performances he attempts to interact with the crowd as often as possible and is known for pulling audience members onto the stage or moving himself down to the physical level of the audience. This has happened on several occasions including at the Live Aid concert in 1985 where he leapt off the stage and pulled a woman from the crowd to dance with her as the band played "Bad", and in 2005 during U2's Vertigo Tour stop in Chicago, where he pulled a boy onto the stage during the song "An Cat Dubh / Into the Heart".[tpl]cite video|people=O'Hanlon, Ned (producer), and Hamilton, Hamish (director)|year=2005|title=Vertigo 2005: Live From Chicago|medium=Motion picture|location=United States|publisher=3DD Entertainment[/tpl] Bono has often allowed fans to come on stage and perform songs with the band.

==Vocal range==

Bono has a wide tenor vocal range since the beginning of the band. His highest note was reached in 1984 in the studio version of "Bad", recording a C♯5, like in the song "Love Rescues Me"; however, his most notable reached note was a B5, which can be in songs like "Pride (In The Name Of Love)", "I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight", "Magnificent", "Vertigo" and "Ultraviolet".
Nowadays, he can reach a C5 (his can be heard in the current version of "Bad", due to the fact that they lowered the song one semitone). Bono is also characterized by his use of falsetto, reaching a G6 in a live version of "One" in the 90s. He has also reached Pavarotti's notes in "Miss Sarajevo" during Vertigo Tour and in 2010 during U2 360° Tour, reaching a G♯5. Bono's vocal range in live performances between 1984 and 2010 was from C#2 to G#5,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nme.com/nme-video/youtube/id/_3U_o-ifhZo |title=Vocal Range of Bono (U2) Live 1984-2010 E2-C#5-G#5 | Video Youtube – NMETV Latest Music Videos and Clips | - NME.COM |first= |last= |work=nme.com |year=2013 |quote=Bono's vocal range from various live performances between 1984 and 2010.

In a 1986 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Bono explained that he was motivated to become involved in social and political causes by seeing one of the Secret Policeman's Ball benefit shows, staged by John Cleese and producer Martin Lewis for the human-rights organisation Amnesty International in 1979.Boyd, B.

In an article in Bloomberg Markets in March 2007, journalists Richard Tomlinson and Fergal O'Brien noted that Bono used his band's 2006 Vertigo world tour to promote his ONE Campaign while at the same time "U2 was racking up $389 million in gross ticket receipts, making Vertigo the second-most lucrative tour of all time, according to Billboard magazine ... Revenue from the Vertigo tour is funnelled through companies that are mostly registered in Ireland and structured to minimise taxes.".Bloomberg Markets, "Bono Inc", March 2007.
Further criticism came in November 2007, when Bono's various charity campaigns were targeted by Jobs Selasie, head of African Aid Action. Selasie claimed that these charities had increased corruption and dependency in Africa because they failed to work with African entrepreneurs and grassroots organisations, and as a result, Africa has become more dependent on international handouts."Bono and Bob Geldof increase Africa's problems say charity", NME 23 November 2007. Bono responded to his critics in Times Online on 19 February 2006, calling them "cranks carping from the sidelines. A lot of them wouldn’t know what to do if they were on the field. They’re the party who will always be in opposition so they’ll never have to take responsibility for decisions because they know they’ll never be able to implement them.".Michka Assayas meets Bono, Times Online, 19 February 2006.
In November 2007, Bono was honoured by NBC Nightly News as someone "making a difference" in the world."Bono thanks you," NBC Nightly News, 3 November 2007.
