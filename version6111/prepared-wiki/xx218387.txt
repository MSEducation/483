[[Persistent data]]

CATEGORIES: Computer data

Persistent Data denotes information that is infrequently accessed and not likely to be modified.
The opposite of this is dynamic data (also known as transactional data) where information is asynchronously changed as further updates to the information become available. Updates to dynamic data may come at any time, with periods of inactivity in between.
