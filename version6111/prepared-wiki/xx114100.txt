The distance from key destinations, the length of runway available, and the type of aircraft available in the region dictate that air services to St Helena will have to operate to the requirements of Extended Twin Engine Operations (ETOPS) which implies the provision of an instrument approach system based on an off-set [[Instrument landing system|Instrument Landing System Localiser
(ILS LLZ)]].St Helena Access, Project Memorandum Overseas Territories Department, Department for International Development (DFID), January 2005, p. B-6"St Helena Access Feasibility Study" St Helena Government, Department for International Development, January 2005, p. 104
Such is also required by the terrain of the airport which, in commercial passenger air transport terms, is safety-critical, due to its steep approaches, high elevation (1,000 ft above sea level)"St Helena Access Feasibility Study" St Helena Government, Department for International Development, January 2005, p. 13 and rocky outcrops. Without an instrument approach the provision of a viable air service is considered impossible."St Helena Access Feasibility Study" St Helena Government, Department for International Development, January 2005, p. 317
There are doubts concerning local weather conditions and, in particular, there are doubts about the amount of turbulence that could be expected on the approaches from fallwinds resulting from the elevated location and the surrounding bluffs. Therefore it has been recommended a charter aircraft to perform approaches to and departures from the intended runway, which have not taken place so far."St Helena Access Feasibility Study" St Helena Government, Department for International Development, January 2005, p. 117

===Navigation aids===

St Helena Airport will be equipped with an instrument landing system (ILS) and a Doppler VHF Omni-directional Radio Range system (DVOR) supplied by Thales Group.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thalesgroup.com/Press_Releases/Countries/United_Kingdom/2012/121107_Thales_wins_navigation_contract_for_St_Helena_Island%E2%80%99s_first_airport/ |title=Thales wins navigation contract for St Helena Island’s first airport |publisher=Thales Group |work=press release |date=7 November 2012 |accessdate=9 November 2012[/tpl]

==Infrastructure and logistics==

Logistics of the airport's construction are critical, because of the island's isolated location and the lack of construction equipment, which will require everything such as extremely heavy duty equipment and materials to be shipped in, thus resulting in a huge and unique logistics operation."Basil Read's second team Visits and first St Helenian employed", St Helena Herald, Volume XI no. 35, 23 December 2011, p. 5
Due to the limited landing infrastructure, with no breakwater or mooring facilities at the sea front, new harbour facilities capable of handling construction equipment and fuel supplies were constructed at Rupert's Bay."St Helena Access Feasibility Study" St Helena Government, Department for International Development, January 2005, p. 17 Fuel transfers between Rupert's Bay and the aerodrome connected by a 14 km haul road are assumed to be by road tanker for 20 years, after which a capital allowance has been made for enlargement of the bulk fuel storage and the installation of a fuel transfer pipeline.
Basil Read has been sourcing its own ship, a roll-on/roll-off vessel"Basil Read wins R2.7bn contract to build St Helena's first airport " Engineering News, 3 November 2011 called NP Glory 4 flying the Thai flag,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?MMSI=567321000 |title=N P GLORY 4 |author=MarineTraffic.com |publisher=MarineTraffic.com |work=database |accessdate=7 November 2012[/tpl] which, as planned, docked for the first time at St Helena on 11 July 2012 and has since been regularly supplying the island with cargo and personnel for the project.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.shbc.sh/L3_news_120711_np_glory_lands.html |title=NP GLORY 4 MAKES HISTORY, DOCKING AT ST HELENA |author=Sharon Henry |publisher=St The St Helena Broadcasting (Guarantee) Corporation Ltd. |work=news article |accessdate=7 November 2012[/tpl]
The company also considers developing a temporary runway to enable the use of a C-130 Hercules-type aircraft to facilitate quicker access to the site within 18 months of the beginning of construction.

==Project progress==

On 4 November 2011 Basil Read has been awarded to construct an airport on St Helena Island. The first representatives of Basil Read visited the island on Saturday 19 November 2011 for initial investigations and discussions."Basil Read Team - Progression with Airport Developments" St Helena Government Public Relations / Information Office, Press Release, 24 November 2011 Following a second team's visit during December 2011 Basil Read's project manager has settled to the island and the first St Helenian citizen has been employed.
Preparation works are expected to begin in early 2012 in Rupert's Valley on the west coast, which includes establishing storage facilities, a temporary fuel farm and the design and construction of a temporary wharf."Second Basil Read Team Arrives" The St Helena Herald, Volume XI Number 33, 9 December 2011, p.4
Basil Read CEO Heyns in November 2011 said design phase would begin immediately and anticipated that construction could begin in May 2012 which at peak would employ some 300 people of which as many locals as possible should be involved. Migrant workers arriving for the airport development project will be subject to a screening for HIV."Airport News" St Helena Independent, Volume VI, Issue 49, 21 October 2011, p. 2
Construction is said to take place over a 48-month period.
Only four weeks after the approval for the airport to be constructed and years before operations would start, Geo. Robson & Co. (Conveyors) Ltd had already completed and shipped a baggage reclaim carousel for the airport. It will sit half inside the terminal and half outside for the baggage handlers to load with passengers' luggage. The company stated that with a 12 metre perimeter it is one of the smallest baggage reclaim carousels they have ever manufactured.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hub-4.com/news/4013/robson-ships-to-the-south-atlantic|title=Robson Ships to the South Atlantic|publisher=HUB|date=2011-12-01|accessdate=2011-12-30[/tpl] Until the airport opens it will be used at St Helena's harbour to deliver baggage to passengers arriving by the RMS St Helena.
In June 2013 the 100,000th truckload of fill went into Dry Gut, a gorge which must be raised by almost 100m in order to create an embankment that will finally carry parts of the runway. This is equivalent to nearly 19% of the total of 8,000,000m³ required. Basil Read’s calculations showed that a further 430,000 truckloads of material is needed to complete the fill. As of December 2013 the Dry Gut fill project is 50% complete.http://www.sainthelenaaccess.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Airport-Update-No-41.pdf

==Airlines and destinations==

St Helena will have an open skies policy; this allows any airline operator who meets all the required standards to fly in and out of St Helena.[tpl]cite news  | title = Atlantic Star – The Only Plane in the St Helena Sky | pages = 9 | newspaper = The St Helena Independent | location = Jamestown | volume = 8 | author = Vince Thompson | issue = 44 | date = 18 October 2013 | url = http://sams.sh/sentinel/Sentinel_130912.pdf[/tpl] The St Helena Government expects that a return economy flight from St Helena to South Africa will cost around £600. Assuming that an off-peak economy seat from South Africa to the UK are available for approximately £700, return tickes for flights via South Africa to the UK would take the ticket price to around £1,300.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sainthelenaaccess.com/faqs/ |title=Frequently Asked Questions |author=Air Access Office |date= |website=St Helena Airport Project |publisher=St Helena Government |accessdate=12 January 2014[/tpl]

Adding a further route to Johannesburg within a relatively short time frame as well as less frequent air links to Ascension Island and the Falkland Islands are also under consideration.[tpl]cite news  | last = Pipe | first = Simon | title = Ascension shuttle is ‘do-able’, says would-be airline chief | newspaper = St Helena Online | location = Jamestown | date = 20 June 2013 | url = http://sthelenaonline.org/2013/06/20/ascension-shuttle-is-do-able-says-would-be-airline-chief/[/tpl]

==Strategic relevance==

The airport will extend the United Kingdom's capabilities to carry out airborne missions in the South Atlantic region, such as maritime patrols in accordance with international fishing agreements (e.g. ICCAT), counter-piracy missions along important trade routes, and also airlift operations notably into Southern Africa.
According to analysts the UK government's decision to finally go ahead with the airport, after long delays, seems to be driven in part by concerns over a continuing tense standoff with Argentina in the sovereignty dispute over the Falkland Islands. The island is about 3,812 miles (seven hours and 40 minutes flight time) from the Falklands. But, analysts say that was nevertheless an improvement over the present state of isolation from the UK for both St. Helena and the Falklands.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/11/07/St-Helena-airport-a-key-Falklands-link/UPI-78911320686806/ |title=St. Helena airport a key Falklands link |date=7 November 2011 |publisher=United Press International, Inc. |accessdate=8 August 2012 |work=news article[/tpl]

==Controversy==

===Bidding process===

According to Private Eye magazine, all of the companies tendering for the job of building and running the airport had by late September, 2006 withdrawn from bidding for the project, which was to be funded by the Department for International Development (DfID). The local Access Office explained that the reasons were unclear but it seems the bidders considered the DfID has been unhelpful by not providing the possibility of on-site investigations in order to complete a detailed design before providing a fixed price for the project. According to the DfID's Director for Overseas Territories, his department remains committed to an airport for St Helena but at the time of the article there were no new bidders."Departure Delayed". Private Eye, No. 1167, 15–28 September 2006.
DfID restarted the procurement process to identify a suitable Design, Build and Operate contractor in October 2006. Capability Statements were received by DfID in March 2007 and four bidders were pre-approved for the Design, Build and Operator contract and a further three applicants have been pre-approved for the Air Service Provider contract. The applicants for the DBO visited the island for six months from June 2007 before submitting their final proposals, and as of January 2008 DfID is down to a shortlist of two bidders.
It was reported in The Guardian on 10 December 2008 that UK Secretary of State for International Development Douglas Alexander had announced a "pause in negotiations over the St Helena airport contract",Owen Bowcott: "http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/dec/10/st-helena-airport-travel-tourism". The Guardian, 10 December 2008. Retrieved 2008-DEC-10. apparently related to the 2008 economic downturn.
The St. Helena Leisure Corporation (Shelco) was set up by Arup's Sir Nigel Thompson and Berwin Leighton Paisner's Robert Jones, planning to construct luxury resorts and a hotel to be run by Oberoi Hotels & Resorts in conjunction with the airport. The real estate was to be sold even before construction had started; the proposal was turned down by the local government and the DfID.David Lawson: "Island in the Sun".

===Environmental issues===

Prosperous Bay Plain is one of the few remaining sites on Saint Helena that holds significant ecological diversity; according to a 2004 review by Atkins Management Consultants, the survival of numerous endemic species critically depend on preservation and protection of the location; it also is an important  nesting site for the Wirebird, Saint Helena's national bird which is nearly extinct. Although Shelco still continues to be a major force pushing for the airport's construction, its co-founder Sir Nigel is the chairman of the environmental charity Campaign to Protect Rural England.Robin Stummer and Daniel Howden: "The Battle for St Helena".
