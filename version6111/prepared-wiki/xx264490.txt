Onkel Pös Carnegie Hall, better known as Onkel Pö, was a music venue in Hamburg in the 1970s and the early 1980s.

==Pöseldorf==

Onkel Pö was originally a jazz venue in Mittelweg in the quarter Pöseldorf in Hamburg, and was opened by Bernd Cordua and Peter Marxen, who had previously opened the Jazzhouse, another jazz venue, in Brandstwiete. The name was chosen as a reference to Carnegie Hall in New York. The original venue has been occupied by the music pub Zwick since Onkel Pö moved to Eppendorf.

==Eppendorf==

Soon after opening, on 1 October 1970, Onkel Pö moved to Lehmweg 44 in Eppendorf, where Ballhouse Eppendorf had been.[tpl]Cite news | last =Mischke | first =Joachim | title =Ein Herz für Stars | newspaper =Hamburger Abendblatt - Magazin | location =Hamburg | pages =VII | language =German | publisher =Axel Springer | date =Week 53 2010[/tpl] Bernd Cordua left, and it was run by Peter Marxen on his own.
From 1975, Onkel Pö was one of the venues of the Jazz Festival in Hamburg, which was called New Jazz Festival at the time. To make the festival a success, the musicians, including Albert Mangelsdorff, Wolfgang Dauner and Gerd Dudek played for reduced remuneration.

Andreas Kiel was responsible for the programme until Onkel Pö closed at 8 a.m. on 1 January 1986. The restaurant which took over the venue was called Legendär ([tpl]lang-de|Legendary[/tpl]), but since 1 November 2006, it is used by the Schweinske chain of restaurants.
Bernd Cordua tried without much success to open various venues with the name Onkel Pö.
