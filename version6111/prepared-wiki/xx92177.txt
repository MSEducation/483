José Alberto Pujols Alcántara (born January 16, 1980), better known as Albert Pujols ([tpl]IPA-es|ˈalβert puˈxols[/tpl]), is a Dominican-American  first baseman for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim of Major League Baseball (MLB). He stands [tpl]height|ft=6|in=3[/tpl] tall, weighs [tpl]convert|230|lbs|kg[/tpl], and bats and throws right-handed. He previously played for the St. Louis Cardinals. He is the only player in major league history to bat at least .300 with 30 or more home runs and 100 or more runs batted in (RBIs) in his first 10 seasons. He also is the first player to accumulate at least 500 doubles in his first 12 seasons.
Pujols was born in the Dominican Republic and moved to the United States in 1996. After one season of college baseball, he was selected by the Cardinals in the 13th round of the 1999 MLB Draft. As a rookie for the Cardinals in 2001, he unanimously won the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award. He finished second in NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award voting in 2002, and he won the batting title in 2003 after hitting .359. He hit 40 home runs for the first time in his career in 2004 and helped the Cardinals reach the World Series, where they were swept by the Boston Red Sox in four games. He won his first NL MVP Award in 2005, and he won his first World Series in 2006 when the Cardinals defeated the Detroit Tigers in five games.
Pujols failed to score 100 runs for the first time in his career in 2007. In 2008, he won his second NL MVP. He won the award again in 2009 while leading the league in home runs for the first time, and in 2010 he led the NL in home runs and RBIs. He won his second World Series in 2011 as the Cardinals defeated the Texas Rangers in seven games. Pujols tied Series single-game records for home runs, hits, and RBI in Game 3. He became a free agent after the season and signed a 10-year deal with the Angels. Pujols hit his 500th career home run on April 22, 2014.

==Early life and career==

Born on January 16, 1980, Pujols was raised in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, mostly by his grandmother America Pujols and 10 of his uncles and aunts. He was an only child. His father, Bienvenido Pujols, was a softball pitcher, but he was also an alcoholic. Albert often had to take his father home when his father got drunk following the games. Growing up, Pujols practiced baseball using limes for balls and a milk carton for a glove.[tpl]cite web |last=Posnanski |first=Joe |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1153053/3/index.htm |title=The Power To Believe |work=sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=March 16, 2009 |accessdate=April 25, 2012[/tpl] Pujols, his father, and his grandmother immigrated to New York City in 1996, where Albert witnessed a shooting at a grocery store.

==Professional baseball career==

His wife explained on a radio talk show that they were "insulted" and "confused" that the Cardinals had initially offered Pujols a five-year deal.[tpl]cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/7346376/albert-pujols-wife-deidre-explains-why-los-angeles-angels-slugger-left-st-louis-cardinals |title=Deidre Pujols explains decision |work=ESPN.com |date=December 13, 2011 |accessdate=August 6, 2012[/tpl] The Marlins reportedly offered Pujols a 10-year contract too, but on December 8 he signed a 10-year deal with the Angels worth around $254 million.[tpl]cite web |last=Kruth |first=Cash |url=http://miami.marlins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20111208&content_id=26127998&vkey=news_mia&c_id=mia |title=Marlins lose out on free agents Pujols, Wilson |work=Marlins.MLB.com |date=December 8, 2011 |accessdate=August 6, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Pujols, Angels agree to $254 million, 10-year deal|author=Blum, Ronald|url=http://news.yahoo.com/pujols-angels-agree-254-million-10-deal-190024693.html|date=December 8, 2011|work=Yahoo!|accessdate=December 8, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Gonzalez|first=Alden|title=Halos' Saturday news conference to air live|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20111209&content_id=26138046&vkey=news_ana&c_id=mlb|accessdate=December 10, 2011|work=MLB.com|date=December 10, 2011[/tpl] The contract offered by the Marlins was reportedly around the value as that offered by the Angels.

After the game, Holland observed that Pujols had ended his early-season struggles: "He's definitely turned it around, no doubt about it," he said. "He is what he is. He had a slow start, but he's picked it up. He's a great hitter.

====2013 season====

On August 18, 2013, Pujols was ruled out for the remainder of the 2013 season after suffering a knee injury. Pujols had by far the worst season of his career in 2013, failing to play at least 100 games for the first time in his career. Pujols also posted career worsts in hits, runs scored, doubles, home runs, RBI, walks, batting average, on base percentage, slugging percentage, and OPS. Overall in 99 games, Pujols batted .258 with 101 hits, 19 doubles, 17 home runs, 64 RBI, and 49 runs scored.
In August 2013, former Cardinals player Jack Clark accused Pujols of using performance-enhancing drugs on his radio show on WGNU in St. Louis.  Clark served as the Cardinals' hitting coach during the early part of Pujols' tenure in St. Louis.  On the morning of August 9, Pujols issued a statement adamantly denying that he had ever taken PEDs.  He denounced Clark's allegations as "irresponsible and reckless" and threatened to sue Clark and WGNU over the allegations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130809&content_id=56426970&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb |title=Pujols denies steroid allegations, threatens legal action: Defiant slugger rebuffs St. Louis radio host's claim that trainer used to 'shoot him up' |publisher=MLB.com |date=August 10, 2013[/tpl]  Partly due to legal threats from Pujols, InsideSTL Enterprises, which owns WGNU's weekday airtime under a time brokerage agreement, cut ties with Clark.Albert Pujols says he will sue Jack Clark over false accusations - ESPNEx-MLBer Clark says Albert Pujols used PEDs; trainer says not so - CBSSports.comhttp://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:9556488[tpl]cite web|url=http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/84003/wgnu-st-louis-to-flip-to-sports/|title=WGNU St. Louis To Flip To Sports|last=Venta|first=Bruce|date=June 28, 2013|publisher=Radio Insight|accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] On October 4, 2013, Pujols filed a defamation lawsuit against Clark.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/mlb/story/_/id/9769100/albert-pujols-los-angeles-angels-sues-jack-clark-steroid-accusations|title=Albert Pujols sues Jack Clark |publisher=ESPN |date=October 5, 2013[/tpl] In response on October 14, Clark challenged Pujols to both take polygraph tests to resolve who is telling the truth.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/clark-challenges-pujols-to-dueling-polygraphs-over-steroids-claims/article_3ff849de-b3c2-5af6-943a-3971bc7b3a17.html |title=Clark challenges Pujols to dueling polygraphs over steroids claims |publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |date=October 14, 2013[/tpl]However, on February 10, 2014, Clark apologized and retracted his accusations against Pujols, saying he had "no knowledge whatsoever" that Pujols ever used PEDs.

====2014 season====

On April 22, 2014, Pujols hit his 499th and 500th home run of his career off of Taylor Jordan in a game versus the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park. Pujols became the 26th player ever to reach the 500 home run mark, as well as the third youngest to reach it. Pujols also became the first player to hit career home runs 499 and 500 in the same game. Nationals Park is the same ballpark where he hit his 400th career home run in the 2010 season.[tpl]cite web|last=Wagner|first=James|title=Albert Pujols hits career home run No. 500 off Taylor Jordan|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/nationals-journal/wp/2014/04/22/albert-pujols-hits-career-home-run-no-500-off-taylor-jordan/|publisher=Nationals Journal (Washington Post)|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl]

==Playing style==

Pujols's swing has been praised for its consistency. "It's the same swing every time," former teammate Lance Berkman once said.[tpl]cite web |last=Justice |first=Richard |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120312&content_id=27227330&c_id=mlb |title=Consistent Pujols unfazed by expectations |work=MLB.com |date=March 12, 2012 |accessdate=November 27, 2012[/tpl] "He has the ability to repeat his swing over and over and over, which leads to him being very consistent," Cardinals' video coordinator Chad Blair said. Sports Illustrated writer Daniel G. Habib described the swing as "quick" and "quiet." Pujols uses a 32.5-ounce bat against right-handed pitchers, but he uses a 33 ounce bat against left-handers to avoid trying to pull the ball when he swings.[tpl]cite web |last=Habib |first=Daniel G. |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1111306/index.htm |title=A Swing Of Beauty |work=sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=May 22, 2006 |accessdate=November 27, 2012[/tpl] Defensively, Pujols has won two Gold Glove Awards since moving to first base in 2004. He has credited his hitting ability partly to guessing what pitchers will do: [tpl]cquote|I can tell right away from the first pitch if they're going to pitch to me or not with men on base. I need to be aggressive and make sure I look for my pitch and be ready. If it's there, be ready to swing. If it's not there, take it. There's just something there in my mind and you know right away the situation will dictate the situation you're in.|||The New York Times: May 31, 2009[tpl]cite web |last=Curry |first=Jack |url=http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/31/the-many-hitting-faces-of-albert-pujols/ |title=The Many Hitting Faces of Albert Pujols |work=The New York Times |date=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=December 3, 2012[/tpl][/tpl]

Those are the things that I really try to focus on and try to make sure that I do every day for the rest of my career."[tpl]cite web|last=Leach|first=Matthew|url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090924&content_id=7130304&vkey=news_stl&fext=.jsp&c_id=stl|title=Pujols making his mark on MLB history|work=Cardinals.MLB.com|date=September 24, 2009 |accessdate=August 2, 2012[/tpl]
