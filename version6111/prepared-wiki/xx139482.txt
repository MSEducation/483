The London Grid for Learning provides a filtered broadband connection, network services, a common learning platform, online content and support communities for all schools across London.  It operates as a consortium of 33 Local Education Authorities.  It was launched in June 2000, and provides broadband connectivity to all 2,600 state schools in London. More than 1 million pages of material are accessed every day.
Schools, colleges and public libraries access the Internet via dynamic IP addresses in the range 82.198.244.0 - 82.198.255.255, and 212.85.0.0 - 212.85.3.255 (amongst others).
The LGfL now hosts and manages the Pan-London Admissions project and forms the backbone of the London Public Services Network.
