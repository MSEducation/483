Kinnekulle is a hill or ridge in the province of Västergötland, Sweden.  It is located on the eastern shore of lake Vänern. Its highest point is 306 metres above sea level. The Kinnekulle Ring is a popular nearby racetrack.  The historic town and church of Husaby are located on the south side of the Kinnekulle.  Olof Skötkonung, the first Christian King of Sweden, was, tradition says, baptized here in 1008 at a well located just north of the church.
The mountain of Kinnefjellet at Spitsbergen, Svalbard, is named after Kinnekulle.[tpl]cite web |url=http://placenames.npolar.no/stadnamn/Kinnefjellet |title=Kinnefjellet (Svalbard) |publisher=Norwegian Polar Institute |accessdate=24 April 2014[/tpl]
