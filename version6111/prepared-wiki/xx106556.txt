==Governor of Bangkok==

In 2004 the Democratic Party nominated him as their candidate for the Bangkok governor election, which he won gaining 40% of all votes. Paveena Hongsakul, an independent candidate with the unofficial support of the ruling Thai Rak Thai party, came in second-place with 16% of the vote.
Critics have noted the lack of tangible impact Apirak had in his role as city governor.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/25/politics/politics_30009487.php|title=Political sentiment turns toward the democrats|publisher=The Nation|date=2006-07-25[/tpl] Some policies, for instance "smart" traffic signs and bus stops flopped and his Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project has yet to come into service.  However, he was lauded for being able to push the extension of BTS Skytrain routes, which are currently under construction. Another notable project Apirak was successful in implementing is the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre at Pathumwan intersection which opened in 2008.
After two years in office, poll respondents gave him high marks for diligence and dedication to work. But he received his lowest marks for seeing projects through to completion. His traffic and transport initiatives also received flunking marks. Overall, 57% of Bangkokians felt he had met expectations.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/04/headlines/headlines_30012758.php|title=BKK governor passes with 5/10 : Poll|publisher=The Nation|date=2006-09-04[/tpl]
Apirak's so-called smart taxi stops were met with derision. The 150 stops that were in operation by October 2005 looked like bus stops. If people were waiting, a red light became visible to nearby cabs. If no taxis passed by, would-be passengers could press a button and a call centre would direct cabs to the stand. A BMA study found the stops had a success rate of only 38.6%. Although 189,549 smart taxis had been hailed, the study showed that only 73,168 stopped to pick up passengers. Many stops stood empty and unused.[tpl]cite news|publisher=The Nation|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/02/national/national_30030857.php|title=BMA outsmarted by jokers at taxi stands|date=2007-04-02[/tpl] However, Apirak's smart traffic signs have been a mild success, giving motorists more information about traffic conditions ahead and is mild relief from the stress of driving in the city.
The military junta's Assets Examination Committee (AEC) did not charge Apirak over the controversial purchase of fire-fighting equipment for the city.  Sithichok Rawdkrutha, an AEC member, lodged a complaint with AEC Chairman Nam Yimyaem over the decision and noted that he suspected Apirak of dereliction of duty or malfeasance for giving the nod to the purchase, for which he allegedly received 500 million baht in kickbacks.[tpl]cite news|publisher=The Nation|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/07/09/politics/politics_30039960.php|title=AEC urged to charge Apirak over tainted deal|date=2007-07-09[/tpl] Apirak has protested his innocence by pointing to the fact that the deal was originally signed by the former Bangkok governor Samak Sundaravej. Apirak claims to have been forced by the ex-governor's agreement to continue the project.
