Power in Numbers is the third studio album from the alternative hip-hop group Jurassic 5 (their second on a major label).
It picks up where their previous album, Quality Control left off, with a short double bass sample playing the same riff that the last song on Quality Control, "Swing Set", ended with.
The album features a number of differing song styles. One track, "React", composed by Jurassic 5 DJ Cut Chemist, is sample-based and contains no raps. "Acetate Prophets" has the same structure, but is much longer and also features production from Jurassic 5's other DJ, DJ Nu-Mark. Many tracks start or end with a sample of speech, usually inserted by Cut Chemist. The track "DDT" is an a cappella track rapped by renowned underground emcee Kool Keith, featuring no raps by Jurassic 5 themselves. The chorus of "What's Golden" features a sample from "Prophets of Rage" by Public Enemy.

The album later had a limited re-release, which came with an accompanying DVD. The DVD consists of three featurettes on the group, one of which is a live performance.
The UK version of this re-release also included an additional track on the CD, an alternative version of the track "Thin Line", featuring MÃ½a in place of Nelly Furtado. "Thin Line" also uses a sample of the score from the Spanish sci-fi movie Pod People.
