==History==

On April 10, 2007, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted a three-year construction permit to Entravision to build a new analog television station to serve the Pueblo/Colorado Springs, Colorado market on channel 48.  It was given the call sign KVSN.  Shortly after the permit was granted, Entravision opted to build KVSN as a digital-only station and filed an application in April 2008.  KVSN commenced operations under automatic Program Test Authority on March 2, 2009, replacing Class A LPTV station KGHB-CA.[tpl]cite web |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1298740&Service=TV&Form_id=387&Facility_id=166331 |title=DTV Transition Status Report |work=FCC CDBS database |date=2009-03-04 |accessdate=2009-03-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn=101298737&formid=2&fac_num=166331 |title=Application for Digital Television Broadcast Station License |work=FCC CDBS database |date=2009-03-04 |accessdate=2009-03-12[/tpl]  Its license was granted on June 5, 2009.
