After serving three years in the U.S. Marine Corps, Johnson made his major league debut in relief on April 28, 1950, against the Philadelphia Phillies at Shibe Park.  His first big league win was also in relief, coming against the New York Giants on June 30, 1950, at the Polo Grounds.  
Johnson led Western League pitchers with a .750 winning percentage while playing for the Denver Bears in 1949. He spent part of 1950 in the Eastern League and all of [tpl]By|1951[/tpl] in the American Association before returning to the major leagues for good in [tpl]By|1952[/tpl]. He started 10 games for Boston in 1952 and then appeared almost exclusively in relief thereafter. He led American Association pitchers with a .789 winning percentage and an ERA of 2.62 while playing for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1951.
From [tpl]By|1953[/tpl] to [tpl]By|1957[/tpl], the first five years that the Braves were in Milwaukee, Johnson led the pitching staff with 175 relief appearances, an average of 35 per season.
