[[Transformative justice]]

CATEGORIES: Criminology, Justice

Transformative justice is a general philosophical strategy for responding to conflicts. It takes the principles and practices of restorative justice beyond the criminal justice system. It applies to areas such as environmental law, corporate law, labor-management relations, consumer bankruptcy and debt, and family law. Transformative justice uses a systems approach, seeking to see problems, as not only the beginning of the crime but also the causes of crime, and tries to treat an offense as a transformative relational and educational opportunity for victims, offenders and all other members of the affected community.  In theory, a transformative justice model can apply even between peoples with no prior contact.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
