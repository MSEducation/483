==History==

Known as Sunset Field before 1941, it was purchased from the county by the War Department and renamed Geiger Field after Major Harold Geiger, an Army aviation pioneer who died in a crash in 1927.
During World War II, Geiger Field was a major training base by Second Air Force as a group training airfield for B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombardment units, with new aircraft being obtained from Boeing near Seattle. It was also used by Air Technical Service Command as an aircraft maintenance and supply depot; Deer Park Airport and Felts Field were auxiliaries.
Geiger was closed in late 1945 and turned over to War Assets Administration (WAA), then transferred to Spokane County and developed into a commercial airport. The airport hosted USAF Air Defense Command interceptor units during the Cold War for air defense of Hanford Nuclear Reservation and Grand Coulee Dam. Built in 1942 as the Spokane Air Depot, Fairchild Air Force Base is four miles (7 km) to the west.
It became Spokane's municipal airport in 1946, replacing Felts Field, and received its present name in 1960, after the City of Spokane was allotted Spokane Geiger Field by the Surplus Property Act.Spokane International Airport: Frequently Asked Questions The airport code is still GEG, for Geiger Field.
The current terminal complex opened in 1965 and was designed by Warren C. Heylman and William Trogdon.Spokane Airport Terminal – Historic Preservation Department
Occasional non-stop flights to southern California since the 1970s have been among the first to be suspended during economic downturns.

==Growth and expansion==

The airport has a Master Plan,Spokane International Airport: Twenty-year Master Plan Update which includes a third runway and gates added to Concourse C.
A new control tower has been built south of the airport, replacing the one near Concourse C. The new control tower is the tallest one in the State.  The Terminal, Rotunda, and Concourse C Enhancement Project (TRACE) was recently completed, designed by Bernardo/Wills Architects, P.C.Spokane International Airport: Terminal, Rotunda, and Concourse C Enhancement Project  The project, which concluded in November 2006, added retail space and expanded security checkpoints in the airport's three concourses, and gave the Rotunda an aesthetic renovation. In 2010, 2000 feet was added to Runway 3–21, and parallel taxiways 'A' and 'G' enabling heavier aircraft departures in summer months.
The airport plans to add another concourse in the next 5–10 years and looks to add more direct flights to the east coast; the Spokane market has been hosting big events and attracting business to the area.
