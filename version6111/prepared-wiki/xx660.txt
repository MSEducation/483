Contrarily, sources may place Cyprus in the Middle East. Cyprus is the third largest and third most populous island in the Mediterranean, and a member state of the European Union. It is located south of Turkey, west of Syria and Lebanon, northwest of Israel, north of Egypt and east of Greece.
The earliest known human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium BC. Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia, and Cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8118318.stm |title=Stone Age wells found in Cyprus |publisher=BBC News |date=25 June 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2009[/tpl] Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC.

The Republic of Cyprus has de jure sovereignty over the island of Cyprus and its surrounding waters, according to international law, except for the British Overseas Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, administered as Sovereign Base Areas. However, the Republic of Cyprus is de facto partitioned into two main parts; the area under the effective control of the Republic, comprising about 59% of the island's area, and the Turkish-controlled area in the north,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/documents/sc/res/1984/scres84.htm |title=According to the United Nations Security Council Resolutions 550 and 541 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=27 March 2009[/tpl] calling itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and recognised only by Turkey, covering about 36% of the island's area.

==Etymology==

The earliest attested reference to Cyprus is the 15th-century BC Mycenaean Greek [tpl]lang|gmy|êÄìêÄ†êÄ™êÄç[/tpl], ku-pi-ri-jo,[tpl]cite book|last=Strange|first=John|title=Caphtor : Keftiu : a new investigation|year=1980|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-06256-6|page=167|url=http://books.google.gr/books?id=c9QUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA154[/tpl] meaning "Cypriot" (Greek: [tpl]lang|grc|ŒöœçœÄœÅŒπŒøœÇ[/tpl]), written in Linear B syllabic script.Palaeolexicon, Word study tool of ancient languages
The classical Greek form of the name is [tpl]lang|grc|ŒöœçœÄœÅŒøœÇ K√Ωpros[/tpl].
The etymology of the name is unknown.
Suggestions include:
Through overseas trade, the island has given its name to the Classical Latin word for copper through the phrase aes Cyprium, "metal of Cyprus", later shortened to Cuprum.Fisher, Fred H. Cyprus: Our New Colony And What We Know About It. London: George Routledge and Sons 1878, pp. 13‚Äì14.
Cyprus, more specifically the seashore at Paphos, was also one of the birthplaces given in Greek mythology for Aphrodite, who was known as K√Ωpria. This was because Astarte, goddess of love and beauty in Phoenician mythology, for whom Cyprus was an important cult centre, was later identified with Aphrodite.
The standard demonym relating to Cyprus or its people or culture is Cypriot. The terms Cypriote and Cyprian are also used, though less frequently.

==History==

===Prehistoric and Ancient Cyprus===

The earliest confirmed site of human activity on Cyprus is Aetokremnos, situated on the south coast, indicating that hunter-gatherers were active on the island from around 10,000 BC,Mithen, S. After the Ice: A Global Human History, 20000 BC‚Äì5000 BC. Boston: Harvard University Press 2005, p.97. http://books.google.com/books?id=NVygmardAA4C&pg=PA97 with settled village communities dating from 8200 BC.

During the late Bronze Age the island experienced two waves of Greek settlement.Thomas, Carol G. and Conant, Craig: The Trojan War, pages 121‚Äì122. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005. ISBN 0-313-32526-X, 9780313325267.

Cyprus was ruled by Assyria for a century starting in 708¬†BC, before a brief spell under Egyptian rule and eventually Persian rule in 545¬†BC. The Cypriots, led by Onesilus, king of Salamis, joined their fellow Greeks in the Ionian cities during the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt in 499¬†BC against the Achaemenid Empire. The revolt was suppressed, but Cyprus managed to maintain a high degree of autonomy and remained oriented towards the Greek world.
The island was conquered by Alexander the Great in 333¬†BC. Following his death and the subsequent division of his empire among his successors, Cyprus became part of the Hellenistic empire of Ptolemaic Egypt. It was during this period that the island was fully Hellenized. In 58¬†BC Cyprus was acquired by the Roman Republic.

===Middle Ages===

When the Roman Empire was divided into Eastern and Western parts in 395, Cyprus became part of the East Roman, or Byzantine Empire, and would remain so until the Crusades some 800 years later. Under Byzantine rule, the Greek orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong Hellenistic-Christian character that continues to be a hallmark of the Greek Cypriot community.
Beginning in 649, Cyprus suffered from devastating raids launched by Arab armies from the Levant, which continued for the next 300 years. Many were quick piratical raids, but others were large-scale attacks in which many Cypriots were slaughtered and great wealth carried off or destroyed.
There are no Byzantine churches which survive from this period; thousands of people were killed, and many cities ‚Äì such as Salamis ‚Äì were destroyed and never rebuilt. Byzantine rule was restored in 965, when Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas scored decisive victories on land and sea.
In 1191, during the Third Crusade, Richard I of England captured the island from Isaac Komnenos of CyprusRiddle, J.M. A History of the Middle Ages. Lanham, MD, USA: Rowman & Littlefield 2008. p. 326. http://books.google.com/books?id=rhWpPr93KjMC&pg=PA326 He used it as a major supply base that was relatively safe from the Saracens. A year later Richard sold the island to the Knights Templar, who, following a bloody revolt, in turn sold it to Guy of Lusignan. His brother and successor Amalric was recognized as King of Cyprus by Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor.
Following the death in 1473 of James II, the last Lusignan king, the Republic of Venice assumed control of the island, while the late king's Venetian widow, Queen Catherine Cornaro, reigned as figurehead. Venice formally annexed Cyprus in 1489, following the abdication of Catherine. The Venetians fortified Nicosia by building the Venetian Walls, and used it as an important commercial hub. Throughout Venetian rule, the Ottoman Empire frequently raided Cyprus. In 1539 the Ottomans destroyed Limassol and so fearing the worst, the Venetians also fortified Famagusta and Kyrenia.
During the almost four centuries of Latin rule, there existed two societies on Cyprus. The first consisted of Frankish nobles and their retinue, as well as Italian merchants and their families. The second, the majority of the population, consisted of Greek Cypriots, serfs and labourers. Although a determined effort was made to supplant native traditions and culture, the effort failed.

===Cyprus under the Ottoman Empire===

In 1570, a full scale Ottoman assault with 60,000 troops brought the island under Ottoman control, despite stiff resistance by the inhabitants of Nicosia and Famagusta. The previous Latin elite were destroyed and the first significant demographic change since antiquity took place when Ottoman Janissaries were settled on the island.[tpl]cite book | last = Mallinson | first = William | title = Cyprus: A Modern History | publisher = I.

The Ottomans abolished the feudal system previously in place and applied the millet system to Cyprus, under which non-Muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities. In a reversal from the days of Latin rule, the head of the Church of Cyprus was invested as leader of the Greek Cypriot population and acted as mediator between Christian Greek Cypriots and the Ottoman authorities. This status ensured that the Church of Cyprus was in a position to end the constant encroachments of the Roman Catholic Church. Ottoman rule of Cyprus was at times indifferent, at times oppressive, depending on the temperaments of the sultans and local officials, and during this period the island fell into economic decline.Cyprus ‚Äì OTTOMAN RULE, U.S. Library of Congress

Reaction to Ottoman misrule led to uprisings by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, although none were successful. By 1872, the population of the island had risen to 144,000 comprising 44,000 Muslims and 100,000 Christians.Osmanli Nufusu 1830‚Äì1914 by Kemal Karpat, ISBN 975-333-169-X and Die V√∂lker des Osmanischen by Ritter zur Helle von Samo. Centuries of neglect by the Turks, the unrelenting poverty of most of the people, and the ever-present tax collectors fuelled Greek nationalism, and by the 20th century the idea of enosis, or union, with newly independent Greece was firmly rooted among Greek Cypriots.

===Cyprus under the British Empire===

In the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) and the Congress of Berlin, Cyprus was leased to the British Empire which de facto took over its administration in 1878 (though, in terms of sovereignty, it remained a de jure Ottoman territory until 1914, together with Egypt and Sudan) in exchange for guarantees that Britain would use the island as a base to protect the Ottoman Empire against possible Russian aggression.
The island would serve Britain as a key military base for its colonial routes. By 1906, when the Famagusta harbour was completed, Cyprus was a strategic naval outpost overlooking the Suez Canal, the crucial main route to India which was then Britain's most important overseas possession. Following the outbreak of World War I and the decision of the Ottoman Empire to join the war on the side of the Central Powers, the British Empire formally annexed Cyprus, Egypt and Sudan on 5 November 1914 in response.
In 1915, Britain offered Cyprus to Constantine I of Greece on condition that Greece join the war on the side of the British, which he declined. In 1923, under the Treaty of Lausanne, the nascent Turkish republic relinquished any claim to Cyprus,[tpl]cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title='Cypriot Muslims among Ottomans, Turks and British|journal=Bogazici Journal|year=2011|volume=25|issue=2|pages=109‚Äì120|url=http://www.bujournal.boun.edu.tr/docs/13330942935.pdf|accessdate=15 October 2012[/tpl] and in 1925 it was declared a British crown colony.

===Independence and ensuant intercommunal violence===

On 16 August 1960, Cyprus attained independence after the Z√ºrich and London Agreement between the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey. The UK retained the two Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, while government posts and public offices were allocated by ethnic quotas, giving the minority Turkish Cypriots a permanent veto, 30% in parliament and administration, and granting the three mother-states guarantor rights.
In 1963, inter-communal violence broke out, partially sponsored by both "motherlands". As a result, Turkish Cypriots were forced into enclaves and Cypriot President Archbishop Makarios III called for unilateral constitutional changes as a means to ease tensions over the whole island. The United Nations deployed forces in Cyprus (UNFICYP) at flash points.[tpl]cite book |author= Hoffmeister, Frank |title= Legal aspects of the Cyprus problem: Annan Plan and EU accession |publisher= EMartinus Nijhoff Publishers|year= 2006 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=LZXbg3ZwvGoC&dq= | pages = 17‚Äì20 |isbn= 978-90-04-15223-6[/tpl]

===1974 coup, Turkish invasion and division===

On 15 July 1974, the Greek military junta under Dimitrios Ioannides carried out a coup d'√©tat in Cyprus, to unite the island with Greece. The coup ousted president Makarios III and replaced him with pro-enosis nationalist Nikos Sampson.[tpl]Cite journal |title=CYPRUS: Big Troubles over a Small Island |date=29 July 1974|journal=TIME |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911440,00.html [/tpl] Five days later, on 20 July 1974, the Turkish army invaded the island on the pretext of restoring the constitutional order of the Republic of Cyprus by claiming a right to intervene as one of the guarantors of the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee.
The Turkish air force began bombing Greek positions on Cyprus, and hundreds of paratroops were dropped in the area between Nicosia and Kyrenia, where well-armed Turkish Cypriot enclaves had been long-established; while off the Kyrenia coast, 30 Turkish troop ships protected by destroyers landed 6,000 men as well as tanks, trucks and armoured vehicles.
Three days later, when a ceasefire had been agreed, Turkey had landed 30,000 troops on the island and captured Kyrenia, the corridor linking Kyrenia to Nicosia, and Turkish Cypriot quarter of Nicosia itself. The junta in Athens, and then the Sampson regime in Cyprus fell from power. In Nicosia, Glafkos Clerides assumed the presidency and constitutional order was restored, removing the pretext for the Turkish invasion. But during the peace negotiations in Geneva, the Turkish government reinforced their Kyrenia bridgehead and prepared for a second invasion. The invasion began on 14 August and resulted in the seizure of Morphou, Karpass, Famagusta and the Mesaoria. The Greek-Cypriot forces were unable to resist the Turkish advance.

==Geography==

Cyprus is the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after the Italian islands of Sicily and Sardinia (both in terms of area and population). It is also the world's 81st largest by area and world's 51st largest by population. It measures [tpl]convert|240|km|mi|0[/tpl] long from end to end and [tpl]convert|100|km|mi|0[/tpl] wide at its widest point, with Turkey [tpl]convert|75|km|mi|0[/tpl] to the north. It lies between latitudes 34¬∞ and 36¬∞ N, and longitudes 32¬∞ and 35¬∞ E.
Other neighbouring territories include Syria and Lebanon to the east ([tpl]convert|105|and|108|km|mi|0[/tpl], respectively), Israel [tpl]convert|200|km|mi|0[/tpl] to the southeast, Egypt [tpl]convert|380|km|mi|0[/tpl] to the south, and Greece to the northwest: [tpl]convert|280|km|mi|0[/tpl] to the small Dodecanesian island of Kastelorizo (Megisti), [tpl]convert|400|km|mi|0[/tpl] to Rhodes and [tpl]convert|800|km|mi|0[/tpl] to the Greek mainland.
The physical relief of the island is dominated by two mountain ranges, the Troodos Mountains and the smaller Kyrenia Range, and the central plain they encompass, the Mesaoria. The Mesaoria plain is drained by the Pedieos River, the longest on the island. The Troodos Mountains cover most of the southern and western portions of the island and account for roughly half its area. The highest point on Cyprus is Mount Olympus at [tpl]convert|1952|m|abbr=on[/tpl], located in the centre of the Troodos range. The narrow Kyrenia Range, extending along the northern coastline, occupies substantially less area, and elevations are lower, reaching a maximum of [tpl]convert|1024|m|abbr=on[/tpl].
Geopolitically, the island is subdivided into four main segments. The Republic of Cyprus occupies the southern two-thirds of the island (59.74%). The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus occupies the northern third (34.85%), and the United Nations-controlled Green Line provides a buffer zone that separates the two and covers 2.67% of the island. Lastly, two bases under British sovereignty are located on the island: Akrotiri and Dhekelia, covering the remaining 2.74%.

===Water supply===

Cyprus suffers from a shortage of water. The country relies heavily on rain to provide household water, and for many years now the average annual rainfall seems to be decreasing. Between 2001 and 2004, exceptionally heavy annual rainfall pushed water reserves up, with supply exceeding demand, allowing total storage in the island's reservoirs to rise to an all-time high by the start of 2005.
However, since then demand has increased annually ‚Äì a result of local population growth, foreigners moving to Cyprus and the number of visiting tourists ‚Äì while supply has fallen. Cyprus has a total of 107 dams (plus one currently under construction) and reservoirs, with a total water storage capacity of about [tpl]convert|330000000|m3|-9|abbr=on[/tpl].Dams of Cyprus Water Development Department, Republic of Cyprus.
Dams remain the principal source of water both for domestic and agricultural use. Water desalination plants are gradually being constructed to deal with recent years of prolonged drought.
The Government has invested heavily in the creation of water desalination plants which have supplied almost 50 per cent of domestic water since 2001. Efforts have also been made to raise public awareness of the situation and to encourage domestic water users to take more responsibility for the conservation of this increasingly scarce commodity.

==Politics==

Cyprus is a presidential republic. The head of state and of the government is elected by a process of universal suffrage for a five-year term. Executive power is exercised by the government with legislative power vested in the House of Representatives whilst the Judiciary is independent of both the executive and the legislature.
The 1960 Constitution provided for a presidential system of government with independent executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as a complex system of checks and balances including a weighted power-sharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the Turkish Cypriots. The executive was led by a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president elected by their respective communities for five-year terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions. Legislative power rested on the House of Representatives who were also elected on the basis of separate voters' rolls.
Since 1965, following clashes between the two communities, the Turkish Cypriot seats in the House remain vacant. Turkish Cypriots refused to establish the state of affairs before the invasion of Cyprus as is evident in the Secretary-General of the United Nations who said "The Turkish Cypriot leaders have adhered to a rigid stand against any measures which might involve having members of the two communities live and work together, or which might place Turkish Cypriots in situations where they would have to acknowledge the authority of Government agents. Indeed, since the Turkish Cypriot leadership is committed to physical and geographical separation of the communities as a political goal, it is not likely to encourage activities by Turkish Cypriots which may be interpreted as demonstrating the merits of an alternative policy.Quotation from 1965 in a report submitted by Cyprus in the framework of the Convention for the Protection of National Minorities citing [tpl]Wayback |date=20090125115646 |url=http://www.humanrights.coe.int/minorities/eng/FrameworkConvention/StateReports/1999/cyprus/B.htm |title=United Nations Secretary General Report S/6426[/tpl] Quote: "10. Despite this policy, a certain degree of normality gradually returned to Cyprus and with the active encouragement of the Government, by 1974 a large proportion of Turkish Cypriots were living and working alongside with their Greek Cypriot fellow citizens." via Internet Archive Retrieved 1 June 2011 By 1974 the two communities had returned to a more tolerant state of living.
In 1974 Cyprus was divided de facto when the Turkish army occupied the northern third of the island. The Turkish Cypriots subsequently declared independence in 1983 as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus but were recognized only by Turkey. In 1985 the TRNC adopted a constitution and held its first elections. The United Nations recognises the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island of Cyprus.
The House of Representatives currently has 59 members elected for a five-year term, 56 members by proportional representation and 3 observer members representing the Armenian, Latin and Maronite minorities. 24 seats are allocated to the Turkish community but remain vacant since 1964. The political environment is dominated by the communist AKEL, the liberal conservative Democratic Rally, the centrist[tpl]cite web|author=DotNetNuke |url=http://www.diko.org.cy/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=24 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070611174508/http://www.diko.org.cy/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=24 |archivedate=11 June 2007 |title=ŒôŒ¥ŒµŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒîŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒÆœÅœÖŒæŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫Œøœç ŒöœåŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ |publisher=Diko.org.cy |accessdate=6 January 2009[/tpl] Democratic Party, the social-democratic EDEK and the centrist EURO.KO.
On 17 February 2008 Dimitris Christofias of the AKEL was elected President of Cyprus, on AKEL's first electoral victory without being part of a wider coalition. Christofias took over government from Tassos Papadopoulos of the Democratic Party who had been in office since February 2003.

===Administrative divisions===

The Republic of Cyprus is divided into six districts:[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/abc/maps/members/cyprus_en.htm |title=EUROPA ‚Äì The EU at a glance ‚Äì Maps ‚Äì Cyprus |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=27 March 2009[/tpl] Nicosia, Famagusta, Kyrenia, Larnaca, Limassol and Paphos. These are not the same as those of Northern Cyprus.

===Exclaves and enclaves===

Cyprus has four exclaves, all in territory that belongs to the British Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia. The first two are the villages of Ormidhia and Xylotymvou. The third is the Dhekelia Power Station which is divided by a British road into two parts. The northern part is an exclave, like the two villages, whereas the southern part is located by the sea and therefore not an exclave although it has no territorial waters of its own.[tpl]cite web|url=http://geosite.jankrogh.com/dhekelia.htm|title=Dhekelia |publisher=Geosite.jankrogh.com |date=  30 January 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2013[/tpl]
The UN buffer zone runs up against Dhekelia and picks up again from its east side off Ayios Nikolaos and is connected to the rest of Dhekelia by a thin land corridor. In that sense the buffer zone turns the Paralimni area on the southeast corner of the island into a de facto, though not de jure, exclave.

===Foreign relations===

The Republic of Cyprus is a member of the following international groups: Australia Group, CN, CE, CFSP, EBRD, EIB, EU, FAO, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICC, ICCt, ITUC, IDA, IFAD, IFC, IHO, ILO, IMF, IMO, Interpol, IOC, IOM, IPU, ITU, MIGA, NAM, NSG, OPCW, OSCE, PCA, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNHCR, UNIDO, UPU, WCL, WCO, WFTU, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WToO, WTO.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cy.html |title=CIA ‚Äì The World Factbook ‚Äì Cyprus |publisher=Cia.gov |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=6 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/archives/enlargement_process/past_enlargements/eu10/cyprus_en.htm |title=European Commission ‚Äì Enlargement: Archives Country Profiles |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=6 January 2009[/tpl]

===Human rights===

In "Freedom in the World 2011", Freedom House rated the democracy of Cyprus as "free".Freedom in the World 2011 Report > Cyprus. Retrieved 28 June 2013. Also, page 29. The constant focus on the division of the island can sometimes mask other human rights issues. Prostitution has been described as rife in both the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish-controlled regions leading to criticism from the United States government for their alleged lack of controls on the sex trade and for the role of Cyprus as one of the main destinations for human trafficking from Eastern Europe.
The recent assassination of leftist musician Pavlos Fyssas in Athens, Greece, allegedly by a militant of Golden Dawn, arouse concerns in Cyprus that rising extremism is not being adequately addressed in the country.

==Economy==

The Cypriot economy has diversified and become prosperous in recent years. However, in 2012 it became affected by the Eurozone financial and banking crisis. In June 2012, the Cypriot government announced it would need ‚Ç¨[tpl]Nowrap|1.8 billion[/tpl] of foreign aid to support the Cyprus Popular Bank, and this was followed by Fitch downgrading Cyprus's credit rating to junk status.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18577983 |title=Cyprus's credit rating cut to junk status by Fitch |author= |date=25 June 2012 |work= |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=25 June 2012[/tpl] Fitch said Cyprus would need an additional ‚Ç¨[tpl]Nowrap|4 billion[/tpl] to support its banks and the downgrade was mainly due to the exposure of Bank of Cyprus, Cyprus Popular Bank and Hellenic Bank, Cyprus's three largest banks, to the Greek financial crisis.
The 2012‚Äì2013 Cypriot financial crisis led to an agreement with the Eurogroup in March 2013 to split the country's second largest bank, the Cyprus Popular Bank (also known as Laiki Bank), into a "bad" bank which would be wound down over time and a "good" bank which would be absorbed by the Bank of Cyprus. In return for a ‚Ç¨10 billion bailout from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the Cypriot government would be required to impose a significant haircut on uninsured deposits, a large proportion of which were held by wealthy Russians who used Cyprus as a tax haven. Insured deposits of ‚Ç¨100,000 or less would not be affected.[tpl]cite web|title=Eurogroup Statement on Cyprus|url=http://eurozone.europa.eu/newsroom/news/2013/03/eg-statement-cyprus-25-03-13/|publisher=Eurogroup|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=25 March 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |author=Jan Strupczewski |author2=Annika Breidthardt |title=Last-minute Cyprus deal to close bank, force losses |publisher=Reuters |date=25 March 2013 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/us-cyprus-parliament-idUSBRE92G03I20130325 |accessdate=25 March 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Eurogroup signs off on bailout agreement reached by Cyprus and troika |newspaper=Ekathimerini |location=Greece |date=25 March 2013 |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_25/03/2013_489702 |accessdate=25 March 2013[/tpl]

Added to this is the capital growth in property that has been created from the demand of incoming investors and property buyers to the island.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.apropertyincyprus.com/cyprus/ |title=Growth in tourism has stimulated the property market in Cyprus |accessdate=15 December 2008 |date=10 November 2008 |publisher=apropertyincyprus.com |work=Property Abroad[/tpl] In late 2013, the Cyprus Town Planning Department announced a series of incentives to help ignite the property market and further drive growth in new-built property developments in town centres across the country.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.urbansplash.com.cy/urban_splash_news.asp?ID=19 |title=New Incentives for Town Centres in Cyprus|accessdate=11 October 2013 |date=7 March 2014 |publisher=urbansplash.com.cy |work=Cyprus real Estate[/tpl] This followed earlier measures for new and faster immigration permits to third country nationals investing in Cyprus property.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.urbansplash.com.cy/urban_splash_news.asp?ID=6 |title=Immigration Permits for Investors in Cyprus |accessdate=16 April 2013 |date=7 March 2014 |publisher=urbansplash.com.cy |work=Cyprus real Estate[/tpl]

===Transport===

Available modes of transport are by road, sea and air. Of the [tpl]convert|10663|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] of roads in the Republic of Cyprus in 1998, [tpl]convert|6249|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] were paved, and [tpl]convert|4414|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] were unpaved. In 1996 the Turkish-occupied area had a similar ratio of paved to unpaved, with approximately [tpl]convert|1370|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] of paved road and [tpl]convert|980|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] unpaved. Cyprus is one of only four EU nations in which vehicles drive on the left-hand side of the road, a remnant of British colonisation (the others being Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom).
There are several modern motorways in Cyprus. A series of motorways runs along the coast from Paphos east to Ayia Napa, with two motorways running inland to Nicosia, one from Limassol and one from Larnaca.
Per capita private car ownership is the 29th-highest in the world.[tpl]cite web |url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.VEH.NVEH.P3 |title=World Bank Data: Motor vehicles (per 1,000 people) |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=27 August 2011 [/tpl] There were approximately 344,000 privately owned vehicles, and a total of 517,000 registered motor vehicles in the Republic of Cyprus in 2006.Public Works Department official statistics, Dead link at Mcw.gov.cy, 24 March 2006. Accessed: 25 October 2009. In 2006 extensive plans were announced to improve and expand bus services and restructure public transport throughout Cyprus, with the financial backing of the European Union Development Bank. In 2010 the new revised and expanded bus network was implemented.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyprusbybus.com/|title=Cyprus By Bus|work=Cyprus By Bus|accessdate=16 February 2011[/tpl]
Cyprus has several heliports and two international airports: Larnaca International Airport and Paphos International Airport. A third airport, Ercan International Airport operates in the Turkish Cypriot administered area with direct flights only to Turkey (Turkish Cypriot ports are closed to international traffic apart from Turkey). Nicosia International Airport has been closed since 1974.
The main harbours of the island are Limassol and Larnaca, which service cargo, passenger and cruise ships.

===Communications===

Cyta, the state-owned telecommunications company, manages most telecommunications and Internet connections on the island. However, following the recent liberalization of the sector, a few private telecommunications companies have emerged including MTN, Cablenet, OTEnet Telecom, Omega Telecom and PrimeTel. In the Turkish-controlled area of Cyprus, three companies are also present: Turkcell, KKTC Telsim and Turk Telekom.

According to the first population census after the declaration of independence, carried out in December 1960 and covering the entire island, Cyprus had a total population of 573,566; of whom 442,138 (77.1%) were Greeks, 104,320 (18.2%) Turkish, and 27,108 (4.7%) others.Hatay, Mete "Is the Turkish Cypriot Population Shrinking?", International Peace Research Institute, 2007.

Due to the inter-communal ethnic tensions between 1963 and 1974, an island-wide census was regarded as impossible. Nevertheless, the Greek Cypriots conducted one in 1973, without the Turkish Cypriot populace.[tpl]cite book |last=St John-Jones|first=L.W.|year=1983|title=The Population of Cyprus: Demographic Trends and Socio-Economic Influences|place=London|publisher=Maurice Temple Smith Ltd|page=17|isbn=0-85117-232-6[/tpl] According to this census, the Greek Cypriot population was 482,000. One year later, in 1974, the Cypriot government's Department of Statistics and Research estimated the total population of Cyprus at 641,000; of whom 506,000 (78.9%) were Greeks, and 118,000 (18.4%) Turkish.[tpl]cite web |author=Cyprus Ministry of Interior|year=1992|title=The Demographic Structure of Cyprus|url=http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/pio/pio.nsf/All/20C7614D06858E9FC2256DC200380113/$file/cuco%20report.pdf?OpenElement|publisher=Parliamentary Assembly|page=6[/tpl] After the partition of the island in 1974, Greeks conducted four more censuses: in 1976, 1982, 1992 and 2001; these excluded the Turkish population which was resident in the northern part of the island.
According to the Republic of Cyprus's latest estimate, in 2005, the number of Cypriot citizens currently living in the Republic of Cyprus is around 871,036.

The villages of Potamia (Nicosia district) and Pyla in the Larnaca District are the only settlements in the Republic of Cyprus with a mixed Greek and Turkish Cypriot population.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
Y-Dna haplogroups are found at the following frequencies in Cyprus: J (43.07% including 6.20% J1), E1b1b (20.00%), R1 (12.30% including 9.2% R1b), F (9.20%), I (7.70%), K (4.60%), A (3.10%).(n=65), [tpl]cite pmid|16626331[/tpl] J, K, F and E1b1b haplogroups consist of lineages with differential distribution within Middle East, North Africa and Europe while R1 and I are typical in West European populations.
Outside Cyprus there is a significant and thriving Greek Cypriot diaspora and Turkish Cypriot diaspora in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the United States, Greece and Turkey.

===Religion===

Almost all Greek Cypriots are members of the autocephalous Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyprus.gov.cy/portal/portal.nsf/All/817E9279C04E4480C2257023002B858C?OpenDocument|title=About Cyprus ‚Äì Towns and Population|work=Government Web Portal ‚Äì Areas of Interest|publisher=Government of Cyprus|accessdate=9 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cytoc.html|title=A Country Study: Cyprus|last=Solsten|first=Eric|date=January 1991|work=Federal Research Division|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=9 February 2010[/tpl] whereas most Turkish Cypriots are adherents of Sunni Islam.
