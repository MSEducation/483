Parcheesi is a brand name American adaptation of the Indian Cross and Circle game Pachisi. Created in India perhaps as early as 500 AD, the board game is subtitled Royal Game of India because royalty played by using servants of the royal household adorned in colored-costumes as pieces on large outdoor  boards.[ref]
