Now housed in the Historic Cowtown Coliseum in the Fort Worth Stockyards. The organization, dedicated to the sport of rodeo and the recognition of Texas' contribution to that sport, the TRCHF was founded in 1975 by Johnny Boren and a group of Belton, Texas, businessmen. Boren was the manager of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) Lone Star Circuit, the biggest circuit in Prorodeo's circuit system. Johnny Boren, a Ford automobile dealer in Belton, frequently had world champion cowboys across the desk from him at his dealership. Autographed photos of world champs adorned both his office and his home. He was a well-known bull rider and founder of the Old Timers Rodeo Association.
The Hall of Fame was first housed in several spots in the Belton-area, including a western wear store. Eventually, the Hall of Fame moved to the Bell County Expo Center in Belton, only a block or so away from the Ford dealership where it was born.
They currently have an induction ceremony usually in March or April, that takes place at the Bell County Expo Center in Belton, Texas every year.
The Hall of Fame is currently run by a Board Of Directors from all over the state of Texas. Funds are currently being raised for a permanent Hall of Fame building in Belton. The Hall contains pictures and biographies of famous Texas rodeo cowboys who helped to shape the sport from its inception until the present.
In 2005, the Hall of Fame inducted as members the former rodeo performer and promoter Dan Collins Taylor of Doole, Texas, and his wife, the Berva Dawn Sorensen Taylor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wyomingnews.com/articles/2011/07/19/news/20local_07-19-11.txt|title=Becky Orr, "Cowboy was boss of Chute 9 at CFD for 49 years''|publisher=wyomingnews.com|accessdate=August 4, 2011[/tpl]
