The Long Island Rail Road [tpl]Reporting mark|LI[/tpl] or LIRR is a commuter rail system in New York, stretching from Manhattan to the eastern tip of Suffolk County on Long Island. It is the busiest commuter railroad in North America, serving nearly 335,000 passengers daily.[tpl]citation | url = http://www.apta.com/resources/statistics/Documents/Ridership/2013-q1-ridership-APTA.pdf | title = TRANSIT RIDERSHIP REPORT: First Quarter 2013 | date = 24 May 2013 | publisher = American Public Transportation Association | first = Matthew | last = Dickens | accessdate = 3 January 2014[/tpl] Established in 1834 and having operated continuously since then, it is the oldest U.S. railroad still operating under its original name and charter.[tpl]cite web|title=LIRR History|url=http://www.mta.info/lirr/Video/175thAnniversary/|publisher=mta.info|accessdate=2013-03-01[/tpl]  There are 124 stations, and more than [tpl]convert|700|mi|km[/tpl] of track,[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/lirr/about/GeneralInformation/ |title=Long Island Rail Road - General Information |publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23[/tpl] on its two lines to the two forks of the island and eight major branches, with the passenger railroad system totaling about 315 route-miles.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] It is publicly owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, as MTA Long Island Rail Road. The current LIRR logo combines the circular MTA logo with the text Long Island Rail Road, and appears on the sides of trains. The LIRR is one of two commuter rail systems owned by the MTA; the other one is Metro-North Railroad.
The LIRR is the only commuter passenger railroad in the United States to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with significant off peak, weekend, and holiday service.

==History==

The Long Island Rail Road Company was chartered in 1834 to provide a daily service between New York and Boston via a ferry connection between its Greenport, New York, terminal on Long Island's North Fork and Stonington, Connecticut. This service was superseded in 1849 by the land route through Connecticut that became part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The LIRR refocused its attentions towards serving Long Island, in competition with other railroads on the island. In the 1870s railroad president Conrad Poppenhusen and his successor Austin Corbin acquired all the railroads and consolidated them into the LIRR.[tpl]Citation needed|date = May 2013[/tpl]
The LIRR was unprofitable for much of its history. In 1900, the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) bought a controlling interest as part of its plan for direct access to Manhattan which commenced on September 8, 1910. The wealthy PRR subsidized the LIRR during the first half of the new century, allowing much expansion and modernization.[tpl]citation needed|date = May 2013[/tpl]
By the end of the Second World War the downturn in the railroad industry and dwindling profits caused the PRR to stop subsidizing the LIRR, and the LIRR went into receivership in 1949. The State of New York, realizing how important the railroad was to the future of Long Island, began to subsidize the railroad in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1966, New York State bought the railroad's controlling stock from the PRR and put it under the newly formed Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority (renamed Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1968).  With MTA subsidies, the LIRR modernized further and grew into the busiest commuter railroad in the United States.[tpl]Citation needed|date = May 2013[/tpl]
The LIRR is one of the few railroads that has survived as an intact company from its original charter to the present day.

==Major stations==

The LIRR operates out of three western terminals, in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. Jamaica Station in central Queens is the hub of all railroad activities. Expansion of the system into Grand Central Terminal is anticipated over the next few years. Major stations include:

==Passenger lines and services==

The Long Island Rail Road system is made up of eleven passenger branches. Three main trunk lines, the Main Line, Montauk Branch, and Atlantic Branch, spin off eight smaller branches. For scheduling and advertising purposes some of these branches are further divided into sections such as the case with the Montauk Branch, which is known as the Babylon Branch service in the electrified portion of the line between Jamaica and Babylon, while the diesel service beyond Babylon to Montauk is referred to as the Montauk Branch service. All branches except the Port Washington Branch pass through Jamaica; the trackage west of Jamaica (except to Port Washington) is known as the City Terminal Zone. The City Terminal Zone includes portions of the Main Line and Atlantic and Montauk Branches as well as the Amtrak-owned East River Tunnels to Penn Station. The passenger lines are:

===Former branches===

The railroad has dropped a number of branches due to lack of ridership over the years. Some of these lines became part of the IND Rockaway Line of the New York City Subway, while others were downgraded to freight branches, and the rest abandoned entirely.

===Additional services===

In addition to its daily commuter patronage, the LIRR also offers the following services:

==Fare structure==

Like Metro-North Railroad and New Jersey Transit, the Long Island Rail Road fare system is based on the distance a passenger travels, as opposed to the New York City Subway, which has a flat rate throughout the system. The railroad is broken up into eight numbered fare zones. Zone 1 includes all of the city terminals and stations west of Jamaica. Zone 3 includes Jamaica and all stations east of Jamaica within the boundaries of New York City, except Far Rockaway and Belmont Park. Zones 4 and 7 include all the stations in Nassau County and Far Rockaway.  Zones 9, 10, 12, and 14 includes all the stations in Suffolk County. Each zone contains many stations, and the same fare applies for travel between any station in the origin zone and any station in the destination zone.
Peak fares are charged during the week on trains that arrive at western terminals between 6 am and 10 am, and for trains that depart from western terminals between 4 pm and 8 pm. Any passenger holding an off peak ticket on a peak train is required to pay a step up fee. Passengers can buy tickets from ticket agents or ticket vending machines (TVMs) or on the train from conductors, but will incur an on-board penalty fee for doing so. This fee is waived for senior citizens and disabled passengers and for passengers who board from stations where there are no ticket offices or TVMs.
There are several types of tickets: one way, round trip, peak, off-peak, AM peak or off-peak senior/citizen disabled, peak child, and off-peak child. On off-peak trains, passengers can buy a family ticket for children who are accompanied by a 18 year old for $0.75 if bought from the station agent or TVM, $1.00 on the train. Senior citizen/disabled passengers traveling during the morning peak hours are required to pay the AM peak senior citizen/disabled rate. This rate is not charged during PM peak hours.
Commuters can also buy a peak or off-peak ten trip ride, a weekly unlimited or an unlimited monthly pass. Monthly passes are good on any train regardless of the time of day, within the fare zones specified on the pass.
On weekends, the railroad offers a special reduced-fare CityTicket, introduced in 2004,[tpl]cite press release |publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority |date=2004-01-09 |title=CityTicket Begins Tomorrow on LIRR And Metro-North |url=http://mta.info/mta/news/releases/?en=040109 |accessdate=2010-02-14[/tpl] for passengers who travel within Zones 1 and 3 (i.e. within New York City). CityTickets can only be bought from ticket agents or machines and used on the day of purchase. They are not valid for travel to Far Rockaway because it is in Zone 4 and the Far Rockaway Branch passes through Nassau County. It is also not valid for travel to the Belmont Park station, which is only open for special events. All passengers going to Belmont Park must buy a special ticket to go from Jamaica to Belmont Park (or vice versa), as weekly and monthly passes are not accepted at Belmont Park.
During the summer the railroad offers special summer package ticket deals to places such as Long Beach, Jones Beach, the Hamptons, Montauk, and Greenport. Passengers traveling to the Hamptons and Montauk on the Cannonball can reserve a seat in the all-reserved Parlor Cars. The LIRR suggests booking in advance based on limited availability.

==Train operations==

The LIRR is relatively isolated from the rest of the national rail system. In only two locations does it connect with other railroads:
West of Harold Interlocking in Sunnyside, Queens LIRR trains enter Amtrak territory (the Northeast Corridor) leading to the East River Tunnels. When this track was owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad, trains of the PRR connected to the LIRR at Penn Station. During the 1920s and 1930s a through sleeper was carried by PRR and LIRR trains from Pittsburgh to Montauk.May 1927 Sunrise Special timetable (Arrt's Arrchives)
In Glendale, Queens the LIRR connects with CSX’s Fremont Secondary, which leads to the Hell Gate Bridge and New England, however, once trains leave the secondary they enter LIRR territory and fall under the guidance of the LIRR Book of Rules.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
All movements on the LIRR are under the control of the Movement Bureau in Jamaica, which gives orders to the towers that control a specific portion of the railroad. Movements in Amtrak territory are controlled by Penn Station Control Center or PSCC, run jointly by the LIRR and Amtrak. The PSCC controls as far east as Harold interlocking, in the Sunnyside area of Queens. The PSCC replaced several towers. The Jamaica Control Center (new in the third quarter of 2010) controls from there east through the Jamaica terminal by direct control of interlockings. This replaced several towers in Jamaica including Jay and Hall towers at the west and east ends of Jamaica station respectively. East of there, lineside towers control the various switches and signals under the direction of the dispatchers in Jamaica.Bedia, Leigh. “LIRR Jamaica Station Control Center.” Railpace January 2011 : P. 10.
Nearly all the lines and all passenger rolling stock is equipped for cab signalling, which displays the block signal governing movement of trains in the cab. All passenger rolling stock is equipped with Automatic Speed Control (ASC), which enforces the speed limit dictated by the cab signal if the engineer fails to comply with it, by a penalty brake application. This feature greatly enhances safety.
On many of the lines, there are no intermediate wayside signals between the interlockings: operation is solely by cab signal. Wayside signals remain at interlockings.

==Power transmission==

The LIRR's electrified lines are powered by 750 V DC third rail with the contact shoe running along the top of the rail, similar to the New York City Subway and PATH trains. Metro-North Railroad uses under-running third rail on its electrified trackage and overhead catenary on the New Haven Line.  New Jersey Transit's electrified rail lines are powered by overhead catenary.

==Equipment==

The LIRR operates 836 M7 and 170 M3 electric multiple unit cars in married pairs, meaning each car needs the other one to operate, with each car containing its own engineer's cab. Typical consists range from a minimum of 6 cars to a maximum of 12 cars.
The railroad uses 134 C3 bilevel rail cars powered by 23 DE30AC diesel-electric locomotives and 22 DM30AC dual-mode locomotives.Consultant's assessment of the LIRR, Page 21
In September 2013, MTA announced that the LIRR would procure new M9 railcars from Kawasaki.MTA Press Release, September 19, 2013

==Named trains==

Despite serving a commuter patronage for the majority of its history, the LIRR had many named trains, some of which offered all-first class seating, parlor cars, and full bar service. Many operated during the early part of the 20th century, with many being discontinued due to the onset of World War II. Some were re-established during the 1950s and 1960s as the railroad expanded its east end parlor car service after acquiring luxury coaches and Pullman cars from railroads that were discontinuing their passenger trains.

==Freight service==

The LIRR and other railroads that became part of the system have always had freight service, though this has diminished. The process of shedding freight service accelerated with the acquisition of the railroad by New York State.
In recent years there has been some appreciation of the need for better railroad freight service in New York City and on Long Island. Both areas are primarily served by trucking for freight haulage, an irony in a region with the most extensive rail transit service in the Americas as well as the worst traffic conditions. Proposals for a Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel for freight have languished more than a century.
In May 1997, freight service was franchised on a 20-year term to the New York and Atlantic Railway (NYAR), a short line railroad owned by the Anacostia and Pacific Company.[tpl]Cite news | title = Bygone Era's Revival: Hauling Goods by Rail | first = Carol | last = Steinberg | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/31/nyregion/bygone-era-s-revival-hauling-goods-by-rail.html | newspaper=New York Times | date = January 31, 1999 | accessdate =2009-09-15[/tpl] It has its own equipment and crews, but uses the rail facilities of the LIRR. To the east, freight service operates to the end of the West Hempstead Branch, to Huntington on the Port Jefferson Branch, to Bridgehampton on the Montauk Branch, and to Riverhead on the Main Line. On the western end it provides service on the surviving freight-only tracks of the LIRR: the Bay Ridge and Bushwick branches; the "Lower Montauk" between Jamaica and Long Island City; and to an interchange connection at Fresh Pond Junction in Queens with the CSX, Canadian Pacific, and Providence and Worcester railroads.

==Passenger issues==

The LIRR has a long history of rocky relations with its passengers,[tpl]Cite news | title = The Gap What We Found, Thirty Years of Neglect | first = Jennifer | last = Maloney | first2 = Karla | last2 = Schuster | newspaper=Newsday | date = January 19, 2007 | accessdate=[/tpl] especially daily commuters.[tpl]Cite news | title = The Long Island Rail Road: Busiest, but Far From Best | first = David M. | last = Halbfinger | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/30/nyregion/commuting-misery-special-report-long-island-rail-road-busiest-but-far-best.html | newspaper=New York Times | date = July 30, 1999 | accessdate =2009-09-15[/tpl] Various commuter advocacy groups have been formed to try to represent those interests, in addition to the state mandated LIRR Commuters Council.[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl]
One criticism of the LIRR is that it has not improved service to the "east end" of Long Island as the twin forks continue to grow in popularity as a year round tourist and residential destination. Demand is evidenced by flourishing for-profit bus services such as the Hampton Jitney and the Hampton Luxury Liner and the early formative stages of a new East End Transportation Authority.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eastendshuttle.org/ |title=eastendshuttle.org |publisher=eastendshuttle.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19[/tpl] Local politicians have joined the public outcry for the LIRR to either improve the frequency of east end services, or turn the operation over to a local transportation authority.
Critics claim that the on-time performance (OTP) calculated by the LIRR is manipulated to be artificially high. Because the LIRR does not release any raw timing data nor does it have independent (non-MTA) audits it is impossible to verify this claim, or the accuracy of the current On Time Performance measurement. The "percentage" measure is used by many other US passenger railroads but the criticism over accuracy is specific to the LIRR. As defined by the LIRR, a train is "on time" if it arrives at a station within 5 minutes and 59 seconds of the scheduled time.LIRR, – LIRR OTP The criterion was 4 minutes and 59 seconds until the LIRR changed it because of a bug in their computer systems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lirrcommuters.org/A55D10/home.nsf/79ac00a06b2683fa852567ca007965b7/76c174526086cf74852573a20058ff37?OpenDocument |title=– LIRR On Time Performance questions |publisher=Lirrcommuters.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19[/tpl] Critics[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lirrcommuters.org/ |title=– LIRR Commuters Campaign |publisher=Lirrcommuters.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19[/tpl] believe the OTP measure does not reflect what commuters experience on a daily basis. The LIRR publishes the current OTP in a monthly booklet called TrainTalk.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/lirr/TrainTalk |title=MTA LIRR - TrainTalk - January 2013 |publisher=Mta.info |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19[/tpl] TrainTalk was previously known as "Keeping Track."
A more accurate way to measure delays and OTP has been proposed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lirrcommuters.org/A55D10/home.nsf/79ac00a06b2683fa852567ca007965b7/76c174526086cf74852573a20058ff37?OpenDocument |title=– New OTP Proposal |publisher=Lirrcommuters.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19[/tpl] Called the "Passenger Hours Delayed" index it can measure total person-hours of a specific delay. This would be useful in comparing performance of specific days or incidents, day-to-day (or week-to-week) periods, something the current measure cannot do. This 'PHD' index measure is used by some transportation research organizations and would be more meaningful to commuters. [tpl]As of|2009|07[/tpl] it has not been adopted. The two methods are not mutually exclusive and could be kept and published simultaneously.
2007 ridership was 86.1 million, up 4.9% over 2006. The all time highest ridership was 91.8 million in 1949.[tpl]Cite news | title = LIRR, AirTrain, Tri-Rail Note Higher Annual or Daily Passenger Counts | url = http://www.progressiverailroading.com/news/article.asp?id=15045 | newspaper=Progressive Railroading | date = February 8, 2008 | accessdate =2009-09-15[/tpl]

==Law enforcement==

The former LIRR Police Department, founded in 1863, was absorbed along with the Metro-North Railroad Police to form the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police (MTA Police) in 1998.

==Pension and disability fraud scandal==

A New York Times investigation in 2008 showed that 25% of LIRR employees who had retired since 2000 filed for disability payments from the federal Railroad Retirement Board and 97% of them were approved to receive disability pension. The total collected was more than $250,000,000 over eight years. As a result, Railroad Retirement agents from Chicago inspected the Long Island office of the Railroad Retirement Board on September 23, 2008. New York Governor David Paterson issued a statement calling for Congress to conduct a full review of the board's mission and daily activities. Officials at the board's headquarters responded to the investigation stating that all occupational disability annuities were issued in accordance with applicable laws.[tpl]Cite news | title = Agents Raid Office in L.I.R.R.

On November 17, 2008, a former LIRR pension manager was arrested and charged with official misconduct for performing outside work without permission.  However, these charges were all dismissed for "no merit" by Supreme Court Judge Kase on December 11, 2009 on the grounds that the prosecution had misled the grand jury in the indictment.[tpl]Cite news |title=Judge dismisses most charges against LIRR official |first=Alfonso A. |last=Castillo |url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/judge-dismisses-most-charges-against-lirr-official-1.1649523 |newspaper=Newsday |date=December 11, 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-04[/tpl]
A report produced in September 2009 by the Government Accountability Office stated that the rate at which retirees were rewarded disability claims was above the norm for the industry in general and indicated "troubling" practices that may indicate fraud, such as the use of a very small group of physicians in making the diagnosis.Railroad Retirement Board: Review of Commuter Railroad Occupational Disability Claims retrieved 2009-10-17
