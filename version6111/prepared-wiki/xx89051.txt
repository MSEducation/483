[[Wax play]]

CATEGORIES: BDSM terminology

Wax play is a form of sensual play involving warm or hot wax usually dripped from candles or ladled onto a person's naked skin. Wax play may be combined with other BDSM or sexual activity.[tpl]cite book | first=Anil | last=Aggrawal | coauthors= | title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices | publisher=CRC Press | location=Boca Raton | year=2009 | isbn=1-4200-4308-0 |url=http://crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781420043082 | pages=149[/tpl]
Pure paraffin wax melts at around [tpl]convert|54|to|57|°C[/tpl] .[tpl]Citation needed|Reason: This contradicts the page it links to.|date=April 2014[/tpl] Adding stearine makes the wax harder and melt at a higher temperature.  Adding mineral oil makes the wax softer and melt at a lower temperature.
Soft candles in glass jars usually have mineral oil in their blend and burn cooler at around [tpl]convert|50|°C[/tpl], Pillar candles are mostly paraffin and burn warmer at around [tpl]convert|60|°C[/tpl].[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Taper candles have lots of stearine and burn hotter still at around [tpl]convert|70|°C[/tpl]. Beeswax candles burn about [tpl]convert|6|°C[/tpl] hotter than equivalent paraffin candles.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]  Although there are many web sites that repeat the same advice that color additives make candles burn hotter, actual experiments performed by two different researchers show that this is usually not the case.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] Increasing the distance the wax falls by 1 metre will drop the temperature about [tpl]convert|3|°C[/tpl][tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] at the risk of splatter.
If ordinary candles are too hot, a special wax blend with a high concentration of mineral oil can be heated to lower temperatures in a crock pot or double boiler.

==Safety notes==

Different types of candles and different crock pot temperatures produce different temperatures of wax that can range from warm and soothing to dangerously hot wax. There is significant difference between individuals' tolerance for heat, which can vary depending on exactly where the wax is applied.
Wax can splatter into the eyes. Wax can cause injury by slipping onto hard surfaces such as a floor made of concrete or wrought iron. Wax that is too hot can cause serious burns. Crock pots and wax therapy spas almost always have heat controls, not temperature controls;[tpl]Citation needed|Reason: What is a heat control? Does not make sense.|date=April 2014[/tpl] temperature will vary over time. Wax may be difficult to remove, particularly from areas with hair. A flea comb or a sharp knife may be necessary for wax removal; use of a knife for this purpose requires special skills, though a plastic card can work as well. Applying mineral oil or lotion before play can make wax removal easier.
Wax may pool and concentrate heat. Temperatures listed above only apply when wax is in equilibrium.[tpl]Citation needed|Reason: I don't even think that sentence makes sense.|date=April 2014[/tpl] Wax heated in any sort of pot must be stirred vigorously or there can be dangerous temperature variations. Some people may be allergic to perfumes and dyes. Whatever is above a burning candle can get very hot, even at distances that may be surprising. Candles may break and set fire to objects underneath or nearby. Wax is difficult to wash out of clothes and bed linens. People with certain diseases, skin conditions, or taking certain medications may require additional precautions. The page on waxing for hair removal has additional safety considerations.
