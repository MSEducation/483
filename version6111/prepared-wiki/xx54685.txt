Whitley Stokes, CSI, CIE (28 February 1830 – 13 April 1909) was an Irish lawyer and Celtic scholar.

==Background==

He was a son of William Stokes (1804–1878), and a grandson of Whitley Stokes (1763–1845), each of whom was Regius Professor of Physic at the University of Dublin. His sister Margaret Stokes was a writer and archaeologist.
He was born at 5 Merrion Square, Dublin and educated at St Columba's College where he was taught Irish by Denis Coffey, author of a Primer of the Irish Language.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/stokes.html |title=CELT: Whitley Stokes |publisher=Ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15[/tpl] Through his father he came to know the Irish antiquaries Samuel Ferguson, Eugene O'Curry, John O'Donovan and George Petrie. He entered Trinity College, Dublin in 1846 and graduated with a BA in 1851. His friend and contemporary Rudolf Thomas Siegfried (1830–1863) became assistant librarian in Trinity College in 1855, and the college's first professor of Sanskrit in 1858. It is likely that Stokes learnt both Sanskrit and comparative philology from Siegfried, thus acquiring a skill-set rare among Celtic scholars in Ireland at the time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36315 |title=Whitley Stokes |publisher=Oxforddnb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15[/tpl]

==Career==

Stokes became an English barrister on 17 November 1855, practicing in London before going to India in 1862, where he filled several official positions. In 1865 he married Mary Bazely by whom he had two sons and two daughters.  She died while the family were still living in India. In 1877 he was appointed legal member of the viceroy's council, and he drafted the codes of civil and criminal procedure and did much other valuable work of the same nature. In 1879 he became president of the commission on Indian law. Nine books by Stokes on Celtic studies were published in India. He returned to settle permanently in London in 1881 and married Elizabeth Temple in 1884. In 1887 he was made a CSI, and two years later a CIE He was an original fellow of the British Academy, an honorary fellow of Jesus College, Oxford and foreign associate of the Institut de France.

==Celtic scholarship==

Whitley Stokes is perhaps most famous as a Celtic scholar, and in this field he worked both in India and in England. He studied Irish, Breton and Cornish texts. His chief interest in Irish was as a source of material for comparative philology. Despite his learning in Old Irish and Middle Irish, he never acquired Irish pronunciation and never mastered Modern Irish. In the hundred years since his death he has continued to be a central figure in Celtic scholarship. Many of his editions have not been superseded in that time and his total output in Celtic studies comes to over 15,000 pages. He was a correspondent and close friend of Kuno Meyer from 1881 onwards. With Meyer he established the journal Archiv für celtische Lexicographie and was the co-editor, with Ernst Windisch, of the Irische Texte series.

==Death and reputation==

Stokes died at his London home, 15 Grenville Place, Kensington, in 1909. The Gaelic League paper An Claidheamh Soluis called Stokes "the greatest of the Celtologists" and expressed pride that an Irishman should have excelled in a field which was at that time dominated by continental scholars. In 1929 the Canadian scholar James F. Kenney described Stokes as "the greatest scholar in philology that Ireland has produced, and the only one that may be ranked with the most famous of continental savants".
A conference entitled "Ireland, India, London: The Tripartite Life Of Whitley Stokes" took place at the University of Cambridge from 18–19 September 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2009091702 |title=Home - News - University of Cambridge |publisher=Admin.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15[/tpl] The event was organised to mark the centenary of Stokes' death.
