==History==

===Early history===

Islamabad Capital Territory, located on the Pothohar Plateau, is considered one of the earliest sites of human settlement in Asia.[tpl]cite web|title=Islamabad history|publisher=Pakistan.net|url=http://www.pakistan.net/cities/islamabad/islamabad.htm[/tpl] Some of the earliest Stone Age artefacts in the world have been found on the plateau, dating from 100,000 to 500,000 years ago. Rudimentary stones recovered from the terraces of the Soan River testify to the endeavours of early man in the inter-glacial period. Items of pottery and utensils dating back to prehistory have been found.[tpl]cite web|url=http://beta.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/16-sacred-rocks-of-islamabad-hs-10|title=Sacred rocks of Islamabad|work=Dawn|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=27 June 2010[/tpl]
Excavations have revealed evidence of a prehistoric culture. Relics and human skulls have been found dating back to 5000 BC that show this region was home to Neolithic people who settled on the banks of the Swaan River, who developed small communities in the region at around 3000 BC.[tpl]cite web|title=Potohar|author=Pakistan Defence Ministry|url=http://www.defence.pk/forums/military-history/3753-potohar.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Background on the Potohar Plateau|author=LEAD|url=http://casestudies.lead.org/index.php?cscid=71[/tpl] Situated at one end of the Indus Valley Civilization, the area was an early settlement of the Aryan community. Their civilisation flourished here between the 23rd and 18th centuries BC. A Buddhist town once existed in the region.[tpl]cite web|title=Islamabad History|author=Lonely Planet|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/pakistan/islamabad-and-rawalpindi/history[/tpl] Many great armies such as those of Zahiruddin Babur, Genghis Khan, Timur and Ahmad Shah Durrani used the corridor through Islamabad on their way to invade the rest of the Indian Subcontinent. Modern Islamabad is based on the old settlement known as Saidpur. The British took control of the region from the Sikhs in 1849 and built South Asia's largest cantonment in the region.

===Construction and development===

When Pakistan gained independence in 1947, Karachi was its first capital. In 1960, Islamabad was constructed as a forward capital for several reasons. Traditionally, development in Pakistan was focused on the colonial centre of Karachi, and President Ayub Khan wanted it equally distributed. Moreover, Karachi having tropical weather conditions,[tpl]cite book|title=Pakistan the Land|year=2002|publisher=Crabtree Publishing|isbn=978-0778793465|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=jjA5-8xJlH0C&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Carolyn Black|accessdate=2 July 2012|page=14|month=October[/tpl] was located at one end of the country, making it vulnerable to attacks from the Arabian Sea. Pakistan needed a capital that was easily accessible from all parts of the country.[tpl]cite journal|journal=New Orient|year=1965|volume=4–6|author=Czechoslovak Society for Eastern Studies|page=565|publisher=Czechoslovak Society for Eastern Studies|location=Prague|issn=0548-6408|oclc=2264893[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Dragons and Tigers: A Geography of South, East, and Southeast Asia|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0470876282|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=qeBfed17zxEC&pg=PA187#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Barbara A. Weightman|edition=3rd|accessdate=2 July 2012|page=187|date=15 March 2011[/tpl] Karachi, a business center, was also considered unsuitable partly because of intervention of business interests in government affairs. The newly selected location of Islamabad was closer to the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the disputed territory of Kashmir in the north.
In 1958, a commission was constituted to select a suitable site for the national capital with particular emphasis on location, climate, logistics, and defence requirements along with other attributes. After extensive study, research, and a thorough review of potential sites, the commission recommended the area northeast of Rawalpindi in 1959.[tpl]cite book|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art & Architecture|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA|isbn=978-0195309911|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&pg=RA1-PA309#v=onepage&q&f=false|editor=Jonathan M.

===Civic administration===

The main administrative authority of the city is Islamabad Capital Territory Administration (ICT) with some help from Capital Development Authority (CDA), which oversees the planning, development, construction, and administration of the city.[tpl]cite web|title=CDA|author=CDA Official site|url=http://www.cda.gov.pk/cda-latest/files/file.asp?var=aboutus[/tpl] Islamabad Capital Territory is divided into eight zones: Administrative Zone, Commercial District, Educational Sector, Industrial Sector, Diplomatic Enclave, Residential Areas, Rural Areas and Green Area.[tpl]cite web|title=The Idea of Islamabad|publisher=TheIslamabad.com|url=http://www.theislamabad.com/[/tpl] Islamabad city is divided into five major zones: Zone I, Zone II, Zone III, Zone IV, and Zone V.

Each residential sector is identified by a letter of the alphabet and a number, and covers an area of approximately 2 km × 2 km ([tpl]Frac|1|1|4[/tpl] mi × [tpl]Frac|1|1|4[/tpl] mi). The sectors are lettered from A to I, and each sector is divided into four numbered sub-sectors.[tpl]cite book|title=Government of Paper: The Materiality of Bureaucracy in Urban Pakistan|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520272156|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=2ZqVvQN9PTwC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Matthew S.

Series A, B, and C are still underdeveloped. The D series has seven sectors (D-11 to D-17), of which only sector D-12 is completely developed. This series is located at the foot of Margalla Hills. The E Sectors are named from E-7 to E-17. Many foreigners and diplomatic personnel are housed in these sectors. In the revised Master Plan of the city, CDA has decided to develop a park on the pattern of Fatima Jinnah Park in sector E-14. Sectors E-8 and E-9 contain the campuses of Bahria University, Air University, and the National Defence University.[tpl]cite web|title=Official website|author=Bahria University|url=http://bci.edu.pk/index.aspx[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Official website|author=Air University|url=http://www.au.edu.pk/#[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Official website|author=National Defence University|url=http://www.ndu.edu.pk/[/tpl] The F and G series contains the most developed sectors. F series contains sectors F-5 to F-17; some sectors are still under-developed. F-5 is an important sector for the software industry in Islamabad, as the two software technology parks are located here. The entire F-9 sector is covered with Fatima Jinnah Park. The Centaurus complex will be one of the major landmarks of the F-8 sector. G sectors are numbered G-5 through G-17. Some important places include the Jinnah Convention Center and Serena Hotel in G-5, the Red Mosque in G-6, and the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, the largest medical complex in the capital, located in G-8.
The H sectors are numbered H-8 through H-17. The H sectors are mostly dedicated to educational and health institutions. National University of Sciences and Technology covers a major portion of sector H-12. The I sectors are numbered from I-8 to I-18. With the exception of I-8, which is a well-developed residential area, these sectors are primarily part of the industrial zone. Currently two sub-sectors of I-9 and one sub-sector of I-10 are used as industrial areas. CDA is planning to set up Islamabad Railway Station in Sector I-18 and Industrial City in sector I-17. Zone III consists primarily of the Margalla Hills and Margalla Hills National Park. Rawal Lake is in this zone. Zone IV and V consist of Islamabad Park, and rural areas of the city. The Soan River flows into the city through Zone V.

===Islamabad/Rawalpindi Metropolitan Area===

When the master plan for Islamabad was drawn up in 1960, Islamabad and Rawalpindi, along with the adjoining areas, would be integrated to form a large metropolitan area called Islamabad/Rawalpindi Metropolitan Area.

===Architecture===

Islamabad's architecture is a combination of modernity and old Islamic and regional traditions. The Saudi-Pak Tower is an example of the integration of modern architecture with traditional styles. The beige-coloured edifice is trimmed with blue tile works in Islamic tradition, and is one of Islamabad's tallest buildings. Other examples of intertwined Islamic and modern architecture include Pakistan Monument and Faisal Mosque. Other notable structures are: Secretariat Complex designed by Gio Ponti, Presidency based on Mughal architecture and the National Assembly by Edward Durell Stone.
