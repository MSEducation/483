==History==

Netflix was founded in 1997 in Scotts Valley, California by Marc Randolph[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=17958160|title=Marc Randolph LinkedIn Profile|author=self|accessdate=October 31, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/07/marc-randolph-bookrenter/|title=Marc Randolph Techcrunch|author=Robin Wauters|accessdate=October 31, 2011[/tpl] and Reed Hastings, who previously had worked together at Pure Software. Randolph was a co-founder of a computer mail order company by the name of MicroWarehouse. Later he was employed by Borland International as vice-president of marketing. Hastings, once a math teacher, had founded Pure Software, which he had recently sold for $700 million. Hastings invested $2.5 million in start up cash for Netflix.[tpl]cite web|title=Netflix Company History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/netflix-inc-history/[/tpl] The idea of Netflix came to Hastings when he was forced to pay $40 in overdue fines after returning Apollo 13 well past its due date.[tpl]cite web|url=https://twitter.com/netflix/statuses/2746816142|title=Happy Moon Landing Day!|author=Netflix|accessdate=July 20, 2009[/tpl] The Netflix website was launched on August 29, 1997[tpl]cite news|title=Netflix Inc.|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/netflix-inc/index.html|accessdate=October 3, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 3, 2013|first=David|last=Carr[/tpl] with only 30 employees and 925 works available for rent and brought a more traditional, online pay-per-rental model (US $4 per rental plus US $2 in postage; late fees applied).[tpl]cite web|author=Stephen Czar|year=1998|url=http://www.dvdfile.com/news/special_report/features/timeline/timeline.htm|title= DVD Historical Timeline|accessdate =January 30, 2006[/tpl] Netflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1999,[tpl]Cite news|first=Jeffrey M.|last=O'Brien|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.12/netflix.html?pg=2|title= The Netflix Effect|publisher=Wired News|date=December 2002[/tpl] and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per title rental fees.
Netflix was offered to Blockbuster for $50 million in 2000, but Blockbuster declined.
Netflix initiated an initial public offering (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at the price of US $15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during fiscal year 2003, earning US $6.5 million profit on revenues of US $272 million.
In 2005, 35,000 different film titles were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4149765|title=Movies to go|work=The Economist|date=July 7, 2005[/tpl]
Netflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers. On October 1, 2006, Netflix offered a $1,000,000 prize to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm, Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.netflixprize.com/|title=Netflix Prize Website|accessdate=December 8, 2006[/tpl]

Netflix grew while DVD sales fell from 2006 to 2011.[tpl]cite news|url=http://techland.time.com/2011/05/04/dvd-sales-plunge-in-u-s-digital-sales-on-the-rise/|title=DVD Sales Plunge in U.S., Digital Sales on the Rise | work=Time | date=May 4, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/01/8627/|title=Netflix offers streaming movies to subscribers[/tpl]
Netflix has played a prominent role in independent film distribution. Through a division called Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born into Brothels and Sherrybaby. As of late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters.[tpl]cite web|url= http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/12/08/AM200612081.html|title=Netflix expands indie film biz|last=Dornhelm |first=Rachel|accessdate=December 11, 2006|date=December 8, 2006|publisher=American Public Media [/tpl] Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008, in part to avoid competition with its studio partners.[tpl]cite news| url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iKwZUPaTeYqpyM5ombXf-AXxTVoAD923Q2G01| title=Netflix shuts movie financing arm to focus on core| last= Jesdanun| first=Anick| accessdate=August 11, 2008| date=July 23, 2008| agency=Associated Press[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i1143d5f105d0afbb447adbcc57f8312c| title=Netflix closing Red Envelope| last= Goldstein| first=Gregg| accessdate=August 11, 2008| date=July 22, 2008|work=The Hollywood Reporter[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Netflix has been one of the most successful dot-com ventures. A September 2002 article from The New York Times said that at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/business/new-economy-dvd-s-have-found-an-unexpected-route-to-a-wide-public-snail-mail.html?scp=2&sq=netflix&st=nyt | title=nytimes.com | work=The New York Times | first=Peter | last=Wayner | date=September 23, 2002[/tpl] The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's growth has been fueled by the fast spread of DVD players in households; as of 2004, nearly two-thirds of U.S. homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into U.S. homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that brick and mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped it to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.[tpl]Cite news|first=Ryan|last=Blitstein|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07092/773993-28.stm|title=Vacation policy at Netflix: Take as much as you want|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=March 22, 2007|accessdate=November 10, 2008[/tpl]
By 2010, Netflix's streaming business had grown so quickly that within months the company had shifted from the fastest-growing customer of the United States Postal Service's first-class mail service to the biggest source of Internet traffic in North America in the evening.

==Services==

Netflix is a subscription-based movie and television show rental service that offers media to subscribers via Internet streaming and via US mail.

===Internet video streaming===

In addition to Netflix's disc rental service, Netflix separately offers an Internet video streaming service, which gives internet-connected devices access to Netflix's online content library.  The two libraries are also notably different, with the disc library having more movie titles available,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9940529-1.html |title=Netflix Watch Now: Missing too much popular content |author=Falcone, John P. |date=May 9, 2008 |work=CNET |accessdate=July 19, 2010[/tpl] while the streaming library has more Netflix original content.  And among competing video streaming services, Netflix is probably the most widely supported among compatible devices.  According to a 2013 report by Sandvine, Netflix is the biggest source of North American downstream web traffic, at 32.3%, and registered 28.8% of aggregate traffic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/05/14/netflix-us-internet-traffic-percentage/ |title=Netflix Accounts For Nearly One-Third Of US Internet Traffic At Home |publisher=TubeFilter|date= |accessdate=October 23, 2013[/tpl]
When the streaming service first launched, Netflix's traditional rental-disc subscribers were given access at no additional charge.  Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription. (A $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media.)
In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers were entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost. (However, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) were still limited to two hours of streaming per month.) This change was a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video rental services.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/01/13/financial/f090113S93.DTL |title=Netflix Expands Internet Viewing Option |work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=January 13, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080115195018/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/01/13/financial/f090113S93.DTL  |archivedate = January 15, 2008[/tpl] Subsequently, as it became clear that disc-rental and internet streaming markets were distinct, Netflix split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on internet streaming were lifted.
Netflix does not officially support playback on Linux PCs although the Linux-based Roku devices are supported. It is possible to connect the Roku device, game console, or Blu-ray Disc player to a Linux PC (or directly to the computer monitor) with an adapter. It is also possible to run Windows and Netflix in a virtual machine such as Virtualbox or QEMU. In a TechRepublic interview in August 2010, Netflix's VP of Corporate Communications stated that available Silverlight plugins for Linux, such as Moonlight, do not support the PlayReady DRM system that Netflix requires for playback.[tpl]cite web|last=Wallen |first=Jack |url=http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/opensource/?p=1745 |title=The Netflix Linux conjecture: How Netflix snubs the Linux community |publisher=Blogs.techrepublic.com.com |accessdate=June 29, 2011|archiveurl=http://archive.is/Rxr0A|archivedate=January 2, 2013[/tpl] Netflix does support the Android operating system, which uses a forked version of the Linux kernel. There is an unofficial Netflix app based on Wine that allows watching Netflix on Linux without installing Windows in a virtual machine. Pipelight, an addon for Firefox based on the Netflix-Desktop project allows Netflix playback through Linux Native web browsers by connecting to the Silverlight plug-in running on a Wine base.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webupd8.org/2013/08/pipelight-use-silverlight-in-your-linux.html|title=Pipelight|accessdate=January 7, 2014|date=January 7, 2014[/tpl]
The selection of available titles is based upon the user's IP address. For most users, this corresponds to the user's physical location. However, it means that, for example, a user in Canada who is accessing the Internet through a U.S.-based router connection will see the selection available to U.S. users.
According to a survey by Nielsen in July 2011, 42% of all Netflix users make use of a stand-alone computer to connect to Netflix, 25% do so by using the Wii, 14% by connecting their computers to a TV, 13% make use of a PlayStation 3 and 12% use an Xbox 360.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/what-netflix-and-hulu-users-are-watching-and-how/ |title=What Netflix and Hulu Users are Watching… and How|work= NielsenWire |date= July 27, 2011|accessdate=July 27, 2011[/tpl]

====History====

On October 1, 2008, Netflix announced a partnership with Starz Entertainment to bring 2,500+ new movies and television shows to Watch Instantly in what is being called Starz Play.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2008/10/more-mainstream.html |title=More mainstream movies for Netflix online | work=Los Angeles Times |date= October 1, 2008|accessdate=November 21, 2008[/tpl]
In August 2010, Netflix announced it had reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream movies from Paramount, Lionsgate and MGM. The deal increased the amount Netflix was spending on streaming movies annually and adds roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.[tpl]Cite news|title=Netflix to Stream Films From Paramount, Lions Gate, MGM |first=Brian |last=Stelter |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 10, 2010 |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/netflix-to-stream-films-from-paramount-lionsgate-mgm/ |accessdate=August 11, 2010[/tpl]
As of 2011, Netflix's "Watch Instantly" service holds first-run rights to films from Paramount Pictures, MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment (through an output deal with Epix), along with back-catalog titles to films from Time Warner, Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures, Paramount Pictures, MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, Disney, and other distributors. Netflix also provides current and back-catalog TV programs distributed by NBC Universal, 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures, Disney-ABC Domestic Television, with select shows from Warner Bros. as well. Netflix also previously held the rights to select titles from the Criterion Collection, but those were pulled from the streaming library when Criterion titles were added to Hulu's Hulu Plus streaming library.[tpl]Cite news|title=Netflix loses Criterion films |first=Jeff |last=Chabot |work=HD Report |date=February 18, 2011 |url=http://www.hd-report.com/2011/02/18/netflix-loses-criterion-films/ |accessdate=February 18, 2011[/tpl] Netflix has "pay TV window" deals with Relativity Media, FilmDistrict, and Open Road Films.[tpl]Cite news|title=Open Road Films signs pay TV deal with Netflix |first=Ben |last=Fritz |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 28, 2011 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/06/open-road-films-signs-pay-tv-deal-with-netflix.html |accessdate=July 31, 2011[/tpl]
On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate the current subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the instant streaming and the other DVD rental.[tpl]cite web|last=Reisinger |first=Don |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20078765-17/netflix-hikes-prices-adds-dvd-only-plan/ |title=Netflix hikes prices, adds DVD-only plan | The Digital Home – CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=July 12, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2012[/tpl] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 while DVD rental would start at the same price. The announcement led to a flurry of negative reception amongst Netflix's Facebook followers, posting negative comments on the company's wall.[tpl]cite web|last=Mack |first=Eric |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-20078960-93/dear-netflix-price-hike-ignites-social-media-fire/ |title='Dear Netflix': Price hike ignites social-media fire |work=CNET News |date=July 12, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2012[/tpl] Twitter comments also spiked a "Dear Netflix" trend with generally negative comments as well. The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change. "Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people who just want DVDs," Netflix wrote on its blog. "Creating an unlimited-DVDs-by-mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs-by-mail offering."
In a reversal, Netflix announced in October 2011 that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain together under the Netflix brand.[tpl]cite news|url= http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/netflix-abandons-plan-to-rent-dvds-on-qwikster/#|work=The New York Times|first=Brian|last=Stelter| title=Netflix, in Reversal, Will Keep Its Services Together | date=October 10, 2011[/tpl]
On September 1, 2011, Starz announced it would remove their movies from Netflix streaming on February 28, 2012. Since the agreement was strictly for streaming movie titles, DVD rentals through Netflix were not affected.Starz says it won't renew Netflix streaming contract. Retrieved September 1, 2011 However, around that same time, it was announced Netflix would, in 2013, assume the pay-TV rights to films from DreamWorks Animation (those output rights are currently held by HBO).

===Disc rental===

In the United States, the company provides a monthly flat-fee service for the rental of DVD and Blu-ray Discs. A subscriber creates an ordered list, called a rental queue, of movies to rent. The movies are delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from an array of regional warehouses. As of March 28, 2011, Netflix had 58 shipping locations throughout the U.S.[tpl]cite news | first = Paul | last = Lilly | title = GameFly Complains USPS Favors Netflix | date = March 28, 2011 | url = http://www.maximumpc.com/article/gamefly_complains_usps_favors_netflix | work=Maximum PC | accessdate =April 2, 2011 | quote = Netflix has 58 shipping locations[/tpl] The subscriber can keep the rented movie as long as desired, but there is a limit on the number of movies (determined by subscription level) that each subscriber can have on loan simultaneously. To rent a new movie, the subscriber must mail the previous one back to Netflix in a metered reply mail envelope. Upon receipt of the disc, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.
Netflix offers several pricing tiers for DVD rental of one to three DVDs at a time. Subscribers with accounts in good standing can upgrade to plans offering up to eight DVDs at a time. Gift subscriptions are also available. Since November 21, 2008, Netflix has offered their subscribers access to Blu-ray Discs for an additional fee.
In addition to its movie rental service, Netflix formerly sold used movies. The purchase was delivered via the same system and billed using the same payment methods as rentals. This service was discontinued at the end of November 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.netflix.com/2008/11/normal-0-false-false-false-en-us-x-none.html#links |title=The Official Netflix Blog: Ending sales of previously viewed DVDs on website |publisher=netflix.com |date=November 3, 2008 |accessdate=November 21, 2008[/tpl]
Starting January 6, 2010, Netflix reached an agreement with Warner Brothers Pictures to delay renting new releases for 28 days from their retail release in an attempt to help studios sell more physical media at retail outlets. A similar deal with Universal Studios and Twentieth Century Fox was reached on April 9, 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://netflix.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=342 |title=Netflix Press Release on Warner Delayed release deal. |publisher=netflix.mediaroom.com |date=January 6, 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://netflix.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=352 |title=Netflix Press Release on Universal Delayed release deal. |publisher=netflix.mediaroom.com |date=April 9, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://netflix.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=353 |title=Netflix Press Release on 20th Century Fox Delayed release deal. |publisher=netflix.mediaroom.com |date=January 6, 2010 [/tpl]
In 2011, Netflix split its service pricing so that customers can decide whether they want to pay for online streams, access to DVDs by mail, or both.

====Qwikster====

On September 18, 2011, Netflix CEO and Co-Founder Reed Hastings said in a Netflix blog post that the DVD section of Netflix would be split off and renamed Qwikster, and the only major change would be separate websites for the services.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.netflix.com/2011/09/explanation-and-some-reflections.html |title= An Explanation and Some Reflections|work=Qwikster|accessdate=September 19, 2011[/tpl] The new service was to also carry video games for an additional charge, whereas the previous Netflix did not. Netflix subscribers who wanted DVDs by mail would have had to use a separate website to access Qwikster.
On October 10, 2011, following negative reaction from customers, Hastings announced the cancellation of the planned Qwikster service and said the DVD-by-mail service would remain a part of Netflix.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.netflix.com/2011/10/dvds-will-be-staying-at-netflixcom.html|title=DVDs Will Be Staying at Netflix.com[/tpl]

Blockbuster Video entered the U.S. online market in August 2004, with a US$19.95 monthly subscription service.

===Time Warner===

In a 2010 New York Times interview, Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes downplayed Netflix as a threat to more traditional media companies. "It's a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world?" Bewkes told the newspaper. "I don’t think so."  At the same time, he recognized that the company's DVD service may have contributed to a decline in DVD sales, and regarding the industry's willingness to make special deals with Netflix in the future, he added, "This has been an era of experimentation, and I think it's coming to a close."Tim Arango, New York Times. "Time Warner Views Netflix as a Fading Star." December 12, 2010. Retrieved September 19, 2011. Bewkes later refined his position, stating during a 2011 conference call that "Things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn’t – in terms of efficiency for older product, wasn’t as available before...Our view of Netflix has been very consistent. I’ve tried at times to be humorous about it, sometimes to make a point."Matt Phillips, Wall Street Journal blog. "Time Warner Chief: ‘Things Like Netflix are Welcome Additions’. "May 4, 2011.

After the contract with Viacom that allowed Netflix to instantly stream Nickelodeon & Nick Jr. programs expired, Netflix received a new contract from Time Warner that allowed them to instantly stream Cartoon Network & Adult Swim programs.

==Finance and revenue==

===2010===

In 2010, Netflix's stock price increased 219% to $175.70 and it added 8 million subscribers, bringing its total to 20 million. Revenue jumped 29% to $2.16 billion and net income was up 39% to $161 million.Ben Fritz, LA Times. "Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings' compensation doubled to $5.5 million." April 20, 2011.

===2011===

In April 2011, Netflix was expected to earn $1.07 a share in the first quarter of 2011 on revenue of $705.7 million, a huge increase compared to the year-earlier profit of 59 cents on revenue of $493.7 million, according to a survey of 25 analysts polled by FactSet Research.David B.

Following the customer dissatisfaction and resulting loss of subscribers after the announcements by CEO Reed Hastings that streaming and DVD rental would be charged separately, leading to a higher price for customers who wanted both (on September 1), and that the DVD rental would be split off as the subsidiary Qwikster (on September 18), the share price fell steeply, to around $130.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.economist.com/node/21530169|title=Netflix messes up|work=The Economist|date=September 24, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Alternatives for angry Netflix customers: Ticked over the company's price increase?

==Legal issues and controversies==

===Recommendation algorithm and the "Netflix Prize"===

In 2006, Netflix held the first Netflix Prize competition to find a better program to predict user preferences and beat its existing Netflix movie recommendation system, known as Cinematch, by at least 10%. CEO Reed Hastings did not necessarily expect a lot of quick progress towards the prize. "We thought we built the best darn thing ever," Hastings said.New York Times  "You Want Innovation? Offer a Prize" by David Leonhardt. January 31, 2007. But by June 2007 Hastings said the competition is "three-quarters of the way there in three-quarters of a year."New York Times.  "Netflix Prize Still Awaits a Movie Seer" by Katie Hafner.   June 4, 2007. Three teams—an AT&T Research Team called BellKor, commendo's team BigChaos, and Pragmatic Theory—combined to win the 2009 grand prize competition for $1 million. The winning team, called BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos, used machine learning techniques to find that, for example, the rating system people use for older movies is very different from that used for a movie they just saw. The mood of the day made a difference also; for example, Friday ratings were different from Monday morning ratings.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www2.research.att.com/~volinsky/netflix/ |title=BelKor Home Page |publisher=AT&T Labs, Inc. – Research |accessdate=November 9, 2010[/tpl]
In 2010, Netflix canceled a running contest to improve the company's recommendation algorithm due to privacy concerns: under the terms of the competition, contestants were given access to customer rental data, which the company had purportedly anonymized. However, it was discovered that even this anonymized dataset could, in fact, identify a user personally. Netflix was sued by KamberLaw L.L.C. and ended the contest after reaching a deal with the FTC.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/technology/13netflix.html | title=Netflix Cancels Contest After Concerns Are Raised About Privacy | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=March 12, 2010 |work=The New York Times [/tpl]

===Throttling of DVDs by mail===

Netflix's allocation policy – referred to by many as "throttling" – gives priority shipping and selection to customers who rent fewer discs per month. Higher volume renters may see some of their selections delayed, routed elsewhere, or sent out of order.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8FMEGTO0.htm?|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060215072830/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8FMEGTO0.htm?|archivedate=February 15, 2006|first=Michael|last=Liedtke|title='Throttling' angers Netflix heavy renters|agency=Associated Press (Internet Archive)|date=February 10, 2005|accessdate=February 11, 2005[/tpl]

The suit alleged false advertising in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery." In January 2005, Netflix changed its Terms of Use to acknowledge what has commonly become known as "throttling". (Mike Kaltschnee, owner of the Hacking Netflix blog, says Netflix calls this practice "smoothing" internally.)[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2005/09/blockbuster_thr.html|title=Blockbuster Throttling|publisher=Hacking Netflix|accessdate=December 17, 2006[/tpl]
In October 2005, Netflix proposed a settlement for those who had enrolled as a paid Netflix member prior to January 15, 2005. These earlier members would be able to renew their subscriptions with a one-month free membership, and those early members with current subscriptions would receive a one-month free upgrade to the next-highest membership level. Netflix's settlement denied allegations of any wrongdoing, and the case did not reach a legal judgment. Netflix estimated the settlement cost at approximately US$4 million, which included up to US$2.53 million to cover plaintiff lawyer fees. A controversial aspect of the settlement offer was that the customer's account would continue at the renewed or upgraded membership level after the free month provided by the settlement, with customers being charged accordingly unless they opted out after the month-long free period ended. After Trial Lawyers for Public Justice filed a challenge to the proposed settlement[tpl]cite press release|publisher=Trial Lawyers for Public Justice|title=Court Urged To Strike Down Proposed Netflix Class Action Settlement in Deceptive Advertising Case|url=http://www.tlpj.org/pr/netflix_class_action_010506.htm[/tpl] and the Federal Trade Commission filed an amicus brief urging the rejection or modification of the settlement, Netflix offered to alter the settlement terms requiring customers to actively approve any continuation after the free month.

 The summary notice and long-form notice together provided all of the detail required by statute or court rule, in a highly accessible form. The fact that not all of the information was contained in a single e-mail or mailing is immaterial… Using a summary notice that directed the class member wanting more information to a Web site containing a more detailed notice, and provided hyperlinks to that Web site, was a perfectly acceptable manner of giving notice in this case… The class members conducted business with defendant over the Internet, and can be assumed to know how to navigate between the summary notice and the Web site. Using the capability of the Internet in that fashion was a sensible and efficient way of providing notice, especially compared to the alternative Vogel apparently preferred—mailing out a lengthy legalistic document that few class members would have been able to plow through.

The settlement was criticized because it paid out $2.5 million to attorneys for fees and costs, while offering only coupons to the class members.[ref][tpl]Cite news|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/04/23/attorneys-in-netflix-suit-take-home-2-million-in-fees/ |title=Court Orders Netflix to Deliver $2 million in Attorneys Fees |accessdate=August 21, 2008 |last=Slater |first=Dan |date=April 23, 2008 |work=The Wall Street Journal Law Blog |publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

===Dynamic queue, subscription, and delivery methods===

On April 4, 2006, Netflix filed a patent infringement lawsuit in which it demanded a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Blockbuster's online DVD rental subscription program violated two patents held by Netflix. The first cause of action alleged Blockbuster's infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,024,381 (issued April 4, 2006; only hours before the lawsuit was filed) by copying the "dynamic queue" of DVDs available for each customer, Netflix's method of using the ranked preferences in the queue to send DVDs to subscribers, and Netflix's method permitting the queue to be updated and reordered.[tpl]US patent reference|number=7024381|y=2006|m=04|d=04|inventor=Hastings; W.

===Removal of social networking feature===

Since 2004, Netflix subscribers could use a feature that allowed them to interact with friends who were also members. This feature was meant to tap into the growing popularity of social networking. With this feature, users could see how their friends rated a movie on that movie's page; view what DVDs their friends were renting; and allow them to leave their friends notes with film recommendations.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1583922/netflix-offers-case-study-in-how-not-to-do-a-redesign | title = 5 Ways Netflix Could Have Avoided an Ugly User Backlash | first = Cliff | last = Kuang | date = March 16, 2010 | publisher=Fast Company[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url = http://www.betanews.com/article/Netflix-axes-friends-feature-due-to-unpopularity/1268941363 | title = Netflix axes 'friends' feature due to unpopularity | first = Tim | last = Conneally | date = March 18, 2010 | publisher=Betanews[/tpl]

The initial announcement about the redesign on Netflix's official blog made no reference to any changes to the Friends feature.[tpl]cite web| url = http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/new-movie-details-page-rolled-out.html | title = New Movie Details Page Rolled Out | date = March 4, 2010 | publisher=Netflix[/tpl] Hundreds of angry users posted negative comments, and the feedback prompted Netflix's Vice President of Product Management, Todd Yellin, to post a follow-up statement. While apologizing for poor communication about the changes, Yellin stated that the Friends feature would continue to be phased out, citing figures that only 2% of members used the feature and the company's limited resources to maintain the service.[tpl]cite web| url = http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/friends-update.html | title = Friends Update | date = March 17, 2010 | publisher=Netflix[/tpl] Netflix users also began using the movie-reviews section of the website to post comments protesting the changes.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2010/03/unhappy-netflix-customers-using-netflix-movie-reviews-to-protest-friends-feature-removal.html | title = Unhappy Netflix Customers using Netflix Movie Reviews to Protest Friends Feature Removal | date = March 14, 2010 | publisher=Hacking Netflix[/tpl]

===Linux support===

Netflix supports online streaming only on Microsoft Windows, OS X, iOS, and Android, relying on Microsoft's Silverlight technology.  Partly due to digital rights management issues, despite the open-source implementation of Silverlight known as Moonlight, this has created problems for users of fully open source versions of Linux and similar operating systems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/the-netflix-linux-conjecture-how-netflix-snubs-the-linux-community/1745|title=The Netflix Linux Conjecture: How Netflix snubs the Linux community |author=Wallen, Jack |date=August 14, 2010[/tpl]  Though Google's partially proprietary Android and Chrome OS platforms are essentially based upon Linux and other open source software infrastructure, Netflix did not provide any crossover support for using its proprietary components to stream any of its content upon fully free systems, such as Ubuntu and Fedora.
On August 9, 2011, Netflix released a Google Chrome web store item for Chrome OS, Mac, and PC; however, it does not yet enable Netflix streaming on Linux machines. On Linux systems running the Chrome browser, the extension simply redirects users to view Netflix.com.[tpl]cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/deceagebecbceejblnlcjooeohmmeldh?hl=en-US&hc=hp&hcp=new|title= Netflix – Chrome Web Store[/tpl]

====Third-party solutions====

[tpl]As of|2011|5|9|df=US[/tpl], Google had initially released plans for a plugin for the Chrome browser and Chrome OS which would allow Netflix streaming, including traditional Linux users.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thechromesource.com/netflix-plug-in-for-chrome-and-chrome-os-is-on-the-way/|title= Netflix Plug-in for Chrome and Chrome OS is on the way |author=West, Jullian|date=May 9, 2011[/tpl]
On November 15, 2012, patches to the Wine compatibility layer to make viewing of Netflix on Linux and similar systems were announced.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/11/netflix-on-ubuntu-is-here.html |title=Netflix on Ubuntu Is Here |work=iheartubuntu.com |date=November 15, 2012 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |author=iheartubuntu |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140308111726/http://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/11/netflix-on-ubuntu-is-here.html |archivedate=March 8, 2014 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
On November 18, 2012, a PPA and installation files were made publicly available making the installation and use of Netflix much easier for users of Ubuntu 12.04 and possibly other distributions.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/11/ppa-for-netflix-desktop-app.html |title=PPA for Netflix Desktop App |work=iheartubuntu.com |date=November 18, 2012 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |author=iheartubuntu |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140308112323/http://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/11/ppa-for-netflix-desktop-app.html |archivedate=March 8, 2014 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
On August 8, 2013, software repositories were made publicly available making possible the usage of the Windows Silverlight plugin in Linux-native web browsers using Wine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ubuntugeek.com/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html |title=Pipelight – Using Silverlight in Linux browsers |work=ubuntugeek.com |date=August 26, 2013 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |auto= |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140308112740/http://www.ubuntugeek.com/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html |archivedate=March 8, 2014 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://fds-team.de/cms/pipelight-installation.html |title=Pipelight - Installation |work=fds-team.de |date=October 15, 2013 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |author=Fds-Team |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140308113054/http://fds-team.de/cms/pipelight-installation.html |archivedate=March 8, 2014 |deadurl=no[/tpl] Previous Linux Netflix support required running the entire Firefox web browser through the Wine compatibility layer.

===Closed captioning===

On March 11, 2011, Don Cullen filed a national class action lawsuitNATIONWIDE CLASS ACTION FILED AGAINST NETFLIX; LAWSUIT ALLEGES POPULAR MOVIE WEBSITE FAILED TO CAPTION STREAMING VIDEO LIBRARY IN VIOLATION OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAW, MISLED DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CUSTOMERS. Cullen v. Netflix, Inc., Case No. CV 11-1199 (N.D. Cal.). Retrieved 3/1/2012 against Netflix alleging Netflix failed to close caption its streaming video library and had misled deaf and hard of hearing customers. In June 2011, the National Association of the Deaf filed a lawsuit against Netflix for not providing closed captioning on all of its Watch Instantly movies. The group claims Netflix is violating the Americans with Disabilities Act by not providing equal access on entertainment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20072619-38/netflix-sued-by-deaf-group-over-lack-of-subtitles/|title= Netflix sued by deaf group over lack of subtitles|author=Whitney, Lance|date=June 20, 2011[/tpl] On November 11, 2011, the court denied a Netflix motion to dismiss the case.MEMORANDUM AND ORDER REGARDING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS AMENDED COMPLAINT. United States DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS. Case 3:11-cv-30168-MAP. Document 32. Retrieved December 30, 2011.
In March 2012, Netflix announced it had increased the number of programs that are closed captioned. Almost all Netflix-ready devices in distribution today (including AppleTV, BD players, the Roku set-top box, and all the game consoles, phone apps, tablet apps, and TVs) are capable of rendering captions.[tpl]cite web|website=Blog.Netflix.com | url=http://blog.netflix.com/2012/02/update-on-captioning-for-our-members.html |date=February 2012|title=An Update on Captioning for our Members|accessdate= March 1, 2012[/tpl]
In July 2012, Netflix announced the formation of an experimental project to crowdsource the closed-captioning effort using the Amara (formerly Universal Subtitles) platform.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/video/netflix-amara-closed-captions-crowdsourcing/|title=Netflix experiments with crowd-sourced captioning|date=July 30, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012|publisher=GigaOM|last=Roettgers|first=Janko[/tpl] However, this proved problematic in the face of claims that crowdsourced subtitles, regardless of whether they are transcriptions or translations, are derivative works which infringe copyright if created or distributed without consent from the film's copyright owner.[tpl]Cite news| newspaper=The Wall Street Journal| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444592404578033301429532328.html| title=Lost in Translation, Found in Subtitles| last=Paletta| first=Anthony| date=October 3, 2012| accessdate=October 19, 2012[/tpl] Amara operates under DMCA safe-harbor provisions which indemnify it from secondary copyright infringement lawsuits over user-uploaded content, and presumably Netflix would not publish any subtitles produced by this effort without authorization. Netflix was careful to say it is not committed to using any subtitles produced by the crowdsourcing project.
In October 2012, Netflix was found to be offering the television series Andromeda to customers in Finland with unauthorized subtitles from the fansub scene.[tpl]cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/netflix-caught-using-pirated-subtitles-in-finland-121019/|title=Netflix Caught Using "Pirated" Subtitles in Finland|author=Ernesto|publisher=TorrentFreak|date=October 19, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012[/tpl] Such subtitles, and motion pictures incorporating them, have long been traded online, resulting in cease and desist notices, takedowns, and copyright infringement lawsuits against traders, website operators, and search engines; even criminal prosecution happened in one Norwegian case involving the distribution of fan-created subtitles alone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/student-fined-for-running-movie-tv-show-subtitle-download-site-120608/|title=Student Fined For Running Movie & TV Show Subtitle Download Site|date=June 8, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012|author=Enigmax|publisher=TorrentFreak[/tpl] When confronted, Netflix apologized and promised to remove the unauthorized translations, but did not explain how the content came to be offered in the first place, or whether other potentially copyright-infringing subtitles exist in the company's repertoire.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
On January 20, 2014, Jon Christian published an article in The Week, titled "How Netflix alienated and insulted its deaf subscribers: The streaming video giant still can't manage to competently produce closed captions", which catalogues Netflix's various technical and legal issues regarding closed captioning, including the poor quality of the subtitles that are provided. For example, he states: "But for all the service's strengths, one aspect is still decidedly twentieth century: The bizarrely low standards for Netflix's closed captions, which continue to alienate subscribers who are deaf, hard of hearing, or simply have difficulty understanding dialogue." The article was updated the following day to publish Netflix's response: "Update: The day after this article was published, a representative from Netflix contacted the author of this piece with an additional comment: 'While we don't have the rights to make edits to subs/captions we do, in fact, request redelivery of subtitles or captions when we discover errors. The titles in your piece are now under investigation.'

==Technical details==

===Streaming===

Initially streaming solely using Microsoft technologies and codecs such as VC-1 for video and WMA for audio,  the rapid expansion and diversity of Netflix-capable devices have necessitated encoding into many different formats —  including H.264 (AVC), VC-1, H.263 and H.265 (HEVC) for video, and Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, AAC and Ogg Vorbis for audio.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.streamingmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013SMEast-C101.pdf|title=A Brief History of Netflix Streaming|author=Ronca, David|date=May 2013[/tpl] According to Netflix, the vast number of codec and & bitrate combinations can mean having to encode the same title 120 different times before it can be delivered to all streaming platforms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/12/complexity-in-digital-supply-chain.html|title=Complexity In The Digital Supply Chain|author=McEntee, Kevin|date=December 17, 2012[/tpl]
Netflix uses adaptive bitrate streaming technology to adjust the video and audio quality to match a customer’s broadband connection speed and realtime network conditions. Netflix recommend a 1.5Mbit/s download speed as a minimum, 3Mbit/s for DVD quality, 5Mbit/s for HD, 7Mbit/s for Super HD and 12Mbit/s for 3D streaming.[tpl]cite web|url=https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306|title=Internet Connection Speed Recommendations|author=Netflix, Inc.|date=March 1, 2014[/tpl] Not all devices or titles support the highest quality streams. Netflix’s announced support for 4K streaming will use the H.265 codec and require a 15Mbit/s connection.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1389112514|title=Netflix will use 15 Mb/s HEVC for 4K streaming|author=Larsen, Rasmus|date=Jan 7, 2014[/tpl]
Netflix provides users the ability to choose their download rates / quality of video on their site (https://account.netflix.com/VideoQuality).

===Netflix API===

On October 1, 2008, Netflix launched an application programming interface (API).[tpl]cite web| title=Netflix API Launches Tomorrow |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/netflix_api_launches_tomorrow.php |publisher=ReadWriteWeb |accessdate=September 30, 2008 [/tpl] The Netflix API[tpl]cite web|url=http://developer.netflix.com/ |title=Netflix API – Welcome to the Netflix Developer Network |publisher=Netflix |accessdate=July 19, 2010[/tpl] allows access to data for all Netflix titles as well as access on a user's behalf to manage his or her movie queue. The API is free and allows commercial use.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mashery.com/customers/netflix |title=Netflix API Management Solution [/tpl] The Developer Network includes a forum for asking and answering questions.[tpl]cite web| title=New York Times & Rotten Tomatoes Add Netflix "Add" & "Watch" Links |url=http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2009/02/ny-times-rotten-tomatoes-add-netflix-add-play-links.html |publisher=HackingNetflix |accessdate=February 20, 2009 [/tpl] 
A variety of services has been created around or has integrated the API. Examples include Rotten Tomatoes and The New York Times, which allow users to click to add titles to their Netflix queue or begin watching on Watch Instantly from their pages,[tpl]cite web| title=New York Times & Rotten Tomatoes Add Netflix "Add" & "Watch" Links |url=http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2009/02/ny-times-rotten-tomatoes-add-netflix-add-play-links.html |publisher=HackingNetflix |accessdate=February 20, 2009 [/tpl] and Jinni, which enables one to search within Watch Instantly and imports some user information such as reviews.[tpl]cite web| title=Jinni Searches Netflix better than Netflix |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10199106-2.html |publisher=CNET |accessdate=March 18, 2009 [/tpl]
Additionally, the API has allowed many developers to release Netflix applications for mobile devices. For example, on November 16, 2009, Netflix released an official Nokia app that allows some trailer streaming,[tpl]cite web | url = http://blog.netflix.com/2009/11/netflix-for-nokia-phones.html | title = Netflix for Nokia Phones | accessdate =April 2, 2011 | last = Hart | first = Michael | date = November 16, 2009 | publisher=Netflix[/tpl] and on August 26, 2010, Netflix released an official iPhone app. However, in June 2012, Netflix announced that it would be cutting back the availability of its public API.[tpl]cite web | url = http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Upcoming_Changes_to_the_Netflix_API_Program | title = Upcoming Changes to the Netflix API Program | accessdate = June 21, 2012 | date = June 15, 2012 | publisher = Netflix[/tpl][tpl]why|date=April 2014[/tpl]

===IT infrastructure===

In 2010, Netflix migrated its infrastructure to Amazon EC2. Master copies of digital films from movie studios are stored on Amazon S3, and each film is encoded into over 50 different versions based on video resolution and audio quality using machines on the cloud. In total, Netflix has over 1 petabyte of data stored on Amazon, and the data are sent to content delivery networks (including Akamai, Limelight, and Level 3) that feed the content to local ISPs. Netflix uses a number of pieces of open-source software in its backend, including FreeBSD and nginx,[tpl]cite web |url= https://ripe64.ripe.net/presentations/89-Netflix_RIPE_April_2012.pdf |title=Netflix Content Delivery |author=David Temkin |date=April 2012 |publisher=RIPE |accessdate=April 19, 2012[/tpl] Java, MySQL, Gluster, Apache Tomcat, Hive, Chukwa, Cassandra, and Hadoop.[tpl]YouTube|id=Idu9OKnAOis|title=OSCON Data 2011, Adrian Cockcroft, "Data Flow at Netflix"[/tpl]
