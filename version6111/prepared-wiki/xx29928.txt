The Producers is a 1968 American satirical dark comedy cult classic film written and directed by Mel Brooks. The film is set in the late 1960s and it tells the story of a theatrical producer and an accountant who want to produce a sure-fire Broadway flop. They take more money from investors than they can repay (the shares they've sold total more than 100% of any profits) and plan to abscond to Brazil as soon as the play closes, only to see the plan improbably go awry when the show turns out to be a hit.
The film stars Zero Mostel as Max Bialystock, the producer, and Gene Wilder as Leo Bloom, the accountant, and features Dick Shawn as L.S.D., the actor who ends up playing the lead in the musical within the movie, and Kenneth Mars as the former Nazi soldier and playwright, Franz Liebkind.
The Producers was the first film directed by Mel Brooks. He won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Decades later, it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry and placed 11th on the AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list. The film was later remade successfully by Brooks as an acclaimed Broadway stage musical which itself was adapted as a film.

==Plot==

Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) is a washed-up, aging Broadway producer who ekes out a living romancing lascivious wealthy elderly women in exchange for money for his next play. Nebbish accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) arrives at Bialystock's office to do his books and discovers there is a two thousand dollar overcharge in the accounts of Bialystock's last play, because he raised more money than he could repay by selling more than 100% of the shares in the potential profits. Bialystock persuades Bloom to hide the relatively minor fraud, and, while shuffling numbers, Bloom has a revelation: a producer could make a lot more money with a flop than a hit. Bialystock immediately puts this scheme into action. They will over-sell shares again, but on a much larger scale and produce a play that will close on opening night. No one audits the books of a play presumed to have lost money, thus avoiding a pay-out and leaving the duo free to flee to Rio de Janeiro with the profits. Leo is afraid such a criminal venture will fail and they will go to prison; but Max eventually convinces him that his drab existence is no better than prison.
After reading many bad plays, the partners find the obvious choice for their scheme: Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden. It is "a love letter to Hitler" written in total sincerity by deranged ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars), whose name is German for "Frank Lovechild". They persuade him to sign over the stage rights, telling him they want to show the world "the Hitler you loved, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler with a song in his heart." To guarantee that the show is a flop, they hire Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewett), a director whose plays "close on the first day of rehearsal". The part of Hitler goes to a charismatic but only semi-coherent, flower power hippie named Lorenzo St. DuBois, a.k.a. L.S.D. (Dick Shawn), who can barely remember his own name and had mistakenly wandered into their theater during the casting call. After Bialystock sells 25,000% of the play to his regular investors (dozens of lustful little old ladies), they are sure they are on their way to Rio.
The result of all of this is a cheerfully upbeat and utterly tasteless musical play purporting to be about the happy home life of a brutal dictator. It opens with a lavish production of the title song, "Springtime For Hitler", which celebrates Nazi Germany crushing Europe ("Springtime for Hitler and Germany/Winter for Poland and France"). Unfortunately for Bialystock and Bloom, their attempt backfires as, after initial dumbfounded disbelief, the audience finds L.S.D.'s beatnik-like portrayal (and misunderstanding of the story) to be hilarious and misinterpret the production as a satire. Springtime For Hitler is declared a smash-hit, which means, of course, the investors will be expecting a larger financial return than can be paid out.
As the stunned partners turn on each other, they are confronted by a gun-wielding Franz Liebkind, who is enraged and humiliated by L.S.D.'s portrayal of Hitler, accuses them of breaking the "Siegfried Oath". After a reconciliation, the three band together and blow up the theater to end the production. They are injured, arrested, and tried. In spite of Leo's impassioned statement praising Max (while also referring to him as "the most selfish man I have ever met in my life") the jury finds them "incredibly guilty" and they go to prison.  In the end, Leo, Max, and Franz go back to producing plays with their fellow inmates ("Prisoners of Love"). Leo Bloom, however, continues the same old scam of overselling shares of the play to the other prisoners (20-30%) and even to the warden (50%). The song is performed while the credits are shown.

Mel Brooks wanted to title the film Springtime For Hitler, but Embassy Pictures producer Joseph E. Levine would not let him. Then, following a screening that Peter Sellers attended, both he and Levine talked about a release for the film, which he liked a lot. When Brooks was brought in, he chose the film's popular title. Sellers was one of several actors considered for the film.  
The original screenplay had Franz Liebkind make Max and Leo swear The Siegfried Oath. Accompanied by The Ride of the Valkyries, they promised fealty to Siegfried, Wagner, Nietzsche, Hindenburg, the Graf Spee, the Blue Max, and "Adolf You-Know-Who". The Siegfried Oath was restored in the musical version.Original 1967 The Producers screenplay[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]  In a making-of documentary that accompanied the 2002 DVD release of the film,[tpl]IMDb title|0425221|The Making of The Producers[/tpl] Brooks says that Dustin Hoffman was originally cast as Liebkind.  According to Brooks, late on the night before shooting began, Hoffman begged Brooks to let him out of his commitment to do the role so that he could audition for the starring role in The Graduate.  Brooks was aware of the film, which co-starred Brooks' wife, Anne Bancroft, and, skeptical that Hoffman would get the role, agreed to let him audition. When Hoffman did win playing Ben Braddock, Brooks called Kenneth Mars in as Liebkind. Another man he called in was Bill Macy, who played the jury foreman in a cameo role. 
The film was shot at the Chelsea Studios in New York City, where the musical version (2005) was also shot.[tpl]cite book| url= http://books.google.com/books?id=wDpSaPkSt-8C&pg=PA231&dq=%22221+West+26th%22#v=onepage&q=%22221%20West%2026th%22&f=false |title= New York: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York| author= Richard Alleman | year= 2005 |publisher= Broadway Books | isbn= 0-7679-1634-4[/tpl] Additional footage included such midtown Manhattan locales as Central Park, the Empire State Building and Lincoln Center.
Writer-director Mel Brooks is heard briefly in the film, his voice dubbed over a dancer singing, "Don't be stupid, be a smarty/Come and join the Nazi Party", in the song Springtime For Hitler. His version of the line is also dubbed into each performance of the musical, as well as the 2005 movie version.

==Release==

According to Brooks, after the film was completed, Embassy executives refused to release it as being in "bad taste"; however, Peter Sellers saw the film privately and placed an advertisement in Variety in support of the film's wider release.
Sellers was familiar with the film because, according to Brooks, Sellers "had accepted the role of Bloom and then was never heard from again." The film premiered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on November 22, 1967[tpl]tcmdb title|id=87256|title=The Producers[/tpl] and subsequently had a limited release to only a small number of theaters.
It has been alleged that the film was "banned in Germany".[tpl]cite journal| title=Radio Times | date=24â€“30 November 2001[/tpl] Following the film's lackluster response in the UK, German distributors did decline to distribute it,[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] but their lack of interest did not technically constitute a ban.
In Sweden, however, the title literally translates as "Springtime For Hitler". As a result of its success, all but two of Mel Brooks movies in Swedish have been given similar titles: "Springtime For Mother-In-Law" (The Twelve Chairs); "Springtime For The Sheriff" (Blazing Saddles); "Springtime For Frankenstein" (Young Frankenstein); "Springtime For The Silent Movies" (Silent Movie); "Springtime For The Lunatics" (High Anxiety); "Springtime For World History" (History of the World, Part I); "Springtime For Space" (Spaceballs); and "Springtime For The Slum" (Life Stinks).

==Reception==

When it was first released, the film received a mixed response and garnered exceptionally harsh reviews from New York criticsâ€” Stanley Kauffmann ("the film bloats into sogginess", The New Republic); Pauline Kael ("amateurishly crude", The New Yorker); and Andrew Sarrisâ€”partly because of its directorial style and broad ethnic humor.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.filmforum.org/archivedfilms/prodnytimes.html| title=When The Nazis Became Nudniks| author=J. Hoberman| date=2001-04-15| work=New York Times| accessdate=2007-02-02[/tpl] Negative reviewers noted the bad taste and insensitivity of devising a broad comedy about two Jews conspiring to cheat theatrical investors by devising a designed-to-fail singing, dancing, tasteless Broadway musical show about Hitler, 23 years after the end of World War II.
Renata Adler wrote that it was a "violently mixed bag. Some of it is shoddy and gross and cruel; the rest is funny in an entirely unexpected way. It has the episodic, revue quality of so much contemporary comedyâ€”not building laughter, but stringing it together skit after skit, some vile, some boffo. It is less delicate than Lenny Bruce, less funny than Dr. Strangelove, but much funnier than The Loved One or What's New Pussycat?" According to her, Mostel is "overacting grotesquely" while co-star Wilder is "wonderful", playing his part "as though he were Dustin Hoffman being played by Danny Kaye".[tpl]cite web| url= http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173AE273BC4152DFB5668383679EDE | title= The Producers (1968)| date=March 19, 1968 | author= Renata Adler | publisher= The New York Times | accessdate= 2011-02-21[/tpl]
Others considered the film to be a great success. Time magazine's reviewers wrote that the film was "hilariously funny ... Unfortunately, the film is burdened with the kind of plot that demands resolution and ends in a whimper of sentimentality." Although they labelled it "disjointed and inconsistent",[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,837773-1,00.html|title=The Producers (review)|date=1968-01-26|author=|work=Time|accessdate=2007-02-02|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110524011143/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,837773-1,00.html|archivedate=May 24, 2011[/tpl] they also praised it as "a wildly funny joy ride",[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,838198-3,00.html|title=Arts & Entertainment (Cinema)|date=1968-04-19|author=|work=time.com|accessdate=2007-02-02[/tpl] and concluded by saying that "despite its bad moments, it is some of the funniest American cinema comedy in years."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902162-3,00.html|title=Arts & Entertainment (Cinema)|date=1968-05-10|author=|work=time.com|accessdate=2007-02-02[/tpl] The film industry trade paper Variety wrote, "The film is unmatched in the scenes featuring Mostel and Wilder alone together, and several episodes with other actors are truly rare." Over the years, the film has gained in stature, garnering a 93% certified fresh rating from Rotten Tomatoes. (the site's consensus reads the following: "A hilarious satire of the business side of Hollywood, The Producers is one of Mel Brooks' finest, as well as funniest films, featuring standout performances by Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel.") On Metacritic, the film holds an extremely high rating of 97, making it one of the highest rated films on the site as well as the second highest rated comedy (behind The Wizard of Oz). In his review decades late Roger Ebert later claimed that "this is one of the funniest movies ever made."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1016819-producers/ |title=The Producers (1968) Reviews[/tpl] RottenTomatoes.com[tpl]cite web| title= The Producers (1968) |  url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000723/REVIEWS08/7230301/1023 |date= July 23, 2000 | author= Roger Ebert| publisher= Chicago Sun-Times | accessdate=2011-02-21[/tpl] Ebert wrote,
 "I remember finding myself in an elevator with Brooks and his wife, actress Anne Bancroft, in New York City a few months after The Producers was released. A woman got onto the elevator, recognized him and said, 'I have to tell you, Mr. Brooks, that your movie is vulgar.' Brooks smiled benevolently. 'Lady,' he said, 'it rose below vulgarity.'  
Reviews in Britain were positive to very positive.
It has since been noted that the plot of Brooks' film bears an uncanny resemblance to that of the British movie Mister Ten Per Cent (1967). The similarity is noted in the sleeve notes of the 2014 DVD release of the earlier film (which starred British comedian Charlie Drake) and in a number of reviews on IMDb.
