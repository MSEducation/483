Raymond Breton (b. at Baune, 3 September 1609; d. at Caen, 8 January 1679) was a French Dominican missionary and linguist among the Caribbean Indians, and in particular the Garifuna (formerly known as Black Caribs to Europeans, and as Callinago amongst themselves).

==Life==

Breton entered the Order of St. Dominic at the age of seventeen and was sent (1627) to the priory of St. Jacques, at Paris, to finish his classical education and make his course of philosophy and theology. Having obtained his degree in theology, he sailed with three other Dominicans for the French West Indies in 1635, and was among the first Europeans to live on Guadeloupe.Sybille de Pury and Marcella Lewis, "The language of the Callinago people: Father Breton's Dictionnaire caraïbe-français (1665) compared with Garifuna" (2001), http://www.sup-infor.com/ultimes/garifuna_a/garifuna_a-ina.htm
Breton devoted nearly twenty years to missionary activity in the Antilles. From 1641 to 1651 he was on Dominica, living with the Caribs.Gerald H. Anderson, Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions (1999), p. 89. He also spent time going from island to island, teaching and evangelizing the natives in their own tongue, through which he became an adept in the various Carib languages. According to Breton, he arrived on Saint Vincent at one point, but did not stay because local Caribs had killed two prior proselytizers.Sybille de Pury and Marcella Lewis, "The language of the Callinago people: Father Breton's Dictionnaire caraïbe-français (1665) compared with Garifuna" (2001), http://www.sup-infor.com/ultimes/garifuna_a/garifuna_a-ina.htm
Returning to France in 1654, he devoted much of his time to preparing young priests for the West Indian missions.
