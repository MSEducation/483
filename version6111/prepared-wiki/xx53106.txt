==History==

Before the 19th century, the area now occupied by Camberley was referred to as Bagshot/Frimley Heath, which was known as a haunt of highwaymen such as William Davies – known as the Golden Farmer – and Claude Duval. The land remained largely undeveloped and uncultivated due to a sandy topsoil making it unsuitable for farming. In A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain, written between 1724 and 1726, Daniel Defoe described the area as barren and sterile; "a mark of the just resentment shew'd by Heaven upon the Englishmen's pride... horrid and frightful to look on, not only good for little, but good for nothing".[tpl]cite web|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/d/defoe/daniel/britain/complete.html |title=A tour through the whole island of Great Britain |publisher=Ebooks.adelaide.edu.au |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl]

===19th century===

The town as it now stands has its roots in the building of The Royal Military College, which later became the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, in 1812. A settlement known as "New Town" grew in the area around the college which in 1831 was renamed Yorktown, after Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany.[tpl]cite web|author=Philip Ralph Johnston |url=http://www.philipjohnston.com/rmas/history.htm |title=History of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst |publisher=Philipjohnston.com |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl] At this time, the population was 702. In 1848, the first parish church of St. Michael, Yorktown was built by Henry Woodyer, in an area formerly part of Frimley, itself only a chapelry of Ash.
Later, the Staff College was established to the east of the Academy, and a property speculator built the nearby Cambridge Hotel. The surrounding area became known as Cambridge Town, but was renamed "Camberley" in January 1877 to avoid confusion by the General Post Office with Cambridge in Cambridgeshire. The renaming of Camberley was mentioned in the 1963 film adaptation of William Golding's Lord of the Flies. The character Piggy states that the new name consisted of three parts; "Cam" taken from the original name of Cambridgetown, "ber" which means 'river', because there are many rivers in the area, and "ley" because it is a common ending for English town names in the area (as in neighbouring Frimley);[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/lord-of-the-flies-script.html |title=Film script for Lord of the Flies |publisher=Script-o-rama.com |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl] although the name was actually derived from the "Cam" stream which runs through the town (mainly underground), "Amber" Hill which was marked on John Norden's map of the area in 1607 and "ley" usually meaning a clearing in the woodland.George C. B. Poulter, The History of Camberley, 1937 Hugh Edwards, the child actor who played Piggy, attended Camberley Primary School which was demolished[tpl]When|date=February 2011[/tpl] to make way for the town centre redevelopment.
During the 19th century, Camberley grew in size. This was given added impetus with the arrival of the branch-line railway and railway station in 1878 and a reputation for healthy air, due to the vast number of pine trees, which were said to be good for those suffering from pulmonary disorders. By the end of the century the population had reached 8,400. Since then, the town has absorbed the original settlement of Yorktown, which is now regarded as part of Camberley.

===20th century===

The Southern Scott Scramble, the first known motorcycle scrambling event, took place on Camberley Heath on 29 March 1924. The event, won by A.B. Sparks, attracted a crowd in the thousands and is considered to be the first instance of what later developed in the sport of motocross. During the Second World War, the Old Dean common was used as an instruction camp of the Free French Forces. The Kremer prize was conceived in the Cambridge Hotel in Camberley in 1959 after Henry Kramer toured a Microcell factory.
The Old Dean housing estate was built in the 1950s on the "Old Dean Common" for residents of heavily bombed Surrey-area's homeless after World War II. Many of the roads on that half of the Old Dean are named after areas of London, with the others named after places on the common.
Camberley falls under the siren test area of Broadmoor Hospital, a secure mental hospital in nearby Crowthorne. The siren was installed following a public outcry at the escape of child-murderer John Thomas Straffen in April 1952. The siren is still tested every Monday at 10am.
In 1969 there was an outbreak of rabies when a dog, just released from a sixth month quarantine after returning from Germany, attacked two people on Camberley Common. The scare resulted in restriction orders for dogs and large-scale shoots to carry out the destruction of foxes and other wildlife.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.historytoday.com/neil-pemberton/mad-dogs-and-englishmen|title=Mad Dogs and Englishmen|publisher=History Today|issue=9|volume=57|author=Neil Pemberton|year=2007|accessdate=29 December 2013[/tpl]

===21st century===

After much debate and delay (plans having been discussed for over half a decade), construction started in May 2006 on a new [tpl]convert|7|acre|ha|adj=on[/tpl] mixed-use development west of Park Street. Named 'The Atrium', the new development includes residential, leisure and retail facilities, as well as a 900 space car park. There are 217 'design-led' apartments divided into three areas within the complex (named Centro, Aspect and Courtyard). Fourteen new retail units face directly onto Park Street, opposite the Main Square shopping centre. Park Street has been pedestrianised and landscaped as part of the development. Leisure facilities include a nine-screen cinema, bowling alley, a health and fitness club, cafés and restaurants. Various elements of The Atrium was opened during 2008, with the final elements, the main cinema and bowling Alley, opening in October and November 2008 respectively.Surrey Heath Website – Atrium Update[tpl]dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl]
In 2009 the town's households were named by Experian as having the highest CO2 footprint in the UK, estimated at 28.05 tonnes per household per year (compared to 18.36 tonnes for the lowest, South Shields).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.experian.co.uk/search/index.html?cx=018221729092257204127%3A2-4ig1wazeo&cof=FORID%3A10%3BNB%3A1&ie=UTF-8&q=camberley&sa.x=0&sa.y=0&sa=Search|title=Carbon footprint |publisher=Experian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl]

==Geography==

Camberley is in the far west of Surrey, adjacent to the boundaries of Hampshire's Hart district and Berkshire's Bracknell Forest district. It lies directly between the A30 national route and M3 motorway (junction 4 exit). It is at the northern edge of the Blackwater Valley conurbation, [tpl]convert|5|mi|km[/tpl] north of Farnborough, [tpl]convert|8|mi|km[/tpl] south of Bracknell and [tpl]convert|17|mi|km[/tpl] east of Basingstoke.
The smaller town of Frimley, being so close to Camberley, is often regarded as part of the town, although the two are, for the most part, separated by the M3 motorway. Frimley has its own town centre, a major regional hospital (Frimley Park) and extensive suburban areas. In the 19th century, Yorktown and Camberley were in the ecclesiastical parish of Frimley.
The neighbouring town of Blackwater, [tpl]convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] to the west is also considered by some to be a suburb of Camberley, although it is in the Hart District of Hampshire and has its own town council (together with Hawley). The same could be said for Sandhurst which is home of "The Meadows" retail park and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, all of which are in the Bracknell Forest borough of Berkshire.

==Economy==

Camberley's town centre is host to The Mall shopping centre, built around the Main Square. This is a late 1980s development anchored by stores such as House of Fraser. The Main Square features a large clock in the centre of the complex opposite a Primark store. The High Street has a number of shops as well as bars and clubs, many of the latter being more recent additions. There are a number of secondary shopping streets including Park Street, Princess Way and parts of London Road, including the  "Atrium" development.
Major employers include Siemens, which moved its UK headquarters to the area in 2007, Burlington Group who moved into Watchmoor Park in 2009 and Sun Microsystems, until they were taken over by Oracle in 2010, whose UK headquarters was located just across the Hampshire border in Minley next to the M3 motorway at junction 4a.http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/apr/20/oracle-buys-sun-microsystems "The Guardian", 20 April 2009, accessed 19 February 2011, Krispy Kreme UK are based in Albany Park, an industrial estate to the south of the town centre.– Contact details for Krispy Kreme

==Culture==

The town has its own public library, cinema and theatre and is home to the Surrey Heath Borough Council offices. The Vue cinema opened in The Atrium development in late 2008 the year after an older cinema, owned by Robin's Cinemas, and situated on London Road some distance from the town centre, burned down in 2007 after having closed in 2003.
Camberley and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst are featured in a Doctor Who comic story entitled "The Warkeeper's Crown".

==Landmarks==

A familiar landmark in Camberley is the concrete pipe white elephant which is on the A30 approaching The Meadows roundabout. This was created as advertising by a pipe company which rented the premises. When they closed down, the upkeep of the elephant was written into the tenancy contract, so subsequent businesses have continued to look after it.
A brick tower was built on top of The Knoll in the 1760s, by John Norris of Blackwater. It may have been used for communications but there is no firm evidence. The remains are now known as The Obelisk.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.surreyheath.gov.uk/leisure/leisureactivitiesinsurreyheath/obelisk.htm|title=The Obelisk |publisher=Surrey Heath Borough Council|accessdate=24 November 2012[/tpl]

==Transport==

Camberley railway station is situated south of the town centre on the Ascot to Guildford line. It is connected to Guildford, Aldershot and Ascot by South West Trains with two trains per hour in either direction.
Due to Camberley's inconvenient situation between the South Western Main Line and the Waterloo to Reading Line, and capacity and stock constraints on the latter mainline, direct services to and from London Waterloo only run at peak hours, running via Ascot and Richmond. At all other times, passengers from Camberley must change at Ascot or Ash Vale for connections to London. Additionally, nearby Farnborough station provides trains to Waterloo, Basingstoke and Portsmouth.
Nearby Blackwater station (situated perpendicular to the A30 on the border of Hampshire, Surrey and Berkshire) on the North Downs Line is operated by First Great Western, with trains running to Reading, Guildford, Redhill and Gatwick Airport.
Several bus companies operate routes through Camberley including: First Berkshire & The Thames Valley to Bracknell; Arriva Guildford & West Surrey to Guildford via Woking; Stagecoach South to Aldershot, Basingstoke and Farnborough; and Dicksons Travel to Staines and Woking.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/roads-and-transport/buses-and-trains/bus-timetables/blackwater-valley-bus-timetables|publisher=Surrey County Council|title=Blackwater Valley bus timetables|date=16 November 2012|accessdate=24 November 2012[/tpl]
Camberley lies on the A30 and lies between Junction 3 and Junction 4 of the M3 motorway.
There are two small airports nearby: Farnborough Airfield at Farnborough and Blackbushe Airport near Yateley. Farnborough Airfield is well known for its International Air Show. Heathrow is [tpl]convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] away.
The A30 leaving Camberley to the north for Bagshot has a large junction named the "Jolly Farmer Roundabout" named after the Public House that stood on it.  The pub was named after a local highwayman.
