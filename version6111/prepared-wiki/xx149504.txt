Snow was a 5-foot-8, 195-pound speedster who attended the now-defunct Cincinnati Academy of Physical Education. In his four seasons, he led the Crusaders to a 45-3 record and state championships in 1985 and 1986, his final two years of high school.
He ran for more than 2,000 yards in three straight seasons and also showed prowess on defense.
