==Synopsis==

Min-Jun (Song Il-Kook) and Ji-Won (Son Ye-Jin) are so-called the first-rate "players" who are dating gurus with 100% success rates in any dating pursuits. Following her usual systematic dating rules, Ji-Won fakes a schematic car accident to capture Min-Jun's attention and successfully approaches him.
However, her smooth-sailing dating life finally encounters turbulence. Why in the world is this guy not succumbing to her alluring charm? Ironically enough, Min-Jun is also overwhelmed by the understanding that he has met his match. However, like the veteran players that they are, these two shouldn't show any signs of weakness in their dating tactics. Who will emerge victorious and become the last player standing?[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kmdb.or.kr/eng/md_basic.asp?nation=K&p_dataid=06751|title=The Art of Seduction ( Jag-eob-ui Jeong-seok ) (2005)|accessdate=2007-01-17|work=KMDb Korean Movie Database|date=21 December 2005[/tpl]
