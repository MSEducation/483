CATEGORIES: High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Canada, Lists of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom, Lists of ambassadors to Canada

The High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Canada is the United Kingdom's foremost diplomatic representative in Canada, and in charge of the UK's diplomatic mission in Canada.
As fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations, diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Canada are at governmental level, rather than between heads of state.  Thus, the countries exchange high commissioners, rather than ambassadors.
The United Kingdom's High Commissioner's residence is Earnscliffe. The residence was built in 1855, was first occupied by Canada's first Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, and was bought in 1930 by the first High Commissioner to Canada, Sir William Clark.
Offices of the Commission are located at 80 Elgin Street, Ottawa.
