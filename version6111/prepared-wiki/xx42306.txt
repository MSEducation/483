Eleanor Hibbert (1 September 1906 – 18 January 1993) was an English author who combined imagination with facts to bring history alive through novels of fiction and romance. She was a prolific writer who published several books a year in different literary genres, each genre under a different pen name: Jean Plaidy for fictionalized history of European royalty; Victoria Holt for gothic romances, and Philippa Carr for a multi-generational family saga. She also wrote light romances, crime novels, murder mysteries and thrillers under the names Eleanor Burford, Elbur Ford, Kathleen Kellow, Anna Percival, and Ellalice Tate.
In 1989, the Romance Writers of America gave her the Golden Treasure award in recognition of her significant contributions to the romance genre.[tpl]cite web | title= RWA Awards| url= http://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=543 |publisher= Romance Writers of America (RWA) |accessdate=April 18, 2014 [/tpl] By the time of her death, she had written more than 200 books that worldwide sold more than 100 million copies in 20 languages.[tpl]cite news | title= Eleanor Hibbert, Novelist Known As Victoria Holt and Jean Plaidy | url= http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/21/books/eleanor-hibbert-novelist-known-as-victoria-holt-and-jean-plaidy.html |publisher= The New York Times |date= 21 January 1993 |accessdate= April 18, 2014 [/tpl] She continues to be a widely borrowed author among lending libraries.[tpl]cite news | title= Library lending figures: which books are most popular? | url= http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/feb/08/library-lending-figures-books-most-popular | author= Ami Sedghi |publisher= The Guardian UK |date= Feb 8, 2013 |accessdate=April 18, 2014 [/tpl] Her popular works of historical fiction are appreciated by readers and critics alike for their accuracy, quality of writing, and attention to detail.[tpl]cite news | title= All About Jean Plaidy | url= http://jeanplaidy.tripod.com/id17.htm | author= Richard Dalby |publisher= Book and Magazine Collector #109 |date=  April 1993 |accessdate=April 18, 2014 [/tpl]

===Writing career===

At first Eleanor tried to emulate her literary heroes – the Brontës, George Eliot, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, and Leo Tolstoy – and during the 1930s she completed nine long novels, all of them serious psychological studies of contemporary life. However, none of these were accepted for publication. Determined to succeed, she tried her hand at short stories for newspapers such as the Daily Mail and Evening News. Some also appeared in The Star, Woman's Realm and Ladies' Home Journal. The literary editor of the Daily Mail was credited with steering her writing in the right direction; he told her, "You're barking up the wrong tree: you must write something which is saleable, and the easiest way is to write romantic fiction."
She published her first novel in 1941 under the name of Eleanor Burford, her maiden name, which she used for her contemporary novels. By 1961 she had published 32 novels under this name, including ten romance novels for Mills & Boon.
In 1950, she chose the pseudonym Jean Plaidy for her historical novels about the crowned heads of Europe. The name was inspired by Plaidy Beach near the Hibberts' home in Looe, Cornwall during World War II.[tpl]cite news | title= Jean Plaidy, Romance writer | url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-01-21/news/1993021024_1_jean-plaidy-klan-ku-klux |publisher= The Baltimore Sun |date= January 21, 1993 |accessdate=April 18, 2014 [/tpl]  Her books written under this pseudonym were popular with the general public and were also hailed by critics and historians for their historical accuracy, quality of writing, and attention to detail.[tpl]cite web | title= Eleanor Alice Hibbert | url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/264785/Eleanor-Alice-Hibbert |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=April 18, 2014 [/tpl] Her Borgia trilogy was among the first to show Lucrezia not as an amoral poisoner but as an innocent pawn and victim of her family's political machinations, an interpretation more in accordance with the historical record than the traditional one. All 90 of Hibbert's Jean Plaidy novels were published by the firm of Robert Hale, who originally told her literary agents, A.M. Heath, "Will you tell this author that there are glittering prizes ahead for those who can write as she does?"[tpl]cite news | title= Obituary: Jean Plaidy | url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-jean-plaidy-1479699.html | author= Elizabeth Walter |publisher= The Independent |date= 20 January 1993 |accessdate=April 18, 2014 [/tpl]
From 1950 to 1953 she wrote four novels as Elbur Ford, a pen name derived from her maiden name, Eleanor Burford. Between 1952 to 1960 she used the pseudonym Kathleen Kellow to write eight novels that were mostly crime and mystery fiction. From 1956 to 1961 she wrote five novels as Ellalice Tate, a pseudonym inspired by her mother's name, Alice Tate.[tpl]cite news | title= Eleanor Hibbert; Wrote As Victoria Holt, Jean Plaidy | url= http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930121&slug=1681063 | work = Associated Press |publisher= The Seattle Times |date= January 21, 1993|accessdate=April 18, 2014 [/tpl]
In 1960, at the suggestion of her agent, Patricia Schartle Myrer, she wrote her first Gothic romance, The Mistress of Mellyn, under the name Victoria Holt. Published by Doubleday in the United States, it became an instant international bestseller.[tpl]cite news | title= Eleanor Hibbert 1906-1993| url= https://suite.io/carolyn-m-cash/2zrs26e | author= Carolyn Cash |publisher= Writers Voice June–July 2007 Bulletin of the Fellowship of Australian Writers NSW Inc |date= 2007|accessdate=April 18, 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | title= Booksellers Mixed on Fall Outlook | url= http://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/05/business/the-media-business-booksellers-mixed-on-fall-outlook.html | author= Edwin McDowell |publisher= The New York Times |date= June 5, 1990 |accessdate=April 18, 2014 [/tpl] Hibbert wrote a further 31 novels as Victoria Holt, the last of which, The Black Opal, was published after her death. These novels were primarily historical fiction set in the late 19th century.
Hibbert wrote just one novel under the name Anna Percival, a pseudonym inspired by her husband's middle name, Percival.
She created her last pseudonym, Philippa Carr, in 1972 at the suggestion of her publisher, William Collins, to create a new series showing successive generations of English gentlewomen involved in important historical events starting with the Reformation and ending with World War II.
Hibbert was a profilic writer, churning out multiple books in a year under different pseduonyms, chiefly Jean Plaidy, Victoria Holt and Philippa Carr.[tpl]cite news | title= The Price Perplex | url= http://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/30/books/paperback-talk-the-price-perplex.html | author= Judith Appelbaum |publisher= The New York Times |date= January 30, 1983 |accessdate=April 18, 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | title= Eleanor Hibbert; Prolific Romance Novelist | url=  http://articles.latimes.com/1993-01-22/news/mn-1606_1_eleanor-hibbert | work= Times Wire Services |publisher= LA Times |date= January 22, 1993 |accessdate=April 18, 2014 [/tpl]

In the Spring of 2003 Three Rivers Press, an imprint of U.S.A. publisher Crown Publishing Group, started republishing Jean Plaidy's stories.[tpl]cite journal |last=Donahue |first=Dick |title=Love & history --- a perfect match |journal=Publishers Weekly |date=12 Nov 2001 |issue=248.46 |pages=24–30 |quote=Eight years after her death, Eleanor Hibbert (1906–1993)--aka Jean Plaidy, Victoria Halt and Philippa Carr—continues to ride a wave of historical romance popularity. Last month, Three Rivers Press inked a deal with Hibbert's agent, Elizabeth Winick of McIntosh and Otis Inc., to reissue 10 Jean Plaidy books in trade paperback. 'They're going to do a guaranteed first printing of 30,000 to 35,000,' says Winick, who in just the past few weeks has also received requests from Eastern Europe to reprint several Plaidy titles. Crown associate editor Rachel Kahan, who acquired the books, adds, 'We have gotten a lot of good feedback about the books from our reps. We're going to publish two a season, and we'll redesign the covers to give them a really elegant look.'[/tpl][tpl]cite journal| last=Dyer |first=Lucinda |title=To be continued: publishers and authors are finding clever new ways to connect the series dots—and significantly grow the readership|journal=Publishers Weekly|date=11 Nov 2002|issue=249.45|pages=26–31|accessdate=31 October 2010|quote=As such, she's particularly excited to be republishing two of the 90 or so novels of Jean Plaidy in spring 2003: Lady in the Tower and A Rose Without a Thorn.
