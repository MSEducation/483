William Ford Gibson (born March 17, 1948) is an American-Canadian speculative fiction novelist who has been called the "noir prophet" of the cyberpunk subgenre. Gibson coined the term "cyberspace" in his short story "Burning Chrome" (1982) and later popularized the concept in his debut novel, Neuromancer (1984). In envisaging cyberspace, Gibson created an iconography for the information age before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s.[tpl]cite web |last=Schactman |first=Noah | work=Wired |title=26 Years After Gibson, Pentagon Defines 'Cyberspace' |url=http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/05/pentagon-define.html |date=2008-05-23[/tpl] He is also credited with predicting the rise of reality television and with establishing the conceptual foundations for the rapid growth of virtual environments such as video games and the World Wide Web.
Having changed residence frequently with his family as a child, Gibson became a shy, ungainly teenager who often read science fiction. After spending his adolescence at a private boarding school in Arizona, Gibson evaded the draft during the Vietnam War by emigrating to Canada in 1968, where he became immersed in the counterculture. After settling in Vancouver he eventually became a full-time writer. He retains dual citizenship. Gibson's early works are bleak, noir near-future stories about the effect of cybernetics and computer networks on humans—a "combination of lowlife and high tech". The short stories were published in popular science fiction magazines. The themes, settings and characters developed in these stories culminated in his first novel, Neuromancer, which garnered critical and commercial success, virtually initiating the cyberpunk literary genre.
Although much of Gibson's reputation has remained associated with Neuromancer, his work has continued to evolve. After expanding on Neuromancer with two more novels to complete the dystopic Sprawl trilogy, Gibson became an important author of another science fiction sub-genre—steampunk—with the 1990 alternate history novel The Difference Engine, written with Bruce Sterling. In the 1990s, he composed the Bridge trilogy of novels, which focused on sociological observations of near-future urban environments and late capitalism. His most recent novels—Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007) and Zero History (2010)—are set in a contemporary world and have put his work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.
Gibson is one of the best-known North American science fiction writers, fêted by The Guardian in 1999 as "probably the most important novelist of the past two decades". Gibson has written more than twenty short stories and ten critically acclaimed novels (one in collaboration), and has contributed articles to several major publications and collaborated extensively with performance artists, filmmakers and musicians. His thought has been cited as an influence on science fiction authors, design, academia, cyberculture, and technology.

==Early life==

===Childhood, itinerance, and adolescence===

William Ford Gibson was born in the coastal city of Conway, South Carolina, and spent most of his childhood in Wytheville, Virginia, a small town in the Appalachians where his parents had been born and raised.[tpl]cite news |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/sciencefiction/story/0,,2146989,00.html |title=Space to think |accessdate=2007-10-26 |last=Adams |first=Tim |coauthors=Emily Stokes, James Flint |date=2007-08-12 |work=Books by genre |publisher=The Observer | location=London[/tpl] His family moved frequently during Gibson's youth owing to his father's position as manager of a large construction company. In Norfolk, Virginia, Gibson attended Pines Elementary School, where the teachers' lack of encouragement for him to read was a cause of dismay for his parents. While Gibson was still a young child,[tpl]Ref_label|A|I|none[/tpl] a little over a year into his stay at Pines Elementary, his father choked to death in a restaurant while on a business trip. His mother, unable to tell William the bad news, had someone else inform him of the death. Tom Maddox has commented that Gibson "grew up in an America as disturbing and surreal as anything J. G. Ballard ever dreamed".
A few days after the death, Gibson's mother returned them from their home in Norfolk to Wytheville. Gibson later described Wytheville as "a place where modernity had arrived to some extent but was deeply distrusted" and credits the beginnings of his relationship with science fiction, his "native literary culture", with the subsequent feeling of abrupt exile. At the age of 12, Gibson "wanted nothing more than to be a science fiction writer".[tpl]cite journal|journal=New Scientist|accessdate=2008-11-17|title= Sci-fi special: William Gibson|first=William |last=Gibson |date=November 12, 2008|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026821.600-scifi-special-william-gibson.html[/tpl] He spent a few unproductive years at basketball-obsessed George Wythe High School, a time spent largely in his room listening to records and reading books. At 13, unbeknownst to his mother, he purchased an anthology of Beat writing, thereby gaining exposure to the writings of Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William S. Burroughs; the lattermost had a particularly pronounced effect, greatly altering Gibson's notions of the possibilities of science fiction literature.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.07/gibson.html|title=God's Little Toys: Confessions of a cut & paste artist |last=Gibson|first=William |date=July 2005|publisher=Wired.com |accessdate=2007-11-04[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = McCaffery | first = Larry | authorlink = Larry McCaffery | title = Storming the Reality Studio: a casebook of cyberpunk and postmodern science fiction | accessdate = 2007-11-05 | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham, North Carolina | isbn = 978-0-8223-1168-3 | oclc = 23384573 | pages = 263–285 | chapter = An Interview with William Gibson | chapterurl =http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/gibson_interview.html | year = 1991[/tpl]
A shy, ungainly teenager, Gibson grew up in a monoculture he found "highly problematic", consciously rejected religion and took refuge in reading science fiction as well as writers such as Burroughs and Henry Miller.[tpl]cite news |first=John |last=Marshall |title=William Gibson's new novel asks, is the truth stranger than science fiction today? |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/books/107368_gibson06.shtml |work=Books |publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=2003-02-06 |accessdate=2007-11-03 [/tpl] Becoming frustrated with his poor academic performance, Gibson's mother threatened to send him to a boarding school; to her surprise, he reacted enthusiastically. Unable to afford his preferred choice of Southern California, his then "chronically anxious and depressive" mother, who had remained in Wytheville since the death of her husband, sent him to Southern Arizona School for Boys in Tucson, Arizona. He resented the structure of the private boarding school, but was in retrospect grateful for its forcing him to engage socially. He took the SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) exams, scoring 5 out of 150 in mathematics and 148 out of 150 in the written section, to the consternation of his teachers.

===Draft-dodging, exile, and counterculture===

After his mother's death when he was eighteen, Gibson left school without graduating and became very isolated for a long time, traveling to California and Europe and immersing himself in the counterculture. In 1967, he elected to move to Canada in order "to avoid the Vietnam war draft". At his draft hearing, he honestly informed interviewers that his intention in life was to sample every mind-altering substance in existence. Gibson has observed that he "did not literally evade the draft, as they never bothered drafting me"; after the hearing he went home and purchased a bus ticket to Toronto, and left a week or two later.[tpl]cite video |people= Mark Neale (director), William Gibson (subject) |title=No Maps for These Territories |publisher=Docurama |medium=Documentary |date =2000[/tpl] In the biographical documentary No Maps for These Territories (2000) Gibson said that his decision was motivated less by conscientious objection than by a desire to "sleep with hippie chicks" and indulge in hashish. He elaborated on the topic in a 2008 interview:
[tpl]Quotation|When I started out as a writer I took credit for draft evasion where I shouldn't have. I washed up in Canada with some vague idea of evading the draft but then I was never drafted so I never had to make the call. I don't know what I would have done if I'd really been drafted. I wasn't a tightly wrapped package at that time. If somebody had drafted me I might have wept and gone. I wouldn't have liked it of course.|William Gibson|interview with io9, June 10, 2008.[tpl]cite interview |last=Gibson |first=William |interviewer=Annalee Newitz |title=William Gibson Talks to io9 About Canada, Draft Dodging, and Godzilla |city=San Francisco |date= June 10, 2008 |program=io9 |url=http://io9.com/5015137/william-gibson-talks-to-io9-about-canada-draft-dodging-and-godzilla |accessdate=2008-06-10[/tpl][/tpl]
After weeks of nominal homelessness, Gibson was hired as the manager of Toronto's first head shop, a retailer of drug paraphernalia.[tpl]cite episode |title=William Gibson |episodelink= |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/3ade8915#p00941v7 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |series=Desert Island Discs |serieslink=Desert Island Discs |credits= |network=BBC |station=BBC Radio 4 |city= |airdate=9:00 Friday, November 19, 1999 |began= |ended= |season= |seriesno= |number= |minutes= |time=16:41 |transcript= |transcripturl= |quote= "For a couple of weeks I was essentially homeless, although it was such a delightful, floating, pleasant period that it now seems strange to me to think that I was in fact homeless.

Gibson has recounted that they concentrated their travels on European nations with fascist regimes and favourable exchange rates, including spending time on a Greek archipelago and in Istanbul in 1970, as they "couldn't afford to stay anywhere that had anything remotely like hard currency".[tpl]cite web |url= http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/William_Gibson/rogers_gibson.interview |title=In Same Universe |accessdate=2007-11-06 |author=Mike Rogers |date=1993-10-01 |publisher=Lysator Sweden Science Fiction Archive |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/200704/www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/english016/gibson/gibson2.int |archivedate=2007-04-19[/tpl]
The couple married and settled in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1972, with Gibson looking after their first child while they lived off his wife's teaching salary. During the 1970s, Gibson made a substantial part of his living from scouring Salvation Army thrift stores for underpriced artifacts he would then up-market to specialist dealers.[tpl]cite journal |url= http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.01/ebay.html |title=My Obsession |last=Gibson |first=William |accessdate=2007-12-02 |journal=Wired.com |date=January 1999 |issue=7.01 [/tpl] Realizing that it was easier to sustain high college grades, and thus qualify for generous student financial aid, than to work, he enrolled at the University of British Columbia (UBC), earning "a desultory bachelor's degree in English" in 1977. Through studying English literature, he was exposed to a wider range of fiction than he would have read otherwise; something he credits with giving him ideas inaccessible from within the culture of science fiction, including an awareness of postmodernity. It was at UBC that he attended his first course on science fiction, taught by Susan Wood, at the end of which he was encouraged to write his first short story, "Fragments of a Hologram Rose".

===Post-graduation, early writing, and the evolution of cyberpunk===

After considering pursuing a master's degree on the topic of hard science fiction novels as fascist literature, Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records.[tpl]cite book | last = Calcutt | first = Andrew | title = Cult Fiction | publisher = Contemporary Books | location = Chicago | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-8092-2506-4 |oclc = 42363052[/tpl] During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant on a film history course at his alma mater. Impatient at much of what he saw at a science fiction convention in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author John Shirley.[tpl]cite book | last = McCaffery | first = Larry | title = Storming the Reality Studio: a casebook of cyberpunk and postmodern science fiction | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham, North Carolina | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-8223-1168-3 | oclc = 23384573[/tpl] The two became immediate and lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.
Through Shirley, Gibson came into contact with science fiction authors Bruce Sterling and Lewis Shiner; reading Gibson's work, they realised that it was, as Sterling put it, "breakthrough material" and that they needed to "put down our preconceptions and pick up on this guy from Vancouver; this was the way forward." Gibson met Sterling at a science fiction convention in Denver, Colorado in the autumn of 1981, where he read "Burning Chrome" – the first cyberspace short story – to an audience of four people, and later stated that Sterling "completely got it".
In October 1982, Gibson traveled to Austin, Texas for ArmadilloCon, at which he appeared with Shirley, Sterling and Shiner on a panel called "Behind the Mirrorshades: A Look at Punk SF", where Shiner noted "the sense of a movement solidified".[tpl]cite book | last = Shiner | first = Lewis |authorlink=Lewis Shiner |coauthors=George Edgar Slusser, Tom Shippey | title = Fiction 2000:Cyberpunk and the Future of Narrative | publisher = University of Georgia Press | location = Athens | year = 1992 | chapter=Inside the Movement: Past, Present and Future |isbn = 978-0-8203-1425-9 |oclc = 24953403[/tpl] After a weekend discussing rock and roll, MTV, Japan, fashion, drugs and politics, Gibson left the cadre for Vancouver, declaring half-jokingly that "a new axis has been formed." Sterling, Shiner, Shirley and Gibson, along with Rudy Rucker, went on to form the core of the radical cyberpunk literary movement.[ref]

==Literary career==

===Early short fiction===

Gibson's early writings are generally near-future stories about the influences of cybernetics and cyberspace (computer-simulated reality) technology on the human race. His themes of hi-tech shanty towns, recorded or broadcast stimulus (later to be developed into the "sim-stim" package featured so heavily in Neuromancer), and dystopic intermingling of technology and humanity, are already evident in his first published short story, "Fragments of a Hologram Rose", in the Summer 1977 issue of Unearth. The latter thematic obsession was described by his friend and fellow author, Bruce Sterling, in the introduction of Gibson's short story collection Burning Chrome, as "Gibson's classic one-two combination of lowlife and high tech."[tpl]cite book |last=Gibson |first=William |coauthors=Bruce Sterling | chapter= Introduction | title=Burning Chrome |year=1986 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-053982-8 |oclc = 51342671[/tpl]
Beginning in 1981, Gibson's stories appeared in Omni and Universe 11, wherein his fiction developed a bleak, film noir feel. He consciously distanced himself as far as possible from the mainstream of science fiction (towards which he felt "an aesthetic revulsion", expressed in "The Gernsback Continuum"), to the extent that his highest goal was to become "a minor cult figure, a sort of lesser Ballard." When Sterling started to distribute the stories, he found that "people were just genuinely baffled... I mean they literally could not parse the guy's paragraphs... the imaginative tropes he was inventing were just beyond peoples' grasp."
While Larry McCaffery has commented that these early short stories displayed flashes of Gibson's ability, science fiction critic Darko Suvin has identified them as "undoubtedly cyberpunk's best works", constituting the "furthest horizon" of the genre. The themes which Gibson developed in the stories, the Sprawl setting of "Burning Chrome" and the character of Molly Millions from "Johnny Mnemonic" ultimately culminated in his first novel, Neuromancer.

===Neuromancer===

Neuromancer was commissioned by Terry Carr for the second series of Ace Science Fiction Specials, which was intended to exclusively feature debut novels. Given a year to complete the work,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_09_01_archive.asp#1062520986072822474 |title=Neuromancer: The Timeline|accessdate=2007-11-26 |last=Gibson |first=William |date=2003-09-04[/tpl] Gibson undertook the actual writing out of "blind animal terror" at the obligation to write an entire novel – a feat which he felt he was "four or five years away from". After viewing the first 20 minutes of landmark cyberpunk film Blade Runner (1982) which was released when Gibson had written a third of the novel, he "figured Neuromancer was sunk, done for. Everyone would assume I'd copped my visual texture from this astonishingly fine-looking film."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_01_01_archive.asp#90199532 |title=Oh Well, While I'm Here: Bladerunner |accessdate=2008-01-21 |last=Gibson |first=William |date=2003-01-17[/tpl] He re-wrote the first two-thirds of the book twelve times, feared losing the reader's attention and was convinced that he would be "permanently shamed" following its publication; yet what resulted was a major imaginative leap forward for a first-time novelist.
Neuromancer's release was not greeted with fanfare, but it hit a cultural nerve, quickly becoming an underground word-of-mouth hit. It became the first winner of one science fiction "triple crown" —both Nebula and Hugo Awards as the year's best novel and Philip K. Dick Award as the best paperback original— eventually selling more than 6.5 million copies worldwide.[tpl]cite web |url= http://lrc.reviewcanada.ca/index.php?page=71---80 |title=77. Neuromancer (1984) |accessdate=2007-09-09 |last=Cheng |first=Alastair |work=The LRC 100: Canada's Most Important Books |publisher=Literary Review of Canada[/tpl]
Lawrence Person in his "Notes Toward a Postcyberpunk Manifesto" (1998) identified Neuromancer as "the archetypal cyberpunk work",[tpl]cite journal |last=Person |first=Lawrence |date=Winter–Spring 1998 |title=Notes Toward a Postcyberpunk Manifesto |journal=Nova Express |volume=4 |issue=4 |url= http://features.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/10/08/2123255 |accessdate= 2007-11-06[/tpl] and in 2005, Time included it in their list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923, opining that "there is no way to overstate how radical Neuromancer was when it first appeared."[tpl]cite news |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2005/10/16/all-time-100-novels/slide/neuromancer-1984-by-william-gibson/ |title=Neuromancer (1984) |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Grossman |first=Lev |coauthors=Richard Lacayo |work=TIME Magazine All-Time 100 Novels |publisher=Time | date=2005-10-16[/tpl] Literary critic Larry McCaffery described the concept of the matrix in Neuromancer as a place where "data dance with human consciousness... human memory is literalized and mechanized... multi-national information systems mutate and breed into startling new structures whose beauty and complexity are unimaginable, mystical, and above all nonhuman." Gibson later commented on himself as an author circa Neuromancer that "I'd buy him a drink, but I don't know if I'd loan him any money," and referred to the novel as "an adolescent's book". The success of Neuromancer was to effect the 35-year-old Gibson's emergence from obscurity.

===The Sprawl trilogy, The Difference Engine, and the Bridge trilogy===

Although much of Gibson's reputation has remained rooted in Neuromancer, his work continued to evolve conceptually and stylistically. Despite adding the final sentence of Neuromancer, "He never saw Molly again", at the last minute in a deliberate attempt to prevent himself from ever writing a sequel, he did precisely that with Count Zero (1986), a character-focused work set in the Sprawl alluded to in its predecessor.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_01_01_archive.asp#90158337 |title= (untitled weblog post) |accessdate=2008-01-21 |last=Gibson |first=William |date=2003-01-01[/tpl] He next intended to write an unrelated postmodern space opera, titled The Log of the Mustang Sally, but reneged on the contract with Arbor House after a falling out over the dustjacket art of their hardcover of Count Zero.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2005_08_01_archive.asp#112417337358385397 |title=The Log of the Mustang Sally |accessdate=2008-01-21 |last=Gibson |first=William |date=2005-08-15[/tpl] Abandoning The Log of the Mustang Sally, Gibson instead wrote Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988), which in the words of Larry McCaffery "turned off the lights" on cyberpunk literature. It was a culmination of his previous two novels, set in the same universe with shared characters, thereby completing the Sprawl trilogy. The trilogy solidified Gibson's reputation, with both later novels also earning Nebula and Hugo Award and Locus SF Award nominations [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1986 |title= 1986 Award Winners & Nominees |work= Worlds Without End |accessdate=2009-04-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1987 |title= 1987 Award Winners & Nominees |work= Worlds Without End |accessdate=2009-04-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1989 |title= 1989 Award Winners & Nominees |work= Worlds Without End |accessdate=2009-04-30[/tpl]
The Sprawl trilogy was followed by the 1990 novel The Difference Engine, an alternative history novel Gibson wrote in collaboration with Bruce Sterling. Set in a technologically advanced Victorian era Britain, the novel was a departure from the authors' cyberpunk roots. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1991 and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1992, and its success drew attention to the nascent steampunk literary genre of which it remains the best-known work.[tpl]cite news | first = Peter | last = Bebergal | title = The age of steampunk | url = http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/26/the_age_of_steampunk/ | publisher = The Boston Globe | page = 3 | date = 2007-08-26 | accessdate = 2007-10-14[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2009/jan/07/steampunk-chiang-lake-macleod |work=The Guardian |title=Steampunk: the future of the past |first=Damien G |last=Walter |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=January 11, 2009 |publisher=Guardian Media Group | location=London[/tpl]
Gibson's second series, the "Bridge trilogy", is composed of Virtual Light (1993), a "darkly comic urban detective story", Idoru (1996), and All Tomorrow's Parties (1999). It centers on San Francisco in the near future and evinces Gibson's recurring themes of technological, physical, and spiritual transcendence in a more grounded, matter-of-fact style than his first trilogy.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.playboy.com/arts-entertainment/reviews/books/spook-country/spook-country.html |title=Spook Country |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Alexander |first=Scott |date=August 9, 2007 |work=Arts & Entertainment |publisher=Playboy.com[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard notes that in the Bridge trilogy, Gibson's villains change from multinational corporations and artificial intelligences of the Sprawl trilogy to the mass media – namely tabloid television and the cult of celebrity.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.salon.com/books/feature/1999/07/27/macleod_interview/ |title=An engine of anarchy |last=Leonard |first=Andrew |date=1999-07-27 |work=Books |publisher=Salon.com[/tpl] Virtual Light depicts an "end-stage capitalism, in which private enterprise and the profit motive are taken to their logical conclusion". This argument on the mass media as the natural evolution of capitalism is the opening line of the major Situationist work The Society of the Spectacle. Leonard's review called Idoru a "return to form" for Gibson,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/1998/09/14/books_26/ |title=Is cyberpunk still breathing? |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Leonard |first=Andrew |date=1998-09-14 |publisher=Salon.com[/tpl] while critic Steven Poole asserted that All Tomorrow's Parties marked his development from "science-fiction hotshot to wry sociologist of the near future."

===Late period novels===

After All Tomorrow's Parties, Gibson began to adopt a more realist style of writing, with continuous narratives – "speculative fiction of the very recent past."[tpl]cite web |url= http://calitreview.com/2007/10/02/william-gibson-the-father-of-cyberpunk/ |title=An Interview With William Gibson The Father of Cyberpunk |accessdate=2007-10-04 |last= Dueben|first= Alex |date=2007-10-02 |publisher=California Literary Review[/tpl] Science fiction critic John Clute has interpreted this approach as Gibson's recognition that traditional science fiction is no longer possible "in a world lacking coherent 'nows' to continue from", characterizing it as "SF for the new century".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue305/excess.html |title=The Case of the World |last=Clute |first=John |authorlink=John Clute |accessdate=2007-10-14 |work=Excessive Candour |publisher=SciFi.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071030090441/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue305/excess.html |archivedate = October 30, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Gibson's novels Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007) and Zero History (2010) are set in the same contemporary universe — "more or less the same one we live in now"[tpl]cite journal|url= http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2080922,00.asp |title=Q&A: William Gibson |first=Angela |last=Chang |journal=PC Magazine |volume=26|issue=3| date=2007-01-10|page=19[/tpl] — and put Gibson's work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.[tpl]cite news |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030510/ai_n12684401 |title=Books: Hardbacks |accessdate=2007-07-08 |last=Hirst |first=Christopher |date=2003-05-10 |publisher=The Independent|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013205201/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030510/ai_n12684401 |archivedate = October 13, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] As well as the setting, the novels share some of the same characters, including Hubertus Bigend and Pamela Mainwaring, employees of the enigmatic marketing company Blue Ant.
A phenomenon peculiar to this era was the independent development of annotating fansites, PR-Otaku and Node Magazine, devoted to Pattern Recognition and Spook Country respectively. These websites tracked the references and story elements in the novels through online resources such as Google and Wikipedia and collated the results, essentially creating hypertext versions of the books.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.salon.com/books/int/2007/08/11/william_gibson/index.html |title=Now Romancer |accessdate=2007-10-30 |last=Lim |first=Dennis |date=2007-08-11 |publisher=Salon.com[/tpl] Critic John Sutherland characterised this phenomenon as threatening "to completely overhaul the way literary criticism is conducted".[tpl]cite news |first=John |last=Sutherland |authorlink=John Sutherland (author) |title=Node idea |url= http://books.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2159309,00.html |work=Guardian Unlimited |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2007-11-11 | location=London[/tpl]
After the September 11, 2001 attacks, with about 100 pages of Pattern Recognition written, Gibson had to re-write the main character's backstory, which had been suddenly rendered implausible; he called it "the strangest experience I've ever had with a piece of fiction."[tpl]cite news |first=Dennis |last=Lim |title=Think Different |url= http://www.villagevoice.com/books/0307,lim2,41824,10.html |work=The Village Voice |publisher= Village Voice Media |date= 2003-02-18 |accessdate=2007-11-11[/tpl] He saw the attacks as a nodal point in history, "an experience out of culture",[tpl]cite web |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/books/2003/02/13/gibson/index.html |title=Nodal point |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Leonard |first=Andrew |date=2003-02-13 |publisher=Salon.com[/tpl] and "in some ways... the true beginning of the 21st century."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/a-reality-stranger-than-fiction/2007/09/06/1188783376158.html |title=A reality stranger than fiction |accessdate=2008-01-21 |last=Bennie |first=Angela |date=2007-09-07 |work=Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media[/tpl] He is noted as one of the first novelists to use the attacks to inform his writing.

===Future Novels===

William Gibson is currently working on a novel entitled The Peripheral. He described the story briefly in an appearance he made at the New York Public Library on April 19, 2013 and also read an excerpt from the first chapter of the book entitled “The Gone Haptics.”[tpl]cite web|last=Fenlon |first=Wesley |url=http://www.tested.com/art/makers/455051-william-gibson-talks-sci-fi-and-his-next-novel-new-york-public-library/ |title=William Gibson Talks Sci-Fi and His Next Novel at New York Public Library |publisher=Tested |date=2013-04-24 |accessdate=2014-04-08[/tpl] The story takes place in two eras, one about thirty years into the future and the other further in the future.   There is no known completion or release date for this novel, but Gibson indicated he was about one-third of the way through the work on April 19, 2013.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://io9.com/watch-william-gibson-read-from-his-brand-new-science-fi-484885010 |title=Watch William Gibson read from his brand new science fiction novel |publisher=Io9.com |date=2013-04-29 |accessdate=2014-04-08[/tpl]

==Collaborations, adaptations, and miscellanea==

===Literary collaborations===

Three of the stories that later appeared in Burning Chrome were written in collaboration with other authors: "The Belonging Kind" (1981) with John Shirley, "Red Star, Winter Orbit" (1983) with Sterling,[tpl]cite news |first=Joel |last=Garreau |title=Through the Looking Glass |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/05/AR2007090502582_pf.html |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2007-10-30 [/tpl] and "Dogfight" (1985) with Michael Swanwick. Gibson had previously written the foreword to Shirley's 1980 novel City Come A-walkin[tpl]'[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.darkecho.com/JohnShirley/gibson.html |title=Foreword to City Come a-walkin[tpl]'[/tpl] |date=1996-03-31|accessdate=2007-05-01| first=William|last=Gibson[/tpl] and the pair's collaboration continued when Gibson wrote the introduction to Shirley's short story collection Heatseeker (1989).[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.locusmag.com/index/s296.html |title = Stories, Listed by Author |accessdate = 2007-10-29 |last = Brown |first = Charles N. |authorlink = Charles N.

Gibson and Sterling collaborated again on the short story "The Angel of Goliad" in 1990, which they soon expanded into the novel-length alternate history story The Difference Engine (1990). The two were later "invited to dream in public" (Gibson) in a joint address to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences Convocation on Technology and Education in 1993 ("the Al Gore people"), in which they argued against the digital divide[tpl]cite web |url = http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/William_Gibson/sterling_gibson_nas.speeches |title = Speeches by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling at the National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C. |accessdate = 2007-10-29 |last = Sterling |first = Bruce |authorlink = Bruce Sterling |coauthors = William Gibson |date =1993-05-10 |publisher = The WELL[/tpl] and "appalled everyone" by proposing that all schools be put online, with education taking place over the Internet. In a 2007 interview, Gibson revealed that Sterling had an idea for "a second recursive science novel that was just a wonderful idea", but that Gibson was unable to pursue the collaboration because he was not creatively free at the time.
In 1993, Gibson contributed lyrics and featured as a guest vocalist on Yellow Magic Orchestra's Technodon album,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/432896 |title=Yellow Magic Orchestra - Technodon |accessdate=2008-01-10 |work=Discogs [/tpl] and wrote lyrics to the track "Dog Star Girl" for Deborah Harry's Debravation.[tpl]cite news |first=Degen |last=Pener |title= EGOS & IDS; Deborah Harry Is Low-Key -- And Unblond |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DC1239F931A1575BC0A965958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/H/Harry,%20Debbie |publisher=The New York Times |date=1993-08-22 |accessdate=2007-11-07 [/tpl]

===Film adaptations, screenplays, and appearances===

Gibson was first solicited to work as a screenwriter after a film producer discovered a waterlogged copy of Neuromancer on a beach at a Thai resort.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Details |url=http://www.textfiles.com/sf/cyberlit.txt |title=Cyber Lit |date=June 1992 |first=Gavin |last=Edwards |issue=134 |accessdate=2008-09-29[/tpl] His early efforts to write film scripts failed to manifest themselves as finished product; "Burning Chrome" (which was to be directed by Kathryn Bigelow) and "Neuro-Hotel" were two attempts by the author at film adaptations that were never made.[tpl]cite interview |last=Gibson |first=William |title=William Gibson Interviewed by Giuseppe Salza|city=Cannes |year=1994 |month=May |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/235 |accessdate=2007-10-28[/tpl] In the late 1980s he wrote an early version of Alien 3 (which he later characterized as "Tarkovskian"), few elements of which survived in the final version.
Gibson's early involvement with the film industry extended far beyond the confines of the Hollywood blockbuster system. At one point, he collaborated on a script with Kazakh director Rashid Nugmanov after an American producer had expressed an interest in a Soviet-American collaboration to star Russian-Korean star Victor Tsoi. Despite being occupied with writing a novel, Gibson was reluctant to abandon the "wonderfully odd project" which involved "ritualistic gang-warfare in some sort of sideways-future Leningrad" and sent Jack Womack to Russia in his stead. Rather than producing a motion picture, a prospect that ended with Tsoi's death in a car crash, Womack's experiences in Russia ultimately culminated in his novel Let's Put the Future Behind Us and informed much of the Russian content of Gibson's Pattern Recognition. A similar fate befell Gibson's collaboration with Japanese filmmaker Sogo Ishii in 1991, a film they plotted on shooting in the Walled City of Kowloon until the city was demolished in 1993.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2006_07_01_archive.asp#115354123358489417 |title=Burst City Trailer |first=William |last=Gibson |date=2006-07-21 |accessdate=2007-11-26[/tpl]
Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have frequently been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both set in the Sprawl trilogy universe, have been loosely adapted as films: Johnny Mnemonic (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and Takeshi Kitano, and New Rose Hotel (1998), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. The former was the first time in history that a book was launched simultaneously as a film and a CD-ROM interactive video game.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mg.co.za/article/1996-09-03-blade-runner-on-electrosteroids |title=Blade Runner on electro-steroids |accessdate=2007-11-11 |last=Walker |first=Martin |date=1996-09-03 |work=Mail & Guardian Online |publisher= M&G Media[/tpl] Neuromancer, after a long stay in development hell, is in the process of adaptation [tpl]as of|2013|lc=on[/tpl],[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=39171 |title=Vincenzo Natali Still Hopeful For Neuromancer | date=2013-10-28 |accessdate=2014-02-25 |work=Empire | author=Williams, Owen[/tpl] Count Zero was at one point being developed as The Zen Differential with director Michael Mann attached, and the third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, Mona Lisa Overdrive, has also been optioned and bought.

Television is another arena in which Gibson has collaborated; he co-wrote with friend Tom Maddox, The X-Files episodes "Kill Switch" and "First Person Shooter", broadcast in the U.S. on 20th Century Fox Television in 1998 and 2000.[tpl]cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HDN/is_2000_Feb_24/ai_59615707 |title="X-Files" Writer Fights For Online Privacy |accessdate=2007-07-13 |last=Fridman |first=Sherman |date=2000-02-24 |work=News Briefs |publisher=Newsbytes PM |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040922035743/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HDN/is_2000_Feb_24/ai_59615707 |archivedate=2004-09-22 [/tpl] In 1998 he contributed the introduction to the spin-off publication Art of the X-Files. Gibson made a cameo appearance in the television miniseries Wild Palms at the behest of creator Bruce Wagner.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2006_07_01_archive.asp#115361118165031237 |title=Where The Holograms Go |first=William |last=Gibson |date=2006-07-22 |accessdate=2007-11-26[/tpl] Director Oliver Stone had borrowed heavily from Gibson's novels to make the series,[tpl]cite news |first=Adam |last=Platt |title=Cyberhero |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/08/16/1993_08_16_024_TNY_CARDS_000364256 |work=The Talk of the Town |publisher=The New Yorker |date=1993-09-16 |page=24 |accessdate=2007-11-06 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990223224043/http://multiweb.evolution.com/clients/mindvox/newyorker.html |archivedate=1999-02-23 [/tpl] and in the aftermath of its cancellation Gibson contributed an article, "Where The Holograms Go", to the Wild Palms Reader. He accepted another acting role in 2002, appearing alongside Douglas Coupland in the short film Mon Amour Mon Parapluie in which the pair played philosophers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://64.207.169.13/mamp/cast/cast.htm |title=Cast |accessdate=2007-10-26 |work=Mon Amour Mon Parapluie |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040621004844/http://64.207.169.13/mamp/cast/cast.htm |archivedate = June 21, 2004|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Appearances in fiction aside, Gibson was the focus of a biographical documentary by Mark Neale in 2000 called No Maps for These Territories. The film follows Gibson over the course of a drive across North America discussing various aspects of his life, literary career and cultural interpretations. It features interviews with Jack Womack and Bruce Sterling, as well as recitations from Neuromancer by Bono and The Edge.

===Exhibitions, poetry, and performance art===

Gibson has contributed text to be integrated into a number of performance art pieces. In October 1989, Gibson wrote text for such a collaboration with acclaimed sculptor and future Johnny Mnemonic director Robert Longo[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/gibson.html |title=Remembering Johnny |accessdate=2008-01-10 |last=van Bakel |first=Rogier |journal=Wired |date=June 1995 | issue=3.06[/tpl] titled Dream Jumbo: Working the Absolutes, which was displayed in Royce Hall, University of California Los Angeles. Three years later, Gibson contributed original text to "Memory Palace", a performance show featuring the theater group La Fura dels Baus at Art Futura '92, Barcelona, which featured images by Karl Sims, Rebecca Allen, Mark Pellington with music by Peter Gabriel and others. It was at Art Futura '92 that Gibson met Charlie Athanas, who would later act as dramaturg and "cyberprops" designer on Steve Pickering and Charley Sherman's adaptation of "Burning Chrome" for the Chicago stage. Gibson's latest contribution was in 1997, a collaboration with critically acclaimed Vancouver-based contemporary dance company Holy Body Tattoo and Gibson's friend and future webmaster Christopher Halcrow.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_05_01_archive.asp#200367789 |title=Holy Body Tattoo |last=Gibson |first=William |date=2003-05-31 |accessdate=2007-11-11[/tpl]
In 1990, Gibson contributed to "Visionary San Francisco", an exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art shown from June 14 to August 26.[tpl]cite book | last = Polledri | first = Paolo | title = Visionary San Francisco | publisher = Prestal | location = Munich | year = 1990 |oclc=22115872 | isbn = 3-7913-1060-7 [/tpl] He wrote a short story, "Skinner's Room", set in a decaying San Francisco in which the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge was closed and taken over by the homeless – a setting Gibson then detailed in the Bridge trilogy. The story inspired a contribution to the exhibition by architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts that envisioned a San Francisco in which the rich live in high-tech, solar-powered towers, above the decrepit city and its crumbling bridge. The architects exhibit featured Gibson on a monitor discussing the future and reading from "Skinner's Room".[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.skierpage.com/gibson/biblio.htm |title=William Gibson Bibliography / Mediagraphy |accessdate = 2008-02-09 |author = S. Page[/tpl] The New York Times hailed the exhibition as "one of the most ambitious, and admirable, efforts to address the realm of architecture and cities that any museum in the country has mounted in the last decade", despite calling Ming and Hodgetts's reaction to Gibson's contribution "a powerful, but sad and not a little cynical, work".[tpl]cite news |first=Paul |last=Goldberger |title=In San Francisco, A Good Idea Falls With a Thud |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DB103CF931A2575BC0A966958260 |publisher=The New York Times Company |work=The New York Times |date=1990-08-12 |accessdate=2007-11-06 [/tpl] A slightly different version of the short story was featured a year later in Omni.[tpl]cite journal |last=Gibson |first=William |date=November 1991 |title=Skinner's Room |journal=Omni [/tpl]

===Cryptography===

A particularly well-received work by Gibson was Agrippa (a book of the dead) (1992), a 300-line semi-autobiographical electronic poem that was his contribution to a collaborative project with artist Dennis Ashbaugh and publisher Kevin Begos, Jr. Gibson's text focused on the ethereal nature of memories (the title refers to a photo album) and was originally published on a 3.5" floppy disk embedded in the back of an artist's book containing etchings by Ashbaugh (intended to fade from view once the book was opened and exposed to light — they never did, however). Gibson commented that Ashbaugh's design "eventually included a supposedly self-devouring floppy-disk intended to display the text only once, then eat itself."[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/source/source.asp |title=Introduction to Agrippa: A Book of the Dead |last=Gibson |first=William |year=1992 |accessdate=2007-11-11[/tpl] Contrary to numerous colorful reports, the diskettes were never actually "hacked"; instead the poem was manually transcribed from a surreptitious videotape of a public showing in Manhattan in December 1992, and released on the MindVox bulletin board the next day; this is the text that circulated widely on the Internet.
Since its debut in 1992, the mystery of Agrippa remains hidden, even now 20 years later. Although many have tried to hack the unbreakable code and decrypt the program, the uncompiled source code was lost long ago. Alan Liu and his team at "The Agrippa Files" [tpl]cite web|url=http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/ |title=The Agrippa Files |publisher=Agrippa.english.ucsb.edu |accessdate=2014-04-08[/tpl] have created an extensive website with tools and resources to crack the Agrippa Code. They are collaborating with Matthew Kirschenbaum at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities and the Digital Forensics Lab, and Quinn DuPont, a PhD student of cryptography from the University of Toronto, has called for the aid of cryptographers to figure out how the program works by creating "Cracking the Agrippa Code: The Challenge",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crackingagrippa.net/ |title=Cracking the Agrippa Code |publisher=Crackingagrippa.net |date=1992-03-25 |accessdate=2014-04-08[/tpl] that enlists participants to solve the intentional scrambling of the poem in exchange for prizes.[tpl]cite web|author=Today in Tech |url=http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/technology-blog/researcher-seeks-solution-mystery-20-old-self-deleting-025854333.html |title=Researcher seeks solution to mystery of 20-year-old self-deleting poem | Technology News Blog - Yahoo!

===Essays and short-form nonfiction===

Gibson is a sporadic contributor of non-fiction articles to newspapers and journals. He has been a sporadic contributor of longer-form articles to Wired and of op-eds to The New York Times, and has written for The Observer, Addicted to Noise, New York Times Magazine, Rolling Stone, and Details Magazine. His first major piece of nonfiction, the article "Disneyland with the Death Penalty" concerning the city-state of Singapore, resulted in Wired being banned from the country and attracted a spirited critical response.[tpl]cite journal|title=Disneyland with the Death Penalty |url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.04/gibson.html |last=Gibson |first=William |issue=1.04 |date=September–October 1993 |work=Wired |accessdate=2008-09-23|publisher=Wired[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Multimedia Animal Wired Visionary Nicholas Negroponte is MIT's Loud Voice of the Future |date=March 1, 1995 |first=David |last=Mehegan |work=Boston Globe |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=2008-09-23[/tpl] He commenced writing a blog in January 2003, providing voyeuristic insights into his reaction to Pattern Recognition, but abated in September of the same year owing to concerns that it might negatively affect his creative process.[tpl]cite news |first=Andrew |last=Orlowski |title=William Gibson 'gives up blogging' |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/25/william_gibson_gives_up_blogging/ |work=Music and Media |publisher=The Register |date=2003-04-25 |accessdate=2007-11-03 [/tpl] Gibson re-commenced blogging in October 2004, and during the process of writing Spook Country – and to a lesser extent Zero History – frequently posted short nonsequential excerpts from the novel to the blog.[ref]

==Influence and recognition==

Hailed by Steven Poole of The Guardian in 1999 as "probably the most important novelist of the past two decades" in terms of influence,[tpl]cite news |first=Steven |last=Poole |title=Nearing the nodal |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/sciencefiction/0,6121,98588,00.html |work=Books by genre |publisher=The Guardian |date=1999-10-30 |accessdate=2007-11-03 | location=London[/tpl] Gibson first achieved critical recognition with his debut novel, Neuromancer. The novel won three major science fiction awards (the Nebula Award, the Philip K. Dick Award, and the Hugo Award), an unprecedented achievement described by the Mail & Guardian as "the sci-fi writer's version of winning the Goncourt, Booker and Pulitzer prizes in the same year". Neuromancer gained unprecedented critical and popular attention outside science fiction, as an "evocation of life in the late 1980s", although The Observer noted that "it took the New York Times 10 years" to mention the novel.
Gibson's work has received international attention from an audience that was not limited to science fiction aficionados as, in the words of Laura Miller, "readers found startlingly prophetic reflections of contemporary life in its fantastic and often outright paranoid scenarios."[tpl]cite book | last = Miller | first = Laura | title = The Salon.

===Cultural significance===

In his early short fiction, Gibson is credited by Rapatzikou in The Literary Encyclopedia with effectively "renovating" science fiction, a genre at that time considered widely "insignificant", influencing by means of the postmodern aesthetic of his writing the development of new perspectives in science fiction studies.[tpl]cite journal |last=Hollinger |first=Veronica |date=July 1999 |title=Contemporary Trends in Science Fiction Criticism, 1980–1999 |journal=Science Fiction Studies |volume=26 |issue=78 |url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/78/hollinger78art.htm |accessdate= 2007-11-06 [/tpl] In the words of filmmaker Marianne Trench, Gibson's visions "struck sparks in the real world" and "determined the way people thought and talked" to an extent unprecedented in science fiction literature.Trench, Marianne and Peter von Brandenburg, producers. 1992. Cyberpunk. Mystic Fire Video: Intercon Productions. The publication of Neuromancer (1984) hit a cultural nerve, causing Larry McCaffery to credit Gibson with virtually launching the cyberpunk movement, as "the one major writer who is original and gifted to make the whole movement seem original and gifted."[tpl]Ref_label|G|VII|none[/tpl] Aside from their central importance to cyberpunk and steampunk fiction, Gibson's fictional works have been hailed by space historian Dwayne A. Day as some of the best examples of space-based science fiction (or "solar sci-fi"), and "probably the only ones that rise above mere escapism to be truly thought-provoking".
Gibson's early novels were, according to The Observer, "seized upon by the emerging slacker and hacker generation as a kind of road map". 
Through his novels, such terms as cyberspace, netsurfing, ICE, jacking in, and neural implants entered popular usage, as did concepts such as net consciousness, virtual interaction and "the matrix".[tpl]cite journal |last=Doherty |first=Michael E., Jr. |date=September 1995 |title=Marshall McLuhan Meets William Gibson in "Cyberspace" |journal=CMC Magazine |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/cmc/mag/1995/sep/doherty.html |accessdate= 2007-10-28 |quote= |page=4 [/tpl] In "Burning Chrome" (1982), he coined the term cyberspace,[tpl]Ref_label|E|V|none[/tpl] referring to the "mass consensual hallucination" of computer networks. Through its use in Neuromancer, the term gained such recognition that it became the de facto term for the World Wide Web during the 1990s.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/technoculture/pomosf.html | title=Postmodern Science Fiction and Cyberpunk | first=Martin | last=Irvine | date=1997-01-12 | accessdate=2006-11-23|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061205024912/http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/technoculture/pomosf.html |archivedate = December 5, 2006|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Artist Dike Blair has commented that Gibson's "terse descriptive phrases capture the moods which surround technologies, rather than their engineering.""Liquid Science Fiction: Interview with William Gibson by Bernard Joisten and Ken Lum", Purple Prose, (Paris), N°9, été, pp.10–16

 He was inducted by Science Fiction Hall of Fame that same year, presented by his close friend and collaborator Jack Womack.

===Visionary influence and prescience===

In Neuromancer, Gibson first used the term "matrix" to refer to the visualised Internet, two years after the nascent Internet was formed in the early 1980s from the computer networks of the 1970s.[tpl]cite web|author=Postel, J., Network Working Group|date=November 1981|url=http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc801.txt|publisher=Information Sciences Institute of the University of Southern California|title=RFC 801 - NCP/TCP Transition Plan|accessdate=2007-10-31[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Zakon, Robert H|title=Hobbes' Internet Timeline v8.2|url=http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/|publisher=Zakon Group LLC|date=2006-11-01|accessdate=2007-10-31[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.netlingo.com/lookup.cfm?term=matrix |title=Matrix |accessdate=2007-09-09 |work=Netlingo [/tpl] Gibson thereby imagined a worldwide communications network years before the origin of the World Wide Web,[ref]
