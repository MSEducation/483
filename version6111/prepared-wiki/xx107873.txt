CATEGORIES: Streets in Las Vegas, Nevada

State Route 589 (SR 589) comprises a large portion of Sahara Avenue, a major eastâ€“west section line road in the Las Vegas Valley.  The road is named after the now-defunct Sahara Hotel and Casino which is located on Las Vegas Boulevard where it intersects with Sahara Avenue.  The Sahara closed in 2009.
