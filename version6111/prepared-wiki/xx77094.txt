Craig Anthony Washington (born October 12, 1941) is an American lawyer and Democratic Party politician from Texas who served in the Texas State Senate and the United States House of Representatives. 
The son of Roy and Azalia Washington, Washington graduated from Prairie View A&M University in 1966 and was originally interested in becoming a doctor, but as admissions to medical school had already ceased, Washington decided to instead apply at Texas Southern University's law school.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
In 1972, the state of Texas began electing members of the state House of Representatives and State Senate, for the first time, by single-member districts. Washington, along with four other minority candidates, Anthony Hall, George T. "Mickey" Leland, Benny Reyes and Cecil Bush, (dubbed the "People's Five"), ran for seats in the Texas House of Representatives. Washington was elected, and represented District 86 in the state House from 1973 to 1982. He then represented District 13 in the state senate from 1983 until 1989.
Washington was elected as a Democrat to the 101st United States Congress for Texas's 18th congressional district, by special election, December 9, 1989, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mickey Leland. He was reelected to the 102nd United States Congress and 103rd United States Congress and served from December 9, 1989, to January 3, 1995. He took stands against some projects, like the International Space Station, where spending would have flowed to his district.[tpl]cite news|work=Houston Press|title=What's Driving Miss Shelia?|author=Tim Fleck|date=20 February 1997|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/1997-02-20/news/what-s-driving-miss-shelia/Sheila/[/tpl]
In March, 1994, Washington was routed in the Democratic primary by Houston City Councilwoman Sheila Jackson Lee, winning only 36.5 percent of the vote.  Lee won in November and still holds the seat today.
Since leaving Congress, Washington has practiced law in Houston, Texas and Bastrop, Texas.
On New Year's Day 2008, Washington shot at a car containing two teenagers. After being indicted by a grand jury in 2009, he agreed to two years of probation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6537482.html|title=Washington avoids trial in shooting case|author=Brian Rogers|work=Houston Chronicle|date=July 20, 2009|accessdate=March 1, 2010[/tpl] However, Washington's attorney subsequently claimed that Washington fired because his life was in danger. Washington has since countersued the teenagers, alleging assault and property damage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2010/02/craig_washington_sues_victims.php|title=Former Congressman Craig Washington Sues The Two Teenagers He Shot At|author=Chris Vogel|date=February 26, 2010|accessdate=March 1, 2010|work=Houston Press[/tpl]
