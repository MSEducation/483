"'Movin' On" is a song written and recorded by English girl group Bananarama.  It was the first single released from the album Please Yourself in 1992.  This is the first single released by Bananarama as a duo, as Jacquie O'Sullivan had left the group the prior year.  It was produced by Mike Stock and Pete Waterman, two-thirds of the Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) trio who had produced a bulk of Bananarama's past hits.
"Movin' On" is a pop song with disco influences, as Stock and Waterman attempted to create an ABBA-like sound for the Please Yourself album.  The single met with mixed reviews and moderate success when released, peaking at number twenty-four in the UK singles chart.
The song was later covered by Steps on their second album Steptacular.
In 2012, the song was re-released by Bananarama on their Now or Never EP in a new version.

==Music video==

The music video begins with the girls performing from behind a wooden cut-out of the image that appears on the cover of the single. They emerge from behind it in red evening gowns and descend a staircase as scantily clad showboys with feathered fans perform around them. Several muscular men pose on podiums as live Grecian statues. 
As a nod to their trademark silliness, they can be seen tussling in the midst of their choreographed descent down the stairs.
At the end, the duo make a languid exit down the long runway of a stage, and then reappear from behind the wooden cut-outs, to the sound of applause.
