Britny Fox was an American glam metal band from the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area, initially active from 1985 to 1992 then subsequently reforming in 2000. They are best known for their music video for "Girlschool" and their hit "Long Way to Love" (U.S. No. 100).

==History==

Britny Fox formed in 1986 in Philadelphia. The band was originally fronted by lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist "Dizzy" Dean Davidson. The band also featured Billy Childs on bass, former Cinderella guitarist Michael Kelly Smith on lead guitar and former Cinderella drummer Tony Destra on drums. The idea for the band's name was inspired by Davidson, who named the band in honor of a Welsh ancestor. They were described on a compilation as "trashy Victorian glam". http://www.sleazeroxx.com/bands/britnyfox/britnyfox.shtml
Thanks to their connections to Cinderella, the band was able to secure a major recording contract. However, just as things were beginning to look bright for the band, they soon dimmed. Tony Destra was killed in a car accident. Facing a tour, the band recruited drummer, John DiTeodoro (Johnny Dee), who had been the drummer for the band Waysted.http://www.sleazeroxx.com/bands/britnyfox/britnyfox.shtml
The band released a demo in 1986 titled In America, which drummer Tony Destra played on, and a demo in 1987 titled Rock Is Gonna Fight, which drummer Adam West played on. The band's self-titled debut album, released in 1988, was one of the most successful premieres of the 1988–89 season, selling more than one million copies and bringing more than 625,000 fans to their 130+ shows.  They also won Metal Edge Magazine's 1988 Reader's Choice Award for Best New Band. After the release of the band's second album in 1989, Boys in Heat, Davidson departed, and formed the band Blackeyed Susan. He was replaced by Las Vegas native Tommy Paris aka Don Jillson formerly of the band Jillson.Interview with Tommy Paris on Sleazeroxx.com Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde and Poison drummer Rikki Rockett guested on the band's third album, Bite Down Hard, which was released in 1991. However, the popularity of glam metal was on a decline around the time of the album's release due to the rising popularity of the alternative rock/grunge movement.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] Britny Fox disbanded in 1992 for various reasons.
Michael Kelly Smith was previously in an early version of fellow Philadelphia band Cinderella until his dismissal, and later Tony Destra also played with them.
Drummer Adam West, formerly of Tangier, played for Britny Fox briefly between the time of Tony Destra and Johnny Dee.
Britny Fox reunited in 2000 with the same line-up before their disbandment, and released a fourth studio album, Springhead Motorshark, in 2003. The band toured the US and Europe in 2007 and 2008. Guitarist Tommy Krash and former White Lion drummer Greg D'Angelo was supposed to join at that time, but he broke his foot during rehearsal and was replaced with Henry Now.
As of 2007, Britny Fox reformed under original bassist Billy Childs. The other current and former members are lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Jamie Fletcher, lead guitarist Greg Polcari, and drummer Henry Now.
