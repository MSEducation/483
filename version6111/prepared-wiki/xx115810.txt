Robert David FitzGerald (or possibly Robert Desmond FitzGeraldR.D. Fitzgerald - biographical and botanical sources) (30 November 1830 – 12 August 1892) was an Irish-Australian surveyor, ornithologist, botanist and poet. His father, also Robert David FitzGerald, was a banker, and his mother was Mary Ann, née Bell.
Whilst working as a public servant FitzGerald's private passion and ability regarding ornithology and botany became so skillful that he communicated directly with Charles Darwin regarding Australian species of plant and was referred to several times in the book The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species of 1877.  He also collected orchids for the great German-Australian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller.
His extraordinary skills gave rise to a volume of work completed over seven years called Australian Orchids which J. D. Hooker another botanist, considered would be an honour to any country and to any Botanist.

==Biography==

===Early life===

FitzGerald was born in Tralee, Co. Kerry, Ireland. He studied civil engineering at Queen's College, Cork, (now known as University College Cork), and emigrated to Australia.

===Working as a surveyor===

FitzGerald arrived in Sydney, Australia in 1856 and a short time later was appointed to the Department of Lands as a draftsman for the crown.
Working steadily until 1868 FitzGerald was then promoted to control the roads branch of that department.
By 1873 he had become Deputy Surveyor General, and by 1874 he had been given responsibility as the Chief Mining Surveyor as well as controller of Church and School Lands for New South Wales. Following the advent of the Crown Lands Act of 1884 part of his duty was to analyse and consider the future roles of his department and ironically that analysis resulted in a number of retrenchments including his own.

===Ornithology and botany===

In his private life FitzGerald developed his skills as an ornithologist.  Coupled with his skills as a taxidermist he initially (during 1855-56) contributed a number of articles on the birds of his hometown Kerry to that town's magazine.
Mor specifically FitzGerald had an enormous interest in botany and in 1864 he travelled to Wallis Lake, north of Newcastle in New South Wales to collect ferns and orchids which he intended to cultivate around his Hunter's Hill home.
This interest in orchids was maintained throughout his life and in 1869, 1871 and 1876 he visited Lord Howe Island to collect further botanical samples.  It was during this time that he discovered Dracophyllum fitzgeraldii F. Muell, which was later to be named in his honour.

===Marriage and children===

FitzGerald married Emily Blackwell, daughter of Edward Hunt, M.L.C., at Balmain in 1860.  FitzGerald had three sons and three daughters who survived his death.
His grandson was the Australian poet R. D. Fitzgerald.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040193b.htm | title = FitzGerald, Robert David (1830 - 1892) | work = Australian Dictionary of Biography Vol. 4| pages= 178–179 |publisher = MUP |accessdate = 2008-10-19[/tpl]

==Published works==

===Australian Orchids===

From 1875 until 1882 in association with Arthur James Stopps who was a lithographer in the same public offices that he worked at, FitzGerald published seven parts of his work Australian Orchids
The exquisite lithograph plates detailing FitzGerald's dissections of orchids, were hand-coloured by artists following his samples and instructions.
Australian Orchids made FitzGerald famous in the botanical world and J. D. Hooker another botanist, considered the work one which would be an honour to any country and to any Botanist.

===Manuscript notes===

Manuscript notes on botanical species including watercolour sketches and diagrams with botanical annotations which were completed by hand by Fitzgerald between 1870 and 1890, and are held by National Library of Australia.
