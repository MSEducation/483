[[Crippleware]]

CATEGORIES: Dysphemisms, Product design

Crippleware has been defined in realms of both software and hardware. In software crippleware "vital features of the program such as printing or the ability to save files are disabled until the user purchases a registration key. While crippleware allows consumers to see the software before they buy, they are unable to test its complete functionality because of the disabled functions." Hardware crippleware "is a hardware device that has not been designed to its full capability. The functionality of the hardware device is limited to encourage consumers to pay for a more expensive upgraded version. Usually the hardware device considered to be crippleware can be upgraded to better or its full potential by way of a trivial change, such as removing a jumper. The manufacturer would most likely release the crippleware as a low-end or economy version of their product."http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/crippleware.html
In hackers' jargon, an antifeature "is functionality that a technology developer will charge users to not include", for example copy-protection, and "Like blackmail, users can sometimes pay technology providers to not include an antifeature in their technology."http://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2007/fall/antifeatures/[/ref]

==Computer software==

Deliberately limited programs are usually freeware versions of computer programs that lack the most advanced (or even crucial) features of the original program. Limited versions are made available in order to increase the popularity of the full program without giving it away free. An example is a word processor that cannot save or print. However, crippleware programs can also differentiate between tiers of paying software customers.
The term "crippleware" is sometimes used to describe software products whose functions have been limited (or "crippled") with the sole purpose of encouraging or requiring the user to pay for those functions (either by paying a one-time fee or an on-going subscription fee).[tpl]cite web | url= http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci862925,00.html | title=Crippleware — a definition from Whatis.com[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url= http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/crippleware.html | title=Crippleware — a word definition from Webopedia[/tpl]
The less derogatory term, from a shareware software producer's perspective, is feature-limited. Feature-limited is merely one mechanism for marketing shareware as a damaged good; others are time-limited, usage-limited, capacity-limited, nagware and output-limited.[tpl]cite web|last=Brice|first=Andy|title=What type of free trial should I offer for my software?|url=http://successfulsoftware.net/tag/feature-limited/|accessdate=28 February 2012[/tpl] From the producer's standpoint, feature-limited allows customers to try software with no commitment instead of relying on questionable reviews and possibly staged reviews. Try-before-you-buy applications are very prevalent for mobile devices, with the additional damaged good of ad-displays as well as all of the other forms of damaged-good applications.[tpl]cite web|last=Kim|first=Eddie|title=The Best Book On Marketing Your Android App|url=http://www.marketandroidapps.com/development-2/free-paid-app-versions/|accessdate=28 February 2012[/tpl]
From an Open Source software providers perspective, there is the model of open core which includes a feature-limited version of the product and an open core version. The feature-limited version can be used widely like MySQL, Eucalyptus.
Several types of deliberately limited programs exist. The vendor includes a clause that features time limits to mar functionality. For example, the freeware version of Fraps has in-game video recording time restricted to 30 seconds, and with a Fraps logo on the video.[tpl]cite web | title= FRAPS show FPS, record video games |  url=http://www.fraps.com/buy.php | accessdate= 18 September 2012[/tpl]

==Computer hardware==

This product differentiation strategy has also been used in hardware products:

==Digital rights management==

Digital rights management is another example of this product differentiation strategy.[tpl]cite web|title=Privacy, Economics, and Price Discrimination on the Internet|url=https://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/privacy.economics.pdf|author=Andrew M. Odlyzko|date=July 27, 2003|accessdate=2010-02-15[/tpl] Digital files are inherently capable of being copied perfectly in unlimited quantities; digital rights management aims to remove the (from the producer's viewpoint) excess utility to the user from this capability by using hardware or cryptographic techniques to limit copying or playback.
