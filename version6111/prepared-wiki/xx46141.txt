Huy ([tpl]IPA-fr|ɥi|pron[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-nl|Hoei[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-wa|Hu[/tpl]) is a municipality of Belgium. It lies in the country's Walloon Region and Province of Liege.  Huy lies along the river Meuse, at the mouth of the small river Hoyoux. It is in the sillon industriel, the former industrial backbone of Wallonia, home to about two-thirds of the Walloon population. The Huy municipality includes the old communes of Ben-Ahin and Tihange.

==History==

The first village originated around the Roman castrum, an early fortress located on the right bank of the River Meuse.  The village was evangelized by Saint Domitian, Bishop of Tongeren in the 6th century and the town is mentioned for the first time in a 7th-century testament.
In the early Middle Ages, Huy was one of the most prosperous cities on the Meuse, with a flourishing economy based mostly on metallurgy, but also on tanning, sculpting, woodworking, and wine-making.  In the 10th century, Huy was promoted to county status, but soon became part of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, with which it would share its history for more than eight centuries.  Huy was the recipient of the first historically known charter north of the Alps, confirming it as a city in 1066.  It is around that time that Peter the Hermit harangued the locals and persuaded them to participate in the First Crusade.
In the 13th and 14th centuries, the economy boomed thanks to the cloth industry.  The castle on a hill right in the middle of town, was used in times of war and strengthened accordingly.  By the 15th century, it had become the symbol of the city.  The following two centuries, however, witnessed a gradual decline in the city’s fortunes, due in large part to the strategic value of its location on the Meuse. In the latter part of the 17th century, Louis XIV’s wars caused the city to be repeatedly attacked and put to the sword, to the point that the frustrated inhabitants dismantled their own castle, source of their miseries, in 1715.
A new fortress was built by the Dutch in 1818 at the same strategic location above the town. The 19th century was a period of relative prosperity based on the paper and other industries. The decline of heavy industry in the 20th century was felt here, as in other parts of Wallonia.  Today, the city has started to prosper again, thanks in part to its tin products and tourist activity.
