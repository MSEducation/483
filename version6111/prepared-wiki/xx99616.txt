It bordered Region 1 (Diepsloot), Region 2 (Midrand), Region 7 (Alexandra), Region 8 (Johannesburg Central), Region 4 (Northcliff), and Region 5 (Roodepoort). The region was abolished with a reorganisation of regions in 2006.City of Johannesburg.The seven regions. Accessed 20 February 2008.
The area is fairly heavily populated with the large urban centre of Sandton located in the region, however there are also many parks with large biodiversity.  This area is close to Johannesburg's central business district. It is infamous for its heavy traffic, however in preparation for the World Summit on Sustainable Development the government spent considerable sums of money investing in upgrades to the transportation network.
This economic activity in this area centres around business, and there is a lot of housing in this area.
