MagicVortex is an Internet-based file transfer service. It is a hosted solution intended to simulate a person-to-person transmission of any type of file up to 2 GB in size, depending on the subscription level. Files can be sent either by an Internet browser or by a downloadable application for Microsoft Windows. Notifications are sent via email, but all data transmission is protected using SSL encryption.
The MagicVortex service was launched November 2001 and was developed and is operated by Sage Analytic Technologies LLC, based in New Jersey, USA. As of 2008, MagicVortex has been used to send over 600,000 files and has over 10,000 registered users.
The strengths of the service are thought to be security and reliability, while transmission speed lags other alternatives.
The file transfer capabilities can be integrated into other systems using an API based on HTTP. A developer's guide is available to aid in integration.
