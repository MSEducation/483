[[Image:Raunkiaer1907-life forms-small.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Raunkiær's life forms (the plant structures that survive the unfavourable season are shown in black): 
1. Phanerophyte. 
2-3. Chamaephytes.  
4. Hemicryptophyte.  
5-9. Cryptophytes. 
The subdivisions of the Raunkiær system are based on the place of the plant's growth-point (bud) during seasons with adverse conditions (cold seasons and dry seasons):

===Phanerophytes===

Projecting into the air on stems – normally woody perennials - with resting buds more than 25 cms above soil level, e.g. trees and shrubs, but also epiphytes, which Raunkiær separated out as a special group in later versions of the system.

====Further subgrouping====

May be further subdivided according to plant height in megaphanerophytes, mesophanerophytes and nanophanerophytes and other characters, such as duration of leaves (evergreen or deciduous), presence of covering bracts on buds, succulence and epiphytism.

===Chamaephytes===

Buds on persistent shoots near the ground – woody plants with perennating buds borne close to the ground, no more than 25 cm above the soil surface, (e.g. bilberry and periwinkle).

===Hemicryptophytes===

Buds at or near the soil surface, e.g. daisy, dandelion.

===Cryptophytes===

Below ground or under water - with resting buds lying either beneath the surface of the ground as a rhizome, bulb, corm, etc., or a resting bud submerged under water. Cryptophytes are divided into 3 groups:

===Therophytes===

Annual plants which complete their life-cycle rapidly under favorable conditions and survive the unfavorable cold or dry season in the form of seed. Many desert plants are by necessity therophytes.

===Aerophytes===

New addition to the Raunkiaer lifeform classification. Plant that obtains moisture (though not through haustoria) and nutrients from the air and rain; usually grows on other plants but not parasitic on them.Galán de Mera, A., M. A. Hagen & J. A. Vicente Orellana (1999) Aerophyte, a New Life Form in Raunkiaer's Classification? Journal of Vegetation Science 10 (1): 65-68 This includes some Tillandsia species, as well as staghorn ferns.

===Epiphytes===

Originally placed in Phanerophytes (above) but then separated because of irrelevance of soil position.
