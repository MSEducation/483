[[Discus (fish)]]

CATEGORIES: Heroini

Symphysodon, colloquially known as discus, is a genus of cichlids native to the Amazon River basin.  Due to their distinctive shape and bright colors, discus are popular as freshwater aquarium fish, and their aquaculture in several countries in Asia is a major industry.[tpl]cite book |last=Loiselle |first=Paul V. |coauthors= |title=The Cichlid Aquarium |year=1995 |publisher=Tetra Press |location=Germany |isbn=1-56465-146-0[/tpl]Sands D  (1994) A fishkeepers guide to Central American cichlids.

==Species==

There are currently three recognized species in this genus:[tpl]FishBase genus | genus = Symphysodon| month = April | year = 2013[/tpl]

==Taxonomy==

Discus are fish from the genus Symphysodon, which currently includes the above species.[tpl]cite web |title= New Discus named Symphysodon tarzoo|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090307162702/http://www.practicalfishkeeping.co.uk/pfk/pages/item.php?news=1145 |date= 2006-11-28|work=Matt Clarke |publisher=practical fishkeeping |accessdate=15 August 2009[/tpl] However, another review of the genus published in August 2007 suggested that the genus held these three species: S. aequifasciatus (the green discus), S. haraldi (the blue/brown/common discus), and S. discus (the Heckel discus).[tpl]cite web |title= Discus genus revised|url= http://www.practicalfishkeeping.co.uk/content.php?sid=1293|date= 2007-08-08|work=Matt Clarke |publisher=Practical Fishkeeping |accessdate=15 August 2009[/tpl]  Further arguments have been made that S. tarzoo was not described in accordance with ICZN rules and thus should be considered invalid and replaced with S. haraldi,Geerts, M. (2011):  On the name Symphysodon Discus Tarzoo.  The Cichlid Room Companion currently considered a synonym of S. aequifasciatus by FishBase.
Other (sub)species have been proposed, but morphometric data (unlike in Pterophyllum, the freshwater angelfish) varies as much between individuals from one location as across the whole range of all discus fish species. S. tarzoo was described in 1959 and applies to the red-spotted western population. S. aequifasciatus and S. discus, meanwhile, seem to hybridise frequently in the wild or have diverged recently, as they lack mitochondrial DNA lineage sorting but differ in color pattern and have dissimilar chromosomal translocation patterns. S. discus occurs mainly in the Rio Negro. Whether S. haraldi is indeed distinct from S. aequifasciatus remains to be determined; if valid it is widespread but it might just be a color morph.

==Location and habitat==

Symphysodon species inhabit the margins of floodplain lakes and rivers in the Amazon Basin of lowland Amazonia,Crampton (2008) | Crampton William G. R.. Ecology and life history of an Amazon floodplain cichlid: the discus fish Symphysodon (Perciformes: Cichlidae). Neotrop. ichthyol.  on the Internet. 2008  Dec 2011  Aug  31 ;  6(4): 599-612. Available from: http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1679-62252008000400008&lng=en.  http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1679-62252008000400007 where it is part of the highly diverse Neotropical fish fauna.   
The three species of Symphysodon have different geographic distributions. S. aequifasciatus occurs in the  Rio Solimões, Rio Amazonas and the Río Putumayo-Içá in Brazil, Colombia and Peru. In contrast the distribution of S. discus appears to be limited to the lower reaches of the Abacaxis, Rio Negro and Trombetas rivers. S. tarzoo occurs upstream of Manaus in the western Amazon.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]

==Appearance==

Like cichlids from the genus Pterophyllum, all Symphysodon species have a laterally compressed body shape. In contrast to Pterophyllum, however, extended finnage is absent giving Symphysodon a more rounded shape. It is this body shape from which their common name, "discus", is derived. The sides of the fish are frequently patterned in shades of green, red, brown, and blue. The height and length of the grown fish are both about 20–25 cm (8–10 in).[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]

==Reproduction and sexual dimorphism==

There is no real sexual dimorphism for this fish. In breeding form varieties, solid red discus (red melon, red cover) females are generally more red then males.
Another characteristic of Symphysodon species is their care for the larvae. As for most cichlids, brood care is highly developed with both the parents caring for the young. Additionally, adult discus produce a secretion through their skin, which the larvae live off during their first few days. This behaviour has also been observed for Uaru species. However when bred in captivity the larvae will tend to live off their parents secretion for up to 2 weeks.Buckley, J., Maunder, R. J., Foey, A., Pearce, J., Val, A. L. and Sloman, K. A. (2010).
