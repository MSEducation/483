==Overview==

Each 60-minute episode profiles one or two interventions. During most of the first season, the hoarder worked with either a psychiatrist/psychologist, a professional organizer, or an "extreme cleaning specialist"; each of whom specialized in some aspect involving the treatment of obsessive/compulsive disorders, anxiety disorders, and/or hoarding. A crew of professional cleaners (usually a local franchise of the series' major corporate sponsor) performed actual cleanups. Two episodes in the first season featured a cleanup with both a psychologist and an organizer: Jill (episode "Jennifer and Ron/Jill") and Patty (episode "Patty/Bill"). The final episode of the first season, "Paul; Missy and Alex", featured professional organizer, Geralin Thomas, CPO-CD working with Missy, while a child psychologist, Dr. David Dia, worked with Missy's seven-year-old son Alex. Beginning in the second season, each hoarder had a psychologist-plus-organizer/cleaning-specialist team assisting them in their clean-out. The psychologist-plus-organizer/cleaning-specialist combination leads a group of cleaning professionals, family, friends, and relatives of the hoarder in conducting a two to three-day decluttering session. The cleanups aim both to teach the hoarding person new ways of thinking and patterns of behavior, and to make the home a livable and usable space.  In most instances a crisis — such as the threat of eviction or the removal of minor children from the home — prompts the intervention.
At the end of each episode, on-screen text indicates the short-term outcome of the cleanup effort, including the subjects' decisions on whether to seek further assistance from organizers or therapists. The show provides six months of aftercare funds to pay these professionals and, occasionally, to carry out vital repairs to the home.[tpl]cite web|title=Aftercare — Home cleaning|url=http://community.aetv.com/service/displayDiscussionThreads.kickAction?w=265899&as=119137&d=598224 |quote=This is Cory Chalmers from Hoarders and as part of my business, we offer regularly scheduled cleaning for every hoarding case we help with. |work=A&E Community|accessdate=27 February 2012[/tpl]
