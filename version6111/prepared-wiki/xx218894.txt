==History==

A.C. Milan was founded as Milan Cricket and Foot-Ball Club on 16 December 1899 by English expatriates Alfred Edwards and Herbert Kilpin, who came from the English city of Nottingham. In honour of its English origins, the club has retained the English spelling of the city's name, as opposed to the Italian spelling Milano which it was forced to bear under the fascist regime. Milan won its first Italian championship in 1901 and a further two in succession in 1906 and 1907.
In 1908, Milan experienced a split caused by internal disagreements over the signing of foreign players, which led to the forming of another Milan-based team, F.C. Internazionale Milano.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.inter.it/en/societa/storia.html |title=Inter – History |publisher=F.C. Internazionale Milano |accessdate=11 January 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100130141713/http://www.inter.it/en/societa/storia.html| archivedate= 30 January 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Following these events, Milan did not manage to win a single domestic title until 1950–51. The 1950s saw the club return to the top of Italian football, headed by the famous Gre-No-Li Swedish trio Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm. This was one of the club's most successful periods domestically, with the Scudetto going to Milan in 1951, 1955, 1957, 1959 and 1962. In 1963, Milan won its first continental title by beating S.L. Benfica in the final of the European Cup.[tpl]cite web |title=Champions League 1962/63 |url=http://www.acmilan.com/en/club/palmares/cdc1962_63 |work=acmilan.com |publisher=Associazione Calcio Milan |accessdate=4 October 2010[/tpl] This success was repeated in 1969, with a 4–1 win over AFC Ajax in the final, which was followed by the Intercontinental Cup title the same year. During this period Milan also won its first Coppa Italia, with victory over Padova in the 1967 final, and three European Cup Winners' Cups; in 1967–68, 1972–73 and 1973–74.
Milan won a tenth league title in 1979, but after the retirement of Gianni Rivera in the same year, the team went into a period of decline. The club was involved in the 1980 Totonero scandal and as punishment was relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history.[tpl]cite news |title=The worst scandal of them all |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/5215260.stm |author=Dan Warren |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=25 July 2006 |accessdate=4 October 2010[/tpl] The scandal was centered around a betting syndicate paying players and officials to fix the outcome of matches. Milan achieved promotion back to Serie A at the first attempt, winning the 1980–81 Serie B title,  but were again relegated a year later as the team ended its 1981–82 campaign in third last place. In 1983, Milan won the Serie B title for the second time in three seasons to return to Serie A,  where they achieved a sixth place finish in 1983–84.
On 20 February 1986, entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi acquired the club and saved it from bankruptcy investing vast amounts of money, appointing rising manager Arrigo Sacchi at the helm of the Rossoneri and signing the Dutch trio of Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard. Under Sacchi, Milan won its first Scudetto in nine years in the 1987–88 season. The following year the club won its first European Cup in two decades, beating Romanian club Steaua București 4–0 in the final. Milan retained their title with a 1–0 win over Benfica a year later and remain the last team to win back-to-back European Cups.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2013/may/24/great-european-cup-teams-milan|title=The great European Cup teams: Milan 1989–90|date=24 May 2013|accessdate=7 June 2013|work=The Guardian[/tpl] The Milan team of 1989–90 has been voted the best club side of all time, in a global poll of experts conducted by World Soccer magazine.[tpl]cite news|title=Brazil's 1970 winning team voted best of all time|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/07/09/uk-soccer-world-best-idUKL0988846220070709|accessdate=30 September 2011|newspaper=Reuters|date=9 July 2007[/tpl]
After Sacchi left Milan in 1991, he was replaced by the club's former player Fabio Capello whose team won three consecutive Serie A titles between 1992 and 1994, a spell which included a 58 match unbeaten run in Serie A[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.acmilan.com/en/archive/show_player/Fabio-Capello|title=Fabio Capello|accessdate=7 June 2013|work=A.C. Milan[/tpl] and back-to-back UEFA Champions League final appearances in 1993 and 1994. A year after losing 1–0 to Olympique de Marseille in the 1993 Champions League final, the team reached its peak in one of Milan's most memorable matches of all time, the famous 4–0 win over Barcelona in the 1994 Champions League final. Capello's team went on to win the 1995–96 league title before he left to coach Real Madrid in 1996. In 1998–99, after a two-year period of decline, Milan lifted its 16th championship in the club's centenary season.
Milan's next period of success came under another former player, Carlo Ancelotti. After his appointment in November 2001, Ancelotti took Milan to the 2003 Champions League final, where they defeated Juventus on penalties to win the club's sixth European Cup.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/01/22/teams-of-the-decade-14-milan-2002-07/|title=Teams of the Decade #14: Milan 2002–07|date=22 January 2010|accessdate=7 June 2013|work=Zonal Marking[/tpl] The team then won the Scudetto in 2003–04, before reaching the 2005 Champions League final, where they were beaten by Liverpool on penalties despite leading 3–0 at half time. Two years later, the two teams met again in the 2007 Champions League final with Milan winning 2–1 to lift the title for a seventh time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/season=2006/index.html|title=2006/07: Milan avenge Liverpool defeat|publisher=UEFA|accessdate=23 March 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100419231125/http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/season=2006/index.html| archivedate= 19 April 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The team then won its first FIFA Club World Cup in December 2007.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.acmilan.com/en/archive/show_player/Carlo-Ancelotti|title=Carlo Ancelotti|accessdate=7 June 2013|work=A.C. Milan[/tpl] In 2009, after becoming Milan's second longest serving coach, with 420 matches overseen, Ancelotti left the club to take over as head-coach at Chelsea.
During this period, the club was involved in the Calciopoli scandal, where five teams were accused of fixing matches by selecting favorable referees.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/jul14m.html | title=Calciopoli: The sentences in full | publisher=Channel 4| date=14 July 2006|accessdate=30 July 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070717103740/http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/jul14m.html  |archivedate = 17 July 2007[/tpl] A police inquiry excluded any involvement of Milan managers,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/03/sports/03iht-soccer.3017559.html |title=Soccer: Odor of corruption from root of game – Sports – International Herald Tribune |first=Rob |last=Hughes |work=International Herald Tribune |publisher=New York Times |date=3 October 2006 |accessdate=16 May 2011 |location=London[/tpl] but FIGC unilaterally decided that it had sufficient evidence to charge Milan vice-president, Adriano Galliani. As a result, Milan was initially punished with a 15-point deduction and was initially banned from the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League. An appeal saw that penalty reduced to eight points,[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/5215178.stm | title=Punishments cut for Italian clubs | publisher=BBC Sport| date=25 July 2006| accessdate=30 July 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060726003128/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/5215178.stm| archivedate= 26 July 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl] which allowed the club to retain its Champions League participation.
Following the aftermath of Calciopoli, local rivals Internazionale dominated Serie A, winning four Scudetti. However, with the help a strong squad boasting players such as Zlatan Ibrahimović, Robinho and Alexandre Pato joining many of the veterans of the club's mid-decade European successes, Milan recaptured the Scudetto in the 2010–11 Serie A season, their first since the 2003–04 season, and 18th overall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/10/italy/2011/05/07/2460683/ac-milan-win-2010-11-serie-a-title |title=AC Milan win 2010–11 Serie A title |publisher=Goal.com |date=7 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2011/05/08/2459024/how-ac-milan-won-the-serie-a-title |title=How AC Milan won the Serie A title |publisher=Goal.com |date=8 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-28[/tpl]

==Colours and badge==

Red and black are the colours which have represented the club throughout its entire history. They were chosen to represent the players' fiery ardor (red) and the opponents' fear to challenge the team (black). Rossoneri, the team's widely used nickname, literally means "the red & blacks" in Italian, in reference to the colours of the stripes on its jersey.[tpl]cite news|url=http://pt.uefa.com/printoutfiles/competitions/supercup/2007/e/e_300912_pr.pdf|publisher=UEFA.com|title=AC Milan – Sevilla FC|date=25 July 2007|format=PDF[/tpl]
Another nickname derived from the club's colours is the Devil. An image of a red devil was used as Milan's logo at one point with a Golden Star for Sport Excellence located next to it. As is customary in Italian football, the star above the logo was awarded to the club after winning 10 league titles, in 1979. For many years, Milan's badge was simply the Flag of Milan, which was originally the flag of Saint Ambrose.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.weltfussballarchiv.com/Vereinsprofilnew.php?ID=3002|publisher=WeltFussballArchiv.com|title=AC Milan|date=25 July 2007[/tpl] The modern badge used today represents the club colours and the flag of the Comune di Milano, with the acronym ACM at the top and the foundation year (1899) at the bottom.
White shorts and black socks are usually worn as part of the home strip. Milan's away strip has always been completely white.ADIDAS AND AC MILAN PRESENT 2013–14 AWAY JERSEY | News | AC Milan It is considered by both the fans and the club to be a lucky strip in Champions League finals, due to the fact that Milan has won six finals out of eight in an all white strip (losing only to Ajax in 1995 and Liverpool in 2005), and only won one out of three in the home strip. The third strip, which is rarely used, changes yearly, being mostly black with red trimmings in recent seasons.

==Stadium==

The team's stadium is the 80,018 seat San Siro, officially known as Stadio Giuseppe Meazza after the former player who represented both Milan and Internazionale. The more commonly used name, San Siro, is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro has been the home of Milan since 1926, when it was privately built by funding from Milan's president at the time, Piero Pirelli. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took 13 and a half months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city council in 1935, and since 1947 has been shared with Internazionale, when the other major Milanese club was accepted as joint tenant.
The first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Milan lost 6–3 in a friendly match against Internazionale. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1–2 to Sampierdarenese. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations, most recently in preparation for the 1990 FIFA World Cup when its capacity was set to 85,700, all covered with a polycarbonate roof. In the summer of 2008 its capacity has been reduced to 80,018, in order to meet the new standards set by UEFA.
Based on the English model for stadiums, San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy for its fantastic atmosphere during matches, thanks to the closeness of the stands to the pitch. The frequent use of flares by supporters contributes to the atmosphere but the practice has occasionally caused problems.
On 19 December 2005, Milan vice-president and executive director Adriano Galliani announced that the club is seriously working towards a relocation. He said that Milan's new stadium will be largely based on the Veltins-Arena and will follow the standards of football stadiums in the United States, Germany and Spain. As opposed to many other stadiums in Italy, Milan's new stadium will likely be used for football only, having no athletics track. The new stadium's naming rights will be probably sold to a sponsor, similarly to Arsenal's Emirates Stadium.[tpl]cite news|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200510/07/eng20051007_212984.html|publisher=People's Daily Online|title=AC Milan considering move to new stadium|date=25 July 2007[/tpl] It remains to be seen if this plan will proceed or if this is just a ploy to force the owners (Comune di Milano) to sell the stadium to Milan for a nominal fee so as to proceed with extensive renovations. The possibility of Internazionale vacating San Siro may affect proceedings.

==Supporters and rivalries==

Milan is one of the best supported football clubs in Italy, according to research conducted by Italian newspaper La Repubblica.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/08/sezioni/sport/calcio/tifo-contro/tifo-contro/tifo-contro.html|publisher=La Repubblica official website|title=Research: Supporters of football clubs in Italy|date=August 2007|language=Italian[/tpl] Historically, Milan was supported by the city's working-class and trade unionists. On the other hand, crosstown rivals Internazionale were mainly supported by the more prosperous and typically Milanese middle-class.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.footballderbies.com/honours/index.php?id=30|publisher=FootballDerbies.com|title=AC Milan vs. Inter Milan|date=25 July 2007[/tpl]
One of the oldest ultras groups in all of Italian football, Fossa dei Leoni, originated in Milan.  Currently, the main ultras group within the support base is Brigate Rossonere. Politically, Milan ultras have never had any particular preference, but the media traditionally associated them with the left-wing,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sportspundit.com/team/37/|publisher=SportsPundit.com|title=AC Milan|date=25 July 2007[/tpl] until recently, when Berlusconi's presidency somewhat altered that view.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.extra-football.com/teams/ac-milan.html|publisher=Extra-Football.com|title=AC Milan|date=25 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=April 2010[/tpl]
According to a study from 2010, Milan is the most supported Italian team in Europe and seventh overall, with over 18.4 million fans. AC Milan had the ninth highest average attendance of European football clubs during the 2010–11 season, behind Borussia Dortmund, FC Barcelona, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Schalke, Arsenal, and Hamburg.[tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance/_/league/ger.1/year/2010/german-bundesliga?cc=5901 |title=German Bundesliga Stats: Team Attendance – 2010–11 |publisher=ESPNsoccernet [/tpl]Camp Nou: Average attendance 79,390 | FCBarcelona.cat[tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance/_/league/eng.1/year/2010/barclays-premier-league?cc=5901 |title= Barclays Premier League Stats: Team Attendance – 2010–11 |publisher=ESPNsoccernet [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance/_/league/ESP.1/year/2010/spanish-primera-division?cc=5901 |title=Spanish La Liga Stats: Team Attendance – 2010–11 |publisher=ESPNsoccernet [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance/_/league/ita.1/year/2010/italian-serie-a?cc=5901 |title=Italian Serie A Stats: Team Attendance – 2010–11 |publisher=ESPNsoccernet [/tpl]
Genoa fans consider Milan a hated rival after Genoa fan, Vincenzo Spagnolo was stabbed to death by a Milan supporter in January 1995. However, Milan's main rivalry is with neighbor club, Internazionale; both clubs meet in the widely anticipated Derby della Madonnina twice every Serie A season. The name of the derby refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary, whose statue atop the Milan Cathedral is one of the city's main attractions. The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the start of the game. Flares are commonly present and contribute to the spectacle but they have occasionally led to problems, including the abandonment of the second leg of the 2004–05 Champions League quarterfinal match between Milan and Inter on 12 April 2005, after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan keeper Dida on the shoulder.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4432047.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Milan game ended by crowd trouble|date=25 July 2007[/tpl]

He went on to become Milan's all time top goalscorer, scoring 221 goals for the club in 268 games.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/milan.html|publisher=Channel4.com|title=AC Milan|date=25 July 2007[/tpl] He is followed in second place by Andriy Shevchenko with 175 goals in 322 games, and Gianni Rivera in third place, who has scored 164 goals in 658 games. Rivera is also Milan's youngest ever goalscorer, scoring in a league match against Juventus at just 17 years.
Legendary tactician Nereo Rocco, the first proponent of catenaccio in the country, was Milan's longest serving head coach, sitting on the bench for over 9 years (in two spells) in the 1960s and early 1970s, winning the club's first European Cup triumphs. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who purchased the club in 1986, is Milan's longest serving president (23 years, due to a two-year vacancy between 2004 and 2006).
The first official match in which Milan participated was in the Third Federal Football Championship, the predecessor of Serie A, losing 3–0 to Torinese. Milan's biggest ever victory was 13–0 versus Audax Modena, in a league match at the 1914–15 season. Its heaviest defeat was recorded in the league at the 1922–23 season, beaten 0–8 by Bologna.
During the 1991–92 season, the club achieved the feature of being the first team to win the Serie A title without losing a single game. Previously, only Perugia had managed to go unbeaten over an entire Serie A season (1978–79), but finished second in the table. In total, Milan's unbeaten streak lasted 58 games, starting with a 0–0 draw against Parma on 26 May 1991 and coincidentally ending with a 1–0 home loss to Parma on 21 March 1993. This is a Serie A record as well as the third longest unbeaten run in top flight European football, coming in behind Steaua Bucureşti's record of 104 unbeaten games and Celtic's 68 game unbeaten run.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/olympia/wagner/321/historiami.htm|publisher=Milanista Olympia|title=Milano History and Records|date=25 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Piers|last=Edwards|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/4391088.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Unbeaten half-century for Ahly|date=25 July 2007|accessdate=13 November 2010[/tpl]
