Ixnay on the Hombre is the fourth studio album by the American punk rock band The Offspring. Produced by Dave Jerden, the album was released on February 4, 1997 through Columbia Records (their former label Epitaph released it in Europe). After the massive commercial success of their previous album, Smash, The Offspring entered the studio in the middle of 1996 to record a new album. Asked about the title, frontman Dexter Holland claimed that Ixnay on the Hombre means either "fuck authority" or "fuck The Man".[tpl]Wayback |date=20070216131503 |url=http://members.aol.com/delirium4u/offspring/ixnay.htm |title=Ixnay on the Hombre[/tpl] ("Ixnay" is the Pig Latin version of the word "nix", familiar in 1940s Hollywood movies.)
Ixnay on the Hombre was a moderate success debuting at No. 9 on the Billboard 200 chart and it was well received by both critics and fans. The album was certified platinum in the US. The album contains the singles "All I Want", "Gone Away", "The Meaning of Life" and "I Choose", while "Cool to Hate" also received radio airplay. The first two singles later appeared on The Offspring's Greatest Hits album.

==Background and recording==

By the time The Offspring began writing new material for their fourth studio album in 1995-1996, they were the biggest act of Epitaph's roster and had originally declined to leave the label before signing a recording contract with Columbia Records. Following the widespread commercial success of the band's previous album, Smash, frontman Dexter Holland wanted The Offspring to release more albums on Epitaph, or remain on the label for a long time. However, tensions were encountered when Epitaph founder and Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz decided to sell Smash to a major label in "return for a royalty override on it,"[tpl]cite web|title=Dexter Holland on The Offspring leaving Epitaph and joining Columbia | publisher=archive.is |url=http://archive.is/inY4F |accessdate=2013-06-23[/tpl] an action that the band did not like. Gurewitz had approached several major labels, such as Geffen, Capitol and Sony, in attempt to sign The Offspring. The band eventually signed to Columbia, and Holland recalled that they "took less money" with the label and the signing "was not to try and make more money." Holland also claimed that The Offspring signed to Columbia because they would not "record for someone who thinks Gurewitz can force them to" and would not "record for a guy who's worse than a major label." Recording sessions for Ixnay on the Hombre took place from June to October 1996 at Eldorado Recording Studios with producer Dave Jerden (Alice in Chains, Anthrax, Jane's Addiction, Social Distortion).
On the recording process of the album, guitarist Noodles stated:
[tpl]cquote|We recorded a few more songs than we needed, and if we had used some of the other ones that were left off, it would have ended up a little more risky. But we're not disappointed in what we kept. I think it's a great record and I love these songs. Maybe we'll save the limb-walking for the next one.[tpl]cite journal |last=Gula |first=Bob |title=Oodlesnay on Ixnay on the Hombre |journal=Guitar |date=March 1997[/tpl][/tpl]
"Change the World" is a further development of the unnamed hidden track that appeared at the end of the previous album Smash. "Change the World" itself contains a hidden track, a brief spoken piece by Larry "Bud" Melman of the David Letterman Show.

==Release and reception==

Ixnay on the Hombre was released on February 4, 1997, and is the first Offspring album distributed via Columbia Records. Their former label Epitaph Records released it in Europe because of disagreements between the band and the label's founder Brett Gurewitz. The band was able to release its album on Columbia for the US and other international releases but had to complete the album release in Europe through Epitaph. The Offspring would continue releasing albums on Columbia until it was announced in early 2013 that they had fulfilled their contract with the label.[tpl]cite web|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/petition-starts-aimed-at-getting-the-offspring-signed-to-fat-wreck-chords/ |title=Petition Starts Aimed At Getting The Offspring Signed To Fat Wreck Chords |publisher=Music Feeds |date=2013-03-28 |accessdate=2013-05-15[/tpl]
