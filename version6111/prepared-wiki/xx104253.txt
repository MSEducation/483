Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah or 'Sultan Sir Abdu'l Hamid Halim Shah II ibni Ahmad Taj ud-din al-Mukarram Shah [tpl]Abbr|KCMG|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George[/tpl], (4 June 1864 â€“ 13 May 1943) was the 25th Sultan of Kedah. He reigned from 1881 to 1943. He was the son of Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Mukarram Shah and Wan Hajar.
During his reign, the Sultan had asked for a $2,500,000 loan from Siam during a state financial crisis in 1905. The loan was extended with the proviso that a Financial Advisor from the court of Siam be accepted and a State Council be created to assist the Sultan in the administration of all public affairs. This resulted in the promulgation of a new constitution on 29 July 1905. The state council were run by his brothers followed by their sons. The formation of the State Council thus curbed the Sultan's administrative powers.
The Sultan had several wives and partners; Che Manjelara, Che Sofiah, Sharifah Fatimah Binti Syed Idrus, Sharifah Seha Binti Syed Hussein, Che Spachendra, Sharifah Mariam and Che Laraseh. The Sultan's seventh son and twentieth child with Makche Manjelara, Tunku Abdul Rahman, who would later became the first Prime Minister of Malaysia.
He was succeeded by Sultan Badlishah.
