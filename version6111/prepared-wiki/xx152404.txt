==Boarding pass security==

On October 26, 2006, Soghoian created a website that allowed visitors to generate fake boarding passes for Northwest Airlines. While users could change the boarding document to have any name, flight number or city that they wished, the generator defaulted to creating a document for Osama Bin Laden.
Soghoian claimed that his motivation for the website was to focus national attention on the ease with which a passenger could evade the no-fly lists.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.dubfire.net/boarding_pass/ | title=Chris's NWA Boarding Pass Generator | accessdate=2007-03-05 | last=Soghoian | first=Christopher | date=October 26, 2006[/tpl] Information describing the security vulnerabilities associated with boarding pass modification had been widely publicized by others before, including Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.senate.gov/~schumer/SchumerWebsite/pressroom/press_releases/2005/PR4123.aviationsecurity021305.html |title=Schumer reveals new gaping hole in air security |accessdate=2006-11-30 |last=Schumer |first=Charles E. |date= February 13, 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061121183131/http://www.senate.gov/~schumer/SchumerWebsite/pressroom/press_releases/2005/PR4123.aviationsecurity021305.html  |archivedate = November 21, 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://schumer.senate.gov/SchumerWebsite/pressroom/record.cfm?id=259517 |title=Schumer Reveals: In Simple Steps Terrorists Can Forge Boarding Pass And Board Any Plane Without Breaking The Law! |accessdate=2006-11-30 |last=Schumer |first=Charles E. |date=April 9, 2006 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

On October 27, 2006, Democratic Congressman Edward Markey called for Soghoian's arrest.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2006/10/congressman_ed_/ | title=Congressman Ed Markey Wants Security Researcher Arrested | accessdate=2012-12-24 | last=Singel| first=Ryan | date=October 27, 2006 | work= Wired News[/tpl] Two days later, he issued a revised statement stating that Soghoian should not go to jail, and that instead, the Department of Homeland Security should "put him to work" to fix the boarding pass security flaws.[tpl]cite web |url=http://markey.house.gov/press-release/october-29-2006-markey-dont-arrest-student-use-him-fix-loopholes |title=Markey: Don't Arrest Student, Use Him To Fix Loopholes |date=October 29, 2006 | accessdate=2012-12-24 |work=Press Release[/tpl]

==Consumer privacy research and activism==

In May 2011, Soghoian was approached by public relations firm Burson-Marsteller and asked to write an anti-Google op-ed, criticizing the company for privacy issues associated with its social search product. Soghoian refused, and instead published the email conversation. A subsequent investigation by journalists revealed that the PR firm, which had refused to identify its client to Soghoian, had been retained by Facebook.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/14/technology/14facebook.html |title=Facebook, Foe of Anonymity, Is Forced to Explain a Secret |accessdate=2011-07-17 |last=Helft |first=Miguel |date=May 13, 2011 |work=The New York Times[/tpl]
In May 2011, Soghoian filed a complaint with the FTC, in which he claimed that online backup service Dropbox was deceiving its customers about the security of its services.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/05/dropbox-ftc/ | title=Dropbox Lied to Users About Data Security, Complaint to FTC Alleges | accessdate=2011-07-17 | last=Singel| first=Ryan | date=May 13, 2011 | work= Wired News[/tpl] Soon after Soghoian first publicly voiced his concerns, Dropbox updated its terms of service and privacy policy to make it clear that the company does not in fact encrypt user data with a key only known to the user, and that the company can disclose users' private data if forced to by law enforcement agencies.
Soghoian is one of the three co-creators of the Do Not Track mechanism, along with security researchers Sid Stamm and Dan Kaminsky. In July 2009, Soghoian and Stamm created a prototype add-on for the Firefox web browser, implementing support for a new Do Not Track header.[tpl]cite web|url=http://paranoia.dubfire.net/2011/01/history-of-do-not-track-header.html|title=The History of the Do Not Track Header|work=Slight Paranoia|last=Soghoian|first=Christopher|accessdate=February 22, 2012[/tpl] In the three years that followed, all of the major web browsers added support for the header, which is currently being standardized by the W3C.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection/|title=Tracking Protection Working Group|work=W3C|accessdate=February 22, 2012[/tpl]
In June 2009, Soghoian published an open letter[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cloudprivacy.net/letter | title=An open letter to Google's CEO, Eric Schmidt | accessdate=2009-06-20 | last=Soghoian | first=Christopher | date=June 16, 2009[/tpl] to Google that was signed by an additional 37 prominent security and privacy experts, urging the company to protect the privacy of its customers by enabling SSL encryption by default for Gmail and its other cloud based services. In January 2010, Google enabled SSL by default for users of Gmail,[tpl]cite web | url=http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/default-https-access-for-gmail.html | title=Default HTTPS Access For Gmail | accessdate=2010-05-15 | last=Schillace | first=Sam | date=January 12, 2010 | work= The Official Gmail Blog[/tpl] and subsequently for other products, including search (for signed in users).

==Government surveillance research and activism==

In December 2009, Soghoian released an audio recording he made at a closed-door surveillance industry conference. In the recording, an executive from Sprint Nextel revealed that the company had created a special website through which law enforcement agents can obtain GPS information on subscribers and that the website had been used to process 8 million requests during the previous year.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/12/gps-data/ | title=Feds âPingedâ Sprint GPS Data 8 Million Times Over a Year | accessdate=2010-05-15 | last=Zetter| first=Kim  | date=December 1, 2009 | work= Wired News[/tpl] That recording was subsequently cited by Alex Kozinski, Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in U.S. v. Pineda-Moreno, in support of his view that "1984 may have come a bit later than predicted, but it's here at last."
In December 2009, Soghoian released a letter written by lawyers for Yahoo!, objecting to the release of documents detailing how much the company charges for government requested surveillance activities. In the letter, Yahoo!'s attorneys argued that: "The pricing information, if disclosed, would be used to 'shame' Yahoo! and other companies â and to 'shock' their customers. Therefore, release of Yahoo!'s information is reasonably likely to lead to impairment of its reputation for protection of user privacy and security, which is a competitive disadvantage for technology companies."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/12/wiretap-prices/ | title=Yahoo, Verizon: Our Spy Capabilities Would âShockâ, âConfuseâ Consumers  | accessdate=2010-05-15 | last=Zetter| first=Kim  | date=December 1, 2009 | work= Wired News[/tpl] When a copy of the price list subsequently appeared on Cryptome, Yahoo! sent a DMCA takedown request to the website in an attempt to force the removal of the information.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/12/yahoo-spy-prices/ | title=Yahoo Issues Takedown Notice for Spying Price List | accessdate=2010-05-15 | last=Zetter| first=Kim  | date=December 4, 2009 | work= Wired News[/tpl]
