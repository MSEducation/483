The Baumgärtl Heliofly III/57 and Baumgärtl Heliofly III/59 were 1940s experimental backpack helicopters designed and built by the Austrian-designer Paul Bäumgartl. Following on from his earlier experiments with strap-on autgyros the Heliofly III/57 was powered by two [tpl]convert|8|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Argus As 8 piston engines each driving a single-blade of the contra-rotating rotors.Nowarra, Heinz J..

A problem with the supply of the As 8 engine forced a  re-design to use one [tpl]convert|16|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] engine, powering two rotors on a common co-axial shaft, with the engine driving one rotor directly and the other through gearing to overcome the torque effects.
