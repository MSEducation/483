St. Margaret of Cortona's Church is a Roman Catholic parish church under the authority of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, located at 6000 Riverdale Avenue, Riverdale-on-Hudson, The Bronx, New York City, New York.

==Parish history==

The parish was established in 1887 by the Rev. James F. Kiely, with initial services being held in St. Vincent's Free School (now Le Gras Hall on the Campus of Mount Saint Vincent College) The first permanent church was dedicated August 16, 1891 by Archbishop Corrigan. Fr. Kiely was succeeded as pastor by the Rev. Michael J. Murray, who also attended to the Visitation Convent chapel in the parish.

==St. Margaret's Parish School==

Fr. Murray built a school, but because of financial restraints, could not open it when built.  Instead it was leased to the New York City School system in September 1915.  When the building of P.S. 81 was completed in 1926, then pastor, Rev. Thomas J. Doyle opened the parish school in September 1926. In 1915, the congregation numbered "464 men, women and children."
