Omnibenevolence (from Latin omni- meaning "all", and benevolent, meaning "good")http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/omnibenevolent is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "unlimited or infinite benevolence". It is often held to be impossible, or at least improbable, for a deity to exhibit such property alongside omniscience and omnipotence as a result of the problem of evil. However, some philosophers, such as Alvin Plantinga, argue the plausibility of co-existence. The word is primarily used as a technical term within academic literature on the philosophy of religion, mainly in context of the problem of evil and theodical responses to such. Although even in said contexts the phrases "perfect goodness" or "moral perfection" are often preferred because of the difficulties in defining what exactly constitutes 'infinite benevolence'.

==Philosophical perspectives==

The term is patterned on, and often accompanied by, the terms omniscience and omnipotence, typically to refer to conceptions of an "all-good, all-knowing, all-powerful" deity. Philosophers and theologians more commonly use phrases like "perfectly good",[ref]This phrase is used in many notable encyclopedia and dictionary entries, such as:
The notion of an omnibenevolent, infinitely compassionate deity, has raised certain atheistic objections, such as the problem of evil and the problem of hell. Responses to such problems are called theodicies and can be general, arguing for the coherence of the divine, such as Swinburne's Providence and the Problem of Evil, or they can address a specific problem, such as Charles Seymour's A Theodicy of Hell.
Proponents of Pandeism contend that benevolence (much less omnibenevolence) is simply not required to account for any property of our Universe, as a morally neutral deity which was powerful enough to have created our Universe as we experience it would be, by definition, able to have created our Universe as we experience it.

==Religious perspectives==

The acknowledgement of God's omnibenevolence is an essential foundation in traditional Christianity; this can be seen in Scriptures such as Psalms 18:30: "As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him," and Ps.19:7: "The law of the Lord is good, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple."  This understanding is evident in the following statement by the First Vatican Council[tpl]or|date=November 2011[/tpl]:
 
 The Holy, Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Church believes and acknowledges that there is one true and living God, Creator and Lord of Heaven and earth, almighty, eternal, immeasurable, incomprehensible, infinite in will, understanding and every perfection. Since He is one, singular, completely simple and unchangeable spiritual substance, He must be declared to be in reality and in essence, distinct from the world, supremely happy in Himself and from Himself, and inexpressibly loftier than anything besides Himself which either exists or can be imagined.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailycatholic.org/history/20ecume1.htm|title=First Vatican Council|work=dailycatholic.org|accessdate=2008-05-02[/tpl]

The philosophical justification stems from God's aseity: the non-contingent, independent and self-sustained mode of existence that theologians ascribe to God. For if He was not morally perfect, that is, if God was merely a great being but nevertheless of finite benevolence, then his existence would involve an element of contingency, because one could always conceive of a being of greater benevolence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08004a.htm|title=The infinity of God|work=Catholic Encyclopaedia|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=2008-05-02[/tpl]
Theologians in the Wesleyan Christian tradition (see Thomas Jay Oord) argue that omnibenevolence is God's primary attribute.  As such, God's other attributes should be understood in light of omnibenevolence. Christians believe in the idea of unconditional love.
Some Hyper-Calvinist interpretations reject omnibenevolence. For example, the Westboro Baptist Church is infamous for its expression of this stance.
Islam does not hold to the idea of omnibenevolence:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/is-the-islamic-conception-of-god-morally-inadequate|title=Is the Islamic Concept of God Morally Inadequate?|publisher=Reasonable Faith|author=William Lane Craig[/tpl]
Rather, God has a conditional love of the elect:

==Etymology==

"Omnibenevolence" appears to have a very casual usage among some Protestant Christian commentators. The earliest record for its use in English, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is in 1679. The Catholic Church does not appear to use the term "omnibenevolent" in the liturgy or Catechism.
Modern users of the term include George H. Smith in his book Atheism: The Case Against God (1980),[tpl]Cite book | last=Smith | first=George H. | year = 1980 | title=Atheism: The Case Against God | publisher=Prometheus Books | isbn=0-87975-124-X[/tpl] where he argued that divine qualities are inconsistent.  However, the term is also used by authors who defend the coherence of divine attributes, including but not limited to, Jonathan Kvanvig in The Problem of Hell (1993),[tpl]Cite book | last=Kvanvig | first=Jonathan L. | year=1993 | title=The Problem of Hell | publisher=Oxford University Press | pages=4 | isbn=0-19-508487-X[/tpl] and Joshua Hoffman and Gary Rosenkrantz in The Divine Attributes (2002).[tpl]Cite book | last=Hoffman | first=Joshua | coauthors=Gary Rosenkrantz | year=2002 | title=The Divine Attributes | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | isbn=0-631-21154-3[/tpl] Used throughout the book.
