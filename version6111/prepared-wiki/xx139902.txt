[[South German natural gas pipeline]]

CATEGORIES: Natural gas pipelines in Germany, E.ON

South German natural gas pipeline ([tpl]lang-de|Süddeutsche Erdgasleitung (SEL)[/tpl]) was a planned [tpl]convert|500|km|mi|adj=on[/tpl] long German natural gas pipeline with a diameter of 1200 mm, which was planned to run from Burghausen on the German-Austrian border to Lampertheim, state of Hesse. The pipeline was to be constructed jointly by E.ON Ruhrgas and Wingas, a joint venture of Wintershall, subsidiary of BASF, and Russian Gazprom.  The project was expected to cost €600 million ($759.2 million). Project was stopped in November 2008, mainly due to difficulties in financing. According to Wingas, the pipeline project was not economically sustainable; hence the halt of operations.[ref]
