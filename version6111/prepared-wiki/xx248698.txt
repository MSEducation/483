==History==

MD 255 originally included Owensville Road and the portion of MD 468 from Galesville to Shadyside. The portion of MD 255 in Galesville was originally MD 393. Grading work began on MD 255 from the Annapolisâ€“Prince Frederick road east to the Quaker Burying Ground and from there south to Sudley Road in 1920. The gravel highway was completed to Sudley Road in 1921 and proposed to extend to Churchton Deale Road, which is today MD 256. The highway extended to Deep Creek Road on the south side of Shady Side in 1923. MD 255 was completed to Shady Side in 1929 and 1930, the same period during which MD 393 was constructed as a gravel road. By 1934, traffic was dense enough that MD 255 was recommended to be widened from [tpl]convert|16|to|20|ft|m[/tpl] from MD 2 to Shady Side. MD 468 was extended south of Galesville around the West River to Shady Side and MD 255 was extended into Galesville in 1949.
