[[Battle of Buzakha]]

CATEGORIES: Battles of Khalid ibn Walid, Battles involving the Rashidun Caliphate

The Battle of Buzakha took place between Khalid ibn al-Walid and Tulieha, in September 632.

==Strength==

Khalid had 6,000 men under his disposal while Tuleiha had 15,000 men.

==General Engagement==

Khalid at the beginning of the battle challenged Tulieha for a duel. After a brief encounter with Khalid he ran for shelter towards his own army. The battle was a slogging contest in which victory was decided by individual skill rather than by brilliance of maneuver. Khalid emerged victorious.

==Aftermath==

Khalid from here went onto his next objective and almost a month later engaged Salma at the battle of Zafar.
Tulieha on the other hand who had killed a veteran companion of the Prophet by the name of Akasha Bin Mihsan faced a ban from joining in any war. He later asked for forgiveness from Caliph Abu Bakr,who forgave him but he was, along with his tribe,banned from joining in any external campaigns as they had indulged in apostasy and so couldn't be trusted. It would be in Caliph Umar's reign that they would be finally allowed to participate in battles. Tuleiha served with great distinction in the Persian campaign, especially in the Battle of Qadisiya. It was in the Battle of Nihawand that he fell as a martytr.
