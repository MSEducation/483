===French Aid===

Once news of Burgoyne's surrender reached France,  King Louis XVI decided to enter into negotiations with the Americans that resulted in a formal Franco-American alliance and French entry into the war. This moved the conflict onto a global stage.Ketchum (1997), pp. 405–448  As a consequence, Britain was forced to divert resources used to fight the war in North America to theaters in the West Indies and Europe, and rely on what turned out to be the chimera of Loyalist support in its North American operations.Ketchum (1997), p. 447  Being defeated by the British in the French and Indian War a decade ago, France found an opportunity of revenge by aiding the colonists throughout the Revolutionary War. Prior to the Battle of Saratoga, France didn't fully aid the colonists. However, after the Battles of Saratoga were conclusively won by the colonists, France realized that the Americans had hope of winning the war, and began fully aiding the colonists by sending soldiers, donations, loans, military arms, and supplies.[tpl]cite web|last=Perkins|first=James|title=France in the Revolution|url=http://www.americanrevolution.org/frcon.html|accessdate=2013-06-29[/tpl]

The battlefield and the site of Burgoyne's surrender have been preserved, and are now administered by the National Park Service as the Saratoga National Historical Park, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.  The park preserves a number of the buildings in the area, and contains a variety of monuments.Saratoga National Historical Park
The Saratoga Monument obelisk has four niches, three of which hold statues of American generals: Gates and Schuyler and of Colonel Daniel Morgan.  The fourth niche, where Arnold's statue would go, is empty.Saratoga activities  A more dramatic memorial to Arnold's heroism, that does not name him, is the Boot Monument.  Donated by Civil War General John Watts de Peyster, it shows a boot with spurs and the stars of a major general.  It stands at the spot where Arnold was shot on October 7 charging Breymann's redoubt, and is dedicated to "the most brilliant soldier of the Continental Army".Saratoga National Historical Park Tour Stop 7
