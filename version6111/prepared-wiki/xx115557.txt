[[Viciria]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Viciria is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders).

==Description==

Both sexes reach a length of about 7 to 12Â mm. Viciria is a colorful genus similar to Telamonia. However, the very long, thin opisthosoma of Viciria is almost cylindrical, and the color patterns differ. Viciria often shows a single broad longitudinal stripe with a pattern of black dashes on the opisthosoma. A white median stripe is present on the cephalus of the female.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 301
V. praemandibularis males have an orange carapace with bronze iridescent hairs on the cephalus, and an orange opisthosoma with a dark brown median stripe. The legs are yellowish, except for the brown first pair. The carapace of the female is yellowish with a white stripe, bordered by two orange stripes. The median stripe of the opisthosoma is bright orange, narrowly bordered with white. The rest of the opisthosoma is yellowish. The legs are paler than in males.

==Distribution==

Like Telamonia, Viciria is found in Africa and Asia.
