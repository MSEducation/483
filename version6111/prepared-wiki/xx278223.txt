==Biography==

He was born George Louis Pride, in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Pride grew up on Chicago's north side and attended the First Baptist Church, where the pastor was Nat King Cole's father.
After conscription in the United States Army, Pride met and married a female singer and they settled in El Paso, Texas.  They performed as a singing duo before, after seeing B.B. King perform live, Pride concentrated his singing future around the blues and soul music genres. Pride recorded his first two singles in the early 1970s. These were "I'm Com'un Home In The Morn'un" (1972) and "Your Love Is Fading," the latter released by Suemi Records.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Lou-Pride.html |title=Lou Pride Biography |publisher=OLDIES.com |date=1950-05-24 |accessdate=2013-08-08[/tpl] After relocating to New Mexico, he recorded sporadically whilst constantly performing in blues clubs and at festivals on the chitlin' circuit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blues.about.com/b/2012/06/07/soul-blues-singer-lou-pride-r-i-p.htm |title=Soul-Blues Singer Lou Pride, R.I.P |publisher=Blues.about.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08[/tpl] Other tracks of his that were released over this period included  "Look Out on Love," "We're Only Fooling Ourselves," "You've Got to Work for Love," and "Been Such a Long Time."
Pride's debut album was entitled, Very Special (1979), which was released by Black Gold Entertainment. Several singles were issued before Gone Bad for a Very Special Reason (1988) was released, which had an almost an identical playlist to his debut effort.
After returning to Chicago, he became acquainted with Curtis Mayfield, which saw Gone Bad Again (1990) being issued. However, Pride's recordings remained second place to performing live.
