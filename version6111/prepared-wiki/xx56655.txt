==Overview==

The original title of "War Pigs" was "Walpurgis", dealing with the witches' sabbath.[tpl]cite book |last=Iommi |first=Tony |title=Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven and Hell with Black Sabbath |year=2011 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-30681-9551[/tpl][tpl]cite AV media notes|title=Reunion|titlelink=Reunion (Black Sabbath album)|others=Black Sabbath|year=1998|first=Phil|last=Alexander|publisher=Epic[/tpl] "Walpurgis is sort of like Christmas for Satanists. And to me, war was the big Satan", said bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler. "It wasn’t about politics or government or anything. It was (about) evil. So I was saying 'generals gathered in the masses/just like witches at black masses' to make an analogy. But when we brought it to the record company, they thought 'Walpurgis' sounded too Satanic. And that’s when we turned it into ‘War Pigs.’ But we didn’t change the lyrics, because they were already finished."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.noisecreep.com/2010/07/30/black-sabbath-bassist-geezer-butler-gets-paranoid/|title=Black Sabbath Bassist Geezer Butler Gets 'Paranoid' - Noisecreep|last=Wiederhorn|first=Jon|publisher=Noisecreep|accessdate=16 August 2010[/tpl] Prior to its official release, the band often altered the lyrics significantly when performing it live.[tpl]cite book|title=Black Sabbath: Doom Let Loose: An Illustrated History|author=Popoff, Martin|page=32|publisher=ECW press|year=2006|isbn=1-55022-731-9[/tpl] An example of this can be found on Ozzy Osbourne's compilation The Ozzman Cometh, which features an early version recorded by Black Sabbath for BBC Radio 1 on 4/26/70.The Ozzman Cometh liner notes, Epic Records, November 11, 1997. While Butler has said that War Pigs is "totally against the Vietnam War, about how these rich politicians and rich people start all the wars for their benefit and get all the poor people to die for them", vocalist Osbourne has stated that the group "knew nothing about Vietnam. It's just an anti-war song."[tpl]cite book |last=Clerk |first=Carol |title=Diary of a Madman: Ozzy Osbourne:The Stories Behind the Songs |year=2002 |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |page=25 |isbn=978-1-56025-4720[/tpl]
Drummer Bill Ward's first memory of performing the song was at The Beat Club in Switzerland in 1968.[tpl]cite book|title=Black Sabbath: Doom Let Loose: An Illustrated History|author=Popoff, Martin|page=33|publisher=ECW press|year=2006|isbn=1-55022-731-9[/tpl] The band were required to play multiple sets every night and had little material in their repertoire at that point, so they would perform lengthy jam sessions to fill out the sets. Iommi has said that "War Pigs" originated from one of those live jam sessions.[tpl]cite news|title=Rhino Bows Sabbath Fete with Two-Disc Anthology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14&dq=Black+Sabbath+War+Pigs+jam#v=onepage&q=Black%20Sabbath%20War%20Pigs%20jam&f=false|last=Orshoski|first=Wes|magazine=Billboard|date=2 November 2002[/tpl] 
The addition of the air-raid siren and the speeding up of the song's end were done by producer Rodger Bain and engineer Tom Allom. The band had no input in these decisions, though they were pleased with the results.
