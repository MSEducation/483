==About Mersenne primes==

Many fundamental questions about Mersenne primes remain unresolved. It is not even known whether the set of Mersenne primes is finite or infinite. The Lenstra–Pomerance–Wagstaff conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes and predicts their order of growth. It is also not known whether infinitely many Mersenne numbers with prime exponents are composite, although this would follow from widely believed conjectures about prime numbers, for example, the infinitude of Sophie Germain primes congruent to 3 (mod 4).
The first four Mersenne primes are
A basic theorem about Mersenne numbers states that if Mp is prime, then the exponent p must also be prime. This follows from the identity
This rules out primality for Mersenne numbers with composite exponent, such as M4 = 24 − 1 = 15 = 3×5 = (22 − 1)×(1 + 22).
Though it was believed by early mathematicians that Mp is prime for all primes p, Mp is very rarely prime. In fact, of the 
1,881,339 prime numbers p up to 30,402,457,{{cite web |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Number+of+primes+%3C%3D+30402457 |title=Number of primes p is prime for only 43 of them. The smallest counterexample is the Mersenne number
The lack of any simple test to determine whether a given Mersenne number is prime makes the search for Mersenne primes a difficult task, since Mersenne numbers grow very rapidly. The Lucas–Lehmer primality test (LLT) is an efficient primality test that greatly aids this task. The search for the largest known prime has somewhat of a cult following. Consequently, a lot of computer power has been expended searching for new Mersenne primes, much of which is now done using distributed computing.
Mersenne primes are used in pseudorandom number generators such as the Mersenne twister, Park–Miller random number generator, Generalized Shift Register and Fibonacci RNG.

==Perfect numbers==

Mersenne primes Mp are also noteworthy due to their connection to perfect numbers. In the 4th century BC, Euclid proved that if 2p−1 is prime, then 2p−1(2p − 1) is a perfect number. This number, also expressible as Mp(Mp+1)/2, is the Mpth triangular number and the 2p − 1th hexagonal number. In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler proved that, conversely, all even perfect numbers have this form.Chris K. Caldwell, Mersenne Primes: History, Theorems and Lists It is unknown whether there are any odd perfect numbers.

==History==

Mersenne primes take their name from the 17th-century French scholar Marin Mersenne, who compiled what was supposed to be a list of Mersenne primes with exponents up to 257. His list was largely incorrect, as Mersenne mistakenly included M67 and M257 (which are composite), and omitted M61, M89, and M107 (which are prime). Mersenne gave little indication how he came up with his list.The Prime Pages, Mersenne's conjecture.
Édouard Lucas proved in 1876 that M127 is indeed prime, as Mersenne claimed.  This was the largest known prime number for 75 years, and the largest ever calculated by hand.  M61 was determined to be prime in 1883 by Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin, though Mersenne claimed it was composite, and for this reason it is sometimes called Pervushin's number.  This was the second-largest known prime number, and it remained so until 1911. Lucas had shown another error in Mersenne's list in 1876. Without finding a factor, Lucas demonstrated that M67 is actually composite. No factor was found until a famous talk by Cole in 1903.  Without speaking a word, he went to a blackboard and raised 2 to the 67th power, then subtracted one.  On the other side of the board, he multiplied 193,707,721 × 761,838,257,287 and got the same number, then returned to his seat (to applause) without speaking.[ref]
 p. 228.[/ref] He later said that the result had taken him "three years of Sundays" to find.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/plain/A670051 | work=BBC News[/tpl] A correct list of all Mersenne primes in this number range was completed and rigorously verified only about three centuries after Mersenne published his list.

==Searching for Mersenne primes==

Fast algorithms for finding Mersenne primes are available, and as of 2014 the ten largest known prime numbers are Mersenne primes.
The first four Mersenne primes M2 = 3, M3 = 7, M5 = 31 and M7 = 127 were known in antiquity. The fifth, M13 = 8191, was discovered anonymously before 1461; the next two (M17 and M19) were found by Cataldi in 1588. After nearly two centuries, M31 was verified to be prime by Euler in 1772. The next (in historical, not numerical order) was M127, found by Lucas in 1876, then M61 by Pervushin in 1883. Two more (M89 and M107) were found early in the 20th century, by Powers in 1911 and 1914, respectively.
The best method presently known for testing the primality of Mersenne numbers is the Lucas–Lehmer primality test. Specifically, it can be shown that for prime p > 2, Mp = 2p − 1 is prime if and only if Mp divides Sp−2, where S0 = 4 and, for k > 0,
The search for Mersenne primes was revolutionized by the introduction of the electronic digital computer. Alan Turing searched for them on the Manchester Mark 1 in 1949,Brian Napper, The Mathematics Department and the Mark 1. but the first successful identification of a Mersenne prime, M521, by this means was achieved at 10:00 pm on January 30, 1952 using the U.S. National Bureau of Standards Western Automatic Computer (SWAC) at the Institute for Numerical Analysis at the University of California, Los Angeles, under the direction of Lehmer, with a computer search program written and run by Prof. R. M. Robinson. It was the first Mersenne prime to be identified in thirty-eight years; the next one, M607, was found by the computer a little less than two hours later. Three more — M1279, M2203, M2281 — were found by the same program in the next several months. M4253 is the first Mersenne prime that is titanic, M44497 is the first gigantic, and M6,972,593 was the first megaprime to be discovered, being a prime with at least 1,000,000 digits.The Prime Pages, The Prime Glossary: megaprime. All three were the first known prime of any kind of that size.
In September 2008, mathematicians at UCLA participating in GIMPS won part of a $100,000 prize from the Electronic Frontier Foundation for their discovery of a very nearly 13-million-digit Mersenne prime. The prize, finally confirmed in October 2009, is for the first known prime with at least 10 million digits.  The prime was found on a Dell OptiPlex 745 on August 23, 2008.  This is the eighth Mersenne prime discovered at UCLA.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-prime27-2008sep27,0,2746766.story |title=UCLA mathematicians discover a 13-million-digit prime number|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2008-09-27 |accessdate=2011-05-21|first=Thomas H.|last=Maugh II[/tpl]
On April 12, 2009, a GIMPS server log reported that a 47th Mersenne prime had possibly been found. This report was apparently overlooked until June 4, 2009. The find was verified on June 12, 2009. The prime is 2[tpl]sup|42,643,801[/tpl] − 1. Although it is chronologically the 47th Mersenne prime to be discovered, it is smaller than the largest known at the time, which was the 45th to be discovered.
On January 25, 2013, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician at the University of Central Missouri, discovered a 48th Mersenne prime, 2[tpl]sup|57,885,161[/tpl] − 1 (a number with 17,425,170 digits), as a result of a search executed by a GIMPS server network.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=largest-prime-number-disc |title=Largest Prime Number Discovered |author=Tia Ghose |publisher=Scientific American |accessdate=2013-02-07[/tpl]  This was the third Mersenne prime discovered by Dr. Cooper and his team in the past seven years.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) offers a prize of $150,000 to the first individual or group who discovers a prime number with at least 100,000,000 decimal digitshttps://www.eff.org/awards/coop/ (the smallest Mersenne number with said amount of digits is  2332192807 − 1).

==List of known Mersenne primes==

The table below lists all known Mersenne primes [tpl]OEIS|id=A000668[/tpl]:
[tpl]note label|unverified_index|*|^ *[/tpl] It is not verified whether any undiscovered Mersenne primes exist between the 43rd (M30,402,457) and the 48th (M57,885,161) on this chart; the ranking is therefore provisional. All Mersenne numbers below the 47th (M43,112,609) in the interval have been tested at least once but some have not been double-checked. Some Mersenne numbers above the 47th have not yet been tested.GIMPS Milestones Report. Retrieved 2014-02-23 Primes are not always discovered in increasing order. For example, the 29th Mersenne prime was discovered after the 30th and the 31st. Similarly, M43,112,609 was followed by two smaller Mersenne primes, first 2 weeks later and then 8 months later.
[tpl]note label|date_issue|**|^ **[/tpl] M42,643,801 was first found by a machine on April 12, 2009; however, no human took notice of this fact until June 4. Thus, either April 12 or June 4 may be considered the 'discovery' date. The discoverer, Strindmo, apparently used the alias Stig M. Valstad.

To help visualize the size of the 48th known Mersenne prime, it would require 4,647 pages to display the number in base 10 with 75 digits per line and 50 lines per page.
The largest known Mersenne prime (257,885,161 − 1) is also the largest known prime number. M43,112,609 was the first discovered prime number with more than 10 million base-10 digits.
In modern times, the largest known prime has almost always been a Mersenne prime.The largest known prime has been a Mersenne prime since 1952, except between 1989 and 1992; see Caldwell, "The Largest Known Prime by Year: A Brief History" from the Prime Pages website, University of Tennessee at Martin.

==Factorization of composite Mersenne numbers==

The factorization of a prime number is by definition the number itself. This section is about composite numbers. Mersenne numbers are very good test cases for the special number field sieve algorithm, so often the largest number factorized with this algorithm has been a Mersenne number.  [tpl]As of|2012|8[/tpl], 2[tpl]sup|1,061[/tpl] − 1 is the record-holder,Greg Childers, "Factorization of a 1061-bit number by the Special Number Field Sieve". using the special number field sieve.  See integer factorization records for links to more information. The special number field sieve can factorize numbers with more than one large factor. If a number has only one very large factor then other algorithms can factorize larger numbers by first finding small factors and then making a primality test on the cofactor. [tpl]As of|2014|February[/tpl], the composite Mersenne number with largest proven prime factor is 2[tpl]sup|63,703[/tpl] − 1 = [tpl]nobreak|42,808,417 × p[/tpl], where p has 19,169 digits and was proven prime with ECPP.Chris Caldwell, The Top Twenty: Mersenne cofactor at The Prime Pages. Retrieved 2014-01-25. [tpl]As of|2014|February[/tpl], the largest factorization with probable prime factors allowed is 2[tpl]sup|1,168,183[/tpl] − 1 = [tpl]nobreak|54,763,676,838,381,762,583 × q[/tpl], where q is a 351,639-digit probable prime.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.primenumbers.net/prptop/searchform.php?form=(2^p-1)/%3F&action=Search |title=PRP Top Records |author=Henri Lifchitz and Renaud Lifchitz |accessdate=2014-01-28[/tpl]

==Mersenne numbers in nature and elsewhere==

In computer science, unsigned n-bit integers can be used to express numbers up to Mn. Signed (n + 1)-bit integers can express values between −(Mn + 1) and Mn, using the two's complement representation.
In the mathematical problem Tower of Hanoi, solving a puzzle with an n-disc tower requires Mn steps, assuming no mistakes are made.[tpl]cite book|last=Petković|first=Miodrag|title=Famous Puzzles of Great Mathematicians|year=2009|publisher=AMS Bookstore|isbn=0-8218-4814-3|pages=197[/tpl]
The asteroid with minor planet number 8191 is named 8191 Mersenne after Marin Mersenne, because 8191 is a Mersenne prime (3 Juno, 7 Iris, 31 Euphrosyne and 127 Johanna having been discovered and named during the 19th century).[tpl]cite web|author=Alan Chamberlin |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=8191+Mersenne |title=JPL Small-Body Database Browser |publisher=Ssd.jpl.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-05-21[/tpl]
