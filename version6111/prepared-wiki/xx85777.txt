Arago.  It was during his time at the École Polytechnique that he developed his interest in astronomy.[tpl]cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=Springer Publishing |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58446.html[/tpl] 
He studied comets, and discovered the periodic comet 4P/Faye on 22 November 1843.  His discovery of "Faye's comet" attracted worldwide attention, and won him the 1844 Lalande Prize prize and a membership in the Academy of Sciences.  In 1848 he became an instructor  in geodesy at the Polytechnique, and in 1854 rector of the academy at Nancy and professor of astronomy in the faculty of science there.  Other promotions followed in succeeding decades.  He became Minister of Public Instruction in the Rochebouet cabinet in 1877, a position which he held only briefly.
His work covered the entire field of astronomical investigation.  It comprised the determination of comet periods, the measurement of parallaxes, and the study of stellar and planetary movements.  He also studied the physics of the sun.  He advanced several original theories on the nature and form of comets, meteors, the aurora borealis, and the sun.
