==Boxing career==

Ali began boxing when she was 18 years old, after having first noticed women's boxing when watching a Christy Martin fight.[tpl]cite news|last=Sachs|first=Mark|title=My Favorite Weekend: Laila Ali; For her, nothing beats laying low|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 3, 2006[/tpl] She first publicized her decision to become a professional boxer in a Good Morning America interview with Diane Sawyer.[tpl]cite web|last=Cortez|first=Ion|title=Sexy Female Boxers: They Will Knock You Down|url=http://amog.com/sports/152989-sexy-female-boxers-knock/|work=amog.com|accessdate=25 August 2013|date=March 29, 2012[/tpl] When she first told her father, Muhammad Ali, that she was planning to box professionally, he was unhappy about her entering such a dangerous profession. However, Laila assured him she would be fighting women, not men, and she had his genetics.[tpl]cite news|journal=The New York Times|title=BOXING; Another Ali Enters the Ring: His Daughter|author= TIMOTHY W. SMITH|date= February 23, 1999[/tpl]
In her first match, on October 8, 1999, the 5'10", 166 lbs, 21-year-old Ali boxed April Fowler of Michigan City, Indiana. They fought at the Turning Stone Resort & Casino on the Oneida Indian Nation in Verona, New York. Although this was Ali's first match, many journalists and fans attended, largely because she was Muhammad Ali's daughter. Attention to Ali's ring debut was further boosted because it occurred on the eve of what was supposed to be the first male-female professional bout ever to be sanctioned by a US state boxing commission ... later ruled an exhibition. As WomenBoxing.com explains: "The near-alignment of the two events focused more attention on female professional boxing than there had been since Christy Martin's 1996 pay-per-view fight with Deirdre Gogarty." Ali knocked out April Fowler - described by WomenBoxing.com as an "out-of-shape novice" - in the first round.
Ali also won her second match by a TKO with only 3 seconds left on the clock. In that match her opponent was 5'4" Shadina Pennybaker, from Pittsburgh, who was making a pro debut after earning a 2-1 record as an amateur. They fought at the Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort in Chester, West Virginia.
Ali captured eight wins in a row and many boxing fans expressed a desire to see her square off in a boxing ring with George Foreman's daughter, Freeda Foreman or Joe Frazier's daughter, Jackie Frazier-Lyde. On the evening of June 8, 2001, Ali and Frazier finally met. The fight was nicknamed Ali/Frazier IV in allusion to their fathers' famous fight trilogy. Ali won by a majority judges' decision in eight rounds. This match by Ali and Frazier was the first pay-per-view match between two black women.
After a year's hiatus, on June 7, 2002 Ali beat Shirvelle Williams in a six-round decision.[tpl]cite news|last=Feour|first=Royce|title=Laila Ali motivated by father|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=August 17, 2002[/tpl]

On November 8, she retained that title and unified the crown by adding the WIBA and IWBF belts with an eight-round TKO win over her division's other world champion, Valerie Mahfood, in Las Vegas. Ali stopped a bloodied Mahfood in eight rounds.[tpl]cite web|last=Bennett|first=Amy Beth|title=Laila Ali takes two more title belts|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2002-11-09-ali_x.htm|work=usatoday|accessdate=25 August 2013|date=November 8, 2002[/tpl]
On June 21, 2003, Mahfood and Ali fought a rematch, this time in Los Angeles. Once again bloodied by Ali, Mahfood lost by TKO in six rounds while trying to recover her world title. Nevertheless, for the first time in Ali's boxing career, she suffered a bad cut on her right eyelid and a bloodied nose, inflicted by Mahfood, something no other female boxer has done to Ali to this day.[tpl]cite web|last=Lewis|first=Mike|title=Boxing: Ali's chance to knock out the critics|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxing/2409705/Boxing-Alis-chance-to-knock-out-the-critics.html|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=25 August 2013|date=August 17, 2003[/tpl]

On June 11, 2005, on the undercard to the Tyson-Kevin McBride fight, Ali defeated Erin Toughill in round three to remain undefeated and won the World Boxing Council title in addition to defending her WIBA crown.

In 2002, Ali wrote (with co-author David Ritz) the book Reach! Finding Strength, Spirit, and Personal Power,[tpl]cite book|title=Reach! Finding Strength, Spirit, and Personal Power|authors=David Ritz and Laila Ali|publisher=Hyperion|edition= 1st |date=June 2002|ISBN= 978-0786868551[/tpl] meant to motivate and inspire young people. In this book, she confides that she felt isolated at times because of her parents' fame. Ali has also spent some time in jail, and describes her arrests and the physical abuse she experienced in jail. Critics say that Ali's book has a good foundation but she does not give the readers advice; rather she just talks about her own experiences.[tpl]cite web|title=REACH!

Ali is also credited with saving the life of American Gladiators co-host and wrestling legend Hulk Hogan by telephoning him when he was depressed and suicidal - a call which Hogan (in his book My Life Outside The Ring) claims "snapped me out" of an acute suicidal "trance".[tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|first1=Hulk|last1= Hogan|first2=Mark|last2=Dagostino|date=November 27, 2009|asin= B004S7QBIG[/tpl]
