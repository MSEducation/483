The Yokosuka MXY8 ''Akigusa'' (秋草, "Autumn grass") was a training glider built in parallel with the Mitsubishi J8M rocket-powered interceptor aircraft.

==Design and development==

The J8M was to have simply been a licence-built Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet, but due to difficulties in obtaining technical materials from Germany, it eventually had to be designed almost from scratch.[tpl]harvnb|Francillon|1979|p=404.[/tpl] The MXY8 was designed in parallel with the J8M to validate the design, and then to provide pilot training during the development of the actual interceptor.[tpl]harvnb|Francillon|1979|p=405.[/tpl] The Army designation for the type was Ku-13.[tpl]harvnb|Francillon|1979|pp=405–406.[/tpl]
The MXY8 was built entirely of wood, and fitted with ballast tanks that would be filled with water to simulate the weight and therefore flight characteristics of a fully equipped J8M. Some 50-60 of these gliders were eventually built.
A more advanced trainer, the MXY9, equipped with a primitive jet engine was planned, but was never produced.[tpl]harvnb|Francillon|1979|p=406.[/tpl]
Many sources apply the designation MXY8 to the Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka kamikaze weapon.
