Charles Edward Creighton (born August 6, 1876 in Belfast, Ireland; died July 30, 1949) was an Irish-American soccer referee.
Born in Northern Ireland, Creighton moved to the United States in his twenties.  He appears to have begun refeering local soccer games almost immediately after arriving in the U.S.  He was known as one of the best referees in the country.  His reputation led to his selection to referee the first National Challenge Cup in 1914.  He was again in the middle for the 1918 National Challenge Cup, 1927 National Challenge Cup and the first game of the 1931 National Challenge Cup.  He also refereed two American Cup championship finals, one in 1917.  On November 6, 1926, he refereed his only international match, a U.S. win over Canada.
