</ref>  The [[input/output|output]] of a digital circuit or computer program at any time is completely determined by its current [[input/output|inputs]] and its state.

==Digital logic circuit state==

Digital logic circuits can be divided into two types: combinational logic, whose output signals are dependent only on its present input signals, and sequential logic, whose outputs are a function of both the current inputs and the past history of inputs.[ref]
