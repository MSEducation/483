Robert Ferguson Legget, [tpl]Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC|FRSC[/tpl] (September 29, 1904 â€“ April 17, 1994) was a civil engineer, historian and non-fiction writer. He was internationally known for his contributions to engineering, geology and building research and standardization. He is credited with the establishment of co-operation among Canadian geotechnical engineers, geologists and pedologists.
Legget was born in Liverpool, England of Scottish parents. He obtained a B.Eng. (Hons) 1925, M.Eng. 1927, and D.Eng. (honorary) 1971 from the University of Liverpool.
Legget died in Ottawa at the age of 89.

==Career==

He worked for 11 years as a civil engineer in the construction industry in England and subsequently in Canada. In 1936, he began teaching at Queen's University and the University of Toronto. He left teaching in 1947 to establish and serve as director of the National Research Council of Canada's new Division of Building Research. He held this position until he retired in 1969. His legacy there was to establish a National Building Code that was respected throughout all of Canada, as opposed to the multitude of inconsistent local codes that were prevalent in 1947.
Around 1945, after World War II, Leggat shaped the Environmental Conservation movement in Ontario by spearheading the Guelph Conference, the Ganaraska Study and the Conservation Authorities Act of Ontario (1946).
He was the founding President of the Canadian Academy of Engineering.
Between 1959 and 1960, Legget was the Chairman of the Engineering Geology Division of the Geological Society of America.
After he retired, Dr. Legget wrote many books on the history of transportation in Canada including  Ottawa Waterway Gateway to A Continent, Rideau Waterway, Canals of Canada, The Seaway, and others.
