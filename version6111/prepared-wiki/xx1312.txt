Canis Major [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|k|eɪ|n|ɨ|s|_|ˈ|m|eɪ|dʒ|ər[/tpl] is a constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere. In the second century, it was included in Ptolemy's 48 constellations, and is counted among the 88 modern constellations. Its name is Latin for "greater dog" in contrast to Canis Minor, the "lesser dog"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of Orion the hunter. The Milky Way passes through Canis Major and several open clusters lie within its borders.
Canis Major contains Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, known as the 'dog star'. It is bright because of its proximity to our Solar System. In contrast, the other bright stars of the constellation are stars of great distance and high luminosity. At magnitude 1.5, Epsilon Canis Majoris (Adhara) is the second brightest star of the constellation and one of the brightest sources of ultraviolet radiation in the night sky. Next in brightness are the yellow-white supergiant Delta (Wezen) at 1.8, the blue-white giant Beta (Mirzam) at 2.0, blue-white supergiants Eta (Aludra) at 2.4 and Omicron1 at 3.0, and white spectroscopic binary Zeta (Furud), also at 3.0. The red hypergiant VY Canis Majoris is one of the largest stars known, while the neutron star RX J0720.4-3125 has a radius of a mere 5 km.

==History and mythology==

In ancient Mesopotamia, Sirius was seen as an arrow, KAK.SI.DI, aiming towards Orion, while the southern stars of Canis Major and a part of Puppis were viewed as a bow, BAN in the Three Stars Each tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later MUL.APIN, the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior Ninurta, and the bow with Ishtar, daughter of Enlil.[tpl]cite journal | first=John H. | last=Rogers | year=1998 | title=Origins of the Ancient Constellations: I.

In Greek Mythology, Canis Major represented the dog Laelaps, a gift from Zeus to Europa; or sometimes the hound of Procris, Diana's nymph; or the one given by Aurora to Cephalus, so famed for its speed that Zeus elevated it to the sky.[tpl]sfn|Allen|1963|p=117[/tpl] It was also considered to represent one of Orion's hunting dogs,[tpl]sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99[/tpl] pursuing Lepus the Hare or helping Orion fight Taurus the Bull; and is referred to in this way by Aratos, Homer and Hesiod. The ancient Greeks refer only to one dog, but by Roman times, Canis Minor appears as Orion's second dog. Alternate names include Canis Sequens and Canis Alter.[tpl]sfn|Allen|1963|p=117[/tpl] Canis Syrius was the name used in the 1521 Alfonsine Tables.[tpl]sfn|Allen|1963|p=117[/tpl]
The Roman myth refers to Canis Major as Custos Europae, the dog guarding Europa but failing to prevent her abduction by Jupiter in the form of a bull; and as Janitor Lethaeus, the watchdog.[tpl]sfn|Allen|1963|p=118[/tpl] In medieval Arab astronomy, the constellation became Al Kalb al Akbar, the Greater Dog, transcribed as Alcheleb Alachbar by 17th century writer Edmund Chilmead. Islamic scholar Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī referred to Orion called it  Al Kalb al Jabbār, "the Dog of the Giant".[tpl]sfn|Allen|1963|p=117[/tpl] Among the Merazig of Tunisia, shepherds note six constellations that mark the passage of the dry, hot season. One of them, called Merzem, includes the stars of Canis Major and Canis Minor and is the herald of two weeks of hot weather.[tpl]cite journal |title = A Review of African Ethno-Astronomy: With Particular Reference to Saharan Livestock-Keepers |last = Oxby |first = Claire |journal = La Ricerca Folklorica |date = October 1999 |pages = 57–58 | jstor = 1479768 |issue = 40[/tpl]

==In non-western astronomy==

In Chinese astronomy, the modern constellation of Canis Major lies in The Vermillion Bird of the South (南方朱雀, Nán Fāng Zhū Què), where the stars were classified in several separate asterisms of stars. The Military Market (Jūnshì 軍市) was a circular pattern of stars containing Nu3, Beta, Xi1 and Xi2, and some stars from Lepus.[tpl]sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=428[/tpl] The Wild Cockerel (Yějī 野雞) was at the centre of the Military Market and its stars were uncertain. Schlegel reported that the stars Omicron and Pi Canis Majoris might have been them,[tpl]sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=430[/tpl] while Beta or Nu2 have also been proposed.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/canismajor.htm |work=Star Tales  | title=Canis Major – the Greater Dog |last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|publisher=self-published | accessdate= 1 March 2014[/tpl] Sirius was Tiānláng (天狼), the Celestial Wolf,[tpl]sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=431[/tpl] denoting invasion and plunder. Southeast of the Wolf was the asterism Húshǐ (弧矢), the celestial Bow and Arrow, which was interpreted as containing Delta, Epsilon, Eta and Kappa Canis Majoris and Delta Velorum, or that the arrow was Omicron2 and Eta and aiming at Sirius (the Wolf) and the bow comprised Kappa, Epsilon, Sigma, Delta and 164 Canis Majoris, and Pi and Omicron Puppis.[tpl]sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=434[/tpl]
Both the Maori people and the people of the Tuamotus recognized the figure of Canis Major as a distinct entity, though it was sometimes absorbed into other constellations. Te Huinga-o-Rehua, also called Te Putahi-nui-o-Rehua and Te Kahui-Takurua, ("The Assembly of Rehua" or "The Assembly of Sirius") was a Maori constellation that included both Canis Minor and Canis Major, along with some surrounding stars.[tpl]sfn|Makemson|1941|p=212[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Makemson|1941|p=215[/tpl] Related was Taumata-o-Rehua, also called Pukawanui, the Mirror of Rehua, formed from an undefined group of stars in Canis Major.[tpl]sfn|Makemson|1941|p=258[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Makemson|1941|p=247[/tpl] They called Sirius Rehua and Takarua, corresponding to two of the names for the constellation, though Rehua was a name applied to other stars in various Maori groups and other Polynesian cosmologies.[tpl]sfn|Makemson|1941|p=249[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Makemson|1941|p=254[/tpl] The Tuamotu people called Canis Major Muihanga-hetika-o-Takurua, "the abiding assemblage of Takurua".[tpl]sfn|Makemson|1941|p=236[/tpl]
The Tharumba people of the Shoalhaven River saw three stars of Canis Major as Wunbula (Bat) and his two wives Murrumbool (Mrs Brown Snake) and Moodtha (Mrs Black Snake); bored of following their husband around, the women try to bury him while he is hunting a wombat down its hole. He spears them and all three are placed in the sky as the constellation Munowra.[tpl]cite book|last=Ridley|first=William|title=Kámilarói, and other Australian languages|publisher=T.

==Characteristics==

Canis Major is a constellation in the southern hemisphere's summer (or northern hemisphere's winter) sky, bordered by Monoceros (which lies between it and Canis Minor) to the north, Puppis to the east and southeast, Columba to the southwest, and Lepus to the west. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is 'CMa'.[tpl]cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | pages=469–71 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922[/tpl] The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 4 sides. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between [tpl]RA|06|12.5[/tpl] and [tpl]RA|07|27.5[/tpl], while the declination coordinates are between −11.03° and −33.25°.[tpl]cite journal | title=Canis Major, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#cma | accessdate=15 November 2012[/tpl] Covering 380 square degrees or 0.921% of the sky, it ranks 43rd of the 88 constellations in size.[tpl]cite book |last=Bagnall |first=Philip M. |title=The Star Atlas Companion: What You Need to Know about the Constellations |publisher=Springer  |location=New York, New York |year=2012 |isbn=1-4614-0830-X |pages=99–106|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KcIg02TKW6QC&pg=PA105&dq=Canis+Majoris#v=onepage&q=Canis%20Majoris&f=false[/tpl]

==Notable features==

===Stars===

The German cartographer Johann Bayer used the Greek letters Alpha through Omicron to label the most prominent stars in the constellation, including three adjacent stars as Nu and two further pairs as Xi and Omicron,[tpl]sfn|Wagman|2003|p=73[/tpl] while subsequent observers designated further stars in the southern parts of the constellation that were hard to discern from Central Europe.[tpl]sfn|Wagman|2003|p=71[/tpl] Bayer's countryman Johann Elert Bode later added Sigma, Tau and Omega,[tpl]sfn|Wagman|2003|p=74[/tpl] while the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille added lettered stars a to k but none are in use today.[tpl]sfn|Wagman|2003|p=74[/tpl]  John Flamsteed numbered thirty one stars, with 3 Canis Majoris being placed by Lacaille into Columba as Delta Columbae (Flamsteed had not recognised Columba as a distinct constellation).[tpl]sfn|Wagman|2003|p=368[/tpl] He also labelled two stars—his 10 and 13 Canis Majoris—as Kappa1 and Kappa2 respectively, but subsequent cartographers such as Francis Baily and John Bevis dropped the fainter former star, leaving Kappa2 as the sole Kappa.[tpl]sfn|Wagman|2003|p=73[/tpl] Flamsteed's listing of Nu1, Nu2, Nu3, Xi1, Xi2, Omicron1 and Omicron2 have all remained in use.[tpl]sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=73-74[/tpl]
Canis Major is a prominent constellation because of its many bright stars. These include Sirius (Alpha Canis Majoris), the brightest star in the night sky, as well as three other stars above magnitude 2.0.[tpl]sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99[/tpl] Furthermore, two other stars are thought to have previously outshone all others in the night sky—Adhara (Epsilon Canis Majoris) shone at -3.99 around 4.7 million years ago, and Mirzam (Beta Canis Majoris) peaked at −3.65 around 4.42 million years ago, and another—NR Canis Majoris—will be brightest at magnitude −0.88 in about 2.87 million years' time.[tpl]cite journal|last=Tomkin|first=Jocelyn|date=April 1998|title=Once and Future Celestial Kings|journal=Sky and Telescope|volume=95|issue=4|pages=59–63|bibcode=1998S&T....95d..59T[/tpl]
At magnitude −1.44, Sirius is one of the closest stars to Earth at a distance of 8.6 light-years. Its name comes from the Greek word for "scorching" or "searing". It is a variable star, with a variation of approximately 0.1 magnitude; this variability was discovered by the Hipparcos satellite. Sirius is also a binary star; its companion is called Sirius B, which has a magnitude of 8.4. The two orbit each other every 50 years. Their closest approach last occurred in 1993 and they will be at their greatest separation between 2020 and 2025. Sirius was the basis for the ancient Egyptian calendar.[tpl]sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99[/tpl] The star is marked the Great Dog's mouth on Bayer's star atlas.[tpl]sfn|Wagman|2003|p=504[/tpl]
Flanking Sirius are Beta and Gamma Canis Majoris. Also called Mirzam or Murzim, Beta is a blue-white Beta Cephei variable star of magnitude 2.0, which varies by a few hundredths of a magnitude over a period of six hours.[tpl]cite web| first1=James B. | last1=Kaler | title=Mirzam | work=Stars | publisher=University of Illinois | url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/mirzam.html | accessdate=2 January 2012 |date=4 May 2007[/tpl] Mirzam is 500 light-years from Earth, and its traditional name means "the announcer", referring to its position as the "announcer" of Sirius, as it rises a few minutes before Sirius does.[tpl]sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99[/tpl] Gamma, also known as Muliphein, is a fainter star of magnitude 4.12, in reality a blue-white bright giant of spectral type B8IIe located 441 light years from earth.[tpl]cite web |url = http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=Gamma+CMa&NbIdent=1&Radius=2&Radius.unit=arcmin&submit=submit+id |title = Gamma Canis Majoris - Star in Cluster |work = SIMBAD Astronomical Database|publisher=Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg |accessdate = 16 February 2014[/tpl] Iota Canis Majoris, lying between Sirius and Gamma, is another star that has been classified Beta Cephei variable, varying from magnitude 4.36 to 4.40 over a period of 1.92 hours.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&oid=5507 |title=Iota Canis Majoris |author =Watson, Christopher |date=4 January 2010 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=2 March 2014[/tpl] However it is a remote blue-white supergiant of spectral type B3Ib, around 46,000 times as luminous as the sun and, at 2500 light-years distant, 300 times further away than Sirius.[tpl]cite web| first1=James B. | last1=Kaler | title=Iota Canis Majoris | work=Stars | publisher=University of Illinois | url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/iotacma.html |date=26 February 2010 | accessdate=2 March 2014[/tpl]

Only around 10 million years old, Wezen has stopped fusing hydrogen in its core. Its outer envelope is beginning to expand and cool, and in the next 100,000 years it will become a red supergiant as its core fuses heavier and heavier elements.
