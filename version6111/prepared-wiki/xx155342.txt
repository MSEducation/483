==Overview==

The song itself actually has nothing to do with the Dragon Ball universe, but rather, it is a love ballad about a person who confesses their love for their significant other.
The lyrics were written by Zard lead singer Izumi Sakai, but the Field of View version was recorded and released first. Zard would go on to release a version of the song on their 1996 album Today Is Another Day.

On March 10, 2010 Shoko Nakagawa released a version of the song along with a cover to another Dragon Ball song, "Detekoi Tobikiri Zenkai Power", on her cover album Shoko-tan Cover 3.[tpl]cite AV media notes |title= Dan Dan Kokoro Hikareteku|others= Shoko Nakagawa|date= 2010|title= Shoko-tan Cover 3: Anison ni Ai wo Komete!!|last= Sakai|first= Izumi|type= CD|publisher= Sony Music Entertainment|id= SRCL-7220 SRCL-7218|location= Japan|language= Japanese[/tpl][tpl]cite AV media notes |title= Detekoi Tobikiri Zenkai Power|others= Shoko Nakagawa|date= 2010|title= Shoko-tan Cover 3: Anison ni Ai wo Komete!!|last= Sakai|first= Izumi|type= CD|publisher= Sony Music Entertainment|id= SRCL-7220 SRCL-7218|location= Japan|language= Japanese[/tpl]
