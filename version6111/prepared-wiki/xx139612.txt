==Railway==

The Opua Branch, a branch line railway sometimes considered part of the North Auckland Line, formerly served the town.  The first railway link, from Opua to Kawakawa, opened on 7 April 1884.  When the North Auckland Line was completed in 1925, a thrice weekly passenger express train called the Northland Express operated directly to Opua from Auckland.  In November 1956, this was replaced by a railcar service run by RM class 88 seaters, but this service terminated at the other northern terminus, Okaihau on the Okaihau Branch.  Opua passengers thus had to use mixed trains that carried freight as well as passengers; these trains ceased on 18 June 1976 when the line became freight-only.  As Opua's use as a commercial port declined, so did the freight traffic on the railway, and it was last used in 1985.Geoffrey B. Churchman and Tony Hurst, Railways of New Zealand: A Journey Through History (Auckland: HarperCollins, 1991), 100.  The line was then leased to the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway, who operated tourist services between Opua and Kawakawa until 2001, when the Land Transport Safety Authority withdrew the line's operating licence.  Part of the line in Opua is now on private land, and restoration is proceeding, with the vintage railway trustBay of Islands Vintage Railway, accessed 21 January 2010. formed in 2006 about halfway towards that goal at the beginning of 2010.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10619147|title=Pioneer route back on track|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=9 January 2010|first=Geoff|last=Cumming[/tpl]
