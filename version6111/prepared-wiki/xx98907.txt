Lyttelton (Māori: Ōhinehou) is a port town on the north shore of Lyttelton Harbour close to Banks Peninsula, a suburb of Christchurch, on the eastern coast of the South Island of New Zealand.
Due to its establishment as a landing point for Christchurch-bound seafarers, Lyttelton has historically been regarded as the "Gateway to Canterbury" for colonial settlers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Gov13_10Rail-t1-body-d11.htm|title=The Railways Magazine: Lyttelton—The Gateway to Canterbury: An Historic Harbour|publisher=New Zealand Government Railways Department, Wellington|author=D.
