Spades is a trick-taking card game devised in the United States in the 1930s. It can be played as either a partnership or solo/"cutthroat" game. The object is to take at least the number of tricks (also known as "books") that were bid before play of the hand began.Spades Rules In partnership Spades, the bids and tricks taken are combined for a partnership. Spades is a descendant of the Whist family of card games, which also includes Bridge, Hearts, and Oh Hell. Its major difference as compared to other Whist variants is that, instead of trump being decided by the highest bidder or at random, the Spade suit is always trump, hence the name.Spades on HowStuffWorks.com

==History==

Spades was devised in the United States in the late 1930s and became popular in the 1940s.Spades rules on Pagat.comMindzine - Spades History and Evolution It is unclear which game it is most directly descended from, but it is known that Spades is a member of the Whist family and is a simplification of Contract Bridge such that a skilled Spades player can learn Bridge relatively quickly (the major additional rules being dynamic trump, the auction, dummy play, and rubber scoring).
The game's rise to popularity in the U.S. came during World War II, when it was introduced by soldiers from its birthplace in Cincinnati, Ohio to various military stations around the world. The game's popularity in the armed forces stems from its simplicity compared to Bridge and Euchre and the fact that it can be more easily interrupted than Poker, all of which were also popular military card games. After the war, veterans brought the game back home to the U.S., where due to the GI Bill it spread to and became popular among college students as well as in home games. It also remained widely popular in countries in which U.S. troops were stationed, both in WWII and later deployments.

==General overview==

==Gameplay==

===The Deal===

The first dealer is chosen by a draw for "first spade" or "high card", and thereafter the deal passes to the dealer's left after each hand. The dealer shuffles, and the player to the right is given the opportunity to "cut" the cards to prevent the dealer stacking the deck. The entire deck is then dealt face-down one card at a time in clockwise order (with four players, each player should receive 13 cards). The players then pick up their cards, verify the correct count of the cards, and arrange them as desired (the most common arrangement is by suit, then rank).

===Bidding===

Each player bids the number of tricks he expects to take. The player to the left of the dealer starts the bidding and bidding continues in a clockwise direction, ending with the dealer. As Spades are always trump, no trump suit is named during bidding as with some other variants. A bid of "zero" is not allowed; the player must either bid at least one, or may bid "nil" (see below).
In partnership Spades, the standard rule is that the bids by each member of the partnership are added together.

====Blind and Nil Bidding====

Two very common variants of bidding are for a player or partnership to bid "blind", without having looked at their cards, or to bid "nil", stating that they will not take a single trick during play of the hand. These bids give the partnership a bonus if the player exactly meets their bid, but penalizes them if the players takes more or fewer. A combined bid of "blind nil" is usually allowed, and is worth both the blind and nil bonuses or penalties. In some variants, the player bidding nil passes some number of his cards to his partner and the partner passes an equal number of her cards back in what is considered "nil passing".  The common rule is no cards are passed for a regular nil but one or two cards are passed (depending on the variant) for blind nil since if the blind nil player gets the ace of spades, it is impossible for them to make nil.

===Game play===

Each hand consists of a number of tricks (the 4-handed game contains 13 tricks using all 52 cards). The player on the dealer's left makes the opening lead by playing a single card of their choice. Players in clockwise fashion then play a card of their choice; they must follow suit, if they can, otherwise they may play any card, including a trump Spade. Once a card has left the hand of a player, it stands and cannot be retrieved unless the player who threw the card makes an effort to correct his mistake before the next player lays down a card.
A common variant rule, borrowed from Hearts, is that a player may not lead Spades until a Spade has been played to trump another trick. This prevents a player who is "long" in Spades (having a large number of them) from leading Spades one after the other at the beginning of the hand to deplete them and thus prevent other players using them as trumps. The act of playing the first Spade in a hand is known as "breaking Spades", derived from its parent rule, "breaking Hearts".
Another common variant rule, also borrowed from Hearts, is that a player cannot lead Spades in the first trick.
The trick is won or taken by the player who played the highest value card; if one or more trumps were played the highest trump card wins, otherwise the highest card of the suit led wins. The player who wins the trick gathers the cards up into a face-down arrangement that allows players to count the number of tricks taken. The contents of each trick can not be viewed after this point, except to determine whether a player reneged (played an off-suit card including trumps when they could have and thus should have followed suit). The number of tricks a player has won cannot be disguised, if asked each player must count out their tricks until everyone has agreed on their "trick count". The player who wins any given trick leads the next. Play continues until all players have exhausted their hands, which should occur on the same (last) trick. Otherwise, it is a misdeal.

====Reneging====

A partnership reneges on their contract if they violate the rules of play; most often this happens when a player plays off-suit when they could have, and therefore should have, followed suit. The penalty for reneging varies; in most cases it nullifies that team's contract (the team cannot make their contract and their score is reduced by 10 points for each bid trick), while sometimes reneging results in a three-trick penalty, meaning the team may still make contract but must take three additional tricks to do so. It does not matter if the player reneges on purpose. The bags still count against the opposing team, and will go against their points. On the other-hand if a team calls reneg and that team cannot prove or call out the hand that was a potential reneg, then the team that called out the false accusation is penalized the three-trick penalty.

====The Rest Are Mine (TRAM)====

A common play among more experienced or skilled players is for a player who realizes that they cannot help but win all remaining tricks to simply lay down their hand and declare "the rest are mine" or similar. This is known as "TRAMing", and can help speed play of the game. An obvious situation in which a player could "TRAM" is if, with three tricks left to play, the leading player sees that they hold the AKQ[tpl]Spades[/tpl]. No matter which card they play, no other player will be able to beat that card (as the player holds the only cards that can), and the same will be true for the next two tricks. Usually, situations in which TRAMing is appropriate are less clear-cut, and involve keeping track of the cards that have been played to determine whether any player could beat a particular card.
A player who TRAMs when it is possible for another player to win at least one trick is penalized either by having to play the remainder of the hand with their cards exposed, by forfeiting all remaining tricks (at the discretion of the player who would otherwise take the trick, to prevent intentional false TRAMing that would give the player an advantage), or by forfeiting their bid (the hand will be scored as if that player failed to make their bid regardless of the number of tricks they take). It is always acceptable for players to play the remainder of tricks normally, even if they are positive they will take all remaining tricks.

===Scoring===

Once the final trick is played, the hand is then scored. Many variants for scoring exist; what follows is the basic method.

====Contract score====

Once a hand is completed, the players count the number of tricks they took and, in the case of partnerships or teams, the members' trick counts are summed to form a team count.
Each player's or team's trick count is then compared to their contract. If the player or team made at least the number of tricks bid, 10 points for each bid trick are awarded (a bid of 5 would earn 50 points if made). If a team did not make their contract, they were "set", and 10 points for each bid trick are deducted from the team's score (e.g.: six bid and any number less than six taken results in minus 60 points).
If a player/team took more tricks than they bid, a single point is scored for each overtrick, called an "overtrick", "bag" or "sandbag" (a bid of 5 tricks with 6 tricks taken results in a score of 51 points).

====Bonuses or penalties====

To this contract score, players add bonuses earned and subtract penalties assessed based on whether the player successfully did or failed to do any of the more specific things they said they would in the bidding phase. Many variants exist that award or penalize according to certain behaviors; they are covered below. For the basic Nil and blind bids, points are awarded as follows:
Though some variant bonuses or penalties are based on the contract score, normally a bonus or penalty does not affect and is not affected by any other bonus or penalty, or the contract score. As a result, a partnership can have a net positive score even if they failed to make their contract. For instance, if one player successfully made a Nil bid, but their partner bid 5 tricks and only took 4 tricks, the partnership still gets the bonus which is represented as −50 points + 100 points = 50 points. Conversely, a partnership can have a net negative score in much the same way; if a player failed a nil bid but the partnership bid and took 5 tricks, the net score is −50 points.
If a Nil bid is set, most tournament rules dictate that the overtricks are counted as bags and do not count towards the partner's bid.http://boardgames.about.com/od/spades/a/spades_rules.htmhttp://www.pagat.com/boston/spades.html#scoringhttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-gaming/internet-spades-scoring-system-has-changed-for-the/27288c82-84ff-4065-962e-9a18c07ae4cehttp://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows7/internet-spades-how-to-playhttp://www.sjaacsa.org/spades.htmhttp://www.grandprixtournaments.com/sections/rules/spades.htmhttp://www.hoylegaming.com/rules/showrule.aspx?RuleID=227

====Sandbags and bagging out====

An extremely common scoring variant is designed to penalize players for underestimating the number of tricks they will take, while at the same time not removing the possible strategy of intentionally taking overtricks, or "bags", in order to "set" the other team. This is accomplished by keeping track of bags in the ones place on the scorecard, and assessing a 100 point penalty when 10 bags are accumulated and the ones place rolls over.
For example, if a team's bid is 5 tricks and they take 8 tricks, the score for the hand is 53 points. If the team's total score before this hand had a first digit of 7 or more, for instance 108, the team has "bagged out" or been "sandbagged"; the hand's score is added to the total and then 100 points are deducted. In the example, the score would be 61 points after the penalty. The 10 bags could be considered to make the penalty 90 points (the penalty can instead be 110 points to offset this, or the ones' place can simply not be carried when adding). Anything over 10 sandbags is retained in the first digit and count towards future overtricks; a player or team can bag out multiple times in a game.Spades - Card Game Rules - About.com

====Keeping score====

One of the players is the scorer and has written the bids down, so that during the play and for the scoring afterward, this information will be available to all the players. When a hand is over, the scores should be recorded next to the bids. Alternatively, the scorer can turn the bid into the contract score by writing in the number of bags (zero if there were none) behind the bid, and a minus sign before it if the team was set, then add bonuses and subtract penalties beneath. A running score should be kept so that players can readily see each other's total points.

===Winning===

The most common condition is the first to reach 500 points, or forcing the opposing team to drop to −200 points. Alternatively, the game could be played for a fixed number of hands or a fixed time limit; with four players, eight hands can generally be played in about an hour. If there is a tie, then all players participate in (at least) one more round of play until a winner is decided.

==Game variations==

As with any widely played game of such a flexible nature, Spades has many variations, ranging from significant changes in gameplay to small tweaks that suit individual or household preference.

===Deal variations===

===Bidding variations===

One variant, borrowed from the related game Oh, hell, is that the sum of all bids must not equal the number of tricks to be played. This ensures that at least one player or team will be set or "bagged" (forced to take an overtrick). Another game variation allows each player to optionally increase their bid by one point after all players have bid but before game play starts. A reduction in bid, once bids are made, is never allowed.

===Trump variations===

===Gameplay variations===

Aces High/Low:
During the play Aces can be called high or low.  These are especially valuable cards in 3B-Spades scoring version where there is an immediate penalty for taking extra tricks.
During bidding, a team may declare either Big Mo or Little Mo, meaning they intend to take the first several tricks.  This is the only time that cross-talk during the bidding is allowed.  A player considering a Mo may ask his teammate "How many do you have on the Mo?" or some similar question to determine how many tricks the teammate can contribute to the Mo without revealing any details as to which tricks they'll take.  The only detail that can be discussed is which teammate will be leading the first trick but not how they will be leading.  If a team declares Little Mo, they must take the first 7 tricks of the hand.  Accomplishing the Little Mo earns the team 150 points.  If a team declares Big Mo, they must take the first 10 tricks of the hand.  Accomplishing the Big Mo earns the team 250 points.  Taking more consecutive tricks than needed does not earn the team more points.  For instance, taking the first 10 tricks when a Little Mo had been declared still only earns the team 150 points.  The team that declares either Mo is immune to bags for that hand and will lead the first trick, regardless of whose turn it was to lead.  Failure to accomplish the declared Mo (the opposing team took a trick before the goal was met) will cause the team to lose the points they would have earned had they been successful.  This is true regardless of how many tricks they took before or after the opposing team took a trick.  The other team bids and must match their bid, as usual.  It's not unusual for a team that could do a Big Mo to declare a Little Mo to play it safe and then take the extra tricks to try to set their opponents.
Nil
A team that declares Nil is intending to lose every trick.  If successful, the team earns 100 points.  If the team takes a single trick, they will lose 100 points.  A team that declares Nil is immune to bags for that hand.
Blind Nil
A team may declare Blind Nil as long as neither teammate has looked at any of their cards.  After bidding has been set, all players can look at their cards like normal.  Like Nil, the team intends to lose every trick.  If successful, the team earns 150 points.  If the team takes a single trick, they will lose 150 points.  A team that declares Blind Nil is immune to bags for that hand.

===Scoring variations===

===Number of players===

Traditionally Spades is played with four players in two partnerships. However, there are variations that allow for greater or fewer players. Partnerships are optional even with four players. All other rules should be agreed upon beforehand by the players.

There are a few varieties of Spades. A similar called Ghahveh  is played in Iran and might be descended from Spades.[tpl]cite web|last=McLeod|first=John|title=Card games in Iran|url=http://www.pagat.com/national/iran.html|accessdate=12 April 2013[/tpl]
Another versions is Tarneeb, played in the Arab countries. The main alteration between the two is that Tarneeb uses all four suits, not just Spades, therefore the game may be considered a variation of Whist. Tarneeb, (Arabic: طرنيب) means "trump".[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
