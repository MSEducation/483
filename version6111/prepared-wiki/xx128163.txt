Throughout the league's history, the only club from the first ever season to continue in an unbroken existence are Rowntrees (now known as Nestlé Rowntree). However, Bishopthorpe United, Easingwold Town and St. Clements are at present still playing in the York League system, after refounding at various points.
Acomb and Rowntrees (along with fellow league team, York YMCA) also went on to become founding members of the Yorkshire League for the 1920–21 season.FCHD.co.uk 
Some teams from the York League have climbed the football ladder in the past; Pickering Town played in the league before gaining promotion in 1972. They are currently in the Northern Counties East Premier Division. Also, York Railway Institute and Rowntrees have been crowned champions of the Northern Counties East League Division One during the 1980s.
