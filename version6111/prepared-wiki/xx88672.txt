Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is a statistical method for generating a sample of plausible collections of parameter values from a multidimensional distribution. The sampling method is often used to construct computer experiments.
The LHS was described by McKay in 1979. An independently equivalent technique has been proposed by Eglājs in 1977.[tpl]cite journal|last=Eglajs|first=V.|coauthors=Audze P.|title=New approach to the design of multifactor experiments|journal=Problems of Dynamics and Strengths|year=1977|series=35|pages=104–107|publisher=Zinatne Publishing House|location=Riga|language=Russian[/tpl]   It was further elaborated by Ronald L. Iman, and others[tpl]cite journal |last=Iman |first=R.L. |coauthors=Helton, J.C.; and Campbell, J.E. |title=An approach to sensitivity analysis of computer models, Part 1.

Detailed computer codes and manuals were later published.[tpl]cite book |last=Iman |first=R.L. |coauthors=Davenport, J.M. ; Zeigler, D.K. |title=Latin hypercube sampling (program user's guide) |year=1980 |osti=5571631[/tpl]
In the context of statistical sampling, a square grid containing sample positions is a Latin square if (and only if) there is only one sample in each row and each column. A Latin hypercube is the generalisation of this concept to an arbitrary number of dimensions, whereby each sample is the only one in each axis-aligned hyperplane containing it.
Orthogonal sampling adds the requirement that the entire sample space must be sampled evenly. Although more efficient, orthogonal sampling strategy is more difficult to implement since all random samples must be generated simultaneously.
In two dimensions the difference between random sampling, Latin Hypercube sampling and orthogonal sampling can be explained as follows:
Thus, orthogonal sampling ensures that the ensemble of random numbers is a very good representative of the real variability, LHS ensures that the ensemble of random numbers is representative of the real variability whereas traditional random sampling (sometimes called brute force) is just an ensemble of random numbers without any guarantees.
