[[Wingspan]]

CATEGORIES: Aerospace engineering, Aircraft wing design, Ornithological terminology, Length, Anatomical terminology

The wingspan (or just span) of an airplane or a bird, is the distance from one wingtip to the other wingtip. For example, the Boeing 777 has a wingspan of about [tpl]convert|60|m|ft|0[/tpl]; and a Wandering Albatross (Diomedea exulans) caught in 1965 had a wingspan of [tpl]convert|3.63|m|ftin[/tpl], the official record for a living bird.
The term wingspan, more technically extent, is also used for other winged animals such as pterosaurs, bats, insects, etc., and other fixed-wing aircraft such as ornithopters.

==Wingspan of aircraft==

The wingspan of an aircraft is always measured in a straight line, from wingtip to wingtip, independently of wing shape or sweep.

===Implications for aircraft design and animal evolution===

The lift from wings is proportional to their area, so the heavier the animal or aircraft the bigger that area must be.  The area is the product of the span times the width (mean chord) of the wing, so either a long, narrow wing or a shorter, broader wing will support the same mass.  For efficient steady flight, the ratio of span to chord, the aspect ratio, should be as high as possible (the constraints are usually structural) because this lowers the lift-induced drag associated with the inevitable wingtip vortices. Long-ranging birds, like albatrosses, and most commercial aircraft maximize aspect ratio.  Alternatively, animals and aircraft which depend on maneuverability (fighters, predators and the predated, and those who live amongst trees and bushes, insect catchers, etc.) need to be able to roll fast to turn, and the high moment of inertia of long narrow wings produces lower roll rates.  For them, short-span, broad wings are preferred.
The highest aspect ratio man-made wings are aircraft propellers, in their most extreme form as helicopter rotors.

==Wingspan of flying animals==

To measure the wingspan of a bird, a live or freshly-dead specimen is placed flat on its back, the wings are grasped at the wrist joints, ankles and the distance is measured between the tips of the longest primary feathers on each wing.[tpl]Clarify| reason=Not sure what is meant by "wrist joints,ankles" I added a space: one or the other? both? does a bird's wing have "ankles" or "wrists" anyway?| date=September 2011[/tpl]
The wingspan of an insect refers to the wingspan of pinned specimens, and may refer to the distance between the centre of the thorax to the apex of the wing doubled or to the width between the apices with the wings set with the trailing wing edge perpendicular to the body.

==Armspan in sports==

In basketball and gridiron football, a fingertip-to-fingertip measurement is used to determine the player's armspan. This is called reach in boxing terminology.  The wingspan of 16-year-old BeeJay Anya, a top basketball Junior Class of 2013 prospect, was officially measured at 7 feet, 9 inches across, one of the longest of all National Basketball Association draft prospects.[tpl]cite web|last=Smith |first=Cameron |url=http://rivals.yahoo.com/highschool/blog/prep_rally/post/Top-junior-hoops-prospect-may-have-longest-wings?urn=highschool-wp2931 |title=High school basketball playerâ€™s stunning wingspan |publisher=Yahoo Sports! |date=June 17, 2013 |accessdate=October 7, 2013[/tpl] The arm span of Manute Bol, at [tpl]convert|8|ft|6|in|m[/tpl], is (as of 2013) the longest in NBA history, and his reach was [tpl]convert|10|ft|5|in|m[/tpl].[tpl]cite news|last=Schudel|first=Matt |title=Manute Bol, former Washington Bullet and one of NBA's tallest players, dies at 47|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/19/AR2010061902214.html|accessdate=19 June 2010|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=19 June 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title = Former NBA player Manute Bol to speak at Union |publisher = Union College |date = Nov 3, 2008 |url = http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=8105 |accessdate = 2012-12-08 [/tpl]
