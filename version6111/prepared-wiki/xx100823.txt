==History==

Israir Airlines was established in 1989 as Knafei HaEmek (Valley Wings) before changing its name to Israir Airlines in 1996. It is now wholly owned by the Ganden Group.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.vclocator.com/Venture-Capital/06831/Ganden-Group.html | title=Ganden Group Venture Capital Profile | accessdate=2007-05-08[/tpl] The airline began with domestic services from Eilat Airport, Ben Gurion International Airport, Sde Dov Airport, and Haifa Airport in the north of the country. It expanded its operations to begin international charter flights in 1999, building up a route network that now covers much of Europe, as well as regularly flying to other destinations in Asia, Africa, and North America.
The airline expanded operations across the Atlantic when regular charter service to New York City's Kennedy International Airport was started in June 2004 [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]. Permission was granted to the airline to convert this to regular scheduled service by the Israeli government and the FAA on May 1, 2006.[tpl]cite web | url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/sky/2006/01/more_competitio.html | title=More competition between Israel, New York | accessdate=2007-05-06 | publisher=USA Today |last =Mutzabaugh| first=Ben| date=2006-06-17[/tpl] This service was discontinued in September 2008, due to escalating fuel prices and the expectation of a drop in the number of passengers due to the weakness of the dollar at the time.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000369305&fid=942 | title=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000369305&fid=942 | accessdate=2008-08-08  | publisher=Globes | date=2008-08-06[/tpl]
In early 2007, the airline announced plans to introduce Sky-Torah scrolls on each of its aircraft.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/12-27-2006/0004497075&EDATE= | title= Israir Airlines Introduces the 'Sky-Torah' | accessdate=2007-05-05  | publisher=PR Newswire | date=2006-12-27[/tpl] These were effectively Torah scrolls which would be carried on board its flight for Jewish passengers to use for prayer. This is a first for any Israeli airline and was seen by many as a means to attract many Haredi passengers to the airline at a time when they were showing great dissatisfaction with arch-rival, El Al, following their flying of aircraft on the Shabbat.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bizbuzzmedia.com/blogs/airline/archive/2007/1/3.aspx | title=Flying Torah | work=Airline Business | date=2007-01-03 | accessdate=2007-07-20[/tpl] Later on in 2007, an Israir passenger announced he was filing a lawsuit against the airline for misadvertising the legroom they offered on their aircraft.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/859006.html | title=Customer files lawsuit against Israir Airlines over reduced legroom | accessdate=2007-05-12 | publisher=Haaretz | date=2007-05-13 | first=Carmel | last=Ben-Zur[/tpl]
In early 2008, when restrictions were lifted on Israeli airlines' destinations, Israir applied for designated carrier status on routes from Israel to London, Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Amsterdam, Rome, Budapest, Las Vegas, and Miami - some of which are destinations currently served by the airline as charter routes.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/DocView.asp?did=1000308362&fid=1725 | title=Israir seeks designated carrier status for US, European destinations | accessdate=2008-02-11 | date=2008-02-11 | publisher=Globes[/tpl]

After Israir was granted permission to operate scheduled service on the lucrative New York-Tel Aviv route, in spring of 2006 it entered talks with both Boeing and Airbus regarding the acquisition of new aircraft to its fleet and replacement of its existing jets [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]. The company was said to be in talks with Boeing over the 787 model.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2006-06-08-boeing-787_x.htm | title=Boeing near decision on 787 production capacity | publisher=USA Today | accessdate=2007-07-20 | date=2006-06-08[/tpl] It also signed a deal to acquire Airbus A320 aircraft.[tpl]cite web | url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1164881941980&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull | title=Israir Airlines to buy two Airbus A320s | first=Avi |last=Krawitz | publisher=The Jerusalem Post| accessdate=2007-07-20 | date=2006-12-21[/tpl] This was a significant milestone in Israeli aviation, as no airline had ever before purchased Airbus aircraft.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.port2port.com/Index.asp?CategoryID=44&ArticleID=1319 | title=Airbus marks first breakthrough in the Israeli market with Israir Airlines A320 order | accessdate=2007-05-06 | publisher=Port2Port | date=2007-04-23[/tpl] In April 2008, the airline received an Airbus A330 for its New York flights to replace the Boeing 767 aircraft it had previously been wet-leasing.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000324234&fid=1725 | work=Globes | accessdate=2008-03-20 | date=2008-03-20 | first=Dalia | last=Tal | title=Israir adds scheduled flights to New York[/tpl]  Israir no longer flies to New York.
Israir received the first of the two ATR 72 aircraft it had on order in early July 2011, with the second one expected to follow late in the month.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/07/12/359383/israir-takes-delivery-of-first-atr-72-500.html | title=Israir takes delivery of first ATR 72-500 | publisher=Flightglobal.com | date=12 June 2011 | accessdate=13 June 2011 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/609nyxfHJ | archivedate=13 July 2011[/tpl]
The ATR 72 replace the ATR 42.

==Incidents and accidents==

In June 2001, one of Israir's ATR 42-320 aircraft was damaged beyond repair following a heavy landing at Ben Gurion Airport. Despite the aircraft being written off, no passengers were injured in this incident.[tpl]cite web | url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20010618-0 | title=ASN Aircraft accident description | publisher=Aviation Safety Network | accessdate=2007-05-12[/tpl]
On July 6, 2005 a fully loaded Israir 767 accidentally taxied onto an active runway at JFK, and a Douglas DC-8 cargo aircraft narrowly avoided collision by taking off at full throttle above them, with only 45 feet of clearance over the 767.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/08/24/news/airport.php | title=N.Y. runway tapes reveal how jets nearly collided| publisher=International Herald Tribune | accessdate=2007-08-19 [/tpl] However, Israir pilots modified their incident reports to claim that the cargo plane had taken off beside the plane, rather than directly above [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl].  The pilots and several high-ranking Israir officials were dismissed in the scandal [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl].
In May 2007, an Israir Airlines aircraft on a test flight was almost shot down by Israeli F-16 jets after it entered a demarcation zone where airlines are expected to identify themselves.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/DocView.asp?did=1000195254&fid=1725 | title=Israir Airlines test flight nearly shot down by F16s | accessdate=2007-05-12 | publisher=Globes | date=2007-03-21[/tpl]
Later that month, on May 23, an Israir flight had to make an emergency landing following smoke build up in the cabin on approach at Berlin-Schönefeld International Airport. No one was injured in the incident.[tpl]cite web | url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1178708664275&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull | title=Israeli plane makes emergency landing | accessdate=2007-05-24 | publisher=The Jerusalem Post | date=2007-05-23[/tpl]
In July 2008, an Israir Airlines aircraft flew from Eilat Airport to Ben Gurion International Airport with a small hole in its frame. The hole was discovered by mechanics at Ben Gurion and there is an ongoing probe as to whether or not Israir knew of the hole, which, as it turns out, was caused by Israir workers in Eilat when they crashed a mobile staircase into the aircraft's body. The plane was scheduled to fly to Italy from Tel Aviv, and at an altitude of over 10,000 feet, the plane would most likely have experienced a decompression, possibly explosive, and could have resulted in injuries or fatalities.
