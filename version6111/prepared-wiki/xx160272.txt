==Opening==

Perimeter Mall opened in 1971 and was the fourth mall to open in DeKalb County, after Columbia Mall in 1964, North DeKalb Mall in 1965, and South DeKalb Mall in 1968. Its original anchor stores were Rich's and JC Penney, which made it very similar in design and layout to Greenbriar Mall. Perimeter Mall was the first mall in metro Atlanta to be located outside of I-285.

==Expansions and renovations==

The mall was expanded in 1982 to add an additional wing that included a Davison's. This gave the mall a T shape. It was renovated in 1993, 1997[ref]*

Urban Shopping Centers sold the mall to The Rouse Company in 2002.  It was then sold to General Growth Properties in 2003.
Perimeter Mall is different from other shopping malls in Atlanta in that the front side of the mall includes an area for open-air shops, upscale restaurants, and salons, connected by gardens and paths. It also features valet parking. On January 4, 2012, Bloomingdale's announced that it would be closing its Perimeter location. Less than 24 hours later, Von Maur announced that it would be taking over the space and setting up its second location in Georgia at the mall.
