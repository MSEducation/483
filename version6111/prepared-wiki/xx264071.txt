Reuben Grigsby died on the estate on February 6, 1863. Son Lucien Porter Grigsby (1820–1893), was the last Grigsby to own the farm. The estate was broken up in 1874 with some going to various daughters. In 1878 the house was sold to settle Lucien's debts, and passed through a number of owners. On June 10, 1929, it was purchased  by Robert Rutherford "Colonel" McCormick (1880–1955), and Chauncey McCormick (1884–1954), cousins who were great grandsons of Reuben Grigsby.
The main house is constructed in the Federal architecture style from Flemish bond brick with three integrated chimneys. The south side has a two-story portico with Doric columns.
