==History==

In March 1881, after heavy lobbying by Los Angeles residents, the California State Legislature authorized the creation of a southern branch of the California State Normal School (which later became San Jose State University) in downtown Los Angeles to train teachers for the growing population of Southern California. The State Normal School at Los Angeles opened on August 29, 1882, on what is now the site of the Central Library of the Los Angeles Public Library system. The new facility included an elementary school where teachers-in-training could practice their teaching technique on children. That elementary school is related to the present day version, UCLA Lab School. In 1887, the school became known as the Los Angeles State Normal School.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/UCHistory/general_history/campuses/ucla/overview.html |title=(UC) Los Angeles: Historical Overview |accessdate=2006-06-20 |author=Hamilton, Andrew |date=2004-06-18 |work=University of California History, Digital Archives (from Berkeley) [/tpl]
In 1914,  the school moved to a new campus on Vermont Avenue (now the site of Los Angeles City College) in East Hollywood. In 1917, UC Regent Edward Augustus Dickson, the only regent representing the Southland at the time, and Ernest Carroll Moore, Director of the Normal School, began working together to lobby the State Legislature to enable the school to become the second University of California campus, after UC Berkeley. They met resistance from UC Berkeley alumni, Northern California members of the state legislature, and Benjamin Ide Wheeler, President of the University of California from 1899 to 1919, who were all vigorously opposed to the idea of a southern campus.  However, David Prescott Barrows, the new President of the University of California, did not share Wheeler's objections. On May 23, 1919, the Southern Californians' efforts were rewarded when Governor William D. Stephens signed Assembly Bill 626 into law, which merged the Los Angeles Normal School with the University of California as the Southern Branch of the University of California.  The same legislation added its general undergraduate program, the College of Letters and Science.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.library.ucla.edu/libraries/special/scweb/archives.htm |title=UCLA University Archives |accessdate=2006-06-20 |date=2007-01-20 |work=UCLA Library |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615035434/http://www.library.ucla.edu/libraries/special/scweb/archives.htm  |archivedate = 2006-06-15[/tpl] The Southern Branch campus opened on September 15 of that year, offering two-year undergraduate programs to 250 Letters and Science students and 1,250 students in the Teachers College, under Moore's continued direction.
Under University of California President William Wallace Campbell, enrollment at the Southern Branch expanded so rapidly that by the mid-1920s the institution was outgrowing the 25 acre Vermont Avenue location. The Regents conducted a search for a new location and announced their selection of the so-called "Beverly Site"—just west of Beverly Hills—on March 21, 1925 edging out the panoramic hills of the still-empty Palos Verdes Peninsula.  After the athletic teams entered the Pacific Coast conference in 1926, the Southern Branch student council adopted the nickname "Bruins," a name offered by the student council at UC Berkeley.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ulwaf.com/Daily-Bruin-History/03_Birth.html |title=The Daily Bruin Is Born |accessdate=2006-07-03 |author=Garrigues, George |year=2001 |work=Loud Bark and Curious Eyes, A History of the UCLA Daily Bruin, 1919–1955 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060528022042/http://ulwaf.com/Daily-Bruin-History/03_Birth.html |archivedate = May 28, 2006[/tpl] In 1927, the Regents renamed the Southern Branch the "University of California at Los Angeles" (the word "at" was officially replaced by a comma in 1958, in line with other UC campuses).  In the same year, the state broke ground in Westwood on land sold for $1 million, less than one-third its value, by real estate developers Edwin and Harold Janss, for whom the Janss Steps are named.
The original four buildings were the College Library, Royce Hall, the Physics-Biology Building, and the Chemistry Building (now Powell Library, Royce Hall, the Humanities Building, and Haines Hall, respectively), arrayed around a quadrangular courtyard on the 400 acre (1.6 km²) campus. The first undergraduate classes on the new campus were held in 1929 with 5,500 students. In 1933, after further lobbying by alumni, faculty, administration and community leaders, UCLA was permitted to award the master's degree, and in 1936, the doctorate, against continued resistance from UC Berkeley.[tpl]cite web |url=http://alumni.ucla.edu/alumni-association/history/default.aspx |title=History: The Beginning | accessdate=2013-04-04 |author=UCLA Alumni |year=2012 |work=UCLA Alumni [/tpl]

===Maturity as a university===

UCLA was formally elevated to co-equal status with UC Berkeley in 1951, when Raymond B. Allen was named as its first chancellor.  Previously, the school's chief executive had been the provost. The appointment of Franklin David Murphy to the position of Chancellor in 1960 helped to spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. By the end of the decade, UCLA had achieved distinction in a wide range of subjects. This era also secured UCLA's position as a proper university in its own right and not simply a branch of the UC system. This change is exemplified by an incident involving Chancellor Murphy, which was described by him later on:
 "I picked up the telephone and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, 'University of California.' And I said, 'Is this Berkeley?' She said, 'No.' I said, 'Well, who have I gotten to?' 'UCLA.' I said, 'Why didn't you say UCLA?' 'Oh,' she said, 'we're instructed to say University of California.' So the next morning I went to the office and wrote a memo; I said, 'Will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, "UCLA."' And they said, 'You know they won't like it at Berkeley.' And I said, 'Well, let's just see. There are a few things maybe we can do around here without getting their permission.'"

==Campus==

When UCLA opened its new campus in 1929, it had four buildings: Royce Hall and Haines Hall on the north, and Powell Library and Kinsey Hall (now the Humanities Building) on the south. The Janss Steps were the original 87-step entrance to the university that lead directly to the quad of these four buildings. Today, the campus includes 163 buildings across 419 acres (1.7 km²) in the western part of Los Angeles, north of the Westwood shopping district and just south of Sunset Boulevard. In terms of acreage, it is the second smallest of the ten UC campuses. The campus is close but not adjacent to the 405 San Diego Freeway.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?latlongtype=internal&addtohistory=&latitude=%2fujp23Q4CoQyaX7fYDsWRA%3d%3d&longitude=8%2fGfpeQs3DIJqAXMypI90g%3d%3d&name=UNIVERSITY%20of%20California&country=US&address=405%20Hilgard%20Ave&city=Los%20Angeles&state=CA&zipcode=90095&phone=310%2d825%2d4321&spurl=0&&q=UCLA&qc=Colleges%20%26%20Universities |title=Map of University of California |accessdate=2007-05-29 |date=Current |work=Mapquest [/tpl]
The campus includes sculpture gardens, fountains, museums, and a mix of architectural styles. It is located in the residential area of Westwood and bordered by Bel-Air to the north, Beverly Hills to the east, and Brentwood to the west. The campus is informally divided into North Campus and South Campus, which are both on the eastern half of the university's land. North Campus is the original campus core; its buildings are more old-fashioned in appearance and clad in imported Italian brick. North Campus is home to the arts, humanities, social sciences, law, and business programs and is centered around ficus and sycamore-lined Dickson Court, also known as the "Sunken Garden." South Campus is home to the physical sciences, life sciences, engineering, psychology, mathematical sciences, health-related fields, and the UCLA Medical Center.
Ackerman Union, the John Wooden Center, the Arthur Ashe Health and Wellness Center, the Student Activities Center, Kerckhoff Hall, the J.D. Morgan Center, the James West Alumni Center, and Pauley Pavilion stand at the center of the campus, bordering Wilson Plaza. The campus is bisected by Bruin Walk, a heavily traveled pathway from the residential hill to the main campus. At the intersection of Bruin Walk and Westwood Boulevard is Bruin Plaza, featuring an outdoor performing arts stage and a bronze statue of the Bruin bear.

===Architecture===

The first campus buildings were designed by the local firm Allison & Allison. The Romanesque Revival style of these first four structures remained the predominant building style on campus until the 1950s, when architect Welton Becket was hired to supervise the expansion of the campus over the next two decades. Becket greatly streamlined the
general appearance of the campus, adding several rows of minimalist, slab–shaped brick buildings to the southern half of the campus, the largest of these being the UCLA Medical Center.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/cd/cm/?id=weltonbecketandassociates-losangeles-ca-usa |title=Welton Becket and Associates |accessdate=2007-05-29 |year=2007 |work=Emporis Buildings [/tpl] Architects such as A. Quincy Jones, William Pereira and Paul Williams designed many subsequent structures on the campus during the mid-20th century. More recent additions include buildings designed by architects I.M. Pei, Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, Richard Meier, Cesar Pelli, and Rafael Vinoly. In order to accommodate UCLA's rapidly growing student population, multiple construction and renovation projects are in progress, including expansions of the life sciences and engineering research complexes. This continuous construction gives UCLA the on-campus nickname of "Under Construction Like Always."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.today.ucla.edu/2004/041012closeup_senseofplace.html |title=A 'sense of place' from the old and new |accessdate=2007-05-29 |author=Lee, Cynthia |date=2004-10-12 |work=UCLA Today |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070128014442/http://www.today.ucla.edu/2004/041012closeup_senseofplace.html |archivedate = January 28, 2007[/tpl]
The tallest building on campus is named after African-American alumnus Ralph Bunche, who received the 1950 Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating an armistice agreement between the Jews and Arabs in Israel. A bust of him, on the entrance to Bunche Hall, overlooks the Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden. He was the first individual of non-European background and the first UCLA alumnus to be honored with the Prize.
The Hannah Carter Japanese Garden is located a mile from campus, in the community of Bel Air. The garden was designed by landscape architect Nagao Sakurai of Tokyo and garden designer Kazuo Nakamura of Kyoto in 1959. After the garden was damaged by heavy rains in 1969, UCLA Professor of Art and Campus Architect Koichi Kawana took on the task of its reconstruction.

===Filming===

With a location near Hollywood, UCLA has attracted filming for decades. Much of the 1985 film Gotcha! was shot at UCLA, as well as John Singleton's Higher Learning (1995). Legally Blonde (2001), Old School (2003), The Nutty Professor (1995), Erin Brockovich (2000), How High (2001), National Lampoon's Van Wilder (2002), American Pie 2 (2001), and Bring It On Again (2004) were all mainly shot at the university campus or locale. In January 2009, the Bollywood movie My Name is Khan was shot at UCLA. Some of the exterior shots of the fictional UC Sunnydale in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and ABC Family original series Greek were also filmed at UCLA. In response to the major demand for filming, UCLA instated a policy on filming and professional photography at the campus.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.adminvc.ucla.edu/appm/public/app_0863_0.html |title=UCLA Policy 863: Filming and Photography on Campus |accessdate=2007-05-21 |date=2004-01-23 |author=Morabito, Sam |work=UCLA Administrative Policies & Procedures Manual |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901090414/http://www.adminvc.ucla.edu/appm/public/app_0863_0.html |archivedate = September 1, 2006[/tpl]
"UCLA is located in Los Angeles, the same place as the American motion picture industry," said UCLA visiting professor of film and television Jonathan Kuntz.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tft.ucla.edu/faculty/facftv/index.cfm?action=showbio&alias=jkuntz&pagetype=blank |title=Jonathan Kuntz – Visiting Associate Professor |accessdate=2007-05-21 |year=2007 |work=UCLA School of Theater, Film, and Television [/tpl] "So we're convenient for (almost) all of the movie companies, TV production companies, commercial companies and so on.

==Academics==

===Healthcare===

The David Geffen School of Medicine, along with the School of Nursing, School of Dentistry, and Jonathan and Karin Fielding School of Public Health, constitute the professional schools of health science. The California NanoSystems Institute is another project that was created out of a partnership with UCSB to pioneer innovations in the field of nanotechnology.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cnsi.ucla.edu/staticpages/about-us |title=About CNSI |accessdate=2007-05-21 |year=2006 |work=California NanoSystems Institute [/tpl]
The Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center is a part of the larger UCLA Health System, which also operates a hospital in Santa Monica and twelve primary care clinics throughout Los Angeles County. In addition, the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine uses two Los Angeles County public hospitals as teaching hospitals—Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Olive View-UCLA Medical Center—as well as the largest private nonprofit hospital on the west coast, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
In 1981, the UCLA Medical Center made history when an assistant professor named Michael Gottlieb first diagnosed an unknown affliction later to be called AIDS. UCLA medical researchers also pioneered the use of PET scanning to study brain function. The signaling cascade of nitric oxide, one of the most important molecules in cardiopulmonary physiology was discovered in part by the medical school's Professor of Pharmacology Louis J. Ignarro. For this, he was awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with two other researchers – Robert F. Furchgott of the SUNY Health Science Center and Ferid Murad of the University of Texas Medical School at Houston.
In the 2013 edition of U.S. News and World Report, UCLA Medical Center was ranked "Best in the West", as well as one of the top five hospitals in the United States. In 13 of the 15 medical specialty areas examined, UCLA Medical Center ranked in the top 20.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uclahealth.org/body.cfm?id=18 |title=UCLA Health System's hospitals ranked among nation's best in U.S. News' annual survey |accessdate=2014-02-16 |year=2013 |work=UCLA Health System[/tpl]

===Library system===

UCLA's library system has over nine million books and 70,000 serials spread over twelve libraries and eleven other archives, reading rooms, and research centers.

The first library, University Library (presently Powell Library), was founded in 1884. In 1910, Elizabeth Fargo became the university's first librarian. Lawrence Powell became librarian in 1944, and began a series of system overhauls and modifications, and in 1959, he was named Dean of the School of Library Service.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.library.ucla.edu/special/scweb/lcpintro.htm |title=A Tribute to Lawrence Clark Powell |accessdate=2006-12-13 |year=2006 |work=UCLA Library |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051217020308/http://www.library.ucla.edu/special/scweb/lcpintro.htm |archivedate = December 17, 2005[/tpl] More libraries were added as previous ones filled.

High demand for UCLA apparel has inspired the licensing of its trademark to UCLA brand stores throughout Europe, Middle East and Asia.

==Athletics==

The school's sports teams are called the Bruins, with colors True Blue and gold. The Bruins participate in NCAA Division I-A as part of the Pacific-12 Conference. Two notable sports facilities serve as home venues for UCLA sports. The Bruin men's football team plays home games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena; the team won a national title in 1954. The basketball and volleyball teams, and the women's gymnastics team play at Pauley Pavilion on campus. The school also sponsors cross country, soccer, women's rowing, golf, tennis, water polo, and women's softball.
The mascots are Joe and Josephine Bruin, and the fight songs are Sons of Westwood and Mighty Bruins. The alma mater is Hail to the Hills of Westwood.
When Henry "Red" Sanders came to UCLA to coach football in 1949, the uniforms were redesigned. Sanders added a gold loop on the shoulders—the UCLA Stripe. The navy blue was changed to a lighter shade of blue. Sanders figured that the baby blue would look better on the field and in film. He dubbed the baby blue uniform "Powder Keg Blue," a powder blue with an explosive kick. This would also differentiate UCLA from all other UC teams, as all UC campuses' official colors are blue and gold.
UCLA is competitive in all major Division I-A sports and has won 125 national championships, including 110 NCAA championships, more than any other university. Most recently, UCLA's baseball team defeated Mississippi State to win its first NCAA National Championship. UCLA's softball program is also outstanding.[tpl]cite web |url=http://uclabruins.cstv.com/genrel/ucla-100-champs.html |title=Bruins lead the nation with 106 NCAA team championships and 124 total national championships |accessdate=2008-05-31 |year=2008 |work=UCLA Bruins [/tpl] Women's softball won their NCAA-leading 11th National Championship, on June 8, 2010. The women's water polo team is also dominant, with a record 7 NCAA championships. Notably, the team helped UCLA become the first school to win 100 NCAA championships overall when they won their fifth on May 13, 2007.
Among these championships, some of the more notable victories are in men's basketball. Under legendary coach John Wooden, UCLA men's basketball teams won 10 NCAA championships, including a record seven consecutive, in 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, and 1975, and an 11th was added under then-coach Jim Harrick in 1995 (through 2008, the most consecutive by any other team is two). From 1971 to 1974, UCLA men's basketball won an unprecedented 88 consecutive games.
UCLA has also shown dominance in men's volleyball, with 19 national championships. All 19 teams were led by former[tpl]cite web|last=Foster|first=Chris|title=Al Scates to retire as UCLA volleyball coach after 2012 season|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/10/sports/la-sp-0511-scates-ucla-volleyball-20110511|work=News story|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 December 2012[/tpl] coach Al Scates, which ties him with John McDonnell of the University of Arkansas as NCAA leader for national championships in a single sport.
UCLA has medaled in every Olympic Games they have participated in.
Former UCLA basketball player and current Utah Jazz player Earl Watson commented, "Eleven national championships, the best coach (Wooden) to coach the game says a lot. I take offense to those who act like UCLA is just another school compared with Duke. Duke is a great school in the east, but UCLA is worldwide."

===Rivalries===

UCLA shares a traditional sports rivalry with the nearby University of Southern California. Under legendary coach John Wooden, UCLA became a dominating power in men's basketball, and has won 11 NCAA championships, against USC's zero.[tpl]cite web |url=http://uclabruins.cstv.com/genrel/ucla-100-champs.html |title=National Championships |accessdate=2007-05-22 |year=2007 |work=UCLA Bruins [/tpl] In football, UCLA has one national champion team and 16 conference titles, compared to USC's 11 national championships and 37 conference championships.

The origin is unclear, but the rivalry most likely started when football Hall of Fame coach Red Sanders led UCLA to dominance in the 1950s. USC, having won four national championships prior to UCLA's first and only title in 1954 diverted some attention from then-rival University of Notre Dame, and the new cross-town rivalry began.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usctrojans.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/06-m-footbl-guide.html |title=University of Southern California Official Athletic Site - Football |publisher=Usctrojans.com |accessdate=2012-10-14[/tpl]
Presently, UCLA has the most NCAA championships, winning a combined 110 team championships in men's and women's sports, with Stanford University coming in second with 103, followed by USC with 95.http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/champs_records_book/summaries/combined.pdf

==Student life==

The campus' location in Los Angeles makes excursions to local museums, theaters, or other entertainment venues relatively convenient. UCLA offers classical orchestras, intramural sports, and over 800 student organizations. UCLA is also home to more than 68 national and local Greek-letter organizations, which collectively constitute the largest membership-based and multi-faceted community on campus. Fraternity and sorority members represent 15% of the student population.UCLA Fraternity & Sorority Relations. Greeklife.ucla.edu. Retrieved on 2013-07-14. Phrateres, a non-exclusive social-service club for women was founded here in 1924 by the Dean of Women, Helen Matthewson Laughlin. Between 1924 and 1967, 23 chapters of Phrateres were installed in schools across North America. The Student Alumni Association (SAA), a student-run branch under the UCLA Alumni Association, is responsible for conducting UCLA's oldest and greatest traditions, such as Blue and Gold Week, Senior Send-off, Spring Sing, and Dinners for 12 Strangers. UCLA also operates a waterfront facility known as the UCLA Marina Aquatic Center in Marina del Rey, where students and staff participate in dinghy sailing, surfing, windsurfing, rowing, and kayaking.
UCLA has an active a cappella student population, with a variety of student organizations across campus.  The university is often regarded as the pioneer in the West Coast collegiate contemporary a cappella tradition with its first group, Awaken A Cappella, founded in 1992.  The all-male group on campus, Bruin Harmony, has enjoyed a successful career since its inception in 2006, portraying a collegiate a cappella group in The Social Network (2010), while the Scattertones have achieved a great deal of success in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella, finishing in second-place in 2011. Other a cappella groups on campus include Signature, Random Voices, Medleys, Youthphonics, Deviant Voices, Awechords and Cadenza. YOUTHphonics is UCLA's only nonprofit service-oriented a cappella group focused on youth.
There are also a variety of cultural organizations on campus, such as Nikkei Student Union (NSU), Japanese Student Association (JSA),Ucla Jsa. Studentgroups.ucla.edu. Retrieved on 2013-07-14. Association of Chinese Americans (ACA), Chinese Students Association (CSA), Taiwanese American Union (TAU), Hong Kong Student Society (HKSS), Hanoolim Korean Cultural Awareness Group, Samahang Pilipino, Vietnamese Student Union (VSU), Thai Smakom, and Chinese Cultural Dance Club (CCDC), each with its focuses on sharing culture and history. Many of these organizations have an annual "culture night" that usually constitutes drama, traditional dance, modern dance, etc., which raises awareness of culture and history to the campus and community.

===Traditions===

The university has many traditions and annual events involving students, community, or the city. The school hosts events that usually require participation from more than just the student body, and competitions can occasionally involve celebrity judges and performers.
UCLA's official charity is Unicamp, founded in 1934. It is a week-long summer camp for under-served children from the greater Los Angeles area, with UCLA volunteer counselors. Because Unicamp is a non-profit organization, student volunteers from UCLA also fundraise money throughout the year to allow these children to attend summer camp.[tpl]cite web|title=UCLA Unicamp|url=http://www.unicamp.org/site/c.iiKQLaPOLrF/b.5052093/k.BE10/Home.htm|accessdate=4 December 2012[/tpl]
To introduce new students to clubs and activities, UCLA begins the fall quarter with True Bruin Welcome. The week includes the Day of Service for all freshmen, the Enormous Activities Fair, the Sports Fair, and other events. At the end of move-in and the beginning of True Bruin Welcome, UCLA holds Bruin Bash. Hosted by the USAC Campus Events Commission and USAC Cultural Affairs Commission, Bruin Bash includes a concert, dance, and movie. Past performers include Thrice and Common (2005), Xzibit and Rooney (2006), T.I. (2007), The Cool Kids, Estelle, Hellogoodbye (2008), LMFAO and Clipse (2009), Ying Yang Twins, Travis McCoy and The Cataracs (2010). Bruin Bash was created as a replacement for Black Sunday, a large-scale day of partying including all fraternities, in North Westwood Village, where the majority of off-campus students reside adjacent to campus.
Dance Marathon is an annual event organized by the Pediatric AIDS Coalition, previously held in Ackerman Grand Ballroom and since 2014 Pauley Pavilion, where thousands of students raise money and dance for 26 hours to support the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Project Kindle, and the UCLA AIDS Institute. Dancers are required to fundraise a minimum amount of $250 before the event. Dancers are not allowed to sit (except to use the restroom) during the marathon, literally taking a stand against pediatric AIDS, and symbolizing the suffering of affected children around the world. In 2013, Dance Marathon at UCLA raised a record-breaking $475,422.57. Since 2002, the Marathon has raised over $3.5 million.[tpl]cite web |url=http://bruindancemarathon.org/about-newsite.html |title=What's DM? |accessdate=2007-05-21 |year=2007 |work=Bruin Dance Marathon |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070525182557/http://bruindancemarathon.org/about-newsite.html |archivedate = May 25, 2007[/tpl]
UCLA students also participate in "Midnight Yell" during finals week, a tradition where every night at midnight (starting on that week's Sunday), students yell as loudly as possible for a few minutes, giving a chance to take a short break from studying and to release some stress.
The quarterly Undie Run takes place during the Wednesday evening of Finals Week, when students run through the campus in their underwear or in skimpy costumes. The run first began in Fall of 2001 when a student, Eric Whitehead, wearing what he described as "really short shorts" walked around singing and playing a guitar to protest the police restrictions on the Midnight Yell.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dailybruin.com/articles/2005/6/13/undie-run-tradition-faces-grow/ |title=Undie Run tradition faces growing pains |accessdate=2007-06-13 |author=Staines, Xandi |date=2005-06-13 |work=The Daily Bruin [/tpl]  With the increasing safety hazards and Police and Administration involvement, a student committee changed the route in order to satisfy concerns but keep the event. It was changed to a run through campus to Shapiro Fountain, which now culminates with students dancing in the fountain.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dailybruin.com/articles/2005/12/12/undie-run-safety-at-issue/ |title=Undie Run safety at issue |accessdate=2007-05-21 |author=Rushovich, Colin |date=2005-12-12 |work=The Daily Bruin [/tpl] As attendance increased, committees in charge of organizing the event deemed it necessary to employ the UC Police during the event, to ward off vandalism and dangerous activity. In 2007, the route was changed again to begin at Strathmore Avenue instead of Landfair Avenue. The Undie Run concept has since spread to other college campuses around the United States, including the University of Texas at Austin, Arizona State University, and Syracuse University.
The Alumni Association sponsors several events, usually large extravaganzas involving huge amounts of coordination. An example of this is the 60-year old Spring Sing, organized by the Student Alumni Association (SAA). Spring Sing is UCLA's oldest tradition—it is an annual gala of student talent, which is held at either UCLA's Pauley Pavilion or the outdoor Los Angeles Tennis Center.  The committee bestows the George and Ira Gershwin Lifetime Achievement Award each year to a major contributor to the music industry. Past recipients have included Stevie Wonder, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, James Taylor, Ray Charles, Natalie Cole, Quincy Jones,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uclalumni.net/CalendarEvents/springsing/Gershwin/winners.cfm |title=Gershwin Award Winners |accessdate=2007-05-21 |year=2007 |work=Alumni Association [/tpl] Lionel Richie, and in 2009, Julie Andrews.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/electronicplay.aspx?fid=24831&id=E0C5478 |title=Lional Richie accepts the Gershwin Award |publisher=Newsroom.ucla.edu |date=2008-05-02 |accessdate=2011-09-11[/tpl] The Dinner for 12 Strangers, a common tradition among universities, is a gathering of students, alumni, administration and faculty to network around different interests.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.today.ucla.edu/2004/040121voices_mind.html |title=Dinner with 12 strangers is a feast for friends |accessdate=2007-05-21 |author=Valentine, Jane |date=2004-01-21 |work=UCLA Today |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901103028/http://www.today.ucla.edu/2004/040121voices_mind.html |archivedate = September 1, 2006[/tpl] The week before the USC rivalry football game, there is a "Beat 'SC Bonfire and Rally." The bonfire did not take place in 2006 due to fire hazard issues. Nonetheless, UCLA won the football game, upsetting the #2 ranked Trojans. This led many to believe that dispelling of the tradition led to the victory.
The USAC Cultural Affairs Commission hosts the JazzReggae Festival, a two-day concert on Memorial Day weekend that attracts more than 20,000 attendees.  The JazzReggae Festival is the largest, entirely student produced and run event of its kind on the West Coast.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jazzreggaefest.com/pages/about/ |title=JazzReggae Fest 2011 |publisher=Jazzreggaefest.com |accessdate=2011-09-11[/tpl]
Sigma Eta Pi and Bruin Entrepreneurs organize an annual hackathon called LA Hacks, a weekend-long programming competition where students from around the nation come to build technology products. LA Hacks established itself as the largest hackathon in the nation when over 1500 students participated in April 11–13, 2014 (source, LA Times). LA Hacks also holds the record for the most funds raised via corporate sponsorships with $250,000 raised. Some of the tech world's most prominent people have given talks and judged projects at LA Hacks, including Evan Spiegel, Founder and CEO of Snapchat, Alexis Ohanian, Co-Founder of Reddit, Baiju Bhatt, Co-Founder of Robinhood, Sam Altman, President of Y Combinator, Chris De Wolfe - Founder of Myspace, and Tomer Kagan, Co-Founder and CEO of Quixey).

===Student government===

The Associated Students UCLA (ASUCLA) is the official entity encompassing student government and student-led enterprises at UCLA. ASUCLA has four major components: the Undergraduate Students Association, the Graduate Students Association, Student Media, and services & enterprises. However, in common practice, the term ASUCLA is often more narrowly used to refer to the services and enterprises component. This includes the Student Store, Bookstore, Food Services, Student Union, etc. These commercial enterprises serving the UCLA campus community generate approximately $90 million in annual revenues, making it financially the largest student government operation in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.guidestar.org/ReportNonProfit.aspx?ein=95-1777979&name=associated-students-ucla# |title=ASSOCIATED STUDENTS UCLA 95-1777979 GuideStar Report |publisher=.guidestar.org |accessdate=2010-05-23[/tpl] As a nonprofit corporation, the financial goal of ASUCLA is not to maximize return or "profit" but to provide quality services and programs to the campus community at reasonable prices. ASUCLA is governed by a student-majority Board of Directors. The Undergraduate Students Association and Graduate Students Association each appoint three members plus one alternate. In addition to the student members, there are representatives appointed by the administration, the academic senate, and the alumni association. The "services and enterprises" portion of ASUCLA is run by a professional executive director who oversees some 300 staff and 2,000 student employees.
The Graduate Students Association is the governing body for approximately 13,000 graduate and professional students at UCLA.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gsa.asucla.ucla.edu/ |title=UCLA Graduate Student Association |publisher=Gsa.asucla.ucla.edu |date=2010-02-02 |accessdate=2010-05-23[/tpl]
"USAC" is an acronym for Undergraduate Students Association Council, the governing body of the Undergraduate Students Association (USA) whose membership comprises every UCLA undergraduate student.[tpl]cite web|url=http://students.asucla.ucla.edu/ |title=UCLA Undergraduate Students Association |publisher=Students.asucla.ucla.edu |accessdate=2011-09-11[/tpl]  The student body currently has two major political slates, Students First! (established in 1981) and Bruins United (established in 2006).
USAC's thirteen student officers and commissioners are elected by members of the Undergraduate Students Association at an annual election held during Spring Quarter. In addition to its thirteen elected members, USAC includes appointed representatives of the Administration, the Alumni, and the Faculty, as well as two ex-officio members, the ASUCLA Executive Director and a student Finance Committee Chairperson who is appointed by the USA President and approved by USAC. All members of USAC may participate fully in Council deliberations, but only the thirteen elected student members have a vote.
The thirteen elected positions include: USAC President, Internal Vice President, External Vice President, General Representative (3), Academic Affairs Commissioner, Cultural Affairs Commissioner, Facilities Commissioner, Campus Events Commissioner, Student Welfare Commissioner, Community Service Commissioner, and Financial Supports Commissioner.[tpl]cite web|title=UCLA Undergraduate Students Association Offices|url=http://www.usac.ucla.edu/about/offices.php|publisher=Undergraduate Students Association Council|accessdate=8 November 2012[/tpl]
The USAC President appoints more than seventy undergraduates to administrative committees and the Academic Affairs Commissioner Appoints approximately 25 undergraduates to Academic Senate Committees. Students have an opportunity to serve on the ASUCLA Board of Directors and the Communications Board, as well as on other significant committees. Through their participation on these campus-wide committees, UCLA undergraduates have had input into the decision making process at a high level.
USAC's programs offers additional services to the campus and surrounding communities and provide an opportunity for students to participate in. For example, each year approximately 40,000 students, faculty and staff attend programs of the Campus Events Commission, including a low-cost film program, a speakers program which presents leading figures from a wide range of disciplines, and performances by dozens of entertainers. Two to three thousand UCLA undergraduates participate annually in the more than twenty voluntary outreach programs run by the Community Service Commission. A large corps of undergraduate volunteers also participate in programs run by the Student Welfare Commission, such as AIDS Awareness, Substance Abuse Awareness, Blood Drives and CPR/First Aid Training.
Student Media UCLA is the home of UCLA's student-run media, including the campus newspaper, magazines, and radio and television stations.[tpl]Dead link|date=May 2010[/tpl]

===Media publications===

Most student media publications distributed on-campus are governed by the ASUCLA Communications Board. The Daily Bruin is UCLA's most prominent student publication. Founded in 1919 under the name Cub Californian, it has since then developed into Los Angeles' third-most circulated newspaper. It has won over 20 national awards in the last five years, and is regularly commended for layout and content. In 2006, the Society of Professional Journalists awarded it Best All-Around Daily Newspaper in the national Mark of Excellence Awards.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spj.org/moe06.asp |title=2006 Mark of Excellence – National Winners/Finalists |accessdate=2007-05-26 |year=2006 |work=Society of Professional Journalists [/tpl] The newspaper has not been without scrutiny and controversy, and in 1954, the administration attempted to intervene with the previous policy of electing editors by a student council. UCLA Student Media also publishes seven news magazines, each established to serve a special-interest community on campus: Al-Talib, Fem, Ha'Am, La Gente de Aztlan, Nommo, Pacific Ties, and Outwrite, a school yearbook, BruinLife, Daily Bruin Television (DBTV), the student-run radio station, UCLAradio.com, formerly known as KLA, and the online campus review-site Bruinwalk.com. Student groups such as The Forum for Energy Economics and Development also publish yearly journals focused on energy technologies and industries.  The School of Law publishes the UCLA Law Review which is currently ranked seventh among American law schools.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx |title=Law Journals: Submissions and Ranking 2013 Combined Score [/tpl]

===Housing===

Most undergraduate students are housed in 14 complexes on the western side of campus, referred to by students as "The Hill." Students can live in halls, plazas, suites, or university apartments, which vary in pricing and privacy. Housing plans also offer students access to dining facilities, which have been ranked by the Princeton Review as some of the best in the nation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.princetonreview.com/schoollist.aspx?type=r&id=683&RDN=1 |title=The Best 371 Colleges: Quality of Life – Campus Food |accessdate=2010-04-20 [/tpl] Dining halls are located in De Neve, Rieber, Covel, and Hedrick Halls. In winter 2012, a dining hall called The Feast at Rieber opened to students. The newest dining hall (as of Winter Quarter 2014) is Bruin Plate, located in the Carnesale Commons (commonly referred to as Sproul Plaza).http://www.dining.ucla.edu/housing_site/dining/ResidentialRestaurantsMap.pdf The De Neve dining hall will be closed from end of April through summer of 2014 for renovations. Residential cafes include Bruin Cafe, Rendezvous, and Cafe 1919 which formerly housed a cafe known as Puzzles. UCLA currently offers three years guaranteed housing to its incoming freshmen, and one year to incoming transfer students. There are four type of housing available for students, residential halls, deluxe residential halls, residential plazas, and residential suites. Available on the hill are study rooms, basketball courts, tennis courts, and Sunset Recreational Center which includes three swimming pools.
Graduate students are housed in one of five apartment complexes. One, Weyburn Terrace, is located just southwest of the campus in Westwood Village. The other four are roughly five miles south of UCLA in Palms and Mar Vista. They too vary in pricing and privacy.[tpl]cite web | url = http://map.ais.ucla.edu/go/1002103 | title=Living in University Apartments | accessdate=2010-08-06[/tpl]
According to the Daily Bruin, 1,525 beds, 10 faculty in-residence apartments and a 750-seat dining hall will be built on the Northwest Housing Infill Project on the Hill by 2013. The buildings are tentatively titled De Neve Gardenia Way, De Neve Holly Ridge, Sproul Cove, and Sproul Landing.[tpl]cite news |first=Brett |last=Noble |title=Project to increase housing options |url=http://www.dailybruin.com/articles/2008/6/4/project-increase-housing-options/ |work=Daily Bruin |date=2008-06-04 |accessdate=2008-06-09 [/tpl]
Students who are involved in Greek life have the option to also live in Greek housing while at UCLA. Sorority houses are located east of campus on Hilgard Avenue, and the Fraternity houses are located west of campus throughout Westwood Village. A student usually lives with 50+ students in Greek housing.

===Hospitality===

Hospitality constituents of the university include departments not directly related to student life or administration. The Hospitality department manages the UCLA Guest House, a full-service, on-campus hotel. The 61-room Guest House services those visiting the university for campus-related activities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://map.ais.ucla.edu/portal/site/UCLA/menuitem.3f8e7342ad4ca217b66d4ab4f848344a/?vgnextoid=fd5af9f9bd19ff00VgnVCM1000008f8443a4RCRD |title=Guest House Hotel |accessdate=2007-05-21 |year=2007 |work=Official site [/tpl] The department also manages the UCLA Conference Center, a 40 acre (0.2 km²) conference center in the San Bernardino Mountains near Lake Arrowhead.[tpl]cite web |url=http://map.ais.ucla.edu/portal/site/UCLA/menuitem.3f8e7342ad4ca217b66d4ab4f848344a/?vgnextoid=ec175645ff212010VgnVCM1000008f8443a4RCRD |title=Conference Center at Lake Arrowhead |accessdate=2007-05-21 |year=2007 |work=Official site [/tpl] Hospitality also operates UCLA Catering [tpl]cite web |url=http://map.ais.ucla.edu/go/campus-services/hospitality/catering | title= UCLA Catering |year=2009 | work=official cite[/tpl] a vending operation, and summer conference center located on the Westwood campus.[tpl]cite web |url=http://map.ais.ucla.edu/portal/site/UCLA/menuitem.3f8e7342ad4ca217b66d4ab4f848344a/?vgnextoid=143d396579b8ff00VgnVCM1000008f8443a4RCRD |title=Conference Services |accessdate=2007-05-21 |year=2007 |work=Official site [/tpl]

===Chabad House===

The UCLA Chabad House is a community center for Jewish students operated by the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement. Established in 1969, it was the first Chabad House at a university.The Visual Culture of Chabad, Maya Balakirsky Katz, Cambridge University Press, 2010, page 152.The Rebbe's Army: Inside the World of Chabad-Lubavitch, Sue Fishkoff, Random House, 2009 In 1980, three students died in a fire in the original building of the UCLA Chabad House. The present building was erected in their memory. The building, completed in 1984, was the first of many Chabad houses worldwide designed as architectural reproductions of the residence of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson at 770 Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, New York.
