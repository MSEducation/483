Das deutsche Mädel (Eng:  The German Girl or Maiden) was the Nazi magazine aimed at German girls, particularly members of League of German Girls."Material from "Das deutsche Mädel"
Unlike the adventure orientation of Der Pimpf, intended for Hitler Youth, Das deutsche Mädel urged hiking, tending the wounded, hard work in factories, and preparing for motherhood.  On the other hand, in contrast to the woman's magazine with some propaganda, NS-Frauen-Warte, it lay far more emphasis on the strong and active German woman; health, education, service, and sports all featured, and famous women depicted included doctors, athletes, poets, and pilots.Leila J. Rupp, Mobilizing Women for War, p 45, ISBN 05109-7
Articles in it included describing a speech by Jutta Rüdiger when she was appointed to lead The League of German Girls,"The Tasks of the BDM in the Year 1938" telling the girls of their duties to Germany,"You Have the Best Examples" and a story of how Young Girls had ensured that a dead father's promise to his son was fulfilled."Because Father Had Promised"
