[[Chomsky hierarchy]]

CATEGORIES: 1956 in computer science, Formal languages, Generative linguistics, Noam Chomsky

Within the field of computer science, specifically in the area of formal languages, the Chomsky hierarchy (occasionally referred to as Chomsky-Schützenberger hierarchy) is a containment hierarchy of classes of formal grammars.
This hierarchy of grammars was described by Noam Chomsky in 1956.[tpl]cite journal | last = Chomsky | first = Noam | year = 1956 | title = Three models for the description of language | url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/195609--.pdf | doi = 10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813| journal = IRE Transactions on Information Theory | issue = 2 | pages = 113–124[/tpl] It is also named after Marcel-Paul Schützenberger, who played a crucial role in the development of the theory of formal languages. The Chomsky Hierarchy, in essence, allows the possibility for the understanding and use of a computer science model which enables a programmer to accomplish meaningful linguistic goals systematically.

==Formal grammars==

A formal grammar of this type consists of:
A formal grammar defines (or generates) a formal language, which is a (usually infinite) set of finite-length sequences of symbols (i.e. strings) that may be constructed by applying production rules to another sequence of symbols which initially contains just the start symbol.  A rule may be applied to a sequence of symbols by replacing an occurrence of the symbols on the left-hand side of the rule with those that appear on the right-hand side.  A sequence of rule applications is called a derivation.  Such a grammar defines the formal language: all words consisting solely of terminal symbols which can be reached by a derivation from the start symbol.
The following is a simpler grammar that defines the same language: 
Other sequences that can be derived from this grammar are "ideas hate great linguists", and "ideas generate". While these sentences are nonsensical, they are syntactically correct. A syntactically incorrect sentence like e.g. "ideas ideas great hate" cannot be derived from this grammar. See "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" for a similar example given by Chomsky in 1957; see Phrase structure grammar and Phrase structure rules for more natural-language examples and the problems of formal grammars in that area.

==The hierarchy==

The Chomsky hierarchy consists of the following levels:
Note that the set of grammars corresponding to recursive languages is not a member of this hierarchy; these would be properly between Type-0 and Type-1.
Every regular language is context-free, every context-free language (not containing the empty string) is context-sensitive, every context-sensitive language is recursive and every recursive language is recursively enumerable. These are all proper inclusions, meaning that there exist recursively enumerable languages which are not context-sensitive, context-sensitive languages which are not context-free and context-free languages which are not regular.
The following table summarizes each of Chomsky's four types of grammars, the class of language it generates, the type of automaton that recognizes it, and the form its rules must have.  
However, there are further categories of formal languages, some of which are given in the expandable navigation box at the bottom of this page.
