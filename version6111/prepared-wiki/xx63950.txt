Fabián Bielinsky (3 February 1959 – 29 June 2006) was an Argentine film director born in Buenos Aires.
He started to make films early in his life, while still a high school student in the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires, after graduation he started studying psychology, a career he shortly followed and dropped out in favor to enroll in the Centro de Experimentacion y Realizacion Cinematografica (CERC, actually ENERC, INCAA's film school), to later graduate from said institution in 1983 with a short film called La Espera, based on a story by Jorge Luis Borges.
He directed his first film, Nine Queens (original title Nueve Reinas) in 2000, and the second one, El Aura, in 2005, which he was going to present in Edinburgh, at the International Film Festival a month later. Both films starred Ricardo Darín in the lead role and Alejandro Awada in a supporting role.
Bielinsky died from a heart attack while in São Paulo, Brazil, doing a casting for an advertisement.
