CATEGORIES: Islands of Japan, Japanese archipelago

The [tpl]nihongo|Japanese archipelago|日本列島|Nihon Rettō[/tpl] are the islands that form the country of Japan, and extends roughly from northeast to southwest along the northeastern coast of the Eurasia mainland, washing upon the northwestern shores of the Pacific Ocean. It consists of islands from the Sakhalin island arc and the Northeastern Japan arc.
The term Home Islands was used at the end of World War II to define the area of Japan to which its sovereignty and the constitutional rule of the Emperor would be restricted.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] The term is also commonly used today to distinguish the archipelago from Japan's colonies and other territories in the first half of the 20th century.Milton W.
