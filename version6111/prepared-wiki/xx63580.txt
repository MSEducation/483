Subhash Kak ([tpl]lang-hi|सुभाष काक[/tpl]; Subhāṣ Kāk) (born March 26, 1947 in Srinagar, Kashmir) is an Indian American computer scientist. He is Regents Professor and a previous Head of Computer Science Department at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater who has made contributions to  cryptography, neural networks, and quantum information. He is also notable for his  Indological publications on history, the philosophy of science, ancient astronomy, and the history of mathematics.
Subhash Kak completed his BE from NIT Srinagar and Ph.D. at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi in 1970. He taught there. During 1975-1976, he was a visiting faculty at Imperial College, London, and a guest researcher at Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill. In 1977, he was a visiting researcher at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay.http://www.cs.okstate.edu/~subhashk/bio.html In 1979 joined Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge where he was the Donald C. and Elaine T. Delaune Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. In 2007, he joined the Computer Science department at Oklahoma State University.Departmental directory, OSU
His research in the fields of cryptography, random sequences, artificial intelligence, and information theory have been published in peer-reviewed journals. He proposed a test of algorithmic randomnessTerry Ritter, Randomness tests and a type of instantaneously trained neural networks (INNs) (which he and his students have called "CC4 network" and others have called "Kak neural networks"). He claims to be amongst the first to apply information metrics to quantum systems.S. Kak, "On quantum numbers and uncertainty," Nuovo Cimento, 34B, 530-534, 1976. He was featured as one of the pioneers of quantum learning in the journal Neuroquantology edited by Cheryl Fricasso and Stanley Krippner.http://www.neuroquantology.com/index.php/journal/article/view/446
Kak has argued that there are limits to the intelligence machines can have and it cannot equal biological intelligence.S. Kak, Active agents, intelligence and quantum computing. Information Sciences, vol. 128, 1-17, 2000. He asserts that:

==Kak neural network==

The Kak neural network, also called the CC4 networkA. Shortt et al, Optical implementation of the Kak neural network. Information Sciences, vol. 171, 2005, pp. 273-287 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1063588  is an instantaneously trained neural network that creates a new "hidden neuron" for each training sample, achieving immediate training for binary data. The training algorithm for binary data creates links to the new hidden node that simply reflects the binary values in the training vector. Hence, no computation is involved.[ref]S. Kak, New algorithms for training feedforward neural networks. Pattern Recognition Letters 15, 1994, pp. 295-298;  S. Kak, On generalization by neural networks.

==Kak's three-stage protocol==

Kak's three-stage protocol is a protocol for quantum cryptography suggested by Kak.S. Kak, “A Three-Stage Quantum Cryptography Protocol,” Foundations of Physics Letters 19 (2006), 293-296.

==Indological publications==

Kak's writings concerning the astronomy of the Vedic period in his book The Astronomical Code of the Rigveda (1994) back "Indigenous Aryans" ideology, questioning conventional views on the Indo-Aryan migration and the nature of early Indian science. His chronology and astronomical calculations have been opposed by several Indologists (such as Michael Witzel[tpl]Citation | last = Witzel | first = Michael | author-link  = | year = 2001 | title = Autochthonous Aryans?

===The Astronomical Code of the Rigveda and Archaeoastronomy===

The Astronomical Code of the Rigveda (New Delhi: Aditya Prakashan, 1994; revised and enlarged edition, New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 2000) claims regularities in the organization of the Rigveda, connecting the structure to certain numbers in the astronomy-based ritual of the five-layered brick altars of the Vedic times.
Kak's archaeoastronomical claims have the effect of significantly extending the Vedic period, postulating the arrival of ethnic Indo-Aryans to the 7th millennium BC. This claim is in contradiction with mainstream Indology and historical linguistics and science historians
Kak arranges the number of hymns in each book of the Rigveda as follows, and compares the arrangement to a Vedic fire altar:
