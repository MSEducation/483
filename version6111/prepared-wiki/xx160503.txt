==Student activities==

Indian Society for Technical Education (ISTE) is working in the campus since 1985.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] The students chapter arranges talks and conferences every semester. Civil & Mechanical Engineering departments have student chapter recognized by institute of Engineers (India).http://www.topengineeringcolleges.co.in/College-Details.aspx?College=K.L.E-Society’s-College-Of-Engineering-Technology&CollegeID=2556 The IEEE student branch of the college was started in the year 1992. The student branch library is rich in technical literature and the latest IEEE magazines are available for reference.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] A two-day national level tech fest VAIVIDHYAM’13 was held at IEEE student branch of this college.http://bangalore.r10sac.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=82:vaividhyam%E2%80%9910-kle-ieee-belgaum&Itemid=60 
Also, in the year 2011, the Department of Mechanical Engineering, along with the few students from the outgoing batch of the year started a techno-cultural symposium known as "Mechsmersize". It all started with the co-ordination of the Department faculty and the final year out going students of 2011 later joined by the junior students. They all started to create one festival, which would represent the capability of the Mechanical department and its students. This idea turned out to be a huge success and officially Mechsmerize 2011 had been the biggest technical event in KLESCET, Belgaum after VTU fest which was held before in the college.Consequently this event in the history of KLESCET had set many records and had set the bar too high for others to compete.
When asked the students,not one but all said that they were very proud of the event and their department. One student also went on record saying that the organizers of the Mechsmerize 2011 team went through really bad patch and in spite of all this, they reached a new level all-together . With this event, not only did it create a huge fan base, also it made the Department of Mechanical Engineering stronger.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
