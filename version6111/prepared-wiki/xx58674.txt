CATEGORIES: Earldoms in the Peerage of the United Kingdom

Earl of Snowdon is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1961, together with the subsidiary title Viscount Linley, of Nymans in the County of Sussex, for Antony Armstrong-Jones,[tpl]LondonGazette|issue=42481 |date=6 October 1961 |startpage=7199 |supp=|accessdate=13 July 2009[/tpl] who was then the husband of Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. Snowdon as a peerage title had previous royal associations; the title of Baron Snowdon had been conferred along with the Dukedom of Edinburgh on Prince Frederick Louis, grandson of George I and future Prince of Wales, in 1726. The title merged in the crown in 1760 when its holder acceded as George III.
In November 1999, Lord Snowdon received a life peerage as Baron Armstrong-Jones, under a device designed to allow first-generation hereditaries to retain their seats in the House of Lords, after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999.London Gazette Friday, 19 November 1999London Gazette Tuesday, 23 November 1999
