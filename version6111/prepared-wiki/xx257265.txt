She was one of the few high school girls in the country to receive a scholarship to college for tennis in the days before Title IX took effect.

In 2005 they started the Guerrant Foundation which raises money to help the poorest of the world's poor through small loans to start businesses. The Guerrants have supported this effort with their own funds in addition to the money they have raised. They have helped thousands of people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
