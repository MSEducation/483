CATEGORIES: Railway stations in Shiga Prefecture

[tpl]nihongo|Ōmi-Imazu Station|近江今津駅|Ōmi-Imazu Eki[/tpl] is a railway station on the Kosei Line of West Japan Railway Company located in Takashima, Shiga Prefecture, Japan.
As a key stations of the Kosei Line, the station with a yard on its south side originates and terminates many trains. The station has two island platforms with two tracks each capable of serving 12-car trains, as well as sidetracks for passing trains.
Previously most of the Special Rapid Service trains from the JR Kyoto Line turned at this station until 2006 when most Special Rapid Service trains were extended to Tsuruga Station. As of 2011, there is one such train in the morning that terminates at the station.
The extension of the services to the north section required coupling and releasing of carriages at this station since platforms of Ōmi-Shiotsu Station and beyond can only handle 4-car trains. In order to facilitate these works, a signal was newly added to the track 2 of the station.
