Pensacola School Of Liberal Arts is a private secondary school in Pensacola, Florida, established by William Holston to be an alternative to area public schools. Bill Holston, along with previous Alumni, operate in the School as both office staff and as teachers, assisting a wide array of students of all ages and of various ethnic and financial backgrounds. The house itself has belonged to Bill Holston for several years, but was converted into a school, and then into an office when a secondary building was constructed near it that houses much of the class activities.
The school's history is somewhat different from that of many other local schools, as William Holston founded the school on the premise of bettering students who could not function, or were rejected, from other area schools. Holston was originally a principal at a nearby High School in the town of Pensacola, however, he left the school for various reasons, the chief being the way the school was conducted. This decision to leave the school set in motion the events that brought the Pensacola School of Liberal Arts into what it is, a haven for students to excel in an environment where they are in close contact with knowledgeable instructors.
