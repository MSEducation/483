"I Want to be a Cowboy's Sweetheart" is a country and Western song written and first recorded in 1935 by Rubye Blevins, who performed as Patsy Montana.  It was the first country song by a female artist to sell more than one million copies.[tpl]cite web| title= Patsy Montana's Vest and Skirt | url= http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=106|work= HistoryWired: A few of our favorite things| publisher= Smithsonian Institution |accessdate= 2012-08-03 [/tpl] Montana wrote the song in 1934 when she was feeling lonely and missing her boyfriend; it was recorded a year later when producer Art Satherly, of ARC Records, needed one more song at a Prairie Ramblers recording session. Montana was the group's soloist at the time. Her song is based on Stuart Hamblen's western song Texas Plains: he is therefore credited as a cowriter. Patsy Montana embellished the simpler musical pattern of the original, especially with her yodeling. Patsy also used a lot of the original words: the song is somewhat of a feminine answer to its precursor.
In 2012 her record was added to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry list of "culturally, historically, or aesthetically important" American sound recordings.[tpl]cite web|title=The National Recording Registry 2011|url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2011reg.html|work=National Recording Preservation Board of the Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress|date=May 24, 2012| quote=Her song's lively, quick polka tempo and yodeling refrain, and Montana's exuberant delivery, resulted in it being requested at every performance; it became one of the first hits by a female country and western singer.|accessdate=2012-08-03 [/tpl]
