CATEGORIES: Earldoms in the Peerage of the United Kingdom

Earl of Swinton is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1955 for the prominent Conservative politician Philip Cunliffe-Lister, 1st Viscount Swinton. He had already been created Viscount Swinton, of Masham in the County of York, in 1935, and was made Baron Masham, of Ellington in the County of York, at the same time he was given the earldom. Born Philip Lloyd-Greame, he was the husband of Mary Constance "Molly" Boynton, granddaughter Samuel Cunliffe-Lister, 1st Baron Masham. When his wife inherited the large Masham estates in 1924, they assumed the surname of Cunliffe-Lister in lieu of Lloyd-Greame.
The Earl was succeeded by his grandson, the second Earl. He was the eldest son of Major the Hon. John Yarburgh Cunliffe-Lister, who was killed in the Second World War. Lord Swinton notably served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard (deputy chief government whip in the House of Lords) from 1982 to 1986 in the Conservative administration of Margaret Thatcher. His wife was Susan Cunliffe-Lister, Baroness Masham of Ilton. As of 2009 the titles are held by Lord Swinton's younger brother, the third Earl, who succeeded in 2006. 
The title is named after Swinton Park near Masham, North Yorkshire. The family seat is now Dykes Hill House, near Masham, North Yorkshire.
