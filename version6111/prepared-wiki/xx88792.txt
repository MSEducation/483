==Career==

In 1822 Toucey was named prosecuting attorney of Hartford County, Connecticut. He served in that position until 1835, when he was elected to the 24th and 25th Congresses (at-large and then representing the 1st District).He served from 1835 to 1839. He lost the election of 1838 and returned to his position as prosecuting attorney in 1842. 
In 1845, Toucey ran for Governor and lost, but the Connecticut State Legislature appointed him to the position in 1846. During his tenure, an antibribery bill was considered which was geared toward eliminating fraudulent electoral procedures. He was defeated in an attempt at re-election.[tpl]cite web|title=Isaac Toucey|url=http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_connecticut/col2-content/main-content-list/title_toucey_isaac.html|publisher=National Governors Association|accessdate=30 November 2012[/tpl] 
In 1848, President of the United States James K. Polk appointed Toucey the 20th Attorney General of the United States, a position he held until 1849. He returned to Connecticut and took a place in the Connecticut Senate in 1850, and then in the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1852.
Toucey was elected to the U.S. Senate for the term commencing March 4, 1851, and served from May 12, 1852, to March 3, 1857, having that year declined to be a candidate for reelection.[tpl]cite web|title=Isaac Toucey|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/isaac_toucey/410891|publisher=Govtrack US Congress|accessdate=30 November 2012[/tpl]  During that time, he often served as the legislative point man for Franklin Pierce and his administration.
James Buchanan, who Toucey had served with in the Polk administration, appointed him U.S. Secretary of the Navy in his Cabinet in 1857 as a sop to the Pierce faction as well as to represent New England in the Cabinet. A moderate Northerner much in line with Buchanan's thought in the sectional controversies of the day, Toucey  held that post until 1861 and the arrival of the Abraham Lincoln administration. Toucey was then replaced by one of his chief rivals in Connecticut, Gideon Welles. After 1861 he returned to his law practice.
