George Roger Waters (born 6 September 1943) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and composer. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd with drummer Nick Mason, keyboardist Richard Wright and guitarist, singer and songwriter Syd Barrett. Waters initially served as the group's bassist and co-lead vocalist, but following the departure of Barrett in 1968, he also became their lyricist and conceptual leader.
Pink Floyd subsequently achieved international success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall and The Final Cut. By the early 1980s, they had become one of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling acts in the history of popular music; as of 2013, they have sold more than 250 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million units sold in the United States. Amid creative differences within the group, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their intended use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years had passed before he performed with them again.
Waters' solo career has included three studio albums: The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Radio K.A.O.S. and Amused to Death. In 1990, he staged one of the largest and most extravagant rock concerts in history, The Wall – Live in Berlin, with an official attendance of 200,000. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. That same year he released [tpl]lang|fr|Ça Ira[/tpl], an opera in three acts translated from Étienne and Nadine Roda-Gils' libretto about the French Revolution. Later that year, he reunited with Pink Floyd bandmates Mason, Wright and David Gilmour for the Live 8 global awareness event; it was the group's first appearance with Waters since 1981. He has toured extensively as a solo act since 1999 and played The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety for his world tour of 2006–2008. In 2010, he began The Wall Live and in 2011 Gilmour and Mason appeared with him during a performance of the double album in London. As of 2013, the tour is the highest-grossing of all time by a solo artist.
Waters has been married four times; first in 1969 to his childhood sweetheart Judy Trim; they had no children together and divorced in 1975. The following year he married Lady Carolyne Christie; the marriage produced a son, Harry Waters, a musician who has played keyboards with his father's touring band since 2006, and a daughter, India Waters, who has worked as a model. Christie and Waters divorced in 1992, and in 1993, he married Priscilla Phillips. They had one son together, Jack Fletcher, before getting divorced in 2001. In 2012, Waters married actress and filmmaker Laurie Durning.

==1943–1964: early years==

George Roger Waters was born on 6 September 1943, the younger of two boys, to Mary (née Whyte; 1913-2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1913-1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey.[tpl]sfn|Thompson|2013|p=7[/tpl] His father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, a devout Christian, and a Communist Party member.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p=13[/tpl] In the early years of the Second World War, his father was a conscientious objector who drove an ambulance during the Blitz.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p=13[/tpl] He later changed his stance on pacifism and joined the British Army, and as a 2Lt. of the 8th Royal Fusiliers died at Aprilia, between Anzio and Rome in Italy, on 18 February 1944, when Roger was five months old.[tpl]harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=13–14[/tpl]; for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission entry on Eric Waters see: [tpl]cite web|title= Casualty Details|publisher= Commonwealth War Graves Commission|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2099066/WATERS,%20ERIC%20FLETCHER|accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl] On 19 February 2014, Waters unveiled a monument to his father and other war casualties there, and was made an honorary citizen of Anzio.[tpl]cite web|title= Wanted in Rome|url=http://www.wantedinrome.com/news/2002950/roger-waters-made-honorary-citizen-of-anzio.html[/tpl] Following her husband's death, Mary Waters, also a teacher, moved with her two sons to Cambridge and raised them there.[tpl]sfn|Manning|2006|pp=5–6[/tpl] Roger Waters' earliest memory is of the VJ Day celebrations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011j39v|title=Desert Island Discs, Roger Waters|date=29 May 2011|publisher=BBC Radio 4|accessdate=29 May 2011[/tpl] Mary Waters died in 2009, aged 96.
Waters attended Morley Memorial Junior School in Cambridge and then the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (now Hills Road Sixth Form College) with Syd Barrett, while his future musical partner, David Gilmour, lived nearby on the city's Mill Road, and attended the Perse School.[tpl]sfn|Watkinson|Anderson|1991|pp=15–18[/tpl] At 15, Waters was chairman of the Cambridge Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (YCND),[tpl]sfn|Mason|2005|pp= 12–13[/tpl] having designed its publicity poster and participated in its organisation.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|p=13[/tpl] Though he was a keen sportsman and a highly regarded member of the high school's cricket and rugby teams,[tpl]sfn|Watkinson|Anderson|1991|p=23[/tpl] he disliked his educational experience; according to Waters, "I hated every second of it, apart from games. The regime at school was a very oppressive one ... the same kids who are susceptible to bullying by other kids are also susceptible to bullying by the teachers."[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 14–19[/tpl] Whereas Waters knew Barrett and Gilmour from his childhood in Cambridge, he met future Pink Floyd founder members Nick Mason and Richard Wright in London at the Regent Street Polytechnic (later the University of Westminster) school of architecture. Waters enrolled there in 1962, after a series of aptitude tests indicated he was well-suited to that field.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|p=320[/tpl] He had initially considered a career in mechanical engineering.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p=36[/tpl]

==1965–1985: Pink Floyd==

===Formation and Barrett-led period===

By September 1963, Waters and Mason had lost interest in their studies; they had moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic.[tpl]harvnb|Blake|2008|p=40[/tpl]: (secondary source); [tpl]harvnb|Mason|2005|p=20[/tpl]: (primary source). Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in the autumn of 1963, in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist Clive Metcalfe.[tpl]harvnb|Manning|2006|p=13[/tpl]: (secondary source); [tpl]harvnb|Mason|2005|p=17[/tpl]: (primary source). They usually called themselves Sigma 6, but also used the name the Meggadeaths.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|p=13[/tpl] Waters played rhythm guitar and Mason played drums, Wright played on any keyboard he could arrange to use, and Noble's sister Sheilagh provided an occasional vocal accompaniment.[tpl]sfn|Mason|2005|pp=17–18[/tpl] In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of Regent Street Polytechnic.[tpl]sfn|Mason|2005|pp=13–18[/tpl]
When Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own group in September 1963, the remaining members asked Barrett and guitar player Bob Klose to join.[tpl]harvnb|Mason|2005|p=18[/tpl]: (primary source); [tpl]harvnb|Povey|2008|p=14[/tpl]: (secondary source). By January 1964, the group became known as the Abdabs, or the Screaming Abdabs.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|p=14[/tpl] During the autumn of 1964, the band used the names Leonard's Lodgers, Spectrum Five, and eventually, the Tea Set.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|pp= 18, 28[/tpl] Sometime during the autumn of 1965, the Tea Set began calling itself the Pink Floyd Sound, later the Pink Floyd and by early 1966, Pink Floyd.[tpl]harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=30–37[/tpl]: (primary source); [tpl]harvnb|Povey|2008|p=32[/tpl]: (secondary source).
By early 1966 Barrett was Pink Floyd's front-man, guitarist, and songwriter.[tpl]sfn|Mason|2005|p=87[/tpl] He wrote or co-wrote all but one track of their debut LP The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, released in August 1967.[tpl]sfn|Mason|2005|pp= 87–107[/tpl] Waters contributed the song "Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk" (his first sole writing credit) to the album.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p= 91[/tpl] By late 1967, Barrett's deteriorating mental health and increasingly erratic behaviour,[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp=90–114[/tpl] rendered him "unable or unwilling"[tpl]sfn|Mason|2005|p=129[/tpl] to continue in his capacity as Pink Floyd's singer-songwriter and lead guitarist.[tpl]sfn|Mason|2005|pp=87–107[/tpl] In early March 1968 Pink Floyd met with managers Peter Jenner and Andrew King of Blackhill Enterprises to discuss the band's future. Barrett agreed to leave Pink Floyd, and the band "agreed to Blackhill's entitlement in perpetuity" regarding "past activities".[tpl]sfn|Mason|2005|p=105[/tpl] The band's new manager Steve O'Rourke made a formal announcement about the departure of Barrett and the arrival of David Gilmour in April 1968.[tpl]sfn|Mason|2005|p=106[/tpl]

===Waters-led period===

Filling the void left by Barrett's departure in March 1968, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd's artistic direction. He became the principal songwriter, lyricist and co-lead vocalist (along with Gilmour, and at times, Wright), and would remain the band's dominant creative figure until his departure in 1985.[tpl]sfn|Mason|2005|pp= 106–107, 160–161, 265, 278[/tpl] He wrote the lyrics to the five Pink Floyd albums preceding his own departure, starting with The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) and ending with The Final Cut (1983), while exerting progressively more creative control over the band and its music. Every Waters studio album since The Dark Side of the Moon has been a concept album.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 3, 9, 113, 156, 242, 279, 320, 398[/tpl] With lyrics written entirely by Waters, The Dark Side of the Moon was one of the most commercially successful rock albums ever. It spent 736 straight weeks on the Billboard 200 chart—until July 1988—and sold over 40 million copies worldwide. It was continuing to sell over 8,000 units every week as of 2005.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58524/floyds-dark-side-celebrates-chart-milestone|title= Floyd's 'Dark Side' Celebrates Chart Milestone|last1=Titus|first1=Christa|last2=Waddell|first2=Ray|work=Billboard|year=2005|accessdate=24 October 2011[/tpl] According to Pink Floyd biographer Glen Povey, Dark Side is the world's second best-selling album, and the United States' 21st best-selling album of all time.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|p= 345[/tpl]
Waters produced thematic ideas that became the impetus for the Pink Floyd concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979)—written largely by Waters—and The Final Cut (1983)—written entirely by Waters.[tpl]sfn|Mason|2005|pp= 265–269[/tpl] He referred or alluded to the cost of war and the loss of his father throughout his work, from "Corporal Clegg" (A Saucerful of Secrets, 1968) and "Free Four" (Obscured by Clouds, 1972) to "Us and Them" from The Dark Side of the Moon, "When the Tigers Broke Free", first used in the feature film, The Wall (1982), later included with "The Fletcher Memorial Home" on The Final Cut, an album dedicated to his father.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p=294[/tpl] The theme and composition of The Wall was influenced by his upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 294–295, 351[/tpl]
[tpl]Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|quote=I think things like "Comfortably Numb" were the last embers of mine and Roger's ability to work collaboratively together.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p=275[/tpl]|source= —David Gilmour|align=right|width=25em[/tpl]
The double album The Wall was written almost entirely by Waters and is largely based on his life story,[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p= 260[/tpl] and having sold over 23 million RIAA certified units in the US as of 2013, is one of the top three best-selling albums of all time in America, according to RIAA.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|title=RIAA GOLD & PLATINUM Top 100 Albums |accessdate=17 October 2010[/tpl] Pink Floyd hired Bob Ezrin to co-produce the album, and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe to illustrate the album's sleeve art.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp=260–261[/tpl] The band embarked on The Wall Tour of Los Angeles, New York, London, and Dortmund. The last band performance of The Wall was on 16 June 1981, at Earls Court London, and this was Pink Floyd's last appearance with Waters until the band's brief reunion at 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, 24 years later.[tpl]sfn|Povey|Russell|1997|p= 185[/tpl]
In March 1983, the last Waters–Gilmour–Mason collaboration, The Final Cut, was released. The album was subtitled: "A requiem for the post-war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd".[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|p=230[/tpl] Waters wrote all the album's lyrics as well as the music. His lyrics were critical of the Conservative Party government of the day and mention Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher by name.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 294–299[/tpl] At the time Gilmour did not have any new material, so he asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p= 295[/tpl] According to Mason, after power struggles within the band and creative arguments about the album, Gilmour's name "disappeared" from the production credits, though he retained his pay.[tpl]sfn|Mason|2005|pp= 264–270[/tpl] Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder describing it as "a superlative achievement" and "art rock's crowning masterpiece".[tpl]harvnb|Blake|2008|p=300[/tpl]: "art rock's crowning masterpiece"; [tpl]harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=262[/tpl]: "a superlative achievement". Loder viewed the work as "essentially a Roger Waters solo album".[tpl]cite web|last=Loder |first=Kurt |title= Pink Floyd: The Final Cut (Toshiba) |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-final-cut-19830414 |work=Rolling Stone|date=14 April 1983 |accessdate=6 May 2012[/tpl]
Amidst creative differences within the group, Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985, and began a legal battle with the remaining band members regarding their continued use of the name and material.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|pp=240–241[/tpl] In December 1985, Waters "issued a statement to EMI and CBS invoking the 'Leaving Member' clause" on his contract. In October 1986, he initiated High Court proceedings to formally dissolve the Pink Floyd partnership. In his submission to the High Court he called Pink Floyd a "spent force creatively".[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|pp=221, 237, 240–241, 246[/tpl] Gilmour and Mason opposed the application and announced their intention to continue as Pink Floyd. Waters claims to have been forced to resign much like Wright some years earlier, and he decided to leave Pink Floyd based on legal considerations, stating " ... because, if I hadn't, the financial repercussions would have wiped me out completely."[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 312–313[/tpl] In December 1987, an agreement between Waters and Pink Floyd was reached.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|pp=240–241[/tpl] According to Mason:
[tpl]quote|We eventually formalised a settlement with Roger. On Christmas Eve, 1987, ... David and Roger convened for a summit meeting on the houseboat Astoria with Jerome Walton, David's accountant. Jerome painstakingly typed out the bones of a settlement. Essentially—although there was far more complex detail—the arrangement allowed Roger to be freed from his arrangement with Steve O'Rourke, and David and me to continue working under the name Pink Floyd. In the end the court accepted Jerome's version as the final and binding document and duly stamped it.[tpl]sfn|Mason|2005|pp=293–294[/tpl][/tpl]
Waters was released from his contractual obligation with O'Rourke, and he retained the copyrights to The Wall concept and his trademarked inflatable pig.[tpl]sfn|Manning|2006|pp= 139[/tpl] The Gilmour-led Pink Floyd released two studio albums: A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987), and The Division Bell (1994). As of 2013, it is estimated that Pink Floyd have sold over 250 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million RIAA certified units sold in the US.For Pink Floyd's worldwide album sales see: [tpl]cite news| title=Pink Floyd Reunion Tops Fans' Wish List in Music Choice Survey |url= http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aOmothQgn6l4&refer=muse|publisher=Bloomberg|date= 26 September 2007|accessdate= 25 May 2012[/tpl]; [tpl]cite web|title= Pink Floyd's a dream, Zeppelin's a reality|url= http://www.timesdispatch.com/entertainment-life/pink-floyd-s-a-dream-zeppelin-s-a-reality/article_6c81c2a2-ae83-501d-b792-cc9904a9bf16.html|work=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date= 28 September 2007|accessdate= 25 May 2012[/tpl]; [tpl]cite web|title= Pink Floyd biography|url = http://www.pinkfloyd.com/history/biography.php|publisher=Official site|accessdate= 4 June 2012[/tpl]; for Pink Floyd's US album sales see: [tpl]cite web|url= http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt |title=Top Selling Artists |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|accessdate=17 October 2010[/tpl]

==1984–present: solo career==

===1984–1996===

Following the release of The Final Cut, Waters embarked on a solo career that produced three concept albums and a movie soundtrack. In 1984, he released his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, a project about a man's dreams across one night that dealt with Waters' feelings about monogamy and family life versus "the call of the wild".[tpl]sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp= 272–273[/tpl] In the end the character, Reg, chooses love and matrimony over promiscuity. The album featured guitarist Eric Clapton, jazz saxophonist David Sanborn, and artwork by Gerald Scarfe.[tpl]sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp= 272–273[/tpl] Kurt Loder described The Pros And Cons of Hitch Hiking as a "strangely static, faintly hideous record".[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 305–306[/tpl] Rolling Stone rated the album a "rock bottom" one star."[tpl]sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp= 272–273[/tpl] Years later, Mike DeGagne of Allmusic praised the album for its, "ingenious symbolism" and "brilliant use of stream of consciousness within a subconscious realm", rating it four out of five stars.[tpl]cite web|url= [tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r21602|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title= The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking |first= Mike|last= DeGagne|work= AllMusic |accessdate=17 October 2010 [/tpl] Waters began touring in support of the new album, aided by Clapton, a new band, new material, and a selection of Pink Floyd favourites. Waters débuted his tour in Stockholm on 16 June 1984. Poor ticket sales plagued the tour, and some of the larger venues had to be cancelled.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 332–333[/tpl] By his own estimate, he lost £400,000 on the tour.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p= 309[/tpl] In March 1985, Waters went to North America to play smaller venues with the Pros and Cons Plus Some Old Pink Floyd Stuff — North America Tour 1985. The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking has been certified Gold by the RIAA.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Roger%20Waters&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25 | title=RIAA Certifications| publisher=Recording Industry Association of America| accessdate=17 November 2010[/tpl]
In 1986, Waters contributed songs and a score to the soundtrack of the animated movie When the Wind Blows, based on the Raymond Briggs book of the same name. His backing band featuring Paul Carrack was credited as The Bleeding Heart Band.[tpl]sfn|Fitch|2005|p=36[/tpl] In 1987, Waters released Radio K.A.O.S., a concept album based on a mute man named Billy from an impoverished Welsh mining town who has the ability to physically tune into radio waves in his head. Billy first learns to communicate with a radio DJ, and eventually to control the world's computers. Angry at the state of the world in which he lives, he simulates a nuclear attack. Waters followed the release with a supporting tour also in 1987.[tpl]sfn|Manning|2006|p= 131[/tpl]
In November 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, and in July 1990 Waters staged one of the largest and most elaborate rock concerts in history,[tpl]sfn|Povey|Russell|1997|pp=246–247[/tpl] The Wall – Live in Berlin, on the vacant terrain between Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate. The show reported an official attendance of 200,000, though some estimates are as much as twice that, with approximately one billion television viewers.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p=346[/tpl] Leonard Cheshire asked him to do the concert to raise funds for charity. Waters' group of musicians included Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Cyndi Lauper, Bryan Adams, Scorpions, and Sinéad O'Connor. Waters also used an East German symphony orchestra and choir, a Soviet marching band, and a pair of helicopters from the US 7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron. Designed by Mark Fisher, the Wall was 25 metres tall and 170 metres long and was built across the set. Scarfe's inflatable puppets were recreated on an enlarged scale, and although many rock icons received invitations to the show, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright, did not.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 342–347[/tpl] Waters released a concert double album of the performance which has been certified platinum by the RIAA.
In 1990, Waters hired manager Mark Fenwick and left EMI for a worldwide deal with Columbia. He released his third studio album, Amused to Death, in 1992. The record is heavily influenced by the events of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the Gulf War, and a critique of the notion of war becoming the subject of entertainment, particularly on television. The title was derived from the book Amusing Ourselves to Death by Neil Postman. Patrick Leonard, who worked on A Momentary Lapse of Reason, co-produced the album. Jeff Beck played lead guitar on many of the album's tracks, which were recorded with an impressive cast of musicians at ten different recording studios.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 348–349[/tpl] It is Waters' most critically acclaimed solo recording, garnering some comparison to his previous work with Pink Floyd.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 347–352[/tpl] Waters described the record as, a "stunning piece of work", ranking the album with Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall as one of the best of his career.[tpl]sfn|Manning|2006|pp= 141, 252[/tpl] The album had one hit, the song "What God Wants, Pt. 1", which reached number 35 in the UK in September 1992 and number 5 on Billboard[tpl]'[/tpl]s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the US.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=roger-waters-p5795/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Roger Waters: Billboard Singles |work= AllMusic|accessdate=20 November 2010[/tpl] Amused to Death was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx |title=BPI Certifications|publisher=British Phonographic Industry|accessdate=2 October 2010[/tpl] Sales of Amused to Death topped out at around one million and there was no tour in support of the album. Waters would first perform material from it seven years later during his In the Flesh tour.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|pp= 323–324[/tpl] In 1996, Waters was inducted into the US and UK Rock and Roll Halls of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd.[tpl]cite web|url= http://rockhall.com/inductees/pink-floyd/timeline/ |title= Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Pink Floyd |publisher= Rock & Roll Hall of Fame|accessdate=2 October 2010[/tpl]

===1999–2004===

In 1999, after a 12-year hiatus from touring, and a seven-year absence from the music industry, Waters embarked on the In the Flesh tour, performing both solo and Pink Floyd material. The tour was a financial success in the US and though Waters had booked mostly smaller venues, tickets sold so well that many of the concerts were upgraded to larger ones.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|pp= 329–334[/tpl] The tour eventually stretched across the world and would span three years. A concert film was released on CD and DVD, named In the Flesh – Live. During the tour, he played two new songs "Flickering Flame" and "Each Small Candle" as the final encore to many of the shows. In June 2002, he completed the tour with a performance in front of 70,000 people at the Glastonbury Festival of Performing Arts, playing 15 Pink Floyd songs and five songs from his solo catalogue.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|pp=329–334[/tpl]
Miramax announced in mid-2004 that a production of The Wall was to appear on Broadway with Waters playing a prominent role in the creative direction. Reports stated that the musical contained not only the original tracks from The Wall, but also songs from Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and other Pink Floyd albums, as well as new material.[tpl]cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3539908.stm |title= Pink Floyd's Wall Broadway bound |publisher= BBC News|date= 5 August 2004 |accessdate=2 October 2010[/tpl] On the night of 1 May 2004, recorded extracts from the opera, including its overture, were played on the occasion of the Welcome Europe celebrations in the accession country of Malta. Gert Hof mixed recorded excerpts from the opera into a continuous piece of music which was played as an accompaniment to a large light and fireworks display over Grand Harbour in Valletta.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|p= 334[/tpl] In July 2004, Waters released two new tracks on the Internet: "To Kill the Child", inspired by the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and "Leaving Beirut", an anti-war song "inspired by his travels in the Middle East as a teenager".[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p=391[/tpl]

In July 2005, Waters reunited with Mason, Wright, and Gilmour for what would be their final performance together at the 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, Pink Floyd's only appearance with Waters since their final performance of The Wall at Earls Court London 24 years earlier.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|pp=237, 266–267[/tpl] They played a 23-minute set consisting of "Speak to Me/Breathe"/"Breathe (Reprise)", "Money", "Wish You Were Here", and "Comfortably Numb". Waters told the Associated Press that while the experience of playing with Pink Floyd again was positive, the chances of a bona fide reunion would be "slight" considering his and Gilmour's continuing musical and ideological differences.[tpl]sfn|Schaffner|1991|p= 308[/tpl] Though Waters had differing ideas about which songs they should play, he "agreed to roll over for one night only",[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 382–383[/tpl] Gilmour told the Associated Press, "The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that ... I've been there, I've done it."[tpl]cite web | title = Gilmour says no Pink Floyd reunion | url = http://www.today.com/id/26628516/site/todayshow/ns/today-entertainment/t/gilmour-says-no-pink-floyd-reunion/ |publisher= MSNBC| date = 9 September 2008 | accessdate =6 October 2010[/tpl] In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend of the Who.[tpl]harvnb|Blake|2008|p= 386[/tpl]
In September 2005, Waters released [tpl]lang|fr|Ça Ira[/tpl] (pronounced [tpl]IPA-fr|sa iˈʁa|[/tpl], French for "it will be fine"; Waters added the subtitle, "There is Hope"), an opera in three acts translated from the late Étienne Roda-Gil's French libretto based on the historical subject of the French Revolution.[tpl]cite journal |last1= Tsioulcas|first1= Anastasia|title= Waters' New Concept |work=Billboard|date= 27 August 2005|page=45 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=-BIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA45&dq=ca+ira+Nadine+Roda-Gil#v=onepage&q=ca%20ira%20Nadine%20Roda-Gil&f=false |accessdate=6 May 2012[/tpl] [tpl]lang|fr|Ça Ira[/tpl] was released as a double CD album, featuring baritone Bryn Terfel, soprano Ying Huang and tenor Paul Groves.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|pp= 324–325[/tpl] Set during the early French Revolution, the original libretto was co-written in French by Roda-Gil and his wife Nadine Delahaye. Waters had begun rewriting the libretto in English in 1989,[tpl]sfn|Manning|2006|p= 256[/tpl] and said about the composition: "I've always been a big fan of Beethoven's choral music, Berlioz and Borodin ... This is unashamedly romantic and resides in that early 19th-century tradition, because that's where my tastes lie in classical and choral music."[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p= 392[/tpl] Waters appeared on television to discuss the opera, but the interviews often focused instead on his relationship with Pink Floyd, something Waters would "take in stride", a sign Pink Floyd biographer Mark Blake believes to be, "a testament to his mellower old age or twenty years of dedicated psychotherapy".[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p=392[/tpl] [tpl]lang|fr|Ça Ira[/tpl] reached number 5 on the Billboard Classical Music Chart in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.billboard.com/charts/2005-10-15/classical-albums |title=Roger Waters: Ca Ira |work=Billboard|accessdate=17 February 2013[/tpl]
In June 2006, Waters commenced The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour, a two-year, world-spanning effort that began in Europe in June and North America in September. The first half of the show featured both Pink Floyd songs and Waters' solo material, while the second half included a complete live performance of the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon, the first time in over three decades that Waters had performed the album. The shows ended with an encore from the third side of The Wall. He utilised elaborate staging by concert lighting designer Marc Brickman complete with laser lights, fog machines, pyrotechnics, psychedelic projections, and inflatable floating puppets (Spaceman and Pig) controlled by a "handler" dressed as a butcher, and a full 360-degree quadraphonic sound system was used. Nick Mason joined Waters for The Dark Side of the Moon set and the encores on select 2006 tour dates.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|pp=319, 334–338[/tpl] Waters continued touring in January 2007 in Australia and New Zealand, then Asia, Europe, South America, and back to North America in June.
In March 2007, the Waters song, "Hello (I Love You)" was featured in the science fiction film The Last Mimzy. The song plays over the film's end credits. He released it as a single, on CD and via download, and described it as, "a song that captures the themes of the movie, the clash between humanity's best and worst instincts, and how a child's innocence can win the day".[tpl]cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200701/ai_n17103978/ |title= Reminder – Pink Floyd Rock Icon Roger Waters Records "Hello (I Love You)", an Original Song for New Line Cinema's "The Last Mimzy" |publisher= Marketwire |date=January 2007|accessdate=17 October 2010[/tpl] He performed at California's Coachella Festival in April 2008 and was to be among the headlining artists performing at Live Earth 2008 in Mumbai, India in December 2008,[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.nme.com/news/roger-waters/41209|title=Pink Floyd's Roger Waters to join Bon Jovi at Live Earth India|work=NME|date=21 November 2008|accessdate=2 October 2010[/tpl] but that concert was cancelled in light of the 26 November terrorist attacks in Mumbai.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/dec/01/live-earth-india-cancelled|title=Live Earth India cancelled after Mumbai attacks|first= Sean |last= Michaels|date= 1 December 2008|work=The Guardian|accessdate=18 October 2010|location=London[/tpl]

Waters told the Associated Press that The Wall Tour will likely be his last, stating: "I'm not as young as I used to be. I'm not like B.B. King, or Muddy Waters. I'm not a great vocalist or a great instrumentalist or whatever, but I still have the fire in my belly, and I have something to say.

==Personal life==

In 1969, Waters married his childhood sweetheart Judy Trim, a successful potter; she was featured on the gatefold sleeve of the original release of Ummagumma, but excised from subsequent CD reissues.[tpl]sfn|Mabbett|2010|p=50[/tpl] They had no children together and divorced in 1975.[tpl]sfn|Fitch|2005|p=335[/tpl] Trim died in 2001.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p=376[/tpl]
In 1976, Waters married Lady Carolyne Christie, the niece of the 3rd Marquess of Zetland.[tpl]sfn|Fitch|2005|p=335[/tpl] His marriage to Christie produced a son, Harry Waters, a musician who has played keyboards with his father's touring band since 2006, and a daughter, India Waters, who has worked as a model.[tpl]harvnb|Blake|2008|p=258[/tpl]: India Waters; [tpl]harvnb|Povey|2008|pp=335–339[/tpl]: Harry has performed with Waters since 2006. Christie and Waters divorced in 1992.[tpl]sfn|Fitch|2005|p=335[/tpl] In 1993, he married Priscilla Phillips; they had one son together, Jack Fletcher. Their marriage ended in 2001.[tpl]harvnb|Blake|2008|p=348[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Thompson|2013|p=109[/tpl]: Jack Fletcher.

==Activism==

After the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and subsequent tsunami disaster, Waters performed "Wish You Were Here" with Eric Clapton during a benefit concert on the American network NBC.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.today.com/id/6828271/site/todayshow/ns/today-entertainment/t/stars-lend-hand-tsunami-relief/ |title=Stars lend a hand for tsunami relief |publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2 October 2010[/tpl] He was outspoken against the Hunting Act of 2004, and performed a concert for, and attended marches supporting, the Countryside Alliance. Waters explained:
[tpl]quote|I've become disenchanted with the political and philosophical atmosphere in England. The anti-hunting bill was enough for me to leave England. I did what I could, I did a concert and one or two articles, but it made me feel ashamed to be English. I was in Hyde Park for both the Countryside Alliance marches. There were hundreds of thousands of us there. Good, honest English people. That's one of the most divisive pieces of legislation we've ever had in Great Britain. It's not a case of whether or not I agree with fox hunting, but I will defend to the hilt their right to take part in it.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p= 391[/tpl][/tpl]
In October 2005, he clarified: "I come back to the UK quite often. I didn't leave as a protest against the hunting ban; I was following a child in the wake of a divorce."[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/roger-waters-french-revolution-509524.html |work=The Independent |title=Roger Waters: French Revolution|date=4 October 2005|accessdate=17 October 2010|location=London[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] After leaving Britain, he moved to Long Island in New York with his fiancé Laurie Durning.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 391–392[/tpl] In June 2007, Waters became a spokesman for Millennium Promise, a non-profit organisation that helps fight extreme poverty and malaria. He wrote an opinion piece for CNN in support of the topic.[tpl]cite news|url= http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/06/08/waters.commentary/index.html |title= Waters: Something can be done about extreme poverty|publisher= CNN|first=Roger|last=Waters|date=11 June 2007|accessdate=18 October 2010[/tpl] In July, he participated in the American leg of the Live Earth concert, an international multi-venue concert aimed at raising awareness about global climate change, featuring the Trenton Youth Choir and his trademarked inflatable pig. Waters told David Fricke why he thinks The Wall is still relevant today:
[tpl]quote|The loss of a father is the central prop on which Wall'' stands. As the years go by, children lose their fathers again and again, for nothing. You see it now with all these fathers, good men and true, who lost their lives and limbs in Iraq for no reason at all. I've done Bring The Boys Back Home in my encore on recent tours. It feels more relevant and poignant to be singing that song now than it did in 1979.[tpl]sfn|Fricke|2009|p=74[/tpl][/tpl]
In 2012, Waters led a benefit for United States military veterans called Stand Up for Heroes. He invited a music group of combat wounded veterans called MusiCorps to perform with him.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/09/roger-waters-veterans-stand-up-for-heroes-benefit_n_2099380.html|last=Carucci|first=John|title=Roger Waters & Veterans Perform Together At Stand Up for Heroes Benefit|work=Huffington Post|date=9 November 2012|accessdate=19 May 2013[/tpl] In June 2013, Waters and numerous other celebrities appeared in a video showing support for Bradley Manning.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/celebrity-bradley-manning-video-93041.html#ixzz2WgfpNmys|last=Gavin|first=Patrick|date=19 June 2013|title=Celeb video: 'I am Bradley Manning'|publisher=Politico[/tpl]

==Political views==

Waters has been outspoken about Middle Eastern politics, and in June 2009 he openly opposed the Israeli West Bank barrier, calling it an "obscenity that should be torn down".[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/06/roger-waters-to-israel-tear-down-the-wall/ |title= Roger Waters to Israel: Tear Down the Wall |first= Scott |last= Thil |publisher=Wired News |date= 2 June 2009|accessdate=14 October 2010[/tpl] Later that year, he pledged his support to the Gaza Freedom March, and in 2011 he announced that he had joined the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel.For Waters' support of the BDS movement see: [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/culture/roger-waters-voices-support-for-israel-boycott-1.347411 |title= Roger Waters voices support for Israel boycott|work=Haaretz|date= 6 March 2011|accessdate=6 March 2011[/tpl]; For Waters' support of the Gaza Freedom March see: [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/12/30/roger_waters |last= Goodman|first=Amy|title= EXCLUSIVE...Pink Floyd's Roger Waters Speaks Out in Support of Gaza Freedom March, Blasts Israeli-Egyptian "Siege" of Gaza|publisher=Democracy Now! |date=30 December 2009 |accessdate=3 March 2012[/tpl] Waters spoke about his support for BDS, stating that he has "been very disillusioned with UK foreign policy ... since Wilson.

In October 2010, after using images of the Star of David during performances of The Wall, Waters drew criticisms that led him to write an open letter to The Independent in which he commented:  "If I don't respond, people will see the story and will come to believe I'm anti-Semitic, and I'm not. Nothing could be further from the truth." He explained that the artwork used during his shows is "representative of religious and national and commercial interests, all of which have a malign influence on our lives and prevent us from treating each other decently". He added: "You can attack Israeli policy without being anti-Jewish ... It's like saying if you criticise the US policy you are being anti-Christian. I'm critical of the Israeli policy of occupying Palestinian land and their policy of building settlements, which is entirely illegal under international law, and also of ghettoising the people whose land they are building on ... It's that foreign policy I'm against. It's nothing to do with the religion."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Music/Roger-Waters-Im-not-anti-Semitic-Im-anti-occupation|last=Harkov|first=Lahav|title=Roger Waters: I'm not anti-Semitic, I'm anti-occupation|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=5 October 2010[/tpl] In March 2013, during an interview with Electronic Intifada, Waters stated that the American media "was under instructions from somewhere not to report of Israel to the American public, on what grounds I cannot guess."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/apr/5/pink-floyds-roger-waters-who-pro-palestinian-abrup/|title=Pink Floyd's Roger Waters, who is pro-Palestinian, abruptly cancels Jewish stop|last=Chumley|first=Cheryl|work=The Washington Times|date=5 April 2013[/tpl]
On 20 July 2013, during a concert in Belgium, Waters' road crew released a pig-shaped balloon that had been painted with a Star of David along with several other political symbols, including fascist, communist and capitalist representations. As the balloon floated over the audience, Waters sang the lyrics to "In the Flesh": "get him up against the wall, that one looks Jewish and that one's a coon, who let all of this riff-raff into the room" while holding "a machine gun replica and wearing a long black leather jacket with a red-and-white arm band reminiscent of a Nazi uniform."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.538001|title=Roger Waters concert features Nazi-like uniform, pig balloon with Jewish symbol|date=25 July 2013|work=Haaretz[/tpl] Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center criticized him by stating "Waters deployed a classic disgusting medieval anti-Semitic caricature widely used by both Nazi and Soviet propaganda to incite hatred against Jews."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&b=8486393&ct=13225101|title=Wiesenthal Center: By Floating a Pig Balloon Stamped With Star of David at His Concert, Roger Waters Has Moved to the Front of the Line of Anti-Semites|date=24 July 2013|publisher=The Simon Wiesenthal Center[/tpl]
Waters responded to the accusations, characterizing Cooper's statement as "wild and bigoted" with an "entirely predictable resulting rant."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/roger-waters-addresses-star-of-david-controversy-20130802|title=Roger Waters Addresses Star of David Controversy|date=2 August 2013|last=Cubarrubia|first=RJ|work=Rolling Stone[/tpl] Waters commented: "I should point out that in the show, I also use the Crucifix, the Crescent and Star, the Hammer and Sickle, the Shell Oil Logo and the McDonald’s Sign, a Dollar Sign and a Mercedes sign." Waters explained that his father had died fighting Nazis and that he grew up in post-war England, receiving an in-depth education about the war: "I was spared no horrific detail of the heinous crimes committed in the name of that most foul ideology." Waters stated that the Wall Show: "is many things. It is thoughtful, life affirming, ecumenical, humane, loving, anti-war, anti-colonial, pro-universal access to the law, pro-liberty, pro-collaboration, pro-dialogue, pro-peace, anti-authoritarian, anti-fascist, anti-apartheid, anti-dogma, international in spirit, musical and satirical. It is not anti-Semitic or pro-Nazi." Waters clarified his position regarding the use of religious imagery: "the Star of David represents Israel and its policies and is legitimately subject to any and all forms of non violent protest." Waters stated that the pig balloon represents "the evil of errant government." He added: "For the sake of some perspective. The inflatable pig ... has appeared at every Wall Show since September 2010, some 193 shows and yours is the first complaint."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/news/2013/08/01/roger-waters-responds-to-accusations-of-anti-semitism#.UfrJZ9Lrx2U|title=Roger Waters Responds to Accusations of Anti-Semitism|publisher=jambands.com|date=1 August 2013[/tpl] Michael Freilich, editor-in-chief of the Jewish monthly Joods Actueel, called for the Belgian government to issue a statement condemning what he described as "an anti-Semitic display" at the concert.

During a December 2013 interview in CounterPunch magazine, Waters made statements urging musicians to boycott Israel in response to their continued occupation of Palestine.

==Equipment and instruments==

Waters' primary instrument in Pink Floyd was the electric bass guitar.
