(29075) 1950 DA is a near-Earth asteroid.  It is notable for having the highest known probability of impacting Earth. In 2002, it had the highest Palermo rating with a value of 0.17 for a possible collision in 2880. This potential impact was ruled out in late 2013, as more information on the asteroid's trajectory and physical properties became available.

==Discovery and name==

1950 DA was first discovered on February 23, 1950, by Carl A. Wirtanen at Lick Observatory. It was observed for seventeen days and then lost because the short observation arc resulted in large uncertainties in Wirtanen's orbital solution. On December 31, 2000, it was recovered as [tpl]mp|2000 YK|66[/tpl] and two hours later was recognized as 1950 DA.

==Observations==

On March 5, 2001, 1950 DA made a close approach to Earth of [tpl]convert|0.0520726|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on[/tpl]. It was studied by radar at the Goldstone and Arecibo observatories from March 3 to 7, 2001.
The studies showed that the asteroid has a mean diameter of 1.1–1.4 km. Optical lightcurve analysis by Lenka Sarounova and Petr Pravec shows that its rotation period is 2.1216 ± 0.0001 hours. Due to its short rotation period and high radar albedo, 1950 DA is thought to be fairly dense (more than 3 g/cm³) and likely composed of nickel–iron.1950DA Planning on the NASA Web site (last accessed on October 7, 2007).

==Possible Earth impact==

That 1950 DA has one of the best-determined asteroid orbital solutions is due to a combination of:
Main-belt asteroid 78 Diana (~125 km in diameter) will pass about [tpl]convert|0.003|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on[/tpl] from 1950 DA on August 5, 2150. At that distance and size, Diana will perturb 1950 DA enough so that the change in trajectory is notable by 2880 (730 years later).
If 1950 DA continues on its present orbit, it will approach Earth on March 16, 2880. However, over the intervening time, its rotation will cause its orbit to slightly change as a result of the Yarkovsky effect. Available radar and optical data suggest two possible pole directions and corresponding trajectories. Both trajectories pass many millions of kilometers from Earth, so 1950 DA does not have a significant chance of impacting Earth.
Knowledge of 1950 DA's trajectory has improved with time. In 2002, it had the highest Palermo rating with a value of 0.17 for a possible collision in 2880. Modeling suggests 1950 DA is a retrograde rotator. In mid-2013, the odds of an Earth impact in 2880 were estimated as 1 in 2,270 (0.044%) with a Palermo rating of −0.58. A new analysis of DA's trajectory in October 2013, including additional radar astrometry from Arecibo in 2012 and an updated set of predictions of Earth's orbit and those of the other planets (DE431) ruled out the 2880 impact entirely.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
The energy released by a collision with an object the size of 1950 DA would cause major effects on the climate and biosphere, which would be devastating to human civilization. The discovery of the potential impact heightened interest in asteroid deflection strategies.
