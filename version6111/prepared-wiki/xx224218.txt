[[K-Poincaré group]]

CATEGORIES: Hopf algebras, Mathematical physics

In physics and mathematics, the κ-Poincaré group, named after Henri Poincaré, is a quantum group, obtained by deformation of the Poincaré group into an Hopf algebra.
The commutation rules reads:
and the commutation rules reads:
The coproducts are classical, and encode the group composition law:
Also the antipodes and the counits are classical, and represent the group inversion law and the map to the identity:
The κ-Poincaré group is the dual Hopf algebra to the K-Poincaré algebra, and can be interpreted as its “finite” version.
