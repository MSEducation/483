CATEGORIES: Aromatase inhibitors

Formestane (Lentaron) is a type I, steroidal aromatase inhibitor.  It is used in the treatment of estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer in post-menopausal women.  It is available as an intramuscular depot injection.
Formestane is often used to suppress estrogen production from anabolic steroids or prohormones.  It also acts as a prohormone to 4-hydroxytestosterone, an active steroid which displays weak androgenic activity in addition to acting as a mild aromatase inhibitor.
Formestane has poor oral bioavailability and as such is no longer popular as many orally active aromatase inhibitors have been identified.
It is selective.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pérez Carrión R, Alberola Candel V, Calabresi F, et al. |title=Comparison of the selective aromatase inhibitor formestane with tamoxifen as first-line hormonal therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer |journal=Ann.
