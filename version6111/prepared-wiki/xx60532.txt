[[Ineffable cardinal]]

CATEGORIES: Large cardinals

In the mathematics of transfinite numbers, an ineffable cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number, introduced by [tpl]harvtxt|Jensen|Kunen|1969[/tpl].
Totally ineffable cardinals are of greater consistency strength than subtle cardinals and of lesser consistency strength than remarkable cardinals. A list of large cardinal axioms by consistency strength is available  here.
