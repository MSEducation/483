==History==

===Early years (1996–2000)===

Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends; Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson.AskMen.com, Linkin Park – Biography Retrieved March 20, 2007 The three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, an affluent suburb of Los Angeles. After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave "Phoenix" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda’s makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a 4-track demo tape, entitled as Xero.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.popstarsplus.com/music_linkinpark_history.htm|title=Linkin Park — band history and biography|accessdate=December 23, 2007[/tpl] Tensions and frustration within the band grew however after they failed to land a record deal. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band's vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects. Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax and other bands.MusicMight.com, Linkin Park – MusicMight Biography Retrieved March 20, 2007Livedaily.com, [tpl]Wayback |date=20070112192536 |url=http://www.livedaily.com/interviews/liveDaily_Interview_Linkin_Parks_Dave_Phoenix_Farrell-6078.html?t=6 |title=LiveDaily Interview: Linkin Park’s Dave 'Phoenix' Farrell[/tpl] Retrieved March 20, 2007
After spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Arizona vocalist, Chester Bennington, who was recommended by Jeff Blue, the vice president of Zomba Music in March 1999.Lptimes.com, Band History Retrieved March 20, 2007 Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge band by the name of Grey Daze,  became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style. The band then agreed on changing its name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material. In 1999 they released an extended play named after the group, which they plugged into internet chat-rooms and developed an informal 'street team' from the on-line community to spread the music.[tpl]cite book|last=Saulmon|first=Greg |title=Linkin Park; Contemporary musicians and their music|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2006|pages=19–20|isbn=9781404207134|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cwuqmz_O5EkC&pg=PA1980&dq=%22Hybrid+Theory+(EP)%22+-inpublisher:icon&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22Hybrid%20Theory%20(EP)%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&f=false|accessdate=December 28, 2009[/tpl] The band’s renaissance culminated with a change in name; from Hybrid Theory, the band once again changed its name, this time to Linkin Park, a play on and homage to Santa Monica’s Lincoln Park.AskMen.com, Linkin Park — Biography Retrieved March 20, 2007 The band initially wanted to utilize the name "Lincoln Park", however they changed it to "Linkin" to acquire the internet domain "linkinpark.com".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/a-conversation-with-linki_b_1700451.html |title=A Conversation With Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda, Plus Chatting With VideofyMe's Oskar Glauser and The Villains and Ben Arthur Exclusives |author=Ragogna, Mike |date=July 25, 2012 |work=The Huffington Post |publisher=AOL |accessdate=January 31, 2013[/tpl] However, despite these changes, the band still struggled to sign a record deal.

In Minutes to Midnight the band experimented with their established sound and drew influences from a wider and more varied range of genres and styles, a process Los Angeles Times compares to a stage in U2's work. In it, only two of the songs feature rapping, and the majority of the album can be considered alternative rock.IGN, Linkin Park – Minutes To Midnight.
