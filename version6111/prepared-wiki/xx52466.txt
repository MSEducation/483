[[List of British heritage and private railways]]

CATEGORIES: Heritage railways in the United Kingdom, Lists of heritage railways, Lists of railway lines in Great Britain

This is a list of heritage, private and preserved railways in the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands that are privately owned, kept or preserved, built, constructed and run for railway heritage and/or profit, not necessarily providing a meaningful public transportation service. For rail museums, see List of British railway museums.
Many of the standard-gauge railways (thus including former ex-branch lines and former ex-mainline routes) listed were originally closed by British Railways (later shortened to British Rail) under the Beeching Cuts in the 1960s, although lines closed in subsequent decades have also been subject to restoration and operation as private or preserved heritage lines.  A smaller number of lines were formerly industrial or colliery railways.
Many of these preserved railways, heritage lines and railway centres alike are popular tourist attractions and make significant contributions to their local economies.

Tramway operation in Britain ceased almost entirely in the 1950s. Once Glasgow had disposed of its lines, the sole survivor was the Blackpool Corporation Tramways, although considerably reduced in size. In the late 20th century there was a tramway revival, notably in Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield, the West Midlands and Croydon.
In addition, preserved trams operate at:
