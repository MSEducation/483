The King of the Romanians (Romanian: Regele Românilor),[tpl]cite web |url=http://geocities.com/romaniancoins/100lei1939.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091027152147/http://geocities.com/romaniancoins/100lei1939.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |title=Gold set 1939 |publisher=Romanian Coins[/tpl] was the sovereign ruler of the Kingdom of Romania from 1881 until 1947, when Romania was proclaimed a People's Republic following Michael I's forced abdication.

==History==

The state had been internationally recognized as a Principality since 1862, after the creation of the United Principalities, a personal union between Moldavia and Wallachia, at that time vassal states of the Ottoman Empire. Alexander I became Domnitor (ruling prince) after the official unification of the two formerly separate states, being elected prince of both states in 1859. He was deposed in 1866 by a broad coalition of the main political parties, after which Parliament offered the throne to Karl Hohenzollern who subsequently became the new "Domnitor of Romania" (as Carol I).
Romania's independence from the Ottoman Empire was recognized in 1878 by the Treaty of Berlin.  In an expression of full sovereignty, the principality was elevated to a kingdom in 1881, with Carol I becoming King of the Romanians.[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/reminiscencesofk00kremiala |title=Reminiscences of the King of Roumania |first1=Mite |last1=Kremnitz |first2=Sidney |last2=Sidney Whitman |publisher=Harper& Brothers |year=1899[/tpl]
In 1927, Ferdinand I died, and the country was left in the care of a Regency headed by Nicholas Hohenzollern, during the young reign of Michael I (who was only six years old at the time), despite Carol II being his father. Carol II, unlike Carol I, in the beginning had no desire to rule Romania, and was frequently out of the country exploring the rest of Europe with his mistress. Michael's first reign would be short lived at only three years, until his father Carol II came back to contest the title at the behest of a dissatisfied political faction that staged a sudden 'coup d'état' (in spite of the fact that only a few years earlier he had renounced in official documents, written and signed in front of his own father, all his future claims to the throne of Romania).
After a ten-year rule, Carol II gave up his royal title to be able to leave Romania and marry his mistress Elena Lupescu. The couple ultimately settled in Portugal, and the 'playboy king' was never recalled back to Romania.
The kingdom of Romania was a constitutional monarchy for most of its existence with the exception of 1938–1944, during the dictatorships of Carol II (1938–1940) and Ion Antonescu (1940–1944). On 23 August 1944, Michael I restored the last democratic royal Constitution of 1923. However, during his second reign (1940–1947), Michael I reigned mostly as an unconstitutional king, without a constitutional oath or a parliamentary vote. Parliament was initially suspended and reinstated only later, in 1946. Michael I was instead crowned[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.familiaregala.ro/upload/p0002_FundamentalRules.pdf |title=Fundamental Rules of the Royal Family of Romania |publisher=The Romanian Royal Family website[/tpl] and anointed by the Orthodox Patriarch, Nicodim Munteanu, in the Patriarchal Cathedral of Bucharest, on the day of his second accession, 6 September 1940."The Joys of Suffering," Volume 2, "Dialogue with a few intellectuals", by Rev.

On 23 August 1944, with the Soviet Army already deep inside Romania's territory, Michael I deposed the German-allied dictator Ion Antonescu at the urging of the opposition parties and aligned the country with the Allies. Helped by the presence of Soviet forces, communists gradually took control of the administration. On 30 December 1947 Michael I abdicated and left Romania at the request of the communist-dominated government, while Parliament proclaimed the country a people's republic.
After the Revolution of 1989, the former King visited Romania to an enthusiastic reception in the streets of Bucharest, however the country preserved its republican character.
