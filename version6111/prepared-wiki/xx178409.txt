Joseph Li Shan (born c. 1965; [tpl]zh|c=李山|p=Lǐ Shān[/tpl]) is the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Beijing, China. He was consecrated a bishop on 21 September 2007, at age 42 at a ceremony at Nan Tang (South Cathedral) at Xuanwumen.  The ceremony drew little public attention, with Catholics numbering around 60,000 faithful among Beijing's 15 million people.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
Archbishop Li's appointment was approved by the Vatican, and he is thus one of the minority of the Catholic bishops in China who are in full communion with Rome. This approval was granted before his ordination, as happened for several other in the early years of the 21st century, unlike others, of an earlier period, of whom Pope Benedict XVI wrote that they, "under the pressure of particular circumstances, have consented to receive episcopal ordination without the pontifical mandate, but have subsequently asked to be received into communion with the Successor of Peter and with their other brothers in the episcopate. The Pope, considering the sincerity of their sentiments and the complexity of the situation, and taking into account the opinion of neighbouring Bishops, by virtue of his proper responsibility as universal Pastor of the Church, has granted them the full and legitimate exercise of episcopal jurisdiction."Letter of 27 May 2007 to the Bishops, Priests, Consecrated Persons and Lay Faithful of the Catholic Church in the People's Republic of China
Sources close to Cardinal Joseph Zen have nevertheless criticized Archbishop Li Shan because of an alleged tendency to compromise with the Chinese Communist Party and Patriotic Church.The bishop of Beijing, the Vatican and compromising with the Patriotic Association
