[[Corcadorca Theatre Company]]

CATEGORIES: Theatre companies in the Republic of Ireland, County Cork

The Corcadorca Theatre Company was founded in Cork in 1991 and is one of Ireland's leading independent theatre companies.
The company strives to be integral part of the cultural life of the city, and has sought to develop new writing through its biennial Corcadorca Playwright Award, and by commissioning new work from more established writers (Disco Pigs by Enda Walsh, and Bruen's Twist by Eamonn Sweeney).
The company has also served as a base for some renowned acting talent, including Cillian Murphy (Disco Pigs, Batman Begins, Girl with a Pearl Earring).
The name of the company is from the Irish Corca Dhorcha, or "dark" Corca, a play on words of Corca Dhuibhne, the Dingle Peninsula, portrayed (jokingly) as a backward area of country bumpkins. The Irish word dorcha (meaning "dark"), also has the extended meanings such as "ignorant," "unlettered," or "uneducated," and is the origin of the English slang word dork.
