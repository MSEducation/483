==History==

The first recorded European visitor to the area was Charles Winnecke in 1878.  In 1916 the chief surveyor of the Northern Territory, T. E. Day surveyed the range and named it Dulcie  after one of his daughters.  Around 1920 an early pastoral lease was taken out at Old Huckitta station, the remains of which are within the southern boundary of the park.  
There was an established population of traditional aboriginal Akarre Arrernte people, evidenced by numerous rock art sites in the Dulcie Ranges.  A plentiful supply of food resources and water supported the clans.Dulcie Range Plan of Management (updated 04 Jan 2013)
