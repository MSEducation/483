==Accreditation and affiliation==

The University is affiliated with the International Management Association of Hong Kong, which also identifies American City University as an affiliate.International Management Association website, accessed April 22, 2010
Until 2005 the University was a full institutional member of the International Council for Open and Distance Education (ICDE), which only admits institutions in good standing but is not an accreditation body.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.icde.org/en/about/membership/criteria/ |publisher=International Council for Open and Distance Education |title=Membership Criteria[/tpl] In its advertising Honolulu University at one time claimed accreditation by "Akademie für Internationale Kultur- und Wissenschaftsförderung", which was not a generally recognized accrediting body in Europe and apparently also is defunct, if it ever existed.

==Events==

The institution received media attention because of lawsuits resulting from irregularities related to school agents in Asia who failed to properly disclose the unaccredited status of the school to prospective students. The school lost in court and the Hawaii Office of Consumer Protection was at one time processing requests for tuition refunds. Honolulu University in turn sued their Singaporean agent, who in the meantime had died.Honolulu University sues dead Singapore agent, October 15, 2006
