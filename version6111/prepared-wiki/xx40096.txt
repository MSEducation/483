Dorothy Kathleen Broster (2 September 1877 â€“ 7 February 1950), usually known as D.K. Broster, was a British novelist and short-story writer, born in Garston, Liverpool at Devon Lodge (now known as Monksferry House), which lies in Grassendale Park on the banks of the River Mersey.1881 England Census Educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College and St Hilda's College, Oxford [ref]Lorna Sage,  The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English

co-written with Gertrude Winifred Taylor; Chantemerle: A Romance of the Vendean War and The Vision Splendid
(about the Tractarian Movement).
Following the war she returned to Oxford where she worked as a secretary to the Regius Professor of History and senior civil servants.  She produced her best-seller about
Scottish history,  The Flight of the Heron, in 1925. Broster stated she had consulted
eighty reference books before beginning the novel.[ref]Diana Wallace,

(p. 7, 29)[/ref] Broster followed it up with two successful sequels, The Gleam in the North and The Dark Mile.  She wrote several other historical novels, successful and much reprinted in their day, although this Jacobite Trilogy, featuring the dashing hero Ewen Cameron, remain the best known.  The Flight of the Heron has been made into a TV serial twice: by Scottish Television in eight episodes in 1968, and by the BBC in 1976.
The poet Patricia Beer was an admirer of Broster's novels, stating she had been fascinated by The Flight of the Heron when she read it aged thirteen.
Broster also wrote several short horror stories, collected in "A Fire of Driftwood" and 
Couching at the Door.Mike Ashley , Who's Who in Horror and Fantasy Fiction.  Elm Tree Books, 1977. ISBN 0-241-89528-6. (p.44)
The title story of "Couching at the Door" involves an artist haunted by a mysterious entity. Other supernatural
tales include "Clairvoyance", about a psychic girl, (1932), and "Juggernaut" (1935) about a 
haunted chair.Jack Adrian, "Broster, D(orothy) K(athleen)", in David Pringle, ed., St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers. London: St. James Press, 1998. (pp. 95-97) ISBN 1558622063 Jack Adrian describes
Couching at the Door as  "a pure masterwork, one of the most satisfying weird collections of the century".
Broster was a private individual who avoided publicity; during her lifetime, many of her readers wrongly assumed she was
both male and Scottish.
