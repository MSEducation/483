Shuva ([tpl]lang-he-n|שׁוּבָה[/tpl]) is a religious moshav in southern Israel. Located near Netivot and covernig 4,500 dunams, it falls under the jurisdiction of Sdot Negev Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 393.
The village was established in 1950 by immigrants from Tripoli in Libya. They were later joined by more immigrants from Algeria and Tunisia. However, this created tensions between the residents, and in 1957 the moshav split in two, with the Tunisian residents leaving to form Zimrat.
Its name is taken from Psalms 126:4;
 Turn our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the dry land.
