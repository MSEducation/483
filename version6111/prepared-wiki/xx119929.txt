Asier Riesgo Unamuno (born 6 October 1983 in Deba, Gipuzkoa) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for CA Osasuna as a goalkeeper.

==Football career==

A product of Real Sociedad's youth ranks, Riesgo made his professional debuts with neighbour side SD Eibar in the second division, where he would play during one 1/2 seasons, being recalled in March 2004 due to an injury to first-choice Sander Westerveld. In the dying stages of the 2003–04 season he made his La Liga debut, playing against Deportivo Alavés on 19 May.
After Westerveld was waived in the summer, Riesgo became the Basque outfit's starter, but would have to battle with newly signed Claudio Bravo in the 2006–07 campaign. With the Chilean as the first-choice, Real was eventually relegated.
In 2007–08, however, Riesgo played in all 42 league games, although the club did not achieve a top flight return. In August 2008 he was loaned to Recreativo de Huelva for €350.000, with the team having the option to make the move permanent afterwards for €4.3 million and not having to pay the player's wages.Badiola cierra la cesión de Riesgo a espaldas de los administradores (Badiola closes Riesgo loan deal without the board of directors' knowledge); Diario Vasco, 4 August 2008 [tpl]es icon[/tpl]
