The 2012 Olympic Marathon Course is that of both the men's and women's marathon races at the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in London. 
The [tpl]convert|42.195|km|adj=on|abbr=off[/tpl] route consists of one short circuit of [tpl]convert|3.571|km|abbr=off[/tpl] followed by three circuits of [tpl]convert|12.875|km|abbr=off|1[/tpl]. The course, which was designed to pass many of London's well-known landmarks, starts and finishes on The Mall, within sight of Buckingham Palace, and extends as far as the Tower of London in the east and the Victoria Memorial in the west. 
The route of the marathon had been changed, for various logistical reasons, from that originally envisaged in London's original 2005 bid for the Games and now breaks with the normal Olympic tradition that the race finishes inside the main Olympic Stadium.
The 2012 Summer Olympics is the third to be held in London. The stated distance of the marathon at the London 1908 Summer Olympics[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] 26 miles and 385 yards, later converted to metric units as 42.195 kilometres [tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] formed the basis of the standard distance adopted by International Association of Athletics Federations in 1921.
