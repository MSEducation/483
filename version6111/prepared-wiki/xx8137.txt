Muttiah Muralitharan ([tpl]lang-ta|முத்தையா முரளிதரன்[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-si|මුත්තයියා මුරලිදරන්[/tpl]; also spelt Muralidaran; born [tpl]Nowrap|17 April[/tpl] 1972) is a Sri Lankan cricketer who was rated the greatest Test match bowler ever by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 2002. He retired from Test cricket in 2010, registering his 800th and final wicket on 22 July 2010 from his final ball in his last Test match.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/2572069.stm |title=Murali 'best bowler ever' |work=BBC Sport   |date=2002-12-13 |accessdate=2007-12-14 | location=London[/tpl]

Muralitharan's career was beset by controversy over his bowling action for much of his international career. Due to an unusual hyperextension of his congenitally bent arm during delivery, his bowling action was called into question on a number of occasions by umpires and sections of the cricket community.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22577477-5001505,00.html |title=Bending law aided Murali: Gillespie |first=Malcolm |last=Conn |work=The Australian |date=2007-10-13 |accessdate=2007-12-14[/tpl] After biomechanical analysis under simulated playing conditions, Muralitharan's action was cleared by the International Cricket Council, first in 1996 and again in 1999.

In February 2009, after becoming cricket's highest wicket-taker in both forms of the game Muttiah Muralitharan hinted that he might retire at the conclusion of the 2011 World Cup. He stated "I think I am fit in my body and mind, I am enjoying my cricket and want to play more. But after the next World Cup, I will have nothing left to achieve in the game.

==Early years and personal life==

Muralitharan was born in Kandy, the eldest of the four sons to Sinnasamy Muttiah and Lakshmi. Muralitharan's father Sinnasamy Muttiah, runs a successful biscuit-making business.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www-ieem.ust.hk/dfaculty/ravi/cricket/apr26-98.html|title='Murali' – bowling wizard of international fame|first=M. B. |last=Dassanayake |work=Sunday Observer |date=1998-04-26 |accessdate=2008-02-11[/tpl]
When he was nine years old Muralitharan was sent to St. Anthony's College, Kandy, a private school run by Benedictine monks. He began his cricketing career as a medium pace bowler but on the advice of his school coach, Sunil Fernando, he took up off-spin when he was fourteen years old. He soon impressed and went on to play for four years in the school First XI. In those days he played as an all-rounder and batted in the middle order. In his final two seasons at St Anthony's College he took over one hundred wickets and in 1990/1 was named as the 'Bata Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year'.
After leaving school he joined Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club and was selected for the Sri Lanka A tour of England in 1991. He played in five games but failed to capture a single wicket. On his return to Sri Lanka he impressed against Allan Border's Australian team in a practice game and then went on to make his Test debut at R. Premadasa Stadium in the Second Test Match of the series.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://ganeshyamalabittu.tripod.com/heroes/id19.html|title=Heroes Muttiah Muralitharan Profile|accessdate=2008-02-12[/tpl]
When his grandfather died at the age of 104 in July 2004, Muralitharan returned home from a tour of India to attend his funeral. Periyasamy Sinasamy's first wish to see Muralitharan claiming the world record for the most Test wickets was realised (passing the record set by Courtney Walsh), but not his desire to live to see his grandson married. Muralitharan's grandmother had died one month earlier at the age of 97. Muralitharan's manager, Kushil Gunasekera stated that "Murali's family is closely knit and united. They respect traditional values. The late grandfather enjoyed a great relationship with Murali."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/07/29/stories/2004072902152100.htm|title=Murali's grandfather's unfulfilled wish|work=The Hindu |date=2004-07-29 |accessdate=2008-01-18|location=Chennai, India[/tpl]

Muttiah announced on 3 April 2011 that he was retiring from all sport.

==Spelling and meaning of name==

Even though his name was widely romanised as Muralitharan from the start of his career, he prefers the spelling Muralidaran. The different spellings have arisen because the Tamil letter த can be pronounced as both 't' and 'd' depending on its place in a word. It is often transliterated as 'th' to distinguish it from another letter, ட, which is a retroflex 't' or 'd'. In 2007, when Cricket Australia decided to unveil the new Warne-Muralidaran Trophy, to be contested between Australia and Sri Lanka, Muralitharan was requested to clarify how his name should be spelt. Cricket Australia spokesman Peter Young confirmed that "the spelling he's given is Muralidaran".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/under-muralis-deadly-spell/2007/11/07/1194329318699.html |title=Under Murali's deadly spell|first=Martin |last=Blake |work=the age |date=2007-11-08 |accessdate=2008-02-21 | location=Melbourne[/tpl]
The first-day cover involving Muralitharan bears an official seal captioned as "The highest wicket taker in Test cricket, MUTHIAH MURALIDARAN, First Day of Issue 03.12.2007, Camp Post Office, Asgiriya International Cricket Stadium, Kandy".[tpl]cite web|url=http://i25.tinypic.com/zj84dv.jpg|title=Muralitharan First day Cover|accessdate=2008-02-22[/tpl]
The name Muralitharan is derived from murli dhar (Devnagri: मुरली धर) meaning "the bearer of the flute", which is a synonym for Lord Krishna, a deity in Hinduism who is said to play upon his bamboo flute while looking after cattle.

==Domestic cricket==

===In Sri Lanka===

In domestic cricket, Muralitharan played for two first-class Sri Lankan sides, Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club in the Premier Trophy and Central Province in the Provincial Championship. His record is exceptional – 234 wickets at 14.51 runs in 46 matches.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Lancashire/Players/2/2040/f_Bowling_by_Team.html |title=First-Class Bowling For Each Team by Muttiah Muralitharan |author=CricketArchive |publisher=Lancashire County Cricket Club |accessdate=2007-12-29[/tpl]

===In England===

He also played county cricket in England, mainly for Lancashire (1999, 2001, 2005 and 2007) where he appeared in twenty-eight first-class games for the club. He played five first class games for Kent during the 2003 season. His bowling record in English domestic cricket is also exceptional – 236 wickets at 15.62 runs in 33 matches. Despite his efforts, he was never on a title winning first-class domestic team in either the Premier Trophy or the County Championship. He was unusual amongst his contemporaries in that he played in more Test matches than other first-class games (116 Tests and 99 other first class matches as of [tpl]Nowrap|30 November[/tpl] 2007). Muralitharan had been signed by Gloucestershire in 2011 to play in T20 matches, and he also renewed his T20 contract with Gloucestershire in 2012, but did not stay for the 2013 season.

===In India===

In February 2008, Muralitharan was slated to play Twenty20 cricket for the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He was bought for $600,000 by India Cements, the Chennai franchisee of the IPL, through a bidding process.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ipl/content/current/story/338106.html|title=How the teams stack up|first=Siddhartha|last=Vaidyanathan |work=Cricinfo |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2008-02-21[/tpl] The Chennai Super Kings were the runners up in the inaugural edition of the IPL, losing to the Rajasthan Royals in the final. Muralitharan captured 11 wickets in 15 games, at an economy rate of 6.96 an over. In 2010, in the third season of IPL, Muralitharan was part of the Chennai Super Kings side that won the IPL championship.2010 Indian Premier League Muralitharan also remained the side's leading wicket-taker after all the three tournaments.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ipl-chennai/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?class=6;id=4343;type=team |title=Cricket Records | Chennai Super Kings | Records | Twenty20 matches | Most wickets |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=2011-04-01[/tpl]

Muralitharan, was contracted to represent Bengal in the 2008–09 Ranji Trophy tournament. He was expected to play about four matches in the tournament's second division – the Plate League.

===In Australia===

Muttiah Muralitharan signed for the Melbourne Renegades to play Twenty20 cricket in the Big Bash League, in 2012. He stated, 
"I wanted to play one season in Australia and the opportunity from the Melbourne Renegades was there so I took it with both hands."[tpl]cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/sports/cricket/muralitharan-to-play-for-melbourne-renegades-in-big-bash_745475.html |title= Muralitharan to play for Melbourne Renegades in Big Bash |publisher=ZEENEWS.com|accessdate=2012-07-17[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.wisdenindia.com/muralitharan-to-play-in-big-bash-league | title=Muralitharan to play in big bash league | publisher = Wisden India | date=12 July 2012[/tpl]

==International career==

===Bowling style and career progress===

Muralitharan is the first wrist-spinning off-spinner in the history of the game.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/slveng/content/story/323376.html |title=The art of the obvious |first=Suresh |last=Menon |work=Cricinfo |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate=2007-12-04[/tpl]
He bowls marathon spells, yet he is usually on the attack. His unique bowling action begins with an open-chested short run-up, and culminates with an extremely wristy release which had him mistaken for a leg-spinner early in his career by Allan Border.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/sport/story/0,6903,1258512,00.html |title=Straight man |first=Shahriar |last=Khan |work=Observer Sport |date=2004-07-11 |accessdate=2007-12-15 | location=London[/tpl] Aside from his off-break, his main deliveries are a fast topspinner which goes straight on, and the doosra, a surprise delivery which turns from leg to off (the opposite direction of his stock delivery) with no easily discernible change of action.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GDwG14GcwE|title= Visual comparison of Murali's off-break and doosra actions|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2008-01-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i8CdcjCQ8k&feature=related|title= Bowling action dissected|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2008-03-17[/tpl] His newest variation is a version of Shane Warne's slider, which is flicked out the side of his hand and rushes onto batsmen like a flipper. His super-flexible wrist makes him especially potent and guarantees him turn on any surface.
From his debut in 1992, Muralitharan took 800 Test wickets and over 500 One Day International wickets, becoming the first player to take 1,000 wickets combined in the two main forms of international cricket.

===Test cricket===

====Emerging years====

On 28 August 1992 at the age of 20, Muralitharan made his debut against Australia at the Khettarama Stadium and claimed 3 for 141. Craig McDermott was his first Test wicket. His freakish action and his angular run-up showed that this was no run-of-the-mill spinner. During his first Test, there was one dismissal which convinced many of Muralitharan's special powers. Tom Moody's leg-stump was dislodged when he shouldered arms to a delivery that pitched at least two feet outside the off-stump.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1520/15201400.htm|title=The prince of off-spin |first=Nirgunan|last=Tiruchelvam |work=Frontline |date=1998-10-09 |accessdate=2008-03-20[/tpl]
The youthful Muralitharan went from strength to strength, playing a major part in Sri Lanka's back-to-back Test victories against England and New Zealand in 1992–93. It was at this point in his career that he struck a close bond with his leader, mentor and one time business partner, the authoritative captain Arjuna Ranatunga. This relationship formed the bedrock of his success and meant that there were few doubts about his status as the team's sole wicket-taker. Ranatunga was thoroughly convinced that Muralitharan's precocious talent would signal a new era in Sri Lanka's short Test history.
In August 1993 at Moratuwa, Muralitharan captured 5 for 104 in South Africa's first innings, his first five-wicket haul in Tests. His wickets included Kepler Wessels, Hansie Cronje and Jonty Rhodes.
Muralitharan continued to baffle batsman outside the shores of Sri Lanka, irrespective of the team's performance. In Sri Lanka's humiliating drubbing at the hands of India in 1993–94, where all three Tests were innings defeats, Muralitharan was the sole success, with 12 wickets in the rubber. His perseverance in the face of some astronomical scores by the fearsome quartet of Mohammed Azharuddin, Sachin Tendulkar, Navjot Sidhu and Vinod Kambli was in sharp contrast to the submission with which his team-mates played the series.
It was in New Zealand in March 1995 that Muralitharan displayed his qualities as a match-winner on any surface. In Sri Lanka's first triumph on foreign soil, Muralitharan confused the crease-bound New Zealanders on a grassy pitch in Dunedin. The Sri Lankan manager Duleep Mendis' claim that Muralitharan can turn the ball on concrete was confirmed. On the eve of his tour of Pakistan later that year, doubts were cast on his ability to trouble subcontinental batsmen. By taking 19 wickets in the series and delivering a historic 2–1 victory, the off-spinner silenced the doubters. The Pakistanis, who had negotiated Warne's leg-breaks in the previous home series, were never at ease against him.
Prior to the eventful Boxing Day Test of 1995, Muralitharan had captured 80 wickets in 22 Tests at an unflattering average of 32.74. Even at that point in his career he was the leading wicket taker for Sri Lanka having gone past Rumesh Ratnayake's aggregate of 73 wickets.

====Boxing Day Test 1995====

During the second Test between Sri Lanka and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Boxing Day 1995, Australian umpire Darrell Hair called Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing in front of a crowd of 55,239. The off-spinner was no-balled seven times in three overs by Hair, who believed the then 23 year old was bending his arm and straightening it in the process of delivery; an illegal action in cricket.
Muralitharan had bowled two overs before lunch from umpire Steve Dunne's or the Members' End of the ground with umpire Hair at square leg and these passed without incident. At [tpl]Nowrap|2:34 pm[/tpl] he took up the attack from umpire Hair's or the southern end. Muralitharan's third over was a maiden with all deliveries again passed as legitimate but in his fourth Hair no-balled him twice for throwing on the fourth and sixth balls. The umpire continued to call him three times in his fifth over on the second, fourth and sixth balls. While the bowler stood with his hands on his hips perplexed, the five calls provoked an immediate response by the Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga who left the field at [tpl]Nowrap|3:03 pm[/tpl] in order to take advice from his team management. He returned at [tpl]Nowrap|3:08 pm[/tpl] and continued with Muralitharan who was called two more times in his sixth over on the second and sixth balls. At [tpl]Nowrap|3:17 pm[/tpl] Ranatunga removed the bowler from the attack, although he reintroduced him at [tpl]Nowrap|3:30 pm[/tpl] at umpire Dunne's end. Although Hair reports in his book, "Decision Maker", that at the end of the tea break he stated that he would call Muralitharan no matter which end he bowled he did not do so. Muralitharan completed another twelve overs without further no-balls and, after bowling Mark Waugh, finished the day with figures of 18–3–58–1.">
[/ref]
After being no-balled Muralitharan bowled a further 32 overs from umpire Steve Dunne's end without protest from either Dunne or Hair, at square leg. The Sri Lankan camp was outraged after the incident, but the ICC defended Hair, outlining a list of steps they had taken in the past to determine, without result, the legitimacy of Muralitharan's action.">
[/ref] By calling Muralitharan from the bowlers' end Hair overrode what is normally regarded as the authority of the square leg umpire in adjudicating on throwing. Dunne would have had to break convention to support his partner.
At the end of the match the Sri Lankans requested from the ICC permission to confer with Hair in order to find out exactly how to remedy the problem with their bowler. Despite the game's controlling body agreeing to it, the Australian Cricket Board vetoed it on the grounds that it might lead to umpires being quizzed by teams after every game and meant that the throwing controversy would continue into the World Series Cup during the coming week. The Sri Lankans were disappointed they did not get an explanation and decided they would continue playing their bowler in matches not umpired by Hair and wanted to know whether other umpires would support or reject Hair's judgement."/>
Muralitharan's action was cleared by the ICC after biomechanical analysis at the University of Western Australia and at the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology in 1996. They concluded that his action created the 'optical illusion of throwing'.

====Mid career====

On 16 March 1997, Muralitharan became the first Sri Lankan to reach 100 test wickets, when he dismissed Stephen Fleming in the second innings of the Hamilton Test.
In January 1998, Muralitharan took his first ten-wicket haul against Zimbabwe in the first test at Kandy. Sri Lanka won by eight wickets and Muralitharan had figures of 12 for 117.
In August that same year Muralitharan produces his career-best test match figures of 16 for 220, in the one-off test against England. In England's second innings Muralitharan bowled a marathon 54.2 overs to pick up 9 for 65 runs,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EebphFKyzwY|title=Muralitharan, 9 for 65, Oval Test |publisher=Youtube |date=2008-12-10 |accessdate=2009-02-10[/tpl] the other wicket being a run out. Ben Hollioake becomes his 200th test wicket. Sri Lanka won by ten wickets, their first Test victory in England. After breaking the world record for the most test wickets in 2007, Muralitharan commented that his 1998 performance at the Oval against England, was his career highlight. He stated "Everyone thought I was a good bowler then and I didn't look back from there."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/other_international/sri_lanka/7123499.stm |title=Muralitharan breaks Test record |work=BBC Sport   |date=2007-12-03 |accessdate=2009-02-08 | location=London[/tpl]
Playing his 58th test, Muralitharan claimed his 300th test wicket when he dismissed Shaun Pollock in the First Test in Durban, in December 2000. Only Dennis Lillee reached the milestone faster, in his 56th test.
On 4 January 2002 in Kandy Muralitharan might have finished with the best-ever figures for a single innings, but after he had claimed nine wickets against Zimbabwe Russel Arnold dropped a catch at short leg.
He missed out on the tenth when Chaminda Vaas dismissed Henry Olonga caught behind amid stifled appeals. Muralitharan follows up his 9 for 51 in the first innings with 4 for 64 in the second, equalling Richard Hadlee's record of 10 ten-wicket match hauls, but needing 15 fewer Tests to do so.
On 15 January 2002 playing in his 72nd test, Muralitharan became the fastest to reach the 400-wicket landmark when he bowled Olonga in the third Test in Galle.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/slveng/content/story/323183.html |title=Timeline: Muttiah Muralitharan – Spinning his way to success |work=Cricinfo |date=2007-12-03 |accessdate=2008-01-06[/tpl]
On 16 March 2004 Muralitharan became the fastest and the youngest bowler to reach 500 wickets during the second test between Sri Lanka and Australia played in Kandy. In his 87th test, he bowled Kasprowicz to claim his 500th victim just four days after Warne reached the landmark on the fifth day of the First Test between the two teams at Galle. Warne took 108 tests to reach 500. Muralitharan took 4–48 on the first day of the second Test as Australia were skittled for 120 in the first innings.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/17/1079199236221.html|title=Murali, Warne strike|first=Michael |last=Donaldson|work=theage |date=2004-03-17 |accessdate=2008-03-27 | location=Melbourne[/tpl]

====Passing Walsh and Warne====

In May 2004, Muralitharan overtook West Indian Courtney Walsh's record of 519 Test match wickets to become the highest wicket-taker. Zimbabwe's Mluleki Nkala becomes Muralitharan's 520th scalp in Tests. Muralitharan held the record until Shane Warne claimed it in October 2004. Warne surpassed Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan's mark of 532 wickets by dismissing India's Irfan Pathan. Warne said he enjoyed his duel with Muralitharan, who was sidelined following shoulder surgery at the time.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.dawn.com/2004/10/16/spt6.htm|title=Warne breaks Muralitharan's Test wickets record |work=Dawn |date=2007-12-03 |accessdate=2008-01-06[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
After an outstanding year Muralitharan was adjudged as the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2006. In six Tests, he took 60 wickets. He took ten in each of four successive matches, the second time he performed such a feat. The opponents for his 60-wicket haul were England away, South Africa at home and New Zealand away: serious opposition. In all, Muralitharan took 90 wickets in 11 Tests in the calendar year.

In July 2007, Muttiah Muralitharan became the second bowler after Australia's Shane Warne to capture 700 Test wickets. The off-spinner reached the landmark when he had Bangladesh's last man Syed Rasel caught in the deep by Farveez Maharoof on the fourth day of the third and final Test at the Asgiriya stadium in Kandy. The dismissal signalled Sri Lanka's victory by an innings and 193 runs to give the host a 3–0 sweep of the series. Muralitharan finished with six wickets in each innings to claim 10 wickets or more in a Test for the 20th time.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.paktribune.com/sports/newsdetail.php?nid=3438|title=Muralitharan takes 700th wicket |work=PakTribune  |date=2007-07-16 |accessdate=2008-03-26[/tpl] However, he was unable to pass Warne's record of 708 wickets when Sri Lanka toured Australia in November 2007, capturing just four wickets in two Test matches.
Muralitharan reclaimed the record for most Test wickets during the first Test against England at Kandy on [tpl]Nowrap|3 December[/tpl] 2007. The spinner bowled England's Paul Collingwood to claim his 709th Test victim and overtaking Shane Warne in the process. Muralitharan reached the mark in his 116th Test – 29 fewer than Warne – and had conceded only 21.77 runs per wicket compared to the Australian's 25.41. This was Muralitharan's 61st 5-wicket haul.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/7124486.stm |title=Murali record dents England hopes |work=BBC Sport   |date=2007-12-03 |accessdate=2007-12-03 | location=London |first=Oliver |last=Brett[/tpl] Warne believed that Muralitharan would take "1,000 wickets" before he retired.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/3626081.stm |title=Warne backs Murali record |first=John |last=May |work=BBC Sport  |date=2004-04-14 |accessdate=2007-12-18 | location=London[/tpl] Former record holder Courtney Walsh also opined that this would be possible if Muralitharan retained his hunger for wickets.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://ia.rediff.com/cricket/2006/nov/10walsh1.htm |title=Murali could reach 1000 wkts: Walsh |first=Harish |last=Kotlan |work=Rediff.com |date=2006-11-10 |accessdate=2007-12-18[/tpl] Muralitharan himself believed there was a possibility that he would reach this milestone.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/other_international/sri_lanka/6209055.stm |title=I can take 1,000 wickets – Murali |work=BBC Sport  |date=2006-12-25 |accessdate=2007-12-18 | location=London[/tpl]

====Beyond the world record====

In July 2008, Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis stopped India's strong batting as Sri Lanka won the first Test by a record innings and 239 runs in Colombo. Muralitharan finished the match with 11 wickets for 110, as India were shot out for 138 in their second innings after conceding a lead of 377 on the fourth day. He was well supported by debutant Ajantha Mendis, an unorthodox spinner with plenty of variation, who took eight wickets in his debut match.
Muralitharan believed the emergence of Mendis would help prolong his own career. Muralitharan, 36, and 23-year-old Mendis formed a formidable partnership in the first Test thrashing of India, taking 19 of the 20 wickets between them. "If he keeps performing this way, he will definitely take a lot of wickets in international cricket. Now that he has come, I think I can play Test cricket a few more years. Bowling 50 overs in a Test innings is very hard. Now if I bowl only 30–35 and he bowls more than me, the job will get easier for me."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080726/wl_sthasia_afp/cricketsriind|title= India crash to big defeat after Murali-Mendis magic|work=Yahoo news |date=2008-07-26 |accessdate=2008-07-27[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

====Performance analysis====

In July 2007, Muralitharan achieved a career peak Test Bowling Rating of 920, based on the LG ICC Player Rankings. This is the highest ever rating achieved by a spin bowler in Test cricket. This also puts him in fourth place in the LG ICC Best-Ever Test bowling ratings.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.cricketratings.com/|title=LG ICC Best-Ever Test Bowling Ratings |accessdate=2008-01-22[/tpl]
Muralitharan has the unique distinction of getting 10 or more wickets in a match against all other nine Test playing nations as well as capturing over 50 wickets against each of them. He also obtained 7 or more wickets in an innings against five nations, namely England, India, South Africa, West Indies and Zimbabwe (refer to table above). Muttiah Muralitharan also took at least five five-fors against all the other nine Test sides.
He currently holds the highest wickets/match ratio (6.1) for any bowler with over 200 Test wickets and also represented Sri Lanka in 118 Tests of the 175 that they have played (67.4%).
Against teams excluding Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, Muralitharan took 624 wickets in 108 Tests. By comparison, excluding his matches against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, Warne took 691 wickets in 142 tests. Murali's average of 24.05 is slightly superior to Warne's career average of 25.41. Muralitharan won 18 Man of the Match awards in Test cricket.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Misc/MiscManOfMatch2.asp?PlayerID=1234|title=Muralitharan – Man of Match Awards (Test Cricket)|work=HowSTAT|accessdate=2008-02-23[/tpl]
During Muralitharan's playing days, the ICC Future Tours Programme denied Sri Lanka and several other teams a level playing field. As a consequence Muralitharan never toured South Africa after December 2002 and never playing a Test at the spin-friendly Sydney Cricket Ground.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/468490.html |title=Dileep Premachandran: Nobody could have done it better than Murali |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=2011-04-01[/tpl]
Another comparison of Muralitharan's bowling record against other successful international bowlers is their career record away from home. Muralitharan received criticism that he enjoyed great success on home soil, taking wickets on pitches that are more spin-friendly than other international pitches.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/robertcraddock/index.php/heraldsun/comments/warnevmurali/|title=Warne is better than Murali | work=Robert Craddock Blog|work=HeraldSun|accessdate=2008-03-31[/tpl] A quick analysis of his Test record of matches played outside Sri Lanka shows that from 52 matches he took 278 wickets at an average of 26.24 runs per wicket, with a strike rate of 60.1 balls per wicket.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/player/49636.html?class=1;template=results;type=bowling|title=Cricinfo Statsguru – M Muralitharan – Test matches – Bowling analysis|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=2008-03-31[/tpl] Similarly, spin bowling rival Shane Warne retired with a slightly superior 'away' record of 362 wickets from 73 matches, at an average of 25.50 and a strike rate of 56.7.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/player/8166.html?class=1;template=results;type=bowling|title=Cricinfo Statsguru – SK Warne – Test matches – Bowling analysis|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=2008-03-31[/tpl] Due to the variabilities of Test cricket such as grounds played at and opposition played against it is difficult to compare the quality of the top level players and, as such, is very difficult and subjective. However it is clear that Muralitharan did much better playing at home to test minnows Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, averaging less than 16 runs a wicket.
Cricinfo's statistics editor S Rajesh concluded that the decade 2000–2009 was the best 10-year period for Test batsmen since the 1940s.[tpl]cite web|author=S Rajesh |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/decadereview2009/content/story/441892.html |title=Why 55 is the new 50 | Decade Review 2009 |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |date=2010-01-04 |accessdate=2011-04-01[/tpl] Muralitharan was clearly the leading Test wicket-taker during this period, capturing 565 wickets at 20.97 in spite of the dominance of the bat over ball. Shane Warne captured 357 wickets at an average of 25.17 during the decade.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?class=1;id=200;type=decade |title=Cricket Records | Records | 2000s | Test matches | Most wickets |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2011-04-01[/tpl] Of spinners with over Test 100 wickets only John Briggs (17.75), Jim Laker (21.24), Bill O Reilly (22.59) and Clarrie Grimmett (24.21) have sub 25.00 bowling averages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283256.html |title=Records | Test matches | Bowling records | Best career bowling average |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2011-04-01[/tpl]
Muralitharan was on the winning side on 54 of the 133 test matches he played. In those games he captured a total of 438 wickets (8.1 wickets per match), at an outstanding average of 16.18 per wicket and a strike rate of 42.7.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/49636.html?class=1;result=1;template=results;type=bowling |title=Bowling records | Test matches |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2011-04-01[/tpl]
Muralitharan took 795 wickets for his country Sri Lanka in 132 tests. The next most wickets for Sri Lanka in these 132 Tests was Chaminda Vaas' 309 – less than 40% of the spinner's pile. No one else managed 100. Collectively Sri Lankan bowlers tallied 1968 wickets across that span, of which Muralitharan accounted for 40.4%. Among the 24 other Sri Lankans who took more than 10 of those wickets, only Lasith Malinga did so at a better strike rate (52.3) than Muralitharan's 54.9 – and the latter bowled rather more overs, 6657.1 of them to be precise.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/470754.html |title=Rob Steen: Muttiah Muralitharan, the ultimate MVP |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=2011-04-01[/tpl]

====Test wicket milestones====

====Five wickets in an innings====

Muralitharan took five or more wickets in an innings on 67 occasions in Test cricket, which is a world record. In comparison Shane Warne who is in second place performed the feat 37 times.Cricinfo, Tests – Most 5 Wickets in an Innings

===One day internationals===

====Career summary====

On 12 August 1993 Muralitharan made his One Day International (ODI) debut against India at the Khettarama Stadium and took 1 for 38 off ten overs. Praveen Amre was his first ODI wicket.
On 27 October 2000 in Sharjah, Muralitharan captured 7 for 30 against India, which were then the best bowling figures in One Day Internationals.
In 9 April 2002 Muralitharan achieved a career peak ODI Bowling Rating of 913, based on the LG ICC Player Rankings. This is the highest ever rating achieved by a spin bowler in One Day Internationals. This also puts him in fourth place in the LG ICC Best-Ever ODI bowling ratings.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.cricketratings.com/|title=LG ICC Best-Ever ODI Bowling Ratings |accessdate=2008-02-12[/tpl]
In 2006, Muralitharan had the second (now third) highest number of runs (99) hit off him in a One Day International Innings. The Australians, especially Adam Gilchrist, attacked Muralitharan's bowling more than usual that day. It is also to be noted that Muralitharan does not have a great record against the Australians in ODIs and this was proved again as he was ineffective in the finals of the 2007 World Cup; his chief tormentor again being Gilchrist.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/102992.html |title=Cricinfo – Records – One-Day Internationals – Most runs conceded in an innings |publisher=Stats.cricinfo.com |accessdate=2011-04-01[/tpl]
Muralitharan played in five Cricket World Cup tournaments, in 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2011. He captured 67 World Cup wickets and is second in the list behind Glenn McGrath who has 71,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=12;type=trophy |title=Most Wickets – World Cup |work=Cricinfo |date=2007-12-03 |accessdate=2008-02-02[/tpl] and represented Sri Lanka in three World Cup finals. In 1996 Muralitharan was part Sri Lanka's World Cup winning team that defeated Australia in Lahore, Pakistan. Muralitharan also played in the 2007 World Cup final, when Australia defeated Sri Lanka in Bridgetown, Barbados. He picked up 23 wickets in the 2007 World Cup, and finished as the second highest wicket taker in the tournament behind Glenn McGrath. He was part of the 2011 team who lost the world cup final against India in Mumbai. It was his farewell match as well.
Muttiah Muralitharan was left out of the Sri Lankan one-day squad to tour West Indies in April 2008. The chairman of selectors Ashantha De Mel clarifying the non-selection stated that "We know he (Muralitharan) can still play in the next World Cup if he is properly looked after, so we want to use him sparingly to preserve him for the big games and the World Cup coming up in the Asian sub-continent where Muralitharan will be a threat."Sri Lanka leave out Muralitharan BBC News retrieved [tpl]Nowrap|13 March[/tpl] 2008[tpl]Cite news|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/cricket/story/7906628/Jayasuriya-still-has-future---De-Mel|title=Jayasuriya-still-has-future—De-Mel|work=Foxsports |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2008-03-16[/tpl]

====Best bowling performances====

===Batting===

An aggressive lower order batsman who usually batted at No. 11, Muralitharan was known for his tendency to back away to leg and slog. Sometimes, he could be troublesome for bowlers because of his unorthodox and adventurous ways. Once, in a Test match against England, while playing Alex Tudor, he moved back towards his leg stump trying to hook the ball and ended up lying on the ground sideways after the shot. He was infamously run out in a match against New Zealand when he left his crease to congratulate Kumar Sangakkara, who had just scored a single to reach his century; the New Zealand fielder had not yet returned the ball to the wicketkeeper, so the ball was still in play. His highest Test score of 67 came against India at Kandy in 2001, including three sixes and five fours.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/276556.html |title=Cricinfo XI: Long live the tail |first=Andrew |last=Miller |work=Cricinfo |date=2007-01-16 |accessdate=2008-01-31[/tpl] He made valuable scores on occasion, including 30 runs against England at the Oval in 1998, including 5 fours,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1998/SL_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/SL_ENG_T_27-31AUG1998.html |title=Test Match: England v Sri Lanka at The Oval, 27–31 Aug 1998 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |accessdate=2011-04-01[/tpl] 38 runs (4 fours, 1 six) against England at Galle in 2003,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2003-04/ENG_IN_SL/SCORECARDS/ENG_SL_T1_02-06DEC2003.html |title=1st Test: Sri Lanka v England at Galle, 2–6 Dec 2003 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |accessdate=2011-04-01[/tpl] 43 runs (5 fours, 3 sixes) against Australia at Kandy in 2004[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2003-04/AUS_IN_SL/SCORECARDS/AUS_SL_T2_16-20MAR2004.html |title=2nd Test: Sri Lanka v Australia at Kandy, 16–20 Mar 2004 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |accessdate=2011-04-01[/tpl] 36 runs against the West Indies at Colombo in 2005,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/WI_IN_SL/SCORECARDS/WI_SL_T1_13-17JUL2005.html |title=1st Test: Sri Lanka v West Indies at Colombo (SSC), 13–17 Jul 2005 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |accessdate=2011-04-01[/tpl] and his highest-ever ODI score, 33 not out (4 fours and 2 sixes off 16 balls) against Bangladesh in the final of the 2009 Tri-Series in Bangladesh.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/tri-bdesh/engine/match/378756.html |title=ODI no, 2794, Tri-Nation Tournament in Bangladesh – Final, Bangladesh v.

The Sri Lankan cricket selector Don Anurasiri was hit by an egg, while Muralitharan and two others were verbally abused by a car-load of people as they were walking from a restaurant back to the hotel.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/lankans-security-boosted-after-eggthrowing-incident/2008/02/03/1201973741295.html|title=Lankans' security boosted after egg-throwing incident|work=The Age |location=Australia|date=2008-02-04 |accessdate=2008-02-06 | location=Melbourne|first=Jamie|last=Pandaram[/tpl]
Due to the incident taking place at night, it is unclear whether Muralitharan was indeed the target of the culprits.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/cbs/content/current/story/334909.html|title=Rotten egg prank could have turned bad|publisher=CricInfo|date=2008-02-04 |accessdate=2008-02-04[/tpl] Even though the Australian coach of the Sri Lankan team, Trevor Bayliss, down-played the incident as "a non-event", Cricket Australia tightened security around the team. In response to this episode Muralitharan was quoted as saying "When you come to Australia, you expect such incidents".[tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
At the conclusion of Muralitharan's test career cricket writer Rahul Bhattacharya summed up Muralitharan's trials thus:
"Murali is described often as a fox. This seems right. Unlike hedgehog bowlers who pursue one big idea, Murali, like a fox, had many ways of pursuit. Like a fox he did not hunt in a pack. Like a fox he was himself cruelly hunted for sport in some parts of the world. Fox hunting was banned a few years ago in England, but is still legal in Australia."http://www.livemint.com/2010/07/29195103/Our-bowlers-and-other-animals.html

He confirmed that the first Test Match against India due to commence on [tpl]Nowrap|18 July[/tpl], 2010 would be his last, but indicated that he was willing to play One-Day Internationals if it was considered necessary leading up to the 2011 World Cup, which Sri Lanka co-hosted.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page=article-details&code_title=1639|title=Muralitharan wants youngsters to take over|work=The Island |date=2010-07-09 |accessdate=2010-07-10[/tpl] He identified Sri Lanka's World Cup win of 1996 as his greatest moment as a cricketer. He also stated that there were some regrets during his 19 year playing career. "Not winning Test Matches in South Africa, Australia and India are regrets. But I am sure we will win very soon." 
At the start of his last match, Muralitharan was eight short of 800 wickets.[tpl]cite web|last=Veera|first=Sriram|title=Murali gets 800, Sri Lanka win by ten wickets|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/sri-lanka-v-india-2010/content/story/468370.html|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=22 July 2010[/tpl] At the fall of the ninth wicket of the Indian's second innings Muralitharan still needed one wicket to reach the milestone. After 90 minutes of resistance Muralitharan was able to dismiss the last Indian batsman Pragyan Ojha on the last delivery of the over and his Test career.[tpl]cite web|last=Monga|first=Sidharth|title=Murali's romanticised farewell|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/sri-lanka-v-india-2010/content/current/story/468414.html|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=22 July 2010[/tpl] By doing so he became the first bowler to reach 800 wickets in Test cricket.
