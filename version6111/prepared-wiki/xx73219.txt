Patrick Kennedy (Bet. January 15, 1823 and February 16, 1823 – November 22, 1858) was an Irish farmer who immigrated to East Boston, Massachusetts. Born in Dunganstown, County Wexford, Ireland, he was the father of businessman/politician Patrick Joseph "P. J." Kennedy, paternal grandfather of businessman/politician Joseph Patrick "Joe" Kennedy, Sr., and patrilineal great-grandfather of World War II casualty Joseph Patrick "Joe" Kennedy, Jr., President John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy, Senator Robert Francis "Bobby" Kennedy, and longtime Senator Edward Moore "Ted" Kennedy.

==Early life==

Patrick Kennedy was the youngest son of farmer James Kennedy (1770–1835) and his wife Maria (c. 1779 – February 16, 1835). James Kennedy was born in Dunganstown,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pasthomes.com/info/jfk.php |title=John F. Kennedy's Ancestors |publisher=Irish Townland Maps |accessdate=December 21, 2011[/tpl] (Whitechurch, New Ross, County Wexford) in southern Ireland to John Kennedy (1738–1803) and Bridget Shallow (1744–1774). James inherited a small farm from his father during the Penal Law times in Ireland. Patrick had three older siblings:

==Adulthood==

By the time Patrick reached adulthood, both his parents were apparently dead and the family homestead was controlled by his eldest brother John, who was already married and the father of four children. The eldest son normally inherited whatever claims existed to the family's farm. Because of the life-threatening scarcity of food and resources, the rest of the children, such as third son Patrick Kennedy, usually were expected to leave for the New World.
Patrick's life as a farmer in Dunganstown consisted mainly of cutting and tying bundles of grain by hand, and planting and tilling potatoes for his family's consumption. This routine varied only when he ventured into the nearest town, New Ross, with supplies of barley, and when the family attended mass about a mile away.
At the age of 26, Kennedy decided to leave Ireland. It is assumed this was for reasons of starvation related to the Irish Famine, illness, or because he knew that a third-born son had virtually no hope of running his family's farm. His good friend at Cherry Bros. Brewery in New Ross, Patrick Barron, who taught Kennedy the skills of coopering, had come to that conclusion months earlier and left for America. In October 1848, Patrick Kennedy decided to follow.
Patrick Kennedy arrived in Boston on April 22, 1849, having sailed from Liverpool, England on the Washington Irving, a substantial packet ship from the East Boston yard of Donald McKay. Patrick Barron helped settle him into Boston life and organized his coopering job on Noddle's Island in east Boston. Not long after, Barron's cousin Bridget Murphy (daughter of Phillip Murphy and Mary Barron)[tpl]cite web|title=The Famine Ships: The Irish Exodus to America - Edward Laxton - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16[/tpl] made her way to Boston and married Kennedy, on September 26, 1849 in the Holy Redeemer Church by Father John Williams, who later became Boston's Roman Catholic Archbishop.

==Children==

Patrick and Bridget had five children:
The arrival of P. J. was a particularly happy occasion after the death of John. However that same year Patrick succumbed to the highly infectious cholera that infested East Boston, and died on November 22, 1858, exactly 105 years before his great-grandson Jack would be assassinated.
Bridget later went on to buy a stationery and notions store in east Boston where she had worked. The business took off and expanded into a grocery and liquor store, which helped pave the way for the success of their son P. J.
The story of Patrick Kennedy has become probably the most famous of any of Ireland's millions of emigrants, due to the quick success of his children and grandchildren in American society and ultimately his great-grandson John F. Kennedy's election as the first Catholic President. In June 1963, John F. Kennedy made a state visit to Ireland, in which he visited Dunganstown and New Ross in County Wexford in what was seen as a personal tribute to his ancestry.
