Joseph A. Day (born January 24, 1945) is a Canadian politician. He has been a Canadian Senator since October 4, 2001.
Day studied at College Militaire Royal Saint-Jean in 1963. He graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario in 1968. He served in the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1963 to 1968. He is an honorary member of the Royal Military College of Canada.
Day entered politics in 1978, when a by-election was held in his native New Brunswick. Day returned from his practice of law in Ottawa, Ontario to contest the by-election as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada, but was defeated in what had long been a Progressive Conservative stronghold.
He faced the same electorate three times in two years due to the rapid succession of general elections that came in May 1979 and February 1980.
In 1982, he ran for the leadership of the New Brunswick Liberal Party, but was narrowly defeated on the final ballot by Doug Young. The leadership race was very divisive, and the Liberals went down to their worst defeat in recent history in the 1982 provincial election.  Day, who sought election to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in a Saint John riding, was defeated in his fifth contest in five years.
Day's wife, Georgie Day, was elected to the legislature, on her first attempt in electoral politics, in 1991, and was re-elected in 1995. While in the legislature, she served in the cabinets of Premiers Frank McKenna, Ray Frenette, and Camille Thériault.
Day was appointed to the Senate of Canada from New Brunswick in 2001. He has been active on issues of Veterans Affairs Canada and media concentration. He will be a Senator until 2020 should he fill his full term.
On January 29, 2014, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau announced all Liberal Senators, including Day, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents.http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-removes-senators-from-liberal-caucus-1.2515273 According to Senate Opposition leader James Cowan, the Senators will still refer to themselves as Liberals even if they are no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus.[tpl]cite news|title=Trudeau’s expulsion catches Liberal senators by surprise|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-to-boot-senators-from-liberal-caucus-in-bid-to-restore-senate-independence/article16567413/|accessdate=January 29, 2014|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=January 29, 2014[/tpl]
