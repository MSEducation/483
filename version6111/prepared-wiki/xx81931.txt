===Contemporary screamo (2000sâ€“present)===

By 1995, the genre name "screamo" drifted into the music press, especially in the journalism of Jim DeRogatis and Andy Greenwald,Jim DeRogatis, "Screamo", Guitar World, November 2002 http://www.jimdero.com/OtherWritings/OtherScreamoGW.htm Access date: July 18, 2008 and by the mid-2000s, the over-saturation of the screamo scene had caused many bands to purposefully expand past the genre's trademarks and incorporate more experimental elements. Some bands that were active in the early 2000s, such as Thursday, Alexisonfire, Silverstein and Poison the Well made screamo much more popular.[ref]
