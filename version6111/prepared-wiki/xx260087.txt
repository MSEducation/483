Cattleya alaorii, commonly known as the Laelia alaorii, is a species of orchid endemic to Brazil (Bahia). It was discovered in the 70's in an isolated mountain chain near Itabuna, Bahia, where it grows in very wet rainforest at about 600m above sea level. The plants are epiphytes in tall trees up to 40m high, and grow in the top branches where they get a fair amount of light. Their environment is always foggy and minimum temperatures in winter are never less than 15C. The species was named after Mr. Alaor Oliveira, former employee at the University of SÃ£o Paulo at Piracicaba, who first collected this species in a field excursion in the late 60's.
