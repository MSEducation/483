==Biography==

Čapek was born in Hronov, Bohemia (Austria-Hungary, later Czechoslovakia, now Czech Republic) in 1887. First a painter of the Cubist school, he later developed his own playful primitive style. He collaborated with his brother Karel on a number of plays and short stories; on his own, he wrote the utopian play Land of Many Names and several novels, as well as critical essays in which he argued for the art of the unconscious, of children, and of 'savages'. He was named by his brother as the true inventor of the term robot.Karel Capek - Who did actually invent the word "robot" and what does it mean? at capek.misto.czRobotics and automation handbook As a cartoonist, he worked for Lidové Noviny, a newspaper based in Prague.
Due to his critical attitude towards national socialism and Adolf Hitler, he was arrested after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939. He wrote Poems from a Concentration Camp in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where he died in 1945.
His illustrated stories about 'Pejsek a Kočička' ('Doggie and Pussycat') are considered classics of Czech children's literature.
