Hunminjeongeum Haerye (lit. "Explanations and Examples of the Correct/Proper Sounds for the Instruction of the People"), also called the Haerye Edition of Hunminjeongeum or simply The Haerye, is a commentary on the Hunminjeongeum, the original promulgation of hangul. 
It was written by scholars from the Jiphyeonjeon (Hall of Worthies), commissioned by King Sejong the Great. In addition to an introduction by Sejong (excerpted from the beginning of Hunminjeongeum) and a colophon by the scholar Jeong Inji (鄭麟趾), it contains the following chapters:
See Hangul letter design for an excerpt of the letter design explanations from chapters 2 through 4.
The original publication is 65 pages of hanja in regular script, except where hangul are mentioned and illustrated. Only one original copy exists, which was made public in 1940 by Jeon Hyeongpil, an antique collector who acquired it from Lee Hangeol (1880–1950), whose family had possessed it for generations.
Now kept in the Kansong Art Museum (간송 미술관; 澗松美術館), it is South Korean National Treasure number 70 and has been a UNESCO Memory of the World Register since October 1997.
