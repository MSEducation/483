[[Daitya]]

CATEGORIES: Giants, Asura

In Hindism, the Daityas are a clan or race of Asura as are the Danavas. Daityas were the children of Diti and the sage Kashyapa. They were a race of giants who fought against the Devas because they were jealous of their Deva half-brothers. The female Daityas are described as wearing jewelry the size of boulders.http://books.google.ca/books?id=jEcpkWjYOZQC&pg=PA141&lpg=PA141&dq=pulomas+kalakas&source=bl&ots=OtCcgLJMxW&sig=8kPUa18cYD4SqnHyXWOTY2_H2Yg&hl=en&ei=CK-6TJeSJcicnAeur_DRDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Dictionary of ancient deities By Patricia Turner, Charles Russell Coulter
