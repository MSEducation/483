The position of lieutenant governor of Ohio was established in 1852.[tpl]cite web | last =Husted| first =Jon| authorlink =Jon Husted | title =Lieutenant Governors of the State of Ohio: 1852 - present | publisher = Ohio Secretary of State | accessdate = 2012-01-24 | url = http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/elections/Research/electResultsMain/HistoricalElectionComparisons/Lieutenant%20Governors%20of%20the%20State%20of%20Ohio%201852%20-%20present.aspx [/tpl]  The lieutenant governor becomes governor if the governor resigns, dies in office or is removed by impeachment. Before 1852, the president of the Ohio State Senate would serve as acting governor if a vacancy in the governorship occurred. Until 1978, lieutenant governors were elected separately but concurrently with the governor (not on a "ticket"). Thus, there were several occasions when the lieutenant governor was from a different party than the governor. This was changed by constitutional amendment. In 1974, Richard F. Celeste was the last lieutenant governor to be elected separately. In 1978, George Voinovich became the first lieutenant governor to be elected on the same ticket with the governor.
From 1852 to 1979, the lieutenant governor also served as the president of the Ohio State Senate.  More recently, Ohio governors have generally named the lieutenant governor to head an agency of state government.  An example of this is Bruce Edward Johnson, who served as Director of the Ohio Department of Development, as did his successor, Lee Fisher.
The 28th Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, Warren G. Harding, later served as 29th President of the United States.
