==Neoclassical views==

A purely neoclassical viewAbel & Bernanke (1995), op. cit., Ch. 11. of the macroeconomy rejects the idea that monetary policy can have real effects. Neoclassical macroeconomists argue that real economic quantities, like real output, employment, and unemployment, are determined by real factors only. Nominal factors like changes in the money supply only affect nominal variables like inflation. The neoclassical idea that nominal factors cannot have real effects is often called "monetary neutrality"Abel & Bernanke (1995), op. cit., Ch. 11, pp. 378–9. or also the "classical dichotomy".
Since the neoclassical viewpoint says that real phenomena like unemployment are essentially unrelated to nominal phenomena like inflation, a neoclassical economist would offer two separate explanations for 'stagnation' and 'inflation'. Neoclassical explanations of stagnation (low growth and high unemployment) include inefficient government regulations or high benefits for the unemployed that give people less incentive to look for jobs.  Another neoclassical explanation of stagnation is given by real business cycle theory, in which any decrease in labour productivity makes it efficient to work less.  The main neoclassical explanation of inflation is very simple: it happens when the monetary authorities increase the money supply too much.[ref]

Ch. 8,  Fig. 8.1.</ref>
In the neoclassical viewpoint, the real factors that determine output and unemployment affect the aggregate supply curve only. The nominal factors that determine inflation affect the aggregate demand curve only.Abel & Bernanke (1995), Ch. 11, pp. 376–7. When some adverse changes in real factors are shifting the aggregate supply curve left at the same time that unwise monetary policies are shifting the aggregate demand curve right, the result is stagflation.
Thus the main explanation for stagflation under a classical view of the economy is simply policy errors that affect both inflation and the labour market. Ironically, a very clear argument in favour of the classical explanation of stagflation was provided by Keynes himself. In 1919, John Maynard Keynes described the inflation and economic stagnation gripping Europe in his book The Economic Consequences of the Peace.  Keynes wrote:
Keynes explicitly pointed out the relationship between governments printing money and inflation.
Keynes also pointed out how government price controls discourage production.
Keynes detailed the relationship between German government deficits and inflation.

===Keynesian in the short run, classical in the long run===

While most economists believe that changes in money supply can have some real effects in the short run, neoclassical and neo-Keynesian economists tend to agree that there are no long-run effects from changing the money supply. Therefore, even economists who consider themselves neo-Keynesians usually believe that in the long run, money is neutral. In other words, while neoclassical and neo-Keynesian models are often seen as competing points of view, they can also be seen as two descriptions appropriate for different time horizons. Many mainstream textbooks today treat the neo-Keynesian model as a more appropriate description of the economy in the short run, when prices are 'sticky', and treat the neoclassical model as a more appropriate description of the economy in the long run, when prices have sufficient time to adjust fully.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]
Therefore, while mainstream economists today might often attribute short periods of stagflation (not more than a few years) to adverse changes in supply, they would not accept this as an explanation of very prolonged stagflation. More prolonged stagflation would be explained as the effect of inappropriate government policies: excessive regulation of product markets and labor markets leading to long-run stagnation, and excessive growth of the money supply leading to long-run inflation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]

==Alternative views==

===As differential accumulation===

Political economists Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler have proposed an explanation of stagflation as part of a theory they call differential accumulation, which says firms seek to beat the average profit and capitalisation rather than maximise. According to this theory, periods of mergers and acquisitions oscillate with periods of stagflation. When mergers and acquisitions are no longer politically feasible (governments clamp down with anti-monopoly rules), stagflation is used as an alternative to have higher relative profit than the competition. With increasing mergers and acquisitions, the power to implement stagflation increases.
Stagflation appears as a societal crisis, such as during the period of the oil crisis in the 70s and in 2007 to 2010. Inflation in stagflation, however, doesn't affect all firms equally. Dominant firms are able to increase their own prices at a faster rate than competitors. While in the aggregate no one appears to be profiting, differentially dominant firms improve their positions with higher relative profits and higher relative capitalisation. Stagflation is not due to any actual supply shock, but because of the societal crisis that hints at a supply crisis. It is mostly a 20th and 21st century phenomenon that has been mainly used by the "weapondollar-petrodollar coalition" creating or using Middle East crises for the benefit of pecuniary interests.[tpl]cite journal |last=Nitzan |first=Jonathan |date=June 2001 |title= Regimes of differential accumulation: mergers, stagflation and the logic of globalization |journal=Review of International Political Economy |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=226–274 |url=http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/3/ |doi=10.1080/09692290010033385 |ref=harv[/tpl]

===Demand-pull stagflation theory===

Demand-pull stagflation theory explores the idea that stagflation can result exclusively from monetary shocks without any concurrent supply shocks or negative shifts in economic output potential.  Demand-pull theory describes a scenario where stagflation can occur following a period of monetary policy implementations that cause inflation.  This theory was first proposed in 1999 by Eduardo Loyo of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.[tpl]Cite document|last1=Loyo|first1=Eduardo|date=June 1999|title=Demand-Pull Stagflation (Draft Working Paper)|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research New Working Papers|ref=harv|postscript=[/tpl]http://www.nber.org/~confer/99/efcesi99/loyo.pdf

===Supply-side theory===

Supply-side economics emerged as a response to US stagflation in the 1970s. It largely attributed inflation to the ending of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 and the lack of a specific price reference in the subsequent monetary policies (Keynesian and Monetarism).  Supply-side economists asserted that the contraction component of stagflation resulted from an inflation-induced rise in real tax rates (see bracket creep)[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]

===Austrian School of economics===

Adherents to the Austrian School maintain that creation of new money ex nihilo benefits the creators and early recipients of the new money relative to late recipients.  Money creation is not wealth creation; it merely allows early money recipients to outbid late recipients for resources, goods, and services.
Since the actual producers of wealth are typically late recipients, increases in the money supply weakens wealth formation and undermines the rate of economic growth. Says Austrian economist Frank Shostak:
"The increase in the money supply rate of growth coupled with the slowdown in the rate of growth of goods produced is what the increase in the rate of price inflation is all about. (Note that a price is the amount of money paid for a unit of a good.) What we have here is a faster increase in price inflation and a decline in the rate of growth in the production of goods. But this is exactly what stagflation is all about, i.e., an increase in price inflation and a fall in real economic growth.  Popular opinion is that stagflation is totally made up. It seems therefore that the phenomenon of stagflation is the normal outcome of loose monetary policy. This is in agreement with and Friedman (PF). Contrary to PF, however, we maintain that stagflation is not caused by the fact that in the short run people are fooled by the central bank. Stagflation is the natural result of monetary pumping which weakens the pace of economic growth and at the same time raises the rate of increase of the prices of goods and services."[ref]

==Responses==

Stagflation undermined support for Keynesian consensus. The rise of conservative theories of economics, including monetarism, can be traced to the failure of Keynesian policies to combat stagflation or explain it to the satisfaction of economists and policy-makers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]
Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker very sharply increased interest rates from 1979–1983 in what was called a "disinflationary scenario." After U.S. prime interest rates had soared into the double-digits, inflation did come down; these interest rates were the highest long-term prime interest rates that had ever existed in modern capital markets.[tpl]Harv|Homer|Sylla|Sylla|1996|loc=p. 1[/tpl] Volcker is often credited with having stopped at least the inflationary side of stagflation, although the American economy also dipped into recession. Starting in approximately 1983, growth began a recovery. Both fiscal stimulus and money supply growth were policy at this time. A five- to six-year jump in unemployment during the Volcker disinflation suggests Volcker may have trusted unemployment to self-correct and return to its natural rate within a reasonable period.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]
