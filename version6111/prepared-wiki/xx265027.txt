==Description==

The painting hung in the Westchester Institute of Fine Arts in Tarrytown, New York, where the public were charged 25Â¢ to view it.

==Smiukse==

Smiukse (b. 1908) was a Latvian who had jumped ship in New York Harbor in 1927 and had been making a living as a house painter in the Bronx.  He had heard of the painting and was offended by the inclusion of Eleanor Roosevelt and her children in it.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747915-2,00.html|title=Art: Poor White's Art|date=Sep 10, 1934|work=Time|page=2|accessdate=3 January 2011[/tpl]

==Destruction==

Smiukse, on his day off, calmly went to the gallery, paid his fee, and went in to view the painting. There, in front of a group of housewives, he splashed the painting with paint remover, pulled it off the wall and lit it up. The flames soon went out, but the painting was ruined. He was arrested on the spot.[tpl]cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=Greg|last2=Schrag|first2=Peter|title=The Campaign of the Century: Upton Sinclair's Race for Governor of California and the Birth of Media Politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mVjNWMWwRF4C&pg=PA43|accessdate=3 January 2011|date=2010-11-01|publisher=PoliPointPress|isbn=978-1-936227-08-2|page=43[/tpl] Painter Jonas Lie put up a bail of $500 for Smiuske.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hlchalfant.com/artists/jonas-lie|title=Artist Profile Jonas Lie|last=Tolfsby|first=Dina|year=2005|work=National Library of Norway|publisher=hlchalfant.com|accessdate=3 January 2011[/tpl]
