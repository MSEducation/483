London Arch is a natural arch in the Port Campbell National Park, Australia.
The arch is one of the tourist attractions along the Great Ocean Road near Port Campbell in Victoria. This stack was formed by a gradual process of erosion, and until 1990 formed a complete double-span natural bridge.
The arch closer to the shoreline collapsed unexpectedly on 15 January 1990,[tpl]cite book|last=Woodroffe|first=C.

No one was injured in the event. Prior to the collapse, the arch was known as London Bridge because of its similarity to its namesake.
