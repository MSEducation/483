==History==

Banff was first settled in the 1880s, after the transcontinental railway was built through the Bow Valley. In 1883, three Canadian Pacific Railway workers stumbled upon a series of natural hot springs on the side of Sulphur Mountain. In 1885, Canada established a federal reserve of [tpl]convert|26|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] around the Cave and Basin hot springs, and began promoting the area as an international resort and spa as a way to support the new railway.History of the Town of Banff In 1887, the reserve area was increased to [tpl]convert|673|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] and named "Rocky Mountain Park." This was the beginning of Canada's National Park system.
The area was named Banff in 1884 by George Stephen, president of the Canadian Pacific Railway, recalling his birthplace in Banffshire, Scotland, now simply Banff. The Canadian Pacific built a series of grand hotels along the rail line and advertised the Banff Springs Hotel as an international tourist resort.
The Banff townsite was developed near the railway station as a service centre for tourists visiting the park. It was administered by the Government of Canada's national parks system until 1990 when the Town of Banff became the only incorporated municipality within a Canadian national park.
In 1985, the United Nations declared Banff National Park, as one of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, a World Heritage Site. Banff remains one of the most popular tourist destinations in Canada.
One of the most notable figures of Banff was Norman Luxton, who was known as "Mr. Banff". He published the Crag and Canyon newspaper, built the King Edward Hotel and the Lux Theatre, and founded the Sign of the Goat Curio Shop, which led to the development of the Luxton Museum of Plains Indians, now the Buffalo Nations Museum.[tpl]cite web |title=The History of Norman Luxton – Founder of the Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum |url=http://www.buffalonationsmuseum.ca/bnmhistoryLuxton.html |publisher=Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100412183235/http://www.buffalonationsmuseum.ca/bnmhistoryLuxton.html |archivedate=2010-04-12 |accessdate=2013-02-15[/tpl] He and his family helped organize the Banff Indian Days and the Banff Winter Carnival.
In 1976, the International Astronomical Union's Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (IAU/WGPSN) officially adopted the name Banff for a crater on Mars, after the town in Alberta. The crater is at latitude 17.7° north and longitude 30.8° west. Its diameter is [tpl]convert|5|km|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | title=USGS Astro: Planetary Nomenclature: Feature Data Search Results: | url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/jsp/FeatureNameDetail.jsp?feature=60764 | work= | publisher=United States Geological Survey | date= | accessdate=2009-04-12[/tpl]

Lake Minnewanka located 6 minutes north of the townsite is a very popular day use area with a variety of activities.

There is a very popular Lake Cruise and motor boat rentals and a small food concession available at the marina.
Tunnel Mountain (formerly known as Sleeping Buffalo Mountain) ([tpl]convert|1690|m|abbr=on|disp=or|0[/tpl]) is situated within the townsite and is very popular for quick hikes; one can reach the summit in less than half an hour. It was named Tunnel Mountain because surveyors initially wanted to make a tunnel for the Canadian Pacific Railway right through the mountain, instead of following the Bow River Valley.

===Transportation===

In June 2008, the Banff council launched a local bus system called Roam, with three routes connecting the town, Tunnel Mountain, the Banff Springs Hotel, and the Banff Gondola.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.roamtransit.com/ |publisher=Town of Banff |title=Roam |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-02-15[/tpl] The service is operated using four hybrid Nova buses, each decorated with scenes from the National Park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://roamtransit.com/services/banff|title=Roam in Banff, |publisher=Bow Valley Regional Transit Services Commission[/tpl] There are three separate routes, Route 1 which goes to Sulphur Mountain and Route 2 which goes to Tunnel Mountain, and Route 3 which goes from Banff, to nearby Canmore. Many bus stops along the routes have screens which tell exactly how many minutes before the next two buses arrive. In December 2012, the bus system was expanded to include the Route 3 hourly service between Banff and Canmore.[tpl]cite web |url=http://roamtransit.com/services/canmore-banff-regional |publisher=Town of Banff |title=Roam |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-03-18[/tpl]
