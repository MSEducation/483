==Bhutan's bimodal population estimates==

The Royal Government of Bhutan listed the country's population as 752,700 in 2003.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bhutan.gov.bt/government/aboutbhutan.php |title=Fact File |accessdate=2008-01-06 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=National Portal of Bhutan[/tpl] The CIA Factbook in 2003 estimated the population at 2,327,849.[tpl]CIA_World_Factbook_link|bt|Bhutan[/tpl]
One explanation for this discrepancy is that the higher CIA numbers ultimately trace back to an inflated population number the Bhutanese government supplied to the United Nations in the early 1970s in order to gain entry into that body[tpl]citation-needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] (the UN reportedly had a cutoff population of one million at that time[tpl]citation-needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]). According to this theory the CIA population experts have retained this original inflated number year after year while adjusting it each year for normal population growth.[tpl]citation-needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
An alternative theory is that the western and central districts of the country wish to underestimate the populations of the southern and eastern districts in order to maintain their historical dominance over those districts.[tpl]citation-needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] This is the claim made by some Bhutanese refugee groups. Certainly the government numbers do not include people in the refugee camps in Nepal and other persons forced out of Bhutan, which total approximately 125,000.[tpl]citation-needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
The Bhutanese numbers can be reconstructed from their 9th Five Year Plan documents,http://www.dop.gov.bt/rep/index.htm which lists the exact number of households in each gewog. If the Bhutanese refugee advocate groups are correct, a spot check of a southern gewog should show a massive under-reporting of population [tpl]citation-needed|date=December 2011[/tpl].
The CIA World Fact book number has since been adjusted with a note of former inconstencies, and attributes the difference to the government not including the "first modern census of Bhutan, conducted in 2005".[tpl]CIA_World_Factbook_link|bt|Bhutan[/tpl] July 2009 est. - retrieved Apr 2009 It should also be noted that in the 1970s Bhutan was one of the most isolated countries in the world and nobody knew how many people lived there since no census had ever been taken.

==Demographic statistics==

The following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.
Nationality
Ethnic groups
Religions
Approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of the population practice Drukpa Kagyupa or Ningmapa Buddhism, both of which are disciplines of Mahayana Buddhism. Approximately one-quarter of the population is ethnic Nepalese and practice Hinduism. They live mainly in the south and follow the Shaivite, Vaishnavite, Shakta, Ghanapathi, Puranic, and Vedic schools. Christians both Roman Catholic and Protestant and nonreligious groups comprised less than 1 percent of the population. Bön, the country's animist and shamanistic belief system, revolves around the worship of nature and predates Buddhism. Very few citizens adhere exclusively to this religious group.
