Stavka ([tpl]lang-ru|Ставка[/tpl]) is the term used to refer to the high command of the armed forces in the Russian Empire  and the Soviet Union. It was used in Imperial Russia to refer to the administrative staff, and to the General Headquarters in the late 19th Century Imperial Russian armed forces and subsequently in the Soviet Union. In western literature it is sometimes incorrectly written in uppercase STAVKA, but the term is not an acronym. The term may be used to refer to its members, as well as to the headquarters location )its original meaning from the old Russian word ставка — Tent).

==Stavka of the Commander-in-chief during World War I==

The commander-in-chief of the Russian army at the beginning of World War I was Grand Duke Nicholas Nicholaievitch, a grandson of Tsar Nicholas I. Appointed at the last minute in August 1914, he played no part in formulating the military plans in use at the beginning of the war.  Nikolai Yanushkevich was his chief of staff. In the summer of 1915 the Tsar himself took personal command, with Mikhail Alekseyev as his chief of staff.
The Stavka was divided into several departments:
The Stavka was first established in Baranovichi. In August 1915, after the German advance, the Stavka re-located to Mogilev.
