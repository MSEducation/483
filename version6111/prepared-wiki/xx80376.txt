 [[File:Second Trinity University Campus 1.JPG|250px|thumb|Former Trinity Campus in Waxahachie, TX]]
Trinity was founded in 1869 by Cumberland Presbyterians in Tehuacana, Texas. The school was formed from the remnants of three small Cumberland Presbyterian colleges that dwindled in enrollment during the American Civil War. Feeling that the school needed the support of a larger community, the university moved in 1902 to Waxahachie, Texas. In 1906, the university, along with many Cumberland Presbyterian churches, affiliated with the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. The Stock Market Crash of 1929, however, severely hindered the University's growth. Enrollment declined sharply, indebtedness and faculty attrition mounted, and trustees began using endowment funds to maintain daily operations. Consequently, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools placed Trinity's accreditation status on probation in 1936, jeopardizing its future. Once again, leaders began to consider relocation to a larger community to improve its viability.
Meanwhile, in 1942, the Methodist-affiliated University of San Antonio was failing. San Antonio community leaders who wished to maintain a Protestant-related college in the city approached Trinity with a relocation offer. The university left Waxahachie and took over the campus and alumni of the University of San Antonio. (The old Waxahachie campus is currently home to Southwestern Assemblies of God University). For the next decade the Woodlawn campus, on the city's near West side, was Trinity's home while it developed a permanent home. Lacking adequate facilities, the University functioned by using military barracks and Quonset huts to house students and to provide library and classroom space.http://web.trinity.edu/x836.xml Trinity University History
In 1945, the school acquired a former limestone quarry for a new campus. Texas architect O'Neil Ford was hired to design a master plan and many of the buildings. Construction began in 1950, and the current campus opened in 1952.
When it moved, the campus was largely undeveloped (one classroom building, one dorm, and a nearly empty library were the only completed buildings).http://web.trinity.edu/x836.xml Yet, under the leadership of Dr. James W. Laurie, the university’s 14th president, Trinity took advantage of its new location in a rapidly growing major urban center to grow in academic stature.  Dr. Laurie was responsible for drastically increasing Trinity’s endowment, largely funded by the James A. and Leta M. Chapman Charitable Trust of Tulsa, Oklahoma.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kbt32| title=TRINITY UNIVERSITY| work=The Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association | accessdate=2010-11-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://rogersandbell.com/Trusts.aspx |title=Chapman Charitable Trusts |publisher=Rogers and Bell |accessdate=2010-11-01[/tpl]  The stronger endowment allowed Trinity to construct a new, modern campus in its “University on the Hill” location and to increase the quality and range of its faculty while maintaining a high faculty to student ratio.  This in turn helped Trinity to become more selective in student recruitment.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]  In 1969 Trinity entered into a covenant agreement with the regional synod of the Presbyterian Church that affirmed historical connections, but transformed Trinity into a private, independent University with a self-perpetuating board of trustees. The campus continues to be a "historically connected" member of the Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities.
Trinity's growth continued under Ronald Calgaard, who followed Laurie's successor, Duncan Wimpress. Under  Dr. Calgaard, the university implemented a number of changes to raise its profile. For example, Trinity transformed into a residential undergraduate school, requiring all freshmen to live on campus and cutting the number of master's programs offered from more than twenty to four. As well, Trinity decreased its student population from about 3,300 to 3,000 (and eventually to 2,700), increased merit scholarships, increased the focus on national student recruitment, and began scheduling a strong series of speakers and cultural events open to the public.http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1987_454397/trinity-university-stakes-its-future-on-recruiting.html
Calgaard's successor, John R. Brazil, focused on replacing outdated campus buildings and improving the school's financial resources.  The "Campaign for Trinity University," which launched in September 2005, sought to raise US $200 million for a variety of purposes.  At its conclusion on September 25, 2009, the Campaign raised US $205.9 million, surpassing the original goal.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/development/campaign/news_events/0909_campaign_conclusion.htm |date=2009-09-25| title=Trinity University’s Capital Campaign Totals $205.9 Million |publisher=Trinity University |accessdate=2010-11-01[/tpl] On January 23, 2009 the university announced that Dr. Brazil would retire as Trinity's President in January 2010. That same day the Board of Trustees awarded him Trinity's Distinguished Service Award, Trinity's most prestigious honor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/public_relations/news_releases/090123brazilretire.htm | title=Trinity University President Announces Retirement in 2010 | publisher=Trinity University | date=2009-01-23 | accessdate=2010-11-01[/tpl] Dr. Dennis Ahlburg assumed the presidency in January 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/public_relations/news_releases/090925_ahlburg.htm| title=Trinity University Selects 18th President | publisher=Trinity University | date=2009-09-25 | accessdate=2010-11-01[/tpl]

==Campus==

Trinity overlooks Downtown San Antonio, adjacent to the Monte Vista Historic District and just south of the Olmos Park and Alamo Heights neighborhoods. The [tpl]convert|117|acre|km2|1|sing=on[/tpl] Skyline Campus, the university's fourth location, is noted for its distinctive red brick architecture and well-maintained grounds, modeled after an Italian village by late architect O'Neil Ford.
The campus is situated on a former limestone quarry, which creates a natural division between the upper and lower campus connected by stairways. The upper campus is the focus of academic life, while the lower campus, which sits in the basin, is residential. Trinity's residential college structure offers dorms situated near the dining and athletic facilities. Trinity is often cited on lists as a school with the nicest dorms. All halls are coed by suite, offer maid service, and are located within a 10-15 minute walk to classes and the library. The suite style dorms feature two double rooms, which share an adjoining bathroom. Despite the residential setting of its campus, Trinity is only five minutes away from historic Downtown San Antonio, the seventh-largest city in the United States.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

===Greek life===

15 Greek organizations are hosted by Trinity, eight fraternities and seven sororities,http://web.trinity.edu/x4971.xmlhttp://web.trinity.edu/x5015.xml of which a U.S. News & World Report profile estimated that 14% of men and 19% of women were members or about 17% of total undergraduate enrollment.http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/trinity-university-3647
Historically, fraternities and sororities have been mired in conflict at Trinity. In 1991, the New York Times reported that Trinity had discontinued campus Greek organizations right to pledge new members as a result of being in violation of the university's alcohol use policy.[tpl]cite news|title=Campus Life: Trinity; Fraternity Charter Is Taken Away In Drinking Case|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/03/nyregion/campus-life-trinity-fraternity-charter-is-taken-away-in-drinking-case.html|accessdate=17 July 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=3 March 1991[/tpl] In 2012, two fraternities and two sororities had their charters temporarily revoked for hazing violations.http://www.trinitonian.com/2012/04/27/panel-stands-tough/ The Gamma Chi Delta sorority specifically was found to have been in violation of numerous internal policies relating to sexual based harassment and intimidation.http://www.trinitonian.com/2012/04/13/greek-saga-continues/[tpl]cite news|last=Coleman|first=Christina|title=Trinity University Suspends Four Sororities and Fraternities|url=http://www.foxsanantonio.com/template/cgi-bin/archived.pl?type=basic&file=/newsroom/top_stories/videos/archive/2012/04/EMMo2DTA.xml|accessdate=17 July 2012|newspaper=KABB[/tpl] These violations were said to have taken place over many years.
