[[Osteopathy]]

CATEGORIES: Osteopathy, Alternative medical systems

Osteopathy is a type of complementary and alternative medicine. Its practitioners claim that the wellbeing of an individual depends on their bones, muscles, ligaments and connective tissue functioning smoothly together. Osteopaths receive special training in the musculoskeletal system. They believe that their treatments, which primarily consist of moving, stretching and massaging a person’s muscles and joints, help allow the body to heal itself.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/osteopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx | title = NHS Osteopathy[/tpl]
As with all forms of complementary and alternative medicine, the practice of osteopathy does not always adhere to evidence-based medicine (EBM). There are few high-quality research studies demonstrating that osteopathy is effective in treating any medical condition other than lower back pain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.med.nyu.edu/content?ChunkIID=37409 |title=Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment |publisher=NYU Langone Medical Center |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=5 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Osteopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx |title=Osteopathy – NHS Choices |publisher=Nhs.uk |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2014[/tpl] In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends osteopathy for the treatment of persistent lower back pain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://publications.nice.org.uk/low-back-pain-cg88/key-priorities-for-implementation|title=Low back pain: Early management of persistent non-specific low back pain |accessdate=29 April 2014[/tpl] However, analysis of peer-reviewed research yields little evidence that osteopathy is effective for non-musculoskeletal conditions, and limited evidence that osteopathy is an effective treatment for some types of neck pain, shoulder pain, or limb pain.
The scope of practice of osteopathic practitioners varies by country. In general, osteopaths trained outside of the U.S. are not physicians, and are limited in practice to non-invasive manual therapies,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aacom.org/about/osteomed/Pages/TheDifference.aspx |title=The Difference Between U.S.-Trained Osteopathic Physicians and Osteopaths Trained Abroad |author= |year=2012 |work= |publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine |accessdate=17 December 2012[/tpl] and may provide nutritional, postural, and other health advice. Conversely, U.S.-trained osteopathic physicians practice the entire scope of modern medicine. To avoid confusion, the American Osteopathic Association recommends using the terms osteopathic physician (U.S.-trained only) and osteopathic medicine to distinguish individuals trained in osteopathic medicine in the United States from osteopaths trained in manual osteopathic treatment, the restricted-scope form of osteopathy found in other countries around the world.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Resolution301_A2010_FinalVersion.pdf | title=House of Delegates Resolution H-301 – RE: H229-A/05 Osteopath & Osteopathy – Use of the Terms[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/?p=26191 |title=Crosby J.

==History==

The practice of osteopathy began in the United States in 1874. The term "osteopathy" was coined by Andrew Taylor Still, MD, DO. Still was a physician and surgeon,[tpl]cite web|url=http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/atsu&CISOPTR=693&REC=1 |title=Medical Registration for Macon County, MO as of March 27, 1874, Missouri Digital Heritage, Secretary of State of Missouri |accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|[tpl]cite web |url=http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/atsu&CISOPTR=759&CISOBOX=1&REC=2 |title=Medical registration for Adair County, MO dated 28 July 1883 |publisher=Missouri Digital Heritage, Secretary of State of Missouri[/tpl][/tpl] Kansas state and territorial legislator,[tpl]cite web|url=http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/atsu&CISOPTR=685&REC=2 |title=Six Survivors of First Free State Legislature in Kansas, Topeka Daily Capital, Missouri's Digital Heritage, Secretary of State of Missouri |publisher=Cdm.sos.mo.gov |accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl] a free state leader,[tpl]cite web|url=http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/atsu&CISOPTR=670&REC=1 |title=Charles E.

Still, Kirksville, Missouri, 1908, p. 97-8. who lived near Baldwin City, Kansas at the time of the American Civil War. In Baldwin, he developed the practice of osteopathy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lasr.net/pages/city.php?Baldwin%20City&Kansas&City_ID=KS0301001&VA=Y&Attraction_ID=KS0301001a017 |title=Baldwin City, Kansas |quote=Among Free State leaders was Andrew T. Still, founder of osteopathy, whose theory of healing developed here.[/tpl]
Still named his new school of medicine "osteopathy," reasoning that "the bone, osteon, was the starting point from which he was to ascertain the cause of pathological conditions."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.meridianinstitute.com/eamt/files/webster1/webcont.html#HOW%20I%20CAME%20TO%20ORIGINATE%20OSTEOPATHY |title=Early American Manual Therapy[/tpl] Still founded the American School of Osteopathy (now A.T. Still University of the Health Sciences) in Kirksville, Missouri, for the teaching of osteopathy on 10 May 1892. While the state of Missouri granted the right to award the MD degree,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nj.gov/highereducation/AGMEC/osteopathic_med_school_accreditation_standards.pdf |title=Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation |publisher=State of New Jersey[/tpl] he remained dissatisfied with the limitations of conventional medicine and instead chose to retain the distinction of the DO degree.[tpl]cite web|url=http://history.osteopathic.org/educate.shtml |title=Osteopathic Virtual Museum |accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl] In 1898 the American Institute of Osteopathy started the Journal of Osteopathy and by that time four states recognized osteopathy as a profession.[tpl]cite journal|title=General Notices|journal=Popular science monthly|date=Mar 1898|page=710|url=http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/20879097|accessdate=14 May 2013[/tpl]

==Osteopathic principles==

The osteopathic medical philosophy is defined as health care that embraces the unity of the living organism's structure (anatomy) and function (physiology). The following are the four major principles of osteopathic medicine:[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/Documents/GOT2011ed.pdf | title=Glossary of Osteopathic Terminology | work=Educational Council on Osteopathic Principles (ECOP) | publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM)|date=November 2011|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl]
These principles are not held by osteopathic physicians to be empirical laws; they serve, rather, as the underpinnings of the osteopathic philosophy on health and disease.

==Techniques of osteopathic treatment==

Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT in the U.S. or simply "osteopathic treatment" elsewhere) is the therapeutic application of manually guided forces by an osteopathic physician (U.S. usage) to improve physiologic function and/or support homeostasis that has been altered by somatic dysfunction. Somatic dysfunction is defined as impaired or altered function of related components of the somatic (body framework) system: skeletal, arthrodial and myofascial structures and their related vascular, lymphatic and neural elements. Acute somatic dysfunction is an immediate or short-term impairment or altered function of related components of the somatic (body) framework. It is characterized in early stages by vasodilation, oedema, tenderness, pain, and tissue contraction. It is diagnosed by history and palpatory assessment of tenderness, asymmetry of motion and relative position, restriction of motion and tissue texture change.  Chronic somatic dysfunction is the impairment or altered function of related components of the somatic (body framework) system. It may be characterized by tenderness, itching, fibrosis, paresthesias, and tissue contraction.
While there are many treatment techniques, OMT methods utilized may broadly be classified as active or passive and direct or indirect in nature.

==Scope of manual therapies==

A small subdivision of UK osteopathic practitioners are known as "classical osteopaths". They refer to their practice as a style of whole or "total" body adjustment. They contend that structural strains and patterns, through effects on circulation, reflexes and sensory feedback, precede pathological tissue states due to the downrating of for example arterial microcirculation or lymphatic drainage. They claim that the treatment lead to successful patient outcomes in a great number of functional and pathological disorders, including infections and degenerative conditions. Traditionally, great emphasis is put on the clearance of the products of metabolism.  The approach is contentious even within osteopathy, in a similar way to cranial osteopathy.

==Effectiveness==

In general, the results of randomized, controlled clinical trials have not proven osteopathy to be an effective therapy. Reviews of scientific literature produce little evidence that osteopathic manipulation is effective for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain,[tpl]cite journal |author=Posadzki P, Ernst E |title=Osteopathy for musculoskeletal pain patients: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials |journal=Clin. Rheumatol. |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=285–91 |date=February 2011  |pmid=21053038 |doi=10.1007/s10067-010-1600-6 |type=Systematic review[/tpl] or for pediatric conditions.[tpl]cite journal |author=Posadzki P, Lee MS, Ernst E |title=Osteopathic manipulative treatment for pediatric conditions: a systematic review |journal=Pediatrics |volume=132 |issue=1 |pages=140–52 |date=July 2013  |pmid=23776117 |doi=10.1542/peds.2012-3959 |type=Systematic review[/tpl]
A 2013 Cochrane Review reviewed six randomized controlled trials which investigated the effect of four types of chest physiotherapy (including OMT) as adjunctive treatments for pneumonia in adults and concluded that "based on current limited evidence, chest physiotherapy might not be recommended as routine additional treatment for pneumonia in adults."[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006338.pub3 |title=Chest physiotherapy for pneumonia in adults |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2013 |last1=Yang |first1=M |last2=Yuping |first2=Y |last3=Yin |first3=X |last4=Wang |first4=BY |last5=Wu |first5=T |last6=Liu |first6=GJ |last7=Dong |first7=BR|pmid=23450568 |issue=2 |pages=CD006338 |editor1-last=Dong |editor1-first=Bi Rong |volume=2[/tpl]
In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence only recommend osteopathy for the treatment of persistent lower back pain. They say there is insufficient scientific evidence that osteopathy is effective for non-musculoskeletal conditions, or that osteopathy is an effective treatment for neck pain, shoulder pain, or limb pain.

==Osteopathy around the world==

The osteopathic profession has evolved into two branches, non-physician manual medicine osteopaths and full scope of medical practice osteopathic physicians. These groups are so distinct that in practice they function as separate professions. In recent years, the profession has actively attempted to enhance exchange and dialogue between them. The regulation of non-physician manual medicine osteopaths varies greatly between jurisdictions.  In Australia, the UK, and New Zealand the non-physician manual medicine osteopaths are regulated by statute and practice requires registration with the relevant regulatory authority. The Osteopathic International Alliance has a country guide with details of registration and practice rights and the International Osteopathic Association has a list of all accredited osteopathic colleges.[tpl]cite web|title=Directories|url=http://www.oialliance.org/directories.htm|publisher=Osteopathic International Alliance|accessdate=27 July 2012[/tpl]
Several international and national organizations exist relating to osteopathic education and political advocacy.  One such organization, the World Osteopathic Health Organization (WOHO),[tpl]cite web|last=Comeaux |first=Zachary |url=http://www.woho.org/ |title=World Osteopathic Health Organization – World Osteopathic Health Organization |accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl] permits individual membership by both "restricted scope manual therapist" osteopaths and "full scope of medical practice" osteopathic physicians.  Similarly, there is also an international organization of organizations for national osteopathic and osteopathic medical associations, statutory regulators, and universities/medical schools offering osteopathic and osteopathic medical education, known as the Osteopathic International Alliance (OIA).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oialliance.org/ |title=Osteopathic International Alliance |accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl]
The following sections describe the legal status of osteopathy and osteopathic medicine in each country listed.

===Australia===

In Australia, all osteopaths complete a minimum of five years university training in anatomy, physiology, pathology, general medical diagnosis and osteopathic techniques. They are also trained to perform standard medical examinations of the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory and nervous systems.

===European Union===

There is no universal regulatory authority for the practice of osteopathy or osteopathic medicine within the European Union; it is on a country by country basis.

===Germany===

Germany has both osteopathy and osteopathic medicine. There is a difference in the osteopathic education between non-physician osteopaths, physiotherapists, and medical physicians.
Physiotherapists are a recognized health profession and can achieve a degree of "Diploma in Osteopathic Therapy (D.O.T.)." Non-physician osteopaths are not medically licensed. They have an average total of 1200 hours of training, roughly half being in manual therapy and osteopathy, with no medical specialization before they attain their degree. Non-physician osteopaths in Germany officially work under the "Heilpraktiker" law. Heilpraktiker is a separate profession within the health care system. There are many schools of Osteopathy in Germany; most are moving toward national recognition although such recognition does not currently exist.Osteopathy in Germany, Osteopathic International Alliance. Retrieved 26 February 2011. In Germany there are rules (at the country level) under which persons (non-physicians) may call themselves Osteopath.Verordnung einer Weiterbildungs- und Prüfungsordnung im Bereich der Osteopathie- Hessen, hier online
Osteopathic physicians in Germany achieve a degree of "D.O.- DAAO" or "D.O.M.", from the DAAO and DGOM respectively. Osteopathic physicians in Germany are fully licensed with at least 6,500 hours in medical school 6 years, at least 7,000 hours in specialty training, which is 3 to 6 years, plus at least 680 hours of training in manual medicine and osteopathy before attaining their degree. German physicians who have obtained the degree designation Dr. med., and who have completed their medical education and specialty training in areas such as general practise, orthopaedics, neurology, internal medicine, etc. can earn a Diploma in Osteopathic Medicine, either a DO-DAAO from the DAAO (German-American Academy for Osteopathy), a DOM™ from the DGOM (German Society of Osteopathic Medicine), or an MDO (Medical Doctor of Osteopathy) from the DGCO (German Society for Chirotherapy and Osteopathy) if additional educational requirements are met. The additional education includes a 320-hour program in manual medicine and an additional minimum of 380 hours in osteopathic medicine, which together makes a minimum of 700 hours. The osteopathic medicine course is limited to physicians only.Osteopathic Medicine in Germany, Osteopathic International Alliance. Retrieved 25 February 2011.
The scope of practise for a US-trained osteopathic physician in Germany is unlimited. A foreign physician may apply for licensure with the regional medical authorities, the Health Ministry, which represents the state in which the applicant intends to work. The regional state health ministry has information regarding the types of medical providers needed in that area and therefore grants work permits to licensed physicians depending on the specialty of the foreign physician.

The practice of osteopathy has a long history in the United Kingdom. The first school of osteopathy was established in London in 1917 by John Martin Littlejohn, Ph.D., M.D., D.O., a pupil of A.T. Still, who had been Dean of The Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine. After many years of existing outside the mainstream of health care provision, the osteopathic profession in the UK was finally accorded formal recognition by Parliament in 1993 by the Osteopaths Act.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1993/Ukpga_19930021_en_1.htm |title=Osteopaths Act 1993 |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl] This legislation now provides the profession of osteopathy the same legal framework of statutory self-regulation as other healthcare professions such as medicine and dentistry.
The General Osteopathic Council (GOsC) regulates the practice of osteopathy under the terms of the Osteopaths Act 1993. Under British law, an osteopath must be registered with the GOsC to practice in the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.osteopathy.org.uk/information/about-osteopathy/ |title=About osteopathy |author= |work= |publisher=General Osteopathic Council |accessdate=7 March 2013[/tpl] The General Osteopathic Council has a statutory duty to promote, develop and regulate the profession of osteopathy in the UK. It fulfills its duty to protect the interests of the public by ensuring that all osteopaths maintain high standards of safety, competence and professional conduct throughout their professional lives. In order to be registered with the General Osteopathic Council an osteopath must hold a recognized qualification that meets the standards as set out by law in the GOsC's Standard of Practice.Standards of Osteopathic Training & Practice, General Osteopathic Council This Act provides for "protection of title" A person who, whether expressly or implication describes himself as an osteopath, osteopathic practitioner, osteopathic physician, osteopathist, osteotherapist, or any kind of osteopath is guilty of an offence unless he is registered as an osteopath. There are currently approximately four thousand osteopaths registered in the UK.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oialliance.org/pdf/uk_osteopathy.pdf |title=United Kingdom |author= |work=Osteopathy |publisher=Osteopathic International Alliance |accessdate=7 March 2013[/tpl]
In the United Kingdom, courses in Osteopathy have recently become integrated into the university system. Instead of receiving a Diploma in Osteopathy (DO), with or without a Diploma in Naturopathy (ND), graduates now become Masters or Bachelors of Osteopathy, or Osteopathic Medicine, (BOst or MOst) or else Bachelors of Science (BSc) in Osteopathy or Osteopathic Medicine, according to the institution attended: in this case osteopathy and osteopathic medicine are synonymous, but these degrees do not lead to prescribing rights.
The recognition of osteopathy also means that doctors can now refer patients to osteopaths for treatment with the transfer of clinical responsibility rather than simply delegating the responsibility for care, as is the case with other healthcare professionals. It may or may not be a covered benefit under the National Health Service depending on where in the UK you may live.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.osteopathy.org.uk/information/nhs-private-treatment/ |title=General Osteopathic Council, accessed 26 February 2011 |date=9 May 2009 |accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl]
Osteopathic medicine is regulated by the General Osteopathic Council (GOsC) under the terms of the Osteopaths Act 1993 and statement from the GMC.  The London College of Osteopathic Medicine,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lcom.org.uk/ |title=London College of Osteopathic Medicine |accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl]  teaches osteopathy only to those who are already physicians.
Foreign-trained osteopathic physicians, who are registered with the GMC and GOsC, hold both a full medical practise and osteopathic license. Each applicant will have to pass the Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board test (PLAB) and work for one supervised year in the National Health Service (NHS). Following that year, the applicants will be able to apply for full registration (unsupervised practice or private practice). If the physician is already a specialist, postgraduate training will need to be separately recognized by the GMC."Osteopathic Medicine in the United Kingdom," Osteopathic International Alliance.

===United States===

Licensure or registration of non-physician osteopaths is not permitted anywhere in the United States. European style osteopaths are prohibited from calling themselves osteopaths. In contrast, osteopathic physicians earn the degree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.), a degree equivalent, though different in certain aspects, to that of Doctor of Medicine (M.D.).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/40/physician.pdf |title=Medicine |author= |work= |publisher=American Medical Association |accessdate=20 March 2013[/tpl]Dennis L.

Osteopathic medicine in the United States has always meant a physician trained in and entitled to the full scope of medical practice. Osteopathy or osteopath as written in some U.S. state and federal laws refers only to osteopathic medicine or osteopathic physicians, respectively.Resolution 301, H229-A/05 Osteopath & Osteopathy – Use of the Terms, Approved by the AOA House of Delegates, July 2010. With the increased internationalization of the profession, these older terms have fallen out of favor as generally accepted use due to the confusion they may cause.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/?p=24181 |title=AOA House reasserts preferred terms osteopathic physician, osteopathic medicine, Carolyn Schierhorn, The DO, August 4, 2010 |date=4 August 2010 |accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/?p=26191 |title=Promoting DOs: Words, medium change, but message stays the same, John B.
