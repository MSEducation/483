Live at the Lower Manhattan Ocean Club is a live album by David Murray. It was originally released as two volumes on the India Navigation label in 1978 and re-released in 1989 on a single CD (with a slightly edited final track). It features a live performance by Murray, Lester Bowie, Fred Hopkins and Phillip Wilson recorded in concert at the Lower Manhattan Ocean Club, NYC.

==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 3 stars stating "This double CD, which packages together the two original LPs, captures David Murray's quartet (trumpeter Lester Bowie, bassist Fred Hopkins and drummer Phillip Wilson) in high spirits. The six selections (four are over ten minutes and "For Walter Norris" exceeds 21) are full of spirit, looseness, humor, screams and screeches. Some of it rambles on too long (and Murray's soprano on "Bechet's Bounce" is quite silly) but it generally holds on to one's attention.".Yanow, S.  Allmusic Review accessed July 5, 2011
