Al-Nabi Rubin ([tpl]lang-ar|النبي روبين[/tpl]) was a Palestinian village located 28 kilometers northeast of Acre. Al-Nabi Rubin students used to attend school in the nearby village of Tarbikha.

==History==

In the late 19th century, Al-Nabi Rubin was described as a small village located on a hilltop, around a tomb, or "Neby". There were about 90 Muslim villagers. Arable land, fig and olive trees surrounded the village. Two cisterns and a "birket" was also near.Survey of Western Palestine, 1881, I, p.149.

===1948, and afterwards===

The village was captured by Israel as a result of the Haganah's offensive, Operation Hiram during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and was mostly destroyed with the exception of its shrine. Al-Nabi Rubin inhabitants were expelled to Lebanon in two waves, the aged and infirm were the last to depart when the IDF trucked them to the Lebanese border.Morris, Benny, (second edition 2004 third printing 2006) The Birth Of The Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-00967-7 pp 506-507
