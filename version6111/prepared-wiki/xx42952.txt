==Etymology==

The order Lepidoptera contains moths and butterflies characterized by having a complete metamorphosis; larvae transform to pupae and then metamorphosing into adult moths or butterflies.The Gypsy Moth: Research Toward Integrated Pest Management, United States Department of Agriculture, 1981[tpl]rp|9[/tpl] The family is Lymantriidae.[tpl]rp|9[/tpl] Lymantriid larvae are commonly called tussock moths because of the tufts of hair on larvae.[tpl]rp|9[/tpl]
The meaning of the name Lymantria dispar is composed of two Latin-derived words. Lymantria means 'destroyer'.Free Dictionary for Lymantria The word dispar is derived from the Latin word that means 'to separate' and it depicts the differing characteristics between the sexes.[tpl]rp|9[/tpl]
The North American gypsy moth and the European gypsy moth are of the same species, often listed as Lymantria dispar dispar.[tpl]rp|6[/tpl] Confusion over the species and subspecies, for classification still exists. The U. S. Department of Agriculture defines the Asian Gypsy Moth as "any biotype of Lymantria dispar possessing female flight capability",[tpl]rp|5[/tpl] despite Lymantria dispar asiatica not being the only classified subspecies that is capable of flight.[tpl]rp|6[/tpl] Traditionally, Lymantria dispar has been referred to as "gypsy moths" even when referring to Japanese, Indian and Asiatic gypsy moths.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fs.fed.us/foresthealth/technology/pdfs/Pogue_Lymantria_web.pdf | title=A review of selected species of Lymantria Huber 1819 | publisher=Forest Health Technology Enterprise Team | accessdate=September 14, 2012 | author=Pogue, Michael[/tpl][tpl]rp|5[/tpl]
