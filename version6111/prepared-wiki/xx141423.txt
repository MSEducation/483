Yerucham ben Meshullam ([tpl]lang-he|ירוחם בן משולם[/tpl], 1290-1350), often called Rabbenu Yerucham (רבנו ירוחם), was a prominent rabbi and posek during the period of the Rishonim. 

==Biography==

Yerucham was born in Provence, France. In 1306, after the Jewish expulsion from France, he moved to Toledo, Spain. During this time of his life, he became a student of Rabbi Asher ben Jehiel. In the year 1330, he began writing his work Sefer Maysharim. He completed this work in four years. At the end of his life, he wrote Sefer Toldos Adam V'Chava.

==His works==

Various components of halacha, as ruled by Rabbenu Yerucham, have been codified in the Shulchan Aruch in the name of Rabbeinu Yerucham. He greatly influenced Rabbi Yosef Karo.
He is quoted extensively by Rav Karo in both the Shulchan Aruch as well as the Beis Yoseif on the Tur.(see Tur Choshen Mishpat 29:3 for a 'small' example).
The Sefer Maysharim deals with civil law.

==Jewish Encyclopedia==

French Talmudist; flourished in the first half of the fourteenth century. According to Gross, he lived in Languedoc, but on the banishment of the Jews from that province (1306) he settled at Toledo, where he devoted himself to the study of the Talmud under the direction of Asher ben Jehiel and Abraham b. Ishmael. Jeroham was the author of two casuistical works: "Sefer Mesharim," on the civil laws (Constantinople, 1516), and "Toledot Adam we-Ḥawwah" (ib.). The latter work is divided into two parts, the first being entitled "Adam"; the second, "Ḥawwah." The first part considers the laws and regulations that come into force before marriage, such as those regarding circumcision, instruction, prayer, Sabbath ordinances, etc.; the second part deals with the laws and observances that become obligatory at and after marriage, such as those connected with betrothal, marriage, etc.
