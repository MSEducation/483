The Double, in association football, is the achievement of winning a country's top tier division and its primary cup competition in the same season. It can also mean beating a team both home and away in the same league season, a feat often noted as doing the double over a particular side.
The first club to achieve a double was Preston North End in 1889, winning the FA Cup and the Football League in the inaugural season of the league.

Due to the sporadic nature of football competitions in the country, with a league not in place until the 21st century, and only the United Football League (UFL) to last more than a season, and a national cup competition not being consistently held annually, achieving a double has been mostly impossible until recently. The establishment of the UFL in 2009 led to annual league and cup tournaments. The institution of the PFF National Men's Club Championship (the national cup) in 2011 (next held in 2013) after years of dormancy meant that a domestic treble could now be contested. In 2013, a super cup is expected to be played, paving the way for a UFL treble.
Since the establishment of the UFL in 2009, a league double has been achieved twice. A domestic double (a title each from the UFL and the PFF) or a domestic treble (a UFL double and a PFF title) has yet to be won.

It should however be noted that Svenska Cupen wasn't introduced until the 1941 season while Allsvenskan started for the 1923–24 season. Svenska Cupen was also not played between 1954 and 1966. It should also be considered that winning Allsvenskan did not grant the title of Swedish champions until 1931 and between 1982 and 1992 when the title was given to the winner of other cup tournaments that were organized at the end of the league season.[tpl]cite web | url=http://svenskfotboll.se/allsvenskan/historik/ | title=Svenska mästare 1896–1925, 1931– | trans_title=Swedish champions 1896–1925, 1931– | publisher=The Swedish Football Association | work=svenskfotboll.se | accessdate=22 August 2012 | language=Swedish[/tpl] The number of doubles for IFK Göteborg and Malmö FF are affected by this. IFK Göteborg won the Swedish Championship together with Svenska Cupen in one additional season to the table below, they won the two titles in 1983, a year when they did not win Allsvenskan. Additionally while Malmö won Allsvenskan in 1989, they were not Swedish Championships for that season as they did not win the play-off following the ordinary league play. All other teams in the table below won the Swedish Championship in their double-winning seasons. The latest club to win a double is AIK who completed the feat in 2009. In 1982, IFK Göteborg also managed to combine it's double with winning the UEFA Cup.

===[tpl]flagicon|Zanzibar[/tpl] Zanzibar===

In Zanzibar only one team has won the Double of the Zanzibar Premier League and the Nyerere Cup (defunct).

==League & League Cup Double==

A rarer, and less coveted, domestic double is that of winning the league championship and the League Cup. In many leagues this can not be done as there is no second domestic cup competition (as in Italy and the Netherlands) or it has been disbanded (such as in Spain and Denmark). The format of league cups and the number of participating teams can vary enormously from one country to another. In the case of Germany, it should be noted that the DFB-Ligapokal was played in the summer months prior to the Bundesliga and therefore was won in the preceding calendar year to the title win.

==Doubles in lower divisions==

In many countries, knock-out competitions exclusive to clubs outside the top division(s) also exist. This gives lower ranked clubs a chance to win a double. Examples include:

==Trans-State Double==

A very rare event. A Trans-State double occurs when a club wins a league and a cup which technically belong to two different countries and different associations. This happens as a result of a change in the political situation in the club's home country. There are two useful examples:

==European Doubles==

==The European Double (Double Champions)==

In the same spirit as the European Treble, the European Double consists of winning the top tier European tournament (currently the UEFA Champions League) and domestic league title in a single season or calendar year. This has been achieved on 23 occasions by 15 clubs from 56 European competitions. FC Barcelona has achieved this on the most number of occasions (4). Ajax Amsterdam and Real Madrid are the only teams that have successfully defended a European Double. José Mourinho has the unique distinction of being the only manager to achieve this double with two different clubs, having done so with F.C. Porto (2004) and Internazionale (2010).

==The Unbeaten Double==

In 1994–95, Louis Van Gaal's Ajax with players such as Jari Litmanen, Patrick Kluivert, Marc Overmars, Finidi George, Nwankwo Kanu, Frank and Ronald de Boer, Edgar Davids, Clarence Seedorf, Winston Bogarde, Michael Reiziger, and Edwin van der Sar succeeded an unbeaten double, winning the Dutch Eredivisie with a 27–7–0 record, and the UEFA Champions League with a 7–4–0 record. Van Gaal's dream team was the only club to achieve a European Double with no defeat.

==League & Europa League Double==

The UEFA Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup), with a domestic league title win, offers the chance for a club to win a lesser European double; but arguably a more prestigious achievement than a domestic double. This has been completed on fourteen occasions.
[tpl]note label|Note15|g|g[/tpl] In 1987, Gothenburg finished third in the Allsvenskan. At this time, the title was decided by a play-off between the top four teams. They defeated first placed Malmo FF in the play-off final.

==League & Cup Winners' Cup==

Simlarly, there were six occasions of clubs winning their League and the now defunct UEFA Cup Winners' Cup (CWC). No club ever won the CWC as part of a recognised treble. In the case of FC Mageburg and Dynamo Kiev, it is also worth noting that the domestic Championships they won are also now disbanded, due to German reunification and the disintegration of the Soviet Union respectively.

==Continental Double Outside of Europe==

Outside the UEFA confederation winning the Continental Double may be won in a calendar year, rather than a single season.

==Cup Double==

There are various possible combinations of winning two knock-out competitions.

==Domestic Cup Double==

A Domestic Cup Double consists of winning both domestic cup competitions in a single season or calendar year (for seasons when this double was won in conjunction with the league title see Domestic Treble). Examples include:

==European Cup Double==

There have been several occasions when a club has won its Association's cup or League Cup and a UEFA trophy but not its League title. For European cup doubles won in conjunction with the League title, see The Treble.
[tpl]note label|Note15|L|L[/tpl] A unique Cup Treble.

==Other==

A combination of domestic league or cup and a lesser domestic or continental trophy may be won in the same season. Examples include (this list does not include doubles achieved as part of a treble):

==International Double==

A national team cannot usually win a FIFA World Cup and their continental championship in the same year because they are usually not held in the same year (except for the Africa Cup of Nations), but one which wins both titles consecutively could be said to have "done the double".
