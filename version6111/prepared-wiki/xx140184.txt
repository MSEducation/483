==Apollo XVII (1972)==

A few bars of The Fountain in the Park were sung on the Moon by NASA Astronauts Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan on the Apollo 17 mission. Schmitt started by singing "I was strolling on the Moon one day..." when Cernan joined in. Cernan kept with the original "merry month of May", however, while Schmitt sang "December", which was the actual date at the time. After a brief debate, Schmitt resumed, singing "When much to my surprise, a pair of bonny eyes..." until he could no longer remember the lyrics and began vocalizing the notes instead. Moments later, Capsule Communicator Robert A. Parker cut in from Houston, saying "sorry about that, guys, but today may be December."

==Cartoons==

The song was used in The Nifty Nineties a Mickey Mouse cartoon, Baby Puss a Tom and Jerry cartoon, Elmer's Pet Rabbit a Bugs Bunny cartoon, and Treehouse of Horror III an episode of The Simpsons. The Real Ghostbusters started singing it in an episode titled, "Very Beast Friends." Alvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1962 album The Chipmunk Songbook. In Hanna-Barbera cartoons, it featured in a Top Cat episode titled "The Missing Heir" and more earlier, a Flintstones episode titled "The Hot Piano" featured Barney Rubble (voiced by the versatile Melvin Jerome Blanc) playing the song with the shop assistant, much to Fred Flintstone's annoyance. The song was used as background music in the Animaniacs episode "Potty Emergency". And Singing Shield was singing in Sabrina: The Animated Series in the episode "Xabrina: Warrior Princess".
