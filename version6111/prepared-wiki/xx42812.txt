==Early life==

Born in Colwyn Bay, Wales, she was brought up in a show business family. Her mother was Elaine Smith, a former showgirl, actress and writer of erotic novels, who used the stage names Helene Thornton and Heller Torren. Until late in her life, Yates believed her biological father to be Jess Yates, who was known as "the Bishop" and hosted the ITV religious programme Stars on Sunday. Jess Yates and Elaine Smith were married from 1958 to 1975. Jess Yates was sixteen years older than his wife, and their marriage was unconventional. Jess Yates was sacked as the Stars on Sunday presenter in 1974 because of newspaper stories about his private life.
In an unsettled childhood, Paula attended school at Rowen Primary School, Penrhos College, Ysgol Aberconwy. The Yates family ran the Deganwy Castle Hotel for a time, before moving to a large house in Rowen, Conwy. After the break-up of her parents' marriage in 1975, Paula lived mostly with her mother, including periods in Malta and Mallorca where she was a pupil at Bellver International College, before returning to Britain.

==Career==

In 1979, Yates began her career as a music journalist with a column called "Natural Blonde" in the Record Mirror, shortly after posing for Penthouse magazine. She first came to prominence in the 1980s, as co-presenter (with Jools Holland) of the Channel 4 pop music programme The Tube. She also appeared alongside friend Jennifer Saunders in 1987 for a spoof 'mockumentary' on Bananarama.
In 1982, she released a version of the Nancy Sinatra hit song "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.secondhandsongs.com/song/6437.html |title=These Boots Are Made for Walkin' |publisher=Secondhandsongs.com |accessdate=25 February 2012[/tpl]
After the birth of her daughters, Yates wrote two books on motherhood.
Yates continued with her rock journalism, in addition to being presenter of the cutting-edge music show The Tube. She became most notorious for her "on the bed" interviews on the show The Big Breakfast, produced by her husband, Bob Geldof. 
On 27 October 1995, Yates appeared on the quiz programme Have I Got News for You and had witty banter with Ian Hislop, and the two jokingly clashed. Yates referred to Hislop as "the sperm of the devil", to which Hislop replied, "Even your insults emanate from the genitals!"

==Death==

On 17 September 2000, on Pixie's 10th birthday, Yates, 41, was found dead at her home in London of a heroin overdose. The coroner ruled that it was not a suicide, but a result of "foolish and incautious" behaviour.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/drugs/Story/0,2763,394722,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=TV star killed by heroin 'binge' | first=Tania | last=Branigan | date=9 November 2000 | accessdate=22 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1013404.stm | work=BBC News | title=Heroin overdose killed Yates | date=8 November 2000 | accessdate=22 May 2010[/tpl]
A friend disclosed during the inquest, that Yates hadn't taken illegal drugs for nearly two years, and the coroner, Paul Knapman, concluded that though the amount Yates had taken would not have killed an addict, as "an unsophisticated taker of heroin" Yates had no tolerance to the drug.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/nov/09/drugsandalcohol.taniabranigan|title=TV star killed by heroin 'binge'|last=Branigan|first=Tania|date=9 November 2000|work=http://www.theguardian.com|accessdate=11 April 2014[/tpl] 
Soon after her death, Geldof assumed foster custody of Tiger Lily with the willing consent of Hutchence's parents, so that she could be brought up with her three older half-sisters, Fifi, Peaches and Pixie. Her aunt, Tina Hutchence, the sister of Michael Hutchence, was denied permission by the judge to apply for Tiger Lily to live with her in California.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1078627.stm | work=BBC News | title=Tiger Lily to live with Sir Bob | date=19 December 2000 | accessdate=22 May 2010[/tpl]
