Bullfinch is a small town in the Eastern Wheatbelt region of Western Australia.
The town is based around the gold mining industry and was originally gazetted in 1910.
Gold was first discovered in the area in 1909 and the name "Bullfinch" was the name of one of the original leases issued. The Bullfinch mine closed in 1921, but other mines opened during a boom following World War II.[tpl]LandInfo WA|c|B|4 October 2008[/tpl]
