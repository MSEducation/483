Pago Pago ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɑː|ŋ|ɡ|oʊ|ˈ|p|ɑː|ŋ|ɡ|oʊ[/tpl]; Samoan: [tpl]IPA-sm|ˈpaŋo ˈpaŋo|[/tpl]) is the capital of American Samoa. In 2000, its population was 3,656. The city is served by Pago Pago International Airport.  Tourism, entertainment, food, and tuna canning are its primary industries.

==History==

From 1878 to 1951, the area was the site of a coaling and repair station for the U.S. Navy, known then as United States Naval Station Tutuila.
In January 1942 Pago Pago Harbor was shelled by a Japanese submarine, but this remained the only battle action on the islands during World War II.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
On September 29, 2009, an earthquake struck in the South Pacific, near Samoa and American Samoa, sending a tsunami into Pago Pago and surrounding areas. The tsunami caused moderate to severe damage to villages, buildings and vehicles and caused an unknown number of deaths."Disaster aid flows to tsunami-hit Samoas". MSNBC.

==Geography==

The village is located in Pago Pago Harbor, on the island of Tutuila. Pago Pago is one of the many villages in the Urban agglomeration of Pago Pago along the shore of Pago Pago Harbor located at the very eastern part (inside) of the embayment. The area includes a number of villages, among them Fagatogo, the legislative and judicial area, and Utulei, the executive area."Pago Pago (American Samoa)". Britannica Online Encyclopedia.
However, because the name Pago Pago is associated with the harbor itself—the only significant port of call in American Samoa—Pago Pago is now generally applied not only to the village itself, but to the whole harbor area and to the villages in it.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] It is in this sense that Pago Pago becomes the de facto capital town of American Samoa.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
Both the port itself and the legislature of American Samoa—known as the "Fono" ([tpl]IPA|/ˈfono/[/tpl])—are in Fagatogo, a village adjacent to Pago Pago. Similarly, the once famous Rainmaker Hotel (now closed) is in the village of Utule‘i, adjacent to Fagatogo along the south shore of the long harbor. The canneries are in Atu'u, on the harbor's north shore. It is suggested that one must avoid eating any fish or invertebrate caught in Pago Pago Harbor because they are contaminated with heavy metals and other pollutants.
Pago Pago is a mixture of semi-urban communities, a small town, tuna canneries, which provide employment for a third of the population of Tutuila, and a harbor surrounded by dramatic cliffs, which plunge almost straight into the sea. A climb to the summit of Mt. Alava in the National Park of American Samoa provides a bird's-eye view of the harbor and town.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]

==Tourism==

Until 1980, one could experience the view of Mt. Avala by taking an aerial tramway over the harbor, but on April 17 of that year a U.S. Navy plane, flying overhead as part of the Flag Day celebrations, struck the cable; the plane crashed into a wing of the Rainmaker Hotel.Moos, Grant. 1980 1997. "April 17, 1980: Fiery crash halts Flag Day". Samoa News,  April 18, 1980 (reprinted in the Samoa News, January 22, 1997: 4). Cited in Sorensen, Stan, and Joseph Theroux. The Samoan Historical Calendar,  1606–2007. p. 93. The tramway was repaired, but closed not long after. The tram remains unusable, although according to Lonely Planet, plans have been put forth to reopen it, but in December 2010 the cable was damaged by Tropical Cyclone Wilma, fell into the harbor and has not been repaired.
