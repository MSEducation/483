New Orleans rhythm and blues refers to a type of R&B music from the U.S. city of New Orleans, Louisiana, characterized by extensive use of piano and horn sections, complex syncopated "second line" rhythms, and lyrics that reflect New Orleans life.
Distinct innovation and creativity, in combination with a musicality unique to the New Orleans area distinguish this sub-genre. It was also a major influence on ska and reggae, the former being a local variation on New Orleans R&B and jazz, such as the Fats Domino song "Be My Guest".[tpl]Citation | last=Coleman | first=Rick | title=Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the lost dawn of rock 'n' roll | publisher=Da Capo Press | year=2006 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=Galk1rd04GEC&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210 | isbn=0-306-81491-9[/tpl]
