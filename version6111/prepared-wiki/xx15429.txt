The Libertarian Movement Party (Spanish: Partido Movimiento Libertario; PML) is a political party based on classical liberalism in Costa Rica.
It was founded in May 1994 and has since enjoyed a number of victories. It succeeded in getting attorney Otto Guevara elected to the  Legislative Assembly in its first campaign in 1998. In 2002, Guevara ran for president (unsuccessfully, 1.7% of the vote), and the party at the legislative elections won 9.3% of the popular vote and 6 out of 57 seats. A few weeks after taking office, one Congressman left the party and became independent, leaving PML with five seats. In 2006, Guevara again ran for president (unsuccessfully, 8.4% of the vote), and the party at the legislative elections won 9.1% of the popular vote and 6 out of 57 seats. In the 2010 general election Guevara was again the PML's presidential candidate and received 20% of the popular vote.
The PML was an observer of the Liberal International or LI, and recently attained full status according to the LI website; so therefore it is also listed as a liberal party.

==Purpose==

The party claims to represent hundreds of thousands of Costa Rican citizens from all walks of life, tired of politics, parties, traditional politicians, and the country's deteriorating situation.
