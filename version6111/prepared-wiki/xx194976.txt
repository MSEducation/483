Norristown State Hospital, originally known as the State Lunatic Hospital at Norristown, is an active psychiatric hospital located outside the city of Philadelphia in Norristown, Pennsylvania. Designed 1878–80, by Wilson Brothers & Company, it was the first institution in the country that recognized female physicians and the first to house a pathology department.
It serves the five counties of the Southeast Region of Pennsylvania: Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia providing service to men and women in General Psychiatry and Forensic Psychiatry.

==History==

===Overview===

In May 1876, under Public Law 121, the Pennsylvania Legislature called for the establishment of a state mental hospital to serve the Southeastern District of Pennsylvania.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/PublicLaws/law02/law02121.htm |title=Public Law 121 |publisher=Google  |accessdate=October 19, 2011[/tpl]
Ground was broken on March 12, 1878 after John Rice was appropriated a contract of $600,000 from the Legislature to construct seven wards, the administration building and to their supply the buildings to accommodate the overcrowding which was taking place in the insane wards of the Philadelphia Almshouse.
The construction was completed on February 17, 1879.
Situated on two hundred and sixty-five acres, the original design of the hospital was similar to the Kirkbride plan with echelons on both sides of the central administration building with two-story ward-buildings with two wards on each floor connected by covered passage ways. The kitchen, laundry and boiler house et al. sat directly behind administration. This model allowed for the separation of patients into areas based on their level of functioning.
From the main gate, a gradual rise in terrain brings the visitor to the entrance of the administration building as he is greeted with a tiled floor, ornamental brick wainscot, growing plants bringing verdure into winter and an electrically arranged clock – all showing a modern taste in architecture.
Roads and sewers were built and a large portion of the grounds were enclosed by an iron fence eight feet high. Barns and a root-house were also constructed. The sewage was emptied into Stony creek until it was found to be injurious.
Under the supervision of Dr. Robert H. Chase and Dr. Alice Bennett, the hospital received its first patient, a female, on July 12, 1880 along with groups of individuals who were admitted from other state hospitals and county almshouses.

===Construction and Design===

The supreme control of the entire institution is placed in a board of trustees of thirteen members, all of whom serve in rotation in an executive committee of five, which holds weekly sessions.
The general dimensions of the separate ward buildings are [tpl]convert|277|ft|m[/tpl] in length by [tpl]convert|90|ft|m[/tpl] in depth. Each ward building consists of a basement, used for steam-heating ducts and workshops, and two main stories, each containing two wards and giving four wards to each building. Each ward is complete in itself, with separate rooms, dormitory, dining-room, bath-room, etc. The wards are ventilated by stacks with steam coiled at the base for creating the drought that draws the impure air from the wards.
The entire institution is well supplied with water and gas, and is heated by steam from the central boiler-house. The buildings stand upon an elevated plateau, the main front facing south-east, and are surrounded by extensive grounds. Connected with the hospital and owned by the State are about three hundred acres of land, portions of which are devoted to truck-gardens, whose cultivation furnishes wholesome employment to some of the patients.Johann Georg Heck (1889)Iconographic Encyclopaedia of the Arts and Sciences. Iconographic Publishing Co. 134–135
During annual reports from the turn of the 20th century, the water from the artesian wells was reported to be excellent, the closets and soil pipes were old but odorless. The food was also excellent, the milk boiled but slightly deficient in quantity, great care is used by the trustees to secure the best meat but at times it does spoil in very humid weather.Pennsylvania. State Board of Health and Vital Statistics. (1900)Annual report of the State Board of Health and Vital Statistics of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Volume 15. State Printer, 221–222
Patients partook in forms of occupation in the following areas of the hospital:
In 1889, it was reported that the dormitories contained [tpl]convert|14580|cuft|m3[/tpl], usually occupied by twenty-two patients nightly; deducting the usual allowances for space occupied by patient, bed and bedding, leaves about [tpl]convert|650|cuft|m3[/tpl] of air for each. The single rooms contain [tpl]convert|1188|cuft|m3[/tpl], with frequently two patients in a room. Added to this, the air of the corridors is vitiated by 15 to 30 patients sleeping in them at night.

==First Female Physician==

Dr. Alice Bennett, a graduate of the Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania was appointed head of the Women’s Department, the first woman in the nation to direct a female division in a mental institution.Ruth J. Abram. (1986) Pennsylvania State Hospital for the Insane, Send us a lady physician: women doctors in America. W. W. Norton & Company, 172–178. This notion removed all possibilities of abuse or immodest behavior by male patients and staff.
Bennett profited from the Victorian notion that as a woman physician, she could best treat patients of her own sex and in turn, introduced her own ideas of patient management.
She encouraged independence and self-esteem and which, through its humane example, would elicit behaviors of kindness and civility in the patients who were encouraged to make visits home, to engage in “productive” occupations like housework, sewing, and knitting and to take advantage of the fresh air and beautiful grounds.  She also made special note of holiday celebrations which drew the female patients together.

===First Female Assistant Physician===

In late 1880, Dr. Bennett was joined by Woman’s Medical College Class of 1879 graduate Dr. Anna Kugler who was appointed first assistant physician in the Women’s Department.
With one attendant for every twelve patients, Kugler and Bennett managed a large department, already overcrowded, understaffed and under-funded. They were responsible for the physical health of the residents, as well as attending to their medical and surgical needs.

==Accusations==

===Experimentation===

In 1892, the Board of Public Charities[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nikrAAAAYAAJ&dq=pennsylvania+Board+of+Public+Charities&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=xSF-2x5rT4&sig=_JmNAR6dky5PdBZh8qs1E9fNEvI&hl=en&ei=EEK5Sv7cIpLg8Qa1pYSfDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1 |title=Annual report of the Board of ... – Pennsylvania. Board of Public Charities, Pennsylvania. Board of Public Charities. Committee on Lunacy – Google Books |publisher=Google  |date=August 13, 2008 |accessdate=October 19, 2011[/tpl] accused the medical staff under the order of Dr. Bennett of surgical experimentation after the removal of the ovaries of six women were reported as a cure for insanity. Under the alluring title, "An Experimentation in Castration" the New York Medical Record editorially gives the following unique item of news:
 
 An interesting experiment has suddenly come to grief at the Norristown Insane Asylum, Pa. Some of the medical staff became much impressed with the value of castrating women as a therapeutic measure in insanity.

James J. Levick states, “Insanity is a disease of the brain, not of some organ remote from it. And when manifestation of insanity seem to be especially associated with functional disturbances of some one organ, this disturbance is secondary to the brain disorder, not the cause of it.” Those who opposed this procedure greatly rejoiced that, “the hospitals and the profession are saved from a scandalous proceeding.”
It was further questioned whether Gynecology should be practiced in Asylums and if an insane person should be treated gynecologically just as any other person would be treated and that an examination, diagnosis and treatment ought to be instituted independent of her mental condition.

===Abuse===

Mary Ritchie, eighty years old, had her arm fractured because she refused to take a bath. She was seized by two of the attendants, and in the struggle her arm was broken. Mary Green, one of the attendants, was then discharged by the committee.
Jacob Miller also had an arm broken by the attendants, and three of the men employed in the male department were discharged. These unfortunates had suffered most at the hands of the attendants, but it was stated that other patients had been treated in a shameful manner.Miscellany, The Medical Times and Register, Volume 18. The Medical Publishing Company, 708.
On August 4, 1883, William A. J. Fiss died in the hands of James Gaffey, an attendant, after he struck Fiss. Fiss became incoherent and died from blood poisoning at 12:45 am.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=990DE2D6123BE033A2575BC0A96E9C94629FD7CF |title=The Insane Asylum Murder. - Gaffey, The Attendant, Accused Of The Crime By The Coroner'S Jury. - View Article |work=New York Times |accessdate=October 19, 2011 |date=August 8, 1883[/tpl]

==Modern Day==

Across from a neighborhood of bungalows and rowhouses along the Norristown-West Norriton border, Norristown State Hospital stretches for 225 rolling, tree-lined acres with roughly thirty buildings. Some of the buildings have been rented to social-service providers and government agencies, while others are used for outpatient clinics.
The Hospital's population is now roughly three hundred and eighty. Before psychiatric drugs became widely available and more emphasis was placed on allowing the mentally ill to avoid long-term commitments, the growth in population had once reached a total of four thousand seven hundred patients in 1954 overfilling its occupancy.

==Future==

The future of Norristown State Hospital is up for debate. Two state agencies, the Department of General Services and the Department of Public Welfare, oversee the hospital, but neither has a plan for its future. Total closure seems unlikely and the one hundred and thirty-six patient forensic unit for criminally committed patients is often near capacity.
There is a precedent for turning obsolete parts of Norristown State Hospital into an asset for the neighborhoods around it such as the neighboring Norristown Farm Park, an immense public park on land where patients once raised crops and livestock.
