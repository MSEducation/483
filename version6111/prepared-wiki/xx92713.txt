==Career==

Brown grew up in the suburbs of New York City, and attended the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York for 2 years.Weber, Bruce."If Only the Cool Kids Could See Him Now (at Least Hear His Songs)"The New York Times, October 1, 2008 During summer, he attended French Woods Festival of the Performing Arts in Hancock, New York. He said Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and Sunday in the Park with George were two of his biggest influences, and had it not been for them, he would have joined a rock band and tried to be Billy Joel.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Jason Robert |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=Nicely done, schmuck |journal=The Sondheim Review |volume=XVI |issue=4 |pages=25 |publisher=Sondheim Review, Inc. |issn=1076-450X |doi= |url= |accessdate= [/tpl]
When Brown was 23, he and a friend were invited to see a musical by Stephen Sondheim himself. At the show, they sat in front of the New York Times' Frank Rich. They went to dinner, and after twenty minutes, Sondheim asked them what they thought of the show: they both were silent. Brown described the dinner after that moment as "many extremely awkward silences punctuated by bursts of frantic, desperate conversation about anything other than the slaughtered elephant in the room." Brown called mutual friend Daisy Prince the next day, asking if there might be any way to repair the damage after the dinner. She and her family decided that Brown should call Sondheim. Brown paraphrased what Sondheim said: thumb|right|200px|Brown at CD signing in New York, 2013
 Nobody cares what you think. Once a creation has been put into the world, you have only one responsibility to its creator: Be supportive. Support is not about showing how clever you are, how observant of some flaw, how incisive in your criticism. There are other people whose job it is to guide the creation, to make it work, to make it live; either they did their job or they didn't. But that is not your problem.
 If you come to my show and you see me afterward, say only this: "I loved it". It doesn't matter if that's what you really felt. What I need at that moment is to know that you care enough about me and the work I do to tell me that you loved it, not "in spite of its flaws", not "even though everyone else seems to have a problem with it", but simply, plainly, "I loved it." If you can't say that, don't come backstage, don't find me in the lobby, don't lean over the pit to see me. Just go home, and either write me a nice email or don't. Say all the catty, bitchy things you want to your friend, your neighbor, the Internet.
Maybe next week, maybe next year, maybe someday down the line, I'll be ready to hear what you have to say, but at that moment, that face-to-face moment after I have unveiled some part of my soul, however small, to you: that is the most vulnerable moment in any artist's life. If I beg you, plead with you to tell me what you really thought, what you actually, honestly, totally believed, then you must tell me "I loved it." That moment must be respected."[tpl]cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Jason Robert |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=Nicely done, schmuck |journal=The Sondheim Review |volume=XVI |issue=4 |pages=26â€“27 |publisher=Sondheim Review, Inc. |issn=1076-450X |doi= |url= |accessdate= [/tpl]

He began his career in New York City as an arranger, conductor, and pianist, working on shows such as William Finn's A New Brain, and playing at several nightclubs and piano bars in the city. Songs for a New World marked the first major New York production of Brown's songs. An off-Broadway revue with a limited run, the show was directed by Daisy Prince, daughter of director/producer Hal Prince, and featured the 25-year-old Brown's pop-rock-influenced music.'Songs for a New World' listing lortel.org, accessed February 1, 2010  The song "Stars and the Moon" has since become a cabaret standard, and is probably Brown's best-known composition to date.
Brown was introduced to Harold Prince through his association with Daisy Prince, and was hired to write songs for the Broadway musical Parade, based on the trial and lynching of Leo Frank. Parade, directed by Hal Prince, and with a book by Alfred Uhry, won Brown the 1999 Tony Award for Best Original Musical Score.Internet Broadway Database listing, Brown ibdb.com, accessed February 1, 2011 During this production, Livent, one of the producers of Parade, pulled out after reviews were not as positive as they'd hoped. RCA Victor, the other major producer, decided it would pull out as well. Brown said of the event in 1999, "Livent dropped out shortly after the reviews came out. They announced they would not spend another dime on the show. RCA had an agreement to record all of Livent's shows. But when Livent pulled out of 'Parade,' the RCA higher-ups said they were pulling out, too. I had to go to Billy Rosenfield and ask him: 'What if we pay for this record and you just distribute it?' Billy said, 'Sure.'" Brown had to try to scrounge money from every corner, "In the end, RCA put in $25,000, Lincoln Center put in a big chunk, around $200,000, including the producer Scott Rudin's $25,000, and there was a contribution from the Gilman and Gonzalez-Falla foundation, which has helped support a lot of musical theater composers over the years, of $40,000. Even Roy Furman, the new guy at Livent, gave us a little money. Somehow, we pulled it together." Livent also was struggling at the time because the company had mishandled funds while allying for bankruptcy protection.http://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/29/theater/theater-trying-to-keep-the-sound-of-musicals-alive.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm
Brown went back to working with Daisy Prince for his third major show The Last Five Years, for which he wrote the book as well as songs. Inspired by his own failed first marriage, the show is a two-person musical which tells the history of a relationship from two different perspectives. The male's narrative begins at the beginning of the story and progresses through marriage, infidelity, and divorce, while the female narrative begins at the end of the relationship and ends with the couple's first date; the two actors' only direct interaction takes place midpoint, during the wedding sequence.Sommer, Elyse "A CurtainUp Review, 'The Last 5 Years' " curtainup.com, March 5, 2002 The original Chicago cast consisted of Norbert Leo Butz and Lauren Kennedy, with Sherie Rene Scott over the New York run. The Last Five Years received mixed critical reviews and was not a commercial success, lasting only two months off-Broadway, although Brown garnered 2 Drama Desk Awards for music and lyrics. Additionally, due to the cast recording featuring Scott and Butz, the show has gained popularity among contemporary musical theater aficionados and is an oft-performed piece in regional and community theatres.'The Last Five Years' listing lortel.org, accessed February 1, 2010Holden, Stephen."A Composer Sells His Songs and Himself"The New York Times, February 12, 2007
Brown contributed several songs to the Broadway flop Urban Cowboy. He had worked as an orchestrator with director Phillip Oesterman on the Off-Broadway musical New York Rock, and Oesterman called on him to help him out with Urban Cowboy. Urban Cowboy had been denied the use of the Clint Black catalog, and Brown came in and wrote a few songs (with help from director Lonnie Price, who replaced Oesterman after he passed away).http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akB_dpXZkbY  The show was nominated, with 30 other composers, for the 2003 Tony Award for best Musical Score, losing out to Hairspray.Simonson, Robert."Urban Cowboy to Close on Broadway March 29; Will Tour in 2004", playbill.com, March 28, 2003
In June 2005, Brown released a solo album, entitled Wearing Someone Else's Clothes."Wearing Someone Else's Clothes" listing amazon.com, accessed February 1, 2010

He also teaches courses in musical theatre performance and composition at the University of Southern California. Brown is an active performer of his own work, singing and playing the piano with or without his band, the Caucasian Rhythm Kings (Gary Sieger, guitar, and Randy Landau, bass).
Brown's tween-oriented musical 13 premiered at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, CA on January 7, 2007. It opened on Broadway October 5, 2008 at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre, and closed on January 4, 2009.

==Musical style==

Brown has many trademarks in his composing style. His piano music is often extremely rhythmically challenging; his sheet music is released in a mostly unmodified format, posing many challenges to anyone who tries to play it. His songs are by no means easy to sing, either, with his choral music including many complex and unconventional harmonies and his songs (for men, in particular) covering a very wide vocal range. Most of his songs are written in AABA' form, the exceptions coming mostly in his show Parade. Perhaps most characteristic are his love duets; all four (I'd Give it All for You from Songs for a New World, All the Wasted Time from Parade, The Next 10 Minutes from The Last Five Years, and Tell Her from 13) are written in a very distinct format: male-female-both, compound time in the duet section (two using hemiola), and three of the four end with the couple singing the same pitch.
Brown is cited by Mark Shenton as one of the leading new theatrical composers (a list that includes Michael John LaChiusa, Adam Guettel, Andrew Lippa, and Jeanine Tesori, among others).Shenton, Mark."Broadways Young(er) Composers"The Stage, December 7, 2005
