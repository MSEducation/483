In 1916, the brothers organized the Loughead Aircraft Manufacturing Company in Santa Barbara to build a huge 10-place, twin-engined F-1 flying boat for their aerial sightseeing business. They began its construction in a rented garage, which soon attracted the attention of 20-year-old [[John Knudsen Northrop|
John K. "Jack" Northrop]]. Northrop was skilled in drafting and mathematics, and the Lougheads quickly put him to work helping to design the F-1.
When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Allan Loughead went to Washington, D.C. to try to get a Navy contract to build the F-1 in quantity.  The Navy informed Lockheed that it would purchase only previously approved designs.  Later, Loughead said of this visit, "Down there I lost all the patriotism I ever had." However, he did return with a contract to build two Curtiss flying boats and an agreement for the Navy to test the F-1.
When the F-1 was completed, Allan Loughead  and a crew of three flew it from Santa Barbara to San Diego in April 1918, setting a record of 181 minutes for the 211-mile flight. After the Navy completed its tests, the F-1 was returned to Loughead Aircraft and was then converted into the F-lA land-plane. Lockheed now hoped to interest the Army in it as a long-range bomber or transport plane. However, the war ended before its conversion was completed.
The Lougheads decided to demonstrate the long-range potential of the F-lA by making the first flight from Santa Barbara to Washington, D.C. Their crew included pilot Orvar "Swede" Meyerhoffer, co-pilot Aaron R. Ferneau, and mechanic Leo G. Flint. They took off from Santa Barbara on November 23 and headed over the Coastal Mountains. En route they encountered severe weather, but the weather cleared by the time they crossed the Colorado River at Yuma, Arizona. However, near Tacna, Arizona, an engine failed and Meyerhoffer made a rough landing on the desert. Flint worked on the engine while Meyerhoffer and Ferneau caught a train back to Yuma to have the broken tailskid repaired. Then the trio cleared a makeshift runway, took off safely and landed at Gila Bend, Arizona, for fuel. However, on the second takeoff attempt, the engine quit, and the plane crashed nose first into the ground. That ended the F-lA's transcontinental flight.
When Loughead Aircraft completed its two HS-2L flying boats for the Navy in early 1919, it then converted the damaged F-lA landplane back into the F-1 flying boat for its sightseeing flight operations. Among their most notable passengers were King Albert and Queen Elizabeth of Belgium, who the Lockheeds flew at the request of the U.S. government. Albert and Elisabeth were so impressed with their flight out to Santa Cruz Island that they presented Allan and Malcolm with the Belgium Order of the Golden Crown. In addition, local movie studios gladly paid $50 an hour for flight time in the F-1 and $50 an hour while on standby.
In 1919, Loughead Aircraft entered the small aircraft market with the revolutionary single-seat S-1 Sport Biplane. Intended to be "the poor man's airplane", it featured an innovative molded plywood monocoque fuselage for which the Lougheads, Northrop and Tony Stadlman received a patent. Its foldable wings allowed the plane to be stored in a garage, and the lower wings could be rotated to act as ailerons and airbrakes. Because no suitable engines were available, the company designed and built its own 25-horsepower water-cooled engine for the S-1.
The S-1 was tested successfully at Redwood City, CA in 1919 by Gilbert Budwig and flew well.  After the S-1 completed its test flights, the pilot said it was the most flyable plane he had ever flown. The plane went on to make hundreds of flights and proved to be a very successful design.
At an aircraft show in San Francisco, thousands admired the little S-1 aircraft, but not a single person ordered the $2,500 plane. Only then did Allan Loughead realize that the government's sale of war surplus aircraft for as little as $300 had killed the market for new aircraft. As a result, Loughead Aircraft closed in 1920 and its assets were liquidated in 1921.
Meanwhile, Malcolm Loughead formed the Lockheed Hydraulic Brake Company in 1919 to promote a revolutionary four-wheel hydraulic brake system that he had invented.  Tired of his name being mispronounced "Log-head," Malcolm officially changed the spelling to match its pronunciation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/kcet/chasingthesun/innovators/lockheed.html|title=Lockheed Brothers|work=Chasing the Sun|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2010-01-17| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100121032329/http://www.pbs.org/kcet/chasingthesun/innovators/lockheed.html| archivedate= 21 January 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Walter Chrysler introduced the Lockheed brake system on the first Chrysler car in 1924.  Malcolm sold his business to Bendix in 1932.

==Real estate business==

From 1920 to 1922, Allan Loughead was the Los Angeles sales manager for Lockheed brakes.
In the summer of 1922, Allan Loughead operated a unique ride concession at Catalina Island off Los Angeles. Called "The Thrill Of Avalon," it consisted of a touring car body mounted on two seaplane floats and powered by an aircraft engine driving a pusher propeller. However, the skimmer proved to be too rough and noisy to be popular and lasted only a year. Later, when asked if he made any profit on the venture, Allan laughed and said, "No, we went broke, which was not a new experience!"
In 1922, Allan Loughead became a real estate salesman in the Hollywood area. He wrote in 1942 that the real estate business was "not particulary interesting, but from a financial standpoint was very successful."Whenever possible, Loughead and Jack Northrop would get together and discuss ideas about new aircraft. By now Northrop was an engineer with the Douglas Aircraft Company.
In 1926, Allan Loughead and Jack Northrop decided that the time was right to build a high-speed monoplane with room for four passengers and a pilot in a streamlined fuselage using their patented monocoque construction. As a result, Northrop began drawing up such a plane at home.  The plans called for the plane to be powered by the new Wright Whirlwind engine. The only disagreement arose over the wing. Northrop wanted to use a self-supporting cantilever design that eliminated all wing struts. Loughead believed the public wouldn't want to fly in a plane with no visible wing supports. In the end, Northrop won out.

==Lockheed Aircraft Corporation==

Loughead and Northrop now set out to form an aircraft company. Loughead's accountant friend, Kenneth Jay, introduced them to Fred S. Keeler, a successful brick, tile and china manufacturer. After reviewing their proposal, he agreed to help finance the project. As a result, using $22,500 from Keeler and $2,500 from Loughead, the four formed the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in December 1926, with Keeler as president, Loughead as vice president and general manager, Northrop as Chief Engineer and Stadlman as Factory Superintendent.  They specifically incorporated the "Lockheed" spelling to associate themselves with Malcolm's successful brake company.
The company set up operations in a garage in Hollywood in January 1927.  However, while Loughead continued his real estate business, he showed up every afternoon to help on the plane. The first major task was to build a concrete mold, shaped like an elongated bath tub, for molding half of the laminated wood fuselage. Two halves were made and then fastened to a skeleton framework of wood to form the complete fuselage. Next came the construction of the plywood-covered cantilever wing, the tail surfaces, the landing gear and mounting the engine. When it was finished, the company had invested nearly $17,500 in the plane, which was named the Vega.  The result was an incredibly successful high-speed monoplane with a range of a thousand miles, a cruising speed of 185 miles per hour, and capacity for six people.
The timing of the Vega was propitious.  In 1927, Charles Lindbergh's flight from New York to Paris renewed a tremendous interest in aviation. Soon after, James D. Dole, president of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company, offered a prize of $25,000 ($[tpl]format price| [tpl]inflation|US|25000|1927|2011|r=-3[/tpl]  [/tpl] in 2011) to the first person to fly from North America to Hawaii after August 12, 1927. As a result, George Hearst, publisher of the San Francisco Examiner, bought the Vega for only $12,500 and entered it in the Dole Air Race under the name Golden Eagle. Later Loughead said, "The sales price represented a loss, but we were happy to absorb it. The prestige of selling the Vega to Hearst was tremendous." Besides, Hearst also ordered a Vega seaplane for a flight to Australia.
All the Lockheed personnel were on hand when the first Vega was trucked to a hayfield near Inglewood, California. There test pilot Eddie Bellande took it up on its first flight. Upon landing, he yelled, "Boys, she's a dandy, a real joy to fly!"

===Dole Race===

World War I flyer Jack Forst was picked to pilot the Golden Eagle with Gordon Scott as his navigator. The plane was provided with many safety features and equipped for thirty days of survival at sea. At noon on August 16, the starter's flag went down at Oakland's unfinished airport and the Travel Air Oklahoma took off first. Minutes later, the privately built El Encanto groundlooped off the runway. Then the Breese Pabco Pacific Flyer failed to get airborne. However, at 12:30 p.m. the Golden Eagle lifted easily from the ground and headed out over the Golden Gate for Honolulu. It was followed by the Buhl Miss Doran, the Breese Aloha, the Travel Air Woolaroc, and the Swallow Dallas Spirit. However, the Miss Doran, Oklahoma and Dallas Spirit soon returned with difficulties. Only the Miss Doran was able to go airborne again, and by 2 p.m., Loughead knew the Lockheed Vega was the fastest plane in the race.
None of the planes carried radio transmitters - all Loughead could do was to await the news from Hawaii. The airplanes were supposed to arrive about 1 PM the next day. The next morning, Jim Dole and the Race Committee gathered on Wheeler Field at Honolulu. After a long wait, the Travel Air Woolaroc landed after 26 hours and 16 minutes in the air, and Art Goebel and Bill Davis crawled out to claim the $25,000 first prize. Two hours later, the Breese Aloha landed, and Martin Jensen and Paul Schluter laid claim to the $10,000 second prize. Then as the minutes ticked away, it became apparent that the Golden Eagle and Miss Doran were down in the Pacific. Despite an extensive air and sea search, no trace of either plane was ever found.

===Arctic exploration===

Gloom fell over the Lockheed factory, even though a factory demonstrator Vega was underway. However, Arctic explorer Captain George Hubert Wilkins had spied the Golden Eagle from his San Francisco hotel window while it was on a test flight. He was so impressed that he went to the Oakland airport to learn more about it. Then he drove down to Hollywood and met with Loughead, Northrop, and others and pored over its drawings. In the end, he placed an order for the third Vega equipped for Arctic exploration. After it was flight tested in January 1928, by Eddie Bellande, he said, "She's a pippin!".
Wilkins selected Arctic flyer Carl Ben Eielson to pilot the Vega on a planned flight from Alaska, the northernmost settlement in Alaska, over the Arctic region to the island of Spitsbergen near Norway. After Eielson tested the plane, it was shipped to Fairbanks, Alaska.  Eielson and Wilkins then flew it to Barrow. From there, after waiting three weeks for good weather, they were able to take off from a crude ice runway and head for the island of Spitsbergen.
For the first [tpl]convert|500|mi|km[/tpl], the weather was clear. Then dense clouds forced them to change course frequently. They made landfall at Grant Land in Canada's Northern reaches. Then, as they edged around the northern tip of Greenland, they ran into more bad weather. Within [tpl]convert|200|mi|km[/tpl] of their goal, they encountered a raging blizzard. Fuel was now dangerously low, but Eielson spun down through a hole in the clouds and landed safely on snow covered land.
Unable to see anything in the blizzard, the men curled up in the cabin. The blizzard blew for the next four days. Finally, on the fifth day the weather cleared, and the men spent six hours clearing a makeshift runway in the snow. When they finally got airborne, they saw the radio masts of Green Harbor, Spitsbergen ahead. In less than a half hour, they landed there after spending 20.5 hours in the air and five days on the ground within sight of their goal!
Wilkin's flight across the Arctic was hailed as one of the greatest in aviation. Wilkins was knighted by King George V of the United Kingdom, while Eielson received the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Harmon Trophy from President Herbert Hoover. Even before he returned to the United States, Wilkins began planning an expedition to Antarctica and ordered a low-wing Lockheed Explorer seaplane. But he soon changed his order to a high-wing Vega seaplane. After he and Eielson arrived in Antarctica in December, 1928, they used the Vegas to make the first flights in history over the continent and to explore much of its uncharted territory from the air. Thus the Vega became the first plane to discover new land, and Wilkins named many of its features after his friends and backers. He named the Lockheed Mountains after the builder of his plane.

===Move to Burbank===

The Wilkins expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic brought Lockheed Aircraft a flood of orders and forced it to move into new facilities in Burbank, California, in March 1928. Lockheed received an order for twenty Vegas worth $250,000 ($[tpl]format price| [tpl]inflation|US|250000|1928|2011|r=-3[/tpl] [/tpl] in 2011), which was the largest commercial aircraft order to date. The nation's fledgling airlines also soon recognized the potential of the Vega as an airmail and passenger plane. Also, Northrop designed the parasol wing Air Express for Western Air Express as an airmail and a passenger plane. The Vega, Explorer and Air Express, and the variants that stemmed from them, were used by the biggest names in aviation, Art Goebel, Bob Cantwell, Frank Hawks, Amelia Earhart, Wiley Post, Roscoe Turner, Jimmy Doolittle, and others, to set a number of distance, speed and endurance records. This led Allan Loughead to coin the famous phrase, "It Takes a Lockheed to Beat a Lockheed."
In 1928 the company sales exceeded one million dollars.
The Lockheed Vega remained the primary product of the Lockheed Corporation.  The Vega was a high-wing, cantilever monoplane manufactured using the two-piece moulded-under-pressure streamlined plywood fuselage skin construction developed at Santa Barbara.  The plane was manufactured in both four-passnger and six-passenger variants.  By April 1929, the company was turning out five planes per week with less than 300 employees.  The retail sales price of thes planes averaged about $17,000 each.

===Acquisition by Detroit Aircraft Corporation===

In mid-1928, Jack Northrop left Lockheed Aircraft to start a company of his own.  Gerald Vultee later to found Vultee Aircraft became the new Lockheed chief engineer. Part of the reason Northrop left was that Lockheed's management refused to invest in developing new metal aircraft and chose to make the most money it could from its proven wood designs.
Meanwhile, the Detroit Aircraft Corporation, a holding company with assets of $28 million, began acquiring a portfolio of aviation companies.  In July 1929, Fred E. Keeler, an investor who owned 51 percent of Lockheed, decided to sell the company assets to Detroit Aircraft Company.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Aerospace/Lockheed_early/Aero13.htm| author=Judy Rumerman |title=Lockheed's Early Years, 1912-1940 |publisher=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission| year=2003[/tpl] The acquisition was through an exchange of stock.
Unhappy with this situation, Allan Loughead resigned as president and general manager on June 3, 1929, and later sold his Detroit Aircraft stock for $23 a share. With the stock market crash in October 1929, Detroit Aircraft stock fell to 12.5 cents a share and by 1932 Lockheed Aircraft was bankrupt.

===Receivership===

A group of investors headed by brothers Robert Gross and Courtland Gross, and including Walter Varney bought the Lockheed company out of receivership in 1932.  Allan Lockheed returned as a consultant but no longer had any formal management role with his namesake company. The Lockheed Aircraft Company went on to become a major aerospace and defense company, and in 1995 merged with Martin Marietta to form Lockheed Martin.Lockheed Martin History, Lockheed Martin website

==Later career==

In 1930, Loughead formed the Lockheed Brothers Aircraft Corporation in Glendale, California and developed the experimental Olympia Duo-four, a five-place high-wing monoplane with two engines mounted side-by-side in the wood monocoque fuselage nose."Two Motors in Nose of Plane Make Safer Flying" Popular Mechanics, December 1934 excellent photo at top-left of pg 900 It had a plywood-covered wing and wheel pants.  The fuselage was covered with a two-piece moulded-under-pressure plywood skin.   He made numerous flights in this plane demonstrating its extremely safe single-engine performance.  This fourth commercial aircraft venture by Loughead lasted until 1934.
In 1934, Loughead, tired of the many mispronunciations of his name, legally changed it from Loughead to Lockheed.
Lockheed spent the period from 1935 to 1936 as a consultant.
In 1937, Lockheed formed the Alcor Aircraft Corporation in San Francisco and developed the Alcor C-6-1, an 8-place, low-wing plane that also had excellent single-engine performance. Unfortunately, the prototype C-6-1 was lost over San Francisco Bay. During a 1938 test flight, the Alcor prototype went out of control.  A pilot and a passenger bailed out, "leaving the plane to descend in slow circles until it hit the waters of the Golden Gate and sank, as related in the 1957 Lockheed history, "Of Men and Stars."  The Alcor company folded in 1939.
"I guess Alcor was the final burnout for Dad," said his son, Allan Jr.  "He got only enough money from the insurance to pay off the creditors and close the doors."
Afterwards, Lockheed continued to make design studies of aircraft, such as fighters and bombers, for war use.
In 1941, Lockheed became Vice President of the Berkey & Gay Furniture Company in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he served as general manager of the Aviation Division and Director of Aircraft Engineering.
In August 1941, U.S. Commerce Secretary Jesse H. Jones appointed Lockheed to the Cargo Plane Committee, which also included Andre Preister, William Bushnell Stout, Luther Harris, and J.W. Crowley.  The committee was charged with drawing up basic design recommendations for a cargo plane for the Aviation Division of the Defense Supplies Corporation.  The committee's work was completed and accepted in January 1942.
In October 1942, Lockheed became the general manager of the Aircraft Division of Grand Rapids Store Equipment Company, making parts for Navy fighters.
After the war, Allan Lockheed continued his career as a real estate salesman in California, while also occasionally serving as an aviation consultant.
In the mid-1950s, Lockheed Aircraft Corporation asked Allan Lockheed to return as a consultant, mainly to help on the "Of Men and Stars" history being prepared by Lockheed public relations writer Phil Juergens."  Lockheed's son John Lockheed said that "Dad was delighted to come back to Lockheed."  Allan Lockheed, Jr., said, "It was a tremendous boost to his morale to be able to rejoin the company."
In 1961, Allan Lockheed moved to Tucson, Arizona, where he lived in semi-retirement.  However, he continued to do consulting work with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation.  Once, when someone asked Lockheed what he did in the early days of aviation, he answered, "I survived!"

==Death==

Allan Lockheed died of liver cancer in Tucson on May 28, 1969, at the age of 80.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941697,00.html |title=Milestones: Jun. 6, 1969|work=Time Magazine|date=June 6, 1969|accessdate=2010-01-17[/tpl]

==Legacy==

Lockheed was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio, in 1986.  His daughter, Beth, was present, and his son John accepted the award on Lockheed's behalf.
