In 1998 Dole bought several growers in Colombia and became the largest distributor of fresh-cut flowers in the US. However, by 2008 the flower business was losing money, and it was bought in January 2009 by a group of private investors.

===History===

The company traces its origin to the 1851 establishment of Castle & Cooke by missionaries Samuel Northrup Castle and Amos Starr Cooke. Castle & Cooke rapidly became one of the largest companies in Hawaii, investing in shipping, railroad construction, sugar production, and seafood packing. The other half of Dole's corporate heritage, the Hawaiian Pineapple Company, was founded in 1901 by James Dole, who opened his first pineapple plantation in the central plateau of the Hawaiian island of Oahu. Sanford Dole, the cousin of James, had been president of the Republic of Hawaii from 1894 after the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii (her last monarch, Queen Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani), and first governor of the Territory of Hawaii until 1903.[tpl]cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASHb5a9/8f7a506f.dir/Dole,%20Sanford%20Ballard.jpg |title= Dole, Sanford Ballard office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate= 2010-01-20 [/tpl]
The annexation of Hawaii to the United States made selling agricultural products to the mainland much more profitable, since they would never be subject to import tariffs.
In 1932, Castle & Cooke purchased a 21% interest in the Hawaiian Pineapple Company. In the 1960s, Castle & Cooke acquired the remainder of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company and the Standard Fruit Company and renamed the company "The Dole Food Company, Inc" in 1991. Castle & Cook also owned Bumble Bee Foods from 1961 until the 1980s.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bumblebee.com/about |title=Bumble Bee History & Timeline |publisher=Bumble Bee |location=San Diego, CA, USA |accessdate=October 6, 2012[/tpl]
It was then the third largest producer and U.S. importer of bananas. Dole and Chiquita remain the top two U.S. banana companies as of 2011.
In 2011, the company reported $7.2 billion in annual revenue. It is a publicly traded company on the NYSE (DOLE).
Castle & Cooke Inc, a real estate company, was spun off in 1995; it is currently operating as a subsidiary of Flexi-Van Leasing, Inc.
Dole operates plantations throughout Central and South America, and in the Asia-Pacific region, with plantations in the Philippines and two packing plants in Thailand, Hua Hin and Chumphon.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dole.co.th/en/#contact-us |title=Locations of Dole Food Company in Thailand |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2012 |work= |publisher=Dole Food Company |accessdate=9 September 2012[/tpl]

==Mascot==

In 1985 and 1986, the Dole banana was featured as the official banana of the Pittsburg State University (KS) Gorillas' athletic programs.  The project was the brainchild of then Pitt State radiosports play-by-play voice Scott Burton.  The introduction of the Dole banana as the official banana of the Gorillas delighted then Athletic Director David Suenram and Pittsburg State University sports fans alike.  The head football coach at the time of the promotion was Dennis Franchione.  Dole provided company trinkets for fan giveaways and the popularity of the Dole banana thrived in southeast Kansas and southwest Missouri (Joplin) during the promotion's two year run.

==Criticism and controversies==

===Legal cases===

In 2001, Dole was involved in the suit Del Monte Fresh Produce Co. v. Dole Food Co. with Del Monte Fresh over the potential misappropriation of Del Monte's specially-bred pineapple.

===Hawaiian coup===

James Dole, who founded the Hawaiian Pineapple Company, came to Hawaii in 1899, five years after his cousin (once removed), Sanford B. Dole had taken up position as first president of the  republic, following the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy.[tpl]citation |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/150/sesq2dole |title=James Dole |first=Michael |last=Tsai  |work=The Honolulu Advertiser |publisher=Black Press |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |date=July 2, 2006 |accessdate=October 4, 2012[/tpl] Although his elder cousin was involved with the takeover of Hawaii, James himself was a teenager living in Massachusetts at the time of the coup.[tpl]cite book |title= Men of Hawaii: a biographical reference library, complete and authentic, of the men of note and substantial achievement in the Hawaiian Islands |publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |location=Honolulu, HI, USA|year=1921 | editor-last=Siddall |editor-first=John William |volume=2 |series=The Story of Hawaii and its builders |id=[tpl]OCLC|80553001|32127632|16326675[/tpl] |lccn= 22017988 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4o8DAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA133 |page= 133 |accessdate=October 4, 2012[/tpl] However, the company's commercial activities would not have been possible without the later annexation of Hawaii to the US,[tpl]Citation |last=Okihiro |first=Gary Y |author-link=Gary Okihiro |year=2009 |title=Pineapple culture : a history of the tropical and temperate zones |chapter=Hawaiian Pine |series=The California world history library |volume=10 |publisher=University of California Press |publication-place=Berkeley, CA, USA |page=130 |isbn=9780520265905 |oclc=449860318[/tpl] which resulted in the removal of high import tariffs on Hawaiian products (see Overthrow).

===Food safety===

In 2005, 23 people in Minnesota were sickened with E. coli O157:H7. The source of the bacteria was found to be Dole brand bagged lettuce. Then in 2006, another E. coli outbreak that caused over 200 people to become ill and killed 3 more was linked to bagged spinach sold by Dole. The spinach was processed by Natural Selection Foods in California.[tpl]cite web|author=About E. coli |url=http://www.about-ecoli.com/ecoli_outbreaks/news/e-coli-found-in-water-wild-pig-near-california-spinach-farm/ |title=E. coli Food Poisoning |publisher=About-ecoli.com |date=2006-10-27 |accessdate=2012-10-05[/tpl]

In 2007, Nicaraguan plantation workers, represented by Los Angeles-based personal injury lawyer Juan Dominguez, sued Dole and Dow Chemical Company, claiming the use of illegal pesticides such as the now banned Nemagon (containing DBCP) had made them sterile. The pesticide was not banned in Nicaragua until after Dole ceased its operations within the country. The suit and two others were subsequently thrown out by California courts after it was concluded that “contrary to their sworn testimony, most of the plaintiffs never worked on Dole-affiliated banana farms and none were involved in the DBCP application process,” while similar lawsuits were filed in U.S. and Nicaraguan courts.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&sid=aS5ED.ApmVPk | work=Bloomberg | title=Dole Uses Judge Attack in Banana Case to Undo $2 Billion Awards | date=June 24, 2009[/tpl]
A lawyer for the Nicaraguans, Steve Condie, however, stated that some of the witnesses who gave testimony that the claims were fraudulent, had been paid by Dole.  The witnesses' identities were kept secret so that the plaintiffs' lawyers could not interview them.
Swedish film director Fredrik Gertten made a documentary film about Dominguez and the alleged banana workers. The movie Bananas!* premiered in the 2009 Los Angeles Film Festival. Dole said they had serious concerns about the film's accuracy and they urged festival officials to "immediately cease and desist" their sponsorship of the film.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bananasthemovie.com/wp-content/uploads/resources/letter_from_dole_may8_09.pdf |title=Letter from Dole, May 8, 2009 |first=Scott A.|last=Edelman |work=bananasthemovie.com |date=May 8, 2009 |accessdate=October 6, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bananasthemovie.com/interview-with-director-fredrik-gertten/ |title=Interview with director Fredrik Gertten | BANANAS!* |publisher=Bananasthemovie.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.33782/1.1591791/bananas_far_inte_tavla_pa_festival |title=Bananas får inte tävla på festival - Regionala nyheter |publisher=svt.se |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=About the film – BANANAS!*|url=http://www.bananasthemovie.com/about-the-film/#article[/tpl] 11 June 2009 - bananasthemovie.com The festival officials allowed the film to be screened, but it was not allowed to compete for placement in the competition. In addition, festival officials distributed information before the film's screening that indicated Dole believed the film to be factually inaccurate.
