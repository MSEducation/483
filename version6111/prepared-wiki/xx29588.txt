[[Life-cycle cost analysis]]

CATEGORIES: Project management

Life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) is a tool to determine the most cost-effective option among different competing alternatives to do a project, when each is equally appropriate to be implemented on technical grounds. For example, for a highway pavement, apart from the initial construction cost, LCCA takes into account all the user costs, (e.g., reduced capacity at work zones), and agency costs related to future activities, including future periodic maintenance and rehabilitation. All the costs are usually discounted and total to a present day value known as net present value (NPV). This example can be generalized on any type of material, product, or system.
Life cycle cost can be conducted in two approaches: deterministic and probabilistic method.
