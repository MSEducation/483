In 2011 Adebimpe directed "Nine Types of Light", the visual companion to the band's acclaimed fourth album. For the film, he recruited a roster of the band's favorite filmmakers to helm individual clips that would be sewn together into an abstract narrative about dreams, love, fame and the future. Adebimpe directed the video for the song "Forgotten", as well as the interstitial clips where a chorus of narrators help try to connect the dots between the film's various segments.[tpl]cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/tv-on-the-radio-makes-a-film/?_r=0|title=TV on the Radio Makes a Film|author=Melena Ryzik|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2013-10-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUa5DPnS41I |title=TV On The Radio - Forgotten |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-04-12 |accessdate=2013-10-30[/tpl]
