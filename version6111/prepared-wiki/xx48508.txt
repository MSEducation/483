Gallaudet University[tpl]efn|"Columbia Institution for the Deaf" was the corporate name for what is now Gallaudet University.  In 1954 a law was passed, changing the corporate name to "Gallaudet College."  (The collegiate department of the Columbia Institution had gone by the name "Gallaudet College" since 1894.)  In 1986, another law was passed changing the name to "Gallaudet University."[tpl]cite web|title=Title 20: Education|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title20/pdf/USCODE-2011-title20-chap55-subchapI-partA-sec4301.pdf|publisher=US Government Printing Office|pages=1097–1098[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|ɡ|æ|l|ə|ˈ|d|ɛ|t[/tpl] is a federally chartered private university for the education of the deaf and hard of hearing located in Washington, D.C., on a [tpl]convert|99|acres|km2[/tpl] campus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/gallaudet-university-1443|title=Gallaudet University |last=Staff|year=2013|publisher=U.S. News and World Report|accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl]
Founded in 1864, Gallaudet University was originally for both deaf and blind children.  It was the first school for the advanced education of the deaf and hard of hearing in the world and remains the only higher education institution in which all programs and services are specifically designed to accommodate deaf and hard of hearing students. Hearing students are admitted to the graduate school and a small number are also admitted as undergraduates each year. The university was named after Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, a notable figure in the advancement of deaf education.
Gallaudet University is officially bilingual, with American Sign Language (commonly abbreviated ASL) and English used for instruction and by the college community. Although there are no specific ASL proficiency requirements for undergraduate admission, many graduate programs do require varying degrees of knowledge of the language as a prerequisite.Communication & Culture Issues – Gallaudet University

==History==

===Summary timeline===

In 1856, philanthropist and former United States Postmaster General Amos Kendall became aware of several deaf and blind children in Washington, D.C. who were not receiving proper care. Kendall had the courts declare the children to be his wards and donated [tpl]convert|2|acre|m2[/tpl] of his land to establish housing and a school for them.[tpl]cite web|title=History of Gallaudet University|url=http://www.gallaudet.edu/Gallaudet_University/About_Gallaudet/History.html|publisher=Gallaudet University|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl] Edward Miner Gallaudet was the first superintendent of the new school. Later, John Carlin suggested placing a monument of Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet with Alice Cogswell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://deafbiography.com/biography/johncarlinbio.htm |title=John Carlin |publisher=Deafbiography.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10[/tpl]
In 1857, the 34th Congress passed H.R. 806, which chartered the grammar school as the Columbia Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind and funded tuition costs for indigent deaf, dumb, or blind children belonging to the District of Columbia.[tpl]cite web|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=011/llsl011.db&recNum=182|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl] Seven years later, in 1864, the 38th Congress authorized the institution to grant and confirm college degrees.[tpl]cite web|title=38th Congress: Session 1, Chapter 52|url=http://www.saveourdeafschools.org/an_act_to_authorize_the_columbia_institution_to_confer_degrees_april_8_1864.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|accessdate=16 July 2012[/tpl] The collegiate department became known as the National Deaf-Mute College. The following year, in 1865, the 38th Congress removed the instruction that the institution was to educate the blind, and renamed it the Columbia Institution for the instruction of the Deaf and Dumb.
In 1954, Congress amended the charter of the institution, changing the corporate name to Gallaudet College, which had been the official name of the collegiate department since 1894.[tpl]cite web|title=Gallaudet College Hearing Before the Committee on Education and Labor|url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/expansion_era.pdf|work=83rd Congress, Second Session|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=May 5, 1954|accessdate=16 July 2012[/tpl]
George Ernst Detmold was an instrumental figure in the development of Gallaudet, principally in the drama department. A Shakespeare scholar with a tone for the deaf, he fostered the development of the drama department at Gallaudet. In addition, as the Dean of Students, he was instrumental in gaining national recognition and accreditation.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
In 1986, Congress again amended the charter of the Institution, renaming it Gallaudet University.[tpl]cite web|title=US Code Chapter 55 – Education of the Deaf|url=http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/20C55.txt|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|accessdate=16 July 2012[/tpl]

===Early history (1859–1880)===

The school was established in 1857 with considerable efforts being made by several concerned citizens of Washington, D.C.  Two houses were used, one purchased and one rented. On November 1, 1858, the First Annual Report was submitted to the Secretary of the Interior.[tpl]cite web|title=First Annual Report |url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1858.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=1 November 1858|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl]
During the school's second full year of operation (1858–1859), 14 deaf students and 7 blind students were in attendance.  Superintendent Gallaudet, anticipating the future growth of the school, requested money for more buildings, lamenting the fact that the money was not issued in the year prior, due to federal budget problems. The Second Annual Report was submitted November 5, 1859.[tpl]cite web|title=Second Annual Report |url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1859.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=5 November 1859|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl]
During the third academic year (1859–1860), Kendall beseeched the federal government for funds to relocate the school to more spacious grounds. Gallaudet praised Kendall for donating money needed to construct a new brick building; however, both school buildings were already at capacity. There were 24 deaf students, necessitating a second teacher of the deaf.  The teacher of the 6 blind students resigned due to health concerns.[tpl]cite web|title=Third Annual Report |url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1860.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=5 November 1860|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl]
By the 1860–61 academic year, the Civil War had been in progress for over six months. Gallaudet reported that the students were safe and free from fear.  There were 35 deaf students and 6 blind students in attendance during the academic year.  An art teacher was hired for the first time.[tpl]cite web|title=Fourth Annual Report |url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1861.pdf |publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=5 November 1861|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl]
During 1861–62, new monies provided for industrial education were used to rent a nearby shop in order to teach cabinet-making to the male students.  Plans were underway to construct a new building using $9,000 that Congress appropriated to the school.  There were 35 deaf students and 6 blind students.  During vacation in August a regiment of troops used the brick building for a hospital, and some of the students who stayed over the summer helped with tending to the sick soldiers. One soldier died. For the first time, Gallaudet proposed expanding the school to create a college for deaf students.[tpl]cite web|title=Fifth Annual Report |url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1862.pdf |publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=3 November 1862|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl]
Even with new construction completed for the 1862-1863 school year, the school was still at capacity and more money was needed to purchase [tpl]convert|13|acre|m2[/tpl] of adjoining land and then build even more buildings.  Gallaudet asked for money to pipe in water from the river, as the existing cistern and well were inadequate to the school's needs.[tpl]cite web|title=Fifth Annual Report |url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1863.pdf |publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=15 October 1863|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl]
College-level classes were offered for the first time during the 1863-64 academic year. Congress provided approval for Columbia to grant college degrees, and an enabling act for the college was passed and approved by President Lincoln.  An elaborate inauguration ceremony was held in June with Laurent Clerc in attendance. Fourteen acres of land was purchased with money supplied by the government. Gallaudet was promoted to the position of president of the institution. He continued to push for funds for expansion and new buildings. Gallaudet also proposed discontinuing services for blind students, saying that the small number of blind students would be better served at the school for the blind in Baltimore.[tpl]cite web|title=Seventh Annual Report |url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1864.pdf |publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=17 November 1864|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl]
The enrollment numbers increased rapidly during the 1864–65 academic year. Gallaudet asked the government for money to accomplish several projects, including the construction of an ice house and a gas house, sewer lines, and more.  Major construction continued on campus.  The name of the collegiate department was changed to "National Deaf-Mute College".  The blind students were transferred to a school in Baltimore.[tpl]cite web|title=Eight Annual Report |url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1865.pdf |publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=6 November 1865|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl]
During the 1865–66 academic year, Gallaudet responded to criticism from supporters of the oral method in Massachusetts, saying that oral instruction is usually of little value to congenitally deaf children. Gallaudet proposed that a representative of the school be sent to Europe to study the methods employed there, in order to determine which types of instructional methods might be added to those methods already being used successfully at the Columbia Institution and other American schools.  Combined enrollment of all levels of instruction, including the collegiate level, exceeded 100 for the first time during this year.  There were 25 students enrolled in the college, including students from 14 states of all parts of the Union. Edward Allen Fay joined the faculty as a professor of history, having learned to sign as a child.[tpl]cite web|title=Ninth Annual Report |url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1866.pdf |publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=6 November 1866|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl]
In the 1866–67 academic year, the building for the primary school was extended and sickness was thereby reduced. A mathematics professor was hired for the first time. More money was needed to accommodate additional students expected to swell the ranks of the school.
Gallaudet gave a lengthy account of his travels to Europe and was very critical of the extent to which speech is taught to deaf children in European schools for the deaf.  Nevertheless, he recommended that a limited amount of speech training be afforded to deaf students in America to those who show they can benefit.  His travels took him to: Doncaster, England; Birmingham, England; Manchester, England; Liverpool, England; Glasgow, Scotland; Belfast, Ireland (Belfast, Northern Ireland); Dublin, Ireland; Geneva, Switzerland; Nancy, France, Saint-Hippolyte-du-Fort, France; Vienna, Austria; Leipsic, Saxony (Leipzig, Germany); Lubec (Lübeck, Germany); Frankfort On-the-Main (Frankfurt, Germany); Brussels, Belgium; Zurich, Switzerland; Rotterdam, Netherlands; Paris, France; Weissenfels, Prussia (Weißenfels, Germany); Prague, Bohemia; (Prague, Czech Republic);  Berlin, Prussia (Berlin, Germany); Milan, Italy; Genoa, Italy; Turin, Italy; Dresden, Saxony (Dresden, Germany); London, England; Edinburgh, Scotland; Bordeaux, France; Marseilles, France; Munich, Bavaria (Munich, Germany); Bruges, Belgium; St. Petersburg, Russia; Åbo, Finland (Turku, Finland); Stockholm, Sweden; and Copenhagen, Denmark.[tpl]cite web|title=Tenth Annual Report |url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1867.pdf |publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=28 October 1867|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl]
The biggest educational conference in the then-history of deaf education was held during the month of May 1868 in Washington, D.C., largely made up of principals of schools for the deaf.  Fourteen schools for the deaf were represented from 22 different states.  The chief topic of discussion was the recommendations put forth by Edward Gallaudet regarding adding articulation lessons to schools' curricula.[tpl]cite web|title=Eleventh Annual Report |url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1868.pdf |publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=26 October 1868|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl]
In 1868–69, the first students completed a full course of college studies, all graduating with bachelor's degrees.[tpl]cite web|title=Twelfth Annual Report |url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1869.pdf |publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=20 October 1869|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl]
The founder of the school, Amos Kendall, died in November 1869.  Gallaudet delivered a eulogy at the board meeting in January 1870.  The main central building was partially completed, with rooms in the basement and on the first floor first being used.  Plans were being made to purchase Amos Kendall's estate, which adjoined the grounds of the school.  Gallaudet cautioned Congress that Kendall's heirs had plans to subdivide the property if it was not sold to Columbia, and hence the land would never again become available for purchase as a whole.[tpl]cite web|title=Twelfth Annual Report |url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1870.pdf |publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=29 October 1870 |accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl]
In 1881, Laura Sheridan, a hearing woman, inquired about Gallaudet University's accepting women.  She was told that deaf women could not enter the institution. In 1887 Gallaudet agreed to allow women to apply with the intent that women would not stay. Temporary living arrangements were made and the college remained co-educational.Marschark, Marc, Lang, Harry G. and Albertini, John A. "Educating Deaf Students". Oxford University Press. 2002. p. 31

===Deaf President Now (1988)===

Student strikes at Gallaudet University starting March 6, 1988, revolutionized the perception and education of Deaf culture. Deaf students were outraged at the selection of another hearing president, Elisabeth Zinser; the university had never selected a deaf person for this position. Alumni, faculty, staff, and students demanded that the next president of the university be deaf. After a week of protest and activism, Zinser resigned and was replaced by I. King Jordan. This movement became known as Deaf President Now (DPN).

===Unity for Gallaudet Movement (2006)===

Jordan announced his retirement in September 2005. On May 1, 2006, the University's Board of Trustees announced that Jane Fernandes, the University's current provost, would be the University's next president. This was met with protests from the student body, both in person on campus and in internet blogs and forums.
Initially, students cited the lack of racial diversity among finalists, Fernandes's lack of warmth,The Chronicle of Higher Education: "Student Protests Over Presidential Pick Return to Gallaudet U." and her lack of fluency in American Sign Language.The Washington Post: "Gallaudet Names New President."
Jordan publicly accused some critics of rejecting Fernandes because "she is not deaf enough." He described the protest as "identity politics", saying, "We are squabbling about what it means to be deaf."Fox News: "Is Gallaudet University's Dean 'Deaf Enough'?"
The Washington Post reported that Fernandes "would like to see the institution become more inclusive of people who might not have grown up using sign language," stating that Gallaudet must embrace "all kinds of deaf people."The Washington Post: "Signs of Change At Gallaudet." Those who opposed her said that they feared a "weakening of American Sign Language at an institution that should be its standard-bearer."The New York Times: "Protests Continue at University for Deaf."
Protesters said Fernandes distorted their arguments and that the protest centered on her inability to lead, an unfair selection process and longstanding problems at the school.The Washington Post: "Source of Gallaudet Turmoil Is Up for Debate."
In the spring 2006 protest, students blocked entrances to the Gallaudet campus, held rallies, and set up tents near the University's main entrance. Fernandes, appointed to serve as president-designate until Jordan retired, said that she would not step down. On May 8, the faculty gave a vote of no confidence for Fernandes.
When the fall 2006 academic year resumed, some students, faculty, staff, and alumni continued their protest, calling for Fernandes to step down and for the presidential search to be done again. On October 11, a group of protesting students shut down the campus. On October 16 at a regularly scheduled meeting, faculty members voted 138 to 24 to block Fernandes from becoming president of Gallaudet University.
Fernandes said, "I really don't understand so I have to believe it's not about me. ... I believe it's about evolution and change and growth in the deaf community."The Washington Post: "Gallaudet Reopens With Protesters Still At Front Gates."
On October 29, the university withdrew the appointment of Fernandes.Inside Gallaudet: "Board of Trustees votes to terminate Dr. Jane Fernandes appointment as president" In an opinion piece in The Washington Post, Jordan defended Fernandes's remarks and denounced the board's decision and the actions of the protesters, saying, "I am convinced that the board made a serious error in acceding to the demands of the protesters by terminating Fernandes's presidency before it began."Gallaudet Chooses Interim President, Washington Post, December 11, 2006
On December 10, 2006, the Board of Trustees announced that Robert Davila would serve as interim president for a period of up to two years. He was formally installed on May 9, 2007, during a ceremony that included a speech by D.C. Congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who spoke positively of the 2006 protest.[tpl]cite web|title=Speech by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton at the Installation of Gallaudet President Robert R.

On June 29, 2007, in the aftermath of the controversy over the university's presidency, Gallaudet was temporarily placed on probation by its accreditation organization, the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.Inside Gallaudet – Gallaudet University  It was also reported that in 2006, the Office of Management and Budget had found that "Gallaudet failed to meet its goals or showed declining performance in key areas, including the number of students who stay in school, graduate and either pursue graduate degrees or find jobs upon graduation."On Probation, Washington Post, July 14, 2007. In January 2007, former president Jordan wrote an editorial on the topic that appeared in the Washington Post.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/21/AR2007012101118.html?sub=AR | work=The Washington Post | title=Deaf Culture and Gallaudet | date=January 22, 2007 | accessdate=May 3, 2010 | first=I.

==Academics==

Several programs and majors are offered at Gallaudet University. The five most popular majors are 
education, communications, business, psychology, and mathematics. Almost 90 percent of the classes offered at Gallaudet University contain fewer than 20 students.[tpl]cite web|title=Gallaudet University|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/gallaudet-university-1443/academics|publisher=US News & World Report|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl] The freshmen retention rate at the university is relatively low, at 65.8 percent, and the graduation rate is also low, at 8 percent.

==Campus==

The Gallaudet campus has been designated a historic place on a number of registries and surveys:

==Athletics==

Gallaudet is a member of NCAA Division III and the North Eastern Athletic Conference.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gallaudetathletics.com/sports/generalnews/2008-09/06152009GallaudetJoinsNEAC |title=Gallaudet Bison Athletics : Gallaudet University Joins North Eastern Athletic Conference |publisher=Gallaudetathletics.com |date=2009-06-15 |accessdate=2012-07-16[/tpl] The teams that play in the North Eastern Athletic Conference are the men's and women's basketball, cross country, soccer teams, along with the baseball, softball, and volleyball teams. However, the Gallaudet football team plays in the Eastern Collegiate Football Conference. In addition to the football team, which plays in a different conference than most sports at Gallaudet, the men's and women's swimming teams, as well as the men's and women's track and field teams, compete as independents. The Bison compete in baseball, basketball, cross country running, football, indoor and outdoor track and field, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, volleyball, and wrestling. Their colors are buff and blue, which were chosen after Union soldiers' uniforms in the Civil War.

===Women's basketball===

Prior to the arrival of Coach Kevin Cook in 2006, the Gallaudet Women's basketball team was nothing more than mediocre. The team had not yet had a full-time basketball coach. In 2006, Kevin Cook took over as the head basketball coach after spending 10 years in the WNBA, coaching the Nigerian Women's Basketball team and coaching overseas. Cook became the first ever head Women's Basketball coach at Gallaudet. Cook did not anticipate such a large project in turning around the women's basketball team, but also faced problems with communication. Coach Cook did not know sign language. Since taking over as coach, Cook has learned ASL and signs during practices. Cook uses an interpreter during games.[tpl]cite news|last=Donvan|first=John|title=Gallaudet University Making Noise in Women's Basketball|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/gallaudet-university-making-noise-womens-basketball/story?id=12908803|accessdate=14 May 2013|date=February 3, 2011|agency=ABC News[/tpl]
Prior to Cook's arrival, the Gallaudet Women's Basketball team had not won a conference game in five years and even lost a game by 75 points in Cook's first year in charge. Cook's persistence on defense and discipline turned the program around. Gallaudet began the 2010–11 season on a 20 game winning streak and finished the season 24–4 (20–2 in conference play). Cook was named North Eastern Athletic Conference Coach of the Year, and senior Easter Faafiti was voted NEAC Player of the Year. The 2010–11 season ended in the first round of the Division III NCAA Championships with a loss to Juniata.[tpl]cite web|title=Parade magazine feature on Gallaudet University's women's basketball season|url=http://www.d3hoops.com/seasons/women/2010-11/contrib/201103195aj906|work=D3hoops.com|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=14 May 2013[/tpl]
After a victory over Penn State-Berks in the 2010–11 season, Penn State guard Corin Bishop "said that she views the Gallaudet team as a great basketball team, not a team of deaf players." Hayes of Gallaudet later said, "I feel like there are people who stereotype us as deaf players, I'm just like everyone else who plays basketball". With national media coverage of the Gallaudet Women's Basketball team surrounding the great run throughout the 2010–11 season, it is clear that the accomplishments of Gallaudet's female athletes are transcending the basketball court while giving Gallaudet students the opportunity to show their pride. In an interview with Lydia Lum of Diverse, he said, "Because of us, there's a growing awareness that there are differences between deaf people, but we're all the same."[tpl]cite web|last=Lum|first=Lydia|title=Gallaudet Women on the Road to Winner's Circle|url=http://diverseeducation.com/article/14820/|work=Diverse Issues in Higher Education|publisher=Cox, Matthews and Assoc.|accessdate=14 May 2013[/tpl]

===Football===

The football huddle originated at Gallaudet when the team noticed that their opponents were trying to see and read their signs in order to try to guess their plays.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pr.gallaudet.edu/GallaudetHistory/page3.html |title=The History of Gallaudet University (page 3) |publisher=Pr.gallaudet.edu |date=1997-11-07 |accessdate=2012-07-16[/tpl]
After an undefeated season in 2005, which was achieved after 122 years, head coach Ed Hottle began his campaign to return Gallaudet to the NCAA ranks. With support from the Gallaudet administration, the Bison played their last season of club football in 2006 and played a full NCAA slate of eight games in 2007.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/15/AR2007081501367.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Sound and the Fury | first=Brooke | last=Foster | date=August 19, 2007 | accessdate=May 3, 2010[/tpl]
After the 2009 football season, Coach Hottle left to become the first head coach of the first football team at Stevenson University. He announced his decision in a heart-felt meeting with the football team. Offensive Coordinator Chuck Goldstein was tapped to be the interim head coach of the football team. On December 17, 2009, the interim tag was removed and he is now the permanent head coach of the team.[tpl]cite web|title=Goldstein Named Gallaudet's 36th Head Football Coach, Davis Elevated to Assistant Coach|url=http://gallaudetathletics.com/sports/fball/2009-10/releases/coachingmoves|publisher=Gallaudet University|accessdate=16 July 2012[/tpl]
Gallaudet University's football team has a longstanding rivalry with Catholic University of America, another school in the Washington D.C. area.

==Quotations==

"America does mean opportunity.  But it was not until 1864 that that great principle found illustration in a college for the training of the deaf.  A German writer, commenting upon American literature, declares that the central note in it, the special characteristic of all our great writers, has been idealism—high and lofty idealism.  And he says it is no wonder that Longfellow's poem 'Excelsior' was written by an American, because the excelsior note is the dominant note in American literature.  This college, ladies and gentlemen, is 'Excelsior' wrought into an institution.  It stands for justice, not charity.  This college, and this college alone stands for the principle that a limitation upon one faculty shall not be a limitation upon all faculties, but rather a challenge to all faculties.  It stands for the principle that the men and women who enter here shall see before them the same shining goal that beckons to the men and women who enter other colleges. It stands for the principle that the human mind, if compassed by eternal silence, shall be compassed also by eternal truth."C. Alphonso Smith, from address given on Presentation Day at Gallaudet, May 6, 1914
