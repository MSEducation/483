[[Five-second rule]]

In folklore, the five-second rule states that food dropped on the ground will not be significantly contaminated with bacteria if it is picked up within five seconds of being dropped.  Some may earnestly believe this assertion, whereas other people employ the rule as a polite social fiction that allows them to still eat a lightly contaminated piece of food, despite the potential reservations of their peers.
There can be many variations on the rule where the time limit is modified. In some cases, the person picking up the food arbitrarily extends the time limit based on the actual amount of time required to retrieve the food.

The five-second rule has received some scholarly attentionJulie Deardorff "Capsule: The five-second rule" The Los Angeles Times, August 9, 2010, accessed January 18, 2011. and has been studied as both a public health recommendation and as a sociological effect.
In 2003, intern Jillian Clarke of the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign found in a survey that 56% of men and 70% of women surveyed were familiar with the five-second rule. She also determined that a variety of foods were significantly contaminated by even brief exposure to a tile inoculated with E. coli. On the other hand, Clarke found no significant evidence of contamination on public flooring.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.aces.illinois.edu/news/if-you-drop-it-should-you-eat-it-scientists-weigh-5-second-rule |title=If You Drop It, Should You Eat It?

A more thorough study in 2006 using salmonella on wood, tiles, and nylon carpet found that the bacteria were still thriving after twenty-eight days of exposure under dry conditions. Tested after eight hours' exposure, the bacteria could still contaminate bread and bologna in under five seconds, but a minute-long contact increased contamination about tenfold (with tile and carpet surfaces only).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/dining/09curi.html?ex=1336449600&en=706e4f0cec07d005&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|title=The Five-second Rule Explored, or: How Dirty Is That Bologna?|last=McGee|first=Harold|work=New York Times |date=2007-05-09 |accessdate=2007-05-09[/tpl]
The five-second rule was also featured in an episode of the Discovery Channel series MythBusters. There was no significant difference in the number of bacteria collected from 2 seconds exposure as there was from 6 seconds exposure. The moisture, surface geometry and the location the food item was dropped on did, however, affect the number of bacteria.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kwc.org/mythbusters/2005/10/mythbusters_chinese_invasion_a.html|title=Annotated mythbusters: Episode 39  Chinese Invasion Alarm, 5 Second Rule|accessdate=2008-08-17[/tpl]
Ted Allen put the rule to the test in an episode of Food Detectives,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/food-detectives/the-5-second-rule/index.html|title=Food Detectives, Episode OF0101|accessdate=2011-01-31[/tpl] and found that bacteria will cling to food immediately. High traffic areas will lead to even more bacteria on the food.
