Daniel Hooper (known as Swampy; born 1973) is an environmental activist, sometimes characterised as an environmental protester or eco-warrior, from the United Kingdom. He was active in a variety of environmental protests including that in Fairmile, Devon, against the expansion of the A30 road.

==Biography==

He became a nationally known figure after spending a week in a complex series of tunnels dug in the path of a new extension to the A30 road in Fairmile, Devon, resisting attempts at eviction by police. Several people took part in the protest, but Swampy was the last one evicted. Swampy was originally from Newbury, Berkshire, the site of the protest over the Newbury bypass in 1996.
Swampy's subsequent fame included an appearance on the BBC comedy current affairs quiz Have I Got News for You, on 18 April 1997, when he briefly became the show's youngest ever panelist. In 1997, he took part in another tunnel protest intended to prevent the building of a second runway at Manchester Airport,War in the woods: a history of runway BBC Manchester and has also been involved with the Trident nuclear submarine protest camp at Faslane, Scotland.
In 2006, Swampy was living with his girlfriend and their three children in a yurt, a dome-shaped tent in 'Tipi Valley',Diggers and Dreamers - The Guide to Comunal Living in Britain a remote New Age commune at Cwmdu near Llandeilo in West Wales. In 2007 the Sunday Mirror newspaper reported that he was taking part in the climate change protests at Heathrow Airport.[tpl]cite web |title=Swampy Joins Airport Camp |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sunday-mirror/2007/08/19/swampy-joins-airport-camp-98487-19658350/ |date=19 August 2007 |author=Grant Hodgson |publisher=Sunday Mirror |accessdate=2 July 2009[/tpl] Swampy's presence on the protesters' site was dependent on his keeping a low profile, so his celebrity status would not detract from the protest.The return of Swampy: Underground eco-hero joins the Heathrow protest The Independent, 19 August 2007

Swampy was parodied in a Judge Dredd comic featuring "Spawny" who impeded the construction of a "Spaceport" in the same manner as the real-life eco-warrior. The story ends with the construction continuing unimpeded, with Spawny apparently being sealed alive under the concrete foundation, a reference to a public comment by Conservative minister John Arthur Watts that he would like Swampy to be "buried in concrete".http://www.cbrd.co.uk/people/daniel-hooper/
