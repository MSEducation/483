Radolfzell am Bodensee is a town in Germany at the western end of Lake Constance approximately 18 km northwest of Konstanz. It is the third largest town, after Constance and Singen, in the district of Konstanz, in Baden-Württemberg.
Radolfzell is a well known health care city (Mettnau) and an important railway junction of the Upper Rhine Railway and the Hegau-Ablach Valley Railway (leading to the Bodenseegürtel Railway). In 1990 Radolfzell was named the Federal Environment Capital City of Germany.

==History==

This town developed out of a monastery founded in 826 AD as a "cell" under Bishop Radolf of Verona. The town belonged to the Abbey of Reichenau, then to the house of Habsburg for a long time, and for 40 years was a Free Imperial City. In the center is the gothic Cathedral of our Dear Lady, dating from the 15th century and decorated in the baroque style in the 18th. One particularly beautiful feature is the Rosary altar by the Zürn brothers and the Master of the House's Altar (1750) which contains the relics of the local Radolfzell saints Theopont, Senesius and Zeno. The "Hausherrenfest" is celebrated in their honour every year on the third Sunday in July, and the day after the famous Water Procession is held, as it has been every year, since 1797. The citizens of the nearby village of Moos make a pilgrimage to Radolfzell in picturesquely decorated boats to fulfil an ancient oath. Also, there is the Austrian mansion in the marquet square, built in stages from the 17th to the 19th century, the knightly hall dating from 1626, and various historical patrician houses.
Radolfzell was the birthplace of the cartographer Martin Waldseemüller's mother.
