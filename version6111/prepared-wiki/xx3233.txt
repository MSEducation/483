The European Free Alliance (EFA) is a European political party.
It consists of various national-level political parties in Europe advocating either full political independence (statehood), or some form of devolution or self-governance for their country or region.[tpl]cn|date=May 2012[/tpl] The alliance has generally limited its membership to progressive parties, and therefore, not all European regionalist parties are members of EFA.
The EFA and European Green Party operate together to form The Greens–European Free Alliance political grouping in the European Parliament. The EFA's youth wing is the European Free Alliance Youth (EFAY).

==History==

Since the 1979 European Parliament election regionalists and separatists have been represented in the European Parliament. In that election five regionalist parties got seats: the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) of Northern Ireland, the Scottish National Party (SNP), the Flemish People's Union (VU), the Belgian  Democratic Front of Francophones (FDF) and the South Tyrolean People's Party (SVP). The SNP, although being a predominantly social-democratic party, joined the European Progressive Democrats, which was led by the Gaullist Rally for the Republic, the SDLP the Socialist Group, VU and FDF the heterogeneous Technical Group of Independents, which comprised both conservative and left-wing MEPs, and the SVP the European People's Party group.[tpl]cite web|author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-ep1979.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |publisher=Parties-and-elections.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl]
In 1981 several European regionalist parties joined forces to form a pan-European coalition, called the European Free Alliance – Democratic Party of the Peoples of Europe.[tpl]cite book|author1=Andrew C.

Before, the regionalists had been seated divided, with the SNP with the Gaullist-dominated European Democratic Alliance, VU, the Valdotanian Union and the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) in the Rainbow Group, together with green parties, the South Tyrolean People's Party (SVP) with the European People's Party group, and Batasuna among the Non-Inscrits.[tpl]cite web|author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-ep1984.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |publisher=Parties-and-elections.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl]
In 1989 EFA members formed a group also called Rainbow. It consisted of three Italian MEPs (Lega Nord two, Sardinian Action Party one), two Spanish MEPs (one each for the PNV and the Andalusian Party, PA), one Belgian MEP (for VU), one French MEP (Union of the Corsican People, UPC), one British MEP (SNP) and one independent MEP from Ireland. They were joined by 4 MEPs from the Danish left-wing Eurosceptic People's Movement against the EU, while the other regionalist MEPs, including those of the SDLP, the SVP, Batasuna and the Convergence and Union of Catalonia (CiU) refused to join.[tpl]cite web|author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-ep1989.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |publisher=Parties-and-elections.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl]
In the 1994 European Parliament election the regionalists lost many seats. Moreover, EFA had suspended its major affiliate, Lega Nord, for having joined forces in government with the post-fascist National Alliance. Also, the PNV chose to switch to the European People's Party (EPP). The three remaining EFA MEPs (representing SNP, VU and Canarian Coalition) formed a common group with the French Energie Radicale list and the Italian Pannella List: the European Radical Alliance.[tpl]cite web|author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-ep1994.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |publisher=Parties-and-elections.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl]
Following the 1999 European Parliament election EFA members formed a common European parliamentary group with the European Green Party called The Greens–European Free Alliance. The EFA supplied ten members: two of the Scottish SNP, two of the Welsh Plaid Cymru (PC), two of the Flemish VU, one of the Basque PNV, one of Basque Solidarity (EA), one of the Andalusian PA, and one of the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG).[tpl]cite web|author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-ep1999.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |publisher=Parties-and-elections.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl]
In the 2004 European Parliament election the EFA was reduced to four MEPs two of the SNP (Ian Hudghton and Alyn Smith), one of PC (Jill Evans) and one of the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC; Bernat Joan i Mari, replaced at the mid-term by MEP Mikel Irujo of Basque EA) plus two affiliate members (Tatjana Ždanoka of For Human Rights in United Latvia (PCTVL) and László Tőkés, independent MEP and former member of the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UMDR). The co-operation between EFA and the Greens was continued. In 2004 the EFA formally became a European political party.[tpl]cite web|author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-ep2004.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |publisher=Parties-and-elections.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl]
Following the 2008 revision of the EU Regulation that governs European political parties allowing the creation of European foundations affiliated to Europarties, the EFA established in September 2007 its official foundation/think tank, the Centre Maurits Coppieters (CMC).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ideasforeurope.eu |title=Centre Maurits Coppieters (CMC) - Ideas for Europe |publisher=Ideasforeurope.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl]
In the 2009 European Parliament election the EFA got six MEPs elected: two from the SNP (Ian Hudghton and Alyn Smith), one from the PC (Jill Evans), one from the Party of the Corsican Nation (PNC; François Alfonsi), one from the ERC (Oriol Junqueras) and Tatjana Ždanoka, individual member of the EFA from Latvia. After the election the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) also joined the EFA. The EFA subgroup thus counts 7 MEPs.[tpl]cite web|author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-ep2009.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |publisher=Parties-and-elections.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl]

==Ideology==

In the Brussels Declaration of 2000 the EFA codified its political principles. The EFA stands for "a Europe of Free Peoples based on the principle of subsidiarity, which believe in solidarity with each other and the peoples of the world."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.e-f-a.org/efaactive.php?id=12 |title=European Free Alliance |publisher=E-f-a.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl]
The EFA sees itself as an alliance of stateless peoples, which are striving towards independence, autonomy, recognition or that want a proper voice in Europe. It supports European integration on basis of the subsidiarity-principle. It believes however that Europe should move away from further centralisation. It works towards the formation of a Europe of Regions. It believes that regions should have more power in Europe, for instance participate in the Council of the European Union, when matters within their competence are discussed. It also wants to protect the linguistic and cultural diversity within the European Union.
The EFA stands on the left of the political spectrum, and in the Brussels declaration it emphasises the protection of human rights, sustainable development and social justice. In 2007 the EFA congress in Bilbao added several progressive principles to the declaration: including a commitment to fight against racism, antisemitism, discrimination, xenophobia and islamophobia and a commitment to get full citizenship for migrants, including voting rights.
EFA members are generally progressive, although there are some notable exceptions such as conservative New Flemish Alliance, Bavaria Party and Future of Åland, Christian-democratic ProDG and Slovene Union, centre-right Liga Veneta Repubblica, and far-right[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/editoriali/09_maggio_08/editoriale_alto_adige_ernesto_galli_della_loggia_fb5d76a4-3b8e-11de-a872-00144f02aabc.shtml |title=I separati dell’Alto Adige - Corriere della Sera |publisher=Corriere.it |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ricerca.gelocal.it/altoadige/archivio/altoadige/2010/10/14/AZBPO_AZB03.html |title=Digos e carabinieri nella sede del partito - Alto Adige dal 2004.it » Ricerca |publisher=Ricerca.gelocal.it |date=2010-10-14 |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://altoadige.gelocal.it/cronaca/2011/10/03/news/frattini-denuncia-il-diario-della-klotz-1.4288768 |title=Frattini denuncia il «diario» della Klotz - Cronaca - Alto Adige |publisher=Altoadige.gelocal.it |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2011/10/04/italia/cronache/nel-diario-scolastico-sudtirolesei-terroristi-si-scoprono-eroi-39Rsc1svaFlvWfi53OBIBJ/pagina.html |title=La Stampa - Nel diario scolastico sudtirolesei terroristi si scoprono eroi |publisher=Lastampa.it |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl] South Tyrolean Freedom.

==Organisation==

The main organs of the EFA organisation are the General Assembly, the Bureau and the Secretariat.
In the General Assembly, the supreme council of the EFA, every member party has one vote. Only member parties can participate in the EFA. The EFA also has observers. Before becoming a member party, an organization needs to have been an observer of the EFA for at least one year. Only one member party per region is allowed. If a second party from a region wants to join the EFA, the first party needs to agree, at which point these two parties will then form a common delegation with one vote. The EFA also recognises friends of the EFA, a special status for regionalist parties outside of the European Union.
The Bureau takes care of daily affairs. It is chaired by Eric Defoort (New Flemish Alliance). Marta Rovira (Republican Left of Catalonia) is secretary-general. François Alfonsi (Party of the Corsican Nation). The other members of the Bureau are all vice-presidents: Jill Evans (Plaid Cymru), Gustave Alirol (Occitan Party), Fabrizio Comencini (Liga Veneta Repubblica), Ana Miranda Paz (Galician Nationalist Bloc), Ian Hudghton (Scottish National Party), Sybren Posthumus (Frisian National Party), Sebastian Colio (Basque Solidarity), Dimitrios Ioannou (Rainbow), Rolf Granlund (Future of Åland), Reinhild Campidell (South Tyrolean Freedom) and Lucy Collyer (Majorca Socialist Party).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.e-f-a.org/bureau.php |title=European Free Alliance |publisher=E-f-a.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl]
