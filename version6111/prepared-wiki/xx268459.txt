StAR-related lipid transfer protein 4 (STARD4) is a soluble protein involved in cholesterol transport.  It can transfer up to 7 sterol molecules per minute between artificial membranes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Mesmin B, Pipalia NH, Lund FW, Ramlall TF, Sokolov A, Eliezer D, Maxfield FR | title = STARD4 abundance regulates sterol transport and sensing | journal = Mol Biol Cell | volume = 22| issue = 21| pages = 4004–15| year = 2011 | month = | pmid = 21900492 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.E11-04-0372 | pmc=3204063[/tpl]

==Function==

STARD4 may regulate cholesterol levels in many cells, including in the liver.  STARD4 has specifically been linked to the movement of cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum.  The protein is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rodriguez-Agudo D, Calderon-Dominguez M, Ren S, Marques D, Redford K, Medina-Torres MA, Hylemon P, Gil G, Pandak WM | title = Subcellular localization and regulation of StarD4 protein in macrophages and fibroblasts | journal = Biochim Biophys Acta | volume = 1811| issue = 10 | pages = 597–606 |date=October 2011 | pmid = 21767660 | pmc = 3156897 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2011.06.028 [/tpl]  Increases in the protein relate to cell stress.[tpl]cite journal | author = Yamada S, Yamaguchi T, Hosoda A, Iwawaki T, Kohno K | title = Regulation of human STARD4 gene expression under endoplasmic reticulum stress | journal = Biochem Biophys Res Commun | volume = 343| issue = 4| pages = 1079–85|date=May 2006 | pmid = 16579971 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.03.051[/tpl]
High levels of STARD4 increases the synthesis of bile acids and cholesterol esters in liver hepatocytes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rodriguez-Agudo D, Ren S, Wong E, Marques D, Redford K, Gil G, Hylemon P, Pandak WM | title = Intracellular cholesterol transporter StarD4 binds free cholesterol and increases cholesteryl ester formation | journal = J Lipid Res | volume = 49 | issue = 7| pages = 1409–19 |date=July 2008 | pmid = 18403318| pmc = 2431108 | doi = 10.1194/jlr.M700537-JLR200 [/tpl] Reductions in cholesterol synthesis by cells increase STARD4 levels while StarD4 declines in mice fed a high cholesterol diet.[tpl]cite journal | author = Soccio RE, Adams RM, Maxwell KN, Breslow JL | title = Differential Gene Regulation of StarD4 and StarD5 Cholesterol Transfer Proteins: Activation of StARD4 by sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 and StARD5 by endoplasmic reticulum stress | journal = J Biol Chem | volume = 280| issue = 4| pages = 19410–8|date=March 2005 | pmid = 15760897| doi = 10.1074/jbc.M501778200[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Soccio RE, Adams RM, Romanowski MJ, Sehayek E, Burley SK, Breslow JL | title = The cholesterol-regulated StarD4 gene encodes a StAR-related lipid transfer protein with two closely related homologues, StarD5 and StarD6| journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 99| issue = 10 | pages = 6943–8|date=May 2002 | pmid = 12011452| pmc = 124508| doi = 10.1073/pnas.052143799 [/tpl]
Increases in levels of either master gene regulator SREBP-1a or SREBP2, which both promote the production of proteins involved in cholesterol synthesis, increase StarD4 levels in mouse liver.[tpl]cite journal | author = Horton JD, Shah NA, Warrington JA, Anderson NN, Park SW, Brown MS, Goldstein JL| title = Combined analysis of oligonucleotide microarray data from transgenic and knockout mice identifies direct SREBP target genes| journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 100| issue = 21 | pages = 12027–32|date=October 2003 | pmid = 14512514| pmc = 218707| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1534923100[/tpl]  Conversely, increased STARD4 increases active SREBP2 levels.
Loss of the protein in mice has little effect.[tpl]cite journal | author = Riegelhaupt JJ, Waase MP, Garbarino J, Cruz DE, Breslow JL | title = Targeted disruption of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein D4 leads to modest weight reduction and minor alterations in lipid metabolism | journal = J Lipid Res | volume = 51| issue = 5| pages = 1134–43 |date=May 2010 | pmid = 19965609 | pmc = 2853440| doi = 10.1194/jlr.M003095[/tpl]  Mice without functional STARD4 weigh less and females tend to have lower cholesterol profiles.  The most dramatic change observed to date is a reduction in NPC-1, a protein involved in bringing cholesterol into cells.

==Structure==

The protein is 205 amino acids long in the human (224 in the mouse) and almost entirely consists of a StAR-related transfer (START) domain.  It also lends its name to the subgroup of START domain proteins it is part of, StarD4.  This subfamily includes STARD5 and STARD6 and is closely related to the StarD1/D3 group.
