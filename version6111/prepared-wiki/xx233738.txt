Richard Burke, 8th Earl of Clanricarde, Irish peer, died after 1708.
Richard appears to have been the first of the family to conform, as Charles II wrote to his father congratulating him on "being throughly instructed in the protestant religion as it stands established, having forsaken that of Rome which hath always given jealousies to the crown." He was made Baron Dunkellin in 1680. His brother, Ulick, commanded a regiment of foot at the Battle of Aughrim where he was killed, aged twenty-two. 
Clanricarde commanded a regiment of infantry during the Williamite War in Ireland and surrendered the town of Galway in July 1690. 
His daughter, Lady Dorothy Bourke, married Alexander Pendarves.
