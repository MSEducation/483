[[ACT (audio format)]]

CATEGORIES: Audio codecs

ACT is a lossy ADPCM 8 kbit/s compressed audio format recorded by most Chinese MP3 and MP4 players with a recording function, and voice recorders. 
However, many models of recorder that use the ACT format do so only for their lowest-quality recording setting; if the quality setting is increased then a different format such as WAV is used instead (albeit at the expense of using up recorder memory more quickly).
There are different versions of ACT; files produced by later devices cannot [tpl]As of|2009|June|lc=on[/tpl] be read by any free standard audio player and converter software, only by the supplied MP3 utilities.

==Decoding .act files==

===Using Windows===

Devices which record in this format are usually supplied with an ACT to WAV converter program that runs under Microsoft Windows; the converter usually used can be downloaded as part of MP3 Player Utilities.
Konvertor (http://www.logipole.com/indexe.html) can play and convert the format too.
Act files can be converted by numerous programs.

===Using Linux===

One command-line utility that is able to read .act files is SoX. A command line that converts an .act file to another file format is the following:
 
 sox -i -r8k -tima -c1 infile.act outfile
