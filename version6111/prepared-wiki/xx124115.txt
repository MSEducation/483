Jimmy Connors defeated Ken Rosewall 6–1, 6–1, 6–4 in the final to win the Gentlemen's Singles title at the 1974 Wimbledon Championships. Uniquely, due to the WCT ban in place at the 1972 Championship and the ATP boycott of 1973; three undefeated champions competed in the men's singles event. John Newcombe, the 1971 champion, Stan Smith (1972) and defending champion Jan Kodeš were all unbeaten from their last singles matches at the championships when this year's event commenced.
