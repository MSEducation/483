[[Jaxon modulation]]

CATEGORIES: Line codes

Jaxon modulation is a modulation system for placing information on a bitstream generated by a finite generator.
A bitstream of random nature can most probably not have any extra information modulated onto it. While a bitstream with zero entropy can have any amount of information modulated onto it. But such a stream which holds the modulated information can not be made by a finite generator. In between these two grounds of maximal entropy and minimal entropy perhaps a finite generator exists for a stream having a ratio of 4 to 1 in the bit states.
The bounds for the stream entropy is more than two to one of one bit state to the other for the bit statistics. A three to one bit state bias would allow modulation of information onto the stream at 3/16ths of the stream's bit rate.
3/4*((N-2)/(N+1)) = rate of modulation factor for N to 1 bit state biased carrier stream.
