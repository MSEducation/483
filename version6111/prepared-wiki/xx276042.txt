Mexico has had a free trade agreement with the European Union (EU) since 2000 and the two benefit from high investment flows.

==Agreements==

In 1997, Mexico was the first country in Latin America to sign a partnership agreement with the EU. The "EU-Mexico Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement" entered into force in 2000 and established a free trade area (FTA) between the two parties (see trade section below). It also establishes regular high-level contact between the EU and Mexico and acted as a catalyst for increased investment flows.Mexico (United Mexican States), European External Action Service
