The DVD Copy Control Association (DVD CCA) is an organization primarily responsible for the copy protection of DVDs. The Content Scramble System (CSS) was devised for this purpose to make copyright infringement difficult, but also presents obstacles to some legitimate uses of the media. The association is also responsible for the controversial Regional Playback Control (RPC), the region encoding scheme which gives movie studios geographic control over DVD distribution.
As of 2001, members included film distributors such as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros.[tpl]cite web | title=Federal Register: August 3, 2001 (Volume 66, Number 150) | url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&docid=01-19392-filed | accessdate=December 19, 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=2001 copyright reform: CMPDA reply | url=http://www.flora.ca/copyright-2001-cmpda-reply.shtml | accessdate=December 19, 2007 [/tpl]
They filed the much publicized case versus Jon Johansen whom they alleged wrote DeCSS.  The case was dropped in January 2004.  CSS decrypting software (such as DVD Decrypter, AnyDVD, and DVD Shrink) allows a region-specific DVD to be copied as an all-region DVD. It also removes Macrovision, Content Scrambling System (CSS), region codes, and user operation prohibitions.  Additionally, they also filed a suit DVD CCA v. Bunner against people who distributed DeCSS, seeking injunction to stop further distribution based on trade secret claims. The injunction was eventually denied because CSS was no longer a secret by the time litigation occurred.

==Features restricted by manufacturers==

All hardware manufacturers (especially DVD player/burner manufacturers) implement DVD CCA-mandated enforcement features on their products; some even go beyond that and implement additional features to restrict ripping, for example:
