==History==

The first Rose school began operations in 1997 through the financial support of founder Nedra Roney. Since that time, Ms. Roney has given the foundation a grant that provides for the entire current operating budget of the foundation. This grant allows 100% of donor contributions to be used exclusively for educating the students. In the beginning, there was one small school in Patzicia. In 1997, that school served approximately 50 children. Two other schools have since been organized, one in Chimaltenango and the other in Momostenango.  In addition to these schools, the Rose Foundation supports several other schools with training, administrative, and volunteer support. These schools have a combined enrollment of over 1,500 students. In November 1999, the foundation received recognition from the IRS as a 501(c)(3) public non-profit organization.
The Rose Education Foundation offices in Guatemala are located in Chimaltenango.  Offices in the US are located in Provo, Utah.
