[[Lumia (art)]]

CATEGORIES: Art genres

Lumia is the term coined by 20th Century Artist Thomas Wilfred to refer to art created from light.
Lumia as conceived, was a self-contained and silent art, not to be combined with music or dance. Wilfred, being a pragmatist, would occasionally experiment or collaborate with other artists and disciplines (most notably for a performance with Maestro Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Symphony at Carnegie Hall).
Though Wilfred intended the term to refer to any art created using light, its use was never widely adopted. Contemporary use of the term by artists are mostly artists themselves creating works utilizing Wilfred's visual vocabulary.
Lumia is distinguished mostly by its amorphous spindly moving forms.
