Nevada Bell Telephone Company, originally Bell Telephone Company of Nevada, was the Bell System's telephone provider in Nevada. It only provides telephone services to 30% of the state, not including Las Vegas, where service is provided by CenturyLink. Nevada Bell is a subsidiary of Pacific Bell, which is the reason Nevada Bell was not listed in Judge Harold Greene's Modification of Final Judgment, stating the breakup of AT&T. After the 1984 breakup, its legal name was shortened to Nevada Bell and it became a holding of Pacific Telesis.

==Mergers==

In 1997, Pacific Telesis Group was acquired by SBC Communications, and although the Pacific Telesis corporate name disappeared fairly quickly, SBC continued to operate the local telephone companies separately under their original names.
In September 2001, SBC rebranded the telephone company "SBC Nevada Bell".  In late 2002, the company was rebranded again as simply "SBC".  Meanwhile, employees of SBC working in Nevada who support SBC's non-regulated services and/or services provided both within and outside Nevada were transferred to other SBC subsidiaries, like "Pacific Telesis Shared Services" and "SBC Operations, Inc."  However, for legal and regulatory purposes, employees supporting local regulated services were still employed by "Nevada Bell dba SBC Nevada", which was the SBC subsidiary that provides regulated local telephone services within the franchise territory in Nevada.
On November 18, 2005, SBC completed its acquisition of AT&T Corp. to form AT&T Inc., at which point Nevada Bell began doing business as AT&T Nevada.
