==History==

Maha Sarakham was originally a satellite town of Roi Et founded in 1865. The governor of Roi Et sent 9,000 people to populate the new town, and one of his cousins as its governor. In 1868 the central government in Bangkok declared Maha Sarakham a province of its own under the supervision of Bangkok; one of the reasons was that this step weakened the power of Roi Et.

The provincial seal shows a big tree in front of big rice fields, symbolizing the richness of resources in the province.
The province's flag shows the seal in the middle, in a brown horizontal strip. Above and below is a yellow strip. The brown color symbolizes the strength and the perseverance of the people in the province, who live in the rather dry climate; the yellow color as the color of the robes of Buddhist monks symbolizes the faith of the people.
