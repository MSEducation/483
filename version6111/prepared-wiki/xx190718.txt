The Maitland Mercury is Australia's third oldest regional newspaper, preceded only by the Geelong Advertiser (estab. 1840) and the Launceston Examiner (estab. 1842).
The Maitland Mercury was established in 1843 when it was called The Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser. The Maitland Mercury is still in circulation serving the city of Maitland and the surrounding Lower Hunter Valley.

==History==

It was originally a weekly newspaper, with the first issue published on 7 January 1843.[tpl]cite web|title=Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser|url=http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/record=b1155242~S2|work=Catalogue record|publisher=State Library of New South Wales|accessdate=25 October 2013[/tpl] It has been a daily since 1894.[tpl]Citation | author1=Kirkpatrick, Rod | title=Country conscience : a history of the New South Wales provincial press, 1841-1995 | publication-date=2000 | publisher=Infinite Harvest Publishing | isbn=978-0-646-40270-3 [/tpl] when it was issued under two banners as The Maitland Daily Mercury[tpl]cite web|title=The Maitland Daily Mercury|url=http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/record=b1762523~S2|work=Catalogue record|publisher=State Library of NSW|accessdate=6 November 2013[/tpl]  during the week and The Maitland Weekly Mercury[tpl]cite web|title=The Maitland Weekly Mercury|url=http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/record=b1762525~S2|work=Catalogue record|publisher=State Library of NSW|accessdate=7 November 2013[/tpl]  on Saturdays. In 1939 the weekly edition was absorbed into the daily and it became known as The Maitland Mercury.[tpl]cite web|title=The Maitland Mercury|url=http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/record=b1766461~S2|work=Catalogue record|publisher=State Library of NSW|accessdate=7 November 2013[/tpl] It was issued simply as The Mercury from  1960 to 1973[tpl]cite web|title=The Mercury|url=http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/record=b1762532~S2|work=Catalogue record|publisher=State Library of NSW|accessdate=7 November 2013[/tpl]  when it reverted again to The Maitland Mercury[tpl]cite web|title=The Maitland Mercury|url=http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/record=b1161867~S2|work=Catalogue record|publisher=State Library of NSW|accessdate=7 November 2013[/tpl] 
Even when it was first published The Mercury was more than just a local newspaper reporting on local issues. It published national and international news, which was critical to the financial survival of the newspaper at the time, and it continues to do so.
