The cubit is an archaic unit of length based on the length of the forearm from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. Cubits of various lengths were employed in many parts of the world in antiquity, during the Middle Ages and as recently as Early Modern Times. The term is still used in hedge laying, the length of the forearm being frequently used to determine the interval between stakes placed within the hedge.http://www.shropshirehedgelaying.co.uk/hedgelaying_article_3.php
Other units of measure based on the length of the forearm include some kinds of ell, the Indian Hasta, Khmer hat and Thai sok.

==Etymology==

The English word "cubit" comes from the Latin noun cubitum "elbow", from the verb cubo, cubare, cubui, cubitum "to lie down",Cassell's Latin Dictionary from which also comes the adjective "recumbent".Oxford English Dictionary, Second edition, 1989; online version September 2011. s.v. "cubit"

==The Egyptian royal cubit==

The earliest attested standard measure is from the Ancient Egypt and was called the royal cubit (meh niswt). Early evidence for the use of the royal cubit comes from the early dynastic period: on the Palermo stone, the flood level of the Nile river during the reign of the Pharaoh Djer is given as measuring 6 cubits and 1 palm. Use of the royal cubit is also known from Old Kingdom architecture, from at least as early as the construction of the Step Pyramid of Djoser in around 2,700 B.C.
In Ancient Egypt, cubit rods were used for the measurement of length. A number of these have survived: two are known from the tomb of Maya, the treasurer of Tutankhamun, in Saqqara; another was found in the tomb of Kha (TT8) in Thebes. Fourteen such rods, including one double cubit rod, were described and compared by Lepsius in 1865.  These cubits range from [tpl]convert|523|to|529|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, and are divided into seven palms; each palm is divided into four fingers and the fingers are further subdivided.

==The Sumerian or Nippur cubit==

In 1916, during the last years of Ottoman Empire and in the middle of WWI, the German assyriologist Eckhard Unger found a copper-alloy bar while excavating at Nippur. The bar dates from c. 2650 BCE and Unger claimed it was used as a measurement standard. This irregularly formed and irregularly marked graduated rule supposedly defined the Sumerian cubit as about [tpl]convert|518.6|mm|in|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl].

==Near Eastern or Biblical cubit==

In biblical exegesis, the Near Eastern or Biblical cubit is usually estimated as approximately [tpl]convert|450|mm|in|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl].

==Ancient Rome==

In ancient Rome, according to Vitruvius, a cubit was made up of six palms and was thus equal to one and a half Roman feet or pedes.H. Arthur Klein (1974). The Science of Measurement: A Historical Survey. New York: Dover. ISBN 9780486258393. p. 68.

==Other systems==

Other measurements based on the length of the forearm are the Indian Hasta and Thai sok. A traditional measure in South India commonly used by flower sellers is the mola , mulam  which is equal to a cubit.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

==Cubit arm in heraldry==
