[[Linear congruence theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Modular arithmetic, Theorems in number theory

In modular arithmetic, the question of when a linear congruence can be solved is answered by the linear  congruence theorem. If a and b are any integers  and n is a positive integer, then the congruence
has a solution for x if and only if b is divisible by the  greatest common divisor d of a and n (denoted by gcd(a,n)). When this is the case, and x0 is one solution of (1), then the set of all solutions is given by
In particular, there will be exactly d = gcd(a,n) solutions in the set of residues {0,1,2,...,n − 1}.  The result is a simple consequence of Bézout's identity.

==Example==

For example, examining the equation ax ≡ 2 (mod 6)  with different values of a yields
Here d = gcd(3,6) = 3 but since 3 does not divide 2, there is no  solution. 
Here d = gcd(5,6) = 1, which divides any b, and so there is just one solution in {0,1,2,3,4,5}: x = 4.
Here d = gcd(4,6) = 2, which does divide 2, and so there are exactly two solutions in {0,1,2,3,4,5}: x = 2 and x = 5.

==Solving a linear congruence==

In general solving equations of the form:
If the greatest common divisor d = gcd(a, n) divides b, then we can find a solution x to the congruence as follows:  the extended Euclidean algorithm yields integers r and s such ra + sn = d. Then x = rb/d is a solution. The other solutions are the numbers congruent to x modulo n/d.
For example, the congruence
has 4 solutions since gcd(12, 28) = 4 divides 20. The extended  Euclidean algorithm gives (−2)·12 + 1·28 = 4, i.e. r = −2 and  s = 1. Therefore, one solution is x = −2·20/4 = −10, and −10 = 4 modulo 7. All other solutions will also be congruent to 4 modulo 7. Since the original equation uses modulo 28, the entire solution set in the range from 0 to 27 is {4, 11, 18, 25}.

==System of linear congruences==

By repeatedly using the linear congruence theorem, one can also solve systems of linear congruences, as in the following example: find all numbers x such that 
which describes all solutions to the system.
