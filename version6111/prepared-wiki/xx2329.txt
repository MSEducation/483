[[Carmichael number]]

CATEGORIES: Integer sequences, Modular arithmetic, Pseudoprimes

==Overview==

Fermat's little theorem states that that if p is a prime number, then for any integer b, the number b p − b is an integer multiple of p.
Carmichael numbers are composite numbers which have the same property of modular arithmetic congruence.  In fact, Carmichael numbers are also called Fermat pseudoprimes or absolute Fermat pseudoprimes.
Carmichael numbers are important because they pass the Fermat primality test but are not actually prime. Since Carmichael numbers exist, this primality test cannot be relied upon to prove the primality of a number, although it can still be used to prove a number is composite. This makes tests based on Fermat's Little Theorem risky compared to other more stringent tests such as the Solovay-Strassen primality test or a strong pseudoprime test.
Still, as numbers become larger, Carmichael numbers become very rare. For example, there are 20,138,200 Carmichael numbers between 1 and 1021 (approximately one in 50 trillion (50e12) numbers).Richard Pinch, "The Carmichael numbers up to 1021", May 2007.

===Korselt's criterion===

An alternative and equivalent definition of Carmichael numbers is given by Korselt's criterion.

==Discovery==

Korselt was the first who observed the basic properties of Carmichael numbers, but he could not find any examples. In 1910, Carmichael[tpl]cite journal |author=R. D. Carmichael|title=Note on a new number theory function |journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |volume=16 |issue=5|year=1910 |pages=232–238 |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1910-16-05/home.html |doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1910-01892-9[/tpl] found the first and smallest such number, 561, which explains the name "Carmichael number".
The next six Carmichael numbers are [tpl]OEIS|id=A002997[/tpl]:
These first seven Carmichael numbers, from 561 to 8911, were all found by the Czech mathematician Václav Šimerka in 1885[tpl]cite journal |author=V. Šimerka|title=Zbytky z arithmetické posloupnosti (On the remainders of an arithmetic progression) |journal=Časopis pro pěstování matematiky a fysiky |volume=14 |issue=5|year=1885 |pages=221–225 |url=http://dml.cz/handle/10338.dmlcz/122245[/tpl] (thus preceding not just Carmichael but also Korselt, although Šimerka did not find anything like Korselt's criterion). His work, however, remained unnoticed.
Löh and Niebuhr in 1992 found some very large Carmichael numbers, including one with 1,101,518 factors and over 16 million digits.

===Factorizations===

The first Carmichael numbers with 4 prime factors are [tpl]OEIS|id=A074379[/tpl]:
The second Carmichael number (1105) can be expressed as the sum of two squares in more ways than any smaller number. The third Carmichael number (1729) is the Hardy-Ramanujan Number: the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.

===Distribution===

In 1953, Knödel proved the upper bound:
In 1956, Erdős improved the bound to[tpl]cite journal |author=Erdős, P. |year=1956 |title=On pseudoprimes and Carmichael numbers |journal=Publ. Math. Debrecen |volume=4 |pages=201–206 |url=http://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1956-10.pdf |mr=79031 [/tpl]

In the other direction, Alford, Granville and Pomerance proved in 1994 that for sufficiently large X,
In 2005, this bound was further improved by Harman[tpl]cite journal |author=Glyn Harman |title=On the number of Carmichael numbers up to x |journal=Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society |volume=37 |year=2005 |pages=641–650 |doi=10.1112/S0024609305004686[/tpl] to
Carmichael numbers up to X. However, inside current computational ranges (such as the counts of Carmichael numbers performed by Pinch up to 1021), these conjectures are not yet borne out by the data.

==Generalizations==

Both prime and Carmichael numbers satisfy the following equality:

==Higher-order Carmichael numbers==

Carmichael numbers can be generalized using concepts of abstract algebra.
The above definition states that a composite integer n is Carmichael
precisely when the nth-power-raising function pn from the ring Zn of integers modulo n to itself is the identity function. The identity is the only Zn-algebra endomorphism on Zn so we can restate the definition as asking that pn be an algebra endomorphism of Zn.
As above, pn satisfies the same property whenever n is prime.
The nth-power-raising function pn is also defined on any Zn-algebra A. A theorem states that n is prime if and only if all such functions pn are algebra endomorphisms.
In-between these two conditions lies the definition of Carmichael number of order m for any positive integer m as any composite number n such that pn is an endomorphism on every Zn-algebra that can be generated as Zn-module by m elements. Carmichael numbers of order 1 are just the ordinary Carmichael numbers.

===Properties===

Korselt's criterion can be generalized to higher-order Carmichael numbers, as shown by Howe.Everett W. Howe. "Higher-order Carmichael numbers." Mathematics of Computation 69 (2000), pp. 1711–1719.
A heuristic argument, given in the same paper, appears to suggest that there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers of order m, for any m. However, not a single Carmichael number of order 3 or above is known.
