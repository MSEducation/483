The Wiese is a river in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, and Basel-City, Switzerland, a right tributary of the Rhine. It rises in the Black Forest, on the Feldberg. The Wiese flows through Todtnau, Schönau im Schwarzwald, Schopfheim and Lörrach. After crossing the border with Switzerland, the Wiese flows through the quarters of Basel on the right side of the Rhine, and joins the Rhine opposite the French town Saint-Louis. Its length is 55 km.
The largest tributary is the Little Wiese ([tpl]lang-de|Kleine Wiese[/tpl], which is fed from the two headwaters the Köhlgartenwiese and the Belchen Wiesemeadow, which unite in Tegernau and form the Little Wiese.  From Tegernau, the Little Wiese flows south and joins the Wiese west of Schopfheim.

==Name==

Etymologically, the name Wiese is probably derived from the Old European root word virs or is- for water, or water,Krahe, Hans: Theorie über die älteste Gewässernamengebung, see also Vennemann (1994), Steinbauer (1996). and has nothing to do with the German word [tpl]lang|de|Wiese[/tpl], which means "meadow".[tpl]cn|date=February 2014|water and water meadow are close associates[/tpl]

==Course of the river==

The Wiese rises on Mount Feldberg and flows as a mountain stream through a narrow valley with steep slopes in the Black Forest, past the towns of Fahl, Brandberg and Todtnau.  After Todtnau, it flows past Geschwend and through the towns of Utzenfeld, Schönau im Schwarzwald, Wembach Fröhnd, and then past the villages of Mambach, Atzenbach and Zell im Wiesental.
Between Zell im Wiesental and Hausen im Wiesental, the narrow valley opens up and the Wiese valley becomes a wide open plain.  The river flows past the towns and villages of Fahrnau, Schopfheim, Gündenhausen, Maulburg, Höllstein, Steinen and past the districts Hauingen, Brombach, Haagen, Tumringen, the city center, Tüllingen and Stetten of the city of Lörrach.
After the railway bridge in Stetten, the river leaves Germany and flows its last six kilometers across Swiss territory.  It flows through the municipality of Riehen and into Basel, where it flows into the Rhine.  The German municipality of Weil am Rhein is not directly adjacent to the Wiese, however, it has access to the river via the hamlet of Mühleteich.
The towns and municipalities along the Wiese all belong to the Landkreis of Lörrach, except Riehen and Basel, which are in the half-canton of Basel-Stadt.
