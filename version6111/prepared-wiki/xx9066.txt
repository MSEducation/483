===Friendship with Tori Amos===

One of Gaiman's most commented-upon friendships is with the musician Tori Amos, a Sandman fan who became friends with Gaiman after making a reference to "Neil and the Dream King" on her 1991 demo tape. He included her in turn as a character (a talking tree) in his novel Stardust.Tori Amos, "Tear in Your Hand," Little Earthquakes Amos also mentions Gaiman in her songs, "Tear in Your Hand" ("If you need me, me and Neil'll be hangin' out with the dream king. Neil says hi by the way"),[tpl]cite web|url=http://everythingtori.com/go/galleries/view/312/2/31/albums |title=Tear in Your Hand |publisher=Everything Tori |date= |accessdate=2 August 2010[/tpl] "Space Dog" ("Where's Neil when you need him?"),[tpl]cite web|url=http://everythingtori.com/go/galleries/view/378/3/28/albums |title=Space Dog |publisher=Everything Tori |date= |accessdate=2 August 2010[/tpl] "Horses" ("But will you find me if Neil makes me a tree?"),[tpl]cite web|url=http://everythingtori.com/go/galleries/view/234/1/26/albums |title=Beauty Queen/ Horses |publisher=Everything Tori |date= |accessdate=2 August 2010[/tpl] "Carbon" ("Get me Neil on the line, no I can't hold.

He also wrote stories for the tour book of Boys for Pele and Scarlet's Walk, a letter for the tour book of American Doll Posse, and the stories behind each girl in her album Strange Little Girls. Amos penned the introduction for his novel Death: the High Cost of Living, and posed for the cover. She also wrote a song called "Sister Named Desire" based on his Sandman character, which was included on his anthology, Where's Neil When You Need Him?.

==Litigation==

In 1993, Gaiman was contracted by Todd McFarlane to write a single issue of Spawn, a popular title at the newly created Image Comics company. McFarlane was promoting his new title by having guest authors Gaiman, Alan Moore, Frank Miller, and Dave Sim each write a single issue.
In issue No. 9 of the series, Gaiman introduced the characters Angela, Cogliostro, and Medieval Spawn. Prior to this issue, Spawn was an assassin who worked for the government and came back as a reluctant agent of Hell but had no direction. In Angela, a cruel and malicious angel, Gaiman introduced a character who threatened Spawn's existence, as well as providing a moral opposite. Cogliostro was introduced as a mentor character for exposition and instruction, providing guidance. Medieval Spawn introduced a history and precedent that not all Spawns were self-serving or evil, giving additional character development to Malebolgia, the demon that creates Hellspawn.
As intended,See Judge Shabaz's ruling for the legal reasoning: "As a co-owner, McFarlane was not violating the Copyright Act by unilaterally publishing the jointly owned work, but, as in any other case of conversion or misappropriation, he would have to account to the other joint owner for the latter's share of the profits." all three characters were used repeatedly throughout the next decade by Todd McFarlane within the wider Spawn universe. In papers filed by  Gaiman in early 2002, however, he claimed that the characters were jointly owned by their scripter (himself) and artist (McFarlane), not merely by McFarlane in his role as the creator of the series.Listen to the "Oral Argument," List of Documents in case: 03-1331 : Gaiman, Neil v. McFarlane, Todd. Retrieved 22 September 2008.See also the official decision by Judge John Shabaz in The United States Court of Appeals For the Seventh Circuit Nos. 03–1331, 03–1461. Retrieved 22 September 2008. Disagreement over who owned the rights to a character was the primary motivation for McFarlane and other artists to form Image Comics (although that argument related more towards disagreements between writers and artists as character creators).See Khoury, George, Image Comics: The Road To Independence (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2007), ISBN 1-893905-71-3 As McFarlane used the characters without Gaiman's permission or royalty payments, Gaiman believed his copyrighted work was being infringed upon, which violated their original, oral, agreement. McFarlane initially agreed that Gaiman had not signed away any rights to the characters, and negotiated with Gaiman to effectively 'swap' McFarlane's interest in the character MarvelmanSee Judge Shabaz's ruling: "A tentative agreement was reached that... Gaiman would exchange his rights in Medieval Spawn and Cogliostro for McFarlane's rights in another comic book character, Miracleman." (McFarlane believes he purchased interest in the character when Eclipse Comics was liquidated; Gaiman is interested in being able to continue his aborted run on that title) but later claimed that Gaiman's work had been work-for-hire and that McFarlane owned all of Gaiman's creations entirely. The presiding judge, however, ruled against their agreement being work for hire, based in large part on the legal requirement that "copyright assignments must be in writing."Judge Shabaz, Official ruling, as per "Schiller & Schmidt, Inc. v. Nordisco Corp., 969 F.2d 410, 413 (7th Cir. 1992)"
The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court ruling in February 2004[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=1513 |title=Gaiman in Stunning Victory over McFarlane in Spawn Case: Jury Finds for Gaiman on All Counts |first=Beau |last=Yarbrough |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=3 October 2002 |accessdate=22 September 2008 [/tpl] granting joint ownership of the characters to Gaiman and McFarlane. On the specific issue of Cogliostro, presiding Judge John C. Shabaz proclaimed "The expressive work that is the comic-book character Count Nicholas Cogliostro was the joint work of Gaiman and McFarlane—their contributions strike us as quite equal—and both are entitled to ownership of the copyright".See Judge Shabaz's ruling for similar statements on Angela and Medieval Spawn. Similar analysis led to similar results for the other two characters, Angela and Medieval Spawn.
This legal battle was brought by Gaiman and the specifically formed Marvels and Miracles, LLC, which Gaiman created to help sort out the legal rights surrounding Marvelman. Gaiman wrote Marvel 1602 in 2003 to help fund this project.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=2308 |title=Marvel's "1602" Press Conference |first=Jonah |last=Weiland |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=27 June 2003 |accessdate=22 September 2008 [/tpl] All of Marvel Comics' profits for the original issues of the series went to Marvels and Miracles.

==Literary allusions==

Gaiman's work is known for a high degree of allusiveness.See particularly Rodney Sharkey, James Fleming, and Zuleyha Cetiner-Oktem's articles in ImageTexT special issue on Gaiman's work: http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_1/#Articles. Meredith Collins, for instance, has commented upon the degree to which his novel Stardust depends on allusions to Victorian fairy tales and culture.Collins, Meredith. "Fairy and Faerie: Uses of the Victorian in Neil Gaiman's and Charles Vess's Stardust." ImageTexT 4.1. http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_1/collins/ Particularly in The Sandman, literary figures and characters appear often; the character of Fiddler's Green is modelled visually on G. K. Chesterton, both William Shakespeare and Geoffrey Chaucer appear as characters, as do several characters from within A Midsummer Night's DreamSee this detailed analysis: http://www.satt.org/comic/02_10_faery_1.html. and The Tempest. The comic also draws from numerous mythologies and historical periods.
Clay Smith has argued that this sort of allusiveness serves to situate Gaiman as a strong authorial presence in his own works, often to the exclusion of his collaborators.Smith, Clay. "Get Gaiman?: PolyMorpheus Perversity in Works by and about Neil Gaiman." ImageTexT 4.1. http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_1/smith/ However, Smith's viewpoint is in the minority: to many, if there is a problem with Gaiman scholarship and intertextuality it is that "... his literary merit and vast popularity have propelled him into the nascent comics canon so quickly that there is not yet a basis of critical scholarship about his work."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_1/introduction.shtml |title=A Special Issue on the Works of Neil Gaiman, Introduction |publisher=English.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl]
David Rudd takes a more generous view in his study of the novel Coraline, where he argues that the work plays and riffs productively on Sigmund Freud's notion of the Uncanny, or the Unheimlich.Rudd, David "An Eye for an 'I': Neil Gaiman's Coraline and the Question of Identity" Children's Literature and Education 39(3), 2008, pp. 159–168 http://digitalcommons.bolton.ac.uk/emcs_journals/1/
Though Gaiman's work is frequently seen as exemplifying the monomyth structure laid out in Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces,See Stephen Rauch, Neil Gaiman's The Sandman and Joseph Campbell: In Search of the Modern Myth, Wildside Press, 2003 Gaiman says that he started reading The Hero with a Thousand Faces but refused to finish it: "I think I got about half way through The Hero with a Thousand Faces and found myself thinking if this is true – I don’t want to know. I really would rather not know this stuff. I’d rather do it because it’s true and because I accidentally wind up creating something that falls into this pattern than be told what the pattern is."[tpl]cite web|last=Ogline |first=Tim E. |url=http://www.wildriverreview.com/worldvoices-neilgaiman.php |title=The Wild River Review, "Interview with the Dream King" |publisher=Wildriverreview.com |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl]
