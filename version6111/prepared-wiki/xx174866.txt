==Series development==

Crystal Asher, a second-year student at the school, approached Red Apple Entertainment president Rachel Low with the idea. Early in the program's development, the idea of a formal competition was ruled out, as the creators expected there would already be sufficient dramatic elements. For the first season, the producers chose 12 of 36 enrolees in the school to follow. 1,000 hours of footage were edited down to the 13 half-hour episodes of the series' first season.[tpl]Cite news| last =Taylor| first =Kate| title =Cooking up controversy| page =R1| publisher =The Globe and Mail| date =2008-01-28| url =http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080128.wchef28/BNStory/Entertainment/home| accessdate =2008-01-30 [/tpl] Of the twelve students, only nine returned for the second season. One student, Danielle, did not graduate.

==Reception==

At the time of the series debut, John Doyle of The Globe and Mail wrote, "It's a charming series, much less noisy and more astute than some of the higher-profile cooking-school shows."[tpl]Cite news| last =Doyle| first =John| title =Attention, people in Canadian TV: Call off your aunties| page =R3| publisher =The Globe and Mail| date =2008-01-01[/tpl]
