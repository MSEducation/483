Antonio Rivera Rodríguez Airport [tpl]airport codes|VQS|TJVQ|VQS[/tpl] is a small public use airport on the island of Vieques in Puerto Rico. Because a large amount of Vieques' yearly revenue comes from the tourism industry, this small airport plays an important part in Vieques' economic outlook. The airport has been for decades the hub of Vieques Air Link, and also a landing facility for a number of small airlines.
As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 21,517 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/passenger_allcargo_stats/passenger/media/cy08_all_enplanements.pdf | title = Enplanements for CY 2008 | format = PDF, 1.0 MB | work = CY 2008 Passenger Boarding and All-Cargo Data | publisher = Federal Aviation Administration | date = December 18, 2009[/tpl] 20,759 enplanements in 2009, and 46,267 in 2010.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/passenger_allcargo_stats/passenger/media/cy10_all_enplanements.pdf | title = Enplanements for CY 2010 | format = PDF, 189 KB | work = CY 2010 Passenger Boarding and All-Cargo Data | publisher = Federal Aviation Administration | date = October 4, 2011[/tpl] It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a primary commercial service airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year).[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/npias/reports/media/2011/npias_2011_appA.pdf | title = 2011–2015 NPIAS Report, Appendix A | format = PDF, 2.03 MB | work = National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems | publisher = Federal Aviation Administration | date = October 4, 2010[/tpl]

==History==

When anti-military demonstrators started flocking into Vieques, both by air and sea, in 1999, Vieques Airport saw a considerable increase to its normal yearly average of passengers. In addition, many celebrities who travelled from all over Puerto Rico and the rest of Latin America to join the protesters arrived at Vieques through this airport. When Carla Tricoli, a Vieques native, won the 2002 Miss Puerto Rico contest, her first flight as a beauty queen landed at Vieques Airport.
The airport does not accept jet aircraft, but a couple of international flights operate from it. Most of the commercial aviation operations are concentrated on domestic flights such as Vieques to Ceiba, Vieques to Isla Grande Airport and Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, both in San Juan. Air ambulance flights to Fajardo are also available.
Early in 2005, plans were announced to expand the airport's lone runway, so that the airport can accept flights by smaller jets. This would be done in preparation for American Eagle to start operations to the airport. The airline was expected to start flights to Vieques from San Juan's Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in early 2010, but the airline decided not to begin service.
