Raichu, known as the Electric Mouse Pokémon, and both Pikachu and Raichu most likely to be based on the Pika Mouse. Raichu is a taller form that Pikachu takes when a Thunder Stone is applied. Raichu is a rather small bipedal rodent. It is able to run faster on all fours. Like Pikachu, from which it evolves, Raichu has long ears and feet, and stubby arms; both species also have two horizontal brown stripes on its back. Its long, thin tail has a broad, lightning bolt-shaped end, which is smaller and blunted on females. Raichu is orange in color, with a white belly. Its paws are brown, as well as its toes, while the soles of its feet are tan colored. Its bifurcated ears are brown on the outsides and yellow on the insides, and end in a distinctive curl at their bottom-most point. Unlike Pikachu, with its distinctive red circles, the cheek sacs of Raichu are yellow.
Although quite small in comparison to many other Pokémon, Raichu is capable of storing over 100,000 volts of electricity in its body.[tpl]pokédex|firered|Its electric charges can reach even 100,000 volts. Careless contact can cause even an Indian elephant to faint.[/tpl] Raichu, and its evolution family, Pichu and Pikachu, are the only known Pokémon that can learn Volt Tackle. Raichu is much more aggressive than Pikachu, especially if it has stored too much electricity in its body.[tpl]pokédex|yellow|When electricity builds up inside its body, it becomes FKCriminal.

==Appearances==

===In the video games===

===In other media===

In the anime, Lt. Surge, the Gym Leader of Vermilion City, has a Raichu that defeated Ash's Pikachu with its sheer power. After discussing evolution with Pikachu to match Raichu's power (Pikachu refused to evolve), Ash used a strategy relying on Pikachu's speed to defeat Raichu the next day.[tpl]cite episode| title = Electric Shock Showdown | series = Pokémon | credits = Atsuhiro Tomioka (writer) | network = Various | airdate = September 25, 1998 | season = Indigo League|number = 14[/tpl] Ever since that moment on, Raichu developed a newfound respect towards Pikachu. Raichu also appeared causing trouble for Pikachu and co. in Pikachu's Vacation, along with Marill, Snubbull, and Cubone.
Lt. Surge has a Raichu in Pokémon Adventures, which was first seen in Silph Co. but never participated in battles until fighting the Masked Man in his Mahogany Hideout, where it helped Surge break in and seemingly backed the mastermind into a corner, until his Houndour called upon dozens of wild Houndour to thwart Surge, instead.
