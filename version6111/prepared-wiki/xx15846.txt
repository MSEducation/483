Diana Wynne Jones (16 August 1934 – 26 March 2011) was an English writer, principally of fantasy novels for children and adults, as well as a small amount of non-fiction. Some of her better-known works are the Chrestomanci series, the Dalemark series; the novels Howl's Moving Castle and Dark Lord of Derkholm; and The Tough Guide to Fantasyland.

==Early life and marriage==

Jones was born in London, the daughter of Marjorie (née Jackson) and Richard Aneurin Jones, both of whom were educators. When war was announced, shortly after her fifth birthday, she was evacuated to Wales, and thereafter moved several times, including periods in Coniston Water, in York, and back in London. In 1943 her family finally settled in Thaxted, Essex, where her parents worked running an educational conference centre.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/diana-wynne-jones-doyenne-of-fantasy-writers-whose-books-for-children-paved-the-way-for-jk-rowling-2257675.html |title=Diana Wynne Jones: Doyenne of fantasy writers whose books for children paved the way for JK Rowling |last=Butler |first=Charlie |work=The Independent |date=2011-03-31 |accessdate=2013-06-03[/tpl] There, Jones and her two younger sisters Isobel (later Professor Isobel Armstrong, the literary critic) and Ursula spent a childhood left chiefly to their own devices. After attending the Friends School Saffron Walden, she studied English at St Anne's College in Oxford, where she attended lectures by both C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien before graduating in 1956.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/goingout/2003/03/05/books.shtml |title=Wrestling with an angel |last=Parsons |first=Caron |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=Going Out in Bristol |date=2003-03-27 |accessdate=2013-06-03[/tpl] In the same year she married John Burrow, a scholar of medieval literature, with whom she had three sons, Richard, Michael and Colin. After a brief period in London, in 1957 the couple returned to Oxford, where they stayed until moving to Bristol in 1976.
According to her autobiography, Jones decided she was an atheist when she was a child.(autobiography). The Diana Wynne Jones fansite.

==Career==

Jones' books range from amusing slapstick situations to sharp social observation, to witty parody of literary forms. Foremost amongst the latter are her Tough Guide to Fantasyland, and its fictional companion-pieces Dark Lord of Derkholm (1998) and Year of the Griffin (2000), which provide a merciless (though not unaffectionate) critique of formulaic sword-and-sorcery epics.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]

In 2004, Hayao Miyazaki made the Japanese-language animated movie Howl's Moving Castle, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

Jones' book on clichés in fantasy fiction, The Tough Guide To Fantasyland (nonfiction), has a cult following among writers and critics, despite being difficult to find due to an erratic printing history. It was recently reissued in the UK, and has been reissued in the USA in 2006 by Firebird Books.
