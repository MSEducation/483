Van Morrison, OBE (born George Ivan Morrison; 31 August 1945) is a Northern Irish singer-songwriter and musician. His live performances at their best are described as mystical and transcendental,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/huffpost-reviews-van-morr_b_161308.html|title=HuffPost Reviews:Van Morrison--Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl|last=Rogogna|first= Mike|date=27 January 2009|newspaper=Huffington Post|accessdate=18 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/REVIEW-Van-Morrison-Colston-Hall-Bristol-5-5/story-20520103-detail/story.html|title=REVIEW: Van Morrison, Colston Hall in Bristol - 5/5|last=Taylor|first= Mark|date=29 January 2014|newspaper=Bristol Post|accessdate=29 January 2014[/tpl] while some of his recordings, such as the studio albums Astral Weeks and Moondance and the live album It's Too Late to Stop Now, are critically acclaimed and appear at the top of many greatest album lists.
Known as "Van the Man" to his fans, Morrison started his professional career when, as a teenager in the late 1950s, he played a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for various Irish showbands covering the popular hits of the day. He rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R&B band Them, with whom he recorded the garage band classic "Gloria". His solo career began under the pop-hit oriented guidance of Bert Berns with the release of the hit single "Brown Eyed Girl" in 1967.
After Berns' death, Warner Bros. Records bought out his contract and allowed him three sessions to record Astral Weeks in 1968.Turner (1993). pages 86 – 90 Even though this album would gradually garner high praise, it was initially poorly received; however, the next one, Moondance, established Morrison as a major artist,[tpl]cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_van_morrisons_moondance/|publisher=mixonline.com|title=Classic Tracks: Van Morrison's Moondance|date=1 April 2005|author=Eskow, Gary|accessdate=26 May 2009[/tpl] and throughout the 1970s he built on his reputation with a series of critically acclaimed albums and live performances. Morrison continues to record and tour, producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received, sometimes collaborating with other artists, such as Georgie Fame and The Chieftains. In 2008 he performed Astral Weeks live for the first time since 1968.
Much of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and R&B, such as the popular singles "Brown Eyed Girl", "Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)", "Domino" and "Wild Night". An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz, and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as Astral Weeks and lesser-known works such as Veedon Fleece and Common One.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/index.php/exhibits/bio/C333S|title=SHOF: Van Morrison biography|publisher=songwritersshalloffame.org|accessdate=7 July 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musthear.com/reviews/veedonfleece.html|author=Ballon, John|date=28 December 2008|title=Musthear review: Veedon Fleece|publisher=musthear.com|accessdate=18 May 2010[/tpl] The two strains together are sometimes referred to as "Celtic Soul".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/0,27693,Astral_Weeks,00.html|work=TIME |date=13 November 2006|author=Light, Alan|title=The All-Time 100 Albums|accessdate=6 May 2010[/tpl]
Morrison has received considerable acclaim, including six Grammy Awards, the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, being inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and appearing on several "Greatest Artists" lists.

==Life and career==

===Early life and musical roots: 1945–64===

George Ivan (Van) Morrison was born on 31 August 1945, at 125 Hynford Street, Bloomfield, Belfast, Northern Ireland, as the only child of George Morrison, a shipyard electrician, and Violet Stitt Morrison, a singer and tap dancer in her youth.[tpl]cite web| date=22 September 2007|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/its-van-the-mam-13478426.html|author=McNeilly, Claire|title=It's Van: The Mam|publisher=Belfast Telegraph|accessdate=26 September 2007[/tpl] Van Morrison's family roots descend from the Ulster Scots population that settled in Belfast.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=16537|publisher=allaboutjazz.com|title=Van Morrison at All About Jazz|accessdate=12 December 2009[/tpl]Hinton (1997), page 18.Heylin (2003), page 4. From 1950 to 1956, Morrison, who began to be known as "Van" during this time, attended Elmgrove Primary School.Turner (1993), page 20. Morrison's father had what was at the time one of the largest record collections in Ulster (acquired during his sojourn in Detroit, Michigan in the early 1950s),Hinton (1997), page 19. and the young Morrison grew up listening to artists such as Jelly Roll Morton, Ray Charles, Lead Belly, and Solomon Burke;Hinton (1997), page 20. of whom Morrison later said, "If it weren't for guys like Ray and Solomon, I wouldn't be where I am today. Those guys were the inspiration that got me going. If it wasn't for that kind of music, I couldn't do what I'm doing now."[tpl]cite web|date=2 June 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080618182003/www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanmorrison/articles/story/7371946/renaissance_van|archivedate=18 June 2008|title=Renaissance Van|author=Wild, David|work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=30 April 2010|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanmorrison/articles/story/7371946/renaissance_van[/tpl] His father's record collection exposed him to various musical genres, such as the blues of Muddy Waters; the gospel of Mahalia Jackson; the jazz of Charlie Parker; the folk music of Woody Guthrie; and country music from Hank Williams and Jimmie Rodgers, while the first record he ever bought was by blues musician Sonny Terry.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2009/03/09/090309ta_talk_greenman|title=Listening Party|magazine=New Yorker|author=Greenman, Ben|date=9 March 2009|accessdate=18 May 2010[/tpl] When Lonnie Donegan had a hit with "Rock Island Line", written by Huddie Ledbetter (Lead Belly), Morrison felt he was familiar with and able to connect with skiffle music as he had been hearing Lead Belly before that.Collis (1996), page 33.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/people/bc/2000/09/19/morrison/index.html|title=http://www.salon.com/people/bc/2000/09/19/morrison/index.html|title=Van Morrison|publisher=salon.com|author=Elder, Sean|date=19 September 2000|accessdate=18 May 2010[/tpl]
Morrison's father bought him his first acoustic guitar when he was eleven, and he learned to play rudimentary chords from the song book, The Carter Family Style, edited by Alan Lomax.Turner (1993), page 25. A year later, when he was twelve years old, Morrison formed his first band, a skiffle group, "The Sputniks", named after the recently launched Soviet satellite, Sputnik 1.Hinton (1997), page 22. In 1958, the band played at some of the local cinemas, and Morrison took the lead, contributing most of the singing and arranging. Other short-lived groups followed – at fourteen, he formed Midnight Special, another modified skiffle band and played at a school concert. Then, when he heard Jimmy Giuffre playing saxophone on "The Train and The River", he talked his father into buying him a saxophone,Heylin (2003), page 34. and took lessons in tenor sax and music reading.Turner (1993), page 26.
Now playing the saxophone, Morrison joined with various local bands, including one called Deanie Sands and the Javelins, with whom he played guitar and shared singing. The line-up of the band was lead vocalist Deanie Sands, guitarist George Jones and drummer, vocalist Roy Kane.[ref]
</ref> Later the four main musicians of the Javelins, with the addition of Wesley Black as pianist, became known as the Monarchs.<ref name="TurnerPage28">Turner (1993), page 28.</ref>
Morrison attended Orangefield Boys Secondary School, leaving in July 1960 with no qualifications. As a member of a working-class community, it was expected that he would get a regular full-time job, so after several short apprenticeship positions, he settled into a job as a window cleaner—later alluded to in his songs "Cleaning Windows" and "Saint Dominic's Preview".Rogan (2006), page 48. However, he had been developing his musical interests from an early age and continued playing with the Monarchs part-time. Young Morrison also played with the Harry Mack Showband, the Great Eight, with his older workplace friend, Geordie (G. D.) Sproule, whom he later named as one of his biggest influences.Rogan (2006), pages 43–48.
At age 17, he toured Europe for the first time with the Monarchs, now calling themselves the International Monarchs. This Irish showband, with Morrison playing saxophone, guitar and harp, in addition to back-up duty on bass and drums, toured steamy clubs and US Army bases in Scotland, England, and Germany, often playing five sets a night. While in Germany, the band recorded a single, "Boozoo Hully Gully"/"Twingy Baby", under the name Georgie and The Monarchs. This was Morrison's first recording, taking place in November 1963 at Ariola Studios in Cologne with Morrison on saxophone; it made the lower reaches of the German charts.
Upon returning to Belfast in November 1963, the group disbanded,Turner (1993), pages 33–38. so Morrison connected with Geordie Sproule again and played with him in the Manhattan Showband along with guitarist Herbie Armstrong. When Armstrong auditioned to play with Brian Rossi and the Golden Eagles, Morrison went along and was hired as a blues singer.Rogan (2006), page 78.

===Them: 1964–66===

The roots of Them, the band that first broke Morrison on the international scene, came in April 1964 when Morrison responded to an advert for musicians to play at a new R&B club at the Maritime Hotel – an old dance hall frequented by sailors. The new R&B club needed a band for its opening night; however, Morrison had left the Golden Eagles (the group with which he had been performing at the time), so he created a new band out of The Gamblers, an East Belfast group formed by Ronnie Millings, Billy Harrison, and Alan Henderson in 1962. Eric Wrixon, still a schoolboy, was the piano player and keyboardist. Morrison played saxophone and harmonica and shared vocals with Billy Harrison. They followed Eric Wrixon's suggestion for a new name, and The Gamblers morphed into Them, their name taken from the Fifties horror movie Them!.Rogan (2006), pp. 79–83
The band's strong R&B performances at the Maritime attracted attention. Them performed without a routine and Morrison ad libbed, creating his songs live as he performed.Hinton (1997), page 40. While the band did covers, they also played some of Morrison's early songs, such as "Could You Would You", which he had written in Camden Town while touring with The Manhattan Showband.Rogan (2006), page 76 The debut of Morrison's "Gloria" took place on stage here. Sometimes, depending on his mood, the song could last up to twenty minutes. Morrison has stated that "Them lived and died on the stage at the Maritime Hotel," believing that the band did not manage to capture the spontaneity and energy of their live performances on their records.Turner (1993), page 44. The statement also reflected the instability of the Them line-up, with numerous members passing through the ranks after the definitive Maritime period. Morrison and Henderson would remain the only constants, and a highly unsuccessful version of Them even soldiered on after Morrison's departure.Heylin (2003), page 118
Dick Rowe of Decca Records became aware of the band's performances, and signed Them to a standard two-year contract. In that period, they released two albums and ten singles, with two more singles released after Morrison departed the band. They had three chart hits, "Baby, Please Don't Go" (1964), "Here Comes the Night" (1965), and "Mystic Eyes" (1965), though it was the b-side of "Baby, Please Don't Go", the garage band classic, "Gloria",Turner (1993), pages 48–51 that went on to become a rock standard covered by Patti Smith, The Doors, Shadows of Knight, Jimi Hendrix and many others.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=song|id=t3122630|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |publisher=allmusic.com|author=Janovitz, Bill|title=Gloria:Them:song review|accessdate=21 May 2010[/tpl]

Building on the success of their singles in the United States, and riding on the back of the British Invasion, Them undertook a two-month tour of America in May and June 1966 that included a residency from 30 May to 18 June at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles.Turner (1993), pages 65 – 66. The Doors were the supporting act on the last week,[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.waiting-forthe-sun.net/Pages/Venues/whisky_them.html|author=Lawrence, Paul (2002)|title=The Doors and Them: twin Morrisons of different mothers|publisher=waiting-forthe-sun.net|accessdate=7 July 2008[/tpl] and Morrison's influence on The Doors singer, Jim Morrison, was noted by John Densmore in his book Riders On The Storm. Brian Hinton relates how "Jim Morrison learned quickly from his near namesake's stagecraft, his apparent recklessness, his air of subdued menace, the way he would improvise poetry to a rock beat, even his habit of crouching down by the bass drum during instrumental breaks."Hinton (1997), page 67. On the final night, the two Morrisons and the two bands jammed together on "Gloria".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chickenonaunicycle.com/Whisky-A-Go-Go%20History.htm|author=Arnold, Corry|date=23 January 2006|title=The History of the Whisky-A-Go-Go|publisher=chickenonaunicyle.com|accessdate=30 June 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.harbour.sfu.ca/~hayward/van/glossary/doors.html|title=Glossary entry for The Doors|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070310195120/http://www.harbour.sfu.ca/~hayward/van/glossary/doors.html|archivedate=10 March 2007[/tpl] from Van Morrison website.

Toward the end of the tour the band members became involved in a dispute with their manager, Decca Records' Phil Solomon, over the revenues paid to the band; that, coupled with the expiry of their work visas, meant the band returned from America dejected. After two more concerts in Ireland, Them split up. Morrison concentrated on writing some of the songs that would appear on Astral Weeks, while the remnants of the band reformed in 1967 and relocated in America.Turner (1993), pages 72–73.

===Start of solo career with Bang Records and "Brown Eyed Girl" – 1967===

Bert Berns, Them’s producer and composer of their 1965 hit, "Here Comes the Night", persuaded Morrison to return to New York to record solo for his new label, Bang Records.Rogan (2006), page 188. Morrison flew over and signed a contract he had not fully studied.Heylin (2003), pages 144-147 Then, during a two-day recording session at A & R Studios starting 28 March 1967, eight songs were recorded, originally intended to be used as four singles.Turner (1993), page 76 Instead, these songs were released as the album Blowin' Your Mind! without Morrison being consulted. He said he only became aware of the album's release when a friend mentioned on a phone call that he had just bought a copy of it. He later commented to Donal Corvin in a 1973 interview: "I wasn't really happy with it. He picked the bands and tunes. I had a different concept of it."Rogan (2006), page 204.
However, from these early sessions emerged "Brown Eyed Girl". Captured on the 22nd take on the first day,Heylin (2003), page 152 this song was released as a single in mid-June 1967,Rogan (2006), p.201 reaching number ten in the US charts in 1967. "Brown Eyed Girl" became Morrison's most played song and over the years it has remained a classic; forty years later in 2007, it was the fourth most requested song of DJs in the US.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aperfectdj.com/Z%20Most%20played%20songs.htm#200%20from%202007//www.aperfectdj.com/Z%20Most%20played%20songs.htm#101|title=Most played 2007|publisher=aperfectdj.com|accessdate=11 September 2008[/tpl]
Following the death of Berns in 1967, Morrison became involved in a contract dispute with Berns' widow, Ilene Berns, that prevented him from performing on stage or recording in the New York area.Rogan (2006), pages 212–215. The song "Big Time Operators", released in 1993, is thought to allude to his dealings with the New York music business during this time period.Rogan (2006) page 216. He then moved to Boston, Massachusetts, and was soon confronted with personal and financial problems; he had "slipped into a malaise" and had trouble finding concert bookings.Rogan (2006) page 217. However, through the few gigs he could find, he regained his professional footing and started recording with the Warner Bros. Records label.Heylin (2003), page 170.Heylin (2003), pages 176–177. The record company managed to buy out his contract with Bang Records. Morrison fulfilled a clause that bound him to submit thirty-six original songs within a year to Web IV Music, Berns' music publishing company, by recording thirty-one songs in one session; however, Ilene Berns thought the songs "nonsense music ... about ringworms" and did not use them.Rogan (2006), pages 212–222.Turner (1993), page 80 The throwaway compositions would come to be known as the "revenge" songs.Heylin (2003), page 159

===Astral Weeks – 1968===

 "Astral Weeks is about the power of the human voice – ecstatic agony, agonising ecstacy. Here is an Irish tenor reborn as a White Negro – a Caucasian Soul Man – pleading and beseeching over a bed of dreamy folk-jazz instrumentation: acoustic bass, brushed drums, vibes and acoustic guitar, the odd string quartet – and of course flute."   Barney Hoskyns – Mojo[tpl]cite web|url=http://neumu.net/drama/2003/2003-00019/2003-00019_drama.shtml|title=The 'Masterpiece' that is Astral Weeks|publisher=neumu.net|last=Goldberg|first=Michael|date=23 June 2003|accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl]   

His first album for Warner Bros. Records was Astral Weeks (which he had already performed in several clubs around Boston), a mystical song cycle, often considered to be his best work and one of the best albums of all time.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/nov/02/vanmorrison-popandrock|title=Is this the best album ever made?|author=O'Hagan, Sean|date=2 November 2008|publisher =The Guardian|location =London|accessdate=16 June 2010[/tpl]

Morrison has said, "When Astral Weeks came out, I was starving, literally."Hinton (1997), page 100. Released in 1968, the album eventually achieved critical acclaim, but it originally received an indifferent response from the public. To this day, it remains in an unclassifiable music genre and has been described variously as hypnotic, meditative, and as possessing a unique musical power. It has been compared to French Impressionism and mystical Celtic poetry.[tpl]Cite news|title=Let's record gratitude for Van's monumental talent|last=Adams|first=David|date=28 February 2008|publisher=The Irish Times[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sfloman.com/vanmorrison.html#1|title=Astral Weeks|publisher=sfloman.com|last=Floman|first=Scott|accessdate=8 October 2010[/tpl]Hinton (1997), pages 88–89. A 2004 Rolling Stone magazine review begins with the words: "This is music of such enigmatic beauty that thirty-five years after its release, Astral Weeks still defies easy, admiring description."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/astral-weeks-van-morrison-19691231|title=(19) Astral Weeks|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=18 September 2011[/tpl] Alan Light would later describe Astral Weeks as "like nothing he had done previously—and really, nothing anyone had done previously. Morrison sings of lost love, death, and nostalgia for childhood in the Celtic soul that would become his signature." It has been placed on many lists of best albums of all time. In the 1995 Mojo list of 100 Best Albums, it was listed as number two and was number nineteen on the Rolling Stone magazine's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/mojo.html|title=Mojo: 100 Greatest albums ever made (1995)|publisher=rocklistmusic.co.uk|accessdate=25 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/van-morrison-moondance-19691231|title=66Van Morrison, 'Moondance'|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=20 August 2012[/tpl] In December 2009, it was voted the top Irish album of all time by a poll of leading Irish musicians conducted by Hot Press magazine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/news/6125654.html|title=Van's album tops musician's poll|publisher=Hotpress|date=18 December 2009|accessdate=18 December 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1219/1224260976188.html|title=Stellar Van Morrison album tops best album list|author=McGreevy, Ronan|publisher=Irish Times|date=19 December 2009|accessdate=21 December 2009[/tpl]

===From Moondance to Into the Music: 1970–79===

Morrison's third solo album, Moondance, which was released in 1970, became his first million selling album and reached number twenty-nine on the Billboard charts.Turner (1993), page 95.Turner (1993), page 98.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=van%20morrison&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25|publisher=riaa.com|title=RIAA-Gold and Platinum|accessdate=21 April 2009[/tpl] The style of Moondance stood in contrast to that of Astral Weeks. Whereas Astral Weeks had a sorrowful and vulnerable tone, Moondance restored a more optimistic and cheerful message to his music.Yorke (1975), page 69. The title track, although not released in the US as a single until 1977, received heavy play in FM radio formats.Rogan (2006), page 250. "Into the Mystic" has also gained a wide following over the years.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p107175|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |publisher=allmusic.com|title=Van Morrison Biography|author=Ankeny, Jason|accessdate=7 July 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.xpn.org/images/pdfs/wxpn_885songslist.pdf|publisher=xpn.org|title=885songslist|accessdate=14 May 2009[/tpl] "Come Running", which reached the American Top 40, rescued Morrison from what seemed then as Hot 100 obscurity.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p107175|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|publisher=allmusic.com|title=Van Morrison Chart Awards:singles|accessdate=24 September 2008[/tpl] Moondance was both well received and favourably reviewed. Lester Bangs and Greil Marcus had a combined full page review in Rolling Stone, stating that Morrison now had "the striking imagination of a consciousness that is visionary in the strongest sense of the word."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/spmorrisonvan.html|author=Marcus, Greil and Bangs, Lester|title=Moondance:Van Morrison |publisher=superseventies.com|date=17 March 1970|accessdate=29 April 2010[/tpl] "That was the type of band I dig," Morrison said of the Moondance sessions. "Two horns and a rhythm section – they're the type of bands that I like best." He produced the album himself as he felt like nobody else knew what he wanted.Heylin (2003), page 226. Moondance was listed at number sixty-five on the Rolling Stone magazine's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In March 2007, Moondance was listed as number seventy-two on the NARM Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of the "Definitive 200".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timepieces.nl/Top100's/2007NARM.html|publisher=timepieces|title=2007 National Association of Recording Merchandisers|accessdate=6 May 2010[/tpl]
Over the next few years, he released a succession of albums, starting with a second one in 1970. His Band and the Street Choir had a free, more relaxed sound than Moondance, but not the perfection, in the opinion of critic Jon Landau who felt like "a few more numbers with a gravity of 'Street Choir' would have made this album as perfect as anyone could have stood."[tpl]Cite journal|url= http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/2747/21378 | last =Landau | first =John | title =His Band and the Street Choir music review | magazine =Rolling Stone | date=4 February 1971| accessdate=23 July 2010[/tpl] It contained the hit single "Domino", which charted at number nine in the Billboard Hot 100.Collis (1996), page 122.
In 1971, he released another well-received album, Tupelo Honey.Rogan (2006), page 259. This album produced the hit single "Wild Night" that was later covered by John Mellencamp. The title song has a notably country-soul feel about it[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=song|id=t1648130|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=allmusic Tupelo Honey Review|last=Janovitz|first=Bill|accessdate=6 February 2010[/tpl] and the album ended with another country tune, "Moonshine Whiskey". Morrison said he originally intended to make an all country album.Rogan (2006), pages 267–268. The recordings were as live as possible – after rehearsing the songs the musicians would go into the studio and play a whole set in one take.Turner (1993), page 107 His co-producer, Ted Templeman, described this recording process as the "scariest thing I've ever seen. When he's got something together, he wants to put it down right away with no overdubbing."Hinton (1997), page 137.
Released in 1972, Saint Dominic's Preview revealed Morrison's break from the more accessible style of his previous three albums and moving back towards the more daring, adventurous, and meditative aspects of Astral Weeks. The combination of two styles of music demonstrated a versatility not previously found in his earlier albums.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/2747/21052 | last =Holden | first =Stephen | title =Saint Dominic's Preview Music Review | magazine =Rolling Stone | date=31 August 1972| accessdate=23 July 2010[/tpl] Two songs, "Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)" and "Redwood Tree", reached the Hot 100 singles chart. The songs "Listen to the Lion" and "Almost Independence Day" are each over ten minutes long and employ the type of poetic imagery not heard since Astral Weeks.Heylin (2003), pages 255–256.

He released his next album Hard Nose the Highway in 1973 receiving mixed, but mostly negative, reviews. The album contained the popular song "Warm Love" but otherwise has been largely dismissed critically.Heylin (2003), pages 265–267. In a 1973 Rolling Stone review, it was described as: "psychologically complex, musically somewhat uneven and lyrically excellent."[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/2747/21055 | last =Holden | first =Stephen | title =Hard Nose the Highway Music Review | magazine =Rolling Stone | date=27 September 1973|accessdate=23 July 2010[/tpl]
During a three-week vacation visit to Ireland in October 1973, Morrison wrote seven of the songs that would make up his next album, Veedon Fleece.Turner (1993), page 122. Though it attracted scant initial attention, its critical stature grew markedly over the years—with Veedon Fleece now often considered to be one of Morrison's most impressive and poetic works.Rogan (2006), page 301.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r13462|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|publisher=allmusic.com|title=Veedon Fleece: Review|author=Ankeny, Jason & Jurek, Thom|accessdate=13 May 2009[/tpl] In a 2008 Rolling Stone review, Andy Greene writes that when released in late 1974: "it was greeted by a collective shrug by the rock critical establishment" and concludes: "He's released many wonderful albums since, but he's never again hit the majestic heights of this one."[tpl]Cite journal| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/7910/38434 | last =Greene | first =Andy | title =Veedon Fleece Music Review | magazine =Rolling Stone | date=14 July 2008| accessdate=23 July 2010[/tpl] "You Don't Pull No Punches, But You Don't Push the River", one of the album's side closers, exemplifies the long, hypnotic, cryptic Morrison with its references to visionary poet William Blake and to the seemingly Grail-like Veedon Fleece object.Rogan (2006), page 300.
Morrison would not release a follow-up album for another three years. After a decade without taking time off, he said in an interview, he needed to get away from music completely and ceased listening to it for several months.Rogan (2006), page 306. Also suffering from writer's block, he seriously considered leaving the music business for good.Heylin (2003), page 305. Speculation that an extended jam session would be released either under the title Mechanical Bliss, or Naked in the Jungle, or Stiff Upper Lip, came to nothing,Rogan (2006), pages 304–306. and Morrison's next album was A Period of Transition in 1977, a collaboration with Dr. John, who had appeared at The Last Waltz concert with Morrison in 1976. The album received a mild critical reception and marked the beginning of a very prolific period of song making.

 Into the Music: "The album's last four songs, "Angelou", "And the Healing Has Begun", and "It's All in the Game/You Know What They're Writing About" are a veritable tour-de-force with Morrison summoning every vocal trick at his disposal from "Angelou's climactic shouts to the sexually-charged, half-mumbled monologue in "And the Healing Has Begun" to the barely audible whisper that is the album's final sound."
 (Scott Thomas Review')
The following year, Morrison released Wavelength; it became at that time the fastest-selling album of his career and soon went gold.Hinton (1997), page 210. The title track became a modest hit, peaking at number forty-two. Making use of 1970s synthesisers, it mimics the sounds of the shortwave radio stations that he listened to in his youth.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=song|id=t1621843|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Wavelength:song review|author=Janovitz, Bill|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=11 September 2008[/tpl] The opening track, "Kingdom Hall" evoked Morrison's own childhood experiences attending church with his mother and foretold a religious theme that would be more evident in his next album, Into the Music.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timepieces.nl/Albums-M/VanMorrisonIntoTheMusic.htm|author=Cocks, Jay|date=1 November 1979|publisher=timepieces|title=Van Morrison: Into the Music |accessdate=29 April 2010[/tpl]
Considered by Allmusic as "the definitive post-classic-era Morrison", Into the Music, was released in the last year of the 1970s. Songs on this album for the first time alluded to the healing power of music, which would become an abiding interest of Morrison's.Hage (2009), page 89. "Bright Side of the Road" was a joyful, uplifting song that would appear on the soundtrack of the movie, Michael.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0607341/|title=Van Morrison at IMDb|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=12 January 2009[/tpl]

===Common One to Avalon Sunset: 1980–89===

With his next album, the new decade found Morrison following his muse into uncharted territory and merciless reviews.Heylin (2003), page 364.Rogan (2006), page 330. In February 1980, Morrison and a group of musicians travelled to Super Bear, a studio in the French Alps, to record (on the site of a former abbey) what is considered to be the most controversial album in his discography; later "Morrison admitted that his original concept was even more esoteric than the final product."Hinton (1997), page 230.Heylin (2003), page 365. The album, Common One, consisted of six songs, each of varying length. The longest, "Summertime in England", lasted fifteen and one-half minutes and ended with the words,"Can you feel the silence?". NME magazine's Paul Du Noyer called the album "colossally smug and cosmically dull; an interminable, vacuous and drearily egotistical stab at spirituality: Into the muzak." Even Greil Marcus, whose previous writings had been favourably inclined towards Morrison, said: "It's Van acting the part of the 'mystic poet' he thinks he's supposed to be." Morrison insisted that the album was never "meant to be a commercial album." Biographer Clinton Heylin concludes: "He would not attempt anything so ambitious again. Henceforth every radical idea would be tempered by some notion of commerciality." Later the critics would reassess the album more favourably with the success of "Summertime in England". Lester Bangs wrote in 1982, "Van was making holy music even though he thought he was, and us rock critics had made our usual mistake of paying too much attention to the lyrics."
Morrison's next album, Beautiful Vision, released in 1982, had him returning once again to the music of his Northern Irish roots.Rogan (2006), page 338. Well received by the critics and public, it produced a minor UK hit single, "Cleaning Windows", that referenced one of Morrison's first jobs after leaving school.Rogan (2006), pages 337–338. Several other songs on the album, "Vanlose Stairway", "She Gives Me Religion", and the instrumental, "Scandinavia" show the presence of a new personal muse in his life: a Danish public relations agent, who would share Morrison's spiritual interests and serve as a steadying influence on him throughout most of the 1980s.Heylin (2003), page 371. "Scandinavia", with Morrison on piano,[tpl]Cite journal| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/3045/21723 | last =Fricke | first =David | title =Inarticulate Speech of the Heart Music Review | magazine =Rolling Stone | date=28 April 1983| accessdate=23 July 2010[/tpl] was nominated in the Best Rock Instrumental Performance category for the 25th Annual Grammy Awards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1983/grammys.htm|title=Rock on the Net: 25th Annual Grammy Awards-1983|publisher=rockonthenet|accessdate=8 October 2009[/tpl]
Much of the music Morrison released throughout the 1980s continued to focus on the themes of spirituality and faith. His 1983 album, Inarticulate Speech of the Heart was "a move towards creating music for meditation" with synthesisers, uilleann pipes and flute sounds and four of the tracks were instrumentals.Turner (1993), page 153. The titling of the album and the presence of the instrumentals were noted to be indicative of Morrison's long-held belief that "it's not the words one uses but the force of conviction behind those words that matters." During this period of time, Morrison had studied Scientology and gave "Special Thanks" to L. Ron Hubbard on the album's credits.Turner (1993), page 150
A Sense of Wonder, Morrison's 1985 album, pulled together the spiritual themes contained in his last four albums, which were defined in a Rolling Stone review as: "rebirth (Into the Music), deep contemplation and meditation, (Common One); ecstasy and humility (Beautiful Vision); and blissful, mantra like languor (Inarticulate Speech of the Heart)."[tpl]Cite journal| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/3045/21725 | last =Puterbaugh | first =Parke | title =A Sense of Wonder Music Review | magazine =Rolling Stone | date=9 May 1985| accessdate=23 July 2010[/tpl] The single, "Tore Down a la Rimbaud" was a reference to Rimbaud and an earlier bout of writer's block that Morrison had encountered in 1974.Heylin (2003), page 308. In 1985, Morrison also wrote the musical score for the movie, Lamb starring Liam Neeson.Collis (1996), page 162.
Morrison's 1986 release, No Guru, No Method, No Teacher, was said to contain a "genuine holiness...and musical freshness that needs to be set in context to understand."Hinton (1997), page 255. Critical response was favourable with a Sounds reviewer calling the album "his most intriguingly involved since Astral Weeks" and "Morrison at his most mystical, magical best."Heylin (2003), page 396.Rogan (2006), page 360. It contains the song, "In the Garden" that, according to Morrison, had a "definite meditation process which is a 'form' of transcendental meditation as its basis. It's not TM". He entitled the album as a rebuttal to media attempts to place him in various creeds.Hinton (1997), page 253. In an interview in the Observer he told Anthony Denselow:
After releasing the "No Guru" album, Morrison's music appeared less gritty and more adult contemporary with the well-received 1987 album, Poetic Champions Compose, considered to be one of his recording highlights of the 1980s.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r13472|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|title=AllMusic review:Poetic Champions Compose|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=7 July 2008[/tpl] The romantic ballad from this album, "Someone Like You", has been featured subsequently in the soundtracks of several movies, including 1995's French Kiss, and in 2001, both Someone Like You and Bridget Jones's Diary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,104926,00.html|author=Bonin, Liane|date=4 April 2001|title=Song Sung Blue|work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=13 July 2008[/tpl]
In 1988, he released Irish Heartbeat, a collection of traditional Irish folk songs recorded with the Irish group, The Chieftains, which reached number 18 in the UK album charts. The title song, "Irish Heartbeat", was originally recorded on his 1983 album Inarticulate Speech of the Heart.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=song|id=t877617|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Allmusic: Irish Heartbeat|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=7 July 2008[/tpl]
The 1989 album, Avalon Sunset, which featured the hit duet with Cliff Richard "Whenever God Shines His Light" and the ballad "Have I Told You Lately" (on which "earthly love transmutes into that for God."(Hinton),Hinton (1997), page 278. reached 13 on the UK album chart. Although considered to be a deeply spiritual album,[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r13474|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|publisher=allmusic.com|title=Avalon Sunset Review|accessdate=14 May 2009[/tpl] it also contained "Daring Night" which "deals with full, blazing sex, whatever it's churchy organ and gentle lilt suggest."(Hinton)Hinton (1997), page 280. Morrison's familiar themes of "God, woman, his childhood in Belfast and those enchanted moments when time stands still" were prominent in the songs.Turner (1993), page 163. He can be heard calling out the change of tempo at the end of this song, repeating the numbers "1 – 4" to cue the chord changes (the first and fourth chord in the key of the music). He often completed albums in two days, frequently releasing first takes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.electricrev.net/archive/2004/july/features-profiles1.html |author=Aiello, John|date=18 July 2002|title=July 2004 archives Wild Veils|publisher=electricrev.net|accessdate=3 July 2008[/tpl]Heylin (2003) pages 429–463.

===The Best of Van Morrison to Back on Top: 1990–99===

The early to middle 1990s were commercially successful for Morrison with three albums reaching the top five of the UK charts, sold-out concerts, and a more visible public profile; but this period also marked a decline in the critical reception to his work.Heylin (2003), pages 450–458. The decade began with the release of The Best of Van Morrison; compiled by Morrison himself, the album was focused on his hit singles, and became a multi-platinum success remaining a year and a half on the UK charts. Allmusic determined it to be "far and away the best selling album of his career."
After Enlightenment which included the hit singles "Real Real Gone" and the title cut in 1990, an ambitious double album "Hymns to the Silence" was released the following year, his only double studio album. Another compilation album, The Best of Van Morrison Volume Two was released in January 1993, followed by Too Long in Exile in June, another top five chart success.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tsort.info/music/cy84r9.htm|title=Album artist 49 -Van Morrison|publisher=tsort.info|accessdate=21 May 2010[/tpl]
The 1994 live double album A Night in San Francisco received favourable reviews as well as commercial success by reaching number eight on the UK charts.[tpl]Cite journal| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/7076/36727 | last =Puterbaugh | first =Parke | title =A Night in San Francisco Music Review | magazine =Rolling Stone | date=14 July 1994| accessdate=23 July 2010[/tpl] 1995's Days Like This also had large sales – though the critical reviews were not always favourable.Heylin (2003), page 458. This period also saw a number of side projects, including the live jazz performances of 1996's How Long Has This Been Going On, from the same year Tell Me Something: The Songs of Mose Allison, and 2000's The Skiffle Sessions – Live in Belfast 1998, all of which found Morrison paying tribute to his early musical influences.
In 1997, Morrison released The Healing Game. The album received mixed reviews, with the lyrics being described as "tired" and "dull",Rogan (2006), page 450. though critic Greil Marcus praised the musical complexity of the album by saying: "It carries the listener into a musical home so perfect and complete he or she might have forgotten that music could call up such a place, and then populate it with people, acts, wishes, fears."Marcus (2010), page 111. The following year, Morrison finally released some of his previously unissued studio recordings in a two-disc set, The Philosopher's Stone. His next release, 1999's Back on Top, achieved a modest success, being his highest charting album in the US since 1978's Wavelength.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p107175|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Van Morrison: Billboard albums|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=12 September 2008[/tpl]

The album, Down the Road released in May 2002, received a good critical reception and proved to be his highest charting album in the US since 1972's Saint Dominic's Preview. It had a nostalgic tone, with its fifteen tracks representing the various musical genres that Morrison had previously covered—including R&B, blues, country and folk;[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r589019|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|publisher=Allmusic|title=Down the Road Review|author=Ruhlmann, William|accessdate=21 May 2010[/tpl] one of the tracks was written as a tribute to his late father George, who had played a pivotal role in nurturing his early musical tastes.
Morrison's 2005 album, Magic Time, debuted at number twenty-five on the US Billboard 200 charts upon its May release, some forty years after Morrison first entered the public's eye as the frontman of Them.

==Live performances==

By 1972, after being a performer for nearly ten years, Morrison began experiencing stage fright when performing for audiences of thousands, as opposed to the hundreds as he had experienced in his early career. He became anxious on stage and would have difficulty establishing eye contact with the audience. He once said in an interview about performing on stage, "I dig singing the songs but there are times when it's pretty agonising for me to be out there." After a brief break from music, he started appearing in clubs, regaining his ability to perform live, albeit with smaller audiences.
The 1974 live double album, It's Too Late to Stop Now has been noted to be one of the greatest recordings of a live concert[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/f4588d98-4299-11e1-97b1-00144feab49a.html#axzz245cAjEnZ|title=It's too late to stop now|last=Aspden|first =Peter|publisher=Financial Times|date=20 January 2012|accessdate=20 August 2012[/tpl]

Soon after recording the album, Morrison restructured the Caledonia Soul Orchestra into a smaller unit, the Caledonia Soul Express.Heylin (2003), page 284.
On Thanksgiving Day 1976, Morrison performed at the farewell concert for The Band. Morrison's first live performance in several years, he considered skipping his appearance until the last minute, even refusing to go on stage when they announced his name. His manager, Harvey Goldsmith, said he "literally kicked him out there."Heylin (2003), page 313.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vice.com/read/summertime-in-england-a-monologue-on-van-morrison|title=Summertime in England: A Monologue on Van Morrison|last=Burnett|first=Adam R.|publisher=vice.com|date=31 August 2012|accessdate=2 September 2012[/tpl] Morrison was on good terms with The Band as near-neighbours in Woodstock, and they had the shared experience of stage-fright. At the concert, he performed two songs. His first was a rendition of the classic Irish song Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1RxTEOn_Y0|title=Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral, The Last Waltz[/tpl] His second song was "Caravan", from his 1970 album Moondance. Greil Marcus, in attendance at the concert, wrote: "Van Morrison turned the show around...singing to the rafters and ...burning holes in the floor. It was a triumph, and as the song ended Van began to kick his leg into the air out of sheer exuberance and he kicked his way right offstage like a Rockette. The crowd had given him a fine welcome and they cheered wildly when he left."Rolling Stone: "That Train Don't Stop Here Anymore."  Greil Marcus. December 30, 1976 The filmed concert served as the basis for Martin Scorsese's 1978 film, The Last Waltz.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/dvd_reviews/the_last_waltz|title=The Last Waltz|publisher=totalfilm.com|accessdate=17 September 2007[/tpl]
During his association with The Band, Morrison acquired the nicknames: "Belfast Cowboy" and "Van the Man".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/entertainment/republican/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-0/125688694981090.xml&coll=1|title=Singer Van Morrison continues to fascinate|publisher=The Republican|date=30 October 2009|accessdate=18 May 2010|last=O'Hare|first=Kevin[/tpl] When Morrison sang the duet "4% Pantomime" (that he co-wrote with Robbie Robertson), Richard Manuel calls him, "Oh, Belfast Cowboy". It would be included in The Band's album Cahoots. When he left the stage, after performing "Caravan" on The Last Waltz, Robertson calls out "Van the Man!"
On 21 July 1990, Morrison joined many other guests for Roger Waters' massive performance of The Wall – Live in Berlin with an estimated crowd of between three hundred thousand to half a million people and broadcast live on television.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rogerwaters.org/about_berlin.html|title=The Wall Live in Berlin|publisher=rogerwaters.org|accessdate=7 July 2998[/tpl] He sang "Comfortably Numb" with Roger Waters, and several members from The Band: Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Rick Danko. At concert's end, he and the other performers sang "The Tide Is Turning".
Morrison performed before an estimated audience of sixty to eighty thousand people when US President Bill Clinton visited Belfast, Northern Ireland on 30 November 1995. His song "Days Like This" had become the official anthem for the Northern Irish peace movement.Rogan (2006), page 437.
Van Morrison continued performing concerts in the 2000s throughout the year rather than touring. Playing few of his best-known songs in concert, he has firmly resisted relegation to a nostalgia act.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-11-06/music/van-morrison-and-astal-weeks-la-weekly-snags-a-rare-one-on-one-interview-with-the-elusive-singer/1|title=Van Morrison and Astral Weeks: LA Weekly snags a rare one-on-one interview with the elusive singer|publisher=laweekly.com|author=Foundas, Scott|date=5 November 2008|accessdate=8 February 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/action/article/2377/listening_to_old_voices_van_morrison |title=Van Morrison: The Lion in Winter |publisher=Paste Magazine |date=14 November 2005|author=Whitman, Andy|accessdate=15 May 2009[/tpl] During a 2006 interview, he told Paul Sexton:

On 7 and 8 November 2008, at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California, Morrison performed the entire Astral Weeks album live for the first time. The Astral Weeks band featured guitarist Jay Berliner, who played on the album that was released forty years previously in November 1968. Also featured on piano was Roger Kellaway.

In addition to It's Too Late to Stop Now and Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl, Morrison has released three other live albums: Live at the Grand Opera House Belfast in 1984; A Night in San Francisco in 1994 that Rolling Stone magazine felt stood out as: "the culmination of a career's worth of soul searching that finds Morrison's eyes turned toward heaven and his feet planted firmly on the ground"; and The Skiffle Sessions – Live in Belfast 1998 recorded with Lonnie Donegan and Chris Barber and released in 2000.

==Collaborations==

During the 1990s, Morrison developed a close association with two vocal talents at opposite ends of their careers: Georgie Fame (with whom Morrison had already worked occasionally) lent his voice and Hammond organ skills to Morrison's band; and Brian Kennedy's vocals complemented the grizzled voice of Morrison, both in studio and live performances.
The 1990s also saw an upsurge in collaborations by Morrison with other artists, a trend continuing into the new millennium. He recorded with Irish folk band The Chieftains on their 1995 album, The Long Black Veil. Morrison's song, "Have I Told You Lately" would win a Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals in 1996.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1996/grammys.htm|publisher=rockonthenet.com|title=38th Grammy awards-1996|accessdate=24 September 2008[/tpl]
He also produced and was featured on several tracks with blues legend John Lee Hooker on Hooker's 1997 album, Don't Look Back. This album would win a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album in 1998 and the title track "Don't Look Back", a duet featuring Morrison and Hooker, would also win a Grammy Award for "Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals" in 1998.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1998/grammys.htm|publisher=rockonthenet.com|title=40th annual Grammy awards – 1998|accessdate=10 April 2009[/tpl] The project capped a series of Morrison and Hooker collaborations that began in 1971 when they performed a duet on the title track of Hooker's 1972 album Never Get Out of These Blues Alive. On this album, Hooker also recorded a cover of Morrison's "T.B. Sheets".[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LhmEjnBwsnwC&lpg=PP1&dq=Boogie%20Man&pg=PA401#v=onepage&q=van%20morrison&f=false|title=Boogie Man: The Adventures of John Lee Hooker in the American Twentieth Century |publisher=Macmillan |last=Murray|first= Charles|accessdate=8 July 2011 | isbn=9780312270063[/tpl]

==Music==

===Vocals===

 It is at the heart of Morrison’s presence as a singer that when he lights on certain sounds, certain small moments inside a song—hesitations, silences, shifts in pressure, sudden entrances, slamming doors—can then suggest whole territories, completed stories, indistinct ceremonies, far outside anything that can be literally traced in the compositions that carry them.  Greil MarcusMarcus (2010), page 108.  
Featuring his characteristic growl—a mix of folk, blues, soul, jazz, gospel, and Ulster Scots Celtic influences—Morrison is widely considered by many rock historians to be one of the most unusual and influential vocalists in the history of rock and roll.[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080622011927/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanmorrison/biography|title=Van Morrison Biography: Rolling Stone|archivedate=22 June 2008|publisher=Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll (Simon and Shulster, 2001)|accessdate=17 May 2010|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanmorrison/biography[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p107175|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Allmusic: Van Morrison biography|author=Ankeny, Jason|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=6 July 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/van-morrison/|title=R&R Hall of Fame:Van Morrison|publisher=rockhall.com|accessdate=7 July 2008[/tpl] Critic Greil Marcus has gone so far as to say that "no white man sings like Van Morrison."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inthenews.co.uk/entertainment/reviews/music/van-morrison-still-on-top-greatest-hits-$1153228.htm|title=Van Morrison: Still on Top – The Greatest Hits|author=Meghan, Graham|date=7 October 2007|publisher=inthenews.co.uk|accessdate=17 October 2008[/tpl] In his 2010 book, Marcus wrote, "As a physical fact, Morrison may have the richest and most expressive voice pop music has produced since Elvis Presley, and with a sense of himself as an artist that Elvis was always denied."Marcus (2010), page 7
As Morrison began live performances of the 40-year-old album Astral Weeks in 2008, there were comparisons to his youthful voice of 1968. His early voice was described as "flinty and tender, beseeching and plaintive".[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/nov/02/vanmorrison-popandrock|work=The Guardian |author=O'Hagan, Sean|date=2 November 2008|title=Is this the best album ever made?|accessdate=2 May 2009 | location=London[/tpl] Forty years later, the difference in his vocal range and power were noticeable but reviewers and critic's comments were favourable: "Morrison's voice has expanded to fill his frame; a deeper, louder roar than the blue-eyed soul voice of his youth – softer on the diction – but none the less impressively powerful."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturecritics/bernadettemcnulty/5245540/On-another-Astral-plane.html|work=The Daily Telegraph |title=On Another Astral Plane|author=McNulty, Bernadette|date=29 April 2009|accessdate=2 May 2009 | location=London[/tpl] Morrison also commented on the changes in his approach to singing: "The approach now is to sing from lower down diaphragm so I do not ruin my voice. Before, I sang in the upper area of my throat, which tends to wreck the vocal cords over time. Singing from lower in the belly allows my resonance to carry far. I can stand four feet from a mic and be heard quite resonantly."Neil, Chris, Performing Songwriter, Issue 116, March/April 2009, Pages 44–50

===Songwriting and lyrics===

Morrison has written hundreds of songs[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1882001,00.html|work=TIME |title=10 Questions for Van Morrison|date=26 February 2009|accessdate=6 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p107175|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|publisher=allmusic.com|title=Van Morison songs|accessdate=7 May 2009[/tpl] during his career with a recurring theme reflecting a nostalgic yearning for the carefree days of his childhood in Belfast.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-02-18/music/the-astral-travels-of-van-morrison/|date=17 February 2009|publisher=villagevoice.com|author=Foundas, Scott|title=The Astral Travels of Van Morrison|accessdate=18 February 2009[/tpl] Some of his song titles derive from familiar locations in his childhood, such as "Cyprus Avenue" (a nearby street), "Orangefield" (the boys school he attended), and "On Hyndford Street" (where he was born). Also frequently present in Morrison's best love songs is a blending of the sacred-profane as evidenced in "Into the Mystic" and "So Quiet in Here".Hinton (1997), page 13.[tpl]Cite journal|magazine=Rolling Stone|title=Enlightenment: Van Morrison review|author=Swenson, John|date=15 November 1990[/tpl]
Beginning with his 1979 album, Into the Music and the song "And the Healing Has Begun", a frequent theme of his music and lyrics has been based on his belief in the healing power of music combined with a form of mystic Christianity. This theme has become one of the predominant qualities of his work.Collis (1996), page 149.
His lyrics show an influence of the visionary poets William Blake and W. B. YeatsHinton (1997), page 12. and others such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth.Turner (1993), page 145 Biographer Brian Hinton believes "like any great poet from Blake to Seamus Heaney he takes words back to their origins in magic...Indeed, Morrison is returning poetry to its earliest roots – as in Homer or Old English epics like Beowulf or the Psalms or folk song – in all of which words and music combine to form a new reality." Another biographer John Collis believes that Morrison's style of jazz singing and repeating phrases preclude his lyrics from being regarded as poetry or as Collis asserts: "he is more likely to repeat a phrase like a mantra, or burst into scat singing. The words may often be prosaic, and so can hardly be poetry."Collis (1996), page 10.
Morrison has described his songwriting method by remarking that: "I write from a different place. I do not even know what it is called or if it has a name. It just comes and I sculpt it, but it is also a lot of hard work doing the sculpting."

===Performance style===

 "Van Morrison is interested, obsessed with how much musical or verbal information he can compress into a small space, and, almost, conversely, how far he can spread one note, word, sound, or picture. To capture one moment, be it a caress or a twitch. He repeats certain phrases to extremes that from anybody else would seem ridiculous, because he's waiting for a vision to unfold, trying as unobtrusively as possible to nudge it along...It's the great search, fuelled by the belief that through these musical and mental processes illumination is attainable. Or may at least be glimpsed."   Lester Bangs[tpl]cite web|url=http://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~murray/astral.html|title= Lester Bangs on Astral Weeks|author=Lester Bangs|publisher=personal.cis.strath.ac.uk|accessdate=8 February 2009[/tpl]  
Critic Greil Marcus argues that given the truly distinctive breadth and complexity of Morrison's work, it is almost impossible to cast his work among that of others: "Morrison remains a singer who can be compared to no other in the history of rock & roll, a singer who cannot be pinned down, dismissed, or fitted into anyone's expectations."Marcus (1992), page 447. Or in the words of Jay Cocks: "He extends himself only to express himself. Alone among rock's great figures—and even in that company he is one of the greatest—Morrison is adamantly inward.

His live performances are dependent on building dynamics with spontaneity between himself and his band, whom he controls with hand gestures throughout, sometimes signalling impromptu solos from a selected band member. The music and vocals build towards a hypnotic and trance-like state that depends on in-the-moment creativity. Scott Foundas with LA Weekly wrote "he seeks to transcend the apparent boundaries of any given song; to achieve a total freedom of form; to take himself, his band and the audience on a journey whose destination is anything but known."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-05-14/columns/van-morrison-goes-astral-on-the-tonight-show/|title=Van Morrison Goes Astral on The Tonight Show|date=13 May 2009|journal=LA Weekly|last =Foundas|first=Scott|accessdate=18 December 2009[/tpl] Greil Marcus wrote an entire book devoted to examining the moments in Morrison's music where he reaches this state of transcendence and explains: "But in his music the same sense of escape from ordinary limits – a reach for, or the achievement of, a kind of violent transcendence – can come from hesitations, repetitions of words or phrases, pauses, the way a musical change by another musician is turned by Morrison as a bandleader or seized on by him as a singer and changed into a sound that becomes an event in and of itself. In these moments, the self is left behind, and the sound, that "yarragh," becomes the active agent: a musical person, with its own mind, its own body."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jun/05/listening-van-morrison-greil-marcus|title=Listening to Van Morrison by Greil Marcus|publisher=The Guardian|last=Marcus|first=Greil|date=4 June 2010|accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl] A book reviewer further described it as "This transcendent moment of music when the song and the singer are one thing not two, neither dependent on the other or separate from the other but melded to the other like one, like breath and life..."[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.muddywatermagazine.com/When-That-Rough-God-Goes-Riding-Review-by-Will-Brennan.html|title=When That Rough God Goes Riding:Book Review-Greil Marcus|author=Brennan, Will|date=25 April 2010|publisher=Muddy Water Magazine|accessdate=19 November 2011[/tpl]
Morrison has said he believes in the jazz improvisational technique of never performing a song the same way twice and except for the unique rendition of the Astral Weeks songs live, doesn't perform a concert from a preconceived set list.

===Genre===

The music of Van Morrison has encompassed many genres since his early days as a blues and R&B singer in Belfast. Over the years he has recorded songs from a varying list of genres drawn from many influences and interests. As well as blues and R&B, his compositions and covers have moved between pop music, jazz, rock, folk, country, gospel, Irish folk and traditional, big band, skiffle, rock and roll, new age, classical and sometimes spoken word ("Coney Island") and instrumentals.Hinton (1997), page 15. Morrison defines himself as a soul singer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mvremix.com/rock_blogs/2009/01/08/van-morrisons-astral-weeks-live-at-the-hollywood-bowl-chronicles-the-first-ever-live-performance-of-legendary-soul-singers-revered-1968-album/|publisher=mvremix.com|date=8 January 2009|title=Van Morrison's "Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl"|accessdate=29 May 2009[/tpl]
Some of Morrison's music has been classified in a genre of its own and referred to as "Celtic soul" or what biographer Brian Hinton referred to as a new alchemy called "Caledonian soul." Another biographer, Ritchie Yorke quoted Morrison as believing that he has "the spirit of Caledonia in his soul and his music reflects it."Yorke (1975), page 159. According to Yorke, Morrison claimed to have discovered "a certain quality of soul" when he first visited Scotland (his Belfast ancestors were of Ulster Scots descent) and Morrison has said he believes there is some connection between soul music and Caledonia. Yorke relates that Morrison "discovered several years after he first began composing music that some of his songs lent themselves to a unique major modal scale (without sevenths) which of course is the same scale as that used by bagpipe players and old Irish and Scottish folk music."

==Caledonia==

The name "Caledonia" has played a prominent role in Morrison's life and career. Biographer Ritchie Yorke had pointed out already by 1975 that Morrison has referred to Caledonia so many times in his career that he "seems to be obsessed with the word". In his 2009 biography, Erik Hage found that "Morrison seemed deeply interested in his paternal Scottish roots during his early career, and later in the ancient countryside of England, hence his repeated use of the term Caledonia (an ancient Roman name for Scotland/northern Britain)".Hage (2009), page 52 As well as being his daughter Shana's middle name, it is the name of his first production company, his studio, his publishing company, two of his backing groups, his parents' record store in Fairfax, California in the 1970s, and he also recorded a cover of the song "Caldonia" (with the name spelled "Caledonia") in 1974.Collis (1996), page134" Morrison used "Caledonia" in what has been called a quintessential Van Morrison moment in the song, "Listen to the Lion" with the lyrics, "And we sail, and we sail, way up to Caledonia".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2005/11/listening-to-old-voices-van-morrison.html|publisher=pastemagazine.com|author=Whitman, Andy|title=Listening to Old Voices: Van Morrison The Lion In Winter|date=14 November 2005|accessdate=17 January 2009[/tpl] As late as 2008, Morrison used "Caledonia" as a mantra in the live performance of the song, "Astral Weeks" recorded at the two Hollywood Bowl concerts.

==Influence==

Morrison's influence can readily be heard in the music of a diverse array of major artists and according to The Rolling Stone's Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll (Simon & Schuster, 2001), "his influence among rock singers/song writers is unrivaled by any living artist outside of that other prickly legend, Bob Dylan. Echoes of Morrison's rugged literateness and his gruff, feverish emotive vocals can be heard in latter day icons ranging from Bruce Springsteen to Elvis Costello". His influence includes U2 (Bono was quoted saying "I am in awe of a musician like Van Morrison. I had to stop listening to Van Morrison records about six months before we made The Unforgettable Fire because I didn't want his very original soul voice to overpower my own.");Bayles, Martha.

Overall, Morrison has typically been supportive of other artists, often willingly sharing the stage with them during his concerts. On the live album, A Night in San Francisco, he had as his special guests, among others, his childhood idols: Jimmy Witherspoon, John Lee Hooker and Junior Wells. Although he often expresses his displeasure (in interviews and songs) with the music industry and the media in general, he has been instrumental in promoting the careers of many other musicians and singers, such as James Hunter,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5364455|title=James Hunter in Concert|publisher=npr.org|accessdate=30 March 2007[/tpl] and fellow Belfast-born brothers, Brian and Bap Kennedy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.briankennedy.co.uk/biography.html|date=July 2006|title=Biography-Brian Kennedy|publisher=2006 briankennedy.co.uk|accessdate=30 March 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=65|title=My cultural life: Bap Kennedy|publisher=culturenorthernireland.org|accessdate=3 August 2009[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Morrison lived in Belfast from birth until 1967, when he moved to New York after signing with Bang Records. Facing deportation due to visa problems, he managed to stay in the US when his American girlfriend Janet (Planet) Rigsbee agreed to marry him.Heylin (2003), page 168. Once married, Morrison and his wife moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he found work performing in local clubs. The couple had one daughter, Shana Morrison, who has become a singer-songwriter. Morrison and his family moved around America, living in Boston; Woodstock, New York; and a hilltop home in Fairfax, California. His wife appeared on the cover of the album Tupelo Honey. They divorced in 1973.Heylin (2003), page 260.Rogan (2006), page 280.
Morrison moved back to Europe in the late 1970s, first settling in London's Notting Hill Gate area.Rogan (2006), page 342. Later, he moved to Bath, where he purchased Wool Hall Studios.Rogan (2006), page 400. He also has a home in the Irish seaside village of Dalkey near Dublin, where legal actions against two different neighbours concerning safety and privacy issues have been taken to court in 2001 and in 2010.Van gets 'no encore' for hardcore in driveway row with neighbours, Irish Independent, 1 December 2001.

==Legacy==

Morrison has received several major music awards in his career, including six Grammy Awards (1996–2007); inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (January 1993), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (June 2003), and the Irish Music Hall of Fame (September 1999); and a Brit Award (February 1994). In addition he has received civil awards of an OBE (June 1996) and an Officier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (1996), and he has honorary doctorates from the University of Ulster (1992) and Queen's University Belfast (July 2001).
