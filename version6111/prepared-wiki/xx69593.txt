The Peach Bowl (officially the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl, and simply as the Chick-fil-A Bowl from 2006 to 2013) is an annual college football bowl game played in Atlanta, Georgia since December 1968. The first three Peach Bowls were played at Grant Field on the Georgia Tech campus in Atlanta. Between 1971 and 1991, Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium hosted the game. Since 1992, the Georgia Dome has played host. The proposed New Falcons Stadium is planned to begin hosting the game in 2017. Seven of the first ten meetings (all but the 1968, 1971, and 1974 games) pitted an Atlantic Coast Conference team against an at-large opponent. From 1993 until 2013, the game has matched a Southeastern Conference team against one from the ACC. In 2005, the bowl hosted its first-ever matchup of top 10 ranked teams.
The game was originally created as a fund-raiser by the Lions Clubs of Georgia in 1968, but after years of lackluster attendance and revenue, the game was taken over by the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.
Chick-fil-A, based in nearby College Park, became the title sponsor of the event with the January 1998 game. Starting with the 2006 season, Chick-fil-A assumed complete naming rights to the game in a five year, $22 million, sponsorship deal, ending almost forty years of the Peach Bowl name. A new logo was unveiled April 6, 2006.
The funds from the deal were used to increase payouts for the participating teams. In response, the ACC gave the committee the first pick of its teams after the BCS since 2006--usually the loser of the ACC Championship Game or one of the division runners-up. The bowl currently has the fifth overall selection from the SEC (including the BCS).  However, the BCS has taken two SEC schools in every season since 2006, leaving the Chick-Fil-A with the sixth pick from the conference--usually one of the division runners-up. As of 2013, the bowl was sold out for 17 straight years, the second-longest streak behind only the Rose Bowl.http://www.chick-fil-abowl.com/PressBox/BowlNews/BowlNewsViewer/tabid/122/ArticleId/106/Chick-fil-A-Bowl-Achieves-Earliest-Sellout-in-its-History.aspx In 2007, the Chick-fil-A Bowl became the best-attended non-BCS bowl for the previous decade.
Starting with the 2014 season, the bowl will feature College Football Playoff matchups, with the 2016, 2019, 2022, and 2025 games hosting a national semifinal, with matchups in all years selected by the playoff selection committee.[tpl]cite web|url = http://auburntigers.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/120407aad.html|title = Auburn-Clemson Match-up Gives Chick-fil-A Bowl 11th Straight Sellout|accessdate = 2007-12-11|date = 2007-12-04|publisher = Auburn University[/tpl] In conjunction with its inclusion in the playoff system, the game's name was changed from Chick-fil-A Bowl to Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl on April 21, 2014.[tpl]cite web|title=Chick-fil-A Bowl will restore ‘Peach’ to its name|author=Tim Tucker|publisher=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=April 18, 2014|accessdate=April 20, 2014|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/college-football/chick-fil-a-bowl-will-restore-peach-to-its-name/nfcpT/[/tpl]

In October 2009, the bowl extended the Atlantic Coast Conference contract through 2013.  According to Sports Illustrated, although the bowl generated $12.3 million in profit in 2007, only $5.9 million of that was paid out to the participating schools.Murphy, Austin, and Dan Wetzel, "Does It Matter?", Sports Illustrated, 15 November 2010, p. 45. On December 31, 2012 the bowl set new records for viewership. The New Year’s Eve telecast – a 25-24 Clemson victory over LSU – averaged 8,557,000 viewers (a 5.6 household coverage rating), making it ESPN's most-viewed non-BCS bowl ever.[tpl]cite web|title=Viewership Increases for ESPN Bowl Games|url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2013/01/viewership-increases-for-espn-bowl-games/|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=13 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=NCAA Bowls: Clemson/LSU Hits Record-High on ESPN; Music City, Liberty Bowls Down|url=http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2013/01/ncaa-bowls-clemsonlsu-hits-record-high-on-espn-music-city-liberty-bowls-down/|publisher=Sports Media Watch|accessdate=13 January 2013[/tpl]
