The Division of Brisbane is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. The division was one of the original 75 divisions contested at the first federal election. It is named after the city of Brisbane.

==Boundaries==

On its original boundaries, Brisbane included all of what is now the northern part of the City of Brisbane, but successive boundary changes cut it back to the inner suburban area. 
It now extends from the city centre into the western suburbs, and includes Alderley, Ashgrove, Bowen Hills, Brisbane City, Clayfield, Enoggera, Ferny Grove, Fortitude Valley, Gaythorne, Grange, Herston, Kelvin Grove,  Keperra, Milton, Mitchelton, New Farm, Newmarket, Newstead, Red Hill, Spring Hill, Upper Kedron, Wilston, Windsor, parts of Bardon, Everton Park, Paddington and Stafford.
In the 2009 redistribution announced by the Australian Electoral Commission, the suburbs of Hendra, Ascot and Hamilton were included in the seat of Brisbane.
