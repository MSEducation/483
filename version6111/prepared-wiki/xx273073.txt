==Finding==

Sources of writing on the subject of the important manuscripts located in 1945, cite the writings as the Nag Hammadi manuscripts. Accounts of the findings state that  manuscripts were either found at Nag Hammadi or "at Chenoboskion near  Nag Hammadi", although the definite choice by the scholars responsible seems largely to be that they are to be known by the former rather than the latter. If explanation is needed then, the choice of title is perhaps a matter of convention supported by the principal members of those responsible for the initial tasks presented by the findings, rather than a definite corresponding choice made necessary by a strictly defined event known to have occurred  at a strictly defined location.J.D.
