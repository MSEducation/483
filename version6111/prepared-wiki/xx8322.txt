The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO; [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|n|eɪ|t|oʊ[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-fr|link=no|Organisation du traité de l'Atlantique Nord (OTAN)[/tpl]), also called the (North) Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party. NATO's headquarters are in Brussels, Belgium, one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total.[tpl]cite web|url=http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |title=The SIPRI Military Expenditure Database |publisher=Milexdata.sipri.org |accessdate=22 August 2010[/tpl] Members' defense spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP.[tpl]Cite news |last = Erlanger |first = Steven |date = 26 March 2014 |title = Europe Begins to Rethink Cuts to Military Spending |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/27/world/europe/europe-begins-to-rethink-cuts.html |work = nytimes.com |accessdate = 3 April 2014 |quote = Last year, only a handful of NATO countries met the target, according to NATO figures, including the United States, at 4.1 percent, and Britain, at 2.4 percent. [/tpl]
NATO was little more than a political association until the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two U.S. supreme commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, which formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion—doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of the French from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the organization was drawn into the breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. Politically, the organization sought better relations with former Warsaw Pact countries, several of which joined the alliance in 1999 and 2004.
Article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty, requiring member states to come to the aid of any member state subject to an armed attack, was invoked for the first and only time after the 11 September 2001 attacks,[tpl]cite web |title=Invocation of Article 5 confirmed |url=http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2001/1001/e1002a.htm |work=North Atlantic Treaty Organization |accessdate=January 29, 2013[/tpl] after which troops were deployed to Afghanistan under the NATO-led ISAF.

==History==

===Beginnings===

The Treaty of Brussels, signed on 17 March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, is considered the precursor to the NATO agreement. The treaty and the Soviet Berlin Blockade led to the creation of the Western European Union's Defence Organization in September 1948.[tpl]sfn|Isby|Kamps Jr.|1985|p=13[/tpl] However, participation of the United States was thought necessary both to counter the military power of the USSR and to prevent the revival of nationalist militarism, so talks for a new military alliance began almost immediately resulting in the North Atlantic Treaty, which was signed in Washington, D.C. on 4 April 1949. It included the five Treaty of Brussels states plus the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/history/nato-history.html |title= A short history of NATO |publisher= NATO |date= 2 April 2012 |accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl] The first NATO Secretary General, Lord Ismay, stated in 1949 that the organization's goal was "to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down."[tpl]sfn|Reynolds|1994|p=13[/tpl] Popular support for the Treaty was not unanimous, and some Icelanders participated in a pro-neutrality, anti-membership riot in March 1949. The creation of NATO can be seen as the primary institutional consequence of a school of thought called Atlanticism which stressed the importance of trans-Atlantic cooperation.[tpl]cite journal|last=Straus|first=Ira|title=Atlanticism as the core 20 th century U.S. strategy for internationalism|journal=Streit Council|date=June 2005|series=Annual Meeting of the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations|url=http://streitcouncil.org/uploads/PDF/Straus-%20Atlanticism%20as%20the%20core%2020th%20century%20US%20Strategy%20for%20internationalism.pdf|accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl]
The members agreed that an armed attack against any one of them in Europe or North America would be considered an attack against them all. Consequently they agreed that, if an armed attack occurred, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence, would assist the member being attacked, taking such action as it deemed necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. The treaty does not require members to respond with military action against an aggressor. Although obliged to respond, they maintain the freedom to choose the method by which they do so. This differs from Article IV of the Treaty of Brussels, which clearly states that the response will be military in nature. It is nonetheless assumed that NATO members will aid the attacked member militarily. The treaty was later clarified to include both the member's territory and their "vessels, forces or aircraft" above the Tropic of Cancer, including some Overseas departments of France.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17245.htm |title= Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty on the Accession of Greece and Turkey |work= NATO |date= 4 April 1949 |accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl]
The creation of NATO brought about some standardization of allied military terminology, procedures, and technology, which in many cases meant European countries adopting U.S. practices. The roughly 1300 Standardization Agreements (STANAG) codified many of the common practices that NATO has achieved. Hence, the 7.62×51 NATO rifle cartridge was introduced in the 1950s as a standard firearm cartridge among many NATO countries. Fabrique Nationale de Herstal's FAL, which used 7.62 NATO cartridge, was adopted by 75 countries, including many outside of NATO.[tpl]sfn|Willbanks|2004|pp=129–130[/tpl] Also, aircraft marshalling signals were standardized, so that any NATO aircraft could land at any NATO base. Other standards such as the NATO phonetic alphabet have made their way beyond NATO into civilian use.

===Cold War===

The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 was crucial for NATO as it raised the apparent threat of all Communist countries working together, and forced the alliance to develop concrete military plans.[tpl]sfn|Isby|Kamps Jr.|1985|pp=13–14[/tpl] SHAPE, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, was formed as a consolidated command structure, and began work under Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower in January 1951.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/4.htm |title= NATO the first five years 1949-1954 |first= Hastings |last= Ismay |authorlink= Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay |publisher= NATO |date= 4 September 2001 |accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl] The 1952 Lisbon conference, seeking to provide the forces necessary for NATO's Long-Term Defence Plan, called for an expansion to ninety-six divisions. However this requirement was dropped the following year to roughly thirty-five divisions with heavier use to be made of nuclear weapons. At this time, NATO could call on about fifteen ready divisions in Central Europe, and another ten in Italy and Scandinavia.[tpl]sfn|Osgood|1962|p=76[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Park|1986|p=28[/tpl] Also at Lisbon, the post of Secretary General of NATO as the organization's chief civilian was created, and Lord Ismay was eventually appointed to the post.[tpl]cite news |work= Time |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,816183,00.html |title= NATO: The Man with the Oilcan |date= 24 March 1952 |accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl]
In September 1952, the first major NATO maritime exercises began; Exercise Mainbrace brought together 200 ships and over 50,000 personnel to practice the defence of Denmark and Norway.[tpl]cite journal |last=Baldwin |first=Hanson |date= 28 September 1952 |title=Navies Meet the Test in Operation Mainbrace |journal=New York Times |pages=E7  |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20711FF3A5B117A93CAAB1782D85F468585F9 |accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl] Other major exercises that followed included Exercise Grand Slam and Exercise Longstep, naval and amphibious exercises in the Mediterranean Sea, Italic Weld, a combined air-naval-ground exercise in northern Italy, Grand Repulse, involving the British Army on the Rhine (BAOR), the Netherlands Corps and Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AAFCE), Monte Carlo, a simulated atomic air-ground exercise involving the Central Army Group, and Weldfast, a combined amphibious landing exercise in the Mediterranean Sea involving British, Greek, Italian, Turkish, and U.S. naval forces.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/9.htm |title= The increase in strength |publisher= NATO |date= 17 September 2001 |accessdate = 4 September 2013 |first= Hastings |last= Ismay |authorlink= Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay |work= NATO the first five years 1949-1954[/tpl]
Greece and Turkey also joined the alliance in 1952, forcing a series of controversial negotiations, in which the United States and Britain were the primary disputants, over how to bring the two countries into the military command structure. While this overt military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion, including Operation Gladio, were transferred to NATO control. Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the NATO Tiger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.natotigers.org/tigerassociation/index.php |title= Organisation |work= NATO Tiger Association |accessdate= 4 September 2013 |year= 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://canadianarmytrophy.com/ |title= Historical Overview |work= Canadian Army Trophy |date= 5 October 2012 |accessdate= 4 September 2013[/tpl]
In 1954, the Soviet Union suggested that it should join NATO to preserve peace in Europe.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2009/04/03/f-nato-fast-facts.html |date= 6 April 2009 |title=Fast facts about NATO |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=16 July 2011[/tpl] The NATO countries, fearing that the Soviet Union's motive was to weaken the alliance, ultimately rejected this proposal. The incorporation of West Germany into the organization on 9 May 1955 was described as "a decisive turning point in the history of our continent" by Halvard Lange, Foreign Affairs Minister of Norway at the time.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/9/newsid_2519000/2519979.stm |title= West Germany accepted into Nato |work=BBC News |date= 9 May 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl] A major reason for Germany's entry into the alliance was that without German manpower, it would have been impossible to field enough conventional forces to resist a Soviet invasion.[tpl]sfn|Isby|Kamps Jr.|1985|p=15[/tpl] One of its immediate results was the creation of the Warsaw Pact, which was signed on 14 May 1955 by the Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and East Germany, as a formal response to this event, thereby delineating the two opposing sides of the Cold War.
Three major exercises were held concurrently in the northern autumn of 1957. Operation Counter Punch, Operation Strikeback, and Operation Deep Water were the most ambitious military undertaking for the alliance to date, involving more than 250,000 men, 300 ships, and 1,500 aircraft operating from Norway to Turkey.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891351,00.html |title=Emergency Call |accessdate=27 September 2008 |work= Time |date= 30 September 1957[/tpl]

===French withdrawal===

NATO's unity was breached early in its history with a crisis occurring during Charles de Gaulle's presidency of France. De Gaulle protested the United States' strong role in the organization and what he perceived as a special relationship between it and the United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 17 September 1958, he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the US and the UK.[tpl]sfn|Wenger|Nuenlist|Locher|2007|pp=67–69[/tpl]
Considering the response he received to his memorandum unsatisfactory, de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country. He wanted to give France, in the event of an East German incursion into West Germany, the option of coming to a separate peace with the Eastern bloc instead of being drawn into a larger NATO-Warsaw Pact war.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-215_162-3334439.html |title= Not Enough NATO In Afghanistan |work= CBS News |date= 22 September 2009 |accessdate= 4 September 2013 |first= Alan |last= Dowd[/tpl] In February 1959, France withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command.[tpl]sfn|National Defense University|1997|p=50[/tpl] He later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on French soil. This caused the United States to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of France and return control of the air force bases that had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967.
Though France showed solidarity with the rest of NATO during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, de Gaulle continued his pursuit of an independent defence by removing France's Atlantic and Channel fleets from NATO command.[tpl]sfn|van der Eyden|2003|pp=104–106[/tpl] In 1966, all French armed forces were removed from NATO's integrated military command, and all non-French NATO troops were asked to leave France. U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk was later quoted as asking de Gaulle whether his order included "the bodies of American soldiers in France's cemeteries?"[tpl]sfn|Schoenbaum|1988|p=421[/tpl] This withdrawal forced the relocation of SHAPE from Rocquencourt, near Paris, to Casteau, north of Mons, Belgium, by 16 October 1967.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2007/issue2/english/history.html |title= The Big Move |work= NATO Review |first= François |last= Le Blévennec |date= 25 October 2011 |accessdate=19 December 2011[/tpl] France remained a member of the alliance, and committed to the defence of Europe from possible Warsaw Pact attack with its own forces stationed in the Federal Republic of Germany throughout the Cold War. A series of secret accords between US and French officials, the Lemnitzer-Ailleret Agreements, detailed how French forces would dovetail back into NATO's command structure should East-West hostilities break out.[tpl]cite news |work=The Washington Post |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/11/AR2009031100547.html |title= After 43 Years, France to Rejoin NATO as Full Member |date= 12 March 2009 |first= Edward |last= Cody |accessdate=19 December 2011[/tpl]

===Détente and escalation===

During most of the Cold War, NATO's watch against the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact did not actually lead to direct military action. On 1 July 1968, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty opened for signature: NATO argued that its nuclear sharing arrangements did not breach the treaty as US forces controlled the weapons until a decision was made to go to war, at which point the treaty would no longer be controlling. Few states knew of the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements at that time, and they were not challenged. In May 1978, NATO countries officially defined two complementary aims of the Alliance, to maintain security and pursue détente. This was supposed to mean matching defences at the level rendered necessary by the Warsaw Pact's offensive capabilities without spurring a further arms race.[tpl]sfn|Garthoff|1994|pp=659–661[/tpl]
On 12 December 1979, in light of a build-up of Warsaw Pact nuclear capabilities in Europe, ministers approved the deployment of US GLCM cruise missiles and Pershing II theatre nuclear weapons in Europe. The new warheads were also meant to strengthen the western negotiating position regarding nuclear disarmament. This policy was called the Dual Track policy.[tpl]sfn|Njølstad|2004|pp=280–282[/tpl] Similarly, in 1983–84, responding to the stationing of Warsaw Pact SS-20 medium-range missiles in Europe, NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles tasked to hit military targets such as tank formations in the event of war.[tpl]sfn|Njølstad|2004|pp=278–279[/tpl] This action led to peace movement protests throughout Western Europe, and support for the deployment wavered as many doubted whether the push for deployment could be sustained.
The membership of the organization at this time remained largely static. In 1974, as a consequence of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, Greece withdrew its forces from NATO's military command structure but, with Turkish cooperation, were readmitted in 1980. The Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina did not result in NATO involvement because of the limited scope of NATO.[tpl]sfn|Kaplan|2004|pp=89–91[/tpl] On 30 May 1982, NATO gained a new member when, following a referendum, the newly democratic Spain joined the alliance. At the peak of the Cold War, 16 member nations maintained an approximate strength of 5,252,800 active military, including as many as 435,000 forward deployed U.S. forces, under a command structure that reached a peak of 78 headquarters, organized into four echelons.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA532510 |title= NATO Command Structure: Considerations for the Future |first1= W.

===After the Cold War===

The Revolutions of 1989 and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1991 removed the de facto main adversary of NATO and caused a strategic re-evaluation of NATO's purpose, nature, tasks, and their focus on the continent of Europe. This shift started with the 1990 signing in Paris of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe between NATO and the Soviet Union, which mandated specific military reductions across the continent that continued after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jul/15/russia.nato |title= Kremlin tears up arms pact with Nato |first= Luke |last= Harding |work=The Observer |date= 14 July 2007 |accessdate=1 May 2012[/tpl] At that time, European countries accounted for 34% of NATO's military spending; by 2012, this had fallen to 21%.[tpl]cite journal |url= http://www.economist.com/node/21551491 |title= The future of NATO: Bad timing |date= 31 March 2012 |journal= The Economist |accessdate=3 April 2012 [/tpl] NATO also began a gradual expansion to include newly autonomous Eastern European nations, and extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns.
The first post-Cold War expansion of NATO came with German reunification on 3 October 1990, when the former East Germany became part of the Federal Republic of Germany and the alliance. This had been agreed in the Two Plus Four Treaty earlier in the year. To secure Soviet approval of a united Germany remaining in NATO, it was agreed that foreign troops and nuclear weapons would not be stationed in the east, and there are diverging view on whether negotiators gave commitments regarding further NATO expansion east. Jack Matlock, U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union during its final years, said that the West gave a "clear commitment" not to expand, and declassified documents indicate that Soviet negotiators were given the impression that NATO membership was off the table for countries such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, or Poland.[tpl]Cite news |last1 = Klussmann |first1 = Uwe |last2 = Schepp |first2 = Matthias |last3 = Wiegrefe |first3 = Klaus |date = 26 November 2009 |title = NATO's Eastward Expansion: Did the West Break Its Promise to Moscow? |url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nato-s-eastward-expansion-did-the-west-break-its-promise-to-moscow-a-663315.html |work = Spiegel Online |accessdate = 7 April 2014 [/tpl] In May 2008, Gorbachev repeated his view that "the Americans promised that NATO wouldn't move beyond the boundaries of Germany after the Cold War."[tpl]cite news |title = Gorbachev: US could start new Cold War |author=Blomfield A and Smith M |location=Paris |date=6 May 2009 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1933223/Gorbachev-US-could-start-new-Cold-War.html |publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=22 May 2009[/tpl] According to Robert Zoellick, a State Department official involved in the Two Plus Four negotiating process, this appears to be a misperception, and no formal commitment regarding enlargement was made.[tpl]cite news |first=Robert B. |last=Zoellick |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-65576869.html |title=The Lessons of German Unification |publisher=The National Interest |date=22 September 2000[/tpl]
As part of post-Cold War restructuring, NATO's military structure was cut back and reorganized, with new forces such as the Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps established. The changes brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union on the military balance in Europe were recognized in the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, which was signed in 1999. The policies of French President Nicolas Sarkozy resulted in a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4 April 2009, which also included France rejoining the integrated military command of NATO, while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.[tpl]cite news |title=Sarkozy military plan unveiled |last=Stratton |first=Allegra |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jun/17/france.military |work=The Guardian  |location=UK |date=17 June 2008 [/tpl]

===Enlargement and reform===

Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, like the Partnership for Peace, the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. In 1998, the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council was established. On 8 July 1997, three former communist countries, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland, were invited to join NATO, which each did in 1999.  Membership went on expanding with the accession of seven more Northern and Eastern European countries to NATO: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. They were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit, and joined NATO on 29 March 2004, shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit. In Istanbul, NATO launched the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative with four Persian Gulf nations.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/history/index.html |title= History |publisher= NATO |date= 15 December 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2012[/tpl]
New NATO structures were also formed while old ones were abolished. In 1997, NATO reached agreement on a significant downsizing of its command structure from 65 headquarters to just 20.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/1997/s971216aa.htm |title= Statement by Secretary of State Madeleine K.

On 19 June 2003, a further restructuring of the NATO military commands began as the Headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic were abolished and a new command, Allied Command Transformation (ACT), was established in Norfolk, Virginia, United States, and the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) became the Headquarters of Allied Command Operations (ACO). ACT is responsible for driving transformation (future capabilities) in NATO, whilst ACO is responsible for current operations.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_52091.htm |title= Allied Command Operations (ACO) |work= NATO |date= 10 May 2013 |accessdate= 4 September 2013[/tpl] In March 2004, NATO's Baltic Air Policing began, which supported the sovereignty of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia by providing fighters to react to any unwanted aerial intrusions.

==Military operations==

===Early operations===

No military operations were conducted by NATO during the Cold War. Following the end of the Cold War, the first operations, Anchor Guard in 1990 and Ace Guard in 1991, were prompted by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Airborne Early Warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of South Eastern Turkey, and later a quick-reaction force was deployed to the area.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.aco.nato.int/resources/21/NATO%20Operations,%201949-Present.pdf | title=NATO’s Operations 1949 - Present | publisher=NATO | year=2009 | accessdate=March 3, 2013[/tpl]

===Bosnia and Herzegovina intervention===

The Bosnian War began in 1992, as a result of the Breakup of Yugoslavia. The deteriorating situation led to United Nations Security Council Resolution 816 on 9 October 1992, ordering a no-fly zone over central Bosnia and Herzegovina, which NATO began enforcing on 12 April 1993 with Operation Deny Flight. From June 1993 until October 1996, Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28 February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the no-fly zone.[tpl]sfn|Zenko|2010|pp=133–134[/tpl]
On 10 and 11 April 1994, during the Bosnian War, the United Nations Protection Force called in air strikes to protect the Goražde safe area, resulting in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Goražde by two US F-16 jets acting under NATO direction.[tpl]sfn|Zenko|2010|p=134[/tpl] This resulted in the taking of 150 U.N. personnel hostage on 14 April.[tpl]citation|title=NATO Handbook: Evolution of the Conflict|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2001/hb050102.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011107101023/http://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2001/hb050102.htm|archivedate=November 7, 2001[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://articles.philly.com/1995-05-31/news/25674772_1_bosnian-serbs-bosnian-government-bosnian-war |title= U.N.

NATO air strikes that year helped bring the Yugoslav wars to an end, resulting in the Dayton Agreement in November 1995. As part of this agreement, NATO deployed a UN-mandated peacekeeping force, under Operation Joint Endeavor, named IFOR. Almost 60,000 NATO troops were joined by forces from non-NATO nations in this peacekeeping mission. This transitioned into the smaller SFOR, which started with 32,000 troops initially and ran from December 1996 until December 2004, when operations where then passed onto European Union Force Althea.[tpl]sfn|Clausson|2006|p=94–97[/tpl] Following the lead of its member nations, NATO began to award a service medal, the NATO Medal, for these operations.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/02/army_natomedal_022209w/ |title= Thousands more now eligible for NATO Medal |work= Army Times |first= Jim |last= Tice |date= 22 February 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2012[/tpl]

===Kosovo intervention===

In an effort to stop Slobodan Milošević's Serbian-led crackdown on Albanian civilians in Kosovo, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1199 on 23 September 1998 to demand a ceasefire. Negotiations under UN Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke broke down on 23 March 1999, and he handed the matter to NATO, which started a 78-day bombing campaign on 24 March 1999.[tpl]cite news |title= UN Kosovo mission walks a tightrope |date= 24 March 2004 |work=BBC News |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3565799.stm |first= Nick |last= Thorpe |accessdate=11 April 2012[/tpl] Operation Allied Force targeted the military capabilities of what was then the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

Though the campaign was criticized for high civilian casualties, including bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Milošević finally accepted the terms of an international peace plan on 3 June 1999, ending the Kosovo War. On 11 June, Milošević further accepted UN resolution 1244, under the mandate of which NATO then helped establish the KFOR peacekeeping force. Nearly one million refugees had fled Kosovo, and part of KFOR's mandate was to protect the humanitarian missions, in addition to deterring violence.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/media-releases/2000/kosovo-report-card.aspx |title= Kosovo Report Card |date= 28 August 2000 |work= International Crisis Group |accessdate=11 April 2012[/tpl] In August–September 2001, the alliance also mounted Operation Essential Harvest, a mission disarming ethnic Albanian militias in the Republic of Macedonia.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/macedonia/1357773/Macedonia-mission-a-success-says-Nato.html |title= Macedonia mission a success, says Nato |work=The Daily Telegraph  |first= Toby |last= Helm |date= 27 September 2001 |accessdate=11 April 2012[/tpl] [tpl]as of|2012|11|30[/tpl], 5,565 KFOR soldiers continue to operate in the area.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/kfor/structur/nations/placemap/kfor_placemat.pdf |title= NATO Kosovo Force (KFOR) |publisher= NATO |format= PDF |date= 30 November 2012 |accessdate=30 March 2014[/tpl]
The US, the UK, and most other NATO countries opposed efforts to require the U.N. Security Council to approve NATO military strikes, such as the action against Serbia in 1999, while France and some others claimed that the alliance needed UN approval.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9904/24/nato.un/ |title= NATO reaffirms power to take action without U.N. approval |work= CNN |date= 24 April 1999 |accessdate= 4 September 2013[/tpl] The US/UK side claimed that this would undermine the authority of the alliance, and they noted that Russia and China would have exercised their Security Council vetoes to block the strike on Yugoslavia, and could do the same in future conflicts where NATO intervention was required, thus nullifying the entire potency and purpose of the organization. Recognizing the post-Cold War military environment, NATO adopted the Alliance Strategic Concept during its Washington summit in April 1999 that emphasized conflict prevention and crisis management.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2001/hb120704.htm |title= Allied Command Atlantic |accessdate=3 September 2008 |work=NATO Handbook |publisher=NATO |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813225955/http://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2001/hb120704.htm  |archivedate=13 August 2008[/tpl]

===Afghanistan War===

The September 11th attacks in the United States caused NATO to invoke Article 5 of the NATO Charter for the first time in the organization's history. The Article says that an attack on any member shall be considered to be an attack on all. The invocation was confirmed on 4 October 2001 when NATO determined that the attacks were indeed eligible under the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2001/1001/e1002a.htm |title=NATO Update: Invocation of Article 5 confirmed – 2 October 2001 |publisher=Nato.int |accessdate=22 August 2010[/tpl] The eight official actions taken by NATO in response to the attacks included Operation Eagle Assist and Operation Active Endeavour, a naval operation in the Mediterranean Sea and is designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction as well as to enhance the security of shipping in general which began on 4 October 2001.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.aco.nato.int/resources/21/NATO%20Operations,%201949-Present.pdf |title= NATO's Operations 1949-Present |work= NATO |date= 22 January 2010 |accessdate= 4 September 2013 |format= PDF[/tpl]
The alliance showed unity: on 16 April 2003, NATO agreed to take command of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), which includes troops from 42 countries. The decision came at the request of Germany and the Netherlands, the two nations leading ISAF at the time of the agreement, and all nineteen NATO ambassadors approved it unanimously. The handover of control to NATO took place on 11 August, and marked the first time in NATO's history that it took charge of a mission outside the north Atlantic area.David P. Auerswald, and Stephen M. Saideman, eds. NATO in Afghanistan: Fighting Together, Fighting Alone (Princeton U.P., 2014)
ISAF was initially charged with securing Kabul and surrounding areas from the Taliban, al Qaeda and factional warlords, so as to allow for the establishment of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai. In October 2003, the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/isaf/topics/mandate/unscr/resolution_1510.pdf |title=UNSC Resolution 1510, October 13, 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=5 July 2010[/tpl] and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/isaf/topics/chronology/index.html |title=ISAF Chronology |publisher=Nato.int |accessdate=5 July 2010[/tpl]

===Iraq training mission===

In August 2004, during the Iraq War, NATO formed the NATO Training Mission – Iraq, a training mission to assist the Iraqi security forces in conjunction with the US led MNF-I.Official Website The NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) was established at the request of the Iraqi Interim Government under the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546. The aim of NTM-I was to assist in the development of Iraqi security forces training structures and institutions so that Iraq can build an effective and sustainable capability that addresses the needs of the nation. NTM-I was not a combat mission but is a distinct mission, under the political control of NATO's North Atlantic Council. Its operational emphasis was on training and mentoring. The activities of the mission were coordinated with Iraqi authorities and the US-led Deputy Commanding General Advising and Training, who is also dual-hatted as the Commander of NTM-I. The mission officially concluded on 17 December 2011.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/17/us-iraq-withdrawal-nato-idUSTRE7BG0IK20111217 |title= NATO closes up training mission in Iraq |agency=Reuters |first= Rania |last= El Gamal |date= 17 December 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl]

===Gulf of Aden anti-piracy===

Beginning on 17 August 2009, NATO deployed warships in an operation to protect maritime traffic in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean from Somali pirates, and help strengthen the navies and coast guards of regional states. The operation was  approved by the North Atlantic Council and involves warships primarily from the United States though vessels from many other nations are also included. Operation Ocean Shield focuses on protecting the ships of Operation Allied Provider which are distributing aid as part of the World Food Programme mission in Somalia. Russia, China and South Korea have sent warships to participate in the activities as well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.manw.nato.int/page_operation_ocean_shield.aspx |title=Operation Ocean Shield |publisher=NATO |accessdate=3 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.manw.nato.int/page_news_archive_OOS_%202010.aspx |title=2009 Operation Ocean Shield News Articles |publisher=NATO |date= October 2010 |accessdate=19 May 2011[/tpl]

===Libya intervention===

During the Libyan civil war, violence between protestors and the Libyan government under Colonel Muammar Gaddafi escalated, and on 17 March 2011 led to the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which called for a ceasefire, and authorized military action to protect civilians. A coalition that included several NATO members began enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya shortly afterwards. On 20 March 2011, NATO states agreed on enforcing an arms embargo against Libya with Operation Unified Protector using ships from NATO Standing Maritime Group 1 and Standing Mine Countermeasures Group 1,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-E403D555-2A5EEC9A/natolive/news_71689.htm?mode=pressrelease|title=Statement by the NATO Secretary General on Libya arms embargo|publisher=NATO|date=22 March 2011 [/tpl] and additional ships and submarines from NATO members.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-83A5384E-C37D94AC/natolive/opinions_71716.htm?selectedLocale=en|title=Press briefing by NATO Spokesperson Oana Lungescu, Brigadier General Pierre St-Amand, Canadian Air Force and General Massimo Panizzi, spokesperson of the Chairman of the Military Committee|publisher=NATO|date=23 March 2011[/tpl] They would "monitor, report and, if needed, interdict vessels suspected of carrying illegal arms or mercenaries".

===Enlargement===

New membership in the alliance has been largely from Eastern Europe and the Balkans, including former members of the Warsaw Pact. Their accession to the alliance is governed with individual Membership Action Plans, and will require approval by each current member. NATO currently has three candidate countries that are in the process of joining the alliance: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and the Republic of Macedonia.In NATO official statements, the country is always referred to as the "former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, with a footnote stating that "Turkey recognizes the Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name"; see Macedonia naming dispute Though Macedonia completed its requirements for membership at the same time as Croatia and Albania, NATO's most recent members, its accession was blocked by Greece pending a resolution of the Macedonia naming dispute.[tpl]cite news |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/14/business/macedonia-prime-minister-greece/ |title= Macedonian PM: Greece is avoiding talks over name dispute |first= Oliver |last= Joy |work= CNN |date= 16 January 2014 |accessdate= 18 April 2014[/tpl] In order to support each other in the process, new and potential members in that region formed the Adriatic Charter in 2003.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/12/09/feature-02 |title= Montenegro, BiH join Adriatic Charter |date=12 September 2008 |first= Jusuf |last= Ramadanovic |coauthors= Nedjeljko Rudovic |work=Southeast European Times |accessdate=24 March 2009[/tpl] Georgia is also an aspiring member, and was promised "future membership" during the 2008 summit in Bucharest,[tpl]cite journal |author=George J, Teigen JM |year=2008 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a907490331~db=all?jumptype=alert |title=NATO Enlargement and Institution Building: Military Personnel Policy Challenges in the Post-Soviet Context |journal=European Security |volume=17 |issue=2 |page=346 |doi=10.1080/09662830802642512[/tpl] although, in 2014, US President Barack Obama said the country was not "currently on a path" to membership.[tpl]Cite news |last = Cathcourt |first = Will |date = 27 March 2014 |title = Obama Tells Georgia to Forget About NATO After Encouraging It to Join |url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/27/obama-tells-georgia-to-forget-about-nato-after-encouraging-it-to-join.html |work = The Daily Beast |accessdate = 15 April 2014 [/tpl]

The Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme was established in 1994 and is based on individual bilateral relations between each partner country and NATO: each country may choose the extent of its participation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/issues/pfp/index.html |title=Partnership for Peace |publisher=Nato.int |accessdate=3 March 2011[/tpl] Members include all current and former members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ru.forsecurity.org/nato-and-belarus-partnership-past-tensions-and-future-possibilities |title=Nato and Belarus – partnership, past tensions and future possibilities |publisher=Foreign Policy and Security Research Center |accessdate=25 November 2010[/tpl] The Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) was first established on 29 May 1997, and is a forum for regular coordination, consultation and dialogue between all fifty participants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49276.htm |title=NATO Topics: The Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council |publisher=Nato.int |accessdate=22 August 2010[/tpl]  The PfP programme is considered the operational wing of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership. Other third countries also have been contacted for participation in some activities of the PfP framework such as Afghanistan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/basictxt/b060906e.htm |title=Declaration by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan |publisher=Nato.int |accessdate=22 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908042229/http://www.nato.int/docu/basictxt/b060906e.htm  |archivedate=8 September 2010[/tpl]
The European Union (EU) signed a comprehensive package of arrangements with NATO under the Berlin Plus agreement on 16 December 2002. With this agreement the EU was given the possibility to use NATO assets in case it wanted to act independently in an international crisis, on the condition that NATO itself did not want to act—the so-called "right of first refusal."Bram Boxhoorn, Broad Support for NATO in the Netherlands, 21 September 2005, [tpl]Wayback |date=20070218090444 |url=http://www.ataedu.org/article_new.php?id=107 |title=ATAedu.org [/tpl] It provides a "double framework" for the EU countries that are also linked with the PfP programme. Additionally, NATO cooperates and discusses their activities with numerous other non-NATO members. The Mediterranean Dialogue was established in 1994 to coordinate in a similar way with Israel and countries in North Africa. The Istanbul Cooperation Initiative was announced in 2004 as a dialog forum for the Middle East along the same lines as the Mediterranean Dialogue. The four participants are also linked through the Gulf Cooperation Council.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-4CA2943D-E00ED2BF/natolive/51288.htm |title=NATO Partner countries |publisher=Nato.int |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=15 June 2011[/tpl]
Political dialogue with Japan began in 1990, and since then, the Alliance has gradually increased its contact with countries that do not form part of any of these cooperation initiatives.NATO, Relations with Contact Countries. Retrieved January 29, 2013. In 1998, NATO established a set of general guidelines that do not allow for a formal institutionalization of relations, but reflect the Allies' desire to increase cooperation. Following extensive debate, the term "Contact Countries" was agreed by the Allies in 2000. By 2012, the Alliance had broadened this group, which meets to discuss issues such as counter-piracy and technology exchange, under the names "partners across the globe" or "global partners."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d101015.pdf|title=NATO PARTNERSHIPS: DOD Needs to Assess U.S. Assistance in Response to Changes to the Partnership for Peace Program|work=United States Government Accountability Office|date=September 2010|first=|last=|accessdate=27 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/51288.htm |title= Partners |publisher= NATO |date= 2 April 2012 |accessdate= 12 October 2012[/tpl] Australia and New Zealand, both contact counties, are also members of the AUSCANNZUKUS strategic alliance, and similar regional or bilateral agreements between contact countries and NATO members also aid cooperation.

==Structures==

The main headquarters of NATO is located on Boulevard Léopold III/Leopold III-laan, B-1110 Brussels, which is in Haren, part of the City of Brussels municipality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/|title=NATO homepage|accessdate=12 March 2006[/tpl] A new headquarters building is, [tpl]as of|2010|lc=on[/tpl], under construction nearby, due for completion by 2015.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-8B0474DB-C84BF8E1/natolive/news_69421.htm?selectedLocale=en |title=Work starts on new NATO Headquarters |author=NATO |date=16 December 2010 |publisher=NATO |accessdate=25 March 2011[/tpl] The design is an adaptation of the original award-winning scheme designed by Michel Mossessian and his team when he was a Design Partner with Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.europe.org.uk/index/-/id/426/ |title=Michel Mossessian talks to Lucy Lethbridge |author=European Council | accessdate=12 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725025703/http://www.europe.org.uk/index/-/id/426/  |archivedate=25 July 2011[/tpl]
The staff at the Headquarters is composed of national delegations of member countries and includes civilian and military liaison offices and officers or diplomatic missions and diplomats of partner countries, as well as the International Staff and International Military Staff filled from serving members of the armed forces of member states.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49284.htm |title=NATO Headquarters |publisher=Nato.int |date=10 August 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010[/tpl] Non-governmental citizens' groups have also grown up in support of NATO, broadly under the banner of the Atlantic Council/Atlantic Treaty Association movement.

===NATO Council===

Like any alliance, NATO is ultimately governed by its 28 member states. However, the North Atlantic Treaty and other agreements outline how decisions are to be made within NATO. Each of the 28 members sends a delegation or mission to NATO's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.[tpl]cite web | title = National delegations to NATO What is their role? | publisher=NATO | date = 18 June 2007 | url = http://www.nato.int/issues/national_delegations/tasks.html | accessdate =15 July 2007 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070714120337/http://www.nato.int/issues/national_delegations/tasks.html  | archivedate =14 July 2007 [/tpl] The senior permanent member of each delegation is known as the Permanent Representative and is generally a senior civil servant or an experienced ambassador (and holding that diplomatic rank). Several countries have diplomatic missions to NATO through embassies in Belgium.
Together, the Permanent Members form the North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets together at least once a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, it is worth noting that the Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.
The meetings of the North Atlantic Council are chaired by the Secretary General of NATO and, when decisions have to be made, action is agreed upon on the basis of unanimity and common accord. There is no voting or decision by majority. Each nation represented at the Council table or on any of its subordinate committees retains complete sovereignty and responsibility for its own decisions.

===NATO Parliamentary Assembly===

The body that sets broad strategic goals for NATO is the NATO Parliamentary Assembly (NATO-PA) which meets at the Annual Session, and one other during the year, and is the organ that directly interacts with the parliamentary structures of the national governments of the member states which appoint Permanent Members, or ambassadors to NATO. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly is made up of legislators from the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance as well as thirteen associate members. Karl A. Lamers, German Deputy Chairman of the Defence Committee of the Bundestag and a member of the Christian Democratic Union, became president of the assembly in 2010.Press Statement: German MP Karl A. Lamers elected President of NATO PA. NATO Parliamentary Assembly, 16 November 2010 It is however officially a different structure from NATO, and has as aim to join together deputies of NATO countries in order to discuss security policies on the NATO Council.
The Assembly is the political integration body of NATO that generates political policy agenda setting for the NATO Council via reports of its five committees:
These reports provide impetus and direction as agreed upon by the national governments of the member states through their own national political processes and influencers to the NATO administrative and executive organizational entities.

===Military structures===

NATO's military operations are directed by the Chairman of the NATO Military Committee, and split into two Strategic Commands commanded by a senior US officer and a senior French officer[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.act.nato.int/organization/hq-sact/whos-who/300-supreme-allied-commander-transformation |title=General Stéphane Abrial, French Air Force, assumed duties as Supreme Allied Commander Transformation in summer 2009 |publisher=Act.nato.int |date=29 July 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2012[/tpl] assisted by a staff drawn from across NATO. The Strategic Commanders are responsible to the Military Committee for the overall direction and conduct of all Alliance military matters within their areas of command.
Each country's delegation includes a Military Representative, a senior officer from each country's armed forces, supported by the International Military Staff. Together the Military Representatives form the Military Committee, a body responsible for recommending to NATO's political authorities those measures considered necessary for the common defence of the NATO area. Its principal role is to provide direction and advice on military policy and strategy. It provides guidance on military matters to the NATO Strategic Commanders, whose representatives attend its meetings, and is responsible for the overall conduct of the military affairs of the Alliance under the authority of the Council.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49633.htm |title= Topic: The Military Committee |work= NATO |date= 5 March 2012 |accessdate= 5 September 2013[/tpl] The Chairman of the NATO Military Committee is Knud Bartels of Denmark, since 2012.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.rttnews.com/1789719/general-knud-bartels-takes-over-as-nato-military-committee-chairman.aspx |title= General Knud Bartels Takes Over As NATO Military Committee Chairman |work= RTTNews |date= 2 January 2012 |accessdate= 4 September 2013[/tpl]
Like the Council, from time to time the Military Committee also meets at a higher level, namely at the level of Chiefs of Defence, the most senior military officer in each nation's armed forces. Until 2008 the Military Committee excluded France, due to that country's 1966 decision to remove itself from NATO's integrated military structure, which it rejoined in 1995. Until France rejoined NATO, it was not represented on the Defence Planning Committee, and this led to conflicts between it and NATO members.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/06/17/france.nato/ |title= France to rejoin NATO command |work= CNN |date= 17 June 2008 |accessdate= 4 September 2013[/tpl] Such was the case in the lead up to Operation Iraqi Freedom.[tpl]cite web | first = Thomas | last = Fuller | title = Reaching accord, EU warns Saddam of his 'last chance' | work=International Herald Tribune | date = 18 February 2003 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/02/18/eu_ed3__1.php | accessdate =15 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012115843/http://iht.com/articles/2003/02/18/eu_ed3__1.php  |archivedate = 12 October 2007[/tpl] The operational work of the Committee is supported by the International Military Staff.
The NATO command structure evolved throughout the Cold War and its aftermath. An integrated military structure for NATO was first established in 1950 as it became clear that NATO would need to enhance its defenses for the longer term against a potential Soviet attack. In April 1951, Allied Command Europe and its headquarters (SHAPE) were established; later, four subordinate headquarters were added in Northern and Central Europe, the Southern Region, and the Mediterranean.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.aco.nato.int/page14612223.aspx |title= 1949-1952: Creating a Command Structure for NATO |work= NATO |accessdate= 4 September 2013 |year= 2013[/tpl]
From 1997–2003 the Strategic Commanders were the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) but the current arrangement is to separate command responsibility between Allied Command Transformation (ACT), responsible for transformation and training of NATO forces, and Allied Command Operations (ACO), responsible for NATO operations worldwide.[tpl]cite web | first = Eide | last = Espen Barth | coauthors = Frédéric Bozo | title = Should NATO play a more political role? | work=Nato Review| publisher=NATO | date = Spring 2005 | url = http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2005/issue1/english/debate.html | accessdate =15 July 2007[/tpl] Starting in late 2003 NATO has restructured how it commands and deploys its troops by creating several NATO Rapid Deployable Corps, including Eurocorps, I. German/Dutch Corps, Multinational Corps Northeast, and NATO Rapid Deployable Italian Corps among others, as well as naval High Readiness Forces (HRFs), which all report to Allied Command Operations.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_50088.htm |title= The Rapid Deployable Corps |work= NATO |date= 26 November 2012 |accessdate= 4 September 2013[/tpl]
