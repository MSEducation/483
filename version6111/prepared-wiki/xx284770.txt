The 2013 RideLondon–Surrey Classic (also known as the 2013 Prudential RideLondon–Surrey Classic for sponsorship reasons) was the inaugural running of the RideLondon–Surrey Classic one-day cycling race. It was held on 4 August 2013 as a 1.1 category event within the 2013 UCI Europe Tour.
The race was won by [tpl]ct|FDJ|2013b[/tpl] rider Arnaud Démare in a sprint finish from a large main group of 96 riders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/539802/arnaud-d-mare-wins-prudential-ridelondon-surrey-classic.html|title=Arnaud Démare wins Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic|publisher=Cycling Weekly|date=4 August 2013|accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl] Sacha Modolo of [tpl]ct|CSF|2013[/tpl] finished second, having also finished second on The Mall in the 2011 London-Surrey Cycle Classic. The podium was completed by Yannick Martinez of [tpl]ct|LPM|2013[/tpl].
Pre-race favourite Peter Sagan ([tpl]ct|CAN|2013[/tpl]) failed to finish together with Matthew Goss ([tpl]ct|OGE|2013[/tpl]). The highest place Briton was Ben Swift ([tpl]ct|SKY|2013[/tpl]) who having been edged out in the final sprint, rolled in tenth, ahead of Gerald Ciolek ([tpl]ct|MTN|2013[/tpl]) - winner of the 2013 Milan – San Remo.

==Race report==

A breakaway of eight riders formed after 44 km, although their advantage did not increase beyond five minutes. The breakaway contained Ramon Sinkeldam of [tpl]ct|ARG|2013[/tpl] who would subsequently amass enough points at the intermediate sprints and on the categorised climbs to win both the Sprints Classification and the King of the Mountains Classification.
With [tpl]ct|SKY|2013[/tpl], [tpl]ct|OGE|2013[/tpl] and [tpl]ct|VCD|2013[/tpl] controlling the peloton the gap to the breakaway reduced to a little over two minutes after the three laps of the Leith Hill circuit. The peloton briefly splintered on the last categorised climb of Box Hill as David Millar of [tpl]ct|GRS|2013[/tpl] set a furious pace which led to the escape of his team mate Jack Bauer together with Yoann Offredo ([tpl]ct|FDJ|2013b[/tpl]) and Simon Yates (Great Britain Cycling Team) - who eventually caught the early breakaway.
With the peloton approaching Yoann Offredo and Zico Waeytens ([tpl]ct|TSV|2013[/tpl]) attacked the remnants of the breakaway on the approach to Kingston upon Thames and built a lead of over a minute with 20 km left to race, however on the approach to London (within the final 6 km) they too were caught by the peloton — resulting in the widely expected bunch sprint on The Mall.
David Millar led the peloton through Westminster, but as the teams passed under the flamme rouge with 1 km to go it was [tpl]ct|FDJ|2013b[/tpl] who were the better organised, delivering Arnaud Démare to the line to win by a bike length from Sacha Modolo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prudentialridelondon.co.uk/News/Newsroom/Inspired_Frenchman_wins_first_Prudential_RideLondon-Surrey_Classic_s1_p16624.htm|title=Inspired Frenchman wins first Prudential RideLondon–Surrey Classic|date=4 August 2013|accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl]
