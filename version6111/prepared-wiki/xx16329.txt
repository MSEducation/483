[[Kytoon]]s are balloon kites that are shaped and tethered to obtain kiting deflections, and can be lighter-than-air, neutrally buoyant, or heavier-than air. Kites have been developed for commercial applications using [[kite control systems]], including the airborne wind energy systems of [[high altitude wind power]].
