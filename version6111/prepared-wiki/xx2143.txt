[[Cro-hook]]

CATEGORIES: Crochet

The cro-hook, is a special double-ended crochet hook used to make double-sided crochet, which is a variation of Tunisian crochet. Because the hook has two ends, two colors of thread can be used simultaneously and freely interchanged. 
Crafts using a double-ended hook are commercially marketed as Cro-hook and Crochenit.
