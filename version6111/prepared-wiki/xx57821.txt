==Career==

Tony Blackburn was in a group called Tony Blackburn and the Rovers which performed in the Bournemouth and surrounding areas. He was the first DJ on BBC Radio 1 when it was launched on 30 September 1967, and presented The Radio 1 Breakfast Show until 1973. The first words spoken on BBC Radio 1 were "...and good morning everyone! Welcome to the exciting new sound of Radio 1". As his singing career failed to take off, despite 14 singles being released, the first being the Pop-Soul styled "Don't Get Off The Train" on Fontana TF 562 released in April 1965 and two in 1967-68, "So Much Love" and "It's Only Love" made the UK Top 40 on MGM, he stopped singing and concentrated on radio presenting. His cheery style and corny jokes ensured his household reputation and made him a popular figure with some, though his dislike of heavy and progressive rock and punk/new wave made him a hate figure with others. His fellow Radio 1 DJ John Peel would often derisively refer to him as "Timmy Bannockburn".
At first he was associated mainly with bubblegum and mainstream pop, but he later championed soul music. It was largely due to him that "I'm Still Waiting" by Diana Ross, which was initially just an album track, was released as a single in the UK in 1971 and reached number one. He was a regular host of Top of the Pops and in 1968 he fronted his own show, Time For Blackburn, produced by Southern Television for the ITV network.
He got into trouble during the late-'60s for critical comments he made on the Radio 1 breakfast show against the Trade Union Congress (TUC). In an 2013 interview for The Radio Academy's Radio Talk podcast, Blackburn says that it is not advisable for a broadcaster to reveal their political allegiances. In this interview, he says that he's "not a great lover of the TUC or of unions ... but I keep it to myself now."
In June 1973, he took over the weekday mid-morning slot, where he introduced 'The Golden Hour'. The feature was to prove popular, being carried on by Simon Bates and Simon Mayo when they took over the slot in subsequent years.
In June 1978 he released a Northern soul single under the name Lenny Gamble, a version of Doris Troy's "I'll Do Anything" on the B side of a Flirtations 45 on Casino Classics CC1, and was allegedly furious when Noel Edmonds, who had recently been given Blackburn's BBC Radio 1 breakfast show slot, revealed the alias on air. Nevertheless both broadcasters later became close friends.
Over several years of the 1970s, Blackburn was a co-presenter on the BBC's summer programme Seaside Special, alongside other well known names from BBC Radio such as Dave Lee Travis and David Hamilton.
In November 1977 he took over the weekday afternoon show and from September 1979 until December 1981 he presented the Top 40 show on Radio 1.
In early 1980 he took over Junior Choice on Saturday and Sunday mornings from 8-10am, while continuing to present the Sunday chart show until the end of 1981 - being succeeded by Tommy Vance. During 1982 BBC Radio 1 dropped the name Junior Choice and the show became the Weekend Breakfast Show which Blackburn continued to host until his final show on 23 September 1984. In addition to his BBC Radio 1 weekend show, he joined BBC Radio London in 1981, where he presented the weekday afternoon show. It was here that he showed his love for soul music.
Having left BBC Radio 1 after 17 years he took over BBC Radio London's weekday mid-morning show in 1984. On Saturday 6 November 2010, Blackburn replaced Dale Winton as the regular host of BBC Radio 2's Pick of the Pops programme.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/sep/24/tony-blackburn-pick-pops |title= Tony Blackburn to present Pick of the Pops|publisher= Guardian Media Group|work= The Guardian|first= John|last= Plunkett|date= 24 September 2010|accessdate= 13 November 2010[/tpl] Blackburn now presents BBC Radio 2's Pick of the Pops every Saturday from 1–3pm as well as BBC London 94.9 on Sundays from 12–3pm and a weekly Sunday show on Magic 1161.
