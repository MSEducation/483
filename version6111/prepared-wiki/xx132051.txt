The leading producers of sorghum bicolor in 2011 were Nigeria (12.6%), India (11.2%), Mexico (11.2%) and the United States (10.0%).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agmrc.org/commoditiesoilseeds/sorghum/sorghum-profile/|title=AGMRC Sorghum profile|author=Jeri Stroade, Michael Boland, and Mykel Taylor[/tpl] Sorghum grows in a wide range of temperature, high altitudes, toxic soils and can recover growth after some drought.  It has four features that make it one of the most drought-resistant crops: 
Richard Pankhurst reports (citing Augustus B. Wylde) that in 19th-century Ethiopia, durra was "often the first crop sown on newly cultivated land", explaining that this cereal did not require the thorough ploughing other crops did, and its roots not only decomposed into a good fertilizer, but they also helped to break up the soil while not exhausting the subsoil.Richard Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1968), p. 193.

==Uses==

Sorghum is cultivated in many parts of the world today. In the past 50 years, the area planted with sorghum worldwide had increased 66%. In many parts of Asia and Africa, its grain are used to make flat breads that form the staple food of many cultures.[tpl]cite book|title=Plant Taxonomy|author=O P Sharma|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|year=1993|isbn=0-07-460373-6|pages=439[/tpl][tpl]cite book |authorlink= |author=National Research Council |editor= |others= |title=Lost Crops of Africa: Volume I: Grains |origdate= |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2305 |format= |accessdate=2008-07-18 |edition= |series=Lost Crops of Africa |volume=1 |date=1996-02-14 |publisher=National Academies Press |location= |isbn=978-0-309-04990-0 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter=Sorghum |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2305&page=127 |quote= |ref= [/tpl] The grains can also be popped in a similar fashion to popcorn.
 

The species can be used as a source for making ethanol fuel, and in some environments may be better than maize or sugarcane, as it can grow under harsher conditions. It typically has protein levels of around 9%, enabling dependent human populations to subsist on it in times of famine, in contrast to regions where maize has become the staple crop. It is also used for making a traditional corn broom.[tpl]cite web | title=How to make a broom | url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Do-It-Yourself/How-To-Make-A-Broom.aspx | publisher=Ogden Publications, Inc | accessdate=2010-03-16[/tpl]
The reclaimed stalks of the sorghum plant are used to make a decorative millwork material marketed as Kirei board.
Sweet sorghum syrup is known as molasses in some parts of the U.S., although it is not true molasses.
In China, sorghum is fermented and distilled to produce one form of clear spirits known as baijiu 白酒 of which the most famous is Moutai (or Maotai). Sorghum was ground and the flour was the main alternative to wheat in northern China for a long time.  
In India, where it is commonly called jwaarie, jowar, jola, or jondhahlaa, sorghum is one of the staple sources of nutrition. An Indian bread, jowar roti or jolada rotti, is prepared from this grain. In some countries, sweet sorghum stalks are used for producing biofuel by squeezing the juice and then fermenting it into ethanol.Sweet Sorghum : A New "Smart Biofuel Crop" AgriBusinessWeek, 30 June 2008 Texas A&M University in the United States is currently running trials to find the best varieties for ethanol production from sorghum leaves and stalks in the USA.Ceres and Texas A&M to Develop and Market High-Biomass Sorghum for Biofuels Texas A&M University System Agriculture Program, 1 October 2007
In Korea, it is cooked with rice, or its flour is used to make cake called susu bukkumi.
In Australia, South America, and the United States (the second largest producer of sorghum after Nigeria), sorghum grain is used primarily for livestock feed and in a growing number of ethanol plants.http://www.sorghumcheckoff.com United Sorghum Checkoff Program 
Sorghum is one of a number of grains used as wheat substitutes in gluten-free recipes and products.

==Agricultural uses==

Sorghum is the world's fifth most important cereal crop after rice, wheat, maize and barley. It is used in feed for livestock. Its use is limited, however, because the starch and protein in sorghum is more difficult for animals to digest than the starches and protein in corn.[tpl]cn|date=December 2012[/tpl]  Research is being done to find a process that will pre-digest the grain. One study on cattle showed that steam-flaked sorghum was preferable to dry-rolled sorghum because it improved daily weight gain. In hogs, sorghum has been shown to be a more efficient feed choice than corn when both grains were processed in the same way.[tpl]clarification needed|what way?|date=December 2012[/tpl]
The introduction of improved varieties, along with improved management practices, has helped to increase sorghum productivity. In India, it is estimated that productivity increases have freed up six million hectares of land. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in collaboration with partners produces improved varieties of crops including sorghum. Some 194 improved cultivars of sorghum from the institute have been released.Sorghum, a crop of substance. Downloaded 16 March 2014.

==Research==

Research is being conducted to develop a genetic cross[tpl]clarification needed|what kind of cross, with a different species?|date=December 2012[/tpl] that will make the plant more tolerant to colder temperatures, since it is native to tropical climates.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://oklahomafarmreport.com/wire/news/2011/02/01538_Sorghum_Research_Showing_Promise_175252.php|journal=Oklahoma Farm Report|title=Sorghum Research Showing Promise|date=23 February 2011[/tpl] In the United States, this is important because the cost of corn is steadily increasing due to its usage in ethanol production for addition to gasoline. Sorghum silage can be used as a replacement of corn silage in the diet for dairy cattle.[tpl]cite book|url=http://amarillo-tamu-edu.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2010/11/dairy_handbookFINAL.pdf|title=Sorghum in Dairy Cattle Production Feeding Guide|author=Micheal J. Brouk and Brent Bean[/tpl]
Other research has shown that a timely harvest of sorghum is essential for a safe feed product. The plants need to be harvested during the time when the plant's total moisture content is between 63 and 68 percent, to prevent lodging.[tpl]what?|date=December 2012[/tpl] Approximately, this is when the grain reaches the "soft dough" stage.[tpl]what?|date=December 2012[/tpl] 
More research has found that sorghum has higher nutritional value compared to corn when feeding dairy cattle. And the type of processing is also essential in harvesting the grain's maximum nutrition. Feeding steam-flaked sorghum showed an increase in milk production when compared to dry-rolling. When a grain is steam-flaked, it is cooked slightly, this makes certain nutrients more available to be digested.

==Parasite==

Sorghum is a host of the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica.[tpl]cite journal | author1=Yoshida, Satoko | author2=Maruyama, Shinichiro | author3=Nozaki, Hisayoshi | author4=Shirasu, Ken | date=28 May 2010 | journal=Science| volume=328 | pages=1128 | doi=10.1126/science.1187145 | issue=5982| pmid=20508124| title=Horizontal Gene Transfer by the Parasitic Plant Stiga hermanthica|bibcode = 2010Sci...328.1128Y [/tpl] This parasite is a devastating pest on the crop.
