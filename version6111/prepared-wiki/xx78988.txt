[[Nest algebra]]

CATEGORIES: Operator theory, Operator algebras

In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, nest algebras are a class of operator algebras that generalise the upper-triangular matrix algebras to a Hilbert space context. They were introduced by [tpl]harvs|txt|authorlink=John Ringrose|last=Ringrose|year=1965[/tpl] and have many interesting properties. They are non-selfadjoint algebras, are closed in the weak operator topology and are reflexive.
Nest algebras are among the simplest examples of commutative subspace lattice algebras. Indeed, they are formally defined as the algebra of bounded operators leaving invariant each subspace contained in a subspace nest, that is, a set of subspaces which is totally ordered by inclusion and is also a complete lattice. Since the orthogonal projections corresponding to the subspaces in a nest commute, nests are commutative subspace lattices.
If we omit one or more of the subspaces Sj from N then the corresponding nest algebra consists of block upper-triangular matrices.
