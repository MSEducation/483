[[1954 Atlantic hurricane season]]

CATEGORIES: 1954 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1954 Atlantic hurricane season caused over $750 million in damage,[tpl]#tag:ref|All damage figures in the article are in 1954 United States dollars (USD) unless otherwise stated|group="nb"[/tpl] the most of any season at the time. The season officially began on June 15, and nine days later the first named storm developed. Hurricane Alice developed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved inland along the Rio Grande, producing significant precipitation and record flooding that killed 55 people. Activity was slow until late August; only Barbara, a minimal tropical storm, developed in July. In the span of two weeks, hurricanes Carol and Edna followed similar paths before both striking New England as major hurricanes.[tpl]#tag:ref|A major hurricane is a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph (179 km/h), or a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.[tpl]cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2010-07-11|title=Glossary of NHC Terms|accessdate=2011-07-23|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110628222802/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml| archivedate= 28 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]|group="nb"[/tpl] The latter became the costliest hurricane in Maine's history.
In late September, Tropical Storm Gilda killed 29 people after drenching northern Honduras. A tropical depression in early October was captured by a high-altitude photograph on a rocket, thus producing the first large-scale image of a tropical cyclone. The strongest and deadliest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Hazel, which killed thousands in Haiti before striking near the North Carolina/South Carolina border in October. It caused heavy damage in the United States before becoming extratropical and affecting Ontario. Intense rainfall affected Toronto with severe flooding, leaving significant damage. The season officially ended on November 15, although another hurricane named Alice developed on December 30 to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles; it lasted until January 6 of the following year. In total, there were 11 tropical storms, 8 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.

==Season summary==

The hurricane season officially began on June 15, when the United States Weather Bureau in Miami, Florida began 24 hour operations. The agency, under the direction of Grady Norton had access to 43 other weather stations across the Atlantic basin. Norton died during the season from a stroke while tracking Hurricane Hazel.[tpl]cite news|author=Staff Writer|newspaper=Reading Eagle|agency=United Press International|date=1954-11-15|title=Hurricane Season Ends|accessdate=2011-09-05|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wwwrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jZoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=7035,6662755&dq=hurricane+season&hl=en[/tpl] Additionally, a group of Hurricane Hunters planes were put on standby for the season, able to be flown out into storms and collect data.[tpl]cite news|author=Rose Mallory|newspaper=Miami Daily News|title=1954 Season Opens Officially|accessdate=2011-08-19|date=1954-06-15|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cbUyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8ugFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6169,2540280&dq=hurricane&hl=en[/tpl] During the season, there were eight named storms, as well as an unnamed hurricane and a tropical depression.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] The season officially ended on November 15, although an unnamed tropical storm formed a day later.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] In addition, Tropical Storm Alice developed on December 31, the latest a tropical cyclone has developed in the calendar year.
Cumulatively, tropical cyclones left 193 deaths and $756 million in damage, becoming the costliest hurricane season at the time. The season was one of six to have three major hurricanes strike the country, along with 2005 (which had four), 1893, 1909, 1933, and 2004. Two of the major hurricanes – Carol and Edna – struck New England; this occurred despite an average of only 5–10 New England hurricanes per century. Carol struck Connecticut as a hurricane and left widespread heavy damage. Only ten days later, Edna became the costliest hurricane in Maine's history. The third major hurricane, Hazel, was the strongest hurricane of the season, attaining winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). Unusually, no tropical cyclones affected Florida.
The season's activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 113,[tpl]cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=March 2011|title=Atlantic basin Comparison of Original and Revised HURDAT|accessdate=2011-07-23|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Comparison_of_Original_and_Revised_HURDAT_mar11.html[/tpl] which is categorized as being "above normal".[tpl]cite web|url=http://hurricane.atmos.colostate.edu/Forecasts/2009/dec2009/dec2009.pdf|title=Extended range forecast of Atlantic seasonal hurricane activity and landfall strike probability for 2010|date=2009-12-09|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=2011-03-14[/tpl] ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs.

==Storms==

===Hurricane Alice (June)===

On June 24, a tropical storm and later hurricane rapidly developed in the western Gulf of Mexico, giving the citizens of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico little time to prepare.[tpl]cite news|author=Staff Writer|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate|title=Gale Hits Mexico|date=1954-06-23|accessdate=2011-08-06|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3scdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VloEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5288,6906305&dq=hurricane&hl=en[/tpl] Hurricane Alice moved ashore in northeastern Mexico and quickly weakened, producing minor damage and killing one person due to a fallen power line.
On June 26, Alice dissipated, although the system dropped torrential rainfall across southern Texas and northeastern Mexico. The maximum rainfall officially peaked at [tpl]convert|24.07|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] near Pandale, Texas,[tpl]cite web|author=David Roth|date=2010-01-13|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/alice1954.html|title=Hurricane Alice – June 24–27, 1954|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=2011-08-05[/tpl] concentrated in an area around the Pecos River. High precipitation accumulations occurred in areas that had seen little rains in three years. This led to significant flooding along the Pecos River that produced "probably the greatest rate of runoff for a watershed of that size in the United States", as reported by the International Boundary and Water Commission.[tpl]cite book|author=Jonathan Burnett|title=Flash floods in Texas|year=2008|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|accessdate=2011-08-05|pages=151–161|isbn=978-1-58544-590-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bYIIV5ZobM8C&pg=PA151&lpg=PA151&dq=hurricane+alice+june+1954+texas#v=onepage&q=hurricane%20alice%20june%201954%20texas&f=false[/tpl] Ozona, Texas sustained the most impact, estimated at $2 million in damage.

===Tropical Storm Barbara===

On July 27, a tropical depression developed in the northern Gulf of Mexico, about 100 mi (160 km) south of Grand Isle, Louisiana.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] A map of the low pressure areas forming in July 1954 indicated that the system originated near the Mississippi Delta and tracked southward.[tpl]cite journal|author=H.F.

There was no wind damage.

===Hurricane Carol===

Carol developed from a tropical wave near the Bahamas on August 25. It quickly intensified as it tracked generally to the north, becoming a hurricane on August 27. Moving parallel to the coastline of the southeastern United States, Carol passed just east of Cape Hatteras with winds between 75 mph (120 km/h) to 125 mph (200 km/h). It intensified further as it accelerated, striking eastern Long Island as upper Category 2 or a Category 3 hurricane.[tpl]cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2006|title=Chronological List of All Hurricanes which Affected the Continental United States: 1851–2005|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2006-11-02|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/ushurrlist.htm| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061013191128/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd//hurdat/ushurrlist.htm| archivedate= 13 October 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Carol made its final landfall on Old Saybrook, Connecticut late on August 31. Within a few hours, the hurricane became extratropical over New Hampshire, which later dissipated over Quebec.
In North Carolina, hurricane-force winds left minor damage to houses,[tpl]cite report|author=James E.

The hurricane moved ashore in Connecticut shortly after high tide, producing a storm surge of 10–15 ft (3–4.5 m) from New London eastward. The surge in Narragansett Bay reached [tpl]convert|14.4|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl], which surpassed that of the 1938 New England hurricane, which flooded downtown Providence with 12 feet (3.7 m) of water. In New London, rainfall peaked around [tpl]convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl]. The hurricane produced winds of over [tpl]convert|115|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] in Connecticut and Rhode Island,[tpl]cite web|author=Eric S. Blake|author2=Ethan J.

Damage totaled $460 million, and there were 60 deaths. In neighboring Canada, high rains caused flooding while strong winds downed trees and power lines.[tpl]cite web|author=Canadian Hurricane Centre|date=2010-09-14|title=1954-Carol|accessdate=2011-08-19|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/Hurricane/default.asp?lang=En&n=BBF632B3-1[/tpl]

===Hurricane Dolly===

A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on August 31 to the northwest of Puerto Rico. It moved rapidly north-northwestward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Dolly later that day and into a hurricane early on September 1.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] Early in the storm's duration, the U.S. Weather Bureau noted the potential for Dolly to affect the same areas of New England that Hurricane Carol struck just days prior.[tpl]cite news|author=Glenn Alter|title=Hurricane Dolly Now Far East of Jacksonville|newspaper=The Miami news|date=1954-09-01|accessdate=2011-08-04|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VjxYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Zz0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=5170,91639&dq=hurricane+dolly+bermuda&hl=en[/tpl] However, the hurricane turned to the north away from land. The Hurricane Hunters estimated maximum sustained winds of 100–115 mph (155–185 km/h) on September 2 after the storm passed about halfway between the Outer Banks and Bermuda. Dolly turned to the northeast on September 2 and became extratropical later that day to the south of Nova Scotia. It was tracked until September 4, until it was last located to the north of the Azores. There was no reported damage.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl]

===Hurricane Edna===

As Dolly became extratropical, the tropical depression that later became Hurricane Edna developed east of the Lesser Antilles on September 2.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] It moved northwestward, dropping heavy rainfall on Puerto Rico as it passed north of the island.[tpl]cite journal|author=William Malkin|author2=George C. Holzworth|title=Hurricane Edna, 1954|date=September 1954|volume=82|issue=9|publisher=American Meteorological Society|journal=Monthly Weather Review|pages=267–279|accessdate=February 1, 2011|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/082/mwr-082-09-0267.pdf|bibcode = 1954MWRv...82..267M |doi = 10.1175/1520-0493(1954)0822.0.CO;2 [/tpl] On September 7 Edna became a hurricane, and the next day reached peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). It turned to the north and northeast, bypassing the Outer Banks and skirting Cape Cod.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] On September 11, Edna became one of only three major hurricanes to strike Massachusetts, along with a hurricane in 1869 and the 1938 New England hurricane. The hurricane later moved ashore near the border between Maine and New Brunswick around the time it became extratropical. The remnants persisted a few more days before dissipating south of Greenland.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl]
Early in its duration, Edna produced high seas and gale force winds in the Bahamas, but there was no damage there. Hurricane force winds occurred in the Outer Banks, although damage was minor. As it passed New England, Edna produced a [tpl]convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] storm surge during a high tide, which caused severe flooding in Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and Cape Cod. Wind gusts peaked at [tpl]convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] on Martha's Vineyard, and the strong winds across the region left widespread power outages. The hurricane dropped additional heavy rainfall to areas affected by Carol, resulting in flooding in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.[tpl]cite web|author=David R. Vallee|author2=Michael R. Dion|date=2005-12-05|title=Hurricane Edna|publisher=Tauton, Massachusetts National Weather Service|accessdate=2011-08-22|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/box/hurricane/hurricaneEdna.shtml[/tpl] In Long Island and New England, the hurricane left over $42 million in damage and 20 deaths, only 11 days after Carol affected the same area. About a third of the damage occurred in Maine, becoming the costliest hurricane on record in the state. Hurricane force winds extended into Canada, causing $6 million in damage (1954 CAD), mostly from crop damage. There was one death in Nova Scotia.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Environment Canada|date=2010-09-14|title=1954-Edna|accessdate=2011-08-22|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/Hurricane/default.asp?lang=En&n=1E1CCBFE-1[/tpl]

===Hurricane Florence===

A tropical storm formed in the Bay of Campeche on September 11. Given the name Florence, the storm moved generally west-southwestward with a small radius of maximum winds. Hurricane Hunters reported winds of [tpl]convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], although winds were estimated to have reached minimal hurricane force, or 75 mph (120 km/h).[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] Before the storm moved ashore, officials in Veracruz evacuated residents from low-lying areas, and overall about 90,000 people left their homes. On September 12, Florence moved ashore between Tuxpan, and Nautla, Veracruz and quickly dissipated.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] The hurricane flooded coastal cities with up to [tpl]convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] of water, cutting off communications throughout the state.[tpl]cite news|author=Staff Writer|newspaper=United Press International|date=1954-09-12|title=Mexican Coast is Battered by Florence|accessdate=2011-08-04|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UJkcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1GQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2214,2232943&dq=hurricane+florence&hl=en[/tpl] Damage was heaviest around Poza Rica, primarily from the destruction of banana plantations. Monetary damage was estimated around $1.5 million, and there were five reported deaths.

===Tropical Storm Gilda===

On September 24, Tropical Storm Gilda developed in the central Caribbean Sea about halfway between Jamaica and Colombia. A small storm, it moved westward throughout its duration. On September 26, Gilda attained peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) while nearing northeastern Honduras. The storm paralleled the coastline a short distance offshore, maintaining its intensity before hitting and later dissipating over Belize on September 27.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] While moving just offshore the coast of Honduras, Gilda dropped intense rainfall, which flooding about 680 mi2 (1760 km2) of land along the Chamelecón and Ulúa rivers. The waters caused the widespread destruction of banana plantations and houses, leaving about 3,000 people homeless. Honduras President Juan Manuel Gálvez appealed for aid from the United States. In response, U.S. Air Force planes flew food, medicine, rafts, and water purification tablets to the most affected regions.[tpl]cite web|author=Daniel Haulman|title=The United States Air Force and Humanitarian Airlift Operations 1947–1994|year=1998|publisher=Air Force History and Museums Program|accessdate=2011-08-06|url=http://www.afhra.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100126-106.pdf|format=PDF| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110722183406/http://www.afhra.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100126-106.pdf| archivedate= 22 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] A total of 29 people were killed in Honduras. When Gilda made its landfall in Belize, it left little property damage and no deaths.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl]

===Hurricane Eight===

A tropical depression formed in the Central Atlantic on September 25. It drifted east-northeastward, eventually becoming a tropical storm on September 29. The storm curved to the west and west-southwest, becoming a hurricane on October 2. It turned to the northeast on October 3, and reached a peak of 100 mph (155 km/h) winds about halfway between Bermuda and the Azores. By that point it began accelerating, and late on October 6 the hurricane became extratropical over the Northeastern Atlantic. Early the next day it was last observed to the south of Iceland.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] The hurricane was not named due to its presence in the eastern Atlantic and not being a threat to land.[tpl]cite journal|author=Gordon E.

===Unnumbered Tropical Depression===

On October 2, a tropical depression moved westward from the coast of Cuba into the Gulf of Mexico. It moved westward without intensifying beyond winds of 35 mph (55 km/h), moving ashore about 40 mi (65 km) north of Brownsville, Texas. The depression weakened as it moved across southern Texas and dropped heavy rainfall. Brownsville recorded over 3 in (75 mm) in a 45 minute period, as well as about [tpl]convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] in six hours. The rainfall rates of about an inch per hour was the heaviest since June 1950. The depression also moved ashore with high waves and tides.[tpl]cite news|author=Staff Writer|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News|title=Tropical Disturbance Blows Toward Texas|date=1954-10-03|accessdate=2011-08-04|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=whEdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=P5gEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4927,3753465&dq=texas+tropical&hl=en[/tpl]
When the system reached the Big Bend region on October 5 it reintensified slightly. Around that time, the United States Navy conducted a rocket test from White Sands, New Mexico; this was despite that such tests were rarely performed when the skies were cloudy. The rocket took an unintended photograph of the depression from an altitude of about 100 miles (160 km), which became the first such large-scale image of a tropical cyclone.[tpl]cite journal|author=L.F.

===Hurricane Hazel===

Hurricane Hazel was the deadliest and costliest hurricane of the season. The storm killed as many as 1,000 people in Haiti before striking the United States near the border between North and South Carolina, as a Category 4 hurricane.[tpl]cite news|title=Hazel's Toll is 200 Dead; 500 Hurt in Haiti|author=Milt Sosin|date=1954-10-13|work=The Miami News|accessdate=2010-03-15|url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?nid=71XFh8zZwT8C&dat=19541013&printsec=frontpage|page=1[/tpl] After causing 95 fatalities in the U.S., Hazel struck Canada as an extratropical storm, raising the death toll by 81 people, mostly in Toronto.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Environment Canada|date=2009-08-17|accessdate=2011-09-06|title=Hurricane Hazel|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=En&n=4343267B-1[/tpl]
Hazel formed on October 5 just east of the Windward Islands and intensified into a major hurricane while crossing the Caribbean Sea. In Haiti, Hazel destroyed 40% of the coffee trees and 50% of the cacao crop, affecting the economy for several years to come.[tpl]cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00816FB395E107B93C7A9178AD85F418585F9|title=Hurricane Dents Economy of Haiti|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-06-14|date=1956-01-05[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Haiti: the politics of squalor|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|url=http://books.google.com/?id=CKV6AAAAMAAJ|isbn=0-395-12105-1|author=Robert I.

When Hazel arrived in Ontario, rivers and streams passing through the Greater Toronto Area overflowed their banks, causing severe flooding.[tpl]cite web|author=Peter Bowyer|year=2004|accessdate=2009-06-17|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=en&n=19D1EDC8-1|title=Hurricane Hazel Impacts — Long Branch[/tpl] As a result, many residential areas located in floodplains, such as the Raymore Drive area, were subsequently converted to parkland.[tpl]cite web|author=Peter Bowyer|year=2004|accessdate=2009-06-17|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=en&n=BD91538F-1|title=Hurricane Hazel Impacts — Humber River[/tpl] In Canada alone, over C$135 million (2009: $1.1 billion) of damage was incurred.[tpl]cite web|author=Peter Bowyer|year=2004|accessdate=2009-06-17|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=en&n=E1111740-1|title=Hurricane Hazel – Evaluation of Organizational Response[/tpl] Hazel was particularly destructive in Toronto, as a result of a combination of a lack of experience in dealing with tropical storms and the storm's unexpected retention of power. Hazel had traveled [tpl]convert|680|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] over land, but while approaching Canada, it had merged with an existing powerful cold front. The storm stalled over the Greater Toronto Area, and although it was now extratropical, it remained as powerful as a category 1 hurricane.[tpl]cite web|author=Peter Bowyer|year=2004|accessdate=2009-06-17|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=en&n=FE4D3A3F-1|title=Hurricane Hazel Impacts — Transportation[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Peter Bowyer|year=2004|accessdate=2009-06-17|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=En&n=FE71002F-1|title=Hurricane Hazel Impacts[/tpl] To help with the cleanup, 800 members of the military were summoned, and a Hurricane Relief Fund was established that distributed $5.1 million (2009: $41.7 million) in aid.

===Tropical Storm Ten===

On November 16, a tropical depression developed about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and the Azores. It moved to the west, quickly intensifying into a tropical storm and reaching peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm maintained that intensity on November 21 when it began weakening, dissipating later that day.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl]

===Hurricane Alice (December)===

The final storm of the season, Alice, developed on December 30 from a trough of low pressure in the central Atlantic Ocean in an area of unusually favorable conditions. The storm moved southwestward and gradually strengthened to reach hurricane status. It persisted into the following calendar year, passing through the Leeward Islands on January 2. Alice reached peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) before encountering cold air and turning to the southeast. It dissipated on January 6 over the southeastern Caribbean Sea.[tpl]cite web|author=José A. Colón|year=1955|title=On the formation of Hurricane Alice, 1955|publisher=U.S. Weather Bureau|accessdate=2006-12-07|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/084/mwr-084-01-0001.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl]
Alice produced heavy rainfall and moderately strong winds across several islands along its path. Saba and Anguilla were affected the most, with total damage amounting to $623,500 (1955 USD).[tpl]cite web|author=Gordon E. Dunn, Walter R. Davis, Paul L.

It received the name Alice in early 1955, though re-analysis of the data supported extending its track to the previous year, resulting in two tropical cyclones of the same name in one season. It was one of only two storms to span two calendar years, along with Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005-06.[tpl]cite web|author=National Weather Service|year=2006|title=Has there ever been a Tropical Storm so late in the year before?|accessdate=2006-12-07|url=http://www.weather.gov/storms/zeta/| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061231034520/http://www.weather.gov/storms/zeta/| archivedate= 31 December 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Hurricane Enterprises LLC|year=2006|title=Oddball Tropical Systems|accessdate=2006-12-07|url=http://www.hurricanealmanac.com/BonusContentOddball.pdf|format=PDF| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061107142227/http://www.hurricanealmanac.com/BonusContentOddball.pdf| archivedate= 7 November 2006 | deadurl= yes[/tpl]

==Storm names==

The following names were used for named storms (tropical storms and hurricanes) that formed in the North Atlantic in 1954. The list was the same as 1953 with the exception of Gilda, which replaced Gail due to the name's confusion with the term gale.[tpl]cite news|author=Staff Writer|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate|date=1954-09-10|title=Plenty of Names Left for Hurricane Season|accessdate=2011-08-04|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HRdIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7IAMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1534,5767404&dq=hurricane+florence&hl=en[/tpl] Names that were not assigned are marked in gray.

===Retirement===

The name Carol was re-used in the 1965 season, but was retroactively retired when the modern naming system was introduced. Edna was reused in 1968 and retired. Hazel was not re-used and was retired.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl][tpl]cite web|date=2011-03-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/retirednames.shtml|accessdate=2011-07-14|publisher=National Hurricane Center|title=Retired Hurricane Names Since 1954| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110628193705/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/retirednames.shtml| archivedate= 28 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
