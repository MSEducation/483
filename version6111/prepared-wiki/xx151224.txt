[[The New Biographical Dictionary of Film]]

CATEGORIES: Books about film, 1975 books, Reference works, Secker & Warburg books

The New Biographical Dictionary of Film is a reference book written by film critic David Thomson and originally published by Martin Secker & Warburg Ltd in 1975 under the title Biographical Dictionary of Cinema.[ref]
</ref> Organized by personality, it is an exhaustive inventory of those involved in international cinema, whether contemporary or historical, elite or esoteric. Beyond its scope, the tome is most notable for infusing subjectivity into its fact-based form; the technique may best be described as a playful deconstruction of the "reference book." It is currently available in its fifth edition, released in October 2010. A sixth edition is due in May 2014.<ref>http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Biographical-Dictionary-Film/dp/0375711848/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1381143862&sr=8-3&keywords=biographical+dictionary+of+film</ref>
