CATEGORIES: 1999 television seasons, 2000 television seasons, Ed, Edd n Eddy seasons

The second season of the Canadian-American animated comedy television series Ed, Edd n Eddy, created by Danny Antonucci, originally aired on Cartoon Network from November 26, 1999, to December 22, 2000, and consists of 26 episodes. The series revolves around three adolescent boys collectively known as "the Eds", who live in a suburban cul-de-sac. Unofficially led by Eddy, the Eds constantly scheme to make money off their peers in order to purchase their favorite confectionery, jawbreakers. However, their plans usually fail, leaving them in various predicaments.
The first season was a success in Nielsen ratings, prompting Cartoon Network for a November 1999 premiere. While the first season itself received generally positive reviews, the second season proved to be an improvement in reception, garnering acclaim and earning two Leo Awards, while the first received one.
The Complete Second Season DVD was released in Region 1 in 2007. The Ed, Edd n Eddy DVD volume Edifying Ed-Ventures, also featured season two episodes. Both DVDs were published by Warner Home Video. Many Cartoon Network compilation DVDs featured episodes from the season. It can also be purchased from the iTunes Store. It was written by Antonucci, Jono Howard, Mike Kubat, and Robert Leighton.

==Development==

===Concept===

Ed, Edd n Eddy follows the lives of three adolescent boys who all share variations of the name Ed, but differ greatly in their personalities. In the pursuit of buying jawbreakers and fitting in with the other kids, dimwitted Ed and intellectual Double D aid the self-appointed leader, Eddy, in his plans to scam the other children in their cul-de-sac out of their money during a perpetual summer vacation; however problems always ensue. The other children mostly dislike or show indifference to the Eds, though they all share a common fear of the Kanker Sisters, a group of teenage girls who live in the nearby "Park n' Flush" trailer park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/03/ed-edd-n-eddy-season-1-vol-1|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: Season 1, Vol. 1|first=Mike|last=Duckers|work=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|date=June 3, 2005|accessdate=January 19, 2012[/tpl] The series takes place mostly within the fictional town of Peach Creek, and new locations were rarely introduced.

===Production and cast===

Danny Antonucci, a cartoonist known for his edgy adult work such as Lupo the Butcher and The Brothers Grunt,[tpl]cite video|people=Danny Antonucci|date=October 10, 2006|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete First Season—Interview with the Creator|time=0:22–2:34|format=DVD|publisher=Warner Home Video[/tpl] was dared by someone to prouduce a children's cartoon. In 1996, Antonucci pitched Ed, Edd n Eddy, which he conceived while designing a commercial, to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. After Cartoon Network agreed to give Antonucci creative control over the show, the series went into production and premiered its first season on January 4, 1999.
According to Cartoon Network executive Linda Simensky, the first season did "remarkably well" in ratings ever since its premiere, becoming one of the top-rated series on the network and prompting Cartoon Network to quickly order a second season for a November 1999 premiere,[tpl]cite journal|journal=Take One|title=Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy: Three Guys, One 'Toon|date=June 22, 1999|first=Linda|last=Simensky|accessdate=September 20, 2012[/tpl] making it one of four seasons which Ed, Edd n Eddy was set to run.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/television/cartoon-net-greenlights-26-new-ed-edd-n-eddys|title=Cartoon Network Greenlights 26 New Ed, Edd n Eddys|accessdate=May 13, 2012|date=June 15, 2004|work=Animation World Network[/tpl] Antonucci stated that change in the characters from the first to the second season is "very" noticeable, due to the amount of development they've went through.[tpl]cite video|people=Danny Antonucci|date=April 24, 2007|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete Second Season—Behind the Eds|format=DVD|publisher=Warner Home Video[/tpl] Antonucci directed the season, and co-wrote the episodes with Jono Howard and Mike Kubat, although Robert Leighton was credited as a co-writer for "To Sir with Ed".Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete Second Season credits

In his review of The Complete Second Season DVD, David Cornelius of DVD Talk considered the Eds adolescent equivalents of The Three Stooges,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/28046/ed-edd-n-eddy-the-complete-second-season/|title=Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy — The Complete Second Season|accessdate=July 31, 2007|last=Cornelius|first=David|date=April 24, 2007|work=DVD Talk[/tpl] believing: "The series revels in the sort of frantic, often gross humor kids love so much, and there's just enough oddball insanity at play to make adults giggle just as easily." Cornelius also concurred that the "animation is colorful and intentionally bizarre; bold lines forming the characters and backgrounds wiggle and morph in a delirious haze. This is animation that's, well, really animated."
