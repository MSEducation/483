Nicotine is a potent parasympathomimetic alkaloid found in the nightshade family of plants (Solanaceae) and a stimulant drug. It is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. It is made in the roots and accumulates in the leaves of the plants.
It constitutes approximately 0.6–3.0% of the dry weight of tobacco[tpl]cite web|url=http://dccps.nci.nih.gov/tcrb/monographs/9/m9_3.PDF |title=Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-12-19[/tpl] and is present in the range of 2–7 µg/kg of various edible plants.[tpl]cite web |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jafcau/1999/47/i08/abs/jf990089w.html |title=Determination of the Nicotine Content of Various Edible Nightshades (Solanaceae) and Their Products and Estimation of the Associated Dietary Nicotine Intake |accessdate=2008-10-05[/tpl]
It functions as an antiherbivore chemical; consequently, nicotine was widely used as an insecticide in the past[ref]

and nicotine analogs such as imidacloprid are currently widely used.
In smaller doses (an average cigarette yields about 1 mg of absorbed nicotine), the substance acts as a stimulant in mammals, while high amounts (50–100 mg) can be harmful.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/chemical/nicotine.htm#PartTitle:7.%20TOXICOLOGY |title=Nicotine (PIM) |publisher=Inchem.org |accessdate=2012-12-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author = Genetic Science Learning Center | title = How Drugs Can Kill | url = http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/drugskill/ [/tpl]
This stimulant effect is likely to be a major contributing factor to the dependence-forming properties of tobacco smoking, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, nicotine inhalers and liquid nicotine vaporizers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] According to the American Heart Association, nicotine addiction has historically been one of the hardest addictions to break, while the pharmacological and behavioral characteristics that determine nicotine addiction are similar to those determining addiction to heroin and cocaine. The nicotine content of popular American-brand cigarettes has slowly increased over the years, and one study found that there was an average increase of 1.78% per year between the years of 1998 and 2005. This was found for all major market categories of cigarettes.[ref]

==Psychoactive effects==

Nicotine's mood-altering effects are different by report: in particular it is both a stimulant and a relaxant.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.ti.ubc.ca/newsletter/effective-clinical-tobacco-intervention |title= Effective Clinical Tobacco Intervention |journal=Therapeutics Letter |issue=21 |date=September–October 1997 |pages=1–4[/tpl] First causing a release of glucose from the liver and epinephrine (adrenaline) from the adrenal medulla, it causes stimulation.

When a cigarette is smoked, nicotine-rich blood passes from the lungs to the brain within seven seconds and immediately stimulates the release of many chemical messengers such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, arginine vasopressin, serotonin, dopamine, and beta-endorphin.Pomerleau OF, Pomerleau CS (1984).  Neuroregulators and the reinforcement of smoking:  Towards a biobehavioral explanation. Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 8:503-513. Pomerleau OF, Rosecrans J (1989).

It also appears to enhance alertness due to the increases of acetylcholine and norepinephrine. Arousal is increased by the increase of norepinephrine. Pain is reduced by the increases of acetylcholine and beta-endorphin. Anxiety is reduced by the increase of beta-endorphin.

Research suggests that, when smokers wish to achieve a stimulating effect, they take short quick puffs, which produce a low level of blood nicotine.[tpl]cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-0888-9_9 |chapter=Factors Governing Recruitment to and Maintenance of Smoking |title=Drug and Alcohol Use |year=1989 |last1=Golding |first1=J.

When they wish to relax, they take deep puffs, which produce a high level of blood nicotine, which depresses the passage of nerve impulses, producing a mild sedative effect. At low doses, nicotine potently enhances the actions of norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain, causing a drug effect typical of those of psychostimulants. At higher doses, nicotine enhances the effect of serotonin and opiate activity, producing a calming, pain-killing effect. Nicotine is unique in comparison to most drugs, as its profile changes from stimulant to sedative/pain killer in increasing dosages and use, a phenomenon described by Paul Nesbitt in his doctoral dissertationNesbitt P (1969).  Smoking, physiological arousal, and emotional response.

Controlled levels of nicotine are given to patients through gums, dermal patches, lozenges, electronic/substitute cigarettes or nasal sprays in an effort to wean them off their dependence.
However, in a few situations, smoking has been observed to be of therapeutic value.
These are often referred to as "Smoker’s Paradoxes".[tpl]cite journal | author = Cohen DJ, Doucet M, Cutlip DE, Ho KK, Popma JJ, Kuntz RE | title = Impact of smoking on clinical and angiographic restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention: another smoker's paradox? | journal = Circulation | volume = 104 | issue = 7 | pages = 773–8 |date=August 2001 | pmid = 11502701 | doi = 10.1161/hc3201.094225 [/tpl] Although in most cases the actual mechanism is understood only poorly or not at all, it is generally believed that the principal beneficial action is due to the nicotine administered, and that administration of nicotine without smoking may be as beneficial as smoking, without the higher risk to health due to tar and other substances found in tobacco.
For instance, studies suggest that smokers require less frequent repeated revascularization after percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI). Risk of ulcerative colitis has been frequently shown to be reduced by smokers on a dose-dependent basis; the effect is eliminated if the individual stops smoking.[tpl]cite book |author=Longmore, M., Wilkinson, I., Torok, E. |title=Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine |page=232 |edition=5th[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Green JT, Richardson C, Marshall RW, Rhodes J, McKirdy HC, Thomas GA, Williams GT | title = Nitric oxide mediates a therapeutic effect of nicotine in ulcerative colitis | journal = Aliment.

Specifically, research examining its addictive nature has been found to show that nicotine activates the mesolimbic pathway ("reward system") – the circuitry within the brain that regulates feelings of pleasure and euphoria.[tpl]cite book |author=National Institute on Drug Abuse |chapter=Extent, Impact, Delivery, and Addictiveness|chapterurl=http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/tobacco-addiction/what-are-extent-impact-tobacco-use |title=Tobacco Addiction|publisher=National Institutes of Health |location=Bethesda MA |date=June 2009 |series=NIDA Report Research Series |id=09-4342|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/tobacco-addiction[/tpl]
Dopamine is one of the key neurotransmitters actively involved in the brain. Research shows that by increasing the levels of dopamine within the reward circuits in the brain, nicotine acts as a chemical with intense addictive qualities. In many studies it has been shown to be as addictive as cocaine and heroin when used in the form of tobacco.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/02/science/is-nicotine-addictive-it-depends-on-whose-criteria-you-use.html | work=The New York Times |first=Philip J. | last=Hilts | title=Is Nicotine Addictive?

As dopamine is downregulated, the sensitivity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors decreases. To compensate for this compensatory mechanism, the brain in turn upregulates the number of receptors, convoluting its regulatory effects with compensatory mechanisms meant to counteract other compensatory mechanisms. An example is the increase in norepinephrine, one of the successors to dopamine, which inhibit reuptake of the glutamate receptors,[tpl]cite journal | author = Yoshida T, Nishioka H, Nakamura Y, Kondo M | title = Reduced norepinephrine turnover in mice with monosodium glutamate-induced obesity | journal = Metab.

The net effect is an increase in reward pathway sensitivity, the opposite of other addictive drugs such as cocaine and heroin, which reduce reward pathway sensitivity. This alteration in neuronal chemistry can persist for months following the last administration.

===Immunology prevention===

Because of the severe addictions and the harmful effects of smoking, vaccination protocols have been developed. The principle operates under the premise that if an antibody is attached to a nicotine molecule, it will be prevented from diffusing through the capillaries, thus making it less likely that it ever affects the brain by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
These include attaching the nicotine molecule as a hapten to a protein carrier such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin or a safe modified bacterial toxin to elicit an active immune response. Often it is added with bovine serum albumin.
Additionally, because of concerns with the unique immune systems of individuals being liable to produce antibodies against endogenous hormones and over-the-counter drugs, monoclonal antibodies have been developed for short term passive immune protection. They have half-lives varying from hours to weeks. Their half-lives depend on their ability to resist degradation from pinocytosis by epithelial cells.[tpl]cite journal | author = Peterson EC, Owens SM | title = Designing immunotherapies to thwart drug abuse | journal = Mol.

==Toxicology==

The [tpl]LD50[/tpl] of nicotine is 50 mg/kg for rats and 3 mg/kg for mice. 30–60 mg (0.5–1.0 mg/kg) can be a lethal dosage for adult humans.[tpl]cite journal |author=Okamoto M, Kita T, Okuda H, Tanaka T, Nakashima T |title=Effects of aging on acute toxicity of nicotine in rats |journal=Pharmacol Toxicol. |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |date=Jul 1994 |pmid=7971729|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0773.1994.tb00316.x[/tpl] However the widely used human LD50 estimate of 0.5–1.0 mg/kg was questioned in a 2013 review, in light of several documented cases of humans surviving much higher doses; the 2013 review suggests that the lower limit causing fatal outcomes is 500–1000 mg of ingested nicotine, corresponding to an
oral LD50 of 6.5–13 mg/kg .[tpl]cite journal | author = Mayer B | title = How much nicotine kills a human?

It is unlikely that a person would overdose on nicotine through smoking alone, although overdose can occur through combined use of nicotine patches or nicotine gum and cigarettes at the same time.[tpl]verify credibility|date=December 2013[/tpl] Spilling a high concentration of nicotine onto the skin can cause intoxication or even death, since nicotine readily passes into the bloodstream following dermal contact.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lockhart LP |title=Nicotine poisoning |journal=Br Med J |volume=1 |issue= 3762|pages=246–7 |year=1933|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.3762.246-c[/tpl]

==Chemistry==

Nicotine is a hygroscopic, oily liquid that is miscible with water in its base form. As a nitrogenous base, nicotine forms salts with acids that are usually solid and water soluble. Its flash point is 95°C and its auto-ignition temperature is 244°C.[ref]www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9926222 Material Safety Data Sheet
L-Nicotine MSDS[/ref]

==Optical activity==

Nicotine is optically active, having two enantiomeric forms. The naturally occurring form of nicotine is levorotatory with a specific rotation of αD = –166.4° ((−)-nicotine). The dextrorotatory form, (+)-nicotine is physiologically less active than (–)-nicotine. (−)-nicotine is more toxic than (+)-nicotine.[tpl]cite book|last=Gause|first=G.

==Biosynthesis==

The biosynthetic pathway of nicotine involves a coupling reaction between the two cyclic structures that compose nicotine. Metabolic studies show that the pyridine ring of nicotine is derived from niacin (nicotinic acid) while the pyrrolidone is derived from N-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(59)90492-5 |title=Ornithine as a precursor for the pyrrolidine ring of nicotine |year=1959 |last1=Lamberts |first1=Burton L. |last2=Dewey |first2=Lovell J. |last3=Byerrum |first3=Richard U. |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=33 |pages=22–6 |pmid=13651178 |issue=1[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja01495a059 |title=The Biosynthesis of Nicotine from Isotopically Labeled Nicotinic Acids1 |year=1960 |last1=Dawson |first1=R.

P. |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=82 |issue=10 |pages=2628[/tpl] Biosynthesis of the two component structures proceeds via two independent syntheses, the NAD pathway for niacin and the tropane pathway for N-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation.
The NAD pathway in the genus nicotiana begins with the oxidation of aspartic acid into α-imino succinate by aspartate oxidase (AO). This is followed by a condensation with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and a cyclization catalyzed by quinolinate synthase (QS) to give quinolinic acid. Quinolinic acid then reacts with phosphoriboxyl pyrophosphate catalyzed by quinolinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase (QPT) to form niacin mononucleotide (NaMN). The reaction now proceeds via the NAD salvage cycle to produce niacin via the conversion of nicotinamide by the enzyme nicotinamidase.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The N-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation used in the synthesis of nicotine is an intermediate in the synthesis of tropane-derived alkaloids. Biosynthesis begins with decarboxylation of ornithine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) to produce putrescine. Putrescine is then converted into N-methyl putrescine via methylation by SAM catalyzed by putrescine N-methyltransferase (PMT). N-methylputrescine then undergoes deamination into 4-methylaminobutanal by the N-methylputrescine oxidase (MPO) enzyme, 4-methylaminobutanal then spontaneously cyclize into N-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The final step in the synthesis of nicotine is the coupling between N-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation and niacin. Although studies conclude some form of coupling between the two component structures, the definite process and mechanism remains undetermined. The current agreed theory involves the conversion of niacin into 2,5-dihydropyridine through 3,6-dihydronicotinic acid. The 2,5-dihydropyridine intermediate would then react with N-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation to form enantiomerically pure (–)-nicotine.[tpl]cite book |editor1-first=Hiroshi |editor1-last=Ashihara |editor2-first=Alan |editor2-last=Crozier |editor3-first=Atsushi |editor3-last=Komamine |title=Plant metabolism and biotechnology |publisher=Wiley |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-470-74703-2[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Pharmacokinetics===

As nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream and crosses the blood–brain barrier reaching the brain within 10–20 seconds after inhalation.[tpl]cite journal | author = Le Houezec J | title = Role of nicotine pharmacokinetics in nicotine addiction and nicotine replacement therapy: a review | journal = Int.

The amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking can depend on many factors, including the types of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used. However, it has been found that the nicotine yield of individual products has only a small effect (4.4%) on the blood concentration of nicotine,Russell MA, Jarvis M, Iyer R, Feyerabend C. Relation of nicotine yield of cigarettes to blood nicotine concentrations in smokers. Br Med J. 1980 April 5; 280(6219): 972–976. suggesting "the assumed health advantage of switching to lower-tar and lower-nicotine cigarettes may be largely offset by the tendency of smokers to compensate by increasing inhalation".
Nicotine is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes (mostly CYP2A6, and also by CYP2B6). A major metabolite is cotinine. Other primary metabolites include nicotine N'-oxide, nornicotine, nicotine isomethonium ion, 2-hydroxynicotine and nicotine glucuronide.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hukkanen J, Jacob P, Benowitz NL | title = Metabolism and disposition kinetics of nicotine | journal = Pharmacol.

===Detection of use===

====Medical detection====

Nicotine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or to facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Urinary or salivary cotinine concentrations are frequently measured for the purposes of pre-employment and health insurance medical screening programs. Careful interpretation of results is important, since passive exposure to cigarette smoke can result in significant accumulation of nicotine, followed by the appearance of its metabolites in various body fluids.[tpl]cite journal |author=Benowitz NL, Hukkanen J, Jacob P |title=Nicotine Psychopharmacology |pages=29–60 |year=2009 |pmid=19184645 |pmc=2953858 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-69248-5_2 |series=Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology |isbn=978-3-540-69246-1 |volume=192 |chapter=Nicotine Chemistry, Metabolism, Kinetics and Biomarkers |issue=192 |journal=Handbook of experimental pharmacology [/tpl][tpl]cite book |first=Randall Clint |last=Baselt |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |year=2008 |publisher=Biomedical Publications |isbn=978-0-9626523-7-0 |edition=8th |pages=1103–7[/tpl] Nicotine use is not regulated in competitive sports programs.[tpl]cite journal |author = Mündel, T. and Jones, D.

===Pharmacodynamics===

Nicotine acts on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, specifically the ganglion type nicotinic receptor and one CNS nicotinic receptor. The former is present in the adrenal medulla and elsewhere, while the latter is present in the central nervous system (CNS). In small concentrations, nicotine increases the activity of these receptors. Nicotine also has effects on a variety of other neurotransmitters through less direct mechanisms.

====In the central nervous system====

By binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, nicotine increases the levels of several neurotransmitters – acting as a sort of "volume control". It is thought that increased levels of dopamine in the reward circuits of the brain one of the major contributors of the apparent euphoria and relaxation, and addiction caused by nicotine consumption. This release of dopamine induced by nicotine is thought to occur via a cholinergic–dopaminergic link, mediated by a neuropeptide, ghrelin, in the ventral tegmentum.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mce.2011.02.017 |title=The role of the central ghrelin system in reward from food and chemical drugs |year=2011 |last1=Dickson |first1=Suzanne L. |last2=Egecioglu |first2=Emil |last3=Landgren |first3=Sara |last4=Skibicka |first4=Karolina P. |last5=Engel |first5=Jörgen A. |last6=Jerlhag |first6=Elisabet |journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology |volume=340 |pages=80–7 |pmid=21354264 |issue=1[/tpl] Nicotine has a higher affinity for acetylcholine receptors in the brain than those in skeletal muscle, though at toxic doses it can induce contractions and respiratory paralysis.[tpl]cite book |author=Katzung, Bertram G. |title=Basic and Clinical Pharmacology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location=New York |year=2006 |pages=99–105 [/tpl] Nicotine's selectivity is thought to be due to a particular amino acid difference on these receptor subtypes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Xiu X, Puskar NL, Shanata JA, Lester HA, Dougherty DA | title = Nicotine binding to brain receptors requires a strong cation-pi interaction | journal = Nature | volume = 458 | issue = 7237 | pages = 534–7 |date=March 2009 | pmid = 19252481 | pmc = 2755585 | doi = 10.1038/nature07768 |bibcode = 2009Natur.458..534X [/tpl]

Nicotine also activates the sympathetic nervous system,[tpl]cite journal |author=Yoshida T, Sakane N, Umekawa T, Kondo M |title=Effect of nicotine on sympathetic nervous system activity of mice subjected to immobilization stress |journal=Physiol. Behav. |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=53–7 |date=Jan 1994 |pmid=8140174 |doi=10.1016/0031-9384(94)90009-4[/tpl] acting via splanchnic nerves to the adrenal medulla, stimulates the release of epinephrine. Acetylcholine released by preganglionic sympathetic fibers of these nerves acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, causing the release of epinephrine (and noradrenaline) into the bloodstream. Nicotine also has an affinity for melanin-containing tissues due to its precursor function in melanin synthesis or due to the irreversible binding of melanin and nicotine. This has been suggested to underlie the increased nicotine dependence and lower smoking cessation rates in darker pigmented individuals. However, further research is warranted before a definite conclusive link can be inferred.[tpl]cite journal |author=King G, Yerger VB, Whembolua GL, Bendel RB, Kittles R, Moolchan ET |title=Link between facultative melanin and tobacco use among African Americans |journal=Pharmacol.

====In adrenal medulla====

By binding to ganglion type nicotinic receptors in the adrenal medulla nicotine increases flow of adrenaline (epinephrine), a stimulating hormone and neurotransmitter. By binding to the receptors, it causes cell depolarization and an influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the exocytosis of chromaffin granules and thus the release of epinephrine (and norepinephrine) into the bloodstream. The release of epinephrine (adrenaline) causes an increase in heart rate, blood pressure and respiration, as well as higher blood glucose levels.[tpl]cite book | author = Elaine N.

Nicotine is the natural product of tobacco, having a half-life of 1 to 2 hours. Cotinine is an active metabolite of nicotine that remains in the blood for 18 to 20 hours, making it easier to analyze due to its longer half-life.[tpl]cite journal |last=Bhalala |first=Oneil |title=Detection of Cotinine in Blood Plasma by HPLC MS/MS |journal=MIT Undergraduate Research Journal |volume=8 |date=Spring 2003 |pages=45–50 |url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/89426297/Detection-of-Cotinine-in-Blood-Plasma-by-HPLC-MS-MS[/tpl]

==History and name==

===Name===

Nicotine is named after the tobacco plant Nicotiana tabacum, which in turn is named after the French ambassador in Portugal, Jean Nicot de Villemain, who sent tobacco and seeds to Paris in 1560, and who promoted their medicinal use. The tobacco and its seeds were brought to Ambassador Nicot from Brazil by Luis de Gois, a Portuguese colonist in São Paulo.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Chemical identification===

Nicotine was first isolated from the tobacco plant in 1828 by physician Wilhelm Heinrich Posselt and chemist Karl Ludwig Reimann of Germany, who considered it a poison.[tpl]cite journal |author=Posselt, W.; Reimann, L. |title=Chemische Untersuchung des Tabaks und Darstellung eines eigenthümlich wirksamen Prinzips dieser Pflanze |trans_title=Chemical investigation of tobacco and preparation of a characteristically active constituent of this plant|language=German |journal=Magazin für Pharmacie |volume=6 |issue=24 |pages=138–161 |year=1828 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cgkCAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA138[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Henningfield JE, Zeller M | title = Nicotine psychopharmacology research contributions to United States and global tobacco regulation: a look back and a look forward | journal = Psychopharmacology (Berl.) | volume = 184 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 286–91 |date=March 2006 | pmid = 16463054 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-006-0308-4 [/tpl] Its chemical empirical formula was described by Melsens in 1843,Melsens, Louis-Henri-Frédéric (1843) "Note sur la nicotine," Annales de chimie et de physique, third series, vol. 9, pages 465-479; see especially page 470. The empirical formula that Melsens provides is incorrect because at that time, chemists used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12). its structure was
discovered by Adolf Pinner and Richard Wolffenstein in 1893,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1002/cber.189102401242 |title=Ueber Nicotin |year=1891 |last1=Pinner |first1=A. |last2=Wolffenstein |first2=R. |journal=Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft |volume=24 |pages=1373[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1002/cber.18930260165 |title=Ueber Nicotin.

===As an insecticide===

Tobacco was introduced to Europe in 1559, and by the late 17th century, it was used not only for smoking but also as an insecticide. After World War II, over 2,500 tons of nicotine insecticide (waste from the tobacco industry) were used worldwide, but by the 1980s the use of nicotine insecticide had declined below 200 tons. This was due to the availability of other insecticides that are cheaper and less harmful to mammals.
Currently, nicotine, even in the form of tobacco dust, is prohibited as a pesticide for organic farming in the United States.US Code of Federal Regulations. 7 CFR 205.602 - Nonsynthetic substances prohibited for use in organic crop productionStaff, IFOAM.

In 2008, the EPA received a request, from the registrant, to cancel the registration of the last nicotine pesticide registered in the United States.[tpl]Cite journal | author = USEPA | title = Nicotine; Notice of Receipt of Request to Voluntarily Cancel a Pesticide Registration | journal = Federal Register | pages = 64320–64322 | date = 29 October 2008 | url = https://federalregister.gov/a/E8-25831| accessdate = 8 April 2012 [/tpl] This request was granted, and since 1 January 2014, this pesticide has not been available for sale.[tpl]Cite journal | author = USEPA | title = Nicotine; Product Cancellation Order | journal = Federal Register | pages = 26695–26696 | url =https://federalregister.gov/a/E9-12561 | date = 3 June 2009 | accessdate = 8 April 2012 [/tpl]
