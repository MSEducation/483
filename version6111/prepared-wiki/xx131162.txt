==Early life and career==

He was employed by Adams Distilleries from 1976 to 1978, then by the Seagram distillery from 1978 to 1985, where he served as the executive vice-president from 1982 to 1985.

==Montreal Expos==

He was named president of the Montreal Expos baseball club by Charles Bronfman in 1986, replacing John McHale.
On June 14, 1991, he formed a group of thirteen investors to buy the team and prevent a threatened move to Arizona. He used C$2 million from his own funds to make this purchase.
He was the largest shareholder of the team with 7% of the shares. In 1995, he oversaw a "fire sale" of the team's best players, including Marquis Grissom, Larry Walker and John Wetteland.
His plan to save the team from bankruptcy was to build a new Baseball park in downtown Montreal, which would be named Labatt Stadium.
He asked for subsidies from the Canadian and Quebec governments of the time, but when this attempt failed, he resigned in 1998 and sold his shares to New York businessman Jeffrey Loria.
In 2001, he published the book My Turn at Bat: The Sad Saga of the Expos, which blamed Quebec ex-premier Lucien Bouchard for the sale of the baseball team.
