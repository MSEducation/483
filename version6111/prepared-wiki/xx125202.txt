==History==

International Alert was established in the mid-1980s, an era dominated by the Cold War, and whilst conflicts between nations were decreasing, internal conflicts and civil wars were rapidly increasing. Born out of the merger of The Standing International Forum on Ethnic Conflict, Development, and Human Rights (SIFEC), and US organisation International Alert on Genocides and Massacres, it counted Archbishop Desmond Tutu amongst the members of its first board of trustees.
It was the first organisation to concern itself specifically with violent internal conflict and at that time there existed no internationally agreed procedures for resolving internal conflict. International Alert aimed to encourage the creation of acceptable procedures and structures for resolving such situations.
Its work in areas of violent conflict focused on working with local partner organisations to facilitate peace deals and to ensure a transition to a functioning stable society.

==Structure==

International Alert's current Secretary General is Dan Smith. The organisation is led by a Board of Trustees made up of eleven members from around the world, and a five person Senior Management Team. It is divided into teams working on Eurasia, Asia, the Americas, West Africa, the African Great Lakes, Peacebuilding Issues, and Development.

===Secretaries General===

The organisation has been led by four Secretaries General, as well as two acting Secretaries General, since its creation.
