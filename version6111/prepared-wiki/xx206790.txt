[[1990s in video gaming]]

CATEGORIES: 1990s in video gaming, Years in video gaming

The 1990s were a decade of marked innovation in video gaming[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]. It was a decade of transition from sprite-based graphics to full fledged 3D graphics[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] and it gave rise to several genres of video games including, but not limited to, the first person shooter, real-time strategy, survival horror, and MMO[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]. Handheld gaming began to become more popular throughout the decade[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl], thanks in part to the release of the Game Boy[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]. Arcade games, although still relatively popular in the early 1990s[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl], begin a decline as home consoles become more common.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]

==Consoles of the 1990s==

===Fourth generation consoles===

Starting in 1987 and ending in 1996, the fourth generation of video game consoles consisted primarily of games and systems programmed for the 16-bit era.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] During this generation, 2D graphics had improved over the previous generation and experimentation began to occur with 3D graphics, although 3D games were more prevalent on the PC at the time. The fourth generation also was the first time Compact Discs were considered a viable port for video game retail sales with the CD-i. Some of the most notable systems released during this generation were the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (1990), the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (1988), and the Neo Geo (1990).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vintagegamesite.com/hwfourth.php |title=4th Generation Vintage Hardware and Computing Consoles |publisher=VintageGameSite.com |date=2007-08-19 |accessdate=2009-07-23|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081222192552/http://www.vintagegamesite.com/hwfourth.php |archivedate = December 22, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Nintendo's Game Boy was also released during the fourth generation, which would later become the most popular series of handheld gaming systems during the 1990s.Nintendo GameBoy - Read reviews A rivalry between Sega and Nintendo occurred during this generation, starting the first ever console war.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]

===Fifth generation consoles===

Approximately starting in 1993 and ending in 2002, the fifth generation of video games are most widely known to be the 32/64 bit era and for being the transition period for video games to evolve into the third dimension.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] The Nintendo 64 (1996), PlayStation (1994), and Sega Saturn (1994) are considered to be the big three gaming systems of this generation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] With the introduction of the PlayStation and Saturn, compact discs (CDs) began to replace cartridges however the Nintendo 64 remained loyal to them due to the load times on CDs at the time and became one of the last cartridge based systems in mass production.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]

===Early sixth generation console===

The sixth generation was initiated by the release of the Dreamcast in 1999.[tpl]cite web |title=PlayStation 2 Timeline |work=GameSpy |publisher=IGN |first=Steven L.|last= Kent |date=2004-02-18 |page=2 |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/february04/ps2timeline/index2.shtml |accessdate=2008-03-03 |quote=1998 – November 27th: Sega initiates the next generation of game consoles by launching Dreamcast in Japan...| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5nDZ5srId | archivedate = 2010-02-01| deadurl=no[/tpl] It introduced several innovations including Internet gaming as a standard feature through its built-in modem, and a web browser. It was also the first home console to always display full SD resolution. Despite its early success, the Dreamcast was discontinued prematurely as sales slowed following the release of the PlayStation 2 in 2000.

==Technological innovation==

===Introduction of 3D environments and polygons===

Said to be one of the most revolutionary video games, Super Mario 64 was praised for how it took to 3D environments of wide open spaces and graphics at the time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://top100.ign.com/2003/1-10.html |title=IGN's Top 100 Games of All Time |publisher=ign.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-23| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mqeaoEzJ | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no[/tpl] Many games that moved onto 3D also tried to mimic Mario's success. Instead of pixels, polygons became a standard sight to be in video games from then on as they looked more lifelike when programmed into the right shapes.
Lara Croft of the Tomb Raider series became the first video game sex symbol[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl], becoming a recognizable figure in the entertainment industry throughout the late 1990s.

===Optical disc storage===

Nearly every system released in the mid-late 1990s began to move to the new CD-ROM technology, with the Nintendo 64 being the last major home video game console to use ROM cartridges. Also appealing to publishers was the fact that CDs could be produced at significantly less expense and with more flexibility (it was easy to change production to meet demand), and they were able to pass the lower costs onto consumers. In particular, the fifth generation marked a turning point for optical-based storage media. As games grew more complex in content, sound, and graphics, the CD proved more than capable of providing enough space for the extra data.  The cartridge format, however, was pushed beyond the limits of its storage capacity. Consequently, many game developers shifted their support away from the Nintendo 64 to the PlayStation.

===Memory cards===

Due to CD-ROMs lacking the built-in memory of ROM Cartridges, the Sony PlayStation introduced the use of memory cards to store saved game data. This became the standard for video game consoles until it was replaced by the use of hard drives and built-in flash memory during the seventh generation in the late first decade of the 21st century.

===Game controllers===

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System game controller introduced a more rounded dog-bone like design and added two more face buttons, "X" and "Y", arranging the four in a diamond formation. Another addition was the "L" and "R" shoulder buttons, which have been imitated by most controllers since.
The PlayStation controller was the first standard operating device for a home console to use two handle-bars at the bottom of the controller whereas previously this feature had been relegated to niche specialist controllers. This has been standard in most game controllers since, until the Wii appeared.
The Virtual Boy controller was a controller which utilized dual joypads similar to how analog sticks functioned in later "dual control" sixth-generation systems. The presence of two pads was an effort to control objects in a 3D environment (one pad controlling pitch and turning while the other controlling forward movement and strafing).
In 1996 Nintendo introduced the first analog thumbstick on the Nintendo 64 controller. It was subsequently followed in the industry during the fifth generation by the Sega Analog controller (packaged with Nights into Dreams...), the Sony Dual Analog gamepad which introduced the use of two analog sticks, and the Sony DualShock. Since then, all major video game console controllers have included two analog thumbsticks, except for the Wii's "Wii-mote".
The optional Rumble Pak for the Nintendo 64 controller introduced the use of haptic force feedback technology in gaming. It was later followed by the DualShock controller for the PlayStation which had built-in haptic feedback. Since then, built-in force feedback has become standard for most game controllers.
The use of pressure-sensitive buttons was introduced by the Sega DreamCast in 1999. It has trigger-like shoulder buttons, similar to the earlier Nintendo 64 controller, but the main difference being that DreamCast controller's shoulder buttons are pressure-sensitive. Since then, most game controllers have included pressure-sensitive buttons.

===Online gaming===

Online gaming, which in previous generations had been the exclusive domain of PC games, became prominent in video game consoles starting in the late 1990s. The Dreamcast initiated this change in 1999 with its built in modem, internet browsing software, and ability to play certain games online. Nearly all consoles since released then have had support for online gaming.

==Genre innovation==

Many technically innovative and genre-defining games were developed during the 1990s, largely due to the impact of 3D graphics allowing three-dimensional environments as well as optical discs which allowed much greater storage capacity.

===Fighting games===

The release of Street Fighter II in 1991 is often considered a revolutionary moment in the fighting game genre. Yoshiki Okamoto's team developed the most accurate joystick and button scanning routine in the genre thus far. This allowed players to reliably execute multi-button special moves, which had previously required an element of luck. The game was also highly successful because its graphics took advantage of Capcom's CPS arcade chipset, with highly detailed characters and stages. Whereas previous games allowed players to combat a variety of computer-controlled fighters, Street Fighter II allowed players to play against each other. The popularity of Street Fighter II surprised the gaming industry, as arcade owners bought more machines to keep up with demand.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/sfhistory/history.html | title = The History of Street Fighter | publisher = GameSpot | accessdate = 2008-10-11 [/tpl]
SNK released Fatal Fury: King of Fighters a few months later,[tpl]cite web |last= Provo|first=Frank | url = http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/action/fatalfury/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;read-review | title = Fatal Fury: King of Fighters Review | publisher = GameSpot | date = 2007-10-11 | accessdate = 2009-01-11 [/tpl] adding a two-plane system where characters could step into the foreground or background. Meanwhile, Sega experimented with Dark Edge, an early attempt at a 3D fighting game where characters could move in all directions. Sega however, never released the game outside of Japan because it felt that unrestrained 3D fighting games were unenjoyable. Several fighting games achieved greater commercial success, including SNK's Art of Fighting and Samurai Shodown as well as Sega's Eternal Champions.  Nevertheless, Street Fighter II remained the most popular,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/sat/segafight/page2.html | title = History of Sega Fighting Games | publisher = GameSpot | accessdate = 2008-10-11 [/tpl] spawning a special Champion Edition that improved game balance and allowed players to use additional characters. The popularity of Street Fighter II led it to be released for home game consoles and allowed it to define the template for fighting games.
Sega began to attract attention with the 1993 release of Virtua Fighter in arcades. It was the first fighting game with 3D polygon graphics and a viewpoint that zoomed and rotated with the action. Despite the graphics, players were confined to back and forth motion as seen in other fighting games. By the time the game was released for the Sega Saturn in Japan, the game and system were selling at almost a one-to-one ratio. In 1994, SNK released The King of Fighters '94 in arcades, where players choose from teams of three characters to eliminate each other one by one.[tpl]cite web | url = http://wii.ign.com/articles/852/852523p1.html | title = IGN: King of Fighters '94 | publisher = IGN | accessdate = 2008-10-17 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081005211302/http://wii.ign.com/articles/852/852523p1.html| archivedate= 5 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] A follow-up to Street Fighter II, Street Fighter Alpha, was released in 1995 but was unable to match the popularity of its predecessor. Throughout this period, the fighting game was the dominant genre in competitive video gaming, with enthusiasts popularly attending arcades in order to find human opponents.[tpl]cite web | author = Gertsmann, Jeff | url = http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/ultimatemortalkombat3/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;read-review | title = Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Review | publisher = GameSpot | date = 2008-10-24 | accessdate = 2009-01-11 [/tpl]
The fighting game genre continued to evolve as several strong 3D fighting games emerged in the late 1990s. Namco's Tekken (released in arcades in 1994 and on the PlayStation in 1995) proved critical to the PlayStation's early success, with its sequels also becoming some of the console's most important titles.[tpl]cite web | author = Gerstmann, Jeff | url =  http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/action/tekken3/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;read-review | title = Tekken 3 Review | publisher = GameSpot | date = 1998-03-30 | accessdate = 2009-01-11 [/tpl]  The Soul series of weapon-based fighting games also achieved considerable critical success, beginning with 1997's Soul Edge.[tpl]cite web | author = Robertson, Ed | url = http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/action/soulblade/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;read-review | title = Soul Blade Review | publisher = GameSpot | date = 1997-04-03 | accessdate = 2009-01-11 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | author = Calvert, Justin | url = http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/soulcaliburiv/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;read-review&page=2 | title = Soulcalibur IV Review | publisher = GameSpot | date = 2008-07-31 | accessdate = 2009-01-11 [/tpl] Tecmo's Dead or Alive (released in 1996 in Japanese arcades and 1998 on the PlayStation) spawned a long-running franchise, known for its fast paced control system and innovative counterattacks. The series again included titles important to the success of their respective consoles.[tpl]cite web | author = Kasavin, Greg | url = http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/deadoralive4/review.html | title = Dead or Alive 4 Review | publisher = GameSpot | date = 2006-01-01 | accessdate = 2009-02-02 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090130135142/http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/deadoralive4/review.html?| archivedate= 30 January 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author = Staff | url = http://uk.psx.ign.com/articles/152/152306p1.html | title = Dead or Alive (PS) | publisher = IGN | date = 1998-03-27 | accessdate = 2009-01-12 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | author = Rorie, Matthew | url = http://uk.gamespot.com/features/freeplay/index.html?story=6142102&tag=result;title;2 | title = Two Men Enter, One Man Leaves... | publisher = GameSpot | date = 2006-01-09 | accessdate = 2009-01-12 [/tpl]

===First-person shooters===

The first-person shooter (FPS) typically features the player as the protagonist. Most often the player does not see the face of who they are playing, but will always see the weapon of choice located in the players hand in the lower left or right hand corner. FPSs are usually violent and feature blood and gore, which has sparked controversy from parent groups.
With the introduction of the fifth generation of games, 3-D graphics become the standard by end of decade. Although FPSs had been some of the first games to become 3-D.
Doom (1993) bursts onto the world scene and instantly popularizes the FPS genre, and even how games are played, as Doom is among the first games to feature multiplayer capabilities. It was Goldeneye 007 (1997), that introduced an engine that made development of  first-person shooters for home consoles, a practicale idea. It is not until Quake (1996), however, that game developers begin to take multiplayer features into serious consideration when making games. Quake II (1997), Unreal (1998) and  Half-Life (1998) feature the next evolutionary step in the genre with continual progression of the game (no levels in the traditional sense) and an entirely in-person view, and become one of the most popular video games in history.

===Interactive movies===

In the early-to-mid-1990s, several video game developers experimented with plot twists and providing alternative storylines and endings into their games. They even went as far as to film live action scenes and scripted popular actors to play the parts. Night Trap, released in 1992, was highly acclaimed for implementing live action scenes into video games and later the Wing Commander series dove into live action as well. Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom was given an unheard of budget of US$12 million and starred Mark Hamill of Star Wars fame. The Wing Commander series was known for providing several alternate endings depending on how the player followed the story and interacted with the characters.

===Platform games===

The platform game genre evolved through several distinct phases throughout the 1990s. The first was an evolutionary step during the fifth generation in the early 1990s, followed by a complete transformation of the genre during the sixth generation in the late 1990s.
The advent of 16-bit home consoles in the early 1990s marked an evolutionary step for the genre. By the time the Mega Drive and Super Nintendo Entertainment System launched, platform games were the most popular genre in home console gaming and were seen as vital for winning the console war. There was a particular emphasis on having a flagship platform title exclusive to a format, featuring a "mascot" character. Sega's Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle (1989) was only modestly successful, and Sega realized would need a stronger mascot to move Genesis units. In 1990, Hudson Soft released Bonk's Adventure featuring a character that would be positioned as NEC's mascot.[tpl]cite web | url=http://bonkzonk.com/series.shtml | title=Series Guide | last= | first= | publisher=Bonk Compendium | date= |accessdate=2007-01-27| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070125052034/http://bonkzonk.com/series.shtml| archivedate= 25 January 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
1990 marked the release of the Super NES, along with the much awaited Super Mario World. In order to fend off the new competition, Sega released Sonic the Hedgehog.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sega-16.com/feature_page.php?id=99&title=History%20of:%20The%20Sonic%20The%20Hedgehog%20Series | title=History of: The Sonic the Hedgehog Series | last=Horowitz | first=Ken | publisher=Sega-16|date=2005-06-22 |accessdate=2007-01-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sonic-cult.org/dispart.php?catid=1&gameid=1&subid=1&artid=1 | title=Overview | last= | first= | publisher=Sonic Cult|date= |accessdate=2007-01-27[/tpl] Whereas Nintendo's offering featured a conservative design, true to the Mario tradition, Sonic showcased a new style of design made possible by a new generation of hardware. Sonic featured large fields that scrolled effortlessly in all directions, as well as all manner of uneven terrain, curved hills, and a complex physics system that allowed players to rush through its levels with well-placed jumps and rolls. It proved to be a massive hit, was a successful pack-in with new systems, and cemented the view that platform games would make or break a console.
The Sonic character was also seen as a new model for mascots in the early 1990s, particularly for his perceived "attitude," which characterized him as a rebel from the status quo. This "attitude" would soon become the status quo, as companies attempted to duplicate Sonic's success with their own brightly colored anthropomorphisms.[tpl]cite web | url=http://gamasutra.com/features/20060804/boutros_04.shtml | title=A Detailed Cross-Examination of Yesterday and Today's Best-Selling Platform Games | last=Boutros | first=Daniel | publisher=Gamasutra|date=2006-08-04 |accessdate=2006-11-21[/tpl] Very frequently these were characterized by impatience, sarcasm, and frequent quipping to give them personality. These mascots, which included the likes of Gex, Bug!, and Bubsy, have mostly faded from relevance.
Another notable platform game from this time period include Prince of Persia which featured an unprecedented level of animation. Frequently, video games based on film, television, and comic book licenses would be platformers, such as those based on Aladdin, Jurassic Park, James Bond, and Mickey Mouse.
In 1996, Nintendo released Super Mario 64. Until this time there had been no established archetype for bringing platform games into 3D. Mario 64 set a new standard and would be imitated by many 3D platformers to follow. Its gameplay allowed players to explore open 3D environments with greater freedom than any previous attempt at a 3D platform game. To aid this, Nintendo incorporated an analog control stick to their standard Nintendo 64 controller, something which had not been included in a standard console controller since the Vectrex (and since incorporated into the DualShock among other controllers). This allowed for the finer precision needed for a free perspective. Players no longer followed a linear path to the ends of levels, either, with most levels providing objective-based goals. There were, however, a handful of "boss" levels that offered more traditional platforming, and showed what a more direct conversion to 3D might have been like.
Some argue that many modern 3D platformers, especially those influenced heavily by Super Mario 64, are not platformers at all, or at least are not really an extension of 2D platformers.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3211627.stm | title=Platform video games evolve | last= | first= | publisher=BBC | date=2003-10-25 |accessdate=2006-11-21[/tpl] Super Mario 64 brought a change in the goals of some platformers. In most 2D platformers, the player only had to reach a single goal to complete a level, but in many 3D platformers, each level had to be combed for collectible items such as puzzle pieces (Banjo-Kazooie) or stars (Super Mario 64). This allowed for more efficient use of large 3D areas and rewarded the player for thorough exploration, but they also often involved more elements of action-adventure games, and less jumping on platforms.

===Racing games===

In 1992, Sega produced Virtua Racing, one of the first games with full 3D graphics. It was able to combine the best features of games at the time, along with multiplayer machine linking and clean 3D graphics to produce a game that was above and beyond the arcade market standard of its time. Also, Nintendo broke new ground by introducing the Mario Kart series on the SNES with Super Mario Kart. Using the familiar characters from the Mario franchise, the game not only departed from the realism paradigm by using small karts for the players to drive, but also featured bright, colourful environments and allowed the players to pick up power-ups to improve performance or hamper other racers. This franchise also spawned multiple sequels.
In 1993, Namco struck back with Ridge Racer, and thus began the polygonal war of driving games. Sega struck back in 1994 with Daytona USA, while Midway introduced Cruis'n USA. Atari didn't join the 3D craze until 1997, when it introduced San Francisco Rush. In 1996, Konami introduced GTI Club which allowed free roaming of the environment - something of a revolution that had only been done in 3D before in Hard Drivin'.
In 1997, Gran Turismo was released for the PlayStation. It was considered the most realistic racing simulation game in its time, combined with playability, enabling players of all skill levels to play. The Gran Turismo series has since become one of the most popular racing franchises ever, with the series selling more than 50 million copies worldwide. Colin McRae Rally was introduced in 1998 to the PC world, and was a successful semi-simulation of the world of rally driving (previously only available in Sega's less serious Sega Rally Championship). Motorhead, a PC game, was later adapted back to arcade.
1999 marked a change of games into more "free form" worlds. Midtown Madness allows the player to explore a simplified version of the city of Chicago using a variety of vehicles and any path that they desire. In the arcade world, Sega introduced Crazy Taxi, where you are a taxi driver that needed to get the client to the destination in the shortest amount of time. A similar game also from Sega is Emergency Ambulance Driver, with almost the same gameplay (pick up patient, drop off at hospital, as fast as possible).

===Role-playing games===

The 1990s saw the emergence of several distinct subgenres of the role-playing video game genre.
1990 would see the release of Crystalis for the NES and also Golden Axe Warrior for the Master System. Both games featured Zelda-like gameplay blended with genuine RPG elements, such as experience points, statistics-based equipment, and a magic-casting system. In 1991, Square released Seiken Densetsu for the Game Boy, also known as Final Fantasy Adventure in the West.  Like Crystalis, the action in Seiken Densetsu bore a strong resemblance to that of Zelda, but added more RPG elements.  Seiken Densetsu 2, also known as Secret of Mana, implemented an innovative multiplayer function, and further developed its combat with more diverse weaponry and spell-casting.
Unique among video games are Capcom's Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Doom (1993) and Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara (1996). These games were released for the arcades, and featured a blending of beat 'em up and RPG characteristics. The games were later released for the Sega Saturn together as the Dungeons & Dragons Collection (1999).  Several later beat 'em ups followed this same formula, including Guardian Heroes, Castle Crashers and Dungeon & Fighter.
In Japan on Super Famicom, Tales of Phantasia was released in Japan in 1995, featuring real-time side-scrolling combat mode and an exploration mode similar to classic console RPGs. In 1996, Star Ocean was released that also has real-time combat and classic exploration but features bird's eye view. Namco and Enix did not publish these two revolutionary titles in America, even though sequels in the two series would become wildly popular on future generations of consoles in the US. Fifth generation era saw several popular action RPGs, such as Tales of Eternia, Brave Fencer Musashi and Legend of Oasis.
It was in the early 1990s that the console role-playing video game genre distinguished itself greatly from computer RPGs, with the Final Fantasy series playing an instrumental role. Final Fantasy III introduced the "job system", a character progression engine allowing the player to change a character's class, as well as acquire new and advanced classes.Final Fantasy III Official Website.

The next major revolution came in the late 1990s, which saw the rise of optical disks in fifth generation consoles.  The implications for RPGs were enormous—longer, more involved quests, better audio, and full-motion video. This was first clearly demonstrated by Final Fantasy VII (1997). The explosion of Final Fantasy VIIs sales and the ascendance of the PlayStation were proof of this and represented the dawning of a new era of RPGs. Backed by a clever marketing campaign, Final Fantasy VII brought the first taste of CRPGs to many of the new gamers brought in by the PlayStation gaming console.[tpl]cite web | date=October 2003 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zd1up/is_200310/ai_ziff109006 | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children | work=Find Articles; originally published in 1UP | accessdate=August 10, 2006| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051001023042/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zd1up/is_200310/ai_ziff109006| archivedate = October 1, 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-08-29-dirge-of-cerberus_x.htm|title='Dirge of Cerberus' defies expectations, for better and worse|author=Kraus, Alex|publisher=USA Today|date=2006-08-29|accessdate=2006-08-30| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5lsShRPgb | archivedate = 2009-12-08| deadurl=no[/tpl] Subsequently, CRPGs, previously a niche genre, skyrocketed in popularity.
In 1997, a new Internet fad began, influenced by the popularization of console RPGs. A large group of young programmers and aficionados began creating and sharing independent CRPG games, emulating the gameplay and style of the older SNES and Sega Genesis games. The majority of such games owe their achievement to simplistic software development kits such as the Japanese RPG Maker series.
1989 and the early 1990s saw the release and spread of the MUD codebases DikuMUD and LPMud, leading to a tremendous increase in the proliferation and popularity of MUDs.  Before the end of the decade, the evolution of the genre continued through "graphical MUDs" into the first massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), a term coined by Richard Garriott in 1997.  That genre, as currently defined, began with Meridian 59 in 1995, but first truly came into its own with Ultima Online in 1997, a game that provided a core idea of what later MMORPGs would become, featuring a massive continent on which players could interact with others from around the world, fight mythical creatures, and cast spells.  After earlier games broke ground, widespread popularity for MMORPGs arrived with the debut of EverQuest and Asheron's Call in 1999.  MMORPGs would become a common form of social interaction in the 2000s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/001625.php |title=The Daedalus Project: Social Architectures in MMOs |work=Nickyee.com |date=2008-06-10 |accessdate=2009-07-23[/tpl]
In 1990, Nintendo released and published the first tactical RPG, Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryū to Hikari no Tsurugi for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), created and developed by Intelligent Systems. Released in Japan in 1990, Fire Emblem was an archetype for the whole genre, establishing gameplay elements that are still used in tactical CRPGs today (although some of these elements were influenced by Ultima III). Combining the basic console RPG concepts from games like Dragon Quest and simple turn-based strategy elements, Nintendo created a hit, which spawned many sequels and imitators.
Among the first imitators was Langrisser by NCS/Masaya, first released for the Mega Drive/Sega Genesis in 1991. It was translated for North American release and retitled Warsong. The Langrisser series differed from Fire Emblem in that it used a general-soldier structure instead of controlling main characters. Master of Monsters was a unique title by SystemSoft. Where Langrisser and Fire Emblem used a square-based grid, Master of Monsters used a hexagonal grid. Players could choose one of four different Lords to defend their Towers and areas on the grid by building an army of creatures to destroy the opposing armies.
The first game in the long-running Super Robot Wars series is  another early example of the genre, released for the Game Boy in 1991. Another influential early tactical RPG was Sega's Shining Force for the Sega Genesis, which was released in 1992. Shining Force used even more console RPG elements than earlier games, allowing the player to walk around towns and talk to people and buy weapons. One game released solely in Japan for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Bahamut Lagoon, began Square's (now Square Enix) famous line of tactical RPGs.
Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen was released for the SNES and is more of a real-time strategy game in which the player forms role-playing video game-like character parties that are moved around a map in real-time.  When two parties meet, the combat plays out with minimal user interaction. A later release, Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, was originally a SNES game that was later ported to the PlayStation. Tactics Ogre is a much more direct influence on the sort of tactical RPGs that gamers recognize today such as Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea: Hour of Darkness. It was also the first to bear the name "Tactics" in the title, a term gamers would come to associate with the genre. Not only are characters moved individually on a grid, but the view is isometric, and the order of combat is calculated for each character individually. The game defined the genre in many ways.

===Stealth games===

While stealth elements have been present in video games as far back as 005, a 1981 video game by Sega,[tpl]cite web|title=005 from Sega|publisher=Popularplay|url=http://www.popularplay.com/a/61/005-from-Sega-.php|accessdate=2009-08-20| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080714052210/http://www.popularplay.com/a/61/005-from-Sega-.php| archivedate = July 14, 2008[/tpl][tpl]KLOV game|id=6759[/tpl]005, Arcade History it was in the 1990s that the stealth game genre was established. Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake was released in 1990 for the MSX2 and was a major improvement over its predecessor, Metal Gear (1987). Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake improved on the first game in many ways, including improved graphics, more player abilities (such as crouching, crawling into hiding spots, disguising in enemy uniforms and cardboard boxes, and distracting guards by knocking on surfaces), improved enemy AI (such as a greater field of vision, the ability to detect various noises, and a three-level security alert), and additions such as a radar, as well as a complex storyline.[tpl]cite web|title=Kojima's Legacy: We reflect on the influence of Hideo Kojima's 20 years in gaming|author=Mark Ryan Sallee|publisher=IGN|url=http://uk.ps2.ign.com/articles/715/715932p1.html|accessdate=2009-08-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Paul Soth|title=GOTW: Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake|publisher=GameSpy|url=http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&id=31|accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl] The game was only released for the MSX2 in Japan, however, which limited its accessibility to gamers in the US.Shoemaker, Brad (1998-09-29). The History of Metal Gear, GameSpot. Retrieved 2009-06-23. An alternative Metal Gear sequel named Snake's Revenge was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in the US instead, also in 1990. Kojima was not involved in the game's development, which was instead conducted by another Konami team. The result was a more action based game than previous installments, and which is not part of the Metal Gear canon.
1998 is seen as a turning point in gaming history because of the release of Metal Gear Solid, as well as Tenchu: Stealth Assassins and Thief: The Dark Project.[tpl]cite web | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E0DA1139F937A15755C0A9629C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | title = GAME THEORY; First Use Your Brain, Then Unleash Your Brawn | author = Charles Herold | date = 2004-06-24 | publisher = New York Times | accessdate = 2009-03-16 [/tpl][tpl]cite book | publisher = Maximum PC | date = August 2004 | title = PCs and Consoles: Unlikely Bedfellows? | author = Thomas L.

===Survival horror===

While elements of the survival horror genre can be traced back to the 1989 Capcom game Sweet Home, which served as a major influence on the genre,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ugo.com/games/survival-horror-games-top-11/?cur=Sweet-home | title = Top 11 Survival Horror Games: Sweet Home | date = 2008-05-21 | publisher = UGO Networks | accessdate = 2009-04-17 [/tpl] it was in the 1990s that survival horror was established as a genre. Another precursor appeared in 1992 when Infogrames released Alone in the Dark, which is also considered a forefather of the genre.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.destructoid.com/how-survival-horror-evolved-itself-into-extinction-114022.phtml | title = How survival horror evolved itself into extinction | date = 2008-12-08 | author = Jim Sterling | publisher = Destructoid | accessdate = 2009-04-16 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090404021610/http://www.destructoid.com/how-survival-horror-evolved-itself-into-extinction-114022.phtml| archivedate= 4 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The game featured a lone protagonist against hordes of monsters, and  made use of traditional adventure game challenges such as puzzle-solving and finding hidden keys to new areas. Graphically, Alone in the Dark utilized static prerendered camera views that were cinematic in nature. Although players had the ability to fight monsters as in action games, players also had the option to evade or block them.
The term "survival horror" was first used by Capcom to market their 1996 release, Resident Evil, thus establishing it as a genre.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/res_evil/index.html | title = The History of Resident Evil | author = Justin Speer and Cliff O'Neill | date = | publisher = GameSpot | accessdate = 2009-04-17 [/tpl]"Enter The Survival Horror... A Resident Evil Retrospective," Game Informer 174 (October 2007): 132-133. The game was influenced by Capcom's Sweet Home, released seven years earlier. Resident Evil also adopted several features seen in Alone in the Dark, including puzzle-solving challenges and fixed cinematic camera angles.[tpl]cite web | author = Brett Todd | url = http://uk.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/pc/history_horror_pt1/p2_01.html | title = A Modern History of Horror Games | publisher = GameSpot | accessdate=2007-03-18[/tpl] The control scheme in Resident Evil also became a staple of the genre, and future titles would imitate its challenge of rationing highly limited resources and items.[tpl]cite web | url = http://retro.ign.com/articles/880/880202p1.html | title = Fear 101: A Beginner's Guide to Survival Horror | publisher = IGN | author = Jim Sterling | date = 2008-06-09 | accessdate = 2009-04-17 [/tpl] The game's commercial success is credited with helping the PlayStation become the dominant game console, and also led to a series of Resident Evil films.[tpl]cite book | title = Horror Film | editor = Steffen Hantke | author = Richard J.

Press of Mississippi | pages= 117–134 | isbn = 978-0-7190-7603-9 [/tpl] Many games have tried to replicate the successful formula seen in Resident Evil, and every subsequent survival horror game has arguably taken a stance in relation to it.
Silent Hill (1999) drew heavily from Resident Evil while using realtime 3D environments in contrast to Resident Evil's pre-rendered graphics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/73/silent-hill/|accessdate=2009-04-17|date=2000-11-24|author=Bobba Fatt|publisher=GamePro|title=Review : Silent Hill (PlayStation)|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081227092743/http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/73/silent-hill/|archivedate=2008-12-27[/tpl] The game was praised for moving away from B movie horror elements to the psychological style seen in art house or Japanese horror films, due to the game's emphasis on a disturbing atmosphere rather than visceral horror.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/oldsite/games/sony/adventure/silent_hill.htm|accessdate=2009-04-17|date=1999-03-01|author=Baldric|title=Game Revolution Review Page - Game Revolution|publisher=Game Revolution [/tpl] The original Silent Hill is considered one of the scariest games of all time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player/14536.html|title=Gametrailers.com - GT Countdown - Top Ten Scariest Games|date=2007-10-27|accessdate=2009-04-17|publisher=GameTrailers| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090412110808/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/14536.html?| archivedate= 12 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
