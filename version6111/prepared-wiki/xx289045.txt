The Kindel Building is a historic automobile showroom at 1095 East Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California. It was built in 1927-28 as James H. Kindel's auto dealership. Pasadena architects Bennett and Haskell designed it in the Italian Renaissance Revival style. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 18, 1996.
The main facade of the building features five arches supported by Corinthian columns and extensive plate glass windows displaying the showroom's interior, and the entrance includes cast iron piers and a transom with an iron grille. The McDaneld Motor Company, the Bush-Morgan Motor Company, and the Howard Motor Company all used the building as a dealership, and it was later used as a body shop.[tpl]cite web|last=Goeken|first=Brian|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Kindel Building|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/96000423.pdf|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=August 13, 2013|date=September 28, 1995[/tpl] Accompanied by photos.
