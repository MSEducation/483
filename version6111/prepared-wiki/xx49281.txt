[[Sinaloa Crow]]

CATEGORIES: Corvus, Endemic birds of Western Mexico, Endemic fauna of Mexico

The Sinaloa Crow (Corvus sinaloae) is a crow native to western Mexico. Visually, it is nearly identical to and the same length (34–38 cm) as the Tamaulipas Crow (Corvus imparatus). It has the same purple-glossed, silky, black  plumage with a black bill, legs, and feet. The two species differ markedly in voice.
It occurs on the Pacific slope from southern Sonora south to Manzanillo. The crow inhabits coastal regions where it forages on the seashore, semi-desert, open woodlands, river banks and hills up to 300 metres or more. It is very common around coastal towns and villages.
Food is taken both on the ground and in trees. On the seashore it can be found turning over objects to find its food and it will take a wide range of invertebrates such as small shellfish, crabs, and insects. Fruits of many types are also taken and eggs and nestlings are also on the menu when opportunity arises.
Often, this bird will nest in a thorny tree or a tall coconut palm where its nest is said to be similar to the American Crow though smaller.
The voice is radically different from the Tamaulipas Crow in that it is quite high-pitched, jay-like, and clear: "ceow". That of the Tamaulipas Crow is a surprisingly low, gruff, frog-like croak.
Another species, the Fish Crow Corvus ossifragus from the southeastern seaboard of the United States is also considered genetically very close to both this species and the Tamaulipas Crow Corvus imparatus and the three are now considered a "Superspecies".
Other names: When lumped with the Tamaulipas Crow, the more inclusive taxon was called Mexican Crow.
