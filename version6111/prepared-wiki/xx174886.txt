[[Peppercombe Castle]]

CATEGORIES: Hill forts in Devon

Peppercombe Castle is an Iron Age Hill fort situated on cliffs to the East of Bucks Mills in North Devon. The remains of the fort are hard to define from maps and it may well be that much of the site has been lost to coastal erosion, but it would seem to have been at around 80Â m above sea level.R.R.Sellman; Aspects of Devon History, Devon Books 1985 - ISBN 0-86114-756-1 - Chapter 2; The Iron Age in Devon.
