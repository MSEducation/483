It then runs along the eastern edge of the Camp Bullis Military Training Reservation.

==History==

FM 2696 was designated in 1961, with a northern terminus at Camp Bullis. Extensions in 1977, 1982, and 1983 brought the route to its current length. In 1995, the portion between IH 410 and Loop 1604 was officially changed to Urban Road 2696 (UR 2696); however, as with other urban roads, TxDOT continues to sign the route with the farm-to-market route marker.[tpl]TxDOT|UR|2696[/tpl]
