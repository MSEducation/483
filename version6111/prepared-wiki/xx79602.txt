[[Thrombocytopenia]]

CATEGORIES: Coagulopathies, Medical signs, Hematopathology

The terms thrombocytopenia and thrombopenia, (British:- thrombocytopaenia and thrombopoenia, respectively), refer to a relative decrease of platelets in blood.
A normal human platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microlitre of blood. These limits are determined by the 2.5th lower and upper percentile, so values outside this range do not necessarily indicate disease. One common definition of thrombocytopenia is a platelet count below 50,000 per microlitre.[tpl]cite journal |pages=1053–8 |doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2008.11.017 |title=Platelet function and the von Willebrand factor antigen in the hepatosplenic form of schistosomiasis mansoni |year=2009 |last1=Correia |first1=Maria C.B. |last2=Domingues |first2=Ana L.C. |last3=Lacerda |first3=Heloisa R. |last4=Santos |first4=Emília M. |last5=MacHado |first5=CíNtia G.F. |last6=Hora |first6=Viviane |last7=Neves |first7=Maria A. |last8=Brito |first8=Anelita |last9=Coêlho |first9=Maria R.C.D. |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene |volume=103 |issue=10 |pmid=19118853 |displayauthors=4 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title=High mortality rate in patients with advanced liver disease independent of exposure to general anesthesia |year=2005 |last1=Cheung |first1=R |last2=McAuley |first2=R |last3=Pollard |first3=J |journal=Journal of Clinical Anesthesia |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=172–6 |pmid=15896582 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinane.2004.06.016 [/tpl]

==Signs and symptoms==

Often, low platelet levels do not lead to clinical problems; rather, they are picked up on a routine full blood count (or complete blood count). Occasionally, there may be bruising, particularly purpura in the forearms, petechia (pinpoint hemorrhages on skin and mucous membranes), nosebleeds, and/or bleeding gums.
Eliciting a full medical history is vital to ensure the low platelet count is not due to a secondary process. It is also important to ensure that the other blood cell types, such as red blood cells and white blood cells, are not also suppressed.
Painless, round and pinpoint (1 to 3 mm in diameter) petechiae usually appear and fade, and sometimes group to form ecchymoses. Larger than petechiae, ecchymoses are purple, blue or yellow-green bruises that vary in size and shape. They can occur anywhere on the body.
A person with this disease may also complain of malaise, fatigue, and general weakness (with or without accompanying blood loss). In acquired thrombocytopenia, the patient's history may include the use of one or several offending drugs.
Inspection typically reveals evidence of bleeding (petechiae or ecchymoses), along with slow, continuous bleeding from any injuries or wounds. Adults may have large, blood-filled bullae in the mouth. If the person's platelet count is between 30,000 and 50,000/mm3, bruising with minor trauma may be expected; if it is between 15,000 and 30,000/mm3, spontaneous bruising will be seen (mostly on the arms and legs).

==Causes==

Decreased platelet counts can be due to a number of disease processes:

===Decreased production===

===Increased destruction===

===Medication-induced===

Thrombocytopenia-inducing medications include:
More extensive lists of thrombocytopenia-inducing medications are available.[tpl]cite web |url=http://moon.ouhsc.edu/jgeorge/drug%20ITP_single04.htm |title=moon.ouhsc.edu |work= |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]Verify credibility|date=May 2011[/tpl]

===Other causes===

===Comparing coagulation tests===

==Diagnosis==

Laboratory tests might include: full blood count, liver enzymes, renal function, vitamin B12 levels, folic acid levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and peripheral blood smear.
If the cause for the low platelet count remains unclear, a bone marrow biopsy is usually recommended, to differentiate whether the low platelet count is due to decreased production or peripheral destruction.
Thrombocytopenia in hospitalized alcoholics may be caused by splenomegaly, folate deficiency, and, most frequently, a direct toxic effect of alcohol on production, survival time, and function of platelets. Platelet count begins to rise after 2 to 5 days' abstinence from alcohol. The condition is generally benign, and clinically significant hemorrhage is rare.
Lab tests to determine the platelet count and clotting function may also be done. In severe thrombocytopenia, a bone marrow study can determine the number, size and maturity of the megakaryocytes (the bone marrow cells that release mature platelets). This information may identify ineffective platelet production as the cause of thrombocytopenia and rule out a malignant disease process at the same time.

==Treatment==

Treatment is guided by etiology and disease severity.  The main concept in treating thrombocytopenia is to eliminate the underlying problem, whether that means discontinuing suspected drugs that cause thrombocytopenia, or treating underlying sepsis.  Diagnosis and treatment of serious thrombocytopenia is usually directed by a hematologist.
Corticosteroids may be used to increase platelet production. Lithium carbonate or folate may also be used to stimulate the bone marrow production of platelets. Platelet transfusions may be used to stop episodic abnormal bleeding caused by a low platelet count. However, if platelet destruction results from an immune disorder, platelet infusions may have only a minimal effect and may be reserved for life-threatening bleeding.
Specific treatment plans often depend on the underlying etiology of the thrombocytopenia.

==Neonatal thrombocytopenia==

Thrombocytopenia affects a few percent of newborns, and its prevalence in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) is high. Normally, its course is mild and it resolves without consequences. Most of the cases of thrombocytopenia affect preterm birth infants and are results of placental insufficiency and/or fetal hypoxia. The other causes are less frequent, e.g. alloimmune, genetic, autoimmune, infection, DIC.[tpl]cite journal |pages=F359–64 |doi=10.1136/fn.88.5.F359 |title=Neonatal thrombocytopenia: causes and management |year=2003 |last1=Roberts |first1=I |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood - Fetal and Neonatal Edition |volume=88 |issue=5 |pmid=12937037 |last2=Murray |first2=NA |pmc=1721612[/tpl]
Thrombocytopenia that starts after the first 72 hours since birth is often the result of underlying sepsis or necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). In the case of infection the PCR tests may be useful for rapid pathogen identification and detection of antibiotic resistance genes. The possible pathogens may be fungus, bacteria and viruses, for example: Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Rubella virus, HIV, Staphylococcus sp.,[tpl]cite journal |pmid=12777561 |year=2003 |last1=Guida |first1=JD |last2=Kunig |first2=AM |last3=Leef |first3=KH |last4=McKenzie |first4=SE |last5=Paul |first5=DA |title=Platelet count and sepsis in very low birth weight neonates: is there an organism-specific response? |volume=111 |issue=6 Pt 1 |pages=1411–5 |journal=Pediatrics |doi=10.1542/peds.111.6.1411[/tpl] Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), Streptococcus viridans,[tpl]cite journal |pmid=2235163 |year=1990 |last1=Klein |first1=JO |title=Bacteriology of neonatal sepsis |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=778 |journal=The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal[/tpl] Listeria monocytogenes,[tpl]cite book |author=D Dzierzanowska |title=Antybiotykoterapia praktyczna |year=2001 |isbn=83-88778-20-X[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,[tpl]cite journal |pmid=3569360 |year=1987 |last1=Pacifico |first1=L |last2=Chiesa |first2=C |last3=Mirabella |first3=S |last4=Panero |first4=A |last5=Midulla |first5=M |title=Early-onset Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis and Yersinia enterocolitica neonatal infection: a unique combination in a preterm infant |volume=146 |issue=2 |pages=192–3 |journal=European journal of pediatrics |doi=10.1007/BF02343233[/tpl] Yersinia enterocolitica, Borrelia burgdorferi, Candida sp., Toxoplasma gondii.

The interleukin-11 is being investigated as a potential drug for aiding thrombocytopenia management, especially in the cases of sepsis or necrotising enterocolitis (NEC).

==Veterinary treatment==

Thrombocytopenia caused by Feline Leukemia Virus and Feline immunodeficiency virus retroviral infections is treated with Lymphocyte T-Cell Immune Modulator.
