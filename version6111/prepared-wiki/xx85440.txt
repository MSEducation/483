Benefit is the third album by Jethro Tull, released in April 1970. It was the first Tull album to include pianist and organist John Evan – though he was not yet a permanent member of the group – and the last to include bass guitarist Glenn Cornick. It reached No. 3 in the UK album charts.Jethro Tull at Chart Archive. Retrieved 31 October 2012.
More hard-rocking and transcended from blues influences than its predecessor, Stand Up (1969), it also incorporated more advanced studio techniques, such as backward-recorded flute (on "With You There to Help Me") and piano, and sped-up guitar (on "Play in Time").
Ian Anderson said that Benefit was a 'guitar riff' album, made in a year when the musical groups were working on the idea that had come to prominence with bands like Cream, Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin. Anderson also noted that Benefit is "a rather dark and stark album, and although it has a few songs on it that are rather okay, I don't think it has the breadth, variety or detail that Stand Up has. But it was an evolution in terms of the band playing as 'a band.'". With the work on more studio effects and the addition of another band member (Evan), Anderson consider the album "a natural part of the group's evolution".http://www.tullpress.com/gwsept99.htm
The album have a American tour to supported it, songs like "With you there to help me" and to "To cry you a song" became part of the next year's repertoire of the band. Bassist Glenn Cornick said that, at this point: "I don't think the band was ever better than we were at that time."http://psychedelicbaby.blogspot.com.br/2011/12/glenn-cornick-interview-about-jethro.html
