European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) is a standard for comparing the study attainment and performance of students of higher education across the European Union and other collaborating European countries.

The ECTS will be complemented by the European credit transfer system for vocational education and training (ECVET) which the ministers are responsible for vocational training in 32 European countries agreed to develop in the Maastricht Communiqué of 14 December 2004.
