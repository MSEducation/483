Marcia Joan Brown (born July 13, 1918) is an American writer and illustrator of more than 30 children's books. She has won three annual Caldecott Medals from the American Library Association, recognizing the year's best U.S. picture book illustration, and the ALA's Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal for her career contribution to children's literature. Many of her titles have been published in translation, including Afrikaans, German, Japanese, Spanish and Xhosa-Bantu editions.

==Life==

Born in Rochester, New York, she enrolled in the New York State College for Teachers, predecessor to the University at Albany. She taught at Cornwall High School in New York City, where she began her writing career. Her first book was The Little Carousel, a 32-page picture book that she both wrote and illustrated, published by Scribner's in 1946.
Growing up during the Depression, Brown considered becoming a doctor. She decided, however, to take up teaching and, later, writing.

==Awards==

For her contribution as a children's illustrator Brown was U.S. nominee in both 1966 and 1976 for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest international recognition available to creators of children's books. She received the 1977 Regina Medal from the Catholic Libraries Association for "continued, distinguished contribution to children's literature without regard to the nature of the contribution" and the 1992 Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal from the American Library Association for "substantial and lasting contributions to children's literature"; it was then conferred every three years.
From 1955 to 1983 Brown won three Caldecott Medals, the annual American Library Association award to the illustrator of the year's "most distinguished American picture book for children" (only David Wiesner has also won three). She had been a runner-up six times from 1948 to 1954; the six works are now called Caldecott Honor Books and may display silver rather than gold seals.
