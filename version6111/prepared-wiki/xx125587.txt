==History==

Brisbane man George Raff bought some of the land held by the failed Caboolture Cotton Company, calling it "Moray Field", derived from Raff's native Morayshire in Scotland.  It was often written as "Morayfields" and, from 1881, became "Morayfield".Place Names :: Caboolture District Libraries
Until the mid-1980s, Morayfield remained a rural area consisting of a small dairy holding and small crop farming enterprises.  However, with the population pressure caused by the rapid growth of the greater Brisbane area, it has since suffered to some degree from random or unplanned residential development and rapid population growth.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl]  It is a thriving retail and service industry commercial center.
Greg Norman is currently involved in a large-scale plan to radically alter the eastern fringes of Morayfield, with land to the east of the Bruce Highway and south of the Caboolture River is to be turned into medium density residential lots.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl]
