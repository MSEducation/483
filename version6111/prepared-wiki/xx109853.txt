[[Romanization of Arabic]]

CATEGORIES: Arabic orthography, Romanization of Arabic, Romanization

Different approaches and methods for the romanization of Arabic exist. They vary in the way that they address the inherent problems of rendering written and spoken Arabic in the Latin script. Examples of such problems are the symbols for Arabic phonemes that do not exist in English or other European languages; the means of representing the Arabic definite article, which is always spelled the same way in written Arabic but has numerous pronunciations in the spoken language depending on context; and the representation of short vowels (usually i u or e o, accounting for variations such as Muslim/Moslem or Mohammed/Muhammad/Mohamed).

==Method==

Romanization is often termed "transliteration", but this is not technically correct.  Transliteration is the direct representation of foreign letters using Latin symbols, while most systems for romanizing Arabic are actually transcription systems, which represent the sound of the language.  As an example, the above rendering [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|munāẓarat al-ḥurūf al-ʻarabīyah[/tpl] of the [tpl]lang-ar|مناظرة الحروف العربية[/tpl] is a transcription, indicating the pronunciation; an example transliteration would be [tpl]transl|ar|mnaẓrḧ alḥrwf alʻrbyḧ[/tpl].

==Romanization issues==

Any romanization system has to make a number of decisions which are dependent on its intended field of application.

===Vowels===

One basic problem is that written Arabic is normally unvocalized; i.e., many of the vowels are not written out, and must be supplied by a reader familiar with the language. Hence unvocalized Arabic writing does not give a reader unfamiliar with the language sufficient information for accurate pronunciation.  As a result, a pure transliteration, e.g., rendering [tpl]lang|ar|قطر[/tpl] as [tpl]transl|ar|qṭr[/tpl], is meaningless to an untrained reader.  For this reason, transcriptions are generally used that add vowels, e.g. [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|qaṭar[/tpl]. However, unvocalized systems match exactly to written Arabic, unlike vocalized systems such as Arabic chat, which some claim detracts from one's ability to spell.http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/education/arabizi-sparks-concern-among-educators-1.1181529

===Transliteration vs. transcription===

Most uses of romanization call for transcription rather than transliteration: Instead of transliterating each written letter, they try to reproduce the sound of the words according to the orthography rules of the target language: [tpl]unicode|Qaṭar[/tpl].  This applies equally to scientific and popular applications.  A pure transliteration, for example, would need to omit vowels (e.g. [tpl]unicode|qṭr [/tpl]), making the result difficult to interpret except for a subset of trained readers fluent in Arabic.  Even if vowels are added, a transliteration system would still need to distinguish between multiple ways of spelling the same sound in the Arabic script, e.g. [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|alif [/tpl] [tpl]lang|ar|2=ا[/tpl] vs. [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|alif maqṣūrah[/tpl] [tpl]lang|ar|ى[/tpl] for the sound [tpl]IPA|/aː/[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|ā[/tpl], and the six different ways ([tpl]lang|ar|ء إ أ آ ؤ ئ[/tpl]) of writing the glottal stop (hamza, usually transcribed [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|ʼ [/tpl]).  This sort of detail is unneeded and needlessly confusing, except in a very few situations (e.g., typesetting text in the Arabic script).
Most issues related to the romanization of Arabic are about transliterating vs. transcribing; others, about what should be romanized:
A transcription may reflect the language as spoken, typically rendering names, for example, by the people of Baghdad (Baghdad Arabic), or the official standard (Literary Arabic) as spoken by a preacher in the mosque or a TV newsreader. A transcription is free to add phonological (such as vowels) or morphological (such as word boundaries) information. Transcriptions will also vary depending on the writing conventions of the target language; compare English Omar Khayyam with German Omar Chajjam, both for [tpl]lang|ar|عمر خيام[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|/ʕumar xajjaːm/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-ar|ˈʕomɑr xæjˈjæːm|[/tpl] (unvocalized [tpl]transl|ar|ʿmr ḫyām[/tpl], vocalized [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|ʻUmar Khayyām[/tpl]).
A transliteration is ideally fully reversible: a machine should be able to transliterate it back into Arabic. A transliteration can be considered as flawed for any one of the following reasons:
A fully accurate transcription may not be necessary for native Arabic speakers, as they would be able to pronounce names and sentences correctly anyway, but it can be very useful for those not fully familiar with spoken Arabic and who are familiar with the Roman alphabet.  An accurate transliteration serves as a valuable stepping stone for learning, pronouncing correctly, and distinguishing phonemes.  It is a useful tool for anyone who is familiar with the sounds of Arabic but not fully conversant in the language.
One criticism is that a fully accurate system would require special learning that most do not have to actually pronounce names correctly, and that with a lack of a universal romanization system they will not be pronounced correctly by non-native speakers anyway.  The precision will be lost if special characters are not replicated and if a reader is not familiar with Arabic pronunciation.
