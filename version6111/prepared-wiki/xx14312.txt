</ref> So, under ideal viewing conditions, the binary system can be resolved by a telescope with a 7&nbsp;mm aperture.<ref group=note>Per the [[Angular resolution|Rayleigh criterion]]:
well within the capability for aperture of typical binoculars, though to resolve the binary these need a steady mount and some 10x magnification. With 61 Cyg's A/B separation of 28 arc-seconds, 10x magnification would give an apparent separation of 280 arc-seconds, above the generally-regarded eye resolution limit of 4 arc-minutes or 240 arc-seconds.

==Properties==

Although it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, 61 Cygni is in fact a widely separated binary system, composed of two K class (orange) main sequence stars, 61 Cygni A and 61 Cygni B. The brighter star 61 Cygni A is of apparent magnitude 5.2, the fainter 61 Cygni B is 6.1. Both appear to be old-disk stars,[ref]
