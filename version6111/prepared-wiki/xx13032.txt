CATEGORIES: 9

Year 9 (IX) was a common year starting on Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Sabinus and Camerinus (or, less frequently, year 762 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 9 for this year has been used since the late medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
