Provincial museums of Canada are museums maintained by the provinces of Canada to preserve their local history and culture.  They are the equivalent to national museums operated by nation-states.
In the mostly French-speaking province of Quebec, the provincial government uses the term "national" to refer to provincial museums, reflecting the strength of Quebec nationalism.
Many provinces have separate facilities for history and natural history museums, art galleries, and archives.  In the case of Newfoundland and Labrador, all these functions are housed in one complex, The Rooms, in St. John's
