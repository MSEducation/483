==Development==

Chaos;Head Love Chu Chu! is the third collaborative work between 5pb. and Nitroplus after Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate. Character design is handled by Mutsumi Sasaki and the art of the game is being provided by Yukihiro Matsuo. The scenario will be written by Naotaka Hayashi and the producer is Tatsuya Matsuhara. Product design will be handled by Choco. All of the staff above took part in the original Chaos;Head.
According to Tatsuya, the project was conceived during the development of Steins;Gate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.dengeki.com/elem/000/000/228/228872/|title=気になるエリンルートは？ 『CHAOS；HEAD らぶChu☆Chu！』インタビュー!!|trans_title=What about that Erin route? Chaos;Head Love Chu Chu! interview!!|publisher=Dengeki|date=2010-01-22|accessdate=2010-01-30[/tpl] The Love Chu Chu! part of the game's name was actually narrowed down from a list of about one hundred candidates. When told that it was rather embarrassing to say the title's name and asked about an abbreviation, Tatsuya jokingly insisted that the interviewer had to say "Love Chu Chu!" in its entirety. Tatsuya however did note that some of the staff members abbreviate it as "CHLCC" while others call it [tpl]Nihongo|"Kao Chu"|カオChu[/tpl].
