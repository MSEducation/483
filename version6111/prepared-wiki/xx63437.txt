===Beginnings and heroin chic===

Moss was discovered in 1988 at the age of 14 by Sarah Doukas, the founder of Storm Model Management, at JFK Airport in New York City,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/celebrity/a-z/163221/kate-moss.html |title=Kate Moss |publisher=Marie Claire UK |accessdate=28 May 2009[/tpl] after a holiday in the Bahamas.

==Controversy==

The contract was reportedly worth £4 million a year.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aKRbq2pbajuc&refer=uk|title=Kate Moss Ads Scrapped by H&M After Cocaine Pictures (Update1) |date=20 September 2005 |accessdate=29 January 2007|author=Britt, Chantal |publisher=Bloomberg [/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=May 2009[/tpl] A day later, Chanel announced that it would not be renewing its contract with Moss, which was set to expire that October, although the company said that its decision had nothing to do with the drug scandal.

Moss continued to appear in major ad campaigns during this period for Dior. She was on the cover of the November 2005 W and also appeared inside in a multi-page fashion shoot.
