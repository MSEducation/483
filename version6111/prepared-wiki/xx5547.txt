Kuwait is a small, relatively open economy. The Kuwaiti currency is the highest-valued currency unit in the world.http://www.siliconindia.com/finance/news/10-Most-Valuable-Currencies-in-the-World-nid-109953.html  Kuwait has the second-most free economy in the Middle East.[tpl]cite web|last=Alt|first=Robert|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/country.cfm?id=Kuwait|title=Index of Economic Freedom|work=Heritage.org|accessdate=28 June 2010[/tpl] 57% of Kuwait's GDP comes from non-oil industries (mostly business services, manufacturing, retail trade, financial institutions, construction, transport and real estate). Petroleum accounts for 43% of GDP, 87% of export revenues, and 75% of government income.Kuwait Economic Report - Pages 5-6http://www.omc.ap.gov.in/kuwait.aspx Kuwait also export plant fertilizers.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2049.html#ku 
Kuwait has little arable land, thus preventing reliance on the agriculture sector. Kuwait's first free-trade zone was inaugurated in 1999 and will continue discussions with foreign oil companies to develop fields in the northern part of the country. Kuwait's other industries include construction, cement, water desalination, agriculture, construction materials and financial services. Kuwait has a well-developed banking system. The National Bank of Kuwait is the largest bank in the country and one of the largest in the Arab world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.q8daily.com/national-bank-of-kuwait |title=Kuwait National Bank |publisher=Q8daily.com |date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=24 October 2010[/tpl] 

==History==

===Economic prosperity===

In the eighteenth century, Kuwait prospered and rapidly became the principal commercial center for the transit of goods between India, Muscat, Baghdad and Arabia.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.kw/books?id=qVBjiaTROe8C&pg=PA222&dq|title=Shadows on the Sand: The Memoirs of Sir Gawain Bell|author=Sir Gawain Bell|page=222|year=1983[/tpl] By the mid 1700s, Kuwait had already established itself as the major trading route from the Persian Gulf to Aleppo. Between the years 1775 and 1779, the Indian trade routes with Baghdad, Aleppo, Smyrna and Constantinople were diverted to Kuwait due to the Persian occupation of Basra. The Persian invasion of Basra in 1775 greatly benefited Kuwait's economy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R0NH1CbXf24C&printsec=frontcover|title=Constancy and Change in Contemporary Kuwait City: The Socio-cultural Dimensions of the Kuwait Courtyard and Diwaniyya|work= Mohammad Khalid A. Al-Jassar|year=2009|pages=66–71[/tpl]
In addition to the diversion of trade routes, many of Basra's leading merchants moved to Kuwait. The English Factory was diverted to Kuwait in 1792, which consequently expanded Kuwait's resources beyond fishing and pearling. The English Factory secured the sea routes between Kuwait, India and the east coasts of Africa. This allowed Kuwaiti vessels to venture all the way to the pearling banks of Sri Lanka and trade goods with India and East Africa. Kuwait was the center of boat construction in the Gulf region.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gwvsxqx7ewcC&pg=PA151&dq|title=Midnight Tales: A Woman's Journey Through the Middle East|author=Rosina-Fawzia B. Al-Rawi|page=151|year=2006[/tpl] Before the dominance of steamships, Kuwaiti wooden boats were considered superior in ocean travel. Ship vessels made in Kuwait carried the bulk of international trade between India, East Africa, and Red Sea trade ports.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.kw/books?id=hcMmAQAAMAAJ&q|title=The Arabian Peninsula|author=Richard Harlakenden Sanger |page=150|year=1970[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.kw/books?id=logbAAAAIAAJ|title=Bijdragen tot de taal-, land- en volkenkunde, Volume 130|author=M. Nijhoff |page=111|year=1974[/tpl] Boats made in Kuwait were capable of sailing up to China, thus Kuwaitis were players in world trade.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eUVop4Jd5L8C&pg=PR13&dq|title=Doctor Mary in Arabia: Memoirs|author=Mary Bruins Allison|page=1|year=1994[/tpl] Kuwait's boat building industry was well known for its design and craftsmanship. Kuwaitis were regarded the best shipbuilders and sailors in the Gulf.[tpl]cite web|url=http://digitalarchive.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&context=history_theses|title= The Shia Migration from Southwestern Iran to Kuwait: Push-Pull Factors during the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries|work=Georgia State University|pages=67 & 72|year=2012[/tpl] The East India Company officer, Lewis Pelly regarded Kuwaitis the best sailors in the Gulf.
Kuwait was also the center for all caravans carrying goods between Basra, Baghdad and Aleppo. Kuwait partly functioned as a haven for merchants from Basra fleeing Ottoman government persecution.[tpl]cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g5MewSBHkG4C&pg=PA114&dq|title=The Politics of Regional Trade in Iraq, Arabia, and the Gulf, 1745-1900 |work=Hala Mundhir Fattah |year=1997 |page=114[/tpl] Kuwait was also significant in the horse trade.[tpl]cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g5MewSBHkG4C&pg=PA181&lpg=PA181&dq|title=The Politics of Regional Trade in Iraq, Arabia, and the Gulf, 1745-1900 |work=Hala Mundhir Fattah |year=1997 |page=181[/tpl] Horses were regularly shipped by the way of sailing boats from Kuwait. In the mid 19th century, it was estimated that Kuwait was exporting an average of 800 horses to India annually.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R0NH1CbXf24C&pg=PA68&dq|title=Constancy and Change in Contemporary Kuwait City: The Socio-cultural Dimensions of the Kuwait Courtyard and Diwaniyya|work=Mohammad Khalid A. Al-Jassar|year=2009|pages=68[/tpl]
The strategic location of Kuwait and geopolitical turbulence in the region helped foster economic prosperity in Kuwait. Kuwait became wealthy due to Basra's instability.[tpl]cite web |url=http://books.google.com.kw/books?id=iT_8KzTECwMC&pg=PA18&dq|title=Waqai-i manazil-i Rum: Tipu Sultan's mission to Constantinople |work= Mohibbul Hasan |year= 2007 |page=18[/tpl] It was estimated that Kuwait's sea trade reached 16 million Bombay rupees by 1800, a substantial amount at that time. Economic prosperity during the late 18th century attracted many immigrants from Iran and Iraq to Kuwait. Kuwait's pre-oil population was ethnically diverse.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pubcouncil.kuniv.edu.kw/jgaps/home.aspx?id=8&Root=yes&authid=1383 |title=The Hypothetical Population Pattern of the Population Growth of the State of Kuwait in the pre-oil era |publisher=Kuwait University |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26[/tpl]
In the early 20th century, Kuwait was dubbed the "Marsielles of the Gulf" because its economic vitality attracted a large variety of people. In a good year, Kuwait's annual revenue actually came up to 100,000 riyals, the governor of Basra considered Kuwait's annual revenue an astounding figure. 
Kuwait was a central part of the trade in frankincense from Oman, textiles from China, and Indian spices, all destined for lucrative European markets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geoexpro.com/article/Kuwait_A_Trading_City/e069aac2.aspx|title=Kuwait: A Trading City|publisher=Eleanor Archer|year=2013[/tpl] In the first decades of the twentieth century, Kuwait had a well-established elite: wealthy trading families who were linked by marriage and shared economic interests.[tpl]cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=D8di8GN_hKsC&pg=PA37&dq|title=Oil and Politics in the Gulf: Rulers and Merchants in Kuwait and Qatar |work=Jill Crystal |year=1995 |page=37[/tpl] The elite were long-settled, urban, Sunni families, the majority of which claim descent from the original 30 Bani Utubi families. The wealthiest families were trade merchants who acquired their wealth from long-distance commerce, shipbuilding and pearling. They were a cosmopolitan elite, they traveled extensively to India, Africa and Europe. The elite educated their sons abroad more than other Gulf Arab elite. Western visitors noted that the Kuwaiti elite used European office systems, typewriters and followed European culture with curiosity. The richest families were involved in general trade. The merchant families of Al-Ghanim and Al-Hamad were estimated to be worth millions before the 1940s.

===Collapse of economy===

In the 20th century, Kuwait immensely declined in regional economic importance, mainly due to many trade blockades and the world economic depression. Before Mary Bruins Allison visited Kuwait in 1934, Kuwait lost its prominence in long distance trade. During World War I, the British Empire imposed a trade blockade against Kuwait because Kuwait's ruler supported the Ottoman Empire.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f25h1qJLtnAC&pg=PA142&dq|title=A Political Chronology of the Middle East|author=David Lea|page=142|year=2001[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nKBn1AOZUrwC&pg=PA104&dq|title=The Arabian Mission's Story: In Search of Abraham's Other Son|author=Lewis R. Scudder|page=104|year=1998[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jqMLNJ3tUYMC&pg=PA13&dq|title=The Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and the Economics of the New World Order|author=Mary Ann Tétreault|pages=2–3|year=1995[/tpl] The British economic blockade heavily damaged Kuwait's economy.
The Great Depression negatively impacted Kuwait's economy starting in the late 1920s. International trading was one of Kuwait's main sources of income before oil. Kuwaiti merchants were mostly intermediary merchants. As a result of European decline of demand for goods from India and Africa, the economy of Kuwait suffered. The decline in international trade resulted in an increase in gold smuggling by Kuwaiti ships to India. Some Kuwaiti merchant families became rich due to gold smuggling to India.
Kuwait's pearling industry also collapsed as a result of the worldwide economic depression. At its height, Kuwait's pearling industry led the world's luxury market, regularly sending out between 750 and 800 ship vessels to meet the European elite's need for luxuries pearls. During the economic depression, luxuries like pearls were in little demand. The Japanese invention of cultured pearls also contributed to the collapse of Kuwait's pearling industry.
Following the Kuwait–Najd War of 1919-1920, Ibn Saud imposed a tight trade blockade against Kuwait from the years 1923 until 1937.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R0NH1CbXf24C&pg=PA80&dq|title=Constancy and Change in Contemporary Kuwait City: The Socio-cultural Dimensions of the Kuwait Courtyard and Diwaniyya|author= Mohammad Khalid A. Al-Jassar|year=2009|pages=80[/tpl] The goal of the Saudi economic and military attacks on Kuwait was to annex as much of Kuwait's territory as possible. At the Uqair conference in 1922, the boundaries of Kuwait and Najd were set. Kuwait had no representative at the Uqair conference. Ibn Saud persuaded Sir Percy Cox to give him two-thirds of Kuwait's territory. More than half of Kuwait was lost due to Uqair. After the Uqair conference, Kuwait was still subjected to a Saudi economic blockade and intermittent Saudi raiding.
In 1937, Freya Stark wrote about the extent of poverty in Kuwait at the time:[tpl]cquote|Poverty has settled in Kuwait more heavily since my last visit five years ago, both by sea, where the pearl trade continues to decline, and by land, where the blockade established by Saudi Arabia now harms the merchants.[/tpl]
Some prominent merchant families left Kuwait in the early 1930s due to the prevalence of economic hardship. At the time of the discovery of oil in 1937, most of Kuwait's inhabitants were impoverished.

===Discovery of oil===

In 1937, the 15 year trade blockades against Kuwait were lifted and Kuwait's large oil reserves were discovered by the US-British Kuwait Oil Company. Exploration was delayed until after World War II, the use of oil only began in 1951. Between World War II and 1948, Kuwait's inhabitants were still largely impoverished. A few years after the end of World War II, oil exploration finally began. In 1951, a major public-work programme began to enable Kuwaitis to enjoy a better standard of living. By 1952, the country became the largest exporter of oil in the Persian Gulf region. This massive growth attracted many foreign workers, especially from India.

==Overview==

Kuwait is one of the wealthiest countries in the world.http://www.gfmag.com/tools/global-database/economic-data/12148-the-richest-countries-in-the-world.html#axzz2WmuojI2u Current GDP per capita reached astonishing peak growth of 439% in the 1970s.GDP: GDP per capita, current US dollars But this proved unsustainable and contracted by 58% in the 1980s. However rising global oil demand helped register growth of 91% in the 1990s. Diversification is a long-term issue for this over-exposed economy.

==Macro-economic trend==

This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Kuwait at market prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of Kuwaiti Dinars.Select Country or Country Groups
For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US Dollar is exchanged at 0.288 Kuwaiti Dinars only. Mean wages were $27.83 per manhour in 2009. As for skilled and experienced Kuwaiti (Engineers, Doctors, and Managers) the average monthly salary is hiked up tremendously, to an average of $10,000+ a month excluding living and other benefits. Kuwait is a tax free country so all the above figures reflect actual take home numbers.
Kuwait is a small country with massive oil reserves, whose economy has been traditionally dominated by the state and its oil industry. During the 1970s, Kuwait benefited from the dramatic rise in oil prices, which Kuwait actively promoted through its membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The economy suffered from the triple shock of the 1982 Souk Al-Manakh stock market crash, the mid-1980s drop in oil prices, and the 1990 Iraqi invasion and occupation. The Kuwaiti Government-in-exile depended upon its $100 billion in overseas investments during the Iraqi occupation in order to help pay for the reconstruction. Thus, by 1993, this balance was cut to less than half of its pre-invasion level. The wealth of Kuwait is based primarily on oil and capital reserves, and the Iraqi occupation severely damaged both.
In the closing hours of the Gulf War in February 1991, the Iraqi occupation forces set ablaze or damaged 749 of Kuwait's oil wells. All of these fires were extinguished within a year. Production has been restored, and refineries and facilities have been modernized. Oil exports surpassed their pre-invasion levels in 1993 with production levels only constrained by OPEC quotas.

==Oil==

In 1934, the Emir of Kuwait granted an oil concession to the Kuwait Oil Co. (KOC), jointly owned by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (later British Petroleum Company) and Gulf Oil Corporation In 1976, the Kuwaiti Government nationalized KOC. The following year, Kuwait took over onshore production in the Divided Zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. KOC produces jointly there with Texaco, Inc., which, by its 1984 purchase of Getty Oil Co., acquired the Saudi Arabian onshore concession in the Divided Zone.
In the Offshore Divided Zone, the Arabian Oil Co. – 80% owned by Japanese interests and 10% each by the Kuwaiti and Saudi Governments – has produced on behalf of both countries since 1961. The original concession agreements will expire in January 2003; negotiations to replace the concession with a technical service agreement should be completed in 2002.
The Kuwait Petroleum Corporation. (KPC), an integrated international oil company, is the parent company of the government's operations in the petroleum sector, and includes Kuwait Oil Company, which produced oil and gas; Kuwait National Petroleum Co., refining and domestic sales; Petrochemical Industries Co., producing ammonia and urea; Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co., with several concessions in developing countries; Kuwait Oil Tanker Co.; and Santa Fe International Corp. The latter, purchased outright in 1982, gives KPC a worldwide presence in the petroleum industry.
KPC also has purchased from Gulf Oil Co. refineries and associated service stations in the Benelux nations and Scandinavia, as well as storage facilities and a network of service stations in Italy. In 1987, KPC bought a 19% share in British Petroleum, which was later reduced to 10%. KPC markets its products in Europe under the brand Q8 and is interested in the markets of the United States and Japan.
Kuwait has about [tpl]convert|94|Goilbbl|km3[/tpl] of recoverable oil reserves. Estimated capacity, before the war, was about [tpl]convert|2.4|Moilbbl/d[/tpl]. During the Iraqi occupation, Kuwait's oil-producing capacity was reduced to practically nothing. However, tremendous recovery and improvements have been made. Oil production was [tpl]convert|1.5|Moilbbl/d[/tpl] by the end of 1992, and pre-war capacity was restored in 1993. Kuwait's production capacity is estimated to be [tpl]convert|2.5|Moilbbl/d[/tpl]. Kuwait plans to increase its capacity to [tpl]convert|3.5|Moilbbl/d[/tpl] by 2005.

==Social benefits==

==Diversification==

Industry in Kuwait consists of several large export-oriented petrochemical units, oil refineries, and a range of small manufacturers. It also includes large water desalinization, ammonia, desulfurization, fertilizer, brick, block, and cement plants. During the invasion, the Iraqis looted nearly all movable items of worth, especially high-technology items and small machinery. Much of this has been replaced with newer equipment. Kuwait also export plant fertilizers.
Diversification of the economy into manufacturing industries remain a long-term issue.

==Agriculture==

Agriculture accounts for 1% of Kuwait's economy and 8% of the gross domestic product.http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:bU1BhkTmKQEJ:neareast.fao.org/Download.ashx%3FFile%3DFCKupload/File/NENAPGRN/kuwait.pdf+&cd=7&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=kw The agricultural sector provides fruit and vegetables for sale in the country's supermarkets. Agriculture is limited by the lack of water and arable land. The government has experimented in growing food through hydroponics and carefully managed farms. However, most of the soil which was suitable for farming in south central Kuwait was destroyed when Iraqi troops set fire to oil wells in the area and created vast "oil lakes". Fish and shrimp are plentiful in territorial waters, and largescale commercial fishing has been undertaken locally and in the Indian Ocean.

==Shipping==

The Kuwait Oil Tankers Co. has 35 crude oil and refined product carriers and is the largest tanker company in an OPEC country. Kuwait also is a member of the United Arab Shipping Company.

==External trade and finance==

The Kuwaiti dinar is a strong currency pegged to a basket of currencies in which the U.S. dollar has the most weight. Kuwait ordinarily runs a balance-of-payments surplus.
Government revenues are dependent on oil revenues. Kuwait's fiscal surplus in 2000 was some 15% of GDP, while it reversed to a deficit of more than 2% of GDP in 2001 on sliding oil prices.
The government's two reserve funds: the Fund for Future Generations and the General Reserve Fund, which totalled nearly $100 billion prior to the invasion in 1990, were the primary source of capital for the Kuwaiti Government during the war. While these funds were depleted to $40–$50 billion after the war, they currently are estimated around $208 billion. The bulk of this reserve is invested in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, and Southeast Asia. In order of importance, foreign assets are believed to be invested in stocks and bonds, fixed yield instruments (mostly short term), and real estate. Kuwait follows a generally conservative investment policy.
Kuwait has been a major source of foreign economic assistance to other states through the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, an autonomous state institution created in 1961 on the pattern of Western and international development agencies. In 1974, the fund's lending mandate was expanded to include all – not just Arab – developing countries.
Over the years aid was provided to Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, as well as the Palestine Liberation Organization. During the Iran-Iraq war, significant Kuwaiti aid was given to the Iraqis. The Kuwait Fund issued loans and technical assistance grants totaling over $520 million during its fiscal year ending 30 June 2000.
The stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Kuwait was valued at $130,080 million in 2005 by the World Bank.http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20394793~menuPK:1192714~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html
