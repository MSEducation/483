==Battle Cry==

"On, Wisconsin!" was the cry that Arthur MacArthur, Jr. used in the Battle of Chattanooga at Missionary Ridge during the American Civil War. He seized the regimental colors, and rallied his regiment with "On, Wisconsin!", for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.

==University of Wisconsin lyrics==

On, Wisconsin! On, Wisconsin!

Plunge right through that line!
*
Run the ball clear down the field,
*
(originally "Run the ball clear 'round Chicago")

A touchdown sure this time. (U rah rah)

On, Wisconsin! On, Wisconsin!

Fight on for her fame

Fight! Fellows! - fight, fight, fight!

We'll win this game.
On, Wisconsin! On, Wisconsin!

Stand up, Badgers, sing!

"Forward" is our driving spirit,

Loyal voices ring.

On, Wisconsin! On, Wisconsin!

Raise her glowing flame

Stand, Fellows, let us now

Salute her name! 

 Sometimes these lyrics are altered to say "Run the ball clear down the field, boys--touchdown sure this time!"UWBadgers.com Mobile

==State song lyrics==

On, Wisconsin! On, Wisconsin!

Grand old Badger State!

We, thy loyal sons and daughters,

Hail thee, good and great.

On, Wisconsin! On, Wisconsin!

Champion of the right,

"Forward", our motto,

God will give thee might!Chapter 1, Section 9, Wisconsin State Statutes
