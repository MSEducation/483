==History==

A connection between Goodsprings and U.S. Route 91 (and SR 6) at Jean first appeared on official Nevada state maps in 1933. At that time, it was an unimproved county road.[tpl]cite map |publisher=Nevada Department of Highways |title=Official Road Map of Nevada |url=http://contentdm.library.unr.edu/u?/hmaps,461 |year=1933 |accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl] By 1935, that road was incorporated into State Route 53, which connected Jean to Goodsprings before curving southwest towards the California state line.[tpl]cite map |publisher=Nevada Department of Highways |title=Official Road Map of the state of Nevada |url=http://contentdm.library.unr.edu/u?/hmaps,465 |year=1935 |accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl] By 1941, the first [tpl]convert|7|mi|km[/tpl] of the SR 53 reaching Goodsprings was paved, with the remaining [tpl]convert|13|mi|km[/tpl] in to Sandy Valley and on to California remained unimproved.[tpl]cite map |publisher=Nevada Department of Highways |title=Official Road Map of the state of Nevada |url=http://contentdm.library.unr.edu/u?/hmaps,475 |year=1941 |accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl]
SR 53 remained unchanged until the 1976 renumbering of Nevada's state highway system that was authorized on July 1, 1976. In that process, the paved portion of the highway between Jean and Goodsprings was renumbered to State Route 161. This change was first seen on the 1978-1979 edition of the official state map[tpl]cite book |title=Nevada State Maintained Highways: Descriptions, Index and Maps |year=January 2001 |publisher=Nevada Department of Transportation |page=99 [/tpl][tpl]cite map |publisher=Nevada Department of Highways |title=Official Highway Map of Nevada |url=http://contentdm.library.unr.edu/u?/hmaps,535 |date=1978 |section=F6 |accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl] The remaining section of SR 53 to Sandy Valley continued to be shown on the state map, but was dropped from the state system by 1982.[tpl]cite map |publisher=Nevada Department of Transportation |title=Official Highway Map of Nevada |url=http://contentdm.library.unr.edu/u?/hmaps,53 |date=1982 |section=F6 |accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl] Sandy Valley is now reachable via the Sandy Valley road turnoff from SR 161, prior to entering Goodsprings.
