Black Family Channel (founded in 1999 as MBC Network) was a network for African American families and the only wholly black-owned and operated cable television network (BET, as seen below, is owned by Viacom; TV One by Comcast & Radio One; Aspire by Magic Johnson & Intermedia Partners; Bounce TV by Bounce Media LLC; & Revolt by Comcast & Sean "Diddy" Combs). The network's schedule included a variety of programs including religious programs, sports, music, talk shows, and children's programs.
The network was started by noted Florida attorney & philanthropist Willie E. Gary, former all-star baseball player Cecil Fielder, four-time heavyweight boxing champ Evander Holyfield, Marlon Jackson of The Jackson 5, and broadcast television veteran Alvin James through their business venture Major Broadcasting Corporation.[tpl]cite web|last=McGee|first=Sherri|title=Broadcasting the Gospel|url=http://www.blackenterprise.com/mag/broadcasting-the-gospel/|work=Black Enterprise|publisher=BlackEnterprise.com|accessdate=1 November 1999[/tpl] 
The channel started off as Major Broadcasting Cable (MBC) Network. The name was rebranded Black Family Channel on October 1, 2004 in hopes that it would better identify the channel's content.[tpl]cite web|last=Harris|first=Hamil|title=MBC Network Changes Name To Black Family Channel|url=http://www.blackenterprise.com/mag/mbc-network-changes-name-to-black-family-channel/|work=Black Enterprise|publisher=BlackEnterprise.com|accessdate=1 September 2004[/tpl] 
BFC would effectively be run by actor/director Robert Townsend, who developed original programming for the network, including its most notable effortâ€”the children's educational game show, The Thousand Dollar Bee, in which children would participate in tournament-style rounds of spelling challenges toward which the champion would receive a $1000 bond for his or her college education.
Unlike its primary rival, the Viacom-owned Black Entertainment Television, Black Family Channel avoided rap and hip hop-based programming (they showed gospel music instead).[tpl]cite web|last=Downey|first=Kevin|title=Slow Build for Black Family Channel|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/slow-build-black-family-channel/77198|work=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=BroadcastingCable.com|accessdate=10 February 2006[/tpl]   The network was available in up to 16 million homes in the US.
On April 24, 2007, BFC announced that they would cease as a cable channel, effective April 30, 2007, as part of a deal in which BFC's programming and subscriber base would be sold to the Gospel Music Channel.[tpl]cite web|last=Moss|first=Linda|title=Black Family Channel-Gospel Music Channel Deal Is Official|url=http://www.blackenterprise.com/?s=mbc+network&x=0&y=0|work=Multichannel News|publisher=Multichannel.com|accessdate=1 May 2007[/tpl]  On May 1, 2007, the deal was closed.
The station was an associate member of the Caribbean Cable Cooperative.[tpl]cite web|title=Territory and Co-op Channels|url=http://www.cctvcoop.com/listChannels.aspx|work=Caribbean Cable Cooperative|publisher=CCTVCoop.com|accessdate=24 November 2013[/tpl]
