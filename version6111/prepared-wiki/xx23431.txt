Jérôme Napoléon Bonaparte (London, 5 July 1805 – Baltimore, 17 June 1870) was a son of Elizabeth Patterson and Jérôme Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon I.France and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History -Bill Marshall, Will Kaufman, Cristina Johnston - 2005  Page 162 "Jérôme Napoléon Bonaparte was born in England on July 7, 1805. Betsy and her son returned to Baltimore in September 1805. At Napoléon's behest, Jérôme married Princess Catherine of Württemberg in August 1807."
He was born in 95 Camberwell Grove, Camberwell, London, England, but lived in the United States with his wealthy American mother.  Jérôme's mother's marriage had been annulled by order of Jérôme's uncle, French Emperor Napoleon I. The annulment caused the rescission of his right to carry the Bonaparte name; though the ruling was later reversed by his cousin, Napoleon III.
It is speculated that Jérôme's prospective title is a reason the 11th Congress of the United States in 1810 proposed the Titles of Nobility Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would strip an American of his citizenship if he accepted a title of nobility from a foreign nation.  The amendment has never been approved, lacking the approval of only two state legislatures at that time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thirdamendment.com/missing.html |title=The "Missing Thirteenth Amendment": Constitutional Nonsense and Titles of Nobility |publisher=Thirdamendment.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08[/tpl]
He married Susan May Williams, and it is from them that the American line of the Bonaparte family descended. They had two sons:
