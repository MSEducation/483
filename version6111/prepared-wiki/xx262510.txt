Since its foundation in 2007, Gente Nueva has served as the main branch of the organization in Ciudad Juárez and in the rest of the state, where they have engaged in a four-year war with the Juárez Cartel and its enforcer wing, La Línea, for the control of the smuggling routes to the United States.[tpl]cite news|last=Shea|first=Erin|title=Mapping Sinaloa Cartel Operatives in Juarez Battleground|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2683-mapping-sinaloa-cartel-operatives-in-juarez-battleground|accessdate=30 July 2012|newspaper=InSight Crime|date=25 May 2012[/tpl] Amid the internal struggles and infightings in the Juárez cartel, Gente Nueva began to recruit the cartel's members.[tpl]sfn|Tuckman|2012|p=31[/tpl]

==History==

===Battle for Ciudad Juárez===

The war between the Juárez Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel for the control of the smuggling routes in Ciudad Juárez broke out on 5 January 2008, when five men were shot dead with AR-15s in a matter of hours; within a few days, several policemen and nearly two dozen civilians lay dead.[tpl]cite news|title=Ciudad Juarez Banner Headline: "Not One Person Murdered Yesterday"|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/06/ciudad-juarez-banner-head_n_381757.html|accessdate=30 July 2012|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=9 June 2012[/tpl] The Juárez cartel used La Línea and Los Aztecas gang to fight off the forces of the Sinaloa cartel, which had employed the gangs known as Artistas Asesinos and Los Mexicles, along with its armed wing, Gente Nueva.[tpl]cite news|title=Sinaloa cartel member captured in northern Mexico|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2012/07/11/sinaloa-cartel-member-captured-in-northern-mexico/|accessdate=30 July 2012|newspaper=Fox News|date=11 July 2012[/tpl] The turf wars between them have left more than 10,000 dead in four years.[tpl]cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Mica|title=Ten thousand dead and counting: Ciudad Juarez, the Mexican city that’s deadlier than Afghanistan|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/12/27/ciudad-juarez-10000-killed-in-four-years-as-mexicos-toothless-war-on-drugs-goes-on/|accessdate=30 July 2012|newspaper=The National Post|date=27 January 2010[/tpl] 
When Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán, the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, jumped into the territory of the Juárez organization in 2007, he attempted to split his rival organization and recruit the dissidents into his own invasion force – Gente Nueva.[tpl]sfn|Tuckman|2012|p=31[/tpl]
Gente Nueva is responsible for a number of crimes, including but not limited to extortions, kidnappings, tortures, and assassinations.

====Ciudad Juárez rehab center attack====

Masked gunmen stormed the El Aliviane drug rehabilitation center in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua on 3 September 2009, gathered all of the patients together against a wall at a central patio, and then opened fire at them with AK-47 rifles.[tpl]cite news|last=Lacey|first=Marc|title=17 Killed in Mexican Rehab Center|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/04/world/americas/04mexico.html|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=3 September 2009[/tpl] 18 patients were killed in the attack and two others were left wounded.[tpl]cite news|last=Ellingwood|first=Ken|title=18 killed in Juarez clinic for addicts|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-mexico-rehab-attack4-2009sep04,0,5425770.story|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=4 September 2009[/tpl] When the Mexican authorities removed the dead bodies, a thick layer of blood was left at the concrete floor of the clinic, from the entrance to the sleep quarters. Local newspapers stated that the gunmen were plotting to kill members of Los Aztecas, a rival gang at the service of the Juárez Cartel. On February 2012 in León, Guanajuato – José Antonio Torres Marrufo – a leader of Gente Nueva, was arrested and found responsible for ordering the attack.[tpl]cite news|title=Sinaloa cartel enforcer Marrufo arrested in Mexico|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-16891163|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=4 February 2012[/tpl] Gente Nueva had killed 8 people at a the 7&7 Bar in Ciudad Juárez just a few weeks before the rehab center attack. [tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news|last=Miroslava|first=Breach|title=Cómplices de El Chapo, cinco implicados en masacre de adictos en Juárez: Sedena|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/09/26/politica/007n1pol|accessdate=4 August 2012|newspaper=La Jornada|date=22 September 2009[/tpl]
The attack was materialized within sight of the U.S.-Mexico border and is one of the worst single mass shootings in the history of Ciudad Juárez.[tpl]cite news|last=Sanchez|first=Stephanie|title=Juárez in shock: Attack considered city's worst multiple shooting|url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_13266495|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=El Paso Times|date=4 September 2009[/tpl]
The Mexican authorities stated that the drug trafficking organizations use rehabilitation clinics to recruit foot soldiers and smugglers, and often kill those who do not cooperate. Others are killed for failing to pay for their drugs or for ripping off a dealer.[tpl]cite news|last=Flores|first=Aileen B.|title=19 die in attack at rehabilitation center|url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/juarez/ci_15282030|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=El Paso Times|date=16 June 2010[/tpl] In addition, the cartels frequently target unlicensed rehabilitation centers, since they are likely to accept active gang members seeking to free themselves from an addiction.[tpl]cite news|last=Ramsey|first=Geoffrey|title=No Exit: Why Mexico's Drug Gangs Target Rehab Clinics|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/1056-no-exit-why-mexicos-drug-gangs-target-rehab-clinics|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=InSight Crime|date=8 June 2011[/tpl] Unlike the government-licensed clinics, the private centers are not associated with the penal system and have limited security measures, leaving the victims vulnerable to attacks by gangs seeking revenge or the elimination of a potential police informant. In Ciudad Juárez alone, there are around 100,000 drug addicts and many of the rehab clinics are unlicensed and ran by former addicts, making them easy points for the cartels to infiltrate.[tpl]cite news|title=Mexico drug cartels go into the rehab business|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35241198/ns/world_news-americas/t/mexico-drug-cartels-go-rehab-business/#.UA7FeDG3CFc|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=MSN|date=2 April 2010[/tpl] Some cartel members even check themselves in the facility and pose as addicts. Once they gain information of why the facility works, they co-opt with workers or threaten to kill them. Some of the addicts sell candy and gum at the city's stop lights to raise money for those struggling in their rehab center, but the cartels have taken this opportunity to force them to sell drugs too. The drug cartels have also created and managed pseudo-clinics, and once their patients are off drugs, they gIve them the choice to work as a drug trafficker or get killed. The cartels usually "dispose" of their young addicts by killing them, since the criminal organizations quickly recruit young men and prefer to minimize their risk by eliminating the others.

====Decline of the Juárez Cartel====

The decline of the Juárez Cartel began in 1997 after the death of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, but worsened in mid-2000 when the Sinaloa Cartel sought to take over the assets of the criminal organization and move into the city.[tpl]cite news|title=Mexican army says killings in border city of Ciudad Juarez down 42 percent|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/07/11/mexican-army-says-killings-in-border-city-ciudad-juarez-down-42-percent/|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=Fox News|date=11 July 2012[/tpl] In 2010, violence in Ciudad Juárez reached its peak, seeing an average of 10 homicides per day, or about 230 murders per 100,000 people annually. That same year, the average in all of Mexico was of 18 murders per every 100,000 habitants. La Línea and the Juárez cartel lived their biggest blow with the arrest of José Antonio Acosta Hernández (a.k.a. El Diego), a top drug baron accused by the Mexican authorities of ordering more than 1,500 killings. Joaquín Guzmán Loera's four-year struggle in Ciudad Juárez left more than 10,000 since 2008,[tpl]cite news|last=Althaus|first=Dudley|title=Drug lord "El Chapo" declares war on Zetas|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Drug-lord-El-Chapo-declares-war-on-Zetas-3492866.php|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=The Houston Chronicle|date=18 April 2012[/tpl] but evidence shows that the murder rates in Ciudad Juárez decreased by 59.8% in the first half of 2012 when compared to the same period in 2011, and Mexican officials have attributed this decline to the success of its law enforcement agencies.[tpl]cite news|last=Martínez-Cabrera|first=Alejandro|title=Juárez slayings decreased 59.8% first half 2012|url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_21074666|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=El Paso Times|date=12 July 2012[/tpl] Nonetheless, experts told El Paso Times that part of the reason why the violence in Ciudad Juárez toned down is because the Sinaloa cartel has consolidated its dominance over the now-weakened Juárez cartel. The Juárez cartel continues to operate in the city, but it no longer holds a monopoly and appears to be unable to expand. Other experts echoe that the cartel is having difficulties paying its members and that the violence will continue to decline as its hegemony erodes. Their relationship with the Barrio Azteca gang has also been tampered by the cartel's decline. [tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news|title=El Cártel de Juárez llega a su fin|url=http://eleconomista.com.mx/seguridad-publica/2012/01/18/cartel-juarez-llega-su-fin|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=El Economista|date=18 January 2012[/tpl] NPR reports indicated that several people in Ciudad Juárez, including but not limited to local journalists and former policemen, perceived that the Mexican government allegedly favored the Sinaloa cartel in their battle against the Juárez cartel.[tpl]cite news|last=Burnett|first=John|title=Mexico's Drug War: A Rigged Fight?|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126890838|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=18 May 2010[/tpl] Nonetheless, counterarguments from security experts were also included. 
The reported victory of the Sinaloa cartel may possibly not halt the forces of the Juárez cartel; as long as Vicente Carrillo Fuentes is alive and free, the warfare in the area will possibly continue.[tpl]cite news|last=Caldwell|first=Alicia A.|title=El Chapo Guzman winning Juarez drug war, U.S. intelligence says|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20100410-El-Chapo-Guzman-winning-3276.ece|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=The Dallas Morning News|date=10 April 2010[/tpl] With limited options, the Juárez cartel has been forced to reorganize its forces and opt for extortions and kidnappings, while Gente Nueva – the Sinaloa cartel's armed wing – receives funding from other states.[tpl]cite news|last=Chavez|first=Ricardo|title=Mexico Army: Border City Killings Plunge This Year|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexico-army-border-city-killings-plunge-year-16759233#.UA2qJTG3CFc|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=12 July 2012[/tpl] In addition, the drug corridor in Ciudad Juárez remains a crucial territory for the Mexican drug trafficking organizations, so the city could continue to see battles for the control of the lucrative smuggling routes – even at a diminishing scale.[tpl]cite news|last=Fox|first=Edward|title=Judge: 'Mexico Will Win Fight Against Organized Crime in Juarez|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2576-judge-mexico-will-win-fight-against-organized-crime-in-juarez|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=InSight Crime|date=3 May 2012[/tpl] And although the rise of the New Juárez Cartel has yet to materialize, the threat still remains.

===Cartel infighting in Durango===

On mid-2011, the Mexican authorities said that the hundreds of corpses found in several mass graves in the northern state of Durango were victims of an infighting within the Sinaloa Cartel.[tpl]cite news|last=Corcoran|first=Patrick|title=Mexico Mass Graves: Evidence of Sinaloa Cartel Split?|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/978-mexico-mass-graves-evidence-of-sinaloa-cartel-split|accessdate=30 July 2012|newspaper=InSight Crime|date=25 May 2011[/tpl] Through a banner, Gente Nueva and Los Ms, a faction led by Ismael Zambada García, accused other lieutenants in the cartel of "heating up the plaza" in Durango by trying to attract law enforcement presence in the area, usually through indiscriminate killings and other violent tactics.[tpl]cite news|last=Corcoran|first=Patrick|title=Factions of Sinaloa Cartel Battle in Durango|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/812-factions-of-sinaloa-cartel-battle-in-durango|accessdate=30 July 2012|newspaper=InSight Crime|date=25 April 2011[/tpl] The message warned their rivals that they had only 24 hours to leave the area before they were killed. The banner was followed by a pair of videos uploaded on March that showed several armed men in military grabs interrogating two men allegedly working for a rival faction. In the video, the two men said that they had been sent to Durango to disrupt cartel operatives. The dispute indicated that two leaders in Gente Nueva, Noel Salgeiro and Felipe Cabrera, had lost the support of the upper-leaders in Gente Nueva and the rest of the Sinaloa organization.
Initially, the massacre was overshadowed by the other mass graves in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas. But when Bernabé Monje Silva, alias M14 was arrested by the Federal police, he led them to the exact location of the bodies.[tpl]cite news|title=Mass Graves Reveal Dissension in Cartel, Say Police Sources|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2011/05/23/ground-zero-mexican-mass-graves-reveals-dissension-cartel/|accessdate=30 July 2012|newspaper=Fox News|date=23 May 2011[/tpl] [tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news|title=Los Emes, Los Canelos y Los Cabrera, autores de las fosas en Durango|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&id_nota=738906&rss=1|accessdate=30 July 2012|newspaper=Excélsior|date=22 May 2011[/tpl] He later confessed that there was a feud between several factions of the Sinaloa cartel for the control of the drug corridors in Durango. The area is a strategic drug trafficking corridor since it can connect with the border cities of Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa, and Ciudad Juárez. It is also an attractive pathway state and producer region, notorious for growing poppy and marijuana in the mountainous region known as the "Golden Triangle." In addition, according to Mexican and U.S. intelligence, Joaquín Guzmán Loera (El Chapo) has been reported to have married in a small town in Durango and lived in the Sierra Madre[tpl]dn|date=May 2013[/tpl] mountains in 2007 and 2009 respectively.[tpl]cite news|last=Stone|first=Hannah|title=Is the US Raising Stakes in Search for 'El Chapo'?|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/767-is-the-us-raising-stakes-in-search-for-el-chapo|accessdate=30 July 2012|newspaper=InSight Crime|date=12 April 2011[/tpl]

===Veracruz incursion and massacre===

The tit-for-tat fighting between Los Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel started in the Mexican state of Veracruz, a strategic smuggling region with a giant gulf port.[tpl]cite news|title=49 bodies with heads, hands and feet chopped off found on Mexican highway leading to US border|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/49-bodies-with-heads-hands-and-feet-chopped-off-found-on-mexican-highway-leading-to-us-border/2012/05/13/gIQAUVcXNU_story.html|accessdate=14 May 2012|newspaper=Washington Post|date=13 May 2012|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
On 20 September 2011 at around 5:00p.m., several vehicles blocked a major avenue in Boca del Río, Veracruz.

Then they opened the gates of the truck beds and left a written message behind. Other gunmen pointed their weapons at the frightened drivers.[tpl]cite news|last=Castillo|first=Eduardo|title=Mexico Horror: Suspected Drug Traffickers Dump 35 Bodies On Avenue In Veracruz|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/21/mexico-bodies-gunmen_n_973298.html|accessdate=9 May 2012|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=21 September 2011[/tpl] The cartel members then fled the scene.
