Mark Seibert is an American musician, composer, and producer best known for his work on various video games from Sierra Entertainment.

==Biography==

From 1979 to 1986, Seibert performed guitar and vocals for a Christian band called Omega Sunrise. He recorded two albums with the group in 1983 and 1985, the second of which saw moderate success in various US markets. After a final concert in Fresno, California in 1986, the group broke up due to the demands of constant touring.
Seibert was tired of working on the road. In 1987, he answered a newspaper advertisement from a computer game company called Sierra On-Line. After several months of delay, the company hired him as a musician and music editor for King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella. He worked as a musician on this and other projects, but after only a few years, he was promoted to the company's music director. This meant that he worked with staff musicians in both composition and editing.
In 1992, he was promoted again to producer, which meant he was involved in all aspects of game production, not just the music. However, this also meant that he was less able to actually compose music, though he did continue to perform pieces by other composers. He left the company in 2001.
He also helped lead worship services at his church, the Fresno Vineyard,  from 1987 to 1991 with his wife Debbie.
