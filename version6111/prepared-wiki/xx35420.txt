==Plot==

The film follows Kaspar Hauser (Bruno Schleinstein), who lived the first seventeen years of his life chained in a tiny cellar with only a toy horse to occupy his time, devoid of all human contact except for a man, wearing a black overcoat and top hat, who feeds him.
One day, in 1828, the same man takes Hauser out of his cell, teaches him a few phrases, and how to walk, before leaving him in the town of Nuremberg. Hauser becomes the subject of much curiosity, and is exhibited in a circus before being rescued by Herr Daumer (Walter Ladengast), who patiently attempts to transform him.
Hauser soon learns to read and write, and develops unorthodox approaches to logic and religion; but music is what pleases him most. He attracts the attention of academics, clergy and nobility, but is then physically attacked by the same unknown man who brought him to Nuremberg. The attack leaves him unconscious with a bleeding head. He recovers, but is again mysteriously attacked; this time, stabbed in the chest.
Hauser rests in bed describing visions he has had of nomadic Berbers in the Sahara Desert, and then dies. An autopsy reveals an enlarged liver and cerebellum.

==Historical accuracy==

The film follows the real story of Kaspar Hauser quite closely, using the text of actual letters found with Hauser, and following many details in the opening sequence of Hauser's confinement and release. One notable departure is with his apparent age: although the historical Hauser was 17 when he was discovered in Nuremberg and the film implies this, the character is played by actor Bruno Schleinstein, who was 41 years old at the time of filming. Nevertheless, Schleinstein's character is treated and described throughout as a youth.

==Cast==

==Production==

Herzog discovered the lead actor, Bruno Schleinstein, in a documentary about street musicians. Fascinated, Herzog cast him as the lead in two of his films, The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser and Stroszek, despite the fact that he had no training as an actor. Schleinstein's own life bears some similarities to Kaspar Hauser's, and his own unbalanced personality was often expressed on set. In Herzog's commentary for the English language DVD release, he recalls that Schleinstein remained in costume for the entire duration of the production, even after shooting was done for the day. Herzog once visited him in his hotel room, to find him sleeping on the floor by the door, in his costume. 
The Production Designer for the film was Henning Von Gierke, the Costume Designers were Ann Poppel and Gisela Storch.
The outdoor scenes were filmed in the town of Dinkelsbühl and on a nearby mountain called Hesselberg.
The music of several classical composers is featured in the film's soundtrack, including pieces by Johann Pachelbel, Orlando di Lasso, Tommaso Albinoni, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
