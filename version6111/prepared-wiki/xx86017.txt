Greenway Plaza is a master-planned mixed-use development off U.S. Highway 59 in Houston, Texas, United States, five miles (8 kilometers) west of Downtown Houston and three miles (5 kilometers) east of Uptown Houston. Greenway Plaza is Houston's first totally planned business-commercial-residential complex developed by Kenneth Schnitzer.  Greenway Plaza is owned and operated by Cousins Propertieshttp://cousinsproperties.com/page/press-release-closes-texas-acquisition (NYSE: CUZ).  Most buildings within the Greenway Plaza campus are interconnected by environmentally-controlled bridges, and/or tunnels and covered walkways. Civil engineer Jack Boyd Buckley also worked on the Greenway Plaza design.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl]

==History==

Kenneth L. Schnitzer, the chairperson of the Century Development Corporation,Schadewald, Bill. "Looking back ‘Then and Now’ at 40 years of Houston business." Houston Business Journal. Friday December 24, 2010. 1.

Business Wire. June 9, 2007. Retrieved on January 21, 2009.
Century took realtors from outlying towns around Houston and had them buy individual parcels for very inexpensive prices while trying not to attract attention. One homeowner found out about the plan and asked to have the house sold for $350,000. At the time it was a lot of money for a house that was small. The company paid the money so it could secure the tract the house sat on. The grand opening took place in 1973. Schnitzer said that Greenway Plaza would become a "second downtown." Bill Schadewald of the Houston Press said that Greenway Plaza, which housed office towers, retail operations, a basketball arena, a movie theater, and a hotel, "defined the multiuse concept in an original “Edge City.”"
In 1970 the M. W. Kellogg company had moved its headquarters from New York to Houston. After Kellogg moved its operations into Greenway Plaza, initially Kellogg occupied half of 3 Greenway Plaza and staffed the half with fewer than 600 employees. When the energy industry expanded worldwide, Kellogg occupied all of 3 Greenway Plaza and space in an adjacent building. Kellogg's lease on July 1, 1991 was up for renewal; if Kellogg had renewed the lease, its rent payment would have increased. Instead Kellogg decided to swap office space with its parent company, Dresser Industries. Dresser took over a part of Kellogg's lease and renamed 3 Greenway Plaza to the Dresser Tower. After the swap Dresser occupied [tpl]convert|163000|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl] of space on eight floors, while Kellogg continued to lease six floors in the building. In exchange Kellogg took space formerly held by Dresser at the M. W. Kellogg Tower in the Cullen Center in Downtown Houston. The swap satisfied Dresser's need for less space.Stuart, Lettice. "REAL ESTATE; A Big Swap Of Offices In Houston." The New York Times. Wednesday May 15, 1991.
In 2004 Crescent attempted to sell a 50% equity position in both Greenway Plaza and Houston Center. During that year, El Paso Corp., a major tenant with [tpl]convert|912000|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl] in Greenway Plaza, announced that it was vacating the property and moving its personnel to its Downtown Houston headquarters. A Houston Business Journal article stated that El Paso was expected to sublease the space until 2014, when its lease will expire.
In 2005 the internet service provider Internet America had offices in Greenway Plaza.Azevedo, Mary Ann. "Internet America's Dallas presence dwindles." Dallas Business Journal. Friday October 28, 2005. Retrieved on September 25, 2009.
During the afternoon of Monday July 29, 2013, Cousins Properties, a company based in Atlanta, announced that it was buying the entire Greenway Plaza complex and a Downtown Fort Worth office tower. Nancy Sarnoff of the Houston Chronicle stated that Cousins was expected to pay $1.1 billion in cash.Sarnoff, Nancy. "Greenway Plaza selling to Atlanta company." Houston Chronicle.
