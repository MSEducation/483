The Snowy River National Park is a [tpl]convert|987|km2[/tpl] national park in Victoria, Australia, that is located [tpl]convert|323|km[/tpl] northeast of Melbourne.
On 7 November 2008, the park was added to the Australian National Heritage List as one of eleven areas constituting the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/national/australian-alps/index.html |title=Australian Alps National Parks information |accessdate=2010-06-10 |work=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts [/tpl]

==Location and features==

Much of the park is classified as wilderness area, where vehicles are unable to visit. The park provides one of the last natural habitats at the Little River Gorge for the endangered brush-tailed rock wallaby. Numbers for this species are estimated as extremely small, with the rugged terrain making it difficult to accurately monitor the species population. Over 250 native species have been recorded in the park, 29 of which are considered rare or threatened in Victoria, including the Long-footed Potoroo, Spotted Quoll (Tiger Quoll), Giant Burrowing Frog and Eastern She-oak Skink.
Little River Gorge is Victoria's deepest gorge, with the Little River descending [tpl]convert|610|m[/tpl] off the Wulgulmerang plateau over [tpl]convert|14|km[/tpl] to the Snowy River at an elevation of [tpl]convert|122|m[/tpl] AHD.
McKillops Road is the northern park boundary, with the Alpine National Park to the north of the road. The road is designated unsuitable for caravans, trailers and semi-trailers due to its long, narrow, and steep descent down to McKillops Bridge which crosses the Snowy River near its juncture with the Deddick River. A camping site near McKillops Bridge provides an excellent site for swimming, launching canoes and rafting through the rugged gorges downstream, or the start for the 18Â km Silver Mine Walking Track and the short Snowy River Trail.
