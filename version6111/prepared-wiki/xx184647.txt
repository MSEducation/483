Waningus had a son, Desiderius, who was also later venerated as a saint.[tpl]cite web | last =Ansart | first =Abbot Stéphane | title =Les saints du 18 décembre | url =http://pagesperso-orange.fr/ansart/Sanctoral/Annee/1218.htm | accessdate =3 January 2008[/tpl] [tpl]fr icon[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Jones | first = Terry | title = Waningus | work = Patron Saints Index | url=http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintw52.htm | accessdate = 3 January 2008[/tpl] One night Waningus had a dream in which Saint Eulalia of Barcelona reminded him of the difficulties the rich had in entering Heaven, so he gave up the privileged life to become a Benedictine monk. He founded Fécamp Abbey and is also said to have had a hand, in conjunction with Saint Wandrille, in the foundation of Fontenelle Abbey.
