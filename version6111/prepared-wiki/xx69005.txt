==Early life==

King was born Lawrence Leibel Harvey Zeiger in Brooklyn, New York City, New York on November 19, 1933 to an Austrian immigrant Edward Jonaton Zeiger, a restaurant owner and defense-plant worker, and his wife Jennie (Gitlitz), a garment worker, who emigrated from Belarus.[tpl]better source|date=February 2013|reason=filmreference.com appears to be user-generated[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/7/Larry-King.html|title=Larry King profile at FilmReference.com|publisher=filmreference.com|accessdate = February 15, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/34806/celebrit ies|title=jweekly.com| work = Jweekly|date= April 18, 2008|accessdate= July 27, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=11356|date=November 14, 2003|title=Q & A With Larry King|author=Wenig, Gaby|accessdate= February 15, 2008[/tpl] Both parents were Orthodox Jews.[tpl]cite web|last=Aliza Davidovit|title=Larry King|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/larryking.html|work=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl]

His father's death greatly affected King, and he lost interest in school. After graduating from high school, he worked to help support his mother. He did not go to college. From an early age, however, he had wanted to go into radio.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/kin0bio-1|title=Broadcaster's Hall of Fame biography|publisher=Achievement.org|accessdate= July 27, 2010[/tpl]

==Career==

===Miami radio and television===

A CBS staff announcer, whom King met by chance, told him to go to Florida, a growing media market where openings still existed for inexperienced broadcasters. King rode a train to Miami.
After initial setbacks, King persisted and got his first job in radio. The manager of a small station, WAHR (now WMBM) in Miami Beach, hired him to clean up and perform miscellaneous tasks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whyfame.com/celebrities/television/larry_king_60696.php|title=Larry King Biography|publisher=WhyFame|accessdate=February 18, 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl] When one of their announcers quit, they put King on the air. His first broadcast was on May 1, 1957, when he worked as the disc jockey from 9 a.m. to noon.[tpl]cite web|author=Caitlin A.Johnson|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/28/earlyshow/leisure/books/main2523708.shtml|title=Larry King Celebrates 50 Years On Air|publisher= CBS News|date= February 11, 2009|accessdate= February 18, 2012[/tpl] He also did two afternoon newscasts and a sportscast. He was paid $55 a week.
He acquired the name Larry King when the general manager Marshall Simmonds said that Zeiger was too ethnic and difficult to remember, so Larry chose the surname King, which he got from an ad in The Miami Herald for King's Wholesale Liquor, minutes before air.[tpl]cite web|author=Christina and Jordana|url=http://www.schemamag.ca/archive2/2010/07/goodbye_larry_king_1.php|title=Goodbye Larry King|publisher=Schema Magazine|date= July 5, 2010|accessdate=February 18, 2012[/tpl]
He started doing interviews on a mid-morning show for WIOD, at Pumpernik's Restaurant in Miami Beach.[tpl]cite web|author=Pekkanen, John |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20075993,00.html|title=While Most of America Sleeps, Larry King Talks to Six Million People All Through the Night| work = People |date=March 10, 1980|accessdate= February 18, 2012[/tpl] He would interview anyone who walked in.

His Miami radio show launched him to local stardom. A few years later, in May 1960, he hosted Miami Undercover, airing Sunday nights at 11:30 p.m. on WPST-TV Channel 10 (now WPLG).[tpl]cite web|author=Jon Bershad|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/from-the-mediaite-vault-larry-king-takes-on-gangsters-and-loses-in-1961/|title=From the Mediaite Vault: Larry King Takes on Gangsters (and Loses) in 1961| work = Mediaite (blog)|date= June 30, 2010|accessdate=February 18, 2012[/tpl] On the show, he moderated debates on important issues of the time.
King credits his success on local television to the assistance of comedian Jackie Gleason, whose national television variety show was being filmed in Miami Beach during this period. "That show really took off because Gleason came to Miami," King said in a 1996 interview he gave when inducted into the Broadcasters' Hall of Fame. "He did that show and stayed all night with me. We stayed till five in the morning. He didn't like the set, so we broke into the general manager's office and changed the set. Gleason changed the set, he changed the lighting, and he became like a mentor of mine."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/kin0int-1|title=The Interview King|publisher=Academy of Achievement|date=June 29, 1996|accessdate= March 3, 2008[/tpl]
During this period, WIOD gave King further exposure as a color commentator for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League, during their 1970 season and most of their 1971 season.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.dlife.com/diabetes/famous_people/writers_reporters_editors/larry_king|title=Larry King – Talk Show Host|publisher=dLife|date=|accessdate=February 18, 2012[/tpl] However, he was dismissed by both WIOD and television station WTVJ as a late-night radio host and sports commentator as of December 20, 1971, when he was arrested after being accused of grand larceny by a former business partner.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/celebrity/television/larry-king|title=Larry King|publisher= The Smoking Gun|accessdate= February 18, 2012[/tpl] Other staffers covered the Dolphins' games into their 24–3 loss to Dallas in Super Bowl VI. King also lost his weekly column at the Miami Beach Sun newspaper. The charges were dropped on March 10, 1972, and King spent the next several years in reviving his career, including a stint as the color announcer in Louisiana for the Shreveport Steamer of the World Football League in 1974–75 on KWKH. Eventually, King was rehired by WIOD in Miami. For several years during the 1970s in South Florida, he hosted a sports talk-show called "Sports-a-la-King" that featured guests and callers.

===National radio===

In 1978, King went national, inheriting the nightly talk show slot on the Mutual Broadcasting System, broadcast coast-to-coast, that had been "Long John" Nebel's until his death, and had been pioneered by Herb Jepko.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/102334%7C0/Larry-King/|title=Larry King|publisher=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate= February 18, 2012[/tpl] One reason King got the Mutual job is that he had once been an announcer at WGMA-AM in Hollywood, Florida, which was then owned by C. Edward Little. Little went on to become president of Mutual and was the one who hired King when Nebel died. King's Mutual show developed a devoted audience.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
It was broadcast live Monday through Friday from midnight to 5:30 a.m. Eastern Time. King would interview a guest for the first 90 minutes, with callers asking questions that continued the interview for another 90 minutes. At 3 a.m., he would allow callers to discuss any topic they pleased with him, until the end of the program, when he expressed his own political opinions. That segment was called "Open Phone America." Some of the regular callers used the pseudonyms "The Portland Laugher," "The Miami Derelict," "The Todd Cruz Caller," "The Scandal Scooper," "Mr. Radio" and "The Water Is Warm Caller." "Mr. Radio" made over 200 calls to King during Open Phone America. The show was successful, starting with relatively few affiliates and eventually growing to more than 500. It ran until 1994.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
For its final year, the show was moved to afternoons, but, because most talk radio stations at the time had an established policy of local origination in the time-slot (3 to 6 p.m. Eastern Time) that Mutual offered the show, a very low percentage of King's overnight affiliates agreed to carry his daytime show and it was unable to generate the same audience size.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] The afternoon show was eventually given to David Brenner and radio affiliates were given the option of carrying the audio of King's new CNN evening television program. The Westwood One radio simulcast of the CNN show continued until December 31, 2009.

===CNN===

He started his Larry King Live CNN show in June 1985,  hosting a broad range of guests from controversial figures of UFO conspiracy theories and alleged psychics,One notable guest is Sylvia Browne, who in 2005 told the Newsweek magazine that King, a believer in the paranormal, asks her to do private psychic readings.

Unlike many interviewers, King has a direct, non-confrontational approach. His reputation for asking easy, open-ended questions has made him attractive to important figures who want to state their position while avoiding being challenged on contentious topics.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/02/world/europe/02putin.html|title=Blunt and Blustery, Putin Responds to State Department Cables on Russia| work =The New York Times |author=Barry, Ellen|date=December 1, 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2010[/tpl]  [tpl]citation needed span|date=February 2013|text=His interview style is characteristically frank, but with occasional bursts of irreverence and humor.

In a show dedicated to the surviving Beatles, King asked George Harrison's widow about the song "Something," which was written about Harrison's first wife. He seemed surprised when she did not know very much about the song.
Throughout his career King has interviewed many of the leading figures of his time. [tpl]citation needed span|date=February 2013|text=CNN claimed during his final episode that he had performed 60,000 interviews in his career.[/tpl]
King also wrote a regular newspaper column in USA Today for almost 20 years, from shortly after that newspaper's origin in 1982 until September 2001.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/lking.htm| work = USA Today |date=September 23, 2001|author=King, Larry|title=A New York boy pays tribute, bids farewell|accessdate=October 19, 2009[/tpl] The column consisted of short "plugs, superlatives and dropped names" but was dropped when the newspaper redesigned its "Life" section.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/05/business/larry-king-s-weekly-column-for-usa-today-to-be-dropped.html|title=Larry King's Weekly Column for USA Today to Be Dropped|work =The New York Times|author=Barringer, Felicity|date=September 5, 2001|accessdate=October 19, 2009[/tpl] The column was resurrected in blog form in November 2008[tpl]cite news|url=http://larrykinglive.blogs.cnn.com/2008/11/24/kings-thingsmy-two-cents/|title=King's Things: It's My Two Cents|date=November 24, 2008|publisher=CNN|author=King, Larry|accessdate=October 19, 2009 [/tpl] and on Twitter in April 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://twitter.com/KingsThings|title=King's Things|author=King, Larry|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=October 19, 2009 [/tpl]
