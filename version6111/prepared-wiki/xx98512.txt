The Scotland national football team roll of honour is a list set up by the Scottish Football Association which recognises players who have gained 50 or more international caps for Scotland. There are currently 28 players on the roll of honour, with Gary Caldwell the most recent addition. He made his 50th appearance for Scotland on 8 September 2012, when the team played Serbia.
The roll of honour was launched in February 1988, when 11 players had already achieved the distinction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football_players.cfm?page=138 |publisher=Scottish Football Association|accessdate=17 August 2011|title=International Roll of Honour[/tpl] Each player inducted receives a commemorative gold medal, an invitation to every Scotland home match and has their portrait hung in the Scottish Football Museum.
