It has retained its leadership status established six months after coming on air when a University Survey indicated that it already enjoyed 49.5 percent of the listening audience. A recent independent survey by British Forces showed that 66.6 percent of Belizeans still rely on LOVE FM during emergencies.

Estereo Amor was founded on February 14, 1994 and is currently the only Spanish-language radio station operating in the country. Its signal, which also originates in Belize City, is also heard via repeaters in Central, Western and Northern Belize.
A third station aimed at young people, MORE FM, was inaugurated on February 14, 2000. It is geared towards adolescents and young adults and plays mostly newer genres of music. MORE FM reaches Central and Western and will soon be expanded to cover Southern Belize; indeed, for its first three years of existence it was located in Belmopan before moving to Belize City.
