[[List of films made in Poland in the Interwar Period]]

CATEGORIES: Cinema of Poland, Polish films, Lists of Polish films, Jewish cinema

Poland existed as a state for the first time in over a hundred years with the proclamation of the Second Polish Republic in 1918. This state lasted until Poland was invaded and partitioned by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in the fall of 1939. During this brief period of independence a small Polish film industry developed; though it was not well remembered as contemporary German, or postwar Polish counterpart, the cinema of the interwar period does give a glimpse of a neglected corner of the world on the verge of catastophe. This is especially true of the many Jewish themed films.
