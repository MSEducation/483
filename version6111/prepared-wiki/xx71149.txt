The Treasurer of the Navy was an office in the British government between the mid-16th and early 19th century. The office-holder was responsible for the financial maintenance of the Royal Navy. The office was a political appointment, and frequently was held by up-and-coming young politicians who would later go on to hold more important positions.  The post was abolished in 1836 and its functions incorporated into those of the Paymaster-General.
