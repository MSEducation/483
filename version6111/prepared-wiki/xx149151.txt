==Expedition 360==

Lewis set off with friend and fellow adventurer Stevie Smith from Greenwich, London in July 1994 to complete the world's first human-powered circumnavigation, and the two dubbed the journey Expedition 360. By July 2007, Lewis had travelled over  [tpl]convert|60,000|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl]. He successfully ended his 4,833-day expedition on October 6, 2007, having travelled [tpl]convert|74,842|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7022644.stm | work=BBC News | title=Human power fuels 13-year odyssey | date=7 October 2007 | accessdate=5 May 2010 | first=Caroline | last=Mallan[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/7031576.stm | work=BBC News | title=Briton completes 13-year odyssey | date=6 October 2007 | accessdate=5 May 2010[/tpl]
In mid-1994, Lewis and Smith mountain-biked 1,700 miles through France, Spain and Portugal to the port of Lagos, Portugal. Departing on October 13, 1994, Lewis and Smith then pedaled 111 consecutive days and 4,500 miles across the Atlantic Ocean from Portugal to Miami, Florida in a wooden pedal-powered boat named Moksha.
Lewis then roller bladed thousands of miles across North America. He was struck by a drunk driver in Pueblo, Colorado, and spent nine months recovering from two broken legs. He finished the North American expedition leg in 1996.
In 1998 and 1999, Lewis and Smith spent 53 days pedaling Moksha across the Pacific Ocean from San Francisco, California to Hilo, Hawaii, where Smith ended his journey. In four days, Lewis and a small group of supporters hiked the 80 miles across Hawaii.
After 73 days of solo pedaling Moksha across the doldrums, Lewis completed the Pacific Ocean crossing from Hawaii to the island atoll of Tarawa. In May 2000, he was accompanied by  Moksha's builder, Chris Tipper, to pedal the 1,300-mile stretch from Tarawa to the Solomon Islands. With the help of friend and expedition supporter April Abril, Lewis then pedaled Moksha 1,450 miles for 32 days across the Coral Sea to Australia.
In 2001, Lewis and a group of supporters spent 88 days bicycling 3,500 miles across the Australian outback, starting near Cooktown, Queensland, and finishing in the port city of Darwin, Northern Territory.
After spending many years raising funds to continue Expedition 360, Lewis was reunited with Moksha in 2005. He and expedition supporter Lourdes Arango pedaled 450 nautical miles from Darwin, Australia to Dili, East Timor.
Throughout 2005, Lewis kayaked thousands of miles through the Indonesian archipelago from East Timor to Singapore. In 2006, he biked from Singapore to the Himalayas, and biked and hiked through the Himalayas to the port of Mumbai.
Covering 2,000 nautical miles in 46 days during early 2007, Lewis and friend Sher Dhillon pedaled Moksha from Mumbai, India, crossing the Arabian Sea to Djibouti.
Lewis then planned to travel through Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt, and the Middle East before reaching Europe[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/england/dorset/6094094.stm | work=BBC News | title=Adventurer reaches highest point | date=28 October 2006 | accessdate=5 May 2010[/tpl] â€” encountering a problem in Sudan. The Egyptian authorities would not let him pass through their waters, and when his visa for Sudan ran out he was left with an "impossible decision".[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl] He attempted to kayak across Lake Nasser to Abu Simbel but was arrested on suspicion of spying. He was released, but the Egyptian authorities forbade him from mountain-biking the 178-mile journey to Aswan. He completed this section illegally by riding partly at night.http://www.expedition360.com/journal/archives/2007/06/the_last_of_the.html
In July 2007, Lewis reached Syria, and then bicycled across Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Austria, Germany, and Belgium before returning to London on October 6. Pulling Moksha in tow, Lewis crossed the Greenwich Meridian Line where he had begun his expedition 13 years earlier.
During his expedition, Lewis twice survived malaria, septicemia, a bout of mild schizophrenia, and a crocodile attack near Australia in 2005.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2604026.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Back home after 13 years Jason Lewis is first man to circle world on muscle power | first=John | last=Elliott | date=7 October 2007 | accessdate=5 May 2010[/tpl]
As part of a wider interest in sustainability and education, Lewis has visited more than 900 schools in 37 countries, giving talks to students and involving them in a variety of programs to promote world citizenship, zero carbon emission travel, and awareness of consumption habits on the health of the planet.

Throughout his 13-year expedition, Lewis' friend, cinematographer Kenny Brown, collected many hundreds of hours of footage, and has compiled the work into a feature-length documentary titled, The Expedition.

In 2012, artist Kris Stacks and writer Anthony DiMatteo created a 27-page black and white webcomic based on the writings of Lewis. The free webcomic was titled Expedition360.

==Personal life==

Lewis currently divides his time between England and the U.S. He regularly delivers inspirational speeches about global sustainability, and appears for book signings and readings to promote The Expedition trilogy. He also frequently writes for magazines and travel books. Lewis is a vegetarian, and a strong animal rights supporter, known for saying he "won't eat anything that has a face."
In his earlier years before Expedition 360, Lewis worked as a window cleaner, and as a member of a rock n' roll cover band. He has also worked as a ranch manager, backhoe operator, and pet caretaker. Before carrying out his 13-year human-powered circumnavigation, Lewis had never crossed an ocean, roller bladed, kayaked, or rode a bike for more than a few miles.
