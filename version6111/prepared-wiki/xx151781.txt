[[Interchange fee]]

CATEGORIES: Merchant services, Credit card terminology

Interchange fee is a term used in the payment card industry to describe a fee paid between banks for the acceptance of card based transactions. Usually it is a fee that a merchant's bank (the "acquiring bank") pays a customer's bank (the "issuing bank") however there are instances where the interchange fee is paid from the issuer to acquirer, often called reverse interchange.
In a credit card or debit card transaction, the card-issuing bank in a payment transaction deducts the interchange fee from the amount it pays the acquiring bank that handles a credit or debit card transaction for a merchant. The acquiring bank then pays the merchant the amount of the transaction minus both the interchange fee and an additional, usually smaller, fee for the acquiring bank or ISO, which is often referred to as a discount rate, an add-on rate, or passthru. For cash withdrawal transactions at ATMs, however, the fees are paid by the card-issuing bank to the acquiring bank (for the maintenance of the machine).
These fees are set by the credit card networks,United States Securities and Exchange Commission FORM S-1, November 9, 2007. and are the largest component of the various fees that most merchants pay for the privilege of accepting credit cards, representing 70% to 90% of these fees by some estimates, although larger merchants typically pay less as a percentage. Interchange fees have a complex pricing structure, which is based on the card brand, regions or jurisdictions, the type of credit or debit card, the type and size of the accepting merchant, and the type of transaction (e.g. online, in-store, phone order, whether the card is present for the transaction, etc.). Further complicating the rate schedules, interchange fees are typically a flat fee plus a percentage of the total purchase price (including taxes). In the United States, the fee averages approximately 2% of transaction value.[tpl]cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=How Visa, Using Card Fees, Dominates a Market |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/your-money/credit-and-debit-cards/05visa.html?em=&pagewanted=all |quote=The fees, roughly 1 to 3 percent of each purchase, are forwarded to the cardholder's bank to cover costs and promote the issuance of more Visa cards. |work=New York Times |date=January 4, 2010 |accessdate=2010-01-06 | first=Andrew | last=Martin[/tpl]
In recent years, interchange fees have become a controversial issue, the subject of regulatory and antitrust investigations.  Many large merchants such as Wal-Mart have the ability to negotiate fee prices,The Interchange Debate: Issues and Economics James Lyon, Jan. 19, 2006. and while some merchants prefer cash or PIN-based debit cards, most believe they cannot realistically refuse to accept the major card network-branded cards. This holds true even when their interchange-driven fees exceed their profit margins.A Puzzle of Card Payment Pricing: Why Are Merchants Still Accepting Card Payments? Fumiko Hayashi, March 2006. Some countries, such as Australia, have established significantly lower interchange fees, although according to a U.S. Government Accountability study, the savings enjoyed by merchants were not passed along to consumers."Rising Interchange Fees Have Increased Costs for Merchants, but Options for Reducing Fees Pose Challenges", U.S. Government Accountability Office, November 2009 The fees are also the subject of several ongoing lawsuits in the United States.

In the US Card issuers now make over $30 billion annually from interchange fees. Interchange fees collected by VisaVisa Interchange Rates and MasterCardMasterCard Interchange Rates totaled $26 billion in 2004. In 2005 the number was $30.7 billion, and the increase totals 85 percent compared to 2001.
The origins of the interchange fee are a matter of some controversy.  Often they are assumed to have been developed to maintain and attract a proper mix of issuers and acquirers to bank networks.  Research by Professor Adam Levitin of Georgetown University Law Center, however, indicates that interchange fees were originally designed as a method for banks to avoid usury and Truth-in-Lending laws.Adam J. Levitin, Priceless?  The Economic Costs of Credit Card Merchant Restraints', 55 UCLA Law Review, 1321 (2008).  Typically, the bulk of the fee goes to the issuing bank. Issuing banks’ interchange fees are extracted from the amount collected by the merchants when they submit credit or debit transactions for payment through their acquiring banks. Banks do not expect to make a significant amount of money from late fees and interest charges from creditworthy customers (who pay in full every month), and instead make their profits on the interchange fee charged to merchants.The World's Most Exclusive Credit Cards Forbes'', July 3, 2007.
Interchange rates are established at differing levels for a variety of reasons.  For example, a premium credit card that offers rewards generally will have a higher interchange rate than do standard cards. Transactions made with credit cards generally have higher rates than those with signature debit cards, whose rates are in turn typically higher than PIN debit card transactions. Sales that are not conducted in person, such as by phone or on the Internet, generally are subject to higher interchange rates, than are transactions on cards presented in person. It is important to note that interchange is also set to encourage issuance and to attract issuing banks to issue a particular brand. Higher interchange is often a tool for schemes to encourage issuance of their particular brand.Interchange Plus Pricing
For one example of how interchange functions, imagine a consumer making a $100 purchase with a credit card. For that $100 item, the retailer would get approximately $98.  The remaining $2, known as the merchant discountMerchant account and fees, gets divided up.  About $1.75 would go to the card issuing bank (defined as interchange), $0.18 would go to Visa or MasterCard association (defined as assessments), and the remaining $0.07 would go to the retailer's merchant account provider.  If a credit card displays a Visa logo, Visa will get the $0.18, likewise with MasterCard. Visa's assessment is fixed at 0.1100% of the transaction value and MasterCard's assessment is fixed at 0.0950% of the transaction value. On average the interchange rates in the US are 179 basis points (1.79%) and vary widely across countries.  In April 2007 Visa announced it would raise its rate .6% to

===Price-fixing===

Regulators in several countries have questioned the collective determination of interchange rates and fees as potential examples of price-fixing. Merchant groups in particular, including the U.S.-based Merchants Payments Coalition and Merchant Bill of Rights, also claim that interchange fees are much higher than necessary,Merchants, pay attention to rising credit-card fees[tpl]Dead link|url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070521/BUSINESS/705210336|date=February 2011[/tpl] Indianapolis Star,  May 22, 2007. Retrieved May 22, 2007. pointing to the fact that even though technology and efficiency has improved, interchange fees have more than doubled in the last 10 years. Issuing banks argue that reduced interchange fees would result in increased costs for cardholders, and reduce their ability to satisfy rewards on cards already issued.  The Merchants Payments Coalition argues that consumers pay more than they should because of "hidden" interchange fees and that reducing these fees would result in lower retail prices.

====Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation====

The Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation is a United States class-action lawsuit filed in 2005 by merchants and trade associations against Visa, MasterCard, and numerous financial institutions that issue payment cards. The suit was filed due to price fixing and other allegedly anti-competitive trade practices in the credit card industry. A proposed settlement received preliminary approval from the judge overseeing the case in November 2012 but the majority of named class plaintiffs have objected and many have vowed to opt out of the settlement.

====Legislation and Congressional investigations====

Senate hearings in the United States have focused on the secrecy surrounding interchange fee schedules and card operating rules. In 2006 Visa and MasterCard both released some fee schedules and summary reports of their card rules, though pressure continues for them to release the full documents. In January 2007, Senate Banking committee chairman Chris Dodd cited interchange fees at a hearing on credit card industry practices and again in March the fees were criticized by Sen. Norm Coleman.Sen. Coleman statement, Senate.gov, March 7, 2007. Retrieved May 22, 2007.  In January 2007, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates cited high interchange fees as a significant reason Microsoft believes it can be competitive in online micropayments.
In March 2007, MasterCard announced it was changing its rate structure, splitting the lower, "basic" tier for credit cards into two new tiers. The Wall Street Journal reportedMasterCard Alters Fee Structure, Wall Street Journal, March 1, 2007. Retrieved May 22, 2007. that the document outlining the shift "makes it difficult to determine if the new rates, on average, are rising." MasterCard spokesman Joshua Peirez said the new structure "allows us to have a more sophisticated way to break up our credit card portfolio," while National Retail Federation general counsel Mallory Duncan said, "They are pricing each tier at the absolute most they can so they can maximize their income."
On July 19, 2007 the House Judiciary Committee antitrust task force held the first hearing to study the specific issue of interchange fees. NRF's Duncan testified, as did representatives from the credit card industry.  Subcommittee chairman  John Conyers, leading the panel, said, "While I come into the hearing with an open mind, I do believe the burden of the proof lies with the credit card companies to reassure Congress that increasing interchange fees are not harming merchants and ultimately consumers."U.S. lawmaker wants proof credit card fees don't harm Reuters, July 19, 2007.

====Department of Justice anti-trust litigation====

In October 2010, Visa and MasterCard reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in an antitrust case focused on the issue of competitiveness in the interchange market.  The companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards, or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards.http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/10/04/pm-visa-mastercard-settlement-means-more-flexibility-for-retailers/

===European Union===

In 2002 the European Commission exempted Visa’s multilateral interchange fees from Article 81 of the EC Treaty that prohibits anti-competitive arrangements.[tpl]cite press release |title=Commission exempts multilateral interchange fees for cross-border Visa card payments  |publisher=European Commission |date=July 24, 2002 |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/02/1138&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en |accessdate=February 18, 2011[/tpl]  However, this exemption expired on December 31, 2007. In the United Kingdom, MasterCard has reduced its interchange fees while it is under investigation by the Office of Fair Trading.
In January 2007, the European Commission issued the results of a two-year inquiry into the retail banking sector. The report focuses on payment cards and interchange fees. Upon publishing the report, Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the "present level of interchange fees in many of the schemes we have examined does not seem justified." The report called for further study of the issue.[tpl]cite press release |title=Competition: Commission sector inquiry finds major competition barriers in retail banking |publisher=European Commission |date=January 31, 2007 |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/114&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en |accessdate=February 18, 2011[/tpl]
On December 19, 2007, the European Commission issued a decision prohibiting MasterCard's multilateral interchange fee for cross-border payment card transactions with MasterCard and Maestro branded debit and consumer credit cards.  The Commission concluded that this fee violated Article 81 of the EC Treaty that prohibits anti-competitive agreements.[tpl]cite press release |title=Antitrust: Commission prohibits MasterCard's intra-EEA Multilateral Interchange Fees |publisher=European Commission |date=December 19, 2007 |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/1959 |accessdate=February 18, 2011[/tpl]  MasterCard has appealed the Commission's decision before the EU Court of First Instance;  while the appeal is pending MasterCard has temporarily repealed its multilateral interchange fees.
On March 26, 2008, the European Commission opened an investigation into Visa's multilateral interchange fees for cross-border transactions within the EEA as well as into the "Honor All Cards" rule (under which merchants are required to accept all valid Visa-branded cards).[tpl]cite press release |title=Antitrust: Commission initiates formal proceedings against Visa Europe Limited |publisher=European Commission |date=March 26, 2008 |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/170&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en |accessdate=February 18, 2011[/tpl]
The antitrust authorities of EU Member States other than the United Kingdom are also investigating MasterCard's and Visa's interchange fees.  For example, on January 4, 2007, the Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection fined twenty banks a total of PLN 164 million (about $56 million) for jointly setting MasterCard's and Visa's interchange fees.http://www.uokik.gov.pl/en/press_office/press_releases/art72.html.

===Australia and New Zealand===

In 2003, the Reserve Bank of Australia required that interchange fees be dramatically reduced, from about 0.95% of the transaction to approximately 0.5%.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] One notable result has been the reduced use of reward cards and increased use of debit cards. Australia also removed the "no surcharge" rule, a policy established by credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard to prevent merchants from charging a credit card usage fee to the cardholder. A surcharge would mitigate or even exceed the merchant discount paid by a merchant, but would also make the cardholder more reluctant to use the card as the method of payment.  Australia has also made changes to the interchange rates on debit cards, and has considered abolishing interchange fees altogether.
As of November 2006, New Zealand is considering similar actions, following a Commerce Commission lawsuit alleging price-fixing by Visa and MasterCard. In New Zealand, merchants pay a 1.8% fee on every credit card transaction.[tpl]Dubious|date=September 2009[/tpl]
