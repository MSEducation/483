Karachi is ranked as a beta world city.

==History==

===Early history===

Karachi was known to the ancient Greeks by many names: Krokola, the place where Alexander the Great camped to prepare a fleet for Babylonia after his campaign in the Indus Valley; Morontobara (probably Manora island near Karachi harbour), from whence Alexander's admiral Nearchus set sail; and Barbarikon, a port of the Bactrian kingdom. It was later known to the Arabs as Debal from where Muhammad bin Qasim led his conquering force into South Asia in AD 712.http://www.houstonkarachi.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=44%3Akarachi-history&catid=3%3Aabout-hksca&Itemid=11[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]
Karachi was reputedly founded as "Kolachi" by Baloch tribes from Balochistan and Makran, who established a small fishing community in the area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2002/08/08/fea.htm# |title=DAWN – Features; August 8, 2002 |publisher=Dawn.Com |date=8 August 2002 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl] Descendants of the original community still live in the area on the small island of Abdullah Goth, which is located near the Karachi Port. The original name "Kolachi" survives in the name of a well-known Karachi locality named Mai Kolachi in Balochi. Mirza Ghazi Beg, the Mughal administrator of Sindh, is among the first historical figures credited for the development of coastal Sindh (consisting of regions such as the Makran coast and the Mehran delta),[tpl]where|date=February 2014[/tpl] including the cities of Thatta, Bhambore and Karachi.
The village that later grew out of this settlement was known as Kolachi-jo-Goth (Village of Kolachi in Sindhi). By the late 1720s, the village was trading across the Arabian Sea with Muscat and the Persian Gulf region. The local Sindhi populace built a small fort, that was constructed for the protection of the city, armed with cannons imported by Sindhi sailors from Muscat, Oman. The fort had two main gateways: one facing the sea, known as Kharra Darwaaza (Brackish Gate) (Kharadar) and the other facing the Lyari River known as the Meet'ha Darwaaza (Sweet Gate) (Mithadar), which correspond to the modern areas of Kharadar and Mithadar.
The name Karachi was used for the first time in a Dutch document of 1742, when a merchant ship de Ridderkerk shipwrecked nearby its coast.The Dutch East India Company (VOC) and Diewel-Sind (Pakistan) in the 17th and 18th centuries, Floor, W. Institute of Central & West Asian Studies, University of Karachi, 1993–1994, p. 49.The Dutch East India Company's shipping between the Netherlands and Asia 1595-1795

===British rule===

After some exploratory missions to the area, the British East India Company captured the town when HMS Wellesley anchored off Manora island on 1 February 1839. Two days later, the little fort surrendered.[tpl]cite book|title=Recollections of four years' service in the East with H.M. fortieth regiment|last=Neill|first=, John Martin Bladen|authorlink=|coauthors=|year=1846|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=|pages=|url=http://www.archive.org/details/recollectionsoff00neilrich|accessdate=27 November 2009[/tpl] The town was later annexed to British India when Sindh was annexed by Major General Charles James Napier at the Battle of Miani on 17 February 1843.
On his departure in 1847, Napier is said to have remarked, "Would that I could come again to see you in your grandeur!" Karachi was made the capital of Sindh in the 1840s. On Napier's departure, it was added along with the rest of Sindh to the Bombay Presidency, a move that caused resentment among the native Sindhis. The British realised the importance of the city as a military cantonment and as a port for exporting the produce of the Indus River basin, and developed its harbour for shipping. The foundations of a city municipal government were laid down and infrastructure development was undertaken. New businesses opened up and the population of the town began rising.
The arrival of the troops of the Company Bahadur in 1839 spawned the foundation of the new section, the military cantonment. The cantonment formed the basis of the 'white' town, where the native population had restricted access. The 'white' town was modelled after English industrial parent-cities, where work and residential spaces were separated, as were residential from recreational places. The 'native' town in the northwest, was enlarged to accommodate the burgeoning mercantile population. When the Indian Rebellion of 1857 broke out in South Asia, the 21st Native Infantry, then stationed in Karachi, declared allegiance to rebels and joining their numbers on 10 September 1857. Nevertheless, the British were able to quickly reassert control over Karachi and defeat the uprising. Officer William 'Waf' Frost was considered to be instrumental in quelling the rebellion and was rewarded for his valor with an Order of the British Empire. This was awarded to him on 23 April 1858. However, he remains unpopular in areas of Karachi to this day.
In 1864, the first telegraphic message was sent from South Asia to England, when a direct telegraph connection was laid between Karachi and London.Christina P Harris (1969) The Persian Gulf Submarine Telegraph of 1864. The Geographical Journal. vol. 135(2). June. pp. 169–190 In 1878, the city was connected to the rest of British India by rail. Public building projects, such as Frere Hall (1865) and the Empress Market (1890), were undertaken. In 1876, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, was born in the city according to some accounts, which by now had become a bustling city with mosques, temples, courthouses, paved streets and a harbour. By 1899, Karachi had become the largest wheat exporting port in the East.Feldman 1970: Karachi through a hundred years: the centenary history of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry 1860–1960. 2. ed. Karachi: Oxford UP (1960). Before 1880 the majority of the population of Karachi consisted of the indigenous Sindhis and Balochis (who also spoke Sindhi as a second language).
These developments in Karachi resulted in an influx of economic migrants: Parsis, Hindus, Christians, Jews, Marathis, Goan Christian, Chinese, British, Arabs and Gujaratis. The population of the city was about 105,000 inhabitants by the end of the 19th century, with a mix of nationalities. British colonialists embarked on works of sanitation and transportation – such as gravel paved streets, drains, street sweepers, and a network of Trams and horse-drawn trolleys.

===Independent Pakistan===

By the time of Pakistan's independence in 1947, Karachi had become a bustling metropolis with slightly under half a million people, and classical and colonial European styled buildings lining the city's thoroughfares. Karachi was chosen as the capital of Pakistan, which at the time included present-day Bangladesh, approximately [tpl]convert|1000|km|abbr=on[/tpl] to the east, and not physically connected to Pakistan. In 1947, Karachi was the focus for settlement by Muslim Muhajirs fleeing from anti-Muslim pograms  in India, who expanded the city's population and transformed its demographics and economy. In 1958, the capital of Pakistan was moved from Karachi to Rawalpindi.
During the 1960s, Karachi was seen as an economic role model around the world. Many countries sought to emulate Pakistan's economic planning strategy and one of them, South Korea, copied the city's second "Five-Year Plan" and the World Financial Center in Seoul is designed and modeled after Karachi.Planning Commission, The Second Five Year Plan: 1960–65, Karachi: Govt. Printing Press, 1960, p. 393Planning Commission, Pakistan Economic Survey, 1964–65, Rawalpindi: Govt. Printing Press, 1965, p. 212. Karachi had both a municipal corporation and a Karachi Divisional Council in the 1960s, which developed schools, colleges, roads, municipal gardens, and parks. The Karachi Divisional Council had working committees for education, roads, and residential societies development and planning.Government archives, Sindh for Municipality and divisional administration In the late 1960s, the capital shifted from Rawalpindi to the newly built Islamabad. This marked the start of a long period of decline in the city, marked by a lack of development.
On 4 December 1971, the Indian Navy launched Operation Trident and its follow-up Operation Python on Karachi harbour during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 that resulted in the first use of anti-ship missiles in the region, as well as the first sinking of naval vessels during hostilities in the region since World War II. During the operation it also targeted Kemari oil storage tanks on the south of the harbour, which were burnt and destroyed, causing heavy losses to the country. The 1970s also saw major labour struggles in Karachi's industrial estates (see Karachi labour unrest of 1972). The 1980s and 1990s saw an influx of refugees from the Soviet war in Afghanistan into Karachi; they were followed in smaller numbers by refugees escaping from Iran.[tpl]cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=C8D0B7394F7D074D6832875766C3D91E.tomcat1?fromPage=online&aid=1636848|title=Afghan refugees population in Pakistan|work= Cambridge Journal|publisher=Journals.cambridge.org|accessdate=6 May 2010[/tpl] After the 1970s Karachi has become home to about five to seven million Pashtuns, which is more than Peshawar, Kabul or Kandahar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/rough/2009/07/karachis_invisi.html|title=Karachi's Invisible Enemy|author=Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy|publisher=PBS|date=17 July 2009|accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090825/FOREIGN/708249931|title=In a city of ethnic friction, more tinder|publisher=The National|date=24 August 2009|accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl] In the late 1980s and early 1990s, ethnic and political violence broke out across the city between Muhajir followers of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement fought with ethnic Sindhis, Pashtuns, Punjabis, and security forces.

Today, Karachi is an important financial and industrial centre and handles most of the overseas trade of Pakistan and the world, mainly the Asian countries. It accounts for a significant share of the GDP of Pakistan.

==Geography==

Karachi is located in the south of Pakistan, on the coast of the Arabian Sea. Its geographic coordinates are 24°51′ N 67°02′ E. Most of the land consisted largely of flat or rolling plains, with hills on the western and Manora Island and the Oyster Rocks. The Arabian Sea beach lines the southern coastline of Karachi. Mangroves and creeks of the Indus delta can be found toward the southeast side of the city. Toward the west and the north is Cape Monze, locally known as Ras Muari, an area marked by projecting sea cliffs and rocky sandstone promontories. Some excellent beaches can be found in this area. Khasa Hills lie in the northwest and form the border between North Nazimabad TownA story behind every name and Orangi Town. The Manghopir Hills lies northwest of Karachi, between Hub River and Manghopir.
The rivers in Karachi are Malir River and Lyari River.  The Indus River flood plain is near Karachi.

===Climate===

Located on the coast, Karachi has an arid climate with low average precipitation levels (approx. [tpl]convert|250|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] per annum), the bulk of which occurs during the July–August monsoon season. Winters are mild and dry, while the summers are warm and humid; the proximity to the sea maintains humidity levels at a near-constant high and cool sea breezes relieve the heat of the summer months. December and January are dry and pleasant as compared to the warm summers that dominate through the late spring (March) to the pre-monsoon season (June). Compared to other parts of Pakistan, Karachi's weather is considered mild and can be compared to Florida's weather (except for the precipitation).
The city's highest monthly rainfall, [tpl]convert|429.3|mm|abbr=on[/tpl], occurred in July 1967.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pakmet.com.pk/cdpc/extrems/KARACHI.htm|title=Climate data – Karachi|publisher=Pakistan Meteorological Department, Government of Pakistan|accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] The city's highest rainfall in 24 hours occurred on 7 August 1953, when about [tpl]convert|278.1|mm|in[/tpl] of rain lashed the city, resulting in major flooding.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Karachi's highest recorded temperature is [tpl]convert|47|C|abbr=on[/tpl], which was recorded on 18 June 1979, and the lowest is [tpl]convert|0.0|C|F[/tpl], recorded on 21 January 1934.

==Economy==

Karachi is the financial and commercial capital of Pakistan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://14.192.147.139/CDGK/Portals/0/Department/Master%20Plan/App%20KSDP-2020%20VERSION%20ANNEXURE1.pdf |title=Annexures |publisher=City District Government Karachi |date= |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl] In line with its status as a major port and the country's largest metropolis, it accounts for a lion's share of Pakistan's revenue. According to the Federal Board of Revenue's 2006–2007 year book, tax and customs units in Karachi were responsible for 46.75% of direct taxes, 33.65% of federal excise tax, and 23.38% of domestic sales tax.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbr.gov.pk/YearBook/2006-2007/FBRyearbook2006-2007.pdf|title=Federal Board of Revenue Year Book 2006–2007|accessdate=12 April 2009[/tpl] Karachi accounts for 75.14% of customs duty and 79% of sales tax on imports. Therefore, Karachi collects 53.38% of the total collections of the Federal Board of Revenue, out of which 53.33% are customs duty and sales tax on imports. (Note: Revenue collected from Karachi includes revenue from some other areas since the Large Tax Unit (LTU) Karachi and Regional Tax Offices (RTOs) Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur & Quetta cover the entire province of Sindh and Balochistan). Karachi's indigenous contribution to national revenue is around 25%.
Karachi's contribution to Pakistan's manufacturing sector amounts to approximately 30 percent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pakistaneconomist.com/database2/cover/c99-15.asp|title=Karachi: Step-motherly treatment|author=Pakistan and Gulf Economist|accessdate=15 October 2007[/tpl] A substantial part of Sindh's gross domestic product (GDP) is attributed to Karachi[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spdc-pak.com/pubs/pubdisp.asp?id=nps5|title=Provincial Accounts of Pakistan: Methodology and Estimates|author=Social Policy and Development Center|accessdate=1 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2006/02/21/ebr3.htm|title=Sindh, Balochistan's share in GDP drops|author=Dawn Group of Newspapers|accessdate=1 January 2009[/tpl] (the GDP of Sindh as a percentage of Pakistan's total GDP has traditionally hovered around 28%–30%; for more information, see economy of Sindh).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2007/06/16/ebr3.htm|title=Sindh's GDP estimated at Rs 240 billion|author=Dawn Group of Newspapers|accessdate=1 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2004/12/02/ebr1.htm|title=Sindh share in GDP falls by 1pc|author=Dawn Group of Newspapers|accessdate=1 January 2009[/tpl] Karachi's GDP is around 20% of the total GDP of Pakistan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/Documents/Produced-Under-TA/38405/38405-PAK-DPTA.pdf|title=Karachi Mega-Cities Preparation Project|author=Asian Development Bank|accessdate=1 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/karachi.htm|title=The Karachi Coastline Case|author=The Trade & Environment Database|accessdate=1 January 2009[/tpl] A PricewaterhouseCoopers study released in 2009, which surveyed the 2008 GDP of the top cities in the world, calculated Karachi's GDP (PPP) to be $78 billion[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.ukmediacentre.pwc.com/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=3421&NewsAreaID=2|title=Global city GDP rankings 2008–2025|publisher=PricewaterhouseCoopers|accessdate=12 February 2010[/tpl] (projected to be $193 billion in 2025 at a growth rate of 5.5%). It confirmed Karachi's status as Pakistan's largest economy, well ahead of the next two biggest cities Lahore and Faisalabad, which had a reported GDP (PPP) in 2008 of $40 billion and $14 billion, respectively. Karachi's high GDP is based on its industrial base, with a high dependency on the financial sector. Textiles, cement, steel, heavy machinery, chemicals, food, banking and insurance are the major segments contributing to Karachi's GDP. In February 2007, the World Bank identified Karachi as the most business-friendly city in Pakistan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2007/02/14/ebr1.htm|title=World Bank report: Karachi termed most business-friendly|author=Dawn Group of Newspapers|accessdate=15 October 2007[/tpl]
Karachi is the nerve center of Pakistan's economy. The economic stagnation caused by political anarchy, ethnic strife and resultant military operation during the late 1980s and 1990s led to an exit of industry from Karachi. Most of Pakistan's public and private banks are headquartered on Karachi's I. I. Chundrigar Road; according to a 2001 report, nearly 60% of the cashflow of the Pakistani economy takes place on I. I. Chundrigar Road. Most major foreign multinational corporations operating in Pakistan have their headquarters in Karachi. The Karachi Stock Exchange is the largest stock exchange in Pakistan, and is considered by many economists to be one of the prime reasons for Pakistan's 8% GDP growth across 2005.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/apr2005/nf20050422_9277_db016.htm |title=Pakistan: After the Crash |publisher=Businessweek |date=21 April 2005 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl] A recent report by Credit Suisse on Pakistan's stock market is a testimonial to its strong fundamentals, estimating Pakistan's relative return on equities at 26.7 percent, compared to Asia's 11 percent.[tpl]cite news|last=Thakur |first=Pooja |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&tkr=ENGRO%3APA&sid=afU5S7jTdEl4 |title=Pakistan Stocks May Advance, Credit Suisse Says (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg |date=24 August 2009 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]
Karachi has seen an expansion of information and communications technology and electronic media and has become the software outsourcing hub of Pakistan. Call centres for foreign companies have been targeted as a significant area of growth, with the government making efforts to reduce taxes by as much as 10% to gain foreign investments in the IT sector.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pakboi.gov.pk/pdf/IT%20&%20Telecom.pdf |title=Sector Overview |publisher=Pakistan Board of Investment |date= |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN015892.pdf |title=Information technology policy of Pakistan |publisher=United Nations Public Administration Network |date= |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl] Many of Pakistan's independent television and radio stations are based in Karachi, including world-popular Business Plus, AAJ News, Geo TV, KTN,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ktn.com.pk|title=Welcome to KTN TV|publisher=KTN|accessdate=20 February 2008[/tpl] Sindh TV,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thesindh.tv/contact.htm|title=Sindh TV|publisher=Sindh TV|accessdate=20 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080102071108/http://www.thesindh.tv/contact.htm |archivedate = 2 January 2008[/tpl] CNBC Pakistan, TV ONE, ARY Digital, Indus Television Network, Samaa TV and Dawn News, as well as several local stations.

As one of the most rapidly growing cities in the world, Karachi faces challenges that are central to many developing metropolises, including traffic congestion, pollution, poverty and street crime.

==Civic administration==

The first form of government was a conservancy board established in 1846 to control the spread of cholera in the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://221.132.118.186/cdgk/Home/Government/CDGKHistory/tabid/276/Default.aspx|title=CDGK History|publisher=City-District Government of Karachi|accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl] The board became a municipal commission in 1852, and a municipal committee the following year. The City of Karachi Municipal Act of 1933 transformed the city administration into a municipal corporation with a mayor, a deputy mayor and 57 councillors. In 1948, the Federal Capital Territory of Pakistan was created, comprising approximately [tpl]convert|2103|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] of Karachi and surrounding areas, but this was merged into the province of West Pakistan in 1961.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/upk.html|title=Pakistan Provinces|publisher=Statoids.com|accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl] However, the municipal corporation remained in existence and in 1976 became a metropolitan corporation, followed by the creation of zonal municipal committees, which lasted until 1994. Two years later the metropolitan area was divided into five districts, each with a municipal corporation.
In 2001, five districts of Karachi were merged to form the city district of Karachi. It was structured as a three-tier federation, with the two lower tiers composed of 18 towns and 178 union councils,[tpl]cite web|url=http://221.132.118.186/cdgk/Home/Towns/tabid/72/Default.aspx|title=CDGK Towns|publisher=City District Government of Karachi|accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl] with each tier focussed on elected councils with some common members to provide "vertical linkage" within the federation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nrb.gov.pk/local_government/default.asp|title=Local Government |publisher=National Reconstruction Bureau, Government of Pakistan|accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl] Each union council comprised thirteen members elected from specified electorates: four men and two women elected directly by the general population; two men and two women elected by peasants and workers; one member for minority communities; two members are elected jointly as the union mayor (nazim) and deputy union mayor (naib nazim).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nrb.gov.pk/local_government/union_admin_07.htm |title=Composition of the Union Council|publisher=National Reconstruction Bureau, Government of Pakistan |accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl] Each town council was comprised all of the deputy union mayors in the town as well as elected representatives for women, peasants and workers, and minorities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nrb.gov.pk/local_government/tehsil_mucipal_admin_02.htm|title=Tehsil and Town Councils|publisher=National Reconstruction Bureau, Government of Pakistan |accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl] The district council was comprised all of the union mayors in the district as well as elected representatives for women, peasants and workers, and minorities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nrb.gov.pk/local_government/district_government_02.htm|title=Zila Council|publisher=National Reconstruction Bureau, Government of Pakistan |accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl] Each council was also included up to three council secretaries and a number of other civil servants. Naimatullah Khan was the first Nazim of Karachi and Shafiq-Ur-Rehman Paracha was the first district co-ordination officer (DCO) of Karachi, Paracha even served as the last Commissioner of Karachi. Syed Mustafa Kamal was elected City Nazim of Karachi to succeed Naimatullah Khan in 2005 elections, and Nasreen Jalil was elected as the City Naib Nazim.
Again in 2011, City District Government of Karachi has been de-merged into its five original constituent districts namely Karachi East, Karachi West, Karachi Central, Karachi South and Malir. These five districts form the Karachi Division now.[tpl]cite web|last=Aligi |first=Irfan |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/208342/changing-hands-karachi-split-into-5-districts/ |title=Changing hands: Karachi split into 5 districts – The Express Tribune |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date= |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://kmc.gov.pk.sv2.premiumwebserver.com/ |title=Welcome to official website of Karachi Metropolitan Corporation |publisher=Kmc.gov.pk.sv2.premiumwebserver.com |date= |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl] City administrator is Muhammad Hussain Syed[tpl]cite web|url=http://kmc.gov.pk.sv2.premiumwebserver.com/Contents.aspx?id=21 |title=Administrator Karachi |publisher=Kmc.gov.pk.sv2.premiumwebserver.com |date= |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl] and Municipal Commissioner of Karachi is Matanat Ali Khan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kmc.gov.pk.sv2.premiumwebserver.com/Contents.aspx?id=54 |title=Metropolitan Commissioner |publisher=Kmc.gov.pk.sv2.premiumwebserver.com |date= |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl] There are also six military cantonments which are administered by the Military.

==Demographics==

Karachi's inhabitants, locally known as Karachiites, are composed of ethno-linguistic groups from all parts of Pakistan, as well as migrants from South Asia, making the city's population a diverse melting pot. At the end of the 19th century, the population of the city was about 105,000, with a gradual increase over the next few decades, reaching more than 400,000 on the eve of independence. Estimates of the population range from 15 to 18 million,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91009748|title=The Urban Frontier—Karachi|publisher=NPR|date=2 June 2008|accessdate=17 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2007/07/10/local5.htm|title=Karachi population to hit 27.5 million in 2020|work=Dawn|date=10 July 2007|accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl] of which an estimated 90% are migrants from different backgrounds. The city's population is estimated to be growing at about 5% per year (mainly as a result of internal rural-urban migration), including an estimated 45,000 migrant workers coming to the city every month from different parts of Pakistan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2006/01/16/letted.htm#1|title=Karachi turning into a ghetto|date=16 January 2006|work=Dawn|accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]
The earliest inhabitants of the area that became Karachi were Sindhi tribes such as the Jokhio, Mallaah and Jat in the east and Baloch in the west and. Before the end of British colonial rule and the subsequent independence of Pakistan in 1947, the population of the city was majority Sindhi and Baloch Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs, but the community is still present numbering around 250,000 residents.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pakistanhinducouncil.org/hindupopulation.asp |title=Population of Hindus in the World |publisher=http://pakistanhinducouncil.org |accessdate=21 April 2013[/tpl] The city was, and still is home to a large community of Gujarati Muslims who were one of the earliest settlers in the city, and still form the majority in Saddar Town. Important Gujarati Muslim communities in the city include the Memon, Chhipa, Ghanchi, Khoja, Bohra and Tai. Other early settlers included the Marwari Muslims, Parsis originally from Iran, Marathi Muslims and Konkani Muslims from Maharashtra (settled in Kokan Town), Goan Catholics and Anglo-Indians. Most non-Muslims left the city to India in the 1950s, after independence, but there are still small communities of Parsis, Goan Catholics and Anglo-Indians in the city.
The independence of Pakistan in 1947 saw the influx of Muslim Muhajirs from India fleeing from anti-Muslim pograms. The majority of the Urdu-speaking and other non-Punjabi Muslim refugees that fled from various Indian states settled in Karachi, which is why the culture of the city is a blend of South Asia. Most of the property vacated by non-Muslims, who left Karachi due to the new settlements made by these refugees, were granted to Muslim refugees through claims on behalf of the property they claimed leaving behind in India.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merinews.com/article/political-and-ethnic-battles-turn-karachi-into-beirut-of-south-asia/15875445.shtml|title=Political and ethnic battles turn Karachi into Beirut of South Asia " Crescent |publisher=Merinews.com |date= |accessdate=24 November 2012[/tpl] Today, the descendants of these Muslim refugees are known as Muhajirs and form a large, powerful group in Karachi. These Muhajirs include Urdu, Gujarati, Marathi, Konkani, Rajasthani, and Malabari Muslims from India. There are around 10 million Biharis and Bengali from Bangladesh. The majority of the Gujaratis in Karachi are ethno-linguistically Sindhis; the majority of Rajasthani Muslims settled in the city much before the independence of Pakistan in 1947; the Bihari of Bangladesh speak Bhojpuri, Bengali Muslims speak Bengali and Rohingya speak the Rohingya language. These small ethno-linguistic groups are being assimilated in the Urdu-speaking community.
After independence of Pakistan, a considerable number of Punjabi Muslims from Pakistani Punjab settle in Karachi. There is also a sizeable community of Kashmiri Muslims from the Kashmir Valley Marathi Hindus and Malayali Muslims in Karachi (the Mappila), originally from Kerala in South India.[tpl]cite web|author=M R Narayan Swamy |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report_where-malayalees-once-held-sway_4610 |title=Where Malayalees once held sway | Latest News & Updates at |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=5 October 2005 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]
The Pashtuns, originally from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Afghanistan, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and northern Balochistan, are now the city's second largest ethnic group after Muhajirs, these Pashtuns are settled in Karachi from decades. The city of Karachi in Pakistan has the largest concentration of urban Pakhtun population in the world, including 50,000 registered Afghan refugees in the city,[tpl]cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/43827/the-pakhtun-in-karachi/ |title=Columnists | The Pakhtun in Karachi |work=Time |date=28 August 2010 |accessdate=8 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefridaytimes.com/beta2/tft/article.php?issue=20110715&page=5 |title=Report: Demographic divide by Zia Ur Rehman |publisher=Thefridaytimes.com |date= |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl] meaning there are more Pashtuns in Karachi than in any other city in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.dawn.com/2009/02/10/local9.htm|title=UN body, police baffled by minister's threat against Afghan refugees|publisher=Dawn Media Group|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=24 January 2012[/tpl] As per current demographic ratio Pashtuns are about 25% of Karachi's population.Report: Demographic divide by Zia Ur Rehman

===Architecture===

Karachi has a collection of buildings and structures of varied architectural styles. The downtown districts of Saddar and Clifton contain early 20th-century architecture, ranging in style from the neo-classical KPT building to the Sindh High Court Building. During the period of British rule, classical architecture was preferred for monuments of the British Raj. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] Karachi acquired its first neo-Gothic or Indo-Gothic buildings when Frere Hall, Empress Market and St. Patrick's Cathedral were completed. The Mock Tudor architectural style was introduced in the Karachi Gymkhana and the Boat Club. Neo-Renaissance architecture was popular in the 19th century and was the language for St. Joseph's Convent (1870) and the Sind Club (1883).[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.historickarachi.com/heritage_revisited.htm | title=Heritage Revisited| publisher=Historickarachi.com| accessdate=26 August 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822124715/http://www.historickarachi.com/heritage_revisited.htm |archivedate = 22 August 2008[/tpl] The classical style made a comeback in the late 19th century, as seen in Lady Dufferin Hospital (1898)[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.historickarachi.com/public_arch_5.htm | title=Public Arch 5| publisher=Historickarachi.com| accessdate=26 August 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024103906/http://www.historickarachi.com/public_arch_5.htm |archivedate = 24 October 2007[/tpl] and the Cantt. Railway Station. While Italianate buildings remained popular, an eclectic blend termed Indo-Saracenic or Anglo-Mughal began to emerge in some locations.
The local mercantile community began acquiring impressive structures. Zaibunnisa Street in the Saddar area (known as Elphinstone Street in British days) is an example where the mercantile groups adopted the Italianate and Indo-Saracenic style to demonstrate their familiarity with Western culture and their own. The Hindu Gymkhana (1925) and Mohatta Palace are examples of Mughal revival buildings.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.historickarachi.com/public_arch_1.htm | title=Public Architecture| publisher=Historickarachi.com| accessdate=26 August 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080415174246/http://www.historickarachi.com/public_arch_1.htm |archivedate = 15 April 2008[/tpl] The Sindh Wildlife Conservation Building, located in Saddar, served as a Freemasonic Lodge until it was taken over by the government. There are talks of it being taken away from this custody and being renovated and the Lodge being preserved with its original woodwork and ornate wooden staircase.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008\09\30\story_30-9-2008_pg12_9|title=Culture department takes notice of Freemason Lodge Building|work=Daily Times|accessdate=16 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]

The city has examples of modern Islamic architecture, including the Aga Khan University hospital, Masjid e Tooba, Faran Mosque, Bait-ul Mukarram Mosque, Quaid's Mausoleum, and the Textile Institute of Pakistan.
