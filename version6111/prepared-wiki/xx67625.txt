==History==

===16th - 18th Century===

thumb|left|Brentwood School and the Martyr's Elm, 1847The licence to found the school, as "The Grammar School of Antony Browne, Serjeant at the Law, in Brentwood" was granted by Queen Mary to Sir Antony Browne on 5 July 1558, and the first Schoolmaster, George Otway, was appointed on 28 July 1558.
In 1568 the school moved to a purpose built school room, which still remains, the commemoration stone of which was laid by Browne's stepdaughter Dorothy Huddleston, and her husband Edward, Browne having died in 1567."Historical Notes" from "Brentwood School, School Lists" (AKA The Blue Book)
The school room was next to the site where nineteen-year-old William Hunter was burned to death for refusing to accept the transubstantiation of bread and wine into the body and blood of Jesus Christ. The Martyr's Elm grew on the spot of his incineration.
Browne had sentenced Hunter when Justice of the Peace for the area under Queen Mary and, although she also issued the licence, some mistakenly believe the school was founded as penance for Hunter's martyrdom when Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne.
Although Browne drew up the school statutes, these were never legally adopted, so were re-drawn by his descendants and John Donne, Dean of St Paul's, in 1622.

===19th Century===

Brentwood School Combined Cadet Force (CCF) was founded in 1861 and as such it is one of the earliest CCFs in the country.http://www.brentwoodschool.co.uk/senior-school/combined-cadet-force

===20th Century===

During the First World War sixty Old Brentwoods were killed and during the Second World War one hundred and seventy-three were killed. Their names are listed in the School Chapel and commemorated by the Memorial Hall for the First War and the pavilion for the Second War.
In the 1960s and early 1970s the school was a direct grant grammar school, until the abolition of the scheme in the mid-1970s.
Originally a boys' school, in 1974, the Governors made the decision to allow a small number of girls to enter the Sixth form. 1974 saw the first girl, Lesley Hall, join Brentwood School as a full-time pupil in the Sixth Form and by the early 1980s there were 23 girls in the School's Sixth Form. Initially in Newnum House, the Girls' School opened in 1988, admitting girls from ages 11 to 18, with the Preparatory School following suit ten years later in 1998.
The FoBS (Friends of Brentwood School) was founded in 1982 to help raise funds within the school, mainly via large events and excursions for pupils.

===21st Century===

In 2007, Brentwood School celebrated its 450th anniversary in St Paul's Cathedral with a special commemorative service.
The School's Combined Cadet Force (CCF) celebrated its 150th anniversary on 8th October 2011 by holding a special afternoon of events featuring a Guard of Honour by Lt General Brown CBE. The Royal British Legion Youth Band of Brentwood played at the start and end of the afternoon.http://www.brentwoodschool.co.uk/senior-school/senior-school-news/ccf-150th-anniversary-at-brentwood-school.html
In 2013, the school celebrated its best ever International Baccalaureate results with an average point score of 36 - 38% of students distinguishing themselves by achieving more than 40 points. The School achieved another 100% pass rate for all Upper Sixth A Level students and saw 52% of top scorers achieve A*-A grades. Twelve-year-old Andrew Ejemai scored an A* grade in his Maths A Level making him the youngest student in the School's history to pass the qualification.http://www.brentwoodgazette.co.uk/12-year-old-Brentwood-maths-whizz-gains-level/story-19661853-detail/story.html Just over 80% of students gained their first choice university place and 65% of those secured a spot at one of the top twenty universities, including the Russell Group. As of April 2014, 11 students of the current cohort are holding offers of places to study at Oxbridge universities.http://www.brentwoodschool.co.uk/sixth-form/news--1/students-celebrate-early-offers-to-top-universities-including-11-offers-from-oxford-and-cambridge.html

==Traditions==

===School Motto===

The school has two mottos: Virtue, learning and manners derived from the school statutes of 1622 and Incipe, a Latin motto (meaning "to begin" or "to start") added in the 19th century. Nowadays, the school promotes Incipe as "make a good start", especially to first year Senior school pupils and throughout the Preparatory School which has a publication named after it. However, it is recognised that Virtue, learning and manners is the official whole school motto.

===School Arms===

The Coat of Arms of Brentwood School are derived from those of the founder of the School, Sir Antony Browne and his wife.
As part of the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the School's founding, a special variant of Sir Antony Browne's Coat of Arms was granted by the Honourable Sir George Rothe Bellew, Garter Principal King of Arms and Sir John Dunamace Heaton-Armstrong, Clarenceux King of Arms on July 19, 1957. A red border was added to the Arms to distinguish them as the School's, as opposed to those of Sir Antony Browne.Christe-Murray, David. The Arms of Brentwood School. Middlesex; Hubners Ltd.

===Houses===

There are five day houses and two boarding houses. The day houses are named North Town, South Town, East Town, West Town and Weald, together with the two boarding houses, Mill Hill for girls and Hough House for boys; the latter two making up a sixth house, School house. Prior to the mid-1940s the school was entirely boarding, however, as Brentwood grew into the large commuter town that it is today, demand for day education increased and accordingly the number of boarding houses was reduced. It remains one of only a select few schools in the country in which boarding students have their own rooms rather than shared dormitories. The boarding house consists of mainly academic individuals from other countries, namely China, Russia, India and predominantly Germany, who must pass an internal exam to gain entrance.
Competitions in sport, music, drama, debating and various other activities are held on a regular basis between the houses. Each house has its own styled tie, for North the defining colour is yellow, for South it is red, East's is light blue, West's is dark blue, Weald is represented by claret and the male and female boarders of the school have separate ties of maroon with two bordering white stripes and green ties respectively.

===Praepostors===

Brentwood School each year elects a select group of Sixth Form students to become Praepostors (Praes). These are usually students who are particularly notable at certain academic or sporting subjects, involved in the local community and well-liked. Therefore, it is assumed that they are capable and mature enough to hold a position of prestige.
Obtaining the position Praepostor (Prae) means increased responsibility in the School. Praes are asked to return to school outside of normal school hours to help organise and facilitate events; they are also the main representatives of the student community throughout the whole school. Senior Praes are Praepostors with an even greater level of responsibility and are typically asked to contribute more. They are also expect to delegate work to other Praes and students.
The Head of School is selected by the student who gains the greatest amount of votes among staff.

==Today==

The school is separated into three main sections: Senior School (ages 11 to 16), Sixth Form (ages 16 to 18) and the Preparatory School (ages 3 to 11). Brentwood now operates in a diamond school format where the preparatory school and sixth form are co-educational while the senior school remains segregated.

===Preparatory School===

Brentwood Preparatory School teaches children aged 3-11, from Nursery through to Year 6. Classes are usually small, with an average size of 20 per class made up of mixed genders. The Preparatory follows the National Curriculum, however teaches some supplementary subjects such as French and Latin. There is also a broad extracurricular programme that all pupils are encouraged to follow, featuring Dance, Drama and Music, as well as sports such as Hockey and Golf.http://www.brentwoodschool.co.uk/preparatory-school

==Development of the School Site==

Brentwood School continues to ameliorate and develop the School site with extensive building development and refurbishment.

===Sixth Form Centre===

In 2009, the School began an extensive redevelopment of the former Brentwood Vicarage (the Otway building) to create a new Sixth Form Centre. The architects tasked with this project were Cottrell & Vermeulen Architects, who designed the new Sixth Form Centre over three interconnecting blocks. The original Otway building was fully refurbished to provide a common room and study area for Sixth Formers. It was linked to two entirely new buildings: a block of classrooms split over three levels and a 400-seat auditorium complete with a green room. The development was opened by HRH Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex in November 2011 and the auditorium was christened 'The Wessex Auditorium' in commemoration of the visit.

====RIBA Award====

In 2012, Brentwood School's Sixth Form Centre was winner of the Royal Institute of British Architecture (RIBA) East England Award. The institute described the development as having drawn "inspiration from the existing Victorian vicarage" and that "the new design is expressed in a language that is both contextual and contemporary. The sculpting of the roofs creates non-standard, domestic-scaled classrooms filled with natural light, reminiscent of the gabled roofs of the Victorian vicarage, but with an added measure of playfulness."http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAAwards/2012/East/BrentwoodSchoolSixthFormCentreAssemblyHall/BrentwoodSchoolSixthFormCentreAssemblyHall.aspx#.U0expKhdWSo

===Learning Resource Centre===

Continuing its modernisation programme, in 2013 Brentwood School began developing a new Learning Resource Centre at the heart of the School site by refurbishing and extending the Bean Library and Cunliffe building. The work is expected to be completed in 2015.

==Alumni==

thumb|right|The official alumni logo for the Old Brentwoods communityBrentwood School Alumni are known as Old Brentwoods. 
Old Brentwoods are former pupils and students who have attended the School (Preparatory, Senior School and Sixth Form). This is true to any pupil who has attended Brentwood School for any amount of time, as leavers may not necessarily be departing after Sixth Form, at the end of the Fifth Form in the Senior School or at the end of Year 6 in the Preparatory.
The logo that is used to represent Old Brentwoods and the Society of Old Brentwoods is the wing and claw, derived from the Coat of Arms of Sir Antony Browne. The wing is taken from the top of the crest and the eagle from the Coat of Arms’ shield; the claw is also derived from the shield. The crown was added to the logo in 1957 to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II’s visit to Brentwood School.http://www.brentwoodschool.co.uk/about-us/school-history-2
The colours of Old Brentwoods are dark blue, light blue and gold. Light blue and dark blue were traditionally featured as stripes on the blazers of Old Brentwoods and are still used today to represent the alumni community. The colours were carried across to the alumni logo, with the addition of gold upon the inclusion of the crown in 1957.
