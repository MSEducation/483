Books he illustrated included Jack London's A Daughter of the Snows, Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Dawn of a To-morrow and Henry Cabot Lodge's Story of the American Revolution.  He studied at the Indianapolis Art School during his first student year and then studied at the Art Students League of New York under Henry Siddons Mowbray (1858-1928).
