===Beginnings===

The name "Chicago" is derived from a French rendering of the Native American word shikaakwa, translated as "wild onion" or "wild garlic", from the Miami-Illinois language.[tpl]cite book|last=Andreas|first=Alfred T.|title=History of Chicago|year=1884|publisher=Arno Press|location=Chicago|pages=37–38|volume=1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wP0TAAAAYAAJ&dq=History%20of%20Chicago%20From%20the%20Earliest%20Period%20to%20the%20Present%20Time&pg=PA37|accessdate=December 5, 2013|chapter=Origin of the Word Chicago[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal| author=Swenson, John F. | title = Chicagoua/Chicago: The origin, meaning, and etymology of a place name | journal=Illinois Historical Journal | volume = 84 | issue = 4 | date = Winter 1991 | pages = 235–248 | issn = 0748-8149 | oclc = 25174749 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://linguistlist.org/issues/12/12-3157.html|title= "Chicago" Etymology|author=McCafferty, Michael|date=December 21, 2001|publisher=The LINGUIST List |accessdate=October 22, 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|last=McCafferty|first=Michael|date=Summer 2003|title=A Fresh Look at the Place Name Chicago|journal=Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society|volume=96|issue=2|publisher=Illinois State Historical Society|issn=1522-1067|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3945/is_200307/ai_n9266765/?tag=content;col1|accessdate=October 22, 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] The first known reference to the site of the current city of Chicago as "Checagou" was by Robert de LaSalle around 1679 in a memoir written about the time.[tpl]cite book|last=Quaife|first=Milo M.|title=Checagou: From Indian Wigwam to Modern City, 1673–1835|year=1933|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Ill|oclc=1865758[/tpl] Henri Joutel, in his journal of 1688, noted that the wild garlic, called "chicagoua," grew abundantly in the area.

===Founding and 19th century===

On August 12, 1833, the Town of Chicago was organized with a population of around 200. Within seven years it would grow to a population of over 4,000. On June 15, 1835, the first public land sales commenced with Edmund Dick Taylor as U.S. receiver of public moneys. The City of Chicago was incorporated on Saturday, March 4, 1837 and went on to become the fastest growing city in the world for several decades.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-03-04/news/0303040230_1_first-inaugural-address-iran-contra-affair-comic-actor-john-candy|title=On March 4, 1837, the city of Chicago was incorporated and ... |publisher=2011 Tribune Company|date=March 4, 2003|accessdate=September 4, 2012[/tpl]
As the site of the Chicago Portage,[tpl]sfnp|Keating|2005|p=27[/tpl] the city emerged as an important transportation hub between the eastern and western United States. Chicago's first railway, Galena and Chicago Union Railroad, opened in 1848, which also marked the opening of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. The canal allowed steamboats and sailing ships on the Great Lakes to connect to the Mississippi River.[tpl]sfnp|Buisseret|1990|pp=86-98[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=30–31[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=24-25[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Keating|2005|pp=26-29, 35-39[/tpl]
A flourishing economy brought residents from rural communities and immigrants from abroad. Manufacturing and retail and finance sectors became dominant, influencing the American economy.[tpl]cite web|last=Conzen|first=Michael|title=Global Chicago|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/277.html|work=The Economic Rivalry between St. Louis and Chicago|publisher=Encyclopedia of Chicago[/tpl] The Chicago Board of Trade (established 1848) listed the first ever standardized 'exchange traded' forward contracts, which were called futures contracts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cmegroup.com/company/history/timeline-of-achievements.html |title=Timeline-of-achievements |publisher=CME Group|accessdate=January 20, 2013[/tpl]
In the 1850s Chicago gained national political prominence as the home of Senator Stephen Douglas, the champion of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and "popular sovereignty" approach to the issue of the spread of slavery.[tpl]cite web|title=Stephen Douglas|url=http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/spcl/excat/douglas5.html|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=May 29, 2011[/tpl] These issues also helped propel another Illinoisan, Abraham Lincoln, to the national stage. Lincoln was nominated in Chicago for the nation's presidency at the 1860 Republican National Convention and went on to defeat Douglas in the general election, setting the stage for the American Civil War.[tpl]cite web|title=Lincoln nominated for presidency|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lincoln-nominated-for-presidency|work=History Channel|publisher=A&E Television Networks|accessdate=April 11, 2013[/tpl]
To accommodate rapid population growth and demand for better sanitation, the city implemented various infrastructural improvements. In February 1856, the Chesbrough plan for the building of the United States' first comprehensive sewerage system was approved by the Common Council.[tpl]cite web|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/chn.html#y1856_m02_d14 |title=Chicago Daily Tribune, Thursday Morning, February 14 |publisher=nike-of-samothrace.net |accessdate=May 4, 2009[/tpl] The project raised much of central Chicago to a new grade. While raising Chicago, and at first improving the health of the city, the untreated sewage and industrial waste now flowed into the Chicago River, then into Lake Michigan, polluting the primary source of fresh water for the city.
The city responded by tunneling two miles (3 km) out into Lake Michigan to newly built water cribs. In 1900, the problem of sewage contamination was largely resolved when the city completed a major engineering feat. It reversed the flow of the Chicago River so that the water flowed away from Lake Michigan rather than into it. This project began with the construction and improvement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and was completed with the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal that connects to the Illinois River, which flows into the Mississippi River.[tpl]sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=15-18, 243-245[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=27-29, 38-43[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Buisseret|1990|pp=154-155, 172-173, 204-205[/tpl]
In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire broke out, destroying an area of about 4 miles long and 1 mile wide, a large section of the city at the time.[tpl]sfnp|Buisseret|1990|pp=148-149[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=32-37[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Lowe|2000|pp=87–97[/tpl] Much of the city, including railroads and stockyards, survived intact,[tpl]sfnp|Lowe|2000|p=99[/tpl] and from the ruins of the previous wooden structures arose more modern constructions of steel and stone which would set the precedent for worldwide construction.[tpl]cite web|last=Bruegmann|first=Robert|title=Built Environment of the Chicago Region |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/181.html|work=Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|accessdate=December 5, 2013|authorlink=Robert Bruegmann|year=2005[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=9-11[/tpl] During its rebuilding period, Chicago constructed the world's first skyscraper in 1885, using steel-skeleton construction.[tpl]cite journal |last=Allen|first=Frederick E.|date=February 2003 |title=Where They Went to See the Future |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2003/1/2003_1_68.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220103637/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2003/1/2003_1_68.shtml |archivedate=February 20, 2007 |journal= American Heritage |volume=54 |issue=1 |accessdate=December 5, 2013[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Lowe|2000|pp=121, 129[/tpl]
Chicago's flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new immigrants from Europe and migrants from the Eastern United States. Of the total population in 1900 no less than 77% were foreign-born, or born in the United States of foreign parentage. Germans, Irish, Poles, Swedes and Czechs made up nearly two-thirds of the foreign-born population (by 1900, whites were 98.1% of the city's population).[tpl]cite web|title=Chicago: Population|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31156/31156-h/31156-h.htm#ar148|work=1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=December 5, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html[/tpl]
Labor conflicts followed the industrial boom and the rapid expansion of the labor pool, including the Haymarket affair on May 4, 1886.

During the 1870s and 1880s, Chicago attained national stature as the leader in the movement to improve public health. City, and later state laws, that upgraded standards for the medical profession and fought urban epidemics of cholera, small pox, and yellow fever were not only passed, but also enforced. These in turn became templates for public health reform in many other cities and states.[tpl]cite journal |first=Clinton |last=Sandvick |year=2009 |title=Enforcing Medical Licensing in Illinois: 1877–1890 |journal=Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=67–74 |pmid=19562006 |pmc=2701151[/tpl]
The city invested in many large, well-landscaped municipal parks, which also included public sanitation facilities. The chief advocate and driving force for improving public health in Chicago was Dr. John H. Rauch, M.D., who established a plan for Chicago's park system in 1866, created Lincoln Park by closing a cemetery filled with festering, shallow graves, and helped establish a new Chicago Board of Health in 1867 in response to an outbreak of cholera. Ten years later he became the secretary and then the president of the first Illinois State Board of Health, which carried out most of its activities in Chicago.[tpl]cite journal |first=William K. |last=Beatty |year=1991 |title=John H.

The World War I period and the 1920s also saw a major expansion in industry. The availability of jobs attracted blacks from the Southern United States.

The ratification of the 18th amendment to the Constitution in 1919 made the production and sale (including exportation) of alcoholic beverages illegal in the United States.

==Geography==

===Cityscape===

====Topography====

Chicago is located in northeastern Illinois on the southwestern shores of Lake Michigan. It is the principal city in Chicago Metropolitan Area situated in the Midwestern United States and the Great Lakes region. Chicago rests on a continental divide at the site of the Chicago Portage, connecting the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes watersheds. The city lies beside huge freshwater Lake Michigan, and two rivers—the Chicago River in downtown and the Calumet River in the industrial far South Side—flow entirely or partially through Chicago.[tpl]sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=5-6[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=6-9[/tpl]
Chicago's history and economy are closely tied to its proximity to Lake Michigan. While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region's waterborne cargo, today's huge lake freighters use the city's Lake Calumet Harbor on the South Side. The lake also provides another positive effect, moderating Chicago's climate; making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer.[tpl]cite web|last=Angel|first=Jim|title=State Climatologist Office for Illinois|url=http://www.isws.illinois.edu/atmos/statecli/general/chicago-climate-narrative.htm|work=Illinois State Water Survey|publisher=Prairie Research Institute|accessdate=August 4, 2013[/tpl]
When Chicago was founded in 1833, most of the early building began around the mouth of the Chicago River, as can be seen on a map of the city's original 58 blocks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/11175.html|title=Thompson's Plat of 1830|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|year=2004|accessdate=July 3, 2011[/tpl] The overall grade of the city's central, built-up areas, is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography, generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise. The average land elevation is [tpl]convert|579|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level. The lowest points are along the lake shore at [tpl]convert|578|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], while the highest point, at [tpl]convert|672|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], is the morainal ridge of Blue Island in the city's far south side.[tpl]cite web|title=Chicago Facts|url=http://www.neiu.edu/~jmhemzac/courses/docs/ofs2005-09%20small2.pdf|work=Northeastern Illinois University|accessdate=August 28, 2013|page=46[/tpl]
The Chicago Loop is the central business district, but Chicago is also a city of neighborhoods. Lake Shore Drive runs adjacent to a large portion of Chicago's lakefront. Some of the parks along the waterfront include Lincoln Park, Grant Park, Burnham Park and Jackson Park. Twenty-four public beaches are also found across [tpl]Convert|26|mi|km|0[/tpl] of the waterfront.[tpl]cite news|last=Fulton|first=Jeff|title=Public Beaches in Chicago|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/public-beaches-chicago-53741.html|work=USA Today|accessdate=August 28, 2013[/tpl] Landfill extends into portions of the lake providing space for Navy Pier, Northerly Island, the Museum Campus, and large portions of the McCormick Place Convention Center. Most of the city's high-rise commercial and residential buildings can be found close to the waterfront.
An informal name for the entire Chicago metropolitan area is "Chicagoland". There is no precise definition for the term "Chicagoland", but it generally means the city and its suburbs combined together. The Chicago Tribune, which coined the term, includes the city of Chicago, the rest of Cook County, eight nearby Illinois counties: Lake, McHenry, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Grundy, Will and Kankakee, and three counties in Indiana: Lake, Porter and LaPorte.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/communities/ |title=Chicago Tribune Classifieds map of Chicagoland |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=May 4, 2009[/tpl] The Illinois Department of Tourism defines Chicagoland as Cook County without the city of Chicago, and only Lake, DuPage, Kane and Will counties.[tpl]cite web|title=Chicagoland Region|url=http://www.enjoyillinois.com/topSpots/region.aspx?area=chicagoland|work=EnjoyIllinois.com|publisher=Illinois Department of Tourism|accessdate=August 14, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928043624/http://www.enjoyillinois.com/topSpots/region.aspx?area=chicagoland|archivedate=September 28, 2011[/tpl] The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce defines it as all of Cook and DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will counties.[tpl]cite web|title=Fast Facts About The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce|url=http://www.chicagolandchamber.org/sub/fast_facts.asp|publisher=Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209003914/http://www.chicagolandchamber.org/sub/fast_facts.asp|archivedate=February 9, 2009|accessdate=January 6, 2014[/tpl]

Major sections of the city include central business district, called The Loop, and the North, the South, and West Sides.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1177.html |title=South Side |publisher=Encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org |date=August 1, 1971 |accessdate=June 10, 2013[/tpl] The three sides of the city are represented on the Flag of Chicago by three horizontal white stripes.[tpl]cite web|title=Municipal Flag of Chicago|url=http://www.chipublib.org/cplbooksmovies/cplarchive/symbols/flag.php|publisher=Chicago Public Library|accessdate=March 22, 2013[/tpl] The North Side is the most densely populated residential section of the city and many high-rises are located on this side of the city along the lakefront.[tpl]cite news|title=Lakeview (Chicago, Illinois)|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/us/illinois/cook-county/chicago/lakeview-(chicago-illinois)-PLGEO100100501254600.topic|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=September 25, 2013[/tpl] The South Side is the largest section of the city, encompassing roughly 60% of the city's land area.

In the late 1920s, sociologists at the University of Chicago subdivided the city into 77 distinct community areas, which can further be subdivided into over 200 informally defined neighborhoods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.streetadvisor.com/chicago-cook-county-illinois/questions/list-of-chicago-neighborhoods |title=List of Chicago Neighborhoods - Chicago |publisher=StreetAdvisor |accessdate=June 10, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Chicago and its Neighborhoods|url=http://www.articlecell.com/Article/Chicago-and-its-Neighborhoods/669201|publisher=articlecell|accessdate=March 22, 2013[/tpl]

====Streetscape====

Chicago's streets were laid out in a street grid that grew from the city's original townsite plat. Streets following the Public Land Survey System section lines later became arterial streets in outlying sections. As new additions to the city were platted, city ordinance required them to be laid out with eight streets to the mile in one direction and sixteen in the other direction. The grid's regularity would provide an efficient means to develop new real estate property. A scattering of diagonal streets, many of them originally native American trails, also cross the city (Elston, Milwaukee, Ogden, Lincoln, etc.). Many additional diagonal streets were recommended in the Plan of Chicago, but only the extension of Ogden Avenue was ever constructed.[tpl]sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=31, 52-53[/tpl]
Most of the city's residential streets tend to have a wide patch of grass and/or trees between the street and the sidewalk itself.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] This has the effect of keeping pedestrians walking on the sidewalk further away from the street traffic. Chicago's Western Avenue is the longest continuous urban street in the world.[tpl]cite book|author1=Rodolphe El-Khoury|author2=Edward Robbins|title=Shaping the City: Studies in History, Theory and Urban Design|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Dbv-zU6M9WIC&pg=PA60|accessdate=May 9, 2013|date=June 19, 2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-26189-0|pages=60–[/tpl] Other famous streets include North Michigan Avenue, North State Street, Clark, and Belmont Avenue. The City Beautiful movement inspired Chicago's boulevards and parkways.

====Architecture====

The destruction caused by the Great Chicago Fire led to the largest building boom in the history of the nation. In 1885, the first steel-framed high-rise building, the Home Insurance Building, rose in the city as Chicago ushered in the skyscraper era,[tpl]sfnp|Lowe|2000|pp=121, 129[/tpl] which would then be followed by many other cities around the world.Chicago (2004)[tpl]dead link|date=November 2010[/tpl].

Large swaths of the city's residential areas away from the lake are characterized by brick bungalows built from the early 20th century through the end of World War II. Chicago is also a prominent center of the Polish Cathedral style of church architecture. The Chicago suburb of Oak Park was home to famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who had designed The Robie House located near the University of Chicago."Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House," Hoffman, Donald, Dover Publications, Inc., 1984, p. 19–25.

==Demographics==

During its first 100 years, Chicago was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. When founded in 1833, fewer than 200 people had settled on what was then the American frontier. By the time of its first census, seven years later, the population had reached over 4,000. Within the span of forty years, the city's population grew from slightly under 30,000 in 1850 to over 1 million by 1890. By the close of the 19th century, Chicago was the fifth largest city in the world,[tpl]cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201f.htm |title=Top 10 Cities of the Year 1900 |publisher=Geography.about.com |accessdate=May 4, 2009[/tpl] and the largest of the cities that did not exist at the dawn of the century. Within sixty years of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the population went from about 300,000 to over 3 million, and reached its highest ever-recorded population of 3.6 million for the 1950 census.
From the last two decades of the 19th century, Chicago was the destination of waves of immigrants from Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, including (but by no means limited to) Italians, Jews, Poles, Bosnians and Czechs.Lizabeth Cohen, Making a New Deal: Industrial Workers in Chicago, 1919–1939. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1990; pp. 33–34. To these ethnic groups, the basis of the city's industrial working class, was added an additional influx of African-Americans from the American South — with Chicago's black population doubling between 1910 and 1920 and doubling again between 1920 and 1930.
The great majority of American blacks moving to Chicago in these years were clustered in a so‑called "Black Belt" on the city's South Side. By 1930, two-thirds of Chicago's African-American population lived in sections of the city which were 90% black in racial composition. Chicago's South Side emerged as America's second largest urban black concentration, following New York's Harlem.
As of the 2010 census,American Community Survey: Chicago city. Retrieved March 6, 2011. there were 2,695,598 people with 1,045,560 households living in Chicago. More than half the population of the state of Illinois lives in the Chicago metropolitan area. Chicago is one of the United States' most densely populated major cities, and the largest city in the Great Lakes Megalopolis. The racial composition of the city was:
Chicago has a Hispanic or Latino population of 28.9%. (Its members may belong to any race; 21.4% Mexican, 3.8% Puerto Rican, 0.7% Guatemalan, 0.6% Ecuadorian, 0.3% Cuban, 0.3% Colombian, 0.2% Honduran, 0.2% Salvadoran, 0.2% Peruvian)Factfinder2census.gov The Guatemalan, Colombian and Peruvian communities have skyrocketed in the 2000s, and some estimates give higher percentages.
According to the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey data for 2011, the median income for a household in the city was $43,628, and the median income for a family was $49,442. Male full-time workers had a median income of $44,647 versus $41,168 for females.

===Religion===

Christianity is predominant among the city's population who worship. The Chicago metropolitan area also includes adherents of Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, and the Bahá'í, among others.
The wealth of Chicago's religious heritage is evident in its many noted examples of sacred architecture and institutions. Many of these religious edifices are Christian in origin, with Roman Catholic structures particularly prevalent. However, the city of Polish Cathedrals is rife with numerous historic synagogues, as well as the noteworthy sacred spaces of other religions. The Kehilath Anshe Ma'ariv Synagogue, now the Pilgrim Baptist Church was designed by Adler & Sullivan in 1890. Chicago's northern suburb of Wilmette, Illinois, has the Bahá'í Temple, the only temple for the Bahá'í Faith in North America.

===Literature===

Chicago literature finds its roots in the city's tradition of lucid, direct journalism, lending to a strong tradition of social realism. In the Encyclopedia of Chicago, Northwestern University Professor Bill Savage describes Chicago fiction as prose which tries to "capture the essence of the city, its spaces and its people." The challenge for early writers was that Chicago was a frontier outpost that transformed into a global metropolis in the span of two generations. Narrative fiction of that time, much of it in the style of "high-flown romance" and "genteel realism", needed a new approach to describe the urban social, political, and economic conditions of Chicago.Encyclopedia of Chicago, "Fiction." Nonetheless, Chicagoans worked hard to create a literary tradition that would stand the test of time,Encyclopedia of Chicago, "Literary Cultures." and create a "city of feeling" out of concrete, steel, vast lake, and open prairie.Encyclopedia of Chicago, "Literary Images of Chicago" Much notable Chicago fiction focuses on the city itself, with social criticism keeping exultation in check.
At least, three short periods in the history of Chicago have had a lasting influence on American Literature.Encyclopedia of Chicago History, "Chicago Literary Renaissance." These include from the time of the Great Chicago Fire to about 1900, what became known as the Chicago Literary Renaissance in the 1910s and early 1920s, and the period of the Great Depression through the 1940s.
What would become the influential Poetry Magazine was founded in 1912 by Harriet Monroe, who was working as an art critic for the Chicago Tribune. The magazine discovered such poets as Gwendolyn Brooks, James Merrill, and John Ashbery.Goodyear, Dana, "The Moneyed Muse: What can two hundred million dollars do for poetry?", article, The New Yorker, February 19 and 26 double issue, 2007 T. S. Eliot's first professionally published poem, "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock", was first published by Poetry. Contributors have included Ezra Pound, William Butler Yeats, William Carlos Williams, Langston Hughes, and Carl Sandburg, among others. The magazine was instrumental in launching the Imagist and Objectivist poetic movements.

==Sports==

Chicago was named the "Best Sports City" in the United States by the Sporting News in 1993, 2006, and 2010. The city is home to two Major League Baseball (MLB) teams: the Chicago Cubs of the National League (NL), who play in Wrigley Field on the North Side; and the Chicago White Sox of the American League (AL), who play in U.S. Cellular Field on the South Side. Chicago is the only city that has had more than one MLB franchise every year since the AL began in 1901.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
The Chicago Bears, one of the last two remaining charter members of the National Football League (NFL), has won nine NFL Championships, including Super Bowl XX. The other remaining charter franchise, the Chicago Cardinals, also started out in the city, but is now known as the Arizona Cardinals. The Bears play their home games at Soldier Field, named after "The men and women of the armed forces". It is located next to the shores of Lake Michigan, on Lake Shore Drive. Soldier Field was an aging stadium and was in dire need of renovation by the end of the 20th century.

==Parks==

When Chicago was incorporated in 1837, it chose the motto Urbs in Horto, a Latin phrase which translates into English as "City in a Garden". Today, the Chicago Park District consists of 552 parks with over [tpl]convert|7300|acre[/tpl] of municipal parkland. There are 33 sand Chicago beaches, a plethora of museums, two world-class conservatories, 16 historic lagoons, and 10 bird and wildlife gardens.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/docs/7fb8e301-0cdd-431b-9dcb-78b2cd6ac348_document.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - 29430CHIdoc.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] Lincoln Park, the largest of the city's parks, covers [tpl]convert|1200|acre[/tpl] and has over 20 million visitors each year, making it second only to Central Park in New York City in number of visitors.[tpl]cite web|title=City Park Facts |publisher=The Trust for Public Land, Center for City Park Excellence |date=June 2006 |url=http://www.tpl.org/tier3_cd.cfm?content_item_id=20531&folder_id=3208|accessdate=July 19, 2006[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl]

The wealth of greenspace afforded by Chicago's parks is further augmented by the Cook County Forest Preserves, a network of open spaces containing forest, prairie, wetland, streams, and lakes that are set aside as natural areas which lie along the city's periphery,[tpl]cite web|title=Forest Preserve District of Cook County|url=http://library.uic.edu/collections/fpdcc|work=University of Illinois at Chicago|accessdate=August 28, 2013[/tpl] home to both the Chicago Botanic Garden in Glencoe and the Brookfield Zoo in Brookfield, Illinois .[tpl]cite web|title=Affiliates|url=http://fpdcc.com/about/affiliates/|work=Forest Preserve District of Cook County|accessdate=August 28, 2013[/tpl] In addition, Washington Park is one of the cities biggest parks as well; covering nearly as much as [tpl]convert|400|acres|0|abbr=on[/tpl].

==Law and government==

===Government===

The government of the City of Chicago is divided into executive and legislative branches. The Mayor of Chicago is the chief executive, elected by general election for a term of four years, with no term limits. The mayor appoints commissioners and other officials who oversee the various departments. In addition to the mayor, Chicago's two other citywide elected officials are the clerk and the treasurer. The City Council is the legislative branch and is made up of 50 aldermen, one elected from each ward in the city.[tpl]cite web|title=City Council, Your Ward & Alderman|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/about/council.html|work=City of Chicago|accessdate=October 13, 2013[/tpl] The council takes official action through the passage of ordinances and resolutions and approves the city budget.[tpl]cite web|title=Chicago Government|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/chicagogovt.html|work=City of Chicago|accessdate=October 13, 2013[/tpl]
The Chicago Police Department provides law enforcement for the City of Chicago and its residents. The Chicago Fire Department provides fire suppression and emergency medical services for the City of Chicago and its residents. Civil and criminal law cases are heard in the Cook County Circuit Court of the State of Illinois court system, or in the Northern District of Illinois, in the federal system. In the former, the public prosecutor is the Illinois State's Attorney, in the latter, the United States Attorney.

===Politics===

During much of the last half of the 19th century, Chicago's politics were dominated by a growing Democratic Party organization. During the 1880s and 1890s, Chicago had a powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist, anarchist and labor organizations.Schneirov 1998, pp 173–174 For much of the 20th century, Chicago has been among the largest and most reliable Democratic strongholds in the United States; with Chicago's Democratic vote the state of Illinois has been "solid blue" in presidential elections since 1992. Even before then, it was not unheard of for Republican presidential candidates to win handily in downstate Illinois, only to lose statewide due to large Democratic margins in Chicago. The citizens of Chicago have not elected a Republican mayor since 1927, when William Thompson was voted into office. The strength of the party in the city is partly a consequence of Illinois state politics, where the Republicans have come to represent the rural and farm concerns while the Democrats support urban issues such as Chicago's public school funding. Chicago contains less than 25% of the state's population, but 8 of Illinois' 19 U.S. Representatives have part of Chicago in their districts.
Machine politics persisted in Chicago after the decline of similar machines in other large U.S. cities.Montejano 1998, pp 33–34 During much of that time, the city administration found opposition mainly from a liberal "independent" faction of the Democratic Party. The independents finally gained control of city government in 1983 with the election of Harold Washington (in office 1983–1987). From 1989 until May 16, 2011, Chicago was under the leadership of its longest serving mayor, Richard M. Daley, the son of Richard J. Daley. On May 16, 2011, Rahm Emanuel was sworn in as the 55th mayor of Chicago. Because of the dominance of the Democratic Party in Chicago, the Democratic primary vote held in the spring is generally more significant than the general elections in November for U.S. House and Illinois State seats. The aldermanic, mayoral, and other city offices are filled through nonpartisan elections with runoffs as needed.

===Crime===

Chicago had a murder rate of 18.5 per 100,000 residents in 2012, ranking 16th among cities with 100,000 people or more."Fenton, Justin. (2013) Baltimore ranked 6th in murder rate in 2012.

The total number of murders in Chicago peaked in 1974, with 970 murders when the city's population was over 3 million people (resulting in a murder rate of around 29 per 100,000), and came close to peaking again in 1992 with 943 murders, resulting in a murder rate of 34 per 100,000.Heinzmann, David (January 1, 2003). Chicago falls out of 1st in murders. Chicago Tribune, found at qrc.depaul.edu/djabon/Articles/ChicagoCrime20030101.htm. Chicago, along with other major US cities, experienced a significant reduction in violent crime rates through the 1990s, eventually recording 448 homicides in 2004, the lowest total since 1965 (15.65 per 100,000.) Chicago's homicide tally remained steady throughout 2005, 2006, and 2007 with 449, 452, and 435 respectively.

Electricity for most of northern Illinois is provided by Commonwealth Edison, also known as ComEd. Their service territory borders Iroquois County to the south, the Wisconsin border to the north, the Iowa border to the west and the Indiana border to the east.

Because of this, ComEd reports indicate that Chicago receives about 75% of its electricity from nuclear power. Recently, the city started the installation of wind turbines on government buildings with the aim to promote the use of renewable energy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iit.edu/~ipro307f/faq.html |title=IIT.edu |publisher=IIT.edu |date=June 20, 2003 |accessdate=May 4, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080605021018/http://www.iit.edu/~ipro307f/faq.html |archivedate = June 5, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kentlaw.edu/news/advisory/adv030707.html |title=KentLaw.edu |publisher=KentLaw.edu |accessdate=May 4, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=By Martin LaMonica Staff Writer, CNET News |url=http://news.com.com/Micro+wind+turbines+are+coming+to+town/2100-11398_3-6037539.html |title='Micro' wind turbines are coming to town | CNET News.com |publisher=News.com.com |accessdate=May 4, 2009|archiveurl=http://archive.is/dPEO|archivedate=July 14, 2012[/tpl]

==Sister cities==

Chicago has 28 sister cities around the world.[tpl]cite web|title=Chicago Sister Cities|url=http://www.chicagosistercities.com/|year=2009|publisher=Chicago Sister Cities International|accessdate=July 22, 2009[/tpl] Like Chicago, many of them are or were the second most populous city or second most influential city of their country, or they are the main city of a country that has had large amounts of immigrants settle in Chicago. Paris is a Partner City rather than a Sister City, due to the one sister city policy of its respective French commune.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.paris.fr/portail/accueil/Portal.lut?page_id=6587&document_type_id=5&document_id=16467&portlet_id=14974 |title=Le jumelage avec Rome |accessdate=July 9, 2008|publisher=Municipalité de Paris |language=French[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] These relationships have sought to promote economic, cultural, and political ties.[tpl]cite news | title=Chicago has assembled a sorority of sister cities |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-07-31/features/0107310017_1_sister-cities-mayor-richard-j-daley-multinational-city | work=Chicago Tribune | date=July 31, 2001 | accessdate=June 22, 2013 | author=Leroux, Charles[/tpl]
To celebrate the sister cities, Chicago hosts a yearly festival in Daley Plaza, which features cultural acts and food tastings from the other cities. In addition, the Chicago Sister Cities program hosts a number of delegation and formal exchanges. In some cases, these exchanges have led to further informal collaborations, such as the academic relationship between the Buehler Center on Aging, Health & Society at the Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University and the Institute of Gerontology of Ukraine (originally of the Soviet Union), that was originally established as part of the Chicago-Kiev sister cities program.[tpl]cite web|first=Celia|last=Berdes, PhD|author2=Levin, Andrew|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/aging/pdf/Annual2008.pdf|work=Annual Report 2008|pages=5–7|publisher=Buehler Center on Aging, Health & Society|title=Director Emeritus James Webster Looks Backward, Forward|accessdate=July 1, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
