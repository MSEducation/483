==Taxonomic Issue==

Oliotius oligolepis (Bleeker, 1853), a species of barb from Southeast Asia has at times been placed in the genus Barbus which would render the current species invalid as a junior homynym.  However, since Bleeker's oligolepis species, originally in Capoeta, is currently placed in the genus Oliotius and before that in Puntius, Battalgil's oligolepis species is available and valid.Barbus tauricus oligolepis, Catalog of Fishes, California Academy of Sciences
