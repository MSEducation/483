==Premise and characters==

The two main characters of the series are animated testicles named Baxter and McGuire. Baxter (Bakay) is always depicted wearing a purple hat and smoking a cigar. Baxter is the more mature of the two, having experience being the lower testicle. McGuire (Gould) acts more childish and anxious. He often panics when "go time" is about to happen. The two appear to "work" for the penis, as shown in "The Boss".

==Episodes==

Eight cartoon shorts were produced. All eight are available on Comedy Central's web site.
