==History==

FM 2252 was designated in 1954, with a northern terminus at the Comal County line. It was extended to its current length in 1973, through Comal County to and along FM 1337, with a spur route into Bracken. The spur route was removed in 1976. In 1995, the portion between IH 410 and FM 3009 was officially changed to Urban Road 2252 (UR 2252); however, as with other urban roads, TxDOT continues to sign the route with the farm-to-market route marker.[tpl]TxDOT|UR|2252[/tpl]
