In cryptography, SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function designed by the United States National Security Agency and is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard published by the United States NIST.http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-4/fips-180-4.pdf
SHA-1 produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value. A SHA-1 hash value is typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long.
SHA stands for "secure hash algorithm". The four SHA algorithms are structured differently and are named SHA-0, SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3. SHA-0 is the original version of the 160-bit hash function published in 1993 under the name "SHA": it was not adopted by many applications. Published in 1995, SHA-1 is very similar to SHA-0, but alters the original SHA hash specification to correct alleged weaknesses. SHA-2, published in 2001, is significantly different from the SHA-1 hash function.
SHA-1 is the most widely used of the existing SHA hash functions, and is employed in several widely used applications and protocols.
In 2005, cryptanalysts found attacks on SHA-1 suggesting that the algorithm might not be secure enough for ongoing use.Schneier on Security: Cryptanalysis of SHA-1 NIST required many applications in federal agencies to move to SHA-2 after 2010 because of the weakness.http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/secure_hashing.html Although no successful attacks have yet been reported on SHA-2, it is algorithmically similar to SHA-1. In 2012, following a long-running competition, NIST selected an additional algorithm, Keccak, for standardization under SHA-3.Schneier on Security: NIST Hash Workshop Liveblogging (5)Hash cracked â€“ heise Security In 2013 Microsoft announced their deprecation policy on SHA-1 according to which Windows will stop accepting SHA-1 certificates in SSL by 2017.[tpl]cite web | url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/pki/archive/2013/11/12/sha1-deprecation-policy.aspx | title=SHA1 Deprecation Policy | publisher=Microsoft | date=2013-11-12 | accessdate=2013-11-14[/tpl]
