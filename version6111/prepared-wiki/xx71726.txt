Analogously, the term "designate" (e.g. Prime Minister-designate) is used in systems without direct elections of executive politicians, such as in parliamentary systems.

==Title==

In the United States, a person elected to office at the state or federal levels, and sometimes by custom at local levels, is given the courtesy style of the Honorable (abbreviated to Hon. or Hon'ble).

==In clubs and other related associations==

The bylaws of some clubs and other organizations define a position of President-Elect as an alternative to a Vice President position.  The members of the organization elect the President-Elect, rather than directly electing the organization's President.  The President-Elect may be given limited duties, similar to a Vice-President.  At the end of the term, the President-Elect is promoted to the position of President, and a new President-Elect is elected.  (Some organizations extend this schema with a position of Past President.)  The advantage of this schema is a clear continuity of succession, as well as the opportunity to familiarize the President-Elect with the operations of the organization before becoming President.
