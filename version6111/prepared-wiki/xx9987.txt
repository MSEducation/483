Despite leveling after 1900, especially in matters of vocabulary and phonetics, a number of dialects still exist in Russia. Some linguists divide the dialects of Russian into two primary regional groupings, "Northern" and "Southern", with Moscow lying on the zone of transition between the two. Others divide the language into three groupings, Northern, Central (or Middle) and Southern, with Moscow lying in the Central region.David Dalby. 1999-2000. The Linguasphere Register of the World's Languages and Speech Communities. Linguasphere Press.  Pg. 442.[tpl]sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526[/tpl] All dialects also divided in two main chronological categories: the dialects of primary formation (the territory of the Eastern Rus' or Muscovy, roughly consists of the modern Central and Northwestern Federal districts); and secondary formation (other territory). Dialectology within Russia recognizes dozens of smaller-scale variants. The dialects often show distinct and non-standard features of pronunciation and intonation, vocabulary and grammar. Some of these are relics of ancient usage now completely discarded by the standard language.
The Northern Russian dialects and those spoken along the Volga River typically pronounce unstressed [tpl]IPA|/o/[/tpl] clearly (the phenomenon called okanye/оканье).[tpl]sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526[/tpl] Besides the absence of vowel reduction some dialects have high or diphthongal [tpl]IPA|/e~i̯ɛ/[/tpl] in the place of [tpl]proto|slavic|ě[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/o~u̯ɔ/[/tpl] in stressed closed syllables (like in Ukrainian) instead of Standard Russian [tpl]IPA|/e/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/o/[/tpl].[tpl]sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526[/tpl] In morphology it has an interesting feature as a post-posed definite article -to, -ta, -te similarly existing in Bulgarian and Macedonian.[tpl]sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526[/tpl]
In the Southern Russian dialects unstressed [tpl]IPA|/e/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/a/[/tpl] following palatalized consonants and preceding a stressed syllable are not reduced to [tpl]IPA|ɪ[/tpl] (like in the Moscow dialect), being instead pronounced [tpl]IPA|/a/[/tpl] in such positions (e.g. несли is pronounced [tpl]IPA|nʲasˈlʲi[/tpl], not [tpl]IPA|nʲɪsˈlʲi[/tpl]) – this is called yakanye/яканье.[tpl]sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Language of the Russian Village|language=Russian|url=http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map13.html|accessdate=2011-11-10[/tpl]
Consonants include a fricative [tpl]IPA|/ɣ/[/tpl], a semivowel [tpl]IPA|/w~u̯/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/x~xv~xw/[/tpl], whereas the Standard and Northern dialects have the consonants [tpl]IPA|/ɡ/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/v/[/tpl], final [tpl]IPA|/l/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/f/[/tpl], respectively.[tpl]sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526[/tpl]
In morphology it has a palatalized final [tpl]IPA|/tʲ/[/tpl] in 3rd person forms of verbs (this is unpalatalized in the Standard and Northern dialects).[tpl]sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Language of the Russian Village|language=Russian|url=http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map14.html|accessdate=2011-11-10[/tpl] Some of these features such as akanye/yakanye, a debuccalized or lenited [tpl]IPA|/ɡ/[/tpl], a semivowel [tpl]IPA|/w~u̯/[/tpl] and palatalized final [tpl]IPA|/tʲ/[/tpl] in 3rd person forms of verbs are also present in modern Belarusian and some dialects of Ukrainian (Eastern Polesian), indicating a linguistic continuum.
The city of Veliky Novgorod has historically displayed a feature called chokanye/tsokanye (чоканье/цоканье), where [tpl]IPA|/tɕ/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ts/[/tpl] were confused. So, цапля ("heron") has been recorded as 'чапля'. Also, the second palatalization of velars did not occur there, so the so-called ě² (from the Proto-Slavic diphthong *ai) did not cause [tpl]IPA|/k, ɡ, x/[/tpl] to shift to [tpl]IPA|/ts, dz, s/[/tpl]; therefore where Standard Russian has цепь ("chain"), the form кепь [tpl]IPA|kʲepʲ[/tpl] is attested in earlier texts.
Among the first to study Russian dialects was Lomonosov in the 18th century. In the 19th, Vladimir Dal compiled the first dictionary that included dialectal vocabulary. Detailed mapping of Russian dialects began at the turn of the 20th century. In modern times, the monumental Dialectological Atlas of the Russian Language (Диалектологический атлас русского языка [tpl]IPA-ru|dʲɪɐˌlʲɛktəlɐˈɡʲitɕɪskʲɪj ˈatləs ˈruskəvə jɪzɨˈka|[/tpl]), was published in three folio volumes 1986–1989, after four decades of preparatory work.

===Derived languages===

==Alphabet==

Russian is written using a Cyrillic alphabet. The Russian alphabet consists of 33 letters. The following table gives their upper case forms, along with IPA values for each letter's typical sound:
Older letters of the Russian alphabet include [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|ѣ[/tpl][/tpl], which merged to [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|е[/tpl][/tpl] ([tpl]IPA|/je/[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|/ʲe/[/tpl]); [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|і[/tpl][/tpl] and [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|ѵ[/tpl][/tpl], which both merged to [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|и[/tpl][/tpl] ([tpl]IPA|/i/[/tpl]); [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|ѳ[/tpl][/tpl], which merged to [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|ф[/tpl][/tpl] ([tpl]IPA|/f/[/tpl]); [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|ѫ[/tpl][/tpl], which merged to [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|у[/tpl][/tpl] ([tpl]IPA|/u/[/tpl]); [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|ѭ[/tpl][/tpl], which merged to [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|ю[/tpl][/tpl] ([tpl]IPA|/ju/[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|/ʲu/[/tpl]); and [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|ѧ[/tpl]/[tpl]angle bracket|ѩ[/tpl][/tpl], which later were graphically reshaped into [tpl]angle bracket|я[/tpl] and merged phonetically to [tpl]IPA|/ja/[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|/ʲa/[/tpl]. While these older letters have been abandoned at one time or another, they may be used in this and related articles. The yers [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|ъ[/tpl][/tpl] and [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|ь[/tpl][/tpl] originally indicated the pronunciation of ultra-short or reduced [tpl]IPA|/ŭ/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/ĭ/[/tpl].

===Transliteration===

Because of many technical restrictions in computing and also because of the unavailability of Cyrillic keyboards abroad, Russian is often transliterated using the Latin alphabet. For example, мороз ("frost") is transliterated moroz, and  мышь ("mouse"), mysh or myš'. Once commonly used by the majority of those living outside Russia, transliteration is being used less frequently by Russian speaking typists in favor of the extension of Unicode character encoding, which fully incorporates the Russian alphabet.  Free programs leveraging this Unicode extension are available which allow users to type Russian characters, even on western 'QWERTY' keyboards.[tpl]cite web |last=Caloni |first=Wanderley |title=RusKey: mapping the Russian keyboard layout into the Latin alphabets |url=http://www.codeproject.com/KB/winsdk/ruskey.aspx |date=2007-02-15 |accessdate=2011-01-28 |publisher=The Code Project[/tpl]

===Computing===

The Russian alphabet has many systems of character encoding. KOI8-R was designed by the Soviet government and was intended to serve as the standard encoding. This encoding was and still is widely used in UNIX-like operating systems. Nevertheless, the spread of MS-DOS and OS/2 (IBM866), traditional Macintosh (ISO/IEC 8859-5) and Microsoft Windows (CP1251) created chaos and ended by establishing different encodings as de facto standards, with Windows-1251 becoming a de facto standard in Russian Internet and e-mail communication during the period of roughly 1995-2005.
But nowadays all the obsolete 8-bit encodings are rarely used in the communication protocols and text exchange data formats, being mostly replaced with UTF-8. A number of encoding conversion applications were developed. "iconv" is an example that is supported by most versions of Linux, Macintosh and some other operating systems; but you rarely still need those converters, unless accessing texts created more than a few years ago.
In addition to the modern Russian alphabet, Unicode (and thus UTF-8) encodes the Early Cyrillic alphabet (which is very similar to the Greek alphabet), as well as all other Slavic and non-Slavic but Cyrillic-based alphabets.

===Orthography===

Russian spelling is reasonably phonemic in practice. It is in fact a balance among phonemics, morphology, etymology, and grammar; and, like that of most living languages, has its share of inconsistencies and controversial points. A number of rigid spelling rules introduced between the 1880s and 1910s have been responsible for the former whilst trying to eliminate the latter.
The current spelling follows the major reform of 1918, and the final codification of 1956. An update proposed in the late 1990s has met a hostile reception, and has not been formally adopted. The punctuation, originally based on Byzantine Greek, was in the 17th and 18th centuries reformulated on the French and German models.
According to the Institute of Russian Language of the Russian Academy of Sciences, an optional acute accent ([tpl]lang|ru|знак ударения[/tpl]) may, and sometimes should, be used to mark stress. For example, it is used to distinguish between otherwise identical words, especially when context does not make it obvious: замо́к/за́мок (lock/castle), сто́ящий/стоя́щий (worthwhile/standing), чудно́/чу́дно (this is odd/this is marvelous), молоде́ц/мо́лодец (attaboy/fine young man), узна́ю/узнаю́ (I shall learn it/I recognize it), отреза́ть/отре́зать (to be cutting/to have cut); to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words, especially personal and family names (афе́ра, гу́ру, Гарси́я, Оле́ша, Фе́рми), and to show which is the stressed word in a sentence (Ты́ съел печенье?/Ты съе́л печенье?/Ты съел пече́нье? – Was it you who ate the cookie?/Did you eat the cookie?/Was it the cookie that you ate?). Stress marks are mandatory in lexical dictionaries and books for children or Russian learners.

==Phonology==

The phonological system of Russian is inherited from Common Slavonic, but underwent considerable modification in the early historical period, before being largely settled around the year 1400.
The language possesses five vowels (or six, under the St. Petersburg Phonological School), which are written with different letters depending on whether or not the preceding consonant is palatalized. The consonants typically come in plain vs. palatalized pairs, which are traditionally called hard and soft. (The hard consonants are often velarized, especially before back vowels, as in Irish, although in some dialects the velarization is limited to hard [tpl]IPA|/l/[/tpl]). The standard language, based on the Moscow dialect, possesses heavy stress and moderate variation in pitch. Stressed vowels are somewhat lengthened, while unstressed vowels tend to be reduced to near-close vowels or an unclear schwa. (See also: vowel reduction in Russian.)
The Russian syllable structure can be quite complex with both initial and final consonant clusters of up to 4 consecutive sounds. Using a formula with V standing for the nucleus (vowel) and C for each consonant the structure can be described as follows:
(C)(C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C)
Clusters of four consonants are not very common, however, especially within a morpheme. Examples: взгляд (/vzɡlʲat/, "glance"), строительств (/strɐˈitʲɪlʲstf/, "of constructions").

===Consonants===

Russian is notable for its distinction based on palatalization of most of the consonants. While [tpl]IPA|/k/, /ɡ/, /x/[/tpl] do have palatalized allophones [tpl]IPA|ɡʲ, xʲ[/tpl], only [tpl]IPA|/kʲ/[/tpl] might be considered a phoneme, though it is marginal and generally not considered distinctive (the only native minimal pair which argues for [tpl]IPA|/kʲ/[/tpl] to be a separate phoneme is "это ткёт" ([tpl]IPA|/ˈɛtə tkʲot/[/tpl], "it weaves")/"этот кот" ([tpl]IPA|/ˈɛtət kot/[/tpl], "this cat")). Palatalization means that the center of the tongue is raised during and after the articulation of the consonant. In the case of [tpl]IPA|/tʲ/ and /dʲ/[/tpl], the tongue is raised enough to produce slight frication (affricate sounds). These sounds: [tpl]IPA|/t, d, ts, s, z, n and rʲ/[/tpl] are dental, that is pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the teeth rather than against the alveolar ridge.

==Grammar==

Russian has preserved an Indo-European synthetic-inflectional structure, although considerable levelling has taken place.
Russian grammar encompasses
The spoken language has been influenced by the literary one, but continues to preserve characteristic forms. The dialects show various non-standard grammatical features, [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl] some of which are archaisms or descendants of old forms since discarded by the literary language.

==Vocabulary==

===Number of words in Russian===

See History of the Russian language for an account of the successive foreign influences on Russian.
The total number of words in Russian is difficult to ascertain because of the ability to agglutinate and create manifold compounds, diminutives, etc. (see Word Formation under Russian grammar). The number of listed words or entries in some of the major dictionaries published during the last two centuries, and the total vocabulary of Alexander Pushkin (who is credited with greatly augmenting and codifying literary Russian), are as follows:What types of dictionaries exist? from www.gramota.ru [tpl]ref-ru[/tpl]A catalogue of Russian explanatory dictionaries [tpl]ref-ru[/tpl]
Note: The above numbers do not properly show the real quantity of words in Russian, as Russian dictionaries do not have a goal to collect all words of the language, but to establish normalized vocabulary of standard neutral style. They do not contain special technical and scientific terms, many lexical derivatives, colloquial and dialectical words, and slang.

===Proverbs and sayings===

The Russian language is replete with many hundreds of proverbs (пословица [tpl]IPA|pɐˈslovʲɪtsə[/tpl]) and sayings (поговоркa [tpl]IPA|pəɡɐˈvorkə[/tpl]). These were already tabulated by the 17th century and collected and studied in the 19th and 20th, with folk tales being especially fertile sources.

==History and examples==

The history of Russian language may be divided into the following periods.
Judging by the historical records, by approximately 1000 AD the predominant ethnic group over much of modern European Russia, Ukraine and Belarus was the Eastern branch of the Slavs, speaking a closely related group of dialects. The political unification of this region into Kievan Rus' in about 880, from which modern Russia, Ukraine and Belarus trace their origins, established Old East Slavic as a literary and commercial language. It was soon followed by the adoption of Christianity in 988 and the introduction of the South Slavic Old Church Slavonic as the liturgical and official language. Borrowings and calques from Byzantine Greek began to enter the Old East Slavic and spoken dialects at this time, which in their turn modified the Old Church Slavonic as well.
Dialectal differentiation accelerated after the breakup of Kievan Rus' in approximately 1100. On the territories of modern Belarus and Ukraine emerged Ruthenian and in modern Russia medieval Russian. They definitely became distinct since the 13th century, i.e. following the division of that land between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Poland and Hungary in the west and independent Novgorod and Pskov feudal republics plus numerous small duchies (which came to be vassals of the Tatars) in the east.
The official language in Moscow and Novgorod, and later, in the growing Muscovy, was Church Slavonic, which evolved from Old Church Slavonic and remained the literary language for centuries, until the Petrine age, when its usage became limited to biblical and liturgical texts. Russian developed under a strong influence of Church Slavonic until the close of the 17th century; afterwards the influence reversed, leading to corruption of liturgical texts.
The political reforms of Peter the Great (Пётр Вели́кий, Pyótr Velíkiy) were accompanied by a reform of the alphabet, and achieved their goal of secularization and Westernization. Blocks of specialized vocabulary were adopted from the languages of Western Europe. By 1800, a significant portion of the gentry spoke French daily, and German sometimes. Many Russian novels of the 19th century, e.g. Leo Tolstoy's (Лев Толсто́й) War and Peace, contain entire paragraphs and even pages in French with no translation given, with an assumption that educated readers would not need one.
The modern literary language is usually considered to date from the time of Alexander Pushkin (Алекса́ндр Пу́шкин) in the first third of the 19th century. Pushkin revolutionized Russian literature by rejecting archaic grammar and vocabulary (so-called "высо́кий стиль" — "high style") in favor of grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time. Even modern readers of younger age may only experience slight difficulties understanding some words in Pushkin's texts, since relatively few words used by Pushkin have become archaic or changed meaning. In fact, many expressions used by Russian writers of the early 19th century, in particular Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov (Михаи́л Ле́рмонтов), Nikolai Gogol (Никола́й Го́голь), Aleksander Griboyedov (Алекса́ндр Грибое́дов), became proverbs or sayings which can be frequently found even in modern Russian colloquial speech.
Зи́мний ве́чер [tpl]IPA-ru|ˈzʲimnʲɪj ˈvʲetɕɪr|IPA[/tpl]
Бу́ря мгло́ю не́бо кро́ет, [tpl]IPA|ˈmɡloju ˈnʲɛbə ˈkroɪt[/tpl]
Ви́хри сне́жные крутя́; [tpl]IPA|ˈsʲnʲɛʐnɨɪ kruˈtʲa[/tpl]
То, как зверь, она́ заво́ет, [tpl]IPA|kaɡ zvʲerʲ ɐˈna zɐˈvoɪt[/tpl]
То запла́чет, как дитя́, [tpl]IPA|zɐˈplatɕɪt, kaɡ dʲɪˈtʲa[/tpl]
То по кро́вле обветша́лой [tpl]IPA|pɐˈkrovlʲɪ ɐbvʲɪˈtʂaləj[/tpl]
Вдруг соло́мой зашуми́т, [tpl]IPA|sɐˈloməj zəʂuˈmʲit[/tpl]
То, как пу́тник запозда́лый, [tpl]IPA|kak ˈputnʲɪɡ zəpɐˈzdalɨj[/tpl]
К нам в око́шко застучи́т. [tpl]IPA|vɐˈkoʂkə zəstuˈtɕit[/tpl]
The political upheavals of the early 20th century and the wholesale changes of political ideology gave written Russian its modern appearance after the spelling reform of 1918. Political circumstances and Soviet accomplishments in military, scientific and technological matters (especially cosmonautics), gave Russian a worldwide prestige, especially during the mid-20th century.
