==Plot==

In the film's backstory, human civilizations built flying cities, which were later destroyed by an unspecified catastrophe, forcing the survivors to live on the ground while the sole exception Laputa remains in the sky, concealed within a powerful thunderstorm. In the story's opening, an airship carrying a young girl, Sheeta and her abductor, a secret agent working for the government named Muska is attacked by the air-pirate Dola and her sons in search of Sheeta's crystal amulet.  In the resulting struggle, Sheeta falls from the airship, slowed by the amulet mid-fall. Floating safely down to a small working mining town, she is discovered by a youth named Pazu, and he takes her to his home to recover. On waking, Sheeta is surprised to find that Pazu is building a small aeroplane, with the intention of finding the lost city of Laputa, as his father had taken a photograph of it while flying. Sheeta is taken aback to see a representation of the photo on Pazu's wall. She tells him that her family lived in a small valley to the north named Gondoa, and that she had lived alone once her grandmother had died, until being abducted by Muska and his agents.  The next day they are pursued by Dola's pirates, and later by Muska's soldiers.  Eventually, the two fall into a nearly-exhausted mine, where they encounter the local eccentric 'Uncle Pomme', who informs them that Sheeta's amulet is one of the 'volucite' crystals ('Aetherium' in the American release) formerly used to keep Laputa aloft.

Upon leaving the mines, Sheeta reveals her full name of 'Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa'; whereupon they are captured by Muska and are taken to the fortress of Tedis. Later, Muska shows Sheeta a dormant Laputan robot and reveals his knowledge of her secret name, which he interprets as that of a Laputan royal line, and threatens to have the military execute Pazu, whom she therefore orders home. Pazu returns to his own house, only to be dragged forcibly inside the house by Dola's sons, beaten and tied up to a ladder. After being questioned harshly and rudely, Dola explains to Pazu that Sheeta was forced to tell him this in an effort to protect him. She also explains that once Muska has what he wants from her, he will most likely kill her. Upon hearing that airship Goliath will be taking off with Sheeta to find Laputa, Dola and her sons get ready to intercept and capture the crystal. Pazu asks Dola to join her pirates to save her. At first, Dola refuses, but, after a moment of thought, reluctantly accepts, cuts Pazu loose and immediately leave to the fortress of Tedis. Sheeta, retained by Muska, recites an apotropaic verse and unexpectedly activates the robot, who destroys Muska's fortress to find her, while Pazu and Dola's pirates embark in winged 'flaptors' to rescue her themselves. Meanwhile the robot seizes Sheeta; but when struck by Muska's artillery, retaliates against the fortress, until Sheeta orders it to desist, losing her amulet in the meantime. The robot is then overcome by Goliath, and Pazu rescues Sheeta, while Muska obtains the amulet.
The pirates, accompanied by Pazu and Sheeta, return to their airship Tiger Moth, where Dola assigns Sheeta to the galley and Pazu to assist her engineer, and in which they pursue the direction identified by Sheeta's amulet as that of Laputa, while Muska follows the same direction in the Goliath. Both airships arrive at Laputa on the following day, where the two children, separated from Dola's pirates, discover a city devoid of human life, but possessed of a parklike woodland with a gigantic central tree "The eternal tree of life"  maintained by a robot resembling that of the fortress, while Muska's soldiers plunder the city's treasures, holding Dola's pirates captive, with the intention of of having them lynched. The ancient city is revealed to be twofold; a crumbling, overgrown yet beautiful ruin of a castle above, and a perfectly preserved scientific marvel below, utilizing the ultimate evolution of the crystal levitation technology displayed by Sheeta's amulet, as well as holography, magnetic cohesion, pseudo-nuclear weaponry and a veritable army of the semi-sentient robots.   Upon gaining entrance to the city's central sphere, Muska captures Sheeta and his agents open fire upon Pazu, receiving a scratch to his left cheek; whereupon Pazu frees Dola's pirates and pursues Muska.
In the center of Laputa, containing the immense 'volucite' crystal keeping the city aloft, Muska (whose end game is revealed) identifies himself as one of the "Romuska Palo Ul Laputa", another royal line, and uses Sheeta's "key" crystal to access the advanced Laputian technology and destroy the soldiers accompanying him along with the airship "Goliath"; whereupon Sheeta seizes her crystal amulet and flees, prompting him to pursue her. Encountering Pazu through a gap in an internal wall, Sheeta gives him her amulet, and is herself later cornered by Muska in Laputa's abandoned throne room. Arguing with Muska, Sheeta realizes and explains that the people of Laputa left the castle because it had no life. Muska refuses to believe her and shoots off her two pig tails, threatening to shoot her ears as well unless the crystal amulet is given to him. Pazu then enters and says he'll give the crystal amulet to Muska if Pazu can talk to Sheeta; Muska gives Pazu one minute to negotiate with her. Sheeta and Pazu then recite a "Spell of Destruction', blinding Muska and destroying much of the city. Having escaped the collapse, Pazu and Sheeta re-unite with Dola and her pirates (who have had the presence of mind to swipe some of the city's treasures before fleeing), and later part from them to fly to Gondoa as Pazu had promised; whereupon the ending credits show the remains of Laputa still aloft, with the guardian robot still tending the garden, maintained by the volucite crystal embedded in the roots of the central tree, in high orbit above the earth.

==Influences==

The name 'Laputa' is derived from Jonathan Swift's novel Gulliver's Travels, wherein Swift's Laputa is also a flying island controlled by its citizens. Anthony Lioi feels that Miyazaki's Laputa: Castle in the Sky is similar to Swift's Laputa, where the technological superiority of the castle in the sky is used for political ends.The City Ascends: Laputa: Castle in the Sky as Critical Ecotopia
Laputa is credited by Colonel Muska with having informed Biblical and Hindu legends — thus tying the world of Laputa to our Earth (and to western European civilization) — as do the medieval castle architecture on the ground; the Gothic and half-timbered buildings in the village near the fort; the Welsh mining-town architecture, clothing, and ground vehicles of Pazu's homeland; and the Victorian ambiance of the pirate ship. The anime also makes references to the Hindu epic Ramayana, including "Indra's arrow", while the name Sheeta may be a reference to Sita, the female lead in the Ramayana.Ryoko Toyama, Laputa: The Castle in the Sky FAQ, Nausicaa.net
Some of the architecture seen in the film was inspired by a Welsh mining town. Miyazaki first visited Wales in 1984 and witnessed the miners' strike firsthand. He returned to the country in 1986 to prepare for Laputa, which he said reflected his Welsh experience: "I was in Wales just after the miners' strike. I really admired the way the miners' unions fought to the very end for their jobs and communities, and I wanted to reflect the strength of those communities in my film."[tpl]cite web|last=Gordon |first=David |title=Studio Ghibli: Animated Magic |publisher=Hackwriters.com |date = May 2006|url=http://www.hackwriters.com/anime2.htm |accessdate=2008-12-30[/tpl] Miyazaki told The Guardian, "I admired those men, I admired the way they battled to save their way of life, just as the coal miners in Japan did. Many people of my generation see the miners as a symbol; a dying breed of fighting men.

==Distribution and reception==

The film was a popular hit in Japan when released in 1986 like all Ghibli movies. In the late 1980s, an English version of Laputa was briefly shown in the US by Streamline Pictures. This dub, produced for showing on international flights to Japan, was not produced by Streamline. According to Fred Patten of the company, "Streamline Pictures theatrically distributed an English-dubbed print of Laputa from March 24, 1989 for the next year, but Streamline never dubbed it. Streamline licensed Laputa from Tokuma Shoten in late 1988 or early 1989, and was sent a print from Japan that had already been dubbed into English for use as an in-flight film by Japan Air Lines on its trans-Pacific flights. We have no idea who actually dubbed it."[tpl]cite web|title=Tenkuu no Shiro Rapyuta FAQ |publisher=The Hayao Miyazaki Web |url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/laputa/faq.html |accessdate=2008-12-30[/tpl] Reportedly, Carl Macek was disappointed with this early dub,[tpl]cite web|last=Macek|first=Carl|title=ANN Cast Episode 23|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/anncast/2014-01-09|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=11 January 2014|time=48:49|quote=We didn't dub it. Streamline didn't dub it. And I told the people at Tokuma Shoten that I thought the dubbing was marginal on Laputa and I thought that it could be a better product if they had a better dubbing... To me, there's a certain element of class that you can bring to a project. Laputa is a very classy film, so it required a classy dub and the dub given to that particular film was adequate but clumsy. I didn't like it all... It's not something that I appreciated intellectually as well as aesthetically.[/tpl] which is available only on the Japanese DVD release. Following this, Tokuma Shoten allowed Streamline to dub their future acquisitions such as My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service.
The Disney-produced English dub was recorded in 1998 and planned for release on video in 1999, but Disney eventually decided to release it to theaters instead.
After Princess Mononoke (1997) did not fare as well in the US as Japan, Laputa's release date was pushed back yet again; on occasion the completed dub was screened at select children's festivals. The film was finally released on DVD and video in the US on August 16, 2005 alongside Kiki's Delivery Service and Spirited Away.  As with Mononoke and Kiki, critical opinion was mixed about the new dub, but Cloris Leachman and Mark Hamill's performances as Dola and Muska drew praise.[tpl]cite web|last=Moure |first=Dani |title=Laputa: Castle in the Sky |publisher=Mania Beyond Entertainment |date=April 4, 2006 |url=http://www.mania.com/laputa-castle-sky_article_74336.html |accessdate=2008-12-30[/tpl] Laputa was the second-best selling DVD from Studio Ghibli distributed by Disney in the year of its release (after Spirited Away and ahead of Kiki's Delivery Service).[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl] Laputa was reissued on American home video in March 2010 as a tribute accompanying the home video release of Ponyo.

==Title==

Although meaningless in Japanese, the name "Laputa" comes from Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. English language dubs of Laputa have been released under three different titles by three separate distributors, which is largely due to an unintended similarity to the Spanish slang "la puta" (lit. "the whore"), which would be offensive to many.
In 2003, the film's title was shortened from Laputa: Castle in the Sky to Castle in the Sky in several countries, including the United States, Mexico, and Spain. In Spain the castle was named Lapuntu. This change was carried to a number of non-Spanish speaking countries, including Britain and France, under Disney's Buena Vista Home Entertainment label. Although "Laputa" was removed from the title, it appeared on the rear cover of the DVD, and was used throughout the film, without modification.
The film's full name was later restored in Britain, in February 2006, when Optimum Asia – a division of London-based Optimum Releasing – acquired the UK distribution rights to the Studio Ghibli collection.
Additionally, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the original English dub (the older, non-Streamline dub, or the pre-Disney dub) was screened in the UK, as an art house film, under the alternative title Laputa: The Flying Island. It was shown at least twice on British television, but some scenes were cut.

==Differences between versions==

Although the plot and much of the script was left intact, Disney's English dub of Laputa: Castle in the Sky contains some changes. These differences do not appear in the original dub.
Although all these alterations were approved by Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki, there have been a number of critics who called them into question. On the other hand, Miyazaki himself is said to have approved of Hisaishi's reworking;[tpl]cite web|title=Tenkuu no Shiro Rapyuta |publisher=The Hayao Miyazaki Web |url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/laputa/music.html |accessdate=2008-12-30[/tpl] his compliments were echoed by several reviewers.[tpl]cite web|last=Pinsky |first=Michael |title=Castle In The Sky |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=May 21, 2003 |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/castleinsky.php |accessdate=2008-12-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Franklin |first=Garth |title=Review: "Castle in the Sky" |publisher=Dark Horizons |url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/reviews/castleinthesky.php |accessdate=2008-12-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Taylor |first=Dawn |title=Castle in the Sky |publisher=DVD Journal Review |url=http://www.dvdjournal.com/quickreviews/c/castleinthesky.q.shtml |accessdate=2008-12-30[/tpl] The 2010 DVD re-release (later ported to a 2012 U.S. Blu-ray release) omits most of these changes. The new score has been removed, having been replaced by Hisaishi's original synthesizer score, the sound effects are reverted to the original Japanese production, and a lot of the added dialogue has been eliminated, making the dub closer to the original Japanese. Additionally, the subtitles on the newer release are mostly dubtitles.  (Oddly, however, the Japanese, Australia, and UK Blu-rays contain the newer score on the Disney dub track — minus the extra dialogue and newer sound effects — as well as literal, properly timed subtitles.)
