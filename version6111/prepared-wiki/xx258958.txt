The rosy tetra (Hyphessobrycon rosaceus) is a small species of Characid freshwater fish from the South American countries of Guyana and Brazil. It is popular in the aquarium trade.

==Appearance==

The rosy tetra has a light pink-white body with red fins, except the dorsal fin which can be black or white, and the caudal fin which is pink-white with two elliptical red spots on it. It has a faint black line from the top of its eyeball through the pupil, to the bottom of the eyeball. Like many other tetras, the males have longer dorsal fins than the females.

==In the aquarium==

Generally, they are peaceful fish that do well in shoals of about six to ten or more, and they rarely attack other fish in a community tank.

===Water conditions===

The rosy tetra is a tropical fish and a temperature of between [tpl]convert|24|and|28|C|F|abbr=on[/tpl] is suitable.  In the wild they come from areas with soft acid water, but the adults can tolerate neutral or even slightly alkaline water in an aquarium.They thrive in very acidic water with a pH of 5.5-7.5 where they can display their colouration more vividly, although they are, however, able to survive in slightly alkaline water.

==Reproduction==

The rosy tetra is an egg scattering school spawning fish in the wild.
In an aquarium it is often spawned as a pair.  100 eggs can be laid by one female, usually in the early morning, and over fine leaved plants.

==Conservation status==

The IUCN red list has not evaluated the likelihood of this species becoming extinct.
