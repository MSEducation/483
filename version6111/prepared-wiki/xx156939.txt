CATEGORIES: Runestones in Uppland, Runestones raised in memory of women

U 15 is located inside Ekerö church. It was previously part of the stonefloor in the church but has since been put on display. It is assumed that Ingeborg lived at old Asknäs estate that is located close to the church. The stone is also referred to as the Ingeborg-stone. It is noteworthy that, while the stone uses the rune alphabet, the inscription itself is in Latin.
