==History of the 98.7 Frequency==

Prior to July 2008, this frequency was occupied by WSGY, a repeater of Froggy 98 from Altoona, Pennsylvania.
It originally was licensed to Mill Hall, PA as WZRZ. Engineer Jack (Jay) Kennedy found this available frequency and put it on the air, playing an assortment of formats. Then, in 1997, Sabatino Cupelli purchased the license and hired Sam Jordan to program the station. Mr. Jordan studied the market and decided to do a Classic Rock format and positioned the station as "Rock 98.7" and also programmed Pittsburgh Pirates baseball, NFL Football, and high school sports on the station.
Later on, the station was sold to Forever Broadcasting and the license eventually moved to Pleasant Gap under the call letters of WLTS-FM. Throughout Forever's ownership, the station carried a Smooth Jazz Format under the calls WSMO as well as Adult Rock as WQWK and Country as WSGY.  The station was later sold again to 2510 Associates who also operate State College stations WBHV-FM (B94.5) and WOWY 97.1 and is broadcast a soft A/C format programmed by Nick Ferrara using the handle 98.7 Wish-FM. The Wish Wake-Up Show was hosted by State College Radio Vet Ruth O'Brien.
On August 18, 2011, WWSH changed their format to mainstream rock, branded as "Eagle 98.7" under new call letters, WEMR. Their current lineup is the "Morning Drive" with Wentz and The Drive Home "Overdrive" with Shannon.
