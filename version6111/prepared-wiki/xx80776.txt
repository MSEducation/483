In March, 2011, Fr. Weinandy participated in a telephone press conference with scholars from Catholic, Protestant and Jewish backgrounds the day before the release of Pope Benedict XVI’s book Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week. Weinandy said that Pope Benedict "sees Jesus as someone the world is longing to meet, and he’s doing his best to try to provide that opportunity."[tpl]cite news |title= Scholars praise Pope’s new book for promoting biblical studies renewal |first= Kevin J. |last= Jones |url= http://www.ewtnnews.com/catholic-news/US.php?id=2793 |newspaper= EWTN News |date= 10 March 2011 |accessdate=19 July 2012 |quote= The book... examines the final week of Jesus’ earthly life and the historical and theological questions surrounding his death.[/tpl]
In a May 2011 address to the Academy of Catholic Theology in Washington, D.C., Fr. Weinandy, warned of a “crisis” in Catholic theology, precipitated by theologians who “often appear to possess little reverence for the mysteries of the faith as traditionally understood and presently professed within the church.” The Secretariat for Doctrine had previously criticized a book on the Trinity by St. Joseph Sr. Elizabeth Johnson of Fordham University in New York, leading to a defense of Johnson by many theologians as well as Fordham faculty. Weinandy's address did not mention any theologian by name. “Theology may be the only academic pursuit where one can seemingly be considered a theologian without actually having to know the subject matter,” he said. “It would appear at times that a theologian need not actually know God.” Describing the theological crisis, Weinandy said: “Much of what passes for contemporary Catholic theology, often is not founded upon an assent of faith in the divine deposit of revelation as proclaimed in the sacred scriptures and developed within the living doctrinal and moral tradition of the church.”[tpl]cite news |title= Bishops Critique Work of Feminist Theologian |first= Joan Frawley |last= Desmond |url= http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/bishops-critique-work-of-feminist-theologian |newspaper= National Catholic Register |date= 6 April 2011 |accessdate=18 July 2012 |quote= Book ‘employs standards from outside the faith,’ the doctrine committee asserts.

Father Weinendy responded to a July, 2012 article in Newsweek written by theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss describing how confirmation of existence of the Higgs Boson particle could get rid of the idea of a supernatural creator permanently. "While the Higgs particle may help us in understanding the relationship between mass and matter, it does not explain why the Higgs particle itself exists," Weinandy said. “There must be a being whose very nature demands that it exists and, because of this, is able to bring other beings into existence.”[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=14963 |title= USCCB doctrine official comments on Higgs Boson |date= 18 July 2012 |work= CatholicCulture.org |publisher= Trinity Communications |accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://usccbmedia.blogspot.com/2012/07/faith-science-and-grownups-god.html |title= Faith, Science and a Grownup's God  |last= Clemmer |first= Don |date= 17 July 2012 |work= USCCB Blog |publisher= U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops |accessdate=18 July 2012 |quote= Like the discovery of the Higgs particle, evolution involved scientific discovery seemingly stepping into territory reserved for God in the Genesis creation accounts.[/tpl]
