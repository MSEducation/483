Mary Temple Grandin (born August 29, 1947) is an American doctor of animal science, a professor at Colorado State University, a best-selling author, an autistic activist, a consultant to the livestock industry on animal behavior, and an engineer. She also created the "hug box", a device to calm those with autism. The subject of an award-winning, 2010 biographical film, Temple Grandin, she also was listed in the Time 100 list of the one hundred most influential people in the world in the "Heroes" category.

==Early life and education==

Grandin was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Eustacia Cutler and Richard Grandin. She was diagnosed with autism at the age of two in 1949. Diagnosed and labeled with brain damage, at that early age she was placed in a structured nursery school with what she considers to have been good teachers. After Grandin's mother spoke to a doctor who suggested speech therapy, she hired a nanny who spent hours playing turn-taking games with Grandin and her sister.Temple Grandin and Richard Panek (2013) The Autistic Brain: Thinking Across the Spectrum, p. 4. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.
Grandin suffered from delayed speech development, as she began talking at the age of four (developmental guidelines anticipate a vocabulary of eight to ten words by eighteen months of age.[tpl]cite web|title=Language development: Speech milestones for babies|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/language-development/ART-20045163|accessdate=19 January 2014|author=Mayo Clinic staff[/tpl]) She considers herself lucky to have had supportive mentors from primary school onward. Grandin has said, however, that middle and high school were the most unpleasant times of her life due to her poor conversational skills. She was the "nerdy kid" whom everyone ridiculed. At times, while she walked down the hallways, her fellow students would taunt her by saying "tape recorder" because she would repeat herself constantly. Grandin states, "I could laugh about it now, but back then it really hurt."'Temple Grandin Inducted into Colorado Women's Hall of Fame', http://www.wherefoodcomesfrom.com/article/2281/Temple-Grandin-Inducted-into-Colorado-Womens-Hall-of-Fame#.UdA8G2thiK0, retrieved 30 June 2013.
After graduation from Hampshire Country School, a boarding school for gifted children in Rindge, New Hampshire in 1966, Grandin went on to earn her bachelor's degree in psychology from Franklin Pierce College in 1970, a master's degree in animal science from Arizona State University in 1975, and a doctoral degree in animal science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in 1989.

==Career==

Grandin is a prominent and widely cited proponent of the rights of autistic persons and of animal welfare.http://www.apbspeakers.com/speaker/temple-grandin
She has lectured widely about her first hand experiences of the anxiety of feeling threatened by everything in her surroundings, and of being dismissed and feared, which motivates her work in humane livestock handling processes. Her business website promotes improvement of standards in slaughter plants and livestock farms. In 2004 she won a "Proggy" award in the "Visionary" category, from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/feat/proggy/2004/winners.html#visionary |title=2004 PETA Proggy Awards |publisher=PETA |date=2004-09-30 |accessdate=2009-08-09[/tpl]
One of her notable essays about animal welfare is "Animals Are Not Things,"[tpl]cite web|title=Animals are not things|url=http://www.grandin.com/welfare/animals.are.not.things.html|accessdate=2009-07-06[/tpl] in which she posits that technically, animals are property in our society, but the law ultimately gives them ethical protections or rights. She compares the properties and rights of owning cows, versus owning screwdrivers, enumerating how both may be used to serve human purposes in many ways, but when it comes to inflicting pain, there is a vital distinction between such 'properties': legally a person can smash or grind up a screwdriver, but cannot torture an animal legally.
Grandin became well-known after being described by Oliver Sacks in the title narrative of his book An Anthropologist on Mars (1995); the title is derived from Grandin's description of how she feels around neurotypical people. She first spoke in public about autism in the mid-1980s, at the request of Ruth C. Sullivan, one of the founders of the Autism Society of America. Sullivan writes:
 ''I first met Temple in the mid-1980s the annual ASA conference. Standing on the periphery of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn't until later in the week that I realized she was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's ASA conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an ASA audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive ("like being tied to the rail and the train's coming"). She was asked many questions: "Why does my son do so much spinning?" "Why does he hold his hands to his ears?" "Why doesn't he look at me?" She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=adPodg5MNU0C&pg=PR13&lpg=PR13&dq=temple+grandin+ruth+sullivan&source=bl&ots=F5HS-I2urT&sig=HOQd0c3EAwTYNyp7JKzpMaX0PLs&hl=en&ei=3zxuS4vmMo-uswOq85yxDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=temple%20grandin%20ruth%20sullivan&f=false |title=The Way I See It: A Personal Look at ... – Temple Grandin – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17[/tpl] 
Based on personal experience, Grandin advocates early intervention to address autism and supportive teachers, who can direct fixations of the child with autism in fruitful directions. She has described her hypersensitivity to noise and other sensory stimuli. She claims she is a primarily visual thinker,[tpl]cite journal |author=Grandin T |title=How does visual thinking work in the mind of a person with autism? A personal account |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=364 |issue=1522 |pages=1437–42 |year=2009 |pmid=19528028 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0297 |url= |pmc=2677580[/tpl] and has said that words are her second language. Temple attributes her success as a humane livestock facility designer to her ability to recall detail, which is a characteristic of her visual memory. Grandin compares her memory to full-length movies in her head, that may be replayed at will, allowing her to notice small details. She also is able to view her memories using slightly different contexts by changing the positions of the lighting and shadows.
Her insight into the minds of cattle has taught her to value the changes in details to which animals are particularly sensitive, and to use her visualization skills to design thoughtful and humane animal-handling equipment. She was named a fellow of the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asabe.org/awards/fellow/asabefellow_2009.html|title= 2009 ASABE Fellows | publisher=American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE)|accessdate=2010-12-29[/tpl]
As a partial proponent of neurodiversity, Grandin has expressed that she would not support a cure of the entirety of the autism spectrum.[tpl]cite web|author=Wrong Planet – Aspergers and Autism Community |url=http://www.wrongplanet.net/article295.html |title=Interview with Temple Grandin |publisher=Wrong Planet |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17[/tpl]
In 2012, when the American beef industry was struggling with public perception of its use and sale of pink slime, Grandin spoke out in support of the food product. She said, “It should be on the market. It should be labeled. We should not be throwing away that much beef."[tpl]cite web | title=Animal scientist Temple Grandin supports ‘pink slime’ | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/all-we-can-eat/post/animal-scientist-temple-grandin-supports-pink-slime/2012/05/23/gJQAyrDnlU_blog.html | date=2012-05-23 | accessdate=2012-11-18 | work=Washington Post [/tpl]

==Personal life==

Grandin says that "the part of other people that has emotional relationships is not part of me", and she has neither married nor had children. Beyond her work in animal science and welfare and autism rights, her interests include horse riding, science fiction, movies, and biochemistry.
She has noted in her autobiographical works that autism affects every aspect of her life. She has to wear comfortable clothes to counteract her sensory processing disorder and has structured her lifestyle to avoid sensory overload. She regularly takes anti-depressants, but no longer uses a squeeze-box (hug machine), a device which she invented at the age of 18 as a form of stress relief therapy, stating in February 2010 that: "It broke two years ago, and I never got around to fixing it. I'm into hugging people now."Claudia Wallis: “Temple Grandin on Temple Grandin”. Time, February 4, 2010
On August 5, 2013, Grandin's mother, Eustacia Cutler, published an article on The Daily Beast linking autistic men with child pornography.Autism and Child Pornography: A Toxic Combination The article met with outrage from the autistic community for lacking any evidence supporting Cutler's claims. A critical article by Emily Willingham was published on Forbes.com that circulated widely.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2013/08/05/temple-grandins-mother-links-autism-with-viewing-child-pornography/ |title=Temple Grandin's Mother Links Autism With Viewing Child Pornography |date= August 5, 2013 |accessdate= October 11, 2013[/tpl] Grandin issued a response to the article authored by her mother and analysis of its criticism in an interview on the blog, Life Tinted Blue.[tpl]cite web |url= http://lifetintedblue.com/an-interview-with-dr-temple-grandin/ |title= An Interview With Dr. Temple Grandin |work= Life Tinted Blue |date= September 18, 2013 |accessdate= October 11, 2013[/tpl]
