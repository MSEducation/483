Off Road Challenge is a video game developed and published by Midway Games. The game was originally released in 1997 for arcades using the Midway V Unit hardware. It is part of the Off Road series which began with Ivan 'Ironman' Stewart's Super Off Road.
The game was eventually released for the Nintendo 64 in 1998 developed by Avalanche Software and published by Midway Games. The Nintendo 64 conversion included several unlockable tracks and an added circuit mode.

==Gameplay==

The levels are mostly offroad tracks, sometimes containing urban areas. It features a very primitive vehicle tuning system that allowes the player to "Beef Up Your Truck!!" by purchasing upgrades to suspension, tires, "acceleration", and various other performance items. It also features power-ups which you drive over with your vehicle, such as nitro, crash helmets (to prevent you from losing speed when colliding with others) and money to spend upgrading your vehicle. Treasure Chests and Nitro Capsules can be found lying on the ground during the race. When you race, you are against 7 other opponents, there are various obstacles depending on the place you race in (such as wagon carts, a train, water slicks, trees, etc.) Top 4 places earn cash, with 1st place being the most rewarding. The faster the finish, the better chance you have to make a new record on the Top-Ten leaderboard.

==Tracks==

The game has six tracks, ranging in difficulty from beginner, to intermediate, to advanced:
Plus three more unlockable tracks:

==Reception==

IGN gave the Nintendo 64 version of Off Road Challenge a 2.5 out of 10 criticising the graphics stating "it was dated with most objects having blurry sprites, the textures being muddy and the framerates being low" and the presentation saying that the menus that were directly ported from the arcade slowed down.IGN Reviews Off Road Challenge (N64 version)
