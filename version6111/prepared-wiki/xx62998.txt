Selena is a 1997 American biographical musical drama film about the life and career of the late Tejano music star Selena, a recording artist well known in the Mexican-American and Hispanic communities in the United States and Mexico before she was murdered by the president of her fan club at the age of 23.
The film stars Jennifer Lopez in her breakthrough role as Selena. Her father, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., is played by Edward James Olmos and Constance Marie plays Marcella Quintanilla.

==Plot==

The film opens on February 26, 1995, with Selena (Jennifer Lopez) playing a sold-out crowd of 65,000 at the Houston Astrodome. Back in 1961, a young Abraham Quintanilla and his band "The Dinos" are rejected for an audition by a white restaurant owner due to his "Whites Only" policy. In 1981, Abraham, now married to Marcella, has three kids. When his youngest daughter Selena sings with him, he is amazed by her voice and decides to start a band called "Selena y los Dinos" with Selena as the lead singer, his son A.B. on bass, and his older daughter Suzette on drums. He soon opens a restaurant and there Selena sings and is warmly received. Unfortunately, the Quintanilla family goes bankrupt and is forced to close the restaurant and moves to Corpus Christi, Texas, to live with Abraham's brother.
Selena meets a guitarist, Chris Perez, who after joining the band, develops a friendship with her. Chris and Selena's friendship grows into love and when Abraham catches them hugging on their tour bus, Big Bertha, he fires Chris from the band and harshly threatens a heartbroken Selena that if she continues seeing him, he will disband the group.
Selena and Chris continue seeing each other behind Abraham's back, but soon she becomes tired and tells Chris that she wants to get married right away. On April 2, 1992, Selena and Chris secretly elope, but their marriage soon makes radio headlines. She goes to see her family, who eventually accept Chris into the Quintanilla family and he returns to being the lead guitarist for Los Dinos.
During one of Selena's live performances, Jose Behar (the head of EMI Latin) and his music associates tell Abraham that they want to make an English-language album for Selena. In 1994, Selena opens her first boutique called "Selena Etc.", which her fan-club president Yolanda Saldívar manages, and her album Selena Live! wins a Grammy Award for Best Mexican-American album. As 1995 begins, she starts recording her crossover album, and Saldívar gives her a friendship ring, which was really a gift from Selena's staff.
Later, Selena finds out from her father that Yolanda was stealing money from her fan club and a lot of business records have gone missing. On March 9, Abraham, Selena and Suzette confront Saldívar about the evidence they found. Saldívar denies knowing anything about the missing records and says that if given time, she can explain everything. However on March 31, Selena is murdered by Saldívar, who is later arrested after a nine-and-a-half-hour standoff while Selena's fans, friends, and family are left grieving over her death.

==Production==

On August 30, 1995, it was announced that Gregory Nava had signed on to write and direct Selena. The director was well known for his previous films El Norte and Mi Familia, which "gave moviegoers a passionate, powerful look at Hispanic life" according to The Dallas Morning News.[tpl]cite web|title=Nava chosen for `Selena' movie Filming to begin in February 1996|work=The Dallas Morning News|publisher=(James M.

Abraham agreed to the film as "sort of a pre-emptive strike", and felt that it was better the film about Selena's life be made with him rather than someone else.[tpl]cite web|title=SELENA' ARRIVES LATE TEJANO SUPERSTAR'S FAMILY LEAVES LOVING IMPRINT ON SCRIPT ...|work=The Fresno Bee|publisher=The McClatchy Company|accessdate=January 8, 2013|date=March 21, 1997[/tpl] Abraham had personally chosen Nava, stating: "I chose Mr. Nava because I think he's a good director and scriptwriter". The film was created with full participation from the Quintanilla family. The biographical film was focused on Selena's life instead of her death, Nava said "I don't want to attend to murder", while her death is treated "at a distance".

===Casting===

In June 1996, it was announced that Jennifer Lopez was chosen to play Selena, in what was described as the "role of a lifetime", for a reported salary of $1 million.[tpl]cite news|last=Jakle|first=Jeanne|title=Selena star says yes to role as fiancee|accessdate=January 8, 2013|newspaper=San Antonio Express-News|publisher=Hearst Corporation|date=October 30, 1996[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=`Mi Familia' actress Jennifer Lopez to play Selena in movie|work=Austin-American Statesman|publisher=(Cox Enterprises)|accessdate=January 8, 2013|date=June 15, 1996[/tpl] Also that month, it was announced that a 10-year-old girl originating from Harlingen, Becky Le Meza, was chosen from "thousands of girls who answered a nationwide casting call" to play a younger version of Selena in the film.

However, Lopez's casting was the subject to high criticism from fans of Selena, who weren't pleased that Lopez, a New York City native born to Puerto Rican parents, was selected to play Selena, a Texan of Mexican descent. They preferred an actress with Mexican roots. The Latino community began protesting for a re-cast. During pre-production, Lopez stated: "I know a few people were protesting, but in Corpus hometown everyone has been really supportive". Nava admitted that the backlash was "a little hurtful", and felt that the protesters "should be celebrating that we have an all-Latino cast and that Jennifer Lopez, one of our own, is becoming a star." Dave Karger of Entertainment Weekly noted that "nothing could have prepared Lopez for the hype attached to her million-dollar salary". Lopez perfected Selena's dialect while also "studying performance footage of the pop sensation" according to Nava. Lopez said "you need to do your homework on this gig" because Selena was "fresh in the public's mind". After seeing Lopez's portrayal of Selena, protesters revised their opinions and were more accepting of Nava's decision.Guzman, Isabel Molina and Angharad N. Valdivia.

===Filming===

Principal photography began September 1996, in San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Texas, Poteet Texas,Houston Texas and Lake Jackson, Texas. Nava used locals as extras for the film.[tpl]cite web|last=Bennett|first=David|title=Director to use Corpus Christi, S.A. locales in Selena movie|work=San Antonio Express-News|publisher=(Hearst Corporation)|accessdate=January 8, 2013|date=September 14, 1996[/tpl] Selena's real singing voice was used in the film, while Lopez would lip-sync to her songs. During filming, Jon Seda was unable to play the guitar the way Chris Perez did, as he explained on the film's DVD extra, Making of Selena: 10 Years Later. He then persuaded Perez to pay a visit to the set without telling him that he was going to have Perez play the guitar during the scene in which Chris auditions for Abraham, and the camera would zoom into his hands to make it seem like Seda was playing the guitar. Perez eventually agreed, and his hands were made up to match Seda's.[tpl]cite DVD notes | title       =Making of Selena: 10 Years Later | others    =Gregory Nava | type      =DVD | publisher   = | year        =September 2007 | language =[/tpl]Selena LIVE: The Last Concert, "All Access: Behind the Scenes", movie featurette. In the noted stadium scenes, where Selena once performed, the producers used approximately 35,000 extras. The stadium scenes are arguably the film's centerpiece. Filming took place at the Alamodome in San Antonio, rather than the actual concert location: the Astrodome in Houston.Béhar, Henri. Film Scouts, interview with Gregory Nava.

However, Nava maintained that while this was true, the scene was inevitable because it was an important part to Selena's story. Abraham eventually agreed.

===Music===

An original motion picture Selena soundtrack was released by EMI Latin Records on March 11, 1997 debuting at 7 on the Billboard Charts and selling over 3,000,000 copies.  The CD contains twelve tracks including Selena singing songs heard in the film. The only songs performed by Selena that were not heard on the film were "Is it the Beat," "Only Love," and "A Boy Like That," and the Selena tributes sung by other artists.
The only recordings by Selena heard on the film were the "Cumbia Medley," "Disco Medley," and "Where Did the Feeling Go?", which was played in the last half of the closing credits of the film. The Vidal Brothers' "Oldies Medley" was also on the film. Included are rare tracks, hits, and cuts like the "Disco Medley, Part II", recorded live during Selena's 1995 concert at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. All songs were recordings of Selena from concerts.

===Critical response===

Selena received mostly positive reviews from critics. Roger Ebert, film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, was impressed by the acting, and gave Selena three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, "Young Selena is played by Becky Le Meza, who has a big smile and a lot of energy. The teenage and adult Selena is played by Lopez in a star-making performance. After her strong work as the passionate lover of Jack Nicholson in the current Blood and Wine, here she creates a completely different performance, as a loyal Quintanilla who does most of her growing up on a tour bus with her dad at the wheel."Ebert, Roger. The Chicago Sun-Times, film review, March 21, 1997. Last accessed: January 9, 2008.
Film critic Lisa Kropiewnicki liked the film and wrote, "Jennifer Lopez delivers a breakout performance...and Nava's engaging script wisely mines his subject's life for humor and conflict, embracing Selena Quintanilla's passion for music."Kropiewnicki, Lisa. [tpl]Amg movie|154769|Selena[/tpl], film review. Last accessed: January 9, 2008. Film critic James Berardinelli also liked the film and the screenplay, writing, "It would have been easy to trivialize Selena's story, turning it into a sudsy, made-for-TV type motion picture."  He believed the acting was top notch and wrote "Jennifer Lopez is radiant as the title character, conveying the boundless energy and enthusiasm that exemplified Selena, while effectively copying not only her look, but her mannerisms. I wonder if Selena's family, upon watching this performance, felt an eerie sense of déjà vu."Berardinelli, James. Reel Views, film review, 1997. Last accessed: January 9, 2008.
Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan gave the film a mixed review. He wrote the film is part of a "completely predictable Latino soap opera." Yet, "there are chunks of Selena that only a stone could resist. This movie turns out to be a celebration not only of the singer but also (as "What's Love" was for Angela Bassett) of the actress who plays her, Jennifer Lopez."Turan, Kenneth. Los Angeles Times, "In the Authorized Selena, She's Seen in the Best Light", Calendar Section, March 21, 1997.  Last accessed: January 9, 2008.
Some critics, however, did not like how the film appears like a sanitized Selena portrait. Critic Walter Addiego considers Nava's work a worshipful biography of her. Addiego, writing for the San Francisco Examiner, did have a few enjoyable moments viewing the film but wrote, "You can't help cheering for Selena, but the good feeling is diminished by the sense that her story's been simplified and sanitized."Addiego, Walter. San Francisco Examiner, film review, page C, March 21, 1997. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 64% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on thirty-nine reviews.Selena at Rotten Tomatoes. Last accessed: September 12, 2011. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from film critics, it has a rating score of 65, indicating "Generally favorable reviews".
