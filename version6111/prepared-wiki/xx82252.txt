In allyl lithium compounds, the lithium cation coordinates to the face of the carbon π bond in an η-3 fashion instead of a localized, carbanionic center, thus, allyllithiums are often less aggregated than alkyllithiums. In aryllithium complexes, the lithium cation coordinates to a single carbanion center through a Li-C σ type bond.

===Solid state structure===

Like other species consisting of polar subunits, organolithium species aggregate.[tpl]cite journal|last=Strohmann|first=C|coauthors=et al.|title=Structure Formation Principles and Reactivity of Organolithium Compounds.|journal= Chem. Eur. J.|year=2009|volume=15|pages=3320–3334|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/chem.200900041/asset/3320_ftp.pdf?v=1&t=hnc3zl4k&s=90cd763c5affe82ca5d8208a75ea074deede3187[/tpl]

Formation of aggregates is influenced by electrostatic interactions, the coordination between lithium and surrounding solvent molecules or polar additives, and steric effects.
A basic building block toward constructing more complex structures is a carbanionic center interacting with a Li3 triangle in an η- 3 fashion.
In simple alkyllithium reagents, these triangles aggregate to form tetrahedron or octahedron structures. For example, methyllithium, ethyllithium and tert-butyllithium all exist in the tetramer RLi4. Methyllithium exists as tetramers in a cubic structure in the solid state, with four lithium centers forming a tetrahedron. Each methanide in the tetramer in methyllithium can have agostic interaction with lithium cations in adjacent tetramers.
Ethyllithium and tert-butyllithium, on the other hand, do not exhibit this interaction, and are thus soluble in non-polar hydrocarbon solvents. Another class of alkyllithium adopts hexameric structures, such as n-butyllithium, isopropyllithium, and cyclohexanyllithium.
Common lithium amides, e.g. lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, and lithium diisopropylamide are also subject to aggregation.[tpl]cite journal|author=Williard, P. G.; Salvino,  J. M. |journal=Journal of Organic Chemistry|year=1993| volume=58|issue=1|pages=1–3|title=Synthesis, isolation, and structure of an LDA-THF complex |doi=10.1021/jo00053a001[/tpl] Lithium amides adopt polymeric-ladder type structures in non-coordinating solvent in the solid state, and they generally exist as dimers in ethereal solvents. In the presence of strongly donating ligands, tri- or tetramerc lithium centers are formed.

For example, LDA exists primarily as dimers in THF. The structures of common lithium amides, such as lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) have bee extensively studied by Collum and coworkers using NMR spectroscopy.
Another important class of reagents is silyllithiums, extensively used in the synthesis of organometallic complexes and polysilane dendrimers.
In the solid state, in contrast with alkyllithium reagents, most silyllithiums tend to form monomeric structures coordinated with solvent molecules such as THF, and only a few silyllithiums have been characterized as higher aggregates.
This difference can arise from the method of preparation of silyllithiums, the steric hindrance caused by the bulky alkyl substituents on silicon, and the less polarized nature of Si-Li bonds.The addition of strongly donating ligands, such as TMEDA and (-)-sparteine, can displace coordinating solvent molecules in silyllithiums.

===Solution structure===

Relying solely on the structural information of organolithium aggregates obtained in the solid state from crystal structures has certain limits, as it is possible for organolithium reagents to adopt different structures in reaction solution environment. Also, in some cases the crystal structure of an organolithium species can be difficult to isolate. Therefore, studying the structures of organolithium reagents, and the lithium-containing intermediates in solution form is extremely useful in understanding the reactivity of these reagents.
 NMR spectroscopy has emerged as powerful tool for the studies of organolithium aggregates in solution. For alkyllithium species, C-Li J coupling can often used to determine the number of lithium interacting with a carbanion center, and whether these interactions are static or dynamic. Separate NMR signals can also differentiate the presence of multiple aggregates from a common monomeric unit. 

The structures of organolithium compounds are affected by the presence of Lewis bases such as e.g., tetrahydrofuran (THF), diethyl ether (Et2O), tetramethylethylene diamine (TMEDA) or hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA). Methyllithium is a special case, in which solvation with ether, or polar additive HMPA does not deaggregate the tetrameric structure in the solid state. On the other hand, THF deaggregates hexameric butyl lithium: the tetramer is the major species, and ΔG for interconversion between tetramer and dimer is around 11 kcal/mol. TMEDA can also chelate to the lithium cations in n-butyllithium and form solvated dimers such as LiBu-n)2. Phenyllithium has been shown to exist as a distorted tetramer in the crystallized ether solvate, and as a mixture of dimer and tetramer in ether solution.

===Structure and reactivity===

As the structures of organolithium reagents change according to their chemical environment, so do their reactivity and selectivity.
One question surrounding the structure-reactivity relationship is whether there exists a correlation between the degree of aggregation and the reactivity of organolithium reagents. It was originally proposed that lower aggregates such as monomers are more reactive in alkyllithiums.[ref]

</ref> 
However, reaction pathways in which dimer or other oligomers are the reactive species have also been discovered, and for lithium amides such as LDA, dimer-based reactions are common. 
A series of solution kinetics studies of LDA - mediated reactions suggest that lower aggregates of enolates do not necessarily lead to higher reactivity.
Also, some Lewis bases increase reactivity of organolithium compounds.[tpl]cite journal|last=Chalk|first=A.J|coauthors=Hoogeboom, T.J|title=Ring metalation of toluene by butyllithium in the presence of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine|journal= J.Organomet.Chem|year=1968|volume=11|pages=615–618|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/0022328X68800919/1-s2.0-0022328X68800919-main.pdf?_tid=7e210432-400f-11e3-ae82-00000aab0f6b&acdnat=1382992283_758e6f8c4a5075990e017ab0a5c00770[/tpl]

However, whether these additives function as strong chelating ligands, and how the observed increase in reactivity relates to structural changes in aggregates caused by these additives are not always clear.[tpl]cite journal|last=Chalk|first=A.J|coauthors=Hoogeboom, T.J|title=Ring metalation of toluene by butyllithium in the presence of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine|journal= J.Organomet.Chem|year=1968|volume=11|pages=615–618|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/0022328X68800919/1-s2.0-0022328X68800919-main.pdf?_tid=7e210432-400f-11e3-ae82-00000aab0f6b&acdnat=1382992283_758e6f8c4a5075990e017ab0a5c00770[/tpl] 
[tpl]cite journal|last=Reich|first=H.J|coauthors=Green, D.P|title=Spectroscopic and Reactivity Studies of Lithium Reagent - HMPA Complexes|journal=JACS|year=1989|volume=111|pages=8729|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00205a030|doi=10.1021/ja00205a030[/tpl] 
For example, TMEDA increases rates and efficiencies in many reactions involving organolithium reagents. Toward alkyllithium reagents, TMEDA functions as a donor ligand, reduces the degree of aggregation, and increases the nucleophilicity of these species.[tpl]cite journal|last=Williard|first=P.G|coauthors=Nichols, M.A|title=Solid-state structures of n-butyllithium-TMEDA, -THF, and -DME complexes|journal=JACS|year=1993|volume=115|pages=1568–1572|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00057a050|doi=10.1021/ja00057a050[/tpl]
However, TMEDA does not always function as a donor ligand to lithium cation, especially in the presence of anionic oxygen and nitrogen centers. For example, it only weakly interacts with LDA and LiHMDS even in hydrocarbon solvents with no competing donor ligands. 
In imine lithiation, while THF acts as a strong donating ligand to LiHMDS, the weakly coordinating TMEDA readily dissociates from LiHMDS, leading to the formation of LiHMDS dimers that is the more reactive species. Thus, in the case of LiHMDS, TMEDA does not increase reactivity by reducing aggregation state. Also, as opposed to simple alkyllithium compounds, TMEDA does not deaggregate lithio-acetophenolate in THF solution.

The addition of HMPA to lithium amides such as LiHMDS and LDA often results in a mixture of dimer/monomer aggregates in THF. However, the ratio of dimer/monomer species does not change with increased concentration of HMPA, thus, the observed increase in reactivity is not the result of deaggregation. The mechanism of how these additives increase reactivity is still being researched.

==Reactivity and applications==

The C-Li bond in organolithium reagents is highly polarized. As a result, the carbon assumes most of the electron density in the bond and resembles a carbanion. Thus, organolithium reagents are strongly basic and nucleophilic. Some of the most common applications of organolithium reagents in synthesis include their use as nucleophiles, strong bases for deprotonation, initiator for polymerization, and starting material for the preparation of other organometallic compounds.

===Organolithium reagent as nucleophile===

====Carbolithiation reactions====

As nucleophiles, organolithium reagents undergo carbolithiation reactions, whereby the carbon-lithium bond adds across a carbon-carbon double or triple bond, forming new organolithium species.[ref]
