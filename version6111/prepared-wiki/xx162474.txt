Cleophus "Cid" Edwards, born October 10, 1943 in Selma, Alabama is a graduate from Tennessee State University, played professional American football in the NFL from 1968 to 1975.  Edwards, a running back, in his play for the Chargers, had one particularly good year, 1973, wherein the Chargers' offense largely consisted of lobbing screen passes to Edwards, who would rumble down field for much positive yardage.  He is in a sense an obscure folk hero in Chargers lore.
