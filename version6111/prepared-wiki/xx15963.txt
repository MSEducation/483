His work, the Cosmographia from 1544, was the earliest German description of the world.

==Life==

He was born in Ingelheim, near Mainz, as the son of Andreas Munster. His parents and other ancestors were farmers.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|last=Horst Robert Balz, Gerhard Krause, Gerhard Müller|encyclopedia=Theologische Realenzyklopädie|title=Münster, Sebastian (1488-1552)|volume=23|year=1994|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=3-11-013852-2|page=407|url=http://books.google.cz/books?id=jwd_lhDN9b4C&pg=PA407&ots=f_S3qwiWi_&dq=sebastian+m%C3%BCnster+%22s+408%22&hl=de&sig=Fn6p7lHf5EldNKnScsHrZycwxBg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=sebastian%20m%C3%BCnster%20%22s%20408%22&f=false[/tpl]
In 1505, he entered the Franciscan order. Four years later, he entered a monastery where he became a student of Konrad Pelikan for five years. Münster completed his studies at the Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen in 1518. His graduate adviser was Johannes Stöffler.[tpl]cite web|url=http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=127365 |title=Mathematics Genealogy Project |publisher=Genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05[/tpl]
He left the Franciscans for the Lutheran Church in order to accept an appointment at the Reformed Church-dominated University of Basel in 1529.[tpl]Cite EB1911|wstitle=Münster, Sebastian[/tpl] He had long harbored an interest in the Lutherans, and during the German Peasants' War, as a monk, he had been repeatedly attacked. A professor of Hebrew, and a disciple of Elias Levita, he edited the Hebrew Bible (2 vols. fol., Basel, 1534-1535), accompanied by a Latin translation and a large number of annotations. He was the first German to produce an edition of the Hebrew Bible.[tpl]Cite EB9|wstitle=Münster, Sebastian|volume=17[/tpl]
He published more than one Hebrew grammar, and was the first to prepare a Grammatica Chaldaica (Basel, 1527). His lexicographical labours included a Dictionarium Chaldaicum (1527), and a Dictionarium trilingue for Latin, Greek, and Hebrew in 1530.
He released a Mappa Europae (map of Europe) in 1536. In 1537 he published a Hebrew Gospel of Matthew which he had obtained from Spanish Jews he had converted. In 1540 he published a Latin edition of Ptolemy's Geographia with illustrations. The 1550 edition contains cities, portraits, and costumes. These editions, printed in Germany, are the most valued of the Cosmographias.
His Cosmographia of 1544 was the earliest German description of the world. It had numerous editions in different languages including Latin, French, Italian, English, and even Czech. The Cosmographia was one of the most successful and popular books of the 16th century. It passed through 24 editions in 100 years.[tpl]Cite NIE|wstitle=Münster, Sebastian|year=1905[/tpl] This success was due to the fascinating woodcuts (some by Hans Holbein the Younger, Urs Graf, Hans Rudolph Manuel Deutsch, and David Kandel). It was most important in reviving geography in 16th century Europe. The last German edition was published in 1628, long after his death.
Among his other writings are Horologiographia (a treatise on dialling — constructing sundials, Basel, 1531), Organum Uranicum (a treatise on the planetary motions, 1536), and Rudimenta Mathematica (Basel, 1551).
He died at Basel of the plague in 1552. His tombstone described him as the Ezra and the Strabo of the Germans.
