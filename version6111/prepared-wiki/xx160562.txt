[[Bistonini]]

CATEGORIES: Bistonini

The Bistonini are a tribe of geometer moths in subfamily the Ennominae. As numerous ennomine genera have not yet been assigned to a tribe,See references in Savela (2010) the genus list is preliminary. In addition, the entire tribe is sometimesFollowing Holloway (1994) merged into a much-expanded Boarmiini. In other treatments,See e.g. references in Savela (2010) the Erannini are included in the present group.
They overall resemble the Boarmiini, which are certainly closely related. Bistonini tend to retain more plesiomorphic traits (they are rather basal in the expanded Boarmiini) and contain many species that are very large and hairy by geometer moth standards, somewhat resembling Arctiidae.Young (2008)
