[[Challenger Deep]]

CATEGORIES: Geology of the Pacific Ocean, Landforms of Oceania, Extreme points of Earth

The Challenger Deep is the deepest known point in the Earth's seabed hydrosphere, with a depth of [tpl]convert|10898|to|10916|m|ft|0|abbr=on|lk=on[/tpl] by direct measurement from submersibles, and slightly more by sonar bathymetry (see below). It is in the Pacific Ocean, at the southern end of the Mariana Trench near the Mariana Islands group. The Challenger Deep is a relatively small slot-shaped depression in the bottom of a considerably larger crescent-shaped oceanic trench, which itself is an unusually deep feature in the ocean floor. Its bottom is about [tpl]convert|7|mi|km|disp=flip|abbr=on[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|1|mi|km|disp=flip|abbr=on[/tpl] wide, with gently sloping sides.[tpl]cite web|author=All Things Considered |url=http://www.npr.org/2012/03/09/148317355/film-director-to-travel-to-bottom-of-mariana-trench |title=Diving Back to the Bottom of the Mariana Trench |publisher=NPR |date=9 March 2012 |accessdate=26 March 2012[/tpl] The closest land to the Challenger Deep is Fais Island (one of the outer islands of Yap), [tpl]convert|287|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] southwest, and Guam, [tpl]convert|304|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] to the northeast.

The depression is named after the British Royal Navy survey ship HMS Challenger, whose expedition of 1872–1876 made the first recordings of its depth. According to the August 2011 version of the GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names, the location and depth of the Challenger Deep are [tpl]Coord|11|22.4|N|142|35.5|E[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|10920|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] ±[tpl]convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/undersea_feature_names/#feature_links4|title=IHO-IOC GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names, August 2011 version|date=August 2011|publisher=GEBCO|accessdate=20 March 2012[/tpl]
June 2009 sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the Simrad EM120 (sonar multibeam bathymetry system for 300–11,000 m deep water mapping) aboard the RV Kilo Moana indicated a depth of [tpl]convert|10971|m|ft[/tpl]. The sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection, with a precision of better than 0.2% of water depth; this is an error of about [tpl]convert|22|m|ft[/tpl] at this depth.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UMC/cms/ship-daily-reports/|title=Daily Reports for R/V KILO MOANA June and July 2009|date=4 June 2009|publisher=University of Hawaii Marine Center|accessdate=4 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UMC/cms/kilo-moana/|title=Inventory of Scientific Equipment aboard the R/V KILO MOANA|date=4 June 2009|publisher=University of Hawaii Marine Center|accessdate=4 June 2009[/tpl] Further soundings made by the US Center for Coastal & Ocean Mapping in October 2010 are in agreement with this figure, placing the deepest part of the Challenger Deep at [tpl]convert|10994|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], with an estimated vertical uncertainty of ±[tpl]convert|40|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite news|last= Amos |first= Jonathan |title= Oceans' deepest depth re-measured |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15845550 |date= 7 December 2011 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=7 December 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Armstrong_2011_cruise_report_SU10-02_Marianas.pdf |publisher=NOAA/UNH Joint Hydrographic Center University of New Hampshire |title=Cruise Report - UNH-CCOM/JHC Technical Report 11-002 |first=Andrew A. |last=Armstrong |pages=12 |date=2011-12-22 |accessdate=2012-05-01[/tpl]
Only four descents have ever been achieved. The first descent by any vehicle was by the manned bathyscaphe Trieste in 1960. This was followed by the unmanned ROVs Kaikō in 1995 and Nereus in 2009. In March 2012 a manned solo descent was made by the deep-submergence vehicle Deepsea Challenger.[tpl]cite web |last=Than|first=Ker |title=James Cameron Completes Record-Breaking Mariana Trench Dive|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120325-james-cameron-mariana-trench-challenger-deepest-returns-science-sub/|date=25 March 2012 |publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=25 March 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Broad|first=William J. |title=Filmmaker in Submarine Voyages to Bottom of Sea|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/science/james-camerons-submarine-trip-to-challenger-deep.html|date=25 March 2012 |work=New York Times |accessdate=25 March 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |author=AP Staff |title=James Cameron has reached deepest spot on Earth |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46850002/ns/technology_and_science-science |date=25 March 2012 |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=25 March 2012 [/tpl]
These expeditions measured very similar depths of [tpl]convert|10898|to|10916|m[/tpl].

==History of depth mapping from the surface==

Over the years the search for the point of maximum depth has involved many vessels.[tpl]cite web |last=Nakanishi|first=Masao |title=A precise bathymetric map of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench |url=http://naosite.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10069/25460/1/MGR_Hashimoto.pdf |date=10 April 2011 |publisher=Faculty of Fisheries, Nagasaki University |accessdate=30 March 2012 [/tpl]
The 2009 and 2010 maximal depths were not confirmed by the series of dives Nereus made to the bottom during an expedition in May–June 2009. The direct descent measurements by the four expeditions which have reported from the bottom, have fixed depths in a narrow range from 10,916 m (Trieste) to 10,911 m (Kaikō), to 10,902 m (Nereus) to 10,898 m (Deepsea Challenger) Although an attempt was made to correlate locations, it could not be absolutely certain that Nereus (or the other descents) reached exactly the same points found to be maximally deep by the sonar/echo sounders of previous mapping expeditions, even though one of these echo soundings was made by Nereus mothership.

==Descents==

===Manned descents===

====Trieste====

On 23 January 1960, the Swiss-designed bathyscaphe Trieste, originally built in Italy and acquired by the U.S. Navy, descended to the ocean floor in the trench manned by Jacques Piccard (who co-designed the submersible along with his father, Auguste Piccard) and USN Lieutenant Don Walsh. Their crew compartment was inside a spherical pressure vessel, which was a heavy-duty replacement (of the Italian original) built by Krupp Steel Works of Essen, Germany. Their descent took almost five hours and the two men spent barely twenty minutes on the ocean floor before undertaking the three-hour-and-fifteen-minute ascent. Their early departure from the ocean floor was due to their concern over a crack in the outer window caused by the temperature differences during their descent.http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/1960-dive/ The measured depth at the bottom was measured with a manometer at [tpl]convert|10916|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] ±[tpl]convert|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl].

====Deepsea Challenger====

On 26 March 2012 (local time), Canadian film director James Cameron made a solo manned descent in the DSV Deepsea Challenger to the bottom of the Challenger Deep.[tpl]cite web|last=Prince |first=Rosa |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/guam/9166425/James-Cameron-becomes-first-solo-diver-to-visit-Earths-deepest-point.html |title=James Cameron becomes first solo diver to visit Earth's deepest point |publisher=The Telegraph |date=25 March 2012 |accessdate=26 March 2012[/tpl]
At approximately 05:15 ChST on 26 March (19:15 UTC on 25 March), the descent began.[tpl]cite web |author=National Geographic |title=James Cameron Begins Descent to Ocean's Deepest Point |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120325-james-cameron-mariana-trench-dive-deepest-science-sub-descent/ |date=25 March 2012 |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=25 March 2012 [/tpl]
At 07:52 ChST (21:52 UTC), Deepsea Challenger arrived at the bottom. The descent lasted 2 hours and 36 minutes and the recorded depth was [tpl]convert|10898.4|m|ft[/tpl] when Deepsea Challenger touched down.[tpl]cite web |author=National Geographic |title=James Cameron Now at Ocean's Deepest Point |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120325-james-cameron-mariana-trench-challenger-deep-deepest-science-sub/ |date=25 March 2012 |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=25 March 2012 [/tpl]
Cameron planned to spend about six hours near the ocean floor exploring but, due to a hydraulic fluid leak in the lines controlling the manipulator arm which obscured the visibility out the only viewing port in the DSV and caused the loss of the submersible's starboard thrusters,[tpl]cite web |author=National Geographic |title=Cameron's Historic Dive Cut Short by Leak; Few Signs of Life Seen |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120326-james-cameron-mariana-trench-fluid-leak-fish-science-sub/ |date=28 March 2012 |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=28 March 2012 [/tpl] decided to start the ascent to the surface after 2 hours and 34 minutes exploring the ocean floor.[tpl]cite web |author=National Geographic |title=Cameron's Historic Dive Cut Short by Leak; Few Signs of Life Seen |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120326-james-cameron-mariana-trench-fluid-leak-fish-science-sub/ |date=26 March 2012 |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=26 March 2012 [/tpl]

During a post-dive press conference Cameron said: "I landed on a very soft, almost gelatinous flat plain. Once I got my bearings, I drove across it for quite a distance ... and finally worked my way up the slope." The whole time, Cameron said, he didn't see any fish, or any living creatures more than an inch (2.5 cm) long: "The only free swimmers I saw were small amphipods"—shrimplike bottom-feeders.[tpl]cite web |author=National Geographic |title=James Cameron on Earth's Deepest Spot: Desolate, Lunar-Like |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120326-james-cameron-mariana-trench-challenger-deepest-lunar-sub-science/ |date=27 March 2012 |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=27 March 2012 [/tpl]

====Planned manned descents====

Several other manned expeditions are planned. These include:[tpl]cite web |publisher= BBC News |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17041435 |title= Race to the bottom of the ocean |date= 22 February 2012 |accessdate=22 March 2012 [/tpl]

===Unmanned descents===

====Kaikō====

On 24 March 1995, the Japanese robotic deep-sea probe Kaikō broke the depth record for unmanned probes when it reached close to the surveyed bottom of the Challenger Deep. Created by the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center (JAMSTEC), it was one of the few unmanned deep-sea probes in operation that could dive deeper than [tpl]convert|6000|m[/tpl]. The manometer measured depth of [tpl]convert|10911|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] ±[tpl]convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at [tpl]Coord|11|22.39|N|142|35.54|E[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jamstec.go.jp/e/about/equipment/ships/kaiko7000.html |title=Kaiko 7000II |publisher=Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology |accessdate=26 March 2012[/tpl] for the Challenger Deep is believed to be the most accurate measurement taken yet. Kaikō also collected sediment cores containing marine organisms from the bottom of the deep. Kaikō made many unmanned descents to the Mariana Trench during three expeditions in 1995, 1996 and 1998.Revisiting the Challenger Deep using the ROV Kaiko The greatest depth measured by Kaikō in 1996 was [tpl]convert|10898|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at [tpl]Coord|11|22.10|N|142|25.85|E[/tpl] and in 1998 [tpl]convert|10907|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at [tpl]Coord|11|22.95|N|142|12.42|E[/tpl].

====Nereus====

On 31 May 2009 the United States sent the Nereus hybrid remotely operated vehicle (HROV) to the Challenger Deep.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8080324.stm|title=Robot sub reaches deepest ocean|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=3 June 2009|publisher=BBC News[/tpl] Nereus thus became the first vehicle to reach the Mariana Trench since 1998 and the deepest-diving vehicle currently in operation. Project manager and developer Andy Bowen heralded the achievement as "the start of a new era in ocean exploration". Nereus, unlike Kaikō, did not need to be powered or controlled by a cable connected to a ship on the ocean surface.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news163167519.html|title='Nereus' reaches deepest part of the ocean|date=2 June 2009|accessdate=2 June 2009|publisher=physorg.com[/tpl]
Nereus spent over 10 hours at the bottom of the Challenger Deep and measured a depth of [tpl]convert|10902|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at [tpl]Coord|11|22.1|N|142|35.4|E[/tpl], while sending live video and data back to its mothership RV Kilo Moana at the surface and collecting geological and biological samples from the Challenger Deep bottom with its manipulator arm for further scientific analysis.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UMC/cms/ship-daily-reports/|title=Daily Reports for R/V KILO MOANA|date=4 June 2009|publisher=University of Hawaii Marine Center|accessdate=4 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UMC/cms/ship-daily-reports/|title=Daily Reports for R/V KILO MOANA April and May 2009|date=31 May 2009|publisher=University of Hawaii Marine Center|accessdate=31 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=7545&tid=282&cid=57586&ct=162 |title=Hybrid Remotely Operated Vehicle "Nereus" Reaches Deepest Part of the Ocean|date=2 June 2009|publisher= Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|accessdate=2 June 2009[/tpl]

On their 1960 descent, the crew of the Trieste noted that the floor consisted of diatomaceous ooze and reported observing "some type of flatfish" lying on the seabed."To the bottom of the sea", T. A. Heppenheimer, AmericanHeritage.com
Many marine biologists are now skeptical of this supposed sighting, and it is suggested that the creature may instead have been a sea cucumber."James Cameron dives deep for Avatar", Guardian, 18 January 2011"James Cameron heads into the abyss", Nature, 19 March 2012 The video camera on board the Kaiko probe spotted a sea cucumber, a scale worm and a shrimp at the bottom."Mission to Marianas", New Scientist, 2 November 1996"The last frontier", Time, 14 August 1995 At the bottom of the Challenger deep, the Nereus probe spotted one polychaete worm (a multi-legged predator) about an inch long.Accessed 8 Oct 2009 Geography of the ocean floor near Guam with some notes on exploration of the Challenger Deep.
An analysis of the sediment samples collected by Kaiko found large numbers of simple organisms at [tpl]convert|10900|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]Cite journal|last=Todo |first=Yuko |author2=et al. |year=2005 |title=Simple Foraminifera Flourish at the Ocean's Deepest Point |journal=Science |volume=307 |issue=5710 |page=689 |doi=10.1126/science.1105407 |url= |quote= |pmid=15692042 [/tpl] While similar lifeforms have been known to exist in shallower ocean trenches (> 7,000 m) and on the abyssal plain, the lifeforms discovered in the Challenger Deep possibly represent taxa distinct from those in shallower ecosystems.
Most of the organisms collected were simple, soft-shelled foraminifera (432 species according to National Geographic[tpl]Cite news|first=John |last=Roach |title=Life Is Found Thriving at Ocean's Deepest Point |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0203_050203_deepest.html |work=National Geographic News |date=3 February 2005 [/tpl]), with four of the others representing species of the complex, multi-chambered genera Leptohalysis and Reophax. Eighty-five percent of the specimens were organic, soft-shelled allogromiids, which is unusual compared to samples of sediment-dwelling organisms from other deep-sea environments, where the percentage of organic-walled foraminifera ranges from 5% to 20%. As small organisms with hard, calcareous shells have trouble growing at extreme depths because of the high solubility of calcium carbonate in the pressurized water, scientists theorize that the preponderance of soft-shelled organisms in the Challenger Deep may have resulted from the typical biosphere present when the Challenger Deep was shallower than it is now. Over the course of six to nine million years, as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment died out or were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] The species that survived the change in depth were the ancestors of the Challenger Deep's current denizens.[tpl]citation needed|date = January 2012[/tpl]
