[[Human rights in Asia]]

CATEGORIES: Human rights by region

Human rights in Asia primarily rely on the protection and championing by states, non-governmental organizations, and individuals. Many countries in Asia are very backward in this aspect of public policy. It is believed to be a result of countries gaining independence from Colonial powers, rampant corruption within the governments or even resistance to change by the general populace. Unlike Europe and the Americas, most countries in Asia do not have an intergovernmental convention on human rights and have not signed any United Nations HR agreements.
Over the past few decades, the situation has generally improved, with progress varying significantly from not just country to country, but also between different areas of particular country. Bulk of Asias population is concentrated in China, India and the Middle East.http://esa.un.org/wpp/Documentation/publications.htm This is where many of the Human Rights violations take place.
