KREO AM, Indio, Calif.  No references to this as yet, only childhood memories from having grown up in the Coachella Valley (Indio, California) in the 1950s and '60s.  At that time there was a small AM station on the outskirts of Indio with the KREO call letters broadcasting on either 1300 or 1400.  For the local citrus growers during the winter when it sometimes got down below freezing at night, a weatherman by the name of Dale Harris would forecast the temperature and duration that might harm the local orchards of grapefruit and tangerines.  In the very early hours of Saturday morning they played great Mexican mariachi music.  In the very early hours of Sunday morning they broadcast the sermon and gospel music from Lily of the Valley Holy Sanctified Church of God in Christ, and the Assembly of God church which was located right next door to the station. Two local singers from there Ruth Marshall Green and Connie Vick Marshall (who also played the guitar) entertained the audience by singing Christian songs. The only exposure the Valley got to this type of music in that era.
