Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is a therapeutic approach to treating medical conditions and their associated symptoms via the use of a specifically tailored diet devised and monitored by a registered dietitian. The diet is based upon the patient's medical and psychosocial history, physical examination, functional examination and dietary history.
The role of MNT when administered by a dietitian is to reduce the risk of developing complications in pre-existing conditions such as diabetes as well as ameliorate the effects any existing conditions such as high cholesterol.
A nutritional therapy practitioner or clinical nutritionist combines the bio-chemical individuality of each client with a nutrient dense, properly prepared whole food diet and nutritional supplementation in order to return the client to a state of optimal health. They strive to treat the body as a whole - addressing the causes of problems, not just the symptoms
Many medical conditions either develop or are made worse by an improper or unhealthy diet.Sikand G, Kashyap ML, Yang I Medical nutrition therapy lowers serum cholesterol and saves medication costs in men with hypercholesterolemia.J Am Diet Assoc. 1998 Aug;98(8):889-94; quiz 895-6.PMID 9710659Copperman N, Jacobson MS.Medical nutrition therapy of overweight adolescents.
