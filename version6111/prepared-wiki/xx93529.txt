[[San Martin Txiki]]

CATEGORIES: Basque mythology, Trickster gods

San Martin Txiki ("Little Saint Martin") is the Trickster figure from Basque mythology. "Txiki" (pronounced "cheeky") means "little" in an affectionate sense. San Martin is often called simply "Martintxiki" or "Samartitxiki". He stole the secrets of planting, sowing, and harvesting from the Basajaunak (lords of the woods). He also invented the first saws, modeling them after the edges of the chestnut leaf.
San Martin Txiki also exists in Aragonese mythology in the valleys of Tena, Ans√≥ and Broto (places where local toponimia derives from basque) under the name San Martinico.
