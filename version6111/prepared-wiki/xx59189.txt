==History==

Until 1885 the laws of rugby football were made by England as the founder nation. However, following a disputed try in an international between Scotland and England in 1884, letters were exchanged in which England claimed that they made the laws, and the try should stand. Scotland refused to play England in the 1885 Home Nations Championship. Following the dispute, the home unions of Scotland, Ireland and Wales decided to form an international union whose membership would agree on the standard rules of rugby football. The three nations met in Dublin in 1886, though no formal regulations were agreed upon. On 5 December 1887, committee members of the Irish Rugby Union, Scottish Rugby Union and Welsh Rugby Union met in Manchester and wrote up the first four principles of the International Rugby Football Board. England refused to take part in the founding of the IRFB, stating that they should have greater representation, as they had more clubs.[tpl]cite web | work=Rugby Football History |title = 1880s |url= http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/timeline1880s.htm| accessdate=15 July 2006 [/tpl] The England Union also refused to accept the IRFB as the recognised law maker of the game. This led to the IRFB taking the stance of member countries not playing England until they joined, and no games were played against England in 1888 and 1889.[tpl]cite web |title=History of the laws of rugby football |url= http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/laws.htm |work=Rugby Football History |accessdate=22 October 2011 [/tpl] In 1890 England joined the IRFB, gaining six seats while the other unions had two each. The same year, the IRFB wrote the first international laws of rugby union.[tpl]cite web | work=rugby.com.au |title = History of the Game |url= http://www.rugby.com.au/community_rugby/what_is_rugby/history_of_the_game,24.html |accessdate=15 July 2006 [/tpl]
In 1893, the IRFB was faced with the divide between amateurism and professionalism, which was nicknamed the "Great Schism". Following the introduction of working class men to the game in Northern England, clubs began paying "broken time" payments to players, due to the loss of earnings from playing on a Saturday.[tpl]cite web | work=rugbyfootballhistory.com |title =1890s |url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/timeline1890s.htm| accessdate=15 July 2006 [/tpl] Cumberland County Union also complained of another club using monetary incentives to lure players, leading to the IRFB conducting an enquiry. The IRFB was warned by all the chief clubs in Lancashire and Yorkshire that any punishment would lead to the clubs seceding from the union. The debate of broken time payments ultimately led to the 22 leading clubs in Yorkshire and Lancashire to form the Northern Rugby Football Union, a sport today known as rugby league football.
England's seats on the IRFB were reduced from six to four in 1911. The Australian Rugby Union, New Zealand Rugby Football Union and South African Rugby Board joined the board with one seat each in 1948, with England's seats being reduced to two, the same as the other home nations. The three Southern Hemisphere unions were given a second seat each in 1958.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uv.es/EBRIT/macro/macro_5005_99_96.html |title=Major team and individual sports |work=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=22 October 2011[/tpl] The French Rugby Federation was admitted in 1978 and the Argentine Rugby Union, Canadian Rugby Union, Italian Rugby Federation and Japan Rugby Football Union were admitted in 1991.
It is thought that in the late 1950s the IRFB was presented with the ideas of a world championship.[tpl]cite web | publisher=worldcupweb.com | title=The History of RWC |url=http://www.worldcupweb.com/WCrugby/history.asp| accessdate=28 July 2006 [/tpl] In 1983 the New Zealand Rugby Football Union and Australian Rugby Union each proposed hosting such a tournament. The following year the board committed to conduct a feasibility study. A year later there was another meeting in Paris, and the Union subsequently voted on the idea. It was the South African Rugby Board's vote that proved to be crucial in setting up a tied vote, as they voted in favour, even though they knew they would be excluded. English and Welsh votes were then changed, and the vote was won 10 to 6.
