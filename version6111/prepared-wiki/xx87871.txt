The Siuslaw River ([tpl]IPAc-en|s|aɪ|ˈ|juː|s|l|ɔː[/tpl] [tpl]respell|sy|YEW|slaw[/tpl]) is a river, approximately 110 mi (177 km) long, along the Pacific coast of Oregon in the United States. It drains an area of approximately [tpl]convert|773|mi2|km2[/tpl] in the Central Oregon Coast Range southwest of the Willamette Valley and north of the watershed of the Umpqua River.
It rises in the mountains of southwestern Lane County, about [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] west of Cottage Grove.[tpl]cite book|title=Oregon Atlas & Gazetteer|year=1991|publisher=DeLorme Mapping|pages=32, 40–41, 46|location=Freeport, Maine|isbn=0-89933-235-8[/tpl] It flows generally west-northwest through the mountains, past Swisshome, entering the Pacific at Florence. The head of tide is [tpl]convert|26|mi|km[/tpl] upstream.[tpl]cite web|title=Maintenance Dredging for the Siuslaw River Coastal Navigation Project (Draft Environmental Assessment)|url=http://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/environment/docs/Siuslaw_Draft_EA23-Apr-10.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers|date= April 2010|page= 9|accessdate=October 19, 2011[/tpl]
The valley of the river has been historically one of the productive timber regions in Oregon. The lower course of the river passes through Siuslaw National Forest.
The Coos Bay branch of the Central Oregon and Pacific Railroad crosses many bridges as it follows the narrow, winding valley of the Siuslaw River to the swing bridge at Cushman.
The river has historically been a spawning ground for Chinook and Coho salmon. Although the Chinook population is substantial, Coho numbers have declined from an annual average of 209,000 fish between 1889 and 1896 to just over 3,000 fish between 1990 and 1995. The estuary of the river is surrounded by extensive wetlands that are a significant habitat for migratory birds along the coast.[tpl]cite journal|title=Bringing Back the Tides to Estuary Wetlands|journal=Currents |publisher=McKenzie River Trust|issue=Winter/Spring |year=2011|page=1|url=http://mckenzieriver.org/press-and-news/currents-winter-spring-2011|accessdate=October 19, 2011[/tpl] It is one of the very few Western Oregon rivers where all major forks are undammed.[tpl]cite web|title=A Watershed Assessment for the Siuslaw Basin|url=http://www.inforain.org/siuslaw/|publisher=Ecotrust|year=2002|accessdate=October 19, 2011[/tpl]
