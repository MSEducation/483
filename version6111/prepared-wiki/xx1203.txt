Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi ([tpl]IPA-it|ˈklaudjo monteˈverdi|lang[/tpl]; 15 May 1567 (baptized) – 29 November 1643) was an Italian composer, gambist, singer and Roman Catholic priest.
Monteverdi's work, often regarded as revolutionary, marked the transition from the Renaissance style of music to that of the Baroque period.Halsey, William D., ed. Collier's Encyclopedia. Vol. 16. New York:  MacMillan Educational Company, 1991.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] He developed two individual styles of composition – the heritage of Renaissance polyphony and the new basso continuo technique of the Baroque.Ringer, Mark. Opera's First Master:  The Musical Dramas of Claudio Monteverdi. Canada:  Amadeus Press, 2006.[tpl]Page needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] Monteverdi wrote one of the earliest operas, L'Orfeo, an innovative work that is the earliest surviving opera that is still regularly performed. He was recognized as an innovative composer and enjoyed considerable fame in his lifetime.

==Life==

Claudio Monteverdi was born in 1567 in Cremona, Lombardy. His father was Baldassare Monteverdi, a doctor, apothecary and amateur surgeon.Halsey, William D., ed. Collier's Encyclopedia. Vol. 16 New York:  MacMillan Educational Company, 1991. He was the oldest of five children.Redlich, H. F. Claudio Monteverdi: Life and Work. London:  Oxford University Press, 1952, [tpl]Page needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]. During his childhood, he was taught by Marc'Antonio Ingegneri,Redlich, H. F. Claudio Monteverdi:  Life and Work. London:  Oxford University Press, 1952. the maestro di cappella at the Cathedral of Cremona.Schrade, Leo. Monteverdi:  Creator of Modern Music. New York:  W. W. Norton & Company, 1950, [tpl]Page needed|date=February 2009[/tpl]. The Maestro’s job was to conduct important worship services in accordance with the liturgy of the Catholic Church.Whenham, John, ed. The Cambridge Companion to Monteverdi. Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 2007, [tpl]Page needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]. Monteverdi learned about music as a member of the cathedral choir.Schrade, Leo. Monteverdi:  Creator of Modern Music. New York:  W. W. Norton & Company, 1950, [tpl]Page needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]. He also studied at the University of Cremona.  His first music was written for publication, including some motets and sacred madrigals, in 1582 and 1583. His first five publications were: Sacrae cantiunculae, 1582 (a collection of miniature motets); Madrigali Spirituali, 1583 (a volume of which only the bass partbook is extant); Canzonette a tre voci, 1584 (a collection of three-voice canzonettes); and the five-part madrigals Book I, 1587, and Book II, 1590. Monteverdi worked for the court of Mantua first as a singer and violist, then as music director.Roger Kamien, An Appreciation of Music, 4th brief edition. Boston:  McGraw-Hill, 2002, [tpl]Page needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]. He worked at the court of Vincenzo I of Gonzaga in Mantua as a vocalist and viol player.Cayne, Bernard S., ed. Encyclopedia Americana Deluxe Library Edition. Vol. 19. Danbury:  Grolier Incorporated, 1990. In 1602, he was working as the court conductor.
In 1599 Monteverdi married the court singer Claudia Cattaneo,Whenham, John, and Richard Wistreich, eds. The Cambridge Companion to Monteverdi. Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 2007. who died in September 1607.Whenham, John, and Richard Wistreich, eds. The Cambridge Companion to Monteverdi. Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 2007, 66. They had two sons (Francesco and Massimilino) and a daughter (Leonora). Another daughter died shortly after birth.Ringer, Mark. Opera's First Master:  The Musical Dramas of Claudio Monteverdi. Canada:  Amadeus Press, 2006, [tpl]Page needed|date=December 2008[/tpl].
By 1613, he had moved to San Marco in Venice where, as conductor,Redlich, H. F. Claudio Monteverdi:  Life and Work. London:  Oxford University Press, 1952, [tpl]Page needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]. he quickly restored the musical standard of both the choir and the instrumentalists. The musical standard had declined due to the financial mismanagement of his predecessor, Giulio Cesare Martinengo. The managers of the basilica were relieved to have such a distinguished musician in charge, as the music had been declining since the death of Giovanni Croce in 1609.
In 1632, he became a priest.Marthaler, Benard L., ed. New Catholic Encyclopedia 2nd ed. Detroit:  Thomson Gale, 2003[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]. During the last years of his life, when he was often ill, he composed his two last masterpieces: Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (The Return of Ulysses, 1641), and the historic opera L'incoronazione di Poppea (The Coronation of Poppea, 1642), based on the life of the Roman emperor Nero.Sadie, Stanley, ed. The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians 2nd ed. London:  MacMillan Publishers Limited, 2001.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] L'incoronazione especially is considered a culminating point of Monteverdi's work. It contains tragic, romantic, and comic scenes (a new development in opera), a more realistic portrayal of the characters, and warmer melodies than previously heard.Arnold, Denis, and Nigel Fortune, eds. The New Monteverdi Companion. London:  faber and faber, 1985, [tpl]Page needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]. It requires a smaller orchestra, and has a less prominent role for the choir. For a long period of time, Monteverdi's operas were merely regarded as a historical or musical interest. Since the 1960s, The Coronation of Poppea has re-entered the repertoire of major opera companies worldwide.
Monteverdi died, aged 76, in Venice on 29 November 1643 and was buried at the church of the Frari.Halsey, William D., ed. Collier's Encyclopedia. Vol. 16.. New York:  MacMillan Educational Company, 1991.

==Works==

Monteverdi's works are split into three categories:  madrigals, operas, and church-music.Redlich, H. F. Claudio Monteverdi:  Life and Work. London:  Oxford University, Press, 1952, [tpl]Page needed|date=December 2008[/tpl].

===Madrigals===

Until the age of forty, Monteverdi worked primarily on madrigals, composing a total of nine books. It took Monteverdi about four years to finish his first book of twenty-one madrigals for five voices.Schrade, Leo. Monteverdi:  Creator of Modern Music. New York:  W. W. Norton & Company, 1950. As a whole, the first eight books of madrigals show the enormous development from Renaissance polyphonic music to the monodic style typical of Baroque music.
The titles of his Madrigal books are:

====The Fifth Madrigal Book====

The Fifth Book of Madrigals shows the shift from the late Renaissance style of music to the early Baroque.Ringer, Mark. Opera's First Master:  The Musical Dramas of Claudio Monteverdi. Canada: Amadeus Press, 2006. The Quinto Libro (Fifth Book), published in 1605, was at the heart of the controversy between Monteverdi and Giovanni Artusi. Artusi attacked the "crudities" and "license" of the modern style of composing, centering his attacks on madrigals (including Cruda Amarilli, composed around 1600) (See Fabbri, Monteverdi, p. 60) from the fourth book.  Monteverdi made his reply in the introduction to the fifth book, with a proposal of the division of musical practice into two streams, which he called prima pratica, and seconda pratica. Prima pratica was described as the previous polyphonic ideal of the sixteenth century, with flowing strict counterpoint, prepared dissonance, and equality of voices. Seconda pratica used much freer counterpoint with an increasing hierarchy of voices, emphasizing soprano and bass. In Prima pratica the harmony controls the words.  In Seconda pratica the words should be in control of the harmonies.  This represented a move towards the new style of monody. The introduction of continuo in many of the madrigals was a further self-consciously modern feature. In addition, the fifth book showed the beginnings of conscious functional tonality.

====The Eighth Madrigal Book====

While in Venice, Monteverdi also finished his sixth (1614), seventh (1619), and eighth (1638) books of madrigals. The eighth is the largest, containing works written over a thirty-year period. Originally the work was to be dedicated to Ferdinand II, but because of his ill health, his son was made king in December 1636. When the work was first published in 1638 Monteverdi rededicated it to the new King Ferdinand III.Denis Arnold and Nigel Fortune, Editors. The New Monteverdi Companion. (Boston: Faber and Faber Ltd., 1985), 233. The eighth book includes the so-called Madrigali dei guerrieri et amorosi (Madrigals of War and Love).
The important preface of Monteverdi’s eighth madrigal book seems to be connected with his seconda pratica. He claims to have invented a new "agitated" style (Genere concitato, later called Stile concitato).
Gerald Drebes: ‘‘Monteverdis „Kontrastprinzip", die Vorrede zu seinem 8. Madrigalbuch und das „Genere concitato".‘‘ In: ‘‘Musiktheorie‘‘, Jg. 6, 1991, S. 29–42 online: http://www.gerald-drebes.de/8.html
The book is divided into sections of War and Love each containing madrigals, a piece in dramatic form (genere rappresentativo), and a ballet. In the Madrigals of War, Monteverdi has organized poetry that describes the pursuits of love through the allegory of war; the hunt for love, and the battle to find love. In the second half of the book, the Madrigals of Love, Monteverdi organized poetry that describes the unhappiness of being in love, unfaithfulness, and ungrateful lovers who feel no shame. In his previous madrigal collections, Monteverdi usually set poetry from one or two poets he was in contact with through the court where he was employed. The Madrigals of War and Love represent an overview of the poets he has dealt with throughout his life; the classical poetry of Petrarch, poetry by his contemporaries (Tasso, Guarini, Marino, Rinuccini, Testi and Strozzi), or anonymous poets who Monteverdi found and adapted to his needs.

Madrigals of Love

====The Ninth Madrigal Book====

The ninth book of madrigals, published posthumously in 1651, contains lighter pieces such as canzonettas which were probably composed throughout Monteverdi's lifetime representing both styles.

===Operas===

Monteverdi was often ill during the last years of his life. During this time, he composed his two last masterpieces: Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (The Return of Ulysses, 1640), and the historic opera, L'incoronazione di Poppea (The Coronation of Poppea, 1642),Redlich, H. F. Claudio Monteveri:  Life and Work. London:  Oxford University Press, 1952. based on an episode in the life of the Roman emperor Nero. The libretto for Il ritorno d'Ulisse was written by Giacomo Badoarro and for L'incoronazione di Poppea by Giovanni Busenello.Halsey, William D., ed. Collier's Encyclopedia. Vol. 16. New York:  MacMillan Educational Company 1991.

====L'Orfeo====

Monteverdi composed at least eighteen operas, but only L'Orfeo, Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria, L'incoronazione di Poppea, and the famous aria, Lamento, from his second opera L'Arianna have survived. From monody (with melodic lines, intelligible text and placid accompanying music), it was a logical step for Monteverdi to begin composing opera. In 1607, his first opera, L'Orfeo, premiered in Mantua.  L'Orfeo was not the first opera, but it was the first mature opera, or one that realized all of its potential.Whenham, John. Claudio Monteverdi Orfeo. Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 1986, [tpl]Page needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]. It was normal at that time for composers to create works on demand for special occasions, and this piece was part of the ducal celebrations of carnival. (Monteverdi was later to write for the first opera houses supported by ticket sales which opened in Venice). L'Orfeo has dramatic power and lively orchestration. L'Orfeo is arguably the first example of a composer assigning specific instruments to parts in operas. It is also one of the first large compositions for which the exact instrumentation of the premiere is still known.Whenham, John. Claudio Monteverdi Orfeo. Cambridge:  Cambrdige University Press, 1986, [tpl]Page needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]. The plot is described in vivid musical pictures and the melodies are linear and clear. With this opera, Monteverdi created an entirely new style of music, the dramma per la musica or musical drama.

====L'Arianna====

L'Arianna was the second opera written by Monteverdi. It is one of the most influential and famous specimens of early Baroque opera. It was first performed in Mantua in 1608. Its subject matter was the ancient Greek legend of Ariadne and Theseus. Italian composer Ottorino Respighi famously orchestrated the "Lamento di Arianna" in 1908, and the work was premiered by the Berlin Philharmonic the same year under conductor Arthur Nikisch.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] The manuscript was restored and published as a critical edition in 2013 by Italian composer/conductor Salvatore Di Vittorio under publisher Edizioni Panastudio. A later completion of the "Lamento" from L'Arianna by Scottish composer Gareth Wilson (b. 1976) was performed at King's College, London University on 29 November 2013, the 370th anniversary of Monteverdi's death.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

===Sacred music===

====Vespro della Beata Vergine====

Monteverdi's first church music publication was the archaic Mass In illo tempore to which the Vesper Psalms of 1610 were added.  The Vesper Psalms of 1610 are also one of the best examples of early repetition and contrast, with many of the parts having a clear ritornello. The published work is on a very grand scale and there has been some controversy as to whether all the movements were intended to be performed in a single service. However, there are various indications of internal unity. In its scope, it foreshadows such summits of Baroque music as Handel's Messiah, and J.S. Bach's St Matthew Passion. Each part (there are twenty-five in total) is fully developed in both a musical and dramatic sense – the instrumental textures are used to precise dramatic and emotional effect, in a way that had not been seen before.

===Other works===

===Sacred contrafacta===

In 1607, Aquilino Coppini published in Milan his "Musica tolta da i Madrigali di Claudio Monteverde, e d'altri autori ... e fatta spirituale" for 5 and 6 voices, in which many of Monteverdi's madrigals (especially from the third, fourth and fifth books) are presented with the original secular texts replaced with sacred Latin contrafacta carefully prepared by Coppini in order to fit the music in every aspect.
