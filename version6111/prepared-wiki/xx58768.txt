Cape Juby ([tpl]Lang-ar|رأس جوبي[/tpl], trans. Ra's Juby, [tpl]lang-es|Cabo Juby[/tpl]) is a cape on the coast of southern Morocco, near the border with Western Sahara, directly east of the Canary Islands.
Its surrounding area, called Cape Juby Strip or Tarfaya Strip, while making up presently the far South of Morocco, is in a way a semi-desertic buffer zone between Morocco proper and the Western Sahara, and was under Spanish rule in the first half of the 20th century.

==Modern history==

===Precolonial era===

On May 28, 1767, Mohammed ben Abdallah (Sultan of Morocco) signed a peace and commerce treaty with the Spanish King Charles III, in which he does not guarantee the security of Spanish fishermen in the coasts south of the river Nun, as he recognized he does not have control over the Tekna tribes of that lands (Art. 18)[tpl]cite web | title = Proyecto Ibn Jaldun.

On March 1, 1799, Slimane of Morocco signed an accord with Charles IV, in which he recognized that the Saguia el Hamra and Cape Juby regions were not part of his dominions (Art. 22).
In 1879, the British North West Africa Company established a trading post named Port Victoria. On March 26, 1888, Moroccan soldiers attacked the post, killing the director of the factory and leaving two workers badly injured.[tpl]cite news | title = Sucesos de Marruecos | url = http://descargas.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/06925179933769228610046/205957_003.pdf | publisher = La Ilustración Española y Americana nº XVIII | page = 307 | author = José Fernández Bromón | date = 1888-05-15 | accessdate = 2010-07-23[/tpl] [tpl]es icon[/tpl] In 1895, the company sold it to the sultan of Morocco.

===Spanish Sahara===

In 1912, Spain negotiated with France (who controlled the affairs of Morocco at the time) for concessions on the southern edge of Morocco.[tpl]citation needed|date = July 2010[/tpl] Francisco Bens officially occupied the Cape Juby region for Spain on July 29, 1916. Although ethnically and historically tied with the Spanish Sahara colony, it was administered by Spain as the southern zone of the Spanish Morocco protectorate.
The Spanish area [tpl]convert|12700|sqmi|km2|abbr=on[/tpl], and had a population of 9,836.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl] Its main town was founded by the Spanish as Villa Bens, now called Tarfaya. Villa Bens was used as a staging post for airmail flights.

===Retrocession to Morocco===

When Morocco became independent in 1956, it asked for the cession of Moroccan areas controlled by Spain.  After some resistance and some fighting during 1957 (the Ifni War), the Cape Juby strip was ceded by the Spanish government to Morocco in 1958.
