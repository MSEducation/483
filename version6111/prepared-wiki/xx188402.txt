==Biography==

Reinholdz was born on 30 June 1980 in Höör. He first picked up the guitar at the age of nine, inspired mainly by Kee Marcello. Later he discovered heavy metal by listening to bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Morbid Angel and Pantera. He then started playing in some local bands with his friends. One of these bands was Widow which released three demos.
Over time, several more musical influences were added to his musical interest. Artists like Sisters of Mercy, Enya, Yngwie Malmsteen, The Cure, Yes, Dream Theater, Genesis, Atheist, Marillion, and some classical music and jazz/fusion influences as well.
In 1998 he recorded two solo-demos which found their way to WAR-music (later reformed as New Hawen Records) boss Bengt "Wez" Wenedikter. Andromeda and Nonexist were then born as Wenedikter offered Reinholdz two record deals in 1999. Some of the riffs from the 1998 demo "Welcome to Forever" were used on Andromeda debutalbum Extension of the Wish and the bandname was lifted from the last track of the demo "A Postcard from Andromeda".
The first Nonexist album Deus Deceptor came out in 2002 and in 2011 he started writing the second Nonexist album From My Cold Dead Hands. It was then recorded in 2011/2012 with Johan Liiva back on vocals, and released by Pivotal Rockordings in November 2012.
