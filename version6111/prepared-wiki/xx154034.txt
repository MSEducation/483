The Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary of Padua ([tpl]lang-it|Basilica Cattedrale di S. Maria Assunta[/tpl], also known as [tpl]lang|it|Duomo di Padova[/tpl]) is a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica in Padua, northern Italy. The cathedral is the see of the Diocese of Padua, and is dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
It is the third edifice built on the same site. The first one was erected after the Edict of Milan in 313 and destroyed by an earthquake on the 3 January 1117. It was rebuilt in Romanesque style: the appearance of the medieval church can be seen in the frescoes by Giusto de' Menabuoi in the annexed Baptistery.
The design of the existing cathedral is sometimes attributed to Michelangelo, but in fact it was the work of Andrea della Valle and Agostino Righetto, with much in common with earlier Paduan churches. Although construction work began on the new Renaissance edifice in 1551, it was only completed in 1754, leaving the fa√ßade unfinished.
