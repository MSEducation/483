==Campus==

The school is composed of three main buildings (titled "A," "B," and "C"), each one being 3 stories tall.  These buildings are where the majority of the academic instructional time is spent.  In addition, there is an administration building, where the offices of the principal, the vice principals, the counselors, the school nurse, and other support staff are located.  The faculty lounge is also located there.  There is an auditorium, for performances put on by the school's various performing arts programs.  There is also a physical education facility, with locker rooms, equipment storage, asphalt areas for basketball, and several grassy field areas for sports. 
The extensive campus has three main drop-off/pick-up areas: The first and most commonly used is in the front of the school. A parking lot is located at the top of the school next to Alliant University, leading down to the PE fields. The final area is a roundabout on Novak Way, which has three entrances to the school, one by C building, one by A building, and on in-between.
The original campus was constructed in 1998 on Cypress Canyon Road in Scripps Ranch.  The original campus was designed for elementary school students; it was much too small and didn't have the capacity for the increasing numbers of older children living in Scripps Ranch.  In late 2005, construction began on the current site off Avenue of Nations, about a mile and half southwest of the original campus.  In 2007 the middle school opened at the new site. The new campus was criticized for its "featureless, fortresslike buildings" and massive retaining wall, and it received an "Onion" from the San Diego Architectural Foundation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20071202/news_mz1h02awards.html|title=Orchids & Onions entwines high roads with low roads|last=Showley|first=Roger|date=December 7, 2007|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=29 October 2013[/tpl] The original campus became the home of Ellen Browning Scripps Elementary, which moved from a previous location.  With the opening of the elementary school, the original campus has fulfilled its original plan.
