Serbia, and in particular the valley of Morava is often described as "the crossroad between the East and the West", which is one of primary reasons for its turbulent history.  The valley is by far the easiest way of land travel from continental Europe to Greece and Asia Minor.

==Coach transport in Serbia==

Travel by bus in Serbia is one of the most popular means of travel as it offers much more attractive costs to traveling Serbs as opposed to flying. Each large city in Serbia has at least multiple competing inter-city bus companies, whereas even very small villages often have their own flagship bus company. Belgrade Bus Station is the station from which the greatest amount of international destinations are served, and it is also the hub of Lasta Beograd.
