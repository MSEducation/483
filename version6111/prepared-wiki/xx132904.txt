Virginia Beach City Public Schools is the branch of the government of the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia responsible for public K-12 education. Like all public school systems in the state, it is legally classified as a school division instead of a school district. Although Virginia school divisions perform the functions of school districts in other U.S. states, they have no independent taxing authority, instead relying on appropriations from their local governments.
The school system is the second largest in Virginia, and among the 50 largest school systems in the United States (based on student enrollment). All of the division's 80+ schools are fully accredited in the Virginia Standards of Learning (SOL).[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.vbschools.com/school_data/sol_scores/accreditation.pdf|format=PDF|title=Virginia Beach City Public Schools: Master Accreditation List|accessdate=2009-02-07|publisher=Virginia Beach City Public Schools|date=2007-09-30[/tpl]
