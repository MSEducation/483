[[Sagmatias]]

CATEGORIES: Oceanic dolphins

Sagmatias is a genus that has been proposed for certain dolphin species that are currently placed in the genus Lagenorhynchus.  Mitochondrial DNA studies have indicated that certain dolphin species within Lagenorhynchus are actually more closely related to dolphins within the genus Cephalorhynchus.  In order to resolve this situation it has been proposed that the affected dolphin species be placed within the genus Sagmatias.[tpl]cite journal|title=Phylogenetic Relationships among the Delphinid Cetaceans Based on Full Cytochrome B Sequences|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119937779/abstract|author=Leduc, R., Perrin, W. & Dizon, E.|date=August 18, 1998|journal=Marine Mammal Science|volume=15|issue=3|pages=619–648|doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.1999.tb00833.x|accessdate=2008-10-05[/tpl]  Affected species are:
In addition, there is evidence that the Hourglass Dolphin (Lagenorhynchus cruciger) should also be placed within the new genus, although the evidence for this species is less conclusive.[tpl]cite book|title=Whales, Dolphins and Other Marine Mammals of the World|author=Shirihai, H. and Jarrett, B.|publisher=Princeton Field Guides|year=2006|pages=207–208|isbn=0-61-12757-2[/tpl]
Under this categorization, Sagmatias, Cephalorhynchus and Lissodelphis form the subfamily Lissodelphininae within the dolphin family, Delphinidae.
