Meloidogyne incognita is a nematode, a type of roundworm, in the family Heteroderidae. It is an important plant parasite classified in parasitology as a root-knot nematode, as it prefers to attack the root of its host plant. 
When M. incognita attacks the roots of plants, it sets up a feeding location, where it deforms the normal root cells and establishes giant cells. The roots become gnarled or nodulated, forming galls, hence the term "root-knot" nematode. 
It is commonly called the "southern root-knot nematode" or the "cotton root-knot nematode". This parasitic roundworm has worldwide distribution and numerous hosts. 
M. incognita has been found to be able to move along shallower temperature gradients (0.001C/cm) than any other known organism,Pline, Diez, and Dusenbery, J. Nematology, 20:605-608 (1988). Extremely sensitive thermotaxis of the nematode Meloidogyne incognita. an example of thermotaxis. The response is complicated and thought to allow the nematodes to move toward an appropriate level in soil,Dusenbery, D.B. Biological Cybernetics, 60:431-437 (1989). A simple animal can use a complex stimulus pattern to find a location, while they search for chemical cues that can guide them to specific roots.Pline and Dusenbery. 1987.
