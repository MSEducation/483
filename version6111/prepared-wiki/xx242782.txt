Kwakéa (or Pakea, or Qakea) is an islet located east of Vanua Lava in the Banks Islands, Vanuatu.
The channel that flows between Kwakea and Vanua Lava is known as Dudley Channel.

==History==

The island was purchased by English settlers, Frank and Alice Whitford, in the mid-1890s from the native title owners from Vanua Lava. The Whitfords created palm plantations before a hurricane wiped out the island on November 25, 1939. The only thing that remains is the Whitford Family Cemetery.
