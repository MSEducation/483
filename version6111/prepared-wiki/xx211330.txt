[[List of FC Bayern Munich seasons]]

CATEGORIES: FC Bayern Munich seasons, FC Bayern Munich-related lists, German football club seasons

This is a list of the seasons played by Bayern Munich from 1905 when the club first entered a league competition to the most recent seasons. The club's achievements in all major national and international competitions as well as the top scorers are listed. Top scorers in bold were also top scorers of Bundesliga. The list is separated into three parts, coinciding with the three major episodes of German football:
Bayern has won the national championship 22 times, once before the inception of the Bundesliga and twenty-one times since. The club also won the DFB-Pokal 15 times, making them the record holder in number of cups and national championships won. Bayern won six international titles, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1967, the UEFA Cup in 1996, the European Cup consecutively three times from 1974 to 1976, and the Champions League in 2001. They are the last club to have won the European Cup three times in a row.
The club has been relegated just once in 1955, but was promoted back to 1st division football the following season. Bayern was not appointed a spot in the Bundesliga at its inception and thus played two additional seasons in the 2nd division from 1963 to 1965.
