The Battle of Krusi ([tpl]lang-sr|Битка на Крусима[/tpl]) took place in 1796 between Old Montenegro and the Pashalik of Scutari  near Krusi. Following his defeat in Martinići (see Battle of Martinići), Mahmut-pasha Bushatli the Albanian Vizier of Shkoder began compiling new plans to attack Montenegro. With his main army in Scutari, Bushatli advanced to Podgorica, in the meantime, near the Montenegrin borders, a rather large number of forces were stationed due to the concentration of attacks towards Montenegro and Brda[tpl]dn|date=April 2014[/tpl]. From Podgorica, the Albanians move onto Lješkopolje because Bushatli's goal was to use the Lješkopolje-Krusi-Carev laz-Rijeka Crnojevića to his advantage to carry out a raid toward Cetinje.
Peter I, Prince-Bishop of Montenegro, was informed of the Albanian plans and had organized defenses beforehand. He then took control of the majority of the his forces and set-up an encampment beneath Mount Sađavce, on the right hand bank of the Matica River. Another, larger, unit, under the command of Jovan Radonjić was beset under Mount Busovnika near the village of Krusi.
The battle occurred on 22 September 1796 when Bushatli ordered his troops to cross the right hand bank of the Sitnica River and attack Montenegrin positions. Krusi was directly in the path of the Turkish army. Intensive fighting would occur when the Albanians met with the Montenegrins. After a whole day of fighting, the Montenegrins were able to defeat the Turks. Bushatli was killed by the Montenegrin army during the battle. Legend has it that it was truly Bogdan Vukov Nikolic from Zalazi* who managed to kill Bushatli. The remains of the broken Turkish army were forced to withdraw to Podgorica.
