Liberal Judaism ([tpl]Lang-he|היהדות הליברלית[/tpl]) is one of the two forms of Progressive Judaism found in the United Kingdom, the other being Reform Judaism.  Liberal Judaism, which developed at the beginning of the twentieth century is less conservative than UK Reform Judaism. Liberal Judaism considers itself the sister movement of North American Reform Judaism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shef-ref.co.uk/html/body_links.html |title=Links |publisher=Shef-ref.co.uk |date=25 February 2007 |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl]

==Origins==

The Liberal movement in the UK was founded in the early part of the 20th century by Lily Montagu, Claude Montefiore and others as the Jewish Religious Union (JRU).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewisheastend.com/lily.html |title=Jewish East End of London – Miss Lily Montagu |publisher=Jewisheastend.com |date= |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] It began on 18 October 1902 with a supplementary prayer meeting, an adjunct to the then Orthodox and Reform synagogues, with the intention of using more English in services, men and women sitting freely together, the use of organ music, and a more inclusive form of worship which would prove attractive to members of British Jewry who felt uninvolved or out of sympathy with existing traditionalist patterns of worship.[tpl]cite web|author=Ellen M.

===Key figures===

Key figures in the history and development of Liberal Judaism include:

==Organisations==

The JRU did not originally intend to be a separate denomination, but rather wished to encourage synagogues affiliated with the JRU to develop a form of authentic Judaism that was responsive to changes going on in the modern world, without going down the path of classical German Reform.[tpl]cite web|author=Minisis Inc |url= http://search.lma.gov.uk/scripts/mwimain.dll/144/LMA_OPAC/web_detail/REFD+ACC~2F3529?SESSIONSEARCH |title=London Metropolitan Archives - Item Details |publisher=Search.lma.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] Many of its members were inspired by Claude Montefiore's 1903 book Liberal Judaism – An Essay.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ovguide.com/union-of-liberal-and-progressive-synagogues-9202a8c04000641f800000000090c62d |title=Watch Union Of Liberal And Progressive Synagogues Video |publisher=Ovguide.com |date= |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] In 1909 the JRU changed its name to the Jewish Religious Union for the Advancement of Liberal Judaism.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=M12toEjI5PEC&pg=PA220&lpg=PA220&dq=In+1909+the+JRU+changed+its+name+to+the+%27%27Jewish+Religious+Union+for+the+Advancement+of+Liberal+Judaism%27%27&source=bl&ots=z88G_tQUXL&sig=-Q0ZIVJLC1NDuqYF5GUeDW5JnRA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=j3OwUe3pMqnL0QWGyYD4CA&ved=0CEcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=In%201909%20the%20JRU%20changed%20its%20name%20to%20the%20%27%27Jewish%20Religious%20Union%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Liberal%20Judaism%27%27&f=false |title=Response to Modernity: A History of the Reform Movement in Judaism |author= Michael A.

==Beliefs and practices==

The beliefs of Liberal Judaism are outlined in The Affirmations of Liberal Judaism. Originally written by Rabbi John D. Rayner, the Affirmations detail the movement's common ground with other forms of Judaism, as well as establishing the ideals that differentiate it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pjcea.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=56:the-affirmations-of-liberal-judaism&catid=47:overview&Itemid=11 |title=The Affirmations of Liberal Judaism |publisher=Pjcea.org.uk |date=10 June 2009 |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] Affirmation 23, which lays out the movement's progressive ideals, states "Judaism has never stood still. It has always moved forward, sometimes slowly, sometimes faster. Its history is a history of continuity and change. We affirm the dynamic, developing character of our Jewish religious tradition."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bwpjc.org/LJ_affirmations.htm |title=Affirmations |publisher=bwpjc.org |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] This view represents the idea that divine laws were not something that happened at one specific moment on Mt. Sinai, but rather as an evolving ideal representing Judaism's historic development through each succeeding generation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/10-Reform/ |title=soc.culture.jewish FAQ: Reform Judaism (10/12) |publisher=Faqs.org |date= |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl]
To quote the movement's website, "Liberal Judaism reverences Jewish tradition, and seeks to preserve the values of the Judaism of the past while giving them contemporary force. It aspires to a Judaism that is always an active force for good in the lives of Jewish individuals, families and communities today, and equally makes its contribution to the betterment of society."[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.liberaljudaism.org/ |title=Welcome to Liberal Judaism |publisher=Liberal Judaism|date= |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] And it stresses "the full equality and participation of men and women in every sphere of religious life; an emphasis on ethical conduct above ritual observance; an affirmation of each individual's freedom to act responsibly in accordance with the dictates of the informed religious conscience; a pride in combining our Jewish heritage with full participation in the civic life of this country; and an awareness of our duty not only to the Jewish people and to the State of Israel, but also to the entire human family, each one of whom is created in the Divine image".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liberaljudaism.org/about-us/what-is-liberal-judaism.html |title=What is Liberal Judaism? |publisher=Liberal Judaism |date= |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl]
The movement's chairman, Lucian Hudson announced in 2013 that Liberal Judaism is currently producing a strategic plan for the next decade. The new document will be brief, only including key information on Liberal Judaism’s main objectives, priorities, roles and responsibilities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liberaljudaism.org/news/799-your-chance-to-shape-liberal-judaisms-future.html |title=Your chance to shape Liberal Judaism’s future |publisher=Liberal Judaism |date=6 June 2013 |accessdate=15 July 2013[/tpl] Hudson is positioning Liberal Judaism as radical mainstream Judaism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liberaljudaism.org/about-us/55/824-a-radical-mainstream-judaism.html |title=A radical mainstream Judaism |publisher=Liberaljudaism.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30[/tpl]

==Key issues==

Liberal Judaism is distinctly more radical than Reform, aspiring to equality in line with modern values and thinking, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. It seeks to treat children with only one Jewish parent the same, regardless of the parent's gender, and celebrates same sex relationships and marriages equally with those of mixed sex couples.

===Mixed faith relationships===

Liberal Judaism recognises patrilineal as well as matrilineal Jewish descent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://half-jewish.net/who-is-a-jew/ |title=Who Is A Jew; The Half-Jewish Network: Welcoming Adult Children & Grandchildren of Intermarriage |publisher=Half-jewish.net |date= |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] It is also the first synagogue body in the UK to recognise mixed faith partnerships and perform mixed-faith blessings.[tpl]cite web|last=Aaron |first=Rabbi |url= http://www.interfaithfamily.com/life_cycle/weddings/Blessing_Mixed-Faith_Couples_in_the_United_Kingdom.shtml |title=Blessing Mixed-Faith Couples in the United Kingdom |publisher=InterfaithFamily |date= |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] While the liturgy and rituals are not the same as a Jewish wedding, the couple must also participate in a civil ceremony and should be committed to building a Jewish household; rabbis are allowed to participate in blessing mixed faith marriages.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.finchleyprogressivesynagogue.org/mixed-faith-blessing/ |title=Finchley Progressive | Mixed Faith Blessing |publisher= Finchley Progressive Synagogue |date= |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] The movement's official stance is that the non-Jewish partner is being encouraged to "marry in" rather than the Jewish partner "marrying out" of the faith.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.liberaljudaism.org/life-cycle/marriage-civil-partnership.html |title=Marriage/Civil Partnership |publisher=Liberal Judaism |date= |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/comment/107901/we-dont-marry-out-we-are-made |title=We don't 'marry out'.

===Same-sex marriages===

In 2005, Liberal Judaism became the first mainstream religious movement in the UK to publish an official liturgy for same-sex commitment ceremonies.[tpl]cite news|author=Press Association |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/nov/26/religion.gayrights |title=Liberal Judaism creates gay wedding service |work=The Guardian |date= 29 November 2005|accessdate=6 June 2013 |location=London[/tpl] The Brit Ahava (Covenant of Love) ceremony was made available well before civil partnerships for same-sex unions were made available in the UK. In February 2013, Rabbi Danny Rich presented evidence to the House of Commons Public Bill Committee looking into the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, reiterating Liberal Judaism’s stance on the issue, stating, "although Liberal Judaism respects the right of other religious movements to decline to conduct marriages which go against their teachings, and to have this right protected in law, it also seeks, in the name of freedom of religion, the right to conduct marriages which it sees as legitimate, and as an important pastoral service to its members.”[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmpublic/marriage/130212/pm/130212s01.htm |title=House of Commons Public Bill Committee: MARRIAGE (SAME SEX COUPLES) BILL (12 February 2013) |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] In response to the June 2013 House of Lords equal marriage vote, Liberal Judaism’s Rabbi Aaron Goldstein issued a statement, reading in part, "We are now looking forward to celebrating the first fully legal and fully Jewish same sex marriage under a Liberal chuppah.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liberaljudaism.org/news/790-liberals-greet-equal-marriage-vote-with-elation.html |title= Liberal Jews Greet Equal Marriage Vote with Elation |publisher=Liberal Judaism |date=5 June 2013 |accessdate=12 June 2013[/tpl] The movement also welcomes openly gay and lesbian rabbis.[tpl]cite news|author=Emily Wilson |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/nov/30/religion.gayrights?INTCMP=SRCH |title=How gay is too gay? |work=The Guardian |date= 1 December 2005|accessdate=6 June 2013 |location=London[/tpl]

===Position on the JFS case===

In 2009, the case known as R(E) v Governing Body of JFS was brought before the High Court where a 12-year-old boy, known as M, was refused entry to the Jewish Free School (JFS) because, while his father was born a Jew and both his father and mother actively practised the Jewish faith, the mother had converted to Judaism in a non-Orthodox synagogue, which failed to meet the school's criteria for the child being Jewish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/geoffrey-bindman/race-human-rights-and-religion-uks-jewish-free-school-decision |title=Race, human rights and religion: the UK's Jewish free school decision |publisher=openDemocracy |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] Liberal Judaism was actively vocal in supporting M's case, specifically that JFS, as a state-funded school, had an obligation to be open to all forms of Judaism.[tpl]cite news|author=Sarah Lyall |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/world/europe/08britain.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& |title=Who Is a Jew?

===Israel===

Liberal Judaism's stance on Israel is one of territorial compromise, with the goal of a peaceful two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liberaljudaism.org/images/pdf/leaflets/lj_values_zionism_and_israel.pdf |title=Liberal Jewish Values: Zionism and Israel |publisher=Liberal Judaism |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] Rabbi Danny Rich has been outspoken against Israeli actions in Lebanon, as well as on the views of former Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Avigdor Lieberman, stating that, "Some of his reported views could threaten the stability of an Israel in which the Arab minority can thrive."[tpl]cite news|author= Stephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/aug/05/syria.israelandthepalestinians1?INTCMP=SRCH |title=Beleaguered community torn by a distant war |work=The Guardian |date=5 August 2006 |accessdate=6 June 2013 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/aug/10/avigdor-lieberman?INTCMP=SRCH |title=Comment is free: Legitimising Lieberman?

===Considered engagement===

In 2011, Liberal Judaism adopted a policy it calls "Considered Engagement".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liberaljudaism.org/news/303-chief-executive-announces-policy-of-considered-engagement.html |title=Chief Executive Announces Policy of Considered Engagement |publisher=Liberal Judaism |date=27 July 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] Under this policy, the chief executive, chairman and other national officers review invitations to participate in events based on their goals, even if the hosting organisation is not in accord with the policies of Liberal Judaism.[tpl]cite web|author=Lucian J.

===The confirmation of Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis===

When Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis was named Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth in December 2012, Rabbi Danny Rich issued a statement welcoming the appointment of Mirvis, stressing the need for plurality among the British community, and advising that the hardest part of the job for Mirvis would be recognizing that the position "no longer represents a large section of the community."[tpl]cite web|author=Sam Jones and agencies |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/19/ephraim-mirvis-next-chief-rabbi |title=Ephraim Mirvis has been chosen as the next chief rabbi | World news |publisher=theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-03[/tpl]

===Criticisms of Ralph Miliband in The Daily Mail===

In October 2013, the Religious Education Council of England and Wales published A Curriculum Framework for Religious Education in England, which stated that, "All children need to acquire core knowledge and understanding of the beliefs and practices of the religions and worldviews which not only shape their history and culture but which guide their own development."[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.medway.gov.uk/pdf/REC%20RE%20curric%20framework%20Oct%202013.pdf |title=A Curriculum Framework for Religious Education in England |publisher=The Religious Education Council of England and Wales |date=October 2013 |accessdate=6 January 2014[/tpl] Rich wrote an opinion column in Haaretz in support of the framework, stating that "religious education has never been more important", and calling for comprehensive religious education in bot single-faith and secular schools.[tpl]cite web|author=Rabbi Danny Rich |url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.560055 |title=Why religion belongs in school |publisher=Haaretz |date=2013-11-25 |accessdate=2013-10-22[/tpl]

===The "pickling" of Judaism by the Charedi===

In November 2013, the Board of Deputies of British Jews issued the 2012 statistics report for Britain’s Jewish Community, which noted a "natural increase" in Britain's Jewish population, with specific emphasis on Britain's Charedi (Orthodox) community, who were responsible for four out of every ten Jewish births and more than three in ten weddings.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.bod.org.uk/live/click.php?u=%2Fcontent%2FCommunityStatistics2012.pdf&o=Item%2B198&v=51a8bb |title=Britain’s Jewish Community Statistics 2012 |publisher=The Board of Deputies of British Jews |date=November 2013 |accessdate=6 January 2014[/tpl] In response to these numbers, Rich issued remarks that have generated some controversy, stating that the Orthodox community didn't preserve the Jewish religion, but rather "pickled" it, by refusing to engage with the outside world.[tpl]cite web|author=November 22, 2013 |url=http://jewishnews.co.uk/rabbi-danny-rich-the-pickling-of-our-jewish-faith-is-undermining-its-raison-detre/ |title=Rabbi Danny Rich: the ‘pickling’ of our Jewish faith is undermining its raison d’être |publisher=Jewishnews.co.uk |date=2013-11-22 |accessdate=2014-01-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=November 14, 2013 |url=http://jewishnews.co.uk/liberals-claim-charedim-are-pickling-judaism-by-hiding-away-from-world/ |title=Liberals claim Charedim are ‘pickling’ Judaism by hiding away from world |publisher=Jewishnews.co.uk |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2014-01-06[/tpl]

===The response to Israel's consultation of its diaspora===

In February 2014, the movement issued a policy contribution in response to Israel's consultation of its diaspora on the character of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. In the response, lead by Hudson, Liberal Judaism stated that the Israel which it supports must “play a positive role in the world, sharing the prophetic vision and reflecting Liberal Jewish values," and reaffirmed their support of a two-state solution with a Palestinian state, as well as proposing a “permissive approach to Jewish and non-Jewish immigration.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liberaljudaism.org/news/876-israel-should-value-dissent-and-actively-promote-the-equality-of-minorities-say-liberal-jews.html |title=Israel should "value dissent" and actively promote the "equality of minorities" say Liberal Jews |publisher=Liberaljudaism.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24[/tpl] They also argued that Israel must be more open toward voices of dissent and promoting minority rights, while diaspora communities should provide greater financial investments for Israel’s non-Jewish communities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/115560/communal-leaders-join-israels-global-debate-diaspora |title=Communal leaders join Israel's global debate on diaspora | The Jewish Chronicle |publisher=Thejc.com |date=2014-02-14 |accessdate=2014-02-24[/tpl]
