Art M칩r Mac Murchadha Caomh치nach (anglicized Art MacMurrough-Kavanagh; died 1416/17) is generally regarded as the most formidable of the later Kings of Leinster. 
He revived not only the royal family's prerogatives but their lands and power. 
During the length of his forty-two year reign he fully lived up to his title, dominating the Anglo-Norman settlers of Leinster.

==Life==

His dominance of the province and its inhabitants - both Gaelic and Hiberno-Norman - was deemed sufficiently detrimental to the colony that Richard II spent much of the years 1394-1395 sparring with him. 
While Art did indeed submit to Richard, he renounced this fealty on Richard's departure and made much of his kingdom a death-trap for any invading English or Anglo-Irish forces. 
The Crown accordingly dealt with him cautiously and he was granted an amnesty in 1409.

==Family==

He married Elizabeth Calf, also known as Elizabeth le Veel, heiress of the Anglo-Norman barony of Norragh. Such a racial intermarriage violated the Statutes of Kilkenny and the Crown on this pretext forfeited Elizabeth's lands, one of the causes of her husband's enmity to the English. 
They had three sons -Donnchadh, King of Leinster,  Diarmait and Gerald, Lord of Ferns- but Elizabeth's estates ultimately came to the descendants of her daughter by her first husband, Sir John Staunton of Clane.
