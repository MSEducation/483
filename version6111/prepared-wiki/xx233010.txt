Arnica amplexicaulis is a species of arnica known by the common name clasping arnica. It is native to western North America from Alaska to California and the Sierra Nevada, to the Rocky Mountains and Wyoming, where it grows in moist areas such as mountain meadows and streambanks. 
This is a perennial herb usually growing from a small rhizome and producing one or more hairy, glandular stems. The stems are lined with 5 to 10 pairs of oval-shaped, toothed leaves up to 12 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a cluster of several daisylike flower heads with a center of brownish disc florets and a fringe of yellow ray florets 1 to 2 centimeters long.
