 Another part of Smith's translation portrays the biblical character [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] as stating that if there were "millions of earths like this [earth], it would not be a beginning to the number of [God's] creations; and [his] curtains are stretched out still."
Book of Moses 7:30. Enoch, however, did not refer to inhabitants on those "earths".
Finally, the portion of the LDS Endowment ceremony depicting the creation of the world refers repeatedly to "worlds heretofore created".
