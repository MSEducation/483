The Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) is a museum of world culture and natural history based in Toronto, Ontario. It is one of the largest museums in North America, attracting over one million visitors every year.[tpl]cite web|title=FAQs|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/sites/default/files/imce/newsroom_intro_rom.pdf|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=20 August 2013[/tpl] The museum is located north of Queen's Park in the University of Toronto district, with its main entrance facing Bloor Street.
Established on April 16, 1912 and opened on March 19th, 1914, the museum has maintained close relations with the University of Toronto throughout its history, often sharing expertise and resources.[tpl]cite book |title=The Museum Makers: the Story of the Royal Ontario Museum |last=Dickson |first=Lovat |year=1986 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=0-8020-7441-3[/tpl] The museum was under the direct control and management of the University of Toronto until 1968.  It then became an independent institution.[tpl]cite web|last=Jamie|first=Bradburn|title=Historicist: A Handbook to the Royal Ontario Museum, 1956|url=http://torontoist.com/2011/07/historicist_a_handbook_to_the_royal_ontario_museum_1956/|publisher=Torontoist|accessdate=26 March 2012[/tpl] Today, the museum is Canada's largest field-research institution, with research and conservation activities that span the globe.[tpl]cite web|title=Collections and Research|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/collections/index.php|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=25 March 2012[/tpl]
With more than six million items and forty galleries, the museum's diverse collections of world culture and natural history are part of the reason for its international reputation. The museum contains notable collections of dinosaurs, minerals and meteorites, Near Eastern and African art, Art of East Asia, European history, and Canadian history.  It also houses the world's largest collection of fossils from the Burgess Shale with more than 150,000 specimens.[tpl]cite web|title=Royal Ontario Museum Burgess Shale Expeditions (1975-ongoing)|url=http://burgess-shale.rom.on.ca/en/history/discoveries/05-rom.php|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=25 March 2012[/tpl] The museum also contains an extensive collection of design and fine arts. These include clothing, interior, and product design, especially Art Deco.

==History==

The Royal Ontario Museum was formally established on April 16, 1912, with the signing of the Ontario Legislature’s ROM Act.[tpl]cite web|last=Siddiqui|first=Norman|title=Our History|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/en/about-us/rom/our-history|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=26 September 2013[/tpl] The Government of Ontario and the University of Toronto funded the construction and development of the museum.[tpl]cite web|title=History of the Royal Ontario Museum|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/sites/default/files/imce/newsroom_history.pdf|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=24 March 2012[/tpl] On 19 March 1914, at 3:00 pm, the Duke of Connaught, also the Governor General of Canada, officially opened the Royal Ontario Museum to the public. The museum’s location at the edge of Toronto's built-up area, far from the city's central business district, was selected mainly for its proximity to the University of Toronto. The original building was constructed on the western edge of the property along the university's Philosopher's Walk, with its main entrance facing out onto Bloor Street. This was the first phase of a two-part construction plan that intended on expanding the museum towards Queen's Park Crescent, ultimately creating a H-shaped structure. Many of the museum's artifacts at this time were transferred from its predecessor, the Museum of Natural History and Fine Arts at the Toronto Normal School.For the history of the archaeological and ethnographic collection of the Normal School, later given to the ROM, see Gerald Killan, David Boyle:  From Artisan to Archaeologist, Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1983 and Michelle A Hamilton, Collections and Objections:  Aboriginal Material Culture in Southern Ontario, Montreal:  McGill-Queen's University Press, 2010.
The first expansion to the Royal Ontario Museum publicly opened on 12 October 1933.[tpl]cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/about/history/index.php|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=28 March 2012[/tpl] The renovation saw the construction of the south wing fronting onto Queen's Park, and required the demolition of Argyle House, a Victorian mansion once located at 100 Queen's Park. As this occurred during the Great Depression, an effort was made to primarily use local building materials and workers capable of manually excavating the building's foundations. Teams of workers alternated weeks of service due to the physically draining nature of the job.
On 26 October 1968, the ROM opened the McLaughlin Planetarium on the south-end of the property after receiving a $2 million donation from Colonel R. Samuel McLaughlin.[tpl]cite web|title=ROM History|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/newsroom/pdf/rom_history.pdf|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=28 March 2012[/tpl] By the 1980s, however, the planetarium’s audiences were dwindling, and the facility was forced to shut down in November 1995 due to budget cuts. The space temporarily reopened from 1998 to 2002 after being leased to Children's Own Museum. In 2009, the ROM sold the building to the University of Toronto for $22 million, and ensured that it would continue to be used for institutional, academic purposes.[tpl]cite news|last=O’Brien|first=Chrissie|title=Royal Ontario Museum agrees to sell McLaughlin Planetarium site to University of Toronto|url=http://dailycommercialnews.com/article/id32730|accessdate=28 March 2012|newspaper=Daily Commercial News|date=19 February 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=FAQs|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/about/faqs/faqsgen.php|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=28 March 2012[/tpl]
The second major addition to the museum was the Queen Elizabeth II Terrace Galleries on the north side of the building, and a curatorial centre built on the south, which started in 1978, and was completed in 1984. The new construction meant that a former outdoor "Chinese Garden" to the north of the building facing Bloor, along with an adjoining indoor restaurant, had to be dismantled. Opened in 1984 by Queen Elizabeth II, a $55 million expansion took the form of layered volumes, each rising layer stepping back from Bloor Street, hence creating a layered terrace effect. The design of this expansion won a Governor General's Award in Architecture.Royal Ontario Museum Review[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
In 1989, activists complained about its Into the Heart of Africa exhibit, forcing the curator, Jeanne Cannizzo, to resign.Petersen, Klaus & Allan C. Hutchinson. "Interpreting Censorship in Canada", University of Toronto Press, 1999.
Beginning in 2002, the museum underwent a major renovation and expansion project dubbed as Renaissance ROM. The Provincial and Federal governments, both supporters of this venture, contributed $60 million towards the project.[tpl]cite web|title=Renaissance ROM|url=http://rom.on.ca/support/governors/ren_learn_more.php|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=24 March 2012[/tpl] The campaign aimed to not only raise annual visitor attendance from 750,000 to between 1.3 and 1.6 million, but to generate additional funding opportunities to support the museum's research, conservation, galleries, and educational public programs as well.[tpl]cite web|title=Renaissance ROM Fact Sheet|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/about/newsroom/pdf/renromfacts.pdf|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=25 March 2012[/tpl] The centrepiece of the project, the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal, was a major addition to the building's original framework. The structure was created by architect Daniel Libeskind, whose design was selected from among 50 finalists in an international competition.[tpl]cite web|last=Lostracco|first=Marc|title=Inside The ROM Crystal: A First Look|url=http://torontoist.com/2007/05/inside_the_rom/|publisher=Torontoist|accessdate=25 March 2012[/tpl] The design saw the Terrace Galleries torn down (curatorial centre to the south remains) and replaced with a Deconstructivist crystalline-form structure, named after Michael Lee-Chin who donated $30 million towards its construction. Existing galleries and buildings were also upgraded, along with the installation of multiple new exhibits over a period of months. The first phase of the Renaissance ROM project, the Ten Renovated Galleries in the Historic Buildings, opened to the public on 26 December 2005. The Architectural Opening for the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal, however, took place years later on 2 June 2007.
The final cost of the project was approximately C$270 million.[tpl]cite web|title=Michael Lee-Chin Crystal Facts|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/about/newsroom/pdf/crystalfacts.pdf|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=25 March 2012[/tpl]

==Buildings and architecture==

===Original building and eastern wing===

Designed by Toronto architects Frank Darling and John A. Pearson,Royal Ontario Museum | About Us | Our History[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] the architectural style of the original building is Italianate Neo-Romanesque, popular throughout North America until the 1870s. The structure is heavily massed and punctuated by rounded and segmented arched windows with heavy surrounds and hood mouldings. Other features include applied decorative eave brackets, quoins and cornices.
The eastern wing facing Queen's Park was designed by Alfred H. Chapman and James Oxley. Opened in 1933, it included the museum's elaborate art deco, Byzantine-inspired rotunda and a new main entrance. The linking wing and rear (west) façade of the Queen's Park wing were originally done in the same yellow brick as the 1914 building, with minor Italianate detailing. However, the Queen's Park facade of the expansion broke from the heavy Italianate style of the original structure. It was built in a neo-Byzantine style with rusticated stone, triple windows contained within recessed arches, and different-coloured stone arranged into a variety of patterns. This development from the Roman-inspired Italianate to a Byzantine influenced style reflected the historical development of Byzantine architecture from Roman architecture. Common among neo-Byzantine buildings in North America, the facade also contains elements of Gothic Revival in its relief carvings, gargoyles and statues. The ornate ceiling of the rotunda is covered predominantly in gold back-painted glass mosaic tiles, with coloured mosaic geometric patterns and images of real and mythical animals.
Writing in the Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada in 1933, A. S. Mathers said of the expansion: "The interior of the building is a surprise and a pleasant one; the somewhat complicated ornament of the façade is forgotten and a plan on the grand manner unfolds itself. It is simple, direct and big in scale. One is convinced that the early Beaux Arts training of the designer has not been in vain. The outstanding feature of the interior is the glass mosaic ceiling of the entrance rotunda. It is executed in colours and gold, and strikes a fine note in the one part of the building which the architect could decorate without conflicting with the exhibits."[tpl]cite web|url=http://speeches.empireclub.org/61643/data?n=1 |title=The Museum: Past, Present and Future, by Dr. James E. Cruise |publisher=Speeches.empireclub.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25[/tpl]
The original building and the 1933 expansion have been listed as heritage buildings of Toronto since 1973.Heritage of the ROM, accessed November 10, 2005[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] In 2005, a major renovation of the heritage wings saw the galleries made larger, windows uncovered, and the original early-20th-century architecture made more prominent. The exteriors of the heritage buildings were cleaned and restored. The restoration of the 1914 and 1933 buildings was the largest heritage project underway in Canada. The renovation also included the newly restored Rotunda with reproductions of the original oak doors, a restored axial view from the Rotunda west through to windows onto Philosophers' Walk, and ten renovated galleries comprising a total of [tpl]convert|90000|sqft|m2|sigfig=1[/tpl].ROM Members' News, Winter 2005–6.
In the master plan designed by Darling and Pearson in 1909, the ROM took a form similar to that of J.N.L. Durand's ideal model of the museum (published in the early 19th century). It was envisioned as a square plan with corridors running through the centre of the composition, converging in the middle with a domed rotunda. Overall, it referenced the upper-class palaces of the 17th and 18th centuries, and aimed at having a strong sense of monumentality. All the architectural elements—the deep cornice, decorative top, eave brackets—add to this strength that the ROM possessed, as it was purely a structure with the function of collecting, but not for exhibiting.Browne, Kelvin. Bold Visions: the Architecture of the Royal Ontario Museum. Toronto: ROM, 2008.

===Curatorial centre===

Designed by Toronto architect Gene Kinoshita, with Mathers & Haldenby, the curatorial centre forms the southern section of the museum. Completed in 1984, it was built during the same expansion as the former Queen Elizabeth II Terrace Galleries which stood on north side of the museum. The architecture is a simple modernist style of poured concrete, glass, and pre-cast concrete and aggregate panels.
The curatorial centre houses the museum's administrative and curatorial services, and provides storage for artifacts that are not on exhibit.
In 2006, the curatorial centre was renamed to Louise Hawley Stone Curatorial Centre in honor of the late Mrs. Louise Hawley Stone. Mrs. Stone devoted herself to the ROM throughout her life and she donated a number of artifacts and various collections to the museum. In her will, she transferred $49.7 million (Cdn) to the Louise Hawley Stone Charitable Trust which was created to help with the upkeep of the building and to acquire new artifacts.[tpl]cite web|title=Royal Ontario Museum’s News Release|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|url= http://www.rom.on.ca/news/releases/public.php?mediakey=wjo82sxdiw|accessdate=26 March 2012[/tpl]

===The Crystal===

The new main entrance to the Royal Ontario Museum, Daniel Libeskind's The Crystal, first opened in 2007.[tpl]cite web|title=Royal Ontario Museum|url=http://daniel-libeskind.com/projects/royal-ontario-museum|accessdate=28 March 2012[/tpl] The Deconstructivist crystalline-form is clad in 25 percent glass and 75 percent aluminium sitting on top of a steel frame. The Crystal's canted walls do not touch the sides of the existing heritage buildings, used to close the envelope between the new form and existing walls. These walls act as a pathway for pedestrians to safely travel across "The Crystal".
The building's design is similar to some of Libeskind's other works, notably the Jewish Museum in Berlin, the London Metropolitan University Graduate Centre, and the Fredric C. Hamilton Building at the Denver Art Museum.[tpl]cite web|last=Libeskin|first=Daniel|title=Prominent Poles|url=http://www.angelfire.com/scifi2/rsolecki/daniel_libeskind.html[/tpl] The steel framework was manufactured and assembled by Walters Inc. of Hamilton, Ontario. The extruded anodized aluminium cladding was fabricated by Josef Gartner in Germany; the only company in the world that can produce the material. The company also provided the titanium cladding for Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beijing.gc.ca/beijing/en/1627.htm |title=Canadian Embassy Beijing: New Rom rising |publisher=Beijing.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25[/tpl]
The overall aim of The Crystal is to provide openness and accessibility, seeking to blur the lines between the threshold linking the public area of the street and the more private area of the museum. The goal is to act as an open threshold where people, as well as artifacts, animate the space.  The main lobby is a three-story high atrium, named the Hyacinth Gloria Chen Crystal Court.[tpl]cite web|title=Exhibition Spaces|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/exhibitions/spaces/chen_court.php[/tpl]  The lobby is overlooked by balconies and flanked by the J.P. Driscoll Family Stair of Wonders and the Spirit House, an interstitial space formed by the intersection of the east and west crystals, intended as a space of emotional and physical diversion.Royal Ontario Museum: Thorsell Spirit House
On 1 June 2007, the Governor General, Michaëlle Jean, attended the Architectural Opening of the "Michael Lee-Chin Crystal".http://www.enotes.com/topic/Michaëlle_Jean This caused controversy because the public opinion had been divided concerning the merits of its angular design. On its opening, Globe and Mail architecture critic Lisa Rochon complained that "the new ROM rages at the world," was oppressive, angsty, and hellish, while others (perhaps championed by the architecture critic at the competing Toronto Star, Christopher Hume) hailed it as a monument.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/article/220522 |title=Toronto Star: Inside the ROM crystal; June 1, 2007 |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2007-06-01 |accessdate=2013-09-25[/tpl]  Some critics have gone as far as ranking it as one of the ten ugliest buildings in the world.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/roms-crystal-makes-list-of-worlds-ugliest-buildings/article1370744/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=ROM's Crystal makes list of world's ugliest buildings | date=23 August 2012[/tpl] The project also experienced budget and construction time over-runs, and drew comparisons to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao for using so-called "starchitecture" to attract tourism.
In October 2007, the Lee-Chin Crystal was reported to have suffered from water leakage causing concerns due to the building's resilience to weather, especially in the face of the new structure's proximate first winter.Globe and Mail: Leaks, woes a smudge on Crystal's sparkle; October 3, 2007[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]  Although a two-layer cladding system was incorporated into the design of the Crystal to prevent the formation of dangerous snow loads on the structure, past architectural creations of Daniel Libeskind, (including the Denver Art Museum) have suffered from weather-related complications.Globe and Mail: A Crystal with its fair share of wrinkles; May 18, 2007[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/070411denverartmuseum.asp |title=Architectural Record: Repairs at Denver Art Museum Set to Begin; April 11, 2007 |publisher=Archrecord.construction.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25[/tpl]
Installation of the permanent galleries of the Lee-Chin Crystal began mid-June 2007, after a ten-day period when all the empty gallery spaces were open to the public.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/news/releases/public.php?mediakey=7r50pyqwwj |title=News | Royal Ontario Museum |publisher=Rom.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25[/tpl] Within The Crystal, there is a gift shop, C5 restaurant lounge, a cafeteria, seven additional galleries and Canada’s largest temporary exhibition hall. The galleries added to the Crystal gave different aspects to the ROM; fascinating visuals, architectural artifacts and environment, art, correspondence between object and space, as well as stories within the visuals.[tpl]cite web|title=Dawn of the Crystal Age|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/crystal/contemplate.php[/tpl] The C5 restaurant Lounge is an award-winning designs firm lI BY IV Design Associated Inc.[tpl]cite web|title=Dining|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/dining_shopping/dining/crystal5.php|work=ROM|accessdate=29 March 2012[/tpl]

==Galleries==

Originally, there were five major galleries at the ROM, one each for the fields of archaeology, geology, mineralogy, paleontology, and zoology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archaeology.about.com/library/products/blprrom.htm |title=Guide Rating and Review: Large Museum Shops, accessed November 10, 2005 |publisher=Archaeology.about.com |date=2013-07-12 |accessdate=2013-09-25[/tpl] In general, the museum pieces were labelled and arranged in a static fashion that had changed little since Edwardian times. For example, the insects’ exhibit that lasted up until the 1970s, housed a variety of specimens from different parts of the world in long rows of glass cases. Insects of the same genus were pinned to the inside of the cabinet, with only the species name and location found as a description.
By the 1960s, more interpretive displays were ushered in, among the first being the original dinosaur gallery, established in the mid-1960s. Dinosaur fossils were now staged in dynamic poses against backdrop paintings and models of contemporaneous landscapes and vegetation. The displays became more descriptive and interpretive, sometimes, as with the extinction of the woolly mammoth, offering several different leading theories on the issue for the visitor to ponder. This trend continued, and up until the present time the galleries became less staid, and more dynamic or descriptive and interpretive. This trend arguably came to a culmination in the 1980s with the opening of The Bat Cave, where a sound system, strobe lights and gentle puffs of air attempts to re-create the experience of walking through a cave as a colony of bats fly out.
The original galleries were simply named after their subject material, but in more recent years, individual galleries have been named in honour of sponsors who have donated significant funds or collections to the institution. There are now two main categories of galleries present in the ROM: the Natural History Galleries and the World Culture Galleries.

===Natural History Galleries===

The Natural history galleries are all gathered on the second floor of the museum. The gallery contains collections and samples of various animals such as bats, birds, and dinosaur bones and skeletons.
The Life in Crisis: Schad Gallery of Biodiversity, designed by Reich+Petch and opened in late 2009, features endangered species, including specimens of a polar bear, a giant panda, a white rhinoceros, a Burmese python, Canadian coral, a leatherback sea turtle, a Coelacanth, a Rafflesia flower, and many other rare species.  There are also recently extinct species displayed, including specimens of a Passenger Pigeon and Great Auk, as well as skeletons of a Dodo bird and a moa with a specimen of a moa egg, and many other recently extinct species. The gallery presents the need to protect the natural environment to educate the public about overhunting, habitat destruction, and climate change, which are main causes of extinction. In September, it received an Award of Excellence by the Association of Registered Interior Designers of Ontario. The Schad Gallery of Biodiversity is not merely an exhibition gallery showcasing Earth’s wondrous specimens, but a lesson for the future care of the planet.
The gallery is organized into three zones exploring the central themes: Life is Diverse, Life is interconnected and Life is at Risk. “Interestingly, biodiversity is a relatively new term popularized in 1985 as a contraction of biological diversity” said Anthony Reich, Principal, at Reich+Petch. “It’s a big subject that’s become more relevant to everybody. The challenge was how to tell this big story in a [tpl]convert|10,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on|sigfig=1[/tpl] space. We decided to design a dynamic, immersive experience with three core themes that hopefully will make a lasting impression on visitors.”Canadian Interiors. "Reich + biodiversity + Petch", Canadian Interiors, 1 September 2009. Retrieved on 1 February 2013.
The Tallgrass Prairies and Savannas, is a part of the gallery that features one of the most endangered and diverse habitats in Ontario. The display features examples of the regions and the efforts by the Ontario ministry of Natural Resources, to maintain and restore the tall grass prairies and savannas.
The Gallery of Birds has on display many bird specimens from past centuries.  The Gallery of Birds is dominated by the broad “Birds in flight” display where stuffed birds are enclosed in a glass display for visitors to experience. Dioramas allow visitors to learn about the many bird species and how environmental and habitual changes have put other bird species in danger of extinction. Pull-out drawers let you examine more closely eggs, feathers, footprints and nests.[tpl]cite web|title=Gallery of Birds|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/exhibitions/nhistory/nhbirds.php|accessdate=26 March 2012[/tpl]  The gallery included exhibits of other extinct species such as, the Passenger Pigeon.  These were later moved to the Schad Gallery.
The Bat Cave is an immersive experience for visitors that presents over 20 bats and 800 models in a recreated habitat, in addition to educational panels and video.[tpl]cite web|title=The Bat Cave|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/en/exhibitions-galleries/galleries/natural-history/bat-cave|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=23 September 2013[/tpl] Originally opened in 1988, the bat cave was reopened on February 27, 2010 after extensive renovations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/life/parent/2010/02/24/the_rom_reopens_the_bat_cave.html |title=The ROM reopens the bat cave, accessed October 15, 2013 |publisher=thestar.com |date=2010-02-04 |accessdate=2013-10-15[/tpl] The 1,700-square-foot exhibit most notably includes a recreation of St. Clair Cave located in central Jamaica. The original cave was formed by an underground river that flowed 30 meters below ground through the limestone and was three kilometers long. This cave was then recreated in the museum based on ROM fieldwork conducted in Jamaica in 1984.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/the-bat-cave-is-back |title=The Bat Cave is back, accessed October 15, 2013 |publisher=rom.on.ca |date=2010-02-25 |accessdate=2013-10-15[/tpl] A large amount of bat research has been conducted with support from the ROM. In 2011, the ROM hosted a "bat workshop" connected with the 41st Annual North American Symposium on Bat Research.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.batcon.org/pdfs/education/Bat%20Workshop%20Toronto.PDF |title=Bat Workshop:41st Annual North American Symposium on Bat Research, accessed October 15, 2013 |publisher=batcon.org |accessdate=2013-10-15[/tpl]

====Fossils and Evolution====

The Reed Gallery of the Age of Mammals explores the rise of mammals through the Cenozoic Era that followed the extinction of the dinosaurs. There are over 400 specimens from North America and South America on display. Also included in the gallery are, 30 fossil skeletons of extinct mammals, over 160 non-mammalian specimens, and hundreds of fossil plants, insects, fish, and turtles. The gallery's entrance begins with mammals that arose shortly after the extinction of the dinosaurs. A highlight of this gallery is the sabre-toothed nimravid Dinictis.
The James and Louise Temerty Galleries of the Age of Dinosaurs and Gallery of the Age of Mammals feature many examples of complete dinosaur skeletons, as well as those of early birds, reptiles, mammals, and marine animals, ranging from the Jurassic to Cretaceous periods. The highlight of the exhibit is "Gordo", a recently rediscovered Barosaurus skeleton that is the largest dinosaur on display in Canada.Greenwood Davis, Heather.
