Rube Lutzke (November 17, 1897 – March 6, 1938) was a professional baseball player. He played from 1923 to 1927 with the Cleveland Indians. He primarily played third base.
According to the Saturday May 4, 1920 Montreal Standard (p. 30) Lutzke was known for having been sent to the minors after management objected to a stunt he pulled at a wild team party. Lutzke made a bet that he could slide down a rope from the fifth floor hotel room. He won the bet but burnt his hands on the rope, making him temporarily unable to play.
