[[Viides Luku – Hävitetty]]

CATEGORIES: 2007 albums, Moonsorrow albums

V: Hävitetty (Chapter V - Ravaged) is the fifth full-length album by Finnish pagan metal band Moonsorrow. It was released on January 10, 2007 through Spinefarm Records. As a joke by the band, the name "Homosika" (gay pig) was released as the working title for "Viides Luku - Hävitetty".
Hävitetty follows up on the sound established on Moonsorrow's previous studio album, Verisäkeet. The album consists of only two songs, each exceeding 25 minutes in length, and act as organic compositions with recurring musical themes which are gradually built upon up to climaxes.  While the folk instruments and choirs of prior albums are still present, Hävitetty has a more prominent black metal influence; for example it features tremolo picking and blast beats. In the New York Times, the album was called "an engrossing hourlong album,"[ref]
</ref> and "engrossing, enveloping music."<ref>
