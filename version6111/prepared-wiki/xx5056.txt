</ref> In this capacity, Davis began the [[Pacific Railroad Surveys]] in order to determine various possible routes for the proposed [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]]. He promoted the [[Gadsden Purchase]] of today's southern [[Arizona]] from Mexico, partly because it would provide an easier route for the new railroad; the Pierce administration agreed, and the land was purchased in December 1853.<ref>Cooper 2000, p. 257.</ref> He saw the size of the regular army as insufficient to fulfill its mission, and maintained that salaries would have to be increased, something which had not occurred for 25 years.

===Return to Senate===

In the 1840s, tensions were growing between the North and South over various issues including slavery. The Wilmot Proviso, introduced in 1846, contributed to these tensions; if passed, it would have banned slavery in any land acquired from Mexico. The Compromise of 1850 brought a temporary respite, but the Dred Scott case, decided in 1857, spurred public debate. There was increasing talk of the South seceding from the Union.Dodd 1909, pp. 122–129.
Davis’ renewed service in the Senate was interrupted in early 1858 by an illness that began as a severe cold and which threatened him with the loss of his left eye. He was forced to remain in a darkened room for four weeks.Allen 1999, p. 232. He spent the summer of 1858 in Portland, Maine. On the Fourth of July, Davis delivered an anti-secessionist speech on board a ship near Boston. He again urged the preservation of the Union on October 11 in Faneuil Hall, Boston, and returned to the Senate soon after.Dodd 1907, pp. 12, 171–172.
As he explained in his memoir The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, he believed that each state was sovereign and had an unquestionable right to secede from the Union. At the same time, he counseled delay among his fellow Southerners, because he did not think that the North would permit the peaceable exercise of the right to secession. Having served as secretary of war under President Pierce, he also knew that the South lacked the military and naval resources necessary to defend itself in a war. Following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, however, events accelerated. South Carolina adopted an ordinance of secession on December 20, 1860, and Mississippi did so on January 9, 1861. Davis had expected this but waited until he received official notification; then on January 21, the day Davis called "the saddest day of my life",Cooper 2000, p. 3. he delivered a farewell address to the United States Senate, resigned and returned to Mississippi.

==President of the Confederate States of America==

Anticipating a call for his services since Mississippi had seceded, Davis had sent a telegraph message to Governor John J. Pettus saying, "Judge what Mississippi requires of me and place me accordingly."Cooper 2000, p. 322. On January 23, 1861, Pettus made Davis a major general of the Army of Mississippi. On February 9, a constitutional convention at Montgomery, Alabama, considered Davis, and Robert Toombs of Georgia. Davis had widespread support from six of the seven states, and easily won. He was seen as the "champion of a slave society and embodied the values of the planter class," and was elected provisional Confederate President by acclamation.[ref]

[/ref] Alexander Stephens was chosen as Vice President, but he and Davis feuded constantly.Dodd 1907, p. 221.
Davis was the first choice because of his strong political and military credentials. He wanted to serve as commander in chief of the Confederate armies but said he would serve wherever directed.Coulter 1950, p. 24. His wife Varina later wrote that when he received word that he had been chosen as president, "Reading that telegram he looked so grieved that I feared some evil had befallen our family."Cooper 2000, p. 352.
Several forts in Confederate territory remained in Union hands. Davis sent a commission to Washington with an offer to pay for any federal property on Southern soil, as well as the Southern portion of the national debt, but Lincoln refused to meet with the commissioners. Brief Informal discussions did take place with Secretary of State William Seward through Supreme Court Justice John A. Campbell, an Alabamian who had not yet resigned; Seward hinted that Fort Sumter would be evacuated, but gave no assurance.Cooper 2000, pp. 361–362.
On March 1, 1861, Davis appointed General P. G. T. Beauregard to command all Confederate troops in the vicinity of Charleston, South Carolina, where state officials prepared to take possession of Fort Sumter; Beauregard was to prepare his forces but avoid an attack on the fort. Lincoln dispatched a small fleet of warships, troops and transports from the navy yard in New York to resupply and re-enforce Fort Pickens and Fort Sumter, and he told Davis they would not fire unless fired upon.  They did arrive but were unable to help and just watched the action from 10 miles out.McPherson 1989, pp. 271–273.
Davis faced the most important decision of his career: to prevent reinforcement at Fort Sumter or to let it take place.  He and his cabinet decided to demand that the Federal garrison surrender, and if this was refused, to use military force to prevent reinforcement before the fleet arrived. Major Anderson did not surrender. Beauregard bombarded the fort on April 12. The Confederates launched an artillery attack on Fort Sumter until it surrendered.  No one was killed in the artillery duel, but the attack on the U.S. fortress meant the fighting had started. President Lincoln called up state militia to march south to recapture Federal property. In the North and South, massive rallies were held to demand immediate war. The Civil War had begun.Cooper 2000, pp. 337–340.[tpl]cite book|first=David Herbert|last=Donald|title=Lincoln|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|year=1995|pages=285–299[/tpl]Strode 1959, pp. 24–66.McPherson 1989, pp. 273–275.
At the start of the war, nearly 21 million people lived in the North compared to 9 million in the South. The North had vastly greater industrial capacity, built nearly all of the locomotives, steamships and industrial machinery, and had a much larger and more integrated railroad system. Nearly all of the munitions facilities were in the North, and critical ingredients for gunpowder were in very short supply in the South.  The Union had a large navy, whereas the new Confederacy had only a few captured warships; the handful it built were failures. The Union blockade made imports via blockade runners difficult and expensive.McPherson 1989, pp. 313–319.[tpl]cite book|first=James M.|last=McPherson|title=War on the Waters: The Union and Confederate Navies, 1861-1865|year=2012|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9780807835883[/tpl]
When Virginia joined the Confederacy, Davis moved his government to Richmond in May 1861. He and his family took up his residence there at the White House of the Confederacy later that month.Strode 1959, pp. 90–94. Having served since February as the provisional president, Davis was elected to a full six-year term on November 6, 1861, and was inaugurated on February 22, 1862.Dodd 1907, p. 263.
In June 1862, in his most successful move, Davis assigned General Robert E. Lee to replace the wounded Joseph E. Johnston in command of the Army of Northern Virginia, the main Confederate army in the Eastern Theater. That December he made a tour of Confederate armies in the west of the country. Davis had a very small circle of military advisers, and largely made the main strategic decisions on his own, though he had special respect for Lee's views. Given the Confederacy's limited resources compared with the Union, Davis decided that the Confederacy would have to fight mostly on the strategic defensive. He maintained a mostly defensive outlook throughout the war, paying special attention to the defense of his national capital at Richmond. He attempted strategic offensives when he felt that military success would both shake Northern self-confidence and strengthen the peace movements there. The campaigns met defeat at Antietam in Maryland (1862) and Gettysburg in Pennsylvania (1863),[ref]
