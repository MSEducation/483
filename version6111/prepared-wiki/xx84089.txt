===Fireflies in Matsuo-kyo===

Many tourists go there to watch fireflies twinkling. The Tatsuno town government stresses in its homepage Tatsuno town HP (in Japanese) http://www.town.tatsuno.nagano.jp/tatsunosypher/www/normal_top.jsp or brochure that it has kept protecting fireflies for a long time, but it is not necessarily true.
About 40 years ago, Mr Katsuno got many non-native fireflies from firefliy dealers in other areas and then released them into the Matsuo-kyo area in this town. Since then, government officials instructed by Mr Katsuno have bred many non-native fireflies in the field, so native fireflies seem to have gone extinct in the Matsuo-kyo area. There are a great deal of genetic and ecological differences between the native and introduced Genji fireflies just like a native and an introduced species. 
Recently, this history of the intentional introduction of non-native fireflies and their bad influence in Tatsuno were shown in an academic journal.Y. Iguchi (2009) The ecological impact of an introduced population on a native population in the firefly Luciola cruciata (Coleoptera: Lampyridae).Biodiversity and Conservation, 18: 82119-2126. http://www.springerlink.com/content/5426518h66681m41/.
This ecological problem in Tatsuno was also reported by several major newspapers.Asahi Shimbun (Jun 17, 2008; Nagano Chunan edition, p27).Mainichi Shimbun (Jun 22, 2008; Nagano Nanshin edition, p25).Yomiuri Shimbun  (July 28, 2008; evening edition, p13).
Like other introduced species, the non-native fireflies will also spread into other areas in this town. The town government should protect native fireflies, but they (government officials and the mayor) have not tried to do it. One of the reasons may be that even non-native fireflies are helpful for tourism bringing money. Local governments in  Japan are generally responsible for protecting biodiversity, because Japan has ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity. However, the Tatsuno town government has been neglecting it. Researches on fireflies in Tatsuno is being stopped by this local government.
Tourists should not only enjoy watching fireflies, but also pay attention to the bad influence of non-native fireflies. They also should consider how native fireflies are protected.
