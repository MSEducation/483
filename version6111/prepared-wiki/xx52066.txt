Longdendale Trail is an English long-distance trail which follows the alignment of the former Woodhead railway line which used to run between Manchester and Sheffield (and closed east of Hadfield in 1981). It has shallow gradients and a smooth surface that makes it popular with families and cyclists.
The Longdendale Trail, which opened in May 1992, forms part of the longer Trans Pennine Trail, NCR 62, that runs from coast to coast across the UK (Liverpool to Hull).
