Melvin Kenneth "Mel" Smith (3 December 1952 – 19 July 2013) was an English comedian, writer, film director, producer and actor. 
Smith was best known for his work on the sketch comedy shows Not the Nine O'Clock News and Alas Smith and Jones along with his comedy partner Griff Rhys Jones. Smith and Jones founded Talkback, which grew to be one of the UK's largest producers of television comedy and light entertainment programming.

==Early life==

Smith's father, Kenneth, was born in Tow Law, County Durham, and worked at a coal mine during the Second World War looking after the pit ponies. After the war he moved to London, and married Smith's mother, whose parents owned a greengrocer's store in Chiswick, London. When the government legalised high street betting, he turned the shop into the first betting shop in Chiswick.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk/2001/7/22/164851.html |title=Newcastle one, Hollywood nil (From The Northern Echo) |publisher=Archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk |date=22 July 2001 |accessdate= 8 December 2010[/tpl]
Smith was born and brought up in Chiswick. He was educated at Hogarth Primary School, Chiswick and at Latymer Upper School, an independent school in Hammersmith. He went on to study experimental psychology at New College, Oxford.[tpl]cite web|author=Cavendish, Dominic |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3653973/Im-hoping-to-cover-my-air-fare.html |title=I'm hoping to cover my air fare |work = The Daily Telegraph |date=22 July 2006 |accessdate= 24 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/526237/ |title=Smith, Mel |publisher=British Film Institute | accessdate= 20 July 2010[/tpl]

==Career==

While at Oxford University, Smith produced The Tempest, and performed at the Edinburgh Fringe with the Oxford University Dramatic Society. One year they shared a venue with the Cambridge Footlights, directed by John Lloyd. His extra-curricular activities while at university led to his joining the Royal Court Theatre production team in London, and then Bristol Old Vic. He was also associate director of Sheffield's Crucible Theatre for two years. Later, he directed a theatre production of Not in Front of the Audience.[tpl]cite web|title=Mel Smith Biography|url=http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/s/13598/Melvyn%20Kenneth%20%28Mel%29+SMITH.aspx|publisher=Debretts|accessdate=20 July 2013[/tpl]
John Lloyd later got the opportunity to develop the idea that became the satirical BBC television series Not the Nine O'clock News. This was followed briefly by Smith and Goody (with Bob Goody) and then the comedy sketch series Alas Smith and Jones, co-starring Griff Rhys Jones, its title being a pun on the name of the American television series Alias Smith and Jones. In 1982, he starred as the lead role in ITV drama Muck and Brass where he played Tom Craig, a ruthless property developer. In 1984, he appeared in the Minder episode 'A Star Is Gorn' playing the character Cyril Ash, a record producer. He also guest starred on The Goodies episode Animals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/90644?view=credit&page=2|title=Smith, Mel: Filmography| publisher = BFI Film & TV Database |accessdate= 23 January 2009[/tpl] At the end of the 1980s, he played the title role in the sitcom Colin's Sandwich (1987–89), playing a British Rail employee with aspirations to be a writer.
In 1981, Smith and Griff Rhys Jones founded TalkBack Productions, a company that has produced many of the most significant British comedy shows of the past two decades, including Smack the Pony, Da Ali G Show, I'm Alan Partridge and Big Train. In 2000, the company was sold to Pearson for £62 million.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/791303.stm|title=Pearson TV buys TalkBack|date=14 June 2000 |publisher= BBC News |accessdate= 23 January 2009[/tpl]
Smith co-wrote and took the lead role in the space comedy Morons from Outer Space (1985), but the film failed to make much impact. His next cinema effort was better received as director of The Tall Guy (1989), giving Emma Thompson a major screen role. Perhaps his best-known film in America is Brain Donors, the 1992 update of the Marx Brothers film A Night at the Opera, starring Smith as a cheeky, opportunistic cab driver turned ballet promoter. Paramount Pictures considered this film the outstanding comedy of the year, but when the producers left Paramount for another studio, Paramount withdrew its support for the film.[tpl]cite web|title=Brain Donors|url=http://tagsgf.com/2010/08/04/lost-reel-review-brain-donors/|work=Lost Reel Review|publisher=tagsgf.com|accessdate=20 July 2013[/tpl]
In 1987, Smith recorded a single with Kim Wilde for Comic Relief: a cover of the Christmas song Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree with some additional comedy lines written by Smith and Jones.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wilde-life.com/lyrics/00108/|title=Rockin' around the Christmas tree|work=Wilde Life: Lyrics|accessdate= 23 January 2009[/tpl] The pairing of Smith and Wilde was a comic allusion to the duo Mel & Kim. The song reached number three in the UK charts.[tpl]cite book|last=Warwick|first=Neil|coauthors=Kutner, Tony; Kutner, Jon|title=The Complete Book of the British Charts|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2004|edition=3rd|page=1012[/tpl] He appeared in The Princess Bride as the Albino.
Smith and Jones were reunited in 2005 for a review/revival of their earlier television series in The Smith And Jones Sketchbook. Smith joked that "Obviously, Griff's got more money than me so he came to work in a Rolls Royce and I came on a bicycle. But it was great fun to do and we are firmly committed to doing something new together, because you don't chuck that sort of chemistry away. Of course, I'll have to pretend I like Restoration.[tpl]cite web| author = Chadwick, Alan | url=http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/edinburgh/interview/article.html?in_article_id=18177&in_page_id=33 |title=Mel Smith | work = Metro |date= 7 August 2006 |accessdate= 16 August 2013[/tpl]
In August 2006, Smith returned to the theatre stage after some 20 years, appearing at the Edinburgh Fringe festival in Allegiance, Irish journalist and author Mary Kenny's play about Churchill's encounter with the Irish nationalist leader Michael Collins in 1921.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/07/22/btmel22.xml | work= The Daily Telegraph| title=I'm hoping to cover my air fare | first=Dominic | last=Cavendish | date=22 July 2006 | accessdate=12 May 2010[/tpl] The play initially caused some controversy, with Smith proposing to flout the Scottish ban on smoking in public places, but the scene was quickly adapted after gaining the required amount of publicity. The play was directed by Brian Gilbert and produced by Daniel Jewel.[tpl]Cite web | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489635/| publisher = Internet Movie Database | accessdate = 21 July 2013 | title = Allegiance (2005)[/tpl] In 2006, he also appeared in Hustle as Benjamin Frasier, a pub landlord who was scammed by the Hustle team when his on-screen son Joey tried to launch his rap career.
In autumn 2006, Smith starred opposite Belinda Lang in a tour of a new comedy An Hour and a Half Late by French playwright Gérald Sibleyras, which was adapted by Smith. He then directed a West End revival of Charley's Aunt starring Stephen Tompkinson. From October 2007 to January 2008 he played the role of Wilbur Turnblad in the London production of Hairspray at the Shaftesbury Theatre.[tpl]cite news|title=Mel Smith to make West End debut|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6958780.stm|accessdate=20 July 2013| publisher = BBC News |date=22 August 2007[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Smith was married to Pam, a former model who grew up in Easington and Durham. They have one daughter, Alexandra. The couple had houses in St John's Wood (backing onto Lord's Cricket Ground), and the hamlet of Little Haseley, Oxfordshire (a Grade II listed barn conversion, sold in 2011)[tpl]cite news|last=White|first=Roland|title=Alas, Mel Smith is moving on|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/homes_and_gardens/My_Place/article419199.ece|newspaper= The Sunday Times |date=17 October 2010[/tpl] as well as a property in Barbados.[tpl]cite book|title=Globetrotter Travel Pack[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] Barbados|author=Shales, Melissa|publisher=New Holland Publishers|date=29 June 2007|ISBN=1845375602[/tpl]

==Health==

Smith was hospitalised in 1999 with stomach ulcers, after an accidental overdose of more than 50 Nurofen Plus tablets a day, after previously admitting an addiction to sleeping pills. Smith said at the time that the pressures of film work were a contributing factor, along with a desperate need to ease the pain caused by gout. Partly as a result, he agreed to sell Talkback Productions.  On 31 December 2008, Smith appeared on Celebrity Mastermind whilst suffering from severe pharyngitis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/01/02/8061/mel_smith_health_fears_allayed |title=Mel Smith health fears allayed |publisher=Chortle.co.uk |accessdate= 18 February 2011[/tpl]

==Death==

On the morning of 19 July 2013, the London Ambulance Service were called to Smith's home in north-west London. Smith was confirmed dead by the ambulance crew, with a later post-mortem confirming death from a heart attack.[tpl]cite news|title=Mel Smith dies of a heart attack aged 60|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23390982|accessdate=20 July 2013|publisher=BBC News|date=20 July 2013[/tpl] Co-star Griff Rhys Jones said that "To everybody who ever met him, Mel was a force for life.

Stephen Fry noted that Smith "lived a full life, but was kind, funny and wonderful to know."[tpl]Cite web | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/jul/20/comedian-mel-smith-dies-actor | work = The Guardian | title = Comedian Mel Smith dies | first = Conal | last = Urquhart| date = 20 July 2013 | accessdate = 21 July 2013[/tpl]
