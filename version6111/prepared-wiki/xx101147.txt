In 1988 it merged with Imperial College London, and then with Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School in 1997 to form Imperial College School of Medicine. In 2007 Imperial College became an independent institution when it withdrew from the University of London.University of London: Updated position statement re: Imperial College London

==History==

St Mary's Hospital first opened its doors to patients in 1851, the last of the great voluntary hospitals to be founded.
With the shift towards community healthcare delivered in the early 20th century, partly due to the social medicine revolution, pressure on bed occupancy relaxed, and with the formation of the National Health Service in the 1940s, many of the local hospitals of the St Mary's teaching hospital group eventually closed and relocated services to the Paddington basin site:
St Charles' Hospital, formerly the Marylebone Workhouse Infirmary, and the Western Eye Hospital, formerly the Western Ophthalmic Hospital, remained as part of the St Mary's Hospital NHS Trust, now all part of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust.
The hospital site incorporates the private Lindo wing where several celebrity and royal births have occurred.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22983365|title=10 curious things about the royal birth|publisher=BBC NEWS|accessdate=20 June 2013[/tpl]
