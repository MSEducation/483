Buddha's delight, often transliterated as Luóhàn zhāi, lo han jai, or lo hon jai, is a vegetarian dish well known in Chinese and Buddhist cuisine. It is sometimes also called Luóhàn cài ([tpl]zh|s=罗汉菜|t=羅漢菜[/tpl]).
The dish is traditionally enjoyed by Buddhist monks who are vegetarians, but it has also grown in popularity throughout the world as a common dish available as a vegetarian option in Chinese restaurants.  The dish consists of various vegetables and other vegetarian ingredients (sometimes with the addition of seafood or eggs), which are cooked in soy sauce-based liquid with other seasonings until tender. The specific ingredients used vary greatly both inside and outside Asia.

==Etymology==

In the name luóhàn zhāi, luóhàn – short for Ā luóhàn ([tpl]zh|s=阿罗汉|t=阿羅漢|p=Ā LuóHàn[/tpl]) – is the Chinese transliteration  of the Sanskrit arhat, meaning an enlightened, ascetic individual or the Buddha himself.  Zhāi ([tpl]zh|s=斋|t=齋|p=zhāi[/tpl]) means "vegetarian food" or "vegetarian diet."
The dish is usually made with at least 10 ingredients, although more elaborate versions may comprise 18 or even 35 ingredients.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080210040452/http://news.fjnet.com/ryzy/ryzrcq/t20041010_2029.htm |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-02-10 |accessdate=2012-08-22[/tpl] If 18 ingredients are used, the dish is called Luóhàn quánzhāi (simplified: 罗汉全斋; traditional: 羅漢全齋).
In China, Hong Kong and Toronto, when served exclusively using only the most flavor-packed vegetarian ingredients, such as pickled tofu or sweet bean curds, it is known as tián suān zhāi ([tpl]zh|t=甜酸齋|s=甜酸斋|p=tian2 suan1 zhai1[/tpl]; literally "sweet and sour vegetarian dish").

==Tradition==

As suggested by its name, it is a dish traditionally enjoyed by Buddhists, but it has also grown in popularity throughout the world as a common dish available in Chinese restaurants (though often not including all of the ingredients) as a vegetarian option. It is traditionally served in Chinese households on the first day of the Chinese New Year, stemming from the old Buddhist practice that one should maintain a vegetarian diet in the first five days of the new year, as a form of self-purification. Some of the rarer ingredients, such as fat choy and arrowhead, are generally only eaten at this time of year.

==Ingredients==

The following is a list of ingredients often used in Buddha's delight, each of which, according to Chinese tradition, is ascribed a particular auspicious significance.  As the dish varies from chef to chef and family to family, not every ingredient is always used in every version of the dish.
