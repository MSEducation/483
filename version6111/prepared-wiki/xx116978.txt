==Description and behaviour==

D. hirtipes can be distinguished from other members of the genus Discoplax by the smooth and distinctly inflated carapace. It is also blue or blue-brown in colour, compared to purple or purple-brown in the remaining species.[tpl]cite journal |author=Peter K. L.

The breeding season for D. hirtipes lasts seven months, and females must migrate to the sea to release their larvae.[tpl]cite book |editor=Peter Castro, Peter J. F. Davie & Peter K. L.

==Distribution==

D. hirtipes has a wide distribution across the western Pacific Ocean.[tpl]cite journal |author=Peter K. L. Ng & Peter J. F.

==Taxonomic history==

Discoplax hirtipes was originally described by James Dwight Dana under the name Cardisoma hirtipes. His description was published in 1851 based on material collected on the United States Exploring Expedition ("Wilkes expedition") in Fiji.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/online-resources/fauna/afd/taxa/Discoplax_hirtipes |title=Species Discoplax hirtipes (Dana, 1851) |work=Australian Faunal Directory |publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts |date=January 29, 2010 |accessdate=November 12, 2010[/tpl] The type material has been lost, so a neotype from Fiji was designated in 2012.
