However, after Al Charara had all of its matches canceled by the LFF, all teams played 24 games. At the end of season, the lowest two placed teams were automatically relegated to the Libyan Second Division, with the winner of the LSD automatically taking its place. However, because of the troubles of Al Charara, three clubs were promoted from the Second Division for 2007/2008
