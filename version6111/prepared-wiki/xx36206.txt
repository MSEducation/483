The oceanic trenches are hemispheric-scale long but narrow topographic depressions of the sea floor. They are also the deepest parts of the ocean floor. Oceanic trenches are a distinctive morphological feature of convergent plate boundaries. 
Along convergent plate boundaries, plates move together at rates that vary from a few mm to over ten cm per year. A trench marks the position at which the flexed, subducting  slab begins to descend beneath another lithospheric slab.  Trenches are generally parallel to a volcanic island arc, and about [tpl]convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from a volcanic arc. Oceanic trenches typically extend [tpl]convert|3|to|4|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] below the level of the surrounding oceanic floor. The greatest ocean depth to be sounded is in the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench, at a depth of 
[tpl]convert|10911|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] below sea level.  Oceanic lithosphere moves into trenches at a global rate of about 3 km2/yr.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rowley|first=David B.|title=Rate of plate creation and destruction: 180 Ma to present|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|year=2002|volume=114|issue=8|pages=927–933|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(2002)1142.0.CO;2|bibcode = 2002GSAB..114..927R [/tpl]
