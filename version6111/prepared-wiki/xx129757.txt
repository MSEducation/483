Cricket Brasil counts former Indian Test cricketer Ashok Gandotra, who was born in Rio de Janeiro, as one of its member.

==History==

Brazil became an ICC member in 2002. http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Countries/42.html Its international debut came in 2006, when Brazil took part in Division Three of the ICC Americas Championship in Suriname. Although Brazil lost all three opening games in that tournament, no doubt due to lack of international exposure, its cricket has developed since then. 
Brazil won the 2009 ICC Americas Championship Division Three, winning all of its matches against Belize, Chile and Peru. This victory enabled Brazil to qualify for the 2010 ICC Americas Championship Division Two. 
However, Brazil seemingly struggled at this higher level, thus after losing all of their four matches, were relegated to Division Three.
