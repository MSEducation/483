CATEGORIES: Northwest Territories Legislative Assemblies

The 17th Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly was established by the results of the 2011 Northwest Territories general election on October 3, 2011. It is the 25th sitting of the Assembly in the territories history. The Assembly will likely be dissolved in 2015 if the government continues to follow the fixed election date calendar.

==Term extension debate==

Members voted on Motion 16-17(5) introduced by Hay River North MLA Jane Groenewegen to extend the term of the Assembly to five years starting with the 18th Legislature to match every other provincial and territorial jurisdiction in Canada. This change was approved by the federal government. In addition they voted to ask for permission of the federal government to extend the current mandate of the Assembly to postpone the 23rd general election and sit until October 2016.[tpl]cite web|title=Term Extension Debate|publisher=Elections NWT|url=http://www.electionsnwt.ca/term-extension-debate/#more-3586|date=March 10, 2014[/tpl] The excuse given is to avoid having an election during federal election and municipal elections in the territory scheduled at the same time claiming voters will be fatigued. The decision by council has prompted a petition calling for the Assembly to be dissolved early.[tpl]cite news|publisher=CBC News|date=March 11, 2014|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/n-w-t-mlas-vote-to-ask-for-authority-to-postpone-election-1.2568208|title=N.W.T.
