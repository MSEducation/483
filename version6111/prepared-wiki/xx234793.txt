John Barnard (fl. 1625-1649), English musician, was a minor canon of St Paul's Cathedral in the reign of Charles I. 
He was the first to publish a collection of English cathedral music. It contains some of the finest 16th-century masterpieces, ranging from the "faux-bourdon" style of Thomas Tallis's Preces and Responses to the most developed types of full anthem. The text, however, is not trustworthy.[tpl]sfn|Chisholm|1911[/tpl]
