Lord of Lorne is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created twice. First it was created for Robert Stewart, son of John Stewart, ambassador to the English king, by a daughter of Eoghan de Ergadia, Laird of Latharna. He was succeeded by his oldest son John, member of the Scottish Parliament. In 1463 the second lord died and his younger brother William became 3rd Lord Lorne. William Stewart resigned the lordship on 30 November 1463 and was created 1st Lord Innermeath on the same day. The next creation was for Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll, the husband of Isabelle Stewart, daughter of John Stewart, 2nd Lord Lorne and niece of William Stewart, 1st Lord Innermeath, in 1470.
The Mormaerdom or Kingdom of Lorne was a lordship in High Medieval Scotland.
