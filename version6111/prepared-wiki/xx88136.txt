[[List of State Roads in Indiana]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in Indiana, Lists of roads in Indiana

State Roads in the US state of Indiana are numbered rationally: in general, odd one-digit and two-digit highways are north-south highways, numbers increasing toward the west; even one-digit and two-digit highways are east-west highways, numbers increasing toward the south, the opposite of the United States Interstate System.
Three-digit routes are related, as a rule, to the single-digit or two-digit parent US or State route; thus State Road 205 is related to State Road 5 and State Road 120 is related to U.S. Route 20.
Exceptions to this system are 37, 47, 56, 57, 62, and 67, diagonal routes, the defunct "100" beltline around Indianapolis, State Road 135, which acts like a two-digit state highway, and both State Road 149 and State Road 249, which are arterial between State Road 49 and State Road 51. Another exception to the system is Indiana 265. This road is a two-mile extension that exists between Interstate 265 and Interstate 65 and is over 100 miles east of either Indiana 65 or Indiana 165, both located in Southwestern Indiana near Evansville.
The numbers of several important U.S. Highway routes that pass through Indiana are not used as Indiana route numbers:  these include 6, 12, 20, 24, 27, 30, 31, 33, 35, 36, 40, 41, 50, and 52.  U.S. 40, in fact, roughly corresponds in location to where "Indiana 40" would be; Indiana 38 is north of it and Indiana 42 is south of it.  U.S. 6 is located similarly, and, in fact, follows the general course of former Indiana State Road 6."State Road 6". Indiana Highway Ends website."US 6". Indiana Highway Ends website.
