Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice is a 2004 album by the black metal band Deathspell Omega. The album title is Latin for 'If you seek his monument, look around you', from the epitaph of Christopher Wren's tomb at St Paul's Cathedral.The text on Wren's tomb is "Si monumentum requiris, circumspice", where requiris is active indicative second person singular present of the Latin word requiro ('I seek'); the form requires is the future tense form of that word.
Musically, it represents a massive departure in sound from the band's previous work, both for the increase in recording quality and for the pursuit of far more avant-garde and experimental directions than the band's previous work. The album is also intentionally structured in the manner of 1970s double albums, with each LP side opening with a "prayer" (side four, which opens with "Carnal Malefactor", being an arguable exception).
The track "Malign Paradigm" is a tribute to the Swedish black metal band Malign, and their track "Ashes and Bloodstench".[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] "Drink the Devil's Blood" is a re-recording of a song of the same title appearing on the band's first album, Infernal Battles. The re-interpretation of this station contains completely new lyrics dealing with a Eucharistic theme, in keeping with the more cerebral lyrical approach of this and subsequent releases.
Si Monumentum (the title is written both with u's and v's in the packaging of various editions that have been released) is the first entry in a metaphysical trilogy the band released dealing with the relationship between God, Satan, and man. The second and third entries are Fas â€“ Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum (2007) and Paracletus (2010).
