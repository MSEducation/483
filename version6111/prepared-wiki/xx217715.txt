==History==

Knin is first mentioned in the 10th-century history of Constantine Porphyrogenitus as the centre of a parish. In the 11th century, at the request of King Peter Krešimir IV of Croatia, it became an episcopal see, whose bishop seems to have been attached to the royal court as preacher. A history of the successive bishops, from Mark in 1050 to Joseph in 1755 is given in Forlani's Illyricum sacrum, IV (Venice, 1775). The bishops who held the title no longer resided in Knin after it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1522. After Venice captured the district in 1768, the Bishop of Šibenik was appointed to administer the diocese.Andrew MacErlean, "Tinin" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1912) With the papal bull Locum beati Petri of 20 June 1828, when the whole of Dalmatia belonged to the Austrian Empire, Pope Leo XII made the diocese part of that of Šibenik.
