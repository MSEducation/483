</ref> Pelosi emphasized that "a strong relationship between the [[Israel – United States relations|United States and Israel]] has long been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. America's commitment to the safety and security of the State of Israel is unwavering,...[h]owever, the [[war in Iraq]] has made both America and Israel less safe." Pelosi's voting record shows consistent support for Israel. Prior to 2006 elections in the Palestinian Authority, she voted for a Congressional initiative disapproving of participation in the elections by [[Hamas]] and other organizations defined as terrorist by the legislation. She agrees with the current U.S. stance in support of land-for-peace. She has applauded Israeli "hopeful signs" of offering land, while criticizing Palestinian "threats" of not demonstrating peace in turn. She states, "If the Palestinians agree to coordinate with Israel on the evacuation, establish the rule of law, and demonstrate a capacity to govern, the world may be convinced that finally there is a real partner for peace".<ref name="onIsrael" />
During the 2006 Lebanon War, Pelosi voted in favor of Resolution 921 on the count that "the seizure of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah terrorists was an unprovoked attack and Israel has the right, and indeed the obligation, to respond". She argues that organizations and political bodies in the Mideast like Hamas and Hezbollah "have a greater interest in maintaining a state of hostility with Israel than in improving the lives of the people they claim to represent". Pelosi asserts that civilians on both sides of the border "have been put at risk by the aggression of Hamas and Hezbollah" in part for their use of "civilians as shields by concealing weapons in civilian areas".[tpl]cite news|title=Pelosi Floor Statement on House Resolution Reaffirming Support for Israel|author=|url=http://www.newswest9.com/story/5173845/pelosi-floor-statement-on-house-resolution-reaffirming-support-for-israel|newspaper=News West 9|date=July 19, 2006|accessdate=August 4, 2013[/tpl]
In September 2008, Pelosi hosted a reception in Washington with Israeli Knesset speaker Dalia Itzik, along with 20 members of Congress, where they toasted the "strong friendship" between Israel and the United States. During the ceremony, Pelosi held up the replica dog tags of the three Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah and Hamas in 2006 and stated that she keeps them as a "symbol of the sacrifices made, sacrifices far too great by the people of the state of Israel".[tpl]cite news|title=Two speakers toast to U.S.-Israel friendship|author=|url=http://www.jta.org/2008/09/18/news-opinion/two-speakers-toast-to-u-s-israel-friendship|newspaper=JTA|date=September 18, 2008|accessdate=August 4, 2013[/tpl]
