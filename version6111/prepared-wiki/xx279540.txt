==Life==

Raised in Palo Alto, California, Mulligan attended Henry M. Gunn High School. He graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1979 with a bachelor's degree in computer science.[tpl]Cite web |title= Geoff Mulligan / Sun Microsystems |work= Internet Town Hall web site archives |url= http://town.hall.org/trendy/sipp/sipp-bio/mulligan.html |accessdate= 15 November 2013 [/tpl] 
While in the Air Force, he worked on the ARPAnet.[tpl]cite news |last= Dodson |first= Sean |title=The Net Shapes Up to Get Physical |date= 15 October 2008 |url= http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/oct/16/internet-of-things-ipv6 |accessdate= 15 November 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian[/tpl] 
The ARPAnet evolved into the Defense Data Network, where he worked on security and performance and also designed and directed installation of the Pentagon data networks that used cable TV technology.[tpl]Citation needed |date= November 2013[/tpl]
Mulligan returned to the Air Force Academy, where he oversaw the design and installation of the Academy's local area network, FALCONnet. During this assignment, he earned his Master's degree in computer information sciences at the University of Denver and taught at the Air Force Academy, University of Denver, Webster University, and Chapman College.[tpl]Citation needed |date= November 2013[/tpl]
In 1990, Mulligan joined Digital Equipment Corporation in Palo Alto. He focused on network security, electronic mail, TCP/IP networking, networking tools and firewall technology. He worked on the DEC SEAL firewall with Marcus J. Ranum,[tpl]cite web |title= The Ultimate Firewall |work= Personal web site |author= Marcus J. Ranum |url= http://www.ranum.com/fun/bsu/ultimatefirewall/index.html#fwrefs |accessdate= 15 November 2013 [/tpl] and on the IPv6 protocol working group.[tpl]cite web |last=Mulligan|first=Geoff |title= IP and 802.15.4: To v6 or not to v6 |url= http://roland.grc.nasa.gov/~ivancic/hidden/shared/v6%20Seminar.ppt |publisher= Invensys Controls |year= 2005 |accessdate= 15 November 2013 [/tpl]
Mulligan began working at Sun Microsystems in 1992. He developed and maintained the Solaris TCP/IP utilities and kernel.  He also worked on Sun's wide area network and firewall complex. He continued with the IPv6 design team and wrote a PC-based implementation, along with a packet decoder, and worked on the development of an IPv4/IPv6 border gateway. He was the principal architect of Sun's firewall product, Sunscreen SPF 100.[tpl]cite web|title=SensorsCon 2013 Committee|url=http://www.sensorscon.org/English/Conference/Organizing_Committee.html|publisher=SensorsCon|accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl]
Mulligan further developed Sunscreen, adding network address translation and topology hiding technologies.[tpl]cite web|last=Mulligan|first=Geoff|title=Security Through Containment: A White Paper|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1997_hr/h970211gm.htm|accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl]    In 1997, he created HZ.COM, an electronic mail information retrieval system for two-way pagers and early cellular phones.  When the HZ.COM domain was hijacked in 2002, the incident was featured in the International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) Security and Stability Advisory Committee's report of 2005.[tpl]cite web|title=Domain Name Hijacking: Incidents, Threats, Risks and Remedial Actions|url=http://archive.icann.org/en/announcements/hijacking-report-12jul05.pdf|work=SSAC|publisher=ICANN|accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl]  He left Sun to co-found Geocast Network Systems,[tpl]cite web|title=Geocast Network Systems, Inc.|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=27629|publisher=Harvard Business School Case Collection, November 2000[/tpl] where he was responsible for operating system design and support, as well as network architecture for the evolving Internet multicast communication technology that the company was developing.[tpl]cite web|title=RMIUG Meeting Minutes|url=http://www.rmiug.org/html/minutes/2000/min_2000_09_12.html|work=SPAMFest 2000|publisher=RMIUG|accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl]  Following Geocast, Mulligan co-founded Interosa as chief technology officer and, subsequently, chief executive. Interosa was building a new policy-based privacy technology for digital content and an email privacy system[tpl]cite web|title=Email Security Products|url=http://www.infosec-associates.com/framework/email-security-products.html|accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl] that was based on their new technology.[tpl]cite web|last=Fitzgerald|first=Michael|title=InteRosa Takes a Stab at Secure Email|url=http://www.infosec-associates.com/framework/email-security-products.html|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl] The company was shut down in November 2000.[tpl]Citation needed |date= November 2013[/tpl]
In 2001, Mulligan was hired by Invensys as the chief scientist for the Home Controls Division, where he worked on resource and energy management technology, including home gateway design and development, web-based tools, and low-power, low-speed, low-cost wireless networks such as the IEEE 802.15 standards marketed with the Zigbee trademark. Invensys worked on a project to put wireless IPv6 communications in smoke alarms and appliances.[tpl]cite web |last= Titus |first=Jon |title= 6LoWPAN Goes Where Zigbee Can't |date= 12 February 2009 |url= http://www.ecnmag.com/articles/2009/02/6lowpan-goes-where-zigbee-cant |work= ECN Magazine |accessdate=1 July 2013[/tpl]
He was one of the founding board members of the Zigbee Alliance[tpl]cite web|last=Mulligan|first=Geoff|title=The Wireless Lucky Number|url=http://www.intelligentbuildingstoday.com/Articles/Feature_Article/090df7e7cf34b010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0|accessdate=1 July 2013[/tpl] and was co-chair of the 6LoWPAN Working Group in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).[tpl]cite web|title=IPv6 Over Low Power WPAN (6LoWPAN)|url=http://www6.ietf.org/dyn/wg/charter/history/6lowpan.2009-05-26.12.html|publisher=IETF|accessdate=1 July 2013[/tpl]  He says he wrote the first embedded IPv6 implementation and created and named 6LoWPAN. In 2006, he started the consulting firm Proto6, where he worked for companies and the US Department of Defense.
Mulligan worked with others to begin the Internet Protocol for Smart Objects (IPSO) Alliance in 2008.
He was chairman for the Alliance until 2013.
In June 2013, Mulligan became one of the second round of Presidential Innovation Fellows, working at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).[tpl]cite web|last=Boutin |first=Chad |title=Three Presedential Innovation Fellows Begin Work at NIST |work= Press release |url= http://www.nist.gov/el/pif-062513.cfm |publisher=NIST |date= 25 June 2013 |accessdate= 15 November 2013 [/tpl]

==Works==

Mulligan holds over 15 patents in computer security, networking and electronic mail.
In 1999, he wrote "Removing the Spam: Email Processing and Filtering".[tpl]cite web|last=Mulligan|first=Geoff|title=Removing the Spam|url=http://www.allbookstores.com/Removing-Spam-Email-Processing-Filtering/9780201379570[/tpl]  The book explains the operation and management of two widely distributed Unix e-mail tools: Sendmail and Procmail.

==Congressional testimony==

In 1997, Mulligan testified before Congress on electronic commerce and computer security. The Committee on Science held a briefing on Secure Communications in February, which was the second in a series of briefings on computer security. The theme of the briefing was the need to protect the confidential nature of private communications and to ensure that stored proprietary data remains uncompromised.[tpl]cite web|title=Briefing on Secure Communications|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/congress/1997_hr/h970211a.htm|work=US House of Representatives|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=1 July 2013[/tpl]  He spoke on "Security Through Containment", explaining how networks are designed and built to facilitate the sharing and distribution of data and information, while the goal of security is to limit and control the distribution of information. One method for providing both connectivity and security is through the use of containment.[tpl]cite web|last=Mulligan|first=Geoff|title=Security Through Containment|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/congress/1997_hr/h970211gm.htm|accessdate=1 July 2013[/tpl]
