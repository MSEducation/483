[[Dardanelles (EP)]]

CATEGORIES: 2006 EPs, Debut EPs

Dardanelles is the debut EP by Melbourne based Indie rock band  Dardanelles released in November 2004.

==Background==

Following 12 months of touring to critical recognition from both fans and the music press, Dardanelles set out to record a few demos, which ended up being released as an EP. Two singles were taken from it, Origami Tree and Of Course You Said respectively, both of which underwent the remix knife. Origami Tree received a remix by Melbourne electro DJ "Acid Jacks" and another Australian DJ "Riot in Belgium" remixing Of Course You Said. The success of the EP garnered them enough funds to head back in the studio to record their debut album  Mirror Mirror.
