[[Celtos]]

CATEGORIES: Miniatures games

Celtos is a warband level fantasy miniatures wargame developed by Urban Mammoth, now owned by Brigade Models.

==Inspiration==

As the name suggests, Celtos is inspired primarily by Celtic, specifically Insular Celtic, myth and legendary. Four of the factions have overtly Celtic names - Sidhe, Gaels, Fir Bolg, and Fomorians - whereas the fifth goes by the Scandinavian Vanir.
