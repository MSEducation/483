 That same year, 1799, an all-platinum kilogram [[#Glossary|prototype]] was fabricated with the objective that it would equal, as close as was scientifically feasible for the day, the mass of one cubic decimeter of water at 4[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]°C. The prototype was presented to the Archives of the Republic in June and on 10[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]December 1799, the prototype was formally ratified as the ''kilogramme des Archives'' (Kilogram of the Archives) and the kilogram was defined as being equal to its mass. This standard stood for the next ninety years.

==International prototype kilogram==

Since 1889 the magnitude of the kilogram has been defined as the mass of an object called the international prototype kilogram, often referred to in the professional metrology world as the "IPK". The IPK is made of a platinum alloy known as “Pt[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]10Ir”, which is 90% platinum and 10% iridium (by mass) and is machined into a right-circular cylinder (height = diameter) of 39.17[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]millimeters to minimize its surface area.[tpl]cite journal|title=New Techniques in the Manufacture of Platinum-Iridium Mass Standards |author=T. J. Quinn |journal=Platinum Metals Review |year=1986 |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=74–79[/tpl] The addition of 10% iridium improved upon the all-platinum Kilogram of the Archives by greatly increasing hardness while still retaining platinum’s many virtues: extreme resistance to oxidation, extremely high density (almost twice as dense as lead and more than 21 times as dense as water), satisfactory electrical and thermal conductivities, and low magnetic susceptibility. The IPK and its six sister copies are stored at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (known by its French-language initials BIPM) in an environmentally monitored safe in the lower vault located in the basement of the BIPM’s Pavillon de Breteuil in Sèvres on the outskirts of Paris (see External images, below, for photographs). Three independently controlled keys are required to open the vault. Official copies of the IPK were made available to other nations to serve as their national standards. These are compared to the IPK roughly every 40 years, thereby providing traceability of local measurements back to the IPK.The International Bureau of Weights and Measures official site: Verifications, retrieved 4 August 2013
The Metre Convention was signed on 20 May 1875 and further formalized the metric system (a predecessor to the SI), quickly leading to the production of the IPK. The IPK is one of three cylinders made in 1879 by Johnson Matthey, which continues to manufacture nearly all of the national prototypes today.F.J. Smith. "Standard Kilogram Weights." Platinum Metals Rev. 17.2 (1973)Terry Quinn. From Artefacts to Atoms: The BIPM and the Search for Ultimate Measurement Standards. Oxford University Press. p. 321. In 1883, the mass of the IPK was found to be indistinguishable from that of the Kilogramme des Archives  made eighty-four years prior, and was formally ratified as the kilogram by the 1st CGPM in 1889.
Modern measurements of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water, which is pure distilled water with an isotopic composition representative of the average of the world’s oceans, show it has a density of [tpl]nowrap|[tpl]val|fmt=commas|0.999975[/tpl] ±[tpl]val|fmt=commas|0.000001[/tpl] kg/L[/tpl] at its point of maximum density (3.984 °C) under one standard atmosphere (760 torr) of pressure.Isotopic composition and temperature per London South Bank University’s “List of physicochemical data concerning water”, density and uncertainty per NIST Standard Reference Database Number 69 (Retrieved 2010-04-05) Thus, a cubic decimeter of water at its point of maximum density is only 25 parts per million less massive than the IPK; that is to say, the 25 milligram difference shows that the scientists over [tpl]age|1799|1|1[/tpl] years ago managed to make the mass of the Kilogram of the Archives equal that of a cubic decimeter of water at 4 °C, with a margin of error at most within the mass of a single excess grain of rice.

===Copies of the international prototype kilogram===

The various copies of the international prototype kilogram are given the following designations in the literature:

===Stability of the international prototype kilogram===

By definition, the error in the measured value of the IPK's mass is exactly zero; the IPK is the kilogram. However, any changes in the IPK's mass over time can be deduced by comparing its mass to that of its official copies stored throughout the world, a rarely-undertaken process called "periodic verification". The only three verifications occurred in 1889, 1948, and 1989. For instance, the U.S. owns four [tpl]nowrap|90% platinum /[/tpl] 10%[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]iridium (Pt[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]10Ir) kilogram standards, two of which, K4 and K20, are from the original batch of 40 replicas delivered in 1884.The other two Pt[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]10Ir standards owned by the U.S. are K79, from a new series of prototypes [tpl]nowrap|(K64–K80)[/tpl] that were diamond-turned directly to a finish mass, and K85, which is used for watt balance experiments (see Watt balance, above). The K20 prototype was designated as the primary national standard of mass for the U.S.  Both of these, as well as those from other nations, are periodically returned to the BIPM for verification.Extraordinary care is exercised when transporting prototypes. In 1984, the K4 and K20 prototypes were hand-carried in the passenger section of separate commercial airliners.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]
Note that none of the replicas has a mass precisely equal to that of the IPK; their masses are calibrated and documented as offset values. For instance, K20, the U.S.'s primary standard, originally had an official mass of [tpl]nowrap|1 kg − 39[/tpl] micrograms (μg) in 1889; that is to say, K20 was 39[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg less than the IPK. A verification performed in 1948 showed a mass of [tpl]nowrap|1 kg − 19 µg.[/tpl] The latest verification performed in 1999 shows a mass precisely identical to its original 1889 value. Quite unlike transient variations such as this, the U.S.'s check standard, K4, has persistently declined in mass relative to the IPK—and for an identifiable reason. Check standards are used much more often than primary standards and are prone to scratches and other wear. K4 was originally delivered with an official mass of [tpl]nowrap|1 kg − 75 µg[/tpl] in 1889, but as of 1989 was officially calibrated at [tpl]nowrap|1 kg − 106 µg[/tpl] and ten years later was [tpl]nowrap|1 kg − 116 µg.[/tpl] Over a period of 110 years, K4 lost 41[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg relative to the IPK.[tpl]Cite journal |title=The Kilogram and Measurements of Mass and Force|author1=Z.J. Jabbour |author2=S.L. Yaniv |journal=J. Res. Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. |volume=106 |issue=1 |date=Jan–Feb 2001 |pages=25–46 |url=http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/106/1/j61jab.pdf 3.5 |doi=10.6028/jres.106.003[/tpl]
Beyond the simple wear that check standards can experience, the mass of even the carefully stored national prototypes can drift relative to the IPK for a variety of reasons, some known and some unknown. Since the IPK and its replicas are stored in air (albeit under two or more nested bell jars), they gain mass through adsorption of atmospheric contamination onto their surfaces. Accordingly, they are cleaned in a process the BIPM developed between 1939 and 1946 known as "the BIPM cleaning method" that comprises lightly rubbing with a chamois soaked in equal parts ether and ethanol, followed by steam cleaning with bi-distilled water, and allowing the prototypes to settle for [tpl]nowrap|7–10[/tpl] days before verification.Before the BIPM's published report in 1994 detailing the relative change in mass of the prototypes, different standard bodies used different techniques to clean their prototypes. The NIST's practice before then was to soak and rinse its two prototypes first in benzene, then in ethanol, and to then clean them with a jet of bi-distilled water steam.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl] Cleaning the prototypes removes between 5 and 60[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg of contamination depending largely on the time elapsed since the last cleaning. Further, a second cleaning can remove up to 10[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg more. After cleaning—even when they are stored under their bell jars—the IPK and its replicas immediately begin gaining mass again. The BIPM even developed a model of this gain and concluded that it averaged 1.11[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg per month for the first 3 months after cleaning and then decreased to an average of about 1[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg per year thereafter. Since check standards like K4 are not cleaned for routine calibrations of other mass standards—a precaution to minimize the potential for wear and handling damage—the BIPM's model of time-dependent mass gain has been used as an "after cleaning" correction factor.
Because the first forty official copies are made of the same alloy as the IPK and are stored under similar conditions, periodic verifications using a large number of replicas—especially the national primary standards, which are rarely used—can convincingly demonstrate the stability of the IPK. What has become clear after the third periodic verification performed between 1988 and 1992 is that masses of the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes have been slowly but inexorably diverging from each other. It is also clear that the mass of the IPK lost perhaps 50[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg over the last century, and possibly significantly more, in comparison to its official copies.

The reason for this drift has eluded physicists who have dedicated their careers to the SI unit of mass. No plausible mechanism has been proposed to explain either a steady decrease in the mass of the IPK, or an increase in that of its replicas dispersed throughout the world.
Note that if the [tpl]nowrap|50 µg[/tpl] difference between the IPK and its replicas was entirely due to wear, the IPK would have to have lost 150 million billion more platinum and iridium atoms over the last century than its replicas. That there would be this much wear, much less a difference of this magnitude, is thought unlikely; 50[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg is roughly the mass of a fingerprint. Specialists at the BIPM in 1946 carefully conducted cleaning experiments and concluded that even vigorous rubbing with a chamois—if done carefully—did not alter the prototypes’ mass. More recent cleaning experiments at the BIPM, which were conducted on one particular prototype (K63), and which benefited from the then-new NBS[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]2 balance, demonstrated 2[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg stability. Many theories have been advanced to explain the divergence in the masses of the prototypes. One theory posits that the relative change in mass between the IPK and its replicas is not one of loss at all and is instead a simple matter that the IPK has gained less than the replicas. This theory begins with the observation that the IPK is uniquely stored under three nested bell jars whereas its six sister copies stored alongside it in the vault as well as the other replicas dispersed throughout the world are stored under only two. This theory is also founded on two other facts: that platinum has a strong affinity for mercury, and that atmospheric mercury is significantly more abundant in the atmosphere today than at the time the IPK and its replicas were manufactured. The burning of coal is a major contributor to atmospheric mercury and both Denmark and Germany have high coal shares in electrical generation. Conversely, electrical generation in France, where the IPK is stored, is mostly nuclear. This theory is supported by the fact that the mass divergence rate—relative to the IPK—of Denmark’s prototype, K48, since it took possession in 1949 is an especially high 78 µg per century while that of Germany’s prototype has been even greater at [tpl]nowrap|126 µg/century[/tpl] ever since it took possession of K55 in 1954. However, still other data for other replicas isn’t supportive of this theory. This mercury absorption theory is just one of many advanced by the specialists to account for the relative change in mass. To date, each theory has either proven implausible, or there are insufficient data or technical means to either prove or disprove it.[tpl]Cite journal |title=The SI unit of mass |url=http://charm.physics.ucsb.edu/courses/ph21_05/kilogrampaper.pdf |first=Richard |last=Davis |journal=Metrologia |volume=40 |issue=6 |date=December 2003 |pages=299–305 |doi= 10.1088/0026-1394/40/6/001 |accessdate=2009-11-25|bibcode = 2003Metro..40..299D [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |title=Recalibration of the U.S. National Prototype Kilogram |author=R.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]S.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]Davis |journal=Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards |volume=90 |issue=4 |month=July–August |year=1985 |url=http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/090/4/V90-4.pdf[/tpl]Conjecture why the IPK drifts, R.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]Steiner, NIST, 11 Sep 2007.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl] 
This relative nature of the changes amongst the world's kilogram prototypes is often misreported in the popular press, and even some notable scientific magazines, which often state that the IPK simply "lost 50[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg" and omit the very important caveat of "in comparison to its official copies".
Even well respected organizations incorrectly represent the relative nature of the mass divergence as being one of mass loss, as exemplified by this site at Science Daily, and this site at PhysOrg.com, and this site at Sandia National Laboratories. The root of the problem is often the reporters' failure to correctly interpret or paraphrase nuanced scientific concepts, as exemplified by this 12[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]September 2007 story by the Associated Press published on PhysOrg.com. In that AP story, Richard Davis—who used to be the NIST's kilogram specialist and now works for the BIPM in France—was correctly quoted by the AP when he stated that the mass change is a relative issue. Then the AP summarized the nature of issue with this lead-in to the story: "A kilogram just isn't what it used to be. The 118-year-old cylinder that is the international prototype for the metric mass, kept tightly under lock and key outside Paris, is mysteriously losing weight — if ever so slightly". Like many of the above-linked sites, the AP also misreported the age of the IPK, using the date of its adoption as the mass prototype, not the date of the cylinder’s manufacture. This is a mistake even Scientific American fell victim to in a print edition.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl] 
Moreover, there are no technical means available to determine whether or not the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes suffers from even greater long-term trends upwards or downwards because their mass "relative to an invariant of nature is unknown at a level below 1000[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg over a period of 100 or even 50 years". Given the lack of data identifying which of the world’s kilogram prototypes has been most stable in absolute terms, it is equally valid to state that the first batch of replicas has, as a group, gained an average of about 25[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg over one hundred years in comparison to the IPK.The mean change in mass of the first batch of replicas relative to the IPK over one hundred years is +23.5[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg with a standard deviation of 30[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg. Per The Third Periodic Verification of National Prototypes of the Kilogram [tpl]nowrap|(1988–1992),[/tpl] G.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]Girard, Metrologia 31 (1994) Pg.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]323, Table[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]3.

This is a larger data set than is shown in the chart at the top of this section, which corresponds to Figure[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]7 of G.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]Girard’s paper.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]
What is known specifically about the IPK is that it exhibits a short-term instability of about 30[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg over a period of about a month in its after-cleaned mass.Report to the CGPM, 14th meeting of the Consultative Committee for Units (CCU), April 2001, 2. (ii); General Conference on Weights and Measures, 22nd Meeting, October 2003, which stated “The kilogram is in need of a new definition because the mass of the prototype is known to vary by several parts in 108 over periods of time of the order of a month…” (3.2[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]MB ZIP file, here).[tpl]nbsp[/tpl] 
The precise reason for this short-term instability is not understood but is thought to entail surface effects: microscopic differences between the prototypes' polished surfaces, possibly aggravated by hydrogen absorption due to catalysis of the volatile organic compounds that slowly deposit onto the prototypes as well as the hydrocarbon-based solvents used to clean them.BBC, Getting the measure of a kilogram.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]
It has been possible to rule out many explanations of the observed divergences in the masses of the world's prototypes proposed by scientists and the general public. The BIPM's FAQ explains, for example, that the divergence is dependent on the amount of time elapsed between measurements and not dependent on the number of times the artifacts have been cleaned or possible changes in gravity or environment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/mass/faqs2_mass.html |title=FAQs |publisher=BIPM |accessdate=2011-04-03[/tpl] Reports published in 2013 by Peter Cumpson of Newcastle University based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of samples that were stored alongside various prototype kilograms suggested that one source of the divergence between the various prototypes could be traced to mercury that had been absorbed by the prototypes being in the proximity of mercury-based  instruments. The IPK has been stored within centimetres of a mercury thermometer since at least as far back as the late 1980s.[tpl]Cite journal |title=Stability of reference masses: VI.

Scientists are seeing far greater variability in the prototypes than previously believed. The increasing divergence in the masses of the world’s prototypes and the short-term instability in the IPK has prompted research into improved methods to obtain a smooth surface finish using diamond turning on newly manufactured replicas and has intensified the search for a new definition of the kilogram.

==Importance of the kilogram==

The stability of the IPK is crucial because the kilogram underpins much of the SI system of measurement as it is currently defined and structured. For instance, the newton is defined as the force necessary to accelerate one kilogram at one meter per second squared. If the mass of the IPK were to change slightly, so too must the newton by a proportional degree. In turn, the pascal, the SI unit of pressure, is defined in terms of the newton. This chain of dependency follows to many other SI units of measure. For instance, the joule, the SI unit of energy, is defined as that expended when a force of one newton acts through one metre. Next to be affected is the SI unit of power, the watt, which is one joule per second. The ampere too is defined relative to the newton, and ultimately, the kilogram. With the magnitude of the primary units of electricity thus determined by the kilogram, so too follow many others; namely, the coulomb, volt, tesla, and weber.  Even units used in the measure of light would be affected; the candela—following the change in the [tpl]nowrap|watt—[/tpl]would in turn affect the lumen and[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]lux.
Because the magnitude of many of the units comprising the SI system of measurement is ultimately defined by the mass of a [tpl]age|1879|1|1[/tpl]-year-old, golf ball-sized piece of metal, the quality of the IPK must be diligently protected to preserve the integrity of the SI system. Yet, despite the best stewardship, the average mass of the worldwide ensemble of prototypes and the mass of the IPK have likely diverged another [tpl]days elapsed times factor|1989|7|1|0.0006434|1[/tpl][tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg since the third periodic verification [tpl]age|1989|1|1[/tpl][tpl]nbsp[/tpl]years ago.Assuming the past trend continues, whereby the mean change in mass of the first batch of replicas relative to the IPK over one hundred years was +23.5[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]σ30[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl] Further, the world’s national metrology laboratories must wait for the fourth periodic verification to confirm whether the historical trends[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]persisted.
Fortunately, definitions of the SI units are quite different from their practical realizations. For instance, the meter is defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum during a time interval of [tpl]frac|299,792,458[/tpl] of a second. However, the meter’s practical realization typically takes the form of a helium–neon laser, and the meter’s length is delineated—not defined—as [tpl]val|fmt=commas|1579800.298728[/tpl] wavelengths of light from this laser. Now suppose that the official measurement of the second was found to have drifted by a few parts per billion (it is actually extremely stable with a reproducibility of a few parts in 1015). There would be no automatic effect on the meter because the second—and thus the meter’s length—is abstracted via the laser comprising the meter’s practical realization. Scientists performing meter calibrations would simply continue to measure out the same number of laser wavelengths until an agreement was reached to do otherwise. The same is true with regard to the real-world dependency on the kilogram: if the mass of the IPK was found to have changed slightly, there would be no automatic effect upon the other units of measure because their practical realizations provide an insulating layer of abstraction. Any discrepancy would eventually have to be reconciled though, because the virtue of the SI system is its precise mathematical and logical harmony amongst its units. If the IPK’s value were definitively proven to have changed, one solution would be to simply redefine the kilogram as being equal to the mass of the IPK plus an offset value, similarly to what is currently done with its replicas; e.g., “the kilogram is equal to the mass of the [tpl]nowrap|IPK + 42 parts per billion”[/tpl] (equivalent to 42[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg).
The long-term solution to this problem, however, is to liberate the SI system’s dependency on the IPK by developing a practical realization of the kilogram that can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. The units of measure in such a practical realization would have their magnitudes precisely defined and expressed in terms of fundamental physical constants. While major portions of the SI system would still be based on the kilogram, the kilogram would in turn be based on invariant, universal constants of nature. Much work towards that end is ongoing, though no alternative has yet achieved the uncertainty of 20 parts per billion (~20[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg) required to improve upon the IPK. However, [tpl]as of|2007|4|lc=on[/tpl], the U.S.’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) had an implementation of the watt balance that was approaching this goal, with a demonstrated uncertainty of 36[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg.Uncertainty Improvements of the NIST Electronic Kilogram, RL Steiner et al., Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on, 56 Issue 2, April 2007, [tpl]nowrap|592–596[/tpl][tpl]nbsp[/tpl] See Watt[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]balance, below.
The avoirdupois pound, used in both the imperial system and U.S. customary units, is defined as exactly [tpl]val|fmt=commas|0.45359237|u=kg[/tpl],
making one kilogram approximately equal to 2.2046 avoirdupois pounds. Although both the avoirdupois (or international) pound and the kilogram are units of mass and have related units of force the pound-force and the kilogram-force, the kilogram-force is seldom used.

==Proposed future definitions==

As of 2014 the kilogram was the only SI unit still defined by an artifact. In 1960 the meter, having previously also been defined by reference to an artifact (a single platinum-iridium bar with two marks on it) was redefined in terms of invariant, fundamental physical constants (the wavelength of a particular emission of light emitted by krypton,[tpl]SIbrochure8th|page=112[/tpl] and later the speed of light) so that the standard can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. At the 94th Meeting of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (2005) it was recommended that the same be done with the kilogram.
In October 2010, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (known by its French-language initials CIPM) voted to submit a resolution for consideration at the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM), to "take note of an intention" that the kilogram be defined in terms of the Planck constant, h (which has dimensions of energy times time) together with other fundamental units.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/20101026_si.cfm |title=NIST Backs Proposal for a Revamped System of Measurement Units |publisher=Nist.gov |accessdate=2011-04-03[/tpl] This resolution was accepted by the 24th conference of the CGPM in October 2011 and in addition the date of the 25th conference was moved forward from 2015 to 2014. Such a definition would theoretically permit any apparatus that was capable of delineating the kilogram in terms of the Planck constant to be used as long as it possessed sufficient precision, accuracy and stability. The watt balance (discussed below) may be able to do this.
In the project to replace the last artifact that underpins much of the International System of Units (SI), a variety of other very different technologies and approaches were considered and explored over many years. They too are covered below. Some of these now-abandoned approaches were based on equipment and procedures that would have enabled the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand (albeit with extraordinary effort) using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, fundamental constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and which expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to fundamental constants. All approaches depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass, and therefore require the precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories. All approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at a defined value.

===The watt balance===

The watt balance is essentially a single-pan weighing scale that measures the electric power necessary to oppose the weight of a kilogram test mass as it is pulled by Earth’s gravity. It is a variation of an ampere balance in that it employs an extra calibration step that nulls the effect of geometry. The electric potential in the watt balance is delineated by a Josephson voltage standard, which allows voltage to be linked to an invariant constant of nature with extremely high precision and stability. Its circuit resistance is calibrated against a quantum Hall resistance standard.
The watt balance requires exquisitely precise measurement of the local gravitational acceleration g in the laboratory, using a gravimeter. (See "FG‑5 absolute gravimeter" in External images, below). For instance, the NIST compensates for Earth’s gravity gradient of 309[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µGal per meter when the elevation of the center of the gravimeter differs from that of the nearby test mass in the watt balance; a change in the weight of a one-kilogram test mass that equates to about 316[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg/m.
In April 2007, the NIST’s implementation of the watt balance demonstrated a combined relative standard uncertainty (CRSU) of 36[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg and a short-term resolution of [tpl]nowrap|10–15[/tpl][tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg.The combined relative standard uncertainty  (CRSU) of these measurements, as with all other tolerances and uncertainties in this article unless otherwise noted, have a 1σ standard deviation, which equates to a confidence level of about 68%; that is to say, 68% of the measurements fall within the stated tolerance. The UK’s National Physical Laboratory’s watt balance demonstrated a CRSU of 70.3[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg in 2007."An initial measurement of Planck's constant using the NPL Mark II watt balance", I.A. Robinson et al., Metrologia 44 (2007), [tpl]nowrap|427–440;[/tpl] NPL: NPL Watt Balance That watt balance was disassembled and shipped in 2009 to Canada’s Institute for National Measurement Standards (part of the National Research Council), where research and development with the device could continue.
If the CGPM adopts the new proposal and the new definition of the kilogram becomes part of the SI, the value in SI units of the Planck constant (h), which is a measure that relates the energy of photons to their frequency, would be precisely fixed (the currently accepted value of [tpl]physconst|h[/tpl] has an uncertainty of ± about 1 in 23 million).The Planck constant's unit of measure, the joule-second (J·s), may perhaps be more easily understood when expressed as a joule per hertz (J/Hz). Universally, an individual photon has an energy that is proportional to its frequency. This relationship is [tpl]physconst|h|unit=no|ref=no|after= J/Hz.[/tpl] Once agreed upon internationally, the kilogram would no longer be defined as the mass of the IPK. All the remaining units in the International System of Units (the SI) that today have dependencies upon the kilogram and the joule would also fall in place, their magnitudes ultimately defined, in part, in terms of photon oscillations rather than the IPK.
Gravity and the nature of the watt balance, which oscillates test masses up and down against the local gravitational acceleration g, are exploited so that mechanical power is compared against electrical power, which is the square of voltage divided by electrical resistance. However, g varies significantly—by nearly 1%—depending on where on the Earth's surface the measurement is made (see Earth’s gravity ). There are also slight seasonal variations in g due to changes in underground water tables, and larger semimonthly and diurnal changes due to tidal distortions in the Earth's shape caused by the Moon. Although g would not be a term in the definition of the kilogram, it would be crucial in the delineation[tpl]clarifyme|date=March 2014[/tpl] of the kilogram when relating energy to power. Accordingly, g must be measured with at least as much precision and accuracy as are the other terms, so measurements of g must also be traceable to fundamental constants of nature. For the most precise work in mass metrology, g is measured using dropping-mass absolute gravimeters that contain an iodine-stabilized helium–neon laser interferometer. The fringe-signal, frequency-sweep output from the interferometer is measured with a rubidium atomic clock. Since this type of dropping-mass gravimeter derives its accuracy and stability from the constancy of the speed of light as well as the innate properties of helium, neon, and rubidium atoms, the ‘gravity’ term in the delineation of an all-electronic kilogram is also measured in terms of invariants of nature—and with very high precision. For instance, in the basement of the NIST’s Gaithersburg facility in 2009, when measuring the gravity acting upon Pt[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]10Ir test masses (which are denser, smaller, and have a slightly lower center of gravity inside the watt balance than stainless steel masses), the measured value was typically within 8 ppb of [tpl]val|fmt=commas|9.80101644|u=m/s2[/tpl].R. Steiner, Watts in the watt balance, NIST, 16 Oct. 2009.
The virtue of electronic realizations like the watt balance is that the definition and dissemination of the kilogram would no longer be dependent upon the stability of kilogram prototypes, which must be very carefully handled and stored. It would free physicists from the need to rely on assumptions about the stability of those prototypes. Instead, hand-tuned, close-approximation mass standards would simply be weighed and documented as being equal to one kilogram plus an offset value. With the watt balance, while the kilogram would be delineated in electrical and gravity terms, all of which are traceable to invariants of nature; it would be defined in a manner that is directly traceable to just three fundamental constants of nature. The Planck constant defines the kilogram in terms of the second and the meter. By fixing the Planck constant, the definition of the kilogram would depend only on the definitions of the second and the meter. The definition of the second depends on a single defined physical constant: the ground state hyperfine splitting frequency of the caesium 133 atom Δν(133Cs)hfs. The meter depends on the second and on an additional defined physical constant: the speed of light c.  If the kilogram is redefined in this manner, mass artifacts—physical objects calibrated in a watt balance, including the IPK—would no longer be part of the definition, but would instead become transfer standards.
Scales like the watt balance also permit more flexibility in choosing materials with especially desirable properties for mass standards. For instance, Pt[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]10Ir could continue to be used so that the specific gravity of newly produced mass standards would be the same as existing national primary and check standards (≈21.55[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]g/ml). This would reduce the relative uncertainty when making mass comparisons in air. Alternatively, entirely different materials and constructions could be explored with the objective of producing mass standards with greater stability. For instance, osmium-iridium alloys could be investigated if platinum’s propensity to absorb hydrogen (due to catalysis of VOCs and hydrocarbon-based cleaning solvents) and atmospheric mercury proved to be sources of instability. Also, vapor-deposited, protective ceramic coatings like nitrides could be investigated for their suitability to isolate these new alloys.
The challenge with watt balances is not only in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of watt balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST’s watt balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the watt balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in a different part of NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards down the hall to the watt balance after calibration altered their values 10[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]ppb (equivalent to 10[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µg) or more.R. Steiner, No FG-5?, NIST, 30 Nov 2007. “We rotate between about 4 resistance standards, transferring from the calibration lab to my lab every 2–6 weeks. Resistors do not transfer well, and sometimes shift at each transfer by 10 ppb or more.” Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of watt balances between even biannual calibrations. If the kilogram is defined in terms of the Planck constant, it is likely there will only be a few—at most—watt balances initially operating in the world.
Alternative approaches to redefining the kilogram that were fundamentally different from the watt balance were explored to varying degrees with some abandoned, as follows:

===Atom-counting approaches===

====Carbon-12====

Though not offering a practical realization, this definition would precisely define the magnitude of the kilogram in terms of a certain number of carbon[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]12 atoms. Carbon[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]12 (12C) is an isotope of carbon. The mole is currently defined as “the quantity of entities (elementary particles like atoms or molecules) equal to the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]12.” Thus, the current definition of the mole requires that [tpl]frac|1000|12[/tpl] (83⅓) moles of 12C has a mass of precisely one kilogram. The number of atoms in a mole, a quantity known as the Avogadro constant, is experimentally determined, and the current best estimate of its value is [tpl]physconst|NA|unit=no|after= entities per mole.[/tpl] This new definition of the kilogram proposed to fix the Avogadro constant at precisely [tpl]gaps|6.022|14X|e=23[/tpl] with the kilogram being defined as “the mass equal to that of [tpl]nowrap|[tpl]frac|1000|12[/tpl] · [tpl]gaps|6.022|14X|e=23[/tpl][/tpl] atoms of 12C.”
The accuracy of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty in the value of the Planck constant—a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal would be that the uncertainty in the mass of a 12C atom—and the magnitude of the kilogram—could be no better than the current 50[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]ppb uncertainty in the Planck constant. Under this proposal, the magnitude of the kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements of the value of the Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow 83⅓ moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement.
A variation on a 12C-based definition proposes to define the Avogadro constant as being precisely 84,446,8893 (≈[tpl]val|fmt=commas|6.02214162|e=23[/tpl]) atoms. An imaginary realization of a 12-gram mass prototype would be a cube of 12C atoms measuring precisely 84,446,889 atoms across on a side. With this proposal, the kilogram would be defined as “the mass equal to 84,446,8893[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]× 83⅓ atoms of 12C.”
[tpl]cite journal|last=Hill|first=Theodore P|coauthors=Miller, Jack, Censullo, Albert C|title=Towards a better definition of the kilogram|journal=Metrologia|date=1 June 2011|volume=48|issue=3|pages=83–86|doi=10.1088/0026-1394/48/3/002|bibcode = 2011Metro..48...83H |arxiv = 1005.5139 [/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|The proposal originally was to redefine the kilogram as the mass of 84,446,8863 carbon-12 atoms.Georgia Tech, “A Better Definition for the Kilogram?” 21 September 2007 (press release). The value 84,446,886 had been chosen because it has a special property; its cube (the proposed new value for the Avogadro constant) is evenly divisible by twelve. Thus with that definition of the kilogram, there would have been an integer number of atoms in one gram of 12C: 50,184,508,190,229,061,679,538 atoms. The uncertainty in the Avogadro constant narrowed since this proposal was first submitted to American Scientist for publication. The 2010 CODATA value for the Avogadro constant ([tpl]val|fmt=commas|6.02214129|(27)|e=23[/tpl]) has a relative standard uncertainty of 50 parts per billion and the only cube root values within this uncertainty must fall within the range of [tpl]val|fmt=commas|84446887.4|1.2[/tpl]; that is, there are only two integer cube roots (…87 and …88) in that range and the value 84,446,886 falls outside of it. Neither of the two integer values within that range possess the property of their cubes being divisible by twelve; one gram of 12C could not comprise an integer number of atoms.|group="Note"[/tpl]

====Avogadro project====

Another Avogadro constant-based approach, known as the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and delineate the kilogram as a softball-size (93.6[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]mm diameter) sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With the size of the sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.
Experiments are being performed on the Avogadro Project’s silicon spheres to determine whether their masses are most stable when stored in a vacuum, a partial vacuum, or ambient pressure. However, no technical means currently exist to prove a long-term stability any better than that of the IPK’s because the most sensitive and accurate measurements of mass are made with dual-pan balances like the BIPM’s FB[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]2 flexure-strip balance (see External links, below). Balances can only compare the mass of a silicon sphere to that of a reference mass. Given the latest understanding of the lack of long-term mass stability with the IPK and its replicas, there is no known, perfectly stable mass artifact to compare against. Single-pan scales, which measure weight relative to an invariant of nature, are not precise to the necessary long-term uncertainty of [tpl]nowrap|10–20[/tpl] parts per billion. Another issue to be overcome is that silicon oxidizes and forms a thin layer (equivalent to [tpl]nowrap|5–20[/tpl] silicon atoms) of silicon dioxide (quartz) and silicon monoxide. This layer slightly increases the mass of the sphere, an effect which must be accounted for when polishing the sphere to its finished dimension. Oxidation is not an issue with platinum and iridium, both of which are noble metals that are roughly as cathodic as oxygen and therefore don’t oxidize unless coaxed to do so in the laboratory. The presence of the thin oxide layer on a silicon-sphere mass prototype places additional restrictions on the procedures that might be suitable to clean it to avoid changing the layer’s thickness or oxide stoichiometry.
All silicon-based approaches would fix the Avogadro constant but vary in the details of the definition of the kilogram. One approach would use silicon with all three of its natural isotopes present. About 7.78% of silicon comprises the two heavier isotopes: 29Si and 30Si. As described in Carbon[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]12 above, this method would define the magnitude of the kilogram in terms of a certain number of 12C atoms by fixing the Avogadro constant; the silicon sphere would be the practical realization. This approach could accurately delineate the magnitude of the kilogram because the masses of the three silicon nuclides relative to 12C are known with great precision (relative uncertainties of 1[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]ppb or better). An alternative method for creating a silicon sphere-based kilogram proposes to use isotopic separation techniques to enrich the silicon until it is nearly pure 28Si, which has a relative atomic mass of [tpl]val|fmt=commas|27.9769265325|(19)[/tpl].[tpl]cite journal|last=Brumfiel|first=Geoff|title=Elemental shift for kilo|journal=Nature|date=21 October 2010|volume=467|pages=892|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101019/pdf/467892a.pdf|doi=10.1038/467892a[/tpl]  With this approach, the Avogadro constant would not only be fixed, but so too would the atomic mass of 28Si. As such, the definition of the kilogram would be decoupled from 12C and the kilogram would instead be defined as [tpl]frac|1000|[tpl]val|fmt=commas|27.9769265325[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]nbsp[/tpl]·[tpl]nbsp[/tpl][tpl]val|fmt=commas|6.02214179|e=23[/tpl] atoms of 28Si (≈[tpl]val|fmt=commas|35.74374043[/tpl] fixed moles of 28Si atoms). Physicists could elect to define the kilogram in terms of 28Si even when kilogram prototypes are made of natural silicon (all three isotopes present). Even with a kilogram definition based on theoretically pure 28Si, a silicon-sphere prototype made of only nearly pure 28Si would necessarily deviate slightly from the defined number of moles of silicon to compensate for various chemical and isotopic impurities as well as the effect of surface oxides.NPL: Avogadro Project; Australian National Measurement Institute: the kilogram through the Avogadro constant; and Australian Centre for Precision Optics: The Avogadro Project

====Ion accumulation====

Another Avogadro-based approach, ion accumulation, since abandoned, would have defined and delineated the kilogram by precisely creating new metal prototypes on demand. It would have done so by accumulating gold or bismuth ions (atoms stripped of an electron) and counted them by measuring the electrical current required to neutralize the ions. Gold (197Au) and bismuth (209Bi) were chosen because they can be safely handled and have the two highest atomic masses among the mononuclidic elements that is effectively non-radioactive (bismuth) or is perfectly stable (gold). See also Table of nuclides.In 2003, the same year the first gold-deposition experiments were conducted, physicists found that the only naturally occurring isotope of bismuth, 209Bi, is actually very slightly radioactive, with the longest known radioactive half-life of any naturally occurring element that decays via alpha radiation—a half-life of [tpl]val|19|2|e=18|u=years[/tpl]. As this is 1.4 billion times the age of the universe, 209Bi is considered a stable isotope for most practical applications (those unrelated to such disciplines as nucleocosmochronology and geochronology). In other terms, [tpl]nowrap|[tpl]val|fmt=commas|99.999999983[/tpl]%[/tpl] of the bismuth that existed on Earth 4.567 billion years ago still exists today. Only two mononuclidic elements are heavier than bismuth and only one approaches its stability: thorium. Long considered a possible replacement for uranium in nuclear reactors, thorium can cause cancer when inhaled because it is over 1.2[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]billion times more radioactive than bismuth. It also has such a strong tendency to oxidize that its powders are pyrophoric. These characteristics make thorium unsuitable in ion-deposition experiments. See also Isotopes of bismuth, Isotopes of gold and Isotopes of thorium.
With a gold-based definition of the kilogram for instance, the relative atomic mass of gold could have been fixed as precisely [tpl]val|fmt=commas|196.9665687[/tpl], from the current value of [tpl]val|fmt=commas|196.9665687|(6)[/tpl]. As with a definition based upon carbon[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]12, the Avogadro constant would also have been fixed. The kilogram would then have been defined as “the mass equal to that of precisely [tpl]frac|1000|[tpl]val|fmt=commas|196.9665687[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]nbsp[/tpl]·[tpl]nbsp[/tpl][tpl]val|fmt=commas|6.02214179|e=23[/tpl] atoms of gold” (precisely 3,057,443,620,887,933,963,384,315 atoms of gold or about [tpl]val|fmt=commas|5.07700371[/tpl] fixed moles).
In 2003, German experiments with gold at a current of only 10[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µA demonstrated a relative uncertainty of 1.5%.The German national metrology institute, known as the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB): Working group 1.24, Ion Accumulation Follow-on experiments using bismuth ions and a current of 30[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]mA were expected to accumulate a mass of 30[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]g in six days and to have a relative uncertainty of better than 1 ppm.General Conference on Weights and Measures, 22nd Meeting, October 2003 (3.2[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]MB ZIP file). Ultimately, ion[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]accumulation approaches proved to be unsuitable. Measurements required months and the data proved too erratic for the technique to be considered a viable future replacement to the IPK.Bowers, Mary, The Caravan (magazine), 1–15 September 2009: “Why the World is Losing Weight”
Among the many technical challenges of the ion-deposition apparatus was obtaining a sufficiently high ion current (mass deposition rate) while simultaneously decelerating the ions so they could all deposit onto a target electrode embedded in a balance pan. Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be decelerated to very low energies to avoid sputtering effects—a phenomenon whereby ions that had already been counted ricochet off the target electrode or even dislodged atoms that had already been deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around 1[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]eV (If the kilogram had been defined as a precise quantity of gold or bismuth atoms deposited with an electric current, not only would the Avogadro constant and the atomic mass of gold or bismuth have to have been precisely fixed, but also the value of the elementary charge (e), likely to [tpl]gaps|1.602|17X|e=-19|u=C[/tpl] (from the currently recommended value of [tpl]physconst|e[/tpl]). Doing so would have effectively defined the ampere as a flow of [tpl]frac|[tpl]gaps|1.602|17X|e=-19[/tpl][/tpl] electrons per second past a fixed point in an electric circuit. The SI unit of mass would have been fully defined by having precisely fixed the values of the Avogadro constant and elementary charge, and by exploiting the fact that the atomic masses of bismuth and gold atoms are invariant, universal constants of nature.
Beyond the slowness of making a new mass standard and the poor reproducibility, there were other intrinsic shortcomings to the ion[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]accumulation approach that proved to be formidable obstacles to ion-accumulation-based techniques becoming a practical realization. The apparatus necessarily required that the deposition chamber have an integral balance system to enable the convenient calibration of a reasonable quantity of transfer standards relative to any single internal ion-deposited prototype. Furthermore, the mass prototypes produced by ion deposition techniques would have been nothing like the freestanding platinum-iridium prototypes currently in use; they would have been deposited onto—and become part of—an electrode imbedded into one pan of a special balance integrated into the device. Moreover, the ion-deposited mass wouldn’t have had a hard, highly polished surface that can be vigorously cleaned like those of current prototypes. Gold, while dense and a noble metal (resistant to oxidation and the formation of other compounds), is extremely soft so an internal gold prototype would have to be kept well isolated and scrupulously clean to avoid contamination and the potential of wear from having to remove the contamination. Bismuth, which is an inexpensive metal used in low-temperature solders, slowly oxidizes when exposed to room-temperature air and forms other chemical compounds and so would not have produced stable reference masses unless it was continually maintained in a vacuum or inert atmosphere.

===Ampere-based force===

This approach would define the kilogram as “the mass which would be accelerated at precisely [tpl]val|2|e=-7|u=m/s2[/tpl] when subjected to the per-meter force between two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross section, placed one meter apart in vacuum, through which flow a constant current of [tpl]frac|[tpl]gaps|1.602|17X|e=-19[/tpl][/tpl] elementary charges per second”.
Effectively, this would define the kilogram as a derivative of the ampere rather than present relationship, which defines the ampere as a derivative of the kilogram. This redefinition of the kilogram would specify elementary charge (e) as precisely [tpl]gaps|1.602|17X|e=-19[/tpl] coulomb rather than the current recommended value of [tpl]physconst|e|after=.[/tpl]  It would necessarily follow that the ampere (one coulomb per second) would also become an electrical current of this precise quantity of elementary charges per second passing a given point in an electric circuit.
The virtue of a practical realization based upon this definition is that unlike the watt balance and other scale-based methods, all of which require the careful characterization of gravity in the laboratory, this method delineates the magnitude of the kilogram directly in the very terms that define the nature of mass: acceleration due to an applied force. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to develop a practical realization based upon accelerating masses. Experiments over a period of years in Japan with a superconducting, 30[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]g mass supported by diamagnetic levitation never achieved an uncertainty better than ten parts per million. Magnetic hysteresis was one of the limiting issues. Other groups performed similar research that used different techniques to levitate the mass.[tpl]cite press release |publisher=NIST |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080522131052/http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/newsfromnist_beyond_the_kilogram.htm|archivedate=22 May 2008|url=http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/newsfromnist_beyond_the_kilogram.htm |title=Beyond the kilogram: redefining the International System of Units[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Robinson, I.A. |title=Toward a Final Result From the NPL Mark II Watt Balance |journal=IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement |date=April 2009 |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=936–941 |doi=10.1109/TIM.2008.2008090 [/tpl]

==SI multiples==

Because SI prefixes may not be concatenated (serially linked) within the name or symbol for a unit of measure, SI prefixes are used with the gram, not the kilogram, which already has a prefix as part of its name.BIPM: SI Brochure: Section 3.2, ''The kilogram[tpl]nbsp[/tpl] For instance, one-millionth of a kilogram is 1[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]mg (one milligram), not 1[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]µkg (one microkilogram).
