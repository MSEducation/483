Kingsland Basin is a canal basin in Kingsland, London, part of the London Borough of Hackney. The basin is located off the Regents Canal.
The basin is the site of numerous housing redevelopments. 
C.H.U.G. and Kingsland Basin
Kingsland Basin is home to Canals in Hackney Users Group (CHUG). CHUG is a local charity based in Kingsland Basin, London N1. Founded in 1983, it was set up to 'promote use of the canal in Hackney'. In the early 1980s a Hackney Council grant to generate affordable housing enabled the dredging of the abandoned basin, and the setting up of moorings for residential boats. The individual residents formed CHUG, the Canals in Hackney Users Group.
CHUGÊ¼s key activities over the last three decades focused on educating about the canal and its environmental & historical facets, and advocating its use by working with schools and local organisations. CHUG actively improved the canal environment, and campaigned for sustainable development around the basin. CHUG works closely with its fellow water-based charity, Laburnum Boat Club, which uses the basin as a training space. CHUG supports LBC with resources & funds for inclusive water sport activities.
CHUG still manages & maintains the moorings. This tightly knit community brings together people of all ages, and from all walks of life. The self- managed moorings, unique in the UK, provide desperately needed genuinely affordable residential moorings in central London. The redevelopment of Kingsland Basin may affect CHUG's ability to do this in the future.
