SS ''Scoresby'' was a British cargo steamship that was built in 1923, sailed in a number of transatlantic convoys in 1940 and was sunk by a U-boat that October.

==Building==

Robert Thompson & Sons Ltd of Bridge Dockyard, Sunderland built Scoresby, completing her in January 1923. She had eight corrugated furnaces with a combined grate area of [tpl]convert|128|sqft|0[/tpl] that heated two 180 lbf/in2 single-ended boilers with a combined heating surface of [tpl]convert|5276|sqft|0[/tpl]. The boilers fed a three-cylinder triple expansion steam engine that was rated at 436 NHP and drove a single screw. The engine was built by the North Eastern Marine Engineering Co, Ltd, also of Sunderland.
Scoresby owner was Rowland and Marwood's Steam Ship Co, Ltd, who registered her in Whitby. She was managed by another Rowland and Marwood's company, Headlam & Sons.

==Convoy SC-7 and sinking==

Scoresby sailed from Corner Brook, Newfoundland with a cargo of [tpl]convert|1685|fathom|m|sing=off[/tpl] of pit props bound for the Clyde in Scotland. She sailed via St. Francis Harbour, Nova Scotia and Sydney, Nova Scotia, where she joined Convoy SC-7. Her Master was Lawrence Zebedee Weatherill, and she carried the Convoy Vice-Commodore. SC-7 left Sydney on 5 October. At first the convoy had only one escort ship, the [tpl]sclass-|Hastings|sloop[/tpl] [tpl]HMS|Scarborough|L25|6[/tpl]. A wolf pack of U-boats found the convoy on 16 October and quickly overwhelmed it, sinking many ships over the next few days.
At 0553 hrs on 17 October SC-7 was about [tpl]convert|160|nmi|km[/tpl] northwest of Rockall when [tpl]GS|U-48|1939|6[/tpl], commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Heinrich Bleichrodt, fired three torpedoes at the convoy. Two ships were hit and sunk: Scoresby and the French tanker [tpl]MV|Languedoc||2[/tpl]. Captain Weatherill and his entire crew successfully abandoned ship, were rescued by the [tpl]sclass2-|Flower|corvette[/tpl] [tpl]HMS|Bluebell|K80|6[/tpl], and on 20 October were landed at Gourock in Scotland.
