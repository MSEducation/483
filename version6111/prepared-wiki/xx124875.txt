"My Sugar Cat" only managed to debut at #8 in the daily charts and fell out of the top 20 after 3 days. It reached #14 for the weekly charts with 13,484 copies sold in the first week. Furthermore, it fell out of the Top 50 the very next week, causing Oricon to stop tracking the single's sales. To date, this single has sold 19,120 copies.
This is comparable to her recent releases, such as "All Hands Together" as well as "Cry No More," although these sales numbers are much lower than her successful singles, especially compared to "Glamorous Sky".
