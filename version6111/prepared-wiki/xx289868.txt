Google Test is a unit testing library for the C++ programming language, based on the xUnit architecture.A quick introduction to the Google C++ Testing Framework, Arpan Sen, IBM DeveloperWorks, 2010-05-11, retrieved 2013-08-14 The library is released under the BSD 3-clause license.Google Test's site, retrieved 2013-08-14, cites New BSD as license. The license file is at [tpl]URL|http://code.google.com/p/googletest/source/browse/trunk/LICENSE[/tpl] It can be compiled for a variety of POSIX and Windows platforms, allowing unit-testing of 'C' sources as well as C++ with minimal source modification. Google Test is more or less a debugger for computer programs and code because at the first sign of a failure, the debugger is automatically invoked.A quick introduction to the Google C++ Testing Framework, Arpan Sen, IBM DeveloperWorks, 2010-05-11, retrieved 201-04-28 The tests themselves could be run one at a time, or even be called to run all at once. This makes the debugging process very specific and caters to the need of many programmers and coders alike.

==Types of Google Tests==

==Who/What Uses Google Test==

Besides being developed and used at Google, many other projects implement Google Test as well:
    The Chromium projects (behind the Chrome browser and Chrome OS)
    The LLVM compiler
    Protocol Buffers (Google's data interchange format)
Google Test UI is test runner that runs your test binary, allows you to track its progress via a progress bar, and displays a list of test failures. Clicking on one shows failure text. Google Test UI is written in C#.Google Test retrieved 2014-04-28

==Fixtures==

Fixture testing is crucial in computer code because it allows the testing of time and memory management. If these areas are lacking, bugs may arise, and ultimately the code may become incompatible or even fail to run in the first place. Google Test can specifically handle and run this type of test. When doing so, it can also recognize the type of fixture test is required. Fixtures more or less in Google Tests are considered a class and can be instantiated as one as well. There are also details when understanding how fixtures work, and here are some of these details:
