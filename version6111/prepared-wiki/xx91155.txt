The National Basketball Association's Coach of the Year is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given since the 1962–63 NBA season. The winner receives the Red Auerbach Trophy, which is named in honor of the head coach who led the Boston Celtics to nine NBA Championships from 1956 to 1966. The winner is selected at the end of regular season by a panel of sportswriters from the United States and Canada, each of whom casts a vote for first, second and third place selections. Each first-place vote is worth five points; each second-place vote is worth three points; and each third-place vote is worth one point. The person with the highest point total, regardless of the number of first-place votes, wins the award.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/news/awards2006_coach.html|title=Dallas’ Avery Johnson Named 2005-06 NBA Coach of the Year|accessdate=July 12, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=April 28, 2006|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com[/tpl]
