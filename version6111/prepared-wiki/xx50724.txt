[tpl]nihongo|Battle Royale|バトル・ロワイアル|Batoru Rowaiaru[/tpl] is a novel by Japanese writer Koushun Takami. Originally completed in 1996, it was not published until 1999. The story tells of junior high school students who are forced to fight each other to the death in a program run by the authoritarian Japanese government, now known as the Republic of Greater East Asia.
It was previously entered into the 1997 Japan Grand Prix Horror Novel competition but was eventually rejected in the final round due to its content. The novel became a surprise bestseller. It was ranked fourth by the 2000 Kono Mystery ga Sugoi!, an annual mystery and thriller guidebook, and sold over a million copies.
In 2000, one year after publication, Battle Royale was adapted into a manga series, written by Takami himself, and a feature film. The film was also controversial and successful, with it being condemned by Japan's National Diet, yet becoming one of the country's highest-grossing films. The film spawned a sequel, and two more brief manga adaptations were also created. The novel itself has been translated into Chinese, English, French, Portuguese,  Spanish, German, Italian, Russian, Norwegian and Hungarian.

==Plot==

Battle Royale takes place in an alternate timeline; according to the book's prologue, Japan is a police state, known as the Republic of Greater East Asia (大東亜共和国 Dai Tōa Kyōwakoku). From time to time, fifty randomly selected classes of secondary school students are forced to take arms against one another until only one student in each class remains. The program was created, supposedly, as a form of military research, though the outcome of each battle is publicized on local television. A character discovers that the program is not an experiment at all, but a means of terrorizing the population. In theory, after seeing such atrocities, the people will become paranoid and divided, preventing an organized rebellion.
Under the guise of a 'study trip', a group of students from Shiroiwa Junior High School (城岩中学校 Shiroiwa Chūgakkō), a junior high school operated by the fictional town of Shiroiwa (in Kagawa Prefecture), are corralled onto a bus and gassed, only to awaken in a school on an isolated, evacuated island, wearing metal collars around their necks. After being briefed about the program, the students are issued survival packs (along with a random weapon or a tool) and sent out onto the island one by one. While most of the students receive guns and knives, some students acquire relatively useless items like boomerangs, some common dartboard darts, or a fork. In some cases, instead of a weapon, the student receives a tool; Hiroki Sugimura finds a radar that tracks nearby students, and Toshinori Oda receives a bulletproof vest.
To make sure the students obey the rules and kill each other, the metal collars around their necks track their positions, and will explode if they linger in a 'Forbidden Zone' or attempt to remove the collars. The Forbidden Zones are randomly chosen areas of the map that increase in number as time goes on, re-sculpting and shrinking the battlefield and forcing the students to move around. The collars secretly transmit sound back to the organizers of the game, allowing them to hear the students' conversations, root out escape plans, and log their activities.
The students are also given a time limit. If twenty-four hours pass without someone being killed, then all of the collars will be detonated simultaneously and there will be no winner. It is mentioned that only 0.5% of Programs end in this fashion.
In the end, only four students remain: Shuya Nanahara, Noriko Nakagawa, Shogo Kawada, and antagonist Kazuo Kiriyama. There is a car chase and shootout between the three main characters and Kazuo Kiriyama is killed, and soon Kawada succumbs to his wounds and dies, as well. Heeding Kawada's advice to "show no mercy," Shuya and Noriko board a nearby ship, kill the soldiers on board, and escape to the mainland, where they become fugitives.

==Background and publication==

Koushun Takami completed Battle Royale when he stopped working as a journalist in 1996. The story was rejected in the final round of the 1997 Japan Grand Prix Horror Novel competition, due to its controversial content. It was first published in April 1999 by Ohta Shuppan. In August 2002, it was released in a revised, two-part pocket edition by Gentosha.
Takami describes the characters as possibly all being "kind of alike", being "all the same" despite differing appearances and hobbies, and being static characters. Takami used these descriptions in contrast to the manga adaptation he wrote, with Masayuki Taguchi illustrating, which he believes has a more diverse and well-developed cast."Final Chapter Memorial Discussion: Koushun Takami and Masayuki Taguchi."

It's unfair, but that's reality." However, he stated that he might return to the film in ten years to "develop a Battle Royale movie for the next generation."[tpl]cite news|last=Yang|first=Jeff|title=‘Hunger Games’ Vs. ‘Battle Royale’|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/03/23/the-hunger-games-vs-battle-royale/|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=2012-03-23|accessdate=2012-09-24[/tpl]

===Television===

On July 26, 2012, the Los Angeles Times reported that The CW Television Network had been in discussions with Hollywood representatives about the possibility of turning Battle Royale into an American television show. According to a spokesperson, the talks were only preliminary, but if a deal could be reached, the network would acquire rights to Koushun Takami's novel, then expand on it for an hourlong dramatic series. Joyce Jun, a Hollywood attorney representing U.S. rights to the title, states that "there is no deal in place." A CW spokesman only confirmed there had been some discussion, declining to comment further.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-battle-royale-could-be-reborn-as-a-tv-show-20120726,0,5414971.story?track=rss | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Steven | last=Zeitchik | title='Battle Royale' could be reborn as a TV show | date=2012-09-24[/tpl]

==Reception==

Upon publication in 1999, Battle Royale became one of the best-selling novels in Japan.[tpl]cite web|title=Battle Royale: The Novel|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Battle-Royale-Novel-Koushun-Takami/dp/1421527723|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=29 March 2012[/tpl] The novel was earlier entered into the 1997 Japan Grand Prix Horror Novel competition, but was eventually rejected in the final round due to its controversial content. It was ranked fourth in the 2000 Kono Mystery ga Sugoi!, an annual guidebook that ranks mystery and thriller novels published the previous year.
It was also critically acclaimed abroad. In Entertainment Weekly, the writer Stephen King included it as one of the seven books in his 2005 summer reading list, after it was recommended to him by novelist Kelly Braffet (writer of Josie and Jack). King described Battle Royale as "an insanely entertaining pulp riff that combines Survivor with World Wrestling Entertainment. Or maybe Royale is just insane." He also notes that it has some similarities to his own novel The Long Walk. He concludes the brief review with a "No prob," as "Takami's Springsteen-quoting teenagers are fond of saying."[tpl]cite web|last=King|first=Stephen|title=Kick-Back Books: Stephen King's summer reading list|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1089990,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=March 23, 2012|authorlink=Stephen King|date=August 4, 2005[/tpl] The town from which the ill-fated students in Battle Royale hail is called Shiroiwa, which translates as "Castle Rock", a possible reference to Stephen King as well as Lord of the Flies.
The writer David N. Alderman, writing for the Red Room site, gave Battle Royale a score of 4½ out of 5 stars, stating that the "story itself is brilliant. Touted as being extremely controversial, especially for the time it was released, the book opens up all sorts of doors to conversations and thoughts about psychology, murder, survival, love, loyalty, and moral ground." While noting that those who "cringe at slash and hack" should "steer away from this" since "it is a bit gory," he states that it is "definitely worth the read" and concludes that it has "touches of romance, and definitely some great moral themes to spark off in-depth conversations with others."[tpl]cite web|last=Alderman|first=David N.|title=Battle Royale - (Book Review)|url=http://redroom.com/member/david-alderman/blog/battle-royale-book-review|publisher=Red Room|accessdate=28 March 2012|date=October 7, 2010[/tpl]  Complete review gave the novel a B rating, describing it as "a perfectly fine thriller, with a fun premise, quite well drawn-out."[tpl]cite web|title=Battle Royale by Takami Koushun|url=http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/japannew/takamik.htm|work=complete review|accessdate=28 March 2012[/tpl] In The Journal of the Lincoln Heights Literary Society, Tom Good praises the novel, concluding that, as "a pulp-fiction horror tale, Battle Royale delivers plenty of thrills, action, suspense and fun."[tpl]cite journal|last=Good|first=Tom|title=Book review: Battle Royale (Novel)|journal=The Journal of the Lincoln Heights Literary Society|date=10/07/2007|year=2007|month=October|url=http://liheliso.com/buzz/archive/00000758.htm|accessdate=28 March 2012[/tpl] On the Barnes & Noble site, the novel holds an average user rating of 5 out of 5 stars.[tpl]cite web|title=Battle Royale (Novel)|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/battle-royale-koushun-takami/1016541586|publisher=Barnes & Noble|accessdate=28 March 2012[/tpl]

The 2008 American young adult novel The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins has been accused of being strikingly similar to Battle Royale in terms of the basic plot premise and the world within the book. While Collins maintains that she "had never heard of that book until her book was turned in", Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff," but argued that "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently."[tpl]cite web|last=Dominus|first=Susan|title=Suzanne Collins’s War Stories for Kids|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/magazine/mag-10collins-t.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|accessdate=27 March 2012|date=April 8, 2011[/tpl] The general consensus in the time since has been one of amicable controversy, especially since the release of the The Hunger Games film adaptation. Battle Royale author Takami said he appreciated fans "standing up" for his book, but stated that he thinks "every novel has something to offer," and that if "readers find value in either book, that's all an author can ask for."[tpl]cite web|last=Fujita|first=Akiko|title=‘The Hunger Games,’ a Japanese Original?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/03/the-hunger-games-a-japanese-original/|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=29 March 2012|date=March 22, 2012[/tpl]
In Marvel Comics, the 2012 release of Avengers Arena, as part of the Marvel NOW! imprint, introducing the plot similar to the film itself, as also the comic's first issue covers bears homage to the film as the main characters posed in the same manner as the film's poster, including the comic's main logo bearing a similar design as the film's logo.
