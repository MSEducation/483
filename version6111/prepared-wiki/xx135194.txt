The Best (aka The Best of t.A.T.u., t.A.T.u. The Best) is a CD/ set from the Russian group t.A.T.u. featuring hit singles, rare mixes, three previously unreleased tracks, a live concert, music videos and more.

==Critical reception==

The Best received generally positive reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlwine from Allmusic gave it four out of five stars. He concluding saying "since a little t.A.T.u. can go a long way, it's best to get all the big hits in one place; the rest of the record might still be filler even on a hits disc, but at least it has all the big songs, which The Best certainly does, and that should satisfy any listener who considers the Russian duo a guilty pleasure." However, he did say that the album was too early for a release.

==Facts and missing songs==

There were a lot of facts, misspelt words and other associated issues with the album.
In the sides there is missing a dot in the t.A.T.u. logo. The song "Ya Soshla S Uma" was misspelled on the back cover. It was listed as "Ya Soshia S Uma". While "Nas Ne Dogonyat" was spelled as "Nas Ne Dagoniat", although it is a valid translation. Both those versions are not the Russian edits.
Although neither "Novaya Model" and "Perfect Enemy" are singles, only "Perfect Enemy" was included on the compilation (although Russian radio released Novaya Model on their stations).
The album claims to have 3 unreleased songs, although only "Null and Void" was unreleased. The other two songs were a remix and the previously released "Divine". Also, it says "Divine" was an extended edit, however it is non-different to the b-side on "All About Us".
The album was also going to include "Prostye Dvizheniya", however, for unknown reasons, it was taken off. On the back cover of the "Deluxe Edition" the music videos for "Friend or Foe" and the TV version of "All About Us" are not included.
