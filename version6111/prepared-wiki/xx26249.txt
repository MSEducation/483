Broccoli is an edible green plant in the cabbage family, whose large flowering head is used as a vegetable. The word broccoli comes from the Italian plural of [tpl]lang|it|broccolo[/tpl], which means "the flowering top of a cabbage", and is the diminutive form of brocco, meaning "small nail" or "sprout".[tpl]cite dictionary|title=broccoli|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary|edition=11th|page=156|isbn=978-0-87779-809-5|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/broccoli|accessdate=9 April 2014[/tpl] Broccoli is often boiled or steamed but may be eaten raw.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gardenbetty.com/2012/04/broccoli-leaves-are-edible/|title=Broccoli Leaves Are Edible |publisher=Garden Betty|accessdate=8 May 2013[/tpl]
Broccoli is classified in the Italica cultivar group of the species Brassica oleracea. Broccoli has large flower heads, usually green in color, arranged in a tree-like structure on branches sprouting from a thick, edible stalk. The mass of flower heads is surrounded by leaves. Broccoli resembles cauliflower, which is a different cultivar group of the same species.
Broccoli is a result of careful breeding of cultivated leafy cole crops in the Northern Mediterranean in about the 6th century BC.[tpl]cite journal|last = Maggioni|first = Lorenzo|coauthors = von Bothmer., R., Poulesen, G., Branca, F.|title = Origin and Domestication of Cole Crops (Brassica oleracea L.): Linguistic and Literary Considerations|journal = Economic Botany|volume = 64|issue = 2|pages = 109–123|year = 2010|doi=10.1007/s12231-010-9115-2[/tpl] Since the Roman Empire, broccoli has been considered a uniquely valuable food among Italians.[tpl]cite book|last=Nonnecke|first=Ib|title=Vegetable Production|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC|date=November 1989|page=394|isbn=978-0-442-26721-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H7i8QJw8BJsC&pg=PA394[/tpl] Broccoli was brought to England from  Antwerp in the mid-18th century by  Peter Scheemakers.Smith,J.T.

==Nutrition==

Broccoli is high in vitamin C and dietary fiber. It also contains multiple nutrients with potent anti-cancer properties, such as diindolylmethane and small amounts of selenium.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=9|title=WHFoods: Broccoli|publisher=George Mateljan Foundation|accessdate=2009-05-11[/tpl] A single serving provides more than 30 mg of vitamin C and a half-cup provides 52 mg of vitamin C.Understanding Nutrition, Eleanor N.

Broccoli is also an excellent source of indole-3-carbinol, a chemical which boosts DNA repair in cells and appears to block the growth of cancer cells.[tpl]cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4688854.stm|title = Broccoli chemical's cancer check|publisher = BBC News|accessdate = 5 September 2010|date = 7 February 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100629131316.htm|title = How Dietary Supplement May Block Cancer Cells|work = Science Daily|accessdate = 5 September 2010|date = 30 June 2010[/tpl]
Boiling broccoli reduces the levels of suspected anti-carcinogenic compounds, such as sulforaphane, with losses of 20–30% after five minutes, 40–50% after ten minutes, and 77% after thirty minutes. However, other preparation methods such as steaming,[tpl]cite news|title= Maximizing The Anti-Cancer Power of Broccoli |date=5 April 2005|work = Science Daily|url =http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/03/050326114810.htm[/tpl] microwaving, and stir frying had no significant effect on the compounds.[tpl]cite news|last=Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick|title= Research Says Boiling Broccoli Ruins Its Anti Cancer Properties. |date=15 May 2007|url =http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/research_says_boiling/[/tpl]

==Varieties==

There are three commonly grown types of broccoli. The most familiar is Calabrese broccoli, often referred to simply as "broccoli", named after Calabria in Italy. It has large (10 to 20 cm) green heads and thick stalks. It is a cool season annual crop.   Sprouting broccoli has a larger number of heads with many thin stalks.  Purple cauliflower is a type of broccoli sold in southern Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. It has a head shaped like cauliflower, but consisting of tiny flower buds. It sometimes, but not always, has a purple cast to the tips of the flower buds.
Other cultivar groups of Brassica oleracea include cabbage (Capitata Group), cauliflower and Romanesco broccoli (Botrytis Group), kale and collard greens (Acephala Group), kohlrabi (Gongylodes Group), Brussels sprouts (Gemmifera Group),and Chinese broccoli (Alboglabra Group).[tpl]cite book|last1 = Dixon|first1 = G.R.|year = 2007|title = Vegetable brassicas and related crucifers|isbn = 978-0-85199-395-9|publisher = CABI|location = Wallingford[/tpl] Rapini, sometimes called "broccoli raab" among other names, forms similar but smaller heads, and is actually a type of turnip (Brassica rapa).  Broccolini or "Tenderstem broccoli" is a cross between broccoli and Chinese broccoli. Beneforté is a variety of broccoli containing 2-3 times more glucoraphanin that was produced by crossing broccoli with a wild Brassica variety, Brassica oleracea var villosa.http://www.superbroccoli.info/about-beneforte/timeline

===Cultivation===

Broccoli is a cool-weather crop that does poorly in hot summer weather. Broccoli grows best when exposed to an average daily temperature between [tpl]convert|18|and|23|°C|°F[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title = HGIC 1301 Broccoli|last = Smith|first = Powell|date = June 1999|publisher = Clemson University|url = http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/vegetables/crops/hgic1301.html|accessdate = 25 August 2009[/tpl]
When the cluster of flowers, also referred to as a "head" of broccoli, appear in the center of the plant, the cluster is green. Garden pruners or shears are used to cut the head about an inch from the tip. Broccoli should be harvested before the flowers on the head bloom bright yellow.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|title = Broccoli|last = Liptay|first = Albert|year = 1988|publisher = World Book, Inc.[/tpl]
While the heading broccoli variety performs poorly in hot weather, mainly due to insect infestation, the sprouting variety is more resistant, though attention must be paid to sucking insects (such as aphids), caterpillars and whiteflies. Spraying of bacillus thuringiensis can control caterpillar attacks, while a citronella vase may ward off whiteflies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cultivozen.com/2013/05/cultivo-do-couve-brocolis.html?lang=en|title=http://cultivozen.massahiro.com/2013/05/cultivo-do-couve-brocolis.html?lang=en |author=Takeguma, Massahiro|date=26 May 2013|title=Cultivo da Couve Brócolis (Growing Sprouting Broccoli) [/tpl]

===Pests===

Mostly introduced by accident, "cabbage worms", the larvae of Pieris rapae, the small white butterfly are a common pest in broccoli.
