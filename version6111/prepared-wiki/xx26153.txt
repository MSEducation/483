Willard Myron Allen co-discovered progesterone with his anatomy professor George Washington Corner at the University of Rochester Medical School in 1933. Allen first determined its melting point, molecular weight, and partial molecular structure. He also gave it the name Progesterone derived from Progestational Steroidal ketone.[tpl]cite journal | author = Allen WM | title = Progesterone: how did the name originate? | journal = South. Med.

Like other steroids, progesterone consists of four interconnected cyclic hydrocarbons. Progesterone contains ketone and oxygenated functional groups, as well as two methyl branches. Like all steroid hormones, it is hydrophobic.

==Sources==

===Animal===

Progesterone is produced in the ovaries (by the corpus luteum), the adrenal glands (near the kidney), and, during pregnancy, in the placenta. Progesterone is also stored in adipose (fat) tissue.
In humans, increasing amounts of progesterone are produced during pregnancy:

===Plants===

In at least one plant, Juglans regia, progesterone has been detected.[tpl]cite journal | author = Pauli GF, Friesen JB, Gödecke T, Farnsworth NR, Glodny B | title = Occurrence of Progesterone and Related Animal Steroids in Two Higher Plants | journal = J Nat Prod | volume = 73| issue = 3| pages = 338–45|date=January 2010 | pmid = 20108949 | doi = 10.1021/np9007415 | url =  [/tpl] In addition, progesterone-like steroids are found in Dioscorea mexicana.  Dioscorea mexicana is a plant that is part of the yam family native to Mexico.[tpl]cite journal | author = Applezweig N | title = Steroids | journal = Chem Week | volume = 104 | issue = | pages = 57–72 |date=May 1969 | pmid = 12255132 | doi = | url =  [/tpl] It contains a steroid called diosgenin that is taken from the plant and is converted into progesterone.[tpl]cite journal | author = Noguchi E, Fujiwara Y, Matsushita S, Ikeda T, Ono M, Nohara T | title = Metabolism of tomato steroidal glycosides in humans | journal = Chem.

Another plant that contains substances readily convertible to progesterone is Dioscorea pseudojaponica native to Taiwan. Research has shown that the Taiwanese yam contains saponins — steroids that can be converted to diosgenin and thence to progesterone.[tpl]cite journal | author = Yang DJ, Lu TJ, Hwang LS | title = Isolation and identification of steroidal saponins in Taiwanese yam cultivar (Dioscorea pseudojaponica Yamamoto) | journal = J.

Many other Dioscorea species of the yam family contain steroidal substances from which progesterone can be produced. Among the more notable of these are Dioscorea villosa and Dioscorea polygonoides.  One study showed that the Dioscorea villosa contains 3.5% diosgenin.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hooker E | title = Final report of the amended safety assessment of Dioscorea Villosa (Wild Yam) root extract | journal = Int.

==Synthesis==

===Biosynthesis===

In mammals, progesterone (6), like all other steroid hormones, is synthesized from pregnenolone (3),  which in turn is derived from cholesterol (1) (see the upper half of the figure to the right).
Cholesterol (1) undergoes double oxidation to produce 20,22-dihydroxycholesterol (2). This vicinal diol is then further oxidized with loss of the side chain starting at position C-22 to produce pregnenolone (3).  This reaction is catalyzed by cytochrome P450scc.
The conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone takes place in two steps. First, the 3-hydroxyl group is oxidized to a keto group (4) and second, the double bond is moved to C-4, from C-5 through a keto/enol tautomerization reaction.[tpl]cite book | author = Dewick, Paul M. | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Medicinal natural products: a biosynthetic approach | edition = | language = | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2002 | origyear = | pages = 244 | quote = | isbn = 0-471-49641-3 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = [/tpl]  This reaction is catalyzed by 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta(5)-delta(4)isomerase.
Progesterone in turn (see lower half of figure to the right) is the precursor of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone, and after conversion to 17-hydroxyprogesterone (another natural progestogen) of cortisol and androstenedione. Androstenedione can be converted to testosterone, estrone and estradiol.
Pregnenolone and progesterone can also be synthesized by yeast.[tpl]cite journal | author = Duport C, Spagnoli R, Degryse E, Pompon D | title = Self-sufficient biosynthesis of pregnenolone and progesterone in engineered yeast | journal = Nat. Biotechnol. | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 186–9 |date=February 1998 | pmid = 9487528 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0298-186 | url =  [/tpl]

===Laboratory===

An economical semisynthesis of progesterone from the plant steroid diosgenin isolated from yams was developed by Russell Marker in 1940 for the Parke-Davis pharmaceutical company (see figure to the right). This synthesis is known as the Marker degradation. Additional semisyntheses of progesterone have also been reported starting from a variety of steroids.  For the example, cortisone can be simultaneously deoxygenated at the C-17 and C-21 position by treatment with iodotrimethylsilane in chloroform to produce 11-keto-progesterone (ketogestin), which in turn can be reduced at position-11 to yield progesterone.[tpl]cite journal| author = Numazawa M, Nagaoka M, Kunitama Y | title = Regiospecific deoxygenation of the dihydroxyacetone moiety at C-17 of corticoid steroids with iodotrimethylsilane | journal = Chem. Pharm. Bull. | volume = 34 | issue = 9 | pages = 3722–6 |date=September 1986 | pmid = 3815593 | doi = 10.1248/cpb.34.3722| url =http://www.journalarchive.jst.go.jp/english/jnlabstract_en.php?cdjournal=cpb1958&cdvol=34&noissue=9&startpage=3722 [/tpl]
A total synthesis of progesterone was reported in 1971 by W.S. Johnson (see figure to the right).[tpl]cite journal | author = Johnson WS, Gravestock MB, McCarry BE | title = Acetylenic bond participation in biogenetic-like olefinic cyclizations. II. Synthesis of dl-progesterone | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 93 | issue = 17 | pages = 4332–4 |date=August 1971 | pmid = 5131151 | doi = 10.1021/ja00746a062 | url =  [/tpl] The synthesis begins with reacting the phosphonium salt 7  with phenyl lithium to produce the phosphonium ylide 8.  The ylide 8 is reacted with an aldehyde to produce the alkene 9.  The ketal protecting groups of 9 are hydrolyzed to produce the diketone 10, which in turn is cyclized to form the cyclopentenone 11.  The ketone of 11 is reacted with methyl lithium to yield the tertiary alcohol 12, which in turn is treated with acid to produce the tertiary cation 13.  The key step of the synthesis is the π-cation cyclization of 13 in which the B-, C-, and D-rings of the steroid are simultaneously formed to produce 14.  This step resembles the cationic cyclization reaction used in the biosynthesis of steroids and hence is referred to as biomimetic. In the next step the enol orthoester is hydrolyzed to produce the ketone 15.  The cyclopentene A-ring is then opened by oxidizing with ozone to produce 16.  Finally, the diketone 17 undergoes an intramolecular aldol condensation by treating with aqueous potassium hydroxide to produce progesterone.

==Levels==

In women, progesterone levels are relatively low during the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, rise after ovulation, and are elevated during the luteal phase, as shown in diagram below. Progesterone levels tend to be  5 ng/ml after ovulation. If pregnancy occurs, human chorionic gonadotropin is released maintaining the corpus luteum allowing it to maintain levels of progesterone. At around 12 weeks the placenta begins to produce progesterone in place of the corpus luteum, this process is named the luteal-placental shift. After the luteal-placental shift progesterone levels start to rise further and may reach 100-200 ng/ml at term. Whether a decrease in progesterone levels is critical for the initiation of labor has been argued and may be species-specific. After delivery of the placenta and during lactation, progesterone levels are very low.
Progesterone levels are relatively low in children and postmenopausal women.[tpl]cite web | url = http://cclnprod.cc.nih.gov/dlm/testguide.nsf/Index/CB26894E1EB28DEF85256BA5005B000E?OpenDocument | title = Progesterone Historical Reference Ranges | accessdate = 2008-03-12 | author = NIH Clinical Center | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2004-08-16 | format = | work = | publisher = United States National Institutes of Health | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = [/tpl] Adult males have levels similar to those in women during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.
