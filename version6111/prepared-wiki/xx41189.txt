The Rome Braves are a Class-A minor league affiliate of the Atlanta Braves. In 2003, the team, previously known as the Macon Braves, moved from Macon, Georgia, to Rome, Georgia, 60 miles northwest of Atlanta.
Home games are played at State Mutual Stadium, which was built entirely from a SPLOST tax before State Mutual paid for the naming rights, opened April 11, 2003 and seats 5,105. In addition to three levels of regular seating, the stadium also features a lawn seating area known as "Applebee's Home Run Hill."  There are also 14 suites for VIP fans.

==Team management==

Randy Ingle was appointed manager of the team in 2006, replacing Rocket Wheeler, who moved to the other Class-A farm team for the Atlanta Braves, the Myrtle Beach Pelicans.  According to the official Rome Braves Website, 2008 marks Ingle's 30th year with the Braves organization. Ingle was replaced in 2011 by Matt Walbeck, but he did not last through the season, and was replaced by Rick Albert. To bring stability back to the team, Ingle returned to manage the team for its 2012 and 2013 seasons.
As the team's general manager, Michael Dunn is in charge of the front office staff, while Jim Jones is the assistant general manager.

==Team mascots==

The Rome Braves have two mascots, Romey and Roxie.  Romey is a tall (six-foot-three-inch), blue, furry humanoid male mascot with yellow hair, while Roxie, who was added to the team after the 2005 season, is five-feet-five-inches tall, humanoid, a lighter blue, and has a large yellow ponytail.
