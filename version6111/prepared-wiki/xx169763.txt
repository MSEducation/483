InAlienable is a 2008 science fiction film with horror and comic elements, written and produced by Walter Koenig, and directed by Robert Dyke. It was the first collaboration of Koenig and Dyke since their 1989 production of Moontrap.

==Plot==

Dr. Eric Norris remains wracked with guilt after a terrible tragedy that cost him his family, and when he learns that an alien parasite is not only growing inside him but shares his DNA, he develops a fiercely paternal bond with the creature. The alien "might regenerate into a surrogate son to replace his own child who was lost years earlier."[tpl]cite journal |author= Latchem, John |title= InAlienable |journal= Home Media Magazine |volume= 31 |number= 47 |date= Nov 23, 2009 |page= 18[/tpl] Koenig plays the antagonist, a scientific research institute administrator who dislikes Norris because he had been mutually in love with Norris's wife, who died; he blames Norris for his own now bleak life and enjoys insulting him. Norris, new love interest Amanda, and attorney Howard Ellis must defend the new child, Benjamin, from being imprisoned by government forces or, worse, destroyed. The courtroom trial covers such issues as habeas corpus and miscegenation.
At first horrified by the growth within him, Eric Norris comes to love the child that he "gives birth to" and names Benjamin. When a court trial begins to take Benjamin away from him, all sorts of arguments are raised about the real meaning of the word "alien." A disturbed man, Emil (Andrew Koenig, Walter Koenig's son), brings a gun into the courtroom and shoots Benjamin, to the loss of all concerned.
Koenig said that "the story really involves that relationship between the human being and the alien. At first, it's assumed that the alien is a parasite growing in a host, but because it has some of the human DNA, it's significantly more than that. Even though it comes from another world, it's a part of our world. Really, it's a love story."[tpl]cite news |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&p_topdoc=1&p_docnum=1&p_sort=YMD_date:D&p_product=AWNB&p_text_direct-0=document_id=(%2011980E49509D1510%20)&p_docid=11980E49509D1510&p_theme=aggdocs&p_queryname=11980E49509D1510&f_openurl=yes&p_nbid=Q60M49QHMTM1OTAzNTkzOS40ODA2OTg6MToxMjoxNjkuMTM5LjE5LjA&&p_multi=MDTB |author= Wildsmith, Steve |title= WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE: 'Trek' actor tries hand at writing, producing and starring in new sci-fi film |location= Maryville, Tenn. |newspaper= The Daily Times |date= May 31, 2007 |accessdate= January 24, 2013[/tpl]

==Production==

The screenplay was written by Walter Koenig of the original Star Trek series. He told Starburst magazine that he was watching the 2000 World Series with friends, one of whom had appeared in The Blob. "We proceeded to have other conversations along the way about making a film that, at least initially, began the same way as The Blob, with something landing from outer space. And I really took it from there."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.mediabistro.com/portfolios/samples_files/VlCeeZ0pGReK3by0RwcbEUQw7.pdf |author= Waldon, Dave |title= Star Trek star Walter Koenig discusses his new TV movie InAlienable, along with his fellow cast and crew |date= January 2008 |publisher= Starburst |accessdate= January 24, 2013[/tpl] He told interviewer Chris Wood (who identifies the friend as Anthony Franke), "I wanted to examine the intensity of familial bonding. That was one thing. I also wanted to explore the concept of civil and human rights. But the actual event that sat me down at the computer was when two friends of mine who didn't know each other joined me to watch the New York Yankees play in the World Series back in 2001. My friend Tony Franke had been in the original film of The Blob (1958) and Sky Conway had always been a big fan of the movie. Inspired by Tony's stories, Sky confessed to always wanting to shoot a film about a meteor landing with an alien presence aboard. I holed myself up in my room and took it from there."[tpl]cite web |url= http://subspacecommunique.com/node/679 |author= Wood, Chris (as Captain Pyke) |title= Walter Koenig's "InAlienable" Heading To DVD Plus Interview |publisher= Subspace Communiqué: Trek Culture Served Daily |date= February 1, 2010 |accessdate= January 24, 2013[/tpl]
It took Koenig a decade to bring the film to fruition. He initially wrote the lead role for himself, but reevaluated his view "that the audience would buy me as a romantic interest", and offered it to Battlestar Galactica's Richard Hatch.Interview: Walter Koenig (Writer/Producer of InAlienable), ScreenStar movie news He also considered playing attorney Ellis: "In retrospect, I might have had a great deal of fun playing the lawyer — which, I have to admit, Erick Avari so brilliantly played — but I love comedy and I think maybe I could've brought something to it."[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.yesweekly.com/triad/article-8434-walter-koenig-explores-a-new-frontier-in-inalienable.html |author= Burger, Mark |title= Walter Koenig explores a new frontier in InAlienable |newspaper= Yes!

Hatch talked about why he accepted the role: "It was very character-driven. It was about
people and relationships. It wasn't just about some monster or strange creature; it was
about human beings having to deal with very morally conflicted situations. I wasn't
choosing InAlienable because it was a science-fiction piece, although I love science
fiction. I was choosing it, as I choose any movie that I go watch, because it was about
something meaningful. It was about real people having to struggle with issues that all of
us have to face in our lives."
Marina Sirtis of Star Trek: The Next Generation and other familiar actors from sci-fi franchises were also willing to participate. Koenig's wife, son and daughter had roles on screen.
It was shot on location in Southern California. It is the first feature film made by Renegade Studios, and was released over the internet on a pay-per-view basis."InAlienable" Set for Release, PRWeb,com, November 12, 2007
The film's debut public screening was cut short by Koenig, as the visual quality on the screen at Conglomeration! 2008 was not up to his standards.Reporter-Times, Martinsville & Morgan County, Indiana.  Cited at Trek Today, April 24, 2008

==Reception==

The film received mixed reviews. Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes' summary, taken from Jason Buchanan of Rovi, declared: "A thought-provoking sci-fi drama headed up by a stellar cast, InAlienable tells the tale of a successful researcher who gives birth to an extraterrestrial child, and wages a passionate fight to defend his offspring from society and government scientists."http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inalienable_2009/#audience_reviews
The website Brutal As Hell wrote that the movie is "a film cheesier than a Kraft dairy farm and far more likable than it has any right to be," while faulting it for being "preachy, corny and overlong, with a shameless heart-string yanking climax."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.brutalashell.com/2010/02/dvd-review-inalienable/ |author= Riordan, Annie |title= DVD Review: InAlienable |date= February 14, 2010 |publisher= Brutalashell.com |accessdate= January 24, 2013[/tpl] Home Media Magazine wrote, "Like an episode of The Outer Limits, the story veers from expectations, merging traditional sci-fi motifs with the framework of a conventional courtroom drama... It's more thought-provoking than typical 'B'-movie fare, even if the proceedings are a bit hackneyed."[tpl]cite journal |author= Latchem, John |title= InAlienable |journal= Home Media Magazine |volume= 32 |number= 4 |date= January 25, 2010 |page= 20[/tpl] Total Sci-Fi Online granted only 1 star out of 10, saying, "At the core of InAlienable is an idea around which a terrific movie could be made, but unfortunately this isn't it."[tpl]cite web |url= http://totalscifionline.com/reviews/4539-inalienable |author= Holm, Patrick |title= InAlienable |date= 20 January 2010 |publisher= Total Sci-Fi Online|accessdate= January 24, 2013[/tpl] The website DVD Verdict wrote, "A courtroom thriller masquerading as a sci-fi drama, InAlienable is an intriguing effort with higher acting caliber than one might expect... InAlienable is far from groundbreaking cinema, but Koenig plays around with a lot of interesting ideas and themes. Not only does he play the slimy Schilling with tang, he also builds up his story well, keeping us hooked most of the way... What anchors the film is Hatch's powerful performance, but Peldon also makes a strong impression as his partner and lover."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/inalienable.php |author= Kulik, Christopher |date= January 26, 2010 |title= InAlienable |publisher= DVD Verdict |accessdate= January 24, 2013[/tpl]
