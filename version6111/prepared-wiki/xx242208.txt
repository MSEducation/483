The World Masters, known for sponsorship reasons as the Mita/Sky World Masters, was a snooker tournament held in January 1991. Conceived by promoter Barry Hearn, the tournament had a similar format to the Grand Slam events in tennis, with men's singles, men's doubles, women's singles, women's doubles, mixed doubles and a junior competition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/wmasters.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120228200111/http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/wmasters.html|archivedate=28 February 2012|title=Mita / Sky World Masters|publisher=Chris Turner's Snooker Archive|work=cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk|accessdate=17 May 2010[/tpl] Staged at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, it carried a record amount of prize money; the winner of the men's singles won Â£200,000, more than the world champion would earn that year.[tpl]cite book|last=Downer|first=Chris|title=Crucible Almanac|year=2012|pages=130[/tpl] During the tournament James Wattana made the ninth official maximum break against Paul Dawkins.[tpl]cite web|last=Turner|first=Chris|url=http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Max.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130210111304/http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Max.html|archivedate=10 February 2013|title=Maximum Breaks|publisher=Chris Turner's Snooker Archive|work=cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk|accessdate=2 April 2010[/tpl] The tournament was subsequently unable to find sponsorship, and was not staged again.
