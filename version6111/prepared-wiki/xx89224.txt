[[Discrepancy function]]

CATEGORIES: Structural equation models

A discrepancy function is a mathematical function which describes how closely a structural model conforms to observed data. Larger values of the discrepancy function indicate a poor fit of the model to data. In general, the parameter estimates for a given model are chosen so as to make the discrepancy function for that model as small as possible. 
There are several basic types of discrepancy functions, including maximum likelihood (ML), generalized least squares (GLS), and ordinary least squares (OLS), which are considered the "classical" discrepancy functions.[tpl]cite web | title = Discrepancy Functions Used in SEM | url = http://www2.gsu.edu/~mkteer/discrep.html | accessdate=2008-08-18 [/tpl]  Discrepancy functions all meet the following basic criteria:
In order for "maximum likelihood" to meet the first criterion, it is used in a revised form as the deviance.
