Shirin Ebadi ([tpl]lang-fa|[tpl]big|شيرين عبادى[/tpl][/tpl] Širin Ebādi; born 21 June 1947) is an Iranian lawyer, a former judge and human rights activist and founder of Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran. On 10 October 2003, Ebadi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her significant and pioneering efforts for democracy and human rights, especially women's, children's, and refugee rights. She was the first ever Iranian to receive the prize.
In 2009, Ebadi's award was allegedly confiscated by Iranian authorities, though this was later denied by the Iranian government.[tpl]cite news|author=Reuters|url=http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2009/11/27/world/international-uk-norway-iran-nobel.html|title=Iran Denies It Confiscated Ebadi's Nobel Medal|date=27 November 2009|accessdate=27 November 2009|work=The New York Times[/tpl] If true, she would be the first person in the history of the Nobel Prize whose award has been forcibly seized by state authorities.Norway says Iran confiscated Ebadi's Nobel Reuters 27 November
Ebadi lived in Tehran, but she has been in exile in the UK since June 2009 due to the increase in persecution of Iranian citizens who are critical of the current regime."Shirin Ebadi: The Activist in Exile" Newsweek 30 March 2010 In 2004, she was listed by Forbes magazine as one of the "100 most powerful women in the world".Forbes.com: Forbes 100 Most Powerful Women in the World 2004 She is also included in a published list of the "100 most influential women of all time."[tpl]cite book|author=Britannica Educational Publishing|title=The 100 Most Influential Women of All Time|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3gVvaAUcnq0C&pg=PA330|accessdate=15 January 2012|date=1 October 2009|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-61530-058-7|pages=330–331[/tpl]

==Life and early career as a judge==

Ebadi was born in Hamadan, Iran. Her father, Mohammad Ali Ebadi, was the city's chief notary public and a professor of commercial law. Her family moved to Tehran in 1948.
She was admitted to the law department of the University of Tehran in 1965 and in 1969, upon graduation, passed the qualification exams to become a judge. After a six-month internship period, she officially became a judge in March 1969. She continued her studies in University of Tehran in the meantime to pursue a doctorate's degree in law in 1971. In 1975, she became the first woman president of the Tehran city court, and also the first ever woman judge in Iran.[tpl]cite news|title=Profile: Shirin Ebadi|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3181992.stm|work=article|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5/4/2012|date=27 November 2009[/tpl]
Following the Iranian revolution in 1979, conservative clerics insisted that Islam prohibits women from becoming judges and Ebadi was demoted to a secretarial position at the branch where she had previously presided. She and other female judges protested and were assigned to the slightly higher position of "law expert." She eventually requested early retirement as the situation remained unchanged.
As her applications were repeatedly rejected, Ebadi was not able to practice as a lawyer until 1993, while she already had a law office permit. She used this free time to write books and many articles in Iranian periodicals.

==Ebadi as a lawyer==

Ebadi now lectures law at the University of Tehran and is a campaigner for strengthening the legal status of children and women, the latter of which played a key role in the May 1997 landslide presidential election of the reformist Mohammad Khatami.
As a lawyer, she is known for taking up pro bono cases of dissident figures who have fallen foul of the judiciary. She has represented the family of Dariush Forouhar, a dissident intellectual and politician who was found stabbed to death at his home. His wife, Parvaneh Eskandari, was also killed at the same time.
The couple were among several dissidents who died in a spate of grisly murders that terrorized Iran's intellectual community. Suspicion fell on extremist hard-liners determined to put a stop to the more liberal climate fostered by President Khatami, who championed freedom of speech. The murders were found to be committed by a team of the employees of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence, whose head, Saeed Emami, allegedly committed suicide in jail before being brought to court.
Ebadi also represented the family of Ezzat Ebrahim-Nejad, who was killed in the Iranian student protests in July 1999. In 2000 Ebadi was accused of manipulating the videotaped confession of Amir Farshad Ebrahimi, a former member of the Ansar-e Hezbollah. Ebrahimi confessed his involvement in attacks made by the organization on the orders of high-level conservative authorities, which have included the killing of Ezzat Ebrahim-Nejad  and attacks against members of President Khatami's cabinet. Ebadi claimed that she had only videotaped Amir Farshad Ebrahimi's confessions in order to present them to the court. This case was named "Tape makers" by hardliners who questioned the credibility of his videotaped deposition as well as his motives. Ebadi and Rohami were sentenced to five years in jail and suspension of their law licenses for sending Ebrahimi's videotaped deposition to Islamic President Khatami and the head of the Islamic judiciary. The sentences were later vacated by the Islamic judiciary's supreme court, but they did not forgive Ebarahimi's videotaped confession and sentenced him to 48 months jail, including 16 months in solitary confinement.[tpl]cite web|title=Autobiography|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2003/ebadi-autobio.html|work=article|publisher=NobelPrize.org|accessdate=5/4/2012[/tpl]  This case brought increased focus on Iran from human rights groups abroad.
Ebadi has also defended various child abuse cases and a few cases dealing with bans of periodicals (including the cases of Habibollah Peyman, Abbas Marufi, and Faraj Sarkouhi). She has also established two non-governmental organizations in Iran with western funding, the Society for Protecting the Rights of the Child (SPRC) and the Defenders of Human Rights Center (DHRC).
She also helped in the drafting of the original text of a law against physical abuse of children, which was passed by the Iranian parliament in 2002.

==Political views==

In her book Iran Awakening, Ebadi explains her political/religious views on Islam, democracy and gender equality
 In the last 23 years, from the day I was stripped of my judgeship to the years of doing battle in the revolutionary courts of Tehran, I had repeated one refrain: an interpretation of Islam that is in harmony with equality and democracy is an authentic expression of faith. It is not religion that binds women, but the selective dictates of those who wish them cloistered. That belief, along with the conviction that change in Iran must come peacefully and from within, has underpinned my work."Ebadi, Shirin, Iran Awakening: A Memoir of Revolution and Hope, by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House, 2006, p.204 
At the same time, Ebadi expresses a nationalist love of Iran and a critical view of the Western world. She opposed the pro-Western Shah, initially supported the Islamic Revolution, and remembers the CIA's 1953 overthrow of prime minister Mohammad Mosaddeq with rage.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
At a press conference shortly after the Peace Prize announcement, Ebadi herself explicitly rejected foreign interference in the country's affairs: "The fight for human rights is conducted in Iran by the Iranian people, and we are against any foreign intervention in Iran."Washington Post: Nobels With a Message, last retrieved on 12 October 2007Working for Change: Eyes off the prize, last retrieved on 12 October 2007
Subsequently, Ebadi has openly defended the Islamic regime's nuclear development programme: 
 Aside from being economically justified, it has become a cause of national pride for an old nation with a glorious history. No Iranian government, regardless of its ideology or democratic credentials, would dare to stop the program.The Sydney Morning Herald: Sunnis fear US missteps will bolster Tehran's influence, last retrieved on 12 October 2007 
However, in a 2012 interview, Ebadi has stated: "The Iranian people want to stop enrichment but the government doesn’t listen. Iran is situated on a fault line and people are scared of a Fukushima type of situation happening. We want peace, security, and economic welfare, and we cannot forgo all of our other rights for nuclear energy. The government claims it is not making a bomb. But I am not a member of the government, so I cannot speak to this directly. The fear is that if they do, Israel will be wiped out. If the Iranian people are able to topple the government, this could improve the situation. 2009 the people of Iran rose up and were badly suppressed. Right now, Iran is the country with the most journalists in prison. This is the price people are paying."Shirin Ebadi Interview: Iran’s Voice of Reason on Nuke Talks Daily Beast
Ebadi also indirectly expressed her views on Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In April 2010, Associated Students of the University of California passed a bill calling for the University to Divest itself from what it saw as Israeli war crimes, by breaking ties with companies providing technology to the Israel Defense Forces. Shirin Ebadi, together with three other Peace Prize laureates, supported the bill.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.caldivestfromapartheid.com/2010/04/28/statement-of-support-from-nobel-peace-laureates/|title=Statement of Support from Nobel Women Peace Laureates|date=28 April 2010|accessdate=1 May 2010[/tpl]
Regarding her views on the Shia religion in Iran, she has said, after the Arabs came, and Iran converted to Islam, "Eventually we turned to the Shiite sect, which was different from the Arabs, who are Sunni" noting Persians were still Muslims but "We were Iranian."http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/08/iran-archaeology/del-giudice-text/6
Since the victory of Hassan Rouhani in 2013 Iranian presidential election Shirin Ebadi in various occasions has expressed her worry about the growing human rights violations in her homeland. Ebadi in her Dec. 2013 speech at Human Rights Day seminar at Leiden University angrily said: "I will shut up but the problems of Iran will not be solved".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iirKRqU4Bw4

==Nobel Peace Prize [tpl]anchor|Nobel Peace Prize[/tpl]==

On 10 October 2003, Shirin Ebadi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children.Nobelprize.org: The Nobel Peace Prize 2003, last retrieved on 12 October 2007 The selection committee praised her as a "courageous person" who "has never heeded the threat to her own safety".bbc.co.uk: Nobel winner's plea to Iran, last retrieved on 12 October 2007 Now she travels abroad lecturing in the West. She is against a policy of forced regime change. Her husband, Javad Tavassolian, was an advisor to President Khatami.
The decision of the Nobel committee surprised some observers worldwide. Pope John Paul II had been predicted to win the Peace Prize amid speculation that he was nearing death. Some observers, mostly supporters of Pope John Paul II, viewed her selection as a calculated and political one, along the lines of the selection of Lech Wałęsa and Mikhail Gorbachev, among others, for the Peace Prize. They denied that Ebadi's activities were directly related to the goals of the prize, as originally stated by Alfred Nobel. According to his will, the prize should be awarded "to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses".[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]
She presented a book entitled Democracy, human rights, and Islam in modern Iran: Psychological, social and cultural perspectives to the Nobel Committee. The volume documents the historical and cultural basis of democracy and human rights from Cyrus and Darius, 2,500 years ago to Mohammad Mossadeq, the Prime Minister of modern Iran who nationalized the oil industry.
In Iran, officials of the Islamic Republic were either silent or critical of the selection of Ebadi, calling it a political act by a pro-Western institution and were also critical when Ebadi did not cover her hair at the Nobel award ceremony.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.iran-press-service.com/articles_2003/Dec-2003/khatami_interview_121203.htm |title=Iranian Muslim Women Are Free To Wear Or Not The Hejab: Mohammad Khatami|author=Safa Haeri |agency=Iran Press Service, |accessdate=9 June 2011[/tpl]  IRNA reported it in few lines that the evening newspapers and the Iranian state media waited hours to report the Nobel committee's decision—and then only as the last item on the radio news update.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iran-press-service.com/articles_2003/Oct-2003/ebadi_wins_nobel_peace_101003.html |title=Iranians Celebrated With Joy Ebadi’S Nobel Peace Prize By Safa Haeri |publisher=Iran Press Service |accessdate=9 June 2011[/tpl] Reformist officials are said to have "generally welcomed the award", but "come under attack for doing so."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3190536.stm |title=Khatami advice to Nobel laureate, October 14, 2003 |publisher=BBC News  |date=14 October 2003 |accessdate=9 June 2011[/tpl] Reformist president Mohammad Khatami did not officially congratulate Ms. Ebadi and stated that although the scientific Nobels are important, the Peace Prize is "not very important" and was awarded to Ebadi on the basis of "totally political criteria".  Vice President Mohammad Ali Abtahi, the only official to initially congratulate Ebadi, defended the president saying "abusing the President's words about Ms. Ebadi is tantamount to abusing the prize bestowed on her for political considerations".[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]

==Post-Nobel prize==

Since receiving the Nobel Prize Ebadi has lectured, taught and received awards in different countries, issued statements and defended people accused of political crimes in Iran. She has traveled to and spoken to audiences in India, the United States, and other countries; released her autobiography in an English translation. With five other Nobel laureates, she created the Nobel Women's Initiative to promote peace, justice and equality for women.[tpl]cite book|author=Karen L.

===Threats===

In April 2008 she told Reuters news agency that Iran's human rights record had regressed in the past two years[tpl]cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-33055820080415 |title=Iran to probe threats against Nobel laureate Ebadi |agency=Reuters |date=15 April 2008 |accessdate=9 June 2011[/tpl] and agreed to defend Baha’is arrested in Iran in May 2008.
In April 2008 Ebadi released a statement saying: "Threats against my life and security and those of my family, which began some time ago, have intensified," and that the threats warned her against making speeches abroad, and defending Iran's minority Baha'i community.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7347047.stm |title=BBC NEWS.

It also criticized Ebadi for defending homosexuals, appearing without the Islamic headscarf abroad, questioning Islamic punishments, and "defending CIA agents."[tpl]cite web|url=http://media.www.mcgilltribune.com/media/storage/paper234/news/2008/12/02/News/Iranian.Press.Targets.Nobel.Prize.Winner.Ebadi-3564990.shtml |title=Iranian press targets Nobel Prize winner Ebadi |publisher=Media.www.mcgilltribune.com |accessdate=9 June 2011[/tpl] It accused her daughter, Nargess Tavassolian, of conversion to the Bahá'í faith, a capital offense in the Islamic Republic. Her daughter believes "the government wanted to scare my mother with this scenario." Ebadi believes the attacks are in retaliation for her agreeing to defend the families of the seven Baha’is arrested in May.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iran-press-service.com/ips/articles-2008/august2008/by-attacking-mrs-shirin-ebadi-the-islamic-republic.shtml |title=By Attacking Mrs. Shirin Ebadi, The Islamic Republic Revives Stalinian Methods |author=Safa Haeri |publisher=Iran-press-service.com |date=9 August 2008 |accessdate=9 June 2011[/tpl]

===Seizure===

Ebadi said while in London in late November 2009 that her Nobel Peace Prize medal and diploma had been taken from their bank box alongside her Légion d'honneur and a ring she had received from Germany's association of journalists. She said they had been taken by the Revolutionary Court approximately three weeks previously.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8382008.stm|title=Shirin Ebadi Nobel Peace Prize medal 'seized by Iran'|date=27 November 2009|accessdate=27 November 2009|publisher=BBC [/tpl]Iran Confiscates Shirin Ebadi’s Nobel Peace Medal in Want of Tax Liability[tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/11/27/nobel-iran-ebadi.html |title=Outrage after Iran seizes Nobel medal |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=27 November 2009 |accessdate=9 June 2011[/tpl] Ebadi also said her bank account was frozen by authorities.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/6669252/Iran-confiscates-Shirin-Ebadis-Nobel-Peace-Prize.html|title=Iran confiscates Shirin Ebadi's Nobel Peace Prize|date=27 November 2009|accessdate=27 November 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/world/161265/iran-illegally-freezes-ebadi-assets-colleague|title=Ebadi defiant despite Iran assets seizure|date=27 November 2009|accessdate=27 November 2009|work=Bangkok Post[/tpl] Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr Støre expressed his "shock and disbelief" at the incident.

==Lawsuits==

===Lawsuit against the United States===

In 2004, Ebadi filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Treasury because of restrictions she faced over publishing her memoir in the United States. American trade laws include prohibitions on writers from embargoed countries. The law also banned American literary agent Wendy Strothman from working with Ebadi. Azar Nafisi wrote a letter in support of Ebadi. Nafisi said that the law infringes on the First Amendment.[tpl]cite web|author=All Things Considered |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4204087 |title=Iranian Nobel Winner Suing U.S. over Memoir |publisher=NPR |date=5 December 2004 |accessdate=9 June 2011[/tpl] After a long legal battle, Ebadi won and was able to publish her memoir in the United States.[tpl]cite web|author=All Things Considered |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4235765 |title=Ebadi Wins Round with U.S. over Memoirs |publisher=NPR |date=19 December 2004 |accessdate=9 June 2011[/tpl]

===Lawsuit over non-publication===

According to the Associated Press, on 27 August 2007, Ebadi was sued by a Canadian author and political analyst, Shahir Shahidsaless—who writes and publishes in Persian—in U.S. District Court in Manhattan saying she reneged on getting a publisher for a book she had requested him to write under her supervision, titled "A Useful Enemy". The initial suit was dismissed due to lack of jurisdiction of the court, and not the substance of the case, which was never tried. The case is currently[tpl]Update after|2013|10|2[/tpl] being considered at the New York State Court.
