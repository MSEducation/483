Film Portrait (1972) is a full-length autobiographical movie directed by, and about, the life of Minnesotan film-maker and artist, Jerome Hill. It was selected as an outstanding Film of the Year for presentation at the  London Film Festival in 1972 and won the Gold Dukat Prize at the 21st Annual Mannheim Film Festival. 
Jerome Hill died shortly after the completion of Film Portrait, and so the work is often described as his memoir.
In 2003, Film Portrait was added to the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress, recognizing the cultural, historical and aesthetic significance of the work, as well as ensuring the preservation of the original film footage.
