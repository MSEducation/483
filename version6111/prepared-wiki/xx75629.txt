The Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor, Op. 30, composed in 1909 by Sergei Rachmaninoff has the reputation of being one of the most technically challenging piano concertos in the standard classical repertoire.

==Form==

Following the form of a standard concerto, the piece is in three movements:
Rachmaninoff, under pressure, and hoping to make his work more popular, authorized several cuts in the score, to be made at the performer's discretion.  These cuts, particularly in the second and third movements, were commonly taken in performance and recordings during the initial decades following the Concerto's publication.  More recently, it has become commonplace to perform the concerto without cuts.  A typical performance of the complete concerto lasts about forty minutes.

==History==

Rachmaninoff composed the concerto in the peaceful setting of his family's country estate, Ivanovka,[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.sfcv.org/learn/composer-gallery/7424 | title=Rachmaninov, Sergei : San Francisco Classical Voice | accessdate=2010-08-26[/tpl] completing it on September 23, 1909. Contemporary with this work are his First Piano Sonata and his tone poem The Isle of the Dead - both in the same key of D minor.
The concerto is respected, even feared, by many pianists. Josef Hofmann, the pianist to whom the work is dedicated, never publicly performed it, saying that it "wasn't for" him. Gary Graffman lamented he had not learned this concerto as a student, when he was "still too young to know fear".David Dubal, The Art of the Piano, Third Edition (2004), Amadeus Press
Due to time constraints, Rachmaninoff could not practice the piece while in Russia. Instead, he practiced it on a silent keyboard that he brought with him while en route to the United States.
The concerto was first performed on November 28, 1909 by Rachmaninoff himself with the now-defunct New York Symphony Society with Walter Damrosch conducting, at the New Theater (later rechristened the Century Theater).  It received a second performance under Gustav Mahler several weeks later, an "experience Rachmaninoff treasured."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.orsymphony.org/concerts/0405/programnotes/classical2.html| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050420080410/http://www.orsymphony.org/concerts/0405/programnotes/classical2.html| title=Program Notes: Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3| archivedate=2005-04-20| accessdate=2013-03-01| deadurl=yes[/tpl] The manuscript was first published in 1910 by Gutheil. 
Rachmaninoff called the Third the favorite of his own piano concertos, stating that "I much prefer the Third, because my Second is so uncomfortable to play."  Nevertheless, it was not until the 1930s and largely thanks to the advocacy of Vladimir Horowitz that the Third concerto became popular.

==Orchestration==

The concerto is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, snare drum, cymbals, piano and strings.

==Selected recordings==

==In film==

The concerto is one of the main foci of the 1996 film Shine, based on the life of pianist David Helfgott.
