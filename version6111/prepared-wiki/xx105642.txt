Havoc is renowned among serious hip-hop fans as one of the prominent figures during the mid-1990s for his hard-hitting and stripped-down beats complementary to the RZA's work on Wu-Tang Clan projects. Following The Infamous, he tweaked his skills and transitioned to a more atmospheric production style that incorporated samples from classical music, most notably visible on the 1996 album Hell on Earth. As an MC, he is known for his hardcore lyricism, deep voice, and consistent flow.  He also contributed background vocals and a verse on Black Moon's debut album Enta da Stage in 1993.
In July 2009, Havoc was featured alongside Raekwon in J Dilla's music video for "24K Rap" off of the Jay Stay Paid album, the video was directed by Derek Pike. In 2010, Havoc produced a beat for Eminem which resulted in a song called "Untitled" which is a hidden track on Eminem's album Recovery and contributed to the iTunes bonus track to Raekwon's album Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang &  Bad Meets Evil's Hell: The Sequel EP. He revealed that he plans on recording a new Mobb album with Nas.[tpl]cite web|last=Vasquez |first=Andres |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.15279/title.mobb-deep-nas-to-collaborate-on-full-length-lp-says-havoc |title=Mobb Deep & Nas To Collaborate On Full-Length LP, Says Havoc | Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2012-03-30[/tpl] His third studio album 13 was released on May 7, 2013.
