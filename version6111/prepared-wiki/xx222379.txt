==History==

===Foundation===

Allianz AG was founded in Berlin on 5 February 1890 by then director of the Munich Reinsurance Company Carl von Thieme (a native of Erfurt, whose father was the director of Thuringia) and Wilhelm von Finck (co-owner of the Merck Finck & Co bank). The joint company was listed in Berlin's trade register[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=EDjSAAAAIAAJ&q=Allianz+AG+February+5,+1890&dq=Allianz+AG+February+5,+1890&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0GHlUba2Dc-o4APp_4DYBQ&redir_esc=y |title=Germany, Inc: the new German juggernaut and its challenge to world business |page=130 |accessdate=July 16, 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=John Wiley |author=Werner Meyer-Larsen[/tpl] under the name  Allianz Versicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft.[tpl]cite web |url=http://secfilings.nyse.com/filing.php?ipage=3709166&DSEQ=&SEQ=17&SQDESC=SECTION_PAGE |accessdate=July 16, 2013 |publisher=SEC Filing |title=ALLIANZ AG |year=2005[/tpl] The first Allianz products were marine and accident policies first sold only in Germany, however in 1893 Allianz opened its first international branch office in London. It distributed marine insurance coverage to German clientele looking for coverage abroad.
In 1900 the company became the first insurer to obtain a license to distribute corporate policies. In 1904 Paul Von Naher took over the sole leadership of the company, as it moved into the US and other markets. Markets entered by 1914 included the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, France, the Scandinavian countries and the Baltic States, and Allianz had become the largest maritime insurer in Germany. The company suffered an early disaster in expansion, when the 1906 San Francisco earthquake caused the company to sustain 300,000 marks in losses. In 1905 the company acquired Fides Insurance Company, a firm that had innovated the first form of home invasion insurance.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=kractQ2Eiz0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Allianz&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_bHlUYuUEPO44APLt4H4Aw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Allianz&f=false |page=3 |title=Allianz and the German Insurance Business, 1933-1945 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=July 16, 2013 |year=2001 |author=Gerald Donald Feldman[/tpl] Other places it would expand into during the 1910s and 1920s included Palestine, Cyprus, Iraq, China, the Dutch Indies, Ceylon, and Siam.Feldman, 46.

===20th century developments===

In 1905 the company began to offer fire insurance, and in 1911 it began to sell machinery breakdown policies. Allianz remained the only company in the world that sold machine breakdown insurance until 1924. Then in 1918 it began to offer automobile insurance as well. In 1921 Von Naher passed away, and was succeeded by Kurt Schmitt. The company would begin to offer life insurance as of 1922, becoming Europe's largest offerer of the policies by the end of the 1920s.
In 1927 Allianz merged with Stuttgarter Verein Versicherung AG and [tpl]cite web |url=http://atlas-mag.net/en/article/allianz-a-success-story |title=Allianz, a success story |accessdate=July 16, 2013 |publisher=Atlas Magazine |date=October 2011[/tpl] two years later acquired the insurance businesses of Favag, a large German insurer that declared bankruptcy due to the onset of the Great Depression.Feldman, 21-24. Expansion of the company then slowed until 1938Feldman, 28. at which point it employed more than 24,000 people.Feldman, 35. Christian Stadler wrote of the history of Allianz that it "shows how important it is to diversify into related areas to hedge against the risk of fundamental changes in markets and economies".[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=96zaVr4jFesC&pg=PA120&dq=Allianz&hl=en&sa=X&ei=G8PmUfn6K9i84APtwoDQAg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Allianz&f=false |page=120 |title=Enduring Success: What We Can Learn from the History of Outstanding Corporations |accessdate=July 17, 2013 |year=2011 |publisher=Stanford University Press |author=Christian Stadler[/tpl]
During World War II the Munich headquarters of Allianz were destroyed by Allied bombing runs. Following the end of the war in 1945, Hans Heb became head of the company, and Allianz shifted its headquarters to Munich in 1949 due to the split between East and West Germany. Heb only held the position until 1948, when he was replaced by Hans Goudefroy. After World War II, global business activities were gradually resumed. Allianz opened an office in Paris in 1959, and started repurchasing stakes in former subsidiaries in Italy and Austria. In 1971 Wolfgang Schieren became the head of the company.
These expansions were followed in the 1970s by the establishment of business in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Brazil and the United States. In 1986, Allianz acquired Cornhill Insurance PLC, London, and the purchase of a stake in Riunione Adriatica di Sicurità (RAS), Milan, strengthened its presence in Western and Southern Europe in the 1980s.
In 1990, Allianz started an expansion into eight Eastern European countries with establishing a presence in Hungary. In the same decade, Allianz also acquired Fireman's Fund, an insurer in the United States, which was followed by the purchase of Assurances Générales de France (AGF), Paris. These acquisitions were followed by the expansion into Asia with several joint ventures and acquisitions in China and South Korea and the acquisition of Australia's Manufacturers Mutual Insurance. Around this time Allianz expanded its asset management business as well by purchasing for example asset management companies in California.

===Allianz in the 21st century===

In April 2001, Allianz agreed to acquire the 80 per cent of Dresdner Bank that it did not already own for US$20 billion. As part of the transaction, Allianz agreed to sell its 13.5 per cent stake in HypoVereinsbank to Munich Re, and to acquire Munich Re's 40 per cent stake in Allianz Leben.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/02/business/allianz-says-it-will-acquire-dresdner-bank-for-20-billion.html|title=Allianz Says It Will Acquire Dresdner Bank for $20 Billion|accessdate=28 May 2012|work=The New York Times|date=2 April 2001[/tpl] Following completion of the acquisition, Allianz and Dresdner Bank combined their asset management activities by forming Allianz Global Investors. In 2002, Michael Diekmann succeeded Henning Schulte-Noelle as CEO of Allianz AG. In June 2006, Allianz announced the layoff of 7,280 employees, about 4 percent of its worldwide work force at the time, as part of a restructuring program aimed at raising profitability. The reductions comprised 5,000 staff at Allianz insurance operations and 2,480 at Dresdner Bank.
