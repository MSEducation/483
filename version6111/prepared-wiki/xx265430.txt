How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming is the title of the 2010 memoir by Mike Brown, the Caltech astronomer most responsible for the reclassification of Pluto from planet to dwarf planet.

==Summary==

The memoir is an account of the events surrounding the redefinition ofÂ the term planet that eventually changed the status of Pluto. It chronicles the discovery of Eris, a dwarf planet then thought to be even larger than Pluto, located within the Kuiper belt, beyond Neptune's orbit. The replaying of events include the adversarial challenging of long-held scientific beliefs between some of the world's leading astronomers, and the eventual 2006 International Astronomical Union's vote that removed Pluto from the list of Solar System planets.

==Reviews==

Reviews of the book have been generally positive, with James Kennedy of the Wall Street Journal calling the book a "brisk" and "enjoyable ... chronicle" of the tale of the search for new planets and the eventual demotion of Pluto from planetary status. Janet Maslin of the New York Times called it a "short, eager-to-please research memoir".
