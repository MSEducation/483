The TSB Bank Festival of Lights is an annual event held in Pukekura Park, New Plymouth.  Running for free every year from mid-December to early February, it has daytime and night time programmes of events for people of all ages, and the festival itself transforms the park into an illuminated wonderland every evening.
Colourful lights are used to highlight tree crowns, ferns, and other plants.  Light art displays are installed along the festival walking route and the waterfall is lit in changing colors.
The festival has been a major summer attraction and cultural event for the city since 1993,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nz2011.govt.nz/realnzfestival/events/131-taranaki-festival-of-lights|title=Taranaki Festival of Lights|publisher=NewZealand2011|accessdate=4 February 2011[/tpl] and is attended by over 100,000 people each year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/news/4601980/Festival-of-Lights-attracts-community-visitors|title=Festival of Lights attracts community, visitors|first=Kate |last=Saunders |date=1 February 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2011|publisher=Taranaki Daily News[/tpl]
