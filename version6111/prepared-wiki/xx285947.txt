==Market research==

PH Media Group has commissioned several studies to gauge perceptions among both consumers and business of music on hold and on-hold marketing.
In November 2011, a survey was conducted among 2,000 UK consumers concerning phone calls made to businesses. Findings included:
70% of consumers are put on hold for more than 50% of their calls; 68% of consumers are put on hold for longer than one minute; 73% of consumers want to hear something other than beeps or silence while on hold; 72% of personal calls to businesses are made at home on a landline; 60% of consumers are in front of a computer while on hold.

Research into the use of regional accents and dialect by UK businesses in their on-hold marketing found a 27% rise in the use of accents between January 2012 and January 2013.
The research also looked into perceptions of accents. For example, it found the Scottish accent is perceived as trustworthy and reassuring while the Yorkshire accent, used by brands such as O2 (United Kingdom) in television and radio advertising, is seen as wise and honest.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.prolificnorth.co.uk/2013/02/by-eck-accents-are-back-in-fashion-tha-nos/ |title=By 'eck accents are back in fashion tha nos |publisher=Prolific North[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/diary/business-diary-january-29-1-5362401 |title=Business Diary: January 29 |publisher=Yorkshire Post[/tpl]
Another study, conducted among 3,630 UK companies in March 2013, looked into the amount of time customers spend on hold while making calls to business. The average hold time was 33.48 seconds. During this time spent on hold, 34% of businesses left callers listening to silence, 26% played music, 26% played beeps and 7% used on-hold marketing messages.[tpl]cite web |url=http://britishsme.co.uk/2013/04/04/research-reveals-lost-calls-spell-danger-for-uk-business/ |title=Research reveals lost calls spell danger for UK business |publisher=British SME[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ingeniousbritain.biz/latest-news/management-and-hr/drive-profitability-with-good-call-handling/1009/100805 |title=Drive profitability with good call handling |publisher=Ingenious Britain[/tpl]
