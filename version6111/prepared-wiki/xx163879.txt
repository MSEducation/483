Tarff Rovers F.C. are a defunct football club from Kirkcowan in Wigtownshire, Scotland.
One of Scotland's oldest clubs, they were formed in 1874 and were full members of both the Scottish Football Association and the Southern Counties Football Associations. Having full SFA status entitled Rovers to compete in the Scottish Qualifying Cup South competition and, on occasion, play in the Scottish Cup proper.
The club's finest hour came in 1967 when they faced Scottish League side Alloa Athletic in the Scottish Cup. This home tie saw Tarff triumph by one goal to nil. Despite belonging to a remote and sparsely populated part of Scotland - indeed Kirkcowan's current population is less than 400 - Tarff enjoyed certain periods of success. Perhaps the most notable of these came during their final few years of existence when several league titles, cup wins and big name signings, including Chic Charnley and Rowan Alexander, came the way of Tarff Rovers thanks to a local businessman's financial assistance.
Despite their recent successes in football in southern Scotland, the club folded in 2003 when local interest quickly dwindled to the point where a committee could not be formed. The club's home ground Balgreen Park still exists and is currently used by local Sunday league side Kirkcowan Wanderers.
