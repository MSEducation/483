The discography of Swedish recording artist Robyn consists of five studio albums, two compilation albums, two extended plays and twenty four singles.
Robyn became known in the late nineties for her worldwide dance-pop hit "Do You Know (What It Takes)" from her debut album Robyn Is Here (1997). She co-wrote the song "Du g√∂r mig hel igen" (You Make Me Whole Again) for Melodifestivalen 1997. The popularity of her #1 hit single "With Every Heartbeat", and subsequent album release Robyn (2005), brought her mainstream success worldwide. In January 2009 Robyn won a Swedish Grammis award for Best Live Act 2008.
Robyn released the first of a trilogy of albums to be released over the course of 2010 titled Body Talk Pt. 1, in June of that year, peaking at #1. It was her first album since Robyn. The album's lead single "Dancing on My Own" was released a few weeks prior to the album's release, and became a hit single worldwide, and brought her a 53rd Grammy Awards nomination for the category of Best Dance Recording.
