==Life History==

R. tristis is associated with Stylosanthes guinaensis, and this association is thought to be due to the prey species attracted by flowers of S. guinaensis.[ref] Thomas, L. K. & Manica, A. 2003. Filial cannibalism in an assassin
bug. Animal Behaviour, 66, 205–210.[/ref]  R. tristis is unusual in the insect world in that males provide paternal care by guarding egg masses.

Males will also cannibalize some of the eggs that they guard. Thomas, L. K. 1994. The evolution of parental care in assassin bugs. Ph.D. thesis, University of Cambridge.  R. tristis prefers to lay its eggs on the stems of plants, in contrast to most members of the harpactorinae, which prefer to lay them on the undersides of leaves.
