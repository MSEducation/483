==History==

Originally called Faya, the town was renamed Largeau after French Colonel Étienne Largeau; upon Chadian independence from France, it assumed the name Faya-Largeau. The town was captured by Libya when Libya annexed the Aouzou Strip in 1975, but was retaken by Hissène Habré's forces in 1980.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/chad.htm | title = Libyan Intervention in Chad, 1980-Mid-1987| accessdate = 2007-01-01| publisher = GlobalSecurity.org[/tpl] Libya recaptured Faya-Largeau in 1983, but retreated in 1987.
