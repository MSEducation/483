Reducción de Nuestra Señora de Santa Ana (Reduction of Our Lady of Saint Ana) was one of the many missions or reductions founded in the 17th century by the Jesuits in the Americas during the Spanish colonial period. It was within what the Spanish then called the Province of Paraguay.
The Spanish relocated Guarani Native Americans from scattered villages to the reductions, where they established mission centers. These generally were modeled on Spanish rural villages, complete with a town square bounded by a church and administrative buildings. Nuestra Señora de Santa Ana was founded in 1633, and is located in the present-day Candelaria Department of the Misiones Province, Argentina.
It is 2 kilometers from Santa Ana, the chief city of the department. The ruins of Nuestra Señora de Santa Ana are not far from the reduccion site of San Ignacio Miní. Like most settlements of the era, the reducciones were located along waterways, which supplied drinking and washing water, and were used for transportation and trade.
In 1984 Nuestra Señora de Santa Ana was one of four sites of Jesuit reductions in Argentina and one in Brazil to be declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.List of World Heritage Sites, UNESCO
