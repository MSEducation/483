Jake in Progress is an American comedy series broadcast on ABC from 2005 to 2006. Created by Austin Winsberg, the show was originally conceived as a real-time comedy; the first season was to show the first date of Jake and a woman.  This was dropped during development, and the show became more conventional and episodic. The first aired episode reflected the original plan, and covering the first half-hour of a date.

==Synopsis==

The main character is Jake (John Stamos), a New York City publicist-to-the-stars who tries to change his womanizing ways as he tries to find the woman of his dreams. Stamos' co-stars in the show are Naomi (Wendie Malick), Jake's boss at the Magnum PR Agency; Adrian (Ian Gomez), Jake's best friend; and Patrick (Rick Hoffman), the performance artist who always appears at the most inopportune times.
