Tilo Gutzeit (born 12 January 1938) is a German figure skater who represented West Germany in competition. He is the 1955 German national champion. He represented the Unified Team of Germany at the 1956 Winter Olympics, where he placed 10th, and at the 1960 Winter Olympics, where he placed 9th. He represented the club  Düsseldorfer EG in national level competition.
Originally the results of the 1955 German Championships were misscalculated. Due to this Tilo Gutzeit received only the silver medal there and 12 year old Manfred Schnelldorfer was announced as German Champion. Several months after these championships, Werner Rittberger, who was a judge at these championships, recalculated the results. The results were corrected and the medals were physically exchanged. 
Tilo Gutzeit was also a potential skating partner for pair skater Marika Kilius. She had to split from Franz Ningel due to her height. However, Marika Kilius decided for Hans-Jürgen Bäumler.
