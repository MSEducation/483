An indirect presidential election was held in Hungary on 6-7 June 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/valaszt0606/ |title=Szili - Sólyom 183 : 13 |publisher=Index.hu |date=2005-06-06 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] The main opposition party Fidesz's nominee, the former President of the Constitutional Court László Sólyom was elected President of Hungary.

==Background==

Sólyom was nominated by the environmentalist civil organisation Védegylet, including notable public figures from both the left and the right wing. As the Constitution of Hungary specifies, the President is elected by the Parliament of Hungary, so he had to acquire the support of Parliamentary parties. The opposition parties, Fidesz and Hungarian Democratic Forum, also endorsed him to become President of Hungary. However, if the governing parties had been united in support of the Hungarian Socialist Party candidate, Katalin Szili, Sólyom would not have secured enough votes to take the Presidency. However, Szili was not acceptable to the Alliance of Free Democrats, the smaller party in the governing coalition; they abstained from voting, and Sólyom's election was secured.
