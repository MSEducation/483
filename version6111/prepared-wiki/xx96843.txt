Zoran Krušvar is a Croatian psychologist and science fiction and fantasy writer, born on April 9, 1977, in Rijeka.  He won 4 SFERA awards, in 2002 (for Igra), in  2003 (for Brodovi u tami), in 2007 (for Izvršitelji nauma Gospodnjeg) and in 2008 (for Tako biti mora) from the Zagreb-based science fiction society SFera.
Krušvar's first novel, Izvršitelji nauma Gospodnjeg, was a multimedia project, first of such kind in Croatia. DVD distributed with the book contains music video soundtrack to the novel, and the trailer for the book was released on YouTube a month before its publishing.  At the presentation of the novel on April 22, 2007, a group of young people acted a ritual sacrifice of a young maiden, in order to propitate God, so the novel would sell better.
