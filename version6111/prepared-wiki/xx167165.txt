Ahmed Nemeur was not eligible to play the match and the federation gave the cup to Marseille. However, Colonel Joseph Pascot (member of the Commissariat général à l'Éducation générale et sportive) decided that the final had to be played on the field to know the real winner, that is why the final was replayed.
