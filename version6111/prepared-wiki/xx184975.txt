Hampstead Norris railway station was a station on the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway in England. It served the village of Hampstead Norreys in Berkshire (note spelling differentiation). The station closed in 1962.

==Facilities==

The station was originally built with only a small ticket office and a single platform serving both northbound and southbound trains. However, due to demand the station was eventually expanded to include a passing loop and an additional platform. A small siding and goods shed were used mainly for agricultural goods. 

==The site today==

The station area has been comprehensively redeveloped and almost the only evidence it was ever in the village is a road called "Station Hill".[tpl]cite book |last1=Karau |first1=P. |last2=Parsons |first2=M. |last3=Robertson |first3=K. |year=1984 |title=An illustrated history of the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway |publisher=Wild Swan Publications |ISBN=0-906867-04-5[/tpl] The rail bridge on entering the village from Hermitage still stands with the stump of a loading crane under the bridge preserved. Another large rail bridge just to the north of the village still stands in good condition.
