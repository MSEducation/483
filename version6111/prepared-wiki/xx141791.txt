The fake Shanee lands in the thick of it upon his arrival because when he refuses to marry her as everyone expected, she blackmails him and forces him to change his mind. Anyway all appears hunky dory and Shanee even turns his nose up at going home defying orders from his plant claiming that he has fallen for the ways of the humans! Then one fine day things turn nasty when evil goon Shamsher Khan, king of flesh trade discovers that the thorn he though he had extracted once and for all has resurfaced to threaten him once again.
