==Sambuvaraya fort==

The vassal had constructed the hill fort to watch and control the movements of the northern enemies. The fort has four gates in four directions. The northern gate was now called as Santhagate. The other gates were damaged. While the eastern gate was in a dilapidated condition, the western gate on which was found the inscription has been completely damaged. This gate was named after Puvandai alias Cholakon. He was one of the Mudalis in the military service of Ethirilichola Sambuvarayar. One hero stone has been erected on the plains, north of the Santhagate.
The fort was constructed with granite with a perimeter extending to two km. This fort once had residences and `pandals' for warriors who were posted for duties. Holes had been made on the rock surface in such a way as to erect round tents. One could see nine tent areas on the top of the hill. Besides, four water tanks had been created to provide drinking water. Two natural water ponds were also available in the fort.
Near the big tank a mortar with one foot depth and one foot diameter was dug and used.
The area also revealed clear traces of a Siva and Pillaiyar temples. Stone blocks, bricks each measuring 10 inches x 7 inches, lime mortar and sand were used in the construction of the fort walls.
