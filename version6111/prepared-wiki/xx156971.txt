==Biography==

Schinzel received MSc in 1958 at Warsaw University, Ph.D in 1960 from Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences where he studied under Wacław Sierpiński,[tpl]MathGenealogy|id=52979[/tpl] habilitation in 1960. Member of the Polish Academy of Sciences.http://nauka-polska.pl/dhtml/raporty/ludzieNauki?rtype=opis&objectId=47310&lang=pl
He is a professor at the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IM PAN).
His principal interest is the theory of polynomials. A conjecture of his on the prime values of polynomials, known as Schinzel's hypothesis H, has attracted the attention of many number theorists.
Schinzel is the author of over 200 research articles in various branches of number theory, including elementary, analytic and algebraic number theory. He has also been the editor of Acta Arithmetica for over four decades.
