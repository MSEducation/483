[[Applied probability]]

CATEGORIES: Applied probability

Much research involving probability is done under the auspices of applied probability, the application of probability theory to other scientific and engineering domains.  However, while such research is motivated (to some degree) by applied problems, it is usually the mathematical aspects of the problems that are of most interest to researchers (as is typical of applied mathematics in general).
Applied probabilists are particularly concerned with the application of stochastic processes, and probability more generally, to the natural, applied and social sciences, including biology, physics (including astronomy), chemistry, computer science and information technology, and economics. 
Another area of interest is in engineering: particularly in areas of uncertainty, risk management, Probabilistic design, and Quality assurance.
