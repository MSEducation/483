A widespread famine affected the inhabitants of today's Eritrea and Ethiopia from 1983 to 1985.[tpl]sfn|de Waal|1991|p=2[/tpl] The worst famine to hit the country in a century,Gebru 2009, p. 20. in northern Ethiopia it led to more than 400,000 deaths,[tpl]sfn|de Waal|1991|p=5[/tpl] but more than half this mortality can be attributed to human rights abuses that caused the famine to come earlier, strike harder, and extend further than would otherwise have been the case.[tpl]sfn|de Waal|1991|p=5[/tpl] Other areas of Ethiopia experienced famine for similar reasons, resulting in tens of thousands of additional deaths.[tpl]sfn|de Waal|1991|p=5[/tpl] The tragedy as a whole took place within the context of more than two decades of insurgency and civil war.[tpl]sfn|de Waal|1991|p=1[/tpl]
The great famine of 1983–5 is often ascribed to drought, and while climatic causes and consequences certainly played a part in the tragedy, it has been shown that widespread drought occurred only some months after the famine was under way.[tpl]sfn|de Waal|1991|p=4[/tpl] The famines that struck Ethiopia between 1961 and 1985, and in particular the one of 1983–5, were in large part created by government policies, specifically the set of counter-insurgency strategies employed and so-called 'social transformation' in non-insurgent areas.[tpl]sfn|de Waal|1991|p=4–6[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Young|2006|p=132[/tpl]
