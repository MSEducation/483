==History==

Human settlement began in Dacian times.[tpl]ro icon[/tpl] "Short history" at the Ileanda Town Hall site; accessed October 25, 2013
In the 1830s, Jews began to arrive in Ileanda, and by the end of the century, the community ran nearly all commerce and small industry in the village and its surroundings. In the interwar period, there was a yeshiva with 30 to 40 students, while Zionist activity started in the 1920s. In 1930, there were 308 Jews or 26% of the population. In June 1942, 11 Jews were drafted into labor battalions in Reichskommissariat Ukraine, of whom two survived. In May 1944, 900 Jews were sent by the authorities of the Kingdom of Hungary to the Dej ghetto and then to the Auschwitz concentration camp. József Paneth, who became the local rabbi in 1926, escaped deportation to Romania with his family.[tpl]ro icon[/tpl] "Ghettoes" at the Northern Transylvania Holocaust Memorial Museum site; accessed October 25, 2013 Following World War II, he served the surviving Jews until the community dispersed in 1950.Shmuel Spector, Geoffrey Wigoder (eds.), "Ileanda" in The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust: A-J, p.544-545.
