</ref> [[Political dissident]]s were force-fed large quantities of castor oil by Fascist squads. This technique was said to have been originated by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]]. Victims of this treatment did sometimes die, as the dehydrating effects of the oil-induced diarrhea often complicated the recovery from the nightstick beating they also received along with the castor oil; however, even those victims who survived had to bear the humiliation of the laxative effects resulting from excessive consumption of the oil.<ref>[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a4_028.html The Straight Dope: Did Mussolini use castor oil as an instrument of torture?]</ref>
It is said Mussolini's power was backed by "the bludgeon and castor oil".  In lesser quantities, castor oil was also used as an instrument of intimidation, for example, to discourage civilians or soldiers who would call in sick either in the factory or in the military.  Since its healing properties were widely exaggerated, abuse could be easily masked under pretense of a doctor's prescription. [tpl]clarify|date=July 2013[/tpl] It took decades after Mussolini's death before the myth of castor oil as a panacea for a wide range of diseases and medical conditions was totally demystified, as it was also widely administered to pregnant women, elderly or mentally-ill patients in hospitals in the false belief it had no negative side effects.
It was also often used as both a punishment and torture by the Spanish Nationalists, led by Francisco Franco, as they purged Spain of those who supported the democratic, left-wing Republic during the Spanish Civil War.Paul Preston, The Spanish Holocaust.

====Linguistic connotations====

Today, the Italian terms manganello and olio di ricino, even used separately, still carry strong political connotations (especially the latter).  These words are still used to satirize patronizing politicians, or the authors of disliked legislation.  They should be used with caution in common conversation. The terms Usare l'olio di ricino, ("to use castor oil") and usare il manganello ("to use the bludgeon") mean "to coerce or abuse", and can be misunderstood in the absence of proper context.
As a means of punishment or torture, force-feeding castor oil still lives on in animated cartoons such as Tom and Jerry.
