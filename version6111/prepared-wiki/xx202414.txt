==History==

In 1817, a sixteen-year-old boy named Ethan Alling arrived in Township Five in the tenth range of the Connecticut Land Company, also known as Millsville. Alling was to survey the [tpl]convert|400|acre|km2[/tpl] his Connecticut family had purchased. He is considered the first settler of the town that would be renamed Twinsburg, and eventually he became the postmaster, stagecoach operator, merchant and hotel proprietor of the community.
A pair of identical twins named Moses and Aaron Wilcox from Killingworth, Connecticut, purchased some [tpl]convert|4000|acre|km2|0[/tpl] of land in 1819 and began selling small parcels at low prices to attract other settlers. The Wilcox twins offered [tpl]convert|6|acre|m2[/tpl] of land for a public square and $20.00 toward starting the first school if the residents would change the settlement's name from Millsville to Twinsburg. Moses and Aaron Wilcox were reportedly so identical only their closest friends could tell them apart. They were lifelong business partners, held all their property in common, married sisters, had the same number of children, contracted the same fatal ailment and died within hours of each other. They are buried in the same grave in Twinsburg’s Locust Grove Cemetery.About Twinsburg | The City of Twinsburg
