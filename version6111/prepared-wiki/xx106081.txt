The Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) is a non-departmental public body of the Department of Health in the United Kingdom.Department of Health - Categorisation of arm's length bodies - Central services to the NHS

The organisation was created as a special health authority on 1 April 2005 by a merger of parts of the Department of Health, parts of the NHS Information Authority, and the Prescribing Support Unit.
Following the Health and Social Care Act 2012, the HSCIC changed from a special health authority to a Executive Non-Departmental 
Public Body (ENDPB) on 1 April 2013. Effective at this time, HSCIC will take over the NHS Connecting for Health (CfH) program.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/229062/0332.pdf|title=The Health and Social Care  Information Centre Annual Report and Accounts 2011/12|accessdate=19 Apr 2014[/tpl]
It now runs the Health and Social Care Survey and oversees parts of the troubled NHS National Programme for IT (NPfIT), whose component projects are now under new names.

A programme called care.data was announced by the HSCIC in Spring 2013. Its aim is to extract data from GP surgeries (GPES) to a central database. Members of the English population who are registered with GP practices are being informed that data on their health may be uploaded to HSCIC unless they prefer this not to happen in which case they may object to their data being used by informing their GP. The data on patients who have not objected may then be used in anonymised form by health care researchers, managers and planners including those outside the NHS such as academic institutions or commercial organisations. The use of identifiable data is governed by the common law on confidentiality, UK Data Protection Legislation, the 2006 NHS Act and the 2012 Health and Social Care Act. Identifiable data can only be released in compliance with those laws.

Since its launch, the care.data program has proved controversial.[tpl]cite web|title=The Independent - 40 per cent of GPs plan to opt out of the NHS big data sweep, due to a lack of confidence in the project|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/40-per-cent-of-gps-plan-to-opt-out-of-the-nhs-big-data-sweep-due-to-a-lack-of-confidence-in-the-project-9083806.html?origin=internalSearch|accessdate=27 February 2014[/tpl]
Initially criticism focused around the lack of patient awareness of the programme, and the lack of clarity around options for opting out of the data extraction. The leaflet sent to households in England was criticised for only describing the benefits of the scheme, and not including an opt-out form.[tpl]cite web|title=MedConfidential - "Better information means better care" leaflet|url=http://medconfidential.org/2014/better-information-means-better-care-leaflet/|accessdate=27 February 2014[/tpl]
