Calligra Words is a word processor, which is part of Calligra Suite and developed by KDE as free software.

==History==

When Calligra Suite was formed, unlike the other Calligra applications Words was not a continuation of the corresponding KOffice application – KWord.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.kde.org/node/4538 |title=Calligra Words is not a fork of KWord |publisher=blogs.kde.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13[/tpl] The functionality of Words has largely been written from scratch – in May 2011 a completely new layout engine was announced.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.kde.org/node/4433 |title=How to make a new layout engine for Calligra Words in 4 months |publisher=blogs.kde.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13[/tpl] The first release was made available on [tpl]Start date|2012|04|11[/tpl], using the version number 2.4 to match the rest of Calligra Suite.

==Reception==

Initial reception of Calligra Words shortly after the 2.4 release was mixed. While Linux Pro Magazine Online’s Bruce Byfield wrote “Calligra needed an impressive first release. Perhaps surprisingly, and to the development team’s credit, it has managed one in 2.4.”, he also noted that “Words in particular is still lacking features”. He concluded that Calligra is “worth keeping an eye on”.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linuxpromagazine.com/Online/Features/Calligra-The-Other-Office-Suite-Narrows-the-Gap |title=Calligra: The Other Office Suite Narrows the Gap |publisher=Linux Pro Magazine Online |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01[/tpl]
On the other hand, Calligra Words became the default word processor in Kubuntu 12.04 – replacing LibreOffice Writer.[tpl]cite web|date=2012-04-29 |url=http://it-diary.com/linux/calligra-suite-office-graphics-applications/ |title=Calligra Suite: Better Office & Graphics Applications |publisher=IT Diary |date=2012-04-29 |accessdate=2012-06-13[/tpl]
