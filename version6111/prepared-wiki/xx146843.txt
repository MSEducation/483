Salwa Judum (meaning "Peace March" or "Purification Hunt"  in Gondi language) was a right-wing to far-right civilian militia mobilised and deployed as part of anti-insurgency operations in Chhattisgarh, India, aimed at countering Naxalite violence in the region. The militia consisting of local tribal youth received support and training from the Chhattisgarh state government."Salwa Judum – menace or messiah?" TOI, Mar 20, 2010"Left in the lurch" Indian Express, July 10, 2011
On 5 July 2011, the Supreme Court of India declared the militia to be illegal and unconstitutional, and ordered its disbanding. The Court directed the Chhattisgarh government to recover all the firearms, ammunition and accessories. The use of Salwa Judum by the government for anti naxal operations was criticised for its violations of human rights, use of child soldiers and poorly trained uneducated youth for counter-insurgency roles. It also ordered the government to investigate all instances of alleged criminal activities of Salwa Judum."Salwa Judum is illegal, says SC" The Hindu July 5, 2011

==Origins==

Salwa Judum started in 2006 as a people's resistance movement against the Naxalites, a far-left movement with Maoist ideology in some states in rural India that is designated by India as a terrorist organisation on account of their violent activities.http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060627/asp/opinion/story_6402011.asp Ramachandra Guha. Initially an uprising of local indigenous people in Chhattisgarh, the movement later received bi-partisan support from both the ruling and opposition parties.http://www.dailypioneer.com/206533/Mao%E2%80%99s-horsemen-of-the-apocalypse.html Kanchan Gupta. A few years later the state government adopted the Salwa Judum movement to counter Naxalites in regions where they had established themselves by force.http://www.dailypioneer.com/208205/Mao%E2%80%99s-Malefactors.html Pioneer
In 2008, Chhattisgarh along with neighbouring Jharkhand accounted for over 65% of the total Naxal violence in the country. Chhattisgarh state had trained a number of 'Special Police Officers' or SPOs (also commonly referred to as Koya commandos), from amongst the tribals who were part of Salwa Judum.Centre gives its tacit approval to Salwa Judum Times of India, 8 January 2009.CoBRA reaches Bastar to join anti-Naxal ops Indian Express, 5 February 2009.

==History==

Bastar and Dantewada districts of Chhattisgarh have traditionally been sparsely populated and rich in natural resources but also with some of the poorest tribal regions. The (Naxalites) progressively increased their influence and control among local tribals through a combination of political mobilisation (around poor governance, land rights, livelihood and social inequity) and force.http://planningcommission.gov.in/reports/publications/rep_dce.pdf
The first movement against the Naxalites was the 'Jan Jagran Abhiyan', started in 1991 by Mahendra Karma, a local tribal leader. This was mostly led by local traders and businessmen.http://www.pucl.org/Topics/Human-rights/2006/salwa_judum.pdf This collapsed, and the leaders had to seek police protection. However, the second time around, the state had signed the mining agreements with the Tata and Essar groups, and was eager to flush the region of the Naxalites in order let the mining companies smoothly operate there. This was the beginning of police and military support to the movement. Mahendra Karma, a Congress Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and the leader of opposition in the State Legislative Assembly became the public front and took the Bijapur-based movement to Dantewada, Katreli and other parts of the region.Inside India's hidden war The Guardian, 9 May 2006.'Salwa Judum can't work in the long run' Chhattisgarh Director General of Police Vishwa Ranjan.

==Development of Special Police Officers (SPOs)==

The Chhattisgarh state Police employs tribal youths as SPOs (Special Police Officers), which are essentially 4,000 youth, both ex-Naxalites and those drawn from Salwa Judum camps in the Bastar region, who are paid an honorarium of Rs 1,500 (Rs 3000 in 2011)per month by the state government, were trained by with mostly .303 rifles. In Feb 2009, the Supreme Court in India declared such arming of civilians illegal.
In 2008, there were 23 Salwa Judum camps in Bijapur and Dantewara districts of Bastar region where almost 50,000 tribals from over 600 villages had settled. The government has now discredited the Salwa Judum movement.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] Union Minister of Home Affairs, P.

On 5 July 2011, the Supreme Court of India ordered the Indian state of Chhattisgarh to disband a militia force founded to combat Maoist guerrillas who control large areas of the country. As reported in The Hindu, the Supreme Court directed the Chhattisgarh police to "immediately cease and desist from using SPOs in any manner or form in any activities, directly or indirectly, aimed at controlling, countering, mitigating or otherwise eliminating Maoist/Naxalite activities" and directed the police to recall all firearms issued to these men.
On 6 July 2011 supreme court declared sulwa judum as illegal.

==Controversy==

===Child Soldiers===

There have been numerous reports that the Salwa Judum had recruited minors for its armed forces. A primary survey evaluated by the Forum for Fact-finding Documentation and Advocacy (FFDA) determined that over 12,000 minors were being used by the Salwa Judum in the southern district of Dantewada and that the Chhattisgarh Government had "officially recruited 4200 Special Police Officers (SPOs); many of them being easily identifiable as minors".[tpl]Cite web|last1=Zemp|first1=Ueli|last2=Mohapatra|first2=Subash|url=http://www.otherindia.org/dev/images/stories/feda_child.pdf|title=Child Soldiers in Chhattisgarh: Issues, Challenges and FFDA's Response|date=29 July 2007|accessdate=31 May 2009[/tpl] The Asian Centre for Human Rights (ACHR) also found that the Salwa Judum had engaged in the recruitment of child soldiers.[tpl]Cite book|last=|first=|title=The Adivasis of Chhattisgarh: Victims of the Naxalite Movement and Salwa Judum Campaign|url=http://www.achrweb.org/reports/india/Chattis0106.pdf|publisher=Asian Centre for Human Rights|year=2006|location=New Delhi|accessdate=31 May 2009|isbn=81-88987-14-X|page=42[/tpl] Similar recruitment findings were also reported in the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers's "Child Soldiers Global Report 2008 – India".[tpl]Cite web|last=|first=|title=Child Soldiers Global Report 2008 – India|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,469f2dcf2,486cb108c,0.html|date=20 May 2008|accessdate=31 May 2009|publisher=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers[/tpl]

===Human rights violation===

Some human rights organisations such as the People's Union for Civil Liberties has raised allegations against Salwa Judum.[tpl]Cite web| title = Findings about the Salwa Judum in Dantewara district | url =  http://www.pucl.org/Topics/Human-rights/2005/salwa-judum-report.htm | date = 12 February 2005[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| title = Salwa Judum report | publisher = South Asia Intelligence Review of the South Asia Terrorism Portal | url = http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/sair/archives/4_33.htm[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| title = Salwa Judum report | publisher = Asian Council For Human Rights | url = http://www.achrweb.org/Review/2006/117-06.htm[/tpl] A fact finding commission of National Human Rights Commission of India (NHRC), appointed by Supreme Court of India reported that Salwa Judum was a "spontaneous reaction by the tribals to defend themselves against the "reign of terror unleashed by the Naxalites." The report was submitted to honourable Supreme Court of India which, on the contrary, declared Salwa Judum to be illegal and unconstitutional, and ordered its disbanding. This clearly raises doubts against the neutrality of the NHRC commission whose report stood in strong support of Salwa Judum.

===State sponsoring of militia===

In April 2008, a Supreme Court bench directed the state Government to refrain from allegedly supporting and encouraging the Salwa Judum: "It is a question of law and order. You cannot give arms to somebody (a civilian) and allow him to kill. You will be an abettor of the offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code."; the state government had earlier denied, Salwa Judum being a state-sponsored movement,Hearing plea against Salwa Judum, SC says State cannot arm civilians to kill Indian Express, 1 April 2008.SC raps Chhattisgarh on Salwa Judum Rediff.com, 31 March 2008. later it directed the state government to take up the remedial measures suggested in the NHRC earlier reportImplement NHRC recommendations on Salwa Judum, Supreme Court asks Chhattisgarh government The Hindu, 20 September 2008.

In December 2008, replying to a petition filed in the Supreme Court, the state government acknowledged that Salwa Judum and security forces had burnt houses and looted property but the allegations against Salwa Judum of killings were not found to be true by National Human Rights Commission.[tpl]cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/PoliticsNation/Existence_of_Salwa_Judum_necessary/articleshow/3565263.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Politics/Nation | date=6 October 2008[/tpl]Salwa Judum victims assured of relief The Hindu, 16 December 2008.

==Effects==

Encouraged by the highly positive results of the movement in the region, the government is planning to launch a people's movement in insurgency hit state of Manipur on similar lines. In 2006, Karnataka raised a similar force employing tribals youths to fight Naxalism in the state, as did Andhra Pradesh prior to itTribal youths will now fight Naxals The Times of India, 11 May 2006. Jharkhand is another state that has been successfully using SPOs to counter Leftwing terrorists.
However, the Salwa Judum appears to have been abandoned in Chhattisgarh state, with Chief Minister Raman Singh describing the movement as "over", because it was counterproductive and "innocent people were being killed"CM: Salwa Judum is over Hindustan Times, 7 February 2011. Singh, however, said that a "peaceful campaign" to wean locals away from supporting Maoists would continue.

==Darbha Ghat Massacre==
