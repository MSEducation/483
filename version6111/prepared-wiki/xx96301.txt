[[Annualized failure rate]]

CATEGORIES: Failure

Annualized failure rate (AFR) gives the estimated probability that a device or component will fail during a full year of use. It is a relation between the mean time between failure (MTBF) and the hours that a number of devices are run per year.  AFR is estimated from a sample of like components—AFR and MTBF as given by vendors are population statistics that can not predict the behaviour of an individual unit.[tpl]cite web|url= http://enterprise.media.seagate.com/2010/04/inside-it-storage/diving-into-mtbf-and-afr-storage-reliability-specs-explained/|title= Diving into "MTBF" and "AFR": Storage Reliability Specs Explained | work = Inside IT Storage | publisher = Seagate |date=Apr 2010[/tpl]

==Hard drives==

For example, AFR is used to characterize the reliability of hard disk drives.
The relationship between AFR and MTBF is:
This equation assumes that the drives are powered on for the full 8760 hours of a year, and gives the estimated fraction of an original sample of drives that will suffer from disk failures, or, equivalently, 1 − AFR is the fraction of drives that will show no failures over a year. It is based on an exponential failure distribution (see Failure rate for a full derivation).
This can be approximated by, assuming a small AFR,
For example, a common specification for PATA and SATA drives may be 300,000 MTBF, giving a theoretical 2.88% annualized failure rate i.e. a 2.88% chance that a given drive will fail during a year of use.
The AFR for a drive is derived from time-to-fail data from a reliability-demonstration test (RDT).[tpl]Citation | first = Gerry | last = Cole | format = PDF | url = http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~jck/cs686/papers/cole.pdf | title = Estimating Drive Reliability in Desktop Computers and Consumer Electronics Systems | publisher = Virginia[/tpl].
AFR will increase towards and beyond the end of the service life of a device or component.  Google's 2007 study found, based on a large field sample of drives, that actual AFRs for individual drives ranged from 1.7% for first year drives to over 8.6% for three-year old drives.[tpl]Citation | publisher = Google | contribution = AFR broken down by age groups | url = http://research.google.com/archive/disk_failures.pdf | title = Failure Trends in Large Disk Drive Population | at = p. 4, figure 2ff[/tpl]. A CMU 2007 study showed an estimated 3% mean AFR over 1–5 years based on replacement logs for a large sample of drives.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.usenix.org/events/fast07/tech/schroeder.html | title = Disk Failures in the Real World: What Does an MTTF of 1,000,000 Hours Mean to You? | first1 = Bianca | last1 = Schroeder | first2 = Garth A | last2 = Gibson | author2-link = Garth A.
