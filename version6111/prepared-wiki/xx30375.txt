[[Academy Award for Best Film Editing]]

CATEGORIES: Academy Awards, Film editing awards

The Academy Award for Film Editing is one of the annual awards of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  Nominations for this award are closely correlated with the Academy Award for Best Picture. Since 1981, every film selected as Best Picture has also been nominated for the Film Editing Oscar, and about two thirds of the Best Picture winners have also won for Film Editing.[tpl]cite news |last=Harris |first=Mark |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/movies/awardsseason/06harr.html |title=Which Editing is a Cut Above? |work=The New York Times |date=January 6, 2008[/tpl] In 1980, Ordinary People won as Best Picture, but its editor Jeff Kanew was not nominated for Best Editing.[tpl]cite news |last=Dimond |first=Anna |title=Why Editing Nominations Predict the Best Picture Oscar |work=Variety |date=December 13, 2013 |url=http://variety.com/2013/film/awards/oscars-why-editing-predicts-the-best-picture-1200945193/[/tpl] Interviews with prominent film editors exploring the correlation between the Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and for Best Film. Only the principal, "above the line" editor(s) as listed in the film's credits are named on the award; additional editors, supervising editors, etc. are not generally eligible. The nominations for this Academy Award are determined by a ballot of the members of the Editing Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences; there were 233 members of the Editing Branch in 2008. The members may vote for up to five of the eligible films in the order of their preference; the five films with the largest vote totals are selected as nominees.[tpl]cite web |url=http://old.oscars.org/79academyawards/rules/rule13.html |title=Rule Thirteenâ€”Special Rules for the Film Editing Award |work=79th Academy Awards Rules for Distinguished Achievements in 2006 |archivedate=2010-07-18 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rJRCScnc [/tpl] Rules are published for each year's awards. In earlier years, different rules applied; thus Robert Parrish was nominated for All the King's Men (1949) with a credit as an "editorial consultant". The Academy Award itself is selected from the nominated films by a subsequent ballot of all active and life members of the Academy. This process is essentially the reverse of that of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA); nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Editing are done by a general ballot of Academy voters, and the winner is selected by members of the editing chapter.[tpl]cite web |title=Orange British Academy Film Awards: Rules and Guidelines 2008-2009 |url=http://static.bafta.org/files/rule-book-bafta-film-awards-0809-23.pdf |publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rJRlHgT9 |archivedate=2010-07-18[/tpl]
