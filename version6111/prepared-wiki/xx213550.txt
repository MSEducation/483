Kfar Maimon ([tpl]lang-he-n|כְּפַר מַיְמוֹן[/tpl], lit. Maimon Village) is a religious moshav in southern Israel. Located near Netivot and covering 5,000 dunams, it falls under the jurisdiction of Sdot Negev Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 284.
The village was established in 1959 by a gar'in of Bnei Akiva members and was named after Yehuda Leib Maimon, a signatory of the Israeli declaration of independence and the first Minister of Religions.
The village became the site of a non-violent standoff between tens of thousands of Jewish Israeli protesters against Israel's unilateral disengagement plan and Israeli police who encircled the protesters who had started in Netivot from continuing their march to Gaza Jewish settlements.[tpl]cite news|last=Price |first=Matthew |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4697507.stm |title=Middle East | Battle of wills over Gaza pull-out |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-07-19 |accessdate=2011-02-25[/tpl]  The mass influx of demonstrators overloaded mobile telephone and other services in the small agricultural village.
The village is also known for its French High School & campus "Lycée Français Thorani de Kfar Maimon" (French High School of Kfar Maimon). The Moshav Rabbi is Eliezer Igra.
