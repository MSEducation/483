Dingbats is the name of a board game that was devised by Paul Sellers and is currently manufactured by Ravensburger. The game, for two or more people, involves solving rebuses (puzzles in which a common word or saying is hidden in a cryptic or otherwise unique arrangement of symbols).
There is a time limit to solve each puzzle, and success means you can move further along the board. The winner is the person to reach the end square first. The name Dingbats is a registered trademark.http://www.ipo.gov.uk/domestic?domesticnum=1290344
The name may relate to the style in which the rebuses were printed, involving prolific use of dingbats.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl]
