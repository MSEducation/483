"Mean Girl" is a single released by the British Rock band Status Quo in 1973. It was taken from the 1971 album Dog of Two Head.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.statusquo.co.uk/records/singles2.htm |title=Status Quo discography |publisher=statusquo.co.uk |accessdate=2010-01-04[/tpl]
Pye released the old song after the success of the single "Paper Plane" on the Vertigo label. It became a UK Top 20 hit - previously only 3 of the 10 Pye singles had made the Top 20. They tried this again with the single "Gerdundula", another track from the same album, but this failed to chart.
