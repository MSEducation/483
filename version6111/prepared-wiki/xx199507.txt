CATEGORIES: Art Pepper albums, 1976 albums

The Trip is a 1976 jazz album by saxophonist Art Pepper playing with George Cables, David Williams and Elvin Jones.
This album features The Trip, one of Art Pepper's own melodies written in 1963 while in San Quentin. Pepper likened jazz to the storytelling that took place between the prisoners. As he says in the sleeve notes, "When I play,... the sound that comes out of this thing, this piece of metal is just me saying these things and taking people on a trip."
