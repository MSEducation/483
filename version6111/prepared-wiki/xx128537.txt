"Sounds of Then (This is Australia)" is a 1985 song by Australian band Gang Gajang from their self-titled debut album, Gang Gajang.  "Sounds of Then" was written by frontman Mark "Cal" Callaghan.[tpl]cite web |title=Australasian Performing Right Association |url=http://www.apra.com.au/site/public/searchworksresult.stm?worktitle=SOUNDS%20OF%20THEN&switchdet=Y |publisher=APRA |accessdate=2007-10-09 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Whilst the 1985 release of "Sounds of Then" was not an initial commercial success, it has become the band's most popular and recognisable song and reached its peak when it was used as Nine Network's station ID promotion in 1996. The B-Side, "House of Cards", was recorded live for 2JJJ.
In an interview for APRA Mark Callaghan states that the song started as a poem in his notebook, reflecting on the time that his family moved from England to Bundaberg in Queensland, a major culture shock for him.  “We lived half way between Bundaberg and the ocean, all around was bush scrub and cane fields. And walking up to the top of the street to catch the school bus, one morning you turn around and there’s fire. It’s one of those songs where if your goal was only to sell records, whatever it took to do it, then the song would have been called ‘This is Australia’. But it’s not about that. It’s a brick veneer drama. My parents got divorced when they came to Australia, it was a horrible period of my life. And the song is actually about how smells and sounds and sensations can rekindle a memory – which is what music does so successfully for people: I think I hear the sounds of then and people talking / Scenes recalled by minute movement / And songs they fall from the backing tape…Mark Calaghan interview with Debbie Kruger 
The song has also been used in a commercial by Coca Cola and featured in the 1987 film North Shore.North Shore - film creditsInternet Movie database - North Shore soundtrack
