[[Higher education in the Philippines]]

CATEGORIES: Higher education in the Philippines

Colleges and universities in the Philippines are generically called Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) by the Philippine Commission on Higher Education (CHED).

==Classification==

Most tertiary institutions, generically called higher education institutions by the Commission on Higher Education of the Philippines (CHED) are licensed, controlled, and supervised by CHED. Records from CHED showed that the country had 1,573 private institutions and 607 state-run colleges and universities, a total of 2,080 HEIs as of August 2010."Information on Higher Education System" Commission on Higher Education. Accessed October 3, 2011.
Higher education institutions in the Philippines are either colleges or universities, and are generally classified as public or private.
Colleges are tertiary institutions that typically offer one or a few specialized courses, for example, in the sciences or in liberal arts, or in specific professional courses, such as Nursing, Computing, or Maritime Studies.
To be classified as universities, state universities and colleges (SUCs), CHED-supervised higher education institutions (CHEIs), private higher education institutions (PHEIs), and community colleges (CCs), must operate at least eight different degree programs. They must offer at least six undergraduate courses including a four-year course in liberal arts, a four-year course in Basic Science Mathematics, a four-year course in the Social Sciences, a minimum of three other active and recognized professional courses leading to government licensures, and at least two graduate-level courses leading to doctoral degrees. A further seven areas of requirements as universities are mandated by the Commission on Higher Education.CHED Memorandum Order 1996/48 S.2 Local government universities and colleges (LUCs) have less stringent requirements than private universities. They are required to operate at least five undergraduate programs (as opposed to eight for private universities), and two graduate-level programs.CHED Memorandum Order 2006/32 Art.VII S.10

===Public tertiary education===

Public universities are all non-sectarian entities, and are further classified as State University and College (SUC)  or Local College and University (LCU).http://www.ched.gov.ph/statistics/integration.of.ched.supervised.institutions.html SUCs are fully funded by the national government as determined by the Philippine Congress. The University of the Philippines, being the "national university",About UP, University of the Philippines System website.

The Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila is first and largest among the LCUs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2006/06/19/OPED2006061967216.html |title=Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila Pamantasan 41st Founding Anniversary |accessdate=2006-12-25 |author= | last= |first= |authorlink= | coauthors= |date=2006-06-19 |work= |publisher=Manila Bulletin |pages= |language= |archiveurl=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2006/06/19/OPED2006061967216.html |archivedate=2006-06-19 |quote =[/tpl]PLM ALCU.
LCUs appeared to be having some political difficulties. On 1 March 2011, the education committee of the Philippine Senate announced that it will push for a law regulating local colleges and universities (LCUs) all over the country.  The senate hearing received evidence from CHED that only a few of the courses offered in LCU institutions have permits from the national government.  Attorney Lily Milla of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) gave evidence to the hearing that out of 450 degree programs offered by the country's 93 LCUs, around 42 have permits to operate. Senate education committee chairman, Senator Edgardo Angara, told the same hearing that without a law regulating LCUs, "We will add to the number of diploma mills. We already have enough mills. Many of the poor send their kids to those schools and they're being shortchanged right now".Christopher Beresford Gain, Needs Analysis, Problem Assessment, and Resources Inventory: Towards the Establishment of a Community College p50, Trinity University of Asia, Quezon City, Philippines, March 2011, Doctor of Education dissertation.

===Private tertiary institutions===

Private colleges and universities may either be "sectarian" or "non-sectarian" entities. Institutions may either be "not-for-profit" or "profit-oriented". Most private schools are not-for-profit Catholic like Adamson University (Vincentian), the Ateneo de Manila University (Jesuit), De La Salle University (Christian Brothers), Don Bosco Technical College (Salesian), Notre Dame of Dadiangas University (Marist Brothers of the Schools), Saint Louis University, Baguio City (CICM), San Beda College (Benedictine), University of San Carlos, and the Divine Word College of Vigan (SVD), and the University of Santo Tomas and Colegio de San Juan de Letran (Dominican). However, there are also non-Catholic not-for-profit sectarian institutions such as Silliman University (Presbyterian), Adventist University of the Philippines (Seventh-day Adventists), Wesleyan University Philippines (Methodist), Central Philippine University (Baptist), Philippine Christian University (Methodist), Trinity University of Asia (Episcopalian), and New Era University (Iglesia ni Cristo). Non-sectarian private schools, on the other hand, are corporations licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Centro Escolar University, Far Eastern University, and STI College are registered on the Philippine Stock Exchange.

==Accreditation==

Accreditation is a process for assessing and upgrading the educational quality of higher education institutions and programs through self-evaluation and peer judgment.CHED Memorandum Order 1-2005 It is a system of evaluation based on the standards of an accrediting agency, and a means of assuring and improving the quality of education.[ref]"Journal of Philippine Higher Education Quality Assurance, Vol. 1, No. 1, January 2003". 
Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities of the Philippines, Inc. (AACCUP). Retrieved 2010-07-19.[/ref] The process leads to a grant of accredited status by an accrediting agency and provides public recognition and information on educational quality.

===Accreditation of Private institutions===

Voluntary accreditation of all higher education institutions is subject to the policies of the Commission on Higher Education. Voluntary accrediting agencies in the private sector are the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU), the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities' Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA), and the Association of Christian Schools, Colleges and Universities Accrediting Association Inc. (ACSCU-AAI) which all operate under the umbrella of the Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines (FAAP), which itself is the certifying agency authorized by CHED.A new era for higher education accreditation in RP. Accessed August 19, 2008.Palispis, E. (1999) Voluntary Accreditation in the Philippines: An Overview. Asian Social Institute, Manila. p10 Accreditation can be either of programs or of institutions.
All of the institutions accredited by these three agencies certified by FAAP are private institutions. Under CHED's Revised Policies and Guidelines on Voluntary Accreditation in Aid of Quality and Excellence and Higher Education, there are four levels of program accreditation, with Level IV being the highest.PAASCU website 
Two institutions, Ateneo de Manila University and De La Salle University-Manila were granted Level IV accreditation pursuant to the  provisions of CHED Order, CMO 31 of 1995, but their Level IV institutional accreditation lapsed. Ateneo was granted Level IV re-accreditation in 2011.http://ls.ateneo.edu/module.php?LM=articles.detail&eid=1306199966786
At present, nine universities have current institutional accreditation. Institutional accreditation is the highest certification that can be given to an educational institution after a consideration of the university's number of individual program accreditations and the result of an overall evaluation of the quality of its facilities, services and faculty. These schools are Adventist University of the Philippines, Ateneo de Manila University, Ateneo de Davao University, Ateneo de Naga University, Centro Escolar University, De La Salle University – Dasmariñas, Silliman University, Trinity University of Asia, and University of Santo Tomas."Silliman University granted institutional accreditation". Philippine Daily Inquirer. Retrieved 2011-03-31.
At present the Ateneo de Manila University, is the only university in the Philippines that has been simultaneously granted both Level IV Status and institutional accreditation. Silliman University on the other hand is recorded to have the highest number of accredited programs in the country, fourteen of which are on Level IV accreditation status while simultaneously bearing Institutional Accreditation by the Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines."14 Academic Programs Granted Highest Accreditation Status". Silliman University. Retrieved 2012-04-22."14 SU programs granted Level IV status". Visayan Daily Star. Retrieved 2012-04-29.

===Accreditation for Public Institutions===

Accrediting agencies for government-supported institutions are the Accrediting Association of Chartered Colleges and Universities of the Philippines (AACCUP), and the Association of Local Colleges and Universities Commission On Accreditation (ALCUCOA). Together they formed the National Network of Quality Assurance Agencies (NNQAA) as the certifying agency for government-sponsored institutions. However NNQAA does not certify all government-sponsored institutions.
The Technical Vocational Education Accrediting Agency of the Philippines (TVEAAP) was established and registered with the Securities Exchange Commission on 27 October 1987.  On 28 July 2003, the FAAP board accepted the application of TVEAAP to affiliate with FAAP.Nilo E Colinares, Philippine Education in the Third Millennium, 6Ns Enterprises, Manila, 2005, p283
AACCUP and PAASCUhttp://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/iaa/paascu2006primer.asp are active members of the International Network of Quality Assurance Agencies for Higher Education (INQAAHE), and the Asia Pacific Quality Network (APQN).

==Autonomy and Deregulation==

In an effort to rationalize its supervision of institutions of higher learning, CHED has also prescribed guidelines for granting privileges of autonomy and deregulation to certain schools. According to the guidelines, the general criteria examined by CHED are an institution's "long tradition of integrity and untarnished reputation", "commitment to excellence", and "sustainability and viability of operations".CHED Memorandum Order No. 52, Series of 2006. Last accessed 30 October 2008.

===Autonomous status===

Autonomous status allows universities to design their own curricula, offer new programs and put up branches or satellite campuses without having to secure permits, confer honorary degrees, and carry out operations without much interference from CHED.RP universities get low rankings; La Salle, UST dropped out of Top 500.

Recently University of Perpetual Help System Laguna and University of Perpetual Help-Dr. Jose G. Tammayo Medical University. Both in Biñan, Laguna received its Autonomous Status effective from July 25, 2012

===Deregulated status===

Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) with deregulated status enjoy the same privilege as autonomous HEIs, but they must still secure permits for new programs and campuses.
CHED regularly updates its list of autonomous institutions  with the latest published list valid to 6 October 2009. As at that date 15 deregulated HEIs were listed by CHED.

==Rankings and league tables==

===Local rankings===

There are no set methods for ranking institutions in the Philippines. Aside from comparisons in terms of accreditation, autonomy, and centers of excellence awarded by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), there are attempts to rank schools based on performance in board exams conducted by the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC). The  PRC and CHED sometimes publish reports on these results.
In 2009, CHED executive director Julito Vitriolo said that they are in the process of establishing appropriate guidelines to rank Philippine universities and colleges for each specific academic program or discipline.CHED to rank colleges and universities in RP.

===International rankings===

===Views of the THES-QS rankings===

Rankings such as the THES-QS have been received with mixed reactions. In 2006, Ang Pamantasan, the official student paper of Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, published the university's criticism on the rankings, saying that the THES-QS criteria do not apply to the unique landscape of each participating universities, and that such rankings say nothing or very little about whether students are actually learning at particular colleges or universities."PLM administration criticizes the THES-QS Survey". Ang Pamantasan, Vol. XXVII No. 2. September 01, 2006. On the same year, the University of the Philippines, through its University President Emerlinda Román, expressed that it does not want to participate in the THES-QS Ranking, but was included in 2007 with an incomplete academic profile.Leticia Peñano-Ho, Who Should Tell Us Who We Are?, University of the Philippines System website. Accessed May 6, 2007. That same year, Ateneo de Manila University President Fr. Bienvenido Nebres, S.J. commented on the rankings, pointing out that rankings such as these did not adequately reflect the university's progress or how well it has been working toward achieving its mission-vision.http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=120&type=2&aid=2989
In 2007, the Ateneo administration reiterated its position on several occasions,http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=120&type=2&aid=3272 even given an improvement in the 2007 rankings.http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=120&type=2&aid=4489
In 2008, the University of the Philippines questioned the validity of the 2008 THES-QS rankings, claiming that the methodology used was "problematic", and cited the International Ranking Systems for Universities and Institutions: A Critical Appraisal, which found out that the Times simply asks 190,000 ‘experts’ to list what they regard as the top 30 universities in their field of expertise without providing input data on any performance indicators, as one of the bases for rejecting the said survey. Furthermore, the UP said that THES-QS refused to divulge how and where the data were taken from,CHED hails rankings of 4 RP universities. Philippine Daily Inquirer. October 16, 2008. and instead, advised the university to advertise at the THES-QS website for US$ 48,930 publicity package.UP Questions Validity of the THES and QS university rankings. October 28, 2008. CHED Chairperson Emmanuel Angeles, on the other hand, commended all four Philippine universities that made it to the list. He also suggested that Philippine schools would get better in the future THES-QS rankings if they choose to advertise in the THES-QS publications and when budgetary allocations for faculty and researchers, particularly at UP, would become better in the coming years. The Ateneo administration, instead of directly commenting on the 2008 rankings, allowed the publication of an opinion-editorial article on its website, which basically reiterated the same position, even after further improvement.http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=120&type=2&aid=5951
In 2009, the University of Santo Tomas expressed that "it will be very difficult for a university to rank high in such surveys unless they enjoy big media mileage or they have extensive press releases to advertise themselves". Furthermore, UST lamented that, "it is quite puzzling that another university in the country ranked much higher than UST in the field of Life Sciences and Biomedicine when it hardly offers any course in the field like Pharmacy, Medical Technology, Nursing, Physical and Occupational Therapy". Despite repeated invitations to participate in conference sponsored by the THES-QS and to advertise the University in its websites and publications, UST strongly refused to do so.UST 144 in Asian Rankings says new survey. The Ateneo administration maintained its previous positions following the 2009 rankings, however actively participates in the survey.http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=120&type=2&aid=7542
In 2010, following publication of the 2010 QS Asian University Rankings, there were varied responses. The Ateneo administration maintained its previous positions, and together with some faculty members, expressed some satisfaction with the rankings, but committed to continue work on improving the university.http://www.theguidon.com/?p=4508 In the University of Santo Tomas, some administrators noted their performance vis-a-vis other schools in terms of academic peer review,http://www.varsitarian.net/news/20100618/ust_ranks_101st_in_asia while the editorial of their student paper noted that some things were amiss with the rankings, noting their university's performance in local board examinations and the marketing and advertising aspect of the rankings.http://www.varsitarian.net/editorial_opinion/editorial/20100618/some_things_amiss_with_top_200_list
