===Redress for internees===

Since 1990, the congress has sought compensation for Italian Canadians who were interned and arrested by the Canadian government during World War II."Italian Canadians plan to lobby for redress," Toronto Star, 6 January 1990, p. 16. At one stage in the mid-1990s, the congress voted to drop its request for compensation and focus on clearing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police records of surviving internees; in later years, however, it resumed its efforts for compensation."Italians drop bid for wartime compensation," Canadian Press, 28 November 1994; "Italian Canadians want apology for internment," Canadian Press, 4 March 1997. 
Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney apologized for the internment policy in November 1990 but did not provide financial compensation.Gene Allen, "Mulroney apologizes to Italian internees No financial deal pledged to victims," Globe and Mail, 5 November 1990, p. 1. In November 2005, the government of Paul Martin reached an agreement in principle with Italian community organizations, including the congress, to devote $25 million to public education and commemoration efforts."Martin makes amends for 'dark chapter in our history'," Toronto Star, 13 November 2005, p. 2. Four years later, the congress accused federal citizenship and immigration minister Jason Kenney of using "divide and conquer" tactics within the Italian community in overseeing these revenues."The National Congress of Italian Canadians Responds to Minister Kenney's Announcement Regarding the Community Historical Recognition Program: A Shameful Attempt to Divide and Conquer" release, Canada NewsWire, 23 March 2009.

===Political activism===

The congress has traditionally supported Canadian federalism. In November 1996, it joined with the Canadian Jewish Congress and the Hellenic Canadian Congress in issuing a pamphlet calling for renewed Canadian unity.Paul Wells, "Greek, Italian and Jewish groups launch plan for united Canada," Montreal Gazette, 27 November 1996, p. 11. It has also promoted the right of Italian citizens living in Canada to participate in Italian elections.Jeff Heinrich, "Italian groups set aside rivalries to promote election in homeland," Montreal Gazette, 29 April 2005, p. 6.
Several congress members have been active in Canadian political life, including Laureano Leone, Rosario Marchese, and Annamarie Castrilli.Hugh Winsor, "Faith in finding the ring," Globe and Mail, 30 December 1980, p. 7; "Ministers bring range of experience to cabinet," Ottawa Citizen, 2 October 1990, p. 5; "Italian Canadian group criticizes compensation plan," Toronto Star, 29 May 1993, p. 18.
