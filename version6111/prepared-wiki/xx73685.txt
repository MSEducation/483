[[Camperdown, Dundee]]

CATEGORIES: Areas of Dundee

Camperdown is an area of Dundee, Scotland, best known for Camperdown Park, which is the largest park in the city.
The name is Dutch in origin, being the English version of Kamperduin, a village of the North Holland province (north of Haarlem) on the North Sea coast of the Netherlands. This is because Adam Duncan (1 July 1731 - 4 August 1804), defeated the Dutch fleet off there on 11 October 1797 in the Battle of Camperdown. His home, Camperdown House, was in turn named after this, and then gave its name to the area.
