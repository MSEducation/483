Coffin Bay National Park is a national park in on the Eyre Peninsula of South Australia (Australia), 301 km west of Adelaide, and 46 km west of Port Lincoln. The township of Coffin Bay is near the entrance to the National Park. The National Park features a long peninsula with a sheltered bay, coastal dunes, swamps and a spectacular coastline of islands, reefs, limestone cliffs and white surf beaches.
To the east of Point Avoid are Almonta and Gunyah Beaches, used for surfing.  Reefs extend out to sea from Point Avoid to Golden Island with Price Island further out.  There is a camping area at Yangie Bay with camping fees payable on entry to the National Park. Access to the majority of the park's area north of Yangie Bay is via four wheel drive tracks only.

==Wildlife==

There is a great variety of wildlife in the national park, including until February 2004 wild horses, known as the Coffin Bay Ponies. Many seabirds can be seen including White-bellied Sea Eagles and Ospreys as well as various albatrosses and petrels.
The area covered by the national park is also classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area.  It supports over 1% of the world populations of Pied and Sooty Oystercatchers, as well as significant numbers of Fairy Terns, Hooded Plovers, Western Whipbirds, Rock Parrots and Blue-breasted Fairy-wrens.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Coffin Bay |accessdate=2011-06-16 |work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= [/tpl]
For over 20 years the Park has been cared for by the Friends of Coffin Bay Parks who have worked to revegetate native vegetation and eradicate feral animals and pest weeds. The results of these efforts can be clearly seen each year.
