[[J-segment]]

CATEGORIES: Car classifications

J-segment is defined by European Commission as the segment of the sport utility cars (including off-road vehicles). It approximately corresponds to SUV (Sport Utility Vehicles), CUV (Crossover Utility Vehicles) and pickups segments in North America.
Segment includes than a wide range of vehicles of recent generation of sport utility vehicles; as in the rest of the world, Crossover vehicles are becoming most popular versus the SUV's, although the difference between the two vehicle concepts is becoming more thin and definition mainly driven by the manufacturer marketing.
In Europe, most popular sub-segment is the compact one. Although a proper definition does not exist, generally compact utility vehicles are in the range of [tpl]convert|4100|mm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|4700|mm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] length, also if some exceptions may exist, as the offer in the segment is very wide: depending from the height and width some vehicles may fall into large or small category.
Pickups are also part of the segment, but in Europe they represent a very small niche. The largest markets for pickups are the UK and Portugal.
