==Company history==

===Early years===

Radio broadcasting began in South Africa in 1923. The SABC was established in 1936 through an Act of Parliament, and replaced the previous state-controlled African Broadcasting Corporation, formed in 1927, which was dissolved in the same year. It was a state monopoly for many years, and was controlled by the government.  During National Party rule from 1948 onwards, it came under increasing criticism and accusations of being biased towards the then ruling party. At one time most of its senior management were members of the Broederbond, the Afrikaner secret society and later drawn from institutions like Stellenbosch University. It was also known officially in Afrikaans as Suid-Afrikaanse Uitsaaikorporasie (SAUK), but this term is now only used by the SABC when referring to the Corporation in the spoken word on SABC2's Afrikaans TV news and on the Afrikaans radio station RSG. Although, the Afrikaans newscasts on SABC2 uses SABC Nuus instead of SAUK Nuus. The term is also still widely used by Afrikaans print media.
The SABC was a Radio service, as television was only introduced into South Africa in the 1970s.  There were three main SABC radio stations:  The English Service, the Afrikaans Service and the commercial station, Springbok Radio.  Programs on the English and Afrikaans services mainly consisted of the news, radio plays, such as "The Forsyte Saga", "Story of an African Farm", "The Summons" written and produced in South Africa, serious talk shows, BBC radio shows, children's programming, such as Sound Box, light music broadcasts featuring South African talent, such as orchestras, arrangers, musicians and singers.  The most renowned orchestral arrangers were Art Heatlie, Gerry Bosman, Dan Hill and Rollo Scott, head of the SABC music department.  Accomplished musicians such as Kenny Higgins and pianist and composer, Charles Segal were featured on all three stations on a regular basis in shows like "Piano Playtime" and accordianist Nico Carstens was a regular on the Afrikaans programs.  Springbok Radio was a bilingual commercial station, featuring a wide variety of programming, such as morning talk and news, game shows, soap operas, children's programming, music request programs, top-ten music, talent shows and other musical entertainment and comedy shows such as the very popular Saturday noontime show, "Telefun Time", where comedians like Steve Segal would phone various people and conjur up situation comedy.  Telefun Time was similar to the USA shows, Candid Camera and, much later, Punked.
Until 1979, the SABC also operated broadcasting services in Namibia, which was then under South African rule, but in that year, these were transferred to the South West African Broadcasting Corporation (SWABC). This, in turn, became the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) after the country's independence in 1990.

===Recent history===

In 1996, the SABC and its services were restructured to better serve and reflect the fresh democratic society of post-1994 South Africa – notably by reducing Afrikaans airtime on television. These actions, combined with the disposal of many of the 'historic' remnants of Afrikaans-dominated broadcasting (such as the Liewe Heksie puppets) have been labelled 'revenge' by some commentators. The SABC has since been accused of favouring the ruling ANC political party, mostly in the area of news broadcasting. However, it remains the dominant player in the country's broadcast media.
Criticism towards the public broadcaster intensified around 2003–2005, when it was accused of a wide range of shortcomings including self-censorship, lack of objectivity and selective news coverage.
Kaizer Kganyago, the spokesperson for the SABC, is also a member of the International Advisory Board of the African Press Organization.

===Establishment===

The SABC was established by an Act of Parliament in 1936 taking over from the African Broadcasting Company which had been responsible for some of the first radio broadcasts in South Africa in the 1920s. The SABC established services in what were then the country's official languages, English and Afrikaans, with broadcasts in languages such as Zulu, Xhosa, Sesotho and Tswana following later. The SABC's first commercial service, started in 1950, was known as Springbok Radio, broadcasting in English and Afrikaans. Regional FM music stations were started in the 1960s. In the 1960s, when British rule ended in South Africa, the Afrikaners' goal was to promote their culture and so, at first, the SABC's choice of popular music reflected the National Party government's initial conservatism, especially on the Afrikaans channel, with musicians such as Nico Carstens.  Eventually, musicians broke through the barrier, when the young, English-speaking Jewish musician and composer, Charles Segal collaborated with the older Afrikaans lyric-writer, Anton Dewaal, to write Afrikaans "liedjies" (songs) that became highly popular with the Afrikaans speaking public.  Once his talents gained the respect of the Afrikaans powers in the SABC, Segal was able to establish a foothold for himself and other English-speaking South African musicians to be featured on SABC programs.  However, there was tight censorship in all SABC broadcasts and, for example, some of the music of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones was generally frowned upon, if not banned from the airwaves, in favour of 'more wholesome' music.
In 1966 the SABC established an external service, known as Radio RSA, which broadcast in English, Swahili, French, Portuguese, Dutch and German. In 1969 the SABC held a national contest to find theme music for Radio RSA.  This contest was won by the popular South African pianist and composer, Charles Segal and co-writer, Dorothy Arenson.  Their composition, "Carousel" remained the theme song for Radio RSA right through to the 1990s.  Radio RSA is now known as Channel Africa.

===1996 restructuring===

In 1996 the SABC carried out a significant restructuring of their services. The main English-language radio service became SAfm. The new service, after some initial faltering, soon developed a respectable listenership and was regarded as a flagship for the new democracy. However, government interference in the state broadcaster in 2003 saw further changes to SAfm which reversed the growth and put it in rapid decline once more[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]. Today it attracts only 0.6% of the total population to its broadcasts. The main Afrikaans radio service was renamed Radio Sonder Grense (literally 'Radio Without Borders') in 1995 and has enjoyed greater success with the transition.
Similarly, SABC Radio's competitors have achieved great levels of popular appeal. Primedia-owned Radio 702, Cape Talk and 94.7 Highveld Stereo have grown steadily in audience and revenue through shrewd management since the freeing of the airwaves in South Africa. Other stations such as the black-owned and focused YFM and Kaya FM have also shone, attracting audiences drawn from the black majority.

==Television==

===Early history (1975–1995)===

In 1975, after years of controversy over the introduction of television, the SABC was finally allowed to introduce a colour TV service, which began experimental broadcasts in the main cities on 5 May 1975, before the service went nationwide on 6 January 1976. Initially, the TV service was funded entirely through a licence fee, as in the UK, but advertising began in 1978. The SABC (both Television and Radio) is still partly funded by the licence fee (currently R250 per annum).
The service initially broadcast only in English and Afrikaans, with an emphasis on religious programming on Sundays.
A local soap opera, The Villagers, set on a gold mine, was well received while other local productions like The Dingleys were panned as amateurish. Owing to South Africa's apartheid policies, the British actors' union Equity started a boycott of programme sales to South Africa, meaning that the majority of acquired programming in the early years of the corporation came from the United States. However, the Thames Television police drama series The Sweeney was briefly shown on SABC TV, dubbed in Afrikaans as Blitspatrollie. Later on, when other programmes were dubbed, the original soundtrack was simulcast on FM radio.
The SABC TV also produced lavish musical shows featuring the most popular South African composers, solo musicians, bands and orchestras.  For example, well-known South African pianist and composer, Charles Segal, was given a half hour special show: The Music of Charles Segal, where a selection of Segal's music was performed by various South African artists, such as Zane Adams, SABC Orchestra, Charles Segal and others.
With a limited budget, early programming aimed at children tended to be quite innovative, and programmes such as the Afrikaans-language puppetshows Haas Das se Nuus Kas and Oscar in Asblikfontein are still fondly remembered by many.
In 1 January 1982, two channels were introduced, TV2 broadcasting in Zulu and Xhosa and TV3 broadcasting in Sotho and Tswana. Later was launched TV4, broadcasting for black urban audience. The main channel, then called TV1, was divided evenly between English and Afrikaans, as before. Subtitling on TV in South Africa used to be almost non-existent, although now many non-English language soap operas have started to display English subtitles. The second channel, known either as TV2, TV3 or TV4 depending on the time of day, was in 1994 rebranded as CCV (Contemporary Community Values). A third channel was introduced known as TSS, or Topsport Surplus. Topsport being the brand name for the SABC's sport coverage, but this was renamed NNTV (National Network TV).
SABC television become widely available in neighbouring Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. The SABC also helped the South West African Broadcasting Corporation in Namibia to establish a television service in 1981 with most programming being videotapes flown in from South Africa. This became part of the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation in 1990.

===Recent history (1996 – present)===

In 1996, almost two years after the ANC came to power, the SABC reorganised its three TV channels, supposedly to be more representative of different language groups, but in effect giving preference to English, a minority language. These new channels were called SABC 1, SABC 2 and SABC 3. This resulted in an illogical grouping of languages, and the downgrading of Afrikaans, which now had its airtime reduced, a move that angered many Afrikaans-speakers.  In recent times, however, the SABC has started broadcasting more Afrikaans content on both on SABC2 and SABC3, with repeats of old programmes and new programmes being commissioned. The SABC also later absorbed the Bop TV station, of the former Bophuthatswana bantustan.

===New services===

In recent years, the SABC began broadcasting two TV channels to the rest of the continent, SABC Africa (a news service) and Africa 2 Africa (entertainment programming from South Africa and other African countries), in 1999. These were carried for free by DStv. In 2003, Africa 2 Africa was merged with SABC Africa. SABC Africa's news bulletins are also carried on the Original Black Entertainment (OBE) satellite television channel in the UK.
In South Africa itself, the SABC has announced the launch of two regional television channels, SABC4 and SABC5, with an emphasis on languages other than English. SABC4 will broadcast in Tswana, Sesotho, Pedi, Tsonga, Venda, and Afrikaans as well as English, to the northern provinces of the country. In the southern provinces, SABC5 will broadcast in Xhosa, Zulu, Ndebele, and Swazi, as well as Afrikaans and English.
Unlike other SABC TV services, SABC4 and SABC5 will not be available via satellite.

===Competition===

In 1986, the SABC's monopoly on TV was challenged by the launch of a subscription-based service known as M-Net, backed by a consortium of newspaper publishers. However, it could not broadcast its own news and current affairs programmes, which were still the preserve of the SABC. The SABC's dominance was further eroded by the launch of the first 'free-to-air' private TV channel, called e.tv. Satellite television also expanded, as M-Net's sister company, Multichoice, launched its digital satellite TV service (DStv) in 1995. Most of the SABC's TV channels are still provided as part of this service.

==Criticisms==

===Pro-ANC bias===

Opposition politicians often level the criticism of the SABC being an ANC mouthpiece,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=248529&area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/|title=Mail and Guardian interview with Democratic Alliance spokesperson Helen Zille|accessdate=August 2005[/tpl] a charge that the broadcaster was labelled with it under the previous Nationalist government. Despite a change in government, this public perception was reinforced when, in August 2005, the SABC came under heavy fire from non-affiliated media and the public for failing to broadcast a scene whereby Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka was booed offstage by members of the ANC Youth League, who were showing support for the newly axed ex-Deputy President, Jacob Zuma.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=248529&area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/|title=Mail and Guardian article on Youth League Controversy[/tpl]
Rival broadcaster eTV publicly accused SABC of 'biased reporting' by failing to show the video footage of the humiliated Deputy President, but Snuki Zikalala, Head of News and ex-ANC spokesperson retorted by stating that their cameraman was not present at the meeting, a claim later established to be false when eTV footage was released which showed an SABC cameraman filming the incident.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sundayindependent.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=1042&fArticleId=2872217|title=Sunday Independent on Deputy-President footage[/tpl]
SABC's government connections also came under scrutiny when, in April 2005, Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe was interviewed live by Zikalala, who is a former ANC political commissar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.co.za/2004/07/25/insight/in02.asp|title=Sunday Times on Robert Mugabe Interview[/tpl] The interview held was deemed by the public eye to have sidestepped 'critical issues' and controversial questions regarding Mugabe's radical land-reform policies and human rights violations.
In May 2006, the SABC was accused of self censorship, when it decided not to air a documentary on South African President Thabo Mbeki, and in early June requested that the producers (from Daylight Films) not speak about it. This has been widely criticised by independent media groups.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=14&click_id=6&art_id=vn20060610091410712C874542|title=IOL News Report[/tpl] In response, the International Freedom of Expression Exchange issued an alert concerning the SABC's apparent trend toward self-censorship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ifex.org/en/content/view/full/74682/|title=IFEX Self-Censorship Warning[/tpl]
In June 2006 the International Federation of Journalists denounced the cancelling of the Thabo Mbeki documentary, citing "self censorship" and "politically influenced managers".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=vn20060619012849541C504021|title=IFOJ comment on Mbeki documentary[/tpl]
Also in June 2006, SAfm host John Perlman disclosed on air that the SABC had created a blacklist of commentators.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/topstories.aspx?ID=BD4A220788|title=John Perlman disclosed blacklist[/tpl] A commission of inquiry was created by SABC CEO Dali Mpofu into the allegations that individuals were blacklisted at the behest of Zikalala.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=3015&art_id=vn20060624083017227C257392|title=IOL on blacklisting allegations[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=275243&area=/insight/insight__national/|title=MG on blacklisting allegations[/tpl]  Perlman eventually resigned from SAfm, and the broadcaster came under heavy fire from free media advocates.
Shortly before the ANC's 2012 elective conference in Mangaung, the board of the SABC handed control of news, television, radio and sport to COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. The board's decision was interpreted by some at the SABC as a calculated attempt to ensure that an ANC faction close to President Jacob Zuma was given positive coverage.
During a press conference, held by the SABC on 6 December 2012, to explain why it had prevented three journalists from participating in a discussion on how the media would cover the ANC's elective conference in Manguang, Hlaudi Motsoeneng said that whenever the ANC is discussed on the SABC an ANC party representative must be present.
In April 2014, journalists were warned by SABC chairperson, Ellen Zandile Tshabalala, that their phones were being wiretapped by the NIA, and reminded them to be loyal to the ANC ruling party.  When challenged on the matter, Tshabalala insisted that her comments had been taken out of context.  The scandal erupted at the same time that the DA official opposition accused the SABC of censorship[tpl]cite web|title=SABC censoring our adverts: DA|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2014/04/11/sabc-censoring-our-adverts-da|publisher=TimesLive|accessdate=13 April 2014[/tpl]  when they canned an advert that referred to the ongoing Nkandlagate scandal.

===Cultural bias===

Critics, including the influential newspaper, Mail and Guardian (Vol 24, No 35) have accused the broadcaster of cultural myopia by failing to recognise the diverse cultural mix of South Africa and excessive favouring of certain ethnic groups in their choice of entertainment offered particularly by the TV services.
