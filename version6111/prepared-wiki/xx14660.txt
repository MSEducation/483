Yorkshire has a number of breweries including Black Sheep, Copper Dragon, Cropton Brewery, John Smith's, Sam Smith's, Kelham Island Brewery, Theakstons, Timothy Taylor, Wharfedale Brewery and Leeds Brewery.
The beer style most associated with the county is bitter. As elsewhere in the North of England, when served through a handpump, a sparkler is used giving a tighter, more solid head.
Brewing has taken place on a large scale since at least the 12th century, for example at the now derelict Fountains Abbey which at its height produced 60 barrels of strong ale every ten days.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beer-pages.com/protz/features/st-albans-abbey-beer.htm |title=beer, by holy orders - St Albans Ale |publisher=Beer-pages.com |date= |accessdate=5 August 2011[/tpl]  Most current Yorkshire breweries date from the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th century.

==Governance==

===Politics===

From 1290, Yorkshire was represented by two Members of Parliament of the House of Commons of the Parliament of England. After the union with Scotland two members represented the county in the Parliament of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1832. In 1832 the county benefited from the disfranchisement of Grampound by taking an additional two members.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/prereform.html|publisher=Election. Demon.co.uk|title=Parliamentary Constituencies in the unreformed House|accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl] Yorkshire was represented at this time as one single, large,  county constituency. Like other counties, there were also some county boroughs within Yorkshire, the oldest of which was the City of York, which had existed since the ancient De Montfort's Parliament of 1265. After the Reform Act 1832, Yorkshire's political representation in parliament was drawn from its subdivisions, with Members of Parliament representing each of the three historic Ridings of Yorkshire; East Riding, North Riding, and West Riding constituencies.
For the 1865 general elections and onwards, the West Riding was further divided into Northern, Eastern and Southern parliamentary constituencies, though these only lasted until the major Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.revision-notes.co.uk/revision/820.html|publisher=Revision-Notes.co.uk|title= 1885 Redistribution Act|accessdate=25 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012082430/http://www.revision-notes.co.uk/revision/820.html |archivedate = 12 October 2007[/tpl] This act saw more localisation of government in the United Kingdom, with the introduction of 26 new parliamentary constituencies within Yorkshire, while the Local Government Act 1888 introduced some reforms for the county boroughs, of which there were eight in Yorkshire by the end of the 19th century.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1888/cukpga_18880041_en_1|publisher=OPSI.gov.uk|title=Local Government Act 1888|accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl]
With the Representation of the People Act 1918 there was some reshuffling on a local level for the 1918 general election, revised again during the 1950s.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/images/historical/1918representation.cfm|publisher=Parliament.co.uk|title=Representation of the People Act 1918|accessdate=25 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070311003222/http://www.parliament.uk/about/images/historical/1918representation.cfm |archivedate = 11 March 2007[/tpl]  The most controversial reorganisation of local government in Yorkshire was the Local Government Act 1972,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&PageNumber=58&NavFrom=2&parentActiveTextDocId=2431824&activetextdocid=2432047|publisher=StatuteLaw.gov.uk|title=Local Government Act 1972|accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl] put into practice in 1974. Under the act, the Ridings lost their lieutenancies, shrievalties, and administrative counties. County boroughs and their councils were abolished, to be replaced by metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties with vastly changed borders. Although some government officials[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aroundsaddleworth.co.uk/Old-Website/White_rose_red3.htm|publisher=AroundSaddleworth.co.uk|title=White Rose or Red|accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl] and Prince Charles[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/9-23-2004-59624.asp|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|title=Elsewhere (reprint of original article)|date=23 September 2004[/tpl] have asserted such reform is not meant to alter the ancient boundaries or cultural loyalties, there are pressure groups such as the Yorkshire Ridings Society who want greater recognition for the historic boundaries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yorkshireridings.org/news/the-yorkshire-ridings.html|publisher=Yorkshire Ridings Society|title=About|accessdate=3 June 2009[/tpl] In 1996 the East Riding of Yorkshire was reformed as a unitary authority area and a ceremonial county. The Yorkshire and the Humber region of government office covers most, but not all of the historic county. Yorkshire and the Humber is a constituency for European elections, returning six MEPs to the European Parliament.

===Monarchy and peerage===

When the territory of Yorkshire began to take shape as a result of the invasion of the Danish vikings, they instituted a monarchy  based at the settlement of Jórvík, York.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.viking.no/e/england/york/rulers_of_jorvik.html|publisher=Viking.no|title=The Rulers of Jorvik (York)|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] The reign of the Viking kings came to an end with the last king Eric Bloodaxe dying in battle in 954 after the invasion and conquest by the Kingdom of England from the south. Jórvík was the last of the independent kingdoms to be taken to form part of the Kingdom of England and thus the local monarchal title became defunct.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.viking.no/e/england/york/jorvik_who_ruled_it_and_when.html|publisher=Viking.no|title=Jorvik - who Ruled it and When?|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl]
Though the monarchal title became defunct, it was succeeded by the creation of the Earl of York title of nobility[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.northeastengland.talktalk.net/page24.htm|publisher=NorthEastEngland.talktalk.net|title=Timeline of North East History|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] by king of England Edgar the Peaceful in 960.(The earldom covered the general area of Yorkshire and is sometimes referred to as the Earl of Yorkshire) The title passed through the hands of various nobles, decided upon by the current king of England. The last man to hold the title was William le Gros, however the earldom was abolished by Henry II as a result of a troubled period known as The Anarchy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/files_ccc/03miHistoryInt2.pdf|publisher=SQA.org.uk|title=Murder in the Cathedral: Crown, Church and People 1154-1173|accessdate=24 October 2007|format=PDF[/tpl]
The peerage was recreated by Edward III in 1385, this time in the form of the prestigious title of Duke of York which he gave to his son Edmund of Langley. Edmund founded the House of York; later the title would be merged with that of the King of England. Much of the modern-day symbolism of Yorkshire, such as the White Rose of York, is derived from the Yorkists,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yorkshirehistory.com/yorkshirerose.htm|publisher=YorkshireHistory.com|title=The White Rose of Yorkshire|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] giving the house a special affinity within the culture of Yorkshire. Especially celebrated is the Yorkist king Richard III who spent much of his life at Middleham Castle in Yorkshire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.richardiiiyorkshire.co.uk/|publisher=Richard III Society - Yorkshire Branch|title=Why a Yorkshire Branch Site?|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] Since that time the title has passed through the hands of many, being merged with the crown and then recreated several times. The title of Duke of York remains prestigious and is given to the second son of the British monarch.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ukdukes.co.uk/the_dukes/the_duke_of_york/|publisher=UKDukes.co.uk|title=The Dukes of the Peerage of the United Kingdom: Duke of York|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl]
