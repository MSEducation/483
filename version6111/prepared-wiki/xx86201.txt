S. Flint ‘was undoubtedly the first theorist of the techniques ‘.Flint, F. S., Contemporary French Poetry,The Poetry Review Aug 1912 Later in 1912, Robert de Souza published his conclusion on the genrede Souza, Robert, Du Rythme en Francais, Welter, Paris 1912 ‘ that a vers libre was possible which would keep all the essential characteristics of vers classique, but would free it from the encumbrances which usage had made appear indispensable.Taupin, René, The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry (1986),(trans William Pratt) Ams Studies in Modern Literature, ISBN 0-404-61579 Thus the practice of verse libre was not the abandoning of pattern, but the creation of an original and complicated metrical form for each poem.Pondrom, Cryrena The Road from Paris, French Influence on English Poetry 1900-1920 Cambridge University Press 1974 ISBN 9780521131193 The formal stimulii for vers libre were vers libéré,(French verse of the late 19th century that liberated itself from classical rules of versification whilst observing the principle of isosyllabism and regular patterned rhyme),and vers libre classique,(a minor French genre of the 17th and 18th century which conformed to classic concepts, but in which lines of different length were irregularly and unpredictable combined), and vers populaire (versification derived from oral aspects of popular song).Scott, Clive, Vers libre : the emergence of free verse in France, 1886-1914 Clarendon Press, Oxford ISBN 9780198151593Remy de Gourmont's Livre des Masques gave definition to the whole vers libre movement Read, Herbert The Tenth Muse New York 1958 noting there should arise, at regular intervals, a full and complete line, which reassures the ear and guides the rhythm.Remy de Gourmant, Le Probleme du Style, Paris 1900

==Form and structure==

The unit of vers libre is not the foot,  the number of the syllables,  the quantity,  or the,line. The unit is the strophe,  which may be the whole poem,  or only a part. Each strophe is a complete circle.Lowes,  John Livingston Conventions and Revolt in Poetry Houghton Mifflin, Boston 1919 in vers libre  ‘verse-formal based upon cadence that allows the lines to flow as they will when read aloud by an intelligent reader’.Lowell, Amy, Preface, Sword Blades and Poppy Seed;  North American Review for January, 1917 Unrhymed cadence in vers libre is built upon 'organic rhythm,' or the rhythm of the speaking voice with its necessity for breathing, rather than upon a strict metrical system.Lowes,  John Livingston  Conventions and Revolt in Poetry Houghton Mifflin, Boston 1919 for vers libre addresses the ear not the eye.de Souza Robert, Du Rythme en Francais, Welter, Paris 1912 Vers libre is liberated from traditional rules concerning metre, caesura and line end stopping,Kahn, Gustave, Le Vers libre, Paris, 1923 ASIN: B008XZTTY2 every syllable pronounced is of nearly equal value but is less strongly accented than in English, being less intense requires less disciple to mold the accents into the poem's rhythm.Taupin, René, The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry (1986),(trans William Pratt) Ams Studies in Modern Literature, ISBN 0-404-61579 This new technique as defined by Kahn consisted of the denial of a regular number of syllables as the basis for versification, the length of line is long and short, oscillating with images used by the poet following the contours of his thoughts and is free rather than regular.Hulme, T. E., Lecture on Modern Poetry, Kensington Town Hall 1914
