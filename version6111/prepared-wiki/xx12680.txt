Jarrah apparently entered the United States on seven separate occasions, more than any other hijacker. On May 25, 2000, he applied for and received a five-year US [[B-1/B-2 Visa|B-1/B-2
(tourist/business) visa]] in Berlin. On June 27, 2000, he went to the U.S. for the first time, arriving at Newark International Airport. He then traveled to Florida, where he enrolled full-time at the Florida Flight Training Center in Venice. Jarrah did not apply for a change in his status, from a tourist visa to a student visa, thus violating his immigration status.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Monograph.pdf|title=Staff Monograph on 9/11 and Terrorist Travel|publisher=9/11 Commission|year=2004|format=PDF[/tpl]
Jarrah was enrolled in flight school for six months, from June 2000 to January 15, 2001. At the flight school, many of his classmates remember him fondly, describing him as kind and trustworthy, and remember him drinking beer occasionally.9-11 Report. p. 163. Retrieved on 2006-09-19. Jarrah was unique among the hijackers in that he did not live with any other hijackers, but rather lived with a German student named Thorsten Biermann. Biermann did not observe Jarrah acting particularly religiously or overtly politically. Jarrah occasionally flew back to Germany to visit his Turkish-German girlfriend, and called or e-mailed her nearly every day.
Jarrah had obtained his license to fly small planes in August 2000, and began training to fly large jets late that year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf|title=The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|date=2004|format=PDF[/tpl] p. 224 He flew to Sana'a to visit his family, and then to Germany to visit his girlfriend, Şengün. He brought her back to the United States for a ten-day visit, and she even attended a flight school session with him. In late January 2001, he again flew to Sana'a to visit his father who was ill and then visited his girlfriend, Şengün, in Germany, and returned to the United States once again in late February. His behavior was markedly different from the other hijackers, who broke off all familial and romantic relations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf|title=The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|date=2004|format=PDF[/tpl] p. 227
On his way back to the U.S., he passed through the UAE, according to that country's officials, where he was initially reported as having been interviewed by authorities on January 30, 2001, at the request of the CIA.[tpl]cite news|last=MacVicar|first=Sheila|coauthors=Caroline Faraj|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/08/01/cia.hijacker/index.html|title=September 11 hijacker questioned in January 2001|publisher=CNN|date=2002-08-01|accessdate=2006-09-08[/tpl]

In mid July 2001, some of the hijackers and members of the Hamburg cell gathered near Salou, Spain, for a period of a few days up to a couple of weeks. There seemed to be tension between Jarrah and Atta about the plot in its late stages. Atta had complained to Binalshibh about his difficulty in getting through to Jarrah and his fear that Jarrah may withdraw from the plot completely. On July 25, Jarrah flew to Germany on a one-way ticket and again met with his girlfriend, the last time she saw him. Later, he met with Binalshibh who convinced Jarrah to go through with the operation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf|title=The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|date=2004|format=PDF[/tpl] p. 246 Jarrah arrived back in the United States on August 5, though other sources indicate that he took his pilot's test on August 2, having missed his sister's wedding to do so.[tpl]cite news|last=Williams|first=Carol J.|title=Friends of terror suspect say allegations make no sense|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sns-worldtrade-jarrah-lat.story|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020203214236/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sns-worldtrade-jarrah-lat.story|archivedate=2002-02-03|date=October 23, 2001|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2006-09-08[/tpl] On August 27, he checked into a Laurel, Maryland, motel, only a mile away from the Valencia where four other hijackers were staying.[tpl]cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050123023057/http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/thepilot/timeline.html|title=PHOTOS: Life of a 9/11 Hijacker|publisher=CBC News|date=October 10, 2001|accessdate=January 23, 2005[/tpl] On September 7, 2001, all four of Flight 93 hijackers flew from Fort Lauderdale to Newark International Airport aboard Spirit Airlines.[tpl]cite web|title=Statement for the Record, FBI Director Robert S.

On September 10, Jarrah spent the last evening of his life writing a letter to Şengün, with whom he had made marriage plans. This letter is widely interpreted as a suicide note. The letter did not reach Şengün; she had entered witness protection shortly after the attacks and her apartment was unattended. The letter was returned to the United States by the postal services, where it was discovered and delivered to the FBI.[tpl]cite news|last=Williams|first=Carol J.|title=Love Letter Written by Suspected Hijacker Reportedly Surfaces|url=http://ktla.trb.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-111801letter.story|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040604014007/http://ktla.trb.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-111801letter.story|archivedate=2004-06-04|date=2001-11-18|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2006-09-08[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050224110404/http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/thepilot/note.html|title=Final Note to Aysel from Jarrah|publisher=CBC News|date=2001-10-10, Updated 2005-01-19|accessdate=2005-02-24[/tpl]

According to one source, Jarrah had set up a large mock cockpit made of cardboard boxes in his apartment just before the attacks.

==Attacks==

On the morning of September 11, 2001, Jarrah, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Nami and Ahmed al-Haznawi boarded United Airlines Flight 93 in Newark International Airport at gate A17 without incident, and sat in a first-class seat near the cockpit. Due to the flight's delay, the plane took off at 8:41 am, five minutes before American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center. The pilot and crew were notified of the first two hijackings that day, and were told to be on the alert. Within minutes, around 9:28 am, Flight 93 was hijacked as well.
The 9/11 Commission stated that Jarrah was the pilot. The flight transcript might indicate that Saeed al-Ghamdi, who also trained in flight simulators, could have been the pilot or a co-pilot. Two of the hijackers are heard calling the pilot "Saeed".Flight 93 Cockpit Transcript at Wikisource
The pilot's voice was heard by air traffic control telling passengers to remain seated. At 9:39 a.m., the pilot announced, "This is the captain. Would like you all to remain seated. There is a bomb on board and are going back to the airport, and to have our demands unintelligible. Please remain quiet." over the radio.[tpl]cite book|title=The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|date=2004|page=29[/tpl]
At least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandannas, and indicated that one of the men, believed to be either Ahmed al-Haznawi or Ahmed al-Nami, had a box tied around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside. Passengers on the plane learned the fates of the other hijacked planes through telephone calls; some decided to act, fearing their plane, too, would be used as a missile. A passenger uprising foiled the terrorists' plans, but failed to save the plane. According to the August 8, 2003, analysis of the plane's cockpit recording by the United States investigators, a group of passengers tried to break into the cockpit. To knock them off balance, the pilot rolled the plane to the left and right. When this failed, he then pitched the nose forward and back.[tpl]cite book|title=The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|date=2004|page=13[/tpl] The passengers persisted, using a service trolley as a battering ram to break through the cockpit door. Finally, the pilot was told by a fellow hijacker to crash rather than cede control of the plane. In response, he turned the plane upside down and put it into a dive. United 93 crashed, at 580 miles per hour (933 km/h), into a reclaimed strip mine at the edge of the woods near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at 10:03:11, 125 miles (200 km) from Washington, D.C. All aboard died.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2014[/tpl]
After September 11, Jarrah's girlfriend, Şengün, filed a missing person report in Bochum. Jarrah became a suspect as FBI agents found a "Ziad Jarrahi" in the flight manifest (the additional i at the end a possible misspelling).

==Mistaken identity claims==

There have been claims that Jarrah was not a hijacker or that he was not present on the plane and his identity was stolen. It has been pointed out that his behavior deviated from the profile presented by the other hijackers and that the passengers reported three and not four hijackers. However, the October 2006 emergence of a video shot on January 18, 2000, showing Jarrah recording his will alongside Mohamed Atta has cast heavy doubt on such claims.
Shortly after the September 11 attacks, family and friends claimed that Jarrah did not exhibit the same "smoldering political resentments" or "cultural conservatism" as Mohamed Atta. He was not raised with a background of religious conviction and did not hold to an obviously conservative lifestyle. Personnel at the flight school Jarrah attended described him as "a normal person". Jarrah called his family two days, and his girlfriend Aysel Sengün three hours, before boarding United Airlines Flight 93; Sengün described the conversation as "pleasant" and "normal". She also claimed that he never mentioned any names of the other hijackers. In his call two days before the attack, Jarrah told his family he would be coming home for a cousin's wedding. "It makes no sense," his uncle Jamal claimed. "He said he had even bought a new suit for the occasion." Jarrah's family in Lebanon claimed in September 2001 that he was an innocent passenger on the plane. His uncle, Jamal Jarrah, is currently a deputy in the Lebanese parliament, and a member of the Future Movement, a pro-Saudi political party led by Saad Hariri. On January 2, 2012, on a televised interview on Future TV, MP Jarrah denied his nephew's involvement in the 9-11 attacks, alluding to a conspiracy.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
On October 23, 2001, John Ashcroft claimed that Jarrah had shared a Hamburg apartment with Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A39318-2001Oct23&notFound=true|title=German Fugitives Sought in Attack Investigation|last=Eggen|first=Dan|publisher=The Washington Post|date=October 23, 2001|accessdate=2006-09-08[/tpl] mirror though German authorities that same day told the Los Angeles Times that they had no evidence that any of Jarrah's three apartments in Hamburg had been connected with the other hijackers. One high-ranking German police official stated, "The only information we have connecting the three Hamburg suspects is the FBI's assertion that there is a connection." In October 2006, however, a video surfaced showing Atta and Jarrah together in Afghanistan, clearly connecting Jarrah to the members of the Hamburg cell.
The 9/11 Commission concluded without qualification that Jarrah was a hijacker on the plane when it crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.[tpl]cite book|title=The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|date=2004|page=14[/tpl]
