==Biography==

The Bay Area-based trio first appeared in 1994 on Primo's album Stickin' to the Script on the song "Killa". Shortly after, they would release their debut album, Fiendin' 4 tha Funk. The album sold little outside the Bay Area and only made it to #76 on the Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The following year, they released a follow-up entitled A-1 Yola, which would fare much better on the charts, making it to #33 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and #22 on the Top Heatseekers. After A-1 Yola, two more albums were released, 1999's The Overdose and 2001's After the Drama, as well as two compilations, before disbanding in 2001.
