The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), is a multinational treaty for the purpose of establishing international standards for intellectual property rights enforcement. The agreement aims to establish an international legal framework for targeting counterfeit goods, generic medicines and copyright infringement on the Internet, and would create a new governing body outside existing forums, such as the World Trade Organization, the World Intellectual Property Organization, or the United Nations.
The agreement was signed in October 2011 by Australia, Canada, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and the United States.[tpl]cite news |author=Jason Walsh |title=Europe's Internet revolt: Protesters see threats in antipiracy treaty |date=11 February 2012 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2012/0211/Europe-s-Internet-revolt-protesters-see-threats-in-antipiracy-treaty |work=The Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=9 April 2012[/tpl] In 2012, Mexico, the European Union and 22 countries which are member states of the European Union signed as well.[tpl]cite news |author=Olivia Solon |title=The EU signs up to Acta, but French MEP quits in protest |date=26 January 2012 |url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-01/26/eu-signs-up-to-acta |work=Wired UK |accessdate=9 April 2012 [/tpl] One signatory (Japan) has ratified (formally approved) the agreement, which would come into force in countries that ratified it after ratification by six countries.
Industrial groups with interests in copyright, trademarks and other types of intellectual property,   said that ACTA was a response to "the increase in global trade of counterfeit goods and pirated copyright protected works".  Organizations such as the Motion Picture Association of America and International Trademark Association are understood to have had a significant influence over the ACTA agenda.[tpl]citation  |author=Monica Horten |title= A Copyright Masquerade - How Corporate Lobbying Threatens Online Freedoms |pages= 41–65|url= http://www.zedbooks.co.uk/paperback/a-copyright-masquerade[/tpl]
Organisations representing citizens and non-governmental interests argued that ACTA could infringe fundamental rights including freedom of expression and privacy. ACTA has also been criticised by Doctors Without Borders for endangering access to medicines in developing countries.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.msfaccess.org/sites/default/files/MSF_assets/Access/Docs/Access_Briefing_ACTABlankCheque_ENG_2012.pdf |title=A Blank Cheque For Abuse — The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and its Impact on Access to Medicines |format=PDF |date=February 2012 |publisher=Médecins Sans Frontières |accessdate=3 July 2012 [/tpl] The secret nature of negotiations has excluded civil society groups, developing countries and the general public from the agreement's negotiation process and it has been described as policy laundering by critics including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Entertainment Consumers Association.
The signature of the EU and many of its member states resulted in widespread protests across Europe.  The  European Parliament's  rapporteur Kader Arif resigned. His replacement, British MEP David Martin, recommended that the Parliament should reject ACTA, stating: "The intended benefits of this international agreement are far outweighed by the potential threats to civil liberties". On 4 July 2012, the European Parliament declined its consent, effectively rejecting it,  478 votes to 39,  and 165 abstentions.[tpl]cite news |author= Monica Horten |title=Wow what a scorcher!

==Negotiations==

Negotiations for the ACTA treaty are not part of any international body.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/ContentTopicSummary34357.aspx |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110716072750/http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/ContentTopicSummary34357.aspx |archivedate=16 July 2011 |title=On Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement |author=Ministry of Economic Development of New Zealand |authorlink=Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand) |year=2008 [/tpl] ACTA was first developed by Japan and the United States in 2006. Canada, the European Union (represented in the negotiations by the European Commission, the EU Presidency and EU Member States) and Switzerland joined the preliminary talks throughout 2006 and 2007. Official negotiations began in June 2008, with Australia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and Singapore joining the talks. The Senate of Mexico voted unanimously to withdraw Mexico from ACTA negotiations on 30 September 2010.[tpl]cite news |first=Mike |last=Masnick |title=Mexican Senate Unanimously Votes To Remove Mexico From ACTA Negotiations |date=6 October 2010 |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20101005/17320811304/mexican-senate-unanimously-votes-to-remove-mexico-from-acta-negotations.shtml |work=Techdirt |accessdate=5 February 2012 [/tpl]

===Leaks, publications and consultations===

ACTA first came to public attention in May 2008 after a discussion paper was uploaded to WikiLeaks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://WikiLeaks.org/wiki/Proposed_US_ACTA_multi-lateral_intellectual_property_trade_agreement_%282007%29 |title=Proposed US ACTA multi-lateral intellectual property trade agreement (2007) |publisher=WikiLeaks |date=22 May 2008 [/tpl] According to a European Union commentary however there was at that stage no draft, but the document constituted initial views as they had been circulated by some of the negotiating parties. Leaked details published in February 2009 showed the 6 chapter-division also present in the final text.  Most discussion was focused on the "Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights" (IPR) chapter 2, which had the four sections also present (but slightly differently named) in the final version: Civil Enforcement, Border Measures, Criminal Enforcement and Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement in the Digital Environment.[tpl]cite web |title=Fact Sheet: Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement |publisher=European Commission |url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2008/october/tradoc_140836.11.08.pdf |date=23 October 2007 (Updated November 2008) |format=PDF |accessdate=27 November 2009 [/tpl] Apart from the participating governments, an advisory committee of large US-based multinational corporations was consulted on the content of the draft treaty,[tpl]cite web |author=Knowledge Ecology International |url=http://www.keionline.org/blogs/2009/03/13/who-are-cleared-advisors |title=Who are the cleared advisors that have access to secret ACTA documents? |publisher=Knowledge Ecology International |date=13 October 2009 |accessdate=29 January 2012 [/tpl] including the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.keionline.org/content/view/193/1 |title=PhRMA comments to USTR on ACTA |author=PhRMA |date=21 March 2008[/tpl] and the International Intellectual Property Alliance[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iipa.com/aboutiipa.html |title=About IIPA |publisher=International Intellectual Property Alliance |accessdate=29 January 2012[/tpl] (which includes the Business Software Alliance, Motion Picture Association of America, and Recording Industry Association of America).[tpl]cite web |title=RIAA's ACTA wishlist includes gutted DMCA, mandatory filters |work=Ars Technica |url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080630-inside-the-riaas-acta-wishlist.html |author=Nate Anderson |date=30 June 2008 |accessdate=2 July 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080701132525/http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080630-inside-the-riaas-acta-wishlist.html |archivedate=1 July 2008  |deadurl=no [/tpl]  A 2009 Freedom of Information request showed that the following companies also received copies of the draft under a nondisclosure agreement: Google, eBay, Intel, Dell, News Corporation, Sony Pictures, Time Warner, and Verizon.[tpl]cite web |author=Ian Grant |title=ACTA talks focus on three strikes, no appeal deal for software pirates |work=Computer Weekly |date=4 November 2009 |url=http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2009/11/04/238414/Acta-talks-focus-on-three-strikes-no-appeal-deal-for-software.htm |accessdate=12 June 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100627175417/http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2009/11/04/238414/Acta-talks-focus-on-three-strikes-no-appeal-deal-for-software.htm |archivedate=27 June 2010  |deadurl=no [/tpl]

===Negotiation mandates and positions===

====European Union====

A draft Report from 26 August 2008 by the European Commission tried to establish a mandate from the European Parliament for the negotiation of ACTA.[tpl]cite web |author=Gianluca Susta |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=COMPARL&mode=XML&language=EN&reference=PE405.983 |title=Draft Report on the impact of counterfeiting on international trade |publisher=European Parliament's Committee on International Trade |date=26 August 2008 [/tpl] On 25 September 2008 the Council of the European Union adopted a resolution in support of ACTA.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/intm/103037.pdf |title=Council Resolution on a comprehensive European anti-counterfeiting plan |format=PDF |publisher=Council of the European Union |date=25 September 2008 |author=Presidency of the Council [/tpl] In November 2008 the European Commission described ACTA as an attempt to enforce intellectual property rights and states that countries involved in the negotiations see intellectual property rights as "a key instrument for their development and innovation policies". It argues:
In March 2010, a leaked draft negotiation text showed that the European Commission had proposed language in ACTA to require criminal penalties for "inciting, aiding and abetting" certain offenses, including "at least in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting and copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale."[tpl]cite web |title=EU proposes ACTA require criminal sanctions for inciting, aiding and abetting infringements |publisher=Knowledge Ecology International |url=http://keionline.org/node/806 |date=17 March 2010 |accessdate=19 March 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100322191648/http://keionline.org/node/806 |archivedate=22 March 2010  |deadurl=no [/tpl] In a report published on 11 March 2009, the European Parliament called on the European Commission to "immediately make all documents related to the ongoing international negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) publicly available".[tpl]cite web |title=European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2010 on the transparency and state of play of the ACTA negotiations |publisher=European Parliament |date=10 March 2010 |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2010-0058&language=EN&ring=P7-RC-2010-0154 |accessdate=13 June 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100722060547/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2010-0058&language=EN&ring=P7-RC-2010-0154 |archivedate=22 July 2010  |deadurl=no [/tpl]
The European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2010 on the transparency and state of play of the ACTA negotiations stated that "according to documents leaked, the ACTA negotiations touch on, among other things, pending EU legislation regarding the enforcement of IPRs (COD/2005/0127 – Criminal measures aimed at assuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRED-II)) and the so-called "Telecoms Package" and on existing EU legislation regarding e-commerce and data protection." The resolution furthermore states, "whereas the ongoing EU efforts to harmonise IPR enforcement measures should not be circumvented by trade negotiations which are outside the scope of normal EU decision-making processes." Also, that the enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRs), including patent, trademark, and copyright law, must be "accomplished in a manner that does not impede innovation or competition, undermine IPR limitations and personal data protection, restrict the free flow of information or unduly burden legitimate trade."
The resolution called for the European Commission and the European Council to "grant public and parliamentary access to ACTA negotiation texts and summaries, in accordance with" the Lisbon Treaty and "Regulation 1049/2001 of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents." In the resolution, the European Parliament "deplores the calculated choice of the parties not to negotiate through well-established international bodies, such as WIPO and WTO, which have established frameworks for public information and consultation". The European Parliament asserted that under the Treaty of Lisbon the European Commission needed to provide "immediate and full information" to the European Parliament on international treaties, such as ACTA. The resolution also "stresses that, unless Parliament is immediately and fully informed at all stages of the negotiations, it reserves its right to take suitable action, including bringing a case before the Court of Justice in order to safeguard its prerogatives".

==Signatures and ratifications==

As of 4 February 2013, the treaty was signed -but not all ratified- by 31 states as well as the European Union. Japan was on 4 October 2012 the first to ratify the treaty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/i_property/acta_conclusion_1210.html|title=Conclusion of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) by Japan|accessdate=6 October 2012|date=5 October 2012|work=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan[/tpl]
The treaty is according to Article 39 open for signature until 1 May 2013 for the participants involved in the negotiations as well as all members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) of which the participants agree. It enters into force after subsequent ratification by six states (Article 40). After 1 May 2013, WTO members that did not sign, may accede to the convention after approval by the ACTA committee (Article 43).
A signing ceremony was held on 1 October 2011 in Tokyo, with the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea signing the treaty. The European Union, Mexico, and Switzerland attended but did not sign, professing support and saying they will do so in the future[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/2011/october/joint-press-statement-anti-counterfeiting-trade-ag |work=Office of the United States Trade Representative |year=2011 |title=Joint Press Statement of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement Negotiating Parties[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/10/01/uk-japan-trade-counterfeiting-idUKTRE79018620111001 |title=Anti-counterfeiting agreement signed in Tokyo |work=Reuters |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=3 February 2012 [/tpl] (the European Union and 22 of its member states did so in January 2012).

===European Union===

The European Union and its 28 Member States share competency on the subject of this convention. This means that entry into force on its territory requires ratification (or accession) by all states, as well as approval of the European Union. Approval of the European Union involves consent of the European Parliament as well as the Council.[tpl]cite web |title=ACTA — Anti-counterfeiting Trade Agreement |url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/creating-opportunities/trade-topics/intellectual-property/anti-counterfeiting/ |date=2 February 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2012 |publisher=European Commission [/tpl] On 26 January 2012, the European Union and 22 Member States signed the treaty in Tokyo.

====European Parliament====

On 26 January 2012, after the signing of 22 European Member States Kader Arif, the European Parliament's rapporteur for ACTA, resigned, saying "I want to send a strong signal and alert the public opinion about this unacceptable situation. I will not take part in this masquerade.". He was replaced by David Martin.
On 12 April 2012, David Martin recommended that the European Parliament should reject ACTA, saying the intended benefits were far outweighed by the risks, and "given the vagueness of certain aspects of the text and the uncertainty over its interpretation, the European Parliament cannot guarantee adequate protection for citizens' rights in the future under ACTA."[tpl]cite web |title=EU rapporteur's draft recommendation |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML%2BCOMPARL%2BPE-486.174%2B02%2BDOC%2BPDF%2BV0//EN |format=PDF |publisher=European Parliament [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-17728045 |title=Euro MP David Martin dismisses anti-counterfeiting treaty |accessdate=4 May 2012 |date=16 April 2012 |work=BBC News Online [/tpl]

===United States===

It has been reported that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has stated they will not use the fast track negotiating authority (Trade Promotion Authority) to implement ACTA, but the form of a "sole executive agreement" instead.[tpl]Cite journal |authors=Eddan Katz and Gwen Hinze |title=The Impact of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement on the Knowledge Economy: The Accountability of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative for the Creation of IP Enforcement Norms through Executive Trade Agreements |url=http://www.yjil.org/docs/pub/o-35-katz-hinze-ACTA-on-knowledge-economy.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=30 January 2012 |date=November 2009 |journal=Yale Journal of International Law |postscript=.

The controversy over ACTA should surprise no one." More recently, on 20 March 2012, Senator Wyden noted, "I believe Congress should approve binding international agreements before the U.S. is obligated to comply with those agreements. This is a point where the administration and I disagree and is particularly true on matters that impact our nation’s ability to implement policies that encourage innovation."[tpl]cite web |author=David Kravets |title=Copyright Treaty Requires Congressional Support, Senator Says |url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/acta-congressional-approval/ |date=20 March 2012 |publisher=Wired News |accessdate=21 March 2012 [/tpl]

==Treaty content==

The finalized agreement text[tpl]cite web |title=Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/topics-domaines/ip-pi/acta-text-acrc.aspx?lang=eng |date=15 April 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2012 |format=PDF |publisher=Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade [/tpl] was published on 15 April 2011 and includes six chapters with 45 articles:

===Chapter I: Initial Provisions and General Definitions===

This Chapter describes the scope of the agreement as well as relations to other agreements. It asserts that obligations from other agreements still exist with entry into force of this agreement (Article 1) and that the agreement applies only those intellectual property rights existing in the country applying the treaty (Article 3). Countries may impose stricter measures than the treaty requires (Article 2) and should share (confidential) information for law enforcement purposes (Article 4). The treaty explicitly also applies to free zoned (Article 5).

===Chapter II: Legal Framework For Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights===

The legal framework set out in Chapter II is divided in five sections.

====Section 1: General Obligations with Respect to Enforcement====

General obligations are requirements to implement the provisions in law, to have fair procedure as well as "proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement, the interests of third parties, and the applicable measures, remedies and penalties" (Article 6).

====Section 2: Civil Enforcement====

The sections provides that rights holders have access to civil or (if they exist) administrative procedures (Article 7) and to have the possibility for judges "to issue an order against a party to desist from an infringement" (Article 8). They may also require in civil procedure pirated copyright goods and counterfeit trademark goods to be destroyed (Article 10). According to Article 11, they may ask (alleged) infringers to provide information on the goods it "controls". Article 9 states that a Party's judicial authorities may consider [tpl]lang|la|inter alia[/tpl] any legitimate measure of value submitted by a rights holder, including lost profits, the value of infringed property as per market price, or the suggested retail price. This clause has received considerable criticism for its validity, as well as its similarity to previously controversial attempts at establishing precedent to the same effect. According to the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure, the principle does not "reflect the economic loss suffered by the right holder".[tpl]cite news |author=Jennifer Baker |title=ACTA Text Hurts Startups, Goes Beyond EU Law, Says FFII |date=4 April 2011 |publisher=PCWorld |url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/227048/acta_text_hurts_startups_goes_beyond_eu_law_says_ffii.html |work=IDG News |accessdate=29 January 2012 [/tpl] In a Business Line opinion piece, a professor from the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade's Centre for WTO Studies also explained that it would lead to "excess valuation" in infringement suits.[tpl]cite news |author=Madhukar Sinha |title=IPR rules and their uncertain effects |date=2 June 2011 |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/article2068519.ece |work=Business Line |accessdate=29 January 2012 [/tpl]

====Section 3: Border Measures====

At borders, officials may act on suspect goods on their own initiative or upon request of a "rights holder". For goods in transit, the requirements do not have to enacted by a state (Article 16). "Small consignment" for commercial use are included in the border provisions, while "goods of a non-commercial nature contained in travellers’ personal luggage" are excluded from the scope (Article 14).

====Section 4: Criminal Enforcement====

=====Article 23: Criminal Offences=====

At least "wilful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale" should be punishable under criminal law.
According to European Digital Rights, the article "provides an extremely low threshold" when considering that the scope includes "acts" and because consequences for infringement can include criminal penalties.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.edri.org/files/EDRI_acta_series_2_20120117.pdf |title=ACTA – Criminal sanctions |accessdate=5 February 2012 |date=17 January 2012 |publisher=European Digital Rights |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65DmRnRob |archivedate=5 February 2012 [/tpl] EDRi also outlines an absence of definitions for associated constructs, such as "aiding and abetting", "commercial scale", and "economic advantage", which it describes as "simply inappropriate in a key provision, on whose meaning the proportionality and the legality, of the Agreement rests".

=====Article 24: Penalties=====

Penalties that Parties should have in their criminal system should "include imprisonment as well as monetary fines", which are sufficiently high for discouragement of actions forbidden under the treaty.

====Section 5: Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights in the Digital Environment====

=====Article 27: Enforcement in the Digital Environment=====

In the digital environment, also Civil and Criminal enforcement should be available "to permit effective action against an act of infringement of intellectual property rights which takes place in the digital environment" (Article 27, paragraph 1). Furthermore, infringement over digital networks (possibly including "the unlawful use of means of widespread distribution for infringing purposes") should be enforced in a manner, which "preserves fundamental principles such as freedom of expression, fair process, and privacy" (Paragraph 2). Against circumvention of systems to prevent copying measures should be implemented (Paragraph 6).
Critics of this article, such as the European Digital Rights, have raised concerns that its emphasis on the role of corporations in enforcement "promotes the policing and even punishment of alleged infringements outside normal judicial frameworks", while failing to "ensure effective remedies against such interferences with fundamental rights" despite "vague references to 'fair process' in the text that are not backed up by mandatory processes requiring respect for the Rule of Law" in Article 21 of the European Union's Maastricht Treaty.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.edri.org/files/EDRI_acta_series_1_20120116.pdf |title=ACTA and its impact on fundamental rights |accessdate=5 February 2012 |date=16 January 2012 |format=PDF |publisher=European Digital Rights |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65DjZsK8f |archivedate=5 February 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.edri.org/files/EDRI_acta_series_4_20120119.pdf |title=The impact of the ACTA on the EU's international relations |accessdate=5 February 2012 |publisher=European Digital Rights |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65DnN9Y2g |archivedate=5 February 2012 |quote=The preamble of ACTA, as well as the 'Digital Chapter' specifically promotes policing and enforcement through 'cooperation' between private companies. This is an obvious violation of Article 21 of the TEU which re-states the EU's obligation to support democracy and the rule of law in its international relations. [/tpl]

===Chapter III: Enforcement Practices===

====Article 28: Enforcement Expertise, Information, and Domestic Coordination====

Parties are expected to cultivate expertise within agencies tasked with enforcing intellectual property rights, promote internal coordination, and facilitate joint actions. They are also compelled to collect and utilize statistical data, as well as "other relevant information concerning intellectual property rights infringements", to prevent and combat infringement as necessary. The article also indicates that parties shall "endeavour to promote, where appropriate, the establishment and maintenance of formal or informal mechanisms, such as advisory groups, whereby their competent authorities may receive the views of right holders and other relevant stakeholders."

====Article 29: Management of Risk at Border====

Parties may consult stakeholders or the intellectual property authorities of another party to identify and mitigate risks. Information, including but not limited to information that assists in identifying and targeting suspicious shipments, may be shared between parties for the purposes of border enforcement. Should an importing party seize infringing goods, it may supply such information to assist an exporting party in pursuing infringers.

===Chapter IV: International Cooperation===

Chapter V contains three articles:

===Chapter V: Institutional Arrangements===

In Article 36, the ACTA committee is established as governing body of the treaty in which all parties are represented. The body is not involved in individual cases, but monitors implementation, can formally propose changes to the convention (on the suggestion of a Party) and decides on the admittance of WTO-members which were not present at the negotiations. The committee decides by consensus. Parties establish a contact point (Article 37) which acts as a primary contact with regards to the execution of the treaty and are required to "shall accord sympathetic consideration" to requests for cooperation on matters regarding the convention (Article 38).

===Chapter VI: Final Provisions===

Chapter VI is the treaty's last chapter. It outlines principles and procedures regarding the treaty's status and execution.

====Article 39: Signature====

The article specifies that the agreement remains open for signature until 1 May 2013 by its negotiators, as well as any other World Trade Organization member that the negotiators support by consensus.

====Article 40: Entry into Force====

Conditions necessary for the treaty to become effective are defined, which include six parties submitting instruments of ratification, acceptance, or approval to the depositary, as well as a thirty-day interim waiting period.

====Article 41: Withdrawal====

The process for withdrawal is outlined, which entails a party submitting written notification to the depositary and becomes effective 180 days after receipt.Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, Article 41 This process would also be subject to various national guidelines.

====Article 42: Amendments====

Parties may submit proposed amendments to the Committee for review, which would then determine whether or not the proposed amendment should be presented for potential ratification, acceptance, or approval. Successful amendments would become effective 90 days after all parties have provided their respective instruments of ratification, acceptance, or approval to the depositary.[tpl]Cite web |title=Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement: Australian Treaty National Interest Analysis |page=7 |year=2011 |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/jsct/21november2011/treaties/anti_counterfeiting_nia.pdf |format=PDF [/tpl]Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, Article 42
In a report to the Australian Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, Kimberlee Weatherall, an associate professor at the University of Queensland, assessed the article in saying "it might be argued that the text of ACTA could be fleshed out through guidelines on an ongoing basis, with possible amendments in the longer term."[tpl]Cite book |contribution=Submission of Associate Professor Kimberlee Weatherall |title=Joint Standing Committee on Treaties Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement |editor=Kimberlee Weatherall |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |place=Sydney |page=17 |date=27 January 2012| id=|contribution-url=http://works.bepress.com/kimweatherall/26/ |postscript=. [/tpl] Citing the relationship with Article 33, she added that "it might further be argued that the exhortations to 'promote cooperation, where appropriate, among Parties' competent authorities', particularly in conjunction with the existence of regular meetings and exchange of information about enforcement practices, creates the basic framework within which more detailed mechanisms can be developed over time".

====Article 43: Accession====

After the date in Article 39 passes, any WTO member nation may seek to accede into the agreement. The terms of acceptance would be decided by the Committee on an individual, case-by-case basis. The treaty would enter into force for successful applicants thirty days after receipt of its instrument by the depositary.

====Article 44: Texts of the Agreement====

The treaty makes equally authoritative English, French and Spanish versions of the text, which for the purposes of signature are part of a single document.

====Article 45: Depositary====

Article 45 is the final text of the treaty. It elects the Government of Japan as depositary.

===Secrecy of negotiations===

The Electronic Frontier Foundation opposes ACTA, calling for more public spotlight on the proposed treaty.[tpl]cite web |title=Sunlight for ACTA |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |url=http://www.eff.org/action/sunlight-acta |accessdate=5 July 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080626103510/http://www.eff.org/action/sunlight-acta |archivedate=26 June 2008  |deadurl=no [/tpl] Since May 2008 discussion papers and other documents relating to the negotiation of ACTA have been uploaded to WikiLeaks, and newspaper reports about the secret negotiations swiftly followed.[tpl]Cite news |author=Carly Weeks |title=Anti-piracy strategy will help government to spy, critic says |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080526.COPYRIGHT26//TPStory/National |work=The Globe and Mail |date=26 May 2008 |accessdate=27 May 2008 |archivedate=29 May 2008  |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080529230325/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080526.COPYRIGHT26/TPStory/National [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=11870 |title=WikiLeaks Airs U.S. Plans to Kill Pirate Bay, Monitor ISPs With Multinational ACTA Proposal |work=Daily Tech |date=23 May 2008 |author=Jason Mick [/tpl]
In June 2008, Canadian academic Michael Geist, writing for Copyright News, argued that "Government Should Lift Veil on ACTA Secrecy", noting that before documents leaked on the Internet, ACTA was shrouded in secrecy. Coverage of the documents by the Toronto Star "sparked widespread opposition as Canadians worry about the prospect of a trade deal that could lead to invasive searches of personal computers and increased surveillance of online activities". Geist argued that public disclosure of the draft ACTA treaty "might put an end to fears about iPod-searching border guards" and that it "could focus attention on other key concerns including greater Internet service provider filtering of content, heightened liability for websites that link to allegedly infringing content, and diminished privacy for Internet users". Geist also argued that greater transparency would lead to a more inclusive process, highlighting that the ACTA negotiations have excluded both civil society groups as well as developing countries. Geist reported that "reports suggest that trade negotiators have been required to sign non-disclosure agreements for fear of word of the treaty's provisions leaking to the public". He argued that there is a need for "cooperation from all stakeholders to battle counterfeiting concerns" and that "an effective strategy requires broader participation and regular mechanisms for feedback".[tpl]cite web |author=Michael Geist |title=Government Should Lift Veil on ACTA Secrecy |url=http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/3013/135/ |date=9 June 2008 |accessdate=28 November 2008 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081205070642/http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/3013/135/ |archivedate=5 December 2008  |deadurl=no [/tpl]
In November 2008, the European Commission responded to these allegations as follows:
As another indicator of the way that the ACTA process was handled by the EU, the Council of Ministers officially adopted ACTA at a meeting of the Fisheries Council.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iptegrity.com/index.php/acta/726-eu-council-gives-fishy-go-ahead-for-acta|title=EU Council gives fishy go-ahead for ACTA |work=Iptegrity.com |date=18 December 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2013[/tpl]
To coincide with the negotiation round InternetNZ, a nonprofit organisation, held a PublicACTA event on 10 April 2010 to discuss the known and likely content of the ACTA draft agreement and to develop a statement on ACTA.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/internetnz-launches-anti-acta-petition-121331 |title= InternetNZ launches petition to limit ACTA |work=National Business Review |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=27 June 2010 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100602123319/http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/internetnz-launches-anti-acta-petition-121331 |archivedate= 2 June 2010  |deadurl=no [/tpl] At the event, the Wellington Declaration was developed by over 100 participants, and was published the following day along with a petition for its endorsement. By 13 April, it had received 6,645 signatures. The Wellington Declaration and the petition was given to the government of New Zealand, which delivered the Declaration to the other negotiating countries.[tpl]cite web |url=http://publicacta.org.nz/wellington-declaration/ |title=The Wellington Declaration |accessdate=16 April 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100414232238/http://publicacta.org.nz/wellington-declaration/ |archivedate=14 April 2010 |deadurl=no [/tpl]

===Threats to freedom and human rights===

An open letter signed by many organizations, including Consumers International, European Digital Rights (EDRi, an umbrella group for 32 European civil rights and privacy NGOs), the Free Software Foundation (FSF), the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), ASIC (French trade association for Web 2.0 companies), and the Free Knowledge Institute, states that "the current draft of ACTA would profoundly restrict the fundamental rights and freedoms of European citizens, most notably the freedom of expression and communication privacy."[tpl]cite web |url=http://freeknowledge.eu/acta-a-global-threat-to-freedoms-open-letter |title=ACTA: A Global Threat to Freedoms (Open Letter) |publisher=Free Knowledge Institute |accessdate=29 January 2012[/tpl] The Free Software Foundation argues that ACTA will create a culture of surveillance and suspicion.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/acta/|title=Speak out against ACTA |publisher=Free Software Foundation [/tpl] Aaron Shaw, Research Fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, argues that "ACTA would create unduly harsh legal standards that do not reflect contemporary principles of democratic government, free market exchange, or civil liberties. Even though the precise terms of ACTA remain undecided, the negotiants' preliminary documents reveal many troubling aspects of the proposed agreement" such as removing "legal safeguards that protect Internet Service Providers from liability for the actions of their subscribers" in effect giving ISPs no option but to comply with privacy invasions. Shaw further says that "ACTA would also facilitate privacy violations by trademark and copyright holders against private citizens suspected of infringement activities without any sort of legal due process".[tpl]Cite journal |author=Aaron Shaw |title=The Problem with the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (and what to do about it) |url=http://kestudies.org/node/20/ |journal=KEStudies |volume=2 |date=April 2009 [/tpl]
The Free Software Foundation (FSF) has published "Speak out against ACTA", stating that the ACTA threatens free software by creating a culture "in which the freedom that is required to produce free software is seen as dangerous and threatening rather than creative, innovative, and exciting." ACTA would also require that existing ISPs no longer host free software that can access copyrighted media; this would substantially affect many sites that offer free software or host software projects such as SourceForge.  Specifically, the FSF argues that ACTA will make it more difficult and expensive to distribute free software via file sharing and P2P technologies like BitTorrent, which are currently used to distribute large amounts of free software. The FSF also argues that ACTA will make it harder for users of free operating systems to play non-free media because DRM protected media would not be legally playable with free software.
On 10 March 2010, the European Parliament adopted a resolution[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2010-0058&language=EN&ring=P7-RC-2010-0154 |title=Texts adopted – Wednesday, 10 March 2010 – Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) – P7_TA(2010)0058 |work=Europa |date=10 March 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2012 [/tpl] criticizing the ACTA with 663 in favor of the resolution and 13 against, arguing that "in order to respect fundamental rights, such as the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy" certain changes in the ACTA content and the process should be made.

===Criminalising generic medicine===

According to French EP member Kader Arif, "The problem with ACTA is that, by focusing on the fight against violation of intellectual property rights in general, it treats a generic drug just as a counterfeited drug. This means the patent holder can stop the shipping of the drugs to a developing country, seize the cargo and even order the destruction of the drugs as a preventive measure." He continued, "Generic medicines are not counterfeited medicines; they are not the fake version of a drug; they are a generic version of a drug, produced either because the patent on the original drug has expired, or because a country has to put in place public health policies," he said.
A number of countries such as India and African nations have histories of seeking generic cheaper versions of expensive drugs for infections such as HIV, something that has often been resisted by pharmaceutical companies. "There are international agreements, such as the TRIPS Agreement, which foresees this last possibility," he said. "They're particularly important for developing countries which cannot afford to pay for patented HIV drugs, for example. Arif has stated ACTA would limit the freedom of countries such as India to determine their own medical choices.[tpl]cite news |title=ACTA goes too far, says MEP |author=Charles Arthur |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/feb/01/acta-goes-too-far-kader-arif |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 February 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2012 [/tpl]
Also the non-governmental organization Médecins Sans Frontières has taken a stance against ACTA[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.msfaccess.org/common-tags/acta |title=The Access Campaign: ACTA |publisher=Médecins Sans Frontières |accessdate=2 July 2012 [/tpl] as a part of their Access Campaign, a campaign promoting the development and access to "life-saving and life prolonging medicines".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.msfaccess.org/the-access-campaign |title=The Access Campaign: About Us |publisher=Médecins Sans Frontières |accessdate=2 July 2012[/tpl] In their report A blank cheque for abuse: ACTA & its Impact on Access to Medicines, Médecins Sans Frontières concludes that ACTA has "fatal consequences on access to medicines", furthermore that the agreement "does nothing to address the problem of poor quality and unsafe medicines" and finally that ACTA "undermines existing international declarations to protect public health", circumventing the Doha Declaration.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.msfaccess.org/sites/default/files/MSF_assets/Access/Docs/Access_Briefing_ACTABlankCheque_ENG_2012.pdf |title=The Access Campaign: ACTA Briefing |publisher=Médecins Sans Frontières |format=PDF |accessdate=2 July 2012 [/tpl] Michael Gylling Nielsen, the executive of the Danish division of Médecins Sans Frontières, has in a statement to the media said that "In the end, this is a question of life and death", elaborating his point by mentioning the "possible consequenses" of the treaty that "the hundreds of thousands of people who for example have HIV/AIDS not will get the treatment they need".[tpl]cite news |title=Actaavtalet "dödar" i tredje världen |trans_title=Acta Agreement "kills" in the Third World |url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/utrikes/actaavtalet-dodar-i-tredje-varlden_6842553.svd |newspaper=Svenska Dagbladet |date=11 February 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012 |language=Swedish [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Actaavtalet "dödar" i tredje världen |trans_title=Acta Agreement "kills" in the Third World |url=http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/actaavtalet-dodar-i-tredje-varlden |newspaper=Dagens Nyheter |date=11 February 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012 |language=Swedish [/tpl]

===Legal scope===

Nate Anderson with Ars Technica pointed out that ACTA encourages service providers to collect and provide information about suspected infringers by giving them "safe harbor from certain legal threats". Similarly, it provides for criminalization of copyright infringement on a commercial scale,[tpl]cite web |title=Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, Section 4: Criminal Enforcement |url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2011/may/tradoc_147937.pdf |publisher=European Commission Directorate General for Trade |accessdate=21 January 2011 [/tpl] granting law enforcement the powers to perform criminal investigation, arrests and pursue criminal citations or prosecution of suspects who may have infringed on copyright on a commercial scale. It also allows criminal investigations and invasive searches to be performed against individuals for whom there is no probable cause, and in that regard weakens the presumption of innocence and allows what would in the past have been considered unlawful searches.
Since ACTA is an international treaty, it is an example of policy laundering used to establish and implement legal changes.  Policy laundering allows legal provisions to be pushed through via closed negotiations among private members of the executive bodies of the signatories.  This method avoids use of public legislation and its judiciary oversight.  Once ratified, companies belonging to non-members may be forced to follow the ACTA requirements since they will otherwise fall out of the safe harbor protections.  Also, the use of trade incentives and the like to persuade other nations to adopt treaties is a standard approach in international relationships.  Additional signatories would have to accept ACTA's terms without much scope for negotiation.[tpl]cite web|title=The real ACTA threat (it's not iPod-scanning border guards) |work=Ars Technica |url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080602-the-real-acta-threat-its-not-ipod-scanning-border-guards.html |author=Nate Anderson |date=2 June 2008 |accessdate=14 June 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080605004747/http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080602-the-real-acta-threat-its-not-ipod-scanning-border-guards.html |archivedate=5 June 2008  |deadurl=no [/tpl]
From 16–18 June 2010, a conference was held at the Washington College of Law, attended by "over 90 academics, practitioners and public interest organizations from six continents". Their conclusions were published on 23 June 2010 on the American University Washington College of Law website. They found "that the terms of the publicly released draft of ACTA threaten numerous public interests, including every concern specifically disclaimed by negotiators." A group of over 75 law professors signed a letter to President Obama demanding a host of changes to the agreement. The letter alleges that no meaningful transparency has been in evidence.

===Parallels with SOPA and PIPA===

Connor Adams Sheets of the International Business Times outlined five categories where digital rights advocates compared but expressed greater concern about ACTA than SOPA. Among these were the treaty's broader international nature, its fundamental lack of transparency, the relative ease of enactment, the degree of support by signatories, and a lack of visibility on the global political stage.[tpl]cite news |author=Connor Sheets |title=ACTA vs. SOPA: Five Reasons ACTA is Scarier Threat to Internet Freedom |date=24 January 2011 |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/286925/20120124/acta-sopa-reasons-scarier-threat-internet-freedom.htm |work=International Business Times |accessdate=29 January 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/652uCsDQL |archivedate=28 January 2012 [/tpl] Forbes writer E.D.

==Requests for disclosure==

In September 2008, a number of interest groups urged parties to the ACTA negotiations to disclose the language of the evolving agreement. In an open letter, the groups argued that: "Because the text of the treaty and relevant discussion documents remain secret, the public has no way of assessing whether and to what extent these and related concerns are merited." The interest groups included: the Consumers Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Essential Action, IP Justice, Knowledge Ecology International, Public Knowledge, Global Trade Watch, the US Public Interest Research Group, IP Left (Korea), the Canadian Library Association, the Consumers Union of Japan, Consumer Focus (UK) and Médecins Sans Frontières' Campaign for Essential Medicines.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/09/international-i.html |title=Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement: Fact or Fiction? |work=Wired |date=15 September 2008 [/tpl] The Electronic Frontier Foundation and Public Knowledge filed a Freedom of Information Act request which was denied.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.eff.org/issues/acta |title=What is ACTA? |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |accessdate=1 December 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081127020704/http://www.eff.org/issues/acta |archivedate=27 November 2008  |deadurl=no [/tpl]

===Australia===

A coalition of concerned organisations submitted to the responsible Australian Government department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.[tpl]cite web |title=Principles for ACTA negotiations |url=http://www.digital.org.au/submission/documents/PrinciplesforACTAnegotiations.pdf |format=PDF [/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]
The submission agreed that reducing counterfeiting is important where it endangers consumer health or safety, or constitutes commercial scale infringement. However, the coalition urged that pursuit of that goal should not threaten legitimate commercial, social, innovative and creative activities, the rights of consumers or the free flow of information. The coalition noted the current proposed treaty raised serious concerns with respect to transparency, increased customs search powers, increased penalties for IP infringement, and lack of due process.
The coalition consisted of:

===Canada===

The University of Ottawa's Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic filed an Access to Information Act request to see the government's position but received only a document stating the title of the agreement, with everything else blacked out.

===European Union===

In November 2008, the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure requested secret Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) documents from the EU Council, specifically naming twelve documents to be published.[tpl]cite press release |url=http://press.ffii.org/Press_releases/FFII_opposes_stealth_legislation%2C_demands_ACTA_documents |title=FFII opposes stealth legislation, demands ACTA documents |date=3 November 2008 |accessdate=4 February 2012 |publisher=Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure [/tpl] The request was denied by the EU council, stating that "disclosure of this information could impede the proper conduct of the negotiations, would weaken the position of the European Union in these negotiations and might affect relations with the third parties concerned".[tpl]cite press release |url=http://press.ffii.org/Press_releases/EU_Council_refuses_to_release_secret_ACTA_documents |date=10 November 2008 |title=EU Council refuses to release secret ACTA documents |accessdate=4 February 2012 |publisher=Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure [/tpl] In March 2010, the European Parliament passed a resolution demanding greater transparency in public affairs, which among other things called on the European Commission to make public all documents relating to the negotiations.

===New Zealand===

In August 2005, a coalition[tpl]cite web |url=http://acta.net.nz |title=acta.net.nz coalition |accessdate=20 March 2010 |author=acta.net.nz |date=20 March 2010 [/tpl] of NGOs and individuals formed to request more transparency in ACTA negotiations. At briefings held by the Ministry of Economic Development (MED) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) on 16 December 2009, representatives from the coalition organisations supported the New Zealand negotiators stated desire to call for more transparency. In December 2009 two New Zealand members of Parliament, Clare Curran (Labour) and Peter Dunne (United Future) also publicly questioned the need for secrecy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blog.labour.org.nz/index.php/2009/12/04/whats-the-need-for-secrecy/ |title=What's the need for Secrecy? |accessdate=12 April 2009 |author=Clare Curran |date=12 April 2009 |publisher=New Zealand Labour Party [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unitedfuture.org.nz/default,1286,dunne_what_are_we_signing_up_to_mr_power.sm |title=Dunne: What are we signing up to, Mr Power? |accessdate=12 April 2009 |author=Peter Dunne |date=12 April 2009 |publisher=United Future [/tpl]

Portions of the cabinet paper, and answers to questions posed by TechLiberty, were withheld including the venue for the April 2010 ACTA negotiations, the cabinet discussion paper on participation in ACTA, and all copies of draft negotiation texts, and all documents expressing New Zealand's negotiating position. This information was withheld under Official Information Act provisions allowing for withholding of information where it would prejudice the international relations of the Government of New Zealand, where it would affect the privacy of natural persons, where it was required to maintain the effective conduct of public affairs, and where withholding information was required to enable the government to carry on negotiations (including commercial and industrial negotiations).
In April 2010 a coalition of NZ organisations ran the PublicACTA event immediately prior to the negotiation round held in Wellington New Zealand. At the PublicACTA event participants drafted the Wellington Declaration. The Wellington Declaration was delivered to the New Zealand negotiators, who provided it to representatives from all the other negotiating countries. Following the Wellington negotiation round in April 2010 the text of ACTA was released publicly. This was the only time this occurred during the ACTA negotiations.

===United States===

Both the Bush administration and the Obama administration had rejected requests to make the text of ACTA public, with the White House saying that disclosure would cause "damage to the national security."[tpl]cite web |author=Declan McCullagh |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20004450-38.html |title=Google attorney slams ACTA copyright treaty |work=Cnet |date=7 May 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2012 [/tpl] In 2009, Knowledge Ecology International filed a Freedom of Information Act request in the United States, but their entire request was denied.

===EU Rapporteur's resignation===

Kader Arif, European parliament's rapporteur for ACTA, resigned from his position on 26 January 2012 denouncing the treaty "in the strongest possible manner" for having "no inclusion of civil society organizations, a lack of transparency from the start of the negotiations, repeated postponing of the signature of the text without an explanation being ever given, and exclusion of the EU Parliament's demands that were expressed on several occasions in the assembly," concluding with his intent to "send a strong signal and alert the public opinion about this unacceptable situation" and refusal to "take part in this masquerade."

===Poland===

On 23 January the Inspector General for the Protection of Personal Data of Poland recommended not to sign ACTA considering it to be a threat to the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution of Poland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvn24.pl/-1,1732379,0,1,giodo-acta-niebezpieczne-dla-konstytucyjnych-praw-i-wolnosci,wiadomosc.html|title=GIODO: ACTA niebezpieczne dla konstytucyjnych praw i wolności|trans_title=GIODO: ACTA a threat to constitutional rights and freedoms|date=2012-01-23|work=tvn24.pl after PAP|accessdate=13 June 2013[/tpl]

===Slovenia===

Helena Drnovšek-Zorko, Slovenian ambassador to Japan, issued a statement on 31 January 2012 expressing deep remorse for having signed the agreement. "I signed ACTA out of civic carelessness, because I did not pay enough attention. Quite simply, I did not clearly connect the agreement I had been instructed to sign with the agreement that, according to my own civic conviction, limits and withholds the freedom of engagement on the largest and most significant network in human history, and thus limits particularly the future of our children," she said.[tpl]cite web |url=http://metinalista.si/why-i-signed-acta/ |title=Why I signed ACTA |accessdate=4 February 2012 |author=Helena Drnovšek-Zorko |date=31 January 2012 |work=Metina lista |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65DCnzGnz |archivedate=4 February 2011[/tpl]
