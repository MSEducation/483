==Meaning==

When Joseph Rojas was asked about the meaning behind Finally Awake, he responded: "The message of this album is clear. We want to empower kids to stop looking to the media, to what the world tells them they have to be, to find identity. You donâ€™t have to be what everyone else tells you to. Be what you were created to be."MySpace.com - Seventh Day Slumber - SPRING HILL, TENNESSEE - Rock / Christian
