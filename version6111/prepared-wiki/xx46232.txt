[[List of theological demons]]

CATEGORIES: Demons, Lists of legendary creatures

This is a list of demons that appear in religion, theology, demonology, mythology, and folklore.
It is not a list of names of demons,
although some are listed by more than one name.
The list of fictional demons includes those from literary fiction with theological aspirations, such as Dante's Inferno.
Because numerous [tpl]c|lists of legendary creatures[/tpl] concern mythology, folklore, and folk fairy tales, much overlap may be expected.
Names of God, list of deities, and list of deities in fiction concern God and gods.
