La Vibora (The Viper) is a steel bobsled roller coaster at Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington, Texas, United States. 

==History==

The ride's cars do not run on conventional tubular rails, but instead travel through a winding half-pipe trough that emulates the experience of riding a bobsled. In keeping with the Texas location the theme was changed from an alpine bobsled ride to a snake theme. The name La Vibora translated to English is The Viper. 
It was first located at Six Flags Magic Mountain under the name Sarajevo Bobsleds in 1984, however, the ride was part of Six Flags' (now defunct) Ride Rotation Program, and the coaster was relocated to Six Flags Over Texas two years later, and opened as the Avalanche Bobsled in 1987. The ride was later renamed La Vibora and painted to resemble a snake to better match the theme of the Spain section of the park.
