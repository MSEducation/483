==Early life==

Menendez was born in New York City and raised in Miami. He is of Cuban descent.
As a boy growing up in Miami, Joe Menendez originally wanted to be a Disney animator. At age 7, he got his hands on his grandmother's Super 8 movie camera with the intent of photographing the hundreds of drawings he'd already sketched for what was going to be his first animated cartoon. But when he realized the camera wasn't equipped to shoot single frame, he started making live action films instead with his little brother and cousins. All through junior high and high school, Menendez made many short films on Super 8 and video.
Later while attending "Miami Dade College", Menendez made numerous student films on 16mm, shot a handful of music videos for local Miami bands, worked at Miami's Univision affiliate "WLTV-DT" Channel 23 in the Sports Department (where he learned to edit and be an ENG camera man) and also Miami's Jewish Federation Television, before dropping out of college and moving to Los Angeles in 1992 to become a director.

==Early career==

Once Menendez arrived in Los Angeles in the spring of 1992 with only $200 in his pocket, he worked a series of odd jobs: from ticket taker at 'Universal Studios Hollywood", to PA on the TV series "Star Search", while scrounging together whatever money he could to make many short films. Two years later, he'd managed to work his way up to became a promo producer and editor at the LA based "Fox Latin America" and in 1994, at the age of 24, Menendez landed his first professional writing job on a TV series called CASSANDRA for the then newly formed "FX (TV Channel)" which was an American adaption of a "Televisa" telenovela, but the series was never produced. However, it did lead to HBO commissioning Menendez in 1994 (on his 25th birthday no less) to write "Cinderella" for their animated series "Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child" (Menendez also wrote "The Twelve Dancing Princesses" in 1996 for the same HBO series).
With the money he was paid by HBO, Menendez made another short film which ultimately landed him his first professional gig directing over 20 reenactments for the syndicated reality TV series "Real Stories of the Highway Patrol" in 1995.
Menendez gathered $10,000 from his family, and made his feature film debut with the indie action thriller LORDS OF THE BARRIO http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1rqKH7oSDM (originally titled THE IMPOSTOR), which was shot in 1995 and 1996, but wasn't released on DVD until 2002 http://www.amazon.com/Lords-Barrio-Robert-Arevalo-II/dp/B00023BM6G
Meanwhile, Menendez continued directing television, only this time... in Spanish (something he never imagined doing).
From 1996 through 2000, Menendez worked almost exclusively in the Spanish TV world, directing multiple episodes for three different Columbia Tri-Star multi-camera half hours: "Los Beltran", VIVA VEGAS and SOLO EN AMERICA, which aired on the Telemundo Network. Menendez also wrote several episodes for "Los Beltran". Menendez went into half-hours after a three-year run on another Telemundo show, called PLACAS,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0232419/ where he directed 215 ten minute reenactments (which is the equivalent of about 23 feature films).
Then, in 2000 he directed his first of many episodes of "The Brothers Garcia" for Nickelodeon for which he won an Alma Award for OUTSTANDING DIRECTING IN A COMEDY in 2001.
In 2002, he made his second feature film, the indie drama, HUNTING OF MAN http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325591/ which Menendez edited, wrote and directed. It won BEST PICTURE at the 2003 "New York International Latino Film Festival" and the coveted FESTIVAL DIRECTOR AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE at the 2003 "Method Fest Independent Film Festival" where Menendez was also nominated for Best Director.
Between 2003 and 2005 Menendez was very busy in television:
He was a Staff Writer on the FOX sitcom, "Luis (TV series)", directed an episode of "Cuts" for the network formerly known as UPN, was a Consulting Producer on "The Playbook" for Spike TV, wrote two episodes for the PBS kids show "Dragon Tales", produced a reality TV series for "nuvoTV" called URBAN JUNGLE, and sold a pilot to "Nickelodeon" called COUSINS.
