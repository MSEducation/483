Only on February 26, 1973, during testimony before the United States House Committee on Appropriations, the U.S. military officially confirmed that they had been utilizing UAVs in Southeast Asia (Vietnam).Wagner p. 202  Over 5,000 U.S. airmen had been killed and over 1,000 more were either missing in action (MIA) or captured (prisoners of war/POW). The USAF 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing had flown approximately 3,435 UAV missions during the warWagner p. 200 & 212 at a cost of about 554 UAVs lost to all causes. In the words of USAF General George S. Brown, Commander, Air Force Systems Command, in 1972, "The only reason we need (UAVs) is that we don't want to needlessly expend the man in the cockpit."Wagner p. 208  Later that same year, General John C. Meyer, Commander in Chief, Strategic Air Command, stated, "we let the drone do the high-risk flying ... the loss rate is high, but we are willing to risk more of them ... ''they save lives!"
During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Soviet-supplied surface-to-air missile batteries in Egypt and Syria caused heavy damage to Israeli fighter jets. As a result, Israel developed the first UAV with real-time surveillance. The images and radar decoying provided by these UAVs helped Israel to completely neutralize the Syrian air defenses at the start of the 1982 Lebanon War, resulting in no pilots downed. The first time UAVs were used as proof-of-concept of super-agility post-stall controlled flight in combat flight simulations was with tailless, stealth technology-based, three-dimensional thrust vectoring flight control, jet steering UAVs in Israel in 1987.[tpl]cite book |first= Benjamin |last= Gal-Or |title= Vectored Propulsion, Supermaneuverability & Robot Aircraft |publisher= Springer Verlag |year= 1990 |isbn= 3-540-97161-0 [/tpl]
With the maturing and miniaturization of applicable technologies as seen in the 1980s and 1990s, interest in UAVs grew within the higher echelons of the U.S. military. In the 1990s, the U.S. Department of Defense gave a contract to U.S. corporation AAI Corporation of Maryland along with Israeli company Mazlat. The U.S. Navy bought the AAI Pioneer UAV that was jointly developed by American AAI Corporation and Israeli Mazlat, and this type of UAV is still in use. Many of these Pioneer and newly developed U.S. UAVs were used in the 1991 Gulf War. UAVs were seen to offer the possibility of cheaper, more capable fighting machines that could be used without risk to aircrews. Initial generations were primarily surveillance aircraft, but some were armed, such as the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, which utilized AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles. An armed UAV is known as an  unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV).
As a tool for search and rescue, UAVs can help find humans lost in the wilderness, trapped in collapsed buildings, or adrift at sea.
In February 2013, it was reported that UAVs were used by at least 50 countries, several of which made their own: for example, Iran, Israel and China.
As of 2008, the United States Air Force employed 5,331 UAVs, which is twice its number of manned planes. Out of these, the Predators are the most commendable. Unlike other UAVs, the Predator was armed with Hellfire missiles so that it can terminate the target that it locates (Carafano & Gudgel, 2007). This was done after Predators sighted Osama Bin Laden multiple times but could not do anything about it other than send back images. In addition, the Predator is capable of orchestrating attacks by pointing lasers at the targets (Singer, 2009b). This is important, as it puts a robot in a position to set off an attack. Their overall success is apparent because from June 2005 to June 2006 alone, Predators carried out 2,073 missions and participated in 242 separate raids (Singer, 2009a).
In contrast to the Predator, which is remotely piloted via satellites by pilots located 7,500 miles away, the Global Hawk operates virtually autonomously. The user merely hits the button for ‘take off’ and for ‘land’, while the UAV gets directions via GPS and reports back with a live feed. Global Hawks have the capability to fly from San Francisco and map out the entire state of Maine before having to return. In addition, some UAVs have become so small that they can be launched from one’s hand and maneuvered through the street. These UAVs, known as Ravens, are especially useful in urban areas, such as Iraq, in order to discover insurgents and potential ambushes the next block up (Carafano & Gudgel, 2007). UAVs are especially useful because they can fly for days at a time. According to Carafano & Gudgel, insurgents are loathe to stay in the open for more than a few minutes at a time for fear of UAVs locating them (2007).

==FAA designation [tpl]anchor|UAS[/tpl]==

In the United States, shortly after,[tpl]when|date=March 2014[/tpl] the Federal Aviation Administration have adopted the name unmanned aircraft (UA) to describe aircraft systems without a flight crew on board. More common names include UAV, drone, remotely piloted vehicle (RPV), remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), and remotely operated aircraft (ROA). These "limited-size" (as defined by the FAI) unmanned aircraft flown in the USA's National Airspace System, flown solely for recreation and sport purposes, such as models, are generally flown under the voluntary safety standards of the Academy of Model Aeronautics,Model aircraft.org the United States' national aeromodeling organization.  To operate a UA for non-recreational purposes in the United States, users must obtain a Certificate of Authorization (COA) to operate in national airspace.[tpl]cite web|title=FAA: Certificate of Authorization or Waiver (COA)|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/aaim/organizations/uas/coa/[/tpl]  At the moment, COAs require a public entity as a sponsor. For example, when BP needed to observe oil spills, they operated the Aeryon Scout UAVs under a COA granted to the University of Alaska Fairbanks.[tpl]cite web|title=Unmanned aircraft to assist oil spill response|url=http://www.aeryon.com/news/pressreleases/256-uafbpjuly2011.html[/tpl]  COAs have been granted for both land and shipborne operations.[tpl]cite web|title=Aeryon Scout™ Micro-UAV Provides Aerial Perspective for Ship-Based Wildlife Research Project in Bering Sea|url=http://www.aeryon.com/news/pressreleases/347-aeryon-scout-sealions-2012.html[/tpl]
As of August 2013, commercial unmanned aerial systemAhlers, Mike. 2013-11-07. FAA takes initial steps to introduce private drones in U.S. skies CNN. Retrieved 2013-12-03. (UAS) licenses were granted on a case-by-case basis, subject to approval by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). A Congressional mandate to integrate UASs into U.S. airspace protocols is forecast to grant FAA licenses more broadly as early as 2015, the agency expecting that five years after it unveils a regulatory framework for UASs weighing 55 pounds or less, there will be 7,500 such devices in the air.
On 6 March 2014, NTSB judge Patrick Geraghty found that the FAA had not followed the proper rulemaking procedures and therefore had no UAV regulations.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/faa-small-drones-ban-104393.html |title=Judge strikes down small drones ban |last1=ROBILLARD |first1=KEVIN |date=6 March 2014 |website=www.politico.com |publisher=POLITICO LLC |accessdate=6 March 2014[/tpl] The FAA will appeal the judgement.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/07/us-usa-aircraft-drones-idUSBREA261PY20140307 |title=U.S. FAA will appeal ruling on commercial drone use |last1=Krasny |first1=Ros |last2=Maler |first2=Sandra |date=7 March 2014 |website=www.reuters.com |publisher=Thomson Reuters |accessdate=7 March 2014[/tpl]
The term unmanned aircraft system (UAS) emphasizes the importance of other elements beyond an aircraft itself. A typical UAS consists of the following:
For example, the RQ-7 Shadow UAS consists of four UAs, two GCSs, one portable GCS, one Launcher, two Ground Data Terminals (GDTs), one portable GDT, and one Remote Video Terminal. Certain military units are also fielded with a maintenance support vehicle.
Because of this systemic approach, unmanned aircraft systems have not been included in the United States Munitions List Category VIII – Aircraft and Associated Equipment. Vice versa, the “Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems” are clearly mentioned at paragraph 121-16 Missile Technology Control Regime Annex of the United States Munitions List. More precisely, the Missile Technology Control Regime Annex levels rocket and unmanned aerial vehicle systems together.
The term UAS was since adopted by the United States Department of Defense (DOD) and the British Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
The term used previously for unmanned aircraft system was unmanned-aircraft vehicle system (UAVS).

==Classification==

UAVs typically fall into one of six functional categories (although multi-role airframe platforms are becoming more prevalent):
They can also be categorised in terms of range/altitude and the following has been advanced as relevant at such industry events as ParcAberporth Unmanned Systems forum:
The United States military employs a tier system for categorizing its UAVs.

===Classifications by the United States military===

The modern concept of U.S. military UAVs is to have the various aircraft systems work together in support of personnel on the ground. The integration scheme is described in terms of a "Tier" system and is used by military planners to designate the various individual aircraft elements in an overall usage plan for integrated operations. The Tiers do not refer to specific models of aircraft but rather roles for which various models and their manufacturers competed. The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Marine Corps each has its own tier system, and the two systems are themselves not integrated.

====U.S. Air Force tiers====

====U.S. Marine Corps tiers====

====U.S. Army tiers====

====Future Combat Systems (FCS) (U.S. Army) classes====

====Unmanned aircraft system====

An unmanned aircraft system (UAS) includes ground stations and other elements besides the actual aircraft. The term was first officially used by the FAA in early 2005 and subsequently adopted by DoD that same year in their Unmanned Aircraft System Roadmap 2005–2030.http://www.acq.osd.mil/usd/Roadmap%20Final2.pdf#search=%22Dod%20UAS%20Roadmap%202005%22[tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]  Many people have mistakenly used the term Unmanned Aerial System or Unmanned  Air Vehicle System, as these designations were in provisional use at one time or another.  The inclusion of the term aircraft emphasizes that regardless of the location of the pilot and flightcrew, the operations must comply with the same regulations and procedures as do those aircraft with the pilot and flightcrew on board.  The official acronym UAS is also used by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and other government aviation regulatory organizations.
The military role of unmanned aircraft systems is growing at unprecedented rates. In 2005, tactical- and theater-level unmanned aircraft alone had flown over 100,000 flight hours in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, in which they are organized under Task Force Liberty in Afghanistan and Task Force ODIN in Iraq. Rapid advances in technology are enabling more and more capability to be placed on smaller airframes, which is spurring a large increase in the number of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS) being deployed on the battlefield. The use of SUAS in combat is so new that no formal DoD wide reporting procedures have been established to track SUAS flight hours. As the capabilities grow for all types of UAS, nations continue to subsidize their research and development, leading to further advances and enabling them to perform a multitude of missions. UAS no longer only perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, although this still remains their predominant type. Their roles have expanded to areas including electronic attack, strike missions, suppression or destruction of enemy air defense, network node or communications relay, combat search and rescue, and derivations of these themes. These UAS range in cost from a few thousand dollars to tens of millions of dollars, with aircraft ranging from less than one pound to over 40,000 pounds.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
When the Obama administration announced in December 2009 the deployment of 30,000 new troops in Afghanistan, there was already an increase of attacks by unmanned Predator UAVs against Taliban and al-Qaeda militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan's tribal areas, of which one probably killed a key member of al-Qaeda. However, neither Osama bin Laden nor Ayman al-Zawahiri was the likely target, according to reports. According to a report of the New America Foundation, armed UAV strikes had dramatically increased under President Obama – even before his deployment decision. There were 43 such attacks between January and October 2009. The report draws on what it deems to be "credible" local and national media stories about the attacks. This can be compared to a total of 34 in all of 2008, which was President Bush's last full year in office. Between 2006 and 2009, UAV-launched missiles allegedly had killed between 750 and 1,000 people in Pakistan, according to the report. Of these, about 20 people were said to be leaders of al-Qaeda, Taliban, and associated groups. Overall, 66% to 68% of the people killed were militants, and 31% to 33% were civilians. U.S. officials disputed the percentage for civilians."Drone aircraft in a stepped-up war in Afghanistan and Pakistan", Iran design uav engine WWW.UAV.IR The U.S. Air Force has recently begun referring at least to larger UAS like Predator, Reaper, and Global Hawk as Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) to highlight the fact that these systems are always controlled by a human operator at some location.
However, artificial intelligence is advancing to the point where the aircraft are easily capable of taking off, landing, and flying themselves.  Then they simply have to be instructed as to their mission.  The military distinguishes between "man in the loop"(piloted) and "man on the loop" (supervised) systems, with "fully autonomous" (issued orders) growing organically from the second into a third category.  A.I. systems have been capable of making decisions and planning sequences of actions for decades; as of 2013, few fully autonomous systems have been constructed, but this is more a matter of convenience and technical implementation than of any fundamental barrier.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
To distinguish UAVs from missiles, a UAV is defined as a "powered, aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator, uses aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload".The Free Dictionary, accessed 19 November 2010 Therefore, cruise missiles are not considered UAVs because, like many other guided missiles, the vehicle itself is a weapon that is not reused, even though it is also unmanned and in some cases remotely guided.
As of January 2014, the U.S. military operates a large number of unmanned aerial systems: 7,362 RQ-11 Ravens; 990 AeroVironment Wasp IIIs; 1,137 AeroVironment RQ-20 Pumas; and 306 RQ-16 T-Hawk small UAS systems and 246 MQ-1 Predators and MQ-1C Grey Eagles; 126 MQ-9 Reapers; 491 RQ-7 Shadows; and 33 RQ-4 Global Hawk large systems.Pentagon Plans for Cuts to Drone Budgets - DoDBuzz.com, 2 January 2014

==Uses==

Beyond the military applications of UAVs with which "drones" became most associated, numerous civil aviation uses have been developed, including aerial surveying of crops, acrobatic aerial footage in  filmmaking, search and rescue operations, inspecting power lines and pipelines, and counting wildlife, delivering medical supplies to remote or otherwise inaccessible regions, with some manufacturers rebranding the technology as "unmanned aerial systems" (UASs) in preference over "drones."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/16/why-drone-makers-have-declared-war-on-the-word-drone/ |title=Why drone makers have declared war on the word ‘drone’ |last=Fung |first=Brian |date=August 16, 2013 |website=The Washington Post |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IwTScW2U |archivedate=August 17, 2103 [/tpl] Drones have also been used by animal-rights advocates to determine if illegal hunting is taking place, even on private property.

===Remote sensing===

UAV remote sensing functions include electromagnetic spectrum sensors, gamma ray sensors, biological sensors, and chemical sensors.  A UAV's electromagnetic sensors typically include visual spectrum, infrared, or near infrared cameras as well as radar systems. Other electromagnetic wave detectors such as microwave and ultraviolet spectrum sensors may also be used but are uncommon. Biological sensors are sensors capable of detecting the airborne presence of various microorganisms and other biological factors.  Chemical sensors use laser spectroscopy to analyze the concentrations of each element in the air.

===Commercial aerial surveillance===

Aerial surveillance of large areas is made possible with low cost UAV systems. Surveillance applications include livestock monitoring, wildfire mapping, pipeline security, home security, road patrol, and anti-piracy.  The trend for the use of UAV technology in commercial aerial surveillance is expanding rapidly with increased development of automated object detection approaches.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gaszczak|first=A|coauthors=T.P.

===Commercial and Motion Picture Filmmaking===

In both Europe and the United States, UAV videography is a legal gray area. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and their European equivalents have not issued formal regulations and guidelines surrounding drones in the private sector. Much like how the explosive growth of crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo has caused headaches for legislators, UAV technology has advanced too quickly for bureaucrats to handle.
The FAA is debating offering guidelines for drone operators in the private sector by 2015, and European regulators are meeting on February 9 to iron out rules for UAVs in EU airspace. Domestically, lobbyists are petitioning the agency to give wide leeway to the use of unmanned aircraft for commercial photography, videography, and surveillance purposes. At the same time, lobbyists for occupations that stand to lose business to drones such as commercial pilots are petitioning the FAA to restrict drone use as well.
Colin Guinn of DJI Innovations, a Texas-based retail UAV manufacturer, told Co.Create that FAA regulations generally permit hobbyist drone use when they are flown below 400 feet, and within the UAV operator’s line of sight. For commercial drone camerawork inside the United States, industry sources told us that use is largely at the de facto consent – or benign neglect – of local law enforcement. Use of UAVs for filmmaking is generally easier on large private lots or in rural and exurban areas with fewer space concerns. In certain localities such as Los Angeles and New York, authorities have actively interceded to shut down drone filmmaking efforts due to concerns driven by safety or terrorism.

===Sports===

Drones are starting to be used in sports photography and cinematography. For example, they were used in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi for filming skiing and snowboarding events.

===Scientific research===

Unmanned aircraft are especially useful in penetrating areas that may be too dangerous for manned aircraft. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) began utilizing the Aerosonde unmanned aircraft system in 2006 as a hurricane hunter. AAI Corporation subsidiary Aerosonde Pty Ltd. of Victoria, Australia, designs and manufactures the 35-pound system, which can fly into a hurricane and communicate near-real-time data directly to the National Hurricane Center in Florida. Beyond the standard barometric pressure and temperature data typically culled from manned hurricane hunters, the Aerosonde system provides measurements far closer to the water’s surface than previously captured. NASA later began using the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk for extended hurricane measurements.
Further applications for unmanned aircraft can be explored once solutions have been developed for their accommodation within national airspace, an issue currently under discussion by the Federal Aviation Administration. UAVSI, the UK manufacturer, also produces a variant of their Vigilant light UAS (20 kg) designed specifically for scientific research in severe climates, such as the Antarctic.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

===Armed attacks===

MQ-1 Predator UAVs armed with Hellfire missiles are increasingly used by the U.S. as platforms for hitting ground targets. Armed Predators were first used in late 2001 from bases in Pakistan and Uzbekistan, mostly aimed at assassinating high profile individuals (terrorist leaders, etc.) inside Afghanistan. Since then, there have been many reported cases of such attacks taking place in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia.Sauer, Frank/Schoernig Niklas, 2012: Killer drones: The ‘silver bullet’ of democratic warfare?, in: Security Dialogue 43 (4): 363–380, http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/43/4/363.abstract, last accessed September 1, 2012.  The advantage of using an unmanned vehicle rather than a manned aircraft in such cases is to avoid a diplomatic embarrassment should the aircraft be shot down and the pilots captured, since the bombings take place in countries deemed friendly and without the official permission of those countries.Fox NewsDefense Industry DailyMSNBCGlobe and Mail[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
A Predator based in a neighboring Arab country was used to kill suspected al-Qaeda terrorists in Yemen on November 3, 2002. This marked the first use of an armed Predator as an attack aircraft outside of a theater of war such as Afghanistan.Federation of American Scientists
The U.S. has claimed that the Predator strikes killed at least nine senior al-Qaeda leaders and dozens of lower-ranking operatives, depleting its operational tier in what U.S. officials described as the most serious disruption of al-Qaeda since 2001.  It was claimed that the Predator strikes took such a toll on al-Qaeda that militants began turning violently on one another out of confusion and distrust.

====Civilian casualties====

Questions have been raised about the accuracy of UAV-based missile strikes. In March 2009, The Guardian reported allegations that Israeli UAVs armed with missiles killed 48 Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip, including two small children in a field and a group of women and girls in an otherwise empty street.The Guardian, March 23, 2009.

===Search and rescue===

UAVs will likely play an increased role in search and rescue in the United States. This was demonstrated by the use of UAVs during the 2008 hurricanes that struck Louisiana and Texas. Micro UAVs, such as the Aeryon Scout, have been used to perform Search and Rescue activities on a smaller scale, such as the search for missing persons.[tpl]cite web|title=Police use drone helicopter in search|url=http://www.aeryon.com/news/inthenews/314-2012policesearch.html[/tpl] For example, Predators, operating between 18,000–29,000 feet above sea level, performed search and rescue and damage assessment. Payloads carried were an optical sensor, which is a daytime and infrared camera in particular, and a synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The Predator's SAR is a sophisticated all-weather sensor capable of providing photographic-like images through clouds, rain or fog, and in daytime or nighttime conditions, all in real-time. A concept of coherent change detection in SAR images allows for exceptional search and rescue ability: photos taken before and after the storm hits are compared, and a computer highlights areas of damage.AP Texas News[tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]2008 Search and Rescue Missions[tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]

===Archaeology===

In Peru archaeologists use drones to speed up survey work and protect sites from squatters, builders and miners. Small drones helped researchers produce three-dimensional models of Peruvian sites instead of the usual flat maps – and in days and weeks instead of months and years.[tpl]cite web|author=Reuters in Lima |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/25/peru-archaeologists-drones-ancient-ruins |title=Peru's archaeologists turn to drones to help protect and explore ancient ruins | World news |publisher=theguardian.com |accessdate=2013-08-27[/tpl]
Drones have replaced expensive and clumsy small planes, kites and helium balloons. Drones costing as little as £650 have proven useful. In 2013 drones have flown over at least six Peruvian archaeological sites, including the colonial Andean town Machu Llacta [tpl]convert|4000|m[/tpl] above sea level. The drones continue to have altitude problems in the Andes, leading to plans to make a drone blimp, employing open source software.
Jeffrey Quilter, an archaeologist with Harvard University said, "You can go up three metres and photograph a room, 300 metres and photograph a site, or you can go up 3,000 metres and photograph the entire valley."

===Future potential===

In the military sector, Predators and Reapers are tailor-made for counter­terrorism operations and in war zones in which the enemy lacks sufficient firepower to shoot them down, but are not designed to withstand antiaircraft defenses or air-to-air combat; in September 2013 the chief of the Air Combat Command stated that current UAVs were "useless in a contested environment” unless manned aircraft were put there to protect them. A 2012 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report indicated that in the future, UAVs may be able to perform a variety of tasks beyond their present roles in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and strikes; the CRS report listed resupply, combat search and rescue, aerial refueling, and air to air combat ("a more difficult future task") as possible future undertakings.[tpl]cite web|last=Gertler |first=Jeremiah |title=U.S. Unmanned Aerial Systems|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R42136.pdf | publisher=Federation of American Scientists website, publishing document of the Congressional Research Service |date=January 3, 2013 [/tpl] The U.S. Department of Defense's Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap FY2013-2038 foresees UAVs having a more important place in combat, recognizing that the near future will involve making sure the technology works at all, before exploiting their potential in the following decade.

==Design and development considerations==

UAV design and production is a global activity with manufacturers all across the world. The United States and Israel were initial pioneers in this technology, and U.S. manufacturers had a market share of over 60% in 2006, with U.S. market share due to increase by 5–10% through 2016."UAVs on the Rise." Dickerson, L. Aviation Week & Space Technology. January 15, 2007. Northrop Grumman and General Atomics are the dominant manufacturers in this industry on the strength of the Global Hawk and Predator/Mariner systems. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Israeli companies were behind 41% of all UAVs exported in 2001-2011.“Israel – an unmanned air systems (UAS) super power”. Defense Update. The European market share represented 4% of global revenue in 2006.
In December 2013 the Federal Aviation Administration announced its selections six states that will host test sites emphasizing respective research goals: Alaska (sites with a wide variety of climates), Nevada (formulating standards for air traffic control and UAV operators), New York (integrating UAVs into congested airspace), North Dakota (human impact; use in temperate climates), Texas (safety requirements and airworthiness testing), and Virginia (assessing operational and technical risk).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25552825 |title=US announces six drone test sites |date=30 December 2013 |accessdate=31 December 2013 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl]

Development costs for American military UAVs, as with most military programs, have tended to overrun their initial estimates.  This is mostly due to changes in requirements during development and a failure to leverage UAV development programs over multiple armed services. This has caused United States Navy UAV programs to increase in cost from 0% to 5%, while United States Air Force UAV programs have increased from 60% to 284%.Defense Acquisitions: Opportunities Exist to Achieve Greater Commonality and Efficiencies among Unmanned Aircraft Systems

===Degree of autonomy===

Early UAVs used during the Vietnam War captured video that was recorded to film or tape on the aircraft. These aircraft often flew either in a straight line or in preset circles collecting video until they ran out of fuel and landed. After landing, the film was recovered for analysis. Because of the simple, repetitive nature of these operations, the aircraft were often called "drones". As new radio control systems became available, UAVs were often remote controlled, and the term "remotely piloted vehicle" came into vogue. Today's UAVs often combine remote control and computerized automation. More sophisticated versions may have built-in control or guidance systems to perform low-level human pilot duties, such as speed and flight-path stabilization, and simple scripted navigation functions, such as waypoint following. In news and other discussions, the term "drone" is still often mistakenly used to refer to these more sophisticated aircraft.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
From this perspective, most early UAVs were not autonomous at all. In fact, the field of air-vehicle autonomy is a recently emerging field, largely driven by the military to develop battle-ready technology.[tpl]cite book| author=Wahren, K., Cowling, I., Patel, Y., Smith, P., Breckon, T.P.| chapter=Development of a Two-Tier Unmanned Air System for the MoD Grand Challenge| title=Proc. 24th International Conference on Unmanned Air Vehicle Systems|date=March 2009| pages=13.1–13.9| accessdate=5 November 2013[/tpl] Compared to the manufacturing of UAV flight hardware, the market for autonomy technology is fairly immature and undeveloped.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Autonomy technology that is important to UAV development falls under the following categories:
Autonomy is commonly defined as the ability to make decisions without human intervention. To that end, the goal of autonomy is to teach machines to be "smart" and act more like humans. The keen observer may associate this with the developments in the field of artificial intelligence made popular in the 1980s and 1990s, such as expert systems, neural networks, machine learning, natural language processing, and vision. However, the mode of technological development in the field of autonomy has mostly followed a bottom-up approach, such as hierarchical control systems,Shim, D. H, Kim, H. J., Sastry, S., Hierarchical Control System Synthesis for Rotorcraft-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. and recent advances have been largely driven by the practitioners in the field of control science, not computer science.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] Similarly, autonomy has been and probably will continue to be considered an extension of the controls field.
To some extent, the ultimate goal in the development of autonomy technology is to replace the human pilot. It remains to be seen whether future developments of autonomy technology, the perception of the technology, and, most importantly, the political climate surrounding the use of such technology will limit the development and utility of autonomy for UAV applications. Also as a result of this, synthetic vision for piloting has not caught on in the UAV arena as it did with manned aircraft. NASA utilized synthetic vision for test pilots on the HiMAT program in the early 1980s (see photo), but the advent of more autonomous UAV autopilots greatly reduced the need for this technology.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Interoperable UAV technologies became essential as systems proved their mettle in military operations, taking on tasks too challenging or dangerous for troops. NATO addressed the need for commonality through STANAG (Standardization Agreement) 4586. According to a NATO press release, the agreement began the ratification process in 1992. Its goal was to allow allied nations to easily share information obtained from unmanned aircraft through common ground control station technology. Aircraft that adhere to the STANAG 4586 protocol are equipped to translate information into standardized message formats; likewise, information received from other compliant aircraft can be transferred into vehicle-specific messaging formats for seamless interoperability. Amendments have since been made to the original agreement based on expert feedback from the field and an industry panel known as the Custodian Support Team. Edition Two of STANAG 4586 is currently under review. There are many systems available today that are developed in accordance with STANAG 4586, including products by industry leaders such as AAI Corporation, CDL Systems, and Raytheon, all three of which are members of the Custodian Support Team for this protocol.

===Endurance===

Because UAVs are not burdened with the physiological limitations of human pilots, they can be designed for maximized on-station times. The maximum flight duration of unmanned aerial vehicles varies widely. Internal combustion engine aircraft endurance depends strongly on the percentage of fuel burned as a fraction of total weight (the Breguet endurance equation) and so is largely independent of aircraft size.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Because of the small size, weight, very low vibration and high power to weight ratio, Wankel rotary engines are increasingly being used in UAV aircraft.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rotarynews.com/node/view/1020 |title=New rotary takes flight in India |publisher=RotaryNews.com |accessdate=2014-02-06[/tpl] The engine is approximately one third of the size and weight of a piston engine of equivalent power output, which offers significant advantages for UAV aircraft.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rotronuav.com/ |title=Rotron Advanced Rotary Engines for UAV, VTOL & Military Applications |publisher=Rotronuav.com |accessdate=2014-02-06[/tpl] Additionally: the engine rotors cannot seize, since rotor casings expand more than rotors; the engine is not susceptible to shock-cooling during descent; it does not require an enriched mixture for cooling at high power and having no reciprocating parts, there is less vulnerability to damage when the engines revolves higher than the designed maximum running operation. The attributes of the Wankel engine transpire into less fuel usage in UAVs giving greater range or a higher payload.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rotronuav.com/capability/ |title=Rotron Rotary Engine Operational Capabilities |publisher=Rotronuav.com |accessdate=2014-02-06[/tpl]

This approach is advocated by Jordin Kare and Thomas Nugent.
One of the major problems with UAVs is the lack of inflight refueling capability. In 2012, the US Air Force was promoting research that should end in an inflight UAV refueling capability.Northrop Grumman Planning First UAV-to-UAV Aerial Refueling A UAV-UAV simulated refuelling flight using two Global Hawks was achieved in 2012.Kwan, Carissa (5 October 2012)   Two Global Hawk Unmanned Aircraft Fly in Close Formation, Move AHR Program Closer to Autonomous Aerial Refueling Northrop Grumman multimedia release, Retrieved 1 April 2013
One of the uses for a high endurance UAV would be to "stare" at the battlefield for a long period of time to produce a record of events that could then be played backwards to track where improvised explosive devices (IEDs) came from.  Air Force Chief of Staff John P. Jumper started a program to create these persistent UAVs, but this was stopped once he was replaced.[tpl]YouTube|ojGcX2H81NQ|counter_ied_backtracking.mpg[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]

===Detect and avoid===

The U.K.'s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has stated that it will require non-military drones larger than 20 kg to be able to automatically sense other aircraft and steer to avoid them, a technology still missing in civilian UAVs as of 2012.

===Hardening of the control stations===

Given the increasing military use of cyber attacks against Microsoft software, the United States Armed Forces have moved towards Linux ground control software.Thomson, Iain. "US Navy buys Linux to guide drone fleet." The Register, 8 June 2012.Leyden, John. "US killer spy drone controls switch to Linux." The Register, 12 January 2012.

===Buddy attacks===

The USAF said in 2012 that it will focus development of UAVs to be collaboratively networked with manned aircraft in "buddy attacks," while continuing to be able to fly as standalone systems.Majumdar, Dave. "Anti-access/area denial challenges give manned aircraft edge over UAVs." Flight Global, 25 July 2012.

==Existing UAV systems==

UAVs have been developed and deployed by many countries around the world. For a list of models by country, see: List of unmanned aerial vehicles.  The use of unmanned aerial systems, however, is not limited to state powers: non-state actors can also build, buy and operate these combat vehicles.Singer, Peter W. "A Revolution Once More: Unmanned Systems and the Middle East", The Brookings Institution, November 2009.
The export of UAVs or technology capable of carrying a 500 kg payload at least 300 km is restricted in many countries by the Missile Technology Control Regime.  At the center of the American military's continued UAV research is the MQ-X, which builds upon the capabilities of the Reaper and Predator UAVs. As currently conceived, the MQ-X would be a stealthier and faster fighter-plane sized UAV capable of any number of missions: high-performance surveillance; attack options, including retractable cannons and bomb or missile payloads; and cargo capacity.Singer, Peter W. "How the US Military Can Win the Robotic Revolution", The Brookings Institution, 17 May 2010.
China has exhibited some UAV designs, but its ability to operate them is limited by the lack of high endurance domestic engines, satellite infrastructure, and operational experience.Axe, David. "US Drones Trump China Theatrics" The Diplomat, 7 February 2011.

==Historical events involving UAVs==

==Domestic aerial surveillance==

Although UAVs are today most commonly associated with military actions, UAVs are increasingly used by civilian government agencies, businesses, and private individuals. In the United States, for example, government agencies use UAVs such as the RQ-9 Reaper to patrol the nation's borders, scout property, and locate fugitives.[tpl]cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304331204577354331959335276.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | first1=Andy | last1=Pasztor | first2=John | last2=Emshwiller | title=Drone Use Takes Off on the Home Front | date=April 21, 2012[/tpl] One of the first authorized for domestic usage was the ShadowHawk UAV in service in Montgomery County, Texas, and is being used by their SWAT and emergency management offices.[tpl]cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204319004577088891361782010.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Ana | last=Campoy | title=The Law's New Eye in the Sky | date=December 13, 2011[/tpl]

====Sydney Harbour Bridge collision====

On 2 October 2013 a UAV collided with Sydney Harbour Bridge.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/mystery-drone-collides-with-sydney-harbour-bridge-20131004-2uzks.html|title=Mystery drone collides with Sydney Harbour Bridge|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|last=Kontominas|first=Bellinda|date=4 October 2013|accessdate=5 October 2013[/tpl] The craft, which carried a camera, was found about 10pm near a southern pylon of the bridge on a rail line.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/i-dont-know-whether-its-a-bomb-or-not-train-driver-flummoxed-after-drone-hits-sydney-harbour-bridge-20131126-2y76m.html|title='I don't know whether it's a bomb or not': Train driver flummoxed after drone hits Sydney Harbour Bridge|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|last=Cosier|first=Colin|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=27 November 2013[/tpl] Although it was found the day before the International Navy Fleet Review, police believed there was no connection with the event. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority started an investigation and anti-terrorism officers were alerted, though police said they didn't believe it was suspicious and was for recreational use. A CASA spokesman said that they had been contacted by the New South Wales Police Force. He added that those operating remotely piloted aircraft should keep them at least 30m away from structures, buildings and people, to check with the local council where they could be used and that the airspace around the bridge was restricted for all aircraft, including small ones.
The craft turned out to belong to Edward Prescott, who had lost control of it while testing it and thought it was lost in the harbour. He said that he never intended it to fly into the bridge and later discovered that his craft had been in the news. He said that he contacted the aviation authorities and Sydney police as soon as he heard of the news. The New South Wales police stated that the matter had been investigated and deemed not suspicious and that the police team managing the International Fleet Review had been notified, but that police transport command had handled the matter. The police returned the craft to Mr Prescott. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority has completed a review of the incident but as of late November 2013 has not decided what action, if any, to take. Mr Prescott was in Sydney as part of the support crew for the Australian tour of Rihanna.

====Endure Batavia drone incident====

In April 2014 triathlete Raija Ogden was injured in an incident in Geraldton, Western Australia.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/08/air-safety-triathlete-struck-drone|title=Air safety investigation into drone incident with triathlete|publisher=The Guardian|date=8 April 2014|accessdate=27 April 2014|last=Safi|first=Michael[/tpl] She claimed that she was injured when the drone collided with her during the race. Warren Abrahams, the owner of the UAV denied that it had collided with her and that she had been injured when she was frightened by the falling UAV and tripped. Raija Ogden disputed these claims saying that "I have lacerations on my head from the drone and the ambulance crew took a piece of propeller from my head". Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson said that evidence warranted an investigation.
Warren Abrahams claimed that video footage of the event supported his claims. In a radio interview he suggested that his drone had been hacked by someone who had taken control of it, but when contacted by Guardian Australia, he seemed to withdraw the statement.

===Belgium===

In 2013, The Flemish Research Institute for Nature and Forest and the Flanders Marine Institute planned to use a UAV with a camera and a detection system that automatically recognizes different types of vegetation, trees and individual plants in order to make regular assessments of the biodiversity of the Flemish terrain.

Transport Canada spokesman Rod Nelson said his department was investigating with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to identify the operator. Model Aeronautics Association of Canada board of directors member Steve Hughes said that pilots like the one in question were damaging the hobby of flying model aircraft.
In March 2014 a remote-controlled helicopter was reported by the crew of a Boeing 777 flying 30 miles from their craft at the same airport, though nothing connects the two incidents.

The IAA policy is that unmanned aerial systems may not be flown without the operator receiving a specific permission from the IAA. Where such a craft is to be used for commercial work, the operator must apply for an aerial work permission from the IAA. Flying UAS outside the direct, unaided line of sight of the operator is not allowed for safety reasons. It is not permitted to use vision-enhancing systems, such as first-person view.

UAVs can be powerful surveillance tools by carrying camera systems capable of license plate scanning and thermal imaging as well as radio equipment and other sensors.[tpl]cite web |author=Harley Geiger | url=http://www.cdt.org/blogs/harley-geiger/2112drones-are-coming | title=The Drones Are Coming |publisher=Center for Democracy & Technology | date=2011-12-21 | accessdate= 2012-01-17[/tpl] The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a Freedom of Information Act request on January 10, 2012 against the Federal Aviation Administration.[tpl]cite web | author=Jennifer Lynch | url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/01/drones-are-watching-you |title=Drones are Watching You |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |date=2012-01-10 | accessdate= 2012-06-19[/tpl] As a result of the request, the FAA released a list of the names of all public and private entities that have applied for authorizations to fly UAVs domestically.[tpl]cite web | author=Jennifer Lynch | url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/faa-releases-its-list-drone-certificates-leaves-many-questions-unanswered |title=FAA Releases Lists of Drone Certificates – Many Questions Left Unanswered |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation | date=2012-04-19 | accessdate= 2012-06-19[/tpl] Some of these government licenses belong to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a component of the Department of Homeland Security.

Individuals in the United States have few legal privacy protections from aerial surveillance conducted through UAVs. In Florida v. Riley, the United States Supreme Court held that individuals do not have the right to privacy from police observation from public airspace. The weakness of legal protection from UAV surveillance have led to calls from civil liberties advocacy groups for the U.S. government to issue laws and regulations that establish both privacy protections and greater transparency regarding the use of UAVs to gather information about individuals. As an example, the ACLU has warned of a "nightmare scenario" in the future where the police might be able, with computer technology, to combine mobile phone tracking with video data and build up a database of people's routine daily movements.

While Congress rapidly moves ahead to authorize further use of domestic UAVs, many remain skeptical regarding privacy concerns. Some privacy scholars argue that the domestic use of UAVs for surveillance will ultimately benefit privacy by encouraging society to demand greater privacy rights.

FBI Director Robert Mueller testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the 19th of June 2013 that the FBI owns and uses UAVs for the purposes of "surveillance".[tpl]cite news|last=Kravets|first=David|title=FBI Admits It Surveils U.S. With Drones|url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/06/fbi-drones/|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=Wired|date=06.19.13 12:04 PM|month=June|year=2013|quote=FBI Director Robert Mueller said today the bureau was surveiling the United States with drones.

The FBI is not alone in monitoring the U.S. with drones.[/tpl]

====Non-police uses====

Law enforcement and other government agencies are not the only entities that use UAVs. Private citizens and media organizations use UAVs as well for the purposes of surveillance, recreation, or personal land assessment. Some farming initiatives utilize UAVs for crop spraying, as they are often cheaper than a full-sized helicopter. Occupy Wall Street journalist Tim Pool uses what he calls an Occucopter for  live feed coverage of Occupy movement events. The "occucopter" is an inexpensive radio controlled quadcopter with cameras attached and controllable by  Android devices or iOS. In February 2012, an animal rights group used a MikroKopter hexacopter to film hunters shooting pigeons in South Carolina. The hunters then shot the UAV down.Keneally, Meghan (20 February 2012) Hunters take aim at an animal rights group's video drone The Daily Mail, retrieved 5 February 2013 UAVs also have been shown to have many other civilian uses, such as agriculture, Hollywood, and in the construction industry.Drone Home Feb. 11, 2013 Time Falkor Systems, a pioneer in the consumer use of UAV technology, has targeted extreme sports photography and video for drone use, focusing on skiing and base-jumping activities.http://www.livescience.com/28137-cool-uses-for-drones.html

==UAV operations==

In the U.S., thousands of civilian UAV operators work for contractors, piloting and maintaining UAVs.

==UAVs in popular culture==

==Public opinion==

In February 2013, Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll found that 48% of American voters believe it is "illegal for the U.S. government to target its own citizens living abroad with drone attacks. Just 24% say that it's legal."Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind. (February 7, 2013) Public Say It's Illegal to Target Americans Abroad as Some Question CIA Drone Attacks Press release. "The public clearly makes an assumption very different from that of the Obama administration or Mr. Brennan: the public thinks targeting American citizens abroad is out of bounds," Peter Woolley, founding director of PublicMind and professor of political science at FDU, said to CNN.CNN Political Ticker blog. (February 7, 2013) Poll: Americans back drone attacks, but not on U.S. citizens abroad
In the same poll, however, by a wide six-to-one margin (75% vs.13%), voters approved of the U.S. military using UAVs to carry out attacks abroad “on people and other targets deemed a threat to the U.S.” Republicans, men, and whites approve more strongly than Democrats, women, and non-whites, but approval is robust in all demographic categories. Voters also approve of the CIA using UAVs to carry out attacks abroad by a strong three-to-one margin (65% vs. 21%), but this approval is significantly less than approval for the U.S. military carrying out such attacks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2013/drone/ |title=Respondents Question CIA Drone Attacks |publisher=Publicmind.fdu.edu |accessdate=2013-08-27[/tpl]
Despite this broad-based public support, there are a number of vocal critics of the increasing use of UAVs to track and kill terrorists and militants. A major criticism of drone strikes is that they result in excessive collateral damage. David Kilcullen and Andrew Exum wrote in the New York Times that "according to Pakistani sources, they have also killed some 700 civilians. This is 50 civilians for every militant killed, a hit rate of 2 percent." Other studies have put the civilian casualty rate anywhere between 4 and 35 percent.[tpl]cite news|last=Shane|first=Scott|title=C.I.A. Is Disputed on Civilian Toll in Drone Strikes|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/world/asia/12drones.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 2, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 11, 2011[/tpl] It is difficult to reconcile these figures because the drone strikes are often in areas that are inaccessible to independent observers and the data includes reports by local officials and local media, neither of whom are reliable sources. Critics also fear that by making killing seem clean and safe, so-called surgical UAV strikes will allow the United States to remain in a perpetual state of war. However, others maintain that drones "allow for a much closer review and much more selective targeting process than do other instruments of warfare" and are subject to Congressional oversight.[tpl]cite journal|last=Etzioni|first=Amitai|title=The Great Drone Debate|journal=Military Review|date=March–April 2013|url=http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2013/03/Etzioni_DroneDebate.pdf[/tpl] Like any military technology, armed UAVs will kill people, combatants and innocents alike, thus "the main turning point concerns the question of whether we should go to war at all."

==Morality==

The “unmanned” aspect of UAVs is primarily what sets them apart from manned aircraft. This aspect also raises certain moral concerns. Some believe that the asymmetry of fighting humans with machines that are controlled from a safe distance lacks integrity and honor that was once valued during warfare. Others feel that if such technology is available, then there is a moral duty to employ it in order to save as many lives as possible.[tpl]cite news|last=Carroll|first=Rory|title=The philosopher making the moral case for US drones|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/02/philosopher-moral-case-drones|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 August 2012[/tpl] Another potential moral issue with UAVs is that because they do not allow for pilot casualties, some fear that they will be used more frivolously, and that human lives affected by UAV-based strikes will not be regarded with as much consideration as with manned aerial attacks.

===Civilian death===

Some critics emphasize that the use of drones promotes not only a physical, but emotional disengagement from on the ground combat, for example, which is historically the foundation of military combat. This has a number of implications. Individuals taking on a critique of drone use challenge the supposed sense of morality and ethics that is taken on when justifying drone use. The evolution of new types of warfare creates a growing detachment from direct combat via the increased use of drones, and distances combatants from the consequences of their actions. Therefore, the use of drones is often associated with the idea that it is more ethical; the minimization of U.S. casualties due to this distancing, for example, is another reason drone use is increasingly looked at as an improved technique of war. Critics argue this detachment is failing to address the reality of innocent civilians being killed through this war strategy.

===Technology===

Drone use can be understood as a manifestation and extension of the technological revolution in military affairs (RMA) discourse. As Eric Blanchard indicates in his article “The Technoscience Question in Feminist International Relations”, taken from J. Ann Tickner’s Feminism in International Relations, the hegemonic masculinities in the American military influenced the development of technology as it became more prevalent following the Second World War.[tpl]cite book|last=Blanchard|first=Eric|title=Feminism and International Relations: Conversations about the Past, Present and Future|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=152|authorlink=The Technoscience Question in Feminist International Relations: Unmanning the U.S. War on Terror|editor=J. Ann Tickner and Laura Sjoberg|chapter=The Technoscience Question in Feminist International Relations: Unmanning the U.S. War on Terror[/tpl] The entrenchment of this masculinity is even apparent in the present day, as women quite often have inferior positions to men in technology research, development, and use. These concerns are not only limited to drone use; cyborgs are also a manifestation of technology and new wars developing from RMA. Cristina Masters notes in “Cyborg Soldiers and Militarised Masculinities” that these new types of technologies create new ways in which soldiers are conceptualized. Traditionally, soldiers were considered to be physical combatants, whereas now, technology in warfare blurs the distinction between autonomous users and who is representative of a soldier.[tpl]cite book|last=Masters|first=Cristina|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=183|authorlink=Cyborg Soldiers and Militarised Masculinities|editor=Laura J. Shepherd[/tpl]

===Examples===

One of the more mobilized groups engaged in this dialogue is Code Pink, a grassroots peace movement concerned with global social justice.  This is a group primarily composed of women and led by women, seeking to mobilize against the United States military and the particular wars or battle campaigns they associate themselves with, either economically or militarily.[tpl]cite book|last=Blanchard|first=Eric|title=Feminism and International Relations: Conversations about the Past, Present and Future|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=147|authorlink=The Technoscience Question in Feminist International Relations: Unmanning the U.S. War on Terror|editor=J. Ann Tickner and Laura Sjoberg|chapter=The Technoscience Question in Feminist International Relations: Unmanning the U.S. War on Terror[/tpl] For example, Code Pink has facilitated a number of summits and campaigns against drones internationally and domestically.

==Legality==

A confidential Justice Department memo concludes that the U.S. government can order the killing of American citizens if they are believed to be “senior operational leaders” of Al-Qaeda or “an associated force” – even if there is no intelligence indicating they are engaged in an active plot to attack the U.S.[tpl]cite web|last=Isikoff|first=Michael|title=Justice Department memo reveals legal case for drone strikes on Americans|url=http://openchannel.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/04/16843014-justice-department-memo-reveals-legal-case-for-drone-strikes-on-americans?lite|accessdate=2013[/tpl] The secrecy surrounding such strikes is quickly emerging as a central issue in the hearing of White House counterterrorism adviser John O. Brennan, a key architect of the UAV campaign, to be CIA director. Brennan was the first administration official to publicly acknowledge UAV-based strikes in a speech last year, calling them “consistent with the inherent right of self-defense.” In a separate talk at the Northwestern University Law School, Attorney General Eric Holder specifically endorsed the constitutionality of targeted killings of Americans, saying they could be justified if government officials determine that the target poses “an imminent threat of violent attack.” But the confidential Justice Department “white paper” introduces a more expansive definition of self-defense or imminent attack than described by Brennan or Holder in their public speeches  It refers, for example, to what it calls a “broader concept of imminence” than actual intelligence about any ongoing plot against the U.S. homeland. "The condition that an operational leader presents an ‘imminent’ threat of violent attack against the United States does not require the United States to have clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future,” the memo states. Instead, an “informed, high-level” official of the U.S. government may determine that the targeted American has been “recently” involved in “activities” posing a threat of a violent attack and “there is no evidence suggesting that he has renounced or abandoned such activities.” (The memo does not define “recently” or “activities.”)
As in Holder’s speech, the confidential memo lays out a three-part test that would make targeted killings of American lawful: in addition to the suspect being an imminent threat, capture of the target must be “infeasible, and the strike must be conducted according to “laws of war principles.” But the memo elaborates on some of these factors in ways that go beyond what the attorney general said publicly. For example, it states that U.S. officials may consider whether an attempted capture of a suspect would pose an “undue risk” to U.S. personnel involved in such an operation. If so, U.S. officials could determine that the capture operation of the targeted American would not be feasible, making it lawful for the U.S. government to order a killing instead, the memo concludes. The undated memo is entitled “Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of Al Qaeda or An Associated Force.”  It was provided to members of the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary committees in June 2013 by administration officials on the condition that it be kept confidential and not discussed publicly. Although not an official legal memo, the white paper was represented by administration officials as a policy document that closely mirrors the arguments of classified memos on targeted killings by the Justice Department’s  Office of Legal Counsel, which provides authoritative legal advice to the president and all executive branch agencies. The administration has refused to turn over to Congress or release those memos publicly or to even publicly confirm their existence. A source with access to the white paper, which is not classified, provided a copy to NBC News.
The white paper also includes a more extensive discussion of why targeted strikes against Americans does not violate constitutional protections afforded to American citizens as well as a U.S. law that criminalizes the killing of U.S. nationals overseas. It also discusses why such targeted killings would not be a war crime or violate a U.S. executive order banning assassinations. “A lawful killing in self-defense is not an assassination,” the white paper reads. “In the Department’s view, a lethal operation conducted against a U.S. citizen whose conduct poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States would be a legitimate act of national self-defense that would not violate the assassination ban. Similarly, the use of lethal force, consistent with the laws of war, against an individual who is a legitimate military target would be lawful and would not violate the assassination ban.”
