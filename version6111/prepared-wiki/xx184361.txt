[[List of Sri Lankan news sites]]

CATEGORIES: Sri Lankan websites, Lists of websites

The following is a list of text based (as opposed to webcasts, etc.) English medium websites that provide current news directly related to Sri Lanka.
The list consists of two sections. The first section is a collection of websites directly operated by Sri Lankan organizations and/or people or organizations that have a direct interest in Sri Lanka. Many of them own printed newspapers or electronic media that primarily target the Sri Lankan populatation. However, this section has web sites such as BBC Sinhala, which is operated by the BBC in the United Kingdom but directly targets Sri Lankans. The visitors of these sites are extremely likely to read news about Sri Lanka in the home pages themselves of these sites.
The second section of the list is a collection of web sites which are primarily operated by non Sri Lankan entities but when something significant happens in Sri Lanka, these sites are likely to report that incident.
This list does not contain Sri Lankan news sites such as Divaina, Lankadeeepa, Lakbima, Rivira, LankaComments, Lanka, Irudina, Ethalaya, Mirisa, Lanka-E-Puwath, Sinhala Sangarawa, Virakesari, Thinakural, Uthayan, Sudar Oli, etc. because their content is not in English. Also the sites such as LankaWeb, etc. are not included because they primarily provide views rather than news.
