where the constants of proportionality depend on conventions.
It is common to describe a patch of this solution as an expanding universe of the FLRW form where the scale factor is given by[tpl]cite book|last=Adler|first=Ronald|title=Introduction to General Relativity|year=1965|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=NY|pages=468|coauthors=Maurice Bazin;Menahem Schiffer[/tpl]

==Potential for the Universe==

Because our Universe entered the Dark Energy Dominated Era a few billion years ago, our universe is probably[tpl]why|date=April 2013[/tpl] approaching a de Sitter universe in the infinite future. If the current acceleration of our universe is due to a cosmological constant then as the universe continues to expand all of the matter and radiation will be diluted. Eventually there will be almost nothing left but the cosmological constant, and our universe will have become a de Sitter universe. This is called the "Big Empty".

==Relative expansion==

[tpl]Weasel|section|[tpl]subst:April 2011[/tpl]|date=April 2011[/tpl]
The exponential expansion of the scale factor means that the physical distance between any two non-accelerating observers will eventually be growing faster than the speed of light. At this point those two observers will no longer be able to make contact. Therefore any observer in a de Sitter universe would see event horizons beyond which that observer can never see nor learn any information. If our universe is approaching a de Sitter universe then eventually we will not be able to observe any galaxies other than our own Milky Way (and any others in the gravitationally bound Local Group, assuming they were to somehow survive to that time without merging).

==Modelling cosmic inflation==

Another application of de Sitter space is in the early universe during cosmic inflation. Many inflationary models are approximately de Sitter space and can be modelled by giving the Hubble parameter a mild time dependence. For simplicity, some calculations involving inflation in the early universe can be performed in de Sitter space rather than a more realistic inflationary universe. By using the de Sitter universe instead, where the expansion is truly exponential, there are many simplifications.
