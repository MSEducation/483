CATEGORIES: Subcultures

The indie design movement is made up of independent designers, artists and craftspeople who design and make a wide array of products without being part of large, industrialized businesses.
They are supported by shoppers who are seeking niche and often handmade products as opposed to those mass-produced by corporations. Such products may include jewellery and other accessories, ceramics, clothing, glass, metalwork, furniture, cosmetics, and art.
