==Navy==

The Bolivian Naval Force (Fuerza Naval Boliviana in  Spanish), formerly Bolivian Navy (Armada Boliviana) is a naval force about 5,000 strong in 2008.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/28/bolivia | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Bolivia's landlocked sailors pine for the high seas | first=Rory | last=Carroll | date=28 August 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl] Although Bolivia has been landlocked since the War of the Pacific in 1879, Bolivia established a River and Lake Force (Fuerza Fluvial y Lacustre) in January 1963 under the Ministry of National Defense. It consisted of four boats supplied from the United States and 1,800 personnel recruited largely from the army. Bolivia's naval force was renamed the Bolivian Naval Force (Fuerza Naval Boliviana) in January 1966, but it also has been called the Bolivian Navy (Armada Boliviana). It became a separate branch of the armed forces in 1963. Bolivia has large rivers that are tributaries to the Amazon which are patrolled to prevent smuggling and drug trafficking.  There is also a Bolivian Naval presence on Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable lake in the world, across which runs along the Peruvian frontier.

This is still a sore point for Bolivia, influencing many modern-day political actions and trade decisions.

===Districts===

The Navy is organized into ten naval districts, with flotilla headquarters in Guaqui, Guayaramerín, Puerto Suárez, Riberalta, and San Pedro de Tiquina, and bases in Puerto Busch, Puerto Horquilla, Puerto Villarroel, Trinidad, and Rurrenabaque.
Naval vessels include several dozen boats, dozen or more of which are for riverine patrol, including the piranias, and riders, which are powerful river boats. In addition, Bolivia has several seagoing vessels, including the Santa Cruz de la Sierra (PR-51), and several flagged ships that sail with the permission of the "Capitanias Navales" Naval Registration Office. The Libertador Simón Bolívar, a ship acquired from Venezuela, use to navigate from its home port in Rosario, Argentina on the River Paraná. In 1993, the Navy was formally renamed the Naval Force (Fuerza Naval) and moved with the Bolivian Army under a single military authority.
Most of the officers are often educated in the Naval Academy where they graduate with a BS in Military and Naval Science, diploma accredited by the Military University and then they do other studies at the bachelor's degree and master's level. Argentina has their Naval Military Group in Bolivia advising at the highest level in naval strategy and tactics. Many Bolivian officers practice ocean sailing in Argentinean big naval ships.  The Bolivian Navy has several Special Forces units to address both internal and external conflicts.

The Marine component of the FNB originated with the creation of the Marine Battalion Almirante Grau in the early 1980s.This unit of 600 men is based on Tiquina naval base on Lake Titicaca.Later changes name to Marine Battalion Independence, based in Chua (Not to be confused with the Independence RI17 EB).At present this battalion maintains a similar number of troops including premilitares.

Bolivia's navy operates one utility aircraft for the use of headquarters.

==Conscription==

Since 1904 military service has been compulsory for all fit males between the ages of eighteen and forty-nine. In practice, however, budgetary limitations strictly limited the number of eligible men conscripted, and those traditionally tended to be mostly Indians. Beginning in 1967, conscripts were legally held on active duty for up to two years, but funds seldom permitted even a full year's service. Noncommissioned officers (NCOs) and warrant officers, all of whom were volunteers, generally were drawn from mixed-blood cholos (those of Spanish and Indian descent). In the late 1980s, the service obligation was one year, and conscripts had to be at least nineteen years of age. The FF.AA. commander reported in early 1989 that the largest percentage of conscripts came from the middle class. One explanation for this change could have been the flocking of youths to the lucrative coca paste-making business. Military authorities in the Cochabamba area in particular began to experience growing difficulty in enlisting volunteers in the mid-1980s. Consequently, the military reportedly was resorting to pressganging eighteen-year-olds off the city streets to fill their annual quotas.

==Training installations==

Training installations include the Garras International Antinarcotics Training School (Escuela Garras del Valor) is a military training facility located in Bolivia, which trains military and law enforcement personnel from Bolivia and other Latin American countries[tpl]Citation needed|reason=ref? which countries?|date=May 2011[/tpl] in counternarcotics, intelligence, and counterinsurgency techniques.[tpl]cite web|url=http://montevideo.usembassy.gov/usaweb/paginas/400a-00EN.shtml|title=United States promotes rule of law, transparency in the Americas.|date=26 May 2005|work=Embassy of the United States: Montevideo|accessdate=3 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/p/inl/rls/rpt/cbj/fy2002/3701.htm|title=Andean Counterdrug Initiative: International Narcotics and Law Enforcement: FY 2002 Budget Justification|date=May 2001|work=U.S. Dept. of State (official website)|accessdate=3 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mediaaccuracy.org/node/64|title=New York Times Misleads Readers on Drug War in Bolivia|last=Ledebur|first=Kathryn|date=4 September 2008|work=Media Accuracy on Latin America|accessdate=3 February 2010[/tpl]
