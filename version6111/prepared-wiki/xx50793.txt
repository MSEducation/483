The Tampa Bay Mutiny was a charter franchise of Major League Soccer active from 1996 to 2001. They initially played in Tampa Stadium and were immediately successful, winning the first MLS Supporters' Shield behind MLS MVP Carlos Valderrama and high-scoring forward Roy Lassiter, whose 27 goals in 1996 is still the MLS single-season record.
The team hosted the last event at the "Big Sombrero", a 2–1 win over the MetroStars on September 21, 1998. The Mutiny moved to newly built Raymond James Stadium starting with the 1999 season.
The Mutiny had been competitive for its first few seasons. However, as they transitioned into their new home, the trading of popular players (including both Valderrama and Lassiter for little in return) led to less exciting soccer and decreased fan support. Unable to find local buyers"MLS fold Mutiny" - St. Pete Times and hampered by an unfavorable lease agreement for Raymond James Stadium,"Mutiny Renews Lease" - St. Pete Times the league folded the franchise after the 2001 season."Miami, Tampa fight to keep MLS teams" - Sports Illustrated Dec. 2001 So far, Mutiny is the only of the ten founding MLS members to have been dissolved, rather than rebranded like some other cases.
Like the area's football team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the "mutiny" moniker referred to the area's celebrated pirate history, going back to José Gaspar.
