The North Carolina State Fair is an annual fair and agricultural exposition held in Raleigh, North Carolina, and organized by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. 

==History==

The North Carolina State Fair was first held by the North Carolina State Agricultural Society at a site east of Raleigh in 1853. The event has been held at three different locations since, finding its current home in 1928. It has been celebrated continuously since 1853, with the exceptions of 1861 to 1869 (during the Civil War and Reconstruction), 1926 to 1927 (when the Agricultural Society disbanded and the state Agriculture Department took over operations), and 1942 to 1945 (during World War II). In the 1870s and 1880s, the mills in Winston-Salem would close so that workers could attend the state fair in Raleigh.  
The fair has been held at its present site on the western edge of Raleigh since 1928. The 344 acre site includes many notable buildings, including Dorton Arena, a 7,500-seat arena constructed with a unique large suspended roof. 
Held for 11 days in mid-October, the fair attracts more than a million people to the N.C. State Fairgrounds in Raleigh. In 2010, the fair broke an attendance record with 1,091,887.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ncstatefair.org/2010/About/Attendance.htm | title=2010 NC State Fair Attendance [/tpl]

==Exhibits==

===Antique Farm Machinery===

The Antique Farm Machinery exhibit, located near the Village of Yesteryear displays a collection of vintage farm tools ranging from traditional spinning wheels to aged hand reapers. The exhibit also features an old milk bottle display and more than a dozen Allis-Chalmers, Farmall, John Deere and Silver King tractors from the 1930s through the 1950s.

===Cultivate a Career Tent===

This exhibit replaced the Green NC exhibit during its debut in 2011. In the exhibit, visitors can go on a fun and interactive career personality scavenger hunt to learn about the wide variety of career paths in the agricultural industry.

===Field of Dreams===

This exhibit takes children through the growing and harvesting process, going from farm to table. Visitors to Field of Dreams can get a basket at the exhibit entrance and pick crops such as apples, strawberries and cucumbers. Along the way, they learn about other crops and how they turn into everyday staples, such as peanut butter and cereal. After picking the crops, children can then “sell” their harvest at the Field of Dreams Farmers Market for fair money. The money can then be spent at the Field of Dreams Grocery Store.

====Flower and Garden Show====

This oasis on the fairgrounds features winding pathways through beautiful gardens grown by local organizations. More than 90 demonstrations are held throughout the fair, with experts offering advice on such topics as pumpkin carving, flower arranging and proper plant care.

===Got to Be NC Agriculture Tent===

If you want the best, it’s “Got to Be NC.” In this exhibit, visitors can discover and sample food products from across North Carolina. More than 20 local vendors participate in the exhibit throughout the course of the fair.

===Heritage Circle===

Heritage Circle is a step back in time. There is plenty of activity at the circle, from the crew maintaining the tobacco barn during the fair to the craftsmen demonstrating their traditional methods of woodcarving, blacksmithing and chair-building. Visitors can also enjoy the taste of homemade ice cream, apple cider or a hush puppy from the Old Grist Mill as they listen to engaging stories or the sweet melodies from the Bluegrass Stage.

===State Fair Ark===

In 2011, the fireworks were shot off from a new location across the street from the fairgrounds. The new location offers additional safety, frees traffic congestion and offers a spectacular panoramic view above the Midway.

===Free Entertainment===

The N.C. State Fair offers plenty of free entertainment for the price of admission ticket. There are roaming ground entertainers across the fairgrounds, staged entertainment acts in Kiddieland Fun Park and outside the Expo Center, as well as continuous musical performances on the Bluegrass and Waterfall stages.

Kiddieland Fun Park, located near Gate 1, is nestled under the trees near the Kiddieland carnival area. This section of the N.C. State Fair caters to children with entertaining shows, rides and attractions, plus space to take a break from the Midway.

===Carnival Rides and Games===

The N.C. State Fair has the largest midway at any state fair.
Rides require tickets; some cost two to three tickets, while the wilder ones are five to six tickets.

====Roller coasters====

In 2006, Powers Great American Midway, based out of Burgaw, won the midway contract for the fair. The company provides more than 100 rides each year, as well as carnival games and concession stands on the midway.
Since then, Powers Great American Midway has made steps to create an eco-friendly midway. These steps including the addition of LED lighting on nearly all the rides and using B20, a soybean-based biodiesel, to power all of the generators.
In 2011, Powers unveiled the refurbished SkyDiver, which is similar to a Ferris wheel in shape. The difference is that passengers ride in cages and can spin the cages in a barrel roll fashion. The 90-foot-tall ride was completely overhauled with a spectacular lighting display composed of about 100,000 energy-efficient LED lights.
In 2008, Susan Ogden of Raleigh helped name the Pinfarri RC-48 roller coaster when it premiered on the midway. The Toxic Shock is a blue and orange roller coaster that is known for twists and banked curves. 
The Ride:
The train makes a loose turn out of the station and up a steep [tpl]convert|70|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] lift hill. It then proceeds down a banked twisting drop and into the first of three over-banked curves. At the base of the third over-banked curve, the track stays moderately banked and around a 3.0 g helix. The track levels and pulls into the station.
Another roller coaster, the Avalanche, is milder. The car pulls out of the station and around a 180-degree right turn onto the lift. The car ascends the [tpl]convert|50|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] lift and around another 180 turn to the right. The car then descends a [tpl]convert|40|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] drop, reaching 54 mph before climbing [tpl]convert|40|ft|m[/tpl] into the first banked curve. Around that and down a second [tpl]convert|20|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] drop that then takes you back up into the spiral, banking more heavily as you descend. You are warned about high g forces here but there are no strong g forces on this ride.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] When you finally exit the spiral, you descend a small dip and pull into the station.
