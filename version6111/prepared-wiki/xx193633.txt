Ilija Stanić (born 19 October 1945 in Čelebići near Konjic, Yugoslavia) was an agent of UDBA Yugoslav secret police, who is believed to have assassinated Vjekoslav Luburić, a Croatian Ustasha General responsible for war crimes in Jasenovac concentration camp during World War II.
His father was a Croatian Ustasha who fought against Yugoslavia. In 1951, Stanić’s father died in a military operation.
Stanić left Yugoslavia in 1966. After living in France and Germany, he settled in Spain. He worked at General Vjekoslav Luburić’s press in Carcaixent until April 20, 1969. That day, Luburić was assassinated and Stanić escaped. Since then, the Interpol has searched for him, but never caught him.
In 2003, Valencian journalist, Francesc Bayarri found Ilija Stanić in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and interviewed him. Bayarri has published a book on the subject, entitled Cita a Sarajevo (in Sarajevo).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.panorama-actual.es/noticias/not227790.htm|title=Francesc Bayarri presenta en Alicante el libro ´Cita a Sarajevo´ |date=29 May 2009|work=Panorama Actual|language=Spanish|accessdate=13 July 2010[/tpl]
