The Arjun (Sanskrit: अर्जुन) is a third generation[tpl]cite web|title=On track with today's top tanks|url=http://www.army-technology.com/features/featureon-track-with-todays-top-tanks|publisher=Army Technology|accessdate=4 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=A Look at Indian Army's Main Battle Tanks|url=http://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/a-look-at-indian-army-s-main-battle-tanks-20569.html?page=2|accessdate=4 August 2013|newspaper=India TV|date=6 March 2013[/tpl] main battle tank developed by India's Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), for the Indian Army. The tank is named for Arjun, a character in the Indian epic, Mahabharata.
The Arjun features a 120 mm main rifled gun with indigenously developed APFSDS ammunition, one 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun, and a 12.7 mm machine gun. It is powered by a single MTU multi-fuel diesel engine rated at 1,400 hp, and can achieve a maximum speed of [tpl]convert|70|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] and a cross-country speed of [tpl]convert|40|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl]. It has a four-man crew: commander, gunner, loader and driver. Automatic fire detection and suppression and NBC protection systems are included. All-round anti-tank warhead protection by the newly developed Kanchan armour is claimed to be much higher than available in comparable third generation tanks.
Subsequently delays and other problems in its development from the 1990s to the 2000s prompted the Indian Army to order T-90S tanks from Russia to meet requirements that the Arjun had been expected to fulfill.No more Arjuns for Indian Army Times of India
In March 2010, the Arjun was pitted against the T-90 in comparative trials and performed well. Army placed an order for an additional 124 Arjun Mk-I tanks on 17 May 2010 and 124 Arjun Mk-II Tanks on 9 August 2010.[tpl]cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Army-places-fresh-order-for-124-more-Arjun-tanks/articleshow/5940228.cms|work=Times of India|title=Army places fresh order for 124 more Arjun tanks | date=17 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/army-to-purchase-more-arjun-tanks/391862/ |title=Army to purchase more Arjun tanks |publisher=Business-standard.com |accessdate=18 May 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100614202523/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/army-to-purchase-more-arjun-tanks/391862/| archivedate= 14 June 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2010/05/21/Future-of-Indias-Arjun-tank-looks-secure/UPI-94101274452185/ |title=Future of India's Arjun tank looks secure |publisher=UPI.com |date=21 May 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2010[/tpl]

==History==

===Planning and development===

The DRDO, with its Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (CVRDE) as the main laboratory, was tasked to develop the hull, armour, turret, running gear and gun for the tank, with the powerpack being imported.
Although the development of the tank began in 1972 by the CVRDE, it was only in 1996 that the Indian government decided to mass-produce the tank at Indian Ordnance Factory's production facility in Avadi.Arjun globalsecurity.com
When first accepted for service in the army, the Arjun relied heavily on foreign components and technology. Initially close to 50% of the tank's components were imported, which included the engine, transmission, gun barrel, tracks, and fire control system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://164.100.47.5/newdebate/214/22102008/11.00amTo12.00Noon.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - 22-10 i.rtf |format=PDF [/tpl] However, several of these have since been replaced by indigenous systems or are being supplied by Indian companies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Equipment/Armour/42-Arjun.html |title=Land Forces Site - Arjun |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |date=7 March 2001[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/labs/ARDE/English/index.jsp?pg=achieve.jsp |title=ARDE Achievements |publisher=Drdo.gov.in |date=22 July 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110721155632/http://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/labs/ARDE/English/index.jsp?pg=achieve.jsp| archivedate= 21 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Recent comments from Army sources indicate that the Russian T-90S will form the mainstay of its future force, despite that tank’s performance issues in hot weather.
The Arjun project experienced serious budget overruns and repeated delays that resulted in a development time of over 37 years. A complicating factor was that advances in technology and the threat environment in the intervening years led to multiple revision of requirements by the Army.

===Upgrades===

As part of improving the Arjun to the Mark-II variant, DRDO is continuing to develop new technology systems for MBT Arjun, in order to improve performance in areas like automatic target locating, tracking and destruction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.india-server.com/news/drdo-plans-to-incorporate-hi-tech-6333.html |title=DRDO Plans To Incorporate Hi-Tech Technology Systems In Arjun Battle Tank |publisher=India-server.com |accessdate=7 February 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100210161830/http://www.india-server.com/news/drdo-plans-to-incorporate-hi-tech-6333.html| archivedate= 10 February 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The Arjun MK-II variant is being developed in coordination with and with the involvement of the Indian Army and will feature several modifications that are being sought by it.
DRDO has developed the Tank Urban Survival Kit which is a series of improvements to the Arjun intended to improve fighting ability in urban environments which includes defensive aids like laser warning, IR jammer, and aerosol smoke grenade system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.india-defence.com/reports/4266 |title=Defensive Aid Systems for Arjun MBT Ready: DRDO |publisher=India Defence |date=3 October 2009 |accessdate=7 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://indiadefenceonline.com/551/arjun-tank%E2%80%99s-defensive-systems-to-undergo-trials/ |title=Arjun Tank’s Defensive Systems To Undergo Trials |publisher=India Defence Online |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=7 February 2010[/tpl]
CVRDE has developed tank simulators.
DRDO developed a Laser Warning Control System (LWCS) in cooperation with Elbit Limited of Israel to be equipped on the Arjun at regimental level.
LWCS includes the defensive aids mentioned, and will help reduce the signatures of the tank in the battle field and improve its survivability.
DRDO is also co-developing the Mobile Camouflaging System (MCS) technology along with a Gurgaon-based private sector defence manufacturer Barracuda Camouflaging Limited.
The MCS has been developed by DRDO to help the tank reduce the threat of interference from all types of sensors and smart munitions of the enemy in the tank's systems.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
The upgrade also includes a new improved 1500 hp engine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kitsune.addr.com/Rifts/Rifts-Pre-Rifts-Vehicles/Indian_Arjun_MkII_MBT.htm |title=Indian Arjun Mk II & III Main Battle Tank |publisher=Kitsune.addr.com |accessdate=7 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Equipment/Armour/42-Arjun.html |title=Land Forces Site - Arjun |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |date=7 March 2001 |accessdate=7 February 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100125082032/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Equipment/Armour/42-Arjun.html| archivedate= 25 January 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] An anti-helicopter round is under development as well.

==Specifications==

Weighing in at 58.5 tons, the Arjun tank is significantly heavier than the Soviet-legacy tanks used presently by the Indian Army, and required changes to the army's logistics establishment, including new railroad cars to transport the bigger and heavier Arjuns. The required logistical changes have been made but the cost of the whole project has increased.A last bid to save the Arjun thaindian.com[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/05/28/stories/2006052805401000.htm |title=BFAT wagons inducted into Army |publisher=Hindu.com |date=28 May 2006 |accessdate=10 June 2011[/tpl]

===Armament===

Armed with a 120 mm rifled gun, the Arjun is believed to be capable of firing APFSDS (kinetic energy penetrator) rounds, HE, HEAT, High Explosive Squash Head (HESH) rounds at the rate of 6-8 rounds per minute and the Israeli developed semi-active laser guided LAHAT missile. The LAHAT is a gun-launched missile and is designed to defeat both enemy armour and enemy combat helicopters. In addition, the Arjun is armed with a 12.7 mm AA machine gun and a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun.Main Battle Tank, Arjun, Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO), Ministry of Defense, India The Arjun can carry 39 rounds in special blast-proof canisters. The Arjun uses a manual loader and has a crewman to reload the gun.

===Fire control and navigation===

The computerised fire control system aboard Arjun has been jointly developed by DRDO with the Elbit,Israel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ipcs.org/pdf_file/issue/1796701917IPCS-Special-Report-23.pdf |title=Arjun: India’s main battle tank (mbt) from T-80 to generation next |publisher=IPCS |accessdate=23 June 2006[/tpl] The Fire Control System is stabilised on two axes, and with an extremely high hit probability (design criteria call for a greater than 0.9 Pk) replaces an earlier analogue one, which had problems due to its inability to function under the harsh desert conditions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defencejournal.com/nov98/arjun.htm |title='Arjun MK I' - India's MBT-70 or white elephant? |publisher=Defencejournal.com |accessdate=28 September 2011[/tpl] The combined day sight from Bharat Electronics Ltd. and the thermal imager (formerly from Sagem, now reported to be from El-Op) constitute the gunner's primary sight. The first batch of tanks of the 124 ordered by the Army will have an all-digital Sagem FCS, whereas the second block will have the BEL unit, which will be used for all units thereafter.  The commander's own stabilised panoramic sight allows him to engage targets and/or hand them over to the gunner.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.india-defence.com/reports-3162 |title=Indian Army to Acquire 124 Arjun MBTs By 2009: Defence Ministry |publisher=India Defence |accessdate=28 September 2011[/tpl] The Arjun has an auxiliary power unit to operate weapon systems in silent watch mode as well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.army-technology.com/projects/arjun-mbt/ |title=Arjun Main Battle Tank |publisher=Army Technology |accessdate=28 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Equipment/Armour/42-Arjun.html |title=Land Forces Site - Arjun |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |date=7 March 2001 |accessdate=28 September 2011[/tpl]
The tank incorporates GPS-based navigation systems and sophisticated frequency hopping radios.  The state-of-the-art Battlefield Management System, co-developed by DRDO and Ebit Israel, allows it to network with other fighting units.http://defense-update.com/wp/20101003_tank_upgrade_elbit.html[tpl]dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl] The Arjun has the capability to network with other tanks, thanks to its Battle Management System.  In a search and engage operation, several Arjun tanks can monitor an opponent and his moves, and try to eliminate him in a chase or ambush.

===Protection===

The turret and glacis are protected with "Kanchan" ("gold") modular composite armour, which derived its name from Kanchan Bagh, Hyderabad, where the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL) is located.[tpl]cite web|url=http://frontierindia.net/the-kanchan-armor/ |title=Frontier India, The Kanchan armour |publisher=Frontierindia.net |date=24 September 2007 |accessdate=10 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110725073043/http://frontierindia.net/the-kanchan-armor/| archivedate= 25 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Kanchan is made by sandwiching composite panels between Rolled Homogenous Armor (RHA). This helps in defeating APFDS and HEAT rounds. Trials conducted in 2000, showcased the ability of Kanchan armour to protect the tank, even when hit at point blank range by a T-72. It also demonstrated the capability to defeat HESH and APFSDS rounds, which included the Israeli APFSDS rounds. A new honeycomb design of Non-Explosive and Non-Energetic Reactive Armour (NERA) along with Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) protection equipment along with, mine sweeps and an automatic fire fighting system are setup on the Arjun Mark II variant. Electromagnetic-counter mine system can also be installed to disable magnetic mines and disrupts its electronics before the tank reaches them. Signature reduction suite is also available for this design to reduce the probabilities of the object to be detected by Infrared, Thermal, Radar-Thermal, and Radar bands. The planned improvements include Electro-optical/IR "dazzlers", Laser warning receivers, aerosol grenade discharging systems and a computerised control system among few. The tank is fitted with infrared jammer, laser rangefinders and designators are used in navigation (GPS/INS), observation systems and sensors, real-time command and beyond-vision-range target engaging. Advanced Fire Control System (FCS) is linked to a millimetre band radar system, laser range-finder, crosswind sensor and IR and radiometer sensors on board. The millimetre band radar system mounted on the turret is capable of operating as a Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS) and also has a Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) and radar jammer. Four all-bearing Laser warning receivers (LWR) for the new fire-control system enables the Arjun is capable of shooting down helicopters. Battle Management System has a panoramic sight with the commander's station equipped with eight periscopes for 360° vision. Commander's independent thermal viewer, weapon station, position navigation equipment, and a full set of controls and displays have been linked by a digital data bus for improved fire control system. The tank is fitted with digital maps, improved cooling system to compensate for heat generated by the additional computer systems, FBCB2 capabilities, New radars, EW Systems, C4ISR Systems, Gun Control System (GCS) Integrated Battlefield Management System (IBMS) and Active protection System.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.india-defence.com/reports-3162 |title=Indian Army to Acquire 124 Arjun MBTs By 2009: Defence Ministry |publisher=India-defence.com |accessdate=10 June 2011[/tpl]
A Mobile Camouflage System has been developed and integrated into the Arjun as part of the 'Development of Defensive Aids System' project.[tpl]citation |author=Ministry of Defence |title=Annual Report 2009–2001 |url=http://mod.nic.in/reports/AR-eng-2010.pdf |publisher=Government of India[/tpl] in collaboration with Barracuda Camouflage Limited,to reduce the vehicle signature against all known sensors and smart munitions.
An Advanced Laser Warning Countermeasure System (ALWCS) for the fire control system has been developed. This consists of a laser warning system, Infra-Red (IR) jammer and aerosol smoke grenade system. This is being developed jointly with Elbit Systems Limited of Israel. The ALWCS has been integrated on Arjun MBT and trials have been carried out.[tpl]cite web|url=http://indiadefenceonline.com/551/arjun-tank%E2%80%99s-defensive-systems-to-undergo-trials/ |title=Arjun Tank’s Defensive Systems To Undergo Trials |publisher=India Defence Online |accessdate=10 June 2011[/tpl]

===Mobility===

The engine and transmission are provided by German companies MTU and Renk respectively.India Defence Arjun MBT The water-cooled engine generates 1,400 hp and is integrated with an Indian turbocharger and epicyclic train gearbox with four forward and 2 reverse gears.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/row/arjun.htm |title=Arjun |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=7 February 2010[/tpl] A local transmission is under trials and it is envisioned to ultimately replace the Renk-supplied unit. The tracks which were being supplied by German company Diehl are now being manufactured by L&T. The cooling pack has been designed for desert operations. The Arjun has a lower ground pressure than the lighter T-72, due to its design.
The Arjun features a hydro-pneumatic suspension. This coupled with the Arjun's stabilisation and fire control system allows the tank excellent first-hit probability against moving targets while on the move.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.drdo.org/products/mbt.htm |title=DRDO Arjun page |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090509191119/http://www.drdo.org/products/mbt.htm |archivedate=9 May 2009[/tpl] Its ride comfort is highly praised.

In a testimony to the Indian Parliament in 2008 the Defense Minister said that army had indicated Arjun's performance as satisfactory and they will enter service with 140 Armoured Brigade at Jaisalmer.
A comparative trial was conducted by the Indian Army in March 2010, in which the Arjun was pitted against the T-90. The trial pitted one squadron of Arjuns against an equal number of T-90s. Each squadron was given three tactical tasks; each involved driving across 50 kilometres of desert terrain and then shooting at a set of targets. Each tank had to fire at least ten rounds, stationary and on the move, with each hit being carefully logged. In total, each tank drove 150 km and fired between 30-50 rounds. The trials also checked the tanks' ability to drive through water channels 1.5-1.8 metres deep.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/arjun-tank-outruns-outguns-russian-t-90/389650/|title=Arjun tank outruns, outguns Russian T-90|last=Shukla|first= Ajai|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Business Standarad|accessdate=15 April 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100326223421/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/arjun-tank-outruns-outguns-russian-t-90/389650/| archivedate= 26 March 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
A Ministry of Defence press release reported that the Arjun demonstrated excellent performance under various circumstances, such as driving cross-country over rugged sand dunes, detecting, observing and quickly engaging targets, accurately hitting targets – both stationary and moving, with pin pointed accuracy. It displayed accurate and quick target acquisition capability during day and night in all types of weather and shortest possible reaction time during combat engagements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=61870 |title=Press Information Bureau English Releases |publisher=Pib.nic.in |accessdate=10 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110717072017/http://www.pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=61870| archivedate= 17 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

Arjun tank hull and turret has been modified to achieve the target weight of about 55 tons from 59-64 tons. Elbit is helping to enhance its firepower and battlefield survivability and IMI is helping to augment Arjun Mk II’s mobility, redesign its turret and hull and improve its production-line processes.http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/5835/39536497.jpg
The tank underwent developmental trials in 2012, at Rajasthan's Pokhran field firing range which continued for two months with the focus on 19 parameters.
DRDO started production of 124 Arjun Mark II tanks for the Indian Army after the success of these trials. The tank commander's thermal imaging (TI) night sight, the tank's operation in "hunter-killer" mode, the tank's missile firing capability from its main gun, and a laser missile warning and counter measure system were among the crucial upgrades that will be tested.[tpl]cite news|title=Trials of Arjun mark II start in Pokhran|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-25/india/32408149_1_panoramic-sight-t-90-arjun|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=25 Jun 2012[/tpl]

==FMBT==

FMBT was originally a new tank design that was to be developed from scratch for induction in 2025 and beyond. The FMBT and the programme would have focused on weight reduction in the design and was to be a lighter tank of 50 tons,.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/drdo-to-develop-army%5Cs-next-generation-tank/404082/ |title=DRDO to develop army's next-generation tank |publisher=Business-standard.com |date=10 August 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2011[/tpl]http://www.indianexpress.com/news/fmbt-to-focus-on-weight-reduction-of-battle-tanks-says-drdo-chief/1055203 However, the idea was dropped as no major breakthrough technology was realised in tank design that needed a complete design from scratch. As such it was decided to take the Arjun Mk II and upgrade the tank with new upgrades (suggested and followed by Israel's Merkava tanks). Future tanks are expected to be based on the Arjun and will incorporate new technologies just as most other tanks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-31/chennai/28303080_1_combat-vehicles-protection-futuristic-main-battle-tank |title=DRDO's Combat Vehicle Development Unit Is |work=The Times of India|date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2011[/tpl]
