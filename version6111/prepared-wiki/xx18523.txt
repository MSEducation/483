[[Equatorial coordinate system]]

CATEGORIES: Celestial coordinate system

The equatorial coordinate system is a widely used celestial coordinate system used to specify the positions of celestial objects.
It may be implemented in spherical or rectangular coordinates, both defined by an origin at the center of the Earth, a fundamental plane consisting of the projection of the Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere (forming the celestial equator), a primary direction towards the vernal equinox, and a right-handed convention.[ref]

The origin at the center of the Earth means the coordinates are geocentric, that is, as seen from the center of the Earth as if it were transparent and nonrefracting.[ref]
