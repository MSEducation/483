As commonly reported in many interviews, Mick Jones, the founding member, lead guitarist, and main songwriter of Foreigner was at home recovering from having the flu. Mick was in the process of listening to audition tapes of various singers to replace the newly departed Lou Gramm when he came upon a cassette of Johnny Edwards. Upon hearing the demo tape, Mick immediately jumped out of bed and shouted out, "This is it!", referring to Edwards' voice as the perfect replacement for Lou.  Released on June 14, 1991, Foreigner's new album, Unusual Heat had 11 songs in total, and 10 of these were the combination of mainstay Mick, Johnny and co-producer, Terry Thomas, who had previously worked with Bad Company's lead vocalist, Brian Howe, on their last 3 albums as producer and songwriter.
In addition to providing lead vocals, Edwards was also an accomplished guitarist who not only added rhythm guitar but also played the lead guitar in the song "Mountain of Love", the fifth track on the Unusual Heat album. The Billboard 200 documented Unusual Heat at #117 on August 3, 1991. The album's first single, "Lowdown and Dirty" was included on the band's Rhino double-CD retrospective Juke Box Heroes. Although Edwards received some critical acclaim for his live performances and vocal style, Unusual Heat was a commercial failure, and Lou Gramm returned the following year, effectively ending Edwards' tenure as Foreigner's front-man. In 1992, The Reunited Gramm & Foreigner Founder, Mick Jones released ' The Very Best & Beyond ' with three new songs. 1 of the tracks " With Heaven On Our Side" was co-written by Johnny Edwards. who departed earlier that year after a two year reign as lead singer.
Edwards quit the music business several years ago to raise a family with his wife. They have two children. 
In an interview snippet from March 2004 JK Jeff Northrup, Edwards old band-mate & Friend, received a "Major" offer to record a new rock album with Edwards at the vocal helm but, Johnny turned it down as he was happy in life outside music. However, even after vocalist Paul Shortino was brought in, Edwards still contributed song-writing & co-lead vocals for two tracks. 
Edwards and Jeff "JK" Northrup also can be heard playing and singing together  on two compilation Rock albums compiled and released by  Australian Website and Record Label www.Melodicrock.com. 
Edwards is also an activist for peace and racial equality. His parents, Jean and George Edwards (a retired professor of theology and Presbyterian minister) of Louisville, Kentucky, are pacifists and civil rights activists who influenced Johnny to have as much contact with African-Americans as possible.
Johnny Edwards is now living a comfortable life in Louisville with his wife and two children.
