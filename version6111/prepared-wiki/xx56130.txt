==History==

The conference was formed with nine charter members (Augustana College, Carthage College, Elmhurst College, Illinois College, Illinois Wesleyan University, Lake Forest College, Millikin University, North Central College and Wheaton College) on April 26, 1946, in Jacksonville, Ill., and opened competition in the 1946-47 academic year as the College Conference of Illinois. In 1967, the name was changed to the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin, to recognize Carthage, which moved to Kenosha, Wis. in 1962, and Carroll University, which entered the conference in 1955.
The CCIW sponsors 21 sports: baseball, men’s and women’s basketball, men’s and women’s cross country, football, men’s and women’s golf, men’s and women’s soccer, softball, men’s and women’s swimming, men’s and women’s tennis, men’s and women’s indoor track & field, men’s and women’s outdoor track & field, volleyball and wrestling.
CCIW membership has experienced several changes since its inception. After Carthage left in 1952, Illinois College withdrew the following year (1953). Elmhurst and Wheaton withdrew following the 1959-60 academic year. Wheaton re-joined for all sports but football in 1967 (and for football in 1970). Elmhurst re-joined in the fall of 1967 for all sports but football (and for football in 1968). Carroll joined during the 1955 spring sports season (1954-55 academic season). Carthage returned in the fall of 1961, and North Park University entered the following fall (1962). Lake Forest dropped out at the end of the 1962-63 season. The last member to leave the CCIW was Carroll following the 1991-92 season. In 2007, Rose–Hulman Institute of Technology, located in Terre Haute, Ind., joined the CCIW as an associate member for men's and women's swimming.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cciw.org/sports/2010/6/28/Gen._0628102341.aspx?tab=cciwhistoricalinformation|title=CCIW History|accessdate=2010-06-28|publisher=www.cciw.org[/tpl]
