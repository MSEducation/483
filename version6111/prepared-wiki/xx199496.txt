United States Air Force Combat Control Teams, singular Combat Controller, (CCT) (AFSC 1C2X1) are ground combat forces specialized in a traditional pathfinder role while having a heavy emphasis on simultaneous air traffic control, fire support and command, control, and communications in covert or austere environments.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=174 |title=Combat Control Fact Sheet |work=Air Force Special Operations Command |publisher=United States Air Force |accessdate=13 January 2013|archiveurl=http://archive.is/8rCmr|archivedate=21 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.airforce.com/careers/detail/combat-control-males-only/ |title=Combat Control career description |accessdate=12 January 2013[/tpl]

==Overview==

Assigned to Special Tactics Squadrons, Combat Controllers are an integral part of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), the Air Force component of United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). Combat Controllers are often assigned individually or as a team to Army Special Forces, Army Ranger, and Navy SEAL teams to provide expert air support coordination and communications capabilities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sofrep.com/combat-controllers/ |title=Combat Controllers Overview |publisher=SOFREP |accessdate=2013-05-11[/tpl]
Combat Controllers are FAA-certified air traffic controllers and maintain proficiency throughout their career. Many Combat Controllers also qualify and maintain proficiency as joint terminal attack controllers (JTACs) where they call in and direct air strikes, close air support and fire support during battle.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=26819 |title=Combat Controllers Play Key Role in Terror War |author=Donna Miles |publisher=American Forces Press Service |date=23 April 2004  |accessdate=12 January 2013 [/tpl] Combat Control, like all U.S. special operations forces career fields (e.g., Army Rangers, Army Special Forces, Navy SEALs, etc.), is male-only. Out of the five Air Force Crosses awarded since the Global War on Terror started in 2001 three have been awarded to Combat Controllers for extraordinary heroism in combat.
The term "Combat Control Team" comes from World War II where allied troop-carrier squadrons developed gliderborne teams called Combat Control Teams. A Combat Control Team consisted of one glider pilot and four enlisted technicians. They utilized a jeep and a trailer-mounted radio to pass critical information to aircraft. The first time they were used was during Operation Varsity where two teams with the 18th Airborne Corps  infiltrated German lines and they established forward airfields where they supported resupply operations and provided airfield control.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ccshf.org/EuroTheater.html |title=US Air Force Combat Control Teams – A Unique History |accessdate=20 January 2013[/tpl]

==Motto==

CCT Motto:
"First There," reaffirms the Combat Controller's commitment to undertaking the most dangerous missions behind enemy lines by leading the way for other forces to follow.

==Mission==

Air Force Special Operations Command's Combat Controllers are Battlefield Airmen assigned to special tactics squadrons. They are trained special operations forces and certified Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.afsoc.af.mil/specialtactics/ccttraining.asp |title=CCT Training |accessdate=12 January 2012 [/tpl]
The mission of a Combat Controller is to deploy undetected into combat and hostile environments to  conduct special reconnaissance, establish assault zones or airfields, while simultaneously conducting air traffic control, fire support, command, control, and communications and forward air control.  They deploy with air and ground forces in support of direct action, such as counter-terrorism, foreign internal defense, humanitarian assistance, and combat search and rescue. Combat Controllers employ all-terrain vehicles, amphibious vehicles, weapons and demolitions in pursuit of their objectives, which may include obstacle destruction.

==Training==

Combat Controller training, which is nearly two years long, is among the most rigorous in the US military. The CCT pipeline has a wash out rate upwards of 80–85%, mostly due to self eliminations and injuries sustained during training. The Air Force is working to lower the washout rate through proper education, testing and rigorous pre-pipeline training.[tpl]cite web |url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/airforcejoin/a/hardjobs.htm |title=Hardest Air Force Jobs |accessdate=11 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2010/05/airforce_critical_skills_051410/ |title=AETC aims to lower war-zone job washouts |author=Michelle Tan  |publisher=Air Force Times |date=14 May 2010 |accessdate=11 January 2013 [/tpl]
Combat Controllers maintain air traffic controller qualification skills throughout their career in addition to other special operations skills. Many qualify and maintain proficiency as joint terminal attack controllers (JTACs).  Their 35-week initial training and unique mission skills earn them the right to wear the scarlet beret and their 3 skill level (apprentice). From that point they attend a 12–15-month advanced skill training course to obtain their 5 skill level (journeyman). Once they complete AST their training pipeline is finished and they are mission-ready Combat Controllers.

===Initial training===

The first course Combat Controller trainee's attend after the 8.5-week Basic Military Training is the two-week long Combat Control Selection Course at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. The selection course focuses on sports physiology, nutrition, basic exercises, combat control history and fundamentals.
The second course in the CCT pipeline is the Combat Control Operator Course located at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi. The Operator course is 15.5 weeks long. The Operator course teaches aircraft recognition and performance, air navigation aids, weather, airport traffic control, flight assistance service, communication procedures, conventional approach control, radar procedures and air traffic rules.
After the Operator course the trainee attends the Army Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia. In the three-week course the trainees learn basic parachuting skills required to infiltrate an objective area by static line airdrop.
The next course after Airborne School is the Air Force Basic Survival School located at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington. SERE School lasts three weeks. The course teaches techniques for survival in remote areas. Instruction includes principles, procedures, equipment and techniques that enable individuals to survive, regardless of climatic conditions or unfriendly environments, and return alive.
The last course in the Combat Control pipeline is the Combat Control School located at Pope Field, North Carolina. The CCT School is thirteen weeks long and it provides the final Combat Controller qualifications. The training includes physical training, small unit tactics, land navigation, communications, assault zones, demolitions, fire support and field operations including parachuting. Graduates of Combat Control school are awarded their 3-skill level (apprentice) on their Air Force Specialty Code, scarlet beret and CCT flash.

===Advanced training===

After the Combat Controller gains their three level they attend Special Tactics Advanced Skills Training for 12 to 15 months as part of the Special Tactics Training Squadron located at Hurlburt Field, Florida. Advanced Skills Training is a program for newly assigned Combat Controllers, Pararescuemen and Special Operations Weather Technicians. AST produces mission-ready operators for Air Force Special Operations Command and United States Special Operations Command. The AST schedule is broken down into four phases: water, ground, employment and full mission profile. The course tests the trainee's personal limits through demanding mental and physical training.
During Advanced Skills Training Combat Controllers (along with PJs and SOWT) attend two more advanced courses. Army Military Free Fall Parachutist School at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona for five weeks. The course instructs free fall parachuting procedures. It also provides wind tunnel training, in-air instruction focusing on student stability, aerial maneuvers, air sense, parachute opening procedures and parachute canopy control. They also attend Air Force Combat Diver School which is hosted at the Navy Diving and Salvage Training Center, Naval Support Activity Panama City, Florida. Combat Diver School is six weeks long. After completion of Combat Diver School trainees become combat divers, learning to use scuba and closed circuit diving equipment to covertly infiltrate denied areas. The course provides training to depths of 130 feet, stressing development of maximum underwater mobility under various operating conditions. A class of CCTs and PJs at the Air Force Combat Diver School was covered by Discovery Channel's program Surviving the Cut during season two, which originally aired 25 July 2011.

==Assigned units==

Once Combat Controllers complete advanced training they are assigned to Special Tactics Squadrons across Air Force Special Operations Command.

==History==

===Pathfinders during World War II===

United States Army pathfinders originated in 1943 during World War II out of need for accurate airdrops after several mishaps occurred in the airborne assault on the Sicilian city of Gela during the allied invasion of Sicily. The 82nd Airborne Division performed a nighttime airborne assault outside of Gela. Due to poor visual references and high winds exceeding [tpl]convert|45|mph|km/h[/tpl] two battalions landed 30 miles from their drop zone and a third battalion landed over 55 miles from their drop zone.Hoyt (2007), p. 21 Undeterred by the flawed airdrop, the paratroopers were still able to hinder the German counterattack to allow for the allies amphibious assault to gain a foothold on the beach.
General James M. Gavin who was the Deputy Commander of the 82nd Airborne Division created the Army Pathfinders to ensure airborne operations are more successful in getting the paratroopers at the designated drop zone. These pathfinders preceded main assault forces into objective areas and drop zones in teams to provide weather information and visual guidance to inbound aircraft through the use of high-powered lights, flares and smoke pots, burning buckets of gas-soaked sand and the Eureka beacon. The pathfinder teams consisted of eight to twelve pathfinders along with six soldiers who provided security for the pathfinders while they set up their equipment and aided paratroopers, gliders and planes in reaching their designated drop zones. Pathfinders were first successfully used later in the Sicilian campaign. During the Normandy invasion pathfinders jumped in prior to the main airborne assault force and guided 13,000 paratroopers to their designated drop zones. Pathfinders were used during Operation Market Garden to secure several key bridges required for advancing allied ground units. During the Battle of the Bulge pathfinders enabled an aerial resupply of the 101st Airborne Division.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ccshf.org/Pathfinders.html |title=PathFinders Born |accessdate=20 January 2013[/tpl]
The pathfinders in the Pacific campaign operated slightly differently than their European pathfinder counterparts and pioneered a number of military "firsts". President Franklin D. Roosevelt, amidst the Quebec Conference in August 1943, was impressed by British General Orde Wingate's account of what could be accomplished in Burma with proper air support.p.176 Busch, Bryan Cooper ''Bunker Hill to Bastogne: Elite Forces and American Society 2006 Brasseys  To comply with Roosevelt's proposed air support for British long range penetration operations in Burma, the United States Army Air Forces created the 5318th Air Unit to support the Chindits. In March 1944, they were designated the 1st Air Commando Group by USAF General Hap Arnold. Arnold chose Colonel John R. Alison and Colonel Philip Cochran as co-commanders of the Air Commando Group.[tpl]cite web |title=95 Year Old Air Commando Legend Shares History with Today's Special Operators |url=http://www2.afsoc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123098074 |accessdate=20 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ccshf.org/PacificTheater.html |title=The Pacific Theatre |accessdate=20 January 2013[/tpl]
In 1944 the strategy decided upon by the allied forces for the Burma Campaign consisted of fortified compounds inside Japanese territory due to increasing large Japanese patrols along the border.Slim, p. 219 This change was in part forced upon him by strengthened Japanese patrols along the Burmese frontier, making a repeat of the successful infiltration in 1943 unlikely. In an imaginative move prompted by Colonel Philip Cochran's assurance that he could transport both troops and supplies by glider,Alison, John (Maj. Gen.), Phil Cochran, The Most Unforgettable Character I've Met Wingate arranged for the bulk of the force to enter Burma by air, greatly accelerating the force's ability to reach its target objectives.Masters, p. 172 The pathfinders would land in gliders in preselected open fields in Burma, and prepare them for large-scale landings by transport aircraft. The air support provided by Cochran and Alison proved critical to the success of the operation.Masters, pp. 146–147 In three months, 600 sorties by Dakota transport aircraft transferred 9,000 troops, 1,300 pack animals and 245 tons of supplies to landing zones across Burma. Many of the soldiers who would later fight in Operation Thursday. The Air Commandos in Burma would achieve numerous military "firsts" such as; ground forces coordinating air strikes via radio, medevacing wounded by air. When the Burma road was reopened in January 1945 the Air Commandos were inactivated in preparation for the invasion of mainland Japan.

===Korean War and birth of USAF CCTs===

When the U.S. Air Force became a separate service in 1947, Air Force pathfinders were assigned to a provisional Pathfinder Squadron. The Air Force looked for ways to get rid of pathfinders, believing that electronic navigation aids could replace them and the pathfinders role became increasingly neglected by the Air Force. During the Korean War pathfinders were only used in the three main airdrops early in the war. Meanwhile, in Washington D.C. the Air Force and Army leadership were at odds about which service would have ownership of the pathfinder mission. The Department of Defense eventually sided with the Air Force having full control of all air traffic control duties. Despite the resolution the Army never inactivated their pathfinder units which has subsequently become more specialized towards helicopters. After the DOD sided with the Air Force being chosen for the pathfinder mission they expected six teams of pathfinders to be formed from Army-to-Air Force transfers but only got eleven men, enough to form one team. In 1953 the Pathfinder Squadron was discontinued and the pathfinder team was assigned to the 1st Aerial Port Squadron and officially designated a Combat Control Team.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ccshf.org/book/Chapter1.pdf |title=The 1950's – A long, hard gestation |accessdate=20 January 2013[/tpl]
The Army and Air Force remained at odds regarding pathfinder and CCT roles. In August 1953 the 10th Special Forces Group refused to allow CCTs to join in their joint tactical missions held at Dobbins AFB, Georgia. As a result, Tactical Air Command stopped all Army airlift missions until the Army allowed the CCTs to take part.
While the career field was still young and lacking in manpower from so little Army pathfinder transfers, Air Force headquarters solicited from radio maintenance career field for more Combat Controllers. It was also stipulated that Combat Controllers would have to attend air traffic control school if they would be controlling aircraft from the ground. Because of their job, Combat Controllers had to have either an air traffic control AFSC or a radio maintenance AFSC in addition to jump school to become a Combat Controller. This gave rise to blousing trousers and wearing paratrooper boots, a tradition that still exists to the present.
The first time a Combat Control Team was utilized was during the 1958 Lebanon crisis to combat communist expansion and bolster the pro-Western Lebanese government.

===Vietnam War===

In the Vietnam War, Combat Controllers helped assure mission safety and expedited air traffic flow during countless airlifts. Combat Controllers also flew as forward air guides in support of indigenous forces in Laos and Cambodia. It has been reported that Combat Controllers conducted covert forward air control for U.S. and allied aircraft performing interdiction missions against Communist troops and supplies on the Ho Chi Minh trail.

===Cold War era===

===Modern era===

In 2004 Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated "some 85 percent of the air strikes in Operation Enduring Freedom were called in by Air Force Combat Controllers." Combat Controllers have received three of the five awarded Air Force Crosses since the Global War on Terror started in 2001, all three occurred while supporting Operation Enduring Freedom.
On 6 October 2009 12 Combat Controllers and Pararescuemen began an 812-mile trek across the Southern U.S. called the Tim Davis/Special Tactics Memorial March. The march was in remembrance of Special Tactics airmen who lost their lives since the Global War on Terror began and to increase awareness about the Special Operations Warrior Foundation which funds the education of surviving children of Special Operations personnel who are killed in action or training. The march began at the Medina annex on Lackland Air Force Base, Texas where the Combat Control career field begins and finished at Hurlburt Field, Florida where they graduate from Advanced Skills Training and become full fledged Combat Controllers. The airmen marched in two-man teams for 24 hours each carrying 50 lb ruck sacks. The march was just completed ten days later.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/timdavis-specialtacticsmemorialmarch/samschindler |title=SPECIAL OPERATIONS WARRIOR FOUNDATION Tim Davis/Special Tactics Memorial March |date=28 November 2009 |accessdate=20 January 2013[/tpl]
Within 24 hours of the 2010 Haiti earthquake a team of Combat Controllers from the 23rd Special Tactics Squadron stationed at Hurlburt Field, Florida arrived at Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. 28 minutes after arriving the Combat Controllers assumed authority of air traffic control duties to allow planes carrying humanitarian aid to land safely.[tpl]cite web |url=http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/journal/docs-temp/355-elton.pdf |title=Haiti: Boots on the Ground Perspective |author=Colonel Buck Elton |publisher=Small Wars Journal |accessdate=12 January 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1984685_1984949_1985270,00.html |title=2010 Time Magazine's 100 most influential people: Chief Master Sergeant Tony Travis |publisher=Time Magazine |author=Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate= 13 January 2013[/tpl]  The Combat Controllers directed over 2,500 flights without incident from a card table using only hand radios.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.charlesayoub.com/index.php/article/269/Chief%20Master%20Sergeant%20Tony%20Travis |title=Chief Master Sergeant Tony Travis |accessdate=13 January 2013 [/tpl] Under their direction planes were able to take off and land every five minutes, bringing in over 4 million pounds of supplies.

Former commander of United States Special Operations Command, General Bryan D. Brown, commented on Combat Controllers in a May 2011 interview with the publication, The Year in Special Operations 2011-2012 Edition, stating: "During this kind of warfareWar on Terror the USAF combat controller CCT/TAC-P guys really carried an incredible load. During the opening days in Afghanistan, we deployed some SF teams without a CCT, and the difference between those that had controllers and those that didn’t was dramatic. Quite frankly no one wants to go to war without them. They are admired, capable, and requested at a rate far greater than we could ever provide. Their efforts were critical in the early days of OEF and still are. Here is another force whose true impact on the battlefields around the world will never be known or appreciated. They are absolutely phenomenal."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/a-warrior%E2%80%99s-life-an-interview-with-gen-bryan-%E2%80%9Cdoug%E2%80%9D-brown-usa-ret/ |title=A Warrior’s Life: An Interview with Gen.
