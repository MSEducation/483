2013 was the first year where emerging markets comprised the majority of the worlds GDP. The economic power has then shifted to the advantage of emerging markets, and especially the BRIC countries. The NHH Symposium 2013 debated whether the system and Norwegian decision makers were well equipped for these structural changes. How can Norwegian companies position themselves as good as possible to meet the challenges and opportunities that follows these structural changes?
