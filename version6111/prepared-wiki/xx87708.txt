It is named in honour of the British novelist Ian Fleming who wrote a series of twelve novels and nine short stories about the fictional British spy James Bond between 1953 and 1964. James Bond was also the central character in dozens of additional novels by other authors published starting in 1968, and continues to be featured in one of the most popular and profitable film series in history. The numbering of this asteroid, 9007, is significant in that 007 refers to Bond's code number in the British Secret Intelligence Service.
