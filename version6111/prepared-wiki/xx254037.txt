Belle Mont is a historic Jeffersonian-style plantation house near Tuscumbia in Colbert County, Alabama. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1982, due to its architectural significance.

==History==

Belle Mont was built between 1828 and 1832 for Dr. Alexander W. Mitchell, a native of Virginia.  Mitchell, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh, was also one of the first large-scale planters and slaveholders in the area.  Mitchell sold the [tpl]convert|1680|acre|sing=on[/tpl] plantation to another Virginia native, Isaac Winston, in 1833.  It remained in the Winston family until 1941.  The house and [tpl]convert|33|acre[/tpl] were donated to the Alabama Historical Commission in 1983.  It has been undergoing a phased restoration since that time and is currently operated as a historic house museum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://preserveala.org/bellemont.aspx?sm=g_c|title=Belle Mont|accessdate=2010-01-10|work=Alabama Historic Commission[/tpl]

==Architecture==

Considered by architectural scholars to be a clear example of Thomas Jefferson's influence upon the architecture of the early United States, Belle Mont is one of only a few surviving examples of Jeffersonian architecture in the Deep South.  Built in red brick, it features a raised, two story central section with flanking one-story wings.  The side wings project toward the rear in a U-shape, forming a semi-enclosed rear courtyard.[tpl]cite book |title=Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810-1930 |last=Gamble |first=Robert |year=1990 |publisher=The University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama |isbn=0-8173-1134-3 |pages=53â€“56|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xre7Dg44C3UC [/tpl]
