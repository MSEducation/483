Kathmandu ([tpl]lang-ne|काठमाडौं[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ne|kɑʈʰmɑɳɖu|[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-new|येँ देय्‌[/tpl]) is the capital and largest urban agglomerate of Nepal. The agglomerate consists of Kathmandu Metropolitan City at its core, and its sister cities Patan, Kirtipur, Thimi, and Bhaktapur. It also includes the recently recognized urban areas of Shankhapur, Karyabinayak, and Champapur.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nepalnews.com/archive/2011/jul/jul16/news03.php|title=41 new municipalities declared|publisher=Nepal News|date=July 16, 2013|accessdate=November 24, 2013[/tpl] Banepa, Dhulikhel, and Panauti are satellite urban areas of Kathmandu located just outside the Kathmandu valley. Kathmandu is also known informally as "KTM" or the "tri-city".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kathmandu|title=Kathmandu|accessdate=2009-12-20|publisher=Urban Dictionary[/tpl] According to a census conducted in 2011, Kathmandu metropolis alone has 5.2 million inhabitants, and the agglomerate has a population of more than 7.5 million inhabitants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/VDC_Municipality.pdf|title=National Population and Housing Census 2011 |publisher=Cbs.gov.np|accessdate=November 25, 2013[/tpl] 
The metropolitan city area is [tpl]convert|50.67|km2|mi2[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=2&pr_id=2|title= Kathmandu Facts|accessdate=December 12, 2009|publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City Council, Government of Nepal[/tpl] and has a population density of 123,225 per km².
The city stands at an elevation of approximately [tpl]convert|1400|m|ft[/tpl] in the bowl-shaped Kathmandu Valley of central Nepal. It is surrounded by four major mountains: Shivapuri, Phulchoki, Nagarjun, and Chandragiri. Kathmandu Valley is part of three districts (Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur), has the highest population density in the country, and is home to about a twelfth of Nepal's population.
Historically, the Kathmandu Valley and adjoining areas were known as Nepal Mandala. Until the 15th century, Bhaktapur was its capital when two other capitals, Kathmandu and Lalitpur, were established.Slusser, Mary (1982). Nepal Mandala: A Cultural Study of the Kathmandu Valley. Princeton University. ISBN 978-0-691-03128-6. Page vii. During the Rana and Shah eras, British historians called the valley itself "Nepal Proper". Today, Kathmandu is not only the capital of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, but also the headquarters of the Central Development Region of Nepal. The Central Region comprises three zones: Bagmati, Narayani, and Janakpur. Kathmandu is located in the Bagmati Zone.[tpl]cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/np.html|title=The World Fact Book"Geography|accessdate=November 23, 2009|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), US[/tpl]
Kathmandu is the gateway to tourism in Nepal. It is also the nerve center of the country's economy. It has the most advanced infrastructure of any urban area in Nepal, and its economy is focused on tourism, which accounted for 3.8% of Nepal's GDP in 1995–96. Tourism in Kathmandu declined thereafter during a period of political unrest, but since then has improved. In 2013, Kathmandu was ranked third among the top 10 travel destinations on the rise in the world by TripAdvisor,and ranked first in Asia.http://www.businessinsider.com/tripadvisor-says-these-are-the-hot-new-destinations-for-travelers-2013-12
The city has a rich history, spanning nearly 2000 years, as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley. Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu. Most of Kathmandu's people follow Hinduism and many others follow Buddhism. There are people of other religious beliefs as well, giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture. Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city. English is understood by Kathmandu's educated residents.
Kathmandu's sister cities (Lalitpur Patan) and Bhaktapur are integral to Kathmandu's cultural heritage, tourism industry, and economy; therefore UNESCO's World Heritage Site lists all three cities' monuments and attractions together under one heading, "Kathmandu Valley-UNESCO World Heritage Site".[tpl]cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/121|title=Kathmandu Valley-Unesco World Heritage site|accessdate=November 25, 2009|publisher=World Heritage- UNESCO.org[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001520/152020m.pdf|format=PDF|title=Kathmandu Valley World Heritage site: Nepal|work= Heritage Homeowner’s Preservation Manual|accessdate=November 25, 2009|publisher=Unesco, Kathmandu and Bangkok|year=2006[/tpl]

==Toponymy==

The city of Kathmandu was named after Kasthamandap temple, that stands in Durbar Square. In Sanskrit, Kastha ([tpl]lang-sa2|काष्ठ[/tpl]) means "wood" and Mandap ([tpl]lang-sa2|/मण्डप[/tpl]) means "covered shelter". This temple, also known as Maru Satal, was built in 1596 by King Laxmi Narsingh Malla. The two-storey structure is made entirely of wood, and uses no iron nails nor supports. According to legend, all the timber used to build this pagoda was obtained from a single tree.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=1&pr_id=1|title=Introduction|accessdate=2009-12-12|publisher= Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Government of Nepal[/tpl]
The colophons of ancient manuscripts, dated as late as the 20th century, refer to Kathmandu as Kasthamandap Mahanagar in Nepal Mandala.  Mahanagar means "great city". The city is called "Kasthamandap" in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day. During medieval times, the city was sometimes called Kantipur (कान्तिपुर). This name is derived from two Sanskrit words - Kanti and pur. "Kanti" is one of the names of the Goddess Lakshmi, and "pur" means place. Thus, Kathmandu is also known as Kasthamandap.
Among the indigenous Newar people, Kathmandu is known as Yen Desa (येँ देश), and Patan and Bhaktapur are known as Yala Desa (यल देश) and Khwopa Desa (ख्वप देश).[tpl]cite book | last = Kirkpatrick| first = Colonel| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ijxAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false| title = An Account of the Kingdom of Nepaul| work = | publisher = London: William Miller| year=1811| accessdate = 9 March 2012[/tpl] pp. 159, 162-163.

==History==

Archaeological excavations in parts of Kathmandu have found evidence of ancient civilizations. The oldest of these findings is a statue, found in Maligaon, that was dated at 185 AD.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/nepal/article/?id=1485 |title=सुस्त उत्खनन » पुरातत्व » सम्पदा :: नेपाल :: |publisher=Ekantipur.com |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2012-01-15[/tpl] The excavation of Dhando Chaitya uncovered a brick with an inscription in Brahmi script. Archaeologists believe it is two thousand years old. Stone inscriptions are an ubiquitous element at heritage sites and are key sources for the history of Nepal
The earliest Western reference to Kathmandu appears in an account of Jesuit Fathers Johann Grueber and Albert d'Orville. In 1661, they passed through Nepal on their way from Tibet to India, and reported that they reached "Cadmendu, the capital of the Kingdom of Necbal".[tpl]cite book | last = Levi| first = Sylvain| url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:C8hQgCDo-QUJ:himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ancientnepal/pdf/ancient_nepal_25_05.pdf+kuti+necbal&hl=en&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESi1sCufbZ0miDrM87qYQinPM-tdnLbKdy_9dVkkHEDDtBrFP0WMe5YCb8ugsjinxRuW5wg8jKoxs34VWa0NrMQE-EIVTF4XkqE_fBaCIaehWaSTSd667Yba6th7UQufXvovZL_H&sig=AHIEtbSJJa1YFxA2dpP--Pxsz3HtiKVAQA| title = Nepal| work = | publisher = | page=50 | accessdate = 1 December 2013[/tpl]

===Ancient  history===

The ancient history of Kathmandu is described in its traditional myths and legends. According to Swayambhu Purana, the present day Kathmandu was once a lake called Nagdaha. The lake was drained by Manjusri, who established a city called Manjupattan and made Dharmakar the ruler of the land.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=4&pr_id=4|title=History|accessdate=2009-12-12|publisher=Government of Nepal[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newatravels.com/nepal/index.html|title=History:Ancient Nepal|accessdate=2009-12-18|publisher=New Travels and Tours Ltd[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Apr |first=Wed |url=http://www.nepalmandal.com/content/7752.html |title=Article:झीसं पत्याः यानाच्वनागु अन्धविश्वास – Author:विपेन्द्र महर्जन Nepalmandal |publisher=Nepalmandal.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2012-01-15[/tpl]
Very few historical records exist of the period before the medieval Licchavis rulers. According to Gopalraj Vansawali, a genealogy of Nepalese monarchs, the rulers of Kathmandu Valley before the Licchavis were Gopalas, Mahispalas, Aabhirs, Kirants, and Somavanshi.Article:गोपालराज वंशावली Language: Nepalbhasa, Journal:नेपालभाषा केन्द्रीय विभागया जर्नल, Edition:1, Date: 1998, Page: 18-25, 44 The Kirata dynasty was established by Yalamber. During the Kirata era, a settlement called Yambu existed in the northern half of old Kathmandu. In some of the Sino-Tibetan languages, Kathmandu is still called Yambu. Another smaller settlement called Yengal was present in the southern half of old Kathmandu, near Manjupattan. During the reign of the seventh Kirata ruler, Jitedasti, Buddhist monks entered Kathmandu valley and established a forest monastery at Sankhu.

===Medieval history===

====Licchavi era====

The Licchavis from the Indo-Gangetic plain migrated north and defeated the Kiratas, establishing the Licchavi dynasty. During this era, following the genocide of Shakyas in Lumbini by Virudhaka, the survivors migrated north and entered the forest monastery in Sankhu masquerading as Koliyas. From Sankhu, they migrated to Yambu and Yengal (Lanjagwal and Manjupattan) and established the first permanent Buddhist monasteries of Kathmandu. This created the basis of Newar Buddhism, which is the only surviving Sanskrit-based Buddhist tradition in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dsbcproject.org/manuscripts/short-history |title=A Short History of Sanskrit Buddhist Manuscripts |publisher=Dsbcproject.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl] With their migration, Yambu was called Koligram and Yengal was called Dakshin Koligram[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/Page_Ward+No.+23_38 |title=Kathmandu Metropolitan City |publisher=Kathmandu.gov.np |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl] during most of the Licchavi era.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=37878&cat_id=22 |title=काष्ठमण्डप कि होममण्डप |publisher=Gorkhapatra.org.np |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl]
Eventually, the Licchavi ruler Gunakamadeva merged Koligram and Dakshin Koligram, founding the city of Kathmandu. The city was designed in the shape of Chandrahrasa, the sword of Manjushri. The city was surrounded by eight barracks guarded by Ajimas. One of these barracks is still in use at Bhadrakali (in front of Singha Durbar). The city served as an important transit point in the trade between India and Tibet, leading to tremendous growth in architecture. Descriptions of buildings such as Managriha, Kailaskut Bhawan, and Bhadradiwas Bhawan have been found in the surviving journals of travelers and monks who lived during this era. For example, the famous 7th-century Chinese traveller Xuanzang described Kailaskut Bhawan, the palace of the Licchavi king Amshuverma.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/kantipur/news/news-detail.php?news_id=224549 |title=राष्ट्रपति अचानक ग्यालरीमा | कला र शैली | :: कान्तिपुर :: |publisher=Ekantipur.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-15[/tpl] The trade route also led to cultural exchange as well. The artistry of the Newar people—the indigenous inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley—became highly sought after during this era, both within the Valley and throughout the greater Himalayas. Newar artists travelled extensively throughout Asia, creating religious art for their neighbors. For example, Araniko led a group of his compatriot artists through Tibet and China. Bhrikuti, the princess of Nepal who married Tibetan monarch Songtsän Gampo, was instrumental in introducing Buddhism to Tibet.

====Malla era====

The Licchavi era was followed by the Malla era. Rulers from Tirhut, upon being attacked by Muslims, fled north to the Kathmandu valley. They intermarried with Nepali royalty, and this led to the Malla era. The early years of the Malla era were turbulent, with raids and attacks from Khas and Turk Muslims. There was also a devastating earthquake which claimed the lives of a third of Kathmandu's population, including the king Abhaya Malla. These disasters led to the destruction of most of the architecture of the Licchavi era (such as Mangriha and Kailashkut Bhawan), and the loss of literature collected in various monasteries within the city. Despite the initial hardships, Kathmandu rose to prominence again and, during most of the Malla era, dominated the trade between India and Tibet. Nepalese currency became the standard currency in trans-Himalayan trade.
During the later part of the Malla era, Kathmandu Valley comprised four fortified cities: Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, and Kirtipur. These served as the capitals of the Malla confederation of Nepal. These states competed with each other in the arts, architecture, aesthetics, and trade, resulting in tremendous development. The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings, squares, and temples, as well as the development of water spouts, the institutionalization of trusts (called guthis), the codification of laws, the writing of dramas, and the performance of plays in city squares. Evidence of an influx of ideas from India, Tibet, China, Persia, and Europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription from the time of king Pratap Malla. Books have been found from this era that describe their tantric tradition (e.g. Tantrakhyan), medicine (e.g. Haramekhala), religion (e.g. Mooldevshashidev), law, morals, and history. Amarkosh, a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381 AD, was also found. Architecturally notable buildings from this era include Kathmandu Durbar Square, Patan Durbar Square, Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the former durbar of Kirtipur, Nyatapola, Kumbheshwar, the Krishna temple, and many others.

===Modern era===

====Early Shah rule====

The Gorkha Kingdom ended the Malla confederation after the Battle of Kathmandu in 1768. This marked the beginning of the modern era in Kathmandu. The Battle of Kirtipur was the start of the Gorkha conquest of the Kathmandu Valley. Kathmandu was adopted as the capital of the Gorkha empire, and the empire itself was dubbed Nepal. During the early part of this era, Kathmandu maintained its distinctive culture. Buildings with characteristic Nepali architecture, such as the nine-story tower of Basantapur, were built during this era. However, trade declined because of continual war with neighboring nations. Bhimsen Thapa supported France against Great Britain; this led to the development of modern military structures, such as modern barracks in Kathmandu. Dharahara, the nine storied tower, was built during this era.

====Rana rule====

Rana rule over Nepal started with the Kot Massacre, which occurred near Hanuman Dhoka Durbar. During this massacre, most of Nepal's high-ranking officials were massacred by Jang Bahadur Rana and his supporters. Another massacre, the Bhandarkhal Massacre, was also conducted by Kunwar and his supporters in Kathmandu. During the Rana regime, Kathmandu's alliance shifted from anti-British to pro-British; this led to the construction of the first buildings in the style of Western European architecture. The most well-known of these buildings include Singha Durbar, Garden of Dreams, Shital Niwas, and the old Narayanhiti palace. The first modern commercial road in the Kathmandu Valley, the New Road, was also built during this era. Trichandra College (the first college of Nepal), Durbar School (the first modern school of Nepal), and Bir Hospital (the first hospital of Nepal) were built in Kathmandu during this era. Rana rule was marked by tyranny, debauchery, economic exploitation and religious persecution.[tpl]cite news|last=Dietrich|first=Angela|title=Buddhist Monks and Rana Rulers: A History of Persecution|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm |accessdate=24 September 2013|newspaper=Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods|year=1996[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last= Lal |first=C.

==Geography==

The metropolitan city is located in the northwestern part of Kathmandu Valley. The city covers an area of [tpl]convert|50.67|km2|mi2[/tpl]. The average elevation is [tpl]convert|1350|m|ft[/tpl] above sea level. The city is bounded by the Lalitpur Sub-metropolitan City to the south, Kirtipur Municipality to the southwest, Madyapur Thimi Municipality to the east, and different Village Development Committees of Kathmandu to the north, the west, and the northeast. However, the urban agglomerate of Kathmandu-Patan-Kirtipur-Thimi-Bhaktapur covers the entire valley and extends beyond the valley to satellite towns of Banepa, Panauti, and Dhulikhel in the east.
Eight rivers flow through the city. Of these, the Bagmati, Bishnumati, Dhobikhola, Manohara, Hanumant, and Tukucha rivers are predominant. The mountains from where these rivers originate are in the elevation range of [tpl]convert|1500|-|3000|m|ft[/tpl], and have passes which provide access to and from Kathmandu and its valley. Kathmandu falls in the central development region and it is its headquarters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=3&pr_id=3|title=Geography|accessdate=2009-12-12|publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=Shreshta|title=Nepal in Maps|page=|work=Kathmandu valley|pages=102–114|publisher=Educational Publishing House|location=Kathmandu|year=2005|first=S.H[/tpl] An ancient canal once flowed from Nagarjuna hill through Balaju to Kathmandu; this canal is now extinct.
The Bagmati River originates at Bagdwaar, which means "tiger gate" in Sanskrit.Fisher, James F. with Acharya, Tanka Prasad and Acharya, Rewanta Kumari (1997) Living martyrs: individuals and revolution in Nepal Oxford University Press, New York, page 220, ISBN 978-0-19-564000-7 The water flows out through a gargoyle shaped like a tiger's mouth in the northern hills of Kathmandu valley about fifteen kilometers ([tpl]convert|15|km|abbr=off|disp=output only[/tpl]) northeast of Kathmandu, where three streams come together.Davis, John A. (1977) "Water Quality Standards for the Bagmati River" Journal: Water Pollution Control Federation 49(2): pp. 227–234, page 227 These streams become a wide, swift, flowing river, with a high load of suspended solids, giving the river a grey appearance and coating the bottom with a grey silt of glacial flour. The Bagmati flows southwest for about ten kilometers ([tpl]convert|10|km|abbr=off|disp=output only[/tpl]) along the Kathmandu Valley, which is predominately occupied with rice-patties in terraces on its slopes. A number of resistant rock strata interrupt its flow down the valley; among these is the outcrop on which the Pashupatinath Temple is built. After passing the temple, the river flows south across the plain where it is joined by the larger Manohara River and turns westward. After entering the city, the Bagmati is joined by a number of tributaries, notably the Dhobi Khola[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/world_cities/kathmandu.jpg |title=Kathmandu central map |publisher=Lib.utexas.edu |accessdate=2013-11-25[/tpl] and the sewage-laden Tukucha Khola.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Kannel|first1=Prakash Raj|last2=Lee|first2=S.|last3=Lee|first3=Y.-S.|last4=Kanel|first4=S.

Five vegetation zones have been defined for Nepal. Kathmandu and its valley are in the Deciduous Monsoon Forest Zone (altitude range of [tpl]convert|1200|-|2100|m|ft[/tpl]). The dominant tree species in this zone are oak, elm, beech, maple and others, with coniferous trees at higher altitude.Shrestha S.H. p. 35

===Kathmandu agglomeration===

The agglomeration of Kathmandu covers roughly three districts, having the three highest population densities in the country, extending beyond Kathmandu Valley. The following data table describes the area.

==Climate==

Five major climatic regions are found in Nepal. Of these, Kathmandu Valley is in the Warm Temperate Zone (elevation ranging from [tpl]convert|1200|-|2300|m|ft[/tpl]), where the climate is fairly temperate, atypical for the region. This zone is followed by the Cool Temperate Zone with elevation varying between [tpl]convert|2100|-|3300|m|ft[/tpl]. Under Köppen's climate classification, portions of the city with lower elevations have a humid subtropical climate (Cwa), while portions of the city with higher elevations generally have a subtropical highland climate. In the Kathmandu Valley, which is representative of its valley's climate, the average summer temperature varies from [tpl]convert|28|-|30|C|F[/tpl]. The average winter temperature is [tpl]convert|10.1|C|1[/tpl].
The city generally has a climate with warm days followed by cool nights and mornings. Unpredictable weather is expected given temperatures can drop to [tpl]convert|3|C|F[/tpl] during the winter. During a 2013 cold front, the winter temperatures of Kathmandu dropped to [tpl]convert|−4|C|F[/tpl], and the coldest temperature was recorded in January 10, 2013 at [tpl]convert|-9.2|C|F[/tpl]. Rainfall is mostly monsoon-based (about 65% of the total concentrated during the monsoon months of June to August), and decreases substantially ([tpl]convert|100|to|200|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl]) from eastern Nepal to western Nepal. Rainfall has been recorded at about [tpl]convert|1400|mm|in|1[/tpl] for the Kathmandu valley, and averages [tpl]convert|1407|mm|in|1[/tpl] for the city of Kathmandu. On average humidity is 75%.
The chart below is based on data from the Nepal Bureau of Standards & Meteorology, "Weather Meteorology" for 2005. The chart provides minimum and maximum temperatures during each month. The annual amount of precipitation was [tpl]convert|1124|mm|in[/tpl] for 2005, as per monthly data included in the table above.
The decade of 2000-2010 saw highly variable and unprecedented precipitation anomalies in Kathmandu. This was mostly due to the annual variation of the southwest monsoon.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] For example, 2003 was the wettest year ever in Kathmandu, totalling over [tpl]convert|2900|mm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of precipitation due to an exceptionally strong monsoon season. In contrast, 2001 recorded only [tpl]convert|356|mm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of precipitation due to an extraordinarily weak monsoon season.

==Economy==

The location and terrain of Kathmandu have played a significant role in the development of a stable economy which spans millennia. The city is located in an ancient lake basin, with fertile soil and flat terrain. This geography helped form a society based on agriculture. This, combined with its location between India and China, helped establish Kathmandu as an important trading center over the centuries. Kathmandu’s trade is an ancient profession that flourished along an offshoot of the Silk Road which linked India and Tibet. From centuries past, Lhasa Newar merchants of Kathmandu have conducted trade across the Himalaya and contributed to spreading art styles and Buddhism across Central Asia.[tpl]cite news|last=Lewis|first=Todd T|title=Buddhism, Himalayan Trade, and Newar Merchants|url=http://buddhim.20m.com/8-4.htm/|accessdate=28 July 2012[/tpl] Other traditional occupations are farming, metal casting, woodcarving, painting, weaving, and pottery.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=5&pr_id=5|title=Economy|accessdate=2009-12-20|publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Government of Nepal[/tpl]
Kathmandu is the most important industrial and commercial center in Nepal. The Nepal Stock Exchange, the head office of the national bank, the chamber of commerce, as well as head-offices of national and international banks, tele-communication companies, the electricity authority, and various other national and international organizations are located in Kathmandu. The major economic hubs are the New Road, Durbar Marg, Ason and Putalisadak.
The economic output of the metropolitan area alone is worth more than one third of national GDP arround $6.5billion in terms of nominal GDP  NR.s 550 billion approximately per year $2200  per capital income approx three times national average.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=5&pr_id=5|title=Economy|publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City Office|accessdate=2009-12-18[/tpl] Kathmandu exports handicrafts, artworks, garments, carpets, pashmina, paper; trade accounts for 21% of its finances.[tpl]which|date=March 2013[/tpl] Manufacturing is also important and accounts for 19% of the revenue that Kathmandu generates. Garments and woolen carpets are the most notable manufactured products. Other economic sectors in Kathmandu include agriculture (9%), education (6%), transport (6%), and hotels and restaurants (5%). Kathmandu is famous for lokta paper and pashmina shawls.

===Tourism===

Tourism is considered another important industry in Nepal. This industry started around 1950, as the country's political makeup changed and ended the country's isolation from the rest of the world. In 1956, air transportation was established and the Tribhuvan Highway, between Kathmandu and Raxaul (at India's border), was started. Separate organizations were created in Kathmandu to promote this activity; some of these include the Tourism Development Board, the Department of Tourism and the Civil Aviation Department. Furthermore, Nepal became a member of several international tourist associations. Establishing diplomatic relations with other nations further accentuated this activity. The hotel industry, travel agencies, training of tourist guides, and targeted publicity campaigns are the chief reasons for the remarkable growth of this industry in Nepal, and in Kathmandu in particular.Shrestha pp.86–89
Since then, tourism in Nepal has thrived; it is sometimes called the "third religion" of Nepal. It is the country's most important industry.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] Tourism is a major source of income for most of the people in the city, with several hundred thousand visitors annually. Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world visit Kathmandu's religious sites such as Pashupatinath, Swayambhunath, Baudhanath and Budhanilkantha. From a mere 6,179 tourists in 1961–62, the number jumped to 491,504.[tpl]when|date=March 2013[/tpl] With political instability seen in recent years, it dropped to 275,468 in 2002–03. Since then, tourism has improved as the country turned into a Democratic Republic. In economic terms, the foreign exchange registered 3.8% of the GDP in 1995–96 but then started declining[tpl]why|date=March 2013[/tpl]. The high level of tourism is attributed to the natural grandeur of the Himalayas and the rich cultural heritage of the country.
The neighborhood of Thamel is Kathmandu's primary "traveler's ghetto", packed with guest houses, restaurants, shops, and bookstores, catering to tourists. Another neighborhood of growing popularity is Jhamel, a name for Jhamsikhel coined to rhyme with Thamel.[tpl]cite news|title=Jhamel|url=http://www.nepalitimes.com/issue/2010/01/22/LifeTimes/16741|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=Nepali Times[/tpl] Jhochhen Tol, also known as Freak Street, is Kathmandu's original traveler's haunt, made popular by the hippies of the 1960s and 1970s; it remains a popular alternative to Thamel. Asan is a bazaar and ceremonial square on the old trade route to Tibet, and provides a fine example of a traditional neighborhood.
With the opening of the tourist industry after the change in the political scenario of Nepal in 1950, the hotel industry drastically improved.Shrestha pp.86–87 Now Kathmandu boasts several five-star hotels like Hyatt Regency, Hotel Yak & Yeti, The Everest Hotel, Hotel Radisson, Hotel De L'Annapurna, The Malla Hotel, Shangri-La Hotel and The Shanker Hotel. There are several four-star hotels such as Hotel Vaishali, Hotel Narayani, The Blue Star and Grand Hotel. The Garden Hotel, Hotel Ambassador, and Aloha Inn are among the three-star hotels in Kathmandu.

As a precautionary measure, firemen were sent to the areas which were designated as accident-prone areas. In 1944, the fire service was extended to the neighboring cities of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur. In 1966, a fire service was established in Kathmandu airport. In 1975, a German government donation added seven fire engines to Kathmandu's fire service. The fire service in the city is also overlooked by an international non-governmental organization, the Firefighters Volunteer Association of Nepal (FAN), which was established in 2000 with the purpose of raising public awareness about fire and improving safety.

===Electricity and Water Supply===

Electricity in Kathmandu is regulated and distributed by the Nepal Electricity Authority. while water supply and sanitation facilities are provided by the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL).

==Demographics==

Kathmandu’s urban cosmopolitan character has made it the most populous city in Nepal, recording a population of 671,846 residents living in 235,387 households in the metropolitan area, according to the 2001 census.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=2009-12-13| url = http://www.cbs.gov.np/Population/National%20Report%202001/VDC.pdf |title=Census Nepal 2001[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] According to the National Population Census of 2011, the total population of Kathmandu is 1,744,240, with an annual growth rate of 6.12% with respect to the population figure of 2001. 70% of the total population residing in Kathmandu are aged between 15 and 59.
Over the years the city has been home to people of various ethnicities, resulting in a range of different traditions and cultural practices. In one decade, the population increased from 427,045 in 1991 to 671,805 in 2001. The population was projected to reach 915,071 in 2011 and 1,319,597 by 2021. To keep up this population growth, the KMC-controlled area of [tpl]convert|5076.6|ha|acre[/tpl] has expanded to [tpl]convert|8214|ha|acre[/tpl] in 2001. With this new area, the population density which was 85 in 1991 is still 85 in 2001; it is likely to jump to 111 in 2011 and 161 in 2021.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=6&pr_id=6|title= Population|accessdate=2009-12-12|publisher= Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Government of Nepal[/tpl]

===Ethnic groups===

The largest ethnic groups are Newar (29.6%), Matwalis (25.1% Gurung, Tamang, Magars, etc.), Khas Brahmins (20.51%), and Chettris (18.5) .[tpl]cite web|url=http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/Population/Caste%20Ethinicity%20Population.pdf |title=National Census of Nepal 2011 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl] Tamangs originating from surrounding hill districts can be seen in Kathmandu. More recently, other hill ethnic groups and Caste groups from Terai have become present as well. The major languages are Nepali and Nepal Bhasa and English is understood by majority of People. The major religions are Hinduism and Buddhism.
The linguistic profile of Kathmandu underwent drastic changes during the Shah dynasty's rule because of its strong bias towards the Brahminic culture. Sanskrit language therefore was preferred and people were encouraged to learn it even by attending Sanskrit learning centers in India. Sanskrit schools were specially set up in Kathmandu and in the Terai region to inculcate traditional Hindu culture and practices.Jha p.21

==Architecture and cityscape==

The ancient trade route between India and Tibet that passed through Kathmandu enabled a fusion of artistic and architectural traditions from other cultures to be amalgamated with local art and architecture.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=142&pr_id=172|title=Festivals|accessdate=2009-12-12|publisher= Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Government of Nepal[/tpl] The monuments of Kathmandu City have been influenced over the centuries by Hindu and Buddhist religious practices. The architectural treasure of the Kathmandu valley has been categorized under the well-known seven groups of heritage monuments and buildings. In 2006 UNESCO declared these seven groups of monuments as a World Heritage Site (WHS). The seven monuments zones cover an area of [tpl]convert|188.95|ha|acre[/tpl], with the buffer zone extending to [tpl]convert|239.34|ha|acre[/tpl]. The Seven Monument Zones (Mzs) inscribed originally in 1979 and with a minor modification in 2006 are Durbar squares of Hanuman Dhoka, Patan and Bhaktapur, Hindu temples of Pashupatinath and Changunarayan, the Buddhist stupas of Swayambhu and Boudhanath.

===Durbar squares===

===Pashupatinath temple===

The Pashupatinath Temple is a famous 5th century Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva (Pashupati). Located on the banks of the Bagmati River in the eastern part of Kathmandu, Pashupatinath Temple is the oldest Hindu temple in Kathmandu.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nepal.saarctourism.org/pashupatinath-temple.html |title=SAARC tourism |publisher=Nepal.saarctourism.org |accessdate=2010-07-04[/tpl] It served as the seat of national deity, Lord Pashupatinath, until Nepal was secularized. However, a significant part of the temple was destroyed by Mughal invaders in the 14th century and little or nothing remains of the original 5th-century temple exterior. The temple as it stands today was built in the 19th century, although the image of the bull and the black four-headed image of Pashupati are at least 300 years old.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dtSIz1vwg4YC&pg=PA166&dq=Pashupatinath&cd=3#v=onepage&q=Pashupatinath|title=Nepal|publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2006 |page=166|isbn=978-1-74059-699-2|first1=Bradley|last1=Mayhew|first2=Joe|last2=Bindloss |first3=Stan |last3=Armington[/tpl] The temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nepal.saarctourism.org/pashupatinath-temple.html|title=SAARC tourism|publisher=Nepal.saarctourism.org|accessdate=2013-11-25[/tpl] Shivaratri, or the night of Lord Shiva, is the most important festival that takes place here, attracting thousands of devotees and sadhus.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
Believers in Pashupatinath (mainly Hindus) are allowed to enter the temple premises, but non-Hindu visitors are allowed to view the temple only from the across the Bagmati River. The priests who perform the services at this temple have been Brahmins from Karnataka, South India since the time of Malla king Yaksha Malla.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vegetarian-restaurants.net/Nepal/Kathmandu-Valley/Pashupatinath-Temple.htm |title=Spiritual guides |publisher=Vegetarian-restaurants.net |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2010-07-04[/tpl] This tradition is believed to have been started at the request of Adi Shankaracharya who sought to unify the states of Bharatam (Unified India) by encouraging cultural exchange. This procedure is followed in other temples around India, which were sanctified by Adi Shankaracharya.
The temple is built in the pagoda style of architecture, with cubic constructions, carved wooden rafters (tundal) on which they rest, and two-level roofs made of copper and gold.

===Boudhanath===

The Boudhanath, (also written Bouddhanath, Bodhnath, Baudhanath or the Khāsa Chaitya), is one of the holiest Buddhist sites in Nepal, along with Swayambhu. It is a very popular tourist site. Boudhanath is known as Khāsti by Newars and as Bauddha or Bodhnāth by speakers of Nepali.Snellgrove (1987), p. 365. Located about [tpl]convert|11|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from the center and northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu, the stupa's massive mandala makes it one of the largest spherical stupas in Nepal.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref] Boudhanath became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979.
The base of the stupa has 108 small depictions of the Dhyani Buddha Amitabha. It is surrounded with a brick wall with 147 niches, each with four or five prayer wheels engraved with the mantra, om mani padme hum.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dtSIz1vwg4YC&pg=PA170&dq=Pashupatinath&cd=3#v=onepage&q=Bodhnath |title=Nepal |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2006|pages=170–1|isbn=978-1-74059-699-2|first1=Bradley|last1=Mayhew|first2=Joe |last2=Bindloss|first3=Stan|last3=Armington[/tpl] At the northern entrance where visitors must pass is a shrine dedicated to Ajima, the goddess of smallpox. Every year the stupa attracts many Tibetan Buddhist pilgrims who perform full body prostrations in the inner lower enclosure, walk around the stupa with prayer wheels, chant, and pray. Thousands of prayer flags are hoisted up from the top of the stupa downwards and dot the perimeter of the complex. The influx of many Tibetan refugees from China has seen the construction of over 50 Tibetan gompas (monasteries) around Boudhanath.

===Swayambhu===

Swayambhu is a Buddhist stupa atop a hillock at the northwestern part of the city. This is among the oldest religious sites in Nepal. Although the site is considered Buddhist, it is revered by both Buddhists and Hindus. The stupa consists of a dome at the base; above the dome, there is a cubic structure with the eyes of Buddha looking in all four directions.[tpl]clarify|date=March 2013[/tpl] There are pentagonal Toran above each of the four sides, with statues engraved on them. Behind and above the torana there are thirteen tiers. Above all the tiers, there is a small space above which lies a gajur.

===Changu Narayan===

Changu Narayan is an ancient Hindu temple near the village of Changunarayan in the Kathmandu Valley on top of a hill at the eastern end of the valley. It is [tpl]convert|6|km|mi[/tpl] to the north of Bhakathapur and [tpl]convert|22|km|mi[/tpl] from Kathmandu. The temple is one of the oldest Hindu temples of the valley and is believed to have been constructed first in the 4th century. Changu Narayan is the name of Vishnu, and the temple is dedicated to him. A stone slab discovered in the vicinity of the temple dates to the 5th century and is the oldest such stone inscription discovered in Nepal. It was rebuilt after the old temple was devastated. Many stone sculptures here date to the Licchavi period. Changu Narayan Temple is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/121 |title=UNESCO[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/nepal/around-the-kathmandu-valley/changu-narayan-temple|title= Introducing Changu Narayan Temple|publisher=Lonelyplanet.com|accessdate=2009-12-19[/tpl]
The temple is a double-roofed structure where the idol of Lord Vishnu in his incarnation as Narayana is deified. It has intricate roof struts showing multi-armed Tantric deities. A kneeling image of Garuda (the vahana or vehicle of Vishnu with a snake around its neck), dated to the 5th century, faces the temple. Non-Hindus are not allowed inside.

==Culture==

===Arts===

Kathmandu valley is described as "an enormous treasure house of art and sculptures", which are made of wood, stone, metal, and terracotta, and found in profusion in temples, shrines, stupas, gompas, chaityasm and palaces. The art objects are also seen in street corners, lanes, private courtyards, and in open ground. Most art is in the form of icons of gods and goddesses. Kathmandu valley has had this art treasure very long, but received worldwide recognition only after the country opened its doors to the outside world in 1950.
The religious art of Nepal and Kathmandu in particular consists of an iconic symbolism of the Mother Goddesses such as: Bhavani, Durga, Gaja-Lakshmi, Hariti-Sitala, Mahsishamardini, Saptamatrika (seven mother goddesses), and Sri-Lakshmi. From the 3rd century BC, apart from the Hindu gods and goddesses, Buddhist monuments from the Ashokan period (it is said that Ashoka visited Nepal in 250 BC) have embellished Nepal in general and the valley in particular. These art and architectural edifices encompass three major periods of evolution: the Licchavi or classical period (500 to 900 AD), the post-classical period (1000 to 1400 AD), with strong influence of the Palla art form; the Malla period (1400 onwards) that exhibited explicitly tantric influences coupled with the art of Tibetan Demonology.Jha p.23
A broad typology has been ascribed to the decorative designs and carvings created by the people of Nepal. These artists have maintained a blend of Hinduism and Buddhism. The typology, based on the type of material used are: Stone Art, Metal Art, Wood Art, Terracotta Art, and Painting.Jha pp.23–24

====Museums====

Kathmandu is home to a number of museums and art galleries, including the National Museum of Nepal and the Natural History Museum of Nepal. Nepal’s art and architecture is an amalgamation of two ancient religions, Hinduism and Buddhhism. These are amply reflected in the many temples, shrines, stupas, monasteries, and palaces in the seven well-defined Monument Zones of the Kathmandu valley recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This amalgamation is also reflected in the planning and exhibitions in museums and art galleries throughout Kathmandu and its sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur. The museums display unique artifacts and paintings from the 5th century CE to the present day, including archeological exportation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html|title= Museums and Art Galleries of Nepal|publisher=Asiatravel.com|accessdate=2009-12-18[/tpl]
Kathmandu museums and art galleries include: 
The National Museum is located in the western part of Kathmandu, near the Swoyambhunath stupa in an historical building. This building was constructed in the early 19th century by General Bhimsen Thapa. It is the most important museum in the country, housing an extensive collection of weapons, art and antiquities of historic and cultural importance.[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html|title=Museums and art galleries|publisher=Asia Travel|accessdate=2009-12-18[/tpl]
[/ref] The museum was established in 1928 as a collection house of war trophies and weapons, and the initial name of this museum was Chhauni Silkhana, meaning "the stone house of arms and ammunition". Given its focus, the museum contains an extensive quantity of weapons, including locally-made firearms used in wars, leather cannons from the 18th–19th century, and medieval and modern works in wood, bronze, stone and paintings.
The Natural History Museum is located in the southern foothills of Swoyambhunath hill and has a sizeable collection of different species of animals, butterflies, and plants. The museum is noted for its display of species, from prehistoric shells to stuffed animals.
The Tribhuvan Museum contains artifacts related to the King Tribhuvan (1906–1955). It has a variety of pieces including his personal belongings, letters and papers, memorabilia related to events he was involved in and a rare collection of photos and paintings of Royal family members. The Mahendra Museum is dedicated to king Mahendra of Nepal (1920–1972). Like the Tribhuvan Museum, it includes his personal belongings such as decorations, stamps, coins and personal notes and manuscripts, but it also has structural reconstructions of his cabinet room and office chamber. The Hanumandhoka Palace, a lavish medieval palace complex in the Durbar, contains three separate museums of historic importance. These museums include the Birendra museum, which contains items related to the second-last monarch, Birendra of Nepal.
The enclosed compound of the Narayanhity Palace Museum is in the north-central part of Kathmandu. "Narayanhity" comes from Narayana, a form of the Hindu god Lord Vishnu, and Hiti, meaning "water spout" (Vishnu's temple is located opposite the palace, and the water spout is located east of the main entrance to the precinct). Narayanhity was a new palace, in front of the old palace built in 1915, and was built in 1970 in the form of a contemporary Pagoda. It was built on the occasion of the marriage of King Birenda Bir Bikram Shah, then heir apparent to the throne. The southern gate of the palace is at the crossing of Prithvipath and Darbar Marg roads. The palace area covers ([tpl]convert|30|ha|acre[/tpl]) and is fully secured with gates on all sides.[tpl]Cite book|last= Woodhatch|first=Tom|title= Nepal handbook|page=194|work= The Royal Palace|accessdate=2009-12-17|url=http://books.google.com/?id=NmltSI-xt8wC&pg=PA194|publisher= Footprint Travel Guides|year=1999|isbn=978-1-900949-44-6[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|title=Lonely Planet|page=38|work=The Royal Massacre|accessdate=2009-12-17|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dtSIz1vwg4YC&pg=PA38|publisher= Lonely Planet |year=2006|isbn= 978-1-74059-699-2|first1=Bradley|last1=Mayhew|first2=Joe|last2=Bindloss|first3=Stan|last3=Armington[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last= Vibhaga|first=Nepal Sūcanā |title= Narayanhity Royal Palace, home of the King of Nepal|page=5|work=Royal Palace|accessdate=2009-12-17|url=http://books.google.com/?id=N2kKAQAAIAAJ&q=Narayanhity+Royal+Palace&dq=Narayanhity+Royal+Palace&cd=1|publisher= His Majesty's Govt., Ministry of Communications, Dept. of Information|year=1975[/tpl] This palace was the scene of the Nepalese royal massacre.

====Art galleries====

Kathmandu is a center for art in Nepal, displaying the work of contemporary artists in the country and also collections of historical artists. Patan in particular is an ancient city noted for its fine arts and crafts. Art in Kathmandu is vibrant, demonstrating a fusion of traditionalism and modern art, derived from a great number of national, Asian, and global influences. Nepalese art is commonly divided into two areas: the idealistic traditional painting known as Paubhas in Nepal and perhaps more commonly known as Thangkas in Tibet, closely linked to the country's religious history and on the other hand the contemporary western-style painting, including nature-based compositions or abstract artwork based on Tantric elements and social themes of which painters in Nepal are well noted for. Internationally, the British-based charity, the Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre is involved with promoting arts in Kathmandu.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kathmanduarts.org/ |title=Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre |publisher=Kathmanduarts.org |accessdate=2010-07-04[/tpl]
Kathmandu contains many notable art galleries. The NAFA Gallery, operated by the Arts and crafts Department of the Nepal Academy is housed in Sita Bhavan, a neo-classical old Rana palace.
The Srijana Contemporary Art Gallery, located inside the Bhrikutimandap Exhibition grounds, hosts the work of contemporary painters and sculptors, and regularly organizes exhibitions. It also runs morning and evening classes in the schools of art. Also of note is the Moti Azima Gallery, located in a three storied building in Bhimsenthan which contains an impressive collection of traditional utensils and handmade dolls and items typical of a medieval Newar house, giving an important insight into Nepalese history. The J Art Gallery is also located in Kathmandu, near the Royal Palace in Durbarmarg, Kathmandu and displays the artwork of eminent, established Nepalese painters. The Nepal Art Council Gallery, located in the Babar Mahal, on the way to Tribhuvan International Airport contains artwork of both national and international artists and extensive halls regularly used for art exhibitions.

====Literature====

The National Library of Nepal is located in Patan. It is the largest library in the country with more than 70,000 books. The books are found in English, Nepali, Sanskrit, Hindi, and Nepal Bhasa. The library is in possession of rare scholarly books in Sanskrit and English dating from the 17th century AD. Kathmandu contains the Kaiser Library, located in the Kaiser Mahal on the ground floor of the Ministry of Education building. This collection of around 45,000 books is derived from a personal collection of Kaiser Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana. It covers a wide range of subjects including history, law, art, religion, and philosophy, as well as a Sanskrit manual of Tantra, which is believed to be over 1,000 years old.
The Asa Archives are also noteworthy. They specialize in medieval history and religious traditions of the Kathmandu Valley. The archives, located in Kulambhulu, have a collection of some 6,000 loose-leaf handwritten books and 1,000 palm-leaf manuscripts (mostly in Sanskrit or Nepal Bhasa) and a manuscript dated to 1464.

====Cinema and Theater====

Kathmandu is home to Nepalese cinema and theaters. The city contains several theaters, including the National Dance Theatre in Kanti Path, the Ganga Theatre, the Himalayan Theatre and the Aarohan Theater Group founded in 1982. The M. Art Theater is based in the city. The Gurukul School of Theatre organizes the Kathmandu International Theater Festival, attracting artists from all over the world.[tpl]cite news|title=Theatre fest begins|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2010/11/17/et-cetera/theatre-fest-begins/214962/|accessdate=1 January 2014|newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=18 November 2010[/tpl]  A mini theater is also located at the Hanumandhoka Durbar Square, established by the Durbar Conservation and Promotion Committee.
Kathmandu has a number of theatres showing Nepali, Bollywood, and Hollywood films. These theaters include the Vishwajyoti Cinema Hall, Ranjana Cinema Hall, Kumari Cinema Hall and the Gopi Krishna Cinema Hall. Other theaters specialize in international cinema, such as Bigmovies, QFX Cinemas and Fcube Cinemas.

====Music====

Kathmandu is the centre of music and dance in Nepal, and these art forms are integral to understanding the city. Musical performances are organized in cultural venues. Music is a part of the traditional aspect of Kathmandu. Gunla is the traditional music festival according to Nepal Sambat. Newar music originated in Kathmandu. Furthermore, music from all over Nepal can be found in Kathmandu.
A number of hippies visited Kathmandu during the 1970s and introduced rock and roll, rock, and jazz to the city. Kathmandu is noted internationally for its jazz festival, popularly known as Jazzmandu. It is the only jazz festival in the Himalayan region and was established in March 2002. The festival attracts musicians from countries worldwide, such as Australia, Denmark, United States, Benin, and India.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The city has been referenced in numerous songs, including works by Cat Stevens ('Katmandu', Mona Bone Jakon (1970)), Bob Seger ('Katmandu', Beautiful Loser (1975)), Rush ('A Passage to Bangkok', Pulling into Kathmandu; 2112, 1976), Krematorij ('Kathmandu', Three Springs (2000)) and Fito Páez (Tráfico por Katmandú – "Traffic through Kathmandu").

===Cuisine===

The staple food of most of Kathmanduites is dal bhat. It consists of rice and lentil soup, generally served with vegetable curries and achar. Momo, a type of Nepalese version of Tibetan dumpling, has become prominent in Nepal with many street vendors selling it. It is one of the most popular fast foods in Kathmandu. Various Nepalese variants of momo including buff momo, chicken momo, and vegetarian momo are famous in Kathmandu. Dal bhat is the local cuisine of Kathmandu. 
Most of the cuisines found in Kathmandu are non-vegetarian. However, the practice of vegetarianism is not uncommon, and vegetarian cuisines can be found throughout the city. Consumption of beef is very uncommon and considered taboo in many places. Buff (meat of water buffalo) is very common. There is a strong tradition of buff consumption in Kathmandu, especially among Newars, which is not found in other parts of Nepal. Consumption of pork was considered taboo until a few decades ago. Due to the intermixing with Kirat cuisine from eastern Nepal, pork has found a place in Kathmandu dishes. A fringe population of devout Hindus and Muslims consider it taboo.
Kathmandu only had one restaurant in 1955.Lonely Planet (2003), pp. 91–92 A large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since opened, catering Nepalese cuisine, Tibetan cuisine, Chinese cuisine and Indian cuisine in particular. Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals, expatriates, and tourists. The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American chop suey, which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a fried egg commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine. Continental cuisine can be found in selected places. International chain restaurants are rare, but some outlets of Pizza Hut and KFC have recently opened there.[tpl]cite web|author=Nepal |url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293890-d2172681-Reviews-KFC-Kathmandu_Kathmandu_Valley_Bagmati_Zone_Central_Region.html |title=KFC, Kathmandu - Restaurant Reviews |publisher=TripAdvisor |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl]
Kathmandu has a larger proportion of tea drinkers than coffee drinkers. Tea is widely served but is extremely weak by western standards. It is richer and contains tea leaves boiled with milk, sugar and spices. Alcohol is widely drunk, and there are numerous local variants of alcoholic beverages. Drinking and driving is illegal, and authorities have a zero tolerance policy.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21559665|title=Nepal: A whiff of sobriety |publisher=The Economist|date=July 28, 2012|accessdate=November 25, 2013[/tpl] Ailaa and thwon (alcohol made from rice) are the alcoholic beverages of Kathmandu, found in all the local bhattis (alcohol serving eateries). Chhyaang, tongba (fermented millet or barley) and rakshi are alcohols from other parts of Nepal which are found in Kathmandu. However, shops and bars in Kathmandu widely sell western and Nepalese beers. Shops are forbidden to sell alcohol on the first two days and last two days of the Nepali month (Nepal Sambat).

===Festivals===

Most of the fairs and festivals in Kathmandu originated in the Malla period or earlier. Traditionally, these festivals were celebrated by Newars. In recent years, these festivals have found wider participation from other Kathmanduites as well. As the capital of the Republic of Nepal, various national festivals are celebrated in Kathmandu. With mass migration to the city, the cultures of Khas from the west, Kirats from the east, Bon/Tibetan from the north, and Mithila from the south meet in the capital and mingle harmoniously. The festivities such as the Ghode (horse) Jatra, Indra Jatra, Dasain Durga Puja festivals, Shivratri and many more are observed by all Hindu and Buddhist communities of Kathmandu with devotional fervor and enthusiasm. Social regulation in the codes enacted incorporate Hindu traditions and ethics. These were followed by the Shah kings and previous kings, as devout Hindus and protectors of Buddhist religion.
Cultural continuity has been maintained for centuries in the exclusive worship of goddesses and deities in Kathmandu and the rest of the country. These deities include the Ajima, Taleju (or Tulja Bhavani), Degutaleju, and Kumari (the living goddess).[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] The artistic edifices have now become places of worship in the everyday life of the people, therefore a roster is maintained to observe annual festivals. There are 133 festivals held in the year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=137&pr_id=167|title=Katmandu as a world Heritage Site|accessdate=December 12, 2009|publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Government of Nepal|accessdate=November 25, 2013[/tpl]
Some of the traditional festivals observed in Kathmandu, apart from those previously mentioned, are Bada Dashain, Tihar, Chhath, Maghe Sankranti, Naga Panchami, Janai Poornima, Pancha Dan, Teej/Rishi Panchami, Pahan Charhe, Jana Baha Dyah Jatra (White Machchhendranath Jatra), and Matatirtha Aunsi.

===Hinduism===

Assumedly, together with the kingdom of Licchavi (c. 400 to 750), Hinduism and the endogam social stratification of the Caste was established in Kathmandu Valley. The Pashupatinath Temple, Changu Narayan temple (the oldest), and the Kasthamandap are of particular importance to Hindus. Other notable Hindu temples in Kathmandu and the surrounding valley include Bajrayogini Temple, Dakshinkali Temple, Guhyeshwari Temple, and the Sobha Baghwati shrine.
The Bagmati River which flows through Kathmandu is considered a holy river both by Hindus and Buddhists, and many Hindu temples are located on the banks of this river. The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on its banks, and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side. According to the Nepalese Hindu tradition, the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation. The chief mourner (usually the first son) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation. Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the Bagmati River or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually.

===Buddhism===

Buddhism started in Kathmandu with the arrival of Buddhist monks during the time of Buddha (c. 563 - 483 BCL. S. Cousins (1996), "The dating of the historical Buddha: a review article", Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (3)6(1): 57–63.). They started a forest monastery in Sankhu. This monastery was renovated by Shakyas after they fled genocide from Virudhaka (rule: 491-461 BC).
During the Hindu Lichchavi era (c. 400 to 750), various monasteries and orders were created which successively led to the formation of Newar Buddhism, which is still practiced in the primary liturgical language of Hinduism, Sanskrit.
Legendary Princess Bhrikuti (7th-century) and artist Araniko (1245 - 1306 AD) from that tradition of Kathmandu valley played a significant role in spreading Buddhism in Tibet and China. There are over 108 traditional monasteries (Bahals and Bahis) in Kathmandu based on Newar Buddhism. Since the 1960s, the permanent Tibetan Buddhist population of Kathmandu has risen significantly so that there are now over fifty Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the area. Also, with the modernization of Newar Buddhism, various Theravada Bihars have been established.

===Kirant Mundhum===

Kirant Mundhum is one of the indigenous animistic practices of Nepal. It is practiced by Kirat people. Some animistic aspects of Kirant beliefs, such as ancestor worship (worship of Ajima) are also found in Newars of Kirant origin. Ancient religious sites believed to be worshipped by ancient Kirats, such as Pashupatinath, Wanga Akash Bhairabh (Yalambar) and Ajima are now worshipped by people of all Dharmic religions in Kathmandu. Kirats who have migrated from other parts of Nepal to Kathmandu practice Mundhum in the city.

===Others===

Sikhism is practiced primarily in Gurudwara at Kupundole. An earlier temple of Sikhism is also present in Kathmandu which is now defunct. Jainism is practiced by a small community.
