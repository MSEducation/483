The Belmont Stakes is an American grade I stakes Thoroughbred horse race held every June at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. It is a [tpl]convert|1.5|mi[/tpl] horse race, open to three-year-old Thoroughbreds. Colts and geldings carry a weight of [tpl]convert|126|lb[/tpl]; fillies carry  [tpl]convert|121|lb[/tpl]. The race is the third and final leg of the US Triple Crown, following exactly five weeks after the Kentucky Derby, and three weeks after the Preakness Stakes.  Consequently, it is run on Saturday, but never before June 5, nor after June 11. It is nicknamed "The Test of the Champion".
The attendance at the Belmont Stakes ranks fourth in North America. The attendance at the Belmont Stakes typically trails only the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Kentucky Oaks. For more information, see American Thoroughbred Racing top Attended Events. The 2004 Belmont Stakes drew a massive television audience of 21.9 million viewers and had the highest household viewing rate since 1977 when Seattle Slew won the Triple Crown.[tpl]cite web|title= Viewership of 2008 Belmont Stakes|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2008/06/13/belmont-stakes-tv-viewership/4003[/tpl]
The 146th running of the Belmont Stakes will take place on Saturday, June 7, 2014.

==History==

The first Belmont Stakes was held at Jerome Park Racetrack in The Bronx, built in 1866 by stock market speculator Leonard Jerome (1817–1891) and financed by August Belmont, Sr. (1816–1890), for whom the race was named. The race continued to be held at Jerome Park until 1890, when it was moved to the nearby facility,  Morris Park Racecourse. The race remained there until the May 1905 opening of the new Belmont Park, [tpl]convert|430|acre|km2[/tpl] racetrack in Elmont, New York, on Long Island just outside the New York City borough of Queens.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.belmontstakes.com/history/records.aspx |title=Belmont Stakes Records & Traditions |publisher=New York Racing Association |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
When anti-gambling legislation was passed in New York State, Belmont Racetrack was closed, and the race was cancelled in 1911 and 1912.
The first post parade in the United States was at the 14th Belmont, in 1880. Before 1921, the race was run in the clockwise tradition of English racing. Since then, the race has been run in the American, or counter-clockwise, direction. The winner of the Belmont Stakes is presented the August Belmont Trophy, one of the most prestigious trophies in the country.
Because of its length (one lap around the enormous Belmont main track), and because it is the final race of the Triple Crown, it is called the "Test of the Champion". Most three-year-olds are unaccustomed to the distance, and lack the experience, if not the stamina, to maintain a winning speed for so long. In a long race such as the Belmont, positioning of the horse and the timing of the move to chase for the lead can be critical.
The race was held at Aqueduct Racetrack from 1963 to 1967, while the track at Belmont was restored and renovated.

===Evolution of the Triple Crown series===

Since 1931, the order of Triple Crown races has been the Kentucky Derby first, followed by the Preakness Stakes, and then the Belmont Stakes. Prior to 1931, eleven times the Preakness was run before the Derby. On May 12, 1917 and again on May 13, 1922, the Preakness and the Derby were run on the same day. On eleven occasions, the Belmont Stakes was run before the Preakness Stakes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.turfnsport.com/triplecrown/preakness-stakes.php |title=Preakness Stakes |publisher=Turfnsport.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07[/tpl]
The Belmont Stakes is held on the first Saturday that falls on or after June 5. The Kentucky Derby is always held on the first Saturday in May; the Preakness Stakes is held two weeks later; and the Belmont Stakes is held three weeks after the Preakness. The earliest possible date for the Derby is May 1, and the latest is May 7; the earliest possible date for the Belmont is June 5, and the latest is June 11.
The first winner of the Triple Crown was Sir Barton, in 1919. On June 9, 1973, Secretariat won the Belmont Stakes by thirty-one lengths, in a record time of 2:24, becoming a U.S. Triple Crown champion that year.  His record still stands as the fastest speed for the Belmont Stakes. Count Fleet won the race by the large margin of twenty-five lengths in 1943. 
Affirmed was the last winner of the Triple Crown, taking the Belmont Stakes in 2:26 4/5 on June 10, 1978.  Ridden by eighteen year old Steve Cauthen, Affirmed defeated rival Alydar with Jorge Velasquez in the saddle.  At the time the race was the third slowest start and the third fastest finish with the quarter in 25, the half in 50, 3/4 in 1:14, the mile in 1:37 2/5.  
Belmont Park saw its largest crowd in its history when 120,139 people witnessed the Belmont Stakes in 2004 when Smarty Jones was seeking the Triple Crown but was upset by Birdstone. The largest crowd of the 20th century was in 1971 with over 80.000 people, supplemented by the city's Latino community, there to cheer on their new hero, Canonero II, the Venezuelan colt who had won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and was poised to win the U.S. Triple Crown. However, due to a foot infection that had bothered the horse for several days, Canonero II failed to win the Triple Crown when he struggled across the finish line in 4th place behind Pass Catcher, ridden by Walter Blum. Despite this loss, Canonero II was named the winner of the first Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse.

===Changes in distance===

The Belmont Stakes was run at a mile and five furlongs from 1867 to 1873; a mile and a quarter in 1890, 1891, 1892, 1895, 1904 and 1905; a mile and a furlong in 1893 and 1894; a mile and three furlongs from 1896 to 1903 and from 1906 to 1925.  The current distance of a mile and half was established in 1926.

==Traditions==

The Belmont Stakes is traditionally called "The Test of The Champion" or "Run for the Carnations" because the winning horse is blanketed with white carnations. Through 1996, the post parade song was "Sidewalks of New York". From 1997 to 2009, the audience was invited to sing the "Theme from New York, New York" following the call to the post.  In 2010, the song was changed to a solo version of Jay-Z's "Empire State of Mind"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/06/04/514149/the-belmont-stakes-singing-a-new.html|title=The Belmont Stakes singing a new tune|author=The Associated Press|date=June 4, 2010|publisher=newsobserver.com|accessdate=June 19, 2012[/tpl] before reverting to "Theme from New York, New York" for 2011[tpl]cite web |url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-06-04/ae/29685780_1_nyra-belmont-stakes-horses-step|title=Sinatra’s voice returns to Belmont Stakes|author=The Associated Press|date=June 4, 2011|publisher=boston.com|accessdate=June 19, 2012[/tpl] through the present. This tradition is similar to the singing of the state song at the post parades of the first two Triple Crown races: "My Old Kentucky Home" at the Kentucky Derby and "Maryland, My Maryland" at the Preakness Stakes.
Despite the fact that the Belmont Stakes is the oldest of the Triple Crown races, its traditions have been more subject to change. The switch of theme song from "The Sidewalks of New York" to "New York, New York" was an attempt to appeal to younger fans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://horseracing.about.com/od/belmontstakes/ss/aabeltraditions_4.htm |title=Belmont Stakes Traditions |publisher=Horseracing.about.com |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2010-10-07[/tpl] That same year the official drink was also changed, from the "White Carnation" to the "Belmont Breeze."[tpl]cite web|url=http://horseracing.about.com/od/belmontstakes/ss/aabeltraditions_5.htm |title=Belmont Stakes Traditions |publisher=Horseracing.about.com |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2010-10-07[/tpl] The New York Times reviewed both cocktails unfavorably, calling the  Belmont Breeze "a significant improvement over the nigh undrinkable White Carnation" despite the fact that it "tastes like a refined trashcan punch."[tpl]cite news |title=The Summer Cook; The Appetites Are Nearing the Gate |first=Julie |last=Powell |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E2DD1338F93BA35755C0A9639C8B63 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 8, 2005 |accessdate=2012-06-09[/tpl]
More longstanding traditions are the trophy and blanket of flowers.  The winning owner is ceremonially presented with the silver winner's trophy, designed by Paulding Farnham for Tiffany and Co.  It was first presented to August Belmont, Jr. in 1896 and donated by the Belmont family for annual presentation in 1926.  The winning horse is draped with a blanket of white carnations after the race, in similar fashion to the blanket of roses and black-eyed susans for the Derby and Preakness, respectively.

==Broadcasting history==

From 1986 until 2005, the Triple Crown television rights comprised a single package.  In late 2004, the New York Racing Association withdrew from that agreement to negotiate independently.[tpl]cite news |title=ABC Will Broadcast Belmont Stakes Starting in 2006 |first=John |last=Scheinman |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=October 5, 2004[/tpl] As a result of this NBC, who was the rights holder for all three events, was only able to keep its broadcast rights to the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. ABC regained the rights to the Belmont Stakes as part of a five-year contract that expired following the 2010 race; NBC has since regained the rights to the race.

==Fillies in the Belmont==

Three fillies have won the Belmont in 144 races: 
Three fillies have won the Kentucky Derby in 138 races, and three fillies have won the Belmont stakes in 144 races. On average, fillies have won between 2% and 3% of the Triple Crown races, with similar numbers for geldings; while about 95% of these high-stakes races have been won by uncastrated male horses, colts or stallions.  (Until 1957 geldings were not allowed to run in the Belmont Stakes and that, due to the belief that fillies could not compete against colts, they were seldom entered into races in which primarily males ran.)
