Sonny Knowles (born on 2 November 1932 in Dublin, Ireland) is one of Ireland's most famous singers for six decades running.
He was born in Dublin to Tommy and Mary Knowles. His singing is centered around showband and cabaret tunes. His early career began when he stumbled upon the clarinet and saxophone at the Dublin Music School.  As a young man he joined the Johnny Butler Band followed by Earl Gill's Band, the Pacific Showband and then Dermot O'Brien's showband. His decision to go solo at the peak of the cabaret era, opened up his career. Sonny had two songs in the 1966 Irish National Song Contest scoring nil points with both songs and finishing in equal 10th with himself. The two songs were The Menace fron Ennis and a gaelic entry chuaigh me suas don chluiche mor and in the Irish final of 1971 Sonny would again score 0 points with his song an fhaid a mhairim
Sonny has twice survived scares with oesophageal cancer and after his most recent battle, has curtailed his lifestyle somewhat but still performs.
