Greensboro [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Greensboro.ogg|ˈ|ɡ|r|iː|n|z|b|ʌr|oʊ[/tpl]Dictionary.com (formerly Greensborough) is a city in the U.S. state of North Carolina. It is the third-largest city by population in North Carolina and the largest city in Guilford County and the surrounding Piedmont Triad metropolitan region. According to the 2012 U.S. Census Estimate, Greensboro's population is 277,080. It is located at the intersection of three major interstate highways (Interstate 85, Interstate 40 and Interstate 73) in the Piedmont region of central North Carolina.
In 2003, the previous Greensboro – Winston-Salem – High Point metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was re-defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, resulting in the formation of the Greensboro-High Point MSA and the Winston-Salem MSA. The 2010 population for the Greensboro-High Point MSA was 723,801. The Greensboro – Winston-Salem – High Point combined statistical area (CSA), popularly referred to as the Piedmont Triad, had a population of 1,599,477.
In 1808, Greensborough (as was the spelling prior to 1895) was planned around a central courthouse square to succeed the nearby town of Guilford Court House as the county seat. This act moved the county courts closer to the geographical center of the county, a location more easily reached by the majority of the county's citizens.

==History==

===Early history===

At the time of European encounter, the inhabitants of the area that became Greensboro were a Siouan-speaking people called the Saura.[tpl]cite book|author=Ethel Stephens Arnett|title=Greensboro, North Carolina: the county seat of Guilford|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qEATAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=November 8, 2012|year=1955|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|page=7[/tpl] Quaker immigrant settlers from Pennsylvania, by way of Maryland, arrived at Capefair, now Greensboro, in about 1750, and began organized religious services affiliated with the Cane Creek Friends Meeting in Snow Camp in 1751.[tpl]cite book|last=Hinshaw, William Wade|first=(Marshall, Thomas Worth, compiler)|title=Encyclopedia of American Quaker Genealogy, vol. 1|year=1936, 1991|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Co.|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=0806301783|pages=487–488|chapter=New Garden Monthly Meeting, Guilford County, NC[/tpl] Three years later, forty Quaker families were granted approval to establish New Garden Monthly Meeting. (The action is recorded in the minutes of the Perquimans and Little River Quarterly Meeting on May 25, 1754: "To Friends at New Garden in Capefair," signed by Joseph Ratliff.)[tpl]cite web|title=Quaker Meetings: Meetings In and Near Guilford County, "New Garden Monthly Meeting"|url=http://ncgenweb.us/nc/guilford/quaker-meetings/|work=Guilford County Carolina, NCGenWeb|publisher=NCGenWeb|accessdate=30 May 2013[/tpl] The settlement grew rapidly during the next three years adding members from as far away as Nantucket Island in Massachusetts. It soon became the most important Quaker community in the North Carolina, and mother of several other Quaker meetings that were established within the state and west of the Appalachians.
The city of Greensboro was named for Major General Nathanael Greene, commander of the American forces at the Battle of Guilford Court House on March 15, 1781.Arnett, Ethel Stephens. 20 Although the Americans lost the battle, Greene's forces inflicted heavy casualties on the British Army of General Charles Cornwallis. After the battle, Cornwallis withdrew his troops to a British base in Wilmington, North Carolina.[tpl]cite web|url=http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=10804&x=27&y=4 |title=The Glorious Cause of America – David McCullough |publisher=Speeches.byu.edu |date=2005-09-27 |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-revolution/4235 |title=The Battle of Guilford Courthouse - North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources |publisher=Learnnc.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl]
Greensboro was established near the geographic center of Guilford County, on land that was "an unbroken forest with thick undergrowth of huckleberry bushes, that bore a finely flavored fruit."Stockard, Sallie W. The History of Guilford County, North Carolina. Knoxville, Tennessee, 1902. p. 37 Property for the future village was purchased for $98, and three north-south streets (Greene, Elm, Davie) were laid out intersecting with three east-west streets (Gaston, Market, Sycamore).Arnett, Ethel Stephens. Greensboro, North Carolina; the County Seat of Guilford. Chapel Hill: UNC Press, 1955. pp. 171–174. p. 21 The courthouse stood at the center of the intersection of Elm and Market streets. By 1821, the town was home to 369 residents.
In the early 1840s, Greensboro was selected by the state government at the request of then Governor Morehead (whose estate, Blandwood, is located in Greensboro) for inclusion on a new railroad line. The city grew substantially in size and soon became known as the "Gate City" due to its role as a transportation hub for the state.Fripp, Gayle Hicks. Greensboro, a Chosen Center. Sun Valley, California: American Historical Press, 2001. p. 66 The railroads transported goods to and from textile mills, which grew up with their own mill villages around the city. Many of these businesses remained in the city until the 21st century, when most of them went bankrupt, reorganized, and/or merged with other companies. Greensboro remains as a major textile headquarters city with the main offices of International Textile Group (Cone, Burlington Industries), Galey & Lord, Unifi, and VF Corporation (Wrangler, Lee, The North Face, Nautica). The importance of rail traffic continues for the city, as Greensboro serves as a major regional freight hub, and four Amtrak passenger trains stop in Greensboro daily on the main Norfolk Southern line between Washington and New Orleans by way of Atlanta.
Though the city developed slowly, early wealth generated from cotton trade and merchandising led to the construction of several notable buildings. The earliest building, later named Blandwood Mansion and Gardens, was built in 1795. Additions to this residence in 1846 designed by Alexander Jackson Davis of New York City made the house an influential landmark in the nation as America's earliest Tuscan Villa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blandwood.org/blandwood.html|title=Blandwood, A national Historic Landmark, website[/tpl] Other significant estates followed, including "Dunleith" designed by Samuel Sloan, Bellemeade, and the Bumpass-Troy House (now operating as an inn).

===American Civil War and final days of the Confederacy===

Although Guilford County did not vote for secession, once North Carolina joined the Confederacy some citizens joined the Confederate cause, forming such infantry units as the Guilford Grays. From 1861 to March 1865 the city was relatively untouched by the American Civil War, with the exception of dealing with shortages of clothing, medicines, and other items caused by the US naval blockade of the South. However, in the final weeks of the war, Greensboro played a significant role. In April 1865 General P.G.T. Beauregard was instructed by the commanding officer of the Army of Tennessee, General Joseph E. Johnston, to prepare for a defense of the city. During this time, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and the remaining members of the Confederate cabinet had evacuated the Confederate Capital in Richmond, Virginia, and moved south to Danville, Virginia.
When Union cavalry threatened Danville, Davis and his cabinet managed to escape by train and reassembled in Greensboro on April 11, 1865. While in Greensboro, Davis and his cabinet decided to try to escape overseas to avoid capture by the victorious Union forces; they left Greensboro and separated. As such, Greensboro is notable as the last place the entire Confederate government met as a group, and Greensboro is thus the "final" capital city of the Confederacy.Robinson, Blackwell P., and Alexander R. Stoesen. The History of Guilford County, North Carolina, U.S.A. to 1980, A.D. Edited by Sydney M. Cone, Jr. 1981, p. 101  At nearly the same time, Governor Zebulon B. Vance fled the capital of North Carolina in anticipation of the arrival of Union General William Tecumseh Sherman.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070627031306/http://docsouth.unc.edu/global/getBio.html?type=bio&id=pn0001702&name=Vance,%20Zebulon |title=Biography of Zebulon Baird Vance |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl] For a brief period beginning April 16, 1865, the capital of North Carolina was maintained in Greensboro.Arnett, Ethel Stephens. Greensboro, North Carolina; the County Seat of Guilford. Chapel Hill: UNC Press, 1955. p395Weatherly, A. Earl. The First Hundred Years of Historic, Guilford County, 1771-1871. Greensboro: Greensboro Printing Company, 1972, p.177 Governor Vance proclaimed the North Carolina Surrender Declaration on April 28, 1865.Weatherly, A. Earl. The First Hundred Years of Historic, Guilford County, 1771-1871. Greensboro: Greensboro Printing Company, 1972, p.182 Later, Vance turned himself over to Union officials in the parlor of Blandwood Mansion. In the words of historian Blackwell Robinson, "Greensboro witnessed not only the demise of the Confederacy but also that of the old civil government of the state" of North Carolina.
After the negotiations were completed at Bennett Place, now in present day Durham, North Carolina, between General Johnston and General Sherman on April 26, 1865, Confederate soldiers stacked their arms and received their paroles in Greensboro, and then headed for home.

===Industrialization and growth===

In the 1890s, the city continued to attract attention from northern industrialists, including Moses and Caesar  Cone of Baltimore.Arnett, Ethel Stephens. Greensboro, North Carolina; the County Seat of Guilford. Chapel Hill: UNC Press, 1955. pp. 171–174. The Cone brothers established large-scale textile plants, changing Greensboro from a village to a city within a decade. By 1900, Greensboro was considered a center of the Southern textile industry, with large scale factories producing denim, flannel, and overalls.Fripp, Gayle Hicks. Greensboro, a Chosen Center. Woodland Hills, California: Windsor Publications, 1982. p. 59 Prosperity brought to the city through textiles resulted in the construction of notable twentieth century civic architecture, including the Guilford County Courthouse, West Market Street Methodist Church by S. W. Faulk, several buildings designed by Frank A. Weston, and UNCG's Main Building designed by Orlo Epps.
During the twentieth century, Greensboro continued to expand in wealth and population. Rapid growth led to construction of grand commercial and civic buildings, many of which remain standing today, designed by hometown architects Charles Hartmann and Harry Barton. Other notable industries became established in the city, including Vicks Chemical Co. (famous for over-the counter cold remedies such as VapoRub and NyQuil), Carolina Steel Corporation, and Pomona Terra Cotta Works.Robinson, Blackwell P., and Alexander R. Stoesen. The History of Guilford County, North Carolina, U.S.A. to 1980, A.D. Edited by Sydney M. Cone, Jr. 1981, p. 220 During this period of growth, Greensboro experienced an acute housing shortage. Builders sought to maintain a construction goal of 80 to 100 affordable housing units per year in order to provide homes for workers.Robinson, Blackwell P., and Alexander R. Stoesen. The History of Guilford County, North Carolina, U.S.A. to 1980, A.D. Edited by Sydney M. Cone, Jr. 1981, p. 209 Greensboro's real estate was considered "the wonder of the state" during the 1920s. Growth continued through the Great Depression, as Greensboro added an estimated 200 new families per year to its population.Robinson, Blackwell P., and Alexander R. Stoesen. The History of Guilford County, North Carolina, U.S.A. to 1980, A.D. Edited by Sydney M. Cone, Jr. 1981, p. 210 The city earned a reputation as a well-planned community, with a strong emphasis on education, parks, and a profitable employment base.
Prosperity brought new levels of development involving nationally and internationally known architects. Walter Gropius designed a factory building in the city in 1944.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blandwood.org/Gropius.html |title=Gropius |publisher=Blandwood.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl] Greensboro-based Ed Loewenstein contributed designs for projects throughout the region. Eduardo Catalano, and George Matsumoto both brought designs to the city that challenged North Carolinians with modernist architectural concepts and forms.

===Civil rights movement===

In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Greensboro's population as 74.0% white and 25.8% black.[tpl]cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html|accessdate=April 21, 2012[/tpl] As Greensboro evolved into one of North Carolina's primary cities, changes began to occur within its traditional social structure. On February 1, 1960, four black college students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College sat down at an all-white Woolworth's lunch counter, and refused to leave after they were denied service. The four students purchased small items in other parts of the store and kept their receipts, then sat down at the lunch counter and asked to be served. After being denied service, they produced their receipts and asked why their money was good everywhere else at the store, but not at the lunch counter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/topicalessays/busdesegsitins.aspx |title=Greensboro Sit-Ins at Woolworth's, February–July 1960 |publisher=Library.uncg.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl] Hundreds of others soon joined in this sit-in, which lasted several months. Such protests quickly spread across the South, ultimately leading to the desegregation of Woolworth's and other chains. The original lunch counter and stools where the four first sat are still in their original location, now home to the International Civil Rights Center and Museum (though a section of the counter is also on display at the Smithsonian).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Courage-at-the-Greensboro-Lunch-Counter.html |title=Courage at the Greensboro Lunch Counter | Arts & Culture | Smithsonian Magazine |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-11[/tpl] The museum opened on February 1, 2010, the 50th anniversary of the sit-ins.[tpl]cite web|author=Nancy H. McLaughlin |url=http://www.news-record.com/content/2010/02/01/article/countless_acts_of_heroism |title='Countless acts of heroism' : News-Record.com : Greensboro & the Triad's most trusted source for local news and analysis |publisher=News-Record.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-11[/tpl]
After the desegregation of Woolworth's and other minor concessions by Greensboro's white community, a brief period of patience and negotiation was followed by further protests in 1962 and 1963, culminating in the largest civil rights protest to take place in North Carolina history during May and June 1963. In addition to the desegregation of public accommodations, protestors sought economic and social justice, such as hiring policies based on merit and the integration of public schools. Marches of over 2,000 protesters per night took place in Greensboro's segregated central business district. William Thomas and A. Knighton Stanley, coordinators of Greensboro's local CORE chapter, invited Jesse Jackson, then a student at A&T to join the protests, and Jackson quickly rose to prominence as a student leader and public representative of the protest movement. To invoke arrest by violating segregation rules of local businesses, trespassing, and other non-violent breaches of the law, soon became a primary tactic of the protestors, especially among college and high school students. Seeking to overflow city jails and overburden municipal resources, at one point approximately 1,400 blacks occupied Greensboro's jails, which drew serious attention from both Greensboro's mayor and Governor of North Carolina Terry Sanford. In the end, the protests achieved gains toward racial equality in the form of further desegregation, reformed hiring policies in city government, and commitments to progress by Greensboro's mayor and Governor Sanford, who declared, "Anyone who hasn't received this message doesn't understand human nature." However, though these concessions helped build progressive momentum, significant change in race relations came about at a painfully slow pace, and verbal commitments from white leadership in 1963 proved to be more symbolic victories than substantial ones.William Chafe, Civilities and Civil Rights, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1980), 119–152.
In May 1969, A&T was involved in a second incident when the students of James B. Dudley High School appealed to them when a popular candidate for student union class president was refused, allegedly due to his position with Youth for the Unity of Black Society.[tpl]cite book|last=Waller|first=Signe|title=Love and Revolution: A Political Memoir : People's History of the Greensboro Massacre, Its Setting and Aftermath|date=1 November 2002|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-1365-5|page=49[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.library.ncat.edu/resources/archives/grimes.html | last=Bluford Library|title=Willie Grimes | publisher = North Carolina A&T University | accessdate = September 2, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=North Carolina Advisory Committee on Civil Rights|title=Trouble in Greensboro: A Report of an Open Meeting Concerning Disturbances at Dudley High School and North Carolina A&T State University|date=March 1970|url=http://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/item.aspx?i=38[/tpl] On May 21, after student protesters began throwing rocks and were confronted by police with tear gas canisters, an uprising led to gunfire exchanges between protesters, police and the National Guard. Escalating violence eventually led to the invasion of the A&T campus by what was described at the time as "the most massive armed assault ever made against an American university".[tpl]cite book|last=Biondi|first=Martha|title=The Black Revolution on Campus|date=2 July 2012|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-95352-9|page=158[/tpl] The uprising ended soon after the National Guard made a sweep of A&T college dormitories, taking hundreds of students into protective custody. A report released by the North Carolina State Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights found the National Guard invasion reckless and disproportionate to the actual danger, and criticized local community leaders for failing to help the Dudley High School students when the issues first emerged. They declared it "a sad commentary that the only group in the community who would take the Dudley students seriously were the students at A&T State University."
In spite of this period of progress, old wounds had yet to heal and prejudices continued. On November 3, 1979, members of the Communist Workers Party (CWP) were holding an anti-Ku Klux Klan rally, when two cars containing KKK supporters drove into the Morningside Heights neighborhood where the rally was being held and opened fire on the protest. Four local TV news stations filmed the event as it happened. A pistol was fired by a CWP organizer (allegedly into the air) and the Klan cars were beaten with sticks prior to the shooting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/topicalessays/GreensMassacre.aspx |title=Civil Rights Greensboro |publisher=Library.uncg.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-11[/tpl] Five of the anti-Klan demonstrators were killed and seven were wounded. Television footage of the event was shown nationwide and around the world, and the event became known as the Greensboro Massacre. In November 1980 six of the accused KKK supporters were all acquitted by an all-white jury after a week of deliberations.  In 1985, a civil suit found five police officers and two other individuals liable for $350,000 in damages to be paid to the Greensboro Justice Fund.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|109.2|sqmi|km2[/tpl], of which, [tpl]convert|104.7|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of it is land and [tpl]convert|4.5|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of it (4.16%) is water.
Greensboro is situated among the gently rolling hills of North Carolina's Piedmont and is situated midway between the state's Blue Ridge and Great Smoky mountains to the west and the Atlantic beaches and Outer Banks to the east. The view of the city from its highest building—the Lincoln Financial tower (commonly known as the Jefferson-Pilot Building)—reveals that the town is populated with large numbers of green trees, lending perhaps another dimension of significance to its name. The city is at the nexus of several major freeways, with Interstates 40, 85, and the planned I-73 passing through its borders.

===Cityscape===

Greensboro's earliest neighborhood is College Hill, located between West Market Street and Spring Garden Street, in and around Greensboro College.
Southside is among the oldest neighborhoods in the city and has experienced major redevelopment.
The Aycock and Fisher Park neighborhoods were established in 1895 and 1901, respectively. The Aycock neighborhood features large Queen Anne residences of the turn-of-the-twentieth century, as well as Foursquare, Craftsman, and Colonial Revival styles.
The Manchester Village, established in the early 1920s, was home to prominent business leaders and government officials. It was considered to be the most affluent neighborhood, with large estates that were destroyed in the late 1980s for commercial development.
Irving Park, developed in 1911 around the golf course of the Greensboro Country Club, was modeled on nearby Pinehurst by designer John Nolan. The prestigious neighborhood includes large homes on ample lots, and remains popular today.
Glenwood is a neighborhood that occupies the southwestern part of the city.  It is bordered by the Greensboro Coliseum, Lee St., and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.  Glenwood is a diverse neighborhood of 1970's ranch homes, smaller homes built in the 1950s, and subsidized housing.  The neighborhood has suffered decline over the past few years, but there are signs of renewal as UNC-Greensboro students and faculty move to the area adjacent to Lee St.
The Warnersville neighborhood was a once thriving area in south Greensboro. When Urban Renewal was initiated in the mid-1900s, most of the business and homes were destroyed and replaced with new roads and development. However, this area has not recovered still. Remnants of the once booming Ashe St. can be seen behind the Greensboro Urban Ministry on Eugene St.
The urbanization of Greensboro during the early twentieth century was influenced greatly by the popularity of the automobile, which enabled citizens to live farther from the city center in more suburban surroundings. A series of "streetcar suburbs" were established, including Glenwood, Hamilton Lakes, Lake Daniel, Latham Park, Lindley Park, O. Henry Oaks, Rankin, Starmount, Sunset Hills and Westerwood.  Many of these neighborhoods include some of the city's finest public parks. Recent neighborhood additions include sprawling large-scale planned unit developments such as Adams Farm, Lake Jeanette, The Cardinal, New Irving Park, and Reedy Fork Ranch.

===Downtown area===

Downtown Greensboro has experienced construction investment in recent years with developments such as NewBridge Bank Park, and residential developments and office construction. The Southside neighborhood downtown exemplifies central-city reinvestment as a formerly economically depressed neighborhood that has been redeveloped into an award-winning neotraditional-style neighborhood.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southsideneighborhood.com/ |title=Southside Neighborhood, Downtown Greensboro, North Carolina – Home |publisher=Southsideneighborhood.com |date=2009-11-22 |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl] Downtown Greensboro has an active nightlife with numerous nightclubs, bars and restaurants. The entire redevelopment of the downtown was aided by the 2006 opening of the Elon University School of Law.  The law school is credited with bringing student dollars to the downtown both day and at night.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elon.edu/e-net/Note.aspx?id=948081 |title=E-Net! News & Information |publisher=Elon.edu |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2012-08-11[/tpl]
Additional downtown attractions include: Elsewhere - a living museum and artist residency program set within a three-story former thrift store, the Carolina Theater, Triad Stage (Pyrle Gibson Theater), Blandwood Mansion, Center City Park, NewBridge Bank Park, Greensboro Historical Museum, Greensboro Cultural Center, the J. Douglas Galyon Transportation Depot, and the Greensboro Children's Museum. A multi-million dollar greenway loop around downtown is currently under construction. It will have walking paths, biking paths, parks, recreational facilities, outdoor classrooms, and art show spaces.  The project is being built in phases and could take 5 to 10 years to complete and will also connect with the greenway system throughout the city.
In addition, plans are underway for a 3,000 seat performing arts center which will be call the Steven Tanger Center for The Performing Arts. A 12-story Wyndham luxury hotel is being planned along with two other hotels. A joint downtown university campus called Union Square is also in the works.

===Four Seasons/Coliseum Area===

Located at 3121 High Point Road, the Four Seasons Town Centre is a multi building complex developed by the Koury Corporation. It includes multiple hotels, most prominently the Koury Convention tower and a shopping mall. Boasting over [tpl]convert|250000|sqft|m2|sigfig=1[/tpl] of flexible meeting space, the Joseph S. Koury Convention Center is the largest convention hotel between Atlanta, Georgia and Washington, D.C..  In 1990, the convention center opened next to the Holiday Inn Four Seasons (now Sheraton Four Seasons). In 1994 the 28 story triangular hotel tower was constructed atop the Koury Convention Center bringing the room total of the complex to well over 1,000. The Four Seasons Town Center mall sits just behind the convention center and is a popular shopping attraction for the entire Piedmont Triad.
The Greensboro Coliseum is located [tpl]convert|.9|mi|km[/tpl] down High Point Road. Many of the city's major events take place between the convention center and the coliseum. The Atlantic Coast Conference Hall of Champions, an $18.3 million aquatics center and amphitheater just recently opened on the site. The Greensboro Coliseum has hosted several major events in its history starting with the 1974 Men's NCAA Final Four Championship game. More recently the coliseum has hosted The U.S. Figure Skating Championships in 2011 and will host it again in 2015. The American Idol and X Factor televised auditions were also held at the Greensboro Coliseum.

===Airport area===

In 1998, FedEx chose to build and operate a $300 million mid-Atlantic air-cargo and sorting hub at Piedmont Triad International Airport, following an intensive competition for the hub among other regions of the state, as well as locations in South Carolina. After the hub announcement, the project faced court battles concerning potential noise and pollution abatements from neighborhoods located near the planned hub site. Nonetheless, the hub opened in 2009. Originally projected by proponents of the project to employee 750 people in its first two years of operation, and eventually 1,500, those jobs did not materialize and employment by FedEx at this location remains at nearly the same levels as prior to opening of the new facility.[tpl]cite web|last=Johnson |first=Paul |url=http://www.wxii12.com/Fedex-Hub-Employment-Remains-Stuck-In-Neutral/-/9678472/4462130/-/s8t7f7/-/index.html |title=Fedex Hub Employment Remains Stuck In Neutral | WXII Home - WXII Home |publisher=Wxii12.com |date=2011-08-18 |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://info.jctrans.com/jcnet/news/asn/20121111599217.shtml |title=FedEx's air cargo hub in Piedmont comes under fire as traffic declines-Air Shipping News-JCtrans |publisher=Info.jctrans.com |date=2012-11-01 |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl]
The world headquarters for Honda Aircraft Company as well as its jet assembly plant is also located at Piedmont Triad International Airport.

===Climate===

Greensboro, like much of the southeastern United States, has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), with four distinct seasons. Winters are short and generally cool, with a January daily average of [tpl]convert|38.9|°F|1[/tpl]. On average, there are 75 nights per year that drop to or below freezing,[tpl]efn|The normal window for freezing temperatures is November 2 thru April 4.[/tpl] and 4.3 days that fail to rise above freezing.[tpl]efn|Occasionally this never occurs in an entire winter or even calendar year; the last such occurrence was the winter of 2011–12 and 2012, respectively[/tpl] Measurable snowfall occurs nearly every winter, and accumulates to a normal of [tpl]convert|7.5|in|cm|1[/tpl], usually in January and February and occasionally December and March; the actual amount may vary considerably from winter to winter.[tpl]efn|Seasonal snowfall accumulation has ranged from [tpl]convert|32.5|in|cm|1|abbr=on[/tpl] in the winter of 1926–27 to zero in the following winter (1927–28). A trace of snow was recorded as recently as the winter of 1991–92.[/tpl] Cold air damming (CAD) can facilitate  freezing rain, often making it a more pressing concern than snow. Summers are hot and humid, with a daily average in July of [tpl]convert|78.5|°F|1[/tpl]. There is an average 32 days per year with highs at or above [tpl]convert|90|°F|0[/tpl], but, as in much of the Piedmont South, [tpl]convert|100|°F|0[/tpl]+ readings are uncommon. Autumn is similar to spring in temperature but has fewer days of rainfall and less total rainfall. Extremes in temperature have ranged from [tpl]convert|−8|°F|0[/tpl] on January 21, 1985 up to [tpl]convert|104|°F|0[/tpl], as recently as July 17, 1914.
Thunderstorms are common during the humid spring and summer months, some being severe in nature. On April 2, 1936, at around 7:00 pm, a large, F-4 tornado cut a seven-mile (11 km) swath of destruction through southern Greensboro. 14 people were killed and 144 were injured as the tornado moved through the city, including part of downtown. The storm was part of an outbreak known as the 1936 Cordele-Greensboro tornado outbreak. Strong tornadoes have struck the Greensboro area since then, notably Stoneville on March 20, 1998, Clemmons and Winston-Salem on May 5, 1989 and Clemmons and Greensboro on May 7, 2008, High Point, March 28, 2010.

==Demographics==
