==History==

The Seto service (written in hiragana as [tpl]Nihongo2|せと[/tpl]) commenced on 1 April 1950, as an "express" service operating between [tpl]Ja-stalink|Tokyo[/tpl] and [tpl]Ja-stalink|Uno[/tpl] in Okayama Prefecture.[tpl]cite book | title = 列車名鑑1995 |trans_title= Train Name Directory 1995| publisher = Railway Journal| date = August 1995 | location = Japan| page = 126| isbn = [/tpl] From 11 November 1956, the name was changed to kanji, written as [tpl]Nihongo2|瀬戸[/tpl]. From 15 March 1972, the train was upgraded to become a "limited express" service. In 1977, the 20 series sleeping cars were replaced by 24/25 series sleeping cars.
From 10 April 1988, the service was rerouted to operate between Tokyo and [tpl]Ja-stalink|Takamatsu||Kagawa[/tpl] in Kagawa Prefecture.
From the start of the revised timetable on 10 July 1998, the Seto services were discontinued and replaced by new 285 series electric multiple unit trains running as the Sunrise Seto together with the Sunrise Izumo.
