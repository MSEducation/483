Cultural sights
The 0,6 hectare(1.5 acres) market place, located in the center of town, is 18 m (59 ft) wide and 210 m (689 ft) long, approximating the typical ratio of 1:8. Many of the houses still have the typical arched gables. The Catholic parish church was rebuilt after the great fire of 1666, completed by 1670, and the steeple added 1695 to 1697. Immediately to the northwest of the Church lies the former monastery of the Teutonic Knights, a three winged structure, newly built in 1691 in the late baroque style.
Media
Two local newspapers are circulated in Gangkofen: The "Rottaler Anzeiger" (regional edition of the Passauer Neue Presse, PNP) has its editorial office in Eggenfelden, [tpl]convert|11|mi|km[/tpl] to the east. The Vilsbiburger Zeitung (belonging to the media group Landshuter Zeitung/Straubinger Tagblatt) is from Vilsbiburg, [tpl]convert|11|mi|km[/tpl] to the west. For years, an occasional competitive struggle for the patronage of the citizens of this community erupted between the two papers, but now the spoils seem divided and peace prevails.
