Neanderthal Museum is a museum in Mettmann, Germany. Located at the site of the first Neanderthal man discovery in the Neandertal, it features an exhibit centered on human evolution. The museum was constructed in 1996 to a design by architect Arno Brandlhuber and draws about 170,000 visitors per year. The museum also includes an archaeological park on the original discovery site, a Stone Age workshop, as well as an art trail named "human traces". All signs in the museum as well as the audio guide offered by the museum are available in German and English.

==History==

The architectural plan for the museum was chosen through a competition held in the spring of 1993 in which 130 participants from Germany and other countries participated. The design submitted by Professor Günter Zamp Kelp, Julius Krauss and Arno Brandlhuber was chosen as it represented the importance of the location.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.neanderthal.de/en/museum-valley/architecture/index.html|title= Architecture|accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum[/tpl] The museum was established on 10 October 1996 near the site where the renowned Neanderthal fossil was found.[tpl]Cite web|url= http://www.neanderthal.de/en/about-us/index.html|title= The Neanderthal Museum |accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum[/tpl] Its multimedia exhibition was upgraded in 2006.

==Exhibits==

The museum gives a background of the migration of people from the savannas to the modern cities with emphasis of Neanderthals. Their life size models are cast and exhibited on the basis of fossils excavated from archaeological sites.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.neanderthal.de/en/museum-valley/the-exhibition/tour/index.html|title=Museum and Valley:Take a tour around the Museum|accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum[/tpl] The exhibits are displayed in the four floors of the building which are interconnected through a spiraling ramp. At the beginning of the ramp, in the first section, there are exhibits on the history of the Neanderthal named "A valley and its Secret", which provides information on relics of the skeleton of the Neanderthal. The next exhibit, “A journey through time”, is about crucial stages of human history. Based on the main subject "Evolution of Humankind",  the thematic areas spread over five sections exhibit sequentially the "Life and Survival", "Tools and Knowledge", "Myth and Religion", Environment and Nourishment" and "Communication and Society".[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.neanderthal.de/en/museum-valley/the-exhibition/index.html|title= The Exhibition |accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum[/tpl]
The museum has a unique collection of casts of the original human fossils which represent the evolution of the hominids in general and that of the Neanderthals in particular. This cast collection, prepared on the basis of finds from various excavated sites in the world, was facilitated by the donations given by Alfred Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.neanderthal.de/en/education-research/cast-collection/index.html|title= Cast Collection|accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum[/tpl]
The museum also houses the NESPOS Society e.V. (Pleistocene People and Places) which provides an interactive database on all anthropological and archaeological data connected with the Neanderthals in the form of "3D–images of CT-Scans and surface scans, as well as high-resolution photographs of human fossils and artifacts”. Software, developed digitally by NESPOS on the basis of all fossil collections, is distributed freely, which includes scans of 600 fossils and artifacts from Belgium, Croatia, France and Germany.[tpl]Cite web|url= http://www.neanderthal.de/en/education-research/sammlungen/abgusssammlung/index.html|title=Human fossil cast collection|accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum[/tpl]
