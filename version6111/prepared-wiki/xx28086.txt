Xfce (pronounced as four individual letters[tpl]citation |title=Xfce FAQ |url=http://wiki.xfce.org/faq |accessdate=2007-01-06[/tpl]) is a free software desktop environment for Unix and Unix-like platforms, such as Linux, Solaris, and BSD. It aims to be fast and lightweight, while still being visually appealing and easy to use. It consists of separately packaged components that together provide the full functionality of the desktop environment, but which can be selected in subsets to create the user's preferred personal working environment.

==Features==

Xfce is based on the GTK+ 2 toolkit (like GNOME 2). It uses the Xfwm window manager, described below. Its configuration is entirely mouse-driven, with the configuration files hidden from the casual user.
It is possible to run Xfce with 40 MB of memory using Alpine Linux.[tpl]citation |url=https://kmandla.wordpress.com/2010/12/02/also-not-a-joke-xfce-on-39mb/ |title=Also not a joke: XFCE on 39 MB |publisher=Kmandla.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-04[/tpl]

==History==

Olivier Fourdan started the project in 1996.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.slashgear.com/xfce-creator-talks-linux-moblin-netbooks-and-open-source-0633329/ |title=Xfce creator talks Linux, Moblin, netbooks and open-source |last=Then |first=Ewdison |date=6 February 2009 |publisher=SlashGear |accessdate=5 February 2011[/tpl] The name "Xfce" originally stood for "XForms Common Environment", but since that time Xfce has been rewritten twice and no longer uses the XForms toolkit. The name survived, but it is no longer capitalized as "XFCE", but rather as "Xfce". The developers' current stance is that the initialism no longer stands for anything specific. It has been nicknamed "Cholesterol Free Desktop Environment",[tpl]citation |url=http://en.opensuse.org/Xfce |title=Xfce - openSUSE[/tpl][tpl]citation |url=http://linux.about.com/cs/linux101/g/xfce.htm |title=What is xfce[/tpl] even in some of its man pages.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.digipedia.org/man/doc/view/xfce.1/ |title=man - xfce (1) - The Cholesterol Free Desktop Environment[/tpl]

===Early versions===

Xfce began as a simple project created with XForms, meant to be a free Linux clone of CDE. Fourdan released the program, a simple toolbar, to ibiblio (then "SunSITE").[ref]

Fourdan continued developing the project, and in 1998, Xfce 2 was released with the first version of Xfce's window manager, Xfwm. He requested to have the project included in Red Hat Linux, but was refused because the project was based on XForms. Red Hat only accepted software that was open source and released under either a GPL compatible or BSD compatible license, but, at the time, XForms was closed source and free only for personal use. For the same reason, Xfce was not in Debian before version 3. Xfce 2 was only distributed in Debian's contrib component.Debian xfce source package 3.4.0.20000513-1 changelog
In March 1999 Fourdan began a complete rewrite of the project based on GTK+, a non-proprietary toolkit whose popularity was increasing. The result was Xfce 3.0, which was licensed under the GNU GPL. Along with being based completely on free software, the project gained GTK+'s drag-and-drop support, native language support, and improved configurability. Xfce was uploaded to SourceForge.net in February 2001, starting with version 3.8.1.[tpl]citation |title=SourceForge.net Project Page |work= |url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/xfce/ |accessdate=2007-01-31[/tpl]

===Modern Xfce===

In version 4.0.0, released [tpl]date|2003-09-25[/tpl], Xfce was upgraded to use the GTK+ 2 libraries.http://unixresources.net/linux/clf/software/archive/00/00/44/51/445169.html Changes in 4.2.0 included a compositing manager for Xfwm which added built-in support for transparency and drop shadows, as well as a new default SVG icon set.[tpl]citation |title=Xfce 4.2.0 Changelog |url=http://www.xfce.org/documentation/changelogs/4.2.0 |accessdate=2007-01-31[/tpl] In January 2007, Xfce 4.4.0 was released. This included the Thunar file manager, a replacement for Xffm. Support for desktop icons was added. Also, various improvements were made to the panel to prevent buggy plugins from crashing the whole panel.[ref]
[tpl]citation |last=Meurer |first=Benedikt |title=A Visual Tour of Xfce 4.4.0 |date=2007-01-21 |url=http://foo-projects.org/~benny/articles/xfce44-visual-tour.html |accessdate=2007-01-31[/tpl][/ref] In February 2009 Xfce 4.6.0 was released. This version had a new configuration backend, a new settings manager and a new sound mixer, as well as several significant improvements to the session manager and the rest of Xfce's core components.[tpl]citation |author=Xfce Development Team |title=Xfce 4.6.0 Changelog |url=http://www.xfce.org/download/changelogs/4.6.0/ |accessdate=2011-01-16[/tpl]
In January 2011, Xfce 4.8.0 was released. This version included changes such as the replacement of  ThunarVFS and HAL with GIO, udev, ConsoleKit and PolicyKit, and new utilities for browsing remote network shares using several protocols including SFTP, SMB, and FTP. Window clutter was reduced by merging all file progress dialog boxes into a single dialog. The panel application was also rewritten for better positioning, transparency, item and launcher management. 4.8 also introduced a new menu plugin to view directories. The 4.8 plugin framework remains compatible with 4.6 plugins. The display configuration dialog in 4.8 supports RandR 1.2, detecting screens automatically and allowing users to pick their preferred display resolution, refresh rate and display rotation. Screens can be configured to either work in clone mode or being placed next to each other. Keyboard selection has become easier and more user-friendly. Also, the manual settings editor has been updated to be more functional.[tpl]citation |author=Xfce Development Team |title=Xfce 4.6.0 Changelog |url=http://www.xfce.org/download/changelogs/4.8.0/ |accessdate=2011-01-16[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl]
The 4.8 development cycle was the first to use the new release strategy formed after the "Xfce Release and Development Model" developed at the Ubuntu Desktop Summit in May 2009. A new web application was employed to make release management easier, and a dedicated Transifex server was set up for Xfce translators.[tpl]citation |url=http://blog.xfce.org/category/transifex/ |title=The little mouse told me… |publisher=Blog.xfce.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-04[/tpl] The project's server and mirroring infrastructure was also upgraded, partly to cope with anticipated demand following the release announcement for 4.8.
Xfce 4.10, released April 28 2012, introduced a vertical display mode for the panel and moved much of the documentation to an online wiki http://docs.xfce.org. The main focus of this release was on improving the user experience.[tpl]cite web|url=http://xfce.org/about/news|title=Xfce 4.10 released[/tpl]

==Software components==

Xfce has forked only a couple of the GNOME Core Applications and written most from scratch. Applications developed by the Xfce team are based on GTK+ and Clutter and self developed Xfce libraries.
Xfce provides a development framework which contains the following components:
Other than Xfce itself, there are third-party programs which use the Xfce libraries, such as the Xfce Terminal (xfce4-terminal, former Terminal). One of the services provided to applications by the framework is a red banner across the top of the window when the application is running with root privileges warning the user that they could damage system files.

===Xfwm===

Starting with version 4.2, Xfwm integrates its own compositing manager.[tpl]cite web|title=Xfce window manager now includes its own compositing manager|url=http://blog.xfce.org/2004/10/xfce-window-manager-now-includes-its-own-compositing-manager/|publisher=Xfce Blog|accessdate=20 December 2012[/tpl]

===Thunar===

Thunar is the default file manager for Xfce, replacing Xffm. It resembles GNOME's Nautilus and is designed for speed and a low memory footprint[tpl]citation |url=http://thunar.xfce.org/pwiki/articles/memory_usage |title=ThunarWiki: Thunar in comparison to Nautilus, ROX, Konqueror and Xffm |publisher=Thunar.xfce.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-04[/tpl] as well as being highly customizable through plugins. Xfce also has a lightweight archive manager called Xarchiver, but this is not part of the core Xfce 4.4.0.[tpl]citation |title=4.4.0 release status so far |url=http://foo-projects.org/pipermail/xfce4-dev/2007-January/022198.html[/tpl]
More recently, Squeeze has been started as an archive manager designed to integrate better into the Xfce desktop, though no further updates have been released since 24 February 2008,[tpl]citation |title=Squeeze - news |url=http://squeeze.xfce.org/news[/tpl] the development git branch for both squeeze and xarchiver are more up to date and feature rich than the last stable release.

===Orage===

Starting with version 4.4, Xfcalendar was renamed to Orage and several features were added. Orage has alarms and uses the iCalendar format, making it compatible with many other calendar applications. It also includes a panel clock plugin and an international clock application capable of simultaneously showing clocks from several different time zones.

===Leafpad===

Leafpad is the default  text editor for Xfce in many Linux distributions, including Xubuntu.Xubuntu 11.10 Officially Released. News.softpedia.com (2011-10-13). Retrieved on 2013-07-17. At one point Xubuntu and some other Xfce-based distributions switched to a fork of Leafpad called Mousepad, developed by Erik Harrison and Nick Schermer to provide printing support and Xfce integration, [tpl]citation |url=http://www.xfce.org/projects/mousepad/ |title=Xfce - Mousepad |publisher=Xfce Project |accessdate=2009-02-22[/tpl] but Leafpad gained printing support in version 0.8.11.leafpad/ChangeLog at master · oluc/leafpad · GitHub. Github.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-17. 
Latest version of Mousepad is 0.3.0, and is considered part of xfce4-goodies in many distributions.

===Parole===

Parole is a media player that is based on the GStreamer framework. It is developed by Ali Abdallah and is part of the Xfce Goodies.[tpl]citation |title=Juste une parole (Xfce Goodies) |url=http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/applications/parole[/tpl] It originally was only playlist based, but now includes an option to replace the entire playlist when opening a file for playing.[tpl]citation |title=parole - GStreamer based media player |url=http://git.xfce.org/apps/parole/commit/?id=61df0aef193f67047bf130e4adb13bff32eab4d9[/tpl]
