Black Dog Halt was opened on 3 November 1863 by the Great Western Railway for Lord Lansdowne of Bowood House. Lord Lansdowne had a special compartment in one of the Calne line's autocoaches. Later he was persuaded to allow the halt to be used by the public.  After the British Rail takeover the halt was turned into a request stop.
In 1965 the halt was closed and soon the buildings were demolished. Today the site of the halt is being used as part of the national cycle route.
