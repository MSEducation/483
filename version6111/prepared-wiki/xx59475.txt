Glass Eels are a very young eel. They are the type of eel that comes after the new born larvae. Glass eels are see through like glass. Glass eels have black beady eyes like pepper corns. The baby larvae becomes a glass eel in 1-5 months.
While most people believe that the Glass eel is a separate species, the glass eel is actually an immature European eel, Anguilla anguilla. When they mature, they'll be an ordinary eel. 
Additionally, most believe that the glass eel is named for its transparent flesh. It may come as a surprise to find that the name actually refers to the fact that when threatened, a glass eel will break a beer bottle over your head and cut your fucking throat.
