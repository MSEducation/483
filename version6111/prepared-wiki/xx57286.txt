Douglas James Henning (May 3, 1947 – February 7, 2000) was a Canadian magician, illusionist, escape artist and politician.

==Early life==

Henning was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, began practicing magic at Oakenwald School in Fort Garry, and later moved to Oakville, Ontario.
He performed his first show at the age of 14 at the birthday party of a friend and was inspired by his audience's spellbound reaction. Within a few months of placing an ad in a local newspaper, Henning launched a series of performances on local television in Toronto, and as an entertainer at parties.

He was a student at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario and studied psychology. Henning met Ivan Reitman there when he appeared in the 1968 Reitman-directed production of Li'l Abner in the role of Lonesome Polecat.Source: original McMaster production playbill[tpl]Nonspecific|date=July 2011[/tpl]

==Career==

Shortly after university, Henning was awarded a Canada Council for the Arts grant. The terms of the grant required Henning to study magic. He did so, traveling to view first hand the talents of such magic greats as Slydini and Dai Vernon. Doug studied under Tony Slydini and considered him his primary teacher of magic.
With the intention of returning magic to its “glory days”, Henning worked to perfect his craft. Garnering financial support, he developed a live theatrical show, Spellbound, directed by Ivan Reitman, with music by Howard Shore and co-starring actress Jennifer Dale, a musical that combined a dramatic story and Henning's magic tricks. The show opened in Toronto, where it broke box-office records. Henning reworked the show after catching the attention of New York producers, and took it to Broadway as The Magic Show, with songs composed by Stephen Schwartz. Debuting in 1974, the show ran for four and a half years, and earned Henning a Tony Award nomination.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1975 |title=1975 Tony Award Winners |publisher=BroadwayWorld.con |accessdate=January 10, 2012[/tpl]
Following his Broadway success, Henning approached NBC with the idea of producing a television special. It wasn't until Henning suggested that he would reproduce live Harry Houdini's famous and dangerous water-torture escape — for the first time since Houdini performed it himself — that the NBC executives signed him.
Henning spent the next eight months reworking his stage act for TV and practicing the water-torture escape act. More than 50 million viewers tuned in for the December 1975 broadcast of Doug Henning's World of Magic, hosted by Bill Cosby.  Henning successfully performed the water torture illusion, although he did not break Houdini's time record.  The event was the first of seven annual broadcasts, which would eventually bring Henning seven"Magician Doug Henning Dies of Liver Cancer at 52" Los Angeles Times; February 9, 2000.

At the end of each World of Magic performance, Henning addressed the audience with the same monologue: "Anything the mind can conceive is possible. Nothing is impossible. All you have to do is look within, and you can realize your fondest dreams. I would like to wish each one of you all of life's wonders and a joyful age of enlightenment."[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070218045811/http://www.goodbyemag.com/jan00/henning.html|url=http://www.goodbyemag.com/jan00/henning.html|title=Doug Henning: Magician Addled by TM|publisher=Good Bye!: The Journal of Contemporary Obituaries|date=January 2000|archivedate=February 18, 2007[/tpl]
