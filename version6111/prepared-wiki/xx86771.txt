Mushroom Peak is a mountain located in the Sunwapta River valley of Alberta, Canada's Jasper National Park, lying just over a kilometre east of Diadem Peak. The mountain was named in 1947 by N.E. Odell who made the first ascent (solo). Upon reaching the summit, he found that the dark limestone rocks on top resembled mushrooms.
