 At the [tpl]F1 GP|1994|British[/tpl], Schumacher was penalised for overtaking on the formation lap. He then ignored the penalty and the subsequent [[Racing flag#The black flag|black flag]], which indicates that the driver must immediately return to the pits, for which he was disqualified and later given a two-race ban. Benetton blamed the incident on a communication error between the stewards and the team.<ref>
