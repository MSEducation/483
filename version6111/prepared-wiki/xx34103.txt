==History==

In the first days of Baldwin County, the town of McIntosh Bluff (now in Mobile County, west of Baldwin County) on the Tombigbee River was the county seat. After being transferred to the town of Blakeley in 1810, the county seat was later moved to the city of Daphne in 1868. In 1900, by an act of the legislature of Alabama, the county seat was authorized for relocation to the city of Bay Minette; however, the city of Daphne resisted relocation. The citizens of Bay Minette moved the county records from Daphne in the middle of the night on October 11–12, 1901[tpl]cite book | title = Images of America: Baldwin County | author = John C.

In September 2011, the town attempted to enact a program called "Operation Restore Our Community". It would have allowed those convicted of a misdemeanor to substitute imprisonment with mandatory church attendance for one year.[tpl]cite news| title=Ala. town's criminals get choice: Jail or church| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/23/national/main20110680.shtml| accessdate=24 September 2011| newspaper=CBS News| date=23 September 2011[/tpl] However, this program was challenged due to violating separation of church and state, and the program's start was delayed for judicial review.Cox, Carmen.
