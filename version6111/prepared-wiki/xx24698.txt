Tour Maine-Montparnasse (Maine-Montparnasse Tower), also commonly named Tour Montparnasse, is a [tpl]convert|210|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] office skyscraper located in the Montparnasse area of Paris, France. Constructed from 1969 to 1973, it was the tallest skyscraper in France until 2011, when it was surpassed by the [tpl]convert|231|m|abbr=on[/tpl] Tour First. [tpl]as of|2013|June[/tpl], it is the 14th tallest building in the European Union. The tower was designed by architects Eugène Beaudouin, Urbain Cassan and Louis Hoym de Marien and built by Campenon Bernard.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Tour Montparnasse | url=http://www.vinci.com/vinci.nsf/en/history-sites.htm?OpenAgent&montparnasse_tower | work=Vinci  | year=2012 | accessdate=1 August 2012[/tpl]

==Location==

Built on top of the Montparnasse – Bienvenüe Paris Métro station, the 59 floors of the tower are mainly occupied by offices. The 56th floor, with a restaurant called le Ciel de Paris,le Ciel de Paris and the terrace on the top floor, are open to the public for viewing the city. In April 2012, the 56th floor and the restaurant were closed for renovations but reopened in June 7, 2012;[tpl]cite web|title=Official website|url=http://www.tourmontparnasse56.com/index_EN.php#/visite/etage_panoramique[/tpl]  the terrace remains open to the public. The view covers a radius of [tpl]convert|40|km|abbr=on[/tpl]; aircraft can be seen taking off from Orly Airport. The guard rail, to which various antennae are attached, can be pneumatically lowered in just two minutes to allow helicopters to land. At the time of construction, it was the tallest building in Europe by roof height. The construction of La Grande Arche in La Défense places the tower in a second line of perspective across Paris: see Axe historique.

==Criticism==

The tower's simple architecture, large proportions and monolithic appearance have been often criticized for being out of place in Paris's urban landscape.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] As a result, two years after its completion the construction of buildings over seven stories high in the city center was banned.[tpl]cite web|last=Laurenson |first=John |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22811518 |title=BBC News - Does Paris need new skyscrapers? |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=2013-06-18 |accessdate=2013-06-18[/tpl]
The design of the tower predates architectural trends of more modern skyscrapers today that are often designed to provide a window for every office. Only the offices around the perimeter of each floor of Tour Montparnasse have windows.
It is said that the view from the top is the most beautiful in Paris, because it is the only place from which the tower cannot be seen.[tpl]cite news | author=Nicolai Ouroussoff | title= Architecture, Tear Down These Walls | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/arts/design/28ouro.html | work=New York Times | date=26 September 2008  | accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl]
A 2008 poll of editors on Virtualtourist voted the building the second-ugliest building in the world.[tpl]cite news | author=Belinda Goldsmith| title=Travel Picks: 10 top ugly buildings and monuments | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE4AD2V720081114 | work=Reuters  | date= 14 November 2008 | accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl]

==Climbing the tower==

In 1995, French urban climber, Alain "Spiderman" Robert, using only his bare hands and feet and with no safety devices of any kind, scaled the building's exterior glass and steel wall to the top, almost falling in the process.

==Asbestos contamination==

In 2005, studies showed that the tower contained  asbestos material. When inhaled, for instance during repairs, asbestos is a carcinogen. As with the Jussieu Campus, the problem of removing the asbestos material from a large building used by thousands of people is acute. Projected completion times for removal are three years if the building is emptied for the duration of the work and ten years if the building is not emptied. The removal of asbestos began in July 2007.
