==History==

After releasing their debut single "Terry" on the indie Noisebox Records label in the UK they were signed to The Police manager Miles Copeland III's Ark21 label for the release of their debut album Moustache. The album was released in the UK, USA, Europe and Japan and saw the band tour the world extensively to support it. When Ark21 shut down operation in the UK, their second album Me Too was released on various independent labels throughout the world.
Farrah have maintained their independent status ever since. Recording at their own South London recording studio, producing their own videos and managing their online presence.
In addition to developing a harder rock sound, Me Too incorporated more diverse elements into their sound while still remaining true to the lyrically quirky 3-minute, harmony-laden, melody-driven power pop sound of Moustache.
In late 2006 Farrah completed their third album, Cut Out and Keep. It was released in 2007 in the UK, Spain and Japan and accompanied by a world tour.
Since early 2007, Farrah has been working with the Japanese pop rock artist Kaela Kimura. They have so far composed two songs for her, and she has covered their song, "No Reason Why". One of Japan's leading rock bands, Asian Kung-Fu Generation has invited Farrah to appear at their own Nano-Mugen Festival on 2 occasions, most recently in 2009.
In 2009 they released their self-titled fourth full length album in Japan. The band now features former Cotton Mather drummer Dana Myzer in its lineup. The album (with a slightly different track listing ) was then release in the rest of the world in May 2010.
Lead vocalist and principal songwriter Jez Ashurst has also written songs recorded by numerous artists including Gabrielle Aplin, Boyzone, Will Young, The Click Five, Natalie Bassingthwaighte, Brian McFadden, Hanson and Cliff Richard.  Farrah co-founder Andrew Campbell also owns and runs the indie record label Lojinx.
On November 15, 2011, the band included a cover of Europe's "The Final Countdown" on Engine Room Recordings new compilation album, Guilt by Association Vol. 3.
