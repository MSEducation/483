There are a few legends of the first Aboriginal jockey to ride a Melbourne Cup. It was believed to be John Cutts who won the first and second cups in 1861 and 1862 riding Archer. He was reputedly an Aboriginal stockman born in the area where Archer was trained, but was actually John 'Cutts' Dillon, the son of a Sydney clerk, a jockey who rode for many trainers in his long career, and who was one of the best known, best liked and most respected jockeys in New South Wales.The Masters Touch, Racing with Etienne de Mestre, Winner of 5 Melbourne Cups by Keith W. Paterson, Published by Keith W. Paterson Nowra (2008) (ISBN 9780646500287), Page 46  It is thought that Peter St. Albans was the first Aboriginal jockey to win the cup, on Briseis in 1876. Because St. Albans was not quite 13 years old, the jockey was too young to ride in the cup. Thus, to allow him to race Briseis in the Cup, it was argued his birthdate and parents were unknown, and from this the legend of him being Aboriginal grew.[tpl]cite web|author=Race May 13th 2008 09:34 |url=http://www.racingwrite.com/aboriginal-jockeys-who-won-melbourne-cup/ |title=Aboriginal jockeys who won Melbourne Cup |publisher=Racingwrite.com |date=2008-05-13 |accessdate=2014-02-01[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/31/1099219993619.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=The wonder filly and a boy who carved their names into history | date=1 November 2004[/tpl] Both these legends, however, can definitely be disproved, and history had to wait nearly another 100 years.

===Recent years===

The race has undergone several alterations in recent years, the most visible being the entry of many foreign-trained horses. Most have failed to cope with the conditions; the three successful "foreign raids" include two by Irish trainer Dermot K. Weld successful in 1993 and 2002,http://www.racingvictoria.net.au/Racing/race.aspx?meet_code=383411&race_code=523106 and one in 20062006 Melbourne Cup result by Katsumi Yoshida of Japan's renowned Yoshida racing and breeding family. The attraction for foreigners to compete was, primarily, the low-profile change to the new "quality handicap" weighting system.
The 1910 Melbourne Cup was won by Comedy King, the first foreign bred horse to do so. 
Subsequent foreign bred horses to win Cup were Backwood 1924; Phar Lap 1930; Wotan 1936 Belldale Ball 1980; At Talaq 1986; Kingston Rule 1990; Vintage Crop 1993; Jeune 1994; Media Puzzle 2002; Makybe Diva 2003, 2004, 2005; Americain 2010 and Dunaden 2011.

In 2004, Makybe Diva2004 Melbourne Cup result2005 Melbourne Cup result became the first mare to win two cups, and also the first horse to win with different trainers, after David Hall moved to Hong Kong and transferred her to the Lee Freedman stables.
The 2005 Melbourne Cup was held before a crowd of 106,479. Makybe Diva made history by becoming the only horse to win the race three times. Trainer Lee Freedman said after the race,  "Go and find the youngest child on the course, because that's the only person here who will have a chance of seeing this happen again in their lifetime."
Due to the 2007 Australian Equine influenza outbreak, believed to have been started by a horse brought into Australia from Japan, neither Delta Blues nor Pop Rock participated in the 2007 Melbourne Cup. Both horses had been stabled in Japan. Corowa, NSW trained "Leica Falcon" also was not be permitted to race in Victoria, despite Corowa being close to the Victorian border. Leica Falcon was ordained as the new staying star of Australian racing in 2005 when he ran fourth in both the Caulfield Cup and in Makybe Diva's famous third Melbourne Cup victory. But serious leg injuries saw the horse not race for another 20 months.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/27/sports/AS-SPT-RAC-Australia-Influenza.php |title=Japanese horses unlikely to travel to Australia for Melbourne Cup because of equine influenza |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=26 August 2007 |accessdate=27 August 2007[/tpl] Efficient, the previous year's VRC Derby winner, won the race.

===Timeline of historical events===

===Public holiday===

Melbourne Cup day is a public holiday for all working within metropolitan Melbourne and some parts of regional Victoria, but not for some country Victorian cities and towns which hold their own spring carnivals. For Federal Public Servants it is also observed as a holiday in the entire state of Victoria, and from 2007 to 2009 also in the Australian Capital Territory known as Family and Community Day replacing Picnic Day.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200704/s1891417.htm|title=ACT workers to get Melbourne Cup day off[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]
As early as 1865, Cup day was a half-holiday in Melbourne for public servants and bank officials. Various businesses also closed at lunchtime.
It took some years before the purpose of the declared holiday was acknowledged in the Victoria Government Gazette. The Gazette of 31 October 1873[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/vic_gazette/1873/77.html|title=Victoria Government Gazette 31 October 1873[/tpl]  announced that the following Thursday (Cup Day) be observed as a bank and civil (public) service holiday.[tpl]cite web|url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/melbournecup|title= Melbourne Cup Research Guide[/tpl]

The event is one of the most popular spectator events in Australia, with sometimes over 110,000 people, some dressed in traditional formal raceday wear and others in all manner of exotic and amusing costumes, attending the race. The record crowd was 122,736 in 2003. The 1926 running of the Cup was the first time that the 100,000 mark had been passed. Today the record at Flemington is held by the 2006 Victoria Derby when almost 130,000 attended.
In 2007, a limit was placed on the Spring Carnival attendance at Flemington Racecourse and race-goers are now required to pre-purchase tickets.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/18/1981332.htm|title=Spring Carnival crowd numbers to be capped[/tpl]

'Fashions On The Field' is a major focus of the day, with substantial prizes awarded for the best-dressed man and woman. The requirement for elegant hats, and more recently the alternative of a fascinator, almost single-handedly keeps Melbourne's milliners in business.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl] Raceday fashion has occasionally drawn almost as much attention as the race itself, The miniskirt received worldwide publicity when model Jean Shrimpton wore one on Derby Day during Melbourne Cup week in 1965.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Fashion/Flair-features-fashions-fabulous-and-fickle/2005/02/03/1107409993143.html |title='Flair' features fashion's fabulous and fickle |publisher=The Age |date=5 February 2005 | location=Melbourne[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/miniskirt/features/the-miniskirt-and-womens-lib |title=Icons of England: The Miniskirt and Women's Lib |publisher=Icons.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01[/tpl]
Flowers, especially roses are an important component of the week's racing at Flemington. The racecourse has around 12,000 roses within its large expanse. Over 200 varieties of the fragrant flower are nurtured by a team of up to 12 gardeners. Each of the major racedays at Flemington has an official flower. Victoria Derby Day has the Corn Flower, Melbourne Cup Day is for the Yellow Rose, Oaks Day highlights the Pink Rose and Stakes Day goes to the Red Rose.
In the Melbourne metropolitan area, the race day has been a gazetted public holiday since 1877, but around both Australia and New Zealand a majority of people watch the race on television and gamble, either through direct betting or participating in workplace cup "sweeps". As of April 2007, the ACT also recognises Melbourne Cup Race Day as a holiday.
