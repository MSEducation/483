Congressional oversight on monetary policy operations, foreign transactions, and the
FOMC operations is exercised through the requirement for reports and through semi-annual monetary policy hearings. Scholars have conceded that the hearings did not prove an effective means of increasing oversight of the Federal Reserve, perhaps because "Congresspersons prefer to bash an autonomous and secretive Fed for economic misfortune rather than to share the responsibility for that misfortune with a fully accountable Central Bank," although the Federal Reserve has also consistently lobbied to maintain its independence and freedom of operation.[ref]

====Fulfillment of wider economic goals====

By law, the goals of the Fed's monetary policy are: high employment, sustainable growth, and stable prices.[ref]

Critics say that monetary policy in the United States has not achieved consistent success in meeting the goals that have been delegated to the Federal Reserve System by Congress. Congress began to review more options with regard to macroeconomic influence beginning in 1946 (after World War II), with the Federal Reserve receiving specific mandates in 1977 (after the country suffered a period of stagflation).
Throughout the period of the Federal Reserve following the mandates, the relative weight given to each of these goals has changed, depending on political developments.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl] In particular, the theories of Keynesianism and monetarism have had great influence on both the theory and implementation of monetary policy, and the "prevailing wisdom" or consensus view of the economic and financial communities has changed over the years.http://books.google.com/books?id=DktBcxprXaEC Allan H.
