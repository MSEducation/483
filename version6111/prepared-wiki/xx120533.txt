KVCT is a television station in Victoria, Texas, broadcasting locally on digital channel 11 (virtual channel 19) as a Fox affiliate.
KVCT is part of a combo of six Victoria-area television stations owned by Saga Communications, anchored by KAVU-TV.  As a result, it broadcasts a KAVU-produced 9 p.m. newscast each night.

==History==

In Fall 1969, the station went on the air as KXIX, an affiliate of ABC. It was originally a satellite of KIII in Corpus Christi. In 1976, channel 19 was sold to local ownership and became a separate station.
In 1984, the call letters were changed to KVCT. Financial problems eventually led to the station dropping the ABC affiliation and dissolving its news operation in 1990, becoming a religious station, as an affiliate of the TBN network.

In 1994 it entered into a local marketing agreement with KAVU-TV and became a Fox affiliate. Before then, the network was available on cable via either KRIV in Houston or KRRT (now KMYS) in San Antonio. KAVU also periodically produced newscasts for the station.  After an attempt in 1998, local news was not seen on KVCT until 2002, when the current newscast debuted.  Saga Communications, KAVU's owner, eventually bought channel 19 outright.
