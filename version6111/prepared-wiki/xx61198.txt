BBC Radio 6 Music is one of the BBC's digital radio stations. It was known officially as BBC 6 Music from its launch on 11 March 2002 until April 2011.BBC, "BBC Radio 6 Music Programmes – Radcliffe and Maconie, With Guy Garvey, Cerys Matthews and Jarvis Cocker", 4 April 2011. Retrieved 15 December 2011. 6 Music was the first national music radio station to be launched by the BBC in 32 years.BBC 6 Music pre-release website – archived website from 15 February 2002. "Stand by for the BBC's first new national music radio station in 32 years" It is available only on digital media: DAB radio, the Internet, digital television, and in northern Europe through the Astra 2B satellite.
Often referred to as the sister station of BBC Radio 2, it shares common features and DJs with both BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2. For instance, it operates a playlist of similar 'A/B/C' structure to both Radios 1 and 2[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/playlist/|title=Radio 1 playlist|publisher=BBC[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/playlist/|title=Radio 2 playlist|publisher=BBC[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/listen/playlist.shtml|title=6 Music playlist|publisher=BBC[/tpl] and regularly shares selective tracks on its 'A' playlist with both stations, although it is generally less reliant upon chart music than the more mainstream stations.
Evening and weekend programming, however, features a more diverse selection of tracks across genres both popular and on the fringes, with dedicated shows towards different forms of dance, jazz, soul, and Jamaican music, among others. The station also features performances from the BBC music archives, including the "Peel Sessions" put together by John Peel from the late 1960s to 2004.
In July 2010, the BBC Trust announced it had rejected a proposal by the BBC to close 6 Music to provide commercial rivals more room.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8544150.stm|title=BBC 6 Music and Asian Network face axe in shake-up |date=2 March 2001|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 March 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100303054531/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8544150.stm| archivedate= 3 March 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The Trust commented that the station was "well-liked by its listeners, was highly distinctive and made an important contribution."BBC Trust Strategic Review Interim Conclusions Retrieved 5 July 2010 6 Music is the most listened to BBC digital radio station with an average weekly audience of 1.9 million.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/jan/31/radio-1-loses-500000-nick-grimshaw-rajar|title=Radio 1 loses half a million listeners but Nick Grimshaw holds audience|last=Plunkett|first=John|work=The Guardian|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=22 February 2013 | location=London[/tpl]

6 Music attracted criticism for changing daytime schedules during late 2007 and early 2008.[tpl]cite news|author=John Plunkett |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/feb/18/bbc.radio?gusrc=rss&feed=media |title=Lesley Douglas defends 6Music changes |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 15 February 2008|accessdate=23 May 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100629035348/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/feb/18/bbc.radio?gusrc=rss&feed=media| archivedate= 29 June 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Ro Cemm |url=http://thelineofbestfit.com/2008/02/29/6music-leading-the-fight-or-losing-its-way/ |title=6Music: Leading the fight or losing its way? |publisher=Thelineofbestfit.com |accessdate=23 May 2010[/tpl] In response, Lesley Douglas, Controller of BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music at the time, said that the changes were intended to attract more female listeners. She claimed that men listened to music in an intellectual way while women were more emotionally attached. This in turn brought on more criticism of perceived sexism on Douglas' part.[tpl]cite news| url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/02/women_men_music.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Women and men do not listen to music differently | first=Dave | last=Simpson | date=20 February 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl]

==Ratings and listenership==

In February 2010, 6 Music was reported as showing growth in its audience, winning an audience of 695,000 listeners, up 12.3% year-on-year."Jazz FM, 6Music and Radio 7 are bright spots amid digital radio's gloom" Retrieved on 22 February 2010 However, in the quarter to December 2009, its 'reach' (proportion of the adult population who listen for at least 5 minutes in the course of an average week) was 1%, and Total Survey Area share (of total listening time) was 0.4%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rajar.co.uk/listening/quarterly_listening.php|title=Quarterly Listening, All Individuals 15+ for period ending December 2009|publisher=Rajar[/tpl]
According to the BBC's service review of Radio 2 and 6 Music, published in February 2010, the average age of 6 Music listeners is 36, which it considers too low. The review implied that the deficiency in appeal to female listeners apparent in 2007 was still in existence, and that there should be changes to attract more listeners from ethnic minorities and lower income groups.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/r2_6music/r2_6music.pdf|title=Service review of Radio 2 and 6 Music|publisher=BBC[/tpl] However, the review did not give details of the scale of these issues.
Following the proposal to close the station, online listening figures rose significantly. The number of unique online listeners rose to an average of 133,653 in March 2010, up 50 per cent on the previous March.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/apr/30/bbc-6-music-audience-rise|title=BBC 6 Music's online audience soars|last=Plunkett|first=John|author2=agencies|date=30 April 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 May 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100503214309/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/apr/30/bbc-6-music-audience-rise| archivedate= 3 May 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] When the RAJAR listening figures were released in May 2010, it was revealed that 6 Music had an average of 1.02 million listeners in the first three months of the year, compared to 695,000 the previous year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/may/13/bbc-6-music-chris-evans-rajars|title=BBC 6 Music's audience rises 50%|last=Plunkett|first=John|work=The Guardian|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=13 May 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100516182439/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/may/13/bbc-6-music-chris-evans-rajars| archivedate= 16 May 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
