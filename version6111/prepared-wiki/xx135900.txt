===Origins===

The town started as a water stop for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad in 1883.  Ore was found in the nearby hills, leading to a boom.  From 1906 to 1940 it was the southern railhead for the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad, operated by the Pacific Coast Borax Company and bringing borax and other mining products from Death Valley and Beatty, Nevada to long distance Santa Fe Railway lines.

===Route 66===

By the 1940s, local mining and railway activity had ceased and the town survived supplying the needs of travellers on the National Old Trails Road, renamed to become the legendary Route 66 in California. Ludlow providing a Motor Court with bungalow cabins, the streamline moderne Ludlow Cafe, a gasoline-service garage, and shade.  They operated through the late 1960s. After Interstate 40 was built bypassing town there was little business and most residents departed, leaving ruins of empty buildings and Tamarisk trees that still stand flanking the old highway.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.theroadwanderer.net/RT66ludlow.htm | title = Ludlow Area & Mojave Desert | work = Shadows of Old Route 66 | publisher = The Road Wanderer | accessdate = August 24, 2006 [/tpl] Tourists following and exploring historic Route 66 pass through the ghost town now.
