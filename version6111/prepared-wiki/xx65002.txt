The term anti-Americanism, or anti-American sentiment, refers to opposition or hostility to the policies, culture, society, economics, international, or superpower role of the United States. Common contemporary negative stereotypes of Americans include that Americans are: aggressive, arrogant, ignorant,  overweight, poorly dressed, materialistic, obsessed with making money, too moralistic, and generally obnoxious.William Russell Melton. The new American expat: thriving and surviving overseas in the post-9/11 world. Intercultural Press, 2005. p. XIX.
Political scientist Brendan O'Connor suggests that Anti-Americanism cannot be isolated as a consistent phenomenon and that the term originated as a rough composite of stereotypes, prejudices and criticisms towards Americans or the United States, evolving to more politically based criticism.  French scholar Marie-France Toinet says use of the term "is only fully justified if it implies systematic opposition – a sort of allergic reaction – to America as a whole".O'Connor, Brendan: "A Brief History of Anti-Americanism from Cultural Criticism to Terrorism", Australasian Journal of American Studies, July 2004, pp. 77–92
Discussions on anti-Americanism have in most cases lacked a precise definition of what the sentiment entails (other than a general disfavor), which has led to the term being used broadly and in an impressionistic manner, resulting in the inexact impressions of the many expressions described as anti-American.O'Connor, Brendan, p 89.

==Etymology==

In the online Oxford Dictionary the term "anti-American" is defined as "hostile to the interests of the United States".http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anti--American?q=anti-american
In the first edition of Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) the term "anti-American"  was defined as "opposed to America, or to the true interests or government of the United States; opposed to the revolution in America”.[tpl]cite web|url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&word=antiamerican&use1913=on&use1828=on |title=The ARTFL Project – Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913+1828) |publisher=Machaut.uchicago.edu |accessdate=11 May 2012[/tpl] In France the use of the noun form 'antiaméricanisme' has been catalogued from 1948,Le Petit Robert ISBN 2-85036-668-4 entering ordinary political language in the 1950s.Roger, Phillipe.

==Interpretations==

Interpretations of anti-Americanism have often been polarized.  Anti-Americanism has been described by Hungarian-born American sociologist Paul Hollander as "a relentless critical impulse toward American social, economic, and political institutions, traditions, and values”.Hollander, Paul The Politics of Envy, The New Criterion, November 2002. Retrieved 29 April 2007.Jay Nordlinger, Hollander’s Clear Eye, 22 July 2004, National Review Online.
German newspaper publisher and political scientist Josef Joffe suggests five classic aspects of the phenomenon: reducing Americans to stereotypes, believing the United States to have an irremediably evil nature, ascribing to the U.S. establishment a vast conspiratorial power aimed at utterly dominating the globe, holding the United States responsible for all the evils in the world, and seeking to limit the influence of the United States by destroying it or by cutting oneself and one's society off from its polluting products and practices.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060501fareviewessay85311a/walter-russell-mead/through-our-friends-eyes-defending-and-advising-the-hyperpower.html|title=Through Our Friends' Eyes – Defending and Advising the Hyperpower |accessdate=12 April 2008 |last=Mead |first=Walter Russell  |date=May–June 2006 |publisher=Foreign Affairs[/tpl] Review of Josef Joffe's Überpower: The Imperial Temptation of America. Other advocates of the significance of the term argue that anti-Americanism represents a coherent and dangerous ideological current, comparable to anti-Semitism. Anti-Americanism has also been described as an attempt to frame the consequences of U.S. policy choices as evidence of a specifically American moral failure, as opposed to what may be unavoidable failures of a complicated foreign policy that comes with superpower status.Kagan, Robert. Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order (2003)
Its status as an "-ism" is a greatly contended aspect, however. Brendon O'Connor notes that studies of the topic have been "patchy and impressionistic," and often one-sided attacks on anti-Americanism as an irrational position. American academic Noam Chomsky, a prolific critic of U.S. policy, asserts that the use of the term within the U.S. has parallels with methods employed by totalitarian states or military dictatorships; he compares the term to "anti-Sovietism", a label used by the Kremlin to suppress dissident or critical thought, for instance.Interviewing Chomsky Preparatory to Porto: Alegre ZmagazineChomsky on Religion (Interview), YouTube.
 "The concept "anti-American" is an interesting one. The counterpart is used only in totalitarian states or military dictatorships... Thus, in the old Soviet Union, dissidents were condemned as "anti-Soviet”. That's a natural usage among people with deeply rooted totalitarian instincts, which identify state policy with the society, the people, the culture. In contrast, people with even the slightest concept of democracy treat such notions with ridicule and contempt.
Some have attempted to recognize both positions. French academic Pierre Guerlain has argued that the term represents two very different tendencies: "One systematic or essentialist, which is a form of prejudice targeting all Americans. The other refers to the way criticisms of the United States are labeled "anti-American" by supporters of U.S. policies in an ideological bid to discredit their opponents”.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ejas.revues.org/document1523.html |title=Pierre Guerlain, A Tale of Two Anti-Americanisms (European Journal of American Studies 2007) |publisher=Ejas.revues.org |accessdate=11 May 2012[/tpl] Guerlain argues that these two "ideal types" of anti-Americanism can sometimes merge, thus making discussion of the phenomenon particularly difficult. Other scholars have suggested that a plural of anti-Americanisms, specific to country and time period, more accurately describe the phenomenon than any broad generalization.Katzenstein, Peter and Robert Keohane. "Conclusion: Anti-Americanisms and the Polyvalence of America", in Anti-Americanisms in World Politics, Katzenstein and Keohane, eds., Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2006 (forthcoming). The widely used "anti-American sentiment", meanwhile, less explicitly implies an ideology or belief system.
Globally, increases in perceived anti-American attitudes appear to correlate with particular policies or actions,Rodman, Peter W. The world’s resentment, The National Interest, Washington D.C., vol. 601, Summer 2001 such as the Vietnam and Iraq[ref]Documenting the Phenomenon of Anti-Americanism
By Nicole Speulda, The Princeton Project on National Security, Princeton University, 2005[/ref] wars. For this reason, critics sometimes argue the label is a propaganda term that is used to dismiss any censure of the United States as irrational.O'Connor, Brendan, op. cit., p 78: "... Cold War (1945–1989) ... In this period the false and disingenuous labeling of objections to American policies as ‘anti-Americanism’ became more prominent.

==18th and 19th centuries==

===Degeneracy thesis===

In the mid- to late-eighteenth century, a theory emerged among some European intellectuals that the New World landmasses were inherently inferior to Europe. The so-called "degeneracy thesis" held that climatic extremes, humidity and other atmospheric conditions in America physically weakened both men and animals.[tpl]cite book |first=Barry |last=Rubin |authorlink=Barry Rubin |author2=Rubin, Judith Colp |title=Hating America: A History |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-530649-X[/tpl][tpl]rp|3–19[/tpl] American author James W. Ceaser and French author Philippe Roger have interpreted this theory as "a kind of prehistory of anti-Americanism”.Ceaser, James W.

The theory originated with Comte de Buffon, a leading French naturalist, in his Histoire Naturelle (1766). The French writer Voltaire joined Buffon and others in making the argument.  Dutchman Cornelius de Pauw, court philosopher to Frederick II of Prussia became its leading proponent. While Buffon focused on the American biological environment, de Pauw attacked people native to the continent. James Ceaser has noted that the denouncement of America as inferior to Europe was in part motivated by the German government's fear of mass emigration; de Pauw called on to convince the Germans that the new world was inferior. De Pauw is also known to have influenced the philosopher Immanuel Kant in a similar direction.Brendan O'Connor, Anti-Americanism – Historical Perspectives, p.8 Brendan O'Connor, Anti-Americanism – Historical Perspectives, p.8
De Pauw said that the New World was unfit for human habitation because it was, "so ill-favored by nature that all it contains is either degenerate or monstrous”.  He asserted that, "the earth, full of putrefacation, was flooded with lizards, snakes, serpents, reptiles and insects”. Taking a long-term perspective he announced that he was, "certain that the conquest of the New World...has been the greatest of all misfortunes befall mankind”.C. Vann Woodward, The Old World's New World (1991) p 6
The theory made it easy to argue  that the natural environment of the United States would prevent it from ever producing true culture. Echoing de Pauw, the French Encyclopedist Abbé Raynal wrote in 1770, "America has not yet produced a good poet, an able mathematician, one man of genius in a single art or a single science”.[tpl]cite book|author=James W. Ceaser|title=Reconstructing America: The Symbol of America in Modern Thought|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=t5kvAruS5H0C&pg=PA26|year=1997|publisher=Yale U.P.|page=26. Note: Ceaser writes in his endnote to this sentence (p. 254), that "...in later editions of his work, Raynal exempted North America, but not South America, from this criticism".[/tpl] The theory was debated and rejected by early American thinkers such as Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson; Jefferson, in his Notes on the State of Virginia (1781), provided a detailed rebuttal of de Buffon from a scientific point of view. Hamilton also vigorously rebuked the idea in Federalist No. 11 (1787).
One critic[tpl]who|date=April 2013[/tpl], citing Raynal's ideas, suggests that it was specifically extended to the English colonies that would become the United States.[tpl]cite journal | last =Danzer | first =Gerald A. |date=February 1974 | title =Has the Discovery of America Been Useful or Hurtful to Mankind?

Roger suggests that the idea of degeneracy posited a symbolic, as well as a scientific America, that would evolve beyond the original thesis. He argues that Buffon's ideas formed the root of a "stratification of negative discourses" that has recurred throughout the two countries' relationship (and has been matched by persistent anti-Gallic sentiment in the United States).

===Culture===

According to Brendan O'Connor, some Europeans criticized Americans for lacking "taste, grace and civility" and having a brazen and arrogant character. British author Frances Trollope observed in her 1832 book Domestic Manners of the Americans that the greatest difference between England and the United States was "want of refinement”., explaining that "that polish which removes the coarser and rougher parts of our nature is unknown and undreamed of" in America.[ref]Reprinted in 2004 as

London, Collins: 239 English writer Captain Marryat's critical account in his Diary in America, with Remarks on Its Institutions (1839) also proved controversial, especially in Detroit where an effigy of the author, along with his books, was committed to the flames. Other writers critical of American culture and manners included the bishop Talleyrand in France and Charles Dickens in England. Dickens' novel Martin Chuzzlewit (1844) is a ferocious satire on American life.[tpl]rp|42[/tpl]
Simon Schama says: "By the end of the nineteenth century, the stereotype of the ugly American – voracious, preachy, mercenary, and bombastically chauvinist – was firmly in place in Europe”.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/03/10/030310fa_fact|title=The Unloved American |accessdate=23 May 2008 |work=The New Yorker |date=10 March 2003|first=Simon|last=Schama | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080619033559/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/03/10/030310fa_fact| archivedate= 19 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] O'Connor suggests that such prejudices were rooted in an idealised image of European refinement and that the notion of high European culture pitted against American vulgarity has not disappeared.

===Politics and ideology===

The young United States also faced criticism on political and ideological grounds. Ceaser argues that the Romantic strain of European thought and literature, hostile to the Enlightenment view of reason and obsessed with history and national character, disdained the rationalistic American project. The German poet Nikolaus Lenau commented: "With the expression Bodenlosigkeit (absence of ground), I think I am able to indicate the general character of all American institutions; what we call Fatherland is here only a property insurance scheme”. Ceaser argues in his essay that such comments often repurposed the language of degeneracy, and the prejudice came to focus solely on the United States and not Canada and Mexico. Lenau had emigrated to the United States in 1833 and found that the country did not live up to his ideals, leading him to return to Germany the following year. His experiences in the USA were the subject of a novel entitled Tired of America (Der Amerika-Müde) (1855) by fellow German Ferdinand Kürnberger.The Reader's Encyclopedia (1974) edited by William Rose Bennet: 556
The nature of American democracy was also questioned. The sentiment was that the country lacked "a monarch, aristocracy, strong traditions, official religion, or rigid class system," according to Rubin, and its democracy was attacked by some Europeans in the early nineteenth century as degraded, a travesty, and a failure. The French Revolution, which was loathed by many European conservatives, also implicated the United States and the idea of creating a constitution on abstract and universal principles. That the country was intended to be a bastion of liberty was also seen as fraudulent given that it had been established with slavery. "How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?" asked Samuel Johnson in 1775.[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EFDA113EF937A35755C0A9609C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 |title= Give Us Liberty|accessdate=26 May 2008 |last=Staples |first=Brent |date=4 June 2006 |work=New York Times[/tpl] He famously stated that, "I am willing to love all mankind, except an American”.

==20th century==

===Intellectuals===

Sigmund Freud was vehemently anti-American. Historian Peter Gay says that in "slashing away at Americans wholesale; quite indiscriminately, with imaginative ferocity, Freud was ventilating some inner need”.  Gay suggests that Freud's anti-Americanism was not really about United States at all.[tpl]cite book|author=C. Vann Woodward|title=The Old World's New World|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gW64cHXNrRsC&pg=PA33|year=1992|page=33[/tpl]
Numerous authors went on the attack.  French writer Louis-Ferdinand Celine denounced the United States. German poet Rainer Marie Rilke wrote, "I no longer love Paris, partly because it is disfiguring and Americanizing itself”.[tpl]cite book|author=C. Vann Woodward|title=The Old World's New World|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gW64cHXNrRsC&pg=PA33|year=1992|page=34[/tpl]

===Communist critiques===

Until its demise in 1991, the Soviet Union and other Communist nations emphasized capitalism as the great enemy of Communism, and identified the U.S. as the leader of the capitalist nations. They sponsored anti-Americanism of all kinds among followers and fellow travellers. Berman notes that in the mid-19th century, "Marx himself largely admired the dynamism of American capitalism and democracy and did not participate in the anti-Americanism  that came to be the hallmark of Communist ideology in the twentieth century”.[tpl]cite book|author=Russell A. Berman|title=Anti-Americanism in Europe: A Cultural Problem|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8687I9FjRm8C&pg=PT58|year=2004|publisher=Hoover Press|page=58[/tpl] O'Connor argues that, "communism represented the starkest version of anti-Americanism  – a coherent worldview that challenged the free market, private property, limited government, and individualism”.[tpl]cite book|author=Brendan O'Conner|title=The Rise of Anti-Americanism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=au8edbGaTGQC&pg=PA183|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|page=183[/tpl]
Communist authors in the west, such as Bertolt Brecht and Jean-Paul Sartre went on the attack and reached a large audience on the far left. In his Anti-Americanism (2003), French writer Jean François Revel argues that anti-Americanism emerges primarily from anti-capitalism, and this critique also comes from non-Communist, totalitarian regimes.
The East German regime imposed an official ideology that was reflected in all its media and all the schools.  Anyone who indicated the least deviation invited a visit from the Stasi (secret police).  The official line followed Lenin's theory of imperialism as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and in Dimitrov's theory of fascism as the dictatorship of the most reactionary elements of financial capitalism.  The official party line stated that the United States had caused the breakup of the coalition against Hitler. It was now the bulwark of reaction worldwide, with a heavy reliance on warmongering for the benefit of the "terrorist international of murderers on Wall Street”.Rainer Schnoor, "The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR," in  Detlef Junker, et al. eds. The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945-1968: A Handbook, Vol. 2: 1968-1990  (2004)  pp 618-626, quotation on page 619.   East Germans were told they had a heroic role to play as a front-line against the evil Americans.  However Schnoor argues that few East Germans believed it.  They had seen enough of the Russians since 1945—a half-million Soviet troops were still stationed in East Germany as late as 1989.  Furthermore they were exposed to information from relatives in the West, as well as the American Radio Free Europe broadcasts, and West German media.  The official Communist media ridiculed the modernism and cosmopolitanism of American culture, and denigrated the features of the American way of life, especially jazz music and rock 'n roll.  The East German regime relied heavily on its tight control of youth organizations to rally them, with scant success, against American popular culture.  The older generations were more concerned with the poor quality of food, housing, and clothing, which stood in dramatic contrast to the prosperity of West Germany.  Professionals in East Germany were watched for any sign of deviation from the party line; their privileges were at risk.  The solution was to either comply or flee to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the crackdown and the Berlin wall of 1961.Schnoor, "The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR," 2:618-26

===Fascist critiques===

Drawing on the ideas of Arthur de Gobineau (1816–1882), European fascists decried the supposed degenerating effect of immigration on the racial mix of the American population. The Nazi philosopher Alfred Rosenberg argued that race mixture in the United States made it inferior to countries like Germany, which had a supposedly pure-bred racial stock.[tpl]rp|91–2[/tpl]
Anti-Semitism was another factor in these critiques. The belief that America was ruled by a Jewish conspiracy was common in countries ruled by fascists before and during World War II.[tpl]rp|91–7[/tpl] The Jews, the assumed puppet masters behind American plans for world domination, were also seen as using jazz in a crafty plan to eliminate racial distinctions.[tpl]rp|91–7[/tpl] However, despite this belief, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini did not count America as a credible adversary of the Third Reich because of its incoherent racial mix; they saw Americans as a "mongrel race", "half-Judaised" and "half-Negrified".[tpl]rp|94–7[/tpl]
In an address to the Reichstag on 11 December 1941, Hitler declared war on the United States and lambasted U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt:

====The "Liberators" poster====

The "Liberators" poster distributed by Nazis in 1944 to a Dutch audience displays multiple elements of anti-American attitudes used by the Nazis. Note that the title-"Liberator"-was a common Allied justification for attacking Germany. It also stands for the B-24 American bomber and the poster shows liberation equals destruction of Europe's cities. The artist was Harald Damsleth, a Norwegian who worked for the SS in occupied Norway.

==21st century==

===9/11===

In a book called The Rise of Anti-Americanism, published in 2006, Brendon O'Connor and Martin Griffiths said that the September 11, 2001 attacks were "quintessential anti-American acts, which satisfy all of the competing definitions of Anti-Americanism”.[tpl]Harvnb|O'Connor|Griffiths|2006|p=21[/tpl] They ask, "If 9/11 can be construed as the exemplar of anti-Americanism at work, does it make much sense to imply that all anti-Americans are complicit with terrorism?"[tpl]Harvnb|O'Connor|Griffiths|2006|p=3[/tpl] Leaders in most Middle Eastern countries, including Afghanistan, condemned the attacks. Saddam Hussein’s Iraq was a notable exception, with an immediate official statement that "the American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity”.[tpl]cite news|title=Attacks draw mixed response in Mideast|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/09/12/mideast.reaction/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=12 September 2001|accessdate=30 March 2007[/tpl]
 

 

==Contemporary regional attitudes==

 
 
A poll conducted [tpl]as of|2010|alt=in 2010[/tpl] by the BBC World Service found positive views in most countries about the influence of the U.S. for the first time since tracking began in 2005. 19 countries rated U.S. influence positively, while six leaned negative and two were divided. 46 per cent of the 27 countries polled viewed US influence positively and 34 per cent viewed it negatively.

===Middle East, South Asia and North Africa===

After World War I, admiration was expressed for American President Woodrow Wilson's promulgation of democracy, freedom and self-determination in the Fourteen Points and, during World War II, the high ideals of the Atlantic Charter received favorable notice.Tamim Ansary (2009) Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes: 333 According to Tamim Ansary, in Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes (2009) early views of America in the Middle East and the Muslim World were mostly positive.
Like elsewhere in the world, spikes in anti-Americanism in the region correlate with the adoption or reiteration of certain policies by the US government, in special its support for Israel in the occupation of Palestine and the Iraq War.[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2007/03/14/americas-image-in-the-world-findings-from-the-pew-global-attitudes-project/|title=America's Image in the World: Findings from the Pew Global Attitudes Project|date=March 14, 2007|accessdate=July 16, 2013|publisher=Pew Research[/tpl] In regards to 9/11, a Gallup poll noted, for example, that while most (93%) Muslims polled opposed the attack, 7% of them (called 'radicals' in the survey) supported it, citing in their favor, not religious view points, but disgust at US policies.[tpl]cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iZlsZRgzHmgwj6sKpA7PR5F5Ecsw|title=Major survey challenges Western perceptions of Islam|date=Feb 26, 2008|accessdate=Jul 16, 2013|publisher=Agence Free Presse[/tpl] In effect, when targeting US or other Western assets in the region, radical armed groups in the Middle East, Al Qaeda included, have made reference to US policies and alleged crimes against humanity to justify their attacks. To explain the Khobar Towers bombing, for example, Bin Laden named US support for Israel in instances of attacks against Muslims, such as the Sabra and Shatila massacre and the Qana massacre, as the reasons behind his group's attacks.The Structures of Love: Art and Politics Beyond the Transference
US-sponsored sanctions on Iraq, which exacted a large toll in the Arab country's civilian population, were also named by Al Qaeda as a justification to kill Americans.http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm
Though right-wing scholars (e.g. Paul Hollander) have given prominence to the role that religiosity, culture and backwardness play in inflaming anti-Americanism in the region, the poll noted that radicalism among Arabs or Muslims isn't correlated with poverty, backwardness or religiosity. Radicals were in fact shown to be better educated and wealthier than 'moderates'.
There is also, however, a cultural dimension to anti-Americanism among religious and conservative groups in the Middle East. It may have its origins with Sayyid Qutb. Qutb, an Egyptian who was the leading intellectual of the Muslim Brotherhood, studied in Greeley, Colorado from 1948 to 1950, and wrote a book, The America I Have Seen (1951) based on his impressions. In it he decried everything in America from individual freedom and taste in music to Church socials and haircuts.David Von Drehle, A Lesson In Hate Smithsonian Magazine Wrote Qutb, "They danced to the tunes of the gramophone, and the dance floor was replete with tapping feet, enticing legs, arms wrapped around waists, lips pressed to lips, and chests pressed to chests. The atmosphere was full of desire...”Siegel, Robert Sayyid Qutb's America, NPR, All Things Considered, 6 May 2003. Retrieved 29 April 2007. He offered a distorted chronology of American history and was disturbed by its sexually liberated women: "The American girl is well acquainted with her body's seductive capacity. She knows it lies in the face, and in expressive eyes, and thirsty lips. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs – and she shows all this and does not hide it”. He was particularly disturbed by jazz, which he called the American's preferred music, and which "was created by Negroes to satisfy their love of noise and to whet their sexual desires ...”Amrika allati Ra'aytu (The America that I Have Seen) quoted on Calvert (2000) Qutb's writings influenced generations of militants and radicals in the Middle East who viewed America as a cultural temptress bent on overturning traditional customs and morals, especially with respect to the relations between the sexes.

London: Abacus: 34-5, 65–7 In conjunction with several other Islamic militant leaders, bin Laden issued two fatawa – in 1996 and then again in 1998 – that Muslims should kill military personnel from the United States until they withdraw military forces from Islamic countries and withdraw support for Israel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |title=Bin Laden'S Fatwa |publisher=Pbs.org |date=20 August 1998 |accessdate=11 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1998.html|title=Online NewsHour: Al Qaeda's 1998 Fatwa|publisher=PBS|accessdate=21 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060901093550/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1998.html| archivedate= 1 September 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
After the 1996 fatwa, entitled "Declaration of War against the  Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places", bin Laden was put on a criminal file by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) under an American Civil War statute which forbids instigating violence and attempting to overthrow the U.S. government.Lawrence Wright (2007) The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda's Road to 9/11.

In 2002 and in mid-2004 Zogby International polled the favorable/unfavorable ratings of the U.S. in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In Zogby's 2002 survey, 76% of Egyptians had a negative attitude toward the United States, compared with 98% in 2004. In Morocco, 61% viewed the country unfavorably in 2002, but in two years, that number had jumped to 88 percent. In Saudi Arabia, such responses rose from 87% in 2002 to 94% in 2004. Attitudes were virtually unchanged in Lebanon but improved slightly in the UAE, from 87% who said in 2002 that they disliked the United States to 73% in 2004.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7080-2004Jul22.html|title=Poll Shows Growing Arab Rancor at U.S|first=Dafna|last=Linzer| date=23 July 2004 |work=The Washington Post|page=A26|ref=harv[/tpl]  However, most of these countries mainly objected to foreign policies that they considered unfair.

====Palestinians====

In July 2013, Palestinian Cleric Ismat Al-Hammouri, a leader of the Jerusalem-based Hizb ut-Tahrir, called for the destruction of America, France and Britain and Rome to conquer and destroy the enemies of the "Nation of Islam”. He warned: "We warn you, oh America: Take your hands off the Muslims. You have wreaked havoc in Syria, and before that, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, and now in Egypt,” shouted the cleric to the enthusiastic replies of the crowd. “Who do you think we are, America? We are the nation of Islam — a giant and mighty nation, which extends from east to west. Soon, we will teach you a political and military lesson, Allah willing. Allah Akbar.

===Europe===

In a 2003 article, historian David Ellwood identified what he called three great roots of anti-Americanism:
He went on to say that expressions of the phenomenon in the last 60 years have contained ever-changing combinations of these elements, the configurations depending on internal crises within the groups or societies articulating them as much as anything done by American society in all its forms.[tpl]cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/1426.html |title=Anti-Americanism: Why Do Europeans Resent Us? |author=David Ellwood  |publisher=George Mason university : History News Network |date=5 May 2003[/tpl]
In 2004, Sergio Fabbrini wrote that the perceived post-9/11 unilateralism of the 2003 invasion of Iraq fed deep rooted anti-American feeling in Europe, bringing it to the surface. In his article, he highlighted European fears surrounding the Americanization of the economy, culture and political process of Europe.[tpl]cite journal |last=Fabbrini |first=Sergio |title=Layers of Anti-Americanism: Americanization, American Unilateralism and Anti-Americanism in a European Perspective |journal=European Journal of American Culture |date=September 2004 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=79–94 |doi=10.1386/ejac.23.2.79/0 |ref=harv[/tpl]  Fabbrini in 2011 identified a cycle in anti-Americanism: modest in the 1990s, it grew explosively between 2003 and 2008, then declined after 2008. He sees the current version as related to images of American foreign policy-making as unrestrained by international institutions or world opinion. Thus it is the unilateral policy process and the arrogance of policy makers, not the specific policy decisions, that are decisive.Sergio Fabbrini, "Anti-Americanism and US foreign policy: Which correlation?," International Politics (Nov 2010) 47#6 pp. 557–573.
During the George W. Bush administration, public opinion of America declined in most European countries. A Pew Global Attitudes Project poll showed "favourable opinions" of America between 2000 and 2006 dropping from 83% to 56% in the United Kingdom, from 62% to 39% in France, from 78% to 37% in Germany and from 50% to 23% in Spain.
In Europe in 2002, vandalism of American companies was reported in Athens, Zürich, Tbilisi, Moscow and elsewhere. In Venice, 8 to 10 masked individuals claiming to be anti-globalists attacked a McDonald's restaurant.
In Athens, at the demonstrations commemorating the 17 November Uprising there is a march towards the US embassy to emphasize the US backing of the Greek military junta of 1967–1974 attended by many people each year.
Hatlapa and Markovits portray President Obama as an angel – or more exactly, like a rock star – in contrast to the devilish image of Bush. Hence his early Nobel Peace Prize. But they argue that "Obamamania" masks a deep-seated distrust and disdain of America.Ruth Hatlapa and Andrei Markovits, "Obamamania and Anti-Americanism as Complementary Concepts in Contemporary German Discourse," German Politics and Society (2010) 28#1 pp. 69–94

====France====

In France, the term "Anglo-Saxon" often is used in expressions of anti-Americanism or Anglophobia. It also has had more nuanced uses in discussions by French writers on French decline, especially as an alternative model to which France should aspire, how France should adjust to its two most prominent global competitors, and how it should deal with social and economic modernization.Emile Chabal, "The Rise of the Anglo-Saxon: French Perceptions of the Anglo-American World in the Long Twentieth Century," French Politics, Culture & Society (Spring 2013) 31#1 pp. 24-46.
In the 1950s the Suez Crisis of 1956 caused dismay among the French right, which already was angry at the lack of American support during Dien Bien Phu in 1954. For the Socialists and Communists of the French left, it was the Vietnam War and U.S. imperialism that were the sources of resentment.[tpl]cite book|author=Brendon O'Connor|title=Anti-Americanism: In the 21st century|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YJkMN0hjOw8C|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84645-027-3|page=53[/tpl] Much later, the alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq affair certainly dirtied the previously favourable image.

In her contribution to the seminal book Anti-Americanisms in World Politics edited by Peter Katzenstein and Robert Keohane in 2006, Sophie Meunier writes about French anti-Americanism. She contends that although it has a long history (older than the U.S. itself) and is the most easily recognizable anti-Americanism in Europe, it may not have had real policy consequences on the United States and thus may have been less damaging than more pernicious and invisible anti-Americanism in other countries.Book Review: Anti-Americanisms in world politics, Cornell University Press.

====Netherlands====

Although the Dutch have generally held a favorable attitude toward America, there were negative currents in the aftermath of World War II as the Dutch blamed American policy for the loss of their Asian Empire to Indonesia.  They credited their rescue from the Nazis in 1944-45 to the Canadian Army.G. Teitler, "Sea Power on the Decline: Anti-Americanism and the Royal Netherlands Navy, 1942-1952," European Contributions to American Studies (1987) vol 11 pp 72-84  Postwar attitudes continued the perennial ambiguity of anti-Americanism: the love-hate relationship, or willingness to adopt American cultural patterns while at the same time voicing criticism of them.Rob Kroes, "The Great Satan Versus the Evil Empire: Anti-Americanism in the Netherlands," European Contributions to American Studies (1987) Vol. 11, pp 37-50.  In the 1960s, anti-Americanism revived largely in reaction against the Vietnam War. Its major early advocates were non-party-affiliated, left-wing students, journalists, and intellectuals. Dutch public opinion polls (1975–83) indicate a stable attitude toward the United States; only 10% of the people were unswervingly anti-American.Koen Koch, "Anti-Americanism and the Dutch Peace Movement," European Contributions to American Studies (1987), Vol. 11, pp 97-111 The most strident rhetoric came from the left wing of Dutch politics and can largely be attributed to the consequences of Dutch participation in NATO.Bob DeGraaf, "Bogey or Saviour? The Image of the United States in the Netherlands during the Interwar Period," European Contributions to American Studies (1987), Vol. 11, pp 51-71.

====Russia====

Russia has long history of Anti-Americanism, dating back to early days of Cold War. In some of the latest Russian population polls, United States and its allies, constantly top the list of "greatest threats".ФОМ: Старый враг лучше новых двух, FOM: An old enemy is better than two newЛевада-центр: Друзья и враги России, Levada-center: Friends and Foes of Russia In 2013, 30% of Russians had a "very unfavorable" or "somewhat unfavorable" view of Americans and 40% viewed the U.S. in a "very unfavorable" or "somewhat unfavorable" light.

====China====

In China, there has been a history of anti-Americanism, beginning with the general disdain for foreigners in the early 19th century that culminated in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900.
When Mao Zedong and the Communists came to power in 1948, he launched an anti-American campaign that intensified as China and the U.S. fought a major undeclared war in Korea, 1950–53. One of Mao's goals was to identify and destroy factions inside China that might be favorable to capitalism.Guang Qiu Xu, "U.S. Air Aid and the CCP's Anti-American Campaign, 1945–1949," Air Power History (2000) 47#1 pp. 24–39Michael M.

Mao never intended on friendly relations with the U.S., Sheng argues.Michael M. Sheng, Battling Western Imperialism: Mao, Stalin, and the United States (Princeton University Press, 1997) ch 1 Mao ridiculed the U.S. as a "paper tiger," occupiers of Taiwan, "the enemy of the people of the world and has increasingly isolated itself" and "monopoly capitalist groups”.[tpl]cite web|author=Mao Tse Tung |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch06.htm |title=Quotations from Mao Tse Tung – Chapter 6 |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=11 May 2012[/tpl]
After Mao's death and the Chinese economic reforms of the 1980s hostility diminished sharply, and large-scale trade and investments, as well as cultural exchanges became major factors.

====Japan====

In Japan, objections to the behavior and presence of American military personnel are sometimes reported as anti-Americanism, such as the 1995 Okinawan rape incident.[tpl]cite news |url= http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9510/okinawa_protest/index.html|title=Thousands rally against U.S. bases in Okinawa|accessdate=11 April 2008 |publisher=CNN |date=21 October 1995 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.iht.com/articles/2002/08/01/kor_ed1_.php |title=Road deaths ignite Korean anti-Americanism|accessdate=11 April 2008 |work=International Herald Tribune |date=1 August 2002[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The ongoing U.S. military presence in Okinawa remains a contentious issue in Japan.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/27/rice/|title=Rice soothes Japan on rape case |accessdate=13 March 2008 |publisher=CNN |date=27 February 2008 [/tpl]
While protests have arisen because of specific incidents, they are often reflective of deeper historical resentments. Robert Hathaway, director of the Wilson Center's Asia program, suggests: "The growth of anti-American sentiment in both Japan and South Korea must be seen not simply as a response to American policies and actions, but as reflective of deeper domestic trends and developments within these Asian countries”. In Japan, a variety of threads have contributed to anti-Americanism in the post-war era, including pacifism on the left, nationalism on the right, and opportunistic worries over American influence in Japanese economic life.[tpl]cite book |title=Korean Attitudes Toward the United States: Changing Dynamics |chapter=Anti-Americanism in Japan |last=Glosserman |first=Bob |url=http://books.google.com/?id=EB4PbvOcbP8C&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=Japan+anti-Americanism |year=2005 |publisher=M.

====Korea====

Speaking to the Wilson Center, Katherine Moon notes that while the majority of South Koreans support the American alliance "anti-Americanism also represents the collective venting of accumulated grievances that in many instances have lain hidden for decades”. In the 1990s, scholars, policy makers, and the media noted that anti-Americanism was motivated by the rejection of authoritarianism and a resurgent nationalism, this nationalist Anti-Americanism continued into the 2000s fuelled by a number of incidents such as the ‘IMF’ crisis.Korea's democratisation, Ed Samuel S. Kim, Cambridge university press 2003, Page 135 and 136 During the early 1990s, Western princess, prostitutes for American soldiers became a symbol of Anti-American nationalism.[tpl]cite book |last= Cho  |first= Grace |title= Haunting the Korean Diaspora: Shame, Secrecy, and the Forgotten War |url=http://books.google.co.kr/books?id=VagzEDjnZpcC&pg=PA103&dq=yanggongju+caste&hl=en&sa=X&ei=U2llUdCaL4ftkgX0rYCABw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=yanggongju%20caste&f |publisher= University of Minnesota Press |year=2008 |ISBN= 0816652759  |page= 91[/tpl]

However, 74% of South Koreans have a favorable view of the U.S., making South Korea one of the world's most pro-American countries.

====Philippines====

The Anti-American sentiment in the Philippines has been rising since 2009 due to the controversial Visiting Forces Agreement, the historical Philippine–American War, and the 1898–1946 period of American rule.
Many loyalists of dictator Ferdinand Marcos have protested against the presence of American military forces in the Philippines. Their reason for supporting the anti-American sentiment is the role of the United States in framing up and overthrowing President Marcos in 1986.
In October 2012, American ships were found dumping toxic wastes into Subic Bay, spurring Anti-Americanism and setting the stage for multiple rallies.http://www.philstar.com/breaking-news/2012/11/14/866561/dumping-us-toxic-wastes-phl-triggers-anti-american-rhetoric

The 1855 American intervention in Nicaragua and the Spanish-American War of 1898, which turned Cuba into a virtual dependency of the United States, in the context of the Big Stick ideology espoused by Theodore Roosevelt's corollary to the Monroe Doctrine that led to numerous interventions in Central America and the Caribbean, also prompted hatred of the US in other regions of the Americas.Volker Skierka (2004) Fidel Castro A Biography. Cambridge: Polity Press: 4 A very influential formulation of Latin-American anti-Americanism, engendered by the 1898 war, was the Uruguayan journalist José Enrique Rodó's essay Ariel (1900) in which the spiritual values of the South American Ariel are contrasted to the brutish mass-culture of the American Caliban. This essay had enormous influence throughout Spanish America in the 1910s and 1920s, and prompted resistance to what was seen as American cultural imperialism.Edwin Williamson (1992) The Penguin History of Latin America: 305 Perceived racist attitudes of the white Anglo-Saxon Protestants of the North towards the populations of Latin America also caused resentment.Thomas Skidmore and Peter Smith (1997) Modern Latin America.

Vice-President Richard Nixon's tour of South America in 1958 prompted a spectacular eruption of anti-Americanism.

America's tightening of the economic embargo on Cuba in 1996 and 2004 also caused resentment among Latin American leaders and has prompted them to use the Rio Group and the Madrid-based Ibero-American Summits as meeting places rather than the American dominated OAS.Peter Winn (2006) Americas: The Changing Face of Latin America and the Caribbean. University of California Press: 645 This trend has been reinforced through the creation of a series of regional political bodies such as Unasur and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, and a strong opposition to the materialization of the Washington-sponsored Free Trade Area of the Americas at the 2005 4th Summit of the Americas.
Furthermore, the renewal of the concession for the U.S. military base in Manta, Ecuador was met by considerable criticism, derision, and even doubt by the supporters of such an expansion.Lawrence Reichard, US Military Base in Ecuador Shrouded in Corruption, PeaceWork magazine, Issue 391, December 2008 – January 2009.

=====Argentina=====

Relations have been tense since the 1940s, when the U.S. feared Argentina was too close to Nazi Germany. Polls compiled by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs showed in 2006 Argentine public opinion was quite negative regarding America's role in the world.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/apr07/CCGA+_ViewsUS_article.pdf|title = World Publics Reject US Role as the World Leader|work = The Chicago Council on Public Affairs|date = April 2007[/tpl] Argentine public opinion of the U.S. and U.S. policies improved during the Obama administration, and as of 2010 was divided about evenly (42% to 41%) between those who viewed these favorably or unfavorably. In 2007, 26% of Argentinos had a favourable view of the American people, with 57% having an unfavourable view, but this improved somewhat in 2013, with 38% having a favourable view and 40% having an unfavourable view.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/database/?indicator=1&country=11|title=Argentina: Opinion of the United States|work=Pew Research Center|year=2012[/tpl]http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/2/country/11/response/Unfavorable/

====Canada====

Anti-Americanism in Canada has unique historic roots.  When the Continental Congress was called in 1774, an invitation was sent to Quebec (then known as Canada) and Nova Scotia.  However Canadians expressed little interest in joining the Congress, and the following year the American army invaded Canada, but was defeated at the Battle of Quebec.  Although the American Articles of Confederation later pre-approved Canada as a U.S. state, public opinion had turned against them.  Soon 40,000 loyalist refugees arrived from the United States, including 2,000 Black Loyalists, many of whom had fought for the Crown against the American Revolution.  To them, the republic they left behind was violent and anarchic, ruled by money and mob rule.Nossal, Kim Richard, "Anti-Americanism in Canada", Anti-Americanism: comparative perspectives (2007), ed. Brendon O'Connor, pp. 62–66 Pro-British imperialists repeatedly warned against American-style republicanism and democracy as little more than mob rule.[tpl]cite book|author1=Sara Jeannette Duncan|author2=Misao Dean|title=The Imperialist|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=54osezQz_eQC&pg=PA19|year=2005|publisher=Broadview Press|page=19[/tpl] Anti-Americanism, as a political tactic, was sometimes used by the Conservatives to attack the supposed Liberal Party affinity for Americans, as in the 1911 elections.Richard Johnston and Michael B. Percy. "Reciprocity, Imperial Sentiment, and Party Politics in the 1911 Election," Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue canadienne de science politique (1980) 13#4 pp. 711–729 in JSTOR  Anti-Americanism thus remained a fixture in Canadian partisan politics, as employed by such leaders as prime minister John G. Diefenbaker in the 1950s.J.L. Granatstein. Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism'' (1997) pp. 121–45
Canadian intellectuals, who wrote about the U.S. in the first half of the 20th century, identified the United States as the world center of modernity, and deplored it. Imperialists (who admired the British Empire) explained that Canadians had narrowly escaped American conquest with its rejection of tradition, its worship of "progress" and technology, and its mass culture; they explained that Canada was much better because of its commitment to orderly government and societal harmony.  There were a few ardent defenders of the nation to the south, notably liberal and socialist intellectuals such as F. R. Scott and Jean-Charles Harvey (1891–1967).Damien-Claude Bélanger, Prejudice and Pride: Canadian Intellectuals Confront the United States, 1891–1945 (University of Toronto Press, 2011), pp. 16, 180
Brendon O'Connor & Martin Griffiths state in their book Anti-Americanism that they would at first glance think that Canadians seem as likely as others to embrace characteristics that are characterised as
anti-American. O'Conner and Griffiths include such actions as criticising Americans as a people, or the US as a country as being anti-American often demonising, denigrating and resorting to stereotypes. 
They have also written that the Anti-Americanism found in Canada had unique qualities: nowhere else has it been so entrenched for so long, nor so central to the political culture as in Canada.[tpl]cite book|author=Brendon O'Connor|title=Anti-Americanism: Comparative perspectives|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Jq4FMb47AnEC|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84645-026-6|page=71[/tpl] Canadian
historian Kim Richard Nossal thinks that a low level attenuated form of anti-Americanism permeates Canadian political culture, though "designed primarily as a means to differentiate Canadians from 
Americans”. Although Jack Granatstein has suggested that Anti-Americanism was dead in Canada, John Herd Thompson and Stephen J. Randall in their book Canada and the United States (2002) states 
that there is anecdotal evidence that it still flourishes, and that it continues to nourish the Canadian sense of identity.[tpl]cite book|author1=John Herd Thompson|author2=Stephen J.
