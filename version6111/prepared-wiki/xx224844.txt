The beach was roughly charted and named "Black Point" by Robert Fildes in 1820–22. As there was already a Black Point on Livingston Island, this name was rejected and a new one substituted by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1958. John Beach is named after the brig John (Captain John Walker) of London, which was sealing in the South Shetland Islands in 1820–21 and 1821–22.
