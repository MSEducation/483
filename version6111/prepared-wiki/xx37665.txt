Pope Pius VIII (20 November 1761 – 30 November 1830), born Francesco Saverio Castiglioni was Pope from 31 March 1829 to his death in 1830.

==Early life==

Francesco Saverio Castiglioni was born in Cingoli, Marche, the third of eight children of Count Ottavio Castiglioni and his wife Sanzia Ghislieri. His baptismal name was recorded as Francesco Saverio Maria Felice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1816.htm#Castiglioni|title=CASTIGLIONI, Francesco Saverio (1761-1830) |publisher=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church|date= |accessdate=11 February 2014[/tpl] He studied Canon law and, in 1800 became bishop of Montalto. After he refused to swear allegiance to Napoleon I of France (1804–14, 1815) he was taken to France, but following the defeat of France, he was, in 1816, made a Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Traspontina. He held various high offices thereafter, including that of Major Penitentiary. He soon became cardinal bishop of the suburbicarian see of Frascati.
"As a Cardinal, Castiglione had continued to live modestly, made no enemies, and although his own private life had always been irreproachable, he had shown no signs of censoriousness where others were concerned. He suffered from a very painful and distressing complaint, having perpetually suppurating sores on his neck and body, and as pope was far too ill and feeble to do more than sign the documents presented to him by Cardinal Giuseppe Albani, who ruled the Papal States as autocratically as though he had himself worn the triple crown."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pickle-publishing.com/papers/triple-crown-pius-viii.htm |title=Pope Pius VIII: Proceedings of the Conclave that led to his election |publisher=Pickle-publishing.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-23[/tpl]

==Papacy==

===Election===

After the death of Pope Leo XII in 1829, Castiglioni was considered to be a candidate though was questioned due to his frail health. Still, he had been a front runner in the previous conclave and Pope Leo XII had said that he was "some day to be Pius VIII". He was elected as pope in the papal conclave and given that both Leo XII and Pope Pius VII had referred to him as Pius VIII, it was only suitable that it was the pontifical name that he chose.

===Reforms===

As Pope Pius VIII, he initiated some reforms in the states of the Church. On 24 May 1829 he issued an encyclical, Traditi humilitati. Perhaps indicating that the current debate on religious pluralism was also occurring in his own time he condemned the "foul contrivance of the sophists of this age" that would place Catholicism on par with any other religion.

===Biblical translations===

Regarding Bible translations, he wrote in that encyclical:
On 25 March 1830, in the brief Litteris altero, he condemned the masonic secret societies and modernist biblical translations.

===Other activities===

His brief pontificate saw the Catholic Emancipation in the United Kingdom and the July Revolution in France (1830). Pius VIII recognised Louis Philippe (1830–48) as French king and even allowed him to use the French king's customary honorific "Roi Très Chretien" ("Most Christian King").
Pius VIII accepted the situation on mixed marriages between Protestants and Catholics in Germany, but he opposed changes in Ireland and Poland.

==Health, death and conspiracy theory==

Pius VIII was in very poor health from his election until his death one year after the conclave. He died on 30 November 1830 at the age of 69 in the Quirinal Palace, Rome. Prince Don Agostino Chigi, a contemporary of the late pope's and one of the papal nobility associated with the papal court, recorded in his diary (2 December 1830):
These few words have been interpreted by some partisans of a conspiracy theory as evidence that the late pontiff had indeed been poisoned. Cardinal Camillo di Pietro gave the funeral ovation for the late pope, before the cardinals entered the conclave to choose a successor. He was succeeded by Pope Gregory XVI.
