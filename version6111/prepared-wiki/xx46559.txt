Thomas C Van Flandern (June 26, 1940 – January 9, 2009) was an American astronomer and author specializing in celestial mechanics. Van Flandern had a career as a professional scientist, but was noted as an outspoken proponent of non-mainstream views related to astronomy, physics, and extra-terrestrial life. He also published the non-mainstream Meta Research Bulletin. He died of colon cancer in Seattle, Washington.[tpl]Cite web| url =http://www.sequimgazette.com/obituaries/article.exm/2009-01-21_obituaries |title = Obituary | publisher = Sequim Gazette | date = January 21, 2009 [/tpl]

He later said, "This forced me to the "fringes", areas of astronomy not accepted as credible by experts of the field".Gonzo Science, Jim Richardson, Alan Richardson, p. 62, 2004.
Following his separation from the USNO, Van Flandern started a business organizing eclipse viewing expeditions, and promoting his non-mainstream views in a newsletter and web site.  Shortly after his death in 2009, Van Flandern's friend and associate David Dunham proposed that asteroid 52266 be named in his honor.[tpl]Cite journal| url = http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=52266+Van+Flandern | title = Citation for 52266 | journal = Minor Planet Circulars | issue = 65123 [/tpl]

==Mainstream scientific work==

During the mid-1970s, Van Flandern believed that lunar observations gave evidence of variation in Newton's gravitational constant (G), consistent with a speculative idea that had been put forward by Paul Dirac. In 1974, his essay "A Determination of the Rate of Change of G" was awarded second place by the Gravity Research Foundation.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gravityresearchfoundation.org/winners_year.html#74 | title = Award winners | publisher = Gravity Research Foundation [/tpl][tpl]Cite web | url = http://www.gravityresearchfoundation.org/pdf/awarded/1974/vanflandern.pdf | title = A Determination of the Rate of Change of G | year = 1974 | author = Tom Van Flandern [/tpl]
However, in later years, with new data available, Van Flandern himself admitted his findings were flawed, and the conclusions were contradicted by more accurate findings based on radio measurements with the Viking landers.[tpl]Cite book| page = 175- | author = Clifford Will | authorlink = Clifford Martin Will | title = Was Einstein Right?: putting general relativity to the test | publisher = Basic Books | edition = 2 | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-465-09086-9[/tpl]Dark Matter, Missing Planets, New Comets, Van Flandern 1993.

David W. Dunham, The Minor Planet Bulletin, Volume 6, p.13–14 (December 1978) Van Flandern and others began to report similar observations.Van Flandern, T. C., Tedesco, E. F. & Binzel, R. P. in Asteroids (ed. Gehrels, T.) 443–465 (Univ. Ariz. Press, Tucson, 1979). However, the reported findings were subsequently called into question by high resolution imaging from the Hubble telescope, which failed to detect satellites for the specific asteroids examined by Dunham and Van Flandern.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1006/icar.1999.6047 |last=Storrs |first=Alex Weiss; Zellner; Burleson; Sichitiu; Wells; Kowal; Tholen |title=Imaging observations of asteroids with Hubble Space Telescope |journal=Icarus |volume=137 |issue=2 |pages=260–268 |year=1999 |url=http://scripts.mit.edu/~paleomag/articles/Storrs_1999_Icarus.pdf |bibcode=1999Icar..137..260S[/tpl]
Van Flandern and Henry Fliegel developed a compact algorithm to calculate a Julian date from a Gregorian date. They described this in a letter to the editor of a computing magazine in 1968.[tpl]cite web|last=Fliegel|first=Henry|title=Letters to the editor: a machine algorithm for processing calendar dates|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=364096.364097|publisher=ACM|accessdate=2013-06-28|coauthors=Thomas C. Van Flanderen|page=657|doi=10.1145/364096.364097|date=October 1968[/tpl]  This was available for use in business applications.
With Kenneth Pulkkinen, he published "Low precision formulae for planetary positions", in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement in 1979. According to Van Flandern's obituary, the paper set a record for the number of reprints requested from that journal.

==Non-mainstream science and beliefs==

Van Flandern described in his book"Dark Matter, Missing Planets, New Comets", Van Flandern (1993) how he had become increasingly dissatisfied with the mainstream view of science by the early 1980s.  He wrote
In his book, and also in his newsletter and web site, Van Flandern alleged that experimental evidence is incompatible with mainstream scientific theories, but that mainstream scientists refuse to acknowledge this to avoid jeopardizing their funding.  He espoused a set of principles for assessing ideas, and dubbed theories that he deemed compliant with these principles as "Deep Reality Physics."  He claimed that mainstream scientific theories, especially the prevailing theories regarding the big bang, solar system formation, relativity, and electrodynamics, are incompatible with his principles, and advocated his own replacement theories. Notably, he contended that some features on the surface of Mars were created artificially, likely by an extra-terrestrial civilization that had fled its original home planet which, Van Flandern believed, had been a moon of an exploded planet where the asteroid belt is now located. His views have not found acceptance within the mainstream scientific community.

===Exploding Planets===

In 1976, while Van Flandern was employed by the USNO, he had began to promote the belief (first suggested by Olbers in the 1800sSee the Wikipedia article on Phaeton (hypothetical planet).) that major planets sometimes explode.http://metaresearch.org/solar%20system/eph/eph2000.asp According to Van Flandern's article on the Exploded Planet Hypothesis "The third planetary explosion mechanism relies on one other hypothesis not yet widely accepted, but holds out the potential for an indefinitely large reservoir of energy for exploding even massive planets and stars. If gravitational fields are continually regenerated, as in LeSage particle models of gravity xvi, then all masses are continually absorbing energy from this universal flux." In his book Van Flandern described the negative reception of his ideas about exploding planets among mainstream scientists.  Van Flandern also speculated that the origin of the human species may well have been on the planet Mars, which he believed was once a moon of a now-exploded "Planet V".

===Le Sage's theory of gravitation and the speed of gravity===

Van Flandern supported Le Sage's discredited theory of gravitation, according to which gravity is the result of a flux of invisible "ultra-mundane corpuscles" impinging on all objects from all directions at superluminal speeds. He gave public lectures in which he claimed that these particles could be used as a limitless source of free energy, and to provide superluminal propulsion for spacecraft.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Jeffery D. Kooistra | title = Conference on Future Energy|journal = Infinite Energy Magazine | issue = 26 | date = July–August 1999[/tpl] An editor gave a summary of Van Flandern's talk at the Infinite Energy conference and wrote "Van Flandern gave a talk entitled 'On a Complete Theory of Gravity and Free Energy'. For the free energy enthusiast, the implications of gravity being particulate and perhaps blockable are obvious. Block or deflect the c-gravitons raining down from the sky and up you go into space. Turn off the blocking shield and recover the energy you've gained, for free, as you fall back to Earth."[tpl]Cite web| url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51aJobWkrig| title = Dr. Thomas Van Flandern – MUFON-LA (1 of 1) | publisher = youtube[/tpl]  He also speculated that the ultra-mundane flux caused the explosion of a major planet once located between Mars and Jupiter.
In 1998 Van Flandern wrote a paper[tpl]Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0375-9601(98)00650-1 | title = The speed of gravity ?

===Face on Mars===

Van Flandern was a prominent advocate of the belief that certain geological features seen on Mars, especially the "face at Cydonia", are not of natural origin, but were produced by intelligent extra-terrestrial life, probably the inhabitants of a major planet once located where the asteroid belt presently exists, and which Van Flandern believed had exploded 3.2 million years ago.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metaresearch.org/solar%20system/cydonia/proof_files/proof.asp | title = Proof that the Cydonia Face on Mars is Artificial | publisher = Metaresearch.org[/tpl] The claimed artificiality of the "face" was also the topic of a chapter of his 1993 book.[tpl]cite book|author=Tom Van Flandern|title=Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets: Paradoxes Resolved, Origins Illuminated|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fq8trtkOvMEC&pg=PA417|year=1993|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1-55643-268-2|location=chapter 24. New Evidence for Artificiality at Cydonia on Mars[/tpl] He also gave lectures on the subject,[tpl]Cite web| url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkXsQbaDg5g| title = Mysterious Mars | publisher = youtube[/tpl] and at the conclusion of the lectures he described his overall conception:[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
When it was first imaged, and into the 21st century, the "Face" is near universally accepted to be an optical illusion, an example of pareidolia, and theories that it was an artificial artifact were considered to be pseudo-science.[tpl]Cite web|last=Britt|first=R.R.|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/03/17/alien.debunk/index.html|title=Scientist attacks alien claims on Mars|publisher=CNN|date=March 18, 2004|accessdate=October 12, 2007[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| url = http://www.astrosociety.org/education/resources/pseudobib03.html| title = Astronomical Pseudo-Science: A Skeptic's Resource List | publisher = Astronomical Society of the Pacific[/tpl] After analysis of the higher resolution Mars Global Surveyor data NASA stated that "a detailed analysis of multiple images of this feature reveals a natural looking Martian hill whose illusory face-like appearance depends on the viewing angle and angle of illumination".[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_60.html|title=The Face on Mars, Viking Project|publisher=NASA website|accessdate=April 26, 2007[/tpl]

===Rejection of Big Bang Cosmology===

Van Flandern was a vocal opponent of the Big Bang model in cosmology, and espoused instead a Steady-State cosmology.  He compiled a list of what he regarded as problems for the Big Bang model.  It began as a list of "Top 10" problems, then expanded to the "Top 30", and ultimately by 2008 had reached the "Top 60".The Top 30 Problems With the Big Bang, Van Flandern's web article explaining his objections to big bang cosmology.  In 2008 he was an organizer of a conference of individuals who oppose the Big Bang cosmological models.http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20080911/NEWS/809110302  According to the report of one conference participant:
However, the consensus of the scientific community is that "The Big Bang is a well-tested scientific theory which is widely accepted within the scientific community because it is the most accurate and comprehensive explanation for the full range of phenomena astronomers observe. Since its conception, abundant evidence has arisen to further validate the model."Big Bang Wikipedia article on the Big Bang theory.
