[[Artificial respiration]]

CATEGORIES: First aid

Artificial respiration is the act of assisting or stimulating respiration, a metabolic process referring to the overall exchange of gases in the body by pulmonary ventilation, external respiration, and internal respiration.[tpl]cite book|last=Tortora|first=Gerard J|author2=Derrickson, Bryan|title=Principles of Anatomy and Physiology|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Inc.[/tpl]  Assistance takes many forms, but generally entails providing air for a person who is not breathing or is not making sufficient respiratory effort on his/her own[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9009713/artificial-respiration|title=Artificial Respiration|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=2007-06-15| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070614094502/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9009713/artificial-respiration| archivedate= 14 June 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] (although it must be used on a patient with a beating heart or as part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation to achieve the internal respiration).
Pulmonary anton ventilation (and hence external parts of respiration) is achieved through manual insufflation of the lungs either by the rescuer blowing into the patient's lungs, or by using a mechanical device to do so.  This method of insufflation has been proved more effective than methods which involve mechanical manipulation of the patient's chest or arms, such as the Silvester method.[tpl]cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562617/Artificial_Respiration.html|title=Artificial Respiration|publisher=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007|accessdate=2007-06-15|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwKiCVG5|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes[/tpl]   It is also known as Expired Air Resuscitation (EAR), Expired Air Ventilation (EAV), mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, rescue breathing or colloquially the kiss of life.
Artificial respiration is a part of most protocols for performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/cprleaflet|title=Decisions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation model information leafler|publisher=British Medical Association|date=July 2002|accessdate=2007-06-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-12|title=Overview of CPR|publisher=American Heart Association|year=2005|accessdate=2007-06-15| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070627015639/http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-12| archivedate= 27 June 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] making it an essential skill for first aid.   In some situations, artificial respiration is also performed separately, for instance in near-drowning and opiate overdoses.  The performance of artificial respiration in its own is now limited in most protocols to health professionals, whereas lay first aiders are advised to undertake full CPR in any case where the patient is not breathing sufficiently.
Mechanical ventilation involves the use of a mechanical ventilator to move air in and out of the lungs when an individual is unable to breathe on their own, for example during surgery with general anesthesia or when an individual is in a coma.

==History==

In 1773, physician William Hawes (1736–1808) began publicising the power of artificial respiration to resuscitate people who superficially appeared to have drowned. For a year he paid a reward out of his own pocket to any one bringing him a body rescued from the water within a reasonable time of immersion. Thomas Cogan, another English physician, who had become interested in the same subject during a stay at Amsterdam, where was instituted in 1767 a society for preservation of life from accidents in water, joined Hawes in his crusade. In the summer of 1774 Hawes and Cogan each brought fifteen friends to a meeting at the Chapter Coffee-house, St Paul's Churchyard, where they founded the Royal Humane Society as a campaigning group for first aid and resuscitation.
Gradually, branches of the Royal Humane Society were set up in other parts of the country, mainly in ports and coastal towns where the risk of drowning was high and by the end of the 19th century the society had upwards of 280 depots throughout the UK, supplied with life-saving apparatus. The earliest of these depots was the Receiving House in Hyde Park, on the north bank of the Serpentine, which was built in 1794 on a site granted by George III. Hyde Park was chosen because tens of thousands of people swam in the Serpentine in the summer and ice-skated in the winter. Boats and boatmen were kept to render aid to bathers, and in the winter ice-men were sent round to the different skating grounds in and around London. The society distributed money-rewards, medals, clasps and testimonials, to those who saved or attempted to save drowning people. It further recognized "all cases of exceptional bravery in rescuing or attempting to rescue persons from asphyxia in mines, wells, blasting furnaces, or in sewers where foul gas may endanger life."

==Insufflations==

Insufflation, also known as 'rescue breaths' or 'ventilations', is the act of mechanically forcing air into a patient's respiratory system.  This can be achieved via a number of methods, which will depend on the situation and equipment available.  All methods require good airway management to perform, which ensures that the method is effective. These methods include:

===Adjuncts to insufflation===

Most training organisations recommend that in any of the methods involving mouth to patient, that a protective barrier is used, to minimise the possibility of cross infection (in either direction).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/services/hss/resources/eccpr.doc|title=Emergency Cardiovascular Care Revisions for the professional rescuer|publisher=American Red Cross|accessdate=2007-06-15|format=DOC[/tpl]
Barriers available include pocket masks and keyring-sized face shields.  These barriers are an example of Personal Protective Equipment to guard the face against splashing, spraying or splattering of blood or other potentially infectious materials.
These barriers should provide a one-way filter valve which lets the air from the rescuer deliver to the patient while any substances from the patient (e.g. vomit, blood) cannot reach the rescuer.  Many adjuncts are single use, though if they are multi use, after use of the adjunct, the mask must be cleaned and autoclaved and the filter replaced. It is very important for the mask to be replaced or cleaned because it can act as a transporter of various diseases.
The CPR mask is the preferred method of ventilating a patient when only one rescuer is available. Many feature 18mm inlets to support supplemental oxygen, which increases the oxygen being delivered from the approximate 17% available in the expired air of the rescuer to around 40-50%.
Tracheal intubation is often used for short term mechanical ventilation. A tube is inserted through the nose (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the trachea. In most cases tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a cuffed tube is thought to provide the best protection against aspiration. Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the nasopharynx or oropharynx and subglottic stenosis.
In an emergency a Cricothyrotomy can be used by health care professionals, where an airway is inserted through a surgical opening in the cricothyroid membrane. This is similar to a tracheostomy but a cricothyrotomy is reserved for emergency access.  This is usually only used when there is a complete blockage of the pharynx or there is massive maxillofacial injury, preventing other adjuncts being used.[tpl]cite journal |author=Carley SD, Gwinnutt C, Butler J, Sammy I, Driscoll P. |title=Rapid sequence induction in the emergency department: a strategy for failure |journal=Emergency Medicine Journal |pmid=11904254 |pmc=1725832 |doi=10.1136/emj.19.2.109 |date=March 2002 |volume=19 |issue=2 |url=http://emj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/19/2/109 |pages=109–113 |accessdate=2007-05-19[/tpl]

==Efficiency of mouth to patient insufflation==

Normal atmospheric air contains approximately 21% oxygen when inhaled in.  After gaseous exchange has taken place in the lungs, with waste products (notably carbon dioxide) moved from the bloodstream to the lungs, the air being exhaled by humans normally contains around 17% oxygen.  This means that the human body utilises only around 19% of the oxygen inhaled, leaving over 80% of the oxygen available in the exhalatory breath.[tpl]cite web | title=Physical Intervention: Life Support (Rescue Breathing)| url=http://www.doitnow.org/pages/208/208-5.html| accessdate=December 29, 2005 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060125011006/http://www.doitnow.org/pages/208/208-5.html| archivedate= 25 January 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
This means that there is more than enough residual oxygen to be used in the lungs of the patient, which then crosses the cell membrane to form oxyhemoglobin.

==Oxygen==

The efficiency of artificial respiration can be greatly increased by the simultaneous use of oxygen therapy.  The amount of oxygen available to the patient in mouth to mouth is around 16%.  If this is done through a pocket mask with an oxygen flow, this increases to 40% oxygen.   If either an bag valve mask or a mechanical ventilator is used with an oxygen supply, this rises to 99% oxygen.  The greater the oxygen concentration, the more efficient the gaseous exchange will be in the lungs.
