The Conservative People's Party ([tpl]lang-de|Konservative Volkspartei[/tpl], KVP) was a short-lived German political party of the moderate right.  It broke away from the German National People's Party (DNVP) in the late 1920s as a result of that party's increasing radicalization under the leadership of Alfred Hugenberg. Its leading figures were Kuno von Westarp, Hugenberg's predecessor as chairman of the DNVP, and Gottfried Treviranus, who would serve in the cabinet of Heinrich Br√ºning from 1930 to 1932. It was unable to make any significant breakthrough in the subsequent elections. The party did not take part in the 1932 parliamentary elections (1930: 0,8%) and ceased to be politically active before the NSDAP outlawed all other parties in Germany and established a dictatorship.
