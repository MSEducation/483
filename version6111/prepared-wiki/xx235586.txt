[[Phoebanthus]]

CATEGORIES: Asteraceae genera, Endemic flora of Florida

Phoebanthus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.  It includes two species of herbaceous perennials that are both endemic to the U.S. state of Florida.  The genus is a close relative to Helianthus, the genus of the common sunflower, and the plants have the general appearance of a sunflower.

==Description==

Phoebanthus is characterized by having a pappus of short scales that are usually persistent (don't fall off) compared to the pappus of two deciduous awns (and sometimes a few scales) in Helianthus, and Phoebanthus is also characterized by a distinctive type of slender, horizontal tuber that forms the perennating organ.  
The relationship between the two species has never been closely analyzed, but it does not appear that P. grandiflorus is simply an autotetraploid of P. tenuifolius.Schilling, E. E., C. R. Linder, R. D. Noyes, and L. H. Rieseberg. 1998. Phylogenetic relationships in Helianthus (Asteraceae) based on nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region sequence data.
