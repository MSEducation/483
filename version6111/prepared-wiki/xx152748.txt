==Casting and creation==

Hollyoaks' executive producer, Lucy Allan said that Myra is not central to storylines as she is not central to the show. She explained that "Myra plays a very important role as the mother in the McQueen household" but that she would find it "abnormal" to run a storyline from Myra's perspective.[tpl]cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=Lucy Allan (Series Producer, 'Hollyoaks')|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/interviews/a156722/lucy-allan-series-producer-hollyoaks.html|work=Digital Spy|publisher=Hachette Filipacchi UK|date=22 May 2009|accessdate=9 July 2012[/tpl] After Barber-Lane lost weight she was asked to put on weight by producers as she "didn't look like Myra any more".[tpl]cite web|last=Wightman|first=Catriona|title=Barber-Lane: 'I didn't look like Myra'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a212335/barber-lane-i-didnt-look-like-myra.html|work=Digital Spy|publisher=Hachette Filipacchi UK|date=3 April 2010|accessdate=9 July 2012[/tpl]

==Character development==

===Characterisation===

On Myra, a journalist from Hollyoaks' official website said: "Myra McQueen, the mummy bear of Hollyoaks. This formidable matriarch of the village's most fearsome tribe keeps her troublesome brood in line with a mixture of love, understanding and bacon sarnies – all three of which have been in great demand during the McQueens dramatic tenure ... Fiercely protective of her family, Myra's often has to choose between them. ... when push comes to shove Myra will always put her family first".[tpl]cite web|title=Myra McQueen (played by Nicole Barber-Lane)|url=http://www.e4.com/hollyoaks/cast/girls/myramcqueen.html|work=E4|publisher=Channel Four Television Corporation|accessdate=9 July 2012[/tpl] Another journalist for the site added that Myra possesses scepticism, scathing remarks and relentless double standards. They described Myra as the "Queen of the McQueen clan", saying she is the "Mediator of squabbling kids, harbourer of stray relatives, she is the rock which grounds the feral McQueen family through turmoils and tragedies galore". They continued that Myra has a "fiesty, no-nonsense nature" before saying that "with her trademark gold chains and sovereigns, we'd put our money on Myra over Mr T any day".[tpl]cite web|title=Myra is boss|url=http://www.e4.com/blog/hollyoaks/post/yupzxfd864k7cv7wdwxvoi/view.e4|work=E4|publisher=Channel Four Television Corporation|date=1 May 2012|accessdate=21 July 2012[/tpl] Barber-Lane described her character's personality saying: "She can be quite serious, she can be selfish, she can be loving and giving, she can be ridiculously stupid and she can be amazingly clever - all at the same time! What a woman!"[tpl]cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' Q&A: Myra on the McQueens and more|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a324190/hollyoaks-qa-myra-on-the-mcqueens-and-more.html|work=Digital Spy|publisher=(Hachette Filipacchi UK|date=10 June 2011|accessdate=21 July 2012[/tpl] On Myra's parenting technique, Barber-Lane said: "I think like many mothers, she tries her best. Whether her best is up to scratch is another question. She's certainly a very lenient parent, but also she would do anything for her kids, that comes before anything else".[tpl]cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel |title='Hollyoaks' Nicole Barber-Lane praises McQueen family turmoil |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a410613/hollyoaks-nicole-barber-lane-praises-mcqueen-family-turmoil.html|work=Digital Spy|publisher=(Hearst Magazines UK)|accessdate=1 December 2012|date=5 October 2012[/tpl] Claire Cooper, who plays Myra's daughter, Jacqui, also commented on Myra's role in the family, explaining that although Jacqui often adopts a maternal approach in the McQueen family Myra is always "the boss" in the family. She added that both characters possess a "matriarch feel" and if the family had to face a big problem then Myra would be the one to deal with it not Jacqui.[tpl]cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=Claire Cooper on Jacqui, her new boss and 'EastEnders'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a217948/claire-cooper-on-jacqui-her-new-boss-and-eastenders.html|work=Digital Spy|publisher=(Hachette Filipacchi UK)|date=14 May 2010|accessdate=21 July 2012[/tpl]
The character has had numerous failed relationships in her life with the fathers of her children. Barber-Lane described Myra's relationships stating: "She's always fallen for the bad guy, the ones that aren't good for her. They're the ones who give her a challenge along with a bit of fun and excitement. She always believes in true love, though. That's why she constantly gets hurt".[tpl]cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=Nicole Barber-Lane (Myra McQueen, Hollyoaks) |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/interviews/a131174/nicole-barber-lane-myra-mcqueen-hollyoaks.html|work=Digital Spy |publisher=(Hachette Filipacchi UK)|date=7 October 2008|accessdate=30 September 2010[/tpl] Barber-Lane went on to express her interest in introducing one of the fathers of her children, saying: "I'd love for one of the kids' dads to come back, I really would. We've seen one of them already ... but there was no interaction with Myra".[tpl]cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=Bonus Scoop: Hollyoaks' Myra McQueen|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a131334/bonus-scoop-hollyoaks-myra-mcqueen.html|work=Digital Spy|publisher=(Hachette Filipacchi UK)|date=7 October 2008|accessdate=2010-09-30[/tpl]

===Niall's revenge===

Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood announced that a "tall stranger", Niall Rafferty (Barry Sloane), would soon join the serial and "the McQueen family take him into their bosom – Myra's to be precise". He explained that the character is Myra's son who she was forced to give up when she was young. Kirkwood added that the storyline would be "the big storyline" of the year as Niall "wreaks revenge" on the family.[tpl]cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Bryan Kirkwood, 'Hollyoaks' Producer  |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/interviews/a77573/bryan-kirkwood-hollyoaks-producer.html|work=Digital Spy |publisher=(Hachette Filipacchi UK)|date=12 October 2007|accessdate=21 July 2012[/tpl] During the storyline Myra's children begin to disappear making her "panic" upon the realisation. Barber-Lane told Kris Green of entertainment website Digital Spy that Myra no longer wants to look for her son as "she thinks that she's a bad omen. All the bad things that have happened to her, she believes, happened because she gave her son away. However, by trying to find her son, she's being punished in different ways with her other kids. The Catholic guilt kicks in and she feels that it's all her fault. She decides that if she tries to find her son, she'll take him away from the white picket fence and the lovely life that she's created for him in her head. As far as she's concerned, she thinks that he's in a beautiful home, with a lovely mum and dad that are probably lawyers or doctors. That's why she really believes that she did the right thing giving him up when she was young".
Niall lures Myra to the church she left Niall at when she abandoned him at. Niall "stuns" Myra by grabbing her and showing her the step she abandoned him on as a baby. Myra is "completely confused" by Niall's actions but "it slowly starts to dawn on her, especially when she sees the rest of her family in the church". Barber-Lane explained that Niall decides to play one last game with the family and tells that he is "going to wipe them out". Niall decides that he will ask Myra questions and for every one of his questions that Myra answers correctly she can choose one of her children to live. Barber-Lane added that it is "really traumatic" experience for Myra. Myra answers all but two questions correctly and must choose out of her six children which two can live. Myra is told that if she fails to make a decision all of her children will die. Barber-Lane commented that for "a mother, that's such a ridiculously difficult decision. She does choose, though - that's something that comes back to haunt her". Myra chooses Jacqui and Carmel (Gemma Merna) to die, when John-Paul (James Sutton) and Mercedes (Jennifer Metcalfe) volunteer to die. The church exploded and Tina (Leah Hackett) is killed. Barber-Lane explained that Myra "can't forgive herself" for choosing Jacqui and Carmel to die. She added that the family dynamics changed when Myra made this choice. Barber-Lane said that Jacqui is less responsive to Myra and she became stronger than Myra who is "constantly riddled with guilt". She concluded that Myra now lets her children "get away with a lot more things than they usually would" because of her guilt.

===Family===

On her time on the serial Myra has often become involved in her family member's storylines. In one storyline Bart McQueen (Johnny Clarke) steals money from Myra. Bart lies about stealing the money when he is accused by Jacqui. This causes tensions between Jacqui and Myra who has "had enough of Jacqui muscling in". On her characters reasons for not believing Jacqui, Barber-Lane explained that "When Myra stopped believing Jacqui, I think it was also partly because Jacqui had hid all the stuff about Theresa (Jorgie Porter) killing Calvin (Ricky Whittle) and it was Myra's way of saying, 'Listen - this is my house, my rules'. Maybe she was wrong, but Bart's 15 so she felt that she couldn't kick him out as he had nowhere else to go, and she just thought that Jacqui should behave herself!" Jacqui is later raped by Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan). Barber-Lane explained that there is a "part of Myra that thought, 'You'd never let that happen - how have you let that happen? Have you just changed your mind afterwards?" Mercedes lies she is pregnant to cover up her affair with Carl Costello (Paul Opacic), the father of her fiancé Riley Costello (Rob Norbury). Myra discovers her lies and believes that Mercedes should not tell the truth as Mercedes has "landed on her feet" with Riley. Barber-Lane told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Myra believes Riley will benefit the McQueen family financially and take them out of the poverty they are in. Myra is getting "carried away" with excitement and enthusiasm over how her life could change due to Riley. She said that the most important thing for Myra is what is important for her daughters although "sometimes she may forget that for a moment, but she's always there for her kids".
