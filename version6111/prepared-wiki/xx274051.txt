In one case, he registered under the name Nakayama (中山) at the "Crane Hotel" (對鶴館). This name would later be converted to the more popular Chinese name Sun Zhong-shan (孫中山). While Miyazaki Toten had the same ideals as Sun, they could not communicate by speaking, due to their different languages. They communicated by writing Kanji back and forth on paper.[tpl]cite web|url=http://the-sun.on.cc/cnt/lifestyle/20110618/00480_001.html |title=九州荒尾男の事 - 太陽報 |language=[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] |publisher=The-sun.on.cc |date= |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl]
On 7 September 1900, Sun's first overseas visit to Singapore was to rescue Miyazaki Toten who was arrested there. This act resulted in his own arrest and a ban from visiting the island for five years.
The Nanjing Historical Remains Museum of Chinese Modern History has bronze statues of Sun and Miyazaki placed alongside each other.
