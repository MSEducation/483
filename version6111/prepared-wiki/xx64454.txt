CATEGORIES: American record labels, British record labels

At least four record labels with the name Bullet Records have existed.
The earliest one was a record label based in Nashville, USA, which was started in 1946 by Jim Bulliet and C.V. Hitchcock.[tpl]cite book|last=Kingsbury|first=Paul|title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music: The Ultimate Guide to the Music|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517608-7|pages=65[/tpl]  Bulleit was an early partner in Sun Records. Its only national hits were by orchestra leader Francis Craig.  The pop hit "Near You" made in early 1947[tpl]cite journal|journal=Billboard|date=1 April 1967|volume=13|issue=79|issn=0006-2510[/tpl] was a monster, topping the charts for seventeen weeks and having a chart run of twenty-five weeks.  Craig also made the charts at #3 with "Beg Your Pardon", but no further hits were forthcoming.Pop Memories 1890-1954. Joel Whitburn. 1986. Record Research Inc. p. 232. ISBN 0-89820-083-0  Despite these hits, the label was known for country music artists such as Boots Woodall's Radio Wranglers, who also recorded for Capitol Records, and Southern Gospel artists such as the Rangers Quartet and Speer Family. In 1949 they released B. B. King's first commercial single, "Miss Martha King".[tpl]cite book|last=Kostelanetz|first=Richard|title=The B.B.

Jim Bulliet sold out to his share to Hitchcock in February of that year.  The label limped on for a few years but was out of business by 1952.[tpl]cite book |title= The American Record Label Directory and Dating Guide, 1940-1959|last= Gart|first= Galen|year= 1989|publisher= Big Nickel Publications|location= Milford, New Hampshire|isbn= 0-936433-11-6|pages= 36–37[/tpl]
The Bullet, Sur-Speed and Delta catalogs were purchased by Bluesland Productions in the mid-1990s.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
One was a short-lived subsidiary of American Bang Records. Only one album by Peabo Bryson in 1976 was ever released.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]  Bryson's next label Capitol Records now owns the rights to the album Peabo and Bryson's unreleased Bullet material.
The third known label with this name was based in England in the early 1980s, and released NWOBHM artists. Among known releases is the self-titled 1983 debut EP from Danish Pretty Maids.  Bullet Records UK was an offshoot of Bullet Mail Order. Because of its close ties with the British heavy metal scene at that time, it seemed a logical progression to form a label to promote little-known unsigned bands. Amongst the bands on the label were Wrathchild, Pretty Maids, Black Rose N.E.England, Le Griffe, Crisis (from Salt Lake City, USA), Silverwing, Chrome Molly and Taipan Australia. Whilst many of the releases were critically acclaimed, the company suffered from a lack of experience and through various reasons, cash-flow being one, was forced to cease trading in 1984
