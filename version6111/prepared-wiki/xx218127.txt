Nydala Abbey was a cistercian monastery in the province of Småland, Sweden, near the lake of Rusken.
Nydala (from Swedish ny, meaning new, and dal, meaning valley) was called Sancta Maria de Nova Valle or just Nova Vallis in Latin. It was founded together with Alvastra Abbey in 1147 as the first cistercian monasteries in Sweden. King Gustavus Vasa appropriated the abbey in the 1520s, and the Danes sacked it in 1568. Part of the abbey church was rebuilt in the following years, and is still used as parish church. Some other ruins also remain visible at the site.Nydala kloster at the Jönköping county board, linked 19 Aug 2008
