The Copa Master de Supercopa was a football competition contested by clubs that had previously won the Supercopa Libertadores. It was organized by CONMEBOL and only played in 1992 and 1995.
The format of the tournament was different in both editions and a third edition was scheduled to be played in 1998 but the lack of sponsors delayed the event and eventually was cancelled. The first edition in 1992 featured all 4 champions at the time. It was played in Buenos Aires and won by Boca Juniors. The second edition was to be played in 1994 but moved to 1995. Only two eligible teams accepted the invitation to play. The cup was played over two legs and won by Cruzeiro.
The winners of the competitions were also given the chance to participate in a following-season grand super cup called the Copa de Oro. This competition was played three times. The first two competitions featured the respective Copa Master de Supercopa champion; however, as no Copa Master de Supercopa was contested in 1996, the vacant berth for the 1996 Copa de Oro went to the 1996 Copa Master de CONMEBOL champion.
