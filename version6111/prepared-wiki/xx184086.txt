They are members of the Japan Football League (JFL). The club formed in 2007 from a merger of two Sagawa Express corporation football clubs in JFL; Sagawa Express Tokyo S.C. and Sagawa Express Osaka S.C.. The Tokyo side had been in JFL since 2001 and the Osaka side since 2002. The announcement of the merger was on September 14, 2006 and its base would be moved to Shiga prefecture, the company's corporate base. Blue and silver are their team colours. Their home stadium is the Sagawa Express Moriyama Stadium in Moriyama, Shiga.
This merger of two strong teams in JFL proved successful. In their first year of competition in JFL they won the championship and eight of their players selected in JFL Best Eleven 2007. With the promotion of F.C. Mi-O Biwako Kusatsu to JFL, there will be Shiga derby matches in 2008 season. F.C. Mi-O also formed from Sagawa Express Kyoto S.C in 2005. Their first derby match will be played on March 16 at Moriyama and it is also the opening match of the 2008 season.
In 2008 the name of the team changed to Sagawa Shiga FC in a bid to get the support of the local community.
