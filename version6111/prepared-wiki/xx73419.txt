==History==

===Colonial period===

The village of Córdoba was founded in 1618 by the Spanish to protect royal interests from attacks by Gaspar Yanga's slave rebellion.

===Independence===

In August 1821, the Mexican revolutionary Agustín de Iturbide and the Spanish viceroy Juan de O'Donojú signed the Treaty of Córdoba here, ratifying the Plan de Iguala and confirming Mexico's independence.
In 1902 Córdoba became the interchange point of the narrow-gauge Córdoba and Huatusco Railroad to Coscomatepec.

===Modern times===

In 1973 the city was severely damaged by an earthquake.

==Economy==

The main economic activities are agriculture, ranching, industry and trade. The principal crops are sugar cane, coffee, avocado, orange, lemon, and rice, along with some non-traditional crops as anturios, heliconias and palma camedor.
A highway connects Córdoba with the state's principal port, Veracruz. There is an adequate workforce, with a relatively low annual wage, providing opportunities for hiring for industry.
Córdoba is the focal point for the local sugar milling and coffee processing industries, and it is also an important place for marketing and refining tropical fruits.
Several medical institutions provide public-health services in Córdoba, including the ISSSTE, the IMSS, and the SCSP. There is also a local Cruz Roja (Red Cross) hospital, and several private hospitals.
The city has a large number of entertainment centers, including billiard halls, ballrooms and discothèques. Cordoba has three libraries, three auditoriums, a theatre and a museum.

From 1902 to 1953, Córdoba was served by the Córdoba and Huatusco Railroad narrow gauge railroad. The line operated as a unique and scenic [tpl]RailGauge|2ft[/tpl] gauge branch of Ferrocarril Mexicano from 1909 through 1951.
