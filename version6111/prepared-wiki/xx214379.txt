==History==

Elektroprivreda Srbije was founded in 1991, while in the current form it operates since July 1, 2005. Then, the electric power transmission division of EPS was split from the company and established as its own public enterprise, Elektromreža Srbije (EMS). Since 2007, EPS has prepared plans for the construction of new power plants and the expansion of existing plants to increase generating capacity and meet growing consumption demand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.energy-community.org/pls/portal/docs/36382.PDF|title=Electric Power System of Serbia - Energy Community Priority Projects|publisher=Energy Community|date=28 September 2007|accessdate=15 June 2013[/tpl]
