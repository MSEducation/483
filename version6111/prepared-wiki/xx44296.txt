It was also the first album released on Epitaph Records to obtain gold and platinum status.[tpl]cn|date=October 2013[/tpl] Smash was The Offspring's introduction into worldwide popularity and critical acclaim, and produced a number of hit singles including the hugely successful "Come Out and Play", "Self Esteem" and "Gotta Get Away" singles. As a fan-favorite, Smash received generally positive reviews from critics and garnered attention from major labels, including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring would sign in 1996. The album has been recognized as an influential and seminal component of the punk rock and pop punk scene in the mid-1990s. Smash is the only release where the band was referred to as "Offspring".

==Background and recording==

In 1991, The Offspring released the Baghdad 7". This EP was the turning point for the band; due to its success the band signed with Epitaph Records. Thom Wilson, who produced The Offspring's first two albums, had been trying to get the Offspring to switch to Epitaph, a label run by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. Gurewitz felt that The Offspring was just not quite pronounced enough for his label, but Baghdad convinced him to give the band a shot. Wilson and The Offspring entered the studio again and recorded Ignition. Released in 1992, Ignition exceeded all of the label's and band's expectations.Offspring Biography Following the subsequent touring to support Ignition, The Offspring began writing new material for their third album in mid-1993. Recording sessions for Smash took place during October to December 1993 at Track Record in North Hollywood. On the recording process of the album, frontman Dexter Holland told Flux Magazine in 1994, "When we recorded this album, our last one has sold maybe 15,000 copies, so the possibility of us getting played on the radio or anything like that was pretty much nonexistent. Especially because this kind of music is not generally considered acceptable by the mainstream - so, for something like this to happen, it really took us by surprise."[tpl]cite journal |last=Grad |first=David |title=Smashing Punk Kings |journal=Flux Magazine |year=1994[/tpl]

==Writing and composition==

Although Smash has a dark, punk rock sound, the album is heavily influenced by the emerging pop punk scene (as opposed to the hardcore punk influences on their first two albums). Bands like Green Day and Rancid were gaining popularity, and riding on this wave of popularity, Smash's singles became modern radio rock hits. An example of this was the success of The Offspring's first major single release, "Come Out and Play", which reached #1 on Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. "Come Out and Play" features a Middle Eastern-influenced guitar riff.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/28/arts/pop-review-proof-of-punk-s-currency.html?src=pm|title=POP REVIEW; Proof of Punk's Currency|last=Strauss|first=Neil|date=October 28, 1994|accessdate=June 20, 2011|work=The New York Times|publisher=Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.[/tpl]  The lyrics discuss gang violence in high schools.
The second single released from the album, "Self Esteem", became a radio hit, managing to peak at number 4 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, although it didn't hit number 1 like its prior hit, "Self Esteem" was actually more popular and more successful worldwide. The lyrics are about an abusive relationship in which the girl takes advantage of her boyfriend, as he has "no self-esteem" to stand up to her. Contrary to popular belief, the song is not autobiographical. In an interview Dexter revealed that it is about one of his old friends.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] This song was the most successful and most popular of the album's three singles.
The third single, "Gotta Get Away" was another rock radio hit, although it was not as successful as the previous two singles. The song reached number 6 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. Being the last song written for the album, the lyrics describe a point in Dexter's life when he was suffering from extreme pressure due to the then-upcoming deadline of the album. "What Happened To You" is driven by a Jamaican ska beat.

==Reception==

===Professional reviews===

Critical reviews of Smash were mostly positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called it a "solid record, filled with enough heavy riffs to keep most teenagers happy". Erlewine praised the music as "relentlessly heavy". For the album, he claims that The Offspring had "crossed over", because of the success of its single "Come Out and Play", which "stopped and started just like Nirvana." Sputnikmusic reviewer Mike Stagno called it "a fun album to listen to."

===Chart performance and sales===

Despite obtaining early support from the Los Angeles modern rock radio station KROQ, Smash initially received little attention from radio and television stations.

Although never technically released as a single, "Bad Habit" gained some minor popularity when the influential L.A. radio station KROQ began playing the song in early 1995. There was confusion over whether or not it would be released as the band's next single following the success of "Self Esteem". Unlike the first three singles, a video for "Bad Habit" was never released and it failed to chart.

===Legacy===

Smash is regarded by critics[tpl]who|date=August 2012[/tpl] as one of the most influential punk rock albums of all time, and has inspired a number of musicians. During Trivium's early days, guitarist Matt Heafy performed a cover version of "Self Esteem" at his middle school talent show at Lake Brantley High School, while the British synthpop group Cuban Boys also covered that song on their only full-length Eastwood. The album's other hit, "Come Out and Play", was covered by Richard Cheese on his 2000 album, Lounge Against the Machine and again released on the 2006 album, The Sunny Side of the Moon. Brett Gurewitz, the guitarist of Bad Religion and president of Epitaph, had also mentioned that he liked Smash and described it as "a very good record".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=the_offspring|title=The Offspring|accessdate=2008-12-29|publisher=The Bad Religion Page[/tpl] New York melodic hardcore punk band After the Fall mentioned Smash in their song "1994",AFTER THE FALL LYRICS - 1994 which appears on their 2009 album Fort Orange.After The Fall (2) - Fort Orange at Discogs
Along with Green Day's Dookie, Smash was among the most commercially successful punk rock albums released in 1994, a year when the genre reached arguably its greatest popularity. By the end of the year, Dookie and Smash had both sold millions of copies.Bestseller lists and Diamond Certification available at the RIAA website: http://www.riaa.com/gp/bestsellers/diamond.asp The commercial success of these two albums attracted major label interest in pop punk, with bands such as Rancid, NOFX and Pennywise, who had all been labelmates with The Offspring at the time, being offered lucrative contracts to leave their independent record labels, though this offer was rejected.
In November 2011, Smash was ranked number two on Guitar World magazine's top ten list of guitar albums of 1994, between Bad Religion's Stranger than Fiction and Weezer's Weezer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/readers-poll-results-top-10-guitar-albums-1994 |title=Photo Gallery: The Top 10 Guitar Albums of 1994 |author=Grassi, Tony |publisher=GuitarWorld.com |accessdate=2011-11-08[/tpl]

==Artwork==

Smash, as well as the singles "Come Out and Play", "Self Esteem", and "Gotta Get Away" have a common artwork theme: an ominous (and highly distorted) skeleton on the cover, disc, and back of the CD case. The music videos for "Self Esteem"  and "Come Out and Play" also have several scenes with a similar skeleton. This symbol is believed to represent the core motifs of the album: death, greed, suicide, violence, addiction, and abuse. The skeleton is used to represent that the continuation of these acts will inevitably lead to death (or alternatively, the end of the human race). The art direction is credited to Kevin Head and Fred Hidalgo, who also designed the artwork for the Bad Religion album Recipe for Hate."Smash" Linear Notes
