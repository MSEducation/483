CATEGORIES: Manitoba provincial highways, Dauphin, Manitoba

Provincial Trunk Highway 5 (PTH 5) is a provincial highway in Manitoba, Canada.
The highway starts at the U.S. border and ends at the Saskatchewan boundary 13.6 kilometres west of Roblin.  Along the way it passes through the communities of Cartwright, Glenboro, Carberry, Neepawa, McCreary, Ste. Rose Du Lac, Grandview, Gilbert Plains and the City of Dauphin, Manitoba (although a bypass via Highway 5A is available).  Between the western junction with PTH 10 and Ste. Rose Du Lac, this segment is called the Northern Woods and Water Route.
PTH 5, along with PTH 20 and PTH 50, has the distinction of being both a north-south and east-west highway. From the Canada â€“ United States border to PTH 68 east of Ste. Rose du Lac, PTH 5 runs north-south. From Ste. Rose du Lac to the Saskatchewan border, the highway runs east-west.

==Route History==

Before the highway was designated to its current length in the late 1970s, southbound PTH 5 terminated at the junction with PTH 16 (Yellowhead Highway) in Neepawa.  The segment of the highway between Neepawa and PTH 3 at Cartwright, via Glenboro and Carberry, was previously designated as PR 258, while the segment between the U.S. border and Cartwright was formerly PTH 28.
The section between PTH 20 and PTH 10 south of Dauphin was completed in the early 1960s. Prior to this, PTH 5 turned north at Ochre River and entered Dauphin from the east along what is now PTH 20 and PTH 20A. PTH 5 met PTH 10 south in Dauphin's city centre and then continued out of the city following the current PTH 5A/10A route.
