Georgetown University is a private research university in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1789, it is the oldest Jesuit and Catholic university in the United States. Georgetown's main campus, located in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood, is noted for Healy Hall, a National Historic Landmark in the Romanesque revival style. Georgetown operates a law center on Capitol Hill and auxiliary campuses in Italy, Turkey, and Qatar.
Georgetown's founding by John Carroll, America's first Catholic bishop, realized earlier efforts to establish a Roman Catholic college in the province of Maryland that had been thwarted by religious persecution. The university expanded after the American Civil War under the leadership of Patrick Francis Healy, who came to be known as Georgetown's "second founder" despite having been born a slave by law. Jesuits have participated in the university's administration since 1805, a heritage Georgetown celebrates, but the university has always been governed independently of the Society of Jesus and of church authorities.
The university has around 7,000 undergraduate and over 8,000 post-graduate students from a wide variety of religious, ethnic, and geographic backgrounds, including 130 foreign countries.[tpl]cite web |url= http://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-university-search/georgetown-university |title= College Search - Georgetown University |work= College Board |year= 2012 |accessdate= December 9, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://oip.georgetown.edu/internationals/ |title= International Students, Faculty, and Researchers |publisher= Georgetown University |work= Office of International Programs |year= 2012 |accessdate= December 9, 2012[/tpl] The university's most notable alumni are prominent in public life in the United States and abroad. Among them are former U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, dozens of U.S. governors and members of Congress, heads of state or government of more than a dozen countries, royalty and diplomats.
Campus organizations include the country's largest student-run business and largest student-run banking option. Georgetown's athletic teams, called the Hoyas, include a men's basketball team that has won a record-tying seven Big East championships, appeared in five Final Fours, and won a national championship in 1984.

==History==

===Founding===

Jesuit settlers from England founded the Province of Maryland in 1634.[tpl]cite journal|title=Miniatures of Georgetown, 1634 to 1934|first=Edward A.|last=Fitzpatrick|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|volume=7|issue=1|date=January 1936|pages=56–57|doi=10.2307/1974310|last2=Nevils|first2=William Coleman|jstor=1974310|publisher=Ohio State University Press[/tpl] However, the 1646 defeat of the Royalists in the English Civil War led to stringent laws against Roman Catholic education and the extradition of known Jesuits from the colony, including Andrew White, and the destruction of their school at Calverton Manor.[tpl]harvnb|Nevils|1934|pp=1–25[/tpl] During most of the remainder of Maryland's colonial period, Jesuits conducted Catholic schools clandestinely. It was not until after the end of the American Revolution that plans to establish a permanent Catholic institution for education in the United States were realized.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06458a.htm|title=Georgetown University|encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia|year=1909|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|first=E.I.|last=Devitt|accessdate=July 10, 2007[/tpl]
Because of Benjamin Franklin's recommendation, Pope Pius VI appointed former Jesuit John Carroll as the first head of the Roman Catholic Church in America, even though the papal suppression of the Jesuit order was still in effect. Carroll began meetings of local clergy in 1783 near Annapolis, Maryland, where they orchestrated the development of a new university. On January 23, 1789, Carroll finalized the purchase of the property on which Dahlgren Quadrangle was later built. Future Congressman William Gaston was enrolled as the school's first student on November 22, 1791, and instruction began on January 2, 1792.[tpl]harvnb|Curran|1993|pp=33–34[/tpl]
During its early years, Georgetown College suffered from considerable financial strain, relying on private sources of funding and the limited profits from local lands owned by ex-Jesuits.[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|p=12[/tpl] The Maryland Society of Jesus began its restoration in 1805, and Jesuit affiliation, in the form of teachers and administrators, bolstered confidence in the college.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www12.georgetown.edu/undergrad/bulletin/guhistory.html|title=Georgetown: A Brief History|first=Robert Emmett|last=Curran|work=Undergraduate Bulletin|publisher=Georgetown University|date=July 7, 2007|accessdate=August 27, 2007[/tpl] The United States Congress issued Georgetown the first federal university charter in 1815, which allowed it to confer degrees, and the first Bachelor degrees were awarded two years later.[tpl]cite web|url=http://guide.georgetown.edu/slideshows/slides/show11_slide5.html|title=The Federal Charter|work=About Georgetown|accessdate=March 6, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080103020623/http://guide.georgetown.edu/slideshows/slides/show11_slide5.html|archivedate=January 3, 2008[/tpl] In 1844, the school received a corporate charter, under the name "The President and Directors of Georgetown College", affording the growing school additional legal rights. In response to the demand for a local option for Roman Catholic students, the Medical School was founded in 1851.[tpl]cite web|url=http://som.georgetown.edu/docs/History.pdf|format=PDF|work=Georgetown University School of Medicine|title=History|date=March 23, 2008|accessdate=March 24, 2009[/tpl]

===Civil War===

The U.S. Civil War greatly affected Georgetown as 1,141 students and alumni enlisted in one army or the other, and the Union Army commandeered university buildings. By the time of President Abraham Lincoln's May 1861 visit to campus, 1,400 troops were living in temporary quarters there. Due to the number of lives lost, enrollment levels remained low until well after the war was over. Only seven students graduated in 1869, down from over 300 in the previous decade.[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|pp=36–39[/tpl] Lincoln assassination conspirator David Herold attended Georgetown from 1855 through 1858 and received a certificate in pharmacology in 1860. At its founding in 1876, the Georgetown College Boat Club, the school's rowing team, adopted blue, used for Union uniforms, and gray, used for Confederate uniforms, as its colors to signify the peaceful unity among students.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hoyasaxa.com/sports/colors.htm|title=Georgetown Traditions: The Blue & Gray|work=HoyaSaxa.com|accessdate=April 26, 2007|date=August 17, 2005[/tpl] Subsequently, the school adopted these as its official colors.
Enrollment did not recover from the war until the presidency of Patrick Francis Healy from 1873 to 1881. Born a slave by law, Healy was the first acknowledged head of a predominantly white American university with African heritage.[tpl]Ref label|healy|b|b[/tpl] He is credited with reforming the undergraduate curriculum, lengthening the medical and law programs, and creating the Alumni Association. One of his largest undertakings was the construction of a major new building, subsequently named Healy Hall in his honor. For his work, Healy is known as the school's "second founder."[tpl]cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jul31.html|title=Patrick Francis Healy Inaugurated|work=Library of Congress American Memory|date=July 31, 2006|accessdate=July 9, 2007[/tpl]

===Expansion===

After the founding of the Law Department in 1870, Healy and his successors hoped to bind the professional schools into a university, and focus on higher education. The School of Medicine added a dental school in 1901 and the undergraduate School of Nursing in 1903.[tpl]cite news|url=http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=2938|title=Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies Appoints New Director of Development|date=July 30, 2003|accessdate=April 26, 2007|first=Lindsey|last=Spindle|publisher=Georgetown University|work=Office of Communications[/tpl] Georgetown Preparatory School relocated from campus in 1919 and fully separated from the University in 1927.[tpl]cite web|url=http://contentdm.lndlibrary.org/u?/gtown,13|title=Third Grammar Class, Second Section, on the steps of Healy Hall at Georgetown University|work=Loyola Notre Dame Library|accessdate=September 6, 2007[/tpl] The School of Foreign Service (SFS) was founded in 1919 by Edmund A. Walsh, to prepare students for leadership in foreign commerce and diplomacy. The School of Business was created out of the SFS in 1957, and in 1998 was renamed the McDonough School of Business in honor of alumnus Robert E. McDonough.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thehoya.com/gsb-takes-new-name-1.1887082|title=GSB Takes New Name|work=The Hoya|first=Emily|last=Lyons|date=October 9, 1998|accessdate=May 1, 2011[/tpl]
Besides expansion of the University, Georgetown also aimed to expand its resources and student body. The School of Nursing has admitted female students since its founding, and most of the university was made available on a limited basis by 1952.[tpl]cite web|url=http://guide.georgetown.edu/slideshows/slides/show11_slide17.html|work=About Georgetown|title=Georgetown University history: Co-Ed|accessdate=July 17, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080103023223/http://guide.georgetown.edu/slideshows/slides/show11_slide17.html|archivedate=January 3, 2008[/tpl] With the College of Arts and Sciences welcoming its first female students in the 1969–1970 academic year, Georgetown became fully coeducational.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thehoya.com/areen-outlines-women-s-role-1.1887300|title=Areen Outlines Women's Role|date=April 1, 2003|accessdate=May 1, 2011|work=The Hoya|first=Nick|last=Timiraos[/tpl] Georgetown ended its bicentennial year of 1989 by electing Leo J.

==Campuses==

Georgetown University has four campuses in Washington, D.C.: the undergraduate campus, the Medical Center, the School of Continuing Studies (in Chinatown) and the Law Center. The undergraduate campus and Medical Center are together in the Georgetown neighborhood and form the main campus. Other centers are located around Washington, D.C., including the Center for Continuing and Professional Education at Clarendon in Arlington, Virginia. Transit between these locations and the Washington Metro is supplied by a system of shuttles, known as GUTS buses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://otm.georgetown.edu/guts/index.cfm|title=Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle (GUTS)|publisher=Georgetown University|year=2011|accessdate=May 21, 2011[/tpl] Georgetown also operates a facility in Doha, Qatar, and villas in Alanya, Turkey and Fiesole, Italy. In their campus layout, Georgetown's administrators consistently used the traditional quadrangle design.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thehoya.com/years-after-blueprint-ditched-some-lament-missed-chance-1.1881464|title=Years After Blueprint Ditched, Some Lament Missed Chance|first=Jessica|last=Bachman|work=The Hoya|date=May 1, 2007|accessdate=May 1, 2011[/tpl]

===Main campus===

Georgetown's undergraduate and medical school campuses are situated on an elevated site above the Potomac River overlooking Northern Virginia. Because of this, Georgetown University is often referred to as "The Hilltop." The main gates, known as the Healy Gates, are located at the intersection of 37th and O Streets NW, and leads directly to the heart of campus. The main campus is relatively compact, being [tpl]convert|104|acre|km2|1[/tpl] in area, but includes fifty-four buildings, student residences and apartments capable of accommodating 80% of undergraduates, and various athletic facilities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.georgetown.edu/about/key-facts/index.html|title=Georgetown Key Facts|work=Georgetown University|year=2011|accessdate=February 7, 2011[/tpl] Most buildings employ collegiate Gothic architecture and Georgian brick architecture. Campus green areas include fountains, a cemetery, large clusters of flowers, groves of trees, and open quadrangles.[tpl]cite news|url=http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=25425|title=Georgetown Goes Greener|date=July 5, 2007|work=Blue & Gray|accessdate=July 18, 2007[/tpl] Georgetown received a B grade on the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card, and new buildings and major renovations are required to meet LEED Silver criteria.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/georgetown-university|title=Georgetown University|work=College Sustainability Report Card|year=2011|accessdate=January 5, 2012[/tpl]
Healy Hall, designed by Paul J. Pelz in Neo-Medieval style and built from 1877 to 1879, is the architectural gem of Georgetown's campus, and is a National Historic Landmark.[tpl]cite journal|title=Georgetown University's Healy Building|first=Hardy|last=George|journal=The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=31|issue=3|date=October 1972|page=208|accessdate=August 16, 2007|doi=10.2307/988766|jstor=988766|publisher=Society of Architectural Historians[/tpl] Both Healy Hall and the Georgetown University Astronomical Observatory, built in 1844, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[tpl]cite web|url=http://planning.dc.gov/DC/Planning/Historic+Preservation/Maps+and+Information/Landmarks+and+Districts/Inventory+of+Historic+Sites/Alphabetical+Edition|format=PDF|title=District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites|date=September 28, 2009|publisher=District of Columbia: Office of Planning|accessdate=December 13, 2010[/tpl] In front of the Healy and Copley Hall buildings is the large front lawn area, which is crossed by walkways and paths that center around the statue of John Carroll. In addition to the front lawn, the main campus has traditionally centered on Dahlgren Quadrangle behind Healy Hall, which is home to Dahlgren Chapel; however, in recent decades, Red Square has replaced the Dahlgren Quadrangle as the focus of student life.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thehoya.com/eg/campus/locations/redsquare.cfm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040401134136/http://thehoya.com/eg/campus/locations/redsquare.cfm|archivedate=April 1, 2004|title=Red Square|work=The Hoya|accessdate=July 24, 2007|first=Bernadette|last=Simpao[/tpl] North of Red Square is an extended pathway that is home to buildings such as the Intercultural Center (ICC), the Reiss Science building, and the large Leavey Student Center. The northern terminus of the undergraduate campus is marked by St. Mary's Hall adjacent to Reservoir Road, home to the School of Nursing and Health Sciences. Across Reservoir Road is the Burleith neighborhood, where some upperclassmen rent houses off-campus. 
The medical school is located in the northwestern part of the main campus on Reservoir Road, and is integrated with Georgetown University Hospital. The Medical campus includes the historic Medical-Dental Building, the Dahlgren Memorial Library,and other research and classroom facilities.
In the last decade, the West side of the Hilltop has emerged as a new developing area of the main campus. The university completed the Southwest Quadrangle Project in late 2003, and brought a new 907-bed upperclassmen residence hall, the Leo J. O'Donovan dining hall, an large underground parking facility, and a new Jesuit Residence to the campus.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thehoya.com/news/082203/news1.cfm|title=From Hole to Home, Southwest Quad Completed|work=The Hoya|first=Nick|last=Timiraos|date=August 22, 2003|accessdate=May 7, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071024043935/http://www.thehoya.com/news/082203/news1.cfm|archivedate=October 24, 2007[/tpl] The school's first performing arts center, named for Royden B. Davis, was completed in November 2005. The new business school headquarters, named for Rafik Hariri, opened in Fall 2009, and Regents Hall, the new science building, opened in the Fall of 2012. These two large buildings, along with the adjacent Leavey Student Center, have become popular study spaces, and overlook a newly developed scenic lawn space.[tpl]cite news|url=http://explore.georgetown.edu/documents/42565/|title=$20 Million Gift to Benefit New MSB Building|work=Office of Communications|publisher=Georgetown University|date=July 10, 2009|accessdate=July 10, 2009[/tpl]  
The university owns many of the buildings in the Georgetown neighborhood east of the main campus and west of 35th Street NW, including all buildings west of 36th Street. This area is known as "East Campus" and is used for upperclassmen housing, classroom space, along with specific institutions, offices, and alumni facilities. Additionally, the Walsh School of Foreign Service and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences both have classroom buildings in this area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://maps.georgetown.edu/directory/|title=Georgetown Map Directory|publisher=Georgetown University|year=2011|accessdate=May 21, 2011[/tpl]

==Athletics==

Georgetown fields 23 varsity teams and the Club Sports Board supports an additional 23 club teams. The varsity teams participate in the NCAA's Division I. The school generally competes in the Big East Conference, although the football team competes in the Division I FCS Patriot League, the sailing team in Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association, and the rowing teams in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges. U.S. News & World Report listed Georgetown's athletics program among the 20 best in the nation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/020318/archive_020363.htm|title=Why they're not just about winning and losing anymore|author=Witkin, Gordon and Jodi Schneider|work=U.S. News and World Report|date=March 10, 2002|accessdate=July 26, 2007[/tpl] Georgetown's student athletes have a 94% graduation success rate,[tpl]cite web|url=https://web1.ncaa.org/app_data/inst2011/251.pdf|format=PDF|title=Graduation Rates Report|work=NCAA|date=October 21, 2011|accessdate=February 10, 2012[/tpl] and over one-hundred have gone on to play professionally.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thehoya.com/features/012304/features3.cfm|title=Glory Days|work=The Hoya|first=Jon|last=Shoup-Mendizabal|date=January 23, 2004|accessdate=August 27, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070314091240/http://www.thehoya.com/features/012304/features3.cfm|archivedate=March 14, 2007[/tpl]
The school's teams are called "Hoyas", a name whose origin is uncertain. Sometime before 1893, students well versed in classical languages invented the mixed Greek and Latin chant of "Hoya Saxa", translating roughly as "what (or such) rocks." The school's baseball team, then called the Stonewalls, began in 1870, and football in 1874, and the chant likely refers to one of these teams.[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|pp=54, 62–63[/tpl] By the 1920s, the term "Hoyas" was used to describe groups on campus, and by 1928, campus sports writers started using it instead of the older team name, the "Hilltoppers."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hoyasaxa.com/sports/hoia.htm|title=What's A Hoya?|work=HoyaSaxa.com|date=August 17, 2005|accessdate=April 30, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll/dogs.htm|title=The Dogs of Georgetown|work=Georgetown Magazine|date=September–October 1983|first=Jon K.|last=Reynolds|publisher=Georgetown University Library|accessdate=June 30, 2008[/tpl] The name was picked up in the local publications, and became official shortly after. Jack the Bulldog has been the mascot of Georgetown athletics programs since 1962, and the school fight song is There Goes Old Georgetown.
The men's basketball team is particularly noteworthy as it won the NCAA championship in 1984 under coach John Thompson. The current coach is his son, John Thompson III, who coached the team to the Final Four in the 2007 NCAA tournament. The team is tied for the most Big East conference tournament titles with seven, and has made twenty-seven NCAA tournament appearances.[tpl]cite news|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=270690046|title=Hoyas claim their 1st Big East tourney title since 1989|agency=Associated Press|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=July 10, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.9news.com/news/article/188150/613/Rams-hope-to-charge-past-Hoyas-in-Southwest-Regional-clash|title=Rams hope to charge past Hoyas in Southwest Regional clash|work=9news|date=March 18, 2011|accessdate=May 1, 2011|agency=The Sports Network[/tpl] Well-known team alumni include Sleepy Floyd, Patrick Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo, Alonzo Mourning, Allen Iverson, Jeff Green, and Roy Hibbert.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thehoya.com/former-greats-celebrate-hoops-at-100-years-gala-1.1882513|title=Former Greats Celebrate Hoops at 100 Years Gala|author=Goode, Harlan and Brenna McGee|date=February 13, 2007|work=The Hoya|accessdate=May 1, 2011[/tpl] Georgetown's NBA alumni are collectively among the highest earners from a single program.[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204136404577209391406607120.html|title=Basketball's Alumni Loot Index|date=February 8, 2012|accessdate=February 7, 2012|first=Jared|last=Diamond|work=Wall Street Journal[/tpl]
