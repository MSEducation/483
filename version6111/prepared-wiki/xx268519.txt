Baker's technique, created in 1983 (conference presentation) and published in a journal in 1994 by Brenda Baker, is a method for designing polynomial-time approximation schemes, PTASs, for problems on planar graphs. This technique has given PTASs for the following problems: subgraph isomorphism, maximum independent set, minimum vertex cover, minimum dominating set, minimum edge dominating set, maximum triangle matching, and many others. Its generalizations have also led to many PTASs on graphs excluding a fixed minor, such as bounded genus graphs, as well as to other classes of graphs not closed under taking minors such as the 1-planar graphs. The idea for Baker's technique is to break the graph into layers, such that the problem can be solved optimally on each layer, then combine the solutions from each layer in a reasonable way that will result in a feasible solution.

==Example of technique==

The example that we will use to demonstrate Baker's technique is the maximum weight independent set problem.
