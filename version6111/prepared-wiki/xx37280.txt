"This is about the Constitution", Pelosi said. "It is about this Congress asserting its right to declare war when we are fully aware what the challenges are to us. It is about respecting the United Nations and a multilateral approach, which is safer for our troops." Despite Pelosi's opposition, Congress still passed a resolution authorizing President Bush to use the Armed Forces of the United States against Iraq.<ref>[tpl]cite web|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa101102a.htm|date=October 11, 2002|title=Congress Passes Iraq Use of Force Resolution |publisher=about.com|accessdate=October 11, 2002[/tpl]</ref>
