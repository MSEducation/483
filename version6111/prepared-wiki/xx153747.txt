[[Child Protection Registry Acts]]

CATEGORIES: Computer law

A child protection registry or do not contact registry is an electronic database established by statute, to which a parent or guardian may add an "electronic contact point" that is used by or accessible to a child. The statute prohibits certain communications to contact points listed on the registry, and provides criminal penalties for violations of the prohibition.
Child protection registry acts have been enacted in Utah and Michigan.

==Utah Child Protection Registry Act==

The Utah Child Protection Registry Act, Utah Statutes 13-39-101 et seq.,Utah Code - Title 13 - Chapter 39 - Child Protection Registry became effective on July 1, 2005.http://www.le.state.ut.us/~2004/bills/hbillenr/hb0165.pdf  The Act prohibits the sending of a "communication" to a "contact point" that is on the registry for more than 30 days, if the communication either "advertises a product or service that a minor is prohibited by law from purchasing," or "contains or advertises material that is harmful to minors."
A "contact point" is defined as "an electronic identification to which a communication may be sent," and includes an e-mail address, or any of several other types of identifiers, to the extent provided by the Utah Division of Consumer Protection in the Department of Commerce under rulemaking authority granted by the statute, an instant message identity, a telephone number, a facsimile number, or a similar electronic address.
The Department of Commerce has also issued a policy document specifying those products that it deems to be products or services that a minor is prohibited by law from purchasing within the meaning of the statute, i.e., "an alcoholic beverage or product, any form of tobacco, pornographic materials, and any product or service that is illegal in Utah (whether purchased by a minor or an adult), such as illegal drugs, prostitution and gambling."https://www.utahkidsregistry.com/Utah_PolicyStatement.pdf
The Act provides that the consent of a minor to receive such a communication is not a defense to a violation, and that an Internet service provider is not liable for violating the Act "for solely transmitting a message" across its network.
The Act provides that it is a defense to an action for a violation that the violator "reasonably relied" on the electronic registry, and took "reasonable measures to comply" with the Act.

==Michigan Childrenâ€™s Protection Registry Act==

The Michigan Children's Protection Registry Act, (Michigan Compiled Laws 752.1061) was approved and became effective on July 21, 2004.Enrolled bill: http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2003-2004/publicact/pdf/2004-PA-0241.pdf
The legislation is virtually identical to the Utah Child Protection Registry Act, in that it establishes a registry of child contact pointsMichigan Children's Protection Registry : Home and prohibits the sending of a message to a contact point contained on the registry "if the primary purpose of the message is to, directly or indirectly, advertise or otherwise link to a message that advertises a product or service that a minor is prohibited by law from purchasing, viewing, possessing, participating in, or otherwise receiving." The Michigan Act does not contain the "harmful to minors" language of the Utah statute, however.
