The Three Represents ([tpl]zh|s=三个代表|t=三個代表|p=Sāngè Dàibiǎo[/tpl]) or the important thought of Three Represents ([tpl]zh|s=“三个代表”重要思想|t=“三個代表”重要思想|p=“Sān gè dàibiǎo” zhòngyào sīxiǎng[/tpl]) is a socio-political ideology credited to General Secretary Jiang Zemin which became a guiding ideology of the Communist Party of China at its Sixteenth Party Congress in 2002.
Jiang Zemin first introduced his theory on February 25, 2000 while on an inspection tour in Maoming, Guangdong province. He was attempting a comprehensive summary of the party's historical experience and how to adapt to new situations and tasks when he stated:
The official statement of the ideology stipulates that the Communist Party of China should be representative to advanced social productive forces, advanced culture, and the interests of the overwhelming majority.

==Synopsis==

The formal statement of the theory is:
One possible interpretation of the "Three Represents":
One of the main goals of the Three Represents is to change the Communist Party of China into a governmental and more democratic party. This opens up the Party to "the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people", as well as businessmen and managers. This makes for a party ("dǎng" 党) that is much more attractive for a greater number of people. The Theory of the Three Represents is another expansion to what the government of China would define as "allies". Over the years, the number of people that could in fact still be defined as "class enemies" kept reducing, seeing how the number of people that belonged to the "wavering middle" (people that were not allies, but could in fact not threaten the Party's regime) increased.
