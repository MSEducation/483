It was upon the basis of this statement that the perjury charges in his impeachment were drawn up. Clinton was [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached]] by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on December 19, 1998, on charges of [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]].

Jones's legal fund did not cover the attorneys' fees, and Jones's personal life was disrupted during the controversy: she was divorced by her husband, purchased a house after the settlement, and incurred a large tax bill. She then posed nude for Penthouse, stating that she would use the money to pay taxes and fund her two grade-school-aged children's college education. This caused her to be publicly denounced as "trailer-park trash" by conservative commentator Ann Coulter.
