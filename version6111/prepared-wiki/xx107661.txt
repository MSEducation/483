Freetown & Lakeville Public Schools, formally the Freetown-Lakeville Regional School District and Superintendency Union #34 is a school district serving the towns of Freetown and Lakeville in Massachusetts, United States.

==Local vs. District==

The Freetown and Lakeville schools historically existed on two tiers:  the local schools, controlled by each town individually, and the district schools, controlled by both towns.  The elementary schools (originally 1-6, subsequently K-4) were controlled by each town's school committee, owned by each town individually, and were not subject in any way to the other town.  The regional schools (originally Apponequet, subsequently Apponequet and the then-Austin Middle School) were likewise controlled by the both towns under the District.
Under this system, an elementary school teacher is employed by either Freetown or Lakeville, but a middle or high school teacher is employed by the District.  The Superintendent and other main administrative personnel are actually employed by three different entities:  Freetown, Lakeville, and Freetown-Lakeville.
A theoretical "third tier" was added in 2004 when the former Austin Middle School reopened as the George R. Austin Intermediate School.  GRAIS contained not only the District's fifth grade, but Lakeville's local fourth grade, creating a system where one building was under the control of two different school committees.  This has led to minor confusion over which entity is ultimately responsible for the building, even though it remains the property of both towns. This was eliminated in 2009 with the fourth graders moving back to Assawompsett. For the 2012-2013 school year 4th grade will be added from both towns to George R. Austin Intermediate School. Fifth grade will remain as well.
