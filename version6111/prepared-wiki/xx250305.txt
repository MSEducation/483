The Halle–Halberstadt railway is a non-electrified main line in Saxony-Anhalt in central Germany. It is an important link between the conurbation of Halle (Saale) and the northern Harz Foreland. It was opened between 1862 and 1872 in several stages and is operated today by DB Netz.
Between Halle (Saale) Hbf and Halle-Trotha the single-tracked electrified Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn line runs parallel to the Halle (Saale)–Halberstadt railway, but is no longer linked to it at Halle-Trotha.

==History==

The first section, from Halberstadt to Wegeleben, was opened in 1862 along with the Halberstadt–Thale railway. Only three years later the Wegeleben-Aschersleben section went into service. In 1871, this line was extended to the neighbouring village of Könnern, and, in 1872, the last section to Halle (Saale) was completed. At the end of the 1990s the line was completely converted in order to enable it to handle tilting trains with a top speed of 160 km/h. The entire control and safety equipment was modernised (including the installation of an electronic signal box at Sandersleben), The track layouts of many stations were reduced to the minimum necessary. Several stations were abandoned completely.
