Templecombe Preceptory (or Combe Templariorum) was established in 1185 in Templecombe, Somerset, England.
One of the manors within the parish was held by Earl Leofwine who gave it to Bishop Odo of Bayeux after the Norman Conquest. It was his descendant Serlo FitzOdo who granted it to the Knights Templar[tpl]cite book|last=Bush|first=Robin|authorlink=Robin Bush (historian)|title=Somerset: The Complete Guide|publisher=Dovecote Press|date=1994|pages=206|isbn=1-874336-26-1[/tpl] who established a preceptory in the village in 1185.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.templars.org.uk/public/preceps/p_preceps_5_tcombe.htm|title=St Bernard of Clairveaux, Templecombe, Somerset|publisher=Grand Priory of Knights Templar in England and Wales|accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl]
The preceptory served as an administrative centre for the lands held by the Templars in the south west of England and Cornwall. It may also have been used to train men and horses for the Crusades.[tpl]cite book| last=Faith|first=Juliet|title=The Knights Templar in Somerset|page=25-51|isbn=9780752452562|publisher=The History Press[/tpl]
