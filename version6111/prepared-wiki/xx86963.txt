Jerry N. Schneider (born circa 1951) is a social engineer and security consultant. While still in high school in 1968, Schneider started a company called "Creative Systems Enterprises" and began selling his own invented electronic communication devices. Schneider obtained parts by scavenging from Pacific Telephone and Telegraph's dumpsters. During this scavenging, he built up a collection of PTT documents including invoices and training manuals. After a few years, he reportedly knew more about PTT's procedures than its own employees.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.boe.ca.gov/legal/pdf/80-sbe-094.pdf | title="Appeal of Jerry N Schneider" |format=PDF[/tpl]
