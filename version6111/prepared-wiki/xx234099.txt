He received his Bachelor of Arts and Juris Doctor degrees from Tulane University in New Orleans. A P.O.S.T. certified police officer, Windhorst completed the Gretna Police Training Academy.

==Legislative years==

In the nonpartisan blanket primary, also known as the jungle primary, held on November 16, 1991, Windhorst upset and unseated fellow Republican Representative Terry W. Gee, who had served since 1980, beginning with the gubernatorial term of Governor David C. Treen, then of Jefferson Parish. In the primary balloting on October 19, Gee led the balloting with 45 percent, compared to 37 percent for Windhorst. The remaining 18 percent was cast for the lone Democrat in the race, Cynthia Davidson.[tpl]cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10191991/10191991_Legislative.html|title=Election returns, October 19, 1991|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=July 28, 2013[/tpl] In the November 16 general election, Windhorst was the big winner with 61 percent to Gee's 39 percent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11161991/11161991_Legislative.html|title=Louisiana election returns, November 16, 1991|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=July 28, 2013[/tpl]
Windhorst was unopposed for re-election to the legislature in 1995 and 1999.  In 1996, he lost, 56 to 44 percent, a bid for state judge to a longtime friend, Democrat Henry G. Sullivan, Jr., in Division M.[tpl]cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/09211996/09211996_26.html|title=Jefferson Parish, Louisiana general election returns, November 5, 1996|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=July 28, 2013[/tpl] Windhorst later said that he should have waited to run for judge because he really preferred to have remained longer as a legislator.

==Judicial career==

Four years later, on October 7, 2000, Windhorst was elected judge of Division J of the 24th Judicial District Court. In the heated parishwide judicial race for the seat vacated by the death of incumbent Judge Sheldon Fernandez, Windhorst defeated the well-financed campaign of Democrat George P. "Pat" Hand, 56 percent to 44 percent, despite Hand's early start in the race and his support by Sheriff Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish.  Windhorst was supported by Gretna Police Chief B. H. Miller, Jr.  Most political observers considered this another upset victory by Windhorst. This Pat Hand should not be confused with former Judge Kernan "Skip" Hand, a Republican from Jefferson Parish and also a former legislator.[tpl]cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10072000/10072000_26.html|title=Louisiana election returns, October 7, 2000|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=July 28, 2013[/tpl]

==Legislative career==

Drawing on his extensive experience as a criminal prosecutor and police training and experience,  Windhorst became a leader in anti-crime and law enforcement legislation.  In 1993, his second year in the House, he become a key floor leader for the Louisiana District Attorneys Association and the Louisiana Sheriffs Association, having handled many complicated law- enforcement bills. He pushed to fruition laws which permit violent or repeat juvenile offenders to be treated as adults at the ages of 15 and 16, and in limited cases, at 14 years of age. 
Windhorst also gained respect for his ability to handle a broad spectrum of complicated legislation.  The Louisiana Association of Business and Industry recognized his ability to lead tough floor fights and debate. Although LABI had supported Windhorst's opponent, Representative Terry Gee in 1991, it soon aligned with Windhorst for his business-friendly positions. LABI then supported Windhorst in the 1995 and 1999 elections when he ran unopposed. 
Louisiana Welfare Reform Act of 1995
Despite major opposition by the administration and legislative leaders of Democratic Governor Edwin W. Edwards, Windhorst authored and obtained passage of the Louisiana Welfare Reform Act of 1995, which trimmed welfare benefits and attempted to eliminate additional benefits for the births of additional children while on Aid to Families with Dependent Children.  According to Windhorst, the act was also necessary for Louisiana to implement the anticipated federal welfare reform by the Republican Congress during the Clinton administration later, known as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF).
House Leadership Role
In January 1996, at the beginning of his second term and the first of Governor Murphy J. "Mike" Foster, Jr., House Speaker Hunt Downer, a Democrat-turned-Republican from Houma, appointed Windhorst chairman of the House Administration of Criminal Justice Committee, through which all bills dealing with criminal law and gambling legislation must pass before moving to the full House of Representatives.  Windhorst had been strongly opposed by some gambling interests, particularly Harrah's New Orleans Casino, but he was supported for the position by many sheriffs and district attorneys. Windhorst authored and claimed to have personally written all of the Foster administration's gambling reform legislation, which included public referenda and local options for parishes on all existing and future gambling. 
Anti-Tax
Windhorst was a staunch fiscal conservative in the House, having refused to vote for any tax or general operating budget, contending that Louisiana was already spending twice what it needed. Government watchdog and critic C. B. Forgotston listed on his website Forgotston.com the votes of all legislators on tax issues, and showed that Windhorst was the only state legislator over a period of over two decades who never once voted for a new tax, a tax increase, or the extension of any existing tax. 
According to the Baton Rouge Business Report, Windhorst was known for a quick and sometimes sarcastic wit during legislative debate on the floor of the House. Once while under attack by an opponent, Rep. David Armstrong, a liberal New Orleans Democrat, who implied that he (Armstrong) might soon be elected to the Senate and kill Windhorst's bills there, Windhorst retorted, "Well, if you do get elected to the Senate, the quality of debate will dramatically improve in both chambers."

==Awards and memberships==

In 1993, Windhorst was named “Legislator of the Year” by both Victims and Citizens Against Crime and the Alliance for Good Government. In 1995, Windhorst was again named “Legislator of the Year” by the Alliance for Good Government. In 2000, Windhorst was given the first and only "Craig L'Antigua Legislator of the Decade Memorial Award" by Victim and Citizens Against Crime, presented by its president and founder, Sanford Krasnoff.
