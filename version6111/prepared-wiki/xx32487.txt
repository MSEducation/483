==Early life==

Hunter Hayes Understanding Will Self, p.10 As a child, Self spent a year living in Ithaca, Upstate New York.
Self's parents separated when he was nine, and divorced when he was eighteen.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/jun/15/biography.review | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Will | last=Self | title=Biography (Books genre),Books,Culture | date=2008-06-15[/tpl] Despite the intellectual encouragement given by his parents, he was an emotionally confused and self-destructive child, harming himself with cigarette ends and knives before getting into drugs."Living Will"
Self was a voracious reader from a young age. At ten an interest in science fiction grew, with notable works such as Frank Herbert's Dune, J. G. Ballard and Philip K. Dick reflecting the precociousness of Self's reading. Into his teenage years, Self claimed to have been "overawed by the canon", stifling his ability to express himself. Nevertheless, Self's dabbling with drugs grew in step with his prolific reading. Self started smoking marijuana at the age of twelve, graduating through amphetamines, cocaine, and acid to heroin, which he started injecting at eighteen.Will Self's Transgressive Fictions Brian. Finney From: Postmodern Culture  Volume 11, Number 3, May 2001 http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/postmodern_culture/summary/v011/11.3finney.html
Self attended University College School, an independent school for boys in Hampstead in North London.Have I Got News For You?, Series 13 episode 1 He later attended Christ's College, Finchley, from where he went to Exeter College at Oxford University, reading Philosophy, Politics and Economics, graduating with a third class degree.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/you-ask-the-questions-will-self-672941.html| location=London | work=The Independent | title=You ask the questions: Will Self | date=2001-06-06[/tpl] At Oxford he became editor of and frequent contributor to an underground left-wing student newspaper called Red Herring/Oxford Strumpet, copies of which are archived in the Bodleian Library. His reasons for reading PPE rather than English literature were discussed by Self in an interview with The Guardian newspaper: I had a pretty thorough grounding in the canon, but I certainly didn't want to be involved with criticism. Even then it seemed inimical to what it was to be a writer, which is what I really wanted to be.[tpl]cite news|last=Wroe|first=Nicholas|title=Addicted to transmogrification|publisher=The Guardian|date=2001-06-02|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4196343,00.html|accessdate=2007-02-09 | location=London[/tpl] 
Of Self's background Nick Rennison has written that he:
 is sometimes presented as a bad-boy outsider, writing, like the Americans William S Burroughs and Hubert Selby Jr, about sex, drugs and violence in a very direct way. Yet he is not some class warrior storming the citadels of the literary establishment from the outside, but an Oxford educated, middle-class metropolitan who, despite his protestations to the contrary in interviews, is about as much at the heart of the establishment as you can get, a place he has occupied almost from the start of his career.M. Hunter Hayes Understanding Will Self, p12 

==Career==

After graduating from Oxford, Self worked for the Greater London Council, including a period as a road sweeper, whilst living in Brixton. He then pursued a career as a cartoonist for the New Statesman and other publications and as a stand-up comedian. He moved to the Gloucester Road, London area around 1985. In 1986 he entered a treatment centre in Weston-super-Mare, where he claimed that his heroin addiction was cured. In 1989, "through a series of accidents", he "blagged" his way into running a small publishing company.Paris Review – Larger Than Life: An Interview with Will Self, Jacques TestardThe Book of Jobs
The publication of his short story collection The Quantity Theory of Insanity brought him to public attention in 1991. Self was hailed as an original new talent by Salman Rushdie, Doris Lessing, Beryl Bainbridge, A. S. Byatt, and Bill Buford. In 1993 he was nominated by Granta magazine as one of the 20 "Best Young British Novelists".Will Self Speaker Profile Conversely, Self's second book, My Idea of Fun, was "mauled" by the critics.No 242: Will Self The Guardian (1959-2003) (UK) 16 Sep 1993: A3.

At the time, he argued "I'm a hack who gets hired because I do drugs".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/jun/11/willself | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Will Self (Author),Books,Culture | date=2008-07-22[/tpl] He joined The Times as a columnist in 1997.

==Literary style==

According to M. Hunter Hayes, Self has given his reason for writing as follows: "I don't write fiction for people to identify with and I don't write a picture of the world they can recognise. I write to astonish people."M. Hunter Hayes Understanding Will Self, p.1 "What excites me is to disturb the reader's fundamental assumptions. I want to make them feel that certain categories within which they are used to perceiving the world are unstable."Project MUSE - Will Self's Transgressive Fictions
The influences on his fiction mentioned most frequently include J. G. Ballard whom he considers "a great mentor", William Burroughs and Hunter S. Thompson. He has cited[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl] influences such as Jonathan Swift, Alasdair Gray, Franz Kafka, Lewis Carroll, Joseph Heller and Louis-Ferdinand Céline as formative influences on his writing style.
Zack Busner is a recurring character in the fiction of Will Self, appearing in the short story collections The Quantity Theory of Insanity, Grey Area, Dr. Mukti and Other Tales of Woe, as well as in the novels Great Apes, The Book of Dave and Umbrella. Busner is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst practising in London, and is prone to self-promotion at the expense of his patients. He is often the antagonist of the stories he appears in, although not always with villainous intent.
Among his admirers is the American critic Harold Bloom.[tpl]cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Genius : a mosaic of one hundred exemplary creative minds|year=2002|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York|isbn=0446691291|page=648|quote="There are a few affinities, except perhaps with the admirable Antonia Byatt, in the generation after: novelists I also now admire, like Will Self, Peter Ackroyd, and John Banville."[/tpl] Journalist Stuart Maconie has described him as "that rarity in modern cultural life, a genuine intellectual with a bracing command of words and ideas who is also droll, likeable and culturally savvy."Stuart Maconie.
