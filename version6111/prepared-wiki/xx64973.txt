Thomas Truxtun (or Truxton) (February 17, 1755 – May 5, 1822) was an American naval officer after the Revolutionary War, when he served as a privateer, who rose to the rank of commodore in the late eighteenth century and later served in the Quasi-War with France and the First Barbary War in North Africa. He was one of the first six commanders appointed to the new US Navy by President Washington. During his naval career he commanded a number of famous US naval ships including [tpl]USS|Constellation|1797|6[/tpl] and [tpl]USS|President|1800|6[/tpl]. Later in civilian life he became involved with politics and was also elected Sheriff.

==Early life and education==

Born near Hempstead, New York, on Long Island, Truxtun was the only son of an English country lawyer.Toll, 2006 p.120  He lost his father at a young age and was taken to Jamaica on Long Island with relatives and placed under the care of a close friend, John Troup.McBride, 1815 p.27 Having little chance for a formal education, he joined the crew of the British merchant ship Pitt at the age of 12,McBride, 1815 pp.26-27 against his father's previous wishes for him to pursue a career in politics.Toll, 2006 pp.120-121Seawell, 1898 p.43

==Naval service==

Because of his skills, by the time he was twenty, Truxtun had garnered command of his own vessel, Andrew Caldwell. Before the Revolution he was impressed into the Royal Navy and was offered a midshipman's warrant, which he turned down.
He operated as a U.S. privateer during the American Revolutionary War, commanding several ships: Congress, Independence, Mars, and St. James. Truxtun was highly successful in capturing enemy ships during this period, not once suffering a defeat.[tpl]clarify |reason=How did Truxtun go from a pressed man to a privateer? When? |date=December 2012[/tpl]
After the war he returned to the merchant marine, where he remained for 12 years. In 1786 he commanded Canton, operating from Philadelphia, one of the first American ships to engage in trade with China.

==Quasi-War==

In 1794 and the war with France looming, Truxtun was one of the first six captains appointed by President Washington in the newly formed US Navy.Frost, 1845 p.177 During the Quasi-War with France Truxtun commanded [tpl]USS|Constellation|1797|6[/tpl]. For his first assignment he had previously[tpl]when |date=December 2012[/tpl] overseen her construction in Baltimore, Maryland, with Silas Talbot. After a rank dispute with captains Dale and Talbot, Truxtun was placed in charge of the ship by President Washington. He commanded her with considerable success.Toll, 2006 pp.156-159McBride, 1815 p.30

===Constellation engages L'Insurgente===

Because of constant French privateering attacks against American vessels, an American squadron commanded by Truxtun was sent to the West Indies to patrol the waters between Puerto Rico and Saint Kitts with orders to engage any French forces they found in the area. Also on board was the young and later famous John Rodgers, acting 1st Lieutenant.Guttridge, 2005 pp.32-33 On 9 February 1799, while sailing independently of his squadron in his flagship Constellation, Truxtun encountered and engaged the French frigate L[tpl]'[/tpl]Insurgente, a larger and more heavily armed vessel commanded by Captaine Barreau. After chasing the French ship through a storm, Constellation was able to force L[tpl]'[/tpl]Insurgente into an engagement that lasted an hour and fourteen minutes. Barreau did not strike his colors until his ship was almost a complete wreck. French loses were 29 killed and 44 wounded, while Truxtun's crew only suffered one killed and two wounded.McBride, 1815 p.31Toll, 2006 pp.115-117 It was the first battle engagement since the Revolutionary War that an American ship had encountered an enemy ship.Harrison, 1858 p.157

===Constellation engages La Vengeance===

On 31 January 1800, Constellation engaged La Vengeance, a larger vessel with a broadside of [tpl]convert|559|lb[/tpl] compared to Constellation[tpl]'[/tpl]s [tpl]convert|372|lb[/tpl].Toll, 2006 p.135 [tpl]#tag:ref|The French naval historian Onésime-Joachim Troude reports La Vengeance's armament as twenty-six [tpl]convert|18|pdr[/tpl], ten [tpl]convert|6|pdr[/tpl], and four [tpl]convert|36|pdr|adj=on[/tpl] carronades, a [tpl]convert|336|lb|adj=on[/tpl] broadside, compared to Constellation[tpl]'[/tpl]s twenty-eight [tpl]convert|18|pdr[/tpl], ten [tpl]convert|12|pdr[/tpl], and one [tpl]convert|32|pdr|adj=on[/tpl] carronade, a [tpl]convert|472|lb|adj=on[/tpl] broadside.[tpl]clarify |reason=HMS Vengeance or L'Vengeance? See §Constellation engages Vengeance |date=December 2012[/tpl]Batailles navales de la France 1857 |group="note"[/tpl] Constellation had sailed under Truxtun from Saint Kitts on 30 January, and came across La Vengeance the following day. La Vengeance was bound for France under Capitaine de Vaisseau François Pitot, carrying passengers and specie, and initially attempted to outrun Constellation. During the battle Constellation was partially dismasted and was forced to make her way to Jamaica. Thirty six hours after the engagement with La Vengeance, while passing the eastern end of Puerto Rico, Enterprise, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Shaw, arrived and fell in with Truxtun. After a short fall in[tpl]clarify |reason=What's a short fall in? |date=December 2012[/tpl] Truxtun sent Enterprise to Philadelphia with important dispatches.Cooper, 1846 p.129[tpl]clarify |reason=HMS Vengeance, Vengeance, and L'Vengeance.  All same ship?  Three difference ships? |date=December 2012[/tpl]

==Command of USS ''President==

[tpl]USS|President|1800|6[/tpl] was launched on 10 April 1800 and, at the time, was considered[tpl]by whom |date=December 2012[/tpl] America's fastest sailing ship.Toll, 2006 p.15 She was the last of the original six frigates launched. After the vessel was fitted out for sea duty, she set sail for Guadeloupe on 5 August with Captain Truxtun in command, relieving Stephen Decatur. She conducted routine patrols during the latter part of the Quasi-War and recaptured several American merchant ships; however, her overall service in this period was uneventful. She returned to the United States in March after a peace treaty with France was ratified on 3 February 1801.Allen, 1909 pp.217-221
His victories, perhaps most notably that over L'Insurgente, made Truxtun a hero of the time. Consequently, when Truxtun arrived home he was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal on 2 February 1800, becoming the eighth recipient of that body's "highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions."Seawell, 1898 p.51[tpl]cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/house_history/goldMedal.html |title=Congressional Gold Medal Recipients |work=Office of the Clerk |publisher=US House of Representatives |accessdate=2010-09-21[/tpl]
During this period, Truxtun was involved in a dispute over rank with Richard Dale.[tpl]clarify |reason=Again? See §Quasi War; |date=December 2012[/tpl] Truxtun took command of President for a few months in 1800, then retired from the Navy and located first in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and later in Philadelphia. He was offered command during the First Barbary War in 1801 but refused, settling firmly into retirement.

==Writer==

Truxtun had a thorough understanding of the art of celestial navigation and was one among few men of his day who possessed such intimate knowledge of this navigational art. He also designed the original Navy signal manual and wrote the predecessor to the Navy Regulations in use today.Hattendorf, 2011 p.127

==Later civilian life==

Truxtun ran an unsuccessful campaign for the United States House of Representatives in 1810. In 1816 he was elected sheriff of Philadelphia County, serving until 1819.Loubat, 1881 p.129 He also published several books, well-known at the time, covering navigation and naval tactics.[tpl]clarify |reason=Same writings as those covered in §Writer? |date=December 2012[/tpl]
Truxtun died in Philadelphia on 5 May 1822 and is buried at Christ Church Burial Ground.
