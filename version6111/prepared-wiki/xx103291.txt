The Suzuki G engine is a type of internal combustion engine manufactured by Suzuki Motor Corporation for various automobiles, primarily based on the GM M platform, including the:
As well as the following trucks:

==G10==

The G10 is an inline 1.0 liter three-cylinder, four-stroke cycle gasoline engine utilizing aluminum alloy for the block, cylinder head and pistons. It is equipped with either a carburetor or electronic fuel injection and was also offered as the G10T with an IHI RHB31/32 turbocharger and either MPFI or a carburator. It has a single overhead camshaft driving six valves.
A 73.9 mm (2.91 in) bore and 77 mm (3.03 in) stroke give the engine a total of 1.0 L (993 cc/61 cuin) of displacement. It produces [tpl]convert|48|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at 5100 rpm and [tpl]convert|77|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on[/tpl]  at 3200 rpm with 9.5:1 compression in the carburated model, [tpl]convert|55|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at 5700 rpm and [tpl]convert|79|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on[/tpl] at 3300 rpm in the fuel injected model. The original home market version originally offered a carburated [tpl]convert|60|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] JIS at 5500 rpm, later power output fluctuated around 52-55 PS.
From 1984 to 1988 the standard G10 engine used a hemispherical head carbureted design with mechanical lifters. From 1989 to 2001 the engine received updates in the form of throttle body injection and hydraulic lifters. A detuned [tpl]convert|49|hp|abbr=on[/tpl] unit, with a slightly different camshaft, 2-ring pistons and differently tuned engine control unit, was used in the ultra-fuel-efficient Geo Metro XFi model, which delivered as much as 58 miles per gallon. In the US, the G10 in the 2000 Chevrolet Metro became the last engine available on an American-sold vehicle to use throttle body injection for fuel delivery.
Through the 1985-1991 model years a turbocharged MPFI version of the G10 was offered in some markets. This engine delivered [tpl]convert|70|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at 5500 rpm and 79 lb-ft (107 N m) at 3500 rpm. This turbocharged engine, with mechanical lifters, was available in both the US and Canadian Firefly/Sprint/Forsa from 1987-88. Only the Canadian Firefly/Sprint had this option, with hydraulic lifters, in the 1989-1991 model years. In the domestic Japanese market, the car was originally carburated (80 PS JIS at 5500 rpm, [tpl]convert|118|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on[/tpl] at 3500 rpm) and went on sale in June 1984. In October 1987, along with a facelift, the home market Turbo received fuel injection and power output went up to [tpl]convert|82|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] JIS, torque to [tpl]convert|120|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. It was a short-lived version, however, as by September 1988 the car was no longer on sale in Japan.
As is inherent in the physics of the inline-triple engine, the G10 tends not to idle as smoothly as other engines such as a straight-six engine.
This engine has a non-interference valvetrain design.
Applications:
Ultralight aircraft

===G10B===

G10B was an all aluminium engine. It was a four-cylinder 993 cc (72 mm × 61 mm) SOHC 16-valve engine and is the first all-aluminum engine. It was sold in both carburetted and MPFI form. It was widely used in motorsport in India due to its light weight and tunability. The mounting points of the engine block were similar to that of the G13 and so an engine swap was a relatively easy task. It was phased out when production of Zen ceased in 2006. It was made only in India but was sold in all countries the Zen was sold. The G10B is currently installed in the 2011–present Suzuki Cultus for the Pakistani market.

==G12==

The G12B is an inline-four engine utilizing aluminum alloy for the block, cylinder head and pistons. It is derived from the G13BB engine by reducing the bore to 71 mm to dispace 1.2 L (1196 cc). Stroke remains the same at 75.5 mm. It has a SOHC 16V head and the fuel delivery is by multi-point fuel injection. It is Euro-4 emissions compliant. It has lighter pistons and other detail improvements to be a more fuel efficient engine than the G13BB on which it is based. Maruti modified the engine to displace less than 1200 cc to take advantage of the reduced excise duty on such vehicles in India.

==G13==

The G13 is an inline-four engine utilizing aluminum alloy for the block, cylinder head and pistons. Displacing 1.3 L (1324 cc) for the G13A and (1298 cc/79 cu in) for all other G13 engines, fuel delivery is either through a carburetor, throttle body fuel injection or multi-point fuel injection.
This engine was made with different valvetrain designs: 8 or 16 valve SOHC or 16 valve DOHC. All G13 Engines have a bore size of 74 mm. G13A had 77 mm stroke versus 75.5 mm on all other G13 engines.

===G13A===

The SOHC 8-valve G13A has a non-interference valvetrain design.
It was used in the following vehicles:

===G13B===

This DOHC 16-valve engine is well known, it uses the older distributor driven off the intake camshaft, and produces approximately 74 kW (100 hp) at 6500 rpm / 112Nm (83 ft·lb) at 5000 rpm. Redline is set at 7400-7600 rpm. Like many DOHC engines, this engine has an interference valvetrain design, making periodic timing belt changes vital to the
engine's life.
It was used in the following vehicles:

===G13BA===

The SOHC 8-valve G13BA has single-point fuel injection and produces [tpl]convert|50|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|74|lbft|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl] of torque. It has a non-interference valvetrain design. 1995 to 1997 U.S. and Canadian-market engines gained hydraulic lash adjusters.
It was used in the following vehicles:

===G13BB===

The SOHC 16-valve G13BB (introduced in March 1995) has electronic MPFI Multi-point fuel injection, generating [tpl]convert|56|-|63|kW|PS|abbr=on[/tpl] and 104–115 N·m (77–85 lb·ft).[tpl]cite web | title = PKW Suzuki | url = http://www.reinz.de/pictures/PKW_SUZUKI.pdf | page = 1332 (p. 4 of pdf) | publisher = Victor Reinz | accessdate = 2011-01-19[/tpl] Later G13BBs have two coil packs bolted directly to the valve cover, although early models still had the coil packs mounted to the left side of the head - where the distributor was traditionally located. This engine uses a MAP sensor to monitor manifold pressure, unlike the G16 series. This engine has a non-interference valvetrain design. It uses the same G series block found in many other Suzuki models and so it is a popular conversion into the Suzuki Sierra/Samurai/Jimny 4WD, which uses either a G13A (85-88) or G13BA(88.5-98). This allows the engine to fit into the engine bay simply as engine and gearbox mounts are identical and both engines are mounted North-South.
It was used in the following vehicles:

===G13K===

The DOHC G13K was used in the following vehicles:

==G15A==

This engine is a 1.5L 16-valve (SOHC).
Applications:

==G16==

The G16 is an inline 4 cylinder displacing 1.6 L (1590 cc).
Applications:

===G16A===

Either 8 valve single over-head cam carb or 8 valve SOHC EPI before 1993 or 16 valve SOHC EPI after 1993
Applications:

===G16B===

The SOHC G16B was used in the following vehicles:

==J18==

This [tpl]convert|1840|cc|L|1|abbr=in|disp=flip[/tpl] DOHC 16-valve inline-four replaced Mazda's BP engine of the same size, which had been used in the Baleno/Cultus Crescent until then (1998). Bore and stroke (in the European Suzuki Baleno) are 84 and 83 mm and power is [tpl]convert|121|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at 6,200 rpm. Torque is [tpl]convert|152|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on[/tpl] at 3,400 rpm.[tpl]cite book | title = Automobil Revue 2002 | editor-last = Nötzli | editor-first = Max | publisher = Büchler Grafino AG | ref = AR02 | location = Berne, Switzerland | language = German/French | page = 551 | volume = 97 |date=7 March 2002 | isbn = 3-905386-02-X [/tpl]
