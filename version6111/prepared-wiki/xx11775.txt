As a Hollywood business mogul, he, along with his brother Roy O. Disney, co-founded Walt Disney Productions, which later became one of the best-known motion picture production companies in the world. The corporation is now known as The Walt Disney Company and had an annual revenue of approximately US$45 billion in the 2013 financial year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001039/000100103913000164/fy2013_q4x10k.htm|title=2013 Form 10-K, Walt Disney Company|publisher=United States Securities and Exchange Commission[/tpl]
As an animator and entrepreneur, Disney was particularly noted as a film producer and a popular showman, as well as an innovator in animation and theme park design. He and his staff created some of the world's most well-known fictional characters including Mickey Mouse, for whom Disney himself provided the original voice. During his lifetime he received four honorary Academy Awards and won 22 Academy Awards from a total of 59 nominations, including a record four in one year,[tpl]cite web|title=Walt Disney Academy awards | url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/index.jsp | publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=May 21, 2008 [/tpl] giving him more awards and nominations than any other individual in history.[tpl]cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/help/helpMain.jsp?helpContentURL=statistics/indexStats.html|title=Results Page – Academy Awards Database|accessdate=February 16, 2012[/tpl] Disney also won seven Emmy Awards and gave his name to the Disneyland and Walt Disney World Resort theme parks in the U.S., as well as the international resorts like Tokyo Disney Resort, Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland.
He died on December 15, 1966, from lung cancer in Burbank, California. A year later, construction of the Walt Disney World Resort began in Florida. His brother, Roy Disney, inaugurated the Magic Kingdom on October 1, 1971.

==1901–1937: Beginnings==

===Childhood===

Disney was born on December 5, 1901, at 2156 N. Tripp Avenue in Chicago's Hermosa community area to Irish-Canadian father Elias Disney and Flora Call Disney, who was of German and English descent.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/1790811,disney-walt-museum-san-francisco-092709.article| title=Walt Disney, the man behind the mouse| date=September 27, 2009| accessdate=October 21, 2010| work=Chicago Sun-Times| author=Lori Rackl| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20091003001653/http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/1790811,disney-walt-museum-san-francisco-092709.article |archivedate=October 3, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Walt Disney biography|url=http://www.justdisney.com/WaltDisney100/biography01.html|publisher=Just Disney|accessdate=May 21, 2008|archivedate=June 5, 2008|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080605151444/http://www.justdisney.com/WaltDisney100/biography01.html[/tpl]
His great-grandfather, Arundel Elias Disney, had emigrated from Gowran, County Kilkenny, Ireland where he was born in 1801. Arundel Disney was a descendant of Robert d'Isigny, a Frenchman who had travelled to England with William the Conqueror in 1066.[tpl]cite book|title=Disneyland Paris|publisher=Michelin|date=August 7, 2002|isbn=2-06-048002-7|page=38[/tpl] With the d'Isigny name anglicized as "Disney", the family settled in a village now known as Norton Disney, south of the city of Lincoln, in the county of Lincolnshire.
In 1878, Disney's father Elias had moved from Huron County, Ontario, Canada to the United States at first seeking gold in California before finally settling down to farm with his parents near Ellis, Kansas, until 1884. Elias worked for the Union Pacific Railroad and married Flora Call on January 1, 1888, in Acron, Florida, just 40 miles north of where Walt Disney World would ultimately be developed. The family moved to Chicago, Illinois, in 1890,[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=7[/tpl]  hometown of Elias' brother Robert who helped Elias financially for most of Walt's early life.  In 1906, when Walt was four, Elias and his family moved to a farm in Marceline, Missouri,[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|pp=9–10[/tpl] where his brother Roy had recently purchased farmland.  In Marceline, Disney developed his love for drawing[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=15[/tpl] with one of the family's neighbors, a retired doctor named "Doc" Sherwood, paying him to draw pictures of Sherwood's horse, Rupert. His interest in trains also developed in Marceline, a town that owed its existence to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway which ran through it. Walt would put his ear to the tracks in anticipation of the coming train then try and spot his uncle, engineer Michael Martin, conducting the train.
The Disneys remained in Marceline for four years,[tpl]cite web|accessdate=May 21, 2008|url=http://www.waltdisneymuseum.org/|title=Walt Disney Hometown Museum|publisher=Walt Disney Museum[/tpl] before moving to Kansas City in 1911[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=18[/tpl]  where Walt and his younger sister Ruth attended the Benton Grammar School. At school he met Walter Pfeiffer who came from a family of theatre aficionados, and introduced Walt to the world of vaudeville and motion pictures. Before long Walt was spending more time at the Pfeiffers' than at home.[tpl]harvnb|Thomas|1991|pp=33–41[/tpl]  As well as attending Saturday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute,[tpl]cite web|url=http://kchistory.org/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/Biographies&CISOPTR=31&CISOBOX=1&REC=2 |title=Biography of Walt Disney, Film Producer – kchistory.org – Retrieved September 14, 2009 |publisher=Kchistory.org |accessdate=May 31, 2011[/tpl] Walt often took Ruth to Electric Park, 15 blocks from their home, which Disney would later acknowledge as a major influence of his design of Disneyland.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]

===Teenage years===

In 1917, Elias acquired shares in the O-Zell jelly factory in Chicago and moved his family back to the city,[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=30[/tpl]  where in the fall Disney began his freshman year at McKinley High School and took night courses at the Chicago Art Institute.[tpl]harvnb|Thomas|1991|pp= 42–43[/tpl] He became the cartoonist for the school newspaper, drawing patriotic topics and focusing on World War I. Despite dropping out of high school at the age of sixteen to join the army, Disney was rejected for being underage.[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=36[/tpl]
After his rejection by the army, Walt and a friend decided to join the Red Cross.[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=37[/tpl]  Soon after joining he was sent to France for a year, where he drove an ambulance, but only after the armistice was signed on November 11, 1918.[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=38[/tpl]
Hoping to find work outside the Chicago O-Zell factory,[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=42[/tpl] in 1919 Walt moved back to Kansas City to begin his artistic career.[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=44[/tpl] After considering whether to become an actor or a newspaper artist, he decided on a career as a newspaper artist, drawing political caricatures or comic strips. But when nobody wanted to hire him as either an artist or even as an ambulance driver, his brother Roy, then working in a local bank, got Walt a temporary job through a bank colleague at the Pesmen-Rubin Art Studio where he created advertisements for newspapers, magazines, and movie theaters.[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=45[/tpl]  At Pesmen-Rubin he met cartoonist Ubbe Iwerks[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=46[/tpl]  and when their time at the studio expired, they decided to start their own commercial company together.[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=48[/tpl]
In January 1920, Disney and Iwerks formed a short-lived company called, "Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists". However, following a rough start, Disney left temporarily to earn money at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, and was soon joined by Iwerks who was not able to run their business alone.[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=51[/tpl]  While working for the Kansas City Film Ad Company, where he made commercials based on cutout animations, Disney became interested in animation, and decided to become an animator.[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=52[/tpl] The owner of the Ad Company, A.V. Cauger, allowed him to borrow a camera from work to experiment with at home. After reading the Edwin G. Lutz book Animated Cartoons: How They Are Made, Their Origin and Development, Disney considered cel animation to be much more promising than the cutout animation he was doing for Cauger. Walt eventually decided to open his own animation business,[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=56[/tpl] and recruited a fellow co-worker at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, Fred Harman, as his first employee. Walt and Harman then secured a deal with local theater owner Frank L. Newman, arguably the most popular "showman" in the Kansas City area at the time, to screen their cartoons at his local theater, which they titled Laugh-O-Grams.[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=57[/tpl]

===Laugh-O-Gram Studio===

Presented as "Newman Laugh-O-Grams",  Disney's cartoons became widely popular in the Kansas City area[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=58[/tpl]  and through their success, he was able to acquire his own studio, also called Laugh-O-Gram,[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=64[/tpl] for which he hired a number of additional animators, including Fred Harman's brother Hugh Harman, Rudolf Ising, and his close friend Ubbe Iwerks.[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|pp=64–71[/tpl] Unfortunately, studio profits were insufficient to cover the high salaries paid to employees. Unable to successfully manage money,[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=68[/tpl] Disney's studio became loaded with debt and wound up bankrupt whereupon he decided to set up a studio in the movie industry's capital city, Hollywood, California.[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=75[/tpl]

===Film and business career in Hollywood===

As aspiring animators and entrepreneurs, Disney and his brother Roy pooled their money and set up a cartoon studio in Hollywood[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=78[/tpl]
where they needed to find a distributor for Walt's new Alice Comedies, which he had started making while in Kansas City[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=72[/tpl] but never got to distribute. Disney sent an unfinished print to New York distributor Margaret Winkler, who promptly wrote back to him that she was keen on a distribution deal for more live-action/animated shorts based upon Alice's Wonderland.[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=80[/tpl]

====Alice Comedies====

Virginia Davis, the live-action star of Alice’s Wonderland and her family relocated from Kansas City to Hollywood at Disney's request, as did Iwerks and his family. This was the beginning of the Disney Brothers' Studio located on Hyperion Avenue in the Silver Lake district, where it remained until 1939. In 1925, Disney hired a young woman named Lillian Bounds to ink and paint celluloid. After a brief courtship, the pair married that same year.
The new series, Alice Comedies, proved reasonably successful, and featured both Dawn O'Day and Margie Gay as Alice with Lois Hardwick also briefly assuming the role. By the time the series ended in 1927, its focus was more on the animated characters and in particular a cat named Julius who resembled Felix the Cat, rather than the live-action Alice.

====Oswald the Lucky Rabbit====

By 1927, Charles Mintz had married Margaret Winkler and assumed control of her business. He then ordered a new, all-animated series to be put into production for distribution through Universal Pictures. The new series, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, was an almost instant success, and the character, Oswald – drawn and created by Iwerks – became a popular figure. The Disney studio expanded and Walt re-hired Harman, Rudolph Ising, Carman Maxwell, and Friz Freleng from Kansas City.
Disney went to New York in February 1928 to negotiate a higher fee per short and was shocked when Mintz told him that not only did he want to reduce the fee he paid Disney per short but also that he had most of his main animators, including Harman, Ising, Maxwell, and Freleng—but not Iwerks, who refused to leave Disney—under contract and would start his own studio if Disney did not accept the reduced production budgets. Universal, not Disney, owned the Oswald trademark, and could make the films without Walt. Disney declined Mintz's offer and as a result lost most of his animation staff whereupon he found himself on his own again.[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=109[/tpl]
It subsequently took his company 78 years to get back the rights to the Oswald character when in 2006 the Walt Disney Company reacquired the rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit from NBC Universal, through a trade for longtime ABC sports commentator Al Michaels.Stay 'tooned: Disney gets 'Oswald' for Al Michaels, at ESPN web site. Retrieved January 4, 2010

====Mickey Mouse====

After losing the rights to Oswald, Disney felt the need to develop a new character to replace him, which was based on a mouse he had adopted as a pet while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio in Kansas City.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=May 21, 2008|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/mickeymousegoldenage/index.html |title=The Golden Age of Mickey Mouse|publisher=Disney|author=Solomon, Charles |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20080710052034/http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/mickeymousegoldenage/index.html |archivedate = July 10, 2008[/tpl] Ub Iwerks reworked the sketches made by Disney to make the character easier to animate although Mickey's voice and personality were provided by Disney himself until 1947. In the words of one Disney employee, "Ub designed Mickey's physical appearance, but Walt gave him his soul." Besides Oswald and Mickey, a similar mouse-character is seen in the Alice Comedies, which featured "Ike the Mouse". Moreover, the first Flip the Frog cartoon called Fiddlesticks showed a Mickey Mouse look-alike playing fiddle. The initial films were animated by Iwerks with his name prominently featured on the title cards. Originally named "Mortimer", the mouse was later renamed "Mickey" by Lillian Disney, who thought that the name Mortimer did not sound appealing. Mortimer eventually became the name of Mickey's rival for Minnie – taller than his renowned adversary and speaking with a Brooklyn accent.
The first animated short to feature Mickey, Plane Crazy was a silent film like all of Disney's previous works. After failing to find a distributor for the short and its follow-up, The Gallopin' Gaucho, Disney created a Mickey cartoon with sound called Steamboat Willie. A businessman named Pat Powers provided Disney with both distribution and Cinephone, a sound-synchronization process. Steamboat Willie became an instant success,[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=128[/tpl] and Plane Crazy, The Galloping Gaucho, and all subsequent Mickey cartoons were released with soundtracks. After the release of Steamboat Willie, Disney successfully used sound in all of his subsequent cartoons, and Cinephone also became the new distributor for Disney's early sound cartoons.[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=129[/tpl] Mickey soon eclipsed Felix the Cat as the world's most popular cartoon character and by 1930, despite their having sound, cartoons featuring Felix had faded from the screen after failing to gain attention.[tpl]cite news|accessdate=May 21, 2008|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100434|title= Felix the Cat |publisher=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture |author=Gordon, Ian | year=2002[/tpl] Mickey's popularity would subsequently skyrocket in the early 1930s.

====Silly Symphonies====

Following in the footsteps of Mickey Mouse series, a series of musical shorts titled, Silly Symphonies were released in 1929. The first, The Skeleton Dance was entirely drawn and animated by Iwerks, who was also responsible for drawing the majority of cartoons released by Disney in 1928 and 1929. Although both series were successful, the Disney studio thought it was not receiving its rightful share of profits from Pat Powers,[tpl]Harvnb|Gabler|2006|p=142[/tpl] and in 1930, Disney signed a new distribution deal with Columbia Pictures. The original basis of the cartoons was their musical novelty with the first Silly Symphony cartoons featuring scores by Carl Stalling.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=May 21, 2008|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/sillysymphonies/index.html|title=THE BIRTH OF THE SILLY SYMPHONIES  |publisher=Disney|author=Merritt, Russell[/tpl]
Iwerks was soon lured by Powers into opening his own studio with an exclusive contract, while Stalling would also later leave Disney to join Iwerks.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=May 21, 2008|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/disnehis/disn1930.htm|title=Chronology of the Walt Disney Company (1930)|publisher=Island Net[/tpl] Iwerks launched his Flip the Frog series with the first voiced color cartoon Fiddlesticks, filmed in two-strip Technicolor. Iwerks also created two other cartoon series, Willie Whopper and the Comicolor. In 1936, Iwerks shut down his studio in order to work on various projects dealing with animation technology. He would return to Disney in 1940 and go on to pioneer a number of film processes and specialized animation technologies in the studio's research and development department.
By 1932, although Mickey Mouse had become a relatively popular cinema character, Silly Symphonies was not as successful. The same year also saw competition increase as Max Fleischer's flapper cartoon character, Betty Boop, gained popularity among theater audiences.[tpl]cite journal|accessdate=May 21, 2008|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.4/AWNMag2.4.pdf|author= Langer, Mark|title=Popeye From Strip To Screen|publisher=Animation Magazine|date=July 1997|volume=2|issue=4|pages=17–19|format=PDF|ref=harv[/tpl] Fleischer, considered Disney's main rival in the 1930s,[tpl]cite web|accessdate=May 21, 2008|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106382/Fleischer-brothers|title=Fleischer brothers|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica[/tpl] was also the father of Richard Fleischer, whom Disney would later hire to direct his 1954 film 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

After the release of Flowers and Trees, all subsequent Silly Symphony cartoons were in color while Disney was also able to negotiate a two-year deal with Technicolor, giving him the sole right to use their three-strip process,[tpl]cite web|accessdate=May 21, 2008|url=http://www.mbam.qc.ca/disney/index_en.html|title=Walt Disney at the Museum?|publisher=Montreal Museum of Fine Arts[/tpl][tpl]cite web|accessdate=May 21, 2008|url=http://www.fpsmagazine.com/review/070312onceupon.php|title=Once Upon a Time: Walt Disney: The Sources of Inspiration for the Disney Studios|publisher=fps magazine[/tpl] a period eventually extended to five years.

===First Academy Award===

In 1932, Disney received a special Academy Award for the creation of "Mickey Mouse", a series which switched to color in 1935 and soon launched spin-offs for supporting characters such as Donald Duck, Goofy, and Pluto. Pluto and Donald became standalone cartoons in 1937,[tpl]cite web|accessdate=May 21, 2008|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/disnehis/disn1937.htm|title=Chronology of the Walt Disney Company (1937)|publisher=Island Net[/tpl] with Goofy following in 1939.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=May 21, 2008|url=http://members.tripod.com/~kariv/bio.html|title=GOOFY BIOGRAPHY|publisher=Tripod.com[/tpl] Of all Mickey's partners, Donald Duck, who first teamed up with Mickey in the 1934 cartoon, Orphan's Benefit, was arguably the most popular, going on to become Disney's second most successful cartoon character of all time.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=May 21, 2008|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9096160/Donald-Duck|title=Donald Duck|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica[/tpl]
