Route 666 is the second album by the all-female tribute band The Iron Maidens and the first under their Japanese label Powerslave Records. It is also the first release featuring guitarist Heather Baker (who replaced Elizabeth Schall and Josephine Soegijanty). (Soegijanty, however, does appear on the DVD portion of this album.) Produced by Bob Kulick and Brett Chassen (who worked on the 2005 Iron Maiden tribute album Numbers from the Beast), Route 666 is a CD/DVD package, with the DVD featuring the band's live performance at the Galaxy Theatre in Santa Ana, CA, on March 12, 2005. Most notable are the guest appearances of Mot√∂rhead guitarist Phil Campbell and Iron Maiden keyboardist Michael Kenney.The Iron Maidens Store
The cover artwork by Tommy Pons features the band's new mascot Charlotte (named after the Iron Maiden song "Charlotte the Harlot"). Liner notes in the sleeve include commentary by Bob Kulick and Show-Ya vocalist Keiko Terada.
To promote the CD in Japan, the band filmed a music video for "Fear of the Dark," which is featured on their official Japanese website. The video was produced by Oakland, California-based The Pegasus Company. Due to time restrictions on Japanese TV, the song was edited to a running time of five minutes.The Iron Maidens Japanese Website
