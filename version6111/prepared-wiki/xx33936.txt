Ipswich [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Ipswich.ogg|ˈ|ɪ|p|s|w|ɪ|tʃ[/tpl] is city in Suffolk, England of which it is the county city. Ipswich is located on the estuary of the River Orwell. Nearby cities and towns are Felixstowe, Woodbridge, Needham Market and Stowmarket in Suffolk and Harwich and Colchester in Essex.  Ipswich is a non-metropolitan district.
The urban development of Ipswich overspills the borough boundaries significantly, with 75% of the town's population living within the borough at the time of the 2011 Census, when it was the fourth-largest urban area in the United Kingdom's East of England region, and the 38th largest urban area in England and Wales.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/747.aspx|title=2011 Census - Built-up areas| work= | publisher=ONS | accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl]
The modern name is derived from the medieval name 'Gippeswic', probably taken either from an Old Saxon personal name or from an earlier name of the Orwell estuary (although unrelated to the name of the River Gipping).Key to English Place-Names As of 2011, the town of Ipswich was found to have a population of 133,384,Office Of National Statistics while the Ipswich built-up area is estimated to have a population of approximately 180,000.

==History==

Under the Roman empire, the area around Ipswich formed an important route inland to rural towns and settlements via the rivers Orwell and Gipping.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl] A large Roman fort, part of the coast defences of Britain, stood at Walton near Felixstowe (13 miles, 21 km),J. Fairclough and S. J. Plunkett, 'Drawings of Walton Castle and other Monuments in Walton and Felixstowe', Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and History 39 Part 4, 419–459. See also J. Fairclough, Boudica to Raedwald: East Anglia's Relations with Rome (Malthouse Press, Ipswich 2010), 174–77. and the largest Roman villa in Suffolk (possibly an administrative complex) stood at Castle Hill (north-west Ipswich).The so-called 'Whitton' villa, see J. Fairclough, 'Boudica to Raedwald' (cited above), 134–145.
Ipswich is one of England's oldest towns,[tpl]cite web | title=History of Medieval Ipswich | url= http://www.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/ipswich1.html | accessdate=13 June 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=History of Medieval Ipswich | url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesBritain/EnglandOldestTown.htm | title="England's Oldest Town" | accessdate=27 June 2007[/tpl] and took shape in Anglo-Saxon times (in the 7th–8th centuries) around Ipswich dock. As the coastal states of north-western Europe emerged from the collapse of the Roman Empire, essential North Sea trade and communication between eastern Britain and the continent (especially to Scandinavia, and through the Rhine) passed through the formerly Roman ports of London (serving the Kingdoms of Mercia, the East Saxons and of Kent) and of York (Eoforwic) (serving the Kingdom of Northumbria).
Gipeswic (also Gippelwich Emanuel Bowen, An Accurate Map of the County of Suffolk Divided into its Hundreds c. 1760) arose as the equivalent to these serving the Kingdom of East Anglia,K. Wade, 'Gipeswic – East Anglia's first economic capital, 600–1066', in N. Salmon and R. Malster (eds), Ipswich From The First To The Third Millennium (Ipswich, 2001), 1–6; R. Hodges, Dark Age Economics: The Origins of Town and Trade AD 600–1000 (London 1982); S. Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times (Tempus, Stroud 2005), 76–78, 129–133, 148–52, 156–58, 200–202; Rhodri Gardner, 'Ipswich, Cranfield's Mill', in 'Archaeology in Suffolk 2005', Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and History 41 Part 2, 2006, p.251; A.

Malster, A History of Ipswich (Phillimore, Chichester 2000), pp. 5–13. its early imported wares dating to the time of King Rædwald, supreme ruler of the English (616–624). The famous ship-burial and treasure at Sutton Hoo nearby (9 miles, 14.5 km) is probably his grave. The Ipswich Museum houses replicas of the Roman Mildenhall Treasure and the Sutton Hoo treasure. A gallery devoted to the town's origins includes Anglo-Saxon weapons, jewellery and other artefacts.
 
 
The 7th-century town was centred near the quay. Towards 700 AD, Frisian potters from the Netherlands area settled in Ipswich and set up the first large-scale potteries in England since Roman times. Their wares were traded far across England, and the industry was unique to Ipswich for 200 years.K. Wade, 'Gipeswic – East Anglia's First Economic Capital 600–1066,' in N. P. Salmon and R. Malster (Eds), Ipswich From the First to the Third Millennium (Papers from an Ipswich Society Symposium), (Ipswich Society, Ipswich 2001), 1–6, at pp. 3–4.S. J. Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times (Tempus, Stroud 2005), 130–133, 201. With growing prosperity, in about 720 AD a large new part of the town was laid out in the Buttermarket area. Ipswich was becoming a place of national and international importance.Wade 2001.
Parts of the ancient road plan still survive in its modern streets. After the invasion of 869 Ipswich fell under Viking rule. The earth ramparts circling the town centre were probably raised by Vikings in Ipswich around 900 to prevent its recapture by the English.Wade 2001, 5.R. Malster, A History of Ipswich (Phillimore, Chichester 2000), 13. They were unsuccessful. The town operated a Mint under royal licence from King Edgar in the 970s, which continued through the Norman Conquest until the time of King John, in about 1215.J. J. North, English Hammered Coinage (Spink and Son, London 1980), Volume I: Early Anglo-Saxon to Henry III, 'Mint Towns' (page 194), Ipswich, Suffolk: Edgar to John. Example figure:Aethelred II first hand type, Plate X no. 23, Cat. 766 & p. 120. The abbreviation 'Gipes' appears on the coins.
King John granted the town its first charter in 1200, laying the medieval foundations of its modern civil government.Geoffrey Martin, 'The Medieval and Early Modern Borough' in N. P. Salmon and R. Malster (Eds), Ipswich From the First to the Third Millennium (Papers from an Ipswich Society Symposium), (Ipswich Society, Ipswich 2001), 7–17.Text of charter (translated into English) and image of 1200 Town Seal, see J. Wodderspoon, Memorials of the Ancient Town of Ipswich (Pawsey (Ipswich): Longman, Brown, Green & Longmans (London) 1850), 'Ancient Incorporation of the Town', pp 75–130, at pp 75–85. In the next four centuries it made the most of its wealth, trading Suffolk cloth with the Continent.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl]  Five large religious houses, including two Augustinian Priories (St Peter and St Paul, and Holy Trinity, both mid-12th centuryMalster 2000, 41–45.), and those of the Greyfriars (Franciscans, before 1298), Ipswich Whitefriars (Carmelites founded 1278–79) and Ipswich Blackfriars (Dominicans, before 1263), stood in medieval Ipswich. The last Carmelite Prior of Ipswich was the celebrated John Bale, author of the oldest English historical verse-drama (Kynge Johan, c.1538).B. Zimmerman, 1899, 'The White Friars at Ipswich', Proc. Suffolk Institute of Archaeology 10 Part 2, 196–204, at p. 199. There were also several hospitals, including the leper hospital of St Mary Magdalene, founded before 1199. During the Middle Ages the Marian Shrine of Our Lady of Grace was a famous pilgrimage destination, and attracted many pilgrims including Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon.Wodderspoon 1850, 331–332.Malster 2000, 43–47, 63–67. At the Reformation the statue was taken away to London to be burned, though some claim that it survived and is preserved at Nettuno, Italy.Malster 2000, 67.
Around 1380, Geoffrey Chaucer satirised the merchants of Ipswich in the Canterbury Tales. Thomas Wolsey, the future cardinal, was born in Ipswich about 1475 as the son of a wealthy landowner. One of Henry VIII's closest political allies, he founded a college in the town in 1528, which was for its brief duration one of the homes of the Ipswich School.J. M. Blatchly, A Famous Antient Seed-Plot of Learning (Ipswich School 2003), 27–41. He remains one of the town's most famed figures.
Ipswich was a kontor for the Hanseatic League with its port used for import and export to the Baltic.
In the time of Queen Mary the Ipswich Martyrs were burnt at the stake on the Cornhill for their Protestant beliefs. A monument commemorating this event now stands in Christchurch Park. From 1611 to 1634 Ipswich was a major centre for emigration to New England. This was encouraged by the Town Lecturer, Samuel Ward. His brother Nathaniel Ward was first minister of Ipswich, Massachusetts, where a promontory was named 'Castle Hill' after the place of that name in north-west Ipswich, UK.  Ipswich was also one of the main ports of embarkation for puritans leaving other East Anglian towns and villages for the Massachusetts Bay Colony during the 1630s and what has become known as the Great Migration.Thompson, Roger, Mobility & Migration, East Anglian Founders of New England, 1629–1640, Amherst: Univ. of Massachusetts Press, 1994
The painter Thomas Gainsborough lived and worked in Ipswich. In 1835, Charles Dickens stayed in Ipswich and used it as a setting for scenes in his novel The Pickwick Papers. The hotel where he resided first opened in 1518; it was then known as The Tavern and later became known as the Great White Horse Hotel. Dickens made the hotel famous in chapter XXII of The Pickwick Papers, vividly describing the hotel's meandering corridors and stairs. The building now houses branches of Starbucks and Cotswold Outdoor.
In 1824, Dr George Birkbeck, with support from several local businessmen, founded one of the first Mechanics' Institutes which survives to this day as the independent Ipswich Institute Reading Room and Library. The elegant 15 Tavern Street building has been the site of the Library since 1836.
In 1797 Lord and Lady Nelson moved to Ipswich, and in 1800 Lord Nelson was appointed High Steward of Ipswich.
In the mid-19th century Coprolite (fossilized animal dung) was discovered, the material was mined and then dissolved in acid, the resulting mixture forming the basis of Fisons fertilizer business.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yara.com/en/about/history/stories/fisons_inter.html|title=Fisons at the root of modern agriculture|accessdate=17 June 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Ipswich was subject to bombing by German Zeppelins during the First World War but the greatest damage by far occurred during the German bombing raids of World War II.  The area in and around the docks were especially devastated.  The last bombs to fall on Ipswich landed on Seymour Street in March 1945.East Anglia Daily Times

==Modern Ipswich==

Ipswich has undergone an extensive rebuilding and a gentrification programme in recent years, principally centred around the waterfront. Though this has turned a former industrial dock area into an emerging residential and commercial centre, it is being completed at the expense of much of the town's industrial and maritime heritage and in spite of efforts made by a local civic group, The Ipswich Society. Much of this development is residential and is marketed at high net-worth individuals in the DINKY demographic. As such, some have considered it incompatible with Ipswich's existing socio-economic mix. It could therefore be considered to be aimed at encouraging economic migration to the town, particularly as a commutable satellite town of London.
The Tolly Cobbold brewery, built in the 19th century and rebuilt 1894–1896, is one of the finest Victorian breweries in the United Kingdom. There was a Cobbold brewery in the town from 1746 until 2002 when Ridley's Breweries took Tolly Cobbold over.[tpl]cite web | title=Tolly Cobbold Heritage | url=http://www.harwich.net/tolly/ | accessdate=18 June 2006[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] Felix Thornley Cobbold presented Christchurch Mansion to the town in 1896. Smaller breweries include St Jude's Brewery situated in an 18th-century coach-house near the town centre.
The town centre contains the glass-clad building owned by Willis, properly called the Willis Building but still often called the "Willis-Faber building" by locals, as the company Willis Corroon themselves used to be called Willis Faber. Designed by Norman Foster, the building dates from 1974. It became the youngest Grade I listed building in Britain in 1991 and at the time one of only two buildings to be listed and be under 30 years of age.[tpl]cite web | title=PIONEERING MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR MODERN LISTED BUILDINGS | url=http://ihbc.org.uk/context_archive/47/williscarroon.htm |publisher=Context |date=September 1995[/tpl]

Fairline Boats and Spirit Yachts[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spirityachts.com/spirityachts_contact.htm|title=contact us|publisher=Spirit Yachts[/tpl] operate from the dock as does a timber merchant. Other industrial uses dominate to the south of the wet dock. Recently Waterfront Action was formed to help create a friendly, thriving and vibrant community for the Ipswich Waterfront with the initiative being led by Waterfront Churches.
Holywells is the area around Holywells Park, a 67 acre (27 ha) public park, situated near the docks, that was painted by Thomas Gainsborough. Alexandra Park is the nearest park to the Northern Quay of the Ipswich Waterfont and situated on Back Hamlet next to the Northern block of UCS

Ipswich is home to many artists and has a number of galleries, the most prominent of which are at Christchurch Mansion, the Town Hall, in Ancient House and the Artists' Gallery in Electric House. The visual arts are further supported with many sculptures at easily accessible sites. The Borough Council promotes the creation of new public works of art and has been known to make this a condition of planning permission.[tpl]cite web|url=http://online.ipswich.gov.uk/ppc/getDoc.aspx?s_Type=dec&s_File=g%3a%5c1995%5cIP_95_00148_FUL.pdf|accessdate=6 April 2007|title=Grant of Planning Permission|format=PDF[/tpl] The town also has two museums -  Ipswich Museum and the Ipswich Transport Museum.
The New Wolsey Theatre is a 400 seat theatre situated on Civic Drive. Although the Wolsey Theatre was built in 1979, The New Wolsey Company took on the management and running of the Wolsey Theatre in 2000, opening its first production in February 2001.

The younger audience is catered for with Suffolk based Kiss 105-108. On 15 August 2007, Ipswich Community Radio launched full-time after successfully gaining a licence in early 2006.
The town's daily evening newspaper is the Ipswich Star which is the sister title to the county's daily morning newspaper the East Anglian Daily Times.

==Buildings==

In addition to the Christchurch Mansion and Ancient House, Ipswich in the 21st century has some important cultural buildings including the New Wolsey Theatre and the Regent Theatre – the largest theatre venue in East Anglia where, in the 1960s, the Beatles performed when it was still known as the Gaumont.
There are several medieval Ipswich churches but the grandest is St Mary le Tower,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.suffolkchurches.co.uk/ipsintro.htm|title=The churches of Ipswich|accessdate=15 June 2007[/tpl] rebuilt by the Victorians.  Holy Trinity Church by Ipswich Waterfront is one of the few churches in the country which was built during the reign of William IV and whilst the outside looks plain, the interior is quite spectacular. The world's oldest circle of church bells is housed in St Lawrence Church.[tpl]cite news |title=Oldest ring of bells played again |date=10 September 2009 |agency=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8247631.stm |last=Worthington |first=Mark |accessdate=10 September 2009[/tpl]

==Politics==

Ipswich is governed locally by a two-tier Council System. Ipswich Borough Council fulfils district council functions such as refuse collection, housing and planning and Suffolk County Council provides the County Council services such as transport, education and social services.
Between 1979 and September 2004, Ipswich Borough Council was under Labour control. The town was then governed by a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition until May 2011 when it reverted to Labour. The current Borough Council Leader is Labour's parliamentary candidate for the next General Election David Ellesmere.
The town is covered by two parliamentary constituencies: Ipswich, which covers about 75% and is represented by Conservative MP Ben Gummer, and Central Suffolk & North Ipswich, which covers the remaining 25% and is represented by Conservative MP Daniel Poulter.
In April 2006 the borough council initiated public discussions about the idea of turning the borough into a unitary authority[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ipswich.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/53E3AEE4-359D-4226-8AAF-2E985FF49140/0/unitary.pdf|format=PDF|author=Richard Atkins, David Ellesmere, Elizabeth Harsant|title=The case for a unitary Ipswich|publisher=Ipswich Borough Council|date=1 April 2006[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] (Ipswich had constituted a county borough from 1889 to 1974, independent of the administrative county of East Suffolk, and this status was not restored by the Banham/Cooksey Commission in the 1990s). Ipswich, Norwich, Exeter and Oxford united to campaign for unitary authority status for the four towns, hoping to use the window of opportunity presented by the October 2006 Local Government White Paper. In March 2007, it was announced that Ipswich was one of sixteen shortlisted councils[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6498791.stm|title=Town council unitary bid success|date=27 March 2007|accessdate=4 June 2007 | work=BBC News[/tpl] and on 25 July 2007, the Secretary of state announced that she was minded to implement the unitary proposal for Ipswich, but that there were 'a number of risks relating to the financial case set out in the proposal',[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/decision-letter-ipswich|title=Decision letters for the unitary proposals|publisher=Department for Communities and Local Government|date=25 July 2007|accessdate=27 March 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] on which she invited Ipswich to undertake further work before a final decision is taken.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6915736.stm|title=Borough is awarded unitary status |date=25 July 2007 | work=BBC News | accessdate=5 January 2010[/tpl] Early in December plans were thrown into doubt as the Government announced that it had 'delayed' the unitary bids for Ipswich and Exeter.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/news/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&category=News&tBrand=ESTOnline&tCategory=News&itemid=IPED05%20Dec%202007%2012%3A25%3A01%3A000| title=Unitary bid put on hold|date=5 December 2007|accessdate=29 December 2007|work=Evening Star 24[/tpl] In July 2008 the Boundary Committee announced their preferred option was for a unitary authority covering Ipswich and the south-eastern corner of Suffolk (including Felixstowe).Draft proposals for unitary local government in Norfolk and Suffolk[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] Boundary Committee

==Industry==

Industry around Ipswich has had a strong agricultural bias with Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies Ltd, one of the most famous agricultural manufacturers, located in the town. It is notable that the world's first commercial motorised lawnmower was built by Ransomes in 1902. There was a sugar beet factory at Ipswich for many years; it was closed in 2001 as part of a rationalisation by British Sugar. This agricultural link is preserved in the local football club's nickname "The Tractor Boys". The hotel industry has been given a boost with the opening of the brand new Ramada Encore Hotel on Ranelagh Road near Ipswich Town football club.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.encoreipswich.co.uk/|title=Ramada Encore Ipswich |publisher=Encoreipswich.co.uk|date=|accessdate=12 April 2012[/tpl]
The British Telecom Research Laboratories were located to the east of the town in 1975 at Martlesham Heath. They are now a science park called Adastral Park. The area was originally RAF Martlesham Heath – a WW2 airfield. Part of the old airfield is now the site of Suffolk Constabulary's Headquarters.
A key employment sector is Insurance covering both the wholesale and retail sectors, ranging from shipping to motor and household to life. Some of the major players with a key presence in Ipswich include AXA, Churchill, Legal & General, LV and Willis. The presence of the skilled and experienced workforce has also led to the establishment of a large number of ancillary businesses servicing these companies including those offering call centres dealing with sales and claims.
Ipswich is one of the Haven ports and is still a working port, handling several million tonnes of cargo each year. Prior to decommissioning, HMS Grafton was a regular visitor to the port and has special links with the town and the county of Suffolk. HMS Orwell, named after the river, is also closely linked with the town. With the rise in popularity of the town around the Neptune Marina and the Ipswich dock a number of ship and boatbuilders have become established, in particular Fairline Yachts are a significant employer.

==Transport==

Ipswich sits close to the A14 and the A12 roads; it is also on the Great Eastern Main Line from London to Norwich, the East Suffolk Line to Lowestoft and the Felixstowe Branch Line with two railway stations (Ipswich and Derby Road). It is an hour from Stansted airport, 40 minutes from Harwich International Port and is also on Sustrans's National Cycle Route 1 and National Cycle Route 51. The Port of Felixstowe is a major container port [tpl]convert|12|mi|0|abbr=out[/tpl] to the east.
Ipswich engine shed opened in 1846 and closed in 1968, although Ipswich is still a signing-on point for loco crews and a stabling point.
Bus services in Ipswich are operated by Ipswich Buses, First Eastern Counties and several smaller companies.
Ipswich formerly had a municipal airport to the South-east of the town, which was opened in 1929 by the Ipswich Corporation. The airport was controversially closed in 1996 by Ipswich Borough Council, amid significant public opposition to the decision. The site was redeveloped for housing as the Ravenswood estate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ipswichairport.info/history.html|title=Ipswich Airport History|accessdate=3 September 2011[/tpl]

==Sport==

Ipswich's sole professional football club is Ipswich Town, who were established in 1878 and currently play in the second-tier Football League Championship at the 30,300-capacity Portman Road. They were elected to the Football League in 1938. They have a strong rivalry with Norwich City, and have been the previous clubs of the two most successful England managers, Alf Ramsey (who was buried in the Old Cemetery in the town on his death in 1999) and Bobby Robson. They won the League Championship in 1961–62 (their first season as a top division club) during Ramsey's reign, as well as the 1978 FA Cup and the 1981 UEFA Cup under Robson. The club are also undefeated at home in all European competitions having drawn 6 and won the other 25. The club has also fielded many world famous players over the years. These include Mick Mills, John Wark, Frans Thijssen, Terry Butcher and Marcus Stewart.
