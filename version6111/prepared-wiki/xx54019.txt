In Islam, the [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|ḥūr[/tpl] or [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|ḥūrīyah[/tpl][tpl]lang|ar|حورية[/tpl] is also transliterated as [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|ḥūriyyah[/tpl] or [tpl]transl|ar|Wehr|ḥūriyya[/tpl]; pronunciation: [tpl]IPA|/ħuː.ˈrij.ja/[/tpl]. ([tpl]lang-ar|حورية[/tpl]) are commonly translated as "(splendid) companions of equal age (well-matched)", "lovely eyed",[tpl]cite quran|56|22|e=23|s=ns[/tpl] of "modest gaze", "pure beings" or "companions pure" of paradise, denoting humans and jinn who enter Jannah (paradise) after being recreated anew in the hereafter. Islam also has a strong mystical tradition which places these heavenly delights in the context of the ecstatic awareness of God."Heaven", The Columbia Encyclopedia (2000)

==Description==

===Shia scholar description===

Still all in accordance with the Quran, the basic fact of the description of this beauty is how good deeds take the ideal order and proportion to physical forms, how they won't fade away over time, and how they accompany their performers.Allameh Tabatabaei, Tafsir al-Mizan This description is widely used in Sufism and mysticism.Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi, Masnavi

===Other descriptions===

Some descriptions are more superficial rather than scholarly.

==Etymology==

===Classical Arabic usage===

The word 'ḥūr' (حُور) is the plural of both ʾaḥwar (أحْوَر) (masculine) and ḥawrāʾ (حَوْراء) (feminine) see Lane's Lexicon, p. 302 and Hans Wehr, p. 247
which literally translates as "white-eyed", or persons distinguished by ḥawar (حَوَر), signifying "intense whiteness of the eyeballs and lustrous black of the pupils." (ref: Qamus ), hence 'the purity'.Tafsir al'Tabari, and Tafsir al-Razi in 3:52 In 3 of the 4 Quranic verses in which the word ḥūr is specifically used, it is collocated with the word ʿayn (عين) and in this sense is used to refer to the beautiful eyes in terms of contrast between the white and the dark. In general, this word implies 'most beautiful eye' irrespective of the person's gender. Thus, it seems that the most appropriate English rendering of the phrase  ḥūr ʿayn might be: "Companions pure, most beautiful of eye."The Message of the Qur'an: A Great Tafsir of the Current Time - Commentary on Various Marriage-Related Phrases from Surat Nisaa and it is applicable to both male and female.Dr. Israr Ahmad Khan, Department of Quran & Sunnah Studies,"Quranic Description of The Paradise"[tpl]Dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl], IRKHS, International Islamic University of Malaysia

===European usage===

The word "houri" has entered into several European languages (French - 1654, English – 1737) with a meaning of a "voluptuous, beautiful, alluring woman".Online Etymology Dictionary: HouriThe American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000.

===Corresponding Hebrew root===

In Hebrew the corresponding adjective חיוור hiwer has the same root h-w-r, meaning "pale, whitish". The corresponding word for eye is עין Ayin.

==Mention==

===Quran===

The houri are mentioned in several places in the Quran, although in plural no specifics are given as to the number of houries available. Likewise it does not appear from the Quran that they are only women; both sexes are mentioned (although their descriptive qualities are feminine, as alluded to, by the hadiths). They are made available to all believers, not just martyrs.
[tpl]Quote|Thus shall it be. And We shall pair[tpl]ref|A|A[/tpl] them with companions pure, most beautiful of eye.|Quran, sura 44 (Ad-Dukhan), ayah 54[/tpl]

Here are verses that refer to one's spouse recreated in the hereafter:

There are also verses regarding both genders explicitly:

A verse regarding other companionship:

===Hadith===

The Islamic traditions (hadith) also mention the houris. The hadith are divided into several types by hadith scholars, and among them, there are groups that have been poorly documented and therefore, are not valid as a reference.

[tpl]Quote|Muhammad was heard say: "The smallest reward for the people of Heaven is an abode where there are eighty thousand servants and seventy two wives, over which stands a dome decorated with pearls, aquamarine and ruby, as wide as the distance from Damascus to San'a.|Al-Tirmidhi|The Features of Heaven as described by the Messenger of AllahAl-Tirmidhi, Jami` at-Tirmidhi. Vol. IV: "The Features of Heaven as described by the Messenger of Allah". Chap. 21. Hadith: 2687, and also quoted by Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir (Quranic Commentary) of Sura Rahman (55), ayah (verse) 72. (This hadith has a weak chain of narrators)[/tpl]

====Abu Huraira====

were mentioned in the previous verse:

====Damrah bin Habib====

Artat bin Al-Mundhir said:
Quoted by Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir ibn Kathir of sura Rahman (55), ayah (verse) 56:

====Al-Hasan Al-Basri====

Al-Hasan al-Basri said that the word houri implies the righteous women among mankind who are rewarded with paradise as related in the Tafsir of Tabari quoted by Muhammad Asad in his tafsir "Message of Quran" concerning the following ayah:

====Ibn Sirin====

Ibn Sirin mentions Abu Huraira using houri to solve a dispute of whether there are more women or men going to paradise.

===Quran commentators===

====Tabari====

Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari mentions that all righteous women, however old and decayed they may have been on earth, will be resurrected as virginal maidens and will, like their male counterparts, remain eternally young in paradise.

====Ibn Kathir====

Ibn Kathir says that the houri "are delightful virgins of comparable age who never had sexual intercourse with anyone, whether from mankind or Jinns, before their husbands."The Delight of Those Who have Taqwa in Paradise - Tafsir. com for Quran 55:56 by commenting, "in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful."
Ibn Kathir mentions Muhammad saying that there will be sexual intercourse between a husband and his wife in paradise.

====Qurtubi====

Al-Qurtubi reconciled between the hadith of making the majority of the inhabitants of Hell (Jahannam) and Paradise women by suggesting that the women that will form the majority in hell will be among the sinners that will stay there temporarily and will be brought out of Hell and enter Paradise. Thereafter the majority of the people of Paradise will be women.at-Tadhkirah, al-Qurtubî, p. 475

====Razi====

Fakhr al-Din al-Razi comments that the companions of paradise mentioned in Quran 44:54 include "even those toothless old women of yours whom God will resurrect as new beings" and observes that inasmuch as a person's eye reflects his soul more clearly than any other part of the human body in Quran 52: 20.

==Physical attributes==

In relation to the mention of virgins in Quran, several translators like Hilali-Khan, Arberry, Palmer, Rodwell and Sale have translated book 78, verse 33 to refer to "swelling breasts".
In addition, Ibn Kathir, in his tafsir, writes that book 78, verse 33 in the Quran describes the physical attributes of the women. He says the following about the verse: "This means round breasts. They meant by this that the breasts of these girls will be fully rounded and not sagging, because they will be virgins, equal in age."[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=78&tid=56825 |author=Ibn Kathir |title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Abridged, Volume 10 Surat At-Tagabun to the end of the Qur'an |pages=333–334[/tpl]
Abdullah Yusuf Ali, however, translates Quran 78:33 simply as, "Maidens of equal age" with no reference to physical attributes.Abdullah Yusuf Ali: The Meanings of the Illustrious Qur'an, Alminar Books, Houston, TX, 1997[tpl]contradiction-inline |reason= In the other reference http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/078-qmt.php Yusuf Ali says "voluptuous" |date=November 2012[/tpl]

===Alternative interpretation===

It should be noted that the original wording in Arabic is [tpl]lang|ar|وَكَوَاعِبَ أَتْرَاباً[/tpl] (Transliteration: [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|wa-kawāʻib-a atrāb-an[/tpl] - feminine noun).
Muhammad Asad has said regarding the above verse:
Then he continues:

==72 virgins==

The idea of 72 virgins in Islam refers to an aspect of paradise. In a collection by Abu `Isa Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi in his Jami` at-TirmidhiVolume IV, chapters on The Features of Heaven as described by the Messenger of Allah, chapter 21: About the Smallest Reward for the People of Heaven, hadith 2687 and also quoted by Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir ibn Kathir of sura 55[tpl]cite quran|55|72|style=nosup[/tpl] it is stated:
However, regarding the above statement Hafiz Salahuddin Yusuf has said: "The narration, which claims that everyone would have seventy-two wives has a weak chain of narrators." There is also a theory that the promise of 72 virgins is a mistranslation from "72 angels".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/jan/12/books.guardianreview5 | work=The Guardian | first=Ibn | last=Warraq | title=Virgins? What virgins? | date=2002-01-12[/tpl]
In the same collection of hadiths, however, the following is judged strong (hasan sahih):

===Alternative views===

An interpretation of the relevant passages of the Quran is The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran written by Christoph Luxenberg. In respect of this particular point, Luxenberg argues that the relevant passage actually translates to a portrayal of paradise as a lush garden with pooling water and trees with rare fruit, including white raisins (considered to be delicacies at the time that the Quran was written), not virgin maidens.[tpl]cite book|title=Islam: A Mosaic, Not a Monolith|author=Vartan Gregorian|pages=19|year=2003|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=0-8157-3283-X[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Alexander Stille|title=Scholars Are Quietly Offering New Theories of the Koran|work=New York Times|date=2002-03-02|pages=A1[/tpl]
