Later, one day Krish gets to know that Megha and Bhoomi's fathers are step-brothers and they have a family rivalry between them from ages. Krish meets the two brother's grandfather (Haradhan Bandopadhyay) and gets to know why they have the rivalry and also gets to know that grandfather wants them to be together again. The grandfather gives the responsibility to Krish to get the two families together again and if he is successful he will get Megha or Bhoomi- whoever he is in love with hand in marriage. Krish falls in a big problem as he is not interested in all this family rivalry. But later he decides to get the family together. In the meantime, Megha gets the wrong idea that Krish and Bhoomi is cheating her and Krish is in love with Bhoomi and not her. Due to the untimely death of Late Shri Haradhan Bandopadhay,the climax of the movie was changed which made it different from the original story of Brindavanam where Krish marries Bhoomi as Meera explained.
