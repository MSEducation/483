[[Transsystemic]]

CATEGORIES: Legal education

Transsystemic is a term referring to the teaching of two legal traditions in an intertwined fashion. For example, at the McGill University Faculty of Law in Montreal, Quebec, Quebec civil law and Canadian common law are taught at the same time in the same courses in a non-comparative manner.http://www.mcgill.ca/crdpcq/transsystemic/ The program is considered to be the only true transsystemic law program in the world, developed at the turn of the 21st century by then Dean of Law Stephen Toope.http://www.mcgill.ca/files/crdpcq/Arthurs_madly.pdf The program, which started in 1999, offers students the opportunity to graduate with two separate law degrees taught at the same time, whereas other law schools that offer both civil and common law degrees teach the degrees during separate periods of the study program.
