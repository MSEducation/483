The GVB, historically known as Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf, is the local public transport company of Amsterdam. As of 2007, the GVB is an independent corporation wholly owned by the city of Amsterdam.

==History==

The forerunner of the GVB, the Gemeentetram Amsterdam (GTA) (Amsterdam Municipal Tramway), was established in 1900 by the city after it acquired a private tram company. In 1925, it introduced its first bus line. In 1943, the GVB acquired its current form when Gemeentetram merged with Gemeenteveren Amsterdam, the municipal ferry company, and got its name Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf (municipal transport company).
In 2007 GVB was privatised and hence the full name was abolished.

==Network==

The GVB operates a number of public transportation networks in and around the city of Amsterdam, including:
In addition, a new metro line, the North/South line, is under construction and is scheduled to be completed in 2017.
Since 2006 the responsible local authority for all public transport in the greater Amsterdam area is the City Region of Amsterdam / Stadsregio Amsterdam. In 2010 the SRA prolonged the concession (contract) of the GVB for the period 2012â€“2017.
In accordance with the rules for public procurement in the European Union the SRA has to open a call for bids for the next period, which means that an other company could be operating the public transport networks in Amsterdam after 2017.

Route 6 (Plantage Parklaan - Leidseplein - VUMC) was discontinued in 2006.

==Ticketing==

The Amsterdam public transport network falls under the National Tariff System of the Netherlands and the GVB has a few of its own tickets, notably the 24-, 48- and 72- hour tickets. The electronic OV-chipkaart has been the only ticketing system valid in the Amsterdam metro since the summer of 2009, and in the rest of the network (tram, bus) since June 2010. Most trams carry conductors, but as they no longer stamp passengers' strippenkaarten their role has been deskilled; it now consists in ensuring security along with selling the occasional OV-chipkaart and optionally announcing the stops.
