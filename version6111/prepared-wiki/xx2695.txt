==History==

The Latin letter 'E' differs little from its derivational source, the Greek letter epsilon, 'Ε'. In etymology, the Semitic hê  has been suggested to have started as a praying or calling human figure (hillul 'jubilation'), and was probably based on a similar Egyptian hieroglyph that indicated a different pronunciation. In Semitic, the letter represented [tpl]IPA|/h/[/tpl] (and [tpl]IPA|/e/[/tpl] in foreign words), in Greek hê became  epsilon with the value [tpl]IPA|/e/[/tpl].  Etruscans and Romans followed this usage. Although Middle English spelling used 'e' to represent long and short [tpl]IPA|/e/[/tpl], the Great Vowel Shift changed long [tpl]IPA|/eː/[/tpl] (as in 'me' or 'bee') to [tpl]IPA|/iː/[/tpl] while short [tpl]IPA|/e/[/tpl] (as in 'met' or 'bed') remained a mid vowel.

==Use in English==

In English orthography, e can represent the "short e" sound [tpl]IPAc-en|ɛ[/tpl], the "long e" sound [tpl]IPAc-en|iː[/tpl] or be silent when word-final, with a "lengthening" effect on previous vowels (for example rat has a short vowel and rate has a long one). Some of the digraphs it occurs in are ee, ea, eu/ew, ei/ey, i.e., ui. In loanwords, 'e' or 'é' can represent the sound [tpl]IPAc-en|eɪ[/tpl] as in 'café'.

==Use in other languages==

In the International Phonetic Alphabet, /e/ represents the close-mid front unrounded vowel. In the orthography of many languages it represents either this or /[tpl]IPA link|ɛ[/tpl]/, or some variation (such as a nasalized version) of these sounds, often with diacritics (as: [tpl]angle bracket|e ê é è ë ē ĕ ě ẽ ė ẹ ę ẻ[/tpl]) to indicate contrasts.  Less commonly, as in Saanich, E represents a mid-central vowel /ə/. Digraphs with 'e' are common to indicate diphthongs and monophthongs, such as 'ea' or 'ee' for [tpl]IPA|/iː/[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|/eɪ/[/tpl] in English, 'ei' for [tpl]IPA|/aɪ/[/tpl] in German, and 'eu' for [tpl]IPA|/ø/[/tpl] in French or [tpl]IPA|/ɔɪ/[/tpl] in German.

==Most common letter==

'E' is the most common (or highest-frequency) letter in the English alphabet (starting off the typographer's phrase ETAOIN SHRDLU) and several other European languages, which has implications in both cryptography and data compression. This makes it a hard and popular letter to use when writing lipograms. Ernest Vincent Wright's Gadsby (1939) is considered a "dreadful" novel, and that "at least part of Wright's narrative issues were caused by language limitations imposed by the lack of E."Ross Eckler, Making the Alphabet Dance: Recreational Word Play. New York: St. Martin's Press (1996): 3 Both Georges Perec's novel A Void (La Disparition) (1969) and its English translation by Gilbert Adair omit 'e' and are considered better works.Eckler (1996): 3. Perec's novel "was so well written that at least some reviewers never realized the existence of a letter constraint."
