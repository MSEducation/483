George Henry Townsend (died 1869) was an English literary compiler and journalist, who wrote several books that are of value in a study of his period.
Townsend's books include Russell's History of Modern Europe epitomised (1857), Shakespeare not an Impostor (1857), The Manual of Dates (1862), Men of the Time (1868), The Handbook of the Year 1868 (1869) and The Every-day Book of Modern Literature (1870).
Between 1860 and 1866 Townsend wrote several pamphlets containing selections of madrigals and glees for John "Paddy" Green, the proprietor of Evans's music and supper rooms, 43 Covent Garden.
He wrote a Summary of Persian History, included as a preface to a book on Outram and Havelock's Persian Campaign and published in 1858.[ref]

During the elections of 1868 he was an active supporter of the Conservative party led by Benjamin Disraeli, and was promised a position in reward. However, the government resigned before this promise could be kept.
Deeply disappointed, Townsend committed suicide at Kennington on 23 February 1869.
