[[Peterborough Transcript]]

CATEGORIES: Newspapers published in New Hampshire

The Peterborough Transcript was a weekly newspaper published in Peterborough, New Hampshire for 157 years. It was founded in 1849, and remained the only local weekly newspaper for more than a century. It was owned by the Cummings family from 1900 until September 2006, when it was bought by the competing Monadnock Ledger, and became part of the Monadnock Ledger-Transcript. 
In a story announcing the merger, then-publisher Joe Cummings described the paper's history:
"John Miller and Kendall Scott founded the Transcript in 1849. Originally named the Contoocook Transcript, this newspaper was the fourth newspaper in Peterborough, the previous three having failed. In its first issue, the publishers stated, 'In commencing this enterprise, we frankly tell you that we have our doubts and fears in regard to its ultimate success.'
"In 1900, George Cummings sold his soapstone quarry in Francestown to purchase the Transcript. It has been in the Cummings family ever since. Four generations have served as its publishers. After George, Paul Cummings Sr. served in that post, followed by his son Paul Jr., who took over the reins in 1946. Joe, Paulâ€™s son, presently serves as publisher." 403 Forbidden
