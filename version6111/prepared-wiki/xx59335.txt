Te Kooti's War was among the last of the New Zealand wars, the series of 19th century conflicts between the Māori and the colonising European settlers. It was fought in the East Coast region and across the heavily forested central North Island between New Zealand government military forces and followers of spiritual leader Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki. 
The conflict was sparked by Te Kooti's return to New Zealand after two years of internment on the Chatham Islands, from where he had escaped with almost 200 Māori prisoners of war and their families. Te Kooti, who had been held without trial on the island for two years, told the government he and his followers wished to be left in peace and would fight only if pursued and attacked. But two weeks after their return to New Zealand, Te Kooti's party found itself being pursued by a force of militia, government troops and Māori volunteers and routed them in an ambush, seizing arms, ammunution, food and horses. The engagement was the first in what became a four-year guerrilla war, involving more than 30 expeditions[tpl]cite book | last = Belich | first = James | authorlink =James Belich (historian) | title =The New Zealand Wars | publisher =Penguin | year = 1986| location =Auckland | page =216 | isbn =0-14-027504-5[/tpl] by colonial and Māori troops against Te Kooti's dwindling number of warriors.
In early 1870 Te Kooti gained refuge from Tūhoe tribes, which consequently suffered a series of damaging raids in which crops and villages were destroyed, as other Māori iwi were lured by the promise of a ₤5000 reward for Te Kooti's capture. Te Kooti was finally granted sanctuary by the Māori king in 1872 and moved to the King Country, where he continued to develop rituals, texts and prayers of his Ringatū faith. He was formally pardoned by the government in February 1883 and died in 1893.

==Background to war==

Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki was born about 1832 into the Ngati Maru sub-tribe of the Māori people in Poverty Bay on the south shore of East Cape. By the age of 20 he had become known as one of a group of "bother boys" or "social bandits" who led protests over land rights in the Makaraka district near present-day Gisborne, seizing horses and cattle that were being grazed without agreement on Māori land and also plundering settlers' homes, often taking alcohol. The protests were part of a movement to recover occupied land and set up a "coalition" against the government.[tpl]cite book  | last = Binney | first = Judith | authorlink =Judith Binney | title = Redemption Songs | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | date = 1995 | location = Honolulu | pages =16, 21-22, 35|  isbn =0-8248-1975-6[/tpl]
Despite his involvement in land politics, Te Kooti stayed clear of the Pai Mārire (Hauhau) religion when it spread to the East Coast in early 1865.[tpl]cite book  | last = Binney | first = Judith | authorlink =Judith Binney | title = Redemption Songs | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | date = 1995 | location = Honolulu | pages =44-57|  isbn =0-8248-1975-6[/tpl] He fought with kūpapa ("loyal") Māori and government troops against Pai Mārire men, women and children in the week-long siege of Waerenga-a-Hika in October 1865. Te Kooi claimed to have killed two Pai Mārire fighters in the battle, but was accused of being a spy and was arrested after the siege ended. He was released after an investigation, but five months later, on 3 March 1866, he was seized again—for reasons now unclear, but probably after accusations by prominent Māori and settlers he had antagonised—and shipped with several hundred Pai Mārire prisoners and their families to the Chatham Islands for internment without trial. His repeated pleas to be told of what offence he had been accused of, and to be put on trial, were ignored.[tpl]cite book  | last = Binney | first = Judith | authorlink =Judith Binney | title = Redemption Songs | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | date = 1995 | location = Honolulu | page =59|  isbn =0-8248-1975-6[/tpl]
Prisoners were kept in poor conditions with minimal health care and forced to build roads and barracks and plough cultivations without the aid of animals. In April 1867, a year after their arrival, prisoners were told they would not be repatriated until East Coast land confiscations had been determined. By 1868 the mood of the exiles darkened as they realised there were no plans to return them to New Zealand.[tpl]cite book  | last = Binney | first = Judith | authorlink =Judith Binney | title = Redemption Songs | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | date = 1995 | location = Honolulu | pages =63-73|  isbn =0-8248-1975-6[/tpl] On 4 July 1868 Te Kooti led a carefully planned and executed breakout from their internment, overpowering guards, seizing arms and ammunition and commandeering a schooner, the Rifleman, which was moored at the settlement of Waitangi. A total of 298 people—163 men, 64 women and 71 children—sailed out of the Chatham Islands, arriving at a secluded cove at Whareongaonga, south of Turanga (modern-day Gisborne), on 9 July.[tpl]cite book  | last = Binney | first = Judith | authorlink =Judith Binney | title = Redemption Songs | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | date = 1995 | location = Honolulu | pages =84-88|  isbn =0-8248-1975-6[/tpl] 
During his time of exile Te Kooti claimed he experienced a series of spiritual revelations that formed the basis of what became known as the Ringatū ("Raised hand") faith,[tpl]cite web   | title = Exile and Deliverance - Te Kooti's War | work =NZHistory.net | publisher =Ministry for Culture and Heritage | date =20 December 2012 | url =http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/te-kootis-war/exile-and-deliverance | accessdate = 28 March 2014[/tpl] which was strongly influenced by Old Testament prophecies of divine direction and deliverance from enemies. The apparently unerring fulfillment of Te Kooti's predictions won him the unwavering support of other whakarau (prisoners), and in a letter given to the crew of the Rifleman after arrival in New Zealand, he wrote that Jehovah had intervened to deliver his people from their captivity. The letter also asked that they be left in peace and not be pursued as they made their way to the interior of the North Island.
While in the Chathams Te Kooti also learned of the sale of disputed Poverty Bay land in which he held an interest. The transactions involved many of those, both Māori and European settler, whom he later killed in his Poverty Bay campaigns.[tpl]cite book  | last = Binney | first = Judith | authorlink =Judith Binney | title = Redemption Songs | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | date = 1995 | location = Honolulu | pages =106-115|  isbn =0-8248-1975-6[/tpl]

==First engagements==

thumb|right|200px|Major Reginald Biggs, militia commanding officer and Turanga resident magistrateOn the morning of 12 July 1868, three emissaries arrived at Whareongaonga, passing on a demand from Major Reginald Biggs, Turanga's resident magistrate and militia commanding officer, that they were to surrender their arms and await the government's decision on their future. Te Kooti rejected the demand, declaring he would fight only if he was pursued and attacked.[tpl]cite book  | last = Binney | first = Judith | authorlink =Judith Binney | title = Redemption Songs | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | date = 1995 | location = Honolulu | pages =90-95|  isbn =0-8248-1975-6[/tpl] As Biggs scrambled to assemble a force with which to confront Te Kooti at Whareongaonga—his militia volunteers, the Mounted Rifles under Captain Charles Westrup, as well as other men from Wairoa and Napier—the whakarau, whose fighting force then numbered about 60, set off on 14 July, bound for the King Country, where Te Kooti hoped to challenge the mana of Māori King Tāwhiao, who similarly claimed to be the mouthpiece of God. Te Kooti intended to eventually settle in the village of Tauranga, on the eastern shore of Lake Taupo. Biggs, arriving at Whareongaonga and discovering he had missed Te Kooti, marched his 70-strong force to Paparatu, about 40 km away, across a more direct route through open country, intending to cut off his quarry as they crossed the Arai Stream. Biggs left Westrup in command at Paparatu and returned to Turanga to organise a resupply. On the morning of 20 July Te Kooti lured Westrup's force into an ambush, killing two Europeans and forcing a retreat. He seized food, arms and ammunition and 80 horses.[tpl]cite book | last = Belich | first = James | authorlink =James Belich (historian) | title =The New Zealand Wars | publisher =Penguin | year = 1986| location =Auckland | pages =221-226 | isbn =0-14-027504-5[/tpl][tpl]cite book| last = Cowan| first = James| authorlink = James Cowan (New Zealand writer)| title = The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period, Vol. 2, 1864-72| publisher  = RNZ Government Printer | year   = 1922| location   = Wellington| chapter = 25, First engagements with Te Kooti| url  = http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow02NewZ-c25.html[/tpl]
Further victories were achieved at Te Koneke on 24 April and then at Ruakitori Gorge, near their new base at the ancient pā at Puketapu, on 8 August, when Te Kooti's force defeated a column led by the commandant of the Armed Constabulary, Colonel George Whitmore, whom Te Kooti now dubbed "Witi koaha", or "witless". The succession of victories attracted more recruits to Te Kooti's party, including Ngati Kohatu chief Korohina Te Rakiroa, who brought with him up to 20 men with government-issued rifles.[tpl]cite book  | last = Binney | first = Judith | authorlink =Judith Binney | title = Redemption Songs | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | date = 1995 | location = Honolulu | pages =97-98|  isbn =0-8248-1975-6[/tpl] A crucial bond was also struck between Te Kooti and a high-ranking chief of inland Wairoa, Te Waru Tamatea, a Pai Mārire convert whose son had been taken prisoner in October 1865 during the East Cape War and executed at Biggs' command. Te Waru and fellow chief Nama, survivors of the Waerenga-a-Hika siege, had earlier fought for autonomy for themselves and their people but were now bitterly opposed to the land confiscations that had followed the East Cape War; the failure of the Crown to return their land despite a confiscation settlement a year earlier deepened their resentment. Te Kooti's force was now even stronger, and he was also now committed to aiding Te Waru to achieve utu over his son's death.
In Taranaki, meanwhile, government forces were suffering humiliating defeats at the hands of bush warrior and Pai Mārire prophet Riwha Titokowaru. In the wake of their devastating loss at Te Ngutu o Te Manu in early September 1868, Whitmore was sent to Taranaki to assume command, and took the entire east coast Armed Constabulary force with him. The government, eager to free further resources for use against Titokowaru, seized the moment to offer Te Kooti a peace agreement. In mid-October Defence Minister Theodore Haultain directed that a message be sent to Te Kooti at Puketapu stating that if the prisoners surrendered themselves and their arms, no further proceedings would be taken against them and land would be found for them to live on. Historian James Belich commented that the offer was almost certainly genuine and, if accepted, "could easily have made Te Kooti's first campaign his last". Catholic missionary Father Euloge Reignier was chosen to act as the emissary and negotiator, but was prevented from reaching Te Kooti and instead passed the message on via Pai Mārire warriors. If Te Kooti did receive the offer, he rejected it, suspicious of the government's intentions and aware they planned to storm Puketapu.[tpl]cite book  | last = Binney | first = Judith | authorlink =Judith Binney | title = Redemption Songs | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | date = 1995 | location = Honolulu | pages =100-103|  isbn =0-8248-1975-6[/tpl]
Unable to move forward or backward without the threat of of attack, Te Kooti launched an intensive campaign for Māori support, seeking Tāwhiao's assent to enter the King Country and also asking Tuhoe chiefs permission to enter their land. While Tuhoe deferred their decision, Tāwhiao sent an outright rejection, warning they would be repelled if they encroached on his territory. Three months after arriving at Puketapu, and by now with a fighting force of about 250—many of them drawn from tribes who shared his outrage at spreading land confiscations—Te Kooti announced they would return to Turanga. He told his followers: "They did not listen. Now we must turn and strike them. Now Turanga shall be given us to dwell in."

==Poverty Bay massacre, Ngatapa siege==

On the night of 9 November 1868 Te Kooti led a war party towards Turanga, a district that was home to about 150 European settlers and 500 Māori, in preparation for what became known as the Poverty Bay Massacre or Matawhero Massacre.[tpl]cite book| last = Cowan| first = James| authorlink = James Cowan (New Zealand writer)| title = The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period, Vol. 2, 1864-72| publisher  = RNZ Government Printer | year   = 1922| location   = Wellington| chapter = 27, The Poverty Bay Massacre| url  = http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow02NewZ-c27.html[/tpl] He emerged about midnight from the Patutahi valley, about 15 km northwest of the European township, accompanied by a 100-man kokiri, or attack party, 60 of whom were mounted. The kokiri was split into two main contingents, with almost all their targets in the farming district of Matawhero, on Turanga's outskirts, where land formerly owned by Te Kooti had been sold and settled during his internment. The first attack force, led by Nama, struck first at the family of Captain James Wilson, killing Wilson, a servant and three of his four children and fatally wounding his wife. The second, and larger, kokiri led by Te Kooti surrounded Biggs' home where he, his wife, their baby and servants were fatally shot, clubbed and bayoneted. The attackers moved on to other homes, slaughtering the families of other settlers who had fought with the militia forces and setting fire to their houses. Many of the killings were followed by the singing of Psalm 63, which concluded: "They who seek my life will be destroyed ... they will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals."[tpl]cite web   | title = Matawhero - Te Kooti's War | work =NZHistory.net | publisher =Ministry for Culture and Heritage | date =20 December 2012 | url =http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/te-kootis-war/matawhero | accessdate = 10 April 2014[/tpl] A total of 29 Europeans and part-Māori were killed, as well as 22 Māori, specifically selected by Te Kooti for slaughter for what he perceived as double-dealing or disloyalty over his land during his exile.[tpl]cite book  | last = Binney | first = Judith | authorlink =Judith Binney | title = Redemption Songs | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | date = 1995 | location = Honolulu | pages =121-129|  isbn =0-8248-1975-6[/tpl]
By the following morning Te Kooti was in control of all land between the Waipaoa River and Makaraka. He remained in the district until 13 November, continuing to take Māori prisoners, before marching his followers and prisoners inland to Oweta pā, where he took more prisoners and executed four chiefs. When he left the pā on 19 November, satisfied he had "reclaimed" Turanga, he was leading 600 people, half of them prisoners, including women and children.
The whakerau arrived at Te Karetu, a small pā at the junction of the Wharekopae and Makaretu rivers, on 22 November.[tpl]cite book  | last = Binney | first = Judith | authorlink =Judith Binney | title = Redemption Songs | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | date = 1995 | location = Honolulu | pages =131-135|  isbn =0-8248-1975-6[/tpl] By then they were already being pursued by a force of 340 Ngāti Kahungunu raised from Napier and Mahia as well as a contingent from Ngai Tahupo at Muriwai in Poverty Bay. The pursuit force reached Te Karetu on 23 November, but despite having more than double the number of Te Kooti's men—only 150 of whom had rifles—they were kept at bay until the arrival on 2 December of 180 Ngāti Porou fighters led by Ropata Wahawaha. Whitmore, having put on hold his pursuit of Titokowaru on the west coast, arrived in Poverty Bay with 220 Armed Constabulary divisions two days later and joined the campaign.[tpl]cite book | last = Belich | first = James | authorlink =James Belich (historian) | title =The New Zealand Wars | publisher =Penguin | year = 1986| location =Auckland | pages =258-267 | isbn =0-14-027504-5[/tpl]  About 40 of Te Kooti's rearguard were killed in the subsequent assault, while Nama was captured, tied up and then dragged repeatedly through fire until he died. It was a hollow victory for Ropata, however, with the pā found to be almost empty. Te Kooti had moved most of his fighters, along with women, children, food and livestock, to the ancient hilltop fortress of Ngatapa, about 5 km further inland.
thumb|right|400px|Ngatapa pā, on the summit of the hill, scene of the four-day siege in January 1869Ngatapa was a formidable pā, standing 700 metres above sea level and surrounded by cliffs on three sides and dense bush on the side facing any opposing force. Te Kooti had hastily begun strengthening its defences with trenches, earth banks and palisades, as well as covered walkways connecting the trenches. The interior of the pā was a maze of rifle pits. Ropata moved his force towards Ngatapa on 3 December, but a day later suffered a blow as Ngāti Kahungunu members of his contingent quit the battle and withdrew after a dispute with Ngāti Porou fighters, who wished to kill some of the prisoners. The next day, with as few as 150 men, he gained some ground in a rush on the pā, but was forced to abandon the assault a day later and return to Turanga, short of gunpowder and men. Yet Te Kooti's losses were also mounting: since 23 November he had lost at least 57 men and 60 of his rifles had been captured and many of his Turanga prisoners had also escaped.[tpl]cite book  | last = Binney | first = Judith | authorlink =Judith Binney | title = Redemption Songs | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | date = 1995 | location = Honolulu | pages =135-147|  isbn =0-8248-1975-6[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Belich | first = James | authorlink =James Belich (historian) | title =The New Zealand Wars | publisher =Penguin | year = 1986| location =Auckland | pages =232-233 | isbn =0-14-027504-5[/tpl] 
Desperate for arms and ammunition, Te Kooti led a second lightning raid on Turanga with about 50 men on 12 December, killing four locals but failing to secure the supplies they needed. The raid galvanised Whitmore to renew his campaign against Te Kooti, which he had decided just days earlier to abandon after false reports that Te Kooti had quit Ngatapa and retired inland. His troops, who were already being prepared for a return to Wanganui, were turned around and planning began for a second, better equipped assault on Ngatapa. The 600-man force—250 Europeans in the Armed Constabulary, 60 Arawa led by European officers and over 300 Ngāti Porou led by Ropata and Hotene Porourangi—massed at Ngatapa on 31 December and launched the attack the following day, quickly besieging the 300 occupants of the pā and cutting off their water supply from a hidden spring. Whitmore placed his men on all sides of Ngatapa except one, a high rocky precipice on the north side which was considered far too steep for use as an escape route. Heavy rain fell as the siege continued and when it began to clear on the fourth day, Whitmore commenced a mortar attack, briefly pounding the pā before halting its use when shrapnel ricocheted off the hill and also went right over it, landing among Hotene's men on the far side. Te Kooti abandoned his outer defences on 5 January after Arawa and Ngāti Porou fighters climbed the rock face and kept up heavy fire, while others in Whitmore's force began an offensive sap towards the remaining rampart.
Alerted by a woman's cry early on 6 January that there were no men left in the pā, the attackers entered to find just 20 women and children, most of them prisoners, inside. During the previous night at least 190 occupants of Ngatapa had descended from the unguarded steep rock outcrop, lowering themselves more than 20 metres down the almost perpendicular face on vines woven to form a rope or ladder. Ngāti Porou set off in immediate pursuit and flushed out 130 male prisoners from the bush and gorges below. The prisoners were marched up the hill to the pā's outer parapet, stripped naked, then shot dead. Some were then beheaded. Just 80 prisoners, including 50 women and 16 children—most of them emaciated and skeletal—were spared execution, with most taken by Ngāti Porou as their own prisoners. About 14 male prisoners were kept to be put on trial.
While kupapa losses were between 40 and 50 killed and wounded, the defeat for Te Kooti was far more critical, with 136 men, most of his fighting support, killed and 60 of his male prisoners escaping.

==First retreat to the Urewera Mountains==

Te Kooti and his remaining followers retreated into the Urewera Mountains, the territory of the Tuhoe, where he had a mixed reception. While some of the Tuhoe welcomed him, others anticipated correctly the trouble he would bring to the region and its people. 
On 9 March 1869 he launched a raid into the Whakatane region, the northern side of East Cape, hoping to gain supplies and recruits. Although initially successful he was forced to retreat again by the end of March, when the militia and Maori kupapa forces under Captain Gilbert Mair were mobilized.
Then early in April Te Kooti struck southwards. Ngati Kahungunu were searching for his base beyond Lake Waikaremoana, leaving their Pā at Mohaka vulnerable. Te Kooti attacked on 10 April and overwhelmed the defenders. Some 64 people were then slaughtered, women and children, Māori and Pākehā, and great deal of loot was seized. Then, on the retreat, they successfully ambushed the returning Ngati Kahungunu warriors.
Meanwhile Colonel Whitmore and his troops had returned from Taranaki. He quickly realized that to deal with Te Kooti he needed to occupy the Urewera Mountains, a truly formidable task. Until then few Pākehā had even penetrated the ranges of steep valleys and thick bush-clad hills frequently hidden by mist. Furthermore the local Māori, the Tuhoe, were already hostile to the government and fiercely protective of their land.
The hunt for Te Kooti  in the Ureweras began in early May. Three  columns of government soldiers were deployed; coming from the north,under Lt Colonel St John and William Mair, from the west, under Major Roberts,Gilbert Mair and George Preece and the south-west under Colonel Herrick. The latter column got bogged down around Lake Waikaremoana and made no further progress. However the other two columns were more successful and reached their objective, Ruatahuna, on 8 May. The plan was to deny Te Kooti, the Hau hau escapees and their Tuhoe supporters  supplies and support.  The government troops systematically destroying enemy crops and houses and removing all women and children to the coast near Matata. Ron Crosby says with these steps the Tuhoe support for the Hau hau " started to evaporate" even though there had been few Tuhoe killed or wounded. Gilbert Mair. p 77-78. R Crosby. Reed. 2004.
Many of Te Kooti's remaining supporters now pressured him to seek to eject Europeans from the country. This aim coincided with his own dream that he could be the Maori leader,with help from the Kingitanga in "expelling the Europeans". Gilbert Mair. p 78.
Meanwhile Te Kooti was camped on the north shore of Lake Waikaremoana waiting for the south-western column. When it became apparent that it was going nowhere, the Hau hau forces began moving towards Ruatahuna, hoping to persuade the other columns to advance and attack them. However the Government forces were in trouble. Their Māori allies had refused to advance beyond Ruatahuna. Food supplies were running out and dysentery was spreading through the troops. They also knew that Te Kooti would have chosen a very strong position to wait for them.

==Te Kooti and King Tāwhiao==

All the Government forces had withdrawn from the Ureweras by 18 May. Despite this the campaign was partially successful, the Tuhoe having had enough of their violent guest. In early June Te Kooti and about 150 of his supporters left the area moving towards Lake Taupo in the center of the North Island. 
At Opepe, just short of Taupo, they ran into a small party of Militia, who mistook them for their Māori allies: a costly mistake as nine of them were killed with no loss to Te Kooti. The Hau hau then continued on to Taupo and as far as Te Kuiti, where King Tāwhiao was based. 
In July-August 1869 Te Kooti sought Maniapoto's help in restarting the rebellion against the government. He was not successful.Stories Without End. Binney. p 133.For various reasons there was very little military activity between June and September 1869. The Government was still very keen to capture Te Kooti, but not at the cost of renewing the war with the King Movement  and this was where Te Kooti was heading. Over the next few weeks Te Kooti tried very hard to persuade the King Movement to become involved in his war, but King Tāwhiao refused to see him. They did not meet at this time. Some of the Kingite leaders were for involvement, either active or passive. Others were strongly against it, feeling that the tribes had already suffered enough. Te Kooti still had a small following  with a core group of about 40 men and his record for violence was appalling having already been involved in the murder of some one hundred and forty people. Rewi Maniapoto, the warlike leader of Orakau, was in favour of supporting Te Kooti, but even he stopped short of becoming involved in any actual hostilities,realising the days of hoping to beat the New Zealand army in open rebellion were over.

==Te Porere==

Disgruntled by this lukewarm response, Te Kooti and his people, maybe by now as many as 800, returned to Tokaanu on the southern shore of Lake Taupo on 18 August, and then a few kilometres further south to Te Porere five km south west of Lake Rotoaira, where he began to build himself an earthern gunfighter style Pā.
Meanwhile the enemy forces were gathering - both Pākehā and Māori armies were moving towards Lake Taupo from all directions. 
McDonnell had been appointed by the government to lead the forces against Te Kooti. With a force of Armed Constabulary from Wanganui, he rode north to the Rangipo Desert where he met up with a contingent of Tuwharetoa warriors who were opposed to Te Kooti. Here he learnt that two mounted columns were coming up from Hawkes Bay, a Māori one and Militia column, and third force was coming by a more roundabout route. Meanwhile yet another force, of Armed Constabulary and Arawa, was already on the eastern shore of Lake Taupo. Finally two more groups were being organized in Wanganui to arrive later, including Kepa te Rangihiwinui, Major Kepa.
The Kahungunu led by Henare Tomoana were the first to meet the Ringatu forces. They were moving south down the lake shore when a sudden storm forced them to make camp. Here the Ringatu attacked them: they made off with their horses but that was all they achieved. After a desultory siege lasting two days Te Kooti's forces withdrew. They retreated away from the lake and all the way back to Te Porere. This allowed the government forces to advance right down the lake and establish a base at Tokaanu.
On 25 September there was another skirmish at Pouto where a forward base had been established, just east of Te Kooti's base. The Ringatu attacked and the Arawa attacked right back at them and drove them from the field. Since the Ringatu had the advantage of rifle pits and numbers while Te Arawa were attacking up hill it was not an impressive performance by Te Kooti's men. Possibly because of this a decision was made that may have changed the history of New Zealand.
Rewi Maniapoto had accompanied Te Kooti as an observer on behalf of the King Movement. Of all King Tawhio's advisers he had been the one most inclined to support the Ringatu. He had now seen them in action twice and he was not impressed; he turned his back on them and returned to the King Country. This finally closed the door on any possibility of an alliance between the King Movement and the Ringatu. It has since been suggested that this was the last moment when there was any possibility of the King Country remaining as an independent state. 
At Te Porere, Te Kooti had constructed a defensive position, one built in the style of a European redoubt than a Māori Pā. He moved his people into it in late September.
The Colonial forces were gathering in strength and could probably have attacked at any time except that one important component was missing: Kepa (Major Kemp) and the Wanganui had not arrived, and Colonel McDonnell was not about to start a battle without his friend Kepa.
They waited, possibly in some of the worst conditions an army ever did have to wait for battle. For several days it snowed heavily. Furthermore the campaign was being fought on the slopes of an active volcanic field and one of them, Ngauruhoe, was in full eruption, spewing out vast quantities of volcanic ash to mix with the snow. Then the snow turned to freezing rain.
Eventually Kepa turned up and the day of the attack was appointed, 4 October 1869. The battle plan was very basic - to advance with 540 Redemption Songs. J. Binney. Auckland University Press. 1996. p 187. men en masse and overwhelm the defences, the preliminary rifle pits, a small redoubt by the stream, more rifle pits and then the main earth redoubt 400 metres further south up the hill. One contingent was told that if they could they should work their way around to back to cut off any possibility of escape. Gilbert Mair, an experienced soldier and Maori speaker, visited the site in later life with Raupena Waurehu one of the surviving defenders. Waurehu claimed that at the time of the attack Te Kooti and most of the man were at the lower pa, on the valley floor, possibly sheltering from the poor weather. When forced to retreat by the overwhelming fire they ran back uphill, skirting the upper pa 400m to the south and entering the bush. They then turned and supported the pa occupants until it fell. Waurehu took Mair along a track 400m into the bush and showed him where Te Kooti's main camp had been.Gilbert Mair. p 33-34. R.Crosby. Reed. 2004.
At times attacking colonial troops had been decimated by well-placed Māori forces fighting on the defensive. Obviously the commander, McDonnell, knew more about the situation than we can now understand because his plan worked. The attacker stuffed the musket loopholes with pumice so the defenders had to expose themselves to fire. Redemption Songs. p187. Within a few minutes they had taken all the external defences and were up against the main walls of the redoubt, hacking at it with whatever came to hand. Then two of the commanders found the back door to the fort and began to attack it, but both were promptly shot dead. This appeared to drive the Wanganui warriors into a berserk rage. They simply swarmed over the wall and descended and began killing the Ringatu. 
The battle was soon over. Te Kooti,  who had been shielded and disguised by a group of women, Redemption Songs. p 188. and a few of his men escaped but many were killed and many more made prisoner. The allied militia casualties were amazingly light, four killed and four wounded. Considering they had attacked a walled fort occupied by some 250 men and women, all firing at them from a very close range.
The low casualty rate was due to the method of construction. Instead of digging the earthworks from the outside to make the ditch deeper, Te Kooti built it from the inside, which meant that his men had to expose themselves to be able to fire on the approaching troops. Also, the pa was built on a hill that had sloping ground angled in such a way that his enemies could crawl up the hill and not be able to be hit by rifle fire."In making the loopholes ... we made them straight (horizontal), and could not depress the muzzles of our guns to fire into the ditch."
Te Porere was the last time that a rebel force opposed a government force from a Pa or earth fortress. Comparing the sketches at the time of the battle to the vegetation now shows that it has  changed little partly due to the extreme climate of the area in winter.

==Flight==

Te Kooti and his men fled west and north and invaded the King Country, in December, where the Armed Constabulary could not follow them - this would have been seen as a declaration of war.Te Kooti's intension was to depose the King and put in place his own set of laws, however, Kepa and the Wanganui Māori could do so and were just acceptable to the King and his advisors. They continued the pursuit, officially sanctioned by the Government to do so. Gradually Te Kooti was forced north, reaching Taumarunui on 7 January 1870. Myth says at some stage he was joined by Kereopa Te Rau,(although he died in 1868) the infamous eyeball-eater from the Volkner Incident, and between them they mustered about 110 supporters. When Te Kooti told the kingites he had come to take their mana, Tawhaio told him to sheath his sword and Te Ra karepe poked out his tongue and dared him to seize his mana. Tawhaio had greeted him with the insult that "you are the monkey of Tai Rawhiti, come to bow before your king." Stories Without End. J. Binney. P 133-134.
North was the only direction open to them: they crossed the Waikato River and reached the vicinity of Matamata by 15 January. Te Kooti arranged to meet Josiah Firth,who was leasing land from Ngati Haua. Firth Told Te Kooti he had no power and had come only to listen. Te Kooti restated his previous position that he would not surrender but just wanted to be left alone. The government sent a telegram saying that if he surrendered they would give him safe passage to Auckland. Shortly after this meeting Te Kooti received a large quantity of gunpowder (7 kegs) and a 2 feet high bag of bullets from a Coromandel chief. Te Kooti had "predicted" the exact day and time the ammunition resupply would take place suggesting it had been prearranged. He also may have got ammunition from other sources such as Fenians or Irish Independence supporters who were gold mining in Coromandel . A Fenian named Michael O'Conner had previously been in contact with both Te Kooti and Tawhaio and had  supplied primer caps to Te Kooti before the battle at Te Porere. Gilbert Mair  discovered that Te Kooti had again "predicted" he would be given "50 packets of caps,7 tins of powder,7 packages of ammunition and one revolver at Peria(near modern Matamata) at 2pm."  From here the refugees moved south and east, back towards the Rotorua area. Te Kooti also had a network of exiled Ngati Porou Hau Hau supporters at Kennedy Bay on the Coromandel Peninsula. He had a stream of messengers going to a from that area and had received ammunition from them at least twice previously and kept in constant touch.Redemption Songs. p 201-202. His enemies were close behind and occasionally he turned and snapped at his pursuers, causing a few deaths, but always he kept retreating.
On 7 February he approached Ohinemutu, now a part of Rotorua but then a major Arawa settlement. Based at Ohinemutu there was normally a force of about 200 Arawa fighters commanded by Gilbert Mair. But they had been posted many kilometres away to the west to assist in the search for the men now approaching their home. In fact they had been very unhappy about this and once it became obvious that Te Kooti had slipped through the net they had insisted on returning to their home base. They traveled in haste through most of the night of 6 February. As dawn rose over the Rotorua area they encountered the trail of Te Kooti and his band. Their forced march then became a desperate race. 
Meanwhile Te Kooti was approaching Ohinemutu. It is unclear what his intentions were - despite the white flag they were assumed to be hostile as he had previously used the same flag to  approach settlers, soldiers and loyal Maori before suddenly attacking them. Thirdly, the Arawa were the main government Maori troops being used to hunt down Te Kooti and it had been Te Kooti's common pattern to extract utu from those who opposed his cult. Fourthly, Te Kooti claimed he had one of his followers had  written a letter asking for permission to pass through Arawa land but as he had been in Arawa land for some time already without permission, this was seen by Mair as a ruse. Mair also had several original letters written by Te Kooti with him, so he knew the letter to the Arawa was from Te Kooti himself.  Mair and about 30 of his warriors arrived at a run at the last and most dramatic moment. They discarded the white flag being held by an Arawa elder and began shooting at the approaching Ringatu. This was the beginning of a running battle that lasted 24 hours and ended only when Te Kooti fled the area, retreating once again into the Urewera Mountains. He had lost many, including two of his senior lieutenants and quantities of supplies, food, bedding and ammunition.
Te Kooti was now quite definitely a refugee. In reality he had been a hunted man since Te Porere four months previously, but following Ohinemutu his movements were dictated far more by his pursuing enemies than by his own wishes or plans.

==Pursuit==

thumb|right|200px|Major Ropata WahawahaA few days later Colonel McDonnell was relieved of his command. Headquarters were very upset over the paucity of his communications, and the Minister of Defence had seldom known where he was or what was happening. Instead the job of catching Te Kooti was contracted to the various Māori war chiefs who would be paid by results, according to the number of Ringatu heads or prisoners they brought in. Both Kepa, now Major Kepa Rangihiwinui, with his Wanganui Warriors, and Ropata and Ngati Porou accepted the task. Later Arawa also joined the chase but only after they had negotiated better terms, i.e. more cash for the job. 
The task of catching Te Kooti was entrusted to the Māori allies of the Government. Only one Pākehā was allowed to continue the hunt: Ropata had requested Colonel Tom Porter as his second in command. Apparently they had already soldiered together for quite a long time.
Ropata and his men left Gisborne on 28 February 1870. On the same day two Ringatu war parties struck a Māori settlement, Opape, on the other coast of East Cape, near present-day Opotiki. In addition to capturing arms and ammunition they took 170 prisoners, mostly female. They were possibly seen as hostages, because when Kepa descended on the village looking for the raiders the men were uncooperative and the village suffered all over again. 
Early in March Kepa began moving south into the Ureweras. The people of the area, the unfortunate Tuhoe, were given a simple choice - cooperate or suffer a great misfortune. Since Kepa was backed up by about 400 armed warriors the nature of the misfortune was fairly obvious and, grudgingly, information about Te Kooti and his whereabouts began to emerge. Later Ropata reinforced the grudging treaty even more forcefully.
The two war parties rampaged through the Urewera Mountains for about a month. Meanwhile Te Kooti was resting in the Maraetahi region. Life in the Ringatu camp was not happy: food was short and discipline fierce, the slightest infractions being punished by instant death. The captives and the rank-and-file Ringatu feared Te Kooti and his lieutenants almost as much as the approaching war parties. 
For they were approaching, Kepa from the south and Ropata from the north in a well-coordinated pincer movement. They reached Maraetahi on 25 March 1870. Ropata arriving first, immediately made a successful surprise attack. As the Ringatu fled upstream they ran right into Kepa and his men. Te Kooti escaped with four women and about 20 men, but the rest of the band were killed or captured, about 300 people altogether. The majority of these were the unfortunate captives Te Kooti had taken at Opape in February but it also included the bulk of the Ringatu. Nineteen of the most senior of these were executed immediately, the rest were taken back for Pākehā trial and imprisonment.
This was the end of Kepa's war. He and his men had pursued Te Kooti right across the North Island for seven months. They were operating far from their own territory, fighting on behalf of the Government against an enemy who had never threatened his own people. They felt they had done enough. The New Zealand Wars were over and it was time to go home.
But the pursuit of Te Kooti was not over, for it was to continue for another two years. Ropata, Porter and Ngati Porou were joined by another force, Gilbert Mair and George Preece leading a taua (war party) of Arawa. Together they ranged through the Urewera Mountains, subjugating the Tuhoe and forcing them to hand over any fugitives they were sheltering. One welcome catch who fell into Ropata's hands was Kereopa, Volkner's murderer - he was worth 1000 pounds to his captors.
Te Kooti had many narrow escapes, but he managed to stay ahead of his pursuers until mid August 1871 when the Arawa forces unexpectedly came upon his camp, which was taken after a brief skirmish. When in camp Te Kooti usually slept some distance away from his followers. This habit had saved him at Maraetahi and it did so again. He was almost killed but another man intercepted the bullet. He fired one shot and fled, naked, into the bush, and the hunt continued.
Early in February 1872, Preece received good information about the whereabouts of Te Kooti, at the junction of the Waiau and Mangaone Streams. On 13 February they found a camp that had been occupied only a few days previously. The next day they found a camp with a fire still burning and then spotted a group of people climbing the cliff on the opposite side of the flooded stream. One of them was Te Kooti. Shots were exchanged and the chase was on. Later the same day Nikora te Tuhi spotted Te Kooti in the distance and fired two shots at him. They both missed but they were the last shots fired in the New Zealand Wars.
Te Kooti continued to elude the pursuers. On 15 May 1872 he crossed the Waikato River and once again entered the territory of the Māori King, Tawhiao. This time he approached the King as supplicant and was granted asylum.

==Pardon and later years==

In 1883, the Government formally pardoned Te Kooti"How Te Kooti Gained a Pardon", Historic Poverty Bay and the East Coast, Joseph Angus Mackay as part of a deal with Tawhiao to put the Main Trunk Line through the King Country."The Main Trunk Railway", The New Zealand Railways MagazineAlmost immediately Te Kooti showed his gratitude by rescuing a surveyor, Wilson Hursthouse, who had been taken prisoner, stripped and chained up by Te Whiti o Rongomai's men from Parihaka.Redemption Songs. p 312.
However Te Kooti remained unrepentant and belligerent. He went about armed with a revolver  and  threatened to take his gang back to Poverty Bay. He travelled extensively holding meetings to spread the ringatu message. He was often accompanied by large groups of supporters to places such as Whakatane and Opotiki. An observer noted 1,000 people gathered to hear him and the resident magistrate commented that for once Te Kooti was sober. Te Kooti was still far from popular with all Maori and was accused by chiefs of practicing maketu (black magic) to kill senior chiefs who he had previously opposed him. Chiefs were concerned that groups such as Ngati Awa and Ngati Pukeko would hand over the land to Te Kooti without any authority. The chiefs wrote to parliament to complain that Te Kooti was claiming mana over their land and instructing that the land should not be bought before the Native land Court. The chiefs were also concerned that the supplies of the communities were being drained by massive hui leading to the people being ill prepared to face winter. Chiefs complained that Te Kooti was forcing his adherents to raise money for him by selling family crops and animals. School teachers and native officers sent report to the government that this was resulting in children being malnourished. Redemption Songs. p 384 Bush, the local magistrate, became concerned about "Te Kooti-ism" -Te Kooti was telling his followers that confiscated land would be returned by driving the Pakeha from the country.Redemption Songs. J Binney. Auckland University Press. 1996. pp 282-285.  This alarmed the government and the people of Poverty Bay. In February a telegram signed by 20 chiefs went to parliament saying they would rise up if Te Kooti did not turn back. Redemption Songs. p 391-393. The government was keen to keep the peace. The Minister of Defence was concerned that Te Kooti had been directly threatened by his old adversaries Ropata and the Ngati Porou. The Prime Minister arranged a meeting in Auckland between himself, Te Kooti and the Native Minister where he was offered government land if he stayed away from Gisborne. Although cordial, Te Kooti told the officials that he determined to return. As a token of his peaceful intentions he surrendered a small revolver that he normally carried. Redemption Songs. p 390.The government shipped troops and artillery to Gisborne to form a military force of 377 under Major Porter  in early 1889. Rumours of threats continued until the force went to Waioeka Pa  and found Te Kooti drunk with 4 of his wives and some 400 supporters, who were arrested. Redemption Songs. p 410. He was bound over to keep the peace but as he could not afford the fine or bond he was taken to Mt Eden jail in Auckland where he was persuaded by the Ladies Temperance Movement to take the pledge against drinking alcohol and imprisoned for a short time before being released. Te Kooti wrote a letter of apology to the government explaining that his recent conduct had been caused by drink. Redemption Songs. p 413.Eventually in 1891 the government gave him an area of land at Wainui, where a marae for the Ringatu church was later established. Te Kooti died in 1893 in a cart accident while on his way to the land the government had given him.

==Aftermath==

In May 2013, at the tangi of MP Parekura Horomia, the Tuhoe iwi, who had initially supported Te Kooti and the rebel Hau Hau movement in their 19th century war against the government, gave a gift to Ngati Porou to end nearly 150 years of bitterness between the tribes. Ngati Porou had provided many of the soldiers who tracked down the notorious murderer, hijacker and guerilla leader in the late 1860s and had numerous conflicts with Tuhoe Hau Hau. During one conflict 120 Tuhoe Hau hau were captured and killed. Tuhoe leader Tu Waaka said he did not want successive generations to be encumbered by the events of the past. Waikato Times May 3 2013
