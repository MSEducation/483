Choose Love is the 13th studio album by Ringo Starr, released in 2005.

==Background and recording==

Recorded throughout 2004 into 2005, using the same team that created Vertical Man (1998) and Ringo Rama (2003), Starr produced the set with longtime musical partner Mark Hudson and performed it with their studio team. As ever, a Starr album would be lacking if it did not include some celebrity guests and Choose Love does not deviate from the formula; it features Billy Preston and Chrissie Hynde as its most notable guests.

==Release==

Choose Love was released on 7 June 2005 in the US,[tpl]#tag:ref|US Koch KOC-CD-550|group="nb"[/tpl] and on 25 July in the UK.[tpl]cite book|last=Jackson |first=Andrew Grant |title=Still the Greatest: The Essential Songs of the Beatles' Solo Careers |year=2012 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location=Lanham, Md. |isbn=9780810882232 |page=292[/tpl] There was an edition of the album that was a dual disc (CD on side, DVD on the other), with the DVD component featuring bonus features on the making of the album.[tpl]#tag:ref|US Koch KOC-CD-9919|group="nb"[/tpl]

==Reception==

Choose Love failed to chart in the UK and even in the US, where both Vertical Man and Ringo Rama had seen a measure of commercial success. The album received strong reviews upon its release and preceded another promotional tour with Starr and his studio band, called "The Roundheads".
