Helvetica is a widely used sans-serif typeface developed in 1957 by Swiss typeface designer Max Miedinger with Eduard Hoffmann.[tpl]cite video |date= 2007-09-12 |title= Helvetica |medium= Documentary [/tpl]

==History==

Helvetica was developed in 1957 by Max Miedinger with Eduard Hoffmann at the Haas'sche Schriftgiesserei (Haas Type Foundry) of Münchenstein, Switzerland. Haas set out to design a new sans-serif typeface that could compete with the successful Akzidenz-Grotesk in the Swiss market. Originally called Neue Haas Grotesk, its design was based on Schelter-Grotesk and Haas' Normal Grotesk. The aim of the new design was to create a neutral typeface that had great clarity, no intrinsic meaning in its form, and could be used on a wide variety of signage.
When Linotype adopted Neue Haas Grotesk (which was never planned to be a full range of mechanical and hot-metal typefaces) its design was reworked. After the success of Univers, Arthur Ritzel of Stempel redesigned Neue Haas Grotesk into a larger family.[tpl]cite web|url=http://new.myfonts.com/person/ritzel/arthur/overview.html |title=myfonts: Arthur Ritzel |publisher=New.myfonts.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2009-06-08[/tpl]
In 1960, the typeface's name was changed by Haas' German parent company Stempel to Helvetica (meaning Swiss in Latin) in order to make it more marketable internationally.

Initial release included 6 fonts in OpenType Com format for each family in 3 weights (light, regular, bold) and 1 width, with complementary italics. OpenType features include fractions, glyph composition/decomposition.

===Helvetica Light===

Helvetica Light was designed by Stempel's artistic director Erich Schultz-Anker, in conjunction with Arthur Ritzel.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thamesandhudson.com/books/Creative_Type/9780500512296.mxs/20/11/ | first1 =Cees W | last1 = de Jong | first2 = Alston W | last2 = Purvis | first3 = Friedrich | last3 = Friedl | title = Creative Type: A Sourcebook of Classic and Contemporary Letterforms | publisher = Thames & Hudson | ISBN = 978-0-50051229-6 | accessdate = 2009-06-08[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot =H3llBot[/tpl]

===Helvetica Compressed===

Designed by Matthew Carter, this is a narrow variant that is tighter than Helvetica Condensed. It shares some design elements with Helvetica Inserat, but uses a curved tail in Q, downward pointing branch in r, and tilde bottom £.
The family consists of Helvetica Compressed, Helvetica Extra Compressed, Helvetica Ultra Compressed fonts.

===Helvetica Textbook===

Helvetica Textbook is an alternate design of the typeface. Some characters such as 1, 4, 6, 9, I, J, a, f, j, q, t, u, μ, and ¶ are drawn differently from the original version.

===Helvetica Inserat (1957)===

Helvetica Inserat is a version designed in 1957 primarily for use in the advertising industry.  With metric similar to Helvetica Black Condensed, the design gives the glyphs a more squared appearance, similar to Impact and Haettenschweiler.  Strike with strokes in $, ¢ are replaced by non-strikethrough version. 4 is opened at top.

===Helvetica Rounded (1978)===

Helvetica Rounded is a version containing rounded stroke terminators. Only bold, bold oblique, black, black oblique, bold condensed, bold outline fonts were made, with outline font not issued in digital form by Linotype.

===Helvetica Narrow===

Helvetica Narrow is a version where its width is between Helvetica Compressed and Helvetica Condensed. However, the width is scaled in a way that is optically consistent with the widest width fonts.
The font was developed when printer ROM space was very scarce, so it was created by mathematically squashing Helvetica to 82% of the original width, resulting in distorted letterforms and thin vertical strokes next to thicker horizontals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype/T1_to_OTF_FAQ.htm |title=Type 1 ("PostScript") to OpenType font conversion |publisher=Adobe |accessdate= 2009-06-08[/tpl]
OpenType version was not produced by Adobe under the distortion reasoning, and recommended Helvetica Condensed instead. However, in Linotype's OpenType version of Helvetica Narrow, the distortions found in the Adobe fonts are non-existent.

===Neue Helvetica (1983)===

Neue Helvetica is a reworking of the typeface with a more structurally unified set of heights and widths. Other changes include improved legibility, heavier punctuation marks, and increased spacing in the numbers.
Neue Helvetica uses a numerical design classification scheme, like Univers. The font family is made up of 51 fonts including 9 weights in 3 widths (8, 9, 8 in normal, condensed, extended widths respectively), and an outline font based on Helvetica 75 Bold Outline (no Textbook or rounded fonts are available). Linotype distributes Neue Helvetica on CD.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linotype.com/en/2876/linotypepresentsentirenewhelveticafamilyonasinglecd.html |title=Linotype Library presents entire New Helvetica family on a single CD |publisher=Linotype.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-08[/tpl] Neue Helvetica also comes in variants for Central European and Cyrillic text.
It was developed at D. Stempel AG, a Linotype subsidiary. The studio manager was Wolfgang Schimpf, and his assistant was Reinhard Haus; the manager of the project was René Kerfante. Erik Spiekermann was the design consultant and designed the literature for the launch in 1983."Who Made Helvetica Neue?", typophile.com

===Neue Helvetica W1G (2009)===

It is a version with Latin Extended, Greek, Cyrillic scripts support. Only OpenType CFF font format was released.
The family includes the fonts from the older Neue Helvetica counterparts, except Neue Helvetica 75 Bold Outline. Additional OpenType features include subscript/superscript.

===Helvetica World===

Also called Helvetica Linotype,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linotype.com/en/1824-18303/thelanguagewhizhelveticalinotype.html |title=The Language Whiz — Helvetica Linotype |publisher=Linotype.com |date=2007-10-16 |accessdate=2009-06-08[/tpl] Helvetica World supports Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, and Vietnamese scripts.
The family consists of four fonts in 2 weights and 1 width, with complementary italics.
The Arabic glyphs were based on a redesigned Yakout font family from Linotype. Latin kerning and spacing were redesigned to have consistent spacing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://typographica.org/000652.php |title=Linotype Releases 1100+ OpenType Fonts: Release a Significant Step Towards Format's Acceptance |publisher=Typographica.org |date=August 6, 2003 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080704110031/http://typographica.org/000652.php |archivedate = 2008-07-04 |accessdate=2009-06-08 |quote=In the Comments Section:  The biggest differences are the new Greek, Cyrillic and Hebrew designs, and the presence of Arabic support based on the radically redesigned Yakout Linotype (not a perfect match for the Helvetica, but the most appropriate in the Linotype Library; this is 'core font' Arabic support: not for fine typography). There is also a large maths and symbol set in each font (not complete maths typesetting support, but more than you'll get in most fonts).  The only big change in the Latin is that the whole thing has been respaced. The old Helvetica Std Type 1 and TT fonts inherited, via phototype, the unit metrics of the original hot metal type. This led to all sorts of oddities in the sidebearings, which were cleaned up during development of Helvetica Linotype. It is still quite a tightly spaced typeface by today's standards, but the spacing is now consistent. It was also re-kerned.  Helvetica Linotype has also been extensively hinted for screen. -- John Hudson [/tpl]

In 2007, director Gary Hustwit released a documentary film, Helvetica (Plexifilm, DVD), to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the typeface. In the film, graphic designer Wim Crouwel said, "Helvetica was a real step from the 19th century typeface... We were impressed by that because it was more neutral, and neutralism was a word that we loved. It should be neutral. It shouldn't have a meaning in itself.  The meaning is in the content of the text and not in the typeface." The documentary also presented other designers who associated Helvetica with authority and corporate dominance, and whose rebellion from Helvetica's ubiquity created new styles.
