Li Lianjie ([tpl]IPAc-cmn|l|i|3|-|l|ian|2|j|ie|2[/tpl]; born 26 April 1963),[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.biography.com/people/jet-li-241077 | title=Biography.com | accessdate=29 January 2014[/tpl] better known by his English stage name Jet Li, is a Chinese film actor, film producer, martial artist, and wushu champion who was born in Beijing.  He is a naturalized Singaporean citizen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/audio/2009-07/29/content_11789876.htm |title=Xinhuanet.com |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl]
After three years of intensive training with Wu Bin, Li won his first national championship for the Beijing Wushu Team. After retiring from Wushu at age 19, he went on to win great acclaim in China as an actor making his debut with the film Shaolin Temple (1982). He went on to star in many critically acclaimed martial arts epic films, most notably the Once Upon A Time In China series, in which he portrayed folk hero Wong Fei-hung.
Li's first role in a Hollywood film was as a villain in Lethal Weapon 4 (1998), and his first leading role in a Hollywood film was as Han Sing in Romeo Must Die (2000). He has gone on to star in many Hollywood action films, including Kiss of the Dragon and Unleashed. He co-starred in The Forbidden Kingdom (2008) with Jackie Chan, The Expendables (2010) with Sylvester Stallone, and as the title character villain in The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor (2008) opposite Brendan Fraser.

==Early life and martial arts career==

Li was born in Beijing, China, as the youngest of two boys and two girls. His father died when he was two years old, leaving the family struggling.[tpl]cite web|last=Li|first=Jet|title=Let's start at the beginning|url=http://jetli.com/jet/index.php?l=en&s=life&ss=essays&p=1|work=Essays|publisher=JetLi.com|accessdate=July 30, 2010[/tpl]
Li was eight when his talent for wushu was noticed at a summer course at school, and he began his practice there.[tpl]cite web|last=Li|first=Jet|title=Life Essay: Part 2|url=http://jetli.com/jet/index.php?l=en&s=life&ss=essays&p=2|work=Essays|publisher=JetLi.com|accessdate=July 30, 2010[/tpl] Li participated in the sport of wushu in the non-sparring event. He began his wushu on the Beijing Wushu Team, an athletic group organized to perform martial arts forms during the All China Games. He was coached by renowned wushu coaches Li Junfeng and Wu Bin,[tpl]cite web|title=Jet Li Biography|url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/jet-li/biography/51|publisher=TalkTalk|accessdate=July 30, 2010[/tpl] who made extra efforts to help the talented boy develop. Wu Bin even bought food for Li's family because they could not afford to buy meat, which was essential for the good physical condition of an athlete. As a member of the team, he received wushu training and went on to win fifteen gold medals and one silver medal in Chinese wushu championships, where, despite his young age, he competed against adults.[tpl]cite web|last=Li|first=Jet|title=Life Essay: Part 9|url=http://jetli.com/jet/index.php?l=en&s=life&ss=essays&p=9|work=Essays|publisher=JetLi.com|accessdate=July 30, 2010[/tpl]

According to Li, once, as a child, when the Chinese National Wushu Team went to perform for President Richard Nixon in the United States, he was asked by Nixon to be his personal bodyguard. Li replied, "I don't want to protect any individual. When I grow up, I want to defend my one billion Chinese countrymen!"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jetli.com/jet/index.php?s=life&ss=essays&p=7 |title=LIFE ESSAY: PART 7 |publisher=Jetli.com |accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl]
Li is a master of several styles of wushu, especially Changquan (Northern Longfist Style) and Fanziquan (Tumbling fist). He has also studied other arts including Baguazhang (Eight trigram palm), Taijiquan (Supreme ultimate fist), Xingyiquan (Shape intent fist), Zuiquan (Drunken fist), Yingzhaoquan (Eagle claw fist) and Tanglangquan (Praying mantis fist). He did not learn Nanquan (Southern fist), because his training focused only in the Northern Shaolin Styles. He has also studied some of wushu's main weapons, such Sanjiegun (Three section staff), Gun (staff), Dao (Broadsword), Jian (Straight sword) and many more.[tpl]cite web|title=Wushu-ography|url=http://jetli.com/jet/index.php?s=body&ss=wushuography&l=en|publisher=Jetli.com|accessdate=August 16, 2010[/tpl]
It is Jet Li's authentic martial arts prowess that enabled his rise to domestic and international fame.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=YSjHUvePYVAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Celebrity+in+China+By+Louise+Edwards,+Elaine+Jeffreys&source=bl&ots=LWbTgHr1Gl&sig=vSwth0m-kWkXaFM0MYioj8LgfA4&hl=en&ei=NEehTMrvNIe3ccLhxcYB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Jet Li: "Wushu Master" in Sport and Film in Celebrity in China |publisher=Books.google.com.au |accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl]

==Acting career==

===Chinese films===

The fame gained by his sports winnings led to a career as a martial arts film star, beginning in mainland China and then continuing into Hong Kong. Li acquired his screen name in 1982 in the Philippines when a publicity company thought his real name was too hard to pronounce. They likened his career to an aircraft, which likewise "takes-off" as quickly, so they placed the name Jet Li on the movie posters. Soon everybody was calling him by this new name, which was also based on the nickname, "Jet," given to him as a young student, due to his speed and grace when training with the Beijing Wushu team. He made his debut with the 1982 film Shaolin Temple. Some of his more famous Chinese films include:
Li starred in the 1995 film High Risk, where Jet Li plays a Captain who becomes disillusioned after his wife is murdered by crime lords. Along the way, he pairs up with a wacky sell-out actor, Frankie (played by Jacky Cheung), and proceeds to engage in a series of violent battles in a high-rise building. The setting is similar to that of Die Hard and both their Chinese film titles. This movie is notable in that director Wong Jing had such a terrible experience working with Jackie Chan in Jing's previous film City Hunter that he chose to make Cheung's character a biting satire of Chan. Jet Li would later publicly apologize to Chan for taking part in it.
Li has two wuxia feature films scheduled for release in 2011, The Sorcerer and the White Snake and Flying Swords of Dragon Gate, the latter is helmed by Tsui Hark.
In order to promote tai chi, in 2012 Jet Li will star in a film titled Tai Chi and will co-produce the movie with Chen Kuo-Fu. Li will portray Tai Chi master Yang Lu-ch'an.[tpl]cite web | url = http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?jet_li_to_star_in_new_tai-chi_movie_16424.aspx | title = Jet Li to star in new tai-chi movie | publisher=Asia Pacific Arts | date = February 23, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2011-05/20/content_22606294.htm|title='Tai Chi' releases concept poster|publisher=china.org.cn|accessdate=2011-07-13|date=2011-05-20[/tpl]

===American films===

In 1998, he made his American film debut in Lethal Weapon 4 which also marked the first time he had ever played a villain in a film. He agreed to do Lethal Weapon 4 after the producer Joel Silver promised to give him the leading role in his next film, Romeo Must Die (2000) alongside late singer Aaliyah. The film became a box office hit.
Li turned down Chow Yun-fat's role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) because he promised his wife that he would not make any films during her pregnancy.[ref]Burr, Martha. "Kiss of the Dragon."
Kung Fu Magazine June 2001 KungFuMagazine.com, February 13, 2007[/ref] He also turned down the role of Seraph in The Matrix trilogy, based on his belief that the role was not one which required his skills and that the films were iconic and stunning enough without adding his name to the cast list.
In 2001, he appeared in two more Hollywood films: The One, which was the first of his films with Jason Statham, and Kiss of the Dragon opposite Bridget Fonda which did moderately well at the box office. In July 2001, Li agreed to produce and star in an action film with Jackie Chan which was to be released in 2002 or 2003, but no further news of their collaboration surfaced until 2006. In 2002, the period martial arts epic film Hero was released in the Chinese market. This film was both a commercial and critical success and became the highest-grossing motion picture in Chinese film history at the time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2009/09-067.html|title=Special Screening of Historic Movie "Hero" at the Library Promotes Cultural Understanding|publisher=Library of Congress[/tpl] In 2003 he reunited with producer Joel Silver for the action thriller film Cradle 2 The Grave where he starred alongside rapper DMX and fellow martial artist Mark Dacascos. In 2004, Li lent his likeness, voice and provided motion capture work for the video game Jet Li: Rise to Honor.
Li took on a more serious role in the 2005 film, Unleashed (a.k.a. Danny the Dog), where he portrayed an adult with the mentality of a child who has been raised like an animal. Although his martial arts skills were utilized extensively, it was a somber film with more depth than had been previously seen in Li's films, and co-starred dramatic actors Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman.
In 2006, the martial arts film epic Fearless, was released worldwide. Although he will continue to make martial arts films, Fearless is his last wushu epic.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=December 2013[/tpl] In Fearless, he played Huo Yuanjia, the real-life founder of Chin Woo Athletic Association, who reportedly defeated foreign boxers and Japanese martial artists in publicized events at a time when China's power was seen as eroding. Together with the film Fist of Legend, Li has portrayed both Chen Jun, the student and avenger of Huo Yuanjia (aka Fok Yun Gap), as well as Huo Yuanjia himself. Fearless was released on January 26, 2006 in Hong Kong, followed by a September 22, 2006 release in the United States where it reached second place in its first weekend.
Li has stated in an interview with the Shenzhen Daily newspaper that this will be his last martial arts epic, which is also stated in the film's television promotions. However, he plans to continue his film career in other genres. Specifically, he plans to continue acting in action and martial arts films; epic films deal more with religious and philosophical issues.
Li's 2007 Hollywood film, War, was released in August of that year, and re-teamed him with actor Jason Statham, who previously starred with him in The One, and action choreographer Corey Yuen. War raked in a disappointing $23 million at the box office, becoming one of Li's lowest grossers in America; however, it was a hit on video, accumulating nearly $52 million in rental revenue, more than doubling its box office take.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=homevideo&id=war07.htm |title=War Rental Revenue |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl] With the exception of Romeo Must Die and the worldwide release of Hero, most of Li's American films have been only modest hits like Kiss Of The Dragon, The One, Unleashed, Cradle 2 the Grave, and the worldwide release of Fearless.

In late 2007, Li returned again to China to participate in the China/Hong Kong co-production of the period war film The Warlords with Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro. This film with its focus on dramatics rather than martial arts netted Li the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor.
Li and fellow martial arts veteran Jackie Chan finally appeared together onscreen for the first time in The Forbidden Kingdom, which began filming in May 2007 and was released to critical and commercial success on April 18, 2008. The film was based on the legend of the Monkey King from the Chinese folk novel Journey to the West.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jackiechan.com/blog/207242--Shooting-Begins |title=Shooting Begins |publisher=Jackiechan.com |date=May 1, 2007 |accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl]Forbidden Kingdom Facts[tpl]dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl] Li also starred as the lead villain in the fantasy action film The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor with actors Brendan Fraser, Isabella Leong and Michelle Yeoh.Chung, Philip W.

After a one-year hiatus from filmmaking, Jet Li returned to acting in 2010, portraying a mercenary in the film The Expendables, teaming up with action stars Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Mickey Rourke, Eric Roberts, Steve Austin, Terry Crews, and Randy Couture. It was the third time he had teamed up with Statham. In 2012, he reprised his role briefly in the sequel The Expendables 2 and will return for the third film The Expendables 3.

==Views on life and martial arts==

[tpl]quote box|width=22em|quote=I never say to myself I'm the best fighter in the world. If someone learns martial arts solely to pick fights on the street, to lean on it as a keystone weapon in conflicts, to use it to bully and intimidate others – then that person, in my opinion, cannot be considered a true martial artist.|source=—Jet Li[tpl]cite web|last=Li|first=Jet|title=Have you ever had a fight in real life?|url=http://jetli.com/jet/index.php?l=en&s=body&ss=questions&p=x&date=001020|work=Questions|publisher=jetli.com|accessdate=August 8, 2010[/tpl][/tpl]
Li as a Buddhist believes that the difficulties of everyday life can be overcome with the help of religious philosophies.[tpl]cite web|last=Li|first=Jet|title=Are you really strong in real life?|url=http://jetli.com/jet/index.php?l=en&s=life&ss=questions&p=x&date=010716|publisher=jetli.com|accessdate=August 8, 2010[/tpl] He thinks that fame is not something he can control; therefore, he does not care about it.[tpl]cite web|last=Li|first=Jet|title=What do you think about fame?|url=http://jetli.com/jet/index.php?l=en&s=life&ss=questions&p=x&date=020214|work=Questions|publisher=Jetli.com|accessdate=August 8, 2010[/tpl]
According to Li, everything he has ever wanted to tell the world can be found in three of his films: the message of Hero is that the suffering of one person can never be as significant as the suffering of a nation; Unleashed shows that violence is never a solution and Fearless tells that the biggest enemy of a person is himself. Li thinks that the greatest weapon is a smile and the largest power is love.[tpl]cite web|title=The Liberation of Jet Li|url=http://www.asianbite.com/default.asp?display=2304|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=August 8, 2010|date=December 2, 2008[/tpl]
About Wushu, Li said that he believes the essence of martial arts is not power or speed but inner harmony and considers it a sad development that today's Wushu championships place greater emphasis on form than on the essence of being a martial artist. He believes Wushu now lacks individuality and competitors move like machines, whereas according to his views Wushu should not be considered a race where the fastest athlete wins. He would like to see Wushu as a form of art, where artists have a distinctive style. Li blames the new competition rules that, according to him, place limitations on martial artists.[tpl]cite web|last=Li|first=Jet|title=Wushu, Past and Present|url=http://jetli.com/jet/index.php?l=en&s=body&ss=essays&p=1|work=Essays|publisher=jetli.com|accessdate=August 8, 2010[/tpl]
Li believes that Wushu is not primarily for self-defense and instead of trying to play the hero people should think about peaceful resolutions of conflicts and call the police if necessary: "A gun outdoes years of martial arts training in a split second. Like I've said many times before, it is important to differentiate between movies and reality. The hero in movies may be able to knock the gun off his opponent and save the day, but in real life – probably that is not the case."[tpl]cite web|last=Li|first=Jet|title=The definition of Wushu – Part 2|url=http://jetli.com/jet/index.php?l=en&s=body&ss=essays&p=3|work=Essays|publisher=Jetli.com|accessdate=August 8, 2010[/tpl] He has also stated that he has never had to use his martial arts skills in a real life fight and he does not wish to, either.

===Philanthropy===

Li has been a "philanthropic ambassador" of the Red Cross Society of China since January 2006. He contributed 500,000 yuan (US$62,500) of box office revenues from his film Fearless to the Red Cross' psychological sunshine project, which promotes mental health."Jet Li Becomes 'Philanthropic Ambassador' of Red Cross."  Xinhua News Agency. January 23, 2006. China.org.cn
In April 2007, touched by his life-shaking experience in the Maldives when he was close to dying during the 2004 tsunami, Li formed his own non-profit foundation called The One Foundation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/01/08/talkasia.jetli/index.html |title=Interview with Jet Li |publisher=CNN  |date=September 24, 2008 |accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onefoundation.cn/ |title=The One Foundation |publisher=Onefoundation.cn |accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl] The One Foundation supports international disaster relief efforts in conjunction with the Red Cross as well as other efforts, including mental health awareness and suicide prevention. Since the starting of the foundation, Li has been involved with recovery efforts in seven disasters, including the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and Typhoon Morakot in Taiwan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-08/17/content_11899532.htm |title=Chinese mainland to hold television fundraiser for Taiwan typhoon relief |publisher=xinhuanet.com.|accessdate=November 14, 2010[/tpl] In the 2013 Lushan earthquake in Ya'an, Sichuan, Li and other members of the entertainment sector were the first to appeal for donations of money, goods and materials to help the victims of the disaster.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onefoundation.cn/ |title=The One Foundation |publisher=Onefoundation.cn |accessdate=May 3, 2013[/tpl]http://news.ifeng.com/mainland/special/lushandizhen/content-3/detail_2013_04/21/24457577_0.shtml Wu Jing was a One Foundation volunteer and helped in the effort.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/516-Wu-Jing-Gives-a-Helping-Hand-in-Sichuan.html |title=Wu Jing Gives a Helping Hand in Sichuan |publisher=Wu-Jing.org |accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl]
Li discussed his commitment to philanthropy in an interview with the December 2009 issue of Alliance magazine, stating that "grassroots non-government organizations can help the government in its blind spots. Government relief is not always detail-oriented. Grassroots NGOs can’t be as big as a government effort, but they need to be flexible and independent."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alliancemagazine.org/en/content/interview-jet-li |title=Interview – Jet Li | |publisher=Alliancemagazine.org |date=December 1, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl]
In September 2010, Jet Li was appointed by the International Red Cross as the first Good Will Ambassador. He posted online saying "Today I signed a deal with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies – IFRC - to become the FIRST goodwill ambassador in the history of this humanitarian organization.
