[[Strobilurin]]

CATEGORIES: Fungicides

Strobilurins are a group of chemical compounds used in agriculture as fungicides. They are part of the larger group of QoI inhibitors, which act to inhibit the respiratory chain at the level of Complex III.
Some strobilurins are azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, picoxystrobin, fluoxastrobin, oryzastrobin, dimoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin.
Strobilurins represented a major development in fungus-based fungicides. They were extracted from the fungus Strobilurus tenacellus. They have a suppressive effect on other fungi, reducing competition for nutrients; they inhibit electron transfer in mitochondria, disrupting metabolism and preventing growth of the target[tpl]Ambiguous|date=July 2011[/tpl] fungi.
Strobilurins are mostly contact fungicides with a long half time as they are absorbed into the cuticle and not transported any further.
