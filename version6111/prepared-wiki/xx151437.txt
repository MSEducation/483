The eastern black crested gibbon (Nomascus nasutus), also known as the Cao-vit black crested gibbon or the Cao-vit crested gibbon, is a species of gibbon from southeast China and north Vietnam.
Since the 1960s there had been no confirmed sightings of the eastern black crested gibbon and it was thought to be possibly extinct. In 2002 a small population was rediscovered in the Trùng Khánh District, Cao Bằng Province, in northeast Vietnam.[tpl]Cite journal | author1 = Geissmann, T. | author2 = La Quang Trung | author3 = Trinh Dinh Hoang | author4 = Dang Ngoc Can | author5 = Pham Duc Tien | author6 = Vu Dinh Thong | year = 2002 | title = Report on an overall survey of the Cao Vit gibbon population (Nomascus sp. cf. nasutus) in Trung Khanh District, Cao Bang Province (second overall survey) | journal = Fauna & Flora International, Asia Pacific Programme | location = Hanoi, Vietnam | pages = 8 pp | url = http://www.gibbons.de/main/papers/2002caobang_survey.html[/tpl] In 2005 it was estimated that this population included about 35-37 individuals, and about 10 remain just across border in Jingxi County, Guangxi, China.

The eastern black crested gibbon is one of the rarest and most critically endangered primates in the world. This status has resulted from deforestation of its habitat, encroachment, and poaching.  It is considered to be one of "The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates."[tpl]cite journal | editor1-last = Mittermeier | editor1-first = R.A. | editor2-last = Wallis | editor2-first = J. | editor3-last = Rylands | editor3-first = A.B. | editor4-last = Ganzhorn | editor4-first = J.U. | editor5-last = Oates | editor5-first = J.F. | editor6-last = Williamson | editor6-first = E.A. | editor7-last = Palacios | editor7-first = E. | editor8-last = Heymann | editor8-first = E.W. | editor9-last = Kierulff | editor9-first = M.C.M. | editor10-last = Long Yongcheng | editor11-last = Supriatna | editor11-first = J. | editor12-last = Roos | editor12-first = C. | editor13-last = Walker | editor13-first = S. | editor14-last = Cortés-Ortiz | editor14-first = L. | editor15-last = Schwitzer | editor15-first = C. | others = Illustrated by S.D.

==Taxonomy==

The eastern black crested gibbon is classified as a separate from other crested gibbons based on molecular data, fur colouration, and differences in vocal communication. Previously it has been considered conspecific with the Hainan black crested gibbon or as a subspecies of the black crested gibbon. Until the sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene the Hainan black crested gibbon was thought to be Nomascus nasutus hainanus, a subspecies of eastern black crested gibbon. The researchers proposed that the genetic separation showed it was a distinct species.[tpl]Cite journal | first1 = C. | last1 = Roos | first2 = V.
