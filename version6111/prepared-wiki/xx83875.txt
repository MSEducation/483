==History==

In September 1996, 1155636 Ontario Inc. (a company majority controlled by Baton Broadcasting, with the remaining interests held by Shaw Cable, Astral Broadcasting and Les Films Rozon inc.) was granted a television broadcasting licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for The Comedy Network.[tpl]cite web | title =Archived – Decision CRTC 96-596 | work =Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission | publisher = Government of Canada | url =http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1996/DB96-596.htm | accessdate = June 4, 2013[/tpl]
The channel launched on October 17, 1997,The Comedy Network Turns 10 Today and Goes Full-On-Cyber with Revolutionary Revamped Website with the slogan Time Well Wasted, a variation of the U.S.-based channel A&E's then-slogan "Time Well Spent". The slogan was used until the network's overhaul on November 1, 2011.
Through various acquisitions over the years, Shaw, Astral and Les Films Rozon sold their interest in the service to Baton, which became Bell Globemedia in 2001 and was renamed CTVglobemedia in 2007, then Bell Media in 2011 following its acquisition by Bell Canada.
The Comedy Network maintained a consistent look since its incarnation in 1997. The 'yellow oval' logo (which has undergone slight modifications throughout its use) was in use since the network's launch in 1997 until November 1, 2011, when The Comedy Network was relaunched with a new look, consisting a new simplified logo and revamped on-air presentation.It’s a NEWvember for The Comedy Network as New Look and Feel Revealed Nov. 1 Bell Media press release 2011-10-28
In August 2013, the CRTC denied an amendment that would allow The Comedy Network to run more younger-oriented programs, especially animations, as it would lead the channel to compete with Teletoon and BiteTV.http://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2013/2013-333.htmhttp://o.canada.com/business/comedy-network-bell-media-crtc/ Due to this, several programs targeted mainly to younger demographics, including Conan and even several Comedy Central programs, moved to sister channel MuchMusic.http://www.thecomedynetwork.ca/blogs/2013/10/comedy-on-muchhttp://blog.muchmusic.com/find-out-where-your-favourite-shows-moved-with-this-handy-guide/
