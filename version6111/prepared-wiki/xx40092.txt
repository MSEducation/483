==The city==

Established as a small fishing port and becoming a major sea salt producing municipality from several salt evaporation ponds since the Spanish Era, Las Piñas has grown into an important residential, commercial and industrial suburb of Metro Manila.
Las Piñas is famous for its Bamboo Organ located inside the St. Joseph Parish Church in the old district of the city.  Built in 1824 by a Catholic priest, Fr. Diego Cera, it is the only organ of its kind in the world with organ pipes mostly made out of bamboo. This famous organ is praised for its unique, rare, and melodious sound.
The Sarao Motors factory, also located in Las Piñas, is the place where jeepneys are assembled piece by piece in painstaking individual production. The factory remains open to buyers and curious tourists all year round.
Las Piñas also houses SM Southmall, which has an area of 205,120 square meters and is located along Alabang–Zapote Road. The newest shopping mall development in the city is SM Center Las Piñas, located few meters away from City Hall. The first high-rise building in the city is the 16-storey residential Almanza Metropolis.
Las Piñas, also known as one of the cleanest cities in Metro Manila, is in the list of the "Clean and Green Hall of Fame" awarded by the Philippine Government. It is also the first local government unit in the Philippines that has been honoured with the prestigious Global 500 Roll of Honour of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). These honours were in recognition of the city's outstanding achievements in the protection and improvement of the environment.
Las Piñas has recently acquired the status "Most Competitive City" in the Philippines, together with Davao City, Makati, Muntinlupa and Marikina.

===Etymology===

The story about the true origin of the city's name, "Las Piñas", varies.  Some said that traders from the province of Cavite and Batangas shipped first their piña (pineapples) for sale to this town before they are distributed in  nearby markets. Others related that it was "Las Peñas" (the rocks) evident by the quarrying of stones and adobe which were used to construct buildings and bridges.  The old church bell of St. Joseph Parish Church founded by Fr. Diego Cera has been preserved inside the church museum.  An inscription on the bell states "Siendo cura del pueblo de Laspeñas el M.R.P. Padre Diego Cera se fundio este equilon ano de 1820" showing that even during the time of Fr. Cera, the town's first parish  priest, the town has been called "Las Peñas" until after sometime that the spelling of the town's name was changed into "Las Piñas".Pransism (2011-11).

==History==

Las Piñas was one of the earliest fishing settlements on the shores of Manila Bay and was proclaimed a town of Cavite province either in 1762 or 1797. Its exact date of creation cannot be ascertained because historical records vary. Cavada, a Spanish historian and Fr. Juan Medina placed it at 1762, while Manuel Buzeta recorded the date at 1797.
Besides being famous for its Bamboo Organ, which was built by Fr. Diego Cera and completed in 1824, the town of Las Piñas was also a major war theater during the 1896 Philippine Revolution, as it was occupied by forces of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. Las Piñas was occupied by the Japanese during World War II and liberated by the combined American and Filipino forces.
In 1901, the municipality of Las Piñas was separated from Cavite and incorporated to the newly created province of Rizal pursuant to the Philippine Commission Act No. 137. Two years later, it was combined with the town of Parañaque, with the latter as the seat of a new municipal government.
It was separated from Parañaque to become an independent municipality again on March 27, 1907 by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 1625. Then, with the founding of the Metropolitan Manila Area or Metro Manila in 1976, Las Piñas became one of the municipalities making up the region.
On February 12, 1997, President Fidel V. Ramos signed the bill which elevated Las Piñas from municipality into a city. A plebiscite held a month after approved the city status by its residents, and Las Piñas became the 10th city of Metro Manila on March 26, 1997.
