His father criticized his Heaven on earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism:
 
 "Josh Muravchik’s father, Manny, eighty-five-years-old, breathing through oxygen tubes, was handing out his own two-page Xeroxed affirmation of socialism."  "Manny let the reader know that his own life, and that of Josh’s mother, would be impossible today absent the very sort of anti-market reforms—Medicare, rent-controlled apartments—for which they’d worked while Josh was still a pisher and toward which he sounded at best ambivalent today." 
 "Father told son that if there was utopian impulse to be feared, it was that messianic laissez-faire nonsense he must have picked up once he’d left home. ''You think your mother and I could survive in your perfect world, Mr. Capitalist Shill?''<ref name="HM"/>

His mother was too upset with his book to attend the discussion.
In 2006, he called for the bombing of Iran in a Los Angeles Times op-ed entitled "Bomb Iran".[tpl]cite news |title= Bomb Iran |author= Joshua Muravchik |url= http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-op-muravchik19nov19,0,1681154.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail |newspaper= LA Times |date= November 19, 2006 |accessdate=June 27, 2011[/tpl]
