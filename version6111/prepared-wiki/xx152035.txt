==History==

The station began as K46CZ with a construction permit issued on May 31, 1990 to Gary M. and Deborah R. Kenny. The low-power station was to broadcast on UHF channel 46, serving the Joplin area. After two extensions of the construction permit, the station was licensed on October 19, 1993 and took call letters KCLJ-LP in May 1996. In March 2000, Joplin full-service station KSNF was granted a permit to build their digital facilities on UHF channel 46, displacing KCLJ-LP. In July 2001, the station originally applied to move to channel 24, but later changed the application to specify channel 30. At the same time, they also applied to upgrade the license to Class A. The station was licensed as a Class A on channel 30 on June 14, 2002. The station surrendered their class A license on April 26, 2011, returning to basic low-power status under the call sign KCLJ-LP.
