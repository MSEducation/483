[[Transport in Ireland]]

CATEGORIES: Transport in Ireland

Most of the transport system in Ireland is in public hands, either side of the Irish border. The Irish road network has evolved separately in the two jurisdictions Ireland is divided up into, while the Irish rail network was mostly created prior to the partition of Ireland.
In the Republic of Ireland, the Minister for Transport, acting through the Department of Transport, is responsible for the State's road network, rail network, public transport, airports and several other areas. Although some sections of road have been built using private or public-private funds, and are operated as toll roads, they are owned by the Government of Ireland. The rail network is also state-owned and operated, while the government currently still owns the main airports. Public transport is mainly in the hands of a statutory corporation, Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), and its subsidiaries, Bus Átha Cliath (Dublin Bus), Bus Éireann (Irish Bus), and Iarnród Éireann (Irish Rail).
On 1 November 2005, the Irish government published the Transport 21 plan which includes €18bn for improved roads and €16bn for improved rail, including the Western Railway Corridor and the Dublin Metro.
In Northern Ireland, the road network and railways are in state ownership. The Department for Regional Development is responsible for these and other areas (such as water services). Two of the three main airports in Northern Ireland are privately operated and owned. The exception is City of Derry Airport, which is owned and funded by Derry City Council. A statutory corporation, the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company (which trades as Translink) operates public transport services through its three subsidiaries - NI Railways Company Limited, Ulsterbus Limited, and Citybus Limited (now branded as Metro).

==Railways==

Ireland's railways are in State ownership, with Iarnród Éireann (Irish Rail) operating services in the Republic and NI Railways operating services in Northern Ireland. The two companies co-operate in providing the joint Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast. InterCity services are provided between Dublin and the major towns and cities of the Republic, and in Ulster along the Belfast–Derry railway line. Suburban railway networks operate in Dublin, Dublin Suburban Rail, and Belfast, Belfast Suburban Rail, with limited local services being offered in, or planned for, Cork, Limerick[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl], and Galway[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl].
The rail network in Ireland was developed by various private companies during the 19th century, with some receiving government funding. The network reached its greatest extent by 1920. A broad gauge of 1600mm (5 ft 3in)[tpl]cite web|title =CIA World Factbook—Ireland—Transportation|publisher =CIA|date =2008-11-06|url =https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ei.html#Trans|accessdate =2008-11-11[/tpl] was agreed as the standard for the island, although there were also hundreds of kilometres of 914mm (3 ft) narrow gauge railways.
Many lines in the west were decommissioned in the 1930s under Éamon de Valera, with a further large cull in services by both CIÉ and the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA) during the 1960s, leaving few working lines in the northern third of the island. There is a campaign to bring some closed lines back into service, in particular the Limerick-Sligo line (the Western Railway Corridor), to facilitate economic regeneration in the west, which has lagged behind the rest of the country. There is also a move to restore service on the Dublin to Navan line, and smaller campaigns to re-establish the rail links between Sligo and Enniskillen/Omagh/Derry and Mullingar and Athlone/Galway. Under the Irish government's Transport 21 plan, the Cork to Midleton rail link was reopened in 2009. The re-opening of the Navan-Clonsilla rail link and the Western Rail Corridor are amongst future projects as part of the same plan.[tpl]cite web|title=Heavy Rail|work=Project |publisher=Transport 21 |date=2008-06-18 |url=http://www.transport21.ie/Projects/Heavy_Rail/Heavy_Rail.html |accessdate =2008-11-11[/tpl]
Public transport services in Northern Ireland are sparse in comparison with those of the rest of Ireland or Great Britain. A large railway network was severely curtailed in the 1950s and 1960s.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.rpsi-online.org/schools/irishrailwaysystem.htm |title=The Irish Railway System |publisher=The Railway Preservation Society of Ireland |accessdate=2010-03-29[/tpl] Current services includes suburban routes to Larne, Newry and Bangor, as well as services to Derry. There is also a branch from Coleraine to Portrush.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.translink.co.uk/NI-Railways/NI-Railways-Timetables/ |title=Northern Ireland Railways Timetables |publisher=Translink |accessdate=2010-03-29[/tpl]
Since 1984 an electrically operated train service run by Iarnród Éireann has linked Dublin with its coastal suburbs. Running initially between Bray and Howth, the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) system was extended from Bray to Greystones in 2000 and further extended from Howth Junction to Malahide. In 2004 a light rail system, Luas, was opened in Dublin serving the central and western suburbs, run by Veolia under franchise from the Railway Procurement Agency. The construction of the Luas system caused much disruption in Dublin. Plans to construct a Dublin Metro service including underground lines were mooted in 2001, but stalled in the financial crisis at the end of that decade.
Ireland has one of the largest dedicated freight railways in Europe, operated by Bord na Móna totalling nearly [tpl]convert|1400|km|mi[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.bnm.ie/corporate/index.jsp?&1nID=93&2nID=97&3nID=97&pID=357&nID=359 |title=Description of Railway |publisher=Bord na Móna |accessdate=29 March 2010-03-29[/tpl]

==Roads==

Ireland's roads link Dublin with all the major cities (Belfast, Cork, Limerick, Derry, Galway, and Waterford). Driving is on the left. Signposts in the Republic of Ireland are shown in kilometres and speed limits in kilometres per hour. Distance and speed limit signs in Northern Ireland use imperial units in common with the rest of the United Kingdom.
Historically, land owners developed most roads and later Turnpike Trusts collected tolls so that as early as 1800 Ireland had a [tpl]convert|16100|km|mi[/tpl] road network.[tpl]cite web|title =History of Transport in Ireland, Part 1|work =About Us|publisher =Córas Iompair Éireann|url =http://www.cie.ie/about_us/schools_and_enthusiasts.asp#1|accessdate =2008-11-11[/tpl] In 2005 the Irish Government launched Transport 21, a plan envisaging the investment of €34 billion in transport infrastructure from 2006 until 2015.[tpl]cite web|title =Roads|work =Projects|publisher =Transport 21|date =2008-06-18|url =http://www.transport21.ie/Projects/Roads/Roads.html|accessdate =2008-11-11[/tpl] Several road projects were progressed but the economic crisis that began in 2008-09 has prevented its full implementation.

===Bus services===

Ireland's first mail coach services were contracted with the government by John Anderson with William Bourne in 1791 who also paid to improve the condition of the roads.[tpl]Cite book|title=Parliamentary papers, Reports from Committees, Volume 20 |publisher=House of Commons |location=London |pages=3, 38–43 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=K0wSAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA6-PA42&dq=john+anderson+mail+coach+ireland&cd=1#v=onepage&q=john%20anderson%20mail%20coach%20ireland |year=1837 |accessdate=2010-03-29[/tpl] The system of mail coaches, carriages and "bians" was further developed by Charles Bianconi, based in Clonmel, from 1815 as a fore-runner of the modern Irish public transportation system.[tpl]cite web |last=Murphy |first=John |title=Bianconi home to become Clonmel hotel |publisher=Irish Examiner |date=2005-01-04 |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2005/0104/ireland/landmark-house-to-become-clonmel-hotel-573513087.html |accessdate =2008-11-11[/tpl]
State-owned Bus Éireann (Irish Bus) currently provides most bus services in the Republic of Ireland, outside Dublin, including an express coach network connecting most cities in Ireland, along with local bus services in the provincial cities. Bus Átha Cliath (Dublin Bus), a sister company of Bus Éireann, provides most of the bus services in Dublin, with some other operators providing a number of routes. These include Aircoach, a subsidiary of FirstGroup which provides services to Dublin Airport from Dublin city centre, South Dublin City, Greystones and Bray. They also operate two intercity express non stop services service between Dublin Airport, Dublin City Centre, and Cork and also a non stop route between Belfast City Centre, Dublin Airport and Dublin City. Other operators such as Irish Citylink and GoBus.ie compete on the Dublin-Galway route. Matthews Coaches run a direct service from Bettystown, Laytown and Julianstown to Dublin whilst Dublin Coach operate services to Portlaoise and Limerick.
Some private rural operators exist, such as Halpenny's in Blackrock, County Louth, which was the first private bus operator to run a public service in Ireland, Bus Feda (Feda O'Donnell Coaches), which operates twice daily routes from Ranafast, County Donegal to Galway and back,Feda O'Donnell Coaches and Lough Swilly Bus Company.
In Northern Ireland Ulsterbus provides the bus network, with its sister company Metro providing services in Belfast. Both are part of state-owned Translink. Tiger Coaches operates a very late night bus service on Friday and Saturday nights between Belfast and Lisburn.Belfast Telegraph 15 November 2010 report on launch of Tiger Coaches service
Private hire companies such as Eirebus Eirebus Irish Private Coach Travel offer groups traveling throughout Ireland with options ranging from cars to 56 passenger coaches and many run route between airports, Pavilions Shopping Centre, National Convention Centre and the O2.
Cross-border services (e.g. Dublin city centre to Belfast) are run primarily by a partnership of Ulsterbus and Bus Éireann with some services run across the border exclusively by one of the two companies (e.g. Derry–Sligo run by Bus Éireann). Aircoach, a private operator, does however operate a competing Dublin to Belfast Express service via Dublin Airport.

==Pipelines==

Natural gas transmission network [tpl]convert|1795|km|abbr=on[/tpl] (2003). There is a much more extensive distribution network.

==Ports and harbours==

Ireland has major ports in Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Rosslare, Derry and Waterford. Smaller ports exist in Arklow, Ballina, Drogheda, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Foynes, Galway, Larne, Limerick, New Ross, Sligo, Warrenpoint and Wicklow.
Ports in the Republic handle 3.6 million travellers crossing the sea between Ireland and Great Britain each year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/statistics/passengermovementbysea.htm |title=Direct Passenger Movement by Sea from and to Ireland (Republic) (000's) |publisher=Central Statistics Office |year=2006 |accessdate=2010-01-24[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] This has been steadily dropping for a number of years (20% since 1999), probably as a result of low cost airlines. Ferry connections between Britain and Ireland via the Irish Sea include the routes from Fishguard and Pembroke to Rosslare, Holyhead to Dún Laoghaire, Stranraer to Belfast and Larne, and Cairnryan to Larne; the Swansea to Cork route has closed. There is also a connection between Liverpool and Belfast via the Isle of Man. The world's largest car ferry, Ulysses, is operated by Irish Ferries on the Dublin–Holyhead route.
In addition, there are ferries from Rosslare and Cork  to France.
The vast majority of heavy goods trade is done by sea. Northern Irish ports handle 10 megatonnes (Mt) of goods trade with Britain annually, while ports in the south handle 7.6 Mt, representing 50% and 40% respectively of total trade by weight.

===Aviation===

Ireland has five main international airports: Dublin Airport, Belfast International Airport (Aldergrove), Cork Airport, Shannon Airport and Ireland West Airport (Knock). Dublin Airport is the busiest of these,[tpl]cite web|title =About us|work =Dublin Airport|publisher =Dublin Airport Authority|url=http://www.dublinairport.com/gns/about-us/overview.aspx |accessdate =2011-03-19[/tpl] carrying over 22 million passengers per year;[tpl]cite web|title =Dublin Airport tops 23 million passengers in 2007|work =Business|publisher =Thomas Crosbie Media|date =2008-01-22|url =http://www.breakingnews.ie/business/mheyojojcwgb/|accessdate =2008-11-09[/tpl] a second terminal (T2) was opened in November 2010.[tpl]cite web|title =Dublin airport's T2 unveiled|work =News|publisher =Irish Times|date =2010-11-19|url =http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/1119/breaking17.html|accessdate =2011-05-09[/tpl] All provide services to Great Britain and continental Europe, while Belfast International, Dublin and Shannon also offer transatlantic services. For several decades until 2007 Shannon was a mandatory stopover for transatlantic routes to the United States.[tpl]cite web|title =Shannon stopover to go by 2008|work =Business News|publisher =RTÉ|date =2005-11-11|url =http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1111/shannon-business.html|accessdate =2008-11-09[/tpl] In recent years it has opened a pre-screening service allowing passengers to pass through US immigration services before departing from Ireland.
There are also several smaller regional airports: George Best Belfast City Airport, City of Derry Airport, Galway Airport, Kerry Airport (Farranfore), Sligo Airport (Strandhill), Waterford Airport and Donegal Airport (Carrickfinn). Scheduled services from these regional points are in the main limited to flights travelling to other parts of Ireland and to Great Britain. Airlines based in Ireland include Aer Lingus (the former national airline of the Republic of Ireland), Ryanair, Aer Arann and CityJet. Services to the Aran Islands are operated from Aerfort na Minna (Connemara Regional Airport).
Ireland's national airline, Aer Lingus, provides air services from Belfast City, Cork, Dublin and Shannon to Europe, North Africa and North America. Cork, Dublin and Shannon airports are run by a State body, the DAA (Dublin Airport Authority). Other Irish airlines are Ryanair, one of the largest in the world, Aer Arann, CityJet, Air Contractors and the newly launched Aer Lingus subsidiary Aer Lingus Regional. There are a number of other operators specialising in general aviation.
