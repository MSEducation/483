SS-N-16 ''Stallion refers to a Soviet 650 mm anti-ship missile that was deployed between 1979 and 1981.  The name is a combination of the American designation of SS-N-16 and the NATO term of Stallion'' for Soviet RU-100s.
It refers to either
The 53.3 cm version carried either the 82R torpedo or the 90R nuclear depth charge. The 65 cm version carried the 83R torpedo or 86R nuclear depth charge.
Serving dual roles, the missile could be outfitted with either an RU-100 Veter, a 20 kiloton nuclear warhead for use against surface ships, or alternatively an RU-100 Vodopad, a Type-40 torpedo for use against submarines.[tpl]clarify|date=March 2011[/tpl]
Its increased range of up to 120 kilometres offered an impressive boost over its predecessor the SS-N-15 Starfish, which could only reach half the distance; although it meant refitting all the old 533 mm torpedo tubes to carry this new 650 mm torpedo.
