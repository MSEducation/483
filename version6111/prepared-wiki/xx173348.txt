==Psychoanalysis and mysticism==

A portion of Sudhir Kakar's work involves the relationship between psychoanalysis and mysticism. His analyses of personages include that of Swami Vivekananda in The Inner World (1978), Mohandas Gandhi in Intimate Relations (1989), and  Ramakrishna in The Analyst and the Mystic (1991).[tpl]Cite book|last=Roland|first=Alan|year=2009|chapter=Mysticism and Psychoanalysis|title=Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion|publisher=Springer|location=US|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g6w727512ht612jk/|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-71802-6_449|pages=594–596|last2=Popovsky|first2=Mark|last3=Peterson|first3=Annette|last4=Bailey|first4=Lee W.|last5=Halligan|first5=Fredrica R.|last6=Gaztambide|first6=Daniel J.|last7=Fredrickson|first7=Regina A.|last8=Madden|first8=Kathryn|last9=Hamman|first9=Jaco J.|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]In The Indian Psyche, 125-188. 1996 New Delhi: Viking by Penguin. Reprint of 1991 book.
Kakar’s fiction novel, Ecstasy (2003)  deals with the "making of a mystic" and with "two characters who are very different. One is steeped in traditional religiosity. The other is a modern, rational sceptic but who is not closed to tradition. It deals with their encounters. And how one is influenced by the other" and the characters were based on Ramakrishna and Vivekananda. The story is set in Rajasthan of 1940s or 1960sThe Rediff Interview/Psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar Date accessed: 1 April 2008
Psychoanalyst Alan Roland (2009) writes that when Kakar applies his psychoanalytic understanding to these "three spiritual figures Vivekananda, Gandhi, Ramakrishna", his analyses are as "fully reductionistic as those of Jeffrey Masson". Roland also disputes the Kakar's theoretical understanding of mysticism from a psychoanalytic standpoint, and writes that it is "highly questionable whether spiritual aspirations, practices, and experiences essentially involve regression."
