In the film, director Jones describes the Bilderberg Group, tracking them to Ottawa and Istanbul to document their private meetings and reveals an alleged eugenics-obsessed group of global elite whose mission is the elimination of most ("80%") of the earth’s population and the enslavement of the rest.  He covers the formation of the North American transportation control grid including its first phase the NAFTA superhighway, discusses the pseudo-science eugenics used by governments, and describes the goals of the elites for the creation of a North American Union.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A554261|title=Jones' town|last=Rosenblatt|first=Josh|date=October 26, 2007|publisher=Austin Chronicle|accessdate=2009-10-23[/tpl] Director Jones also details the history of eugenics and how the elites are purportedly using it to squash the common man.
