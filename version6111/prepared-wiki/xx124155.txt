[[Feldbahn]]

A Feldbahn, or Lorenbahn, is the German term for a narrow gauge field railway, usually not open to the public, which in its simplest form provides for the transportation of agricultural, forestry ([tpl]lang|de|Waldbahn[/tpl]) and industrial raw materials such as wood, peat, stone, earth and sand. Such goods are often transported in tipper wagons, known in German as [tpl]lang|de|Loren[/tpl], hence such a railway is also referred to as a [tpl]lang|de|Lorenbahn[/tpl].

==Military use==

During the First World War, the enormous logistical demands of trench warfare led to the development of military narrow gauge railway or [tpl]lang|de|Heeresfeldbahn[/tpl] networks, also referred to as trench railways. Throughout World War I, the British and French also used trench railways, called War Department Light Railways and Decauville Railways respectively. However, the German approach was less improvised and more permanent. With each successful advance, the British and French forces faced ever lengthening supply lines, while the Germans retreated deeper into their homeland. As a result, the [tpl]lang|de|Feldbahn[/tpl] was an organic growth of existing agricultural, industrial and mining railways. After the war, much remaining trackage and rolling stock was put to use in more conventional narrow gauge applications throughout Europe.

==General use==

In the processing industry, these narrow-gauge railways once held an important role. As a result, Feldbahnen were frequently associated with refractory clay factories, brickyards, sugar factories and iron and steel mills. They were also used for pulling canal barges, transporting military materiel and personnel and removing materials from large-scale building sites and the rubble from ruined cities after the Second World War. Rail gauges were between [tpl]RailGauge|400mm[/tpl] and [tpl]RailGauge|1000mm[/tpl].
The track (rails and sleepers) utilised, ranged from light, rail frames that could be carried and laid by two men and were often laid directly on the ground with no trackbed, to properly laid, ballasted lines for heavy loads and extended use.  Tight curves enabled lines to be more easily routed, largely without structures being required, even in difficult terrain. Provisional track laid along the edges of ditches as they were being extended forward, often on soft ground, led occasionally to derailments. As a result, on many [tpl]lang|de|Feldbahnen[/tpl], wooden planks and other lifting gear were carried. Turntables were usually operated by hand.
Simple and robust vehicles characterised everyday operations. Locomotives were not always at the 'coal face', so it was quite common for individual wagons - even when loaded - to be moved with horses or by human muscle power alone. In tight spaces or where access was difficult, the help of children and youngsters was enlisted to haul tipper wagons.
Frequently rolling stock was hand-built or was manufactured to order in small batches. Usually no signals were installed, the low speeds enabling trains to be driven by sight. At level crossings on larger roads, temporary bells or light signals were installed, that enabled trains to cross safely.
A special type of [tpl]lang|de|Feldbahn[/tpl] were the "engineering railways" ([tpl]lang|de|Pionier-Eisenbahnen[/tpl]) of the former East Germany. These were laid for training and maintenance purposes in the parks of several cities including East Berlin, Magdeburg, Dresden and Halle. They were usually run by children and young people under adult supervision. These engineering lines were (and are), unlike the other [tpl]lang|de|Feldbahnen[/tpl], open to the public and sometimes have signal boxes and extensive rail safety equipment (like the Berlin Pionier-Eisenbahnen).
In the munitions depots of the German Federal Navy ([tpl]lang|de|Bundesmarine[/tpl]), narrow-gauge railways with a rail gauge of [tpl]RailGauge|600|mm[/tpl] were used to move ammunition and materiel. In the depot at Laboe type S 14 ([tpl]convert|14|kg/m|lb/yd|1|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) rail profiles were laid and later changed to new S 20 ([tpl]convert|20|kg/m|lb/yd|1|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) rails . One type DS 60 locomotive and 18 DIEMA DS 90 locomotives were used. The railway stock there also included a fire fighting train, a snow blower and even a rotary snow plough. Three seated coaches were available for the transport of personnel. The line at Aurich depot was closed in 1982 and last operations in Laboe took place in 1993. Finally, in December 1996, the Laboe railway was closed. Its total track length was [tpl]convert|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. A DS 90 locomotive, no. 9, is still in the depot at Laboe as a memorial.

==Today's situation==

The use of [tpl]lang|de|Feldbahnen[/tpl] has reduced dramatically in the last 40 years, as their tasks have been taken on by lorries and  electrically driven conveyor belts. They are now used only where the ground conditions (e.g. moorland or peat bogs) or lack of space (mining) render the routine use of other means impractical. The [tpl]lang|de|Feldbahn[/tpl] is still widely used in Germany in industrial peat extraction, especially in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein. In addition they are still used occasionally in brickworks and other industrial premises. As a result increasing numbers of museums and societies dedicate themselves to the protection of historical [tpl]lang|de|Feldbahn[/tpl] railways. This includes efforts in many places to restore closed [tpl]lang|de|Feldbahnen[/tpl] again and to give them new life as museum railways.
