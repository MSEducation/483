[[Uvula of cerebellum]]

CATEGORIES: Neuroanatomy

The uvula (uvular lobe) forms a considerable portion of the inferior vermis; it is separated on either side from the tonsil by the sulcus vallecul√¶, at the bottom of which it is connected to the tonsil by a ridge of gray matter, indented on its surface by shallow furrows, and hence called the furrowed band.
