==Football career==

Born in Avilés, Asturias, Boris was a youth product of local Real Oviedo's youth ranks. He appeared once for the first team during the 1998–99 campaign, a 0–3 La Liga away loss against Valencia CF on 28 May 1999, and became first-choice for the subsequent seasons as the team suffered top flight relegation in 2001.
Boris then joined Real Sociedad, being an historic signing as he was the first-ever national player from outside the Basque Country to be signed by the club.Boris acabará con 30 años de tradición en la Real (Boris to end 30-year tradition in Real); ABC, 6 August 2002 [tpl]es icon[/tpl]La Real Sociedad rompe con la historia presentando a Boris (Real Sociedad breaks away from history by presenting Boris); Terra, 13 August 2002 [tpl]es icon[/tpl] After appearing in 25 games in the side's runner-up campaign in the league, he played almost no part in the following years, also serving an unassuming loan stint with Córdoba CF (second division) in 2004–05, where he was inclusively ousted from the squad for more than two months.El Córdoba readmite a Boris tras estar casi tres meses apartado (Córdoba readmits Boris after nearly three months); Terra, 15 March 2005 [tpl]es icon[/tpl]

In June 2011, after only 18 league appearances in his last two seasons combined – just three matches in the latter – the 31-year-old left the club and returned to his hometown with his very first football club Real Avilés, in the fourth level.
