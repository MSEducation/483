==Economy==

As one of the world's leading international financial centres, Hong Kong has a major capitalist service economy characterised by low taxation and free trade. The currency, Hong Kong dollar, is the eighth most traded currency in the world as of 2010. Hong Kong was once described by Milton Friedman as the world's greatest experiment in laissez-faire capitalism, but has since instituted a regime of regulations including a minimum wage.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16591088|title=End of an experiment|work=The Economist|date=15 July 2010|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] It maintains a highly developed capitalist economy, ranked the freest in the world by the Index of Economic Freedom every year since 1995.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201201/12/P201201120303.htm|title=Hong Kong ranked world's freest economy for 18th consecutive year |publisher=Government of Hong Kong|date=12 January 2012|accessdate=28 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/ |title=2008 Index of Economic Freedom |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201022352/http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/|archivedate=1 February 2008 |accessdate=1 February 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Clarify|date=August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Top 10 Countries |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/topten.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124041217/http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/topten.cfm|archivedate=24 January 2008|accessdate=1 February 2008[/tpl] It is an important centre for international finance and trade, with one of the greatest concentrations of corporate headquarters in the Asia-Pacific region,[tpl]cite book|title=How to Invest in Offshore Real Estate and Pay Little Or No Taxes|first=Hubert|last=Bromma|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2007|page=161|isbn=978-0-07-147009-4[/tpl] and is known as one of the Four Asian Tigers for its high growth rates and rapid development from the 1960s to the 1990s.

The Hong Kong Government has traditionally played a mostly passive role in the economy, with little by way of industrial policy and almost no import or export controls. Market forces and the private sector were allowed to determine practical development. Under the official policy of "positive non-interventionism", Hong Kong is often cited as an example of laissez-faire capitalism. Following the Second World War, Hong Kong industrialised rapidly as a manufacturing centre driven by exports, and then underwent a rapid transition to a service-based economy in the 1980s.[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.ceo.gov.hk/eng/press/oped.htm|title=Big Market, Small Government|first=Donald|last=Tsang|date=18 September 2006|publisher=Hong Kong Government|accessdate=6 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] Since then, it has grown to become a leading centre for management, financial, IT, business consultation and professional services.
Hong Kong matured to become a financial centre in the 1990s, but was greatly affected by the Asian financial crisis in 1998, and again in 2003 by the SARS outbreak. A revival of external and domestic demand has led to a strong recovery, as cost decreases strengthened the competitiveness of Hong Kong exports and a long deflationary period ended.[tpl]cite web |url=http://info.hktdc.com/econforum/tdc/tdc071201.htm |title=Hong Kong's Export Outlook for 2008: Maintaining Competitiveness through Supply Chain Management|publisher=Hong Kong Trade Development Council |date=6 December 2007|accessdate=30 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hkdf.org/newsarticles.asp?show=newsarticles&newsarticle=126 |title=HKDF –Has Hong Kong Lost its Competitiveness?|publisher=Hong Kong Democratic Foundation|accessdate=14 November 2009 [/tpl] Government intervention, initiated by the later colonial governments and continued since 1997, has steadily increased, with the introduction of export credit guarantees, a compulsory pension scheme, a minimum wage, anti-discrimination laws, and a state mortgage backer.

Statistically Hong Kong's income gap is the greatest in Asia Pacific. According to a report by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme in 2008, Hong Kong's Gini coefficient, at 0.53, was the highest in Asia and "relatively high by international standards".[ref]
</ref><ref>

</ref> However, the government has stressed that income disparity does not equate to worsening of the poverty situation, and that the Gini coefficient is not strictly comparable between regions. The government has named economic restructuring, changes in household sizes, and the increase of high-income jobs as factors that have skewed the Gini coefficient.<ref>

Most comprehensive schools in Hong Kong fall under three categories: the rarer public schools; the more common subsidised schools, including government aids-and-grant schools; and private schools, often run by Christian organisations and having admissions based on academic merit rather than on financial resources. Outside this system are the schools under the Direct Subsidy Scheme and private international schools.

In addition to the public post-secondary institutions there are also a number of private higher institutions which offer higher diplomas and associate degree courses for those who fail to enter a college for a degree study so as to boost their qualification of education, some of whom can have a second chance of getting into a university if they have a good performance in these sub-degree courses.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-06-05/hong-kong-says-international-schools-can-t-meet-primary-demand|title=Hong Kong Says International Schools Can't Meet Primary Demand|first=Hwee Ann|last=Tan|date=5 June 2013|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=9 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Global Tourism Higher Education: Past, Present, and Future|isbn=9781136448478|first=Cathy|last=Hsu|date=12 November 2012|publisher=Routledge|pages=139–142[/tpl]

However, Hong Kong has been developing its own postgraduate medical institutions, in particular the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, and this is gradually taking over the responsibility for all postgraduate medical training in the territory.
Since 2011, there have been growing concerns that mothers-to-be from mainland China, in a bid to obtain the right of abode in Hong Kong and the benefits that come with it, have saturated the neonatal wards of the city's hospitals both public and private. This has led to protest from local pregnant women for the government to remedy the issue, as they have found difficulty in securing a bed space for giving birth and routine check-ups. Other concerns in the decade of 2001–2010 relate to the workload medical staff experience; and medical errors and mishaps, which are frequently highlighted in local news.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/world/asia/mainland-chinese-flock-to-hong-kong-to-have-babies.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=Mainland Chinese Flock to Hong Kong to Give Birth|first=Sharon|last=LaFraniere|date=22 February 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=9 June 2013[/tpl]
