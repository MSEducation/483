[[Spin Fighters]]

CATEGORIES: 1990s toys, Tops

Spin Fighters were metal top toys that were made in the early 1990s. They came in two colors, black and gold. These tops were also printed with characters from TV shows or cartoon characters. The black top usually stood for the bad character and the gold top was for the good character. There were also top launchers in which tops could be tightly wound and then released on a flat surface, or the Spin Fighters bowl in which the tops battled (hitting against each other) until the last top spinning was the winner. Spin Fighters were usually sold two to a package, one gold and one black spin fighter. Launchers and Spin Fighters bowls were sold separately. You could also wear Spin Fighters tops on jackets, shirts, and hats. Production stopped around 1996–97.
