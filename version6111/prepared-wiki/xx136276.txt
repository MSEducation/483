Michael John Twiss (born 26 December 1977) is an English former footballer who played as a midfielder. He scored 95 goals in 445 competitive matches in a 15 year career.
Beginning his career with Manchester United, he enjoyed a loan spell with Sheffield United, without ever making a league appearance for the "Red Devils". He signed with Port Vale in July 2000, moving on to non-league Leigh RMI a year later. In 2002 he transferred to Chester City, joining Morecambe two years later. He won promotion into the Football League with both clubs, helping Chester to the Conference title in 2003–04 and playing for the "Shrimps" in their play-off final success in 2007. After six years with Morecambe, he moved on to Altrincham via Stalybridge Celtic in 2010.

==Playing career==

===Manchester United===

Born in Salford, Greater Manchester, Twiss began his career as a trainee at Manchester United, but despite being a regular in the reserve team from 1997 to 2000, failed to make the grade at the club. On 25 February 1998, he made his debut for the first team, coming on as a 79th minute substitute in the 3-2 defeat to Barnsley in the FA Cup fifth round replay at Oakwell.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-united-shattered-by-jones-double-1147074.html |title=United shattered by Jones double |date=25 February 1998 |work=Independent.co.uk |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=25 October 2013[/tpl] Twiss made his first start for United on 13 October 1999, playing 73 minutes in the 3-0 defeat at Aston Villa in the League Cup third round, before being replaced by Richie Wellens.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/villa-make-merry-with-uniteds-fledglings-742289.html |title=Villa make merry with United's fledglings |date=13 October 1999 |work=Independent.co.uk |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=25 October 2013[/tpl] This turned out to be his last appearance for the club and he was released at the end of the 1999-2000 season.

====Sheffield United (loan)====

He spent most of the 1998–99 season on loan with Sheffield United in the First Division. His first senior goal came on 28 December, scoring a late winner over Huddersfield Town in a 2–1 victory at Bramall Lane. He returned to Old Trafford in March 1999, having only started four games for the "Blades", coming on as a substitute thirteen times.

===Port Vale===

In July 2000 he signed a one-month deal with Brian Horton's Port Vale,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/850891.stm|title=Horton takes Twiss|date=25 July 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=7 July 2009[/tpl] after impressing on trial.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/port_vale/820952.stm|title=Trialist at Vale Park|date=25 July 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=7 July 2009[/tpl] A regular at the start of the 2000–01 season, he fell out of favour in October.

===Leigh RMI===

He joined Football Conference club Leigh RMI in time for the start of the 2000–01 season. There, Twiss found himself at a more comfortable level and had a successful season at the club, scoring 15 goals in 34 games, becoming the club's top scorer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leigh_rmi/1958026.stm|title=Kielty boost for Leigh|last=Oliver|first=Pete|date=29 April 2002|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=7 July 2009[/tpl]
