Ruby Beach is the northernmost of the southern beaches in the coastal section of Olympic National Park in the U.S. state of Washington. It is located on Highway 101, in Jefferson County, [tpl]convert|27|mi[/tpl] south of the town of Forks.
Like virtually all beaches on the northern coast, Ruby Beach has a tremendous amount of driftwood.  It is notable for the number of sea stacks there.
The beach is so called, because of the ruby like crystals that get washed to the beach from the fresh water leaching onto the beach. These crystals are the by product of the
glacier activity that used to happen in this area. (Source: ranger station)
