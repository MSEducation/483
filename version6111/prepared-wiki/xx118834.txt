Hubert "Sonny" Hine (January 9, 1931 â€“ March 17, 2000) was an American Hall of Fame Thoroughbred horse trainer best known as the trainer of 1998 U.S. Horse of the Year, Skip Away.

==Early life==

Hine was born in The Bronx, New York, the son of clothing merchant and trainer Arthur Hine. Predating his training career in horse racing he often rode match races with his brother, Marvin. His training career began after high school upon hitchhiking to Charles Town and training Miss Economy at Marlboro Race Course.
Before becoming a trainer, Sonny joined the United States Air Force and attended Yale University for a year. While enrolled in a pre-veterinary course at Pennsylvania State University he was contacted by the United States Department of State to become a special investigator in Hong Kong, allowing him to become fluent in Mandarin Chinese.

Sonny Hine became a full-time trainer in 1957, struggling upward with horses such as Amber Pass, Bet Big, Cojak, Guilty Conscience, Norquestor, Royal Hierarchy, Skip Trial and Technology, securing himself at venues such as the Monmouth Park and Meadowlands Racetracks.
With Skip Away, Sonny Hine won the 1997 Breeders' Cup Classic at Hollywood Park Racetrack. Raced under his wife Carolyn's name, she would receive the 1997 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Owner. In 1998, Skip Away logged victories in the Donn Handicap, the Gulfstream Park Handicap, the Pimlico Special, the Massachusetts Handicap, the Hollywood Gold Cup, the Philip H. Iselin Stakes and the Woodward Stakes. He finished the year by winning the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year.
