CATEGORIES: Ericales families, Ericaceae

The Ericaceae are a family, commonly known as the heath or heather family, of flowering plants found most commonly in acid and infertile growing conditions. The family is large, with roughly 4000 species spread across 126 genera, making it the 14th-most-speciose family of flowering plants.Stevens, P. F. (2001 onwards). Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. Version 9, June 2008. http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/ The many well-known and economically important members of the Ericaceae include the cranberry, blueberry, huckleberry, azalea, rhododendron, and various common heaths and heathers (Erica, Cassiope, Daboecia, and Calluna for example).[tpl]cite journal | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/89/2/327  | title = Phylogenetic relationships within the blueberry tribe (Vaccinieae, Ericaceae) based on sequence data from MATK and nuclear ribosomal ITS regions, with comments on the placement of Satyria | author = Kathleen A.

==Description==

The Ericaceae contain a morphologically diverse range of taxa, including herbs, dwarf shrubs, shrubs, and trees.  Their leaves are usually alternate or whorled, simple and without stipules, and hermaphrodite flowers.  The flowers show considerable variability.  The petals are often fused (sympetalous) with shapes ranging from narrowly tubular to funnelform or widely bowl-shaped.  The corollas are usually radially symmetrical (actinomorphic), but many flowers of the genus Rhododendron are somewhat bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic).Watson, L., Dallwitz, M.J.

==Distribution and ecology==

Ericads have a nearly worldwide distribution. They are absent from continental Antarctica, parts of the high Arctic, central Greenland, northern and central Australia, and much of the lowland tropics and neotropics.
The family is largely composed of plants that can tolerate acidic, infertile conditions.  Like other stress-tolerant plants, many Ericaceae have mycorrhizal fungi to assist with extracting nutrients from infertile soils, as well as evergreen foliage to conserve absorbed nutrients.Keddy, P.A.  2007. Plants and Vegetation: Origins, Processes, Consequences. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 666 p. This trait is not found in the Clethraceae and Cyrillaceae, the two families most closely related to the Ericaceae. Most Ericaceae (excluding the Monotropoideae, Pyroloideae, and some Styphelioideae) form a distinctive mycorrhizae, where fungi grow in and around the roots and provide the plant with nutrients.[tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1046/j.1351-0754.2003.0555.x | author = Cairney, JWG & Meharg, AA | year = 2003 | title = Ericoid mycorrhiza: a partnership that exploits harsh edaphic conditions | url = | journal = European Journal of Soil Science | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 735–740 [/tpl] The Pyroleae tribe are mixotrophic and gain sugars from the mycorrhizae, as well as nutrients.[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/s10265-010-0376-8[/tpl]
In many parts of the world, a "heath" or "heathland" is an environment characterised by an open dwarf-shrub community found on low-quality acidic soils, generally dominated by plants in the Ericaceae. A common example is Erica tetralix. This plant family is also typical of peat bogs and blanket bogs; examples include Rhododendron groenlandicum and Kalmia polifolia. In eastern North America, members of this family often grow in association with an oak canopy, in a habitat known as an oak-heath forest.The Natural Communities of Virginia Classification of Ecological Community Groups (Version 2.3), Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, 2010Schafale, M.

Some evidence suggests eutrophic rainwater can convert ericoid heaths with species such as Erica tetralix to grasslands.Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p. p.103-104. Nitrogen is particularly suspect in this regard, and may be causing measurable changes to the distribution and abundance of some ericaceous species.

==Systematics==

In 2002, systematic research[tpl]cite journal  | title = Phylogenetic Classification of Ericaceae: Molecular and Morphological Evidence | author = Kron, K.A., Judd, W.S., Stevens, P.F., Crayn, D.M., Anderberg, A.A., Gadek, P.A., Quinn, C.J., Luteyn, J.L. | journal = The Botanical Review | year = 2002 | volume = 68 | pages = 335–423 | issue=3 | doi=10.1663/0006-8101(2002)0680335:pcoema2.0.co;2[/tpl] resulted in the inclusion of the formerly recognised families Empetraceae, Epacridaceae, Monotropaceae, Prionotaceae, and Pyrolaceae into the Ericaceae based on a combination of molecular, morphological, anatomical, and embryological data, analysed within a phylogenetic framework.  The move significantly increased the morphological and geographical range found within the group.  The resulting family now includes 9 subfamilies, 126 genera, and about 4000 species:

==Etymology==

The name Ericaceae comes from the type genus Erica, which appears to be derived from the Greek word ereike. The exact meaning is difficult to interpret, but some sources show it as meaning 'heather'.Wiktionary. 2011. Ericaceae. http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ericaceae  The name may have been used informally to refer to the plants in pre-Linnaean times, and was simply formalised when Linnaeus described Erica in 1753, and then when Jussieu described the Ericaceae in 1789.Jussieu, A.-L. de. 1789. Genera plantarum ordines naturales disposita. pg. 159-160. Herissant & Barrois, Paris.

==Use in alternative medicine==

Heather has been listed as one of the 38 plants used to prepare Bach flower remedies,[tpl]cite book|author=D. S. Vohra|title=Bach Flower Remedies: A Comprehensive Study|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=icG8onA0ys8C&pg=PR3|accessdate=2 September 2013|date=1 June 2004|publisher=B. Jain Publishers|isbn=978-81-7021-271-3|page=3[/tpl] a kind of alternative medicine promoted for its effect on health. However, according to Cancer Research UK, "there is no scientific evidence to prove that flower remedies can control, cure, or prevent any type of disease, including cancer".
