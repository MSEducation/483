==Music video==

Goodrem claimed on radio that the music video would be of Behind The Scenes footage most likely from the intimate concert, 'A Night With Delta Goodrem'. The music video debuted on Sunrise on 17 July 2008[tpl]YouTube|SQkpUc5cgl4|I Can't Break It To My Heart video[/tpl] and features various behind the scenes clips of Goodrem from the past few months, including photo shoots for the Australian release of Delta, travelling around Japan and the USA, and many candid moments which, as her official site explains, "captures Delta out of the limelight as her natural, gorgeous self". These are all intertwined with a performance of "I Can't Break It to My Heart" from her special A Night with Delta Goodrem.

==Performance and production==

Both the CD single and the iTunes EP went on sale on Saturday 16 August. The single received heavy promotion (a marked change from the previous single) in the form of three instore performances and signings, and appearances on morning programme Sunrise and interview programme Rove Live. The instore promotion appeared in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. In an out-of-the-ordinary move, the CD single was made available for only $1.99, and the iTunes EP (containing four songs) was sold for $1.69.
