]]
The Tar River suffered the worst flooding, exceeding 500-year flood levels along its lower stretches; it crested [tpl]convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] above flood stage. Flooding began in Rocky Mount, as much as 30% of which was underwater for several days. In Tarboro, much of the downtown was under several feet of water.[tpl]cite web|title=Flooding in Tarboro and Princeville|publisher=Daniel Design Associates|url=http://www.danieldesign.com/tarboro.htm|accessdate=October 4, 2008[/tpl] Nearby, the town of Princeville was largely destroyed when the waters of the Tar poured over the town's levee, covering the town with over [tpl]convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] of floodwater for ten days.[tpl]cite web|title=The History of Princeville|publisher=Town Of Princeville, North Carolina|url=http://www.townofprincevillenc.com/history.html|accessdate = March 11, 2006 (BROKEN)[/tpl] Further downstream, Greenville suffered very heavy flooding; damages in Pitt County alone were estimated at $1.6 billion (1999 USD, $1.87 billion 2006 USD). Washington, where the peak flood level was observed, was likewise devastated. Some residents in Greenville had to swim six feet underwater to reach the front doors of their homes and apartments.[tpl]cite web|publisher=NASA|title=Landsat Views North Carolina Flood|url=http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=137|accessdate=October 4, 2008[/tpl] Due to the heavy flooding in downtown Greenville, the East Carolina Pirates were forced to relocate their football game against #9 Miami to N.C. State's Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh, where they beat the Hurricanes 27-23.
The Neuse River, Roanoke River, Waccamaw River, and New River exceeded 500-year flood levels, although damage was lower in these areas (compared to the Tar River) because of lower population densities. Because most of the Cape Fear River basin was west of the peak rainfall areas, the city of Wilmington was spared the worst flooding despite having the highest localized rainfall; however, the Northeast Cape Fear River (a tributary) did exceed 500-year flood levels. Of the state's eastern rivers, only the Lumber River escaped catastrophic flooding.[tpl]cite web|author=Bales, Jerad D. ; Oblinger, Carolyn J. ; and Sallenger H.

Rainfall and strong winds affected many homes across the state, destroying 7,000, leaving 17,000 uninhabitable, and damaging 56,000. Ten thousand people resided in temporary shelters following the storm. The extensive flooding resulted in significant crop damage. As quoted by North Carolina Secretary of Health and Human Services H. David Bruton, "Nothing since the Civil War has been as destructive to families here. The recovery process will be much longer than the water-going-down process." Around 31,000 jobs were lost from over 60,000 businesses through the storm, causing nearly $4 billion (1999 USD, $4.7 billion 2006 USD) in lost business revenue.[tpl]cite web|author=Unknown|title=Summary|work=North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Hurricane Floyd and 10-Year Disaster Assistance Report|publisher=FEMA|accessdate=October 4, 2008|url=http://www.ncfloodmaps.com/pubdocs/historicdata.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080815160405/http://www.ncfloodmaps.com/pubdocs/historicdata.htm |archivedate=August 15, 2008[/tpl] In much of the affected area, officials urged people to either boil water or buy bottled water during Floyd's aftermath.[tpl]cite web|author=CNN|year=1999|title=Waters rise, fall across eastern North Carolina|publisher=CNN|accessdate=October 4, 2008|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/WEATHER/9909/22/floyd.01/[/tpl]
In contrast to the problems eastern North Carolina experienced, much of the western portion of the state remained under a severe drought.
 

===Virginia===

As in North Carolina, Floyd produced torrential rainfall in the most eastern portions of Virginia, amounting to a peak of [tpl]convert|16.57|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] in Newport News. The rainfall led to overflowing rivers in the Chowan River Basin, some of which exceeded 500-year flood levels. The Blackwater River reached 100-year flood levels and flooded Franklin with [tpl]convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] of water. Extensive road damage occurred there, isolating the area from the rest of the state. Some 182 businesses and 150 houses were underwater in Franklin from the worst flooding in 60 years. In addition, two dams along the Rappahannock River burst from the extreme flooding. Throughout all of Virginia, Floyd damaged 9,250 houses, killed three people, and caused $101 million in damage (1999 USD; $[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|101000000|1999[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]#time:Y[/tpl] USD).[tpl]cite web|author=Roth, David & Cobb, Hugh|title=Virginia Hurricane History|publisher=HPC/NOAA|accessdate =October 4, 2008|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/roth/vahur.htm[/tpl]

===Mid-Atlantic===

By the time Floyd hit the shore, it was significantly weaker than it was at sea, due to the collapsing of its concentric eyes. This had little effect on the inland damage caused by the storm, however, and Floyd produced torrential rains and high winds throughout the Mid-Atlantic as far north as New York City and Long Island.
Chestertown, Maryland, reported a maximum rainfall total of [tpl]convert|14|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl], with other locales reporting similar values. Extreme river flooding caused moderate damage to bridges and roads, resulting in a damage toll of $7.9 million (1999 USD; $[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|7900000|1999[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]#time:Y[/tpl] USD) throughout the state. In addition, over 250,000 residents were without electricity because of high winds blowing down power lines.
Rainfall amounts peaked at [tpl]convert|13.34|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] in Somerville, New Jersey, and [tpl]convert|12.36|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] in Vernon, Delaware. The Raritan River basin experienced record flooding as a result of Floyd's heavy rains, [tpl]convert|4.5|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] higher than the previous record flood crest.[tpl]cite web| title = Bound Brook Flood Analysis| author =  Melanie Chu, Melissa Hagerman, Aleek Datta| publisher = Rutgers| accessdate = October 4, 2008| url = http://geography.rutgers.edu/scrapbook/projects/raritan_flood/studentprojects/mma/floodanalysis.html[/tpl]
Bound Brook, New Jersey, and neighboring South Bound Brook, were especially hard hit by a record flooding event: a [tpl]convert|42|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=3[/tpl] flood crest,[tpl]cite web|title=Hurricane Floyd Passes over Avalon, New Jersey|year=1999|publisher=New Jersey Coastal Monitoring Network|accessdate=October 4, 2008|url=http://cmn.dl.stevens-tech.edu/floyd/[/tpl] [tpl]convert|14|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] above flood stage, sent [tpl]convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] of water on Main Street and drowned three people.[tpl]cite web| title = Raritan River Crests| publisher = NOAA| accessdate = October 4, 2008| url = http://newweb.erh.noaa.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=phi&gage=bdkn4&view=1,1,1,1,1,1[/tpl]
Manville, New Jersey was hit nearly as hard, with record-breaking floods coming from the Raritan River and the nearby Millstone River, which join in Manville. Manville's flooding was also exacerbated by the Delaware-Raritan Canal, a section of which runs parallel to the Millstone River and, for a stretch, are only separated by several feet (a runner's path). Princeton University in Princeton, NJ, for several days declared municipal tap water unsafe to drink, advised students in dorms not to shower, and provided bottled drinking water.
The Rochelle Park, New Jersey hub of Electronic Data Systems was inundated by the nearby Saddle River, disrupting service to as many as 8,000 ATMs across the United States.[tpl]cite news| title =  Flood Disrupts Bank Machines Across Country| newspaper = New York Times| accessdate = December 14, 2008| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E6DD1E3CF933A1575AC0A96F958260| first=Andy| last=Newman| date=September 20, 1999[/tpl]  Flooding in an adjoining Bell Atlantic switching facility cut off phone service to one million customers in the area.[tpl]cite news| title = No Solace in the New Week as the Storm's Legacies Linger| newspaper = New York Times| accessdate = December 14, 2008| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E3DB1F3CF932A1575AC0A96F958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all| first=David W.| last=Chen| date=September 21, 1999[/tpl]
250px|thumb|left|Floyd's rain affecting the Mid-Atlantic.Still a large tropical cyclone when it hit the Mid Atlantic states, Floyd produced a strong storm surge, peaking at [tpl]convert|2.8|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] with a storm tide of [tpl]convert|9.34|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] in Philadelphia with effects felt in parts of northern Pennsylvania including the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton metro area. Some 1,260,000 citizens across the three states lost power because of the storm, and flooding left many in Pennsylvania homeless. In New York, over 10 inches of rain triggered mudslides on the bluffs overlooking the Hudson River near the Tappan Zee Bridge.

===New England===

Floyd caused large power outages and flood damage across New England, with over [tpl]convert|5|in|mm|spell=in[/tpl] of rain being dropped over most of the area. Danbury, Connecticut received up to [tpl]convert|15|in|mm[/tpl] of rain from the storm, resulting in extensive flooding in the city and surrounding areas. Mudslides were reported in the Berkshire Mountains of western Massachusetts. Several major highways and a countless number of local roads in Connecticut and Massachusetts were closed for several days due to flooding, and downed trees and power lines. Because New England had been in a severe drought leading up to Floyd, the storm's floodwaters quickly receded.  East of Floyd's center, large trees were uprooted by the storm's 70 mph winds, causing widespread power outages and minor structural damage.[tpl]cite web|author=|title=Massachusetts Event Record Details: Strong Wind|date=|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=February 11, 2010|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~359970[/tpl]

===Canada===

The remnants of Floyd continued into Canada entering the Canadian Hurricane Centre's area of responsibility on the evening and regional offices in Quebec and Atlantic Canada on September 16. Floyd became an extratropical low pressure system gradually losing strength and accelerating in the upper flow. In general, winds were below [tpl]convert|90|km/h|mph[/tpl] over Canada. However, near Quebec City (Quebec province), the weather station on île d'Orléans recorded gusts up to [tpl]convert|119|km/h|mph[/tpl],[tpl]Cite web| author=Meteorological Service of Canada| title=  Ile d'Orleans, Quebec, Hourly Wind Speed for September 17, 1999| work= Climatological archives| publisher= Environment Canada| accessdate= August 27, 2011| url = http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climateData/generate_chart_e.html?timeframe=1&Prov=XX&StationID=8989&Year=1999&Month=9&Day=17&Type=line&MeasTypeID=windspd[/tpl][ref]Île d'Orléans (WER) METAR gives wind of [tpl]convert|45|knot|km/h[/tpl] with gust of [tpl]convert|64|knot|km/h[/tpl]

==Aftermath==

===Criticism of FEMA===

The Hurricane Floyd disaster was followed by what many judged to be a very slow federal response. Fully three weeks after the storm hit, Jesse Jackson complained to FEMA Director James Lee Witt on his CNN program Both Sides Now, "It seemed there was preparation for Hurricane Floyd, but then came Flood Floyd. Bridges are overwhelmed, levees are overwhelmed, whole towns under water ... it's an awesome scene of tragedy. So there's a great misery index in North Carolina." Witt responded, "We're starting to move the camper trailers in. It's been so wet it's been difficult to get things in there, but now it's going to be moving very quickly. And I think you're going to see a—I think the people there will see a big difference within this next weekend!"[tpl]cite news| author = Carl Limbacher et al.| title = 1999 Hurricane Swamped Clinton's FEMA| publisher = NewsMax| date = September 7, 2005| accessdate = October 4, 2008| url = http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/9/7/134914.shtml[/tpl]

===Ecological effects===

Runoff from the hurricane created significant problems for the ecology of North Carolina's rivers and sounds.
In the immediate aftermath of the storm, freshwater runoff, sediment, and decomposing organic matter caused salinity and oxygen levels in Pamlico Sound and its tributary rivers to drop to nearly zero. This raised fears of massive fish and shrimp kills, as had happened after Hurricane Fran and Hurricane Bonnie, and the state government responded quickly to provide financial aid to fishing and shrimping industries. Strangely, however, the year's shrimp and crab harvests were extremely prosperous; one possible explanation is that runoff from Hurricane Dennis caused marine animals to begin migrating to saltier waters, so they were less vulnerable to Floyd's ill effects.
Pollution from runoff was also a significant fear. Numerous pesticides were found in low but measurable quantities in the river waters, particularly in the Neuse River. Overall, however, the concentration of contaminants was slightly lower than had been measured in Hurricane Fran, likely because Floyd simply dropped more water to dilute them.

===Hog Waste Water Contamination===

When the hurricane hit North Carolina, it flooded hog waste lagoons and released 25 million gallons of manure into the New River, which contaminated the water supply and cause widespread death of aquatic life.[tpl]cite web|title=Hog Farming|url=https://web.duke.edu/mms190/hogfarming/|publisher=Duke University[/tpl] Ronnie Kennedy, county director for environmental health, said that of 310 private wells he had tested for contamination since the storm, 9 percent, or three times the average across eastern North Carolina, had fecal coliform bacteria. Normally, tests showing any hint of feces in drinking water, an indication that it can be carrying disease-causing pathogens, are cause for immediate action.[tpl]cite web|last=Kilborn|first=Peter|title=Hurricane Reveals Flaws in Farm Law|url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/national/101799floyd-environment.html|publisher=NY Times[/tpl]

===Retirement===

Because of the hurricane's destruction in North Carolina and elsewhere in the United States, the name Floyd was retired by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2000, and it will never again be used for another future Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced with Franklin in the 2005 season, which was not retired that season.
