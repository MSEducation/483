==Early life==

The 1940 Census lists him as having been born in Seattle.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]  His father owned and operated an import-export company, and because of business obligations, the family relocated often. Nash was descended from the brother of General Francis Nash, who gave his name to Nashville, Tennessee.Adventures Of Isabel, by Ogden Nash - Classic Famous Poet - All Poetry.
Throughout his life, Nash loved to rhyme.  "I think in terms of rhyme, and have since I was six years old," he stated in a 1958 news interview.[tpl]Cite news|author=Hal Boyle|title=Ogden Nash Finds Light Verse Doesn't Flow Easy|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zu0KAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3U8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6654,1365475|format=Reprint|agency=Associated Press|work=Prescott Evening Courier|date=1958-12-01|accessdate=2008-10-19[/tpl]  He had a fondness for crafting his own words whenever rhyming words did not exist, though admitting that crafting rhymes was not always the easiest task.
His family lived briefly in Savannah, GA in a carriage house owned by Juliette Gordon Low, founder of the Girl Scouts of the USA; he wrote a poem about Mrs. Low's House.  After graduating from St. George's School in Newport County, Rhode Island, Nash entered Harvard University in 1920, only to drop out a year later.
He returned as a teacher to St. George's for one year before returning to New York.[tpl]cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Louis|title=Reviewed work(s): Ogden Nash: The Life and Work of America's Laureate of Light Verse by Douglas M.

However, I saw lots of good movies." Nash then took a position as a writer of the streetcar card ads for Barron Collier, a company that previously had employed another Baltimore resident, F. Scott Fitzgerald. He spent three months in 1931 working on the editorial staff for The New Yorker.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hasley|first=Louis|title=The Golden Trashery of Ogden Nashery|journal=The Arizona Quarterly|year=1971|volume=27|issue=3|page=242[/tpl]
In 1931 he married Frances Leonard."Ogden Nash." The Baltimore Literary Heritage Project He published his first collection of poems, Hard Lines, that same year, earning him national recognition. Some of his poems reflected an anti-establishment feeling. For example, one verse, titled Common Sense, asks:
In 1934, Nash moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where he remained until his death in 1971. Nash thought of Baltimore as home. After his return from a brief move to New York, he wrote "I could have loved New York had I not loved Balti-more."

==Writing career==

When Nash wasn't writing poems, he made guest appearances on comedy and radio shows and toured the United States and the United Kingdom, giving lectures at colleges and universities.
Nash was regarded respectfully by the literary establishment, and his poems were frequently anthologized even in serious collections such as Selden Rodman's 1946 A New Anthology of Modern Poetry.
Nash was the lyricist for the Broadway musical One Touch of Venus, collaborating with librettist S. J. Perelman and composer Kurt Weill. The show included the notable song "Speak Low". He also wrote the lyrics for the 1952 revue Two's Company.
Nash and his love of the Baltimore Colts were featured in the December 13, 1968 issue of Life,[tpl]Cite journal| last =Nash | first =Ogden | date =1968-12-13 | title =My Colts, verses and reverses | journal =Life | volume = | issue = | pages = | id = | url =http://www.life.com/Life/cover_search/view?coverkeyword=&startMonth=12&startYear=1968&endMonth=12&endYear=1968&pageNumber=1&indexNumber=1 | accessdate = 2008-05-29 | format = – Scholar search [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] with several poems about the American football team matched to full-page pictures. Entitled "My Colts, verses and reverses", the issue includes his poems and photographs by Arthur Rickerby.  "Mr. Nash, the league leading writer of light verse (Averaging better than 6.3 lines per carry), lives in Baltimore and loves the Colts", it declares. The comments further describe Nash as "a fanatic of the Baltimore Colts, and a gentleman".  Featured on the magazine cover is defensive player Dennis Gaubatz, number 53, in midair pursuit with this description:  "That is he, looming 10 feet tall or taller above the Steelers' signal caller...Since Gaubatz acts like this on Sunday, I'll do my quarterbacking Monday." Memorable Colts Jimmy Orr, Billy Ray Smith, Bubba Smith, Willie Richardson, Dick Szymanski and Lou Michaels contribute to the poetry.
Among his most popular writings were a series of animal verses, many of which featured his off-kilter rhyming devices. Examples include "If called by a panther / Don't anther"; "Who wants my jellyfish? / I'm not sellyfish!".

==Death and subsequent events==

Nash died at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital on May 19, 1971, from Crohn's disease aggravated by a lactobacillus infection transmitted by improperly prepared coleslaw. He is interred in East Side Cemetery in North Hampton, New Hampshire.
A biography, Ogden Nash: the Life and Work of America's Laureate of Light Verse, was written by Douglas M. Parker, published in 2005 and in paperback in 2007. The book was written with the cooperation of the Nash family, and quotes extensively from Nash's personal correspondence as well as his poetry.
His daughter Isabel was married to noted photographer Fred Eberstadt, and his granddaughter, Fernanda Eberstadt, is an acclaimed author. Nash had one other daughter, Linell Nash Smith.

==Poetic style==

Nash was best known for surprising, pun-like rhymes, sometimes with words deliberately misspelled for comic effect, as in his retort to Dorothy Parker's humorous dictum, Men seldom make passes/At girls who wear glasses:
He often wrote in an exaggerated verse form with pairs of lines that rhyme, but are of dissimilar length and irregular meter:
Nash's poetry was often a playful twist of an old saying or poem. For one example, he expressed this playfulness in what is perhaps his most famous rhyme, a twist on Joyce Kilmer's poem "Trees" (1913): "I think that I shall never see / a poem lovely as a tree", which drops "billboard" in place of poem and adds, "Indeed, unless the billboards fall / I'll never see a tree at all."Nash, Ogden, "Song of the Open Road, The Face Is Familiar (Garden City Publishing, 1941), p. 21. That same playfulness produced a number of often quoted quips, including "Progress might have been all right once, but it has gone on too long" and "People who work sitting down get paid more than people who work standing up."

==Other poems==

Nash was a baseball fan, and he wrote a poem titled "Line-Up for Yesterday", an alphabetical poem listing baseball immortals.[tpl]Cite news|author=Tim Wiles|title=Who's on Verse?|work=The New York Times|date=1996-03-31|url=http://www.nytimes.com/specials/baseball/bbo-baseball-preview-poetry.html |accessdate=2008-01-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20001217013500/http://www.nytimes.com/specials/baseball/bbo-baseball-preview-poetry.html |archivedate = December 17, 2000[/tpl] Published in Sport magazine in January 1949, the poem pays tribute to the baseball greats and to his own fanaticism, in alphabetical order. Here is a sampling from his A to Z list:[tpl]Cite web|title=Baseball Almanac|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_line.shtml|accessdate=2008-01-23 [/tpl]
He also wrote a poem called "more about people" which criticises employers who ill treat others.
Nash particularly loved Baltimore sports teams.
Nash wrote humorous poems for each movement of the Camille Saint-Saëns orchestral suite The Carnival of the Animals, which are sometimes recited when the work is performed. The original recording of this version was made by Columbia Records in the 1940s, with Noël Coward reciting the poems and Andre Kostelanetz conducting the orchestra.
Many of his poems, reflecting the times in which they were written, presented stereotypes of different nationalities. For example in Genealogical Reflections he writes:
In The Japanese published in 1938, Nash presents an allegory for the expansionist policies of the Empire of Japan:
