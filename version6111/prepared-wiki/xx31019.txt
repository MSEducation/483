The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (often shortened to Ziggy Stardust) is a 1972 concept album by English musician David Bowie, which is loosely based on a story of a fictional rock star named Ziggy Stardust.[tpl]cite web |last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from-mars-mw0000626129 |title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars - David Bowie : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=1 June 1974 |accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl] It peaked at No. 5 in the UK[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.everyhit.com |title=UK Top 40 Hit Database |accessdate=18 May 2008[/tpl] and No. 75 in the US on the Billboard Music Charts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from-mars-mw0000626129/awards |title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars - David Bowie : Awards |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl]
The album tells the story of Bowie's alter-ego Ziggy Stardust, a rock star who acts as a messenger for extraterrestrial beings. Bowie created Ziggy Stardust while in New York City promoting Hunky Dory and performed as him on a tour of the UK, Japan and North America.David Bowie and the Rise of Ziggy Stardust, BBC 4 documentary The album, and the character of Ziggy Stardust, was known for its glam rock influences and themes of sexual exploration and social commentary. These factors, coupled with the ambiguity surrounding Bowie's sexuality and fuelled by a ground-breaking performance of "Starman" on Top of the Pops,http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/art-rock/bowie-performs-starman-on-top-of-the-pops/ led to the album being met with controversy and since hailed as a seminal work.http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/44814/David-Bowie-The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Ziggy-Stardust.../
The concept album is about a bisexual alien rock superstar, and includes use of a series of atonal and rhythmically irregular tape effects. The concept album sheds a light on the artificiality of rock in general, including issues of politics, drug use, and sexual orientation.McLeod, Ken.

The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars has been consistently considered one of the greatest albums of all time, with Rolling Stone magazine ranking it the 35th greatest ever.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from-mars-20120524 |title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time: David Bowie, 'The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars' |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl] It was ranked the 20th greatest album ever in a 1997 British survey, the 24th greatest of all time by Q magazine and one of the 100 greatest releases ever by Time magazine. A concert film of the same name, directed by D.A. Pennebaker, was released in 1973.

==Concept==

The album presents, albeit vaguely, the story of a rock and roll character called "Ziggy Stardust".[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=ziggy-stardust-r2473/review|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Ziggy Stardust – David Bowie |publisher=allmusic.com |accessdate=5 November 2010[/tpl] Ziggy is the human manifestation of an alien being who is attempting to present humanity with a message of hope in the last five years of its existence. Ziggy Stardust represents the definitive rock star: sexually promiscuous, wild in drug intake but with a message, ultimately, of peace and love. He is destroyed both by his own consumptions, and by the fans he inspired.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
The character of Ziggy was inspired by British rock 'n' roll singer Vince Taylor whom David Bowie met after Taylor had had a breakdown and believed himself to be a cross between a god and an alien;[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tdpz8 |title=BBC – BBC Radio 4 Programmes – Ziggy Stardust Came from Isleworth |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=5 November 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.davidbowie.com/users/spaceface/vincetaylor.html |title=The Leper Messiah : Vince Taylor |publisher=davidbowie.com |accessdate=5 November 2010[/tpl] though Taylor was only part of the blueprint for the character,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/aug/20/vincent-taylor-ziggy-stardust-radio-review |title=Ziggy Stardust Came from Isleworth – review |publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate=5 November 2010 |location=London |first=Elisabeth |last=Mahoney |date=20 August 2010[/tpl] other influences included the Legendary Stardust Cowboy[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=chj91X0dWzUC&pg=PA488&dq=ziggy+stardust+vince+taylor#v=onepage&q=ziggy%20stardust%20vince%20taylor&f=false |title=Icons of Rock |author=Scott Schinder, Andy Schwartz |page=448 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2008 |ISBN=0-313-33846-9 |accessdate=5 November 2010[/tpl] and Kansai Yamamoto, who designed the costumes Bowie wore during the tour.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6rA75-Qp4msC&pg=PA111&dq=kansai+yamamoto+ziggy+stardust#v=onepage&q=kansai%20yamamoto%20ziggy%20stardust&f=false |title=The aesthetics of self-invention: Oscar Wilde to David Bowie |author=Shelton Waldrep |pages=111–112 |publisher=U of Minnesota Press |year=2004 |ISBN=0-8166-3418-1 |accessdate=5 November 2010[/tpl] The Ziggy Stardust name came partly from the Legendary Stardust Cowboy, and partly, as Bowie told Rolling Stone, because Ziggy was "one of the few Christian names I could find beginning with the letter 'Z'".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.album-review.co.uk/artists/news/1925 |title=the album review site: La Roux Gets Sidetracked |publisher=album-review.co.uk |accessdate=5 November 2010[/tpl] He later explained in a 1990 interview for Q magazine that the Ziggy part came from a tailor's shop called Ziggy's that he passed on a train, and he liked it because it had "that Iggy Pop connotation but it was a tailor's shop, and I thought, Well, this whole thing is gonna be about clothes, so it was my own little joke calling him Ziggy.

Bowie covered a Legendary Stardust Cowboy song, "I Took a Trip (On a Gemini Spaceship)" thirty years later on Heathen.

==Production==

The Ziggy Stardust sessions began just a few weeks after Hunky Dory was released. The first song recorded at Trident Studios for the album, the cover "It Ain't Easy", was recorded in September 1971. The first session in November produced "Hang on to Yourself", "Ziggy Stardust", "Rock 'n' Roll Star" (later shortened to "Star"), "Moonage Daydream", "Soul Love", "Lady Stardust", and "Five Years".
Also recorded during the November Ziggy Sessions were two more cover songs intended for the as-yet untitled album. They were Chuck Berry's "Around and Around" (re-titled "Round and Round") and Jacques Brel's "Amsterdam" (re-titled "Port of Amsterdam"). A re-recording of "Holy Holy" (first recorded in 1970 and released as a single, to poor sales, in January 1971) was initially slated for Ziggy, but was dropped in favour of "Rock 'n' Roll Suicide". "Round and Round" was replaced by "Starman" and "It Ain't Easy" replaced "Amsterdam" on the album's final running order. All three were eventually released as b-sides.
"Velvet Goldmine", first recorded during the Hunky Dory sessions, was also intended for Ziggy, but was replaced by "Suffragette City".  RCA released it in 1975 as the B-side to the UK re-release of "Space Oddity" after having it remixed and mastered without Bowie's approval.
After recording some of the new songs for Sounds of the 70s with Bob Harris (which appear on Bowie at the Beeb) as the newly dubbed Spiders from Mars in January – February 1972, the band returned to Trident. They recorded "Starman", "Suffragette City" and "Rock 'n' Roll Suicide" by the end of the month.
"Starman", released as a single in April (and not intended for the final album at first), has never appeared in its original "loud" mix on CD. It differs somewhat in that it "features a subdued 'morse code' section between the verse and the chorus"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stevehoffman.tv/forums/showthread.php?t=106219 |title=Starman – David Bowie. Original UK LP and 45 mix is AWOL!! |accessdate=23 March 2008[/tpl] compared to the original released in 1972. "Suffragette City", the b-side to "Starman", was mastered for the album with a three-note coda leading in from "Ziggy Stardust" to make the songs sound linked. They were never played as such by Bowie in concert.
Recorded and released during the ensuing Ziggy tour were two other songs. The first, "John, I'm Only Dancing", was recorded at Trident in late June and released (in the UK only) in September. "The Jean Genie", recorded at RCA Studios in New York in early October at the start of the American tour, was released in the US in November. The song was remixed for Aladdin Sane.
Rock keyboardist Rick Wakeman was given the opportunity to play keyboards on the album but opted to join the progressive rock group Yes instead.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Ziggy Stardust story==

The album was intended by Bowie to serve as the soundtrack and musical basis for a stage show and/or television production telling the story of Ziggy Stardust.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] As well as the songs on the album, Bowie also intended songs such as "All the Young Dudes", "Rebel Rebel" and "Rock 'n' Roll With Me" (the latter two later recorded for Diamond Dogs) for this realisation of the Ziggy story.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
In a Rolling Stone interview with William S. Burroughs, Bowie expanded on the Ziggy Stardust story:

==Release==

Upon its release on 6 June 1972, Ziggy Stardust reached No. 5 in the UK and No. 75 in the US. It was eventually certified platinum and gold in the UK and US respectively.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php |title=RIAA Gold and Platinum |accessdate=18 May 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/ |title=BPI Certified Awards |accessdate=18 May 2008[/tpl] The only single from the record, "Starman", charted at No. 10 in the UK while peaking at No. 65 in the US. The album would go on to sell an estimated 7.5 million copies worldwide, making it Bowie's second-best-selling album.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/graphic/2012/jan/07/infomania-david-bowie |title=David Bowie: Infomania|last=Dee|first=Johnny|work=The Guardian|date=7 January 2012|accessdate=14 June 2013[/tpl]
In the issue of Rolling Stone from 20 July 1972, writer Richard Cromelin gave the album a favourable review of "at least a 99" (assumed out of 100); the review was written in a way that even though he thought it was a good album, he did not believe in the lasting power of it or the style in general. In his review Cromelin writes "we should all say a brief prayer that his fortunes are not made to rise and fall with the fate of the 'drag-rock' syndrome".Paytress, Mark.

==Legacy==

In 1987, as part of their 20th anniversary, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it No. 6 on "The 100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years." In 1997, Ziggy Stardust was named the 20th greatest album of all time in a Music of the Millennium poll conducted in the UK by HMV Group, Channel 4, The Guardian and Classic FM. In 1998, Q magazine readers placed it at No. 24 and Virgin All-time Top 1000 Albums ranked it at No. 11, while in 2003 the TV network VH1 placed it at No. 48. It was named the 35th best album ever made by Rolling Stone on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2000 Q placed it at No. 25 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2004 it was placed at No. 81 in Pitchfork Media's Top 100 Albums of the 1970s. In his 1995 book, "The Alternative Music Almanac", Alan Cross placed the album at No. 3 on the list of '10 Classic Alternative Albums'. In 2006, the album was chosen by TIME magazine as one of the 100 best albums of all time.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/index.html |title=The All-TIME 100 Albums |accessdate=16 January 2008 |work=time.com |date=2 November 2006[/tpl]
In 2005, Brazilian singer Seu Jorge did a cover album of 14 Bowie songs, many of them from Ziggy Stardust, as a soundtrack for the film The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou called The Life Aquatic Studio Sessions. The translation into Portuguese is not always exact, as Seu Jorge maintains the melodies and styles, but often varies the lyrics. Bowie himself said of Seu Jorge's covers: "Had Seu Jorge not recorded my songs in Portuguese I would never have heard this new level of beauty which he has imbued them with".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004799/Seu-Jorge.html |title=Seu Jorge Biography |publisher=Musicianguide.com |accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl] Musician Saul Williams named his 2007 Trent Reznor-produced album The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!. In 2009, Techno Cowboy covered the entire album from start to finish using just the Omnichord called "The Ziggy Stardust Omnichord Album".
In 2012, on the 40th anniversary of the album's release, a commemorative plaque was unveiled at the location of the cover photo on Heddon Street in London.

Bowie said of the sign, "It's such a shame that sign went removed. People read so much into it. They thought 'K. West' must be some sort of code for 'quest.' It took on all these sort of mystical overtones."[tpl]citation | url=http://www.algonet.se/~bassman/articles/93/rs.html | title=Station to Station | year=1993 | journal=Rolling Stone magazine | last=Sinclair | first=David | accessdate=24 May 2013[/tpl] The post office in the background (now "The Living Room, W1" bar) was the site of London's first nightclub, The Cave of the Golden Calf, which opened in 1912.

Of the album's packaging in general, Bowie said:

In March 2012, The Crown Estate, which owns Regent Street and Heddon Street, installed a commemorative brown plaque at 23 Heddon Street in the same place as the "K. West" sign on the cover photo. The unveiling was attended by original band members Mick Woodmansey and Trevor Bolder, and by Gary Kemp. The plaque was the first to be installed by The Crown Estate and is one of the few plaques in the country devoted to fictional characters.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17521244 |title=BBC News |work=Site of Ziggy Stardust album cover shoot marked with plaque |accessdate=27 March 2012 |date=27 March 2012[/tpl]
