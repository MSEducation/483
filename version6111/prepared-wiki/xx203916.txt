The moshav was established in 1950 by Jewish refugees from Harbin, Manchuria and Shanghai, China, who had fled the Chinese Civil War. They were later joined by Jews from the Cyprus concentration camps, and followed by Yemenite Jews. In 1956, a group of Polish Jewish immigrants settled on the moshav. Some of the families engage in fruit farming, raising peaches, plums, nectarines and loquats. Children attend the local Tali Alona elementary school.Alona region
