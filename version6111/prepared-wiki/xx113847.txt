The distinctly literary lyrics were written by Ryga. The song "Seventeenth Summer" was later re-recorded by Chilliwack and an extended jam based on it became a feature of their live performance. The fast-paced "Early Morning" was released as a single but did not become a major hit, reaching #84 on the RPM Magazine chart on July 12, 1969.
