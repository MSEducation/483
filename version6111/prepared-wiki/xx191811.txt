Since 1980, 56 known hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical depressions have affected the U.S. state of Maryland. Many of these storms also affect the country's capital, Washington, D.C., since the city is located on territory ceded by Maryland. Hurricanes are the most intense classification of these storms, while tropical storms and tropical depressions are generally weaker. The Delmarva Peninsula is often affected by cyclones   that brush the East Coast.[tpl]cite web|author=Tropical Prediction Center|title=Best Track Analysis|publisher=Unisys Corporation|accessdate=2008-05-08|url=http://weather.unisys.com/hurricane/atlantic/index.html[/tpl] Central and Western Maryland, as well as Washington, D.C., commonly receive rainfall from the remnants of storms that make landfall elsewhere and track northward. On rare occasions, the area experiences the effects of Pacific storms; one such example of this is Hurricane Tico, which made landfall on Mexico and moved inland. Four tropical cyclones in the state have caused five known deaths.
Hurricane Sandy was the deadliest storm, killing 11 people. The most damaging storm was Hurricane Irene, which resulted in $151 million in damage. The only storms to have caused hurricane force winds were Hurricane Irene of 2011, which caused hurricane force gusts along the beaches, and Hurricane Sandy of 2012, which caused hurricane force gusts as far inland as Gaithersburg, Maryland. There have been examples of a couple other storms which gusted to hurricane force, for example Hurricane Isabel of 2003.
