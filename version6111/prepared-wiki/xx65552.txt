[[Audio/modem riser]]

CATEGORIES: Motherboard expansion slot

[tpl]no footnotes|date=November 2012[/tpl]The audio/modem riser, also known as an AMR slot, is a riser expansion slot found on the motherboards of some Pentium III, Pentium 4, Duron, and Athlon personal computers. It was designed by Intel to interface with chipsets and provide analog functionality, such as sound cards and modems, on an expansion card.

==Design goals==

One of the design goals of Intel for AMR was to allow motherboard manufacturers a way to implement analog I/O (audio and modem functionality) on an expansion card for U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) certification.  Potential cost-savings could then be realized by reusing the card on multiple motherboards and skipping FCC certification for those motherboards.

==Technology==

Physically, it has two rows of 23 pins, making 46 pins total. Three drawbacks of AMR are that it eliminates one Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) slot, it is not plug and play, and it does not allow for hardware accelerated cards (only software-based).
Technologically, it has been superseded by the Advanced Communications Riser (ACR) and Intel's own Communications and Networking Riser (CNR). However, riser technologies in general never really took off. Modems generally remained as PCI cards while audio and network interfaces were integrated on to motherboards.
Recently[tpl]when|date=November 2012[/tpl] motherboard manufacturer ASRock has resurrected this concept, introducing the High Definition Multimedia Riser (HDMR) slot on most of its motherboards. Little information is available, but drivers on the Asrock website indicate the existence of V.92 modem cards for this standard. It is not clear how HDMR differs from AMR, if indeed at all.
