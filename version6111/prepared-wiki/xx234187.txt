Anthony Mitchell claims in a lawsuit that on July 10, 2011 he was at home, when officers called his home and said they needed to occupy the house in order to gain a "tactical advantage" in dealing with a domestic violence case at a neighbor's home.  Mr. Mitchell told the police that he did not want them entering his home. Officers showed up a bit later and broke down the door anyway. Anthony and his father, Michael Mitchell, where arrested and charged with obstructing an officer and spent 9 hours in jail. Anthony's mother, Linda Mitchell, was forced from her and her husband's home as well, which is on the same street as Anthony's home.  The lawsuit alleges that officers are guilty of crimes including assault, battery and abuse of processes as well as violating constitutional amendments, notably, the suit alleges officers violated the Third Amendment to the US Constitution http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/07/anthony-mitchell-lawsuit-third-amendment-_n_3557431.html
