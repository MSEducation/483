Founded in September 1992, the Quonset Air Museum was dedicated as an educational facility whose current mission is to preserve and interpret Rhode Island's aviation Heritage.
The museum's collection includes military vehicles, missiles, aircraft and over 5000 smaller aviation artifacts. An extensive archive of books, magazines, manuals, photos, documents and blueprints is preserved within the Quonset Air Museum. The collection represents Rhode Island's achievement in private, commercial, and military aviation.
The museum occupies Painting Hangar #488 located at what was once the Quonset Naval Air Station. This 50,000 sq. ft. facility is one of only three existing specialized wood and brick hangars built during WWII.
Current restoration projects the Walt Schiebe Restoration Area include a TBM Avenger, F6F Hellcat, F3D Skyknight. Other notable aircraft in the collection are the last surviving Curtiss XF15C mixed propulsion prototype and a twin tail C-1A Trader. This one of a kind aircraft had been fitted with twin tails and radome (but without associated electronics) to serve the aerodynamic prototype for the E-1 Tracer Electronic Counter Measure aircraft. This C-1A has the distinction of being the last aircraft to fly from Quonset Naval Air Station upon its closure in 1974. The museum houses several Vietnam era combat aircraft as well as the legendary F-14 Tomcat.
