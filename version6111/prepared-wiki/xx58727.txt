[[Axinomancy]]

CATEGORIES: Divination

Axinomancy is one of several obscure methods of divination using an axe, hatchet, or (rarely) a saw. Most of the methods involve throwing an axe into the ground, or swinging it into a tree, and interpreting the direction of the handle or the quivering of the blade.[tpl]Cite encyclopedia  | title = Axiomancy  | encyclopedia = The Element Encyclopedia of the Psychic World  | pages = 52  | publisher = Harper Element  | date = 2006  | id =   | accessdate = 26 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Arthur Bernard Cook|title=Zeus: a study in ancient religion|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xXzQAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 January 2011|year=1925|publisher=The University Press[/tpl] A form of this is axiomancy, this is when the quivering of the blade of an axe that has been thrust into a wooden table is interpreted by the diviner.
Another interesting method is heating an axe-head in a fire until it glows, and then interpreting the colors and shapes. A variant, attributed to the ancient Greeks, who held it in good repute, is to balance a spherical piece of agate on the edge of the axe (held sharp edge up).[tpl]cite book|author=J. S.

Some sources claim that Psalm 74 refers to the use of axinomancy to predict the fall of Jerusalem, although in the text the reference to upright axes is not specifically for divination.
