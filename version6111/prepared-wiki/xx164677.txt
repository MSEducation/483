==Background==

Nazareth Regional High School was established in 1962 by the Xaverian Brothers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nazarethrhs.org/about/history.jsp?rn=4325632|title=Nazareth Regional High School History|accessdate=2007-08-01|publisher=Nazareth Regional High School website|author=NRHS[/tpl] The architect was Anthony J. DePace of New York.
The first semester of the initial year of Nazareth High School was spent at the newly completed Bishop Kearney High School, since Nazareth’s building was yet unfinished. In the spring of 1963, Bishop Brian McEntegart dedicated the new building, and the first class of freshmen joined the small Nazareth faculty in moving into their own school. Brother Thaddeus, C.F.X., served as first principal until 1966. He and the other Xaverian Brothers and Catholic laymen who administered and staffed the new school centered the goals of Nazareth around the theme “wisdom, age, and favor with God” because these were the qualities of Jesus as described in Scripture as he grew up in the town of Nazareth. 
The first class of Nazareth Kingsmen graduated in June 1966.  
In 1974, the Principal, Brother Mathew Burke, with the encouragement of Bishop Francis Mugavero, formed a new Catholic school governed by a Board of Trustees because the diocese could no longer continue to subsidize the school. The new school was called Nazareth Regional High School and was staffed mostly by Catholic laypersons along with some religious men and women. In 1976, the school admitted women for the first time, and in June 1980 the first female valedictorian was selected.
In 1994, Nazareth Regional High School was formally affiliated with the network of schools sponsored by the Xaverian Brothers’ American Province. 
Today, Nazareth is a fully developed Catholic, co-educational, secondary school serving students from parochial, private, and public schools throughout Brooklyn and parts of Queens.
While the school faced financial difficulties in 2012 and it was feared that the school would close at the end of the academic year due to a decline in enrollment along with an overwhelming amount of outstanding debt. http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/offers-alumni-pour-cash-strapped-nazareth-high-school-closing-june-article-1.1021355 alumni and friends raised $700,000 in six weeks, allowing the school to remain open.http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/sports/brooklyns-nazareth-high-school-to-remain-open.html?_r=0
