"Amber" is a 2001 single from the band 311 off their album From Chaos. Focusing more on their reggae roots, the song is about Nick Hexum's then fiance and then Eden's Crush member Nicole Scherzinger.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] Scherzinger appears briefly in the music video, playing in the ocean with Hexum. Although it is not one of the highest charting singles from 311 since it hit number 13 on the  Modern Rock chart, it had more attention and popularity than any of their Top 10 singles on the chart and it is their most popular single from the band due to its media usage and it is the only single by 311 to have a certification by the RIAA, achieving Gold status seeing this as the band's signature song.
The song's intro was remixed on Greatest Hits '93-'03.
