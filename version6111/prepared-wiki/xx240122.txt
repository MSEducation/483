Colm O'Neill (born 1964 in Midleton, County Cork) is a former Irish sportsperson. He played Gaelic football and hurling with his local club Midleton and was a member of the Cork senior inter-county football team from 1984 until 1991.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/Cork/Profile.aspx|title=Cork Hurling Profile|publisher=www.hoganstand.com|date=|accessdate=2009-03-25[/tpl]
He won an All-Ireland Minor Football Championship medal in 1981 scoring three goals in Cork's victory over a spirited Derry side which had a lot of players who would claim senior medals in 1993.
O'Neill won two All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship medals in 1984 and 1985. He was at corner forward in the rebels unsuccessful All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final against Meath in 1987 and came on as a substitute the following year (1988) against the same opposition when again the rebel county fell to  Meath by a single point. In 1989 he was part of the team that won the All Ireland beating Mayo in the final.
1990 was by far O'Neill's best year, though the year ended on a low note when he was sent off by referee Paddy Russell for striking Meath's full back Mick Lyons in the All Ireland final. This denied O'Neill a certain All Star and a Player of the Year nomination.
In 1991 O'Neill retired after a shock defeat to Kerry in the Munster Senior Football Championship semi-final.
He currently is living in the United States as a very successful publican.
