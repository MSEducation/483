In 1969, he moved to BBC Radio 1 where he began by recording trailers for broadcasts and filling in for absent DJs, such as Kenny Everett. In April 1970, Edmonds began his own two-hour Saturday afternoon programme, broadcasting from 1pm-3pm, before replacing Kenny Everett on Saturday mornings from 10.00am-12.00noon in July of that year. In October 1971 he was moved to a Sunday morning slot from 10.00am-12.00noon before being promoted to host The Radio 1 Breakfast Show from June 1973 to April 1978, taking over from Tony Blackburn. Edmonds moved back to Sunday mornings from 10.00am-1.00pm in 1978 and also presented Talkabout, an hour-long talk show broadcast on Thursday evenings.[tpl]cite web| work=Radio Rewind |title=Noel Edmonds at Dingly Dell |url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/noel_edmonds_page.htm| accessdate=2006-09-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060616191831/http://radiorewind.co.uk/noel_edmonds_page.htm  |archivedate = 2006-06-16[/tpl]

In 2003, Edmonds made a brief radio comeback, taking over the 'drivetime' broadcast on BBC Radio 2 for eight weeks while Johnnie Walker was undergoing treatment for cancer.

==Television career==

Edmonds hosted Top of the Pops at various points between 1970 and 1978, during which time he also presented a phone-in programme for teenagers called Z Shed on BBC1 as well as a programme called Hobby Horse. He hosted the children's Saturday morning programme, Multi-Coloured Swap Shop, which ran from 1976 until 1982. In 1980, Edmonds took part in the Eurovision Song Contest, introducing the UK entry live on stage at the final in the Hague. During Swap Shops run, Edmonds hosted Lucky Numbers, an evening phone-in quiz programme which required viewers to call in and answer questions based on clips of films shown – and a revival of the 1960s pop music series Juke Box Jury.
Edmonds was one of the original presenters of the BBC's motoring series Top Gear during the 1970s. During his time on the programme, he rubbished the Fiat Strada, saying it "wasn't very good", which caused Fiat to threaten to sue the BBC unless he apologised for the comments.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] Edmonds reappeared in one episode of Top Gear in the 1990s, to road test the classic 1960s Ford GT40 supercar, because current host Jeremy Clarkson - at [tpl]convert|6|ft|5|in|m|abbr=on[/tpl] tall - was unable to fit into the cockpit. In the 1980s, Edmonds hosted a series on BBC1 called The Time of Your Life, where celebrities recalled the time they were at their happiest professionally. It ran for three series from 1983.

===The Late, Late Breakfast Show===

The Late, Late Breakfast Show was a Noels first Saturday evening light entertainment show  on the BBC.  Broadcast live on Saturday evenings from 4 September 1982 to 8 November 1986. It was presented by Noel Edmonds, initially with co-host Leni Harper and also featured Mike Smith and John Peel. It is remembered for several accidents during its regular "Give It A Whirl" stunt slot; in particular, the 1986 death of Michael Lush.
The programme was cancelled by the BBC on 15 November 1986, following an accident two days earlier in which Michael Lush died. Lush had been selected to take part in a live stunt for the 'Whirly Wheel' section: while rehearsing a bungee jump he plunged 120 ft to his death when his rope came loose. Noel Edmonds quit the show immediately after.

===Telly Addicts===

Telly Addicts is the name of a BBC1 game show hosted by Noel Edmonds, broadcast from 3 September 1985 until 29 July 1998. All questions were based on television programmes past and present, and generally took the form of a short clip being shown followed by a series of questions either specifically about the clip or more generally about the programme from which it had been taken. Two teams sat opposite each other on sofas. In 1991, he presented a prime time series called Noel's Addicts, but this show had no similarity to the Telly Addicts format and only ran for one series.

===Noel's Saturday Roadshow===

Noel's Saturday Roadshow was Noels second BBC television light entertainment show broadcast live on Saturday evenings from 3 September 1988 to 15 December 1990.[tpl]cite web| work=Off The Telly |title=The Glory Game - The Rise And Rise Of Saturday Night Telly |url=http://offthetelly.co.uk/lightentertainment/glorygame/part15.htm | accessdate=2006-09-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041118201432/http://offthetelly.co.uk/lightentertainment/glorygame/part15.htm |archivedate = 2004-11-18[/tpl]
It was presented by Edmonds, his first major TV project since the demise of The Late, Late Breakfast Show two years earlier. The programme contained several elements which had been found in its predecessor, such as phone-in quizzes, celebrity interviews and bands performing in the studio.
The premise for the new show was that unlike The Late Late Breakfast Show, which had been broadcast from the BBC's studios each week, the Roadshow would come from a new, different and exotic location each week. These 'locations' were in fact elaborate studio sets dressed to resemble each week's location, such as the North Pole, a space station, Hollywood, Niagara Falls.
The irony of this was not lost on Edmonds, whose self-deprecating presentation style frequently made light of the low budget production values. The programme was a slow-burning success, and following the third series in 1990, Edmonds' popularity and reputation were sufficiently re-established with the public for Edmonds to pitch Noel's House Party to the BBC.
The show also introduced regular features such as the Gunge Tank, the Gotcha Oscars and Wait 'Till I Get You Home, which would all be carried across and subsequently developed in House Party. Another item was "Clown court", where a guest actor from a TV series would be on trial for all the bloopers made during the shooting of that show, for example Sylvester McCoy for the title role of Doctor Who, and Tony Robinson for his character of Baldrick in Blackadder the Third.

===Noel's House Party===

Edmonds returned to television with The Noel Edmonds Saturday Roadshow in 1988, after presenting a show called Whatever Next? earlier in the same year. By 1991, the Saturday Roadshow morphed into Noel's House Party. This latter series ran for eight years from Edmonds' supposed mansion in the fictional town of Crinkley Bottom. Regular features included NTV, where cameras were secretly hidden in viewer's homes, often in VHS tape cases. There was also the "Gotchas", where celebrities were caught in elaborate and embarrassing setups.
In one infamous incident NTV's hidden cameras caught celebrity psychic Uri Geller apparently bending a spoon with his hands while demonstrating his "powers" to a member of the public. When then-Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis was "Gotcha'd", he infamously yelled: "You are a dead man!". He later participated in Noel himself being "Gotcha'd". Mr. Blobby, a yellow and pink spotted character, initially appeared in the "Gotcha" section, and became a regular feature of the programme. The character even achieved the 1993 Christmas No. 1.[tpl]cite web| work=Everything2 |title=UK Number One singles of 1993 |url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1341888| accessdate=2006-09-10[/tpl]
Noel's House Party was a staple of BBC1's autumn and spring schedules for more than eight years. Several reformats failed to reverse its declining popularity, and in the final programme, broadcast on 20 March 1999, Edmonds appealed that viewers' memories should be kind to the programme.[tpl]cite web| work=TV Cream |title=The TV Cream Guide to Television Presenters |url=http://tv.cream.org/specialassignments/presenters/e.htm| accessdate=2006-09-12[/tpl]

==Theme parks==

Edmonds-licensed theme park attractions based on Crinkley Bottom and Mr Blobby were set up in existing parks at Cricket St Thomas in Somerset and Pleasurewood Hills Theme Park in Lowestoft, Suffolk.

Following disappointing visitor numbers, and in the case of Morecambe, legal disputes with the local council, the deal was scrapped and the park closed.

==TV licence boycott==

Edmonds claimed that he had stopped payment on his TV licence in early 2008, in response to the sometimes controversial methods used to enforce collection of the licence.
