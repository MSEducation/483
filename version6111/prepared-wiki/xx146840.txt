[[Ceramic foam]]

CATEGORIES: Ceramic materials, Ceramic engineering

Ceramic foam is a tough foam made from ceramics. Manufacturing techniques include impregnating open-cell polymer foams internally with ceramic slurry and then firing in a kiln, leaving only ceramic material. The foams may consist of several ceramic materials such as aluminium oxide, a common high-temperature ceramic, and gets insulating powers from the many tiny air-filled voids within the material.
The foam can be used not only for thermal insulation,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/05/010518082028.htm | title=Novel Ceramic Foam Is Safe And Effective Insulation | work=Science Daily | date=May 18, 2001 | accessdate=November 11, 2011[/tpl] but for a variety of other applications such as acoustic insulation, absorption of environmental pollutants, filtration of molten metal alloys, and as substrate for catalysts requiring large internal surface area.
It has been used as  stiff lightweight structural material, specifically for support of reflecting telescope mirrors.
