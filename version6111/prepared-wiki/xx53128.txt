Lecco [tpl]audio|It-Lecco.ogg|listen[/tpl] (Lombard: Lecch ˈlɛk) is a city of c. 47,760 inhabitants in Lombardy, northern Italy, [tpl]convert|50|km|mi|0[/tpl] north of Milan, the capital of the province of Lecco. It lies at the end of the south-eastern branch of Lake Como (the branch named Lake of Lecco / Lago di Lecco). The Bergamo Alps rise to the north and east, cut through by the Valsassina of which Lecco marks the southern end.
The lake narrows to form the river Adda, so bridges were built to improve road communications with Como and Milan. There are four bridges crossing the river Adda in Lecco: the Azzone Visconti Bridge (1336–1338), the Kennedy Bridge (1956) and the Alessandro Manzoni Bridge (1985) and a railroad bridge.
Its economy used to be based on industry (iron manufacturers), but now it is mainly tertiary.
Lecco is also Alpine Town of the Year 2013.http://www.alpenstaedte.org/de/aktuell/news/4633

==History==

Archaeological finds demonstrate the presence of Celtic settlement in the area before the arrival of the Romans. The latter built a castrum here and made it an important road hub. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Lombards captured the town in the 6th century; they were followed by the Franks, who made Lecco the seat of a countship and, later, of a frontier Mark.
Emperor Otto I spent a long time in Lecco, quenching the 964 revolt against the Holy Roman Empire led by Lecco’s count Attone. Later it became a possession of the Milanese monastery of St. Ambrose. Conrad II also stayed in Lecco, in the attempt to free it from the church, but as the result of the ensuing wars the city was subjected by Milan. It subsequently followed the history of the Duchy of Milan and of Lombardy. In the early 16th century it was briefly ruled by the condottiere Gian Giacomo Medici.
During World War II it was an important centre of the partisan war against the German occupation.

==Sport==

The town’s football team Calcio Lecco 1912 currently play in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. Their traditional rivalry with the team of the city of Como is marked by the so-called Derby del Lario which last took place in the 2009-2010 season when both teams were competing in Lega Pro Prima Divisione.
Lecco is the finish of the Giro di Lombardia cycling classic which includes the famous Madonna del Ghisallo hill.

Alessandro Manzoni set the events in the first half of The Betrothed in Lecco, a town he knew deeply since he had spent part of his childhood there.
{{bquote|We voyaged by steamer down the Lago di Lecco, through wild mountain scenery, and by hamlets and villas, and disembarked at the town of Lecco. They said it was two hours, by carriage to the ancient city of Bergamo, and that we would arrive there in good season for the railway train. We got an open barouche and a wild, boisterous driver, and set out. It was delightful. We had a fast team and a perfectly smooth road. There were towering cliffs on our left, and the pretty Lago di Lecco on our right, and every now and then it rained on us
