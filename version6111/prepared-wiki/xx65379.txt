Brāhmī is the modern name given to the one of the oldest scripts used on the Indian Subcontinent and in Central Asia, during the final centuries BCE and the early centuries CE. Like its contemporary, Kharoṣṭhī, which was used in what is now Afghanistan, Pakistan and North India, Brahmi was an abugida.
The best-known Brahmi inscriptions are the rock-cut edicts of Ashoka in north-central India, dated to 250-232 BCE. The script was deciphered in 1837 by James Prinsep, an archaeologist, philologist, and official of the British East India Company.More details about Buddhist monuments at Sanchi, Archaeological Survey of India, 1989. The origin of the script is still much debated, with current Western academic opinion generally agreeing (with some exceptions) that Brahmi was derived from or at least influenced by one or more contemporary Semitic scripts, but a strong current of opinion in India favors the idea that it is connected to the much older and as-yet undecipered Indus script.
The Gupta script of the 5th century is sometimes called "Late Brahmi". The Brahmi script diversified into numerous local variants, classified together as the Brahmic family of scripts. Dozens of modern scripts used across South Asia have descended from Brahmi, making it one of the world's most influential writing traditions.

==Origins==

While the contemporary and perhaps somewhat older Kharosthi script is widely accepted to be a derivation of the Aramaic script, the genesis of the Brahmi script is less straightforward.
An origin in the Imperial Aramaic script has nevertheless been proposed by some scholars since the publications by Albrecht Weber (1856) and Georg Bühler's On the origin of the Indian Brahma alphabet (1895).[tpl]cite book |first=Richard|last=Salomon|chapter=Brahmi and Kharoshthi|editors=Daniels, Peter T.; Bright, William |title=The World's Writing Systems |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-19-507993-0 [/tpl][tpl]rp|378[/tpl] [tpl]Citation | last=Salomon | first=Richard | title=On The Origin Of The Early Indian Scripts: A Review Article.

Bühler's ideas have been particularly influential, though even by the 1895 date of his great opus on the subject, he could identify no less than five competing theories of the origin, one positing an indigenous origin and four deriving it from various Semitic models.[tpl]Citation| title=On the origin of the Indian Brahma alphabet|last=Bühler|first=Georg|publisher=Strassburg: Karl J.

Like Kharosthi, Brāhmī was used to write the early dialects of Prakrit. Surviving records of the script are mostly restricted to inscriptions on buildings and graves as well as liturgical texts. Sanskrit was not written until many centuries later, and as a result, Brāhmī is not a perfect match for Sanskrit; several Sanskrit sounds cannot be written in Brāhmī.[tpl]rp|377[/tpl]
The most disputed point about the origin of the Brāhmī script is whether it was a purely indigenous development or was inspired or derived from scripts that originated outside India. Saloman noted that the indigenous view is strongly preferred by Indian scholars, whereas the idea of Semitic borrowing is preferred most often by Western scholars. He agreed with S.R. Goyal that biases have influenced both sides of the debate.[tpl]Citation | last=Salomon | first=Richard | title=A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages | publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998|page=20[/tpl] Bühler curiously cited a passage by Sir Alexander Cunningham, one of the earliest indigenous origin proponents, that indicated that, at the time, the indigenous origin was a preference of English scholars in opposition to the "unknown Western" origin preferred by continental scholars.
Among scholars who have taken the origin to have been purely indigenous are F. Raymond Allchin, who speculated in a personal communication that Brahmi perhaps had the Harappan script (i.e. Indus script) as its predecessor.[tpl]Citation | last=Goody|first=Jack|title=The Interface Between the Written and the Oral|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|pages=301–302 (note 4)[/tpl] However, Allchin and Erdosy later in 1995 expressed the opinion that there was as yet insufficient evidence to resolve the question, though they were confident that the development of Brahmi was earlier than and "quite independent" of the Aramaic derivation of Kharosthi.[tpl]Citation | last=Allchin | first=F.Raymond |last2=Erdosy|first2=George | title=The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States | publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995|page=336[/tpl] G.R. Hunter in his book The Script of Harappa and Mohenjodaro and Its Connection with Other Scripts (1934) proposed a derivation of the Brahmi alphabets from the Indus Script, the match being considerably higher than that of Aramaic in his estimation.[tpl]citation| title=The Script of Harappa and Mohenjodaro and Its Connection with Other Scripts|last=Hunter|first=G.R.|year=1934|publisher=London:K. Paul, Trench, Trubner|series=Studies in the history of culture|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00013642/[/tpl] The most prominent alternative view in the indigenous origin category is that Brahmi was invented entirely independently of either foreign scripts or the Indus script.[tpl]Citation | last=Salomon | first=Richard | title=A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages | publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998|page=21[/tpl]
This view usually accepts that the Mauryans were previously aware of the art of writing in general but proposes that Brahmi was created anew for the purposes of writing Prakrit, based on well established theories of Vedic grammar and phonetics, and probably on the order of the reform-minded King Ashoka. From this point of view, Brahmi might be seen as a successful attempt to remedy some of the apparent limitations of Kharosthi as a vehicle for writing Prakrit.[tpl]citation|last=Scharfe|first=Hartmut|series=Handbook of Oriental Studies|title=Education in Ancient India|pages=11–12|year=2002|publisher=Brill Publishers|location=Leiden, Netherlands[/tpl]
There is little intervening evidence for writing during the millennium and a half between the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization c. 1900 BCE and the first appearance of Brahmi in the 3rd century BCE (earlier dates are claimed, but not widely accepted—see South Indian epigraphy below), and there is no accepted decipherment of the Indus script, but similarities to the Indus script have been nonetheless claimed by scholars such as Kak, who did not even acknowledge the existence of the Semitic-origin theory.[tpl]Citation |first=Subhash | last=Kak| title=The evolution of early writing in India| journal=Indian Journal of History of Science |volume=28| pages=375–388| year=1994|url=http://www.ece.lsu.edu/kak/writ.pdf[/tpl] A promising possible link between the Indus script and later writing traditions may be in the graffiti of the South Indian megalithic culture, which may have some overlap with the Indus symbol inventory and persisted in use up at least through the appearance of the Brahmi and Tamil Brahmi scripts up into the 3rd century CE. These graffiti usually appear singly, though on occasion may be found in groups of two or three, and are thought to have been family, clan, or religious symbols.[tpl]citation|title=Between the Empires : Society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE|chapter=Inscribed pots, emerging identities|first=Himanshu Prabha| last=Ray|pages=121–122|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|editor=Patrick Olivelle[/tpl]
There appears to be general agreement at least that Brahmi and Kharosthi are historically related, though much disagreement persists about the nature of this relationship. Trigger considered them, as a pair, to be one of four instances of the invention of an alphasyllabary, the other three being Old Persian cuneiform, the Meroitic script, and the Ge'ez script. All four of these have striking similarities, such as using short /a/ as an inherent vowel, but Trigger (who accepted the Aramaic inspiration of Brahmi with extensive local development, along with a pre-Ashokan date) was unable to find a direct common source among them. Gnanadesikan also posited a stimulus diffusion view of the development of Brahmi and Kharosthi, in which the idea of alphabetic sound representation was learned from the Aramaic-speaking Persians, but much of the writing system was a novel development tailored to the phonology of Prakrit.

===Aramaic hypothesis===

The Semitic theory (Phoenician or Aramaic) is the more strongly supported by the available data.[tpl]rp|378[/tpl] According to the Aramaic hypothesis, the oldest Brāhmī inscriptions shows striking parallels with contemporary Aramaic for the sounds that are congruent between the two languages, especially if the letters are flipped to reflect the change in writing direction.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] (Aramaic is written from right to left, as are several early examples of Brāhmī.) For example, both Brāhmī and Aramaic g resemble Λ; both Brāhmī and Aramaic t resemble [tpl]IPA|ʎ[/tpl], etc.
Brāhmī does feature a number of extensions to the Aramaic alphabet, as it was required to write more sounds. For example, Aramaic did not distinguish dental stops such as [tpl]IAST|d[/tpl] from retroflex stops such as [tpl]IAST|ḍ[/tpl], and in Brāhmī the dental and retroflex series are graphically very similar, as if both had been derived from a single Aramaic prototype. (See Tibetan alphabet for a similar later development.) Aramaic did not have Brāhmī’s aspirated consonants ([tpl]IAST|kh[/tpl], [tpl]IAST|th[/tpl], etc.), whereas Brāhmī did not have Aramaic's emphatic consonants ([tpl]transl|sem|q, ṭ, ṣ[/tpl]), and it appears that these unneeded emphatic letters filled in for Brāhmī's aspirates: Aramaic q for Brāhmī kh, Aramaic [tpl]Unicode|ṭ[/tpl] (Θ) for Brāhmī th ([tpl]IPA|ʘ[/tpl]), etc. And just where Aramaic did not have a corresponding emphatic stop, p, Brāhmī seems to have doubled up for the corresponding aspirate: Brāhmī p and ph are graphically very similar, as if taken from the same source in Aramaic p. The first letter of the two alphabets also match: Brāhmī a, which resembled a reversed κ, looks a lot like Aramaic alef, which resembled Hebrew א. The following table compares Brāhmī with Phoenician and Aramaic.
