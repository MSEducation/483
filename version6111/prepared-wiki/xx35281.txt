Canunda is a national park in South Australia (Australia). It is [tpl]convert|350|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] southeast of Adelaide, on the coast about [tpl]convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] southwest of Millicent. It consists of coastal dunes, limestone cliffs, and natural bushland. The beaches can be dangerous, but are popular for beach fishing.Parks SA, retrieved 25 January 2013
Much of the park is accessible only to four wheel drive vehicles and walkers.
From as far back as 10,000 years ago, members of the Boandik group of Indigenous Australians lived in temporary camps along the coast during summer, and for the rest of the year they lived near inland swamps in relatively permanent huts (wurlas).
The northern end of the park was once part of Mayurra Station. The remnants of Canunda's pastoral history can be seen at Coola Outstation.
The park's office is located in the town of Southend at the northernmost end of the park.
