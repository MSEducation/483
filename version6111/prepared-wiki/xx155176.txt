The 1955 NBA draft was the ninth annual draft of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The draft was held on April 13, 1955 before the 1955–56 season. In this draft, eight remaining NBA teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players. In each round, the teams select in reverse order of their win–loss record in the previous season. The Milwaukee Hawks participated in the draft, but relocated to St. Louis, Missouri and became the St. Louis Hawks prior to the start of the season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/hawks/history/00400483.html|title=Hawks: Franchise History|work=NBA.com/Hawks|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|date=|accessdate=October 30, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091202222712/http://www.nba.com/hawks/history/00400483.html| archivedate= 2 December 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The draft consisted of 15 rounds comprising 96 players selected.
