George M. Coombs (November 27, 1851 â€“ March 27, 1909) was a noted Maine architect who designed numerous buildings in the state, many of which survive and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. His firm evolved from Stevens & Coombs (with Lewiston architect William H. Stevens), to Coombs & Gibbs (with Eugene J. Gibbs), finally into Coombs, Gibbs & Wilkinson (with Harry C. Wilkinson). In 1901, the office was joined by his son, Harry S. Coombs.

==Life==

Born in Brunswick, he was the son of Hannah (Morse) Coombs and John Coombs, a shipbuilder. At the age of 17, George M. Coombs moved up the Androscoggin River to Lewiston, then a booming mill town, and worked two years as a carpenter to help learn his trade. In 1870, he went into business as an independent architect. He married Clara Coffin and they had two sons.[tpl]Cite book  | author = Maine Historical Society | title = Maine: A History, Volume 4 | year = 1919| location = New York, New York| page = 205| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=rH95AAAAMAAJ&lpg=RA1-PA205&ots=28bBVKXgVf&dq=George%20M.%20Coombs%20Maine%20architect%20born%20in&pg=RA1-PA205#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]
Coombs became successful designing residences and institutional buildings throughout Lewiston, its twin city Auburn, and across the state, working in the prevailing Second Empire, Romanesque Revival and Queen Anne styles. The company is now Harriman Associates.[tpl]NRISref|version=2009a[/tpl]
