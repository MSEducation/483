CATEGORIES: Pathum Thani Province, Provinces of Thailand

Pathum Thani ([tpl]lang-th|ปทุมธานี[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-th|pā.tʰūm tʰāːnīː|pron[/tpl]) is one of the central provinces (changwat) of Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Ayutthaya, Saraburi, Nakhon Nayok, Chachoengsao, Bangkok and Nonthaburi.
The province is located directly north of Bangkok and is part of the Bangkok metropolis. In many parts the boundary between the two provinces is not noticeable anymore, since both sides of the boundary are being equally urbanized. Pathum Thani town is the administrative seat, but Ban Rangsit, seat of Thanyaburi district, is the largest populated place within the provincial boundary.
Pathum Thani is an old province filled with multiple temples, parks and areas to experience Mon culture. A lot of the modern knowledge, culture and history are presented in the museums and temples. The most famous amusement park in Thailand, Dream World, is also set there. In addition, it is a source of Mon culture and traditions by the Chaophaya River that shows the special characteristic of their culture. It is a perfect place for travelling in various styles near Bangkok.

==Geography==

The province is located in the low alluvial flats of the Chao Phraya river, that also flows through the capital city. Many canals (khlongs) cross the province and feed the rice paddies.

==History==

The city dates back to a settlement founded by Mon migrating from Mottama ([tpl]lang-th|เมาะตะมะ[/tpl]) in Myanmar around 1650. The original name was Sam Khok. In 1815 King Rama II visited the city and the citizens offered him many Lotus flowers, which made the king rename the city to Pathum Thani meaning The City of Lotus.

==Symbols==

The provincial seal shows a pink lotus flower with two rice ears bending over it. Both symbols stand for the fertility of the province.
The provincial tree is the Indian coral tree (Erythrina variegata), provincial flower the Lotus (Nymphaea lotus).

==Administrative divisions==

The province is subdivided into 7 districts (amphoe). The districts are further subdivided into 60 communes (tambon) and 529 villages (muban).

==Education and technology==

Pathum Thani has a very high concentration of higher education institutions, especially ones in the field of science and technology. From this fact, together with a number of industrial parks and many research agencies (including those in Thailand Science Park) in the province, the province is considered as an "Education and Technology Hub" of its area.
