The 2000 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season was the first Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season since the original series' demise in 1996. Nine events were held with two 40-minute races at each racing weekend.

==Pre-Season==

This was the resurrected DTM's first season since the cancellation of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft at the end of 1996. Mercedes returned to the series after their unfortunate CLR Le Mans project along with H.W.A GmbH and AMG. They were joined by Opel, who brought along the Holzer, Phoenix, Irmscher and Euroteam from the German Super Touring Car Championship (STW) where they had raced in 1999. The resumption of DTM also meant the end of STW. Audi did not enter, but was still represented through the semi-independent Abt Sportsline team. Two additional teams also ran Mercedes; they were Persson Motorsport and Team Rosberg.
