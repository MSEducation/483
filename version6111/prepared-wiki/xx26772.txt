Yeshiva University is a private university in New York City, with six campuses in New York and one in Israel. Founded in 1886, it is a research university.

==Campus==

The University's main campus, Wilf Campus, is located in Washington Heights. A 1928 plan to build a spacious Moorish Revival campus around several gardens and courtyards was cancelled by the Great Depression of 1929 after only one building had been erected. Building continued after the Depression in modern style and by the acquisition of existing neighborhood buildings.[ref]
