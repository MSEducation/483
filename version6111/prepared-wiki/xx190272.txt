Jang.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.olivetnews.com/articles/2012/06/01/697/olivet-university-dr.-jang-transitions-to-new-role-at-hbs--dr.-wagner-to-serve-as-president-and-chancellor.htm |title=Dr. David Jang New Role at HBS |publisher=Olivetnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldea.org/whoweare/governance |title=Dr. David Jang WEA NAC Member |publisher=worldea.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06[/tpl] Olivet existed as a small bible college from 1992 until 2000 – the year the Evangelical Assembly of Presbyterian Churches in America (EAPCA) [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nae.net/membership/current-members |title=EAPC a member of the National Association of Evangelicals |publisher=nae.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06[/tpl] officially launched Olivet Theological College & Seminary (OTCS). The bible college was intended to train the denomination’s ministers. OTCS eventually functioned more as a "seedbed" for mission, offering multiple study fields and distance learning to ministry-bound students.
Olivet's flagship college, Olivet Theological College & Seminary, developed, necessitating several major changes to accommodate the school’s diverse student body. It was broken into separate institutions, each offering different degree programs. In addition to OTCS, there is the Jubilee College of Music, Olivet College of Art & Design, Olivet College of Business, Olivet College of Information Technology, Olivet College of Journalism, and Olivet College of Language Education.
Currently, Olivet University's main campus is located in the heart of San Francisco, where it has been since 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://olivetuniversity.edu/aboutolivet/history.htm |title=Olivet University |publisher=Olivetuniversity.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-30[/tpl]
