When Troop D was reorganized in October, 1986 the scout platoon was no longer required and subsequently reformed into a long range surveillance detachment. The split from Troop D officially made this a new unit which does not share history from Troop D. This units first assignment continued with the 1st Squadron, 26th Cavalry Regiment.[/tpl]
