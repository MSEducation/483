The Köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation.  The most commonly used form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical, humid continental, oceanic climate, Mediterranean climate, steppe, subarctic climate, tundra, polar ice cap, and desert.
Rain forests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between [tpl]convert|1750|and|2000|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|author=Susan Woodward|url=http://www.radford.edu/~swoodwar/CLASSES/GEOG235/biomes/rainforest/rainfrst.html|title=Tropical Broadleaf Evergreen Forest: The Rainforest|date=1997-10-29|accessdate=2008-03-14|publisher=Radford University[/tpl]  A tropical savanna is a grassland biome located in semi-arid to semi-humid climate regions of subtropical and tropical latitudes, with rainfall between [tpl]convert|750|and|1270|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] a year.  They are widespread on Africa, and are also found in India, the northern parts of South America, Malaysia, and Australia.[tpl]cite web|author=Susan Woodward|url=http://www.radford.edu/~swoodwar/CLASSES/GEOG235/biomes/savanna/savanna.html|title=Tropical Savannas|date=2005-02-02|accessdate=2008-03-16|publisher=Radford University[/tpl]  The humid subtropical climate zone is where winter rainfall (and sometimes snowfall) is associated with large storms that the westerlies steer from west to east. Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and from occasional tropical cyclones.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title = Humid subtropical climate | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica Online | year = 2008 | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-53358/climate | accessdate = 2008-05-14 [/tpl]  Humid subtropical climates lie on the east side continents, roughly between latitudes 20° and 40° degrees away from the equator.[tpl]cite web|author=Michael Ritter|url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/humid_subtropical.html|date=2008-12-24|publisher=University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point|title=Humid Subtropical Climate|accessdate=2008-03-16[/tpl]

==Effect on agriculture==

Precipitation, especially rain, has a dramatic effect on agriculture.  All plants need at least some water to survive, therefore rain (being the most effective means of watering) is important to agriculture.  While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, too much or too little rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops.  Drought can kill crops and increase erosion,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/drought/livedrought.shtml|title=Living With Drought|author=Bureau of Meteorology|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|year=2010|accessdate=2010-01-15[/tpl] while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://agnewsarchive.tamu.edu/dailynews/stories/CROP/Jun0607a.htm|title=Texas Crop and Weather|date=2007-06-06|author=Robert Burns|publisher=Texas A&M University|accessdate=2010-01-15[/tpl]  Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/mauseth/researchoncacti/|title=Mauseth Research: Cacti|author=James D. Mauseth|publisher=University of Texas|date=2006-07-07|accessdate=2010-01-15[/tpl] while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.
In areas with wet and dry seasons, soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season.  Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime.  The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature.A. Roberto Frisancho (1993). Human Adaptation and Accommodation. University of Michigan Press, pp. 388. ISBN 978-0-472-09511-7. Retrieved on 2008-12-27.  Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season.

==Changes due to global warming==

Increasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation which leads to more precipitation. Precipitation has generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 to 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s.  Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time.  Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter.  The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier.  There has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics.  Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation, more evaporation, or both).  Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1% per century since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6% per century) and the South (11.1%). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (-9.25%).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/recentpsc.html|title=Precipitation and Storm Changes|author=Climate Change Division|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|date=2008-12-17|accessdate=2009-07-17[/tpl]

==Changes due to urban heat island==

The urban heat island warms cities 0.6 to 5.6 °C (1.1 to 10.1 °F) above surrounding suburbs and rural areas.  This extra heat leads to greater upward motion, which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity.  Rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48% and 116%.  Partly as a result of this warming, monthly rainfall is about 28% greater between [tpl]convert|20|to|40|mi|km|disp=flip[/tpl] downwind of cities, compared with upwind.[tpl]cite news | title=Spain goes hi-tech to beat drought | author=Dale Fuchs | publisher=The Guardian | date=2005-06-28 | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/weather/Story/0,2763,1516375,00.html | accessdate=2007-08-02 | location=London[/tpl]  Some cities induce a total precipitation increase of 51%.[tpl]cite web|url=//web.archive.org/web/20100316084837/http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20020613urbanrain.html|title=NASA Satellite Confirms Urban Heat Islands Increase Rainfall Around Cities|author=Goddard Space Flight Center|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|date=2002-06-18|accessdate=2009-07-17[/tpl]

==Forecasting==

The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (abbreviated QPF) is the expected amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area.[tpl]cite web|author=Jack S. Bushong|year=1999|url=http://cms.ce.gatech.edu/gwri/uploads/proceedings/1999/BushongJ-99.pdf|title=Quantitative Precipitation Forecast: Its Generation and Verification at the Southeast River Forecast Center|publisher=University of Georgia|accessdate=2008-12-31[/tpl]  A QPF will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a QPF valid period.  Precipitation forecasts tend to be bound by synoptic hours such as 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 GMT.  Terrain is considered in QPFs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail.[tpl]cite web|author=Daniel Weygand|year=2008|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/wrh/talite0821.pdf|title=Optimizing Output From QPF Helper|publisher=National Weather Service Western Region|accessdate=2008-12-31[/tpl] Starting in the mid to late 1990s, QPFs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the United States.[tpl]cite web|author=Noreen O.

Reggiani and A. H.

The forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements, weather radar estimates, or a combination of both.  Various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast.[tpl]cite web|author=Charles Lin|year=2005|url=http://www.actif-ec.net/Workshop2/Presentations/ACTIF_P_S1_02.pdf|title=Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF) from Weather Prediction Models and Radar Nowcasts, and Atmospheric Hydrological Modelling for Flood Simulation|publisher=Achieving Technological Innovation in Flood Forecasting Project|accessdate=2009-01-01[/tpl]
