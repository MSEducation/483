Goetheplatz is an U-Bahn station in Munich on the U3 and U6.  The stations decor is similar to that of the U3/U6 platform at Sendlinger Tor, but its history is much older than that.
Originally it was constructed between 1938-1941 as part of a planned North-South S-Bahn network in Munich, which was abandoned due to the war effort.  For this reason, the platform is 135 meters long, significantly longer than that of any other U-Bahn station (usually about 120 meters). It marked the terminus of the first U-Bahn line, opened on 19 October 1971.http://world.nycsubway.org/world/de/munich-u6.html
It is also noted as being one of the stations on Munich's U-Bahn network that pipes in classical music.
