Geoffrey Ridel (or Ridell) ([tpl]lang-it|Goffredo Ridello[/tpl]) (died 1084) was the Duke of Gaeta as a vassal of the Prince of Capua from 1067 or 1068.
In 1061, he was one of the leaders of the first Norman campaign in Sicily. In 1067, he was appointed duke of Gaeta. He was the first Norman duke since William of Montreuil and the populace did not like him. Electing their own civil government, they expelled Geoffrey, who continued to rule the country side as duke from his castle at Pontecorvo. Geoffrey was succeeded by his son Reginald. His daughter, Eva or Anna, married John VI of Naples.
