==History==

2009 In 2009 the Medoc Trail Marathon and 10-miler will be held on October 17.  The race size will increase to accommodate more runners, but both events are expected to sell out early.  The races will again run in Medoc Mountain State Park located in Hollister, North Carolina.
2008 In 2008 the inaugural Medoc Trail Marathon and 10-miler was held on October 4.  The Rocky Mount Endurance Club launched this new trail event in Medoc Mountain State Park located in Hollister, North Carolina.  In its first year, the 10-miler sold out.
All runners received long sleeve race shirts, custom finishers medals, and a technical running hat. The Rocky Mount Endurance Club was still able to make a $1,000 contribution to the Medoc Mountain State Park with race proceeds

==Location==

Medoc Mountain State Park is a beautiful area of North Carolina with comfortable running trails. The views of Little Fishing Creek from the bluffs are worth the trip to the park. For an experienced trail runner, overall it is an easy trail. You will experience a few steep short climbs up the bluffs and a few gradual smaller hills, but a lot of flats along the creek.

==Race Director==

The Medoc Trail Races are directed by the Rocky Mount Endurance Club, a non-profit running club founded in 2006 as a marathon training team.
