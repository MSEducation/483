[[List of unsolved problems in physics]]

CATEGORIES: Unsolved problems in physics, Lists of unsolved problems, Physics-related lists

Some of the major unsolved problems in physics are theoretical, meaning that existing theories seem incapable of explaining a certain observed phenomenon or experimental result. The others are experimental, meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail.
