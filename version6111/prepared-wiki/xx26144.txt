[tpl]Nihongo|Ichiro Suzuki|鈴木 一朗|Suzuki Ichirō[/tpl], usually known simply as [tpl]Nihongo|Ichiro|イチロー|Ichirō[/tpl] (born October 22, 1973), is a Japanese-born professional baseball outfielder who currently plays for the New York Yankees. Originally a player in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), Ichiro moved to the United States in 2001 to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners, with whom he spent 11 seasons. Ichiro has established a number of batting records, including MLB's single-season record for hits with 262. He had 10 consecutive 200-hit seasons, the longest streak by any player, surpassing Wee Willie Keeler's streak of eight.Baseball’s Top 100: The Game’s Greatest Records, p.46, Kerry Banks, 2010, Greystone Books, Vancouver, BC, ISBN 978-1-55365-507-7 (Pete Rose had ten non-consecutive 200-hit seasons.) Between his career hits in Japan's and America's major leagues, Ichiro stands at third place all-time in top-flight hits, trailing only Pete Rose and Ty Cobb.
Before playing in the MLB, Ichiro played nine years for the Orix Blue Wave in Japan's Pacific League. Posted by Orix after the 2000 season, Ichiro became Seattle's right fielder. The first Japanese-born position player to be signed to the major leagues,[tpl]cite web|title=48 players born in Japan|publisher=Baseball-Reference|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/bio/Japan_born.shtml|accessdate=2009-08-23[/tpl] Ichiro led the American League (AL) in batting average and stolen bases en route to being named AL Rookie of the Year and AL Most Valuable Player (MVP).
Ichiro is the first MLB player to enter the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame (The Golden Players Club). He is a ten-time All-Star and won the 2007 All-Star Game MVP Award for a three-hit performance that included the event's first-ever inside-the-park home run. Ichiro won a Gold Glove Award in each of his first ten years in the major leagues, and has had seven hitting streaks of 20 or more games, with a high of 27.

==Early life==

Ichiro grew up in the town of Toyoyama, a relatively small town just outside of Nagoya.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/28/sports/baseball/parents-of-ichiro-suzuki-showcase-his-baseball-start-and-career-in-museum.html|title=Museum Showcases Ichiro’s Baseball Career|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=September 25, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.aia.pref.aichi.jp/voice/no8/person-no8.html|title=A Seeker on the Diamond|publisher=Aichi Prefecture|accessdate=September 24, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.town.toyoyama.lg.jp/3tyousei/03tyoutyou/index.html|title=豊山町長 鈴木幸育 あいさつ(Greetings from Mayor Yukiyasu Suzuki)|publisher=Town of Toyoyama|language=Japanese|accessdate=September 25, 2012[/tpl] At the age of seven, Ichiro joined his first baseball team and asked his father, Nobuyuki Suzuki (Suzuki Nobuyuki), to teach him to be a better player. The two began a daily routine which included throwing 50 pitches, fielding 50 infield balls and 50 outfield balls, and hitting 500 pitches, 250 from a pitching machine and 250 from his father.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

As a little leaguer in Toyoyama,[tpl]cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/mariners/2017819559_ichiro23.html|title=Ichiro museum opens window to Japan's baseball icon|publisher=Seattle Times|accessdate=September 25, 2012[/tpl] Ichiro had the word [tpl]Nihongo|"concentration"|集中|shūchū[/tpl] written on his glove. All of the little leaguers on his team in Japan nicknamed him "Baz", which means fast in Japanese. Little baz was tearing it up in the Japanese little league, and by age 12, he had dedicated himself to pursuing a career in professional baseball, and their training sessions were no longer for leisure, and less enjoyable. The elder Suzuki claimed, "Baseball was fun for both of us," but Ichiro later said, "It might have been fun for him, but for me it was a lot like Star of the Giants," a popular Japanese manga and anime series about a young baseball prospect's difficult road to success, with rigorous training demanded by the father. According to Ichiro, "It bordered on hazing and I suffered a lot."[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
When Ichiro joined his high school baseball team, his father told the coach, "No matter how good Ichiro is, don't ever praise him. We have to make him spiritually strong."[tpl]cite book|title=The Meaning of Ichiro|last=Whiting|first=Robert|year=2004|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=978-0-446-53192-4|url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Meaning-of-Ichiro/Robert-Whiting/e/9780446531924#CHP[/tpl] When he was ready to enter high school, Ichiro was selected by a school with a prestigious baseball program, Nagoya's Aikodai Meiden Kōkō. Ichiro was primarily used as a pitcher instead of as an outfielder, owing to his exceptionally strong arm. His cumulative high school batting average was .505, with 19 home runs. He built strength and stamina by hurling car tires and hitting Wiffle balls with a heavy shovel, among other regimens. These exercises helped develop his wrists and hips, adding power and endurance to his thin frame. Despite his outstanding numbers in high school, Ichiro was not drafted until the fourth and final round of the professional draft in November 1991, because many teams were discouraged by his small size of [tpl]convert|5|ft|9+1/2|in|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|124|lb[/tpl].(Whiting, 2004, pp. 2–12.)  (Years later, Ichiro told an interviewer, "I'm not a big guy and hopefully kids could look at me and see that I'm not muscular and not physically imposing, that I'm just a regular guy. So if somebody with a regular body can get into the record books, kids can look at that. That would make me happy.")[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/quotes/ichiro_suzuki_quotes.shtml |title=Ichiro Suzuki Quotes |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-31[/tpl]

==Career in Japan==

Ichiro made his Pacific League debut in 1992 at the age of 18, but he spent most of his first two seasons in the farm system because his then-manager, Shōzō Doi, refused to accept Ichiro's unorthodox swing. The swing was nicknamed [tpl]Nihongo|'pendulum'|振り子打法|Furiko Dahō[/tpl] because of the pendulum-like motion of his leg, which shifts his weight forward as he swung the bat, and goes against conventional hitting theory. Even though he hit a home run off Hideo Nomo, who later won a National league Rookie of the Year Award as a Dodger, Ichiro was sent back to the farm system on that very day. In 1994 he benefited from the arrival of a new manager, Akira Ōgi, who played him every day in the second spot of the lineup. He was eventually moved to the leadoff spot for the Blue Wave, where his immediate productivity dissolved any misgivings about his unconventional swing. He set a Japanese single-season record with 210 hits, the first player ever to top 200 hits in a single season.  (Three players have since done so.  Ichiro's record was eventually surpassed in 2010 by former major leaguer Matt Murton, who had 214 hits in a 144-game season.  Ichiro's 210 hits had come in a 130-game season.)
Ichiro's .385 batting average was a Pacific League record and won the young outfielder the first of a record seven consecutive batting titles. Ichiro also hit 13 home runs and had 29 stolen bases, helping him to earn his first of three straight Pacific League MVP (Most Valuable Player) awards.
It was during the 1994 season that he began to use his given name, "Ichiro", instead of his family name, "Suzuki", on the back of his uniform. Suzuki is the second most common family name in Japan, and his manager introduced the idea as a publicity stunt to help create a new image for what had been a relatively weak team, as well as a way to distinguish their rising star. Initially, Ichiro disliked the practice and was embarrassed by it; however, "Ichiro" was a household name by the end of the season and he was flooded with endorsement offers.
In 1995 Ichiro led the Blue Wave to its first Pacific League pennant in 12 years. In addition to his second batting title, he led the league with 80 RBI, 25 home runs, and 49 stolen bases. By this time the Japanese press had begun calling him the [tpl]Nihongo|"Hit Manufacturing Machine"|安打製造機|Anda Seizōki[/tpl]. The following year with Ichiro winning his third straight MVP award the team defeated the Central League champion, Yomiuri Giants, in the Japan Series. Following the 1996 season playing in an exhibition series against a visiting team of Major League All-Stars kindled Ichiro's desire to travel to the United States to play in the Major Leagues.
In November 1998 Ichiro participated in a seven-game exhibition series between Japanese and American all-stars. Ichiro batted .380 and collected seven stolen bases in the series, winning praise from several of his MLB counterparts including Sammy Sosa and Jamie Moyer (who would become his teammate with the Mariners).
In 2000 Ichiro was still a year away from being eligible for free agency, but the Blue Wave was no longer among Japan's best teams. Because the team would probably not be able to afford to keep him, and would lose him without compensation in another year, Orix allowed him to negotiate with Major League clubs. Ichiro used the posting system, and the Seattle Mariners won the right to negotiate with him with a bid of approximately $13 million.[tpl]cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/01/22/news/column_sportsbiz/ | title=The latest Japanese import |publisher=CNN| last=Isidore | first=Chris | date=January 22, 2002 | accessdate = 2009-08-23[/tpl] In November, Ichiro signed a three-year, $14 million contract with the Seattle Mariners. In his nine seasons in Japan, Ichiro had 1,278 hits, a .353 career batting average, and won seven Golden Glove Awards. Ichiro's time in the Japanese baseball leagues matured him as a player and a person, and he often credits it to his current success.

==Career in the United States==

===Seattle Mariners (2001–2012)===

====2001====

Ichiro's move to the United States was viewed with some interest because he was the first Japanese position player to play for a Major League Baseball team. In the same way that many Japanese teams had considered the 18-year-old Ichiro too small to draft in 1992, many in the US believed he would prove too frail to succeed against Major League pitching or endure the longer 162-game season. Ichiro made an auspicious debut with Seattle, and in the Mariners' eighth game revealed his tremendous throwing arm by gunning down Oakland's Terrence Long, who had tried to advance from first to third on a teammate's single to right field. That play would be dubbed "The Throw" by Japanese media covering Ichiro's progress.
After expressing no preference as to a uniform number, Ichiro was issued #51 by the Mariners.  He was initially hesitant because it had previously been worn by pitching star Randy Johnson.  To avoid insulting Johnson, Ichiro sent a personal message to the pitcher promising not to "bring shame" to the uniform. His trepidation was unfounded, as he had a remarkable 2001 season, accumulating a rookie-record 242 hits, the most by any MLB player since 1930.  His perennial Gold Glove fielding led Safeco's right field to be dubbed "Area 51".
With a .350 batting average and 56 stolen bases, Ichiro was the first player to lead his league in both categories since Jackie Robinson in 1949.  The season included hitting streaks of 25 and 23 games, an appearance on the cover of Sports Illustrated, and intense media attention on both sides of the Pacific. Fans from Japan were taking $2,000 baseball tours, sometimes flying in and out of the U.S. just to watch Ichiro's games.  More than 150 Japanese reporters and photographers were given media access.  Safeco Field's sushi stands began selling "Ichirolls".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/01play/2001-10-18-alcs-notebook.htm|title=ALCS notebook: Sincere in Seattle|last=Borelli|first=Stephen|date=January 18, 2002|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-09-23[/tpl]
Aided by Major League Baseball's decision to allow All-Star voting in Japan, Ichiro was the first rookie to lead all players in voting for the All-Star Game. That winter, he won the American League Most Valuable Player and the Rookie of the Year awards, becoming only the second player in MLB history (after Fred Lynn) to receive both honors in the same season. Ichiro is also the only player in major league history to have won an MVP, Rookie of the Year, Gold Glove Award, Silver Slugger Award, all while starting in the All-Star Game in the same season.
2001 had been an exceptionally successful regular season for the Seattle Mariners as a team, as they matched the 1906 Chicago Cubs' Major League record of 116 wins.Games Won by Teams records at Baseball Almanac In his only postseason appearance with the Mariners, Ichiro continued his hot hitting into the playoffs, batting .600 in the ALDS against the Cleveland Indians.  However, Seattle's stellar season ended against the New York Yankees in the ALCS, as Ichiro was held to a .222 average.  Yankees manager Joe Torre had emphasized to his pitchers, "Do not let Ichiro beat you. He is the key to Seattle's offense."  Informed of this assessment, Ichiro said, "If that is true, it would give me great joy. I don't believe he is right."

====2002–2003====

Ichiro finished his second year in American baseball with 208 total hits, making him the first Mariners player ever to hit two consecutive seasons with 200+ hits.  He got off to a hot start in 2002, but a late-season slump drove his batting average down to .321, 29 points below his batting average as a rookie. He was the 6th player in MLB history to start a career with two 200-hit seasons. Ichiro finished the season second in the AL in hits, 4th in batting average, and 4th in steals. Ichiro led the major league All-Star balloting for the second straight year. Although the Mariners had a 93–69 record, that was only good for a third-place finish in the competitive AL West.
2003 was much the same. Ichiro became just the third player in history to begin his career with three 200-hit seasons, by garnering 212 hits. He again finished in the top ten for hits, batting average, steals and runs, and, again, a late season slump brought his average down almost 40 points (to .312). Ichiro was elected to his third All Star game in the three years he had been in the league, and he was again the vote leader in both leagues. However, the second-place Mariners again fell short of the playoffs.

====2004====

Ichiro had his best offensive season to date in 2004, highlighted by his breaking of George Sisler's 84-year-old record for most hits (257) in a season. An increase in games played benefited Ichiro as he only accumulated 251 hits through the first 154 games of the season.
Ichiro recorded 50 hits in four different months of the year (September and October are combined by MLB for this computational purpose), becoming the first player ever to have 4 in a season.  With 51 hits in August 2001, Ichiro joined Pete Rose as the only players with five 50-hit months in a career. On May 21, 2004, Ichiro recorded his 2,000th professional hit. His 200th hit of 2004 came in just his 126th game.  By the end of September, with just one 3-game series remaining, Ichiro's hit total stood at 256—one shy of Sisler. Ichiro singled off the Rangers' Ryan Drese on October 1 to tie Sisler's record.  In the third inning, on a 3–2 count, Ichiro singled up the middle for his 258th hit of the year. Mariners announcer Dave Niehaus called the moment, which Ichiro later called "the greatest moment of my baseball career":
He was greeted by a swarm of teammates, and a standing ovation from the fans. Sisler's daughter, Francis Sisler Drochelman had attended the game, and was greeted by Ichiro after his hit. Ichiro would finish the 2004 season with a record 262 hits, giving him the single-season records for both the United States and Japanese baseball.
In July 2009, while in St. Louis for his ninth All-Star appearance, Ichiro made a trip to Sisler's grave.  He later told reporters, "There’s not many chances to come to St. Louis. In 2004, it was the first time I crossed paths with him, and his family generously came all the way to Seattle. Above all, it was a chance.  I wanted to do that for a grand upperclassman of the baseball world. I think it’s only natural for someone to want to do that, to express my feelings in that way. I’m not sure if he’s happy about it."Ichiro visits Sisler's grave, ESPN.com, July 15, 2009
Between 2001 and 2004, Ichiro had more hits, 924, than anyone in history over any four-year period, breaking the record of 918 that Bill Terry accumulated between 1929 and 1932, however, Terry played in 34 fewer games than Ichiro during their respective four-year spans.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/baseball/mlb/10/01/bc.bba.suzuki.hitsrecor.ap/index.html|title=Ichiro breaks single-season hits record|author=Unknown|agency=Associated Press|date=October 1, 2004|accessdate=2008-11-07[/tpl]  He would later surpass his own mark by recording 930 hits from 2004 to 2007.  During one 56-game stretch in 2004, Ichiro batted over .450. By comparison, Joe DiMaggio batted .408 during his record-setting 56-game hitting streak. Ichiro batted over .400 against left-handed pitching in 2004.

====2005====

During the off-season, then-manager Bob Melvin's contract was not extended and the Mariners brought in Mike Hargrove as the new manager with a contract through 2007. Ironically, it was Hargrove who predicted that Ichiro would be no better than "a fourth outfielder on American major league team" back when Ichiro was still in Japan.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/20/sports/20iht-base.t_9.html | title=Taken by Sosa, Japanese Star Dreams of Playing in U.S. |work=International Herald Tribune | last=Noonan | first=Tim | date=November 20, 1998 | accessdate = 2009-08-23[/tpl] Speculation started that Hargrove and Ichiro did not get along very well in the season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fannation.com/truth_and_rumors/view/10091 |title=Did Hargrove, Ichiro not get along? |publisher=FanNation |accessdate=2011-03-31[/tpl]
In 2005, Ichiro had his second worst year in his MLB career to date, collecting only 206 hits (the lowest total of his career to that point). However, he reached the plateau of a .300 batting average, 100+ runs, 30+ steals and 200+ hits for the fifth straight season. That allowed Ichiro to become the first player to collect 200 hits per season in each of his first five years in the Major Leagues. Only Willie Keeler, Wade Boggs, Chuck Klein, Al Simmons, and Charlie Gehringer had had five consecutive 200-hit seasons at any point in their careers. During the season he accumulated 1,000 career hits, reaching the career milestone faster than any other player in MLB history.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2417408|title=Pujoles ties Helton for second fastest to 1,000 hits|date=April 21, 2006|agency=AP|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=July 17, 2012[/tpl] Ichiro hit a career-high 15 home runs.  In the off-season, Ichiro played himself in Furuhata Ninzaburō, a Japanese Columbo-like TV drama that he loves.  In the drama, he kills a person and is arrested.

====Inaugural World Baseball Classic====

Ichiro played for the Japan national baseball team in the inaugural World Baseball Classic in March 2006. During the March 15 Japan-Korea game Ichiro was booed by a few spectators during every at-bat, reportedly in response to a previous statement that he wanted "to beat South Korea so badly, that the South Koreans won't want to play Japan for another 30 years."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/baseball/263231_japan16.html?source=mypi | title=Ichiro forced to eat words |publisher=Seattle P-I| last=D'Hippolito | first=Joseph | date=March 16, 2006 | accessdate = 2009-08-23[/tpl] That, however, was an incorrect translation mostly spread to the public through ESPN.  Ichiro was variously quoted as saying "I want to win in a way that the opponent would think, 'we cannot catch up with Japan for the coming 30 years'. We should not merely win the games."戦った相手が、「向こう30年は日本に手が出せないな」と、そんな感じで勝ちたい。勝つだけではいけないと思う [tpl]cite web| url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/sports/wbc06/news/20060302ie29.htm | title=イチロー「ただ勝つだけじゃ、つまらない」 | work=Yomiuri Shimbun| date=March 2, 2006[/tpl] Japan would later beat Korea in the playoffs and win the tournament after defeating Cuba in the finals, 10–6.[tpl]cite web| url=http://ww2.worldbaseballclassic.com/2006/news/recap.jsp?ymd=20060305&content_id=1334986&gameid=2006_03_05_korint_jpnint_1 | title=Korea upsets Japan in showdown | work=MLB.com| last=Street | first=Jim | date=March 5, 2006 | accessdate=2009-08-23[/tpl] For the tournament, Ichiro had twelve hits including a home run, seven runs, and four stolen bases.

====2006====

Ichiro's 2006 season got off to an unexpected start, with the outfielder hitting as low as .177 in the season's third week. He quickly rebounded, finishing the season with a .322 average (6th in the AL and 11th in the Majors). Ichiro's 224 hits led the majors, and he recorded 110 runs and 45 stolen bases.  Remarkably, Ichiro was only caught stealing twice in 2006, for a 96% success rate. His 1,354 career U.S. hits topped Wade Boggs' record for the most hits in any six-year period.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/baseball/278894_mari26.html | title=Tough night at the yard | work=Seattle PI| last=Hickey | first=John | date=July 26, 2006 | accessdate = 2009-08-23[/tpl]  In his sixth year in the majors, Ichiro collected his sixth Gold Glove Award, and a sixth All-Star Game selection.  He also won a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding MLB right fielder.[tpl]cite web|title=The 2006 Fielding Bible Awards|url=http://www.billjamesonline.net/fieldingbible/the-2006-winners.asp|publisher=The Fielding Bible|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uJezKBUY|archivedate=November 17, 2010|accessdate=November 18, 2010[/tpl] Ichiro has worn high stocking baseball pants for every game since the 2006 season.

====2007–2008====

In May and June, Ichiro hit in 25 consecutive games, breaking the previous Seattle Mariners record set by Joey Cora in 1997. Ichiro broke Tim Raines' American League record by stealing 41 consecutive bases without being caught. Ichiro extended the record to 45; the major league record of 50 belongs to Vince Coleman.
On July 10, 2007, he became the first player to hit an inside-the-park home run in any MLB All-Star Game after an unpredictable hop off the right field wall of AT&T Park in San Francisco. It was the first inside-the-park home run of Ichiro's professional career.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/allstar07/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&id=2932445|title=Ichiro takes roundtrip to All-Star history|accessdate=2007-07-11|date=July 11, 2007|author=Stark, Jayson|publisher=ESPN.com[/tpl] Ichiro was a perfect 3-for-3 in the game and was named the Most Valuable Player in the American League's 5–4 victory.
2007 marked the end of Ichiro's second contract with the Mariners, and he initially told MLB.com that he would likely enter the free agent market, citing the team's lack of success in recent years. However, in July Ichiro signed a five-year contract extension with Seattle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://seattle.mariners.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070713&content_id=2084095&vkey=news_sea&fext=.jsp&c_id=sea|title= Ichiro signs five-year deal with Mariners |accessdate=2007-07-13|date=July 13, 2007|author=Brown, Patrick|publisher=MLB.com[/tpl] The deal was reported to be worth $90 million, consisting of a $17 million annual salary and $5 million signing bonus.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2935612|title=Mariners sign Ichiro through 2012 season|accessdate=2007-07-15|date=July 13, 2007|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN.com[/tpl]
The Associated Press reported that Ichiro's contract extension defers $25 million of the $90 million at 5.5% interest until after his retirement, with payments through 2032. Other provisions in Ichiro's contract include a yearly housing allowance of more than $30,000, and four first-class round-trip tickets to Japan each year for his family. He is provided with either a new Jeep or Mercedes SUV, as well as a personal trainer and interpreter.
On July 29, 2007, Ichiro collected his 1,500th U.S. hit, the third fastest to reach the MLB milestone behind Al Simmons and George Sisler.  Ichiro had 213 hits in 2008, his eighth straight 200-hit season.  This tied the 107-year-old record set by Wee Willie Keeler. Typically, Ichiro was among baseball's leaders in reaching base on an error (14 times in 2008, more than any other batter in the AL), and in infield hits (his 56 were the most in the majors).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-baserunning-batting.shtml |title=2008 Major League Baseball Baserunning/Misc |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-31[/tpl] Ichiro has amassed more than 450 infield hits in his U.S. career.  Detroit third baseman Brandon Inge told the New York Times, "I wish you could put a camera at third base to see how he hits the ball and see the way it deceives you. You can call some guys’ infield hits cheap, but not his.  He has amazing technique."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/sports/baseball/23ichiro.html?_r=2 | work=The New York Times | title=Mariners' Suzuki on a First-Name Basis With Records | first=Brad | last=Lefton | date=August 23, 2009 | accessdate=2010-05-05[/tpl]  In May 2008, Ichiro stole two bases, giving him a career total of 292, surpassing the previous Seattle Mariners team record of 290 set by second baseman Julio Cruz. Cruz, who now does Spanish-language broadcasts of Mariners games, was watching from the broadcast booth as Ichiro broke his record.
On July 29, 2008 Ichiro became the second-youngest player to amass 3,000 top-level professional hits (1,278 in Japan + 1,722 in the U.S.) after Ty Cobb.  He also became just the second Japanese professional to get 3,000 hits.  (Nippon Professional Baseball's record holder is Isao Harimoto, with 3,085 hits.)[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.www.infoseek.co.jp/topics/sports/n_ichiro2__20080730_36/story/30kyodo2008073001000137|title=イチロー、通算3千安打達成 張本に次いで2人目|accessdate=2008-07-29|date=July 30, 2008|language=Japanese[/tpl]  Ichiro has 538 stolen bases in his professional career, including 199 in Japan.
By 2008, it had emerged in the media that Ichiro was known within baseball for his tradition of exhorting the American League team with a profanity-laced pregame speech in the clubhouse prior to the MLB All-Star Game.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=jp-ichirospeech071508&prov=yhoo&type=lgns|title=Ichiro’s speech to All-Stars revealed|author=Jeff Passan|work=Yahoo! Sports|publisher=Yahoo.com|date=July 15, 2008[/tpl] Asked if the speech had had any effect on the AL's decade-long winning streak, Ichiro deadpanned, "I’ve got to say over 90 percent." Minnesota first baseman Justin Morneau describes the effect: "If you’ve never seen it, it’s definitely something pretty funny. It’s hard to explain, the effect it has on everyone. It’s such a tense environment. Everyone’s a little nervous for the game, and then he comes out. He doesn’t say a whole lot the whole time he’s in there, and all of a sudden, the manager gets done with his speech, and he pops off.” Boston's slugger David Ortiz says simply, "It’s why we win."

====2009 World Baseball Classic====

Despite struggling uncharacteristically during most of the tournament, Ichiro provided the game-winning hit in the Championship game against South Korea. With two outs in the top of the tenth inning, he broke a 3–3 tie with a two-run single.  This would prove to be the margin of victory in Japan's 5–3 defeat of South Korea. Ichiro ended the night 4-for-6, and is now 6-for-10 in WBC championship games.

====2009====

Ichiro began his 2009 season by going on the disabled list for the first time in his career. He had a bleeding ulcer, which team doctor Mitch Storey said may have been caused in part by the stress of playing in the World Baseball Classic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/sports/2008979491_ichiro04.html|title=Ichiro had bleeding ulcer, will start season on disabled list|work=Seattle Times|date=April 4, 2009[/tpl] After missing 8 games, Ichiro debuted on April 15 and went 2-for-5 against the Angels, including a grand slam for his 3,085th career hit. The home run matched Isao Harimoto's Japanese record for career hits, and Harimoto had been flown out to Seattle to witness the event.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2009-04-16-mariners-angels_N.htm|title=Griffey, Ichiro go yard, make history as Mariners roll over Angels|work=USA Today|date=April 17, 2009|accessdate=July 23, 2012[/tpl] Ichiro surpassed the record the following night.
Ichiro was named #30 on the Sporting News' 2009 list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, voted upon by a 100-person panel of experts and former stars. In May and June, Ichiro surpassed his own franchise record with a 27-game hitting streak. Ichiro went on to record 44 hits in June 2009, his 20th career month with 40 or more hits. The previous players to have accomplished this were Stan Musial in the NL and Lou Gehrig in the AL.
On September 6, Ichiro collected his 2,000th MLB hit on the second pitch of the game, a double along the first base foul line. He is the second-fastest player to reach the milestone, behind Al Simmons. On September 13 against the Texas Rangers, Ichiro collected his 200th hit of the season for the ninth consecutive year, setting an all-time major league record. Suzuki recorded 210 hits with Orix in 1994, thereby giving him a total of ten 200 hit seasons in his professional career.
With two outs in the bottom of the 9th inning, September 18, Ichiro hit a walk-off, two-run home run against Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, scoring Michael Saunders in one of the more memorable victories of the season. His homer made a winner out of Felix Hernandez, who was in line for the loss despite having allowed only one run in 9 innings pitched.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SEA/SEA200909180.shtml|title=September 18, 2009 New York Yankees at Seattle Mariners Box Score[/tpl]
On September 26, 2009, Ichiro was ejected from a game for the first time in his professional career. Arguing that a strikeout pitch from Toronto's David Purcey had been outside, Ichiro used his bat to draw a line on the outer edge of the plate, and was immediately tossed by umpire Brian Runge. He was the only Mariner to be ejected from a game all season.[tpl]cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2009/09/say-it-aint-so-ichiro-tossed-from-a-game.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=The Fabulous Forum | date=September 26, 2009 | accessdate=2010-05-05[/tpl]Mariners' Suzuki ejected for 1st time in career  The ejection may have hurt Ichiro's chances regarding an esoteric record: the longest playing streak without going hitless in consecutive games.  Ichiro's stretch was at 180 games, the longest in the majors since Doc Cramer went 191 consecutive games without back-to-back 0-fers in 1934–35.  Ichiro went hitless in the following afternoon's game.

====2010====

Ichiro's 32 career leadoff home runs rank ninth all time.  Nevertheless, in 2009, Ichiro told the New York Times:
After playing in the season opener against the Oakland Athletics, Ichiro became eligible for Hall of Fame consideration, by playing in his tenth MLB season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100406&content_id=9109220&notebook_id=9109756&vkey=notebook_sea&fext=.jsp&c_id=sea|title=Ichiro eligible for Hall consideration|last=Street|first=Jim|date=April 6, 2010|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=2010-04-08[/tpl] On June 5, 2010, Ichiro scored his 1,000th career MLB run against the Angels on Franklin Gutierrez's RBI groundout. He is the third Mariner in history to reach that milestone. On September 1, 2010, Ichiro also collected his 2,200th hit, a leadoff infield single against Cleveland Indians pitcher Josh Tomlin.
During the August 2010 series against the New York Yankees, Ichiro traveled to the Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York, to pay his respects at the grave of Hall-of-Famer "Wee Willie" Keeler.Dave Neihaus, FSNW television broadcast of Seattle Mariners vs New York Yankees, August 21, 2010
On September 23, Ichiro hit a single to center field against Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Shawn Hill to become the first MLB player in history to reach the 200 hit mark for 10 consecutive seasons. This feat also tied him with Pete Rose for the most career seasons of 200+ hits, and he surpassed Ty Cobb for most career seasons of 200+ hits in the AL. He finished the season with 214 hits, topping the MLB in that category. Suzuki also finished the season "ironman" style, playing in all 162 games. Only Ichiro and Matt Kemp did so for the 2010 season. This was Ichiro's 3rd season playing in all 162 games. Also, Ichiro was nominated for the This Year in Baseball Award.[tpl]cite web|url=http://seattle.mariners.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101013&content_id=15614006&vkey=news_sea&c_id=sea |title=Ichiro, King Felix up for TYIB Awards |publisher=Seattle.mariners.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-31[/tpl]  Ichiro finished first or second in hits in all of his first 10 MLB seasons.

On July 10, manager Eric Wedge did not start Ichiro, ending his then-major league-best active streak of 255 consecutive starts.

===New York Yankees===

Ichiro approached the Mariners to ask for a trade at midseason in 2012, as he felt guilty for taking a roster spot from a younger player while his team was in a rebuilding process. His first choice was to play for the New York Yankees. The Mariners traded him to the Yankees for minor league pitchers D. J. Mitchell and Danny Farquhar on July 23. Seattle also received cash in the trade. Ichiro left Seattle hitting .261 with a .288 on-base percentage (OBP), four home runs, 28 RBIs and 15 stolen bases in 95 games. His first game as a Yankee was played the night of the trade, at Safeco Field against the Mariners.[tpl]cite news|last=Berry|first=Adam|title=Mariners trade Ichiro to Yanks for two prospects|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120723&content_id=35428210&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb|accessdate=July 23, 2012|newspaper=MLB.com|date=July 23, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://tracking.si.com/2012/07/23/ichiro-trade-yankees/|title=Ichiro traded to Yankees|work=Sports Illustrated|date=July 23, 2012|accessdate=July 23, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/yankees-acquire-10-time-all-star-ichiro-suzuki-seattle-mariners-pitching-prospects-article-1.1120383|title=Yankees acquire 10-time All-Star Ichiro Suzuki from the Seattle Mariners for two pitching prospects|work=NY Daily News|date=July 23, 2012|accessdate=July 23, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Waldstein|first=David|title=Suzuki Soaks in the Postseason After a Decade Away From It|date=October 8, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/sports/baseball/at-38-ichiro-suzuki-soaks-in-the-postseason.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BfBj2AzT|archivedate=October 24, 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl] Before the trade was consummated, Ichiro agreed to the Yankees' conditions, which stated that they would play Ichiro primarily in left field, bat him at the bottom of the lineup, and occasionally sit him against left-handed pitching.[tpl]cite web|author=Wallace MatthewsESPNNewYork.comFollowArchive |url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/8195019/new-york-yankees-ichiro-suzuki-made-concessions-agreeing-trade |title=New York Yankees' Ichiro Suzuki made concessions before agreeing to trade – ESPN New York |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=July 24, 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-24[/tpl] Ichiro would go on to hit safely in his first 12 games as a Yankee, tying a record set by Don Slaught.[tpl]cite news|url=http://web.yesnetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121219&content_id=40753838&oid=36019 |title=Yankees officially announce Ichiro signing |publisher=Web.yesnetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-28[/tpl]

With his improved performance, the Yankees at times batted him second and also started him against left-handers.
Ichiro performed well in his first playoff appearance since the beginning of his career. Against the Baltimore Orioles in the 2012 ALDS, Ichiro ran home on a ball hit by Robinson Cano. Despite the ball beating him to the plate, Orioles catcher Matt Wieters had difficulty tagging Ichiro, who evaded multiple tag attempts by jumping over and around Wieters. In Game 1 of the 2012 ALCS, Ichiro hit his first career postseason home run; however, the Yankees lost the series to the Detroit Tigers in only 4 games.

On June 25, 2013, Ichiro hit a walk-off, home run against Rangers pitcher Tanner Scheppers with two outs in the bottom of the 9th inning.  Earlier in the game, three of his teammates had led off the 4th, 5th and 6th innings with home runs, so all of the Yankees' runs in the game were provided by solo home runs.
On August 21, 2013, Ichiro collected his 4,000th professional career hit with a single off Toronto Blue Jays pitcher R.A. Dickey; becoming the seventh player in professional baseball history known to have reached the mark after Pete Rose, Ty Cobb, Julio Franco, Hank Aaron, Jigger Statz, and Stan Musial. Jake Beckley and Sam Crawford may also have hit 4,000, but data for some of their minor league seasons is missing.Ichiro Suzuki to reach remarkable 4,000-hit milestone - ESPNChasing 4000 : baseballmusings.com

==Playing style==

Sportswriter Bruce Jenkins, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, described Ichiro's distinctive style of play:
While he is known for his hitting ability, he does not draw many walks. In 2004, when he set the single-season record for hits, his low walk total (49) led to him being on base a total of 315 times. It was the 58th-most times a player has reached base in a season and short of the major league record of 379 set by Babe Ruth in 1923.[tpl]cite news |last=Hoffman |first=Benjamin |title=With Suzuki, There’s Less Than Meets the Eye |date=July 10, 2011 | newspaper=The New York Times |page=SP5 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/sports/baseball/with-ichiro-suzuki-theres-less-than-meets-the-eye.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=ichiro&st=cse |archiveurl=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/sports/baseball/with-ichiro-suzuki-theres-less-than-meets-the-eye.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=ichiro&st=cse |archivedate=July 11, 2011[/tpl]
Ichiro has a home run batting stroke that he displays in batting practice, but not in games. The New York Times criticized his inability to improve his power when his Mariner teams were often low-scoring while noting that he also did not steal bases as frequently as Rickey Henderson or Tim Raines. Ichiro, however, once commented, "If I'm allowed to hit .220, I could probably hit 40 runs, but nobody wants that."

==Personality and influence==

Ichiro is noted for his work ethic in arriving early for his team's games, and for his calisthenic stretching exercises to stay limber even during the middle of the game. Continuing in Seattle the custom he began in Japan, he used his given name on the back of his uniform instead of his family name, becoming the first player in Major League Baseball to do so since Vida Blue; the custom ended with his trade to the Yankees in 2012, as the Yankees do not include players' names on their jerseys.
In addition to being a ten-time Gold Glove winner, Ichiro is a ten-time All-Star selection from 2001 to 2010. His success has been credited with opening the door for other Japanese players like former Yomiuri Giants slugger Hideki Matsui, former Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks catcher Kenji Johjima, former teammate So Taguchi, and former Seibu Lions infielder Kazuo Matsui to enter the Major Leagues. Ichiro's career is followed closely in Japan, with national television news programs covering each of his at-bats, and with special tour packages arranged for Japanese fans to visit the United States to attend his games.
Ichiro's agent Tony Attanasio described his client's status: "When you mail Ichiro something from the States, you only have to use that name on the address and he gets it Japan. He's that big."

==Personal life==

The Japanese name "Ichiro" is often written 一郎, meaning "first son". Ichiro's name, however, is written with a different character, 一朗, so that his name roughly means "brightest, most cheerful". He has an elder brother, Kazuyasu Suzuki, who is a fashion designer.
