The single is the last Ash release Charlotte Hatherley would have contributed to, despite having left the band a year prior to the single's release. She is credited to providing guitar, Fender Rhodes, and backing vocal parts for the track "Seventh Circle". The track was recorded during sessions for the Meltdown album, and was held over because it didn't fit the album's motif. The song was previously tentatively named "Singapore Song" as it was written while the band were touring Free All Angels in Singapore.
"Statis in Darkness" is a leftover b-side from Free All Angels.
