CATEGORIES: Latin poems, Ancient Roman erotic literature

Pervigilium Veneris, the Vigil of Venus, is a Latin poem of uncertain date, variously assigned to the 2nd, 4th or 5th centuries. It is sometimes thought to have been by the poet Tiberianus, because of strong similarities with his poem Amnis ibat, though other scholars attribute it to Publius Annius Florus, and yet others find no sufficient evidence for any attribution.On the text see John William Mackail in Journal of Philology (1888), Vol. xvii.[tpl]cite book |last1=Korhonen |first1=Kalle |date= |year=2012 |chapter=Sicily in the Roman Imperial period: Language and society |editor1-last=Tribulato |editor1-first=Olga |title=Language and Linguistic Contact in Ancient Sicily |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uGAhAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA406&dq=%22tiberianus%22+%22pervigilium+veneris%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=s1ljU4XAKYnDPNDHgOAM&ved=0CFgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22tiberianus%22%20%22pervigilium%20veneris%22&f=false |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=360 |isbn=9781107029316 |accessdate=2 May 2014 [/tpl] It was written professedly in early spring on the eve of a three-night festival of Venus (probably April 1–3) in a setting that seems to be Sicily. The poem describes the annual awakening of the vegetable and animal world through the "benign post-Lucretian" goddess,"la benigna dea post-Lucreziana" (i.e., the Venus genetrix derived from Lucretius's De Rerum Natura), see Andrea Cucchiarelli, La Veglia di Venere: Pervigilium Veneris (Milano: BUR Classici Greci e Latini, Rizzoli: 2003), p. 7. which contrasts with the tragic isolation of the silent "I" of the poet/speaker against the desolate background of a ruined city, a vision that prompts Andrea Cuccchiarelli to note the resemblance of the poem's construction to the cruelty of a dream.Cucchiarelli (2003), p. 7. It is notable because of its focus on the natural world – something never before seen in Roman poetry – which marks the transition from Roman poetry to Medieval poetry. It consists of ninety-three verses in trochaic septenarius, and is divided into strophes of unequal length by the refrain:

''Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit cras amet.
Let him love tomorrow who has never loved, and let him who has loved love tomorrow.

The poem ends with the nightingale’s song, and a poignant expression of personal sorrow:

illa cantat; nos tacemus; quando ver venit meum?
She sings; I am silent; when will my springtime come?
