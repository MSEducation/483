</ref> According to A. Zahoor, in the 11th century, the Persian [[polymath]] scholar [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] described the [[Milky Way]] galaxy as a multitude of fragments having the properties of [[nebula|nebulous]] stars, and also gave the [[latitude]]s of various stars during a [[lunar eclipse]] in 1019.<ref>

According to Josep Puig, the Andalusian astronomer Ibn Bajjah proposed that the Milky Way was made up of many stars which almost touched one another and appeared to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction from sublunary material, citing his observation of the conjunction of Jupiter and Mars on 500 AH (1106/1107 AD) as evidence.[ref]

Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe identified new stars in the night sky (later termed novae), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584 Giordano Bruno suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus,[ref]
