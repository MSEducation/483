Schwäbisch Hall, a historic German town, was attacked by 24 American Liberator bombers on 23 February 1945 during World War II. Three smaller attacks followed. On 25 February 1945, 53 civilians died and the old bridge collapsed. Then, and on 17 April 1945, the old Rathaus was reduced by incendiary bombs to rubble. Though several buildings were destroyed or damaged, the historical old town suffered comparatively little.
Altogether, the great majority of houses in the city survived the war without any damage, so still today the spectacular medieval houses can be admired.
