Little Amy is a 1962 failed television pilot written by Norman Paul and starring Debbie Megowan. Other cast members include Bill Leslie, Shary Marshall, and Jack Nicholson in a small part as a football coach. 
It was filmed at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios and was produced by the CBS Television Network. The failed pilot is widely considered[tpl]By whom|date=December 2009[/tpl] to be based on the popular cartoon series Little Audrey, which, in turn, was based on the comic panel and comic books of Little Lulu.

As was common practice at the time, it was broadcast in 1962 during the summer as part of a "anthology" series consisting of failed TV pilots. As with most United States works published before 1963 without a copyright renewal, the pilot is now considered to be public domain in the US.
It was released on DVD in 2008 by Alpha Video, on a DVD called Lost TV Comedy.
