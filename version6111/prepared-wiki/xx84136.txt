</ref> As with the rest of the first round of Wu-Tang albums, RZA would recreate the distinct "Shaolin" sound while tailoring it to the featured rapper. On ''Tical'', his production was especially gritty, dark and murky, complementing both Method Man's distinctly smooth-yet-rugged voice and his raps of [[cannabis smoking]], [[Public housing in the United States|project]] love, and traditional [[hardcore hip hop]] lyricism. During this time period of the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA was the sole provider of beats for all of its members, whom he would then have [[rap battle|battle]] over the rights to record over them. This competitive approach to quality control would result in ''Tical'''s "Meth vs. Chef", a recorded battle between Method Man and [[Raekwon]].<ref name="Days"/> "Meth vs. Chef" was recorded in 1993 before RZA's 36 Chambers Studios was flooded, destroying reportedly fifteen beats per Wu-Tang Clan rapper.<ref name="Days"/> Many of the beats for ''Tical'' would be hastily recreated, and mixed.<ref name="Days"/>

In 1994 the lead single "Bring the Pain" (backed with "P.L.O. Style") was released. "Bring the Pain" was a RZA-produced track with an understated but funky groove, capped with the ragga vocals of Booster. The single would reach number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 1 on the Hot Dance chart. The follow-up single, 1995's "Release Yo' Delf", was a more upbeat track, and featured Wu-affiliate Blue Raspberry singing an interpolation  of Gloria Gaynor's disco anthem, "I Will Survive". "Release Yo' Delf" reached number 98 on the Hot 100, failing to match the success of "Bring The Pain". Tical however, remains the only Method Man album with two singles reaching the Billboard Hot 100.
To continue the album's promotion, "All I Need" was remixed and released in the summer of 1995 as "I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By". There are two versions of this song: the album version by the RZA, and the remix by Puff Daddy, which features Mary J. Blige.  Puff Daddy's version proved to be more successful, with its accompanying music video aiding the song to reach number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number one on the Hot Rap, Dance and R&B charts.[tpl]cite web | last = | first = | url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p143163/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes[/tpl] | title = Method Man Billboard Singles at AllMusic.com | format =  | work = | publisher = | accessdate = November 18, 2006[/tpl] The Puff Daddy remix also won the two a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 1996.

==Reception==

===Initial reaction===

Tical was well received by most music critics. Tracy E. Hopkins from Entertainment Weekly stated "Method Man proves to be one of rap's most formidable players. On his solo outing, Tical, the Wu-Tang Clan's standout MC wages lyrical warfare. His gripping rhymes creep out of the darkness and take listeners hostage". Melody Maker wrote "Meth comes correct with this beamed-down-from-Planet-Mars making music that's way darker and more disorienting than was previously thought possible". NME commented "The East coast hip hop renaissance continues apace... supremely laid-back, mooching along at a bass-weighted amble, whether it's framing the monogamous lover's lament of "All I Need" or the 'I Will Survive' hook of "Release Yo Self". Rolling Stone praised the album's singles, but stated "It's with its heaviest numbers that Tical delivers the primo goods". Writing for The Source, Mitchell Pierce described the album's production as "dark bass and distorted wails that sound like someone is being hacked to death". Pierce concluded "Tical combines verbal terrorism, tenebrous grooves and home-demo lunacy to produce a gritty production". Michael A. Gonzales from Vibe magazine described Tical as "Incredible", and further stated "The production wizardry and vocal complexity build with each listen."

===Retrospect===

Although Tical failed to achieve the critical success of several other Wu-Tang solo albums of its era, such as Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... and Liquid Swords, it has acquired a fair amount of acclaim over the years from various music writers and publications. In 1996, Select magazine ranked it number 28 on their 100 Best Albums of the 90s list, and in 1999, Ego Trip ranked it number 12 on their list of Hip Hop's 25 Greatest Albums by Year 1980-98. In a later review for Tical, Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic praised Method Man's charisma and RZA's production and stated "Tical strictly spotlights the group's two stars and does so with refreshingly straightforward flair. There's none of the epic overreaching that mars so many rap albums of the era; rather, there's just over a dozen tracks here, and they're filled to the brim with rhymes and beats and little else; no pop-crossover concessions, nor any heady experimentation for the sake of experimentation. Just good ol'-fashioned hip-hop, albeit with a dark, deranged twist". In 2005, Robert Dimery included Tical on his list of 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, and in 2008, Tom Moon included it on his 1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die list.
