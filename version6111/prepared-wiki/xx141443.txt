==Biography==

This group originally appeared in New York City as a punk-hybrid collective composed of Mike Linn (drums), Cezhan Ambrose (guitar), Joe Fiorentino (guitar), Nicole Lombardi (vocals, bass), and ML Platt (vocals). Spalding Rockwell continued on as female pop duo, composed of Nicole Lombardi (vocals, bass) and ML Platt (vocals, guitar, production).  Nicole Lombardi grew up in Washington, D.C.. ML Platt grew up in New York City. ML was primarily influenced by hip-hop, especially Black Sheep, Cypress Hill and Wu-Tang Clan. Later she was inspired by the likes of Jimi Hendrix. Nikki was influenced by the DC punk scene. The original punk-hybrid entity found its way to the record shelves renamed "DAUGHTER". "DAUGHTER" made one critically acclaimed record entitled "SKIN" which was distributed by AUM Fidelity Records.  Despite the success of SKIN, ultimately, Spalding Rockwell was more successful as an electronica duo.  Spalding Rockwell first gained attention as a featured act on Larry Teeâ€™s electroclash circuit and subsequently released "White Cotton Panties" on the 2002 Badd Inc. compilation. Their full-length LP Kate distributed by Defend Music in 2004 was entirely written, performed and produced by ML and Nikki. Most successful were their hit single collaborations with Armand Van Helden, "Hear My Name" which appeared on Van Helden's record "New York: A Mix Odyssey" in 2004 (released by Sony Southern Fried Records) and "Jenny" in 2005 (released by Ultra Records).
