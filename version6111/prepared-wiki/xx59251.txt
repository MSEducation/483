During World War II, it was called RAF Ringway, as a base for the Royal Air Force, and from 1975 until 1986, "Manchester International Airport". The airport is owned and managed by the Manchester Airports Group (MAG), a holding company owned by the ten metropolitan borough councils of Greater Manchester, with the Manchester City Council owning the largest stake. The airport has numerous transport links and is served by the M56 motorway and by the Manchester Airport railway station which provides extensive rail connections.
The airport regularly handled the supersonic transport Concorde and currently houses the British Airways G-BOAC flagship Concorde at the Manchester Runway Visitor Park. Ringway, which the airport was named after, still exists as a village with a few buildings and church at the southern edge of the airport. The airport currently handles 20.8 million passengers annually (2013) and spare capacity exists for up to 50 million passengers annually.[tpl]cite web |title=Transport Committee Written evidence from Manchester Airports Group (AS 44) |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmtran/78/78we30.htm |publisher=parliament.uk |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=2013-08-16[/tpl] Vacant land exists for expansion, future developments include the £800 million Manchester Airport City scheme aims to create logistics, manufacturing, office and hotel space adjacent to the airport. Future transport improvements include a new Metrolink tram line, fourth railway platform, High Speed 2 station and a dedicated relief road.

==History==

thumb|Circa 1925 map of the area where Manchester Airport and Wythenshawe now areManchester Airport (earlier called Ringway Airport) started construction on 28 November 1935 and opened partly in June 1937 and completely on 25 June 1938, in Ringway parish north of Wilmslow. Its north border was Yewtree Lane (on this map, the lane between Firtree Farm and The Grange, east of the crossroads marked "Ringway"). Its southeast border was a little west of Altrincham Road (Styal) (the lane from Oversleyford running northeast then east into the Styal area.)
During World War II it was the Royal Air Force's base  RAF Ringway, and was important in military aircraft production and training parachutists. After World War II, the base reverted to a civilian airport, and gradually expanded to its present size. Historically, Manchester Airport has consistently been the busiest airport after London Heathrow for a number of decades following the War.[tpl]Cite news |title=Southend Airport's revival gets under way |quote=It is hoped this will be the beginning of a comeback for the airport, which, during the Sixties, was Britain’s third-busiest, behind Heathrow and Manchester |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/9175631/Southend-Airports-revival-gets-under-way.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=30 March 2012 |accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl]
In 1972, the M56 motorway opened to the airport. By 1993, the airport railway station opened. From 1997 to 2001 its second runway was built, causing large-scale protests in the area.

===Future airport expansion===

As part of the Government's 'The Future of Air Transport' White Paper, Manchester Airport published its Master Plan on its proposed expansions until 2030. Demolition of older buildings, such as old storage buildings, the old Alpha Catering Building and Males Garage, to the east of Terminal 3 has already begun, to make way for a new apron and taxiway towards runway 05L/23R, and an eastwards extension of Terminal 3, which is planned to provide 15 more covered stands. A full-length parallel taxiway may be added to the second runway, and more crossing points added across the first runway to improve ground movements of aircraft.
Passenger flow on Terminal 1's gating piers is due to be realigned, with plans to redesign the piers so departures and arrivals do not contraflow on the same level, allowing larger seating areas at the gates, express retail outlets, and a dedicated lounge and gating area for future Airbus A380 flights. Currently, Gate 12, Pier B has been upgraded to accommodate the A380, the only gate at the airport that can handle this aircraft so far. An early phase of this has seen the removal of the South Bay remote aircraft stands, constructed in 1962 between taxiways Juliet and Kilo, and as a result more recently re-aligning taxiway Juliet into an extended taxiway Bravo.
Terminal 2 is due to receive a major extension, to encompass current remote stands to the west. A satellite terminal is also projected for Terminal 2. Between twelve and fifteen covered aircraft stands will be made available by this. An air side link for transferring passengers between Terminals 1 and 2 is at the planning stage, designed in an effort to boost Manchester's chances of becoming a major hub airport and minimise missed connections.
Terminal 3 acquired an extra security control area in November 2007, near check-in area C, dedicated to passengers travelling to Common Travel Area (CTA) destinations. In January 2008, the usage was extended to all Terminal 3 passengers, with the exception of those destined for Frankfurt, Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport and Brussels. This new security control area is now used for all departures from Terminal 3; the old security area has now closed and the area which it once covered is now part of the Terminal 3 air-side departure lounge, housing the retail outlets Accessorize and Dixons Travel.
There also plans to create a business centre to help encourage businesses to set up in Manchester.

===Expansion plans 2010 to 2030===

In June 2010, Manchester Airport issued a document "The Need for Land" about how it wants to expand over the next 20 years. This expansion plan has caused protests: see Stop Expansion at Manchester Airport (SEMA). The five affected areas are:

====World Logistics Hub====

This is a plan to build cargo sheds and goods handling on 90 acres of farmland on the southwest side of the A538 road next to the southeast side of the M56 motorway, across the A538 from the present cargo terminal, near Junction 6 of the M56. This will obliterate Oak Farm and Oak Farm Cottages, and the part of Sunbank Lane west of the A538. There are protests about this plan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://enterprisezones.communities.gov.uk/world-logistics-hub-approved-manchester-airport-city-enterprise-zone/ |title=World Logistics Hub approved for Manchester Airport City Enterprise Zone | Enterprise Zones |publisher=Enterprisezones.communities.gov.uk |date=28 November 2012 |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.planestupid.com/category/blog-tags/world-logistics-hub |title=World Logistics Hub | Plane Stupid - bringing the aviation industry back down to earth! |publisher=Plane Stupid |date=11 August 2012 |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airportcity.co.uk/master-plan/world-logistics-hub/# |title=World Logistics Hub - Airport City Manchester |publisher=Airportcity.co.uk |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]

==Terminals==

Manchester Airport has three passenger terminals (Terminals 1, 2 and 3). Terminals 1 and 2 are linked by the skylink, with travelators to aid passengers with the 10–15-minute walk. Terminal 3 is linked to Terminal 1 and the skylink by a covered walkway. The "skylink" also connects the terminals to the airport railway station complex (known as "The Station") and the Radisson BLU Hotel. The Skylink started construction in 1996 and opened 1997. Expansion to the Radisson Hotel was completed in 1998 when the hotel opened.
The airport provides regular direct flights to destinations worldwide by over 60 airlines. North American carriers at Manchester include American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and US Airways. The only scheduled UK operator serving the USA market is Virgin Atlantic. Airlines serving the Asian market include Emirates, Etihad Airways, Pakistan International Airlines, Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines. Manchester was an international hub for BMI which offered several destinations from Terminal 3, however the airline withdrew its routes from Manchester to North America and the Caribbean, including to Chicago and Las Vegas during early 2009 for financial reasons.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/business/article5107390.ece |title=Bmi to end Manchester-Chicago services |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]
Scheduled airlines with a base at Manchester include: BMI Regional, EasyJet, Flybe, Jet2, Monarch, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic. Charter airlines with a base at Manchester include: Monarch, Small Planet Airlines, Thomas Cook Airlines and Thomson Airways.
Manchester Airport offers flights to over 190 destinations across the globe and 65 tour operators utilise the facility.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/manweb.nsf/Content/terminalrelaunches|title=Flagship terminal relaunches at Manchester Airport |accessdate=14 July 2009|publisher=Manchester Airport[/tpl] Many of Manchester's overseas routes are served by charter flights to holiday destinations, some being seasonal. The proportion of scheduled passengers passing through Manchester has increased from 43% in 1991 to 68% during 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?catid=80&pagetype=88&sglid=3&fld=2009Annual |title=UK CAA Airport Statistics |publisher=Caa.co.uk |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]
Manchester also offers more destinations than some of the biggest airports in the U.S.A., including New York-JFK, although it is still slightly behind the three biggest 'hubs' in the global aviation network – Atlanta (Georgia, USA), Frankfurt am Main (Germany) and Amsterdam (Netherlands) – which each offer more than 250 destinations. However, Manchester serves more foreign destinations than Atlanta and Frankfurt (but not Amsterdam), although being much smaller in terms of total passengers handled.

===Terminal 1===

Terminal 1 is used by airlines with scheduled and charter operations, flying to European and other worldwide destinations. It is the largest terminal at the airport. It was opened in 1962, by Prince Phillip, the Duke of Edinburgh, and it is a base for EasyJet, Jet2, Small Planet Airlines and Thomas Cook.  Some other airlines that fly out of Terminal 1 include Brussels Airlines, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Lufthansa, Swiss, TAP Portugal and Turkish Airlines. Terminal 1 is spread over an area of [tpl]convert|110000|m2|abbr=on[/tpl].
The terminal has 29 stands, of which 15 have air bridges, and is the largest of the three terminals. Terminal 1's current capacity is around 11 million passengers a year. compared with an annual capacity of 2.5 million passengers when it first opened.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/manweb.nsf/alldocs/10F56C819A51454E8025739300388C1D/$File/Masterplan.pdf |title=masterplan – jan – new |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl]
In the Summer of 2009, a £50 million redevelopment programme for Terminal 1 was completed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uk-airport-news.info/manchester-airport-news-030709.html|title=Manchester Airport £50m overhaul complete |accessdate=4 July 2009|publisher=UK Airport News[/tpl] As part of the overhaul, which took over 2 years, a new £14 million 14-lane security area opened during April 2008. The terminal's arrivals area has since been revamped with additional catering and retail facilities. Terminal 1's departure lounge has been expanded with a greater choice of shops and restaurants, following the virtual elimination of the landside area, and additional executive lounges have been added. Following the 2007 smoking ban, the indoor ventilated smoking room in the departure lounge was closed, however this was replaced in 2010 by a rooftop smoking terrace to allow passengers to smoke after passing through security.

===Terminal 2===

Terminal 2 is used by a variety of airlines, operating both charter and scheduled flights to many European and worldwide destinations.  It opened in 1993 and it is a base for Monarch, Thomson Airways and Virgin Atlantic. Some other airlines that use the terminal include Air Malta, Qatar Airways and United Airlines.  Terminal 2 is spread over an area of [tpl]convert|52000|m2|abbr=on[/tpl].
Terminal 2 has 20 gates, of which 14 have air bridges. The design of the terminal makes it capable of extensive expansion; planning permission already exists for an extension providing additional gates, together with the construction of a satellite pier. Terminal 2's current capacity is around 8 million passengers a year, this will be extended to ultimately handle 25 million passengers a year. In 2007, an £11 million project commenced to redevelop Terminal 2 by improving security facilities and enhancing retail and catering services. This has resulted in the elimination of the land-side shopping area to allow for an expanded air-side departure lounge. The ground level arrivals area has also been redeveloped with improved catering and retail facilities. Like Terminal 1, following the 2007 smoking ban, the indoor ventilated smoking room in the departure lounge was closed, however this was replaced in 2009 by an external smoking area at Gate 300 to allow passengers to smoke after passing through security. The departure lounge also has an unsupervised children's play area at Gate 212. Terminal 2's new upper-level security area opened during July 2008 and the entire terminal redevelopment completed during autumn 2009.

===Terminal 3===

Terminal 3 was known in succession as "Terminal 1 – British Airways", "Terminal 1A" and "Terminal 3 – British Airways and Domestic” before becoming simply known as Terminal 3

This Terminal now handles the majority of domestic routes from Manchester as well as some scheduled European flights and a few intercontinental flights.

The terminal was opened in 1989 by Diana, Princess of Wales as 'Terminal 1 Domestic' before re-designating as Terminal 3 in May 1998.
It is now primarily a base for Flybe and Ryanair operations. Some other airlines that fly out of Terminal 3 include Air France, American Airlines, British Airways, BMI Regional and KLM. Terminal 3 is spread over an area of [tpl]convert|44400|m2|abbr=on[/tpl].
In June 1998, British Airways opened their new £75 million terminal facility designed by Grimshaw Architects, this being a major extension to Terminal 3, and became the primary user of the terminal along with their Oneworld partner airlines.

===Later events===

More recently British Airways have scaled down operations from the Manchester Airport with the sale of their BA Connect subsidiary to Flybe; and the ending of their franchise agreement with GB Airways a business subsequently sold to Easyjet. In October 2008 the daily New York-JFK service was also terminated and in March 2013, the frequent service to London Gatwick was terminated as well. This leaves a daily high frequency BA Shuttle serving London Heathrow.
In codeshare with British Airways Oneworld Alliance partner American Airlines operations remain in Terminal 3 with daily flights to both New York-JFK and Chicago-O'Hare.
Since taking over BA Connect's select routes, Flybe has gone on to add several more destinations. In 2012, Flybe introduced the “mini hub” concept coordinating the arrival and departure times of various domestic services throughout the day and thereby creating combinations such as Norwich-Manchester-Belfast, Glasgow-Manchester-Southampton or even Edinburgh-Manchester-Exeter, and others to be accomplished in each direction with conveniently short transfer times.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flybe.com/corporate/media/news/1203/08.htm |title=Corporate Media News archive |publisher=Flybe |date=8 March 2012 |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]
In 2013 Virgin Atlantic introduced its 'Little Red' short-haul brand to take-up some of the available Heathrow and Gatwick slots. Manchester was the inaugural destination, with further roll-outs subsequently including Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Initially, these services are operated by aircraft 'wet-leased' from Aer Lingus. There are currently four flights in each direction between Manchester and London which are described as timed to coincide with Virgin Atlantic's international schedules.[tpl]cite web|last=Atlantic|first=Virgin|url=http://www.virgin-atlantic.com/gb/en/the-virgin-experience/little-red/manchester-connections.html[/tpl]

===Passenger numbers===

 
 
Passenger numbers at Manchester peaked in 2006 when over 22.4 million passed through the airport. In 2013 around 20.7 million passengers used the airport, an increase of 5.1% compared with 2012, making Manchester the third busiest airport in the UK in terms of annual passenger throughput.

===Busiest routes===

===Maintenance bases===

Manchester Airport is the home to the engineering bases of Thomas Cook Airlines and Monarch Airlines. Airlines such as Etihad Airways also have one of six maintenance bases worldwide in Manchester with their newly opened line maintenance facility.[tpl]Cite news |title=Etihad marks two more Manchester milestones |url=http://www.etihadairways.com/sites/Etihad/uk/en/aboutetihad/mediacenter/newslisting/newsdetails/Pages/etihad-manchester-milestones-Aug11.aspx?fromNewsListing=false |work=Etihad Airways |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=11 March 2012[/tpl]

===World Freight Terminal===

Manchester Airport has a World Freight Terminal, serving cargo-only freighter services and cargo carried on regular passenger flights.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/manweb.nsf/Content/WorldFreightTerminal |title=World Freight Terminal |publisher=Manchester Airport |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl] It was opened in 1986, west of the original airfield. There is [tpl]convert|550000|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl] of warehouse and office space on site, including a chiller unit for frozen products and a border inspection post. There are three aircraft maintenance hangars, with five transit sheds, operated by British Airways Regional Cargo, Swissport Cargo, Menzies World Cargo, Plane Handling and Servisair. There are over 100 freight forwarding companies on site.
Freight throughput at the airport grew from 94,000 tonnes in 1997 to the peak at 165,000 tonnes in 2007, but then declined to around 97,000 tonnes in 2012, making Manchester the fifth-busiest UK airport for freight behind London Heathrow, East Midlands, London Stansted and Gatwick airports.

===Runways===

Manchester Airport has two parallel runways. Runway 1 (23R/05L) [tpl]Convert|3048|x|45|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl], and Runway 2 (23L/05R) [tpl]Convert|3050|x|45|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl]. Both runways are [tpl]Convert|390|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] apart and staggered by [tpl]Convert|1,850|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] so that arrivals can operate independently on one runway whilst departures use the other.http://www.vatsim-uk.co.uk/download/fetch/?downloadID=00194
The original main runway, then designated 06/24 and initially [tpl]convert|3300|ft|abbr=on|0[/tpl] in length,[tpl]Harvnb|Scholefield|1998|p=17[/tpl] opened on 17 May 1937http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/manweb.nsf/alldocs/0B29FCA3B9CCCD988025741100504B27/$File/RunwayDataSheet.pdf when the airport was used as an RAF base and a military aircraft assembly centre. It was extended in stages from 1952, reaching its current length in 1981 to attract long-haul international traffic. As demand and aircraft movements both increased during the mid-1990s, mainly due to the newly completed Terminal 2, the airport studied the option of a second full-length runway. A consultation process began and planning permission was approved in 1997, with construction work starting the same year.
The second runway, initially designated 06R/24L,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/manweb.nsf/Content/AirportSummary |title=Fact Sheet: Airport Summary |publisher=Manchester Airport |date= |accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl] became operational on 5 February 2001 at a cost of £172 million, and was the first full-length commercial runway to open in Britain for over 20 years. The site where the second runway was constructed was on the southern airfield boundary, which is near the village of Styal in the Cheshire countryside. The project was deemed controversial because of the destruction of natural wildlife habitatsFlight path to destruction[tpl]dead link|date=April 2010[/tpl] and because of the added flight paths which lead to and from the second runway. This results in aircraft flying low over the residential areas of Knutsford[tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.knutsfordguardian.co.uk/2007/12/19/300005.html |title=Knutsford Guardian – Residents wait for airport to pay out |publisher=Archive.knutsfordguardian.co.uk |date=19 December 2007 |accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl] and Stockport when landing or taking off, in particular landing aircraft which do not follow 'Preferred Noise Routes'.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/manweb.nsf/Content/communityoperations |title=Community Operations |publisher=Manchester Airport |date= |accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl]
Planning permission for Runway 2 (23L/05R) permits use of both runways between the hours of 0600-2200.http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/manweb.nsf/alldocs/0B29FCA3B9CCCD988025741100504B27/$File/RunwayDataSheet.pdf At night between the hours of 2200-0600 single runway operations based on Runway 1 (23R/05L) are used. Exceptions are made for emergencies and planned maintenance. In practise, dual runway operations incorporating Runway 2 (23L/05R) are only used at peak demand, which is currently in the morning and then again between 1600-2000hrs, though afternoon hours will be extended to 1300-2000hrs from 1 May 2014 to meet increasing demand.http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/manchester-airport-extends-second-runway-6984243
Most aircraft arriving into Manchester Airport use the Instrument Landing System, which in line with most other airports has a glide slope of 3 degrees equal to descending 318 feet per nautical mile. The prevailing wind direction is westerly, so normally aircraft fly from northeast to southwest. In practise this means that normally aircraft land from the northeast over Stockport, Cheadle and Heald Green and takeoff towards Knutsford. In dual runway operations aircraft will usually land on to Runway 1 (23R) and depart from Runway 2 (23L). When the wind direction changes, usually affecting 20% of movements per annum, operations are reversed with aircraft landing from the southwest, lining up to the south over Northwich and over Knutsford and taking off towards Stockport. In dual runway operations aircraft will usually land on to Runway 2 (05R) and depart from Runway 1 (05L). Sometimes, aircraft arriving into Manchester Airport are held in stacks, usually in poor weather when the movement rate decreases. The airport has 3 stacks: DAYNE, MIRSI and ROSUN, each located approximately 15/20 miles from the airport. DAYNE serves arrivals from the south, ROSUN from the north and east and MIRSI from the west. If you live within 20 miles of the airport, you will likely see and hear aircraft.

===Control Tower===

A new control tower was opened on 25 June, 2013. At 60 m tall, it is the UK's second tallest control tower, after London Heathrow, and it replaces the old tower on top of Terminal 1.[tpl]cite web |title=Manchester Airport’s new £20 million control tower is complete |url=http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/manweb.nsf/content/ManchesterAirportsnew20millioncontroltoweriscomplete |publisher=Manchester Airport |accessdate=9 July 2013[/tpl]

===Security===

Manchester Airport is policed by the Greater Manchester Police. Several security-related incidents have occurred at the airport in recent years.

==Ground transport==

===Rail===

Manchester Airport railway station, opened in May 1993,[tpl]Harvnb|Scholefield|1998|p=138[/tpl] forms part of The Station and is located between Terminals 1 and 2. It is linked to the terminals using a Skylink moving walkway. Trains are operated either by Northern Rail or TransPennine Express and connect the airport to Manchester Piccadilly Station and other railway stations mainly throughout northern England, including Crewe, Wigan and Southport, but some trains come from as far as Edinburgh. A third rail platform was completed in December 2008 to allow for an increase in rail capacity. In 2009 Network Rail stated that the creation of the third platform has meant that the capacity at Manchester airport will become constrained by the layover of the trains and congestion at the throat. To solve this issue they have recommended building a line underneath the Airport towards Northwich in the 2019 to 2024 period.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/StrategicBusinessPlan/RoutePlans/2009/Route%2020%20-%20North%20West%20Urban.pdf |title=Connecting local communities |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]
On 28 January 2013, the Government announced the station will be included in the 2nd stage of High Speed 2 which will give the airport direct links with other British cities like Birmingham and London and also a quicker route into Central Manchester.

===Bus and coach===

The Station is the airport's ground transport interchange and brings bus, coach and rail passengers under one roof. Over 300 trains, 100 coaches and 500 buses a day use the facility. Buses serve many locations throughout Greater Manchester, including the 24-hour bus service Skyline (service 43), which runs every 10 minutes (every 30 minutes at night) to Manchester city centre via Wythenshawe, Northenden, Withington, Fallowfield and Rusholme. There is also Skyline (service 19) operating every hour to Altrincham via Wythenshawe and Sale. A network of National Express coach services serve Manchester Airport and operate to destinations further afield, including as far as Dublin.
The bus and coach services that use the bus station and its Stand Letter are:
(Places in bold are where services terminate)

===Road===

The airport is a 20-minute drive from Manchester city centre and is reached by the M56 motorway, with a dedicated approach road from the motorway at junction 5. The M56 is the main route used by traffic to reach the airport. There are also minor local roads serving the airport from the north (Wythenshawe) and the east (Heald Green). The M56/A538 road junction serves the World Freight Terminal, to the west of the airport. The A538 runs east-west serving the local towns of Altrincham and Wilmslow.
Taxi ranks are situated by arrivals at all three terminals. Passengers driving to the airport can use the drop-off areas outside the terminal buildings, but when picking up passengers the airport requires that they park in the short stay car parks provided for a fee. Long stay car parks are situated both on and off site.

===Parking===

The airport's official short-stay car parking can be found in the multi-storey car parks adjacent to Terminals 1, 2 and 3. In July 2007 the airport introduced a 'No Waiting' restriction on all access roads surrounding the terminals. This was a direct result of the 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack and so all pick-ups must take place by using the short-stay car parks.
In 2009/2010 Terminal 1's multi-storey car park was refurbished. Each level of the car park is colour-coded. The floor, walls, ceiling and supports have all received a repaint with every parking space having a sensor and green light above it, with empty parking bays indicated by the green light.
Official long-stay on-airport parking from Manchester Airport is located near the terminals and serviced by a regular courtesy bus. There is one long-stay car park serving Terminals 1 and 3, and a separate dedicated long-stay car park for Terminal 2. In 2009, the airport opened JetParks – two long-stay car parks less than a mile from the terminals. This is a cheaper alternative to the on-site car parks and is serviced by a 24-hour shuttle bus every 15 minutes. The airport also operates a Shuttle Park for long-stay car parking, which is also served by a regular courtesy bus, and is located just off the airport site to the east of Terminal 3. There are several privately operated car parks within a short distance of the airport, served by shuttle bus.

===Tram===

The Manchester Metrolink light rail system has had plans to extend to the airport for many years. When the idea of a congestion charge was mooted, part of the scheme was to have extended the Metrolink to the airport. However, when this was rejected the future of the scheme was in doubt. In 2009, it was announced that the line to the airport will finally be built. The airport line will be one spur of the line from St Werburgh's Road, to East Didsbury and Manchester Airport, which is due to open in 2016.

==Effect on the area; criticism==

Expansion of the airport caused closures of public roads in the area.
In 2007 Manchester Airport wanted to build on further green belt land in Styal to increase its car parking. However, the former Macclesfield Borough Council refused to give them planning permission to do so and expressed annoyance at the airport for not investing enough in public transport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thewilmslowexpress.co.uk/news/s/230/530055_victory_for_green_belt_campaigners_as_airports_plan_for_styal_is_rejected.html|title=Victory for green belt campaigners as airport's plan for Styal is rejected|publisher=Wilmslow Express|accessdate=9 November 2007[/tpl] Macclesfield Borough Council have said that they would consider giving planning permission for a new car park on brownfield land. The airport did not make another application, despite claims that the number of parking spaces was insufficient for the number of passengers.
Despite public concerns about privacy and health risks,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-11539723 |title=Manchester Airport body scanners in all three terminals |date=14 October 2010 |publisher=BBC news[/tpl] Manchester airport introduced full-body X-ray scanners in all terminals. Under Department for Transport regulations these scans were compulsory for all passengers selected to undergo the scan. Passengers who objected to the scans were not allowed to fly.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/manweb.nsf/Content/X-Ray-Scanners-Public-Information |title=Security Scanners Public Information |accessdate=15 November 2010 |publisher=Manchester Airport[/tpl] The X-ray body scanners were removed in September 2012.

==Public attractions==

Manchester Airport has had public viewing areas since the airport opened to the public in 1938. The 1960/1970s pier-top viewing facilities have been closed because of security concerns. In May 1992, an official "Aviation Viewing Park" (AVP) was created just off the A538 road on the south-western side of the airfield. This was moved to the western side of the airfield in May 1997 to allow construction of the second runway.[tpl]Harvnb|Scholefield|1998|p=133[/tpl] Renamed the "Runway Visitor Park" in June 2010, the facility is regarded as providing the best official viewing facilities for aircraft spotting at any major UK airport by aircraft enthusiasts.[tpl]Cite news |title=Guide to Manchester Airport |quote=Out of all UK airports, Manchester is probably the best for viewing and photography with many very good spots. |url=http://www.plane-mad.com/airport-spotting-guides/united-kingdom/manchester-man-egcc.html |work=Plane Mad |accessdate=27 April 2012[/tpl] Visitors can view aircraft taking off and landing from both runways, and aircraft taxiing to and from the runways. This attraction now draws around 300,000 visitors a year and is one of Greater Manchester's top 10 attractions.[tpl]Cite news |title=Lowry Tops Visitor Attraction Figures in Greater Manchester |url=http://www.manchesterconfidential.co.uk/News/Lowry-Tops-Visitor-Attraction-Figures-In-Greater-Manchester |work=Manchester Confidential |date=29 November 2011 |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl]
The visitor park also has a cafe and a shop selling aviation related items. Aircraft on display are:
Level 13 of the short-stay car park at Terminal 1 has another viewing location, popular with spotters for the last 32 years. As part of a recent refurbishment, the café and aviation shop which were once part of the viewing area have now been closed, with the aviation shop moving to the Terminal 1 arrivals area. The level (13) is now used as a car park for rental cars. The building that once housed the cafe and aviation shop is now the reception area/offices for the car rental companies. Spotting is still tolerated on level 13, and it is still a good place to take pictures of aircraft taxiing and parked up at Terminal 1, Terminal 2, the World Freight Terminal and the hangars. Terminal 3 stands are not visible from level 13; they are better viewed from the south side of the airport near Moss Lane.
The Airport Hotel is a public house operated by Robinson's Brewery, and is on Ringway Road about [tpl]convert|0.5|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from the airport. Its beer garden overlooks the east end of Taxiway J and the eastern threshold of runway 23R which are only [tpl]convert|50|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] away and provides good views of east-west landing approaches and some take-off rolls.
