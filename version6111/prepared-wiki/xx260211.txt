It features a low hipped roof with decorative gable ends and a corner bell tower.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10679|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration:Putnam and Mellor Engine and Hose Company Firehouse|date=August 1983|accessdate=2010-12-30 |author=Austin N.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
The official name of this firehouse was the South Main Street Firehouse.  The address was 46 South Main Street, Port Chester, NY.  As described above, it housed the Putnam Engine & Hose Company, No.2 (founded Oct. 1854) and the Mellor Engine & Hose Company, No.3.  The fire engines for these companies are Engine 63 and Engine 61, respectively.  
In 1995 the rear wall of the South Main Street Firehouse collapsed, rendering the firehouse uninhabitable.  Putnam and Mellor were temporarily displaced and eventually relocated to their current home â€“ the South End Fire Station (51-53 Grace Church Street, Port Chester, NY).  This new firehouse was completed in 2001.
Despite public outcry and despite being on the Register of Historic places, on November 17, 2007 the South Main Street Firehouse was demolished.
