Public Knowledge is a non-profit Washington, D.C.-based public interest group that is involved in intellectual property law, competition, and choice in the digital marketplace, and an open standards/end-to-end internet.

==History==

Public Knowledge was founded by David Bollier and Gigi Sohn.  Gene Kimmelman is president and CEO, Charles Duan is director of its Patent Reform Project, and its directors include Internet Archive Director and Co-founder Brewster Kahle, and former FCC Commissioner Michael J. Copps.

Public Knowledge's work focuses on the three 'IP's of communications and copyright policy: information policy, intellectual property, and Internet Protocol.
The group is known for its advocacy for copyright defenses and exemptions such as fair use and against the expansion of copyright in general. For instance, in response to the FCC's attempt to mandate a broadcast flag for all digital TV tuners, Public Knowledge led the successful legal campaign to have the rule overturned.[ref]
