==History==

===Foundation===

The airline was established in September 1936 and started operations the following month, on [tpl]date|1936-11-19[/tpl].[tpl]cite journal|title= World Airline Survey[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Primeras Líneas Uruguayas de Navegacion Aérea (PLUNA)|journal= Flight International|date= [tpl]date|1966-4-14[/tpl]|pages= 628|format= PDF|accessdate= [tpl]date|2011-8-12[/tpl]|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1966/1966%20-%201079.html[/tpl] It was set up by Jorge and Alberto Márquez Vaesa, two brothers who had obtained the necessary financial and technical support through the ambassador of the United Kingdom to Uruguay at the time, Sir Eugen Millington-Drake. This gentleman writes in his memoirs that he suggested the airline be named using a memorable acronym, taking SABENA as an example. It was then decided on "PLUNA", an acronym for Primeras Líneas Uruguayas de Navegación Aérea ([tpl]lang-en|First Uruguayan Air Navigation Lines[/tpl]). Millington-Drake knew De Havilland's representative in Buenos Aires at the time, which helped in the acquisition of the airline's first aircraft. The airline flew two five-seater de Havilland Dragonflys from Montevideo to Salto and Paysandú.PLUNA's history[tpl]Dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl][tpl]When|date=August 2011[/tpl] The two planes were christened Churrinche and San Alberto, the latter in honor of the brothers' father. PLUNA flew 2,600 passengers in their first fiscal year, a huge success for that era. It also flew 20,000 pieces of mail and 70,000 newspapers.
The carrier saw the incorporation of both the Potez 62 and the Douglas DC-2 into its fleet in the early 1940s, the latter acquired from the U.S. government. Following the outbreak of World War II, PLUNA was forced to suspend operations between 1942 and 1944 due to the lack of spare parts. The delicate position PLUNA was in at this time led the Uruguayan Government to aid the company by boosting its stake to 85% on [tpl]date|1944-10-16[/tpl]. The first Douglas DC-3 entered PLUNA's fleet in February 1946. The airline launched regular services to Porto Alegre, Brazil, in May 1948. The carrier later added the cities of Santa Cruz in Bolivia and Buenos Aires, Rosario and Córdoba in Argentina to its network.[tpl]When|date=August 2011[/tpl]

===Nationalisation===

The airline became a wholly government-owned company on [tpl]date|1951-11-12[/tpl]. After World War II, PLUNA's fleet included two Douglas DC-2s which were operated on the Montevideo–Paysandú–Salto route until they were retired by 1951. In the same year, a Douglas DC-3 and four de Havilland Herons were added to the fleet. The Herons only stayed in PLUNA's fleet for a short time and by 1957 they had been sold. The DC-3s remained in service much longer, and in 1971 the last four of them were sold to the Fuerza Aérea Uruguaya.
São Paulo was added to the route network in January 1954. On [tpl]date|1958-6-24[/tpl] the carrier entered the turbine era with the delivery of its first of three Vickers Viscounts four-engined turboprops purchased new from Vickers; it later acquired two Viscount 700s from Alitalia and three Viscount 800s from VASP.
PLUNA's growth slowed considerably for the next three decades, but it entered the jet age soon after jets were introduced to the world, and added John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York, and Miami to its destinations, using Boeing 707 and Boeing 737 aircraft.
In the 1980s PLUNA began flying to Madrid, Asunción, Rio de Janeiro and Santiago de Chile, but services to JFK and Miami were suspended. In the meantime, as the city of Punta del Este flourished as a major tourist destination, PLUNA benefited from that. During this time, an office was also opened in Tel Aviv, Israel.

===Privatisation===

The 1990s saw financial trouble loom for PLUNA. In 1995, the company was transformed into a public–private partnership and the government sold 51% of the shares to a holding formed by an Argentine consortium named Tevycom and Uruguayan businessmen; the holding later sold half of its participation in PLUNA to Varig.[tpl]cite news|title= Varig pode vender Pluna para a Aerolíneas Argentinas|language= Portuguese|trans_title= Varig's Pluna stake may be sold to Aerolineas Argentinas|date= [tpl]date|2004-3-16[/tpl]|publisher= Folha de Sao Paulo|url= http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/dinheiro/ult91u81966.shtml|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-7-19[/tpl][/tpl]
By late [tpl]start date|2005|6[/tpl], the airline's major shareholders were the Government of Uruguay (49%) and Varig (49%), and private investors held the balance.[tpl]cite news|title= Varig deixa gerência da companhia aérea uruguaia Pluna|language= Portuguese|trans_title= Varig steps down from management at Pluna|first= Vinicius|last= Albuquerque|date= [tpl]date|2005-6-27[/tpl]|publisher= Folha de Sao Paulo|url= http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/dinheiro/ult91u97671.shtml|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-7-19[/tpl][/tpl] When Varig entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on [tpl]date|2005-6-17[/tpl], it sought a bidder for its 49% stake in PLUNA. For almost a year, it looked as if it might go to Venezuela's state-run Conviasa,[tpl]cite news|title= Pluna in play|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2005/08/22/201013/pluna-in-play.html|agency= Airline Business|publisher= Flightglobal.com|date= [tpl]date|2005-8-22[/tpl]|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/68Gbpd74C|archivedate= [tpl]date|2012-6-8[/tpl]|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-6-8[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= Venezuela quer comprar ação da Varig na Pluna|language= Portuguese|trans_title= Venezuela wants to buy Varig's stake in Pluna|date= [tpl]date|2005-7-14[/tpl]|publisher= Folha de Sao Paulo|url= http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/dinheiro/ult91u98187.shtml|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-7-19[/tpl][/tpl] but the deal officially fell through in [tpl]start date|2006|7[/tpl].
On [tpl]date|2007-1-4[/tpl], the Government of Uruguay started negotiations to sell 75% of it shares to a private consortium of investors from Germany, United States, Uruguay and Argentina called Leadgate Investment, a subsidiary of Latin American Regional Aviation Holding Corporation (LARAH),[tpl]Failed verification|date=July 2012[/tpl] that committed to inject [tpl]US$|177|link=yes[/tpl] million in the company.[tpl]cite news|title= Uruguay government close to selling controlling stake in Pluna to investors, replace management team|first= Rainer|last= Uphoff|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/01/08/211408/uruguay-government-close-to-selling-controlling-stake-in-pluna-to-investors-replace-management.html|work= Flightglobal.com|date= [tpl]date|2007-1-8[/tpl]|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/68YH8nwMp|archivedate= [tpl]date|2012-6-20[/tpl]|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-6-20[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= Ambitious project to recover Uruguay's flag carrier|url= http://en.mercopress.com/2007/01/06/ambitious-project-to-recover-uruguay-s-flag-carrier|work= MercoPress|date= [tpl]date|2007-1-6[/tpl]|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/68YHHbq5v|archivedate= [tpl]date|2012-6-20[/tpl]|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-6-20[/tpl][/tpl] In July the same year, the government awarded 75% of PLUNA's stock to LARAH, and the acquisition of seven Bombardier CRJ-900s in a deal worth [tpl]US$|261[/tpl] million was announced.[tpl]cite web|title= Uruguay's flag carrier signs contract for 7 midrange Bombardiers|publisher= MercoPress|date= [tpl]date|2007-7-10[/tpl]|url= http://en.mercopress.com/2007/07/10/uruguay-s-flag-carrier-signs-contract-for-7-midrange-bombardiers|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/69Gwn14O4|archivedate= [tpl]date|2012-7-19[/tpl]|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-7-19[/tpl][/tpl]
In late [tpl]start date|2007|10[/tpl], PLUNA presented its new corporate image, developed by Australian design company Cato Partners. This new image is based on the interpretation of the name "Uruguay" as meaning "river of the painted birds" or "river of the colorful birds" ([tpl]lang-es|Río de los pájaros pintados[/tpl]).[tpl]cite news|title= Pluna presenta nueva imagen y planes para la próxima temporada|language= Spanish|trans_title= Pluna presents its new image and plans for the next season|date= [tpl]date|2007-10-30[/tpl]|publisher= Espectador.com|url= http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=107959|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/68xEO6mWM|archivedate= [tpl]date|2012-7-6[/tpl]|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-7-6[/tpl][/tpl] This change was partly motivated by the company's intention to distance itself from Varig's corporate image and to project a new, more youthful, warmer and sympathetic personality.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] The first of seven brand new CRJ900s that would be incorporated into the fleet during 2008 arrived in [tpl]MONTHNAME|3[/tpl] that year; these new aircraft permitted increasing frequencies to existing routes, as well as expanding services to new destinations.[tpl]cite web|title= Historia de la compañía|trans_title= Company's history|language= Spanish|publisher= Pluna|url= http://www.flypluna.com/cat/es/historia-de-la-compania-28.html|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/68xNs0r7T|archivedate= [tpl]date|2012-7-6[/tpl]|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-7-6[/tpl][/tpl]

In September and October 2010 three additional new CRJ900s aircraft were delivered from the Bombardier factory. In April 2011 three options were taken up for delivery at the end of 2011 and these were delivered between September and November 2011. With these additions, PLUNA's fleet consisted of 13 airplanes, the highest number in its history.

===Collapse===

In early [tpl]start date|2012|6[/tpl], PLUNA's then CEO, Matías Campiani, disclosed that the airline might face collapse amid a financial distress that led to a loss of [tpl]US$|18[/tpl] million for the eight months ending in February the same year, partly due to the protectionism of the government of Argentina —where the carrier concentrate 21% of their operations— following the renationalisation of Aerolíneas Argentinas in 2008, and partly due to the slowdown of the Brazilian economy in the preceding months.[tpl]cite news|title= Uruguay's Pluna Airline CEO warns of 'collapse'|first= Belén|last= Bogado|agency= Associated Press|location= Montevideo|date= [tpl]date|2012-6-4[/tpl]|url= http://m.apnews.com/ap/db_268779/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=KR8ohas9|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/68aSZRRrM|archivedate= [tpl]date|2012-6-21[/tpl]|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-6-21[/tpl][/tpl] Later on, with losses totalling [tpl]US$|300[/tpl] million, Leadgate disposed of their 75% stake in the airline, transferring it back to the Uruguayan government.[tpl]cite news|title= Canada and US closely monitoring Uruguay’s flag air carrier in the brink of default|date= [tpl]date|2012-6-5[/tpl]|work= MercoPress|url= http://en.mercopress.com/2012/06/05/canada-and-us-closely-monitoring-uruguay-s-flag-air-carrier-in-the-brink-of-default|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/68YFiW8gc|archivedate= [tpl]date|2012-6-20[/tpl]|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-6-20[/tpl][/tpl] By that time, that percentage of PLUNA's stock was owned by LARAH, which was in turn 75% owned by Leadgate and 25% by Jazz Air.[tpl]cite news|title= Acuerdan salida de socio privado de Pluna y esperan ratificación|first= Andrés|last= Oyhenard|language= Spanish|trans_title= Exit agreed for Pluna's private partner and ratification is awaited|work= El Observador|date= [tpl]date|2012-6-12[/tpl]|url= http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/225855/acuerdan-salida-de-socio-privado-de-pluna-y-esperan-ratificacion/|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/68aPn6hTQ|archivedate= [tpl]date|2012-6-21[/tpl]|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-6-21[/tpl][/tpl] Despite it being initially disclosed that Jazz Air was not interested in taking over the entire 75% stock,[tpl]cite news|title= Chorus Aviation won't invest more to help Pluna airlines out of financial woes|first= Sylvain|last= Larocque|agency= The Canadian Press|work= Canadian Business|date= [tpl]date|2012-6-15[/tpl]|url= http://www.canadianbusiness.com/article/87972--chorus-aviation-won-t-invest-more-to-help-pluna-airlines-out-of-financial-woes|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/68aP5QEKE|archivedate= [tpl]date|2012-6-21[/tpl]|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-6-21[/tpl][/tpl] and that it was later informed that the Canadian airline was actually evaluating the acquisition, the government suspended PLUNA's operations on [tpl]date|2012-7-5[/tpl]—following a strike that started two days earlier, after failing to find new investors for the company.
The government announced that both PLUNA's fleet and routes would be auctioned. There are no plans for the government to have any stake in PLUNA's successor. In [tpl]start date|2012|9[/tpl], the auction of the seven Bombardier aircraft that belonged to the liquidated carrier was delayed until [tpl]start date|2012|10[/tpl] as there were no bidders. Cosmo Airlines, a Spanish charter carrier, eventually purchased seven Bombardier CRJ900s at a price of $137 million.[tpl]cite web |url=http://atwonline.com/aircraft-engines-components/news/cosmo-buys-liquidated-pluna-s-seven-crj900s-1004 |title=Cosmo buys liquidated Pluna’s seven CRJ900s |author=Edvaldo Pereira Lima | date=4 October 2012[/tpl]
Regionally, the void created by PLUNA's collapse benefits foreign airlines on some routes.

==Destinations==

[tpl]As of|2011|4[/tpl], PLUNA linked Uruguay with two destinations in Argentina, one in Chile, one in Paraguay, and eight in Brazil.

===Codeshare agreements===

PLUNA had a codeshare agreement with Iberia, which actually operates the Montevideo–Madrid–Montevideo route.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flypluna.com/cat/en/where-we-fly-43.html|title=Where we fly|publisher=PLUNA|accessdate=[tpl]date|2011-4-26[/tpl][/tpl] Under the same codeshare agreement passengers also connected from Madrid to many destinations within Spain and also to Frankfurt. PLUNA also announced a codeshare agreement with American Airlines, which would have placed PLUNA's code on American's Miami-Montevideo route, if it had government approval.

==Fleet==

Prior to its collapse, PLUNA's fleet consisted of 13 Bombardier CRJ900s regional jet aircraft, with an average age of 2.7 years, [tpl]As of|2012|6|lc=y[/tpl]. Each aircraft was equipped with 90 seats in an all-economy class layout. The list below also includes equipment operated by the carrier throughout its history.

PLUNA had previously considered the Bombardier Q400 for the expansion into new markets. Nevertheless, on [tpl]date|2011-4-25[/tpl] the airline announced it had converted some of the outstanding options for 3 new CRJ900 aircraft into firm orders for delivery before the end of 2011.

==Accidents and incidents==

PLUNA had only one fatal accident with the loss of ten crew members, the Aviation Safety Network records 3 hull-loss accidents/incidents for the airline.[tpl]cite web|title= Accident record for PLUNA|url= http://aviation-safety.net/database/operator/airline.php?var=4870|publisher= Aviation Safety Network|date= [tpl]date|2004-11-28[/tpl]|accessdate= [tpl]date|2011-8-12[/tpl][/tpl]
