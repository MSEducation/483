==Friendly Faces==

Friendly Faces is a peer support group run by year 10 and 11 pupils. Day to day they offer drop in sessions for other pupils to discuss problems and patrol the playground wearing orange hi-vis jackets. In addition to this the team visit local primary schools in the summer term to prepare year 6 students for high school, run training and selection days for new friendly faces and promote anti-bullying throughout the school. In 2012 they hosted an Anti-Bullying conference for the Norfolk Region on behalf of the Diana award Anti-Bullying Ambassadors Programme with Alex Holmes. In 2013 they were invited to London to Facebook HQ for a showcase of best practice in school of antibullying work.
