===Biodiversity===

Approximately 27,700 species of flora and fauna have been registered in Latvia. Common species of wildlife in Latvia include deer, wild boar, moose, lynx, bear, fox, beaver and wolves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://latvijas.daba.lv/scripts/db/saraksti/saraksti.cgi?l=en&s=en|title=List of species|publisher=Nature of Latvia|accessdate=2007-03-07[/tpl] Non-marine molluscs of Latvia include 159 species.
Species that are endangered in other European countries but common in Latvia include: black stork (Ciconia nigra), corncrake (Crex crex), lesser spotted eagle (Aquila pomarina), white-backed woodpecker (Picoides leucotos), crane (Grus grus), Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber), Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), European wolf (Canis lupus), and the European lynx (Felis lynx).
Phytogeographically, Latvia is shared between the Central European and Northern European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the WWF, the territory of Latvia belongs to the ecoregion of Sarmatic mixed forests. More than half of Latvia's territory is covered by forests, mostly Scots Pine, birch and Norway Spruce.
Several species of flora and fauna are considered national symbols. Oak (Quercus robur, [tpl]lang-lv|ozols[/tpl]), and linden (Tilia cordata, [tpl]lang-lv|liepa[/tpl]) are Latvia's national trees and the daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare, [tpl]lang-lv|pīpene[/tpl]) its national flower. The white wagtail (Motacilla alba, [tpl]lang-lv|baltā cielava[/tpl]) is Latvia's national bird. Its national insect is the Two-spot Ladybird (Adalia bipunctata, [tpl]lang-lv|mārīte[/tpl]). Amber, fossilized tree resin, is one of Latvia's most important cultural symbols. In ancient times, amber found along the Baltic Sea coast was sought by Vikings as well as traders from Egypt, Greece and the Roman Empire. This led to the development of the Amber Road.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.latvia.eu/content/national-symbols-latvia|title=National Symbols of Latvia|publisher=Latvian Institute|accessdate=17 May 2012[/tpl]
Several Nature Reserves protect unspoiled landscapes with a variety of large animals. At Pape Nature Reserve, where European bison, wild horses and recreated aurochs have been reintroduced, one can find now an almost complete Holocene Megafauna including also moose, deer and wolf.

===Regions and divisions===

Latvia is a unitary state, currently divided into 110 one-level municipalities ([tpl]lang-lv|novadi[/tpl]) and 9 republican cities ([tpl]lang-lv|republikas pilsētas[/tpl]) with their own city council and administration: Daugavpils, Jēkabpils, Jelgava, Jūrmala, Liepāja, Rēzekne, Riga, Valmiera and Ventspils. There are four historical and cultural regions in Latvia – Courland, Latgale, Vidzeme, Zemgale, which are recognised in Constitution of Latvia. Selonia, a part of Zemgale, is sometimes considered culturally distinct region, but it is not part of any formal division. The borders of historical and cultural regions usually are not explicit definite and in several sources may vary. In formal divisions Riga region, which includes capital and parts of other regions that have strong relationship to capital, is also often included in regional divisions e.g. there are five planning regions of Latvia ([tpl]lang-lv|plānošanas reģioni[/tpl]), which were created in 2009 to promote balanced development of all regions, under this division Riga region includes large parts of what traditionally is considered Vidzeme, Courland and Zemgale. Statistical regions of Latvia, established in accordance with EU Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics, duplicate this division, but divides Riga region into two parts with capital alone being a separate region.

==Politics==

The 100-seat unicameral Latvian parliament, the Saeima, is elected by direct popular vote every four years. The president is elected by the Saeima in a separate election, also held every four years. The president appoints a prime minister who, together with his cabinet, forms the executive branch of the government, which has to receive a confidence vote by the Saeima. This system also existed before World War II.[tpl]Lv icon[/tpl] Constitution of the Republic of Latvia with amendments and revisions (Official english translation) (Retrieved on 18 November 2011) Highest civil servants are sixteen Secretaries of State.

==Economy==

Latvia is a member of the World Trade Organisation (1999) and the European Union (2004). On 1 January 2014, the Euro became the country's currency, superseding the Lats. According to statistics in late 2013, 45% of the population supported the introduction of the euro, while 52% opposed it.[tpl]cite web|author=Apollo, redakcija@apollo.lv |url=http://www.apollo.lv/zinas/turpina-pieaugt-iedzivotaju-atbalsts-eiro-ieviesanai/625128 |title=Turpina pieaugt iedzīvotāju atbalsts eiro ieviešanai |publisher=Apollo.lv |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23[/tpl] Following the introduction of the Euro, Eurobarometer surveys in January 2014 showed support for the Euro to be around 53%, close to the European average.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21593502-latvias-president-nominates-laimdota-straujuma-prime-minister-new-currency-new-leader |title=New currency, new leader |publisher=The Economist |date=2014-01-14 |accessdate=2014-01-10[/tpl]
Since the year 2000, Latvia has had one of the highest (GDP) growth rates in Europe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=1996,39140985&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&screen=detailref&language=en&product=sdi_ed&root=sdi_ed/sdi_ed/sdi_ed1000 |title=Growth rate of real GDP per capita|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=2007-07-28[/tpl] However, the chiefly consumption-driven growth in Latvia resulted in the collapse of the Latvian GDP in late 2008 and early 2009, exacerbated by the global economic crisis, shortage of credit and huge money resources needed for bailout of Parex bank.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/finances/?doc=22011|title=Rimsevics: Failing to bail out Parex banka would result in closing down of four banks in Latvia|publisher=The Baltic Course|accessdate=2013-12-08[/tpl] Latvian economy fell 18% in the first three months of 2009, the biggest fall in the European Union.[tpl]cite news|last=Eglitis |first=Aaron |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=ao7qqF0UESqc |title=Latvian GDP Shrank 18% in First Quarter, EU’s Biggest Fall – |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2009-05-11 |accessdate=2010-10-16[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8043972.stm | work=BBC News | title=Latvian economy in rapid decline | date=2009-05-11 | accessdate=2010-04-04[/tpl]
The economic crisis of 2009 proved earlier assumptions that the fast growing economy was heading for implosion of the economic bubble, because it was driven mainly by growth of domestic consumption, financed by a serious increase of private debt, as well as a negative foreign trade balance. The prices of real estate, which were at some points appreciating at approximately 5% a month, were long perceived to be too high for the economy, which mainly produces low-value goods and raw materials.
Privatisation in Latvia is almost complete. Virtually all of the previously state-owned small and medium companies have been privatised, leaving only a small number of politically sensitive large state companies. The private sector accounted for nearly 68% of the country's GDP in 2000.
Foreign investment in Latvia is still modest compared with the levels in north-central Europe. A law expanding the scope for selling land, including to foreigners, was passed in 1997. Representing 10.2% of Latvia's total foreign direct investment, American companies invested $127 million in 1999. In the same year, the United States of America exported $58.2 million of goods and services to Latvia and imported $87.9 million. Eager to join Western economic institutions like the World Trade Organisation, OECD, and the European Union, Latvia signed a Europe Agreement with the EU in 1995—with a 4-year transition period. Latvia and the United States have signed treaties on investment, trade, and intellectual property protection and avoidance of double taxation.

===Economic contraction and recovery (2008–2012)===

The Latvian economy entered a phase of fiscal contraction during the second half of 2008 after an extended period of credit-based speculation and unrealistic appreciation in real estate values. The national account deficit for 2007, for example, represented more than 22% of the GDP for the year while inflation was running at 10%.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/lg.html|title=Latvia |publisher=CIA|accessdate=2008-12-15[/tpl]

Paul Krugman, the Nobel Laureate in economics for 2008, wrote in his New York Times Op-Ed column on 15 December 2008:
However, by 2010, commentators"Baltic Thaw, Aegean freeze", The Economist, 27 February 2010, p59Patrick Lannin and Aija Braslina  "UPDATE 2-IMF hails Latvia effort but sees risks ahead". Reuters, 15 March 2010, accessed 31 July 2010] noted signs of stabilisation in the Latvian economy. Rating agency Standard & Poor's raised its outlook on Latvia's debt from negative to stable. Latvia's current account, which had been in deficit by 27% in late 2006 was in surplus in February 2010. Kenneth Orchard, senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service argued that:
The IMF concluded the First Post-Program Monitoring Discussions with the Republic of Latvia in July 2012 announcing that Latvia’s economy has been recovering strongly since 2010, following the deep downturn in 2008–09. Real GDP growth of 5.5 percent in 2011 was underpinned by export growth and a recovery in domestic demand. The growth momentum has continued into 2012 and 2013 despite deteriorating external conditions, and the economy is expected to expand by 4.1 percent in 2014. The unemployment rate has receded from its peak of more than 20 percent in 2010 to around 9.3 percent in 2014.[tpl]cite web|author=Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 12/76 by IMF|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2012/pn1276.htm |title=IMF Executive Board Concludes First Post-Program Monitoring Discussions with the Republic of Latvia, July 16, 2012 |publisher=imf.org |accessdate=2012-07-18[/tpl]

===Infrastructure===

The transport sector is around 14% of GDP. Transit between Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan as well as other Asian countries and the West is large.[tpl]Wayback |date=20080908042001 |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/EXTECAREGTOPTRANSPORT/0,,contentMDK:20647605~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:571121,00.html |title=Latvia[/tpl], World Bank
Three biggest ports of Latvia are located in Riga, Ventspils, and Liepāja. Most transit traffic uses these and half the cargo is crude oil and oil products. Free port of Ventspils is the busiest port in the Baltic states. Apart from road and railway connections, Ventspils is also linked to oil extraction fields and transportation routes of Russian Federation via system of two pipelines from Polotsk, Belarus.
Riga International Airport is the busiest airport in the Baltic states with 4.7 million passengers in 2012. It has direct flight to over 80 destinations in 30 countries. airBaltic is the Latvian flag carrier airline and a low-cost carrier.
Latvia has three big hydroelectric power stations in Pļaviņu HES (825MW), Rīgas HES (402 MW) and Ķeguma HES-2 (192 MW). In the recent years a couple of dozen of wind farms as well as biogas or biomass power stations of different scale have been built in Latvia.
Latvia operates Inčukalns underground gas storage facility, one of the largest underground gas storage facilities in Europe and the only one in the Baltic states. Unique geological conditions at Inčukalns and other locations in Latvia are particularly suitable for underground gas storage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/ie/se/pdfs/wpgas/session/17_countr/latvia.pdf|title=The Outlook of Latvian Potential Underground Gas Storages and Prospects of Utilization of this Potential for Securing of Reliable Gas Supply to Europe |publisher=UNECE |date=2007-01-24 |accessdate=2013-06-05[/tpl]

==Demographics==

The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2013 was estimated at 1.34 children born/woman, which is lower than the replacement rate of 2.1.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/lg.html |title=Latvia |work=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA |date=6 December 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2014[/tpl]
In 2012, 45.0% of births were to unmarried women.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&plugin=1&language=en&pcode=tps00018 |title= Live births outside marriage |publisher=Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table |date=17 October 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2014[/tpl] The life expectancy in 2013 was estimated at 73.19 years (68.13 years male, 78.53 years female).

===Ethnic groups===

Latvia's population has been multiethnic for centuries, though the demographics shifted dramatically in the 20th century due to the World Wars, the emigration and removal of Baltic Germans, the Holocaust, and occupation by the Soviet Union. According to the Russian Empire Census of 1897, Latvians formed 68.3% of the total population of 1.93 million; Russians accounted for 12%, Jews for 7.4%, Germans for 6.2%, and Poles for 3.4%.Latvia – Population. Source: U.S. Library of Congress.
As of March 2011, Latvians and Livonians (about 400 people), the indigenous peoples of Latvia, form about 62.1% of the population, while 26.9% are Russians, Belarusians 3.3%, Ukrainians 2.2%, Poles 2.2%, Lithuanians 1.2%, Jews 0.3%, Romani people 0.3%, Germans 0.1%, Estonians 0.1% and others 1.3%. There were 290,660 non-citizens living in Latvia or 14.1% of Latvian residents, mainly ethnic Russians who arrived after the occupation of 1940 and their descendants.Population Census 2011 – Key Indicators. Csb.gov.lv. Retrieved on 2012-02-19.
In some cities, e.g. Daugavpils and Rēzekne, ethnic Latvians constitute a minority of the total population. Despite the fact that the proportion of ethnic Latvians has been steadily increasing for more than a decade, ethnic Latvians also make up slightly less than a half of the population of the capital city of Latvia – Rīga.
The share of ethnic Latvians had fallen from 77% (1,467,035) in 1935 to 52% (1,387,757) in 1989.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lka.edu.lv/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=index&topic=68|title=About Latvia|publisher= Latvian Academy of Culture|accessdate=2007-07-28[/tpl] In 2011 there were even fewer Latvians than in 1989, though their share of the population was larger — 1,284,194 (62.1% of the population).

===Language===

The sole official language of Latvia is Latvian, which belongs to the Baltic language group of the Indo-European language family. Another notable language of Latvia is the nearly extinct Livonian language of the Finnic branch of the Uralic language family, which enjoys protection by law; Latgalian — referred as either dialect or distinct separate language of Latvian — is also formally protected by Latvian law but only as a historical variation of the Latvian language. Russian, which was widely spoken during the Soviet period, is still the most widely used minority language by far (about 34% speak it at home, including persons who are not ethnically Russian).[tpl]cite web|url=http://data.csb.gov.lv/Table.aspx?layout=tableViewLayout1&px_tableid=tautassk_11%5c2011.gada+tautas+skait%c4%ab%c5%a1anas+gal%c4%abgie+rezult%c4%81ti%5cTSG11-071.px&px_language=en&px_type=PX&px_db=tautassk_11&rxid=c8c8a0dd-6a8e-4e89-add7-718c9998db99|title=THNICITIES OF RESIDENT POPULATION IN STATISTICAL REGIONS, CITIES UNDER STATE JURISDICTION AND COUNTIES BY LANGUAGE MOSTLY SPOKEN AT HOME; ON 1 MARCH 2011|publisher=Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia |accessdate=1 January 2014[/tpl]
While it is now required that all school students learn Latvian, most schools also include English and either German or Russian in their curricula. The English language is widely accepted in Latvia, especially in business and tourism. As of 2014 there are 109 schools for minorities that use Russian as the language of instruction for 40% of subjects (the rest 60% of subjects are taught in Latvian), however Latvian government is planning to completely abolish Russian as the language of instruction by 2018.http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/politics/druviete-ni-odnoj-rossijskoj-shkoly-v-latvii-ne-budet.d?id=44084401 "There is no place for a single  Russian school in Latvia" - Latvian Minister of Education
On 18 February 2012, Latvia held a constitutional referendum on whether to adopt Russian as a second official language.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.cvk.lv/pub/public/28361.html/|title=Referendum on the Draft Law "Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia"|publisher=Central Election Commission of Latvia|year=2012|accessdate=2 May 2012[/tpl] According to the Central Election Commission, 74.8% voted against, 24.88% voted for and the voter turnout was 71.11%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tn2012.cvk.lv/|title=Results of the referendum on the Draft Law "Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia"|language=Latvian|publisher=Central Election Commission of Latvia|year=2012|accessdate=2 May 2012[/tpl]
However, a large part of Latvia's Russian speaking community (290,660 or 14.1%[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] of Latvia's entire population) could not vote in this referendum because they hold non-citizen status and thus have no right to vote.

===Religion===

The largest religion in Latvia is Christianity, though only about 7% of the population attends religious services regularly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/trust.in.religious.institutions.does.not.convey.to.church.attendance/1462.htm|title=Trust in Religious Institutions does not convey to Church Attendance|publisher=Christian Today|date=2004-09-23|accessdate=2007-07-28|author=Eunice K. Y. Or[/tpl] The largest groups as of 2011 were:
In the Eurobarometer Poll 2010, 38% of Latvian citizens responded that "they believe there is a god", while 48% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 11% stated that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force".
Lutheranism was more prominent before the Soviet occupation, when it was a majority religion due to strong historical links with the Nordic countries and Northern Germany. Since then, Lutheranism has declined to a slightly greater extent than Roman Catholicism in all three Baltic states. The Evangelical Lutheran Church, with an estimated 600,000 members in 1956, was affected most adversely. An internal document of 18 March 1987, near the end of communist rule, spoke of an active membership that had shrunk to only 25,000 in Latvia, but the faith has since experienced a revival.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mongabay.com/reference/country_studies/latvia/SOCIETY.html |title=Latvia – SOCIETY |publisher=Mongabay.com |date=1987-03-18 |accessdate=2010-08-12[/tpl] The country's Orthodox Christians belong to the Latvian Orthodox Church, a semi-autonomous body within the Russian Orthodox Church. In 2011, there were 416 Jews and 319 Muslims living in Latvia.
There are more than 600 Latvian neopagans, Dievturi (The Godskeepers), whose religion is based on Latvian mythology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bibelesbiedriba.lv/religiju-enciklopedija/statistika.html|title=Statistics of approved parishes in Latvia|date=2004-01-01|accessdate=2007-03-07|publisher=The Latvian Bible Society|work=Reliģiju Enciklopēdija|language=Latvian[/tpl] About 21% of the total population is not affiliated with a specific religion.

===Education===

Riga Technical University and University of Latvia are two major universities in the country, both been established on the basis of Riga Polytechnical Institute and located in Riga.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rtu.lv |title=Riga Polytechnical Institute Home Page |publisher=Rtu.lv |accessdate=2010-10-16[/tpl] Another two important universities, which were established on the base of State University of Latvia, are Latvia University of Agriculture (established in 1939 on the basis of the Faculty of Agriculture) and Riga Stradiņš University (established in 1950 on the basis of the Faculty of Medicine) – both nowadays cover a variety of different fields. Daugavpils University is another significant centre of education. Latvia closed 131 schools between 2006 and 2010, which is a 12.9% decline, and in the same period enrolment in educational institutions has fallen by over 54,000 people, a 10.3% decline.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov.lv/csp/content/?lng=lv&cat=2300 |title=Latvijas Statistika |publisher=Csb.gov.lv |date=2010-05-17 |accessdate=2010-06-06[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===Health===

The Latvian healthcare system is a universal programme, largely funded through government taxation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Nov_18/ai_n15860135/ |title=Latvia's Healthcare System is Funded by General Taxation and All Latvians and Foreign Residents Are Guaranteed Medical Care | Business Wire | Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= 2005-11-18|accessdate=2010-02-05[/tpl] It is among the lowest-ranked healthcare systems in Europe, due to excessive waiting times for treatment, insufficient access to the latest medicines, and other factors.[tpl]cite web|author=The Baltic Course – Балтийский курс |url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/analytics/?doc=7137 |title=Latvia has worst health care system in Europe :: The Baltic Course | Baltic States news & analytics |publisher=The Baltic Course |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2010-02-05[/tpl] There were 59 hospitals in Latvia in 2009, down from 94 in 2007, and 121 in 2006.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/18/business/global/18lat.html?ref=business | work=The New York Times | title=Latvian Health Official Resigns Over Cuts | first=David | last=Jolly | date=2009-06-18 | accessdate=2010-04-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov.lv/csp/content/?cat=2310 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20071216125055/http://www.csb.gov.lv/csp/content/?cat=2310 |archivedate=2007-12-16 |title=The basic indicators of health care, at the end of the year |publisher=Csb.gov.lv |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2010-02-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.european-hospital.com/en/article/29-The_Baltic_States_and_their_health_systems-From_Soviet_to_EU.html |title=The Baltic States and their health systems – From Soviet to EU |publisher=European-Hospital |accessdate=2010-02-05[/tpl]
Corruption is relatively widespread in the Latvian healthcare system, though the situation has improved since the early 1990s. It has been noted that an environment conducive to corruption has been promulgated by low salaries and poorly implemented systemic reforms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/html/prddr/trans/aprmayjun03/pgs26-27.htm |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110629023653/http://www.worldbank.org/html/prddr/trans/aprmayjun03/pgs26-27.htm |archivedate=2011-06-29 |title=Fighting Corruption in Health Care Services |author= David Hayhurst |publisher=Worldbank.org |accessdate=2010-02-05[/tpl] This also results in brain drain, mostly to Western EU nations.
As of 2009, there were approximately 8,600 inhabitants of Latvia living with HIV/AIDS, accounting for a 0.7% adult HIV prevalence rate.

==Culture==

Traditional Latvian folklore, especially the dance of the folk songs, date back well over a thousand years. More than 1.2 million texts and 30,000 melodies of folk songs have been identified.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.li.lv/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=40&Itemid=124 |title=Welcome to Latvia – Folk Songs |publisher=Li.lv |date=2006-05-01 |accessdate=2010-10-16[/tpl]
Between the 13th and 19th centuries, Baltic Germans, many of whom were originally of non-German ancestry but had been assimilated into German culture, formed the upper class.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl] They developed distinct cultural heritage, characterised by both Latvian and German influences. It has survived in German Baltic families to this day, in spite of their dispersal to Germany, the USA, Canada and other countries in the early 20th century. However, most indigenous Latvians did not participate in this particular cultural life.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl] Thus, the mostly peasant local pagan heritage was preserved, partly merging with Christian traditions. For example, one of the most popular celebrations is Jāņi, a pagan celebration of the summer solstice—which Latvians celebrate on the feast day of St. John the Baptist.
In the 19th century, Latvian nationalist movements emerged. They promoted Latvian culture and encouraged Latvians to take part in cultural activities. The 19th century and beginning of the 20th century is often regarded[tpl]by whom|date=December 2012[/tpl] as a classical era of Latvian culture. Posters show the influence of other European cultures, for example, works of artists such as the Baltic-German artist Bernhard Borchert and the French Raoul Dufy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl] With the onset of World War II, many Latvian artists and other members of the cultural elite fled the country yet continued to produce their work, largely for a Latvian émigré audience.[tpl]cite web|url=http://latvianart.org/historical.html|title=Latvianart.org, "Historical Background"[/tpl]
Latvian Song and Dance Festival is an important event in Latvian culture and social life. It has been held since 1873, normally every five years. Approximately 30,000 performers altogether participate in the event.23rd All Latvian Song Festival retrieved on 7 March 2007 Although usually folksongs and classical choir songs are sung, with emphasis on a cappella singing, recently modern popular songs have been incorporated into the repertoire as well.
After incorporation into the Soviet Union, Latvian artists and writers were forced to follow the Socialist realism style of art. During the Soviet era, music became increasingly popular, with the most popular being songs from the 1980s. At this time, songs often made fun of the characteristics of Soviet life and were concerned about preserving Latvian identity. This aroused popular protests against the USSR and also gave rise to an increasing popularity of poetry. Since independence, theatre, scenography, choir music, and classical music have become the most notable branches of Latvian culture.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]
During July 2014, Riga will host the 8th World Choir Games as it plays host to over 15 000 choristers representing over 300 choirs and over 60 countries. The festival is the biggest of its kind in the world and is held every two years in a different host city.

===Cuisine===

Latvian cuisine typically consists of agricultural products, with meat featuring in most main meal dishes. Fish is commonly consumed due to Latvia's location on the Baltic Sea. Latvian cuisine has been influenced by the neighbouring countries. Common ingredients in Latvian recipes are found locally, such as potatoes, wheat, barley, cabbage, onions, eggs and pork. Latvian food is generally quite fatty, and uses few spices.
Grey peas and ham are generally considered as staple foods of Latvians. Sorrel soup is also consumed by Latvians."Typical Latvian Food and Drink Recipes." Li.lv. Accessed September 2011. Rupjmaize is a dark bread made from rye, considered the national staple.

===Sport===

Ice hockey is usually considered the most popular sport in Latvia. Latvia has had many famous hockey stars like Helmut Balderis, Artūrs Irbe, Kārlis Skrastiņš and Sandis Ozoliņš among others. Dinamo Riga is the country's strongest hockey club, playing in the Kontinental Hockey League. The 2006 IIHF World Championship was held in Riga, Latvia. 
The second most popular sport is basketball.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] At the moment the best known Latvian player is Andris Biedriņš who plays in the NBA. Latvia has a long basketballing tradition, as the Latvian national basketball team won the first ever EuroBasket in 1935 and silver medals in 1939, after losing an impressively tenacious final to fellow Balts – Lithuanians by one point. Latvia had many European basketball stars like Jānis Krūmiņš, Maigonis Valdmanis, Valdis Muižnieks, Valdis Valters, Igors Miglinieks, as well as the first Latvian NBA player Gundars Vētra. Former Latvian basketball club ASK Riga won prestigious Euroleague tournament three times in a row before being defunct. Currently, VEF Rīga, which competes in EuroCup, is the strongest professional basketball club in Latvia. BK Ventspils, which participates in EuroChallenge, is the second strongest basketball club in Latvia, previously winning LBL eight times and BBL in 2013.
Other popular sports include volleyball, floorball, football, tennis, cycling and bobsleigh. The Latvian national football team participated in 2004 UEFA Euro for the first time.
Latvia has participated successfully in both Winter and Summer Olympics. The most successful Olympic athlete in the history of independent Latvia has been Māris Štrombergs, who became a two-time Olympic champion in 2008 and 2012 at Men's BMX.
