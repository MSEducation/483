===Sterilization===

Infectious particles possessing nucleic acid are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by their effect on normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is no longer able to induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, radiation, and formalin treatments,[tpl]cite journal |author=Qin K, O'Donnell M, Zhao RY |title=Doppel: more rival than double to prion |journal=Neuroscience |volume=141 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16781817 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.04.057 [/tpl] although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure.

The World Health Organization recommends any of the following three procedures for the sterilization of all heat-resistant surgical instruments to ensure that they are not contaminated with prions:

===Debate===

Whether prions cause disease or are merely a symptom caused by a different agent is still debated by a minority of researchers. The following sections describe several hypotheses: Some pertain to the composition of the infectious agent (protein-only, protein with other components, virus, or other), while others pertain to its mechanism of reproduction.

====Protein-only hypothesis====

Prior to the discovery of prions, it was thought that all pathogens used nucleic acids to direct their replication. The "protein-only hypothesis" states that a protein structure can replicate without the use of nucleic acid. This was initially controversial as it contradicts the central dogma of molecular biology, which describes nucleic acid as the central form of replicative information.
Evidence in favor of a protein-only hypothesis includes:

====Genetic factors====

A gene for the normal protein has been identified: the PRNP gene.[tpl]cite journal |author=Oesch B, Westaway D, Wälchli M, et al. |title=A cellular gene encodes scrapie PrP 27–30 protein |journal=Cell |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=735–46 |year=1985|pmid=2859120 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(85)90333-2[/tpl] In all inherited cases of prion disease, there is a mutation in the PRNP gene.  Many different PRNP mutations have been identified and these proteins are more likely to fold into abnormal prion.[tpl]cite journal |author=Goldmann W |title=PrP genetics in ruminant transmissible spongiform encephalopathies |journal=Veterinary Research |volume=39 |issue=4 |page=30 |year=2008 |pmid=18284908 |doi=10.1051/vetres:2008010 [/tpl] Although this discovery puts a hole in the general prion hypothesis, that prions can aggregate only proteins of identical amino acid make-up.  These mutations can occur throughout the gene. Some mutations involve expansion of the octapeptide repeat region at the N-terminal of PrP. Other mutations that have been identified as a cause of inherited prion disease occur at positions 102, 117 & 198 (GSS), 178, 200, 210 & 232 (CJD) and 178 (Fatal Familial Insomnia, FFI).  The cause of prion disease can be sporadic, genetic, and infectious, or a combination of these factors.[tpl]cite journal |author=Geissen M, Krasemann S, Matschke J, Glatzel M |title=Understanding the natural variability of prion diseases |journal=Vaccine |volume=25 |issue=30 |pages=5631–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17391814 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.02.041 [/tpl] For example, to have scrapie, both an infectious agent and a susceptible genotype must be present.

====Multi-component hypothesis====

Despite much effort, significant titers of prion infectivity have never been produced by refolding pure PrP molecules, raising doubt about the validity of the "protein only" hypothesis.  In addition the "protein only" hypothesis fails to provide a molecular explanation for the ability of prion strains to target specific areas of the brain in distinct patterns.  These shortcomings, along with additional experimental data, have given rise to the "multi-component" or "cofactor variation" hypothesis.[tpl]cite journal|last=Supattapone|title=What makes a prion infectious?|journal=Science|year=2010|pmid=20185716|doi=10.1126/science.1187790|volume=327|issue=5969|pages=1091–2|first1=S.[/tpl]
In 2007, biochemist Surachai Supattapone and his colleagues at Dartmouth College produced purified infectious prions de novo from defined components (PrPC, co-purified lipids, and a synthetic polyanionic molecule).[tpl]cite journal |author=Deleault NR, Harris BT, Rees JR, Supattapone S |title=Formation of native prions from minimal components in vitro |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=104 |issue=23 |pages=9741–6 |year=2007|pmid=17535913 |pmc=1887554 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0702662104|bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.9741D [/tpl]  These researchers also showed that the polyanionic molecule required for prion formation was selectively incorporated into high-affinity  complexes with PrP molecules, leading them to hypothesize that infectious prions may be composed of multiple host components, including PrP, lipid, and polyanionic molecules, rather than PrPSc alone.[tpl]cite journal |author=Geoghegan JC, Valdes PA, Orem NR, et al. |title=Selective incorporation of polyanionic molecules into hamster prions |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=282 |issue=50 |pages=36341–53 |year=2007|pmid=17940287 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M704447200|pmc=3091164[/tpl]
In 2010, Jiyan Ma and colleagues at The Ohio State University produced infectious prions from a recipe of bacterially expressed recombinant PrP, POPG phospholipid, and RNA, further supporting the multi-component hypothesis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wang F, Wang X, Yuan CG, Ma J |title=Generating a prion with bacterially expressed recombinant prion protein |journal=Science |volume=327 |issue=5969 |pages=1132–5 |year=2010|pmid=20110469 |pmc=2893558 |doi=10.1126/science.1183748|bibcode = 2010Sci...327.1132W [/tpl]  This finding is in contrast to studies that found minimally infectious prions produced from recombinant PrP alone.[tpl]cite journal |author=Legname G, Baskakov IV, Nguyen HO, et al. |title=Synthetic mammalian prions |journal=Science |volume=305 |issue=5684 |pages=673–6 |year=2004|pmid=15286374 |doi=10.1126/science.1100195|bibcode = 2004Sci...305..673L [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Makarava N, Kovacs GG, Bocharova O, et al. |title=Recombinant prion protein induces a new transmissible prion disease in wild-type animals |journal=Acta Neuropathologica |volume=119 |issue=2 |pages=177–87 |year=2010|pmid=20052481 |pmc=2808531 |doi=10.1007/s00401-009-0633-x[/tpl]
In 2012, Supattapone and colleagues purified the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine as a solitary endogenous cofactor capable of facilitating the formation of high-titer recombinant prions derived from multiple prion strains.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=22586108 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1204498109 | volume=109 | issue=22 | title=Isolation of phosphatidylethanolamine as a solitary cofactor for prion formation in the absence of nucleic acids |date=May 2012 | author=Deleault NR, Piro JR, Walsh DJ, et al. | journal=Proc.

U.S.A. | pages=8546–51|pmc=3365173|bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.8546D [/tpl]  They also reported that the cofactor is essential for maintaining the infectious conformation of PrPSc, and that cofactor molecules dictate the strain properties of infectious prions.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=22711839 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1206999109 | volume=109 | issue=28 | title=Cofactor molecules maintain infectious conformation and restrict strain properties in purified prions |date=July 2012 | author=Deleault NR, Walsh DJ, Piro JR, et al. | journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | pages=E1938–46|pmc=3396481|bibcode = 2012PNAS..109E1938D [/tpl]

====Heavy metal poisoning hypothesis====

Recent reports suggest that imbalance of brain metal homeostasis is a significant cause of PrPSc-associated neurotoxicity, though the underlying mechanisms are difficult to explain based on existing information. Proposed hypotheses include a functional role for PrPC in metal metabolism, and loss of this function due to aggregation to the disease-associated PrPSc form as the cause of brain metal imbalance. Other views suggest gain of toxic function by PrPSc due to sequestration of PrPC-associated metals within the aggregates, resulting in the generation of redox-active PrPSc complexes. The physiological implications of some PrPC-metal interactions are known, while others are still unclear. The pathological implications of PrPC-metal interaction include metal-induced oxidative damage, and in some instances conversion of PrPC to a PrPSc-like form.[tpl]cite book |author= Singh N et al.| year=2010 |chapter=Prion Protein and Metal Interaction: Physiological and Pathological Implications|title=The Prion Protein | publisher=Savanna Press | isbn= 978-0-9543335-2-2[/tpl]

====Viral hypothesis====

The protein-only hypothesis has been criticised by those maintaining that the simplest explanation of the evidence to date is viral.[tpl]cite journal |author=Manuelidis L |title=A 25 nm virion is the likely cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies |journal=Journal of Cellular Biochemistry |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=897–915 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17044041 |doi=10.1002/jcb.21090[/tpl] For more than a decade, Yale University neuropathologist Laura Manuelidis has been proposing that prion diseases are caused instead by an unidentified slow virus. In January 2007, she and her colleagues published an article reporting to have found a virus in 10%, or less, of their scrapie-infected cells in culture.[tpl]cite news |url=http://opa.yale.edu/news/article.aspx?status=301&id=1659 |title=Pathogenic Virus Found in Mad Cow Cells |publisher=Yale |date=2007-02-02 |accessdate=2010-02-28[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Manuelidis L, Yu ZX, Barquero N, Banquero N, Mullins B |title=Cells infected with scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agents produce intracellular 25-nm virus-like particles |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=104 |issue=6 |pages=1965–70 |year=2007 |pmid=17267596 |pmc=1794316 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0610999104|bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.1965M [/tpl]
The virion hypothesis states that TSEs are caused by a replicable informational molecule (which is likely to be a nucleic acid) bound to PrP. Many TSEs, including scrapie and BSE, show strains with specific and distinct biological properties, a feature that supporters of the virion hypothesis feel prions do not explain.
Evidence in favor of a viral hypothesis includes:[tpl]cite book | title=Prion Disease| last=Baker & Ridley| publisher=Humana Press | year=1996 | location=New Jersey| isbn=0-89603-342-2[/tpl]
Recent studies propagating TSE infectivity in cell-free reactions[tpl]cite journal |author=Castilla J, Saá P, Hetz C, Soto C |title=In vitro generation of infectious scrapie prions |journal=Cell |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=195–206 |year=2005 |pmid=15851027 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.02.011 [/tpl] and in purified component chemical reactions strongly suggest against TSE viral nature.  More recently, using a similar defined recipe of multiple components (PrP, POPG lipid, RNA), Jiyan Ma and colleagues generated infectious prions from recombinant PrP expressed from E. coli, casting further doubt on the viral hypothesis.

==Fungi==

Fungal proteins exhibiting templated conformational change were discovered in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by Reed Wickner in the early 1990s. For their mechanistic similarity to mammalian prions, they were termed yeast prions.  Subsequent to this, a prion has also been found in the fungus Podospora anserina. These prions behave similarly to PrP, but, in general, are nontoxic to their hosts. Susan Lindquist's group at the Whitehead Institute has argued some of the fungal prions are not associated with any disease state, but may have a useful role; however, researchers at the NIH have also provided arguments suggesting that fungal prions could be considered a diseased state.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dong J, Bloom JD, Goncharov V, et al. |title=Probing the role of PrP repeats in conformational conversion and amyloid assembly of chimeric yeast prions |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=282 |issue=47 |pages=34204–12 |year=2007|pmid=17893150 |pmc=2262835 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M704952200 [/tpl] Thus, the issue of whether fungal proteins are diseases, or have evolved for some specific functions, still remains unresolved.[tpl]cite journal |author=Halfmann R, Alberti S, Lindquist S |title=Prions, protein homeostasis, and phenotypic diversity |journal=Trends in Cell Biology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=125–33 |year=2010 |pmid=20071174 |pmc=2846750 |doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2009.12.003 [/tpl]
As of 2012, there are eight known prion proteins in fungi, seven in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sup35, Rnq1, Ure2, Swi1, Mot3, Cyc8, and Mod5) and one in Podospora anserina (HET-s).[tpl]contradict-inline|The table below listed 8 from S. cerevisiae as of 2010|date=November 2012[/tpl] The article that reported the discovery of a prion form the Mca1 protein has recently been retracted due to the fact that the data could not be reproduced.[tpl]cite journal|last=Nemecek|first=J|coauthors=Nakayashiki, T, Wickner, RB|title=Retraction for Nemecek et al.: A prion of yeast metacaspase homolog (Mca1p) detected by a genetic screen|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Jun 14, 2011|volume=108|issue=24|page=10022|pmid=21628591|doi=10.1073/pnas.1107490108|pmc=3116407[/tpl] Notably, most of the fungal prions are based on glutamine/asparagine-rich sequences, with the exception of HET-s and Mod5.
Research into fungal prions has given strong support to the protein-only concept, since purified protein extracted from cells with a prion state has been demonstrated to convert the normal form of the protein into a misfolded form in vitro, and in the process, preserve the information corresponding to different strains of the prion state. It has also shed some light on prion domains, which are regions in a protein that promote the conversion into a prion. Fungal prions have helped to suggest mechanisms of conversion that may apply to all prions, though fungal prions appear distinct from infectious mammalian prions in the lack of cofactor required for propagation. The characteristic prion domains may vary between species—e.g., characteristic fungal prion domains are not found in mammalian prions.

==Potential treatments and diagnosis==

Advancements in computer modeling have allowed scientists to identify compounds that can treat prion-caused diseases, such as one compound found to bind a cavity in the PrPC and stabilize the conformation, reducing the amount of harmful PrPSc.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kuwata K, Nishida N, Matsumoto T, et al. |title=Hot spots in prion protein for pathogenic conversion |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=104 |issue=29 |pages=11921–6 |year=2007  |pmid=17616582 |pmc=1924567 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0702671104 |bibcode = 2007PNAS..10411921K [/tpl]
Recently, antiprion antibodies capable of crossing the blood-brain-barrier and targeting cytosolic prion protein (an otherwise major obstacle in prion therapeutics) have been described.[tpl]cite doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0009804[/tpl]
In the last decade, some progress dealing with ultra-high-pressure inactivation of prion infectivity in
processed meat has been reported.[tpl]cite doi|10.1073/pnas.1031826100[/tpl]
In 2011 it was discovered that prions could be degraded by lichens.[tpl]cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Christopher|coauthors=James P. Bennett, Steven M. Biro, Juan Camilo Duque-Velasquez, Cynthia M.

There continues to be a very practical problem with diagnosis of prion diseases, including BSE and CJD. They have an incubation period of months to decades, during which there are no symptoms, even though the pathway of converting the normal brain PrP protein into the toxic, disease-related PrPSc form has started. At present, there is virtually no way to detect PrPSc reliably except by examining the brain  using neuropathological and immunohistochemical methods after death. Accumulation of the abnormally folded PrPSc  form of the PrP protein is a characteristic of the disease, but it is present at very low levels in easily accessible body fluids like blood or urine. Researchers have tried to develop methods to measure PrPSc, but there are still no fully accepted methods for use in materials such as blood.
In 2010, a team from New York described detection of PrPSc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrPSc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrPSc, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus so that it is totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser. The technique allowed detection of PrPSc after many fewer cycles of conversion than others have achieved, substantially reducing the possibility of artefacts, as well as speeding up the assay. The researchers also tested their method on blood samples from apparently healthy sheep that went on to develop scrapie. The animals’ brains were analysed once any symptoms became apparent. The researchers could, therefore, compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited symptoms of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals’ lives, and from uninfected animals. The results showed very clearly that PrPSc could be detected in the blood of animals long before the symptoms appeared.[tpl]cite journal |title=Detecting Prions in Blood |journal=Microbiology Today. |page=195 |date=August 2010 |url= https://www.sgm.ac.uk/pubs/micro_today/pdf/081010.pdf |accessdate=2011-08-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.bionosis.com/news/Bionosis%20PrioNet%20Poster.pdf | title = SOFIA: An Assay Platform for Ultrasensitive Detection of PrPSc in Brain and Blood | publisher =  SUNY Downstate Medical Center | authorlink = Rubenstein, R., et al. | accessdate = 2011-08-19[/tpl]
