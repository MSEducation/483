Stenehed is an Iron Age grave field in western Sweden. It is located about 1 km southwest of Hällevadsholm, Munkedal Municipality, Västra Götaland County. The area contains about 45 graves, a stone circle, a stone ship, and a row of menhirs.
Originally, there were eleven or twelve menhirs at the site; today, there are nine. The tallest one is 3.3 m; the lowest - 1.4 m.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sotenas.se/kultur/kulturarv/forntid/jarnalderistenehed.4.23a44ef311329f04b9d80007531.html | title=Järnålder i Stenehed | accessdate=2010-12-31 | publisher=Munkedal Municipality[/tpl] They are placed in a row, according to their heights. In 1980, astronomer Curt Roslund suggested that they form an astronomical calendar, similar to Stonehenge in England.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www9.vgregion.se/vastarvet/bm/up/bohuskarta/detalj1.asp?ID=44 | title=Stenehed.
