==Plot==

Darren and Connor are two brothers who, as teenagers, realize that they have deep, strong intimate feelings for each other and not just those of brothers. They enter into a quite a close romantic and sexual relationship. While happy together, they fear what would happen if their gay relationship were ever discovered. Their fears are realized when their mother walks in on them sleeping naked together. When Connor overhears their father say that they will never be able to see each other again, the distraught brothers steal a family car and flee to a motel. Deciding that a world that can't understand them is a world in which they do not wish to live, and with a police officer discovering the car, the boys commit suicide by handcuffing themselves to each other through the bottom rung of a ladder in the motel swimming pool. As they are underwater, they spend their last minutes together being happy with one another and kissing.
