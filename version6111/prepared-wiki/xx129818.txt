The Alouettes follow in the town's hockey tradition of the Sturgeon Falls Lynx who played in the town from 1994 until 2002 when they became the North Bay Skyhawks.
The first game in the Alouettes' history took place on September 9, 2006 against the Richmond Hill Rams.  The end result was a 5-1 loss.  The first goal in Alouette history was scored by Matt Mascarin.  Justin Longchamps took the loss in goal in the first game in Alouettes history, but played well facing more than 50 shots.

The Als celebrated their first victory on September 29, 2006.  They defeated the Toronto Canada Moose by a score of 5-3.

In their 2007-2008 season, the Alouettes welcomed an entirely new squad, having only 2 returning players, Mackenzie Charron and Kory Cashaback. The 1st ever shutout in Alouettes history was recorded on Friday, September 28th by Tristan Jones, making 30 saves and adding an assist on his way to a 9-0 destruction of the struggling Toronto Canada Moose.
