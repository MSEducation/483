Strife is an upcoming multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed by S2 Games. This is S2 Games' second MOBA game aimed for more casual player base than Heroes of Newerth, most notably incorporating various gameplay elements that focus on heavily reducing player toxicity and introducing persistent mechanics outside of the arena, including Pets and Crafting. The game uses the same graphic engine as Heroes of Newerth (K2 Engine) with some improvements on lighting and physics.http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/8/4592582/strife-s2-games-moba

==Gameplay==

Strife pits two teams of players against each other, both teams are based at opposite corners of the map in their respective bases. Bases consist of one central structure, creep spawn points, three generators and a hero spawning pool. The goal of the game is to destroy the central structure of the opposite base. Players achieve this by selecting heroes with unique skills to combat the other team, both teams can select the same heroes. Each game, a player chooses one hero to be for the duration of the match. Every hero has four abilities that may be acquired and upgraded as the hero gains experience and levels up.
