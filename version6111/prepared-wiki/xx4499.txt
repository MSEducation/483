Honey [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ʌ|n|i[/tpl] is a sweet food made by bees using nectar from flowers. The variety produced by honey bees (the genus Apis) is the one most commonly referred to, as it is the type of honey collected by most beekeepers and consumed by people. Honeys produced by other bees (bumblebees, stingless bees) and insects (honey wasps) have different properties, and they are not discussed in this article.
Honey bees transform nectar into honey by a process of regurgitation and evaporation. They store it as a primary food source in wax honeycombs inside the beehive.
Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has approximately the same relative sweetness as granulated sugar.National Honey Board. "Carbohydrates and the Sweetness of Honey". Last accessed 1 June 2012.Oregon State University. "What is the relative sweetness of different sugars and sugar substitutes?". Retrieved 1 June 2012. It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor that leads some people to prefer it over sugar and other sweeteners. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey because of its low water activity of 0.6.[tpl]cite book|author=Prescott, Lansing; Harley, John P. and Klein, Donald A. |title=Microbiology|publisher=WCB/McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|year=1999|isbn=0-697-35439-3[/tpl] However, honey sometimes contains dormant endospores of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which can be dangerous to infants, as the endospores can transform into toxin-producing bacteria in infants' immature intestinal tracts, leading to illness and even death.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Roger L.|last2=Hatheway,|first2=Charles|last3=Swerdflow,|first3=David L.|title=Botulism in the United States: A Clinical and Epidemiologic Review|year=1998|pmid=9696731|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=129|issue=3|pages=221–8|doi=10.1059/0003-4819-129-3-199808010-00011|doi_inactivedate=02 February 2014[/tpl]
Honey has had a long history in human consumption, and is used in various foods and beverages as a sweetener and flavoring. It also has a role in religion and symbolism. Flavors of honey vary based on the nectar source, and various types and grades of honey are available. It has also been used in various medicinal traditions to treat ailments. The study of pollens and spores in raw honey (melissopalynology) can determine floral sources of honey.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.scirpus.ca/cap/articles/paper017.htm|author=Bryant, Vaughn M., Jr.|title=Pollen Contents of Honey|journal=CAP Newsletter|volume=24|issue=1|pages=10–24|year=2001[/tpl] Bees carry an electrostatic charge whereby they attract other particles in addition to pollen, which become incorporated into their honey; the honey can be analysed by the techniques of melissopalynology in area environmental studies of radioactive particles, dust and particulate pollution.[tpl]cite journal|author=Mercuri AM, Porrini C.|title=Melissopalynological analysis applied to air pollution studies in urban areas of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy)|journal=Aerobiologia|volume=7|issue=1|pages=38–48|year=1991|doi=10.1007/BF02450016[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Tonelli D, Gattavecchia E, Ghini S, Porrini C, Celli G, Mercuri AM.|title=Honey bees and their products as indicators of environmental radioactive pollution|journal=Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=141|issue=2|pages=427–436|year=1990|doi=10.1007/BF02035809[/tpl]

==Formation==

Honey's natural sugars are dehydrated, which prevents fermentation, with added enzymes to modify and transform their chemical composition and pH. Invertases and digestive acids hydrolyze sucrose to give the monosaccharides glucose and fructose.
The invertase is one of these enzymes synthesized by the body of the insect.
Honey bees transform saccharides into honey by a process of regurgitation, a number of times, until it is partially digested. The bees do the regurgitation and digestion as a group. After the last regurgitation, the aqueous solution is still high in water, so the process continues by evaporation of much of the water and enzymatic transformation.
Honey is produced by bees as a food source. To produce a single jar of honey, foraging honey bees have to travel the equivalent of three times around the world.http://www.ibra.org.uk/categories/faq#FAQ_19 International Bee Research Association. In cold weather or when fresh food sources are scarce, bees use their stored honey as their source of energy.[tpl]Wayback |date=20100305094736 |url=http://www.honey.com/nhb/about-honey/honey-and-bees |title="Honey and Bees." [/tpl] National Honey Board. By contriving for bee swarms to nest in artificial hives, people have been able to semidomesticate the insects, and harvest excess honey. In the hive (or in a wild nest), there are three types of bees:
The worker bees raise larvae and collect the nectar that will become honey in the hive. Leaving the hive, they collect sugar-rich flower nectar and return.
In the hive, the bees use their "honey stomachs" to ingest and regurgitate the nectar a number of times until it is partially digested.Standifer LN. "Honey Bee Nutrition And Supplemental Feeding". Excerpted from "Beekeeping in the United States." Retrieved 14 April 2007. Invertase synthesized by the bees and digestive acids hydrolyze sucrose to give the same mixture of glucose and fructose. The bees work together as a group with the regurgitation and digestion until the product reaches a desired quality. It is then stored in honeycomb cells. After the final regurgitation, the honeycomb is left unsealed. However, the nectar is still high in both water content and natural yeasts, which, unchecked, would cause the sugars in the nectar to ferment. The process continues as bees inside the hive fan their wings, creating a strong draft across the honeycomb, which enhances evaporation of much of the water from the nectar. This reduction in water content raises the sugar concentration and prevents fermentation. Ripe honey, as removed from the hive by a beekeeper, has a long shelf life, and will not ferment if properly sealed.

==Physical and chemical properties==

The physical properties of honey vary, depending on water content, the type of flora used to produce it (pasturage), temperature, and the proportion of the specific sugars it contains. Fresh honey is a supersaturated liquid, containing more sugar than the water can typically dissolve at ambient temperatures. At room temperature, honey is a supercooled liquid, in which the glucose will precipitate into solid granules. This forms a semisolid solution of precipitated glucose crystals in a solution of fructose and other ingredients.

===Phase transitions===

The melting point of crystallized honey is between [tpl]convert|40|and|50|C|F[/tpl], depending on its composition. Below this temperature, honey can be either in a metastable state, meaning that it will not crystallize until a seed crystal is added, or, more often, it is in a "labile" state, being saturated with enough sugars to crystallize spontaneously.Root, p. 355 The rate of crystallization is affected by many factors, but the primary factor is the ratio of the main sugars: fructose to glucose. Honeys that are supersaturated with a very high percentage of glucose, such as brassica honey, will crystallize almost immediately after harvesting, while honeys with a low percentage of glucose, such as chestnut or tupelo honey, do not crystallize. Some types of honey may produce very large but few crystals, while others will produce many small crystals.Tomasik, Piotr (2004) Chemical and functional properties of food saccharides, CRC Press, p. 74, ISBN 0-8493-1486-0
Crystallization is also affected by water content, because a high percentage of water will inhibit crystallization, as will a high dextrin content. Temperature also affects the rate of crystallization, with the fastest growth occurring between [tpl]convert|13|and|17|C|F[/tpl]. Crystal nuclei (seeds) tend to form more readily if the honey is disturbed, by stirring, shaking or agitating, rather than if left at rest. However, the nucleation of microscopic seed-crystals is greatest between [tpl]convert|5|and|8|C|F[/tpl]. Therefore, larger but fewer crystals tend to form at higher temperatures, while smaller but more-numerous crystals usually form at lower temperatures. Below 5 °C, the honey will not crystallize and, thus, the original texture and flavor can be preserved indefinitely.
Since honey normally exists below its melting point, it is a supercooled liquid. At very low temperatures, honey will not freeze solid. Instead, as the temperatures become colder, the viscosity of honey increases. Like most viscous liquids, the honey will become thick and sluggish with decreasing temperature. At [tpl]convert|-20|C|F[/tpl], honey may appear or even feel solid, but it will continue to flow at very slow rates. Honey has a glass transition between [tpl]convert|-42|and|-51|C|F[/tpl]. Below this temperature, honey enters a glassy state and will become an amorphous solid (noncrystalline).[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1021/jf981070g|title=Glass Transition Temperature of Honey as a Function of Water Content As Determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|year=1999|last1=Kántor|first1=Zoltán|last2=Pitsi|first2=Guido|last3=Thoen|first3=Jan|volume=47|issue=6|pages=2327–2330|pmid=10794630[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1038/35047037|year=2000|last1=Vidal Russell|first1=E.|last2=Israeloff|first2=N. E.|journal=Nature|volume=408|issue=6813|pages=695–698|pmid=11130066|title=Direct observation of molecular cooperativity near the glass transition[/tpl]

===Viscosity===

The viscosity of honey is affected greatly by both temperature and water content. The higher the humidity, the easier honey will flow. Above its melting point, however, water has little effect on viscosity. Aside from water content, the composition of honey also has little effect on viscosity, with the exception of a few types. At [tpl]convert|25|C|F[/tpl], honey with 14% humidity will generally have a viscosity of around 400 poise, while a honey containing 20% humidity will have a viscosity of around 20 poise. Viscosity increase due to temperature occurs very slowly at first. A honey containing 16% humidity, at [tpl]convert|70|C|F[/tpl], will have a viscosity of around 2 poise, while at [tpl]convert|30|C|F[/tpl], the viscosity will be around 70 poise. As cooling progresses, honey will become more viscous at an increasingly rapid rate, reaching 600 poise around [tpl]convert|14|C|F[/tpl]. However, while honey is very viscous, it has rather low surface tension.[tpl]cite book|title=Value-added products from beekeeping|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BzzBBbnIJhIC&pg=PA7|year=1996|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|isbn=978-92-5-103819-2|pages=7–8[/tpl]Bogdanov, Stefan (2009) [tpl]Wayback |date=20090920094501 |url=http://www.bee-hexagon.net/files/file/fileE/Honey/4PhysicalPropertiesHoney.pdf |title="Physical Properties of Honey"[/tpl], Chapter 4 in Book of Honey, Bee Product Science.
A few types of honey have unusual viscous properties. Honey from heather or manuka display thixotropic properties. These types of honey enter a gel-like state when motionless, but then liquify when stirred.Krell, pp. 5–6

===Electrical and optical properties===

Since honey contains electrolytes, in the form of acids and minerals, it exhibits varying degrees of electrical conductivity. Measurements of the electrical conductivity are used to determine the quality of honey in terms of ash content.
The effect honey has on light is useful for determining the type and quality. Variations in the water content alter the refractive index of honey. Water content can easily be measured with a refractometer. Typically, the refractive index for honey will range from 1.504 at 13% humidity, to 1.474 at 25%. Honey also has an effect on polarized light, in that it will rotate the polarization plane. The fructose will give a negative rotation, while the glucose will give a positive one. The overall rotation can be used to measure the ratio of the mixture.Root, p. 348

===Hygroscopy and fermentation===

Honey has the ability to absorb moisture directly from the air, a phenomenon called hygroscopy. The amount of water the honey will absorb is dependent on the relative humidity of the air. Because honey contains yeast, this hygroscopic nature requires that honey be stored in sealed containers to prevent fermentation, which usually begins if the honey's humidity rises much above 25%. Honey will tend to absorb more water in this manner than the individual sugars would allow on their own, which may be due to other ingredients it contains.
Fermentation of honey will usually occur after crystallization because, without the glucose, the liquid portion of the honey primarily consists of a concentrated mixture of the fructose, acids, and water, providing the yeast with enough of an increase in the water percentage for growth. Honey that is to be stored at room temperature for long periods of time is often pasteurized, to kill any yeast, by heating it above [tpl]convert|70|C|F[/tpl].

===Thermal characteristics===

Like all sugar compounds, honey will caramelize if heated sufficiently, becoming darker in color, and eventually burn. However, honey contains fructose, which caramelizes at lower temperatures than the glucose.Hans-Dieter Belitz, Werner Grosch, Peter Schieberle Food chemistry Springer Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg 2004 p. 884 ISBN 3-540-69933-3 The temperature at which caramelization begins varies, depending on the composition, but is typically between [tpl]convert|70|and|110|C|F[/tpl]. Honey also contains acids, which act as catalysts, decreasing the caramelization temperature even more.Zdzisław E. Sikorski Chemical and functional properties of food components CRC Press 2007 p. 121 ISBN 0-8493-9675-1 Of these acids, the amino acids, which occur in very small amounts, play an important role in the darkening of honey. The amino acids form darkened compounds called melanoidins, during a Maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction will occur slowly at room temperature, taking from a few to several months to show visible darkening, but will speed-up dramatically with increasing temperatures. However, the reaction can also be slowed by storing the honey at colder temperatures.Root, p. 350
Unlike many other liquids, honey has very poor thermal conductivity, taking a long time to reach thermal equilibrium. Melting crystallized honey can easily result in localized caramelization if the heat source is too hot, or if it is not evenly distributed. However, honey will take substantially longer to liquify when just above the melting point than it will at elevated temperatures. Melting 20 kilograms of crystallized honey, at [tpl]convert|40|C|F[/tpl], can take up to 24 hours, while 50 kilograms may take twice as long. These times can be cut nearly in half by heating at [tpl]convert|50|C|F[/tpl]. However, many of the minor substances in honey can be affected greatly by heating, changing the flavor, aroma, or other properties, so heating is usually done at the lowest temperature possible for the shortest amount of time.Krell, pp. 40–43

===Acid content===

The average pH of honey is 3.9, but can range from 3.4 to 6.1. Honey contains many kinds of acids, both organic and amino. However, the different types and their amounts vary considerably, depending on the type of honey. These acids may be aromatic or aliphatic (non-aromatic). The aliphatic acids contribute greatly to the flavor of honey by interacting with the flavors of other ingredients. Gluconic acid, for instance, is a flavor enhancer.
Honey can contain up to 18 of the 20 amino acids. However, amino acid content is almost negligible in honey, accounting for only 0.05–0.1% of the composition. The main amino acid is proline. Amino acids are derived almost solely from the bodies of the bees.
Organic acids comprise most of the acids in honey, accounting for 0.17–1.17% of the mixture. Gluconic acid is the most prevalent. Gluconic acid is formed by the actions of an enzyme called glucose oxidase. Other organic acids are minor, consisting of formic, acetic, butyric, citric, lactic, malic, pyroglutamic, propionic, valeric, capronic, palmitic, and succinic, among many others.pH and Acids in Honey.

==In history, culture, and folklore==

Honey use and production has a long and varied history. In many cultures, honey has associations that go beyond its use as a food. Honey is frequently used as a talisman and symbol of sweetness.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]

===Religious significance===

In Hinduism, honey (Madhu) is one of the five elixirs of immortality (Panchamrita). In temples, honey is poured over the deities in a ritual called Madhu abhisheka. The Vedas and other ancient literature mention the use of honey as a great medicinal and health food.A Meaningful Story of Buddha, Elephant and Monkey by Marguerite Theophil, United Press International, 16 November 2006, accessed 2008-08-09
In Jewish tradition, honey is a symbol for the new year, Rosh Hashanah. At the traditional meal for that holiday, apple slices are dipped in honey and eaten to bring a sweet new year. Some Rosh Hashanah greetings show honey and an apple, symbolizing the feast. In some congregations, small straws of honey are given out to usher in the new year.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
The Hebrew Bible contains many references to honey. In the Book of Judges, Samson found a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of a lion (14:8). In Old Testament law, offerings were made in the temple to God. The Book of Leviticus says that “Every grain offering you bring to the Lord must be made without yeast, for you are not to burn any yeast or honey in a food offering presented to the Lord” (2:11). In the Books of Samuel Jonathan is forced into a confrontation with his father King Saul after eating honey in violation of a rash oath Saul made (14:24–47). The Book of Exodus famously describes the Promised Land as a "land flowing with milk and honey" (33:3).

In Buddhism, honey plays an important role in the festival of Madhu Purnima, celebrated in India and Bangladesh. The day commemorates Buddha's making peace among his disciples by retreating into the wilderness. The legend has it that while he was there, a monkey brought him honey to eat. On Madhu Purnima, Buddhists remember this act by giving honey to monks. The monkey's gift is frequently depicted in Buddhist art.

According to hadith, Prophet Muhammad strongly recommended honey for healing purposes.Sahih Bukhari vol. 7, book 71, number 584, 585, 588 and 603. The Qur'an promotes honey as a nutritious and healthy food. Below is the English translation of those specific verses.

==Collecting honey==

Honey is collected from wild bee colonies, or from domesticated beehives. Wild bee nests are sometimes located by following a honeyguide bird.
Collecting honey is typically achieved by using smoke from a bee smoker to pacify the bees; this causes the bees to attempt to save the resources of the hive from a possible forest fire, and makes them far less aggressive. The honeycomb is removed from the hive and the honey is extracted from that, often using a honey extractor. The honey is then filtered. In many cases the beekeeper will responsibly leave enough honey in the beehive for the colony to survive. If extra food is required to maintain the colony the beekeeper may provide the hive with unprocessed honey or a honey substitute such as sugar water (in the fall) or crystalline sugar (in the winter - a "candyboard") so that the hive does not starve.

==Modern uses==

===As a food and in cooking===

The main uses of honey are in cooking, baking, as a spread on bread, and as an addition to various beverages, such as tea, and as a sweetener in some commercial beverages. According to The National Honey Board (a USDA-overseen organization), "honey stipulates a pure product that does not allow for the addition of any other substance...this includes, but is not limited to, water or other sweeteners".Definition of honey and honey products. (PDF) . Retrieved on 9 January 2012. Honey barbecue and honey mustard are common and popular sauce flavors.

===As a fermentable===

Honey is the main ingredient in the alcoholic beverage mead, which is also known as "honey wine" or "honey beer". Historically, the ferment for mead was honey's naturally occurring yeast. Honey is also used as an adjunct in some beers.
Honey wine, or mead, is typically (modern era) made with a honey and water mixture with a pack of yeast added for fermentation. Primary fermentation usually takes 40 days, after which the must needs to be racked into a secondary fermentation vessel and left to sit about 35–40 more days. If done properly, fermentation will be finished by this point (though if a sparkling mead is desired, fermentation can be restarted after bottling by the addition of a small amount of sugar), but most meads require aging for 6–9 months or more in order to be palatable.

==Nutrition==

Honey is a mixture of sugars and other compounds. With respect to carbohydrates, honey is mainly fructose (about 38.5%) and glucose (about 31.0%), making it similar to the synthetically produced inverted sugar syrup, which is approximately 48% fructose, 47% glucose, and 5% sucrose. Honey's remaining carbohydrates include maltose, sucrose, and other complex carbohydrates. As with all nutritive sweeteners, honey is mostly sugars and contains only trace amounts of vitamins or minerals.[tpl]Cite book|title=Questions Most Frequently Asked About Sugar|publisher = American Sugar Alliance|url=http://ptfs.library.cmu.edu/awweb/main.jsp?flag=browse&smd=1&awdid=1[/tpl]Nutrient data for 19296, Honey.

As low as 7% level of addition can be detected.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Hivelights|volume=12|issue=1|year=1999|author=Barry, Carla |url=http://www.honeycouncil.ca/users/folder.asp?FolderID=4846|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080617102807/http://www.honeycouncil.ca/users/folder.asp?FolderID=4846|archivedate=17 June 2008|title=The detection of C4 sugars in honey|publisher=Canadian Honey Council[/tpl]

==Classification==

Honey is classified by its floral source, and there are also divisions according to the packaging and processing used. There are also regional honeys. Honey is also graded on its color and optical density by USDA standards, graded on a scale called the Pfund scale, which ranges from 0 for "water white" honey to more than 114 for "dark amber" honey.Value-added products from beekeeping. Chapter 2. Fao.org. Retrieved on 14 April 2011.

===Floral source===

Generally, honey is classified by the floral source of the nectar from which it was made. Honeys can be from specific types of flower nectars or can be blended after collection. The pollen in honey is traceable to floral source and therefore region of origin. The rheological & melissopalynological properties of honey can be used to identify the major plant nectar source used in its production.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.minervascientific.co.uk/bulletins/Rheological_Properties_of_Honey.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Rheological & Mellisopalynological Properties of Honey |publisher=Minerva Scientific|accessdate=10 December 2012|quote="If however, rheological measurements are made on a given sample it can be deduced that the sample is predominantly Manuka (Graph 2) or Kanuka (Graph 3) or a mixture of the two plant species"[/tpl]

====Blended====

Most commercially available honey is blended, meaning it is a mixture of two or more honeys differing in floral source, color, flavor, density or geographic origin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.honey.com/images/downloads/honeydefs.pdf|format=PDF|title=Definition of Honey and Honey Products|publisher=National Honey Issac Board|accessdate=3 February 2011|quote="Blended Honey: A homogeneous mixture of two or more honeys differing in floral source, color, flavor, density or geographic origin."[/tpl]

====Polyfloral====

Polyfloral honey, also known as wildflower honey,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.honey.com/newsroom/press-kits/honey-color-and-flavor|title=Honey Color and Flavor|publisher=National Honey Board|accessdate=3 February 2011|quote=Wildflower honey is often used to describe honey from miscellaneous and undefined flower sources.[/tpl] is derived from the nectar of many types of flowers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.honeybook.net/polyfloral_honey.shtml|title=Varieties of honey: Polyfloral honey|publisher=The Honey Book|accessdate=10 November 2007|quote=Honey that is from wild or commercialized honeybees that is derived from many types of flowers is a resulting Polyfloral honey.[/tpl]
The taste may vary from year to year, and the aroma and the flavor can be more or less intense, depending on which bloomings are prevalent.Mountain Wildflower Honey. Mieliditalia.it. Retrieved on 6 February 2011.

====Monofloral====

Monofloral honey is made primarily from the nectar of one type of flower. Different monofloral honeys have a distinctive flavor and color because of differences between their principal nectar sources.The Colours Of Honey. Mieliditalia.it. Retrieved on 6 February 2011. To produce monofloral honey, beekeepers keep beehives in an area where the bees have access to only one type of flower. In practice, because of the difficulties in containing bees, a small proportion of any honey will be from additional nectar from other flower types.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] Typical examples of North American monofloral honeys are clover, orange blossom, blueberry, sage, tupelo, buckwheat, fireweed, mesquite and sourwood. Some typical European examples include thyme, thistle, heather, acacia, dandelion, sunflower, honeysuckle, and varieties from lime and chestnut trees.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] In North Africa (e.g. Egypt) examples include clover, cotton, and citrus (mainly orange blossoms).[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

====Honeydew honey====

Instead of taking nectar, bees can take honeydew, the sweet secretions of aphids or other plant sap-sucking insects. Honeydew honey is very dark brown in color, with a rich fragrance of stewed fruit or fig jam, and is not as sweet as nectar honeys. Germany's Black Forest is a well known source of honeydew-based honeys, as well as some regions in Bulgaria, Tara (mountain) in Serbia and Northern California in the United States. In Greece, pine honey (a type of honeydew honey) constitutes 60–65% of the annual honey production.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gounari|first=Sofia|title=Studies on the phenology of Marchalina hellenica (gen.) (Hemiptera: coccoidea, margarodidae) in relation to honeydew flow|journal=Journal of apicultural research|volume=45|issue=1|pages=8–12 |year=2006|doi=10.3896/IBRA.1.45.1.03[/tpl] Honeydew honey is popular in some areas, but in other areas beekeepers have difficulty selling the stronger flavored product.
The production of honeydew honey has some complications and dangers. The honey has a much larger proportion of indigestibles than light floral honeys, thus causing dysentery to the bees, resulting in the death of colonies in areas with cold winters. Good beekeeping management requires the removal of honeydew prior to winter in colder areas. Bees collecting this resource also have to be fed protein supplements, as honeydew lacks the protein-rich pollen accompaniment gathered from flowers.

===Classification by packaging and processing===

Generally, honey is bottled in its familiar liquid form. However, honey is sold in other forms, and can be subjected to a variety of processing methods.

==Preservation==

Because of its unique composition and chemical properties, honey is suitable for long-term storage, and is easily assimilated even after long preservation. Honey, and objects immersed in honey, have been preserved for decades and even centuries."The History of the Origin and Development of Museums". Dr. M. A. Hagen. The American naturalist, Volume 10. 1876.1894. The Mummy: A Handbook of Egyptian Funerary Archaeology. 2nd ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. (Reprinted New York: Dover Publications, 1989) The key to preservation is limiting access to humidity. In its cured state, honey has a sufficiently high sugar content to inhibit fermentation. If exposed to moist air, its hydrophilic properties will pull moisture into the honey, eventually diluting it to the point that fermentation can begin.
Regardless of preservation, honey may crystallize over time. The crystals can be dissolved by heating the honey.What to Do About Crystallized Honey. Heavenly Homemakers. Retrieved on 2013-08-02.Decrystallizing Honey. Lynnskitchenadventures.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-02.

==Distinguishing honey==

===Honey grading===

In the US, honey grading is performed voluntarily (USDA does offer inspection and grading "as on-line (in-plant) or lot inspection...upon application, on a fee-for-service basis.") based upon USDA standards. Honey is graded based upon a number of factors, including water content, flavor and aroma, absence of defects and clarity. Honey is also classified by color though it is not a factor in the grading scale.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELDEV3011895|title=United States Standards for Grades of Extracted Honey|publisher=USDA|accessdate=11 May 2010[/tpl]
The honey grade scale is:
Other countries may have differing standards on the grading of honey. India, for example, certifies honey grades based on additional factors, such as the Fiehe's test, and other empirical measurements.NOTIFICATION, MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE (Department of Agriculture and Co-operation) New Delhi, 24 December 2008

===Indicators of quality===

High-quality honey can be distinguished by fragrance, taste, and consistency. Ripe, freshly collected, high-quality honey at [tpl]convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl] should flow from a knife in a straight stream, without breaking into separate drops.Bogdanov, Stefan (2008) [tpl]Wayback|date=20090305184128 |url=http://www.bee-hexagon.net/files/file/fileE/Honey/Honey%20ProductionCorr.pdf |title="Honey production"[/tpl]. Bee Product Science After falling down, the honey should form a bead. The honey, when poured, should form small, temporary layers that disappear fairly quickly, indicating high viscosity. If not, it indicates excessive water content (over 20%)
of the product. Honey with excessive water content is not suitable for long-term preservation.[tpl]cite journal|author=Allan, Matthew |url=http://www.beedata.com/data2/basic_honey_processing.htm |title=Basic Honey Processing|journal= Beekeeping in a Nutshell |volume=5[/tpl]
In jars, fresh honey should appear as a pure, consistent fluid, and should not set in layers. Within a few weeks to a few months of extraction, many varieties of honey crystallize into a cream-colored solid. Some varieties of honey, including tupelo, acacia, and sage, crystallize less regularly. Honey may be heated during bottling at temperatures of [tpl]convert|40|–|49|C|F[/tpl] to delay or inhibit crystallization. Overheating is indicated by change in enzyme levels, for instance, diastase activity, which can be determined with the Schade or the Phadebas methods. A fluffy film on the surface of the honey (like a white foam), or marble-colored or white-spotted crystallization on a containers sides, is formed by air bubbles trapped during the bottling process.
A 2008 Italian study determined nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used to distinguish between different honey types, and can be used to pinpoint the area where it was produced. Researchers were able to identify differences in acacia and polyfloral honeys by the differing proportions of fructose and sucrose, as well as differing levels of aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. This ability allows greater ease of selecting compatible stocks.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1021/cen-v086n035.p043|journal=Chemical & Engineering News|year=2008|volume=86|title=Keeping Tabs on Honey|page=43|issue=35[/tpl]

==In medicine==

Historically, honey has been used by humans both orally and topically to treat various ailments including gastric disturbances, ulcers, wounds, and burns. However, it is only recently that the mechanisms underlying the antiseptic and antibacterial properties of honey have come to be understood. Much scientific research has been performed, with emphasis of late on fighting infections in wounds.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.drgrotte.com/honey-medicine.shtml|title=Honey as a Dressing for Wounds, Burns, and Ulcers: A Brief Review of Clinical Reports and Experimental Studies|journal=Primary Intention |volume= 6|issue= 4|date= December 1998|author=Grotte, L.B.

In Ayurveda, a 4000-year-old treatise on medicine originating from India, honey is considered to positively affect all three primitive material imbalances of the body. Charaka and Sushruta applied honey to dressings for sores. "Vaatalam guru sheetam cha raktapittakaphapaham| Sandhatru cchedanam ruksham kashayam madhuram madhu|| "It has sweetness with added astringent as end taste. It is heavy, dry and cold. Its effect on doshas (imbalances) is that it aggravates vata (air / moving forces), scrapes kapha (mucus / holding forces) and normalizes pitta (catabolic fire) and rakta'' (blood). It promotes the healing process."

===Osmotic effect===

Honey has an osmotic effect.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lusby|first=PE|coauthors=Coombes, A, Wilkinson, JM|title=Honey: a potent agent for wound healing?|journal=Journal of wound, ostomy, and continence nursing: official publication of the Wound, Ostomy and Continence Nurses Society / WOCN|date=November 2002|volume=29|issue=6|pages=295–300|pmid=12439453|doi=10.1067/mjw.2002.129073[/tpl] Honey is primarily a saturated mixture of two monosaccharides, with a low water activity; most of the water molecules are associated with the sugars and few remain available for microorganisms, so it is a poor environment for their growth.

===Hydrogen peroxide===

Hydrogen peroxide is formed in a slow-release manner by the enzyme glucose oxidase present in honey. It becomes active only when honey is diluted, requires oxygen to be available for the reaction (thus it may not work under wound dressings, in wound cavities or in the gut), is active only when the acidity of honey is neutralized by body fluids, can be destroyed by the protein-digesting enzymes present in wound fluids, and is destroyed when honey is exposed to heat and light. Honey chelates and deactivates free iron, which would otherwise catalyze the formation of oxygen free radicals from hydrogen peroxide, leading to inflammation. Also, the antioxidant constituents in honey help clean up oxygen free radicals present.Honey as a topical antibacterial agent for treatment of infected wounds. Worldwidewounds.com (2002-02-15). Retrieved on 6 February 2011.
When honey is used topically (as, for example, a wound dressing), hydrogen peroxide is produced by dilution of the honey with body fluids. As a result, hydrogen peroxide is released slowly and acts as an antibacterial.[tpl]Cite journal |journal=ScientificWorldJournal |date=5 April 2011 |volume=11|pages=766–87 |title=Honey for wound healing, ulcers, and burns; data supporting its use in clinical practice |author=Al-Waili N, Salom K, Al-Ghamdi AA |pmid=21479349 |doi=10.1100/tsw.2011.78[/tpl]

Topical honey has been used successfully in a comprehensive treatment of diabetic ulcers when the patient cannot use topical antibiotics.Eddy, Jennifer (2 May 2007) "UW study tests topical honey as a treatment for diabetic ulcers", UW Health's Eau Claire Family Medicine Clinic, University of Wisconsin–Madison

===Acidity===

The pH of honey is commonly between 3.2 and 4.5. This relatively acidic pH level prevents the growth of many bacteria.

===Methylglyoxal===

The nonperoxide antibiotic activity is due to methylglyoxal (MGO) and bee defensin-1.[tpl]cite doi|10.1096/fj.09-150789[/tpl] Most honeys contain very low levels of MGO, but manuka honey contains very high levels.

===Toxic honey===

Honey produced from flowers of oleanders, rhododendrons, mountain laurels, sheep laurel, and azaleas may cause honey intoxication. Symptoms include dizziness, weakness, excessive perspiration, nausea, and vomiting. Less commonly, low blood pressure, shock, heart rhythm irregularities, and convulsions may occur, with rare cases resulting in death. Honey intoxication is more likely when using "natural" unprocessed honey and honey from farmers who may have a small number of hives. Commercial processing, with pooling of honey from numerous sources, is thought to dilute any toxins.[tpl]Wayback |date=20100314133504 |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm071128.htm |title="Grayanotoxin" [/tpl] in the Foodborne Pathogenic Microorganisms and Natural Toxins Handbook, FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.

====New Zealand====

Toxic honey may also result when bees are proximate to tutu bushes (Coriaria arborea) and the vine hopper insect (Scolypopa australis). Both are found throughout New Zealand. Bees gather honeydew produced by the vine hopper insects feeding on the tutu plant. This introduces the poison tutin into honey.Tutu Bush and Toxic Honey. National Beekeepers Association, New Zealand Only a few areas in New Zealand (Coromandel Peninsula, Eastern Bay of Plenty and the Marlborough Sound) frequently produce toxic honey. Symptoms of tutin poisoning include vomiting, delirium, giddiness, increased excitability, stupor, coma, and violent convulsions. To reduce the risk of tutin poisoning, humans should not eat honey taken from feral hives in the risk areas of New Zealand. Since December 2001, New Zealand beekeepers have been required to reduce the risk of producing toxic honey by closely monitoring tutu, vine hopper, and foraging conditions within [tpl]convert|3|km|mi[/tpl] of their apiary.

==Honey-producing and consuming countries==

In 2012, China, Turkey, and Ukraine were the top producers of natural honey.FAO statistics. faostat.fao.org

Much of this (about one-third) comes from the Yucatán Peninsula. Honey production began there when the Apis mellifera and the A. mellifera ligustica were introduced there early in the 20th century. Most of Mexico's Yucatán producers are small, family operations who use original traditional techniques, moving hives to take advantage of the various tropical and subtropical flowers.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lavin Tierra|first=Mariely|date=February 2008|title=Yucatán y su miel|journal=México Desconocido|volume=372|pages=78–83|url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/index.php?p=nota&idNota=8259 [/tpl]
