</ref> and soon brought in a measure, the ''Monetary Confidence Bill'', designed to relieve the economic depression at the time. In spite of brilliant speeches in opposition to it made by [[Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke|Robert Lowe]] the bill was carried by 14 votes to seven; however, it was vetoed by the governor, [[George Gipps|Sir George Gipps]], and nothing more was heard of it.<ref name=dab/>  Windeyer supported free trade and worked to remove duties on the export of New South Wales tobacco to [[Tasmania|Van Diemen's Land]] and wheat to the United Kingdom, but supported an import duty of 1 [[shilling]] a bushel on foreign wheat on the basis that it would be a revenue not a protective duty.<ref name=adb/>
In October 1844 Windeyer moved an amendment to a Bill proposing to bring in Lord Stanley's system of national education, to the effect that primary education should be established for the poor 'gratuitously if necessary' and to allow government aid for denominational schools in some circumstances. In 1845 Windeyer, though almost overwhelmed with work, took up the cause of the already fast-dwindling aborigines and obtained a select committee to inquire into the question. He was also in the forefront of the struggle with Gipps concerning generally the powers of the council and the governor on the land question, and in 1846 moved and carried an address to the governor acquainting him that the council could not entertain a Bill he had originated.  Windeyer promoted a Libel Act passed 1847, that required that publication of libel could only be justified if it was both true and in the public interest.

==Late life and legacy==

Windeyer had become financially involved in the long-continued depression and, although he had made a large income at the bar, was obliged to assign his estate. He died on 2 December 1847 while on a visit to friends at Launceston, Tasmania, the result of anxiety and overwork and an internal disease.
Windeyer had a great reputation at the bar as an advocate of much power and ability, and during his short career in parliament showed himself to be a strong and conscientious man. He was a great advocate for representative government and when he died William Wentworth declared he "had lost his right hand man". His early death robbed Australia of a man who might have done his country much service, and reached almost any position in it.
