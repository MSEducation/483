Halou, pronounced huh-loo, was a band from San Francisco, California. Their music could be described as dream pop with female vocals; they are sometimes labeled trip hop, but the band rejects that label.[tpl]cite web|date= March 28, 2007|url=http://halouband.blogspot.com/2007/03/lapse.html|title=Lapse|publisher=halouband.blogspot.com|accessdate=2008-09-10[/tpl]

==History==

Ryan and Rebecca met in 1992, in Ryan's father's independent music store in Santa Cruz. Three years later, they moved to San Francisco. After a band they were in, "anymore" dissolved, there they became Halou, releasing their debut album, We Only Love You in 1998, on a small independent label called Bedazzled. We Only Love You was followed by a compilation of non-album tracks: Sans Soucie in 1999. Their second album, Wiser, was released by Nettwerk in 2001, and their more recent, Wholeness & Separation and Halou, were both released by Vertebrae in 2006 and 2008 respectively.
Halou's first album was broadcast on influential independent radio stations in Seattle and Los Angeles.[tpl]cite web|date= May 20, 2007|url=http://halou.com/about|title=Halou Bio|publisher=halou.com|accessdate=2008-09-08[/tpl] In recent years, the band has received coverage from notable news sources,[tpl]cite web|date= Apr 7, 2008|url=http://www.thebaybridged.com/2008/04/07/halou-new-ep-residency-at-cafe-du-nord/|title=Halou: New EP, Residency at Cafe du Nord|publisher=thebaybridged.com|accessdate=2008-09-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|date= Aug 14, 2006|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14272290|title=Quiet songs created to play loud|publisher=msnbc.msn.com|accessdate=2008-09-10[/tpl] and they have been recognized for their production talents:
