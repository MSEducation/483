[tpl]legend|#ced362|Fossil evidence[/tpl]]]
It seems that the Kakapo – like many of New Zealand's bird species – has evolved to occupy an ecological niche normally filled by various species of mammal (the only non-marine mammals native to New Zealand are three species of small bats). Before the arrival of humans, the Kakapo was distributed throughout the three main islands of New Zealand. It lived in a variety of habitats, including tussocklands, scrublands and coastal areas. It also inhabited forests, including those dominated by podocarps (rimu, matai, kahikatea, totara), beeches, tawa, and rata. In Fiordland, areas of avalanche and slip debris with regenerating and heavily fruiting vegetation – such as five finger, wineberry, bush lawyer, tutu, hebes, and coprosmas – became known as "Kakapo gardens".[tpl]cite journal|author = P.

The Kakapo is primarily nocturnal; it roosts under cover in trees or on the ground during the day and moves around its territories at night.
Though the Kakapo cannot fly, it is an excellent climber, ascending to the crowns of the tallest trees. It can also "parachute" – descending by leaping and spreading its wings. In this way it may travel a few metres (yards) at an angle of less than 45 degrees.
Having lost the ability to fly, it has developed strong legs. Movement is often by way of a rapid "jog-like" gait by which it can move many kilometres.

The Kakapo was a very successful species in pre-human New Zealand, and one of the reasons for this was their set of adaptations to effectively avoid predation from native birds of prey, which were their only predators in the past. However, these same behaviours have been of no use to them when faced with the mammalian predators which were introduced to New Zealand after human settlement, because these hunt in different ways. As hunters, birds behave very differently from mammals, relying on their powerful vision to find prey, and thus they usually (with the exception of owls) hunt by day. Apart from the two surviving New Zealand raptors, the New Zealand Falcon and Swamp Harrier, there were two other birds of prey in pre-human New Zealand: Haast's Eagle and Eyles' Harrier. All four species soared overhead searching for prey in daylight, and to avoid these avian predators, the Kakapo's ancestors adopted camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal. In addition, when the Kakapo feels threatened, it freezes, so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the forest vegetation which their plumage resembles. It was not entirely safe at night, when the Laughing Owl was active, and it is apparent from their nest deposits on Canterbury limestone cliffs that the Kakapo was among their prey.[tpl]Cite book |last1=Worthy |first1=T.H. |last2=Holdaway |first2=R.N. |title=The Lost world of the Moa: Prehistoric life in New Zealand |publisher=Canterbury University Press |location=Christchurch |year=2002 |page=718[/tpl]
Mammalian predators, in contrast to birds, rely on their sense of smell and hearing to find prey and often hunt by night. The Kakapo's adaptations to avoid avian predation have thus been useless against its new enemies – this is one of the reasons for its massive decline since the introduction of dogs, cats and mustelids – see Conservation: Human impact. A typical way for humans to hunt down the Kakapo is by releasing trained dogs.[tpl]Cite book|title=The habits of flightless birds of New Zealand: with notes on other flightless New Zealand birds| author=R.

===Diet===

The beak of the Kakapo is adapted for grinding food finely. For this reason, the Kakapo has a very small gizzard compared to other birds of their size. It is generally herbivorous, eating native plants, seeds, fruits, pollen and even the sapwood of trees. A study in 1984 identified 25 plant species as Kakapo food. It is particularly fond of the fruit of the rimu tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. The Kakapo has a distinctive habit of grabbing a leaf or frond with a foot and stripping the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak, leaving a ball of indigestible fiber. These little clumps of plant fibres are a distinctive sign of the presence of the bird.[tpl]cite journal|author=Gray, R.S. |year=1977| title=The kakapo (Strigops habroptilus, Gray 1847), its food, feeding and habitat in Fiordland and Maud Island| version=MSc thesis| publisher=Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Atkinson, I.

V.| year=2006 |title=Habitat and diet of kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) in the Esperance Valley, Fiordland, New Zealand| journal=Notornis| volume=53| issue=1| pages=37–54[/tpl] The Kakapo is believed to employ bacteria in the foregut to ferment and help digest plant matter.
Kakapo diet changes according to the season. The plants eaten most frequently during the year include some species of Lycopodium ramulosum, Lycopodium fastigium, Schizaea fistulosa, Blechnum minus, Blechnum procerum, Cyathodes juniperina, Dracophyllum longifolium, Olearia colensoi and Thelymitra venosa. Individual plants of the same species are often treated differently. The Kakapo leaves conspicuous evidence of their feeding activities, from 10×10 m (30×30 ft) to 50×100 m (160×300 ft) feeding ground areas. Manuka and yellow silver pine scrubs are obvious signs of its centre of feeding activities.

===Reproduction===

The Kakapo is the only species of flightless parrot in the world,[tpl]cite journal|author=Merton, D.V.; Morris, R.D.; Atkinson, I.A.E.| title=Lek behaviour in a parrot: the Kakapo Strigops habroptilus of New Zealand| journal=Ibis| volume=126| pages=277–283| year=1984| doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1984.tb00250.x|issue=3[/tpl] and the only flightless bird that has a lek breeding system."Collins Field Guide to New Zealand Wildlife", Terrence Lindsey and Rod Morris, Harper Collins Publishers ( New Zealand) limited, 2000 Males loosely gather in an arena and compete with each other to attract females. Females listen to the males as they display, or "lek".Merton, D.V. (1976). Conservation of the kakapo: a progress report. In Proc. Science in Nat. Parks. . National Parks Authority, Wellington, N.Z. National Parks Series No. 6: 139–148. They choose a mate based on the quality of his display; they are not pursued by the males in any overt way. No pair bond is formed; males and females meet only to mate.
During the courting season, males leave their home ranges for hilltops and ridges where they establish their own mating courts. These leks can be up to [tpl]convert|7|km|mi|0[/tpl] from a Kakapo's usual territory and are an average of 50 metres (160 ft) apart within the lek arena. Males remain in the region of their court throughout the courting season. At the start of the breeding season, males will fight to try to secure the best courts. They confront each other with raised feathers, spread wings, open beaks, raised claws and loud screeching and growling. Fighting may leave birds with injuries or even kill them.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0959270900001933|last=Clout|first=M.N.|author2= Merton, D.V.|year=1998|title=Saving the Kakapo: the conservation of the world's most peculiar parrot|journal=Bird Conservation International|volume=8|pages=281–295|issue=3[/tpl]
Each court consists of one or more saucer-shaped depressions or "bowls" dug in the ground by the male, up to 10 centimetres (4 in) deep and long enough to fit the half-metre length of the bird. The Kakapo is one of only a handful of birds in the world which actually constructs its leks. Bowls are often created next to rock faces, banks, or tree trunks to help reflect sound - the bowls themselves function as amplifiers to enhance the projection of the males' booming mating calls. Each male's bowls are connected by a network of trails or tracks which may extend 50 metres (160 ft) along a ridge or 20 metres (60 ft) in diameter around a hilltop. Males meticulously clear their bowls and tracks of debris. One way researchers check whether bowls are visited at night is to place a few twigs in the bowl; if the male visits overnight, he will pick them up in his beak and toss them away.
To attract females, males make loud, low-frequency (below 100 Hz) booming calls from their bowls by inflating a thoracic sac.[tpl]cite journal|author=J.F. Cockrem| title=Reproductive biology and conservation of the endangered kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) in New Zealand| journal=Avian and Poultry Biology Reviews| pages=139–144| year=2002| volume=13| issue=3|doi=10.3184/147020602783698548[/tpl] They start with low grunts, which increase in volume as the sac inflates. After a sequence of about 20 loud booms, the male Kakapo emits a high frequency, metallic "ching" sound.[tpl]cite web| title = Meet the Kakapo: Breeding | url=http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/breeding/ |publisher=Kakapo Recovery Programme| accessdate = 3 September 2013 [/tpl] He stands for a short while before again lowering his head, inflating his chest and starting another sequence of booms. The booms can be heard at least one kilometre (0.6 mi) away on a still night; wind can carry the sound at least five kilometres (3 mi). Males boom for an average of eight hours a night; each male may produce thousands of booms in this time. This may continue every night for three or four months during which time the male may lose half his body weight. Each male moves around the bowls in his court so that the booms are sent out in different directions. These booms are also notorious for attracting predators, because of the long range at which they can be heard.
Females are attracted by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court of one of the males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. The duration of attempted copulation is between 2 to 14 minutes. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.
The female Kakapo lays 1-2 eggs (rarely 3) per breeding cycle, with long intervals between laying of first and second eggs.del Hoyo, J. Elliott, A. & Sargatal, J. (1997) Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 4: Sandgrouse to Cuckoos. Lynx Edicions. ISBN 84-87334-22-9. She nests on the ground under the cover of plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks. The female incubates the eggs faithfully, but is forced to leave them every night in search of food. Predators are known to eat the eggs and the embryos inside can also die of cold in the mother's absence. Kakapo eggs usually hatch within 30 days,[tpl]cite journal|title=Breeding biology of kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) on offshore island sanctuaries, 1990–2002| author= Daryl K. Eason, Graeme P. Elliott, Don V. Merton, Paul W. Jansen, Grant A. Harper, and Ron J. Moorhouse| journal=Notornis| volume=54| issue=1| year=2006| pages=27–36| url=http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_53_1_27.pdf[/tpl] bearing fluffy grey chicks that are quite helpless. After the eggs hatch, the female feeds the chicks for three months, and the chicks continue to remain with the female for some months after fledging. The young chicks are just as vulnerable to predators as the eggs, and young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults. Chicks leave the nest at approximately 10 to 12 weeks of age. As they gain greater independence, their mothers may feed the chicks sporadically for up to 6 months.
Because the Kakapo is long-lived, with an average life expectancy of 95 years and the maximum at about 120 years, it tends to have an adolescence before it starts breeding.[tpl]Cite book| title =Rare Birds Yearbook 2008| publisher =MagDig Media Lmtd| year =2007| location =England| page =151| isbn =978-0-9552607-3-5| author =editor, Erik Hirschfeld [/tpl] Males do not start to boom until about 5 years of age. It was thought that females reach sexual maturity at 9 years of age; but this idea was debunked in the 2008 breeding season when two 6-year-old females named Apirama and Rakiura laid eggs.Forest and Bird Magazine, Number 328, May 2008 (page 5) Generally females do not seek out males until they are between 9 and 11 years old. The Kakapo does not breed every year and has one of the lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. Rimu mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests such as those on Codfish Island, Kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently.[tpl]cite journal|title=Nutrient composition of the diet of parent-raised kakapo nestlings| author=Yvette Cottam, Don V. Merton, and Wouter Hendriks| pages=90–99| journal=Notornis| volume=53| issue=1| year=2006| url=http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_53_1_90.pdf[/tpl]
Another interesting aspect of the Kakapo's breeding system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 3%–40% more body weight than females[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]). Females produce offspring biased toward the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and toward the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female Kakapo will likely be able to produce eggs even when there are few resources, while a male Kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.[ref]

==Conservation==

Fossil records indicate that in pre-Polynesian times, the Kakapo was New Zealand's third most common bird[tpl]Cite book |title=Ghosts of Gondwana; The history of life in New Zealand |author=George Gibbs |publisher=Craig Potton Publishing |year=2007[/tpl] and it was widespread on all three main islands. However, the population of Kakapo in New Zealand has declined massively since human settlement of the country. Since 1891, conservation efforts have been made to prevent extinction. The most successful scheme has been the Kakapo Recovery Plan; this was implemented in 1989 and is still ongoing.

===Human impact===

The first factor in the decline of the Kakapo was the arrival of humans. Māori folklore suggests that the Kakapo was found throughout the country when the Polynesians first arrived in Aotearoa 700 years ago.[tpl]cite journal|title=Kakapo in Māori lore|author=Rob Tipa| journal=Notornis| volume=53| issue=1| year=2006[/tpl] Subfossil and midden deposits show that the bird was present throughout the North Island, South Island and Stewart Island/Rakiura before and during early Māori times.Barrie Heather and Hugh Robertson, illustrated by Derek Onley, The Field guide to the birds of New Zealand, Viking, revised edition, 2005 Māori hunted the Kakapo for food and for their skins and feathers, which were made into cloaks. They used the dried heads as ear ornaments. Due to its flightlessness, strong scent and habit of freezing when threatened, the Kakapo was easy prey for the Māori and their dogs. Its eggs and chicks were also preyed upon by the Polynesian Rat or kiore, which the Māori brought to New Zealand. Furthermore, the deliberate clearing of vegetation by Māori reduced the habitable range for Kakapo. Although the Kakapo was extinct in many parts of the islands by the time Europeans arrived,[tpl]cite journal|journal=Notornis| author=G. R. Williams| title=The Kakapo (Strigops habroptilus, Gray): a review and reappraisal of a near-extinct species| volume=7| issue=2| year=1956| url=http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_7_2.pdf| pages=29–56[/tpl] including the Tararua and Aorangi Ranges,[tpl]cite book |last=Best |first=Elsdon |authorlink=Elsdon Best |title=Forest Lore of the Maori |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BesFore.html |accessdate=11 May 2012 |series=Memoirs of the Polynesian Society. 18.

Beginning in the 1840s, European settlers cleared vast tracts of land for farming and grazing, further reducing Kakapo habitat. They brought more dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and stoats.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Nature| title=Conservation Biology: Science, Sex and the Kakapo| volume=419|issue=6904| author=W. J. Sutherland| pages=265–266| doi=10.1038/419265a|pmid=12239554| year=2002[/tpl] Europeans knew little of the Kakapo until George Gray of the British Museum described it from a skin in 1845. As the Māori had done, early European explorers and their dogs ate Kakapo. In the late 19th century, the Kakapo became well known as a scientific curiosity, and thousands were captured or killed for zoos, museums and collectors. Most captured specimens died within months. From at least the 1870s, collectors knew the Kakapo population was declining; their prime concern was to collect as many as possible before the bird became extinct.
In the 1880s, large numbers of mustelids (stoats, ferrets and weasels) were released in New Zealand to reduce rabbit numbers,[tpl]cite journal|author=Murphy, E and Dowding, J.| year=1995 |title=Ecology of the stoat in Nothofagus forest: home range, habitat use and diet at different stages of the beech mast cycle| journal=New Zealand Journal of Ecology| volume=19 |issue=2| pages=97–109| url=http://www.nzes.org.nz/nzje/free_issues/NZJEcol19_2_97.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] but they also preyed heavily on many native species including the Kakapo. Other browsing animals, such as introduced deer, competed with the Kakapo for food, and caused the extinction of some of its preferred plant species. The Kakapo was reportedly still present near the head of the Whanganui River as late as 1894, with one of the last records of a Kakapo in the North Island being a single bird caught in the Kaimanawa Ranges by Te Kepa Puawheawhe in 1895.

===Early protection efforts===

In 1891, the New Zealand government set aside Resolution Island in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed Richard Henry as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry was aware that native birds were declining, and began catching and moving Kakapo and kiwi from the mainland to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200 Kakapo to Resolution Island. By 1900, however, stoats had swum to Resolution Island and colonised it; they wiped out the nascent Kakapo population within 6 years.Hill, S.; Hill, J. 1987. Richard Henry of Resolution Island. Dunedin, John McIndoe.
In 1903, three Kakapo were moved from Resolution Island to the nature reserve of Little Barrier Island north-east of Auckland, but feral cats were present and the Kakapo were never seen again. In 1912, three Kakapo were moved to another reserve, Kapiti Island, north-west of Wellington. One of them survived until at least 1936, despite the presence of feral cats for part of the intervening period.
By the 1920s, the Kakapo was extinct in the North Island and its range and numbers in the South Island were declining. One of its last refuges was rugged Fiordland. There, during the 1930s, it was often seen or heard, and occasionally eaten, by hunters or roadworkers. By the 1940s, reports of Kakapo were becoming scarce.

===1950–1989 conservation efforts===

In the 1950s, the New Zealand Wildlife Service was established and began making regular expeditions to search for the Kakapo, mostly in Fiordland and what is now the Kahurangi National Park in the northwest of the South Island. Seven Fiordland expeditions between 1951 and 1956 found only a few recent signs. Finally, in 1958 a Kakapo was caught and released in the Milford Sound catchment area in Fiordland. Six more Kakapo were captured in 1961; one was released and the other five were transferred to the aviaries of the Mount Bruce Bird Reserve near Masterton in the North Island. Within months, four of the birds had died and the fifth died after about four years. In the next 12 years, regular expeditions found few signs of the Kakapo, indicating that numbers were continuing to decline. Only one bird was captured in 1967; it died the following year[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl].
By the early 1970s, it was uncertain whether the Kakapo was still an extant species. At the end of 1974, scientists located several more male Kakapo and made the first scientific observations of Kakapo booming. These observations led Don Merton to speculate for the first time that the Kakapo had a lek breeding system. From 1974 to 1976, 14 Kakapo were discovered but all appeared to be males. This raised the possibility that the species would become extinct, because there might be no surviving females. One male bird was captured in the Milford area in 1975, christened "Richard Henry", and transferred to Maud Island. All the birds the Wildlife Service discovered from 1951 to 1976 were in U-shaped glaciated valleys flanked by almost-vertical cliffs and surrounded by high mountains. Such extreme terrain had slowed colonisation by browsing mammals, leaving islands of virtually unmodified native vegetation. However, even here, stoats were present and by 1976 the Kakapo was gone from the valley floors and only a few males survived high on the most inaccessible parts of the cliffs.
Before 1977, no expedition had been to Stewart Island/Rakiura to search for the bird. In 1977, sightings of Kakapo were reported on Stewart Island. An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen Kakapo. The finding in an 8,000 ha area of fire-modified scrubland and forest raised hope that the population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200 birds.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1080/03014223.1995.9518039|author=Powlesland, R.G.; Roberts, A.; Lloyd, B.

Mustelids have never colonised Steward Island/Rakiura, but feral cats were present. During a survey, it was apparent that cats killed Kakapo with a predation rate of 56% per annum.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Karl |first1=B.J |last2=Best |first2=H.A. |title=Feral cats on Stewart Island: their foods and their effects on kakapo| journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology| volume=9| pages=287–294| year=1982 | doi=10.1080/03014223.1982.10423857[/tpl] At this rate, the birds could not survive on the island and therefore an intensive cat control was introduced in 1982, after which no cat-killed Kakapo were found. However, to ensure the survival of the remaining birds, scientists decided later that this population should be transferred to predator-free islands; this operation was carried out between 1982 and 1997.[tpl]cite journal|author=B.

===Kakapo recovery plan===

In 1989, a Kakapo Recovery Plan was developed and a Kakapo Recovery Group established to implement it.[tpl]Cite book|author=Powlesland, R.G.| year=1989 | title=Kakapo recovery plan 1989–1994| publisher=Department of Conservation| location=Wellington[/tpl] The New Zealand Department of Conservation replaced the Wildlife Service for this task. The first action of the plan was to relocate all the remaining Kakapo to suitable islands for them to breed. None of the New Zealand islands were ideal to establish Kakapo without rehabilitation by extensive revegetation and the eradication of introduced mammalian predators and competitors. Four islands were finally chosen: Maud, Hauturu/Little Barrier, Codfish and Mana. Sixty-five Kakapo (43 males, 22 females) were successfully transferred onto the four islands in five translocations. Some islands had to be rehabilitated several times when feral cats, stoats and weka kept appearing. Little Barrier Island was eventually viewed as unsuitable due to the rugged landscape, the thick forest and the continued presence of rats, and its birds were evacuated in 1998.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/little-barrier-island/|title=Little Barrier Island |publisher=Kakapo Recovery Programme|accessdate=2014-03-05[/tpl] Along with Mana Island, it was replaced with two new Kakapo sanctuaries, Chalky Island (Te Kakahu) and Anchor Island. The entire Kakapo population of Codfish Island was temporarily relocated in 1999 to Pearl Island in Port Pegasus while rats were being eliminated from Codfish.[tpl]cite journal | first = Joanna K. | last = Whitehead | title = Breeding success of adult female kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) on Codfish Island (Whenua Hou): correlations with foraging home ranges and habitat selection | year = 2007 | url = http://researcharchive.lincoln.ac.nz/dspace/bitstream/10182/640/3/Whitehead_MSc.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2009-04-12[/tpl] All Kakapo on Pearl and Chalky Islands were moved to Anchor Island in 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=57&Itemid=223|title=Updates: June to September 2005 |publisher=Kakapo Recovery Programme|accessdate=2009-04-12|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130616192606/http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=57&Itemid=223|archivedate=2013-06-16[/tpl]
A key part of the Recovery Plan is the supplementary feeding of females. The Kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase Kakapo breeding frequency.[tpl]cite journal| author=Elliott, G.P.; Merton, D.V.; Jansen, P.W.| year=2001| title=Intensive management of a critically endangered species: the kakapo| journal=Biological Conservation| volume=99| pages=121–133| issue=1| doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00191-9[/tpl] In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 for the first time since 1982, although nesting success was low.[tpl]cite journal|author=R.

Supplementary feeding not only increases Kakapo breeding frequency, but also affects the sex ratio of Kakapo offspring, as maternal conditions influence this ratio.[tpl]cite journal|author=Clout, M.N.; Elliott, G.P.; Robertson, B.C. | year=2002 |title=Effects of supplementary feeding on the offspring sex ratio of kakapo: a dilemma for the conservation of a polygynous parrot | journal=Biological Conservation| volume=107| pages=13–18| issue=1| doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(01)00267-1[/tpl] (See section "Reproduction" for more information on this topic.) This finding was subsequently used to increase the number of female chicks by deliberately manipulating maternal condition.[tpl]cite journal|author=Robertson, B.C.; Elliott, G.P.; Eason, D.K.; Clout, M.N.; Gemmell, N.J. |year=2006 |title=Sex allocation theory aids species conservation |journal=Biology Letters| url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/link.asp?id=p5v74428x53j0883|pmid=17148369| pages=229–231| volume=2|pmc=1618899| issue=2 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0430[/tpl] During the winter of 1981, only females below 1.5 kg weight were given supplementary feeding to avoid raising their body condition, and the sex ratio results in 1982 were close to parity, eliminating the male-biased sex ratios in the unrestricted feeding.
Though breeding can be improved by supplementary feeding, the survival of young Kakapo is hampered by the presence of Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using traps and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected. A small video camera and infra-red light source watch the nest continuously, which will remotely scare approaching rats by small bang and flash lights. To increase the success rate of nesting, a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones.
To monitor the Kakapo population continuously, each bird is equipped with a radio transmitter. Every known Kakapo, barring some young chicks, has been given a name by Kakapo Recovery Programme officials. It is an affectionate way for conservation staff to refer to individual birds, and a stark reminder of how few remain. Artificial incubation of eggs and hand-raising of chicks have often been used to improve the condition of the eggs and chicks.[tpl]cite journal|title=Hand-rearing kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), 1997–2005| author=Daryl K.

In 2006, the Kakapo Recovery Programme presented a new management plan that would run from 2006 to 2016.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/a-plan-for-the-future/|title=A Plan for the Future 2006–2016 |publisher=Kakapo Recovery Programme|accessdate=2014-03-05[/tpl] The key goals of this plan are to increase the female population to at least 60 by 2016, increase genetic diversity, maintain or restore a sufficiently large habitat to accommodate the expected increase in the Kakapo population, and maintain public awareness and support.
The Kakapo Recovery Plan has been a successful programme, with the numbers of Kakapo increasing steadily. Adult survival rate and productivity have both improved significantly since the programme's inception. However, the main goal is to establish at least one viable, self-sustaining, unmanaged population of Kakapo as a functional component of the ecosystem in a protected habitat.[tpl]Cite book|author=Cresswell, M.| year=1996 |title=Kakapo recovery plan 1996–2005.

Ultimately, the Kakapo Recovery Plan vision for the species is to restore the mauri (life-force) of the kakapo by breeding 150 adult females.
During the 2008–2009 summer breeding season, the total population of Kakapo rose to over 100 for the first time since monitoring began,[tpl]cite news |author=NZPA |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/2251118/Kakapo-population-over-100-mark|title=Kakapo population over 100 mark |work=stuff.co.nz |date=11 March 2009[/tpl] reaching [tpl]Number of Living Kakapo[/tpl] by February 2012.

In 2012, seven Kakapo were transferred to Little Barrier Island, in an attempt to establish a successful breeding program. Kakapo were last on the island in 1999.
In March 2014, with the Kakapo population having increased to 126, the bird's recovery was used by Melbourne artist, Sayraphim Lothian as a metaphor for the recovery of Christchurch parallelling the, "indomitable spirit of these two communities and their determination to rebuild".[tpl]cite web|title=Kakapo sculptures hidden in Christchurch|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/art-and-stage/9834934/Find-a-kakapo-keep-the-love|last=Harvie|first=Will|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=17 March 2014|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Journey – A new work by Sayraphim Lothian with support from Gap Filler|url = http://www.gapfiller.org.nz/journey-a-new-work-by-sayraphim-lothian-with-support-from-gap-filler/|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl]

==In Māori culture==

The Kakapo is associated with a rich tradition of Māori folklore and beliefs. The bird's irregular breeding cycle was understood to be associated with heavy fruiting or "masting" events of particular plant species such as the Rimu which led Māori to credit the bird with the ability to foretell the future.[tpl]Cite book |author=Murdoch Riley |title=Maori Bird Lore; An introduction |publisher=Viking Sevenseas NZ LTD |year=2001[/tpl] Used to substantiate this claim were reported observations of these birds dropping the berries of the Hinau and Tawa trees (when they were in season) into secluded pools of water to preserve them as a food supply for the summer ahead; in legend this became the origin of the Māori practice of immersing food in water for the same purpose.

===Use for food and clothing===

The meat of Kakapo made good eating and was considered by Māori to be a delicacy and it was hunted for food when it was still widespread.[tpl]Cite book |authors=Rod Morris, Hal Smith |title=Wild South: Saving New Zealands endangered birds |publisher=Random House |location=New Zealand |year=1995[/tpl] One source states that its flesh "resembles lamb in taste and texture", although European settlers have described the bird as having a "strong and slightly stringent sic flavour."
In breeding years, the loud booming calls of the males at their mating arenas made it easy for Māori hunting parties to track the Kakapo down, and it was also hunted while feeding or when dustbathing in dry weather. The bird was caught, generally at night, using snares, pitfall traps, or by groups of domesticated Polynesian dogs which accompanied hunting parties – sometimes they would use fire sticks of various sorts to dazzle a bird in the darkness, stopping it in their tracks and making the capture easier. Cooking was done in a hāngi or in gourds of boiling oil. The flesh of the bird could be preserved in its own fat and stored in containers for later consumption – hunters of the Ngāi Tahu tribe would pack the flesh in baskets made from the inner bark of Totara tree or in containers constructed from kelp.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/then/iwi.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070416165111/http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/then/iwi.html |archivedate=16 April 2007 |title=Kakapo then and now; An Iwi Perspective |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=16 April 2007 |accessdate=2012-01-15[/tpl] Bundles of Kakapo tail feathers were attached to the sides of these containers to provide decoration and a way to identify their contents.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_53_1_191.pdf  |format=PDF |first=Rob |last=Tipa |title=Short note: Kakapo in Māori Lore |journal=Notornis |volume=53 |pages=193–194 |year=2006 |issue=1[/tpl] Also taken by the Māori were the bird's eggs, which are described as whitish "but not pure white", and about the same size as a kererū egg.
As well as eating the meat of the Kakapo, Māori would use Kakapo skins with the feathers still attached or individually weave in Kakapo feathers with flax fibre to create cloaks and capes.[tpl]cite web| title = Kakapo feather cloak | work = Search the collection database | publisher = British Museum | url = http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=497615&partid=1&IdNum=Oc1936,0607.1&orig=/research/search_the_collection_database/museum_no__provenance_search.aspx | accessdate = 1 August 2010[/tpl] Each one required up to 11,000 feathers to make. Not only were these garments very beautiful, they also kept the wearer very warm.[tpl]Cite book |author=Andrew Crowe |title=Which New Zealand Bird? |publisher=Penguin |year=2001[/tpl] They were highly valued, and the few still in existence today are considered taonga (treasures) — indeed, the old Māori adage "You have a Kākāpō cape and you still complain of the cold" was used to describe someone who is never satisfied. Kakapo feathers were also used to decorate the heads of taiaha, but were removed before use in combat.
Despite this, the Kakapo was also regarded as an affectionate pet by the Māori. This was corroborated by European settlers in New Zealand in the 19th century, among them George Edward Grey, who once wrote in a letter to an associate that his pet Kakapo's behaviour towards him and his friends was "more like that of a dog than a bird".

===In the media===

The conservation of the Kakapo has made the species well known. Many books and documentaries detailing the plight of the Kakapo have been produced in recent years, one of the earliest being Two in the Bush, made by Gerald Durrell for the BBC in 1962.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.durrellwildlife.org/index.cfm?a=51 | title = Gerald durrell's career | publisher = durrellwildlife.org | accessdate = 8 August 2007 [/tpl] A feature length documentary, The Unnatural History of the Kakapo[tpl]cite web|url=http://elwin.co.nz/prjkakapo.html |title=The Unnatural History of the Kakapo |publisher=Elwin.co.nz |accessdate=2012-01-15[/tpl] won two major awards at the Reel Earth Environmental Film Festival. Two of the most significant documentaries, both made by NHNZ, are Kakapo – Night Parrot (1982) and To Save the Kakapo (1997). The BBC's Natural History Unit also featured the Kakapo, including a sequence with Sir David Attenborough in The Life of Birds. It was also one of the endangered animals that Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine set out to find for the radio series and book Last Chance to See. An updated version of the series has been produced for BBC TV, in which Stephen Fry and Carwardine revisit the animals to see how they are getting on almost 20 years later, and in January 2009, they spent time filming the Kakapo on Codfish Island.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/38869/fry-making-kakapo-doco|title=Fry making kakapo doco|last=McNeilly |first=Hamish |date=10 January 2009|publisher=Otago Daily Times|accessdate=2009-01-09[/tpl] Footage of a kakapo named Sirocco attempting to mate with Carwardine's head was viewed by millions worldwide, leading to Sirocco becoming "spokesbird" for New Zealand wildlife conservation in 2010, as part of the International Year of Biodiversity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tourismnewzealand.com/news-and-features/latest-news/2010/01/prime-minister-appoints-'spokesbird'-for-conservation/ |title=Prime Minister Appoints 'Spokesbird' for Conservation |publisher=Tourism New Zealand |date=29 January 2010 |accessdate=2012-01-15[/tpl] The kakapo was featured in the documentary series South Pacific (known as Wild Pacific in US) episode Strange Islands, originally aired on 13 June 2009.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1486170| title= Wild Pacific – Strange Evolutions| accessdate=2011-03-29[/tpl] And is briefly mentioned near the end of 1984's The Living Planet episode 10, Worlds Apart.[tpl]cite web|title=The Living Planet 10|url=http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-living-planet/[/tpl]
