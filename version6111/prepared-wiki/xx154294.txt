CATEGORIES: Plant pathogens and diseases, Fomitopsidaceae

Fomitopsis palustris is a species of fungus in the family Fomitopsidaceae. It causes brown rot, a disease of wood that results from the enzymatic breakdown of the wood component cellulose, but not lignin. Several enzymes involved in the wood decay process have been biochemically characterized.

F. palustris is known to possess three different cellulase enzymes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Yoon JJ, Kim YK |title=Degradation of crystalline cellulose by the brown-rot basidiomycete Fomitopsis palustris |journal=J.

An endoglucanase, named EG-II, has been purified and characterized from this species in 2008; it is believed to assist in the wood rot process by loosening the polysaccharide network in cell walls by disentangling hemicelluloses associated with cellulose.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shimokawa T, Shibuya H, Nojiri M, Yoshida S, Ishihara M |title=Purification, molecular cloning, and enzymatic properties of a family 12 endoglucanase (EG-II) from Fomitopsis palustris: role of EG-II in larch holocellulose hydrolysis |journal=Appl.
