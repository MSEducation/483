Magnetis is a WiiWare and PC video game developed by Yullaby, and was released in 2009. The game is notably Yullaby's first independent project, after previously being commissioned to develop video games by third parties.

==Gameplay==

Magnetis is set in a fantasy industrial environment where various magnets and metallic blocks will stack up.  The combination of the magnets, gathered according to their polarity, aligned or not with metallic blocks, allow the player to make a complete line of elements to disappear. It is also possible to get rid of several lines in a row, such as combos.
Magnetis was developed for the WiiWare and Steam platforms using the GameStart engine.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] http://www.gamestart3d.com
