CATEGORIES: Areas of Dundee

Pitkerro is an area in the eastern part of Dundee, Scotland, immediately west of Douglas and south of Fintry and Whitfield. Areas of Pitkerro include Kingsway East, Linlathen, Mid Craigie, Milton of Craigie and Drumgieth. Pitkerro is home to a large gas reserve tank.
Pitkerro once had four schools, three primary and one secondary. The oldest, St Saviour's RC High School, closed in June 2008 due to decreasing pupil numbers and merged with Lawside Academy at the start of the 2008/9 school year to form St. Paul's Academy. Mosgiel Primary School and Mid Craigie Primary School merged at the start of the 2009/10 year to form Rowantree Primary School, a purpose-built school constructed in 2008 on the site behind Pitkerro's other school, St. Vincent's Primary.
Together, Pitkerro, Kirkton and Hilltown contain 31% of Dundee's enumeration districts which fall within the worst 10% of deprived districts in Scotland.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
