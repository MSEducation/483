[[Dilatometer]]

CATEGORIES: Measuring instruments

A  dilatometer  is a scientific instrument that measures volume changes caused by a physical or chemical process.  A familiar application of a dilatometer is the mercury-in-glass thermometer, in which the change in volume of the liquid column is read from a graduated scale. Because mercury has a fairly constant rate of expansion over normal temperature ranges, the volume changes are directly related to temperature.

==Applications==

Dilatometers have been used in the fabrication of metallic alloys, compressed and sintered refractory compounds, glasses, ceramic products, composite materials, and plastics.Hans Lehmann, refuge Gatzke  Dilatometrie and differential thermal analysis for the evaluation of processes ? ? , 1956. 
Dilatometry is also used to monitor the progress of chemical reactions, particularly those displaying a substantial molar volume change (e.g., polymerisation).  A specific example is the rate of phase changes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kastle, J. H. | coauthors = Kelley, W.

Another common application of a dilatometer is the measurement of thermal expansion. The thermal expansivity is defined as:
and is an important engineering parameter.

==Types==

There are a number of dilatometer types:
Expert System Solutions S.r.l., Modena (Italy).[/ref] As the system allows to heat up the material and measures its longitudinal/vertical movements without any contact between instrument and specimen, it is possible to analyse the most ductile materials, such as the polymers, as well as the most fragile, such as the incoherent ceramic powders for sintering process.   
For simpler measurements in a temperature range from 0 to 100 °C, where water is heated up and flow or over the sample. If linear coefficients of expansion of a metal is to be measured, hot water will running through a pipe made from the metal. The pipe warms up to the temperature of the water and the relative expansion can be determined as a function of the water temperature.
For the measurement of the volumetric expansion of liquids one takes a large glass container filled with water. In an expansion tank (glass container with an accurate volume scale) with the sample liquid. If one heats the water up, the sample liquid expands and the volume changes is read. However the expansion of the sample container must also be taken into consideration.
The expansion and retraction coefficient of gases cannot be measured using dilatometer, since the pressure plays a role here. For such measurements a gas thermometer is more suitable.
Dilatometers often include a mechanism for controlling temperature. This may be a furnace for measurements at elevated temperatures (temperatures to 2000 °C), or a cryostat for measurements at temperatures below room temperature. Metallurgical applications often involve sophisticated temperature controls capable of applying precise temperature-time profiles for heating and quenching the sample.http://www.theta-us.com/quench/QuenchInst.html
