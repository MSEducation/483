He was promoted to single-A Vero Beach in 1989, and was a member of the 1990 Florida State League champion squad. In 1991, Ebel was promoted to Triple-A Albuquerque where he served as a utility player. During the 1989, 1990 and 1991 off seasons, Ebel also played in the Australian Baseball League with the Dodgers Australian affiliate the Adelaide Giants.
In 1991 he served as a player–coach for the single-A Bakersfield Dodgers, a position he held until 1994.  He served as a player–coach for the high-A San Bernardino Spirit in 1995, before coaching full-time with double-A San Antonio in 1996. He began his managing career in 1997 with San Bernardino, taking the reins of the club late in the season. He managed the rookie-level Great Falls Dodgers in 1998, compiling a 40–35 record. In 1999, he managed the single-A Yakima Bears. He returned to San Bernardino in 2000, and led the club to the California League title. He moved to single-A Wilmington the following year, where he posted a 75–63 record. In 2002, he led the double-A Jacksonville Suns to the Southern League East Division Championship and served as the club's manager until 2004.
After serving for seventeen years in the Dodgers organization in some capacity, Ebel joined the Los Angeles Angels organization in 2005 as the coach of triple-A Salt Lake, which posted a 79–65 record under his guidance. After long-time bench coach Joe Maddon left the Angels organization to manage the Tampa Bay Rays, Ebel was appointed to the major league team's coaching staff as Mike Scioscia's third base coach. As the third base coach, Ebel is known to lean to a more aggressive style of baserunning.
On October 8, 2013, it was announced that Ebel would succeed Rob Picciolo, who was fired by the Angels, as the bench coach in 2014.http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/ana/angels-gm-jerry-dipoto-and-manager-mike-scioscia-will-return-in-2014?ymd=20131008&content_id=62721196
