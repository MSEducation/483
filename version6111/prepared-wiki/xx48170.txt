[[Meiosis (figure of speech)]]

CATEGORIES: Rhetorical techniques

In rhetoric, meiosis is a euphemistic figure of speech that intentionally understates something or implies that it is lesser in significance or size than it really is. Meiosis is the opposite of auxesis, and also sometimes used as a synonym for litotes.Encarta World English Dictionary (1999)The Times English Dictionary (2000)OED 1st edition The term is derived from the Greek μειόω (“to make smaller”, "to diminish").

==Origins of meiosis in science==

The scientific term of meiosis was first developed by J.B. Farmer and J.E. Moore in 1905 to describe gametic cell division—concepts researched extensively by German biologist Theodor Boveri.[tpl]cite book|last=Bynum|first=W.

However, it wasn't until a few years later that maiosis was renamed “meiosis” to better embody the Greek definition, “to reduce” or “diminish”.[tpl]cite web|title=Meiosis|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/meiosis|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=22 October 2013[/tpl]

==Usage and history==

Meiosis typically works to diminish the importance of something or someone in order to simultaneously heighten something else in its place. Such a comparative approach is necessary for the effectiveness of the device. One of the earliest recorded usages of this technique dates back to the seventh book of the New Testament where Paul belittles himself in order to emphasize the power of God:
"For I am the least of all the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect…" (1 Corinthians 15:9-10).
Rhetorical devices such as meiosis, though not formally established until much later,[tpl]fact|date=November 2013[/tpl] played an important role in shaping the ideas of texts as old as the Bible.
