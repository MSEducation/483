J. R. Russell (born December 5, 1981) is a wide receiver who is currently a free agent.  He was drafted by the Bucs in the 7th round of the 2005 NFL Draft out of the University of Louisville.  He was re-signed to the Bucs' practice squad on November 30, 2005, and was competing for a spot on the opening day roster, along with former Arizona Cardinals Pro Bowler David Boston and rookie Maurice Stovall from Notre Dame. Russell was released on August 29, 2006.Buccaneers.com | News
Russell is no stranger to Tampa. Just 9 miles north of the Bucs' home field, Raymond James Stadium, on the same street, stands Russell's high school alma mater, Gaither High School. Nicknamed the Cowboys, Russell saw great success come not only on the football field, but on the court as well. It wasn't until weeks before departing for Louisville that he decided to pursue a career on football instead of basketball. 
Russell's younger brother, Antonio, a graduate of 2004, also attended Gaither and was a star point guard for the Cowboys, leading them to the regional championship game in 2004 in a losing effort to Lake Region High School of Polk County. He played college basketball for the Western Carolina Catamounts http://www.catamountsports.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/russell_antonio00.html
