The U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships is a professional tennis tournament that is currently held at the Racquet Club of Memphis in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. The event is played on indoor hard courts and usually takes place in February. For much of its more than 100 year history it was a combined men's and women's tournament but as of 2014 only a men's tournament is organized that is part of the ATP Tour. The event was previously known under various sponsored names including the Regions Morgan Keegan Championships, the Kroger St. Jude Championship, and the Volvo Championships.

The women's tournament started in 1907 when they joined the men at the Seventh Regiment Armory location to form a combined tournament. Elisabeth Moore won the first title. The Women's doubles event was added in 1908. The women played periods in New York (1907–1920, 1934–1940, 1947–1953) and Longwood Courts at Chestnut Hill (1921–1933, 1941–1946, 1954–1966). From 1967 to 1972 the women played in Winchester. In 2002 the women rejoined the men in Memphis and in 2012 Memphis announced that it was renaming (restoring) the tournament to U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships.[tpl]cite web|title=The U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships Return to Memphis|url=http://www.memphistennis.com/news/story-231|publisher=Racquet Club of Memphis[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Memphis' pro tennis events getting new name, in 'active discussions' with sponsors|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2012/nov/21/memphis-pro-tennis-events-getting-new-name-in/|publisher=The Commercial Appeal|author=Kyle Veazey|date=November 21, 2012[/tpl]
