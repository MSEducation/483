[[Longfellow Mountains]]

CATEGORIES: Mountain ranges of Maine

In 1959, the Maine Legislature voted to give the various mountains and ranges in Maine the collective name of the Longfellow Mountains, in honor of the Maine-born poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807â€“1882). Despite its official status, the term has very little currency. Most of Maine's mountains are part of the Appalachian Mountains, which extends across the state from northern New Hampshire northeastward to the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec.
