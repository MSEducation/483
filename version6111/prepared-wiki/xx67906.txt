Marcel Aymé (March 29, 1902 – October 14, 1967) was a French novelist, children's writer, humour writer and also a screenwriter and theatre playwright.

==Biography==

Marcel Aymé was born in Joigny, in the Yonne department of Burgundy. He was educated at the Collège de Dole, then worked as a journalist in Paris, among other things. His first published novel was Brûlebois (1926), and in 1929 his La Table aux crevés won the Prix Renaudot. After the great success of his novel La Jument verte (1933), translated into English as "The Green Mare", he concentrated mostly on writing and published children's stories, novels, and collections of stories. In 1935 he also started writing movie scripts. In theater, Marcel Aymé found success with his plays Lucienne et le boucher, Clérambard (1949), a farce, and Tête des autres (1952), which criticized the death penalty.
He died in 1967 and was buried in the Cimetière Saint-Vincent in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris.

==Work==

One of Aymé's most famous short stories is Le Passe-Muraille or The Walker-Through-Walls. A statue in Paris features the story's main character, Dutilleul. At the age of 42, Dutilleul suddenly discovers that he has "the remarkable gift of being able to pass through walls with perfect ease". What begins as a novelty that gives him pleasure ends up pushing Dutilleul toward ever more sinister pursuits.
