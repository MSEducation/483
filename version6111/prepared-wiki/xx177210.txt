The Shire of Mornington was a local government area about [tpl]convert|50|km|mi|0[/tpl] south of Melbourne, the state capital of Victoria, Australia, encompassing the western extremity of the Mornington Peninsula. The shire covered an area of [tpl]convert|90.65|km2|sqmi|1[/tpl] immediately to the south of Frankston, and existed from 1960 until 1994.

==History==

The Mount Eliza Road District (centred on Frankston) was created on 6 November 1860, and became a shire on 24 November 1871. On 31 May 1893, it was renamed the Shire of Frankston and Hastings, while its western riding was severed and named New Mornington, to avoid confusion with the previous entity. On 19 January 1894, it was renamed the Shire of Mornington.[tpl]cite book|title=Victorian Municipal Directory|year=1992|publisher=Arnall & Jackson|location=Brunswick|pages=769â€“770[/tpl] Accessed at State Library of Victoria, La Trobe Reading Room. 
On 15 December 1994, the Shire of Mornington was abolished, and, along with the Shires of Shire of Flinders and Hastings and parts of the City of Frankston, was merged into the newly created Shire of Mornington Peninsula.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/76E601D6DB55E88ACA25722500049195/$File/12570_1994-95.pdf|title=Victorian local government amalgamations 1994-1995: Changes to the Australian Standard Geographical Classification|author=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=1 August 1995|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|page=10|isbn=0-642-23117-6|accessdate=2007-12-16[/tpl] The Age reported in July 1994 that the result had been supported by Hastings and Mornington councils from the beginning, but opposed by Flinders, which wanted to merge with the southern coastal section of Hastings.[tpl]cite news|title=Crunch time for councils in south and south-east|last=Neales|first=Sue|date=27 July 1994|page=8|work=The Age[/tpl]
