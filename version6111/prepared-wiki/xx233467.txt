The Cizek Model Onehttp://www.classicspeakerpages.net/IP.Board/index.php?showtopic=3170 http://www.classicspeakerpages.net/IP.Board/uploads/post-8-1150017207.jpg was the first HIFI product of CIZEK Audio System, a two-way bookshelf loudspeaker system which gave a certain notoriety to Roy Cizek, founder of the company. 
This product was important because it was the first loudspeaker system which, due to its particular crossover, showed a flat impedance curve (except for the resonance peak) with a consequent easier work for the amplifier and linear frequency response.
Another peculiarity of the Cizek One was a switch that permitted selection of the Q factor of the bass frequencies; thus, the listener could choose a more or less controlled bass depending on the kind of music or ambient acoustic characteristics.http://www.classicspeakerpages.net/IP.Board/index.php?showtopic=3122 The Cizek Model One became the most successful product of the Company since 1976, first year of production.
