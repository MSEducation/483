ITV plc is a British media company that holds 12 of the 15 regional television licences that make up the ITV network, the oldest and largest commercial terrestrial television network in the United Kingdom.  The network, which is branded ITV by ITV plc, has vied with the British Broadcasting Corporation's BBC One for the status of the UK's most watched channel since the 1950s (a crown it only lost in 2005).
The company was formed by a corporate takeover by Granada plc (the parent company of Granada Television) of Carlton Communications. Granada acquired a 68% controlling interest of the newly formed company whilst Carlton retained the 32% remaining shares.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3450397.stm |title=ITV shares on London stock market |publisher=BBC News |date=2 February 2004 |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl] It began trading on 2 February 2004.

==History==

===Pre-merger===

ITV plc was the result of a merger between Granada and Carlton following the various mergers between the companies of the ITV network that had taken place from 1993 when the ownership rules were relaxed.
The first wave of mergers began with Yorkshire Television acquiring Tyne Tees Television in 1992, forming a parent group called Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television Holdings.An Overview of Television in the UK Ofcom, 2002 In 1994, Carlton Communications – which had owned a 20% stake in Central Independent Television – acquired the remainder of the company and, because of Central's shareholdings, inherited a 20% stake in Meridian Broadcasting. Later that year, Granada acquired London Weekend Television through a hostile takeover worth in the region of £750 million. MAI, which controlled Meridian Broadcasting, acquired Anglia Television; MAI became United News & Media after merging with United Newspapers – owners of The Daily Express in 1996. Ownership rules, that previously restricted ownership of ITV licences by one company to two outright, plus 20% in a third, were relaxed, and so Carlton went on to acquire Westcountry Television (later re-branding it Carlton, along with Central), Granada acquired Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Holdings (with the parent group becoming Granada Media, later simply Granada) and United acquired HTV.
The idiosyncrasies and business model of the future ITV plc operation can be found in the way these new conglomerates operated their franchises. Carlton re-branded all of its stations with its own name, creating a single identity across the whole expanse of its territory. By contrast, Granada and United, while keeping the franchisees names, centralised their continuity departments – Granada in Leeds and United in Southampton. All three, however, merged the network production operations of their franchises, creating Carlton Productions, Granada Content and United Productions.Willis steps into new role at Granada The Guardian, 12 July 2001 This would later be taken several stages further.
By the end of the 1990s, there were three dominating owners of the ITV franchises in England and Wales: Carlton Communications, Granada plc and United News and Media. In 2000, after an aborted merger attempt with Carlton, UNM decided to leave ITV and Granada bought all the UNM stations, but sold HTV to Carlton in order to comply with the permitted audience percentage covered by a single broadcasting interest.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/carlton-buys-htv-634833.html |title=Carlton buys HTV |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=24 October 2000 |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl] It kept the production arm of HTV, however, renaming it Granada Bristol and moving it out of Bath Road to a new, smaller office in Whiteladies Road (near the BBC). This arm of the company closed in 2006, following later rationalisation of ITV's production operations. The last remaining independent ITV franchise in England and Wales, Border Television, had been bought by Capital Group in 2000, and was sold on to Granada in 2001,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/granada-to-buy-border-tv-assets-for-pound50m-if-capital-wins-bid-battle-721610.html |title=Granada to buy Border TV assets for £50m if Capital wins bid battle |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=17 April 2000 |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl] with Border's radio assets being retained by Capital Radio plc.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/716361.stm |title=Capital agrees Border carve-up |publisher=BBC News |date=17 April 2000 |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl]

===The merger===

In 2004, Granada and Carlton merged, creating a single company for all ITV franchises in England and Wales.Carlton-Granada merger clears last hurdle The Guardian, 2003 One of the consequences of the merger was (according to the company) an over-capacity of studio facilities and production units around the country, which had previously been rivals, but were now all part of the same group. In order to make cost savings, several large regional headquarters, studio sites and programme departments closed and merged. Among the casualties were network production and studio facilities of Tyne Tees in Newcastle upon Tyne, Meridian in Southampton, Carlton in Nottingham and Anglia in Norwich. In all cases, ITV moved the regional franchisee to a new location complete with hi-tech facilities for news production, but with a minimal number of (physically smaller) studios and the loss of many jobs. Tyne Tees' factual department merged with Yorkshire's in Leeds (which has since closed and re-emerged as Shiver Productions);[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shiver-productions.co.uk/index.php?page=what-we-do |title=what we do |publisher=Shiver Productions |date= |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl] Meridian's factual and sport production moved to London; all network production in Nottingham was re-allocated to London, Manchester or Leeds (and the local Central News studio moved to Birmingham), and Anglia Factual, reduced to a satellite operation of ITV Studios and primarily producing output for the international market or occasionally third parties in the UK, was eventually closed in January 2012.[tpl]cite news|title=ITV Studios to close Norwich base with loss of 35 jobs|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-16549399|accessdate=25 January 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=13 January 2012[/tpl]

===Post-merger===

Prior to the merger, and despite being rivals within ITV, Granada and Carlton had already been involved in several joint ventures, including the digital terrestrial television operator ITV Digital that went bankrupt in 2002.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/bskyb-facing-legal-threat-over-ondigital-536186.html |title=BSkyB facing legal threat over Ondigital |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=17 August 2003 |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl] They also owned the digital channel ITV2, which had launched on December 1998, and 65% of the (re-branded) ITV News Channel, previously owned by ITN and originally launched as the ITN News Channel. As well as consolidating its (now 40%) shareholding in ITN itself, the newly merged company was able to buy the final 35% stake in the ITV News Channel from ITN's original partners NTL in April 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cableforum.co.uk/article/35/itv-buys-ntls-share-in-news-station-itv-news |title=ITV buys NTL's share in news station ITV News |publisher=Cableforum.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl] In November the same year, and following a frantic last-minute deal with BSkyB to buy its half of the Granada Sky Broadcasting joint venture, they launched the digital channel ITV3, replacing Granada Plus which ITV plc closed down on satellite and cable. A year later they launched ITV4. However, due to multiplex issues (and the fact that it was losing money) the ITV News Channel controversially had its hours on Freeview reduced, and was finally closed down on 23 December 2005, with its Freeview space being taken over by replacements ITV4 and CITV, which launched in November 2005 and March 2006, respectively.[tpl]cite web|author=Tuesday, 13 March 2007, 15:13 GMT |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a43891/citv-channel-celebrates-first-birthday.html |title=CITV celebrates its first birthday |work=Digital Spy |location=UK |date=13 March 2007 |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl]
In April 2006 the participation channel ITV Play was launched. Following a series of scandals surrounding participation TV, the dedicated ITV Play channel was closed down in March 2007, followed by the late-night phone-in quiz shows on the ITV Network in December 2007, however the brand continued to be used for a time for part of the gaming section of itv.com.ITV Play digital channel axed The Guardian, 13 March 2007

===Reorganisation===

There were rumours of take-over and merger bids during 2006.  For example, on 9 November 2006, NTL announced that it had approached ITV plc about a proposed merger.[ref]
