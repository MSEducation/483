Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and in all of mathematics. It states:
The conjecture has been shown to hold up through 4 × 1018“Goldbach conjecture verification" and is generally assumed to be true, but remains unproven despite considerable effort.

==Goldbach number==

A Goldbach number is an even positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two primes.  Therefore, another statement of Goldbach's conjecture is that all even integers greater than or equal to 4 are Goldbach numbers.
The expression of a given even number as a sum of two primes is called a Goldbach partition of that number. The following are examples of Goldbach partitions for some even numbers:
The number of unordered ways in which 2n can be written as the sum of two primes (for n starting at 1) is:

==Origins==

On 7 June 1742, the German mathematician Christian Goldbach wrote a letter to Leonhard Euler (letter XLIII)http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/correspondence/letters/OO0765.pdf in which he proposed the following conjecture:
He then proposed a second conjecture in the margin of his letter:
He considered 1 to be a prime number, a convention subsequently abandoned.[tpl]MathWorld|urlname=GoldbachConjecture|title=Goldbach Conjecture[/tpl]
The two conjectures are now known to be equivalent, but this did not seem to be an issue at the time.
A modern version of Goldbach's marginal conjecture is:
Euler replied in a letter dated 30 June 1742, and reminded Goldbach of an earlier conversation they had
([tpl]lang|de|"…so Ew vormals mit mir communicirt haben…"[/tpl]), in which Goldbach
remarked his original (and not marginal) conjecture followed from the following statement
which is, thus, also a conjecture of Goldbach.
In the letter dated 30 June 1742, Euler stated:
 [tpl]lang|de|“Dass … ein jeder numerus par eine summa duorum primorum sey, halte ich für ein ganz gewisses theorema, ungeachtet ich dasselbe nicht demonstriren kann.”[/tpl] ("every even integer is a sum of two primes. I regard this as a
 completely certain theorem, although I cannot prove it.")[ref]
</ref><ref name="PrimeGlossary">
</ref></blockquote>
Goldbach's third version (equivalent to the two other versions) is the form in which the conjecture is usually expressed today. It is also known as the "strong", "even", or "binary" Goldbach conjecture, to distinguish it from a weaker corollary. The strong Goldbach conjecture implies the conjecture that all odd numbers greater than 7 are the sum of three odd primes, which is known today variously as the "weak" Goldbach conjecture, the "odd" Goldbach conjecture, or the "ternary" Goldbach conjecture. While the weak Goldbach conjecture appears to have been finally proved in 2013,[tpl]cite arXiv |eprint=1305.2897 |title = Major arcs for Goldbach's theorem|last = Helfgott|first = H.A. |class=math.NT |year=2013[/tpl][tpl]cite arXiv |eprint=1205.5252/ |title = Minor arcs for Goldbach's problem |last = Helfgott|first = H.A.|class=math.NT |year=2012[/tpl] the strong conjecture has remained unsolved. If the strong Goldbach conjecture is true, the weak Goldbach conjecture will be true by implication.

==Verified results==

For small values of n, the strong Goldbach conjecture (and hence the weak Goldbach conjecture) can be verified directly.  For instance, Nils Pipping in 1938 laboriously verified the conjecture up to n ≤ 105.Pipping, Nils (1890-1982), "Die Goldbachsche Vermutung und der Goldbach-Vinogradovsche Satz." Acta. Acad. Aboensis, Math. Phys. 11, 4–25, 1938.  With the advent of computers, many more values of n have been checked; T. Oliveira e Silva is running a distributed computer search that has verified the conjecture for n ≤ 4 × 1018 (and double-checked up to 4 × 1017). One record from this search: 3325581707333960528 is the smallest number which has no Goldbach partition with a prime below 9781.Tomás Oliveira e Silva, Goldbach conjecture verification.

==Heuristic justification==

Statistical considerations which focus on the probabilistic distribution of prime numbers present informal evidence in favour of the conjecture (in both the weak and strong forms) for sufficiently large integers: the greater the integer, the more ways there are available for that number to be represented as the sum of two or three other numbers, and the more "likely" it becomes that at least one of these representations consists entirely of primes.
Since this quantity goes to infinity as n increases, we expect that every large even integer has not just one representation as the sum of two primes, but in fact has very many such representations.
This heuristic argument is actually somewhat inaccurate, because it assumes that the events of m and n − m being prime are statistically independent of each other.  For instance, if m is odd then n − m is also odd, and if m is even, then n − m is even, a non-trivial relation because, besides the number 2, only odd numbers can be prime.  Similarly, if n is divisible by 3, and m was already a prime distinct from 3, then n − m would also be coprime to 3 and thus be slightly more likely to be prime than a general number.  Pursuing this type of analysis more carefully, Hardy and Littlewood in 1923 conjectured (as part of their famous Hardy–Littlewood prime tuple conjecture) that for any fixed c ≥ 2, the number of representations of a large integer n as the sum
This is sometimes known as the extended Goldbach conjecture.  The strong Goldbach conjecture is in fact very similar to the twin prime conjecture, and the two conjectures are believed to be of roughly comparable difficulty.
The Goldbach partition functions shown here can be displayed as histograms which informatively illustrate the above equations.

As with many famous conjectures in mathematics, there are a number of purported proofs of the Goldbach conjecture, none accepted by the mathematical community.
