It collaborated with Warner Brothers to create a community called AcmeCity, which allowed users to create a web site using WB characters, logos, etc. without infringing on copyright.
When FortuneCity first came online, it offered a free web hosting account with 6MB disk space.  Later, they increased the space to 10MB, 20MB and then 100MB. However, since upgrading to 100MB, the original virtual community design has been removed; the "virtual map" of each district is gone, the division of district is also gone, but the community, mayor and district ministers remains.
The company went public in March 1998. It was oversubscribed 37 times after its initial offering.[tpl]cite news |title=Why FortuneCity Will Seek Its Fortune on Nasdaq |author=Peterson, Thane |newspaper=BusinessWeek |date=1999-11-02 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/nov1999/nf91102f.htm |accessdate=2009-10-19 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wQRWBiGx |archivedate=2011-02-11 [/tpl] FortuneCity receives its revenue mostly from advertisements.[tpl]cite news |title=How to make a Fortune on the quiet |author=Keegan, Victor |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2000-12-21 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4108405,00.html |accessdate=2009-10-19 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wQRYc6x7 |archivedate=2011-02-11 [/tpl]
