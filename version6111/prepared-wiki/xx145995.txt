The paper was aimed at youth and was composed entirely of youth writing. The writing board consisted of 12 members, selected through interview. It was at the time, the GTA's oldest youth paper. Similar in concept to papers such as Brand New Planet, and one180, News4Kids was distributed quarterly. In Sept. 2006, News4Kids went through a major cosmetic overhaul. 
Focusing generally on human-interest articles, News4Kids has a large scope of topics, spanning subjects across Toronto.
In August 2007, News4Kids was discontinued, ending its nearly 5 year long tenure.
News4Kids was a publication of Metroland Publishing, and was the sister paper of CityParent.
