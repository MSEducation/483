[[Osiris (lunar crater)]]

CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Osiris is a tiny lunar crater in the southeastern part of the Mare Serenitatis. It is located to the northeast of the small crater Dawes, and to the west of the Montes Taurus range. To the east-northeast of this position is the landing site of the Apollo 17 mission, in the Taurusâ€“Littrow valley.
This area of the surface is notable for an interrupted crater chain running from west-southwest to east-northeast.
