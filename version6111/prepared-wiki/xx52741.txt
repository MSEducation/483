From 1884 to 1915, Namibia was under the rule of the German Empire, and was known as German South-West Africa.

The ghost towns that were left behind include:

The islands of Antarctica, particularly South Georgia, were popular with whalers during the first half of the 20th century, and many of the settlements on these islands are former whaling stations.
