Wyoming Highway 789 (WYO 789) is a state route in the U.S. state of Wyoming in the United States.  Wyoming Highway 789 runs north to south from the Montana border to the Colorado border.  For most of its length, it is joined with other routes.

==Route description==

Wyoming Highway 789 begins at the Colorado border just south of Baggs. It travels north for about four miles (6 km) to Baggs. After Baggs, it continues north for about [tpl]convert|45|mi|km[/tpl] until it reaches the county line.
After crossing the county line, WYO 789 travels north for about [tpl]convert|6|mi|km[/tpl] where it reaches Exit 187 at Interstate 80/US 30. Wyoming Highway 789 joins I-80/US 30 eastbound.
Wyoming Highway 789, with I-80 and US 30, re-enters Carbon County.  Just west of Rawlins, Wyoming Highway 789 leaves at Exit 211, joining Business Loop 80 through Rawlins.  North of town, Wyoming Highway 789 intersects U.S. Route 287 and joins it north for [tpl]convert|50|mi|km[/tpl] to the county line, after which it passes through Natrona County for about [tpl]convert|2|mi|km[/tpl].
WYO 789/US 287 continue bearing in a northwest direction, passing through the towns of Jeffrey City and Sweetwater Station.  About [tpl]convert|40|mi|km[/tpl] from Sweetwater Station, WYO 789/US 287 enters Lander.  Wyoming Highway 789 splits from US 287 here and continues northeast for [tpl]convert|24|mi|km[/tpl], alone, to Riverton.  Wyoming Highway 789 joins U.S. Route 26 until they reach Shoshoni.  Here, Wyoming Highway 789/US 26 intersect U.S. Route 20 where WYO 789 continues north with US 20 west.
WYO 789 and US 20 continue through the Wind River Canyon into Thermopolis.  From there, the highway veers off in a northeasterly direction into Washakie County.  From the Washakie county line, the highway travels approximately [tpl]convert|21|mi|km[/tpl] before crossing the Big Horn River into Worland where it joins U.S Routes 16 and 20.
Upon crossing into Big Horn County, WYO 789/US 16/US 20 veers back to the northwest and crosses back over the Big Horn River after reaching Manderson.  It continues on [tpl]convert|20|mi|km[/tpl] to the north through Basin and Greybull.  Upon reaching Greybull, WYO 789/US 16/US 20 head west and join US 14 for about five miles (8 km).
At that point, Wyoming Highway 789 separates from the multiplex of US 14/16/20 and returns to its northern path along with US 310 for about [tpl]convert|28|mi|km[/tpl] to the town of Lovell.  For three miles (5 km), WYO 789/US 310 runs west along Alternate US 14.  WYO 789/US 310 then turns north three miles (5 km) to Cowley and then heads west seven miles (11 km) to Deaver.
From Deaver, WYO 789/US 310 runs six miles (10 km) north along the Park County line to Frannie.  The highway leaves Wyoming on the eastern edge of Park County and enters Montana.  Here, the 789 designation is dropped, while US 310 continues along the highway.

==History==

Highway 789 was part of a proposed border-to-border U.S. Route 789 that would have run from Sweetgrass, Montana to Nogales, Arizona.  After the US 789 proposal was rejected by AASHTO, U.S. Route 789 became part of a series of state highways numbered "789" running along the proposed route.  Wyoming, however, was the only state that actually applied the number to an existing highway (the other states simply added a concurrent SR 789 over existing highways).[tpl]cite web|title=U.S. Highway 789 (Proposed/Never Commissioned)|url=http://www.aaroads.com/west/us-789_wy.html|accessdate=2007-10-02[/tpl]  Because of this, all the states except Wyoming deleted the designation and removed the signs.
