[[Past NS Competition Winners]]

CATEGORIES: Video game culture, Electronic sports competitions, Competitive video gaming

The following list shows the past competition winners of various events and tournaments for the computer game Natural Selection (NS) divided by region. As of the 28th of June 2011, there are no active Natural Selection competitions and all tournament organizers have either shut down or are in hiatus. Thus, it seems this list will be complete, unless there are some previous tournaments that are still missing. Links to downloadable demos and shoutcasts from the finals of each tournament is provided so far as they are available.
Note: Some of the given rosters are those the clans used in the finals, not necessarily a list of all the players who took part in winning the tournament for the clan. Also, the dates given are the final day for each competition.
