Arthur Woody (April 1, 1884 - June 10, 1946) was born in Suches, Georgia.  Arthur Woody, who saw his father kill the last deer in the North Georgia mountains in 1895, is credited with bringing deer back to the North Georgia mountains.  As a forest ranger for the United States Forestry Service, he served in Georgia from 1911 to 1945 and was involved in the acquisition of land in what became the Chattahoochee National Forest.  He also is known for putting fish in streams and bringing roads to the area.
Woody was known as the "Barefoot Ranger," "Kingfish," or simply "Ranger."  He, along with "Ranger Nick" Nicholson are considered to be the two most important early figures in the history of the Chattahoochee National Forest.
Among the landmarks in the Chattahoochee National Forest honoring Woody is a trail through the Sosebee Cove, a [tpl]convert|175|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] tract of prize hardwood that Woody purchased for the Forest Service that is now part of the Brasstown Ranger District.
