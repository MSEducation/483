Dixie is also accused of a sexual assault in 2001, where it is believed he masturbated in front of a woman in a telephone booth.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/garyhughes/index.php/theaustralian/comments/uk_link_in_wa_serial_murders/ |title=UK link in WA serial murders? | date=2 October 2006 | first=Gary |last=Hughes |newspaper=The Australian |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]
In October 2006, Dixie's DNA was sent to Western Australia to be tested against that of the DNA evidence in the Claremont serial killer case between 1996 and 1997, as it is believed he was in the area at the time of the killings, and may have committed them. At his trial for the murder of Sally Anne Bowman, an unnamed Thai woman gave evidence that Dixie had stabbed and raped her in Australia in 1998; Dixie has yet to be formally charged with this attack, though a DNA sample from the woman's underwear has been matched to him.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7250896.stm |title=Woman 'stabbed by murder suspect' |publisher=BBC News |date=18 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl] Dixie denied the murder but, as part of his defence, claimed that he had spent the night on drink and drugs and had gone out to buy more cocaine. He claimed to have come across the body of Bowman, murdered, he said, by a third party, and had sex with her after she was killed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7228325.stm |title=Man 'had sex with victim's body' |publisher=BBC News |date=5 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]
Dixie was found guilty of Bowman's murder on 22 February 2008 and was sentenced to life imprisonment at the Old Bailey, where the trial judge recommended that Dixie should not be released for a minimum of 34 years, by which time he will be 70 years old. This is among the longest minimum terms ever imposed upon a single murderer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7254628.stm |title=Man gets life for model's murder |publisher=BBC News |date=22 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]
Following Dixie's conviction, Detective Superintendent Stuart Cundy, who had led the Bowman investigation, said: "It is my opinion that a national DNA register – with all its appropriate safeguards – could have identified Sally Anne's murderer within 24 hours. Instead it took nearly nine months before Mark Dixie was identified, and almost two-and-a-half years for justice to be done." The calls for a such a register were, however, turned down by ministers and other politicians who claimed that it would raise practical as well as civil liberties issues.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7260164.stm |title=Mandatory DNA database rejected |publisher=BBC News |date=23 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]
