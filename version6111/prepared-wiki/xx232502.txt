[[6.5-284 Norma]]

CATEGORIES: Pistol and rifle cartridges

The 6.5-284 Norma originated as a wildcat cartridge based on the .284 Winchester cartridge necked down to 6.5 mm.

==History==

The .284 Winchester was created around 1963, but never really caught on, except as a parent case for the wildcat 6.5mm-284.  The 6.5 caliber allowed for the use of long, aerodynamic bullets.  In 1999, Norma submitted it to CIP.  It has since been standardized as the 6.5mm-284 Norma.

==Use==

It has been used extensively in benchrest competitions and is known as an extremely accurate long range round. Using an improved version of the 6.5/284, Rich DeSimone set a [tpl]convert|1000|yd|1|sing=on[/tpl] world record at [tpl]convert|1.564|in|2|sing=on[/tpl].DeSimone's Dynamic Duo - 1000-Yard Record Rig (Reborn) and Classy New Curly Ash 6.5 Super Rich DeSimone's [tpl]convert|1000|yd|1|sing=on[/tpl] record has been broken by Tom Sarver in 2007 using a .300 Hulk wildcat cartridge that is based on the .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge.Sarver Shoots 1.403″ Group at 1000 Yards In contrast, most hunting rifles do the same at [tpl]convert|100|yd|1[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|200|yd|1[/tpl].

Also, there are many popular hunting bullets for this caliber, making it a good hunting round as well.
