Gmelinite-Na is one of the rarer zeolites but the commonest member of the gmelinite series, gmelinite-Ca, gmelinite-K and gmelinite-Na.  It is closely related to the very similar mineral chabazite. Gmelinite was named as a single species in 1825 after Christian Gottlob Gmelin (1792–1860) professor of chemistry and mineralogist from Tübingen, Germany, and in 1997 it was raised to the status of a series.Deer, Howie and Zussman (2004) Rock-Forming Minerals Volume 4B:690-696
Gmelinite-Na has been synthesised from Na-bearing aluminosilicate gels.  The naturally occurring mineral forms striking crystals, shallow, six sided double pyramids, which can be colorless, white, pale yellow, greenish, orange, pink, and red. They have been compared to an angular flying saucer.

==Structure==

The aluminosilicate framework is composed of tetrahedra linked to form parallel double six-membered rings stacked in two different positions (A and B) in the repeating arrangement AABBAABB.  The framework has no Al-Si order.  Within the structure there are cavities with a cross-section of up to 4 Å, and also wide channels parallel to the c axis with a diameter of 6.4 Å.Senderov and Shishakova (1967) Russian Chemical Bulletin 16-1:151 Space group: P63/mmc.  Unit cell parameters: a=13.72 Å, c=9.95 Å, Z=4.

==Environment==

Generally occurs in Si-poor volcanic rocks, marine basalts and breccias, associated with other sodium zeolites such as analcime,  
Na(Si2Al)O6·H2O, natrolite, Na2(Si3Al2)O10·2H2O, and chabazite-Na, Na2Ca(Si8Al4)O24·12H2O.  It also occurs in Na-rich pegmatites in alkaline rocks, and as an alteration product in some nepheline syenite intrusions.  No sedimentary gmelinite has been found.Gaines et al (1997) Dana's New Mineralogy Eighth Edition  It is generally assumed that it forms at low temperatures, less than 100 °C. It is widespread as a hydrothermal alteration product of ussingite, Na2AlSi3O8(OH), associated with gobbinsite, Na5(Si11Al5)O32·11H2O, gonnardite, (Na,Ca)2(Si,Al)5O10·3H2O, and chabazite-K.

==Notable localities==

Gmelinite-Na occurs extremely rarely at the Francon Quarry, Montreal, Canada, in sills of the igneous volcanic rock phonolite which are rich in dawsonite, NaAl(CO3)(OH)2.
Tarassoff, Peter, and Horvath, Lazlo and Elsa (2006) Mineralogical Record 37-1:35 It occurs both as pure gmelinite-Na and interlayered with chabazite in water-quenched basalts in Western Tasmania.

Associated minerals include other zeolites, especially chabazite, quartz, aragonite and calcite.
