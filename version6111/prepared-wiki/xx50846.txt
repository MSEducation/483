The New York Lizards, originally the Long Island Lizards, are a Major League Lacrosse (MLL) team based in Hempstead, New York, located on Long Island. They are original members of the MLL and lost in the league's inaugural game on June 7, 2001 to the Baltimore Bayhawks (now Chesapeake Bayhawks), 16-13. From the league's inception in 2001 through 2005, they were in the American Division. From 2006 to 2008, they were in the Eastern Conference.

==History==

In the MLL's inaugural season in 2001, the Lizards split their home games between Hofstra Stadium, now James M. Shuart Stadium, and EAB Park (now Citibank Park). For the 2002 season, they used Hofstra Stadium as their home field.  As of 2003, the Lizards played all home contests at Mitchel Athletic Complex, in Uniondale, New York until 2008. The team will return to James M. Shuart Stadium for their home games in 2009.http://www.longislandlizards.com/team/news/index.html?article_id=339   The Lizards have won American Division championships in 2001, 2002, and 2003, and Major League Lacrosse titles in 2001 and 2003.  The team made the playoffs in 2005 as a wildcard despite a losing record. The team's name and logo are based on the Italian wall lizard, a small reptile that was imported to Long Island (which has no native lizards) in the 1960s and which populate areas of the team's home town of Hempstead.
On December 14, 2012 the Lizards changed their name to the New York Lizards.http://www.majorleaguelacrosse.com/press-release/6421/long-island-lizards-change-name-to-new-york-lizards/
