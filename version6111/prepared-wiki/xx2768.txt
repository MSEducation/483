England [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-England.ogg|ˈ|ɪ|ŋ|ɡ|l|ə|n|d[/tpl] is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web |title=The Countries of the UK |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/uk_countries.asp |publisher=statistics.gov.uk |accessdate=1 February 2009 |author=Office for National Statistics |authorlink=Office for National Statistics |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081220225201/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/uk_countries.asp |archivedate=20 December 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Countries within a country|url=http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page823.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080209003312/http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page823.asp|archivedate=9 February 2008|publisher=number-10.gov.uk|accessdate=1 February 2009|authorlink=Prime Minister of the United Kingdom[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title= Changes in the list of subdivision names and code elements (Page 11)|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/newsletter_i-9.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=International Organization for Standardization|accessdate=1 February 2009[/tpl] It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies north west of England, whilst the Celtic Sea lies to the south west. The North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south separate it from continental Europe. Most of England comprises the central and southern part of the island of Great Britain which lies in the North Atlantic. The country also includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.
The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period, but it takes its name from the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. England became a unified state in 927 AD, and since the Age of Discovery, which began during the 15th century, has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world.[tpl]cite web |title= England – Culture|url=http://www.britainusa.com/sections/index_nt1.asp?i=41105&L1=41105&L2=41105&D=0|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080516162153/http://www.britainusa.com/sections/index_nt1.asp?i=41105&L1=41105&L2=41105&D=0|archivedate=16 May 2008|publisher=britainusa.com|accessdate=1 February 2009[/tpl] The English language, the Anglican Church, and English law – the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world – developed in England, and the country's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/1038758.stm |title=Country profile: United Kingdom |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 February 2009 | date=26 October 2009[/tpl] The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world's first industrialised nation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Global_Warming/Older/Industrial_Revolution.html |publisher=Ace.mmu.ac.uk |title=Industrial Revolution|accessdate=1 February 2009[/tpl]
England's terrain mostly comprises low hills and plains, especially in central and southern England. However, there are uplands in the north (for example, the mountainous Lake District, Pennines, and Yorkshire Dales) and in the south west (for example, Dartmoor and the Cotswolds). The former capital of England was Winchester until replaced by London in the 12th century. Today London is the largest metropolitan area in the United Kingdom and the largest urban zone in the European Union by most measures.According to the European Statistical Agency, London is the largest Larger Urban Zone which uses conurbations and areas of high population as its definition. A ranking of population within municipal boundaries places London first. However, the University of Avignon in France claims that Paris is first and London second when including the whole urban area and hinterland, that is the outlying cities as well. The population of over 53 million comprises 84% of the population of the United Kingdom, largely concentrated around London, the South East, and conurbations in the Midlands, the North West, the North East and Yorkshire, which each developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century.2011 Census - Population and household estimates for England and Wales, March 2011.

The Kingdom of England – which after 1284 included Wales – was a sovereign state until 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union put into effect the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year, resulting in a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland to create the Kingdom of Great Britain.William E. Burns, A Brief History of Great Britain, p. xxiActs of Union 1707 parliament.uk. Retrieved 27 January 2011 In 1801, Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland through another Act of Union to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922 the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

==Toponymy[tpl]Anchor|Etymology[/tpl]==

The name "England" is derived from the Old English name Englaland, which means "land of the Angles".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=England|title=England|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=21 July 2010[/tpl] The Angles were one of the Germanic tribes that settled in Great Britain during the Early Middle Ages. The Angles came from the Angeln peninsula in the Bay of Kiel area of the Baltic Sea.[tpl]harvnb|Ripley|1869|p=570[/tpl]. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first known use of "England" to refer to the southern part of the island of Great Britain occurs in 897, and its modern spelling was first used in 1538.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/62243|title=England|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=12 July 2013[/tpl]
The earliest attested mention of the name occurs in the 1st-century work by Tacitus, Germania, in which the Latin word Anglii is used.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/tacitus-germanygord.html |title= Germania|publisher=Tacitus|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] The etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars; it has been suggested that it derives from the shape of the Angeln peninsula, an angular shape.[tpl]cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50075354?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=Angle&first=1&max_to_show=10 |title=Angle|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl] How and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others, such as the Saxons, came to be used for the entire country and its people is not known, but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the Germanic people in Britain Angli Saxones or English Saxons.[tpl]harvnb|Crystal|2004| pp=26–27[/tpl] In Scottish Gaelic, another language which developed on the island of Great Britain, the Saxon tribe gave their name to the word for England (Sasunn);[tpl]cite book|last=Forbes|first=John|title=The Principles of Gaelic Grammar|year=1848|publisher=Oliver, Boyd and Tweeddale|location=Edinburgh[/tpl] similarly, the Welsh name for the English language is "Saesneg".
An alternative name for England is Albion. The name Albion originally referred to the entire island of Great Britain. The nominally earliest record of the name appears in the Aristotelian Corpus, specifically the 4th century BC De Mundo:[tpl]harvnb|Massey|2007|p=440[/tpl]. "Beyond the Pillars of Hercules is the ocean that flows round the earth. In it are two very large islands called Britannia; these are Albion and Ierne".Greek [tpl]lang|grc|"... ἐν τούτῳ γε μὴν νῆσοι μέγιστοι τυγχάνουσιν οὖσαι δύο, Βρεττανικαὶ λεγόμεναι, Ἀλβίων καὶ Ἰέρνη, ...", transliteration "... en toutoi ge men nesoi megistoi tynchanousin ousai dyo, Brettanikai legomenai, Albion kai Ierne, ..."[/tpl], translation "... There are two very large islands in it, called the British Isles, Albion and Ierne; ..."; [tpl]cite book|last=Aristotle or Pseudo-Aristotle|coauthors=E. S. Forster (translator), D. J. Furley (translator)|title=On Sophistical Refutations. On Coming-to-be and Passing Away. On the Cosmos.|url=http://ia600300.us.archive.org/13/items/onsophisticalref00arisuoft/onsophisticalref00arisuoft.djvu|publisher = William Heinemann LTD, Harvard University Press|chapter=On the Cosmos, 393b12|pages=360–361[/tpl] at the Open Library Project.[tpl]DjVulink[/tpl] But modern scholar consensus ascribes De Mundo not to Aristotle but to Pseudo-Aristotle, i.e. it was written later in the Graeco-Roman period or afterwards. The word Albion (Ἀλβίων) or insula Albionum has two possible origins. It either derives from a cognate of the Latin albus meaning white, a reference to the white cliffs of Dover, the only part of Britain visible from the European Continent,[tpl]harvnb|Room|2006|p=23[/tpl]. or from the phrase  the "island of the Albiones[tpl]harvnb|Major|2004|p=84[/tpl]. in the now lost Massaliote Periplus, that is attested through Avienus' Ora MaritimaAvienus' Ora Maritima, verses 111-112, i.e. eamque late gens Hiernorum colit; propinqua rursus insula Albionum patet. to which the former presumably served as a source. Albion is now applied to England in a more poetic capacity.[tpl]harvnb|Foster|1988|p=9[/tpl]. Another romantic name for England is Loegria, related to the Welsh word for England, Lloegr, and made popular by its use in Arthurian legend.

==History==

===Prehistory and antiquity===

The earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now known as England was that of Homo antecessor, dating to approximately 780,000 years ago. The oldest proto-human bones discovered in England date from 500,000 years ago.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/the-timeline-of-britain/boxgrove.htm|title=500,000 BC – Boxgrove|accessdate=20 December 2010|work=Current Archaeology|publisher=Current Publishing[/tpl] Modern humans are known to have first inhabited the area during the Upper Paleolithic period, though permanent settlements were only established within the last 6,000 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.personal.rdg.ac.uk/~sgs04rh/SWRivers/Palaeolithic%20Archaeology%20Teaching%20Resource%20Box_Lifestyles_Basic.pdf|title= Palaeolithic Archaeology Teaching Resource Box|publisher= Palaeolithic Rivers of South-West Britain Project(2006)|accessdate=20 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geo-east.org.uk/special_projects/eco_culture.htm|title= Chalk east|publisher= A Geo East Project|accessdate=20 December 2010[/tpl]
After the last ice age only large mammals such as mammoths, bison and woolly rhinoceros remained. Roughly 11,000 years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula.[tpl]harvnb|Oppenheimer|2006|p=173[/tpl]. The sea level was lower than now, and Britain was connected by land bridge to both Ireland and Eurasia.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.qpg.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/tertiaryrivers/tectonics.html |title=Tertiary Rivers: Tectonic and structural background |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=9 September 2009[/tpl]
As the seas rose, it was separated from Ireland 10,000 years ago and from Eurasia two millennia later.
The Beaker culture arrived around 2500 BC, introducing drinking and food vessels constructed from clay, as well as vessels used as reduction pots to smelt copper ores.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tp.revistas.csic.es/index.php/tp/article/viewFile/5/5|title=Function and significance of Bell Beaker pottery according to data from residue analyses|accessdate=21 December 2010[/tpl] It was during this time that major Neolithic monuments such as Stonehenge and Avebury were constructed. By heating together tin and copper, both of which were in abundance in the area, the Beaker culture people made bronze, and later iron from iron ores. The development of iron smelting allowed the construction of better ploughs, advancing agriculture (for instance, with Celtic fields), as well as the production of more effective weapons.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=bn88JPk_Fr0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=inventions+in+trade#v=onepage&q&f=false|last=Reid|first=Struan|title=Inventions and Trade.

During the Iron Age, Celtic culture, deriving from the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures, arrived from Central Europe. Brythonic was the spoken language during this time. Society was tribal; according to Ptolemy's Geographia there were around 20 tribes in the area. Earlier divisions are unknown because the Britons were not literate. Like other regions on the edge of the Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans. Julius Caesar of the Roman Republic attempted to invade twice in 55 BC; although largely unsuccessful, he managed to set up a client king from the Trinovantes.
The Romans invaded Britain in AD 43 during the reign of Emperor Claudius, subsequently conquering much of Britain, and the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire as Britannia province.[tpl]cite news |url= http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,406152,00.html |title=Dig uncovers Boudicca's brutal streak |accessdate=5 September 2009 |work=The Observer  |location=London | first=Jason | last=Burke | date=2 December 2000 [/tpl] The best-known of the native tribes who attempted to resist were the Catuvellauni led by Caratacus.

There is debate about when Christianity was first introduced; it was no later than the 4th century, with probability lying much earlier. According to Bede, missionaries were sent from Rome by Eleutherius at the request of the chieftain Lucius of Britain in AD 180 to settle differences as to Eastern and Western ceremonials which were disturbing the church. There are traditions linked to Glastonbury claiming an introduction through Joseph of Arimathea, while others claim through Lucius of Britain.[tpl]harvnb|Wright|2008|p=143[/tpl]. By 410, as the Empire declined, Britain was left exposed by the withdrawal of Roman army units, to defend the frontiers in continental Europe and partake in civil wars. At this time Celtic Christian monastic and missionary movements flourished: Patrick (5th-century Ireland); and in the 6th century Brendan (Clonfert), Comgall (Bangor), David (Wales), Aiden (Lindisfarne), and Columba (Iona). This period of Christianity was influenced by ancient Celtic culture in its sensibilities, polity, practices, and theology. Local "congregations" were centered in the monastic community, and monastic leaders were more like chieftains, as peers, rather than in the more hierarchical system of the Roman-dominated church (see Early Christian Christianity, Brendan Lehane, Constable, London: John Murray Ltd., 1968).    

===Middle Ages===

Roman military withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Angles, Saxons and Jutes who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province and began to settle, initially in the eastern part of the country.[tpl]cite web |title=Overview: Anglo-Saxons, 410 to 800|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/overview_anglo_saxons_01.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 December 2010|first=Edward|last=James[/tpl] Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons' victory at the Battle of Mount Badon, but subsequently resumed, over-running the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under Brythonic control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century. Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a Dark Age. The nature and progression of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain is consequently subject to considerable disagreement. Roman-dominated Christianity had in general disappeared from the conquered territories, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by Augustine from 597 onwards.[tpl]cite web |title=The Christian Tradition|url=http://www.picturesofengland.com/history/england-history-p4.html|publisher=PicturesofEngland.com|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] Disputes between the Roman- and Celtic-dominated forms of Christianity ended in victory for the Roman tradition at the Council of Whitby (664), which was ostensibly about haircuts and the date of Easter, but more significantly, about the differences in Roman and Celtic forms of authority, theology, and practice (Lehane).
During the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, Kent and Sussex. Over the following centuries this process of political consolidation continued.[tpl]harvnb|Kirby|2000|p=4[/tpl] The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence.[tpl]harvnb|Lyon|1960|p=23[/tpl]. In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the Danes culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under Alfred the Great was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the Danelaw. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under Æthelstan in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by Eadred in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013 and again by his son Cnut in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived North Sea empire that also included Denmark and Norway. However the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of Edward the Confessor in 1042.
A dispute over the succession to Edward led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/normans/overview_normans_01.shtml | title=Overview: The Normans, 1066–1154 |publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 December 2010[/tpl] The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries.[tpl]harvnb|Crouch|2006|pp=2–4[/tpl] This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the English language.[tpl]cite news | title=Norman invasion word impact study | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/mid/7254446.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 December 2010 | date=20 February 2008[/tpl]
Subsequently the House of Plantagenet from Anjou inherited the English throne under Henry II, adding England to the budding Angevin Empire of fiefs the family had inherited in France including Aquitaine.[tpl]harvnb|Bartlett|1999|p=124[/tpl]. They reigned for three centuries, proving noted monarchs such as Richard I, Edward I, Edward III and Henry V. The period saw changes in trade and legislation, including the signing of the Magna Carta, an English legal charter used to limit the sovereign's powers by law and protect the privileges of freemen. Catholic monasticism flourished, providing philosophers and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were founded with royal patronage. The Principality of Wales became a Plantagenet fief during the 13th century[tpl]cite web |title=Edward I (r. 1272–1307)|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/OutPut/Page61.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080624181028/http://www.royal.gov.uk/OutPut/Page61.asp|archivedate=24 June 2008|publisher=Royal.gov.uk |accessdate=21 September 2009[/tpl] and the Lordship of Ireland was given to the English monarchy by the Pope.
During the 14th century, the Plantagenets and House of Valois both claimed to be legitimate claimants to the House of Capet and with it France; and the two powers clashed in the Hundred Years' War.[tpl]harvnb|Fowler|1967|p=208[/tpl]. The Black Death epidemic hit England; starting in 1348, it eventually killed up to half of England's inhabitants.[tpl]harvnb|Ziegler|2003|p=230[/tpl].[tpl]harvnb|Goldberg|1996|p=4[/tpl]. From 1453 to 1487 civil war occurred between two branches of the royal family — the Yorkists and Lancastrians— known as the Wars of the Roses.[tpl]harvnb|Crofton|2007|p=111[/tpl]. Eventually it led to the Yorkists losing the throne entirely to a Welsh noble family the Tudors, a branch of the Lancastrians headed by Henry Tudor who invaded with Welsh and Breton mercenaries, gaining victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field where the Yorkist king Richard III was killed.[tpl]cite web |title=Richard III (r. 1483–1485)|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page50.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080710093939/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page50.asp|archivedate=10 July 2008|publisher=Royal.gov.uk |accessdate=21 September 2009[/tpl]

Henry VIII broke from communion with the Catholic Church, over issues relating to divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England. In contrast with much of European Protestantism, the roots of the split were more political than theological.[tpl]#tag:ref|As Roger Scruton explains, "The Reformation must not be confused with the changes introduced into the Church of England during the 'Reformation Parliament' of 1529–36, which were of a political rather than a religious nature, designed to unite the secular and religious sources of authority within a single sovereign power: the Anglican Church did not make substantial change in doctrine until later."[tpl]harvnb|Scruton|1982|p=470[/tpl].|group=nb[/tpl] He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I. The former brought the country back to Catholicism, while the later broke from it again, more forcefully asserting the supremacy of Anglicanism.
Competing with Spain, the first English colony in the Americas was founded in 1585 by explorer Walter Raleigh in Virginia and named Roanoke. The Roanoke colony failed and is known as the lost colony, after it was found abandoned on the return of the late arriving supply ship.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=W8cr4Vgt9ekC&printsec=frontcover&dq=roanoke+colony#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Roanak:the abandoned colony|author=Karen Ordahl|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield publishers Inc|accessdate=24 December 2010|isbn=978-0-7425-5263-0|date=25 February 2007[/tpl] With the East India Company, England also competed with the Dutch and French in the East. In 1588, during the Elizabethan period, an English fleet under Francis Drake defeated an invading Spanish Armada. The political structure of the island then changed in 1603, when the King of Scots, James VI, a kingdom which was a longtime rival to English interests, inherited the throne of England as James I—creating a personal union .[tpl]harvnb|Colley|1992|p=12[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |title=Making the Act of Union|url=http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/01_background.html|publisher=Parliament.uk|accessdate=5 September 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080609075346/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/01_background.html |archivedate = 9 June 2008[/tpl] He styled himself King of Great Britain, although this had no basis in English law.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_089/89_055_066.pdf|format=PDF|title=The term "Great Britain" in the Middle Ages|last=Hay|first=Denys|publisher=ads.ahds.ac.uk|accessdate=19 February 2009|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20090325061737/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_089/89_055_066.pdf|archivedate=25 March 2009|format=PDF[/tpl] Under the auspices of King James VI and I the so-called Authorized King James Version of the Holy Bible was published in 1611. It has not only been ranked with Shakespeare's works as the greatest masterpiece of literature in the English language but also was the standard version of the Bible read by most Protestant Christians for four hundred years until modern revisions were produced in the 20th century.
Based on conflicting political, religious and social positions, the English Civil War was fought between the supporters of Parliament and those of King Charles I, sometimes known colloquially as Roundheads and Cavaliers respectively. This was an interwoven part of the wider multifaceted Wars of the Three Kingdoms, involving Scotland and Ireland. The Parliamentarians were victorious, Charles I was executed and the kingdom replaced with the Commonwealth. Leader of the Parliament forces, Oliver Cromwell declared himself Lord Protector in 1653, a period of personal rule followed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/143822/Oliver-Cromwell|title=Oliver Cromwell (English statesman)|year=2009|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=8 August 2009[/tpl] After Cromwell's death and the resignation of his son Richard as Lord Protector, Charles II was invited to return as monarch in 1660 in a move called the Restoration. It was now constitutionally established that King and Parliament should rule together, though Parliament would have the real power. This was established with the Bill of Rights in 1689. Among the statutes set down were that the law could only be made by Parliament and could not be suspended by the King, also the King could not impose taxes or raise an army without prior approval by Parliament.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=mPoqfoiIp4sC&pg=PA340&lpg=PA340&dq=with+the+restoration+it+was+not+constitutionally+established+that+king+and+parliament+should+rule+together#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=World Civilization|author=Philip J.

In Parliament two factions had emerged—the Tories and Whigs. Though the Tories initially supported Catholic king James II, some of them, along with the Whigs, deposed him in the Revolution of 1688 and invited Dutch prince William III to become monarch. Some English people, especially in the north, were Jacobites and continued to support James and his sons. After the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed, the two countries joined in political union, to create the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. To accommodate the union, institutions such as the law and national church of each remained separate.[tpl]harvnb|Gallagher|2006|p=14[/tpl].

===Late Modern and contemporary===

Under the newly formed Kingdom of Great Britain, output from the Royal Society and other English initiatives combined with the Scottish Enlightenment to create innovations in science and engineering, while the enormous growth in British overseas trade protected by the Royal Navy paved the way for the establishment of the British Empire. Domestically it drove the Industrial Revolution, a period of profound change in the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of England, resulting in industrialised agriculture, manufacture, engineering and mining, as well as new and pioneering road, rail and water networks to facilitate their expansion and development.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/victorians/workshop_of_the_world_01.shtml|title=The Workshop of the World|author=Hudson, Pat|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 December 2010[/tpl] The opening of Northwest England's Bridgewater Canal in 1761 ushered in the canal age in Britain.[tpl]Harvnb|Office for National Statistics|2000|p=5[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|McNeil|Nevell|2000|p=4[/tpl].

===Politics===

As part of the United Kingdom, the basic political system in England is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary system.[tpl]cite web |title=The British Parliamentary System|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A591383|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=20 April 2010[/tpl] There has not been a Government of England since 1707, when the Acts of Union 1707, putting into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union, joined England and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.[tpl]cite web |title=The first Parliament of Great Britain|url=http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_02_great.html|publisher=Parliament.uk|accessdate=5 September 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080621165514/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_02_great.html |archivedate = 21 June 2008[/tpl] Before the union England was ruled by its monarch and the Parliament of England. Today England is governed directly by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, although other countries of the United Kingdom have devolved governments.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/devolution.aspx|title=Devolution in the United Kingdom|date=26 March 2009|author=Cabinet Office|authorlink=Cabinet Office|publisher=cabinetoffice.gov.uk|accessdate=16 August 2009[/tpl] In the House of Commons which is the lower house of the British Parliament based at the Palace of Westminster, there are 532 Members of Parliament (MPs) for constituencies in England, out of the 650 total.[tpl]cite web |title=Lists of MPs|url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/ |publisher=Parliament.uk |accessdate=21 May 2009[/tpl]
In the United Kingdom general election, 2010 the Conservative Party had won an absolute majority in England's 532 contested seats with 61 seats more than all other parties combined (the Speaker of the House not being counted as a Conservative). However, taking Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales into account this was not enough to secure an overall majority, resulting in a hung parliament.[tpl]cite news |title=What is a hung parliament?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8427233.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=20 May 2009 | date=7 May 2009[/tpl] In order to achieve a majority the Conservative party, headed by David Cameron, entered into a coalition agreement with the third largest party, the Liberal Democrats, led by Nick Clegg. Subsequently the Labour Party leader, Gordon Brown was forced to step down as prime minister[tpl]cite news |title=Gordon Brown's resignation speech |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8676273.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=20 May 2009 | date=11 May 2009[/tpl] and leader of the Labour party, now led by Ed Miliband.
As the United Kingdom is a member of the European Union, there are elections held regionally in England to decide who is sent as Members of the European Parliament. The 2009 European Parliament election saw the regions of England elect the following MEPs: 23 Conservatives, ten Labour, nine UK Independence Party (UKIP), nine Liberal Democrats, two Greens and two British National Party (BNP).[tpl]cite news |title=European Election 2009: UK Results|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/elections/euro/09/html/ukregion_999999.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 September 2009 | date=19 April 2009[/tpl]
Since devolution, in which other countries of the United Kingdom—Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland—each have their own devolved parliament or assemblies for local issues, there has been debate about how to counterbalance this in England. Originally it was planned that various regions of England would be devolved, but following the proposal's rejection by the North East in a referendum, this has not been carried out.
One major issue is the West Lothian question, in which MPs from Scotland and Wales are able to vote on legislation affecting only England, while English MPs have no equivalent right to legislate on devolved matters.[tpl]cite news |title=West Lothian question|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7702326.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 September 2009 | date=31 October 2008[/tpl] This when placed in the context of England being the only country of the United Kingdom not to have free cancer treatment, prescriptions, residential care for the elderly and free top-up university fees,[tpl]cite web |title=Are Scottish people better off?|url=http://money.uk.msn.com/consumer/article.aspx?cp-documentid=6543296|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080417222726/http://money.uk.msn.com/consumer/article.aspx?cp-documentid=6543296|archivedate=17 April 2008|publisher=MSN Money|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] has led to a steady rise in English nationalism.[tpl]cite news |title=English nationalism 'threat to UK'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/596703.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 September 2009 | date=9 January 2000[/tpl] Some have suggested the creation of a devolved English parliament,[tpl]cite news |title=Gordon Brown pressed on English parliament|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article4061785.ece|work=The Times  |location=London|accessdate=5 September 2009 | first=Lorraine | last=Davidson | date=3 June 2008[/tpl] while others have proposed simply limiting voting on legislation which only affects England to English MPs.[tpl]cite news |title=English votes for English laws' plan by Tories|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/english-votes-for-english-laws-plan-by-tories-857647.html|accessdate=5 September 2009|work=The Independent  | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Grice | date=1 July 2008[/tpl]

===Law===

The English law legal system, developed over the centuries, is the basis of common law[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=248|title=Common Law|publisher=ALM Media Properties|work=The People's Law Dictionary|accessdate=5 October 2013[/tpl] legal systems used in most Commonwealth countries[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~law/ASLH/conferences/2000conference/101900345b.htm |title=The Common Law in the British Empire |publisher=H-net.msu.edu |date=19 October 2000 |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl] and the United States (except Louisiana). Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the Courts of England and Wales continued, under the Treaty of Union, as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland. The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts, applying their common sense and knowledge of legal precedent—stare decisis—to the facts before them.[tpl]harvnb|Fafinski|2007|p=60[/tpl].
The court system is headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice for civil cases, and the Crown Court for criminal cases.[tpl]harvnb|Fafinski|2007|p=127[/tpl]. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in England and Wales. It was created in 2009 after constitutional changes, taking over the judicial functions of the House of Lords.[tpl]cite web |title=Constitutional reform: A Supreme Court for the United Kingdom|url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/supremecourt/supreme.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=DCA.gov.uk |accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] A decision of the Supreme Court is binding on every other court in the hierarchy, which must follow its directions.[tpl]harvnb|Fafinski|2007|p=67[/tpl].

===Regions, counties, and districts===

The subdivisions of England consist of up to four levels of subnational division controlled through a variety of types of administrative entities created for the purposes of local government. The highest tier of local government were the nine regions of England: North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East, South East, South West, and London. These were created in 1994 as Government Offices, used by the British Government to deliver a wide range of policies and programmes regionally, but there are no elected bodies at this level, except in London, and in 2011 the regional Government offices were abolished.[tpl]cite news |title=Tiers shed as regional government offices disappear|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/mar/29/regional-government-disappears-1500-jobs-lost |work=The Guardian  |accessdate=16 June 2011 |location=London |first=Hilary |last=Cooper |date=29 March 2011[/tpl] The same boundaries remain in use for electing Members of the European Parliament on a regional basis.
After devolution began to take place in other parts of the United Kingdom it was planned that referendums for the regions of England would take place for their own elected regional assemblies as a counterweight. London accepted in 1998: the London Assembly was created two years later. However, when the proposal was rejected by the northern England devolution referendums, 2004 in the North East, further referendums were cancelled.[tpl]cite news |title=Prescott's dream in tatters as North East rejects assembly |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article503255.ece |work=The Times  |location=London |accessdate=5 September 2009 | first=Jill | last=Sherman | coauthors=Andrew Norfolk | date=5 November 2004[/tpl] The regional assemblies outside London were abolished in 2010, and their functions transferred to respective Regional Development Agencies and a new system of local authority leaders' boards.[tpl]cite web|title=Prosperous Places|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/citiesandregions/pdf/1073344.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ln5KtF1u|archivedate=5 December 2009 |publisher=communities.gov.uk |accessdate=5 September 2009 |author=Department for Communities and Local Government|authorlink=Department for Communities and Local Government[/tpl]
Below the regional level, all of England is divided into 48 ceremonial counties.[tpl]harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|2002|p=100[/tpl] These are used primarily as a geographical frame of reference and have developed gradually since the Middle Ages, with some established as recently as 1974.[tpl]harvnb|Redcliffe-Maud|Wood|1974[/tpl]. Each has a Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff; these posts are used to represent the British monarch locally. Outside Greater London and the Isles of Scilly, England is also divided into 83 metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties; these correspond to areas used for the purposes of local government[tpl]harvnb|Singh|2009|p=53[/tpl]. and may consist of a single district or be divided into several.
There are six metropolitan counties based on the most heavily urbanised areas, which do not have county councils. In these areas the principal authorities are the councils of the subdivisions, the metropolitan boroughs. Elsewhere, 27 non-metropolitan "shire" counties have a county council and are divided into districts, each with a district council. They are typically, though not always, found in more rural areas. The remaining non-metropolitan counties are of a single district and usually correspond to large towns or sparsely populated counties; they are known as unitary authorities. Greater London has a different system for local government, with 32 London boroughs, plus the City of London covering a small area at the core, governed by the City of London Corporation.[tpl]harvnb|Axford|2002|p=315[/tpl]. At the most localised level, much of England is divided into civil parishes with councils; they do not exist in Greater London.[tpl]harvnb|Singh|2009|p=54[/tpl].

Geographically England includes the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, plus such offshore islands as the Isle of Wight and the Isles of Scilly.

There are karst landscapes in calcite areas such as parts of Yorkshire and Derbyshire. The Pennine landscape is high moorland in upland areas, indented by fertile valleys of the region's rivers. They contain three national parks, the Yorkshire Dales, Northumberland, and the Peak District. The highest point in England, at [tpl]convert|978|m|ft[/tpl], is Scafell Pike in Cumbria. Straddling the border between England and Scotland are the Cheviot Hills.
The English Lowlands are to the south of the Pennines, consisting of green rolling hills, including the Cotswold Hills, Chiltern Hills, North and South Downs—where they meet the sea they form white rock exposures such as the cliffs of Dover. The granite Southwest Peninsula in the West Country includes upland moorland, such as Dartmoor and Exmoor, and enjoys a mild climate; both are national parks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/aboutus|title=National Parks – About us|publisher=nationalparks.gov.uk|accessdate=5 December 2010[/tpl]

===Climate===

England has a temperate maritime climate: it is mild with temperatures not much lower than [tpl]convert|0|°C|°F[/tpl] in winter and not much higher than [tpl]convert|32|°C|°F[/tpl] in summer.[tpl]cite web |title=What is the Climate like in Britain?|url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/questions/weather/|publisher=Woodlands Kent|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] The weather is damp relatively frequently and is changeable. The coldest months are January and February, the latter particularly on the English coast, while July is normally the warmest month. Months with mild to warm weather are May, June, September and October. Rainfall is spread fairly evenly throughout the year.
Important influences on the climate of England are its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, its northern latitude and the warming of the sea by the Gulf Stream. Rainfall is higher in the west, and parts of the Lake District receive more rain than anywhere else in the country. Since weather records began, the highest temperature recorded was [tpl]convert|38.5|°C|°F[/tpl] on 10 August 2003 at Brogdale in Kent,[tpl]cite news |title=Temperature record changes hands|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/3153532.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 September 2009 | date=30 September 2003[/tpl] while the lowest was [tpl]convert|−26.1|°C|°F[/tpl] on 10 January 1982 in Edgmond, Shropshire.[tpl]cite web |title=English Climate|url=http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/location/england/#temperature|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071219165514/http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/location/england/#temperature|archivedate=19 December 2007|publisher=MetOffice.com[/tpl]

===Major conurbations===

The Greater London Urban Area is by far the largest urban area in England[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/747.aspx|title=2011 Census - Built-up areas| work= | publisher=ONS | accessdate=5 February 2014[/tpl] and one of the busiest cities in the world. It is considered a global city and has a population larger than other countries in the United Kingdom besides England itself. Other urban areas of considerable size and influence tend to be in northern England or the English Midlands. There are fifty settlements which have been designated city status in England, while the wider United Kingdom has sixty-six.
While many cities in England are quite large in size, such as Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle, Bradford, Nottingham and others, a large population is not necessarily a prerequisite for a settlement to be afforded city status.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/uk/the-complete-guide-to-cathedral-cities-in-the-uk-760201.html|title=The Complete Guide To: Cathedral cities in the UK|last=O'Brian|first=Harriet|date=24 November 2007|work=The Independent  |location=London|accessdate=8 September 2009 [/tpl] Traditionally the status was afforded to towns with diocesan cathedrals and so there are smaller cities like Wells, Ely, Ripon, Truro and Chichester.

===Science and technology===

Prominent English figures from the field of science and mathematics include Sir Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday, Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle, Joseph Priestley, J. J. Thomson, Charles Babbage, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking, Christopher Wren, Alan Turing, Francis Crick, Joseph Lister, Tim Berners-Lee, Paul Dirac, Andrew Wiles and Richard Dawkins. Some experts claim that the earliest concept of a metric system was invented by John Wilkins, the first secretary of the Royal Society, in 1668.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6890000/newsid_6898200/6898274.stm?bw=nb&mp=wm&news=1&ms3=10|publisher=BBC News|title=Metric system was British|accessdate=5 September 2009 | date=13 July 2007[/tpl]
As the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, England was home to many significant inventors during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Famous English engineers include Isambard Kingdom Brunel, best known for the creation of the Great Western Railway, a series of famous steamships, and numerous important bridges, hence revolutionising public transport and modern-day engineering.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.designmuseum.org/designinbritain/isambard-kingdom-brunel|publisher=DesignMuseum.org|title=Isambard Kingdom Brunel|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] Thomas Newcomen's steam engine helped spawn the Industrial Revolution.[tpl]harvnb|Oakes|2002|p=214[/tpl] The Father of Railways, George Stephenson, built the first public inter-city railway line in the world, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830.

===Transport===

The Department for Transport is the government body responsible for overseeing transport in England. There are many motorways in England, and many other trunk roads, such as the A1 Great North Road, which runs through eastern England from London to Newcastle[tpl]harvnb|UK Parliament|2007|p=175[/tpl] (much of this section is motorway) and onward to the Scottish border. The longest motorway in England is the M6, from Rugby through the North West up to the Anglo-Scottish border. Other major routes include: the M1 from London to Leeds, the M25 which encircles London, the M60 which encircles Manchester, the M4 from London to South Wales, the M62 from Liverpool via Manchester to East Yorkshire, and the M5 from Birmingham to Bristol and the South West.
Bus transport across the country is widespread; major companies include National Express, Arriva and Go-Ahead Group. The red double-decker buses in London have become a symbol of England. There is a rapid rail network in two English cities: the London Underground; and the Tyne and Wear Metro in Newcastle, Gateshead and Sunderland.[tpl]harvnb|White|2002|p=63[/tpl]. There are several tram networks, such as the Blackpool tramway, Manchester Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram and Midland Metro, and the Tramlink system centred on Croydon in South London.
Rail transport in England is the oldest in the world: passenger railways originated in England in 1825.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.moorerail.com/history/timeline1825.asp|title=27 September 1825 – Opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway|publisher=The Stockton and Darlington Railway|accessdate=5 October 2013[/tpl] Much of Britain's [tpl]convert|16116|km|mi[/tpl] of rail network lies in England, covering the country fairly extensively, although a high proportion of railway lines were closed in the second half of the 20th century. There are plans to reopen lines such as the Varsity Line between Oxford and Cambridge. These lines are mostly standard gauge (single, double or quadruple track) though there are also a few narrow gauge lines. There is rail transport access to France and Belgium through an undersea rail link, the Channel Tunnel, which was completed in 1994.
England has extensive domestic and international aviation links. The largest airport is London Heathrow, which is the world's busiest airport measured by number of international passengers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110223-710213.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0OE2ky|archivedate=19 May 2011|title=Delta Expects New Slots To Foster Growth At Heathrow Airport|accessdate=23 March 2011|work=The Wall Street Journal| date=23 February 2011[/tpl] Other large airports include Manchester Airport, London Stansted Airport, Luton Airport and Birmingham Airport. By sea there is ferry transport, both local and international, including to Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium.[tpl]harvnb|Else|2007|p=781[/tpl]. There are around [tpl]convert|7100|km|mi|-2|abbr=on[/tpl] of navigable waterways in England, half of which is owned by the Canal and River Trust, however water transport is very limited. The Thames is the major waterway in England, with imports and exports focused at the Port of Tilbury in the Thames Estuary, one of the United Kingdom's three major ports.

==Healthcare==

The National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly funded healthcare system in England responsible for providing the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect the provisions of the National Health Service Act 1946. It was based on the findings of the Beveridge Report, prepared by economist and social reformer William Beveridge.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/beveridge_william.shtml|title=BBC History on William Beveridge|accessdate=5 September 2009|publisher=BBC News[/tpl] The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including National Insurance payments,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-00724.pdf | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ln5L5oTN | archivedate=5 December 2009| title=NHS Expenditure in England |format=PDF | work=House of Commons Library | accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] and it provides most of its services free at the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/NHScosts/DH_087013| title=NHS costs and exemptions| work=Department of Health| accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot[/tpl]
The government department responsible for the NHS is the Department of Health, headed by the Secretary of State for Health, who sits in the British Cabinet.

===Language===

As its name suggests, the English language, today spoken by hundreds of millions of people around the world, originated as the language of England, where it remains the principal tongue today. It is an Indo-European language in the Anglo-Frisian branch of the Germanic family.[tpl]harvnb|Arlotto|1971|p=108[/tpl]. After the Norman conquest, the Old English language was displaced and confined to the lower social classes as Norman French and Latin were used by the aristocracy.
By the 15th century, English came back into fashion among all classes, though much changed; the Middle English form showed many signs of French influence, both in vocabulary and spelling. During the English Renaissance, many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins.[tpl]harvnb|Green|2003|p=13[/tpl]. Modern English has extended this custom of flexibility, when it comes to incorporating words from different languages. Thanks in large part to the British Empire, the English language is the world's unofficial lingua franca.[tpl]cite news |title=English: Not America's Language? |url=http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=3229 | first = Mauro E. | last = Mujica | date = 19 June 2003 | location = Washington DC |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080117232711/http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=3229 |archivedate=17 January 2008 |work=The Globalist |accessdate=1 February 2009[/tpl]
English language learning and teaching is an important economic activity, and includes language schooling, tourism spending, and publishing.

===Religion===

According to the 2011 census, 59.4% of the population is Christian, 24.7% non-religious, 5% is Muslim while 3.7% of the population belongs to other religions and 7.2 did not give an answer.[tpl]cite web|title=Religion (2001 Census)|url=http://data.gov.uk/dataset/religion_2001_census|publisher=data.gov.uk|accessdate=17 December 2012[/tpl] Christianity is the most widely practised religion in England, as it has been since the Early Middle Ages, although it was first introduced much earlier, in Gaelic and Roman times. It continued through Early Insular Christianity. The largest form practised in the present day is Anglicanism,[tpl]cite web |title=Church of England|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/cofe/cofe_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 December 2010[/tpl] dating from the 16th-century Reformation period, with the 1536 split from Rome over Henry VIII wanting to divorce Catherine of Aragon, and the need for the Bible in the English tongue.  The religion regards itself as both Catholic and Reformed.
There are High Church and Low Church traditions, and some Anglicans regard themselves as Anglo-Catholics, after the Tractarian movement. The monarch of the United Kingdom is a titular leader of the Church, acting as its Supreme Governor. It has the status of established church in England. There are around 26 million nominal adherents to the Church of England (of whom the vast majority are not regular churchgoers) and they form part of the Anglican Communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury acting as the symbolic worldwide head.[tpl]cite web |title=Global Anglicanism at a Crossroads|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/896/global-anglicanism-at-a-crossroads|publisher=PewResearch.org|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] Many cathedrals and parish churches are historic buildings of significant architectural importance, such as Westminster Abbey, York Minster, Durham Cathedral and Salisbury Cathedral.
The second largest Christian practice is the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, which traces its formal, corporate history in England to the 6th century with Augustine's mission and was the main religion on the entire island for around a thousand years. Since its reintroduction after the Catholic Emancipation, the Church has organised ecclesiastically on an England and Wales basis where there are 4.5 million members (most of whom are English).[tpl]cite news |title=People here 'must obey the laws of the land'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1578212/People-here-must-obey-the-laws-of-the-land.html|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London|accessdate=5 September 2009 | date=9 February 2008[/tpl] There has been one Pope from England to date, Adrian IV; while saints Bede and Anselm are regarded as Doctors of the Church.
A form of Protestantism  known as Methodism is the third largest Christian practice and grew out of Anglicanism through John Wesley.[tpl]cite web |title=The Methodist Church|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/methodist_1.shtml|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] It gained popularity in the mill towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire, and amongst tin miners in Cornwall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linguae-celticae.org/dateien/Independent_Study_on_Cornish_Language.pdf|title=AN INDEPENDENT ACADEMIC STUDY ON CORNISH|page= 8|accessdate=26 December 2010[/tpl] There are other non-conformist minorities, such as Baptists, Quakers, Congregationalists, Unitarians and The Salvation Army.[tpl]cite web |title=Cambridge History of Christianity|url=http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521815000&ss=exc|publisher=Hugh McLeod|accessdate=5 September 2009 [/tpl]
The patron saint of England is Saint George; his symbolic cross is included in the flag of England, as well as in the Union Flag as part of a combination.[tpl]cite web |title=United Kingdom – History of the Flag|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/gb-hist.html|publisher=FlagSpot.net|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] There are many other English and associated saints; some of the best-known are: Cuthbert, Edmund, Alban, Wilfrid, Aidan, Edward the Confessor, John Fisher, Thomas More, Petroc, Piran, Margaret Clitherow and Thomas Becket. There are non-Christian religions practised. Jews have a history of a small minority on the island since 1070.[tpl]cite web |title=From Expulsion (1290) to Readmission (1656): Jews and England|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/350th-anniversary.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Goldsmiths.ac.uk |accessdate=1 February 2009[/tpl] They were expelled from England in 1290 following the Edict of Expulsion, only to be allowed back in 1656.
Especially since the 1950s, religions from the former British colonies have grown in numbers, due to immigration. Islam is the most common of these, now accounting for around 5% of the population in England.[tpl]cite web |title=Religion|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=8301|publisher=Statistics.gov.uk|accessdate=5 September 2009|author=Office for National Statistics|authorlink=Office for National Statistics[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism are next in number, adding up to 2.8% combined, introduced from India and South East Asia.

==Education==

The Department for Education is the government department responsible for issues affecting people in England up to the age of 19, including education.[tpl]harvnb|Gearon|2002|p=246[/tpl]. State-run and -funded schools are attended by approximately 93% of English schoolchildren.[tpl]harvnb|West|2003|p=28[/tpl]. Of these, a minority are faith schools, primarily Church of England or Catholic. Between three and four is nursery school, 4 and 11 is primary school, and 11 to 16 is secondary school. After finishing compulsory education, pupils take a GCSE examination, following which they may decide to continue in further education for two years. Further education colleges, such as sixth form colleges are either separate or attached to the secondary school institution and prepare students to sit A-Level examinations, for higher education at universities.
Although most English secondary schools are comprehensive, in some areas there are selective intake grammar schools, to which entrance is subject to passing the eleven plus exam. Around 7.2% of English schoolchildren attend private schools, which are funded by private sources.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |title=Independent Schools in the United Kingdom|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580406/independent_schools_in_the_united_kingdom.html|publisher=encarta.msn.com|work=Encarta|accessdate=17 September 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwbmg0Pk|archivedate=31 October 2009|deadurl=yes |ref=harv[/tpl] Standards in state schools are monitored by the Office for Standards in Education, and in private schools by the Independent Schools Inspectorate.[tpl]harvnb|Gearon|2002|p=102[/tpl].
Students normally enter universities in the United Kingdom from 18 onwards, where they study for an academic degree. There are over 90 universities in England, all but one of which are public. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is the government department responsible for higher education in England.[tpl]cite web |title=Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee Contents |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmdius/170/17004.htm|publisher=publications.parliament.uk|accessdate=16 September 2009|authorlink=Parliament of the United Kingdom|author=United Kingdom Parliament[/tpl] Students are generally entitled to student loans for maintenance.[tpl]#tag:ref|Students attending English universities now have to pay tuition fees towards the cost of their education, as do English students who choose to attend university in Scotland. Scottish students attending Scottish universities have their fees paid by the devolved Scottish Parliament.|group=nb[/tpl] The first degree offered to undergraduates is the Bachelor's degree, which usually takes three years to complete. Students are then eligible for a postgraduate degree, a Master's degree, taking one year, or a Doctorate degree, which takes three.
England's universities include some of the highest-ranked universities in the world; the University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, the University of Oxford and University College London are all ranked in the global top 10 in the 2010 QS World University Rankings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2010/results|title=QS World University Rankings Results 2010|accessdate=23 January 2011|publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds Limited[/tpl] The London School of Economics has been described as the world's leading social science institution for both teaching and research.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/sunday_times_university_guide/article2496158.ece |title=The Sunday Times Good University Guide 2007 – Profile for London School of Economics|work=The Times  |location=London|accessdate=6 June 2008 | date=23 September 2007 |ref=harv |first=Ben |last=Hoyle[/tpl] The London Business School is considered one of the world's leading business schools and in 2010 its MBA programme was ranked best in the world by the Financial Times.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/global-mba-rankings| title= FT Global MBA Rankings |work=Financial Times |accessdate=25 January 2010[/tpl] Academic degrees in England are usually split into classes: first class (I), upper second class (II:1), lower second class (II:2) and third (III), and unclassified (below third class).
The King's School, Canterbury and King's School, Rochester are the oldest schools in the English-speaking world.[tpl]harvnb|Webster|1937|p=383[/tpl]. Many of England's better-known schools, such as Winchester College, Eton College, St Paul's School, Rugby School, and Harrow School are fee-paying institutions.[tpl]harvnb|Lowe|1971|p=317[/tpl].

==Culture==

===Architecture===

Many ancient standing stone monuments were erected during the prehistoric period, amongst the best-known are Stonehenge, Devil's Arrows, Rudston Monolith and Castlerigg.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.stone-circles.org.uk/stone/index.htm|publisher=Stone-Circles.org.uk|title=The Prehistoric Sites of Great Britain|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] With the introduction of Ancient Roman architecture there was a development of basilicas, baths, amphitheaters, triumphal arches, villas, Roman temples, Roman roads, Roman forts, stockades and aqueducts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.castles.me.uk/ancient-roman-architecture-england-wales.htm|publisher=Castles.me.uk|title=Ancient Roman architecture in England and Wales|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] It was the Romans who founded the first cities and towns such as London, Bath, York, Chester and St Albans. Perhaps the best-known example is Hadrian's Wall stretching right across northern England. Another well preserved example is the Roman Baths at Bath, Somerset.
Early Medieval architecture's secular buildings were simple constructions mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from a synthesis of Hiberno—Saxon monasticism,[tpl]harvnb|Colgrave|1985|p=326[/tpl].[tpl]harvnb|Pevsner|1942|p=14[/tpl]. to Early Christian basilica and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various Castles in England were created so law lords could uphold their authority and in the north to protect from invasion. Some of the best-known medieval castles are the Tower of London, Warwick Castle, Durham Castle and Windsor Castle.
Throughout the Plantagenet era an English Gothic architecture flourished—the medieval cathedrals such as Canterbury Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and York Minster are prime examples.[tpl]harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=189[/tpl]. Expanding on the Norman base there was also castles, palaces, great houses, universities and parish churches. Medieval architecture was completed with the 16th-century Tudor style; the four-centred arch, now known as the Tudor arch, was a defining feature as were wattle and daub houses domestically. In the aftermath of the Renaissance a form of architecture echoing classical antiquity, synthesised with Christianity appeared—the English Baroque style, architect Christopher Wren was particularly championed.[tpl]harvnb|Downes|2007|p=17[/tpl].
Georgian architecture followed in a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the Royal Crescent at Bath is one of the best examples of this. With the emergence of romanticism during Victorian period, a Gothic Revival was launched—in addition to this around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as The Crystal Palace. Since the 1930s various modernist forms have appeared whose reception is often controversial, though traditionalist resistance movements continue with support in influential places.[tpl]#tag:ref|While people such as Norman Foster and Richard Rogers represent the modernist movement, Prince Charles since the 1980s has voiced strong views against it in favour of traditional architecture and put his ideas into practice at his Poundbury development in Dorset.[tpl]cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8045027.stm|publisher=BBC News| title=Architects to hear Prince appeal | date=12 May 2009| accessdate=20 June 2009[/tpl] Architects like Raymond Erith, Francis Johnson and Quinlan Terry continued to practice in the classical style.|group=nb[/tpl]

===Folklore===

English folklore developed over many centuries. Some of the characters and stories are present across England, but most belong to specific regions. Common folkloric beings include pixies, giants, elves, bogeymen, trolls, goblins and dwarves. While many legends and folk-customs are thought to be ancient, for instance the tales featuring Offa of Angel and Wayland the Smith,[tpl]harvnb|Keary|1882|p=50[/tpl]. others date from after the Norman invasion; Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood and their battles with the Sheriff of Nottingham being, perhaps, the best known.[tpl]harvnb|Pollard|2004|p=272[/tpl].
During the High Middle Ages tales originating from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore—the Arthurian myth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/arthur_03.shtml |title=King Arthur, 'Once and Future King' |author=Michael Wood|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=16 September 2009[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Higham|2002|p=25[/tpl].[tpl]harvnb|Koch|2006|p=732[/tpl]. These were derived from Anglo-Norman, French and Welsh sources, featuring King Arthur, Camelot, Excalibur, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table such as Lancelot. These stories are most centrally brought together within Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae.[tpl]#tag:ref|These tales may have come to prominence, at least in part, as an attempt by the Norman ruling elite to legitimise their rule of the British Isles, finding Anglo-Saxon history ill-suited to the task during an era when members of the deposed House of Wessex, especially Edgar the Ætheling and his nephews of the Scottish House of Dunkeld, were still active in the isles.[tpl]harvnb|Lacy|1986|p=649[/tpl]. Also Michael Wood explains; "Over the centuries the figure of Arthur became a symbol of British history—a way of explaining the matter of Britain, the relationship between the Saxons and the Celts, and a way of exorcising ghosts and healing the wounds of the past."|group=nb[/tpl] Another early figure from British tradition, King Cole, may have been based on a real figure from Sub-Roman Britain. Many of the tales and pseudo-histories make up part of the wider Matter of Britain, a collection of shared British folklore.
Some folk figures are based on semi or actual historical people whose story has been passed down centuries; Lady Godiva for instance was said to have ridden naked on horseback through Coventry, Hereward the Wake was a heroic English figure resisting the Norman invasion, Herne the Hunter is an equestrian ghost associated with Windsor Forest and Great Park and Mother Shipton is the archetypal witch.[tpl]harvnb|Briggs|2004|p=26[/tpl]. On 5 November people make bonfires, set off fireworks and eat toffee apples in commemoration of the foiling of the Gunpowder Plot centred around Guy Fawkes. The chivalrous bandit, such as Dick Turpin, is a recurring character, while Blackbeard is the archetypal pirate. There are various national and regional folk activities, participated in to this day, such as Morris dancing, Maypole dancing, Rapper sword in the North East, Long Sword dance in Yorkshire, Mummers Plays, bottle-kicking in Leicestershire, and cheese-rolling at Cooper's Hill.[tpl]harvnb|Withington|2008|p=224[/tpl]. There is no official national costume, but a few are well established such as the Pearly Kings and Queens associated with cockneys, the Royal Guard, the Morris costume and Beefeaters.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/questions/costume.html|publisher=Woodlands-Junior.kent.sch.uk|title=What is England's national costume?|accessdate=09-06-24[/tpl]

===Cuisine===

Since the Early Modern Period the food of England has historically been characterised by its simplicity of approach and a reliance on the high quality of natural produce.[tpl]harvnb|Else|2007|p=76[/tpl]. During the Middle Ages and through the Renaissance period, English cuisine enjoyed an excellent reputation, though a decline began during the Industrial Revolution with the move away from the land and increasing urbanisation of the populace. The cuisine of England has, however, recently undergone a revival, which has been recognised by the food critics with some good ratings in Restaurant's best restaurant in the world charts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theworlds50best.com/module/acms_winners?group_id=1|publisher=TheWorlds50Best.com|title=The S.Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants|accessdate=5 September 2009|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20100113043907/http://www.theworlds50best.com/module/acms_winners?group_id=1|archivedate=13 January 2010[/tpl] An early book of English recipes is the ''Forme of Cury'' from the royal court of Richard II.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3061656/King-Richard-IIs-recipe-book-to-go-online.html|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London|title=King Richard II's recipe book to go online|accessdate=5 September 2009 | first=Nicole | last=Mart | date=22 September 2008[/tpl]
Traditional examples of English food include the Sunday roast, featuring a roasted joint (usually beef, lamb, chicken or pork) served with assorted vegetables, Yorkshire pudding, and gravy. Other prominent meals include fish and chips and the full English breakfast (generally consisting of bacon, sausages, grilled tomatoes, fried bread, black pudding, baked beans, mushrooms, and eggs). Various meat pies are consumed such as steak and kidney pie, steak and ale pie, cottage pie, pork pie (the latter usually eaten cold)[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.travelsignposts.com/England/traditional-English-food-specialities.php|publisher=TravelSignPosts.com|title=Traditional English Food Specialities|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] and the Cornish Pasty.
Sausages are commonly eaten, either as bangers and mash or toad in the hole. Lancashire hotpot is a well known stew in the northwest. Some of the more popular cheeses are Cheddar, Red Leicester and Wensleydale together with Blue Stilton. Many Anglo-Indian hybrid dishes, curries, have been created such as chicken tikka masala and balti. Traditional English dessert dishes include apple pie or other fruit pies; spotted dick - all generally served with custard; and, more recently, sticky toffee pudding. Sweet pastries include scones (either plain or containing dried fruit) served with jam and/or cream, dried fruit loaves, Eccles cakes and mince pies as well as a wide range of sweet or spiced biscuits. Common drinks include tea, whose popularity was increased by Catherine of Braganza,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tea.co.uk/catherine-of-braganza|publisher=Tea.co.uk|title=Catherine of Braganza|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] whilst frequently consumed alcoholic drinks include wines, ciders and English beers, such as bitter, mild, stout, and brown ale.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/the-pint-of-real-ale/features/types-of-beer-finished|publisher=Icons of England|title=Types of Beer|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl]

===Visual arts===

The earliest known examples are the prehistoric rock and cave art pieces, most prominent in North Yorkshire, Northumberland and Cumbria, but also feature further south, for example at Creswell Crags.[tpl]cite web |url= http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-836-1/dissemination/pdf/ERA_Brochure.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=ArchaeologyDataService.ac.uk|title=The Prehistoric Cave Art of England|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] With the arrival of Roman culture in the 1st century, various forms of art utilising statues, busts, glasswork and mosaics were the norm.

Some of these blended Gaelic and Anglian styles, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels and Vespasian Psalter.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0023715.html|publisher=Tiscali.co.uk|title=Early Middle Ages Art|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] Later Gothic art was popular at Winchester and Canterbury, examples survive such as Benedictional of St. Æthelwold and Luttrell Psalter.
The Tudor era saw prominent artists as part of their court, portrait painting which would remain an enduring part of English art, was boosted by German Hans Holbein, natives such as Nicholas Hilliard built on this.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0028010.html|publisher=Tiscali.co.uk|title=English art|accessdate=5 September 2009[/tpl] Under the Stuarts, Continental artists were influential especially the Flemish, examples from the period include—Anthony van Dyck, Peter Lely, Godfrey Kneller and William Dobson. The 18th century was a time of significance with the founding of the Royal Academy, a classicism based on the High Renaissance prevailed—Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds became two of England's most treasured artists.
The Norwich School continued the landscape tradition, while the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood with their vivid and detailed style revived the Early Renaissance style—Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais were leaders. Prominent amongst 20th-century artists was Henry Moore, regarded as the voice of British sculpture, and of British modernism in general.[tpl]cite journal|last=Turner|first=Chris|title=The Bronze Age: Henry Moore and his successors|journal=Tate Magazine|issue=6|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/magazine/issue6/moore.htm|ref=harv[/tpl] Contemporary painters include Lucian Freud, whose work Benefits Supervisor Sleeping in 2008 set a world record for sale value of a painting by a living artist.[tpl]cite news | title = Freud work sets new world record | date = 14 May 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7398949.stm |publisher=BBC News | accessdate =14 May 2008[/tpl]

===Literature, poetry and philosophy===

Early authors such as Bede and Alcuin wrote in Latin.[tpl]harvnb|Warner|1902|p=35[/tpl]. The period of Old English literature provided the epic poem Beowulf and the secular prose of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,[tpl]harvnb|Rogers|2001|p=17[/tpl]. along with Christian writings such as Judith, Cædmon's Hymn and hagiographies. Following the Norman conquest Latin continued amongst the educated classes, as well as an Anglo-Norman literature.
Middle English literature emerged with Geoffrey Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales, along with Gower, the Pearl Poet and Langland. William of Ockham and Roger Bacon, who were Franciscans, were major philosophers of the Middle Ages. Julian of Norwich, who wrote Revelations of Divine Love, was a prominent Christian mystic. With the English Renaissance literature in the Early Modern English style appeared. William Shakespeare, whose works include Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and A Midsummer Night's Dream, remains one of the most championed authors in English literature.[tpl]harvnb|Rogers|2001|p=135[/tpl].
Christopher Marlowe, Edmund Spenser, Philip Sydney, Thomas Kyd, John Donne, and Ben Jonson are other established authors of the Elizabethan age.[tpl]harvnb|Rowse|1971|p=48[/tpl]. Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes wrote on empiricism and materialism, including scientific method and social contract. Filmer wrote on the Divine Right of Kings. Marvell was the best-known poet of the Commonwealth,[tpl]harvnb|Norbrook|2000|p=6[/tpl]. while John Milton authored Paradise Lost during the Restoration.

Some of the most prominent philosophers of the Enlightenment were John Locke, Thomas Paine, Samuel Johnson and Jeremy Bentham. More radical elements were later countered by Edmund Burke who is regarded as the founder of conservatism.[tpl]harvnb|Heywood|2007|p=74[/tpl]. The poet Alexander Pope with his satirical verse became well regarded. The English played a significant role in romanticism: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, John Keats, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, William Blake and William Wordsworth were major figures.[tpl]harvnb|Watson|1985|p=360[/tpl].
In response to the Industrial Revolution, agrarian writers sought a way between liberty and tradition; William Cobbett, G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc were main exponents, while the founder of guild socialism, Arthur Penty, and cooperative movement advocate G. D. H. Cole are somewhat related.[tpl]harvnb|Cole|1947|p=268[/tpl]. Empiricism continued through John Stuart Mill and Bertrand Russell, while Bernard Williams was involved in analytics.
