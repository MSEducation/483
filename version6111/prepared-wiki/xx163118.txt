Pier Luigi Cherubino Loggi, simply Pier (born 15 October 1971), is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a striker.
Over the course of ten seasons he amassed La Liga totals of 227 games and 54 goals in representation of four clubs, namely Tenerife.

==Football career==

Born in Rome, Italy, Pier was raised in Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife, and made his professional debuts with CD Tenerife's first team during the 1990–91 season. In 16 La Liga matches he scored an important goal, in a 1–1 away tie against Real Betis on 6 January 1991, and would be relatively used in the subsequent three campaigns, also appearing in the 1993–94 UEFA Cup.
Pier would develop into a top flight offensive player in 1994–95, with Sporting de Gijón, and in his two seasons at Betis, where he formidably teamed up with former Real Madrid's Alfonso – the pair combined for 60 league goals from 1995 to 1997, finishing fourth in the latter season.
After failing to produce at Real Zaragoza Pier returned to Tenerife, where he achieved a top level promotion, when the team was coached by Rafael Benítez, and also played for six months in CF Extremadura (alongside former Atlético de Madrid great Kiko).
Pier retired in 2007 at nearly 36, after three seasons in the lower leagues. He made his international debut (his only match) for the Spanish national team on 12 October 1994, in an away UEFA Euro 1996 qualifier against Macedonia, coming on as a substitute for Julio Salinas who had scored both goals in a 2–0 victory.
