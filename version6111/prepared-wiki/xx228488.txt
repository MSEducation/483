==The Origin==

===Bhagwan Shree Swaminarayan===

Bhagwan Swaminarayan (April 2, 1781 – 1830) was born to a samvedi Brahmin family in the village of Chhapaiya, Uttar Pradesh, India. His father’s name was Dharmadev and his mother’s name was Bhaktimata. After serving his parents, he left home at the age of 11 to travel over 8,000 miles throughout India on a holy pilgrimage for 7 years, 1 month, and 11 days. During his travels, Ghanshyam was given the name Neelkanth Varni for his fearless acts against nature’s most ferocious animals. He eventually settled in Gujarat.
At age 21, he established Swaminarayan Sampraday, with the blessings of his Guru Sadguru Ramanand Swami. He initiated more than 1500 saints to spread the pious Sampraday. To achieve ultimate redemption he taught the “Swaminarayan” mahamantra.
To preserve the purity in the religion, he devised five basic Codes of Conducts for Haribhakt (Devotee) like not to steal, not to eat meat, not to drink, not to commit adultery, not to follow impurity and for Tyagi (Saints) like, Nishkam (Lust-less), Nirlobh (Greed-less), Nissenh (Attachment-less), Nisswad (Taste-less) and Nirman (Ego-less).
He established beautiful temples at Ahmedabad, Bhuj, Vadtal, Dholera, Junagadh, Gadhpur for Upasana – worshipping God in all His greatness & glory and Bhakti – Devotion. With all these, he gave a small but huge Code of Conducts with only 212 verses, The Shikshapatri. And the nectar of spiritual discourses performed by Bhagwan Swaminarayan, The Vachnamrutam.
Thus, in a short span of 49 years He revived Hinduism, glorified spiritual values and founded the Swaminarayan Faith and left for His Divine Abode, Akshardham.

===The Swaminarayan Sampraday===

The Swaminarayan Sampraday was established by Bhagwan Swaminarayan in early 18th Century. Founded on the pillars of practical spirituality, it reaches out far and wide to clear the confusions and questions that crowd the moral, social and material world of today.
Its strength lies in the purity of its nature and purpose. The Sect strives to better the world by consolidating character in societies, families and individuals. This is done not just by mottos and slogans but by mass motivation and individual attention, through elevating projects for all, irrespective of class, creed, color and country.
The Sect’s global network comprises Mandirs, Children’s forums, Youth forums, Women’s forum and character-building centers are perennial sources of moral, social, cultural and spiritual activities.
Such moral purity and spiritual surety add a deeper brilliance to all the hundreds of social services performed for Better Life through its 6 basic organs, namely Deity, Mandir, Aacharya, Scripture, Saint and Disciple.

==The Founder==

===Shastriji Maharaj Shri Dharmajivandasji Swami===

Shastriji Maharaj Shri Dharmajivandasji Swami was born on the auspicious Rathayatra day, Ashadh Sud 2, V.S. 1957, dated 18-06-1901, Tuesday in a holy family, in Taravada village, of Amreli District of Gujarat State, to a humble farmer named Bhurabhai Lakhani and mother named Virubai. He was named as Arajan. He was very brilliant and studious. He had natural inclination for spiritual learning and reading of religious scriptures.
He was a great successor of Gunatit tradition, a reformer of spiritual activities and Saint-Life. To assist this anarchic modern age and the immoral lives of this world, he pioneered Gurukul Tradition for the first ever time all over, in 1948 A.D.

===Simple and Pious Life===

Shri Dharmajivandasji Swami led a very simple life of devotion, compassion, spiritual inquiry and strong righteous principles. This lifestyle had a major influence on his disciples as well. He led a very pious life of penance. He was able to sing more than 750 Keertans, recite 3000 slokas, and memorized all the 18 chapters of Bhagavad Gita in 18 days. He always emphasized the path of Bhakti and Dharma. Social welfare activities and betterment of the society were the pillars of his mission. He practiced a vow called Ayachak Vrat i.e., never to ask anyone for any money as donation. He had firm faith in God and believed that all the benevolent activities of the Gurukul should run only with the voluntary donations of the people inspired by the Almighty. This principle is still practiced as a vow by this Gurukul in all its activities. But his indomitable will power and staunch belief in the power of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, brought him success in all his endeavors. Success for him was nothing other than the betterment of the society. Success for him was not a destination, but journey. In fact, his life became the source of inspiration to so many saints of the sect, that they too started creating huge institutions for education and social welfare activities.
His Himalayan vision, which transformed the lives of thousands of people, still continues and will continue forever through his disciples, who with the same missionary spirit and zeal, are striving hard for the betterment of the whole world.
