==Examples of application of the de minimis rule==

In criminology, the de minimis or minimalist approach is an addition to a general harm principle. The general harm principle fails to consider the possibility of other sanctions to prevent harm, and the effectiveness of criminalization as a chosen option. Those other sanctions include civil courts, laws of tort and regulation. Having criminal remedies in place is seen as a "last resort" since such actions often infringe personal liberties – incarceration, for example, prevents the freedom of movement. In this sense, law making that places a greater emphasis on human rights, such as the European Convention on Human Rights fall into the de minimis category. Most crimes of direct actions (murder, rape, assault, for example) are generally not affected by such a stance, but it does require greater justification in less clear cases.[tpl]Cite book |title=Principles of Criminal Law |edition=3 |first=Andrew |last=Ashworth |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-876557-6 |page=33[/tpl]

Under U.S. tax rules, the de minimis rule governs the treatment of small amounts of market discount. Under the rule, if a bond is purchased with a small amount of market discount (an amount less than 0.25% of the face value of a bond times the number of complete years between the bond’s acquisition date and its maturity date) the market discount is considered to be zero. If the market discount is less than the de minimis amount, the discount on the bond is generally treated as a capital gain upon disposition or redemption rather than as ordinary income.SIFMA — Investing in Bonds The de minimis rule Retrieved on 29 July 2007.

In Great Britain following bus deregulation in 1986, small contracts for supplementary local bus services could be let by local authorities without competitive tendering. The Department for Transport's "''Guidance on New De Minimis Rules for Busy
Subsidy Contracts" (2004) notes that "The 1985 Transport Act (as amended by the 2000 Transport Act) introduced the provisions which govern the duties of local passenger transport authorities to secure local bus services where these would not otherwise be met. In the majority of cases these services have to be secured through competitive tender. The Service Subsidy Agreements (Tendering) Regulations provided local authorities with the scope to let any individual bus subsidy contract in any one year up to a certain maximum value without the need to competitively tender (the de minimis limits). There was also a maximum value that de minimis contracts could be let with any one operator in any one year."''
Under European Union competition law, some agreements infringing Article 101(1) of the TFEU (formerly Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty) are considered to be "de minimis" and therefore accepted.

Courts will occasionally not uphold a copyright on modified public domain material if the changes are deemed to be "de minimis".[tpl]Cite doi|10.5033/ifosslr.v2i1.30[/tpl] Similarly, courts have dismissed copyright infringement cases on the grounds that the alleged infringer's use of the copyrighted work (such as sampling) was so insignificant as to be "de minimis". However, in Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films, such a ruling was overturned on appeal, the US appeals court explicitly declining to recognize a de minimis standard for digital sampling.[tpl]cite web|last=Heins|first=Marjorie|title=Trashing the Copyright Balance|url=http://www.fepproject.org/commentaries/bridgeport.html|work=The Free Expression Policy Project|date=2004-09-21[/tpl]
