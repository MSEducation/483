Hvitfeldtska gymnasiet, the "Hvitfeldtska High School" (gymnasium),  is located in Gothenburg, Sweden. The school was founded in 1647 by Queen Kristina. It was originally called "Göteborgs gymnasium" and later known as "Göteborgs högre latinläroverk" before receiving the name after its benefactress, the noblewoman Margareta Hvitfeldt (1608–1683), who left the larger part of her estate to the school. 
The school has approximately 1,800 students, of age 15 through 19. 
Currently, the school attracts students from all over Gothenburg; lower to upper class.  There are some students that come from other regions in Sweden, as well as a small but significant international student population.
Hvitfeldtska offers several of the national Swedish secondary education programmes, including "Naturvetenskapsprogrammet" (natural sciences), "Samhällsvetenskapsprogrammet" (social sciences), "Hvitfeldtskas Affärsprogrammet" (business), "Estetiska Programmet" (music), "Handels- och administrationsprogrammet" (management), and the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IB).
Hvitfeldtska Gymnasiet is known for the events that occurred there during the Gothenburg Riots of the EU summit of 2001.
The school is divided into three buildings; one northern (the main building), one western and one southern.
