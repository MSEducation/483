"WOW" is a series of annual compilation albums featuring contemporary Christian music.  Originally simply called "WOW" immediately followed by the coming year, a change to "WOW Hits" followed by the coming year was made when the "WOW" brand was extended to include the additional collections mentioned below.WOW at Your Music Zone[tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl].  The WOW franchise represents the most successful collections of Christian music ever issued.
Released in late 1995, "WOW 1996" was the first in the WOW series and the first recording put together by the three major Christian record companies of the time: Word Records (now Word Entertainment), Sparrow Records (now part of EMI Christian Music Group), and Reunion Records (now part of Sony's Provident Label Group).  Still today, after each submitting label agrees to a reduced master royalty, the final decision on the tracks to be included is made by committee.  Production, marketing, and distribution for the "WOW Hits" series is handled by EMI Christian Music Group.
Comprising songs submitted by each partner label, the annual "WOW Hits" releases have typically been double CD sets.  Beginning in 2008, however, "WOW" began releasing separate single-disc collections spread throughout each year, rather than a two-disc collection toward the end of each year.  In addition to "WOW Hits," which focuses on the most popular pop and pop-rock music, plans call for edgier single-disc "WOW Rock Hits" and "WOW Pop Hits" collections released twice a year.

In 2008, the WOW series contemplated releasing three single discs per year instead of the annual double discs fans of the series were used to. Only one disc was ever released in the spring of 2008 before reverting to the annual format.  That disc was WOW Hits 1.  It is not known why the publishers decided to return to the annual format instead of the three-disc format, which was inspired by the Now That's What I Call Music! series, which releases 3 discs annually.
