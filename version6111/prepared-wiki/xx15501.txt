The hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), or hippo, from the ancient Greek for "river horse" ([tpl]lang|grc|ἱπποπόταμος[/tpl]), is a large, mostly herbivorous mammal in sub-Saharan Africa, and one of only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae (the other is the pygmy hippopotamus). After the elephant and rhinoceros, the hippopotamus is the third-largest type of land mammal and the heaviest extant artiodactyl. Despite their physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial even-toed ungulates, their closest living relatives are cetaceans (whales, porpoises, etc.) from which they diverged about [tpl]Mya|55|million years ago[/tpl]. The common ancestor of whales and hippos split from other even-toed ungulates around [tpl]Mya|60|million years ago[/tpl]. The earliest known hippopotamus fossils, belonging to the genus Kenyapotamus in Africa, date to around [tpl]Mya|16|million years ago[/tpl].
Hippos are recognizable by their barrel-shaped torsos, enormous mouths and teeth, nearly hairless bodies, stubby legs and tremendous size. They are the third-largest type of land mammal by weight (between 1½ and 3 tonnes): the only heavier species on average are the white and Indian rhinoceroses, typically 1½ to 3½ tonnes, and the elephants, typically weighing 3 to 9 tonnes. The hippopotamus is one of the largest quadrupeds and, despite its stocky shape and short legs, it can easily outrun a human. Hippos have been clocked at [tpl]convert|30|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] over short distances. The hippopotamus is one of the most aggressive creatures in the world and, as such, ranks among the most dangerous animals in Africa.  Nevertheless, they are still threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory canine teeth.
The hippopotamus is semiaquatic, inhabiting rivers, lakes and mangrove swamps, where territorial bulls preside over a stretch of river and groups of five to 30 females and young. During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippopotamuses rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not territorial on land.

==Etymology==

The word "hippopotamus" is derived from the ancient Greek [tpl]lang|grc|ἱπποπόταμος[/tpl], hippopotamos, from [tpl]lang|grc|ἵππος[/tpl], hippos, "horse", and [tpl]lang|grc|ποταμός[/tpl], potamos, "river", meaning "horse of the river".[tpl]LSJ|i(ppopo/tamos|ἱπποπόταμος[/tpl], [tpl]LSJ|i(/ppos|ἵππος[/tpl], [tpl]LSJ|potamo/s|ποταμός|ref[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hippopotamus|title=Hippopotamus|publisher=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary|accessdate=2007-07-18[/tpl][tpl]OEtymD|hippopotamus[/tpl] In English, the plural is hippopotamuses, but "hippopotami" is also used;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutgrammar/plurals?view=uk|title=Plural of hippopotamus|publisher=OED|accessdate=2007-07-18[/tpl] "hippos" can be used as a short plural. Hippopotamuses are gregarious, living in groups of up to 30 animals. A group is called a pod, herd, dale, or bloat.
In Africa, the hippo is known by various names, including seekoei (Afrikaans), mvuvu (Venda), kubu (Lozi) and mvubu (Xhosa, Siswati and Zulu) in the south;[tpl]cite book|author=Walker, C.|year=1997|title=Signs of the Wild|publisher=Struik|page=140|isbn=1-86825-896-3[/tpl] kiboko (Swahili), ensherre (Nkore), tomondo (Turu), nvubu (Luganda), ifuru (Luhya), emiria (Ateso), magawit (Sebei), kibei (Kalenjin) and olmakau (Maasai) in the Great Lakes region;[tpl]rp|256[/tpl] and ጉማርረ/gumarre (Amharic)[tpl]cite book|last=Kane|first=Thomas Leiper|title=Amharic-English dictionary: H – N., Volume 1|year=1990|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=3-447-02871-8|page=1909|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H6tnix8o0mwC[/tpl] and jeer (Somali) in the Horn.[tpl]cite book|last=Saeed|first=John I.|title=Somali|year=1999|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=90-272-3810-3|page=29|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EqCNXXEcoBgC&pg=PA29[/tpl]

==Taxonomy and origins==

===Classification===

The hippopotamus is the type genus of the family Hippopotamidae. The pygmy hippopotamus belongs to a different genus in Hippopotamidae, either Choeropsis or Hexaprotodon. Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as hippopotamids. Sometimes, the subfamily Hippopotaminae is used. Further, some taxonomists group hippopotamuses and anthracotheres in the superfamily Anthracotheroidea.[tpl]rp|39[/tpl] Hippopotamidae are classified along with other even-toed ungulates in the order Artiodactyla. Other artiodactyls include camels, cattle, deer and pigs, although hippopotamuses are not closely related to these groups.
Five subspecies of hippos have been described based on morphological differences in their skulls and geographical differences:[tpl]rp|3[/tpl]
The suggested subspecies were never widely used or validated by field biologists; the described morphological differences were small enough that they could have resulted from simple variation in nonrepresentative samples.[tpl]cite book |last=Eltringham |first=S.K. |title= The Hippos|year=1999 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-85661-131-X |series= Poyser Natural History Series[/tpl][tpl]rp|2[/tpl] Genetic analyses have tested the existence of three of these putative subspecies. A study examining mitochondrial DNA from skin biopsies taken from 13 sampling locations, considered genetic diversity and structure among hippo populations across the continent. The authors found low, but significant, genetic differentiation among H. a. amphibius, H. a. capensis, and H. a. kiboko. Neither H. a. tschadensis nor H. a. constrictus has been tested.[tpl]Cite journal|author = Okello, J.B.A, Nyakaana, S., Masembe, C., Siegismund, H.R. an Arctander, P.|year = 2005|title = Mitochondrial DNA variation of the common hippopotamus: evidence for a recent population expansion.|journal = Heredity|pmid = 16030528|volume = 95|issue = 3|pages = 206–215|doi = 10.1038/sj.hdy.6800711[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|title = Suiform Soundings: The IUCN/SSC Pigs, Peccaries, and Hippos Specialist Group (PPHSG) Newsletter|volume = 5|issue = 1|date=September 2005|url = http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/sgs/pphsg/Suiform%20soundings/Newsletter%205(1).pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080308192646/http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/sgs/pphsg/Suiform+soundings/Newsletter+5%281%29.pdf |archivedate=2008-03-08|work = IUCN|author = Meijaard, Erik (ed.)[/tpl]

===Evolution===

Until 1909, naturalists grouped hippos with pigs, based on molar patterns. Several lines of evidence, first from blood proteins, then from molecular systematics and DNA

The most recent theory of the origins of Hippopotamidae suggests that hippos and whales shared a common semiaquatic ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls around [tpl]mya|60|million years ago[/tpl]. This hypothesized ancestral group likely split into two branches around [tpl]mya|54|million years ago[/tpl].[tpl]Cite journal|title = Analyses of mitochondrial genomes strongly support a hippopotamus-whale clade|volume = 265|issue = 1412|year = 1998|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society|pmid = 9881471|author = Ursing, B.M., Arnason U.|pmc = 1689531|doi = 10.1098/rspb.1998.0567|pages = 2251–5[/tpl] One branch would evolve into cetaceans, possibly beginning about [tpl]mya|52|million years ago[/tpl], with the protowhale Pakicetus and other early whale ancestors collectively known as Archaeoceti, which eventually underwent aquatic adaptation into the completely aquatic cetaceans. The other branch became the anthracotheres, a large family of four-legged beasts, the earliest of which in the late Eocene would have resembled skinny hippopotamuses with comparatively small and narrow heads. All branches of the anthracotheres, except that which evolved into Hippopotamidae, became extinct during the Pliocene without leaving any descendants.
A rough evolutionary lineage can be traced from Eocene and Oligocene species: Anthracotherium and Elomeryx to the Miocene species Merycopotamus and Libycosaurus and the very latest anthracotheres in the Pliocene.[tpl]cite journal|last= Boisserie|first=Jean-Renaud|coauthors=Fabrice Lihoreau and Michel Brunet |year=2005 |title=Origins of Hippopotamidae (Mammalia, Cetartiodactyla): towards resolution |journal=Zoologica Scripta |volume= 34|issue= 2|pages=119–143|doi = 10.1111/j.1463-6409.2005.00183.x[/tpl] Merycopotamus, Libycosaurus and all hippopotamids can be considered to form a clade, with Libycosaurus being more closely related to hippos. Their common ancestor would have lived in the Miocene, about [tpl]Mya|20|million years ago[/tpl]. Hippopotamids are therefore deeply nested within the family Anthracotheriidae. The Hippopotamidae are believed to have evolved in Africa; the oldest known hippopotamid is the genus Kenyapotamus, which lived in Africa from 16 to [tpl]mya|8|million years ago[/tpl]. While hippopotamid species spread across Asia and Europe, no hippopotamuses have ever been discovered in the Americas, although various anthracothere genera emigrated into North America during the early Oligocene. From 7.5 to [tpl]mya|1.8|million years ago[/tpl], an ancestor to the modern hippopotamus, Archaeopotamus, lived in Africa and the Middle East.[tpl]cite journal |last=Boisserie |first=Jean-Renaud |year=2005 |title=The phylogeny and taxonomy of Hippopotamidae (Mammalia: Artiodactyla): a review based on morphology and cladistic analysis |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume= 143 |pages= 1–26|doi = 10.1111/j.1096-3642.2004.00138.x[/tpl]
While the fossil record of hippos is still poorly understood, the two modern genera, Hippopotamus and Choeropsis (sometimes Hexaprotodon), may have diverged as far back as [tpl]mya|8|million years ago[/tpl]. Taxonomists disagree whether or not the modern pygmy hippopotamus is a member of Hexaprotodon – an apparently paraphyletic genus also embracing many extinct Asian hippopotamuses that is more closely related to Hippopotamus, or Choeropsis – an older and basal genus.

===Extinct species===

Three species of Malagasy hippopotamus became extinct during the Holocene on Madagascar, one of them within the past 1,000 years. The Malagasy hippos were smaller than the modern hippopotamus, likely through the process of insular dwarfism.[tpl]Cite journal|doi = 10.1080/02724634.1989.10011761|author = Stuenes, Solweig|year = 1989|title = Taxonomy, habits and relationships of the sub-fossil Madagascan hippopotamuses Hippopotamus lemerlei and H. madagascariensis|journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume = 9|pages = 241–268|issue = 3[/tpl] Fossil evidence indicates many Malagasy hippos were hunted by humans, a likely factor in their eventual extinction. Isolated members of Malagasy hippopotamus may have survived in remote pockets; in 1976, villagers described a living animal called the kilopilopitsofy, which may have been a Malagasy hippopotamus.[tpl]Cite journal| title = The Kilopilopitsofy, Kidoky, and Bokyboky: Accounts of Strange Animals from Belo-sur-mer, Madagascar, and the Megafaunal "Extinction Window"|journal = American Anthropologist|year = 1998|author = Burney, David A.|jstor=681820|volume = 100|issue = 4|pages = 957–966|coauthors = Ramilisonina| doi = 10.1525/aa.1998.100.4.957[/tpl]
Two species of hippopotamus, the European hippopotamus (H. antiquus) and H. gorgops, ranged throughout continental Europe and the British Isles. Both species became extinct before the last glaciation. Ancestors of European hippos found their way to many islands of the Mediterranean during the Pleistocene.[tpl]cite journal|author=Petronio, C.|year=1995|url=http://www.mountainecology.org/IBEX3/pdf/Art_Capitolo1/note_taxonomy_pleistocene.pdf |title=Note on the taxonomy of Pleistocene hippopotamuses|journal=Ibex|volume=3|pages=53–55[/tpl] Both species were larger than the modern hippopotamus, averaging about 1 m (3.3 feet) longer. The Pleistocene also saw a number of dwarf species evolve on several Mediterranean islands, including Crete (H. creutzburgi), Cyprus (H. minor), Malta (H. melitensis), and Sicily (H. pentlandi). Of these, the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus, survived until the end of the Pleistocene or early Holocene. Evidence from an archaeological site, Aetokremnos, continues to cause debate on whether or not the species was encountered, and was driven to extinction, by man.[tpl]Cite journal|author = Simmons, A.|year = 2000|title = Faunal extinction in an island society: pygmy hippopotamus hunters of Cyprus|journal = Geoarchaeology|volume = 15|issue = 4|pages = 379–381|doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6548(200004)15:43.0.CO;2-E[/tpl]

==Description==

Hippopotamuses are among the largest living mammals; only elephants and some rhinoceroses and whales are heavier. They are considered megafauna, but unlike all other African megafauna, they have adapted for a semiaquatic life in freshwater lakes and rivers.[tpl]rp|3[/tpl] Hippos measure [tpl]convert|3.3|to|5.2|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long, including a tail of about [tpl]convert|56|cm|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length and average about [tpl]convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] tall at the shoulder.[tpl]cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Hippopotamus_amphibius.html#physical_description|title = Physical Description|accessdate=2009-05-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-hippopotamus.html|title = Mammals: Hippopotamus|accessdate= 2009-05-08[/tpl] Because of their enormous size, hippopotamuses are difficult to weigh in the wild. Most estimates of the weight come from culling operations that were carried out in the 1960s. The average weights for adult males ranged between [tpl]convert|1500|and|1800|kg|abbr=on[/tpl]. Females are smaller than their male counterparts, with average weights between [tpl]convert|1300|and|1500|kg|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]rp|12[/tpl] Older males can get much larger, reaching at least [tpl]convert|3200|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] with a few exceptional specimens exceeding [tpl]convert|3600|kg|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Hippopotamus_amphibius.html |title=ADW: Hippopotamus amphibius: Information |work=Animal Diversity Web |publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan |accessdate=2008-11-03[/tpl] The heaviest known hippopotamus weighed approximately [tpl]convert|4500|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-hippopotamus.html |title=San Diego Zoo's Animal Bytes: Hippopotamus |publisher=Zoological Society of San Diego |work=SanDiegoZoo.org |date=2009-10-29 |accessdate=2012-08-20[/tpl] Male hippos appear to continue growing throughout their lives; females reach a maximum weight at around age 25.[tpl]Cite journal|author = Marshall, P.J., Sayer, J.A.|title = Population ecology and response to cropping of a hippopotamus population in eastern Zambia|jstor=2401788|volume = 13|issue = 2|year = 1976|journal = The Journal of Applied Ecology|pages = 391–403|doi = 10.2307/2401788[/tpl] The range of hippopotamus sizes overlaps broadly with those recorded for the white rhinoceros.

ISBN 0-8018-5789-9 Compared to a rhinoceros, the hippopotamus has a more elongated body and shorter legs, which result in the hippopotamus having a longer overall length and shorter standing height on average. The Indian rhinoceros also attains weights that can rival those of both hippopotamuses and white rhinoceros, and the three species rank only after elephants in overall body size among extant land animals.[tpl]Cite journal |author = Laurie, W.A. |coauthors = Lang, E.

They are incapable of jumping but do climb up steep banks. Despite being semiaquatic and having webbed feet, an adult hippo is not a particularly good swimmer nor can it float. It is rarely found in deep water; when it is, the animal moves by porpoise-like leaps from the bottom.[tpl]rp|3[/tpl] The testes of the males descend only partially and a scrotum is not present. In addition, the penis retracts into the body when not erect. The genitals of the female are unusual in that the vagina is ridged and two large diverticula protrude from the vulval vestibule.

Unlike most other semiaquatic animals, the hippopotamus has very little hair.[tpl]rp|260[/tpl] The skin is [tpl]convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl] thick, providing it great protection against conspecifics and predators. By contrast, its subcutaneous fat layer is thin.[tpl]rp|3[/tpl] The animals' upper parts are purplish-gray to blue-black, while the under parts and areas around the eyes and ears can be brownish-pink.[tpl]rp|260[/tpl] Their skin secretes a natural sunscreen substance which is red-colored. The secretion is sometimes referred to as "blood sweat", but is neither blood nor sweat. This secretion is initially colorless and turns red-orange within minutes, eventually becoming brown. Two distinct pigments have been identified in the secretions, one red (hipposudoric acid) and one orange (norhipposudoric acid). The two pigments are highly acidic compounds. Both pigments inhibit the growth of disease-causing bacteria; as well, the light absorption of both pigments peaks in the ultraviolet range, creating a sunscreen effect. All hippos, even those with different diets, secrete the pigments, so it does not appear that food is the source of the pigments. Instead, the animals may synthesize the pigments from precursors such as the amino acid tyrosine.[tpl]cite journal|author=Saikawa Y, Hashimoto K, Nakata M, Yoshihara M, Nagai K, Ida M, Komiya T|title=Pigment chemistry: the red sweat of the hippopotamus|journal=Nature|volume=429|issue=6990|year=2004|page=363|pmid=15164051|doi=10.1038/429363a[/tpl] Nevertheless, this natural sunscreen cannot prevent the animal's skin from cracking if it stays out of water too long.[tpl]cite book|author=Jablonski, Nina G.|year=2013|title=Skin: A Natural History|publisher=University of California Press|page=34|isbn=0-520-24281-5[/tpl]

Hippos are still found in the rivers and lakes of the northern Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, north through to Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan, west to Gambia, and south to South Africa. They inhabit both savanna and forest areas.

===Conservation status===

Genetic evidence suggests that common hippos in Africa experienced a marked population expansion during or after the Pleistocene epoch, attributed to an increase in water bodies at the end of the era. These findings have important conservation implications as hippo populations across the continent are currently threatened by loss of access to fresh water. Hippos are also subject to unregulated hunting and poaching. In May 2006, the hippopotamus was identified as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List drawn up by the World Conservation Union (IUCN), with an estimated population of between 125,000 and 150,000 hippos, a decline of between 7% and 20% since the IUCN's 1996 study. Zambia (40,000) and Tanzania (20,000–30,000) possess the largest populations.[tpl]IUCN2008|assessors=Lewison, R. & Oliver, W.

===Invasive potential===

In the late 1980s, Pablo Escobar kept four hippos in a private menagerie at his residence in Hacienda Napoles, 100 km east of Medellín, Colombia, after buying them in New Orleans. They were deemed too difficult to seize and move after Escobar's fall, and hence left on the untended estate. By 2007, the animals had multiplied to 16 and had taken to roaming the area for food in the nearby Magdalena River.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-hippos20dec20,0,5373140.story |title=A hippo critical situation |accessdate=2008-03-27 |author=Kraul C. |date=December 20, 2006 |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=[/tpl] In 2009, two adults and one calf escaped the herd and, after attacking humans and killing cattle, one of the adults (called "Pepe") was killed by hunters under authorization of the local authorities.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8145676.stm|title = Colombia kills drug baron hippo|publisher = BBC News|accessdate=2009-07-11|date=2009-07-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/antioquia/crece-controversia-en-el-pais-por-decision-de-cazar-a-hipopotamos-de-pablo-escobar_5613067-1|title = Crece controversia en el país por decisión de cazar a hipopótamos de Pablo Escobar |publisher = El Tiempo|accessdate=2009-07-11[/tpl] As of early 2014, 40 hippos have been reported to exist in Puerto Triunfo, Antioquia from the original 4 Escobar had.http://www.elespectador.com/opinion/editorial/hipopotamos-bravos-articulo-487824

==Behavior==

With the exception of eating, most of hippopotamuses' lives – from childbirth, fighting with other hippos, to reproduction – occurs in the water. Hippos leave the water at dusk and travel inland, sometimes up to [tpl]convert|10|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl], to graze on short grasses, their main source of food. They spend four to five hours grazing and can consume [tpl]convert|68|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] of grass each night.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.krugerpark.co.za/africa-hippopotamus.html|title = Hippopotamus|accessdate = 2007-06-18|work = Kruger National Park[/tpl] Like almost any herbivore, they consume other plants if presented with them, but their diets in nature consists almost entirely of grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants. Hippos are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mothers feces to digest vegetation.  [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/adaptations/Coprophagia |title=BBC Nature — Dung eater videos, news and facts |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2011-11-27[/tpl]  https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Coprophagia.html  Hippos have (rarely) been filmed eating carrion, usually close to the water. There are other reports of meat-eating, and even cannibalism and predation.[tpl]Cite journal|title = Reports of carnivory by the common hippo Hippopotamus Amphibius|author = Dudley, J.P. |journal = South African Journal of Wildlife Research|volume = 28|issue = 2|pages = 58–59 |url=http://search.sabinet.co.za/WebZ/images/ejour/wild/wild_v28_n2_a4.pdf?sessionid=0&format=F[/tpl] The stomach anatomy of a hippo is not suited to carnivory, and meat-eating is likely caused by aberrant behavior or nutritional stress.[tpl]rp|84[/tpl]
Hippo defecation creates allochthonous deposits of organic matter along the river beds. These deposits have an unclear ecological function.[tpl]Cite journal|title = Using Stable Isotope Analyses To Identify Allochthonous Inputs to Lake Naivasha Mediated Via the Hippopotamus Gut| author = Grey, J., Harper, D.M.|journal = Isotopes in Environmental Health Studies|volume = 38|issue = 4|year = 2002|pages = 245–250|doi = 10.1080/10256010208033269| pmid = 12725427| last2 = Harper[/tpl] Because of their size and their habit of taking the same paths to feed, hippos can have a significant impact on the land across which they walk, both by keeping the land clear of vegetation and depressing the ground. Over prolonged periods, hippos can divert the paths of swamps and channels.[tpl]Cite journal|journal = African Journal of Ecology|volume = 36|issue = 1|pages = 44–56|year = 1998|author = McCarthy, T.S., Ellery, W.

Adult hippos move at speeds up to [tpl]convert|8|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in water; typically resurfacing to breathe every three to five minutes. The young have to breathe every two to three minutes.[tpl]rp|4[/tpl] The process of surfacing and breathing is automatic. A hippo sleeping underwater rises and breathes without waking. A hippo closes its nostrils when it submerges into the water.[tpl]cite web|title=Hippopotamuses|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/critters/hippo.html|publisher=PBS Nature|accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl] As with fish and turtles on a coral reef, hippos occasionally visit cleaning stations and signal, by opening their mouths wide, their readiness for being cleaned of parasites by certain species of fishes. This is an example of mutualism in which the hippo benefits from the cleaning, while the fish receive food.[tpl]cite book|author=Balcombe, Jonathan|year=2006|title=Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=132–33|isbn=1-4039-8602-9[/tpl]

===Social life===

Studying the interaction of male and female hippopotamuses has long been complicated because hippos are not sexually dimorphic; thus females and young males are almost indistinguishable in the field.[tpl]Cite journal|journal = African Zoology Journal|author = Beckwitt, R., Shea, J., Osborne, D., Krueger, S., and Barklow, W.|year = 2002|title = A PCR-based method for sex identification in Hippopotamus amphibius|pages = 127–130 |url=http://www.framingham.edu/~rbeckwitt/hippo2002.pdf[/tpl] Although hippos lie close to each other, they do not seem to form social bonds except between mothers and daughters, and they are not social animals. The reason they huddle close together is unknown.[tpl]rp|49[/tpl]
Hippopotamuses are territorial only in water, where a bull presides over a small stretch of river, on average [tpl]convert|250|m|yards|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, and containing 10 females. The largest pods can contain over 100 hippos.[tpl]rp|50[/tpl] Other bachelors are allowed in a bull's stretch, as long as they behave submissively toward the bull. The territories of hippos exist to establish mating rights. Within the pods, the hippos tend to segregate by gender. Bachelors lounge near other bachelors, females with other females, and the bull on his own. When hippos emerge from the water to graze, they do so individually.[tpl]rp|4[/tpl]
Hippopotamuses appear to communicate vocally, through grunts and bellows, and they may practice echolocation, but the purpose of these vocalizations is currently unknown. Hippos have the unique ability to hold their heads partially above the water and send out a cry that travels through both water and air; individuals respond above and under water.[tpl]Cite journal|title = Low-frequency sounds and amphibious communication in Hippopotamus amphibious|url = http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id=JASMAN000115000005002555000001&idtype=cvips&gifs=yes|journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|author = William E. Barklow|year = 2004|volume = 115|issue = 5|page = 2555|doi=10.1121/1.4783854[/tpl]

===Reproduction===

Female hippos reach sexual maturity at five to six years of age and have a gestation period of eight months. A study of endocrine systems revealed that female hippopotamuses may begin puberty as early as three or four years of age.[tpl]Cite journal|title = Endocrine patterns associated with reproduction in the Nile hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) as assessed by fecal progestagen analysis|journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology|volume=128|issue=1|year=2002|pages=74–81|author=Graham L.H., Reid K.; Webster T.; Richards M.; Joseph S.|doi=10.1016/S0016-6480(02)00066-7|pmid = 12270790[/tpl] Males reach maturity at around 7.5 yr. A study of hippopotamus reproductive behavior in Uganda showed that peak conceptions occurred during the end of the wet season in the summer, and peak births occurred toward the beginning of the wet season in late winter. This is because of the female's estrous cycle; as with most large mammals, male hippopotamus spermatozoa is active year round. Studies of hippos in Zambia and South Africa also showed evidence of births occurring at the start of the wet season.[tpl]rp|60–61[/tpl] After becoming pregnant, a female hippopotamus will typically not begin ovulation again for 17 months.
Mating occurs in the water, with the female submerged for most of the encounter,[tpl]rp|63[/tpl] her head emerging periodically to draw breath. Baby hippos are born underwater at a weight between [tpl]convert|25|and|50|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] and an average length of around [tpl]convert|127|cm|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], and must swim to the surface to take their first breaths. A mother typically gives birth to only one calf, although twins also occur. The young often rest on their mothers' backs when the water is too deep for them, and they swim under water to suckle. They suckle on land when the mother leaves the water. Weaning starts between six and eight months after birth, and most calves are fully weaned after a year.[tpl]rp|64[/tpl] Like many other large mammals, hippos are described as K-strategists, in this case typically producing just one large, well-developed infant every couple of years (rather than many small, poorly developed young several times per year as is common among small mammals such as rodents).[tpl]Cite journal|doi = 10.1080/08927014.1998.9522857|title = Infanticide in the hippopotamus: evidence for polygynous ungulates|author = Lewison, R|journal = Ethology, Ecology & Evolution|volume = 10|issue = 3|pages = 277–286|year = 1998|url = http://www.fupress.net/index.php/eee/article/viewFile/805/751[/tpl]

===Aggression===

Hippopotamuses are by nature very aggressive animals. Hippos involved in attacks on other animals are often either mature bulls, which tend to be very territorial and indiscriminately ill-tempered, or females, which are quite protective of their young calves. Living on the African continent, hippopotamus coexist with a variety of formidable predators.  Nile crocodiles, lions and spotted hyenas are known to prey on young hippos.[tpl]rp|273[/tpl][tpl]rp|118[/tpl] However, due to their ill temperament and great size, adult hippopotamus are not usually subject to predation by other animals, except humans. Cases where very large lion prides or cooperating groups of Nile crocodiles have successfully preyed on adult hippopotamus have been reported, but this is typically believed to be exceptionally rare.Carnivores of the World by Dr. Luke Hunter. Princeton University Press (2011), ISBN 978-0-691-15228-8Crocodiles and Alligators edited by S Charles A. Ross & Stephen Garnett. Checkmark Books (1989), ISBN 978-0-8160-2174-1. Crocodiles are particularly frequent targets of hippo aggression, likely because they often inhabit the same riparian habitats as hippos. Crocodiles may be either aggressively displaced or killed by hippopotamuses. Hippos are also very aggressive towards humans, whom they commonly attack whether in boats or on land with no apparent provocation.[tpl]cite news |url = http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mhippo.html |title = Are hippos the most dangerous animal? |date = 2006-12-06 |accessdate = 2008-08-09[/tpl] They are widely considered to be one of the most dangerous large animals in Africa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.natgeochannel.co.uk/explore/hippoundercover|title=Dangerous Encounters: Undercover Hippo|publisher=National Geographic Channel|accessdate=2008-11-04[/tpl]Hippo Specialist Group, World Conservation Union.

News.nationalgeographic.com (October 28, 2010). Retrieved on 2012-05-12. "Yawning" serves as a threat display. When in combat, male hippos use their incisors to block each other's attacks, and their canines to inflict damage.[tpl]rp|260[/tpl] Hippos rarely kill each other, even in territorial challenges. Usually, a territorial bull and a challenging bachelor stop fighting when it is clear that one hippo is stronger. When hippos become overpopulated, or when a habitat starts to shrink, bulls sometimes attempt to kill infants, but this behavior is not common under normal conditions. Some incidents of hippo cannibalism have been documented, but it is believed to be the behavior of distressed or sick hippos, and not healthy behavior.[tpl]rp|82–83[/tpl]

==Hippos and humans==

The earliest evidence of human interaction with hippos comes from butchery cut marks on hippo bones at Bouri Formation dated around 160,000 years ago.[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1038/nature01670|last1 = Clark|first1 = JD|last2 = Beyene|first2 = Y|last3 = WoldeGabriel|first3 = G|last4 = Hart|first4 = WK|last5 = Renne|first5 = PR|last6 = Gilbert|first6 = H|last7 = Defleur|first7 = A|last8 = Suwa|first8 = G|last9 = Katoh|first9 = S et al.|last10 = Ludwig|first10 = Kenneth R.|last11 = Boisserie|first11 = Jean-Renaud|last12 = Asfaw|first12 = Berhane|last13 = White|first13 = Tim D.|year = 2003|title = Stratigraphic, chronological and behavioural contexts of Pleistocene Homo sapiens from Middle Awash, Ethiopia|journal = Nature|volume = 423|issue = 6941| pages = 747–52|pmid = 12802333|display-authors = 8[/tpl] Later rock paintings and engravings showing hippos being hunted have been found in the mountains of the central Sahara dated 4,000–5,000 years ago near Djanet in the Tassili n'Ajjer Mountains.[tpl]rp|1[/tpl] The ancient Egyptians recognized the hippo as a ferocious denizen of the Nile.

Zulu warriors preferred to be as brave as a hippopotamus, since even lions were not considered to match its courage. "In 1888, Captain Baden-Powell was part of a column searching for the Zulu chief Dinizulu, who was leading the Usutu people in revolt against the British colonists. The column was joined by John Dunn, a white Zulu chief, who led an impi (army) of 2,000 Zulu warriors to join the British." Ingonyama – he is a lion!. Scouting.org.za. Retrieved on 2011-03-29.

===Hippos in zoos===

Hippopotamuses have long been popular zoo animals. The first zoo hippo in modern history was Obaysch, which arrived at the London Zoo on May 25, 1850, where he attracted up to 10,000 visitors a day and inspired a popular song, the "Hippopotamus Polka".[tpl]Cite journal|author = Root, N. J.|title = Victorian England's Hippomania|journal = Natural History|volume = 103|year = 1993|pages = 34–39[/tpl] Hippos have remained popular zoo animals since Obaysch, and generally breed well in captivity. Their birth rates are lower than in the wild, but this is attributed to zoos not wanting to breed as many hippos as possible, since hippos are large and relatively expensive animals to maintain.[tpl]rp|129[/tpl]
Like many zoo animals, hippos were traditionally displayed in concrete exhibits. In the case of hippos, they usually had a pool of water and patch of grass. In the 1980s, zoo designers increasingly designed exhibits that reflected the animals' native habitats. The best known of these, the Toledo Zoo Hippoquarium, features a 360,000 gallon pool for hippos.[tpl]Cite news|title= No rms, jungle vu: a new group of "landscape-immersion" zoo designers are trying to break down visitors' sense of security by reminding them that wild animals really are wild.|work = The Atlantic Monthly|date = December 1987|author = Melissa Greene[/tpl] In 1987, researchers were able to tape, for the first time, an underwater birth (as in the wild) at the Toledo Zoo.

Hippos have been the subjects of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos wanted to live in the water, but were refused out of fear that they might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung so that it can be inspected for fish bones.[tpl]cite book|author=Greaves, N.; Clement, R.|year=2000|title=When Hippo Was Hairy: And Other Tales from Africa|publisher=Struik|pages=67–71|isbn=1-86872-456-5[/tpl] In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool.

Hippos have also been popular cartoon characters, where their rotund frames are used for humorous effect. The Disney film Fantasia featured a ballerina hippopotamus dancing to the opera La Gioconda. Other cartoon hippos have included Hanna-Barbera's Peter Potamus, the book and TV series George and Martha, Flavio and Marita on the Animaniacs, Pat of the French duo Pat et Stanley, The Backyardigan's Tasha, and Gloria and Moto-Moto from the Madagascar franchise.
