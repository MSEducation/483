==Route description==

MD 374 begins at an acute intersection with MD 354 (Powellville Road) in Powellville.  The state highway heads southeast as two-lane Burbage Crossing Road.  MD 374 crosses the Pocomoke River and enters Worcester County, where the highway's name changes to Libertytown Road.  The state highway curves northeast and passes through Libertytown, where the highway intersects Purnell Crossing Road and Ironshire Station Road, then crosses Libertytown Branch.  After passing Bay Club Golf Course, MD 374 enters Berlin, where the name of the highway changes to Broad Street.  The state highway crosses the Snow Hill Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad and enters the Berlin Commercial District.

==History==

The first part of MD 374 to be paved was Broad Street in Berlin in 1925.  The pavement was extended west to around Narrow Branch Road in 1929 and 1930 and to Libertytown by 1933.  A short segment was constructed west of Libertytown in 1937. The section between Powellville and the western end of the existing section of MD 374 near Libertytown was constructed on mostly new alignment between 1952 and 1956.
