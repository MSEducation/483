William Topaz McGonagall (March 1825Campbell, D. (2003). Edinburgh: A cultural and literary history. Cities of the imagination. Oxford: Signal. ISBN 1-902669-73-8. p. 65. – 29 September 1902) was a Scottish weaver, doggerel poet and actor. He won notoriety as an extremely bad poet who exhibited no recognition of, or concern for, his peers' opinions of his work.
He wrote about 200 poems, including his notorious "The Tay Bridge Disaster", which are widely regarded as some of the worst in English literature. Groups throughout Scotland engaged him to make recitations from his work and contemporary descriptions of these performances indicate that many listeners were appreciating McGonagall's skill as a comic music hall character. Collections of his verse remain popular, with several volumes available today.
McGonagall has been acclaimed as the worst poet in British history. The chief criticisms are that he is deaf to poetic metaphor and unable to scan correctly. In the hands of lesser artists, this might generate dull, uninspiring verse. McGonagall's fame stems from the humorous effects these shortcomings generate. The inappropriate rhythms, weak vocabulary, and ill-advised imagery combine to make his work amongst the most unintentionally amusing dramatic poetry in the English language. His work is in a long tradition of narrative ballads and verse written and published about great events and tragedies, and widely circulated among the local population as handbills. In an age before radio and television, their voice was one way of communicating important news to an avid public.

==Early life==

Although McGonagall was born and died in Greyfriars Parish, Edinburgh, he is almost solely linked with Dundee. His parents were Irish.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

==Career==

McGonagall moved north and was apprenticed as a handloom weaver in Dundee, following in his father's footsteps. In 1846, he married Jean King; they had five sons and two daughters. Despite the industrial revolution slowly making weavers obsolete, McGonagall appeared to prosper, as there was still need for skilled workers to perform tasks of great complexity.Hunt, Chris, William McGonagall: Collected Poems, Birlinn, 2006, p. v.
Before he showed an interest in poetry, he displayed a keenness for acting, though Mr Giles' Theatre, where he performed, let him play the title role in Macbeth only if he paid for the privilege. The theatre was filled with his friends and fellow workers, anxious to see what they expected to be an amusing disaster. The play should have ended with Macbeth's death, but McGonagall believed the actor playing Macduff was trying to upstage him, and refused to die.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mcgonagall-online.org.uk/articles/failures.htm |title=McGonagall the Heroic Failure |publisher=McGonagall Online |date=3 April 2007 |accessdate=3 July 2009 [/tpl]
By the 1870s, McGonagall and his family were struggling. Work as a weaver was more difficult to find and his oldest daughter shamed the family by giving birth to an illegitimate child. However, an event changed him. He would write:
McGonagall claimed he was inspired to become a poet when he "seemed to feel a strange kind of feeling stealing over him, and remained so for about five minutes. A flame, as Lord Byron said, seemed to kindle up his entire frame, along with a strong desire to write poetry."Hunt, Chris, William McGonagall: Collected Poems, Birlinn, 2006, px He wrote his first poem, "An Address to the Rev. George Gilfillan", displaying the hallmarks that would characterise his work. Gilfillan, himself an untrained and poorly-reviewed polemic Christian preacher who occasionally dabbled in poetry, commented admiringly "Shakespeare never wrote anything like this."
McGonagall realised if he were to succeed as a poet, he required a patron and wrote to Queen Victoria. He received a letter of rejection, written by a royal functionary, thanking him for his interest.Hunt, Chris, William McGonagall: Collected Poems, Birlinn, 2006, pvii McGonagall took this as praise for his work. During a trip to Dunfermline in 1879, he was mocked by the Chief Templar, who told him his poetry was very bad. McGonagall told the man that "it was so very bad that Her Majesty had thanked McGonagall for what Chief Templar had condemned."Hunt, Chris, William McGonagall: Collected Poems, Birlinn, 2006, p viii
The letter gave McGonagall confidence in his "poetic abilities", and he felt his reputation could be enhanced further if he were to give a live performance before the queen. In July 1878, he walked from Dundee to Balmoral, a distance of about [tpl]convert|60|mi[/tpl] over mountainous terrain and through a violent thunderstorm, "wet to the skin", to perform for Queen Victoria.McGonagall, Wm More Poetic Gems Dundee 1962 When he arrived, he announced himself as "The Queen's Poet". The guards informed him "You're not the Queen's poet! Tennyson is the Queen's poet!" (Alfred Lord Tennyson was the poet laureate). McGonagall presented the letter but was refused entry and had to return home.McGonagall, Wm; Transcript of autobiography from More Poetic Gems Undeterred, his poetry writing continued, and he reported events to the newspapers, earning some minor recognition.Hunt, Chris, William McGonagall: Collected Poems, Birlinn, 2006, p vii
Throughout his life McGonagall campaigned against excessive drinking, appearing in pubs and bars to give edifying poems and speeches. These were popular, the people of Dundee possibly recognising that McGonagall was "so giftedly bad he backed unwittingly into genius"Stephen Pile, The Book of Heroic Failures He met with the ire of the publicans, on one occasion being pelted with peas for reciting a poem about the evils of "strong drink".McGonagall, Wm, William McGonagall: Collected Poems, Birlinn, 2006, p 13-23
In 1883 he celebrated the official opening of University College, Dundee with the poem "The Inauguration of University College Dundee" which opened with the stanza[tpl]cite web|title=From the Archives.

McGonagall constantly struggled with money and earned money by selling his poems in the streets, or reciting them in halls, theatres and public houses. When he was in periods of financial insecurity, his friends supported him with donations. In 1880, he sailed to London to seek his fortune, and in 1887 to New York. In both instances, he returned unsuccessful.
He found lucrative work performing his poetry at a local circus. He read his poems while the crowd was permitted to pelt him with eggs, flour, herrings, potatoes and stale bread. For this, he received fifteen shillings a night. McGonagall seemed happy with this arrangement, but the events became so raucous
that the city magistrates were forced to put a ban on them.Hunt, Chris, William McGonagall: Collected Poems, Birlinn, 2006, p viii – ix McGonagall was outraged and wrote a poem in response entitled "Lines in Protest to the Dundee Magistrates":

Throughout his life McGonagall seemed oblivious to the general opinion of his poems, even when his audience were pelting him with eggs and vegetables. It is possible he was shrewder than he is given credit for, and played to his audience's perception of him.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
In 1890, McGonagall was in dire straits financially. To help him, his friends funded the publication of a collection of his work, Poetic Gems. The proceeds provided McGonagall with enough money to live on for a time.Hunt, Chris, William McGonagall: Collected Poems, Birlinn, 2006, p ix By 1893, he was annoyed by his mistreatment in the streets and wrote an angry poem threatening to leave Dundee. One newspaper quipped that he'd probably stay for another year once he realised "that Dundee rhymes with 1893".Hunt, Chris, William McGonagall: Collected Poems, Birlinn, 2006, p x Though trying his hand at writing prose and endorsements for local businesses for a short time, in 1894, he and his wife were forced to move to Perth.
Soon after, he received a letter purporting to be from representatives of King Thibaw Min of Burma. In it, he was informed that the King had knighted him as Topaz McGonagall, Grand Knight of the Holy Order of the White Elephant Burmah.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mcgonagall-online.org.uk/life/autobiography7 |title=The Autobiography of Sir William Topaz McGonagall – Part 7 |publisher=McGonagall Online |accessdate=2 July 2013[/tpl] Despite the fact that this was a fairly transparent hoax,Hunt, Chris, William McGonagall: Collected Poems, Birlinn, 2006, px McGonagall would refer to himself as "Sir William Topaz McGonagall, Knight of the White Elephant, Burmah" in his advertising for the rest of his life.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
In 1895, McGonagall and his wife moved to Edinburgh. Here, McGonagall met with some success, becoming a "cult figure" and was in great demand. It did not last long, and by 1900 he was once again destitute and now old and sickly. Though he was now too frail to walk the streets selling his poems, donations from friends, as ever, kept him afloat.Hunt, Chris, William McGonagall: Collected Poems, Birlinn, 2006, p xi
He died penniless in 1902 and was buried in an unmarked grave in Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh. A grave-slab installed to his memory in 1999 is inscribed:
Additionally, a plaque above 5 South College Street in Edinburgh shows an image of McGonagall, and bears the inscription:

===Possible Asperger's===

Author Norman Watson speculates in his biography of McGonagall that the poetaster may have been on the "autism-Asperger's spectrum". Christopher Hart, writing in the Sunday Times, says that this seems "likely".Sunday Times, 7 November 2010

==Tay Bridge Disaster==

Of the 200 or so poems that he wrote, the most famous is probably "The Tay Bridge Disaster", which recounts the events of the evening of 28 December 1879, when, during a severe gale, the Tay Rail Bridge near Dundee collapsed as a train was passing over it.
(Modern sources give the death toll as 75.)
Few could disagree with McGonagall's closing judgement: 
McGonagall had previously written a poem in praise of the Tay Bridge: "The Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay" "With your numerous arches and pillars in so grand array". Once the new replacement bridge had been built, without the least feeling of irony, he proceeded to compose an ode to the new construction: "An Address to the New Tay Bridge" "Strong enough all windy storms to defy".

==Honours and memorials==

McGonagall's home city of Dundee maintains several reminders of his life:
He is buried in an unmarked grave in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh. From c.1950 to 1995 a memorial bench stood on the path immediately to the north side of the church commemorating McGonagall and bearing the typically McGonagall-esque inscription "Feeling tired and need a seat? Sit down here, and rest your feet". Unfortunately the bench fell into disrepair and was not replaced. It is not known what became of its small plaque.

==List of poems==

McGonagall's poems were published by his friends, in a series of books bearing variations on the title Poetic Gems.  In the modern era, the entire series is reprinted in a single collection called The Complete McGonagall.  Note that although the Poetic Gems books are listed in chronological order, the time at which the poem was published often has no bearing on when it was written; the "Address to the Rev. George Gilfillan" and "Requisition to the Queen" were amongst McGonagall's earliest written poems, yet they appear in More Poetic Gems and Last Poetic Gems respectively.
