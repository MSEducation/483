Anthony Neil Wedgwood "Tony" Benn (3 April 1925 – 14 March 2014) was a British Labour politician who was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 47 years between 1950 and 2001 and a Cabinet minister under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan in the 1960s and 1970s.
Benn inherited a hereditary peerage on his father's death (as 2nd Viscount Stansgate), preventing him continuing as an MP. He fought to remain in the House of Commons,Re Parliamentary Election for Bristol South East 1964 2 Q.B. 257, 1961 3 W.L.R. 577 and then campaigned for the ability to renounce the title, a campaign which succeeded with the Peerage Act 1963. In the Labour Government of 1964–70 he served first as Postmaster General, where he oversaw the opening of the Post Office Tower, and later as a "technocratic" Minister of Technology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/british-socialist-tony-benn-dead-at-88/story-fndir2ev-1226855433571|title=British socialist Tony Benn dead at 88|work=|publisher=News.com.au|accessdate=18 March 2014[/tpl]
In 1971–72, when the Labour Party was in Opposition, he was Chairman of the Labour Party. In the Labour Government of 1974–1979, he returned to the Cabinet, initially as Secretary of State for Industry, before being made Secretary of State for Energy, retaining his post when James Callaghan replaced Wilson as Prime Minister. When the Labour Party was in Opposition in the 1980s, he was a prominent figure on its left wing and the term "Bennite" came to be used for someone with radical left-wing politics.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/sr205/labour.htm|work=Socialist Review|date=February 1997|title=Does Labour's Left Have an Alternative?|last=Renton|first=Dave|accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl]

==Biography==

===Early life and family===

Benn was born in London on 3 April 1925.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tonybenn.com/Biography.html|title=Tony Benn – Official Website|work=tonybenn.com|accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl] Benn's father William Wedgwood Benn was a Liberal Member of Parliament from 1906 who crossed the floor to the Labour Party in 1928 and was appointed Secretary of State for India by Ramsay MacDonald in 1929, a position he held until 1931. William Benn was elevated to the House of Lords with the title of Viscount Stansgate in 1942 – the new wartime coalition government was short of working Labour peers in the upper house.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30705?docPos=2|title=Benn, William Wedgwood|format=Subscription required|publisher=Oxford University Press|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Online|last1=Hale|first1=Leslie|last2=Potter|first2=Mark| date=January 2008|accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl] From 1945-46, William Benn was the Secretary of State for Air in the first majority Labour Government.
Benn's mother, Margaret Wedgwood Benn (née Holmes, 1897–1991), was a theologian, feminist and the founder President of the Congregational Federation. She was a member of the League of the Church Militant, which was the predecessor of the Movement for the Ordination of Women; in 1925, she was rebuked by Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, for advocating the ordination of women. His mother's theology had a profound influence on Benn, as she taught him that the stories in the Bible were based around the struggle between the prophets and the kings and that he ought in his life to support the prophets over the kings, who had power, as the prophets taught righteousness.[tpl]Cite book|last=Benn|first=Tony|url=http://books.google.com/?id=UsYKitlTrdYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=tony+benn+free+radical&q|title=Free Radical|year=2003|publisher=Continuum|page=226|isbn=0-8264-6596-X[/tpl]

In the Second World War, Benn joined and trained with the Home Guard from age 16, later recalling (2009) in a speech: "I could use a bayonet, a rifle, a revolver, and if I'd seen a German officer having a meal I'd have tossed a grenade through the window.

Benn attended Westminster School and studied at New College, Oxford, where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics and was elected President of the Oxford Union in 1947. In later life, Benn removed public references to his private education from Who's Who; in the 1975 edition his entry stated "Education—still in progress". In the 1976 edition, almost all details were omitted save for his name, jobs as a Member of Parliament and as a Government Minister, and address; the publishers confirmed that Benn had sent back the draft entry with everything else struck through.[tpl]Cite news|title=Mr Benn wipes away his past|work=The Times Diary|publisher=Times Newspapers|date=18 March 1976[/tpl] In the 1977 edition, Benn's entry disappeared entirely.[tpl]Cite news|title=Not Out|work=The Times Diary|publisher=Times newspapers|date=4 April 1977[/tpl] In October 1973 he announced on BBC Radio that he wished to be known as Mr. Tony Benn rather than Anthony Wedgwood Benn, and his book Speeches from 1974 is credited to "Tony Benn".
Benn met Caroline Middleton DeCamp (born 13 October 1926, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States) over tea at Worcester College, Oxford, in 1949 and nine days later he proposed to her on a park bench in the city. Later, he bought the bench from Oxford City Council and installed it in the garden of their home in Holland Park. Tony and Caroline had four children – Stephen, Hilary, Melissa and Joshua, and ten grandchildren. Caroline Benn died of cancer on 22 November 2000, aged 74, after a prominent career as an educationalist.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1375544/Caroline-Benn.html|title=Caroline Benn|work=Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=24 November 2000|accessdate=2 May 2010|location=London, UK[/tpl]
Benn's children have been active in politics. His first son, Stephen, was an elected Member of the Inner London Education Authority from 1986 to 1990. His second son, Hilary, was a councillor in London, and stood for Parliament in 1983 and 1987, becoming the Labour MP for Leeds Central in 1999. He was Secretary of State for International Development from 2003-07, and then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs until 2010. This makes him the third generation of his family to have been a member of the Cabinet, a rare distinction for a modern political family in Britain.

===Member of Parliament===

Following the Second World War Benn worked briefly as a BBC Radio producer. On 1 November 1950, he was unexpectedly selected to succeed Stafford Cripps as the Labour candidate for Bristol South East, after Cripps stood down because of ill-health. He won the seat in a by-election on 30 November 1950.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/366619.stm|title=The Benn dynasty|date=11 June 1999|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl] Anthony Crosland helped him get the seat as he was the MP for nearby South Gloucestershire at the time.

In the 1950s, Benn held middle-of-the-road or soft left views, and was not associated with the young left wing group around Aneurin Bevan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/articles/2008/04/03/tony_benn_profile_feature.shtml|title=Profile: Tony Benn|work=BBC Bristol|publisher=BBC|date=4 April 2008|accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl]

====Peerage reform====

Benn's father had been created Viscount Stansgate in 1942 when Winston Churchill increased the number of Labour peers to aid political work in the House of Lords; at this time, Benn's elder brother Michael was intending to enter the priesthood and had no objections to inheriting a peerage. However, Michael was later killed in an accident while on active service in the Second World War, and this left Benn as the heir to the peerage. He made several unsuccessful attempts to renounce the succession.
In November 1960 Viscount Stansgate died and Benn automatically became a peer and was thus prevented from sitting in the House of Commons. The Speaker of the Commons, Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, did not allow him to deliver a speech from the bar of the House of Commons in April 1961 when the by-election was being called.Tony Benn and Peter Kellner "Tony Benn's Finest Speech", The Huffington Post, 14 March 2014 Continuing to maintain his right to abandon his peerage, Benn fought to retain his seat in a by-election caused by his succession on 4 May 1961. Although he was disqualified from taking his seat, he was re-elected. An election court found that the voters were fully aware that Benn was disqualified, and declared the seat won by the Conservative runner-up, Malcolm St Clair (politician), who was at the time also the heir presumptive to a peerage.
Benn continued his campaign outside Parliament, and eventually the Conservative Government of the time accepted the need for a change in the law.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/82121.stm|title=Disclaiming a peerage|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|location=London |date=14 July 2005 |accessdate=7 June 2008[/tpl] The Peerage Act 1963, allowing renunciation of peerages, became law shortly after 6 pm on 31 July 1963. Benn was the first peer to renounce his title, which he did at 6.22 pm that day.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=43072 |date=2 August 1963 |startpage=6534[/tpl] St Clair, fulfilling a promise he had made at the time of his election, then accepted the office of Steward of the Manor of Northstead, disqualifying himself from the House (outright resignation not being possible). Benn returned to the Commons after winning a by-election on 20 August 1963.

===In government (1964–1970)===

In the 1964 Government of Harold Wilson, Benn was Postmaster General, where he oversaw the opening of the Post Office Tower, then the UK's tallest building, and the creations of the Post Bus service and Girobank. He proposed issuing stamps without the Sovereign's head, but this met with private opposition from the Queen.[tpl]cite web|title=Tony Benn dies: his most memorable quotes|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/10697145/Tony-Benn-dies-his-most-memorable-quotes.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=14 March 2014|date=14 March 2014[/tpl] Instead, the portrait was reduced to a small profile in silhouette, a format that is still used on commemorative stamps.[ref]

Benn also led the government's opposition to the popular offshore radio stations broadcasting from international waters at the time,Asa Briggs The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom: Volume V: Competition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995, p.515-19, 540 Some of these stations were claimed to be causing problems at the time, such as interference to emergency radio used by shipping,"Wireless and Television (Pirate Stations)", Hansard, HC Deb, vol 730 cc858-70, 22 June 1966 although he was not responsible for introducing the Marine Broadcasting Offences Bill when it came before Parliament at the end of July 1966 for its first reading."Marine, & C., Broadxasting (OffencesFFENCES)", HC Deb 27 July 1966, Hansard, vol 732 c1720
Earlier in the month, Benn was promoted to Minister of Technology, which included responsibility for the development of Concorde and the formation of International Computers Ltd (ICL). The period also saw government involvement in industrial rationalisation, and the merger of several car companies to form British Leyland.

Labour lost the 1970 election to Edward Heath's Conservatives, and upon Heath's application to join the European Economic Community, Benn campaigned in favour of a referendum on the UK's membership. The Shadow Cabinet voted to support a referendum on 29 March 1972, and as a result Roy Jenkins resigned as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.[tpl]cite book |last=Butler |first=David |authorlink=David Butler (psephologist) |last2=Kavanagh |first2=Dennis |title=The British General Election of February 1974 |publisher=Macmillan |year=1974 |pages=20 |isbn=0333172973[/tpl]

===In government (1974–1979)===

In the Labour Government of 1974 Benn was Secretary of State for Industry and as such increased nationalised industry pay, provided better terms and conditions for workers such as the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and set up worker cooperatives to motivate and reform struggling industries, the best known being at Meriden, outside Coventry, which kept Triumph Motorcycles in production until 1983. In 1975 he was appointed Secretary of State for Energy, immediately following his unsuccessful campaign for a "No" vote in the referendum on the UK's continued membership of the European Community (Common Market). Later in his diary (25 October 1977) Benn wrote that he "loathed" the EEC; he claimed it was "bureaucratic and centralised" and "of course it is really dominated by Germany. All the Common Market countries except the UK have been occupied by Germany, and they have this mixed feeling of hatred and subservience towards the Germans".[tpl]Cite book|last=Benn|first=Tony|title=The Benn Diaries|publisher=Arrow|year=1995|page=432|isbn= 978-0-09-963411-9[/tpl]
Harold Wilson resigned as Leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister in March 1976. In the resulting leadership contest Benn came in fourth out of the six cabinet ministers who stood — he withdrew as 11.8% of colleagues voted for him in the first ballot. Benn withdrew from the second ballot and supported Michael Foot; James Callaghan eventually won. Despite not receiving his support in the second and third rounds of the vote, Callaghan kept Benn on as Energy Secretary. In 1976 there was a sterling crisis, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey sought a loan from the International Monetary Fund.  Underlining a wish to counter international market forces which seemed to penalise a larger welfare state, Benn publicly circulated the divided Cabinet minutes in which a narrow majority of the Labour Cabinet under Ramsay MacDonald supported a cut in unemployment benefits in order to obtain a loan from American bankers. As he highlighted, these minutes resulted in the 1931 split of the Labour Party in which MacDonald had and his allies formed a National Government with Conservatives and Liberals. Callaghan allowed Benn to put forward his "alternative economic strategy", which consisted of a self sufficient economy less dependent on low-rate fresh borrowing but the AES, which according to opponents, would have led to a "siege economy", was rejected by the Cabinet.[tpl]Cite book|last=Powell|first=David|title=Tony Benn: a political life|publisher=Continuum|location=London & New York|year=2003|edition=2|pages=82, 84|isbn=0-8264-7074-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dYeVIfy0by8C&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82&dq=alternative+economic+strategy+tony+benn&q=alternative%20economic%20strategy%20tony%20benn[/tpl]

====Move to the Left====

By the end of the 1970s, Benn had migrated to the left wing of the Labour Party. He attributed this political shift to his experience as a Cabinet Minister in the 1964–1970 Labour Government. Benn ascribed his move to the left to four lessons: 1) how "the Civil Service can frustrate the policies and decisions of popularly elected governments"; 2) the centralised nature of the Labour Party allowing to the Leader to run "the Party almost as if it were his personal kingdom"; 3) "the power of industrialists and bankers to get their way by use of the crudest form of economic pressure, even blackmail, against a Labour Government"; and 4) the power of the media, which "like the power of the medieval Church, ensures that events of the day are always presented from the point of the view of those who enjoy economic privilege.[tpl]Cite book|last=Benn|first=Tony|title=Out of the Wilderness: Diaries 1963–67| publisher=Arrow| year=1988|page=xi–xiii|isbn=978-0-09-958670-8[/tpl] As regards the power of industrialists and bankers, Benn remarked:  Compared to this, the pressure brought to bear in industrial disputes by the unions is minuscule. This power was revealed even more clearly in 1976 when the International Monetary Fund secured cuts in our public expenditure. ... These four lessons led me to the conclusion that the UK is only superficially governed by MPs and the voters who elect them. Parliamentary democracy is, in truth, little more than a means of securing a periodical change in the management team, which is then allowed to preside over a system that remains in essence intact. If the British people were ever to ask themselves what power they truly enjoyed under our political system they would be amazed to discover how little it is, and some new Chartist agitation might be born and might quickly gather momentum.[tpl]Cite book|last=Benn|first=Tony|title=Out of the Wilderness: Diaries 1963–67| publisher=Arrow| year=1988|page=xiii|isbn=978-0-09-958670-8[/tpl] 
Benn's philosophy consisted of a form of syndicalism, state planning where necessary to ensure national competitiveness, greater democracy in the structures of the Labour Party and observance of Party Conference decisions;[tpl]Cite book|last=Kavanagh|first=Dennis| chapter=Tony Benn: Nuisance or Conscience?|editor= Kavanagh, Dennis|title=Politics and Personalities|publisher=Macmillan|year=1990|page=184|isbn=978-0-333-51580-8[/tpl] he was vilified by most of the press which supported the young Margaret Thatcher — his opponents implied and stated that a Benn-led Labour Government would implement a type of Eastern European socialism.[tpl]Cite book|last=Kavanagh|first=Dennis|chapter=Tony Benn: Nuisance or Conscience?|editor=Kavanagh, Dennis|title=Politics and Personalities|publisher=Macmillan|year=1990|page= 178|isbn=978-0-333-51580-8[/tpl] Benn was overwhelmingly popular with Labour activists: a survey of delegates at the Labour Party Conference in 1978 found that by large margins they supported Benn for the leadership and many Bennite policies.[tpl]Cite journal|last1=Whiteley|first1=Paul|last2=Gordon|first2=Ian|title=The Labour Party: Middle Class, Militant and Male| journal=New Statesman| date= 11 January 1980|pages=41–42[/tpl]
He publicly supported Sinn Féin and the unification of Ireland, although in 2005 he suggested to Sinn Féin leaders that it abandon its long-standing policy of not taking seats at Westminster (abstentionism). Sinn Féin in turn argued that to do so would recognise Britain's claim over Northern Ireland, and the Sinn Féin constitution prevented its elected members from taking their seats in any British-created institution.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/northern_ireland/4540343.stm |title=Benn's call for SF to take seats |work=BBC News |date= 12 May 2005|accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl]

===In opposition===

In a keynote speech to the Labour Party Conference of 1980, shortly before the resignation of party leader James Callaghan and election of Michael Foot as successor, Benn outlined what he envisaged the next Labour Government would do. "Within days", a Labour Government would gain powers to nationalise industries, control capital and implement industrial democracy; "within weeks", all powers from Brussels would be returned to Westminster, and abolish the House of Lords by creating one thousand peers and then abolishing the peerage. Benn received tumultuous applause.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/27/443/107065937w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS17008446&dyn=12!xrn_20_0_CS17008446&hst_1?sw_aep=uwesteng|title=Mr Benn proposes timetable of one month to abolish Lords and leave EEC|format=Subscription required|work=The Times, archived by Gale Group|publisher=Times Newspapers|date=30 September 1980|last=Emery|first=Fred|accessdate=3 May 2010[/tpl]
In 1981, he stood against incumbent Denis Healey for Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, disregarding the appeal from Michael Foot to either stand for the leadership or abstain from inflaming the party's divisions. Benn defended his decision with insistence that it was "not about personalities, but about policies." The contest was extremely closely fought, and Healey won by a margin of barely 1%. The decision of several moderate left-wing MPs, including Neil Kinnock, to abstain triggered the split of the Socialist Campaign Group from the left of the Tribune Group.[tpl]cite book |last=Seyd |first=Patrick |title=The Rise and Fall of the Labour Left |publisher=Macmillan Education |year=1987 |pages=165 |isbn=0-333-44748-4[/tpl]
After Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands in April 1982, Benn argued that the dispute should be settled by the United Nations and that the British Government should not send a task force to recapture the islands. The task force was sent and the Falklands were soon back in British control. In a subsequent debate in the Commons, Benn's demand for "a full analysis of the costs in life, equipment and money in this tragic and unnecessary war" was rejected by Margaret Thatcher, who, apparently unaware of Benn's service in the Second World War and the loss of his brother, stated that "he would not enjoy the freedom of speech that he put to such excellent use unless people had been prepared to fight for it".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=104969|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|title=House of Commons Statement: Falkland Islands|date=15 June 1982|accessdate=4 October 2007[/tpl]
For the 1983 election Benn's Bristol South East constituency was abolished by boundary changes, and he lost to Michael Cocks the battle to stand in the new seat of Bristol South. Rejecting offers from the new seat of Livingston in Scotland, Benn contested Bristol East, losing to Conservative candidate Jonathan Sayeed in what was perceived to be a shock result. He was selected for the next Labour seat to fall vacant, and was elected for Chesterfield in a by-election after Eric Varley resigned to head Coalite. On the day of the by-election, 1 March 1984, The Sun newspaper ran a hostile feature article, "Benn on the Couch", which purported to be the opinions of an American psychiatrist.[tpl]Cite news|title=Benn on the couch|work=The Sun|publisher=News international|date=1 March 1984[/tpl] In the period since Benn's defeat in Bristol, Michael Foot had stepped down after the general election in June 1983 (which saw Labour return a mere 209 MPs) and was succeeded in October of that year by Neil Kinnock.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/27/443/107065937w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS51350883&dyn=21!xrn_30_0_CS51350883&hst_1?sw_aep=uwesteng|format=Subscription required|title=Labour's new line-up|work=The Times, archived by Gale Group|publisher=Times Newspapers|date=3 November 1983|accessdate=3 May 2010[/tpl]
Benn was a prominent supporter of the 1984–85 UK miners' strike and of his long-standing friend, the National Union of Mineworkers leader Arthur Scargill. However, some miners considered Benn's 1977 industry reforms to have caused problems during the strike; firstly, that they led to huge wage differences and distrust between miners of different regions; and secondly that the controversy over balloting miners for these reforms made it unclear as to whether a ballot was needed for a strike or whether it could be deemed as a "regional matter" in the same way that the 1977 reforms had been.[tpl]cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/chapter-06-1974-strikea-conversation-minerslabour-government-benn-helps-divide-miners|title=Chapter 06; ...1974 strike...a conversation with miners...Labour government... ...Benn helps divide miners...|work=libcom.org|accessdate=3 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=640&issue=126|title=25 years after the Great Miners’ Strike|journal=International Socialism|issue=126|date=23 April 2010|last=Robertson|first=Jack|publisher=Socialist Workers Party|location=London, UK|accessdate=3 May 2010[/tpl]
In June 1985, three months after the miners admitted defeat and ended their strike, Benn introduced the Miners' Amnesty (General Pardon) Bill into the Commons, which would have extended an amnesty to all miners imprisoned during the strike. This would have included two men convicted of murder (later reduced to manslaughter) for the killing of David Wilkie, a taxi driver driving a non-striking miner to work in South Wales during the strike.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1985/jun/28/miners-amnesty-general-pardon|title=Miners' Amnesty (General Pardon)|work=Hansard|date=28 June 1985|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl]
Benn stood for election as Party Leader in 1988, against Neil Kinnock, following Labour's third successive defeat in the 1987 general election, and lost by a substantial margin. In May 1989 he made an extended appearance on Channel 4's late-night discussion programme After Dark, alongside among others Lord Dacre and Miles Copeland. During the Gulf War, he visited Baghdad in order to try and persuade Saddam Hussein to release the hostages who had been captured.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/dec/08/1|title=Brief Encounter: Tony Benn|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=8 December 2006|last=Stadlen|first=Nick|accessdate=3 May 2010|location=London, UK[/tpl]
In 1990 he proposed a "Margaret Thatcher (Global Repeal) Bill", which he said "could go through both Houses in 24 hours. It would be easy to reverse the policies and replace the personalities—the process has begun—but the rotten values that have been propagated from the platform of political power in Britain during the past 10 years will be an infection—a virulent strain of right-wing capitalist thinking which it will take time to overcome."Hansard, HC Deb (22 November 1990) vol 181, cols 439–518, at 486 In 1991, with Labour still in opposition and a general election due by June 1992, he proposed the Commonwealth of Britain Bill, abolishing the monarchy in favour of the United Kingdom becoming a "democratic, federal and secular commonwealth", a republic with a written constitution. It was read in Parliament a number of times until his retirement at the 2001 election, but never achieved a second reading.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/bills/commonwealth-of-britain-bill|title=Commonwealth of Britain Bill|work=Hansard|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=3 May 2010[/tpl] He presented an account of his proposal in  Common Sense: A New Constitution for Britain.[tpl]Cite book|last=Benn|first=Tony|last2=Hood|first2= Andrew|title=Common Sense: New Constitution for Britain|editor=Hood, Andrew|publisher=Hutchinson|location=London|date=17 June 1993|isbn=978-0-09-177308-3[/tpl]
Several months prior to his retirement, Benn was a signatory of a letter, alongside Niki Adams (Legal Action for Women), Ian Macdonald QC, Gareth Peirce, and other legal and immigration professionals, that was published in the Guardian newspaper on 22 February 2001 in response to raids of more than 50 brothels in the central London area of Soho. At the time, a police spokesman said: "As far as we know, this is the biggest simultaneous crackdown on brothels and prostitution in this country in recent times", the arrest of 28 people in an operation that involved around 110 police officers.[tpl]cite news|title=50 Soho brothels targeted in raids|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/50-soho-brothels-targeted-in-raids-1.198379|accessdate=22 March 2014|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=16 February 2001[/tpl] The letter read:
 
 We condemn last week's police and immigration raid on women working in Soho as a violation of human and legal rights ... In the name of "protecting" women from trafficking, about 40 women, including a woman from Iraq, were arrested, detained and in some cases summarily removed from Britain. If any of these women have been trafficked ... they deserve protection and resources, not punishment by expulsion ... Having forced women into destitution, the government first criminalised those who begged. Now it is trying to use prostitution as a way to make deportation of the vulnerable more acceptable. We will not allow such injustice to go unchallenged.[tpl]cite news|title=Law violates sex workers|url=http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/feb/22/guardianletters6|accessdate=22 March 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 February 2001|author=Niki Adams|author2=Tony Benn et al[/tpl]
A letter by Nina Lopez-Jones, of the English Collective of Prostitutes, was also published in the same issue of the Guardian.

===Retirement and final years===

Benn did not stand at the 2001 general election; as he explained it, he was "leaving parliament in order to spend more time on politics".[tpl]cite news|first=Gary|last=Younge|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2002/jul/20/interviews.labour|title=The stirrer|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 July 2002|accessdate=16 March 2014[/tpl] Along with Edward Heath, Benn was given by the Speaker the privilege of being able to continue using the House of Commons Library and Members' refreshment facilities. Shortly after his retirement, he was approached by the Stop the War Coalition, and was asked to become its President, an offer he accepted. He became a leading figure of the British opposition to the War in Afghanistan from 2001 and the Iraq War, and in February 2003 he travelled to Baghdad to meet Saddam Hussein. The interview was shown on British television.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/2726831.stm|title=Full text of Benn interview with Saddam|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 May 2010|date=4 February 2003[/tpl]

On 21 June 2005, Benn presented a programme on democracy as part of the Channel 5 series Big Ideas That Changed The World. He presented a left-wing view of democracy as the means to pass power from the "wallet to the ballot". He argued that traditional social democratic values were under threat in an increasingly globalised world in which powerful institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Commission are unelected and unaccountable to those whose lives they affect daily.[tpl]cite news |last=Joseph |first=Joe |title=Benn's stall sells democracy short |publisher=The Times |date=22 June 2005 |page=27[/tpl]
On 27 September 2005, Benn became ill while at the Labour Party Conference in Brighton and was taken by ambulance to the Royal Sussex County Hospital after being treated by paramedics at the Brighton Centre.

In a list compiled by the magazine New Statesman in 2006, he was voted twelfth in the list of "Heroes of our Time". In September 2006, Benn joined the "Time to Go" demonstration in Manchester the day before the start of the final Labour Party Conference with Tony Blair as Party Leader, with the aim of persuading the Labour Government to withdraw troops from Iraq, to refrain from attacking Iran and to reject replacing the Trident missile and submarines with a new system. He spoke to the demonstrators in the rally afterwards.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/5373128.stm|title=Thousands at city's anti-war demo|work=BBC News|date=23 September 2006|accessdate=3 May 2010[/tpl] In 2007, he appeared in an extended segment in the Michael Moore film Sicko giving comments about democracy, social responsibility and health care.

At the Stop the War Conference 2009, he described the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as "Imperialist war(s)" and discussed the killing of American and allied troops by Iraqi or foreign insurgents, questioning whether they were in fact freedom fighters, and comparing the insurgents to a British Dad's Army, saying "If you are invaded you have a right to self-defence, and this idea that people in Iraq and Afghanistan who are resisting the invasion are militant Muslim extremists is a complete bloody lie. I joined Dad's Army when I was sixteen, and if the Germans had arrived, I tell you, I could use a bayonet, a rifle, a revolver, and if I'd seen a German officer having a meal I'd have tossed a grenade through the window.

In an interview published in Dartford Living in September 2009, Benn was critical of the Government's decision to delay the findings of the Iraq War Inquiry until after the General Election, stating that "people can take into account what the inquiry has reported on but they’ve deliberately pushed it beyond the election. Government is responsible for explaining what it has done and I don’t think we were told the truth."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dartfordadvertising.co.uk/uploaded_files Dartford%20Living%20September%202009.pdf|title= Big Benn Chimes in to Dartford|date=September 2009|format=PDF|page=10 |last=Khairoun|first=Abdel|work=Dartford Living|accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] He also stated that local government was strangled by Margaret Thatcher and had not been liberated by New Labour.
