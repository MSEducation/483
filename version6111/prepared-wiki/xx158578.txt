A choke ring antenna is a particular form of omnidirectional antenna for use at high frequencies.  It consists of a number of conductive concentric cylinders around a central antenna.  Due to its delicate construction, it is often enclosed in a protective cover or radome when placed outside and exposed to the elements.  
Choke ring antennas are notable for their ability to reject multipath signals fading from a source.  Since the path that a signal takes from a transmitter to receiver can be used to measure the distance between the two, this makes it highly suited for GPS and radar applications.  In a GPS ground based receiver, a choke ring antenna can provide millimeter precision measurementshttp://www.trimble.com/infrastructure/gnss-choke-ring-antenna.aspx - Catalog page for a Trimble choke ring antenna. for surveying and geological measurement applications.
The choke ring design originated at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.http://www.javad.com/jns/technology/Single-Depth%20Low-Multipath%20Choke%20Ring.html - A basic description of choke ring antenna benefits and limitations.
