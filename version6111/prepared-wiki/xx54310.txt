[[Jinx]]

CATEGORIES: Luck, Curses

A jinx, in popular superstition and folklore, is:
The superstition can also be referenced when talking about a future event with too much confidence. A statement such as "We're sure to win the contest!" can be seen as a jinx because it tempts fate, thereby bringing bad luck. The event itself is referred to as "jinxed".
In a similar way, calling attention to good fortune – e.g. noting that a certain athlete is having a streak of particularly good fortune – is thought to "jinx" it. If the good fortune ends immediately afterward, the jinx is then blamed for the turn of events, often seriously.

==Origins==

The etymology of the word is obscure.
The Online Etymology Dictionary entry for jinx states that the word was first used, as a noun, in American English in 1911. It traces it to a 17th-century word jyng, meaning "a spell", and ultimately to the Latin word iynx.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=jinx&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: Jinx |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11[/tpl]
Barry Popik of the American Dialect Society suggests that the word should be traced back to an American folksong called Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, which was first popular in 1868. One verse in one version goes:
The reference to various misfortunes and a curse lend plausibility to this.
A Mr Jinx appeared in Ballou's monthly magazine - Volume 6 - Page 276 in 1857.

==In sports==

The earliest use[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] of the word "jinx" to refer to something other than the bird seems to have been in the context of baseball; in the short story The Jinx (1910) – later collected in the book The Jinx: Stories of the Diamond (1911) – Allen Sangree wrote:
 By th' bones of Mike Kelly, I'll do it! Yes, sir, I'll hoodoo th' whole darned club, I will. I'll put a jinx on 'em or my name ain't Dasher, an' that goes! 
And again

and later referenced in Pitching at a Pinch (1912), Christy Mathewson[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-jin1.htm |title=Jinx |publisher=World Wide Words |date=1999-08-14 |accessdate=2010-10-11[/tpl] explained that "a jinx is something which brings bad luck to all ball player." Baseball's most common "jinx" belief is that talking about a pitcher's ongoing no-hitter will cause it to be ended. See also Curse of the Bambino.
