Charodei ([tpl]lang-ru|Чародеи[/tpl], translations -  Enchanters, Sorcerers, Magicians) is a 1982 Soviet film directed by Konstantin Bromberg, loosely based on the science fantasy novel Monday Begins on Saturday by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky.
First script was more related to the canon novel (Monday Begins on Saturday) and was in fact an intention to make its screen version, with some new storylines though, but Bromberg didn't like it and Strugatsky Brothers wrote absolutely new script from scratch. History later repeated with another film by Sokurov "Days of Eclipse" (Dni zatmeniya).
Film became a classic Soviet New Year's Eve romantic comedies, such as Irony of Fate (Ironiya sud'by) and The Carnival Night (Karnavalnaya noch).

==Plot summary==

Gaft), separates them. Her friends — magic wood masters, working in NUINU (Scientific Universal Institute of Extraordinary Services, a NIICHAVO subsidiary in Kitezhgrad; for NIICHAVO see Monday Begins on Saturday) - decides to interfere and help to save the love.
