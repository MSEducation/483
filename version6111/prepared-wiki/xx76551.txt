Altered Space: A 3-D Alien Adventure is a 1991 video game produced for the Nintendo Game Boy. The basic concept is that the player is an astronaut trapped on an alien spaceship who has to try to find his way out while avoiding aliens and continually replenishing his oxygen supply.
This was the first isometric view game on the Game Boy - a style made popular by games such as Knight Lore on the ZX Spectrum and Solstice on the NES and finally Equinox.
