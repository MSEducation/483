==Club career==

===Randers===

Fabinho got a good start of 2008. Due to Randers FC's new strikers Marc Nygaard and Søren Berg, Fabinho found himself sidelined in the first two matches. However he was used as a substitute in the first two matches against Brøndby IF. In both games, Fabinho managed to score a goal as the only one on the Randers FC team. However this was not enough to secure victory since Randers FC lost both games.
Fabinho proved his value as a late sub again on April 19 when Randers FC played against FC Copenhagen. Fabinho scored the winning goal in the ending minutes.

===Herfølge & HB Køge===

In 2008, Fabinho signed with former Danish Champions, Herfølge Boldklub. After a good season for Fabinho, Herfølge merged with Køge Boldklub to form new team HB Køge. Fabinho currently plays for HB Køge in the highest Danish division.
