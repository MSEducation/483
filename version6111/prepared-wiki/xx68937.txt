[[Saalkreis]]

Saalkreis was a district (Kreis) in the south of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Neighboring districts were (from west clockwise) Mansfelder Land, Bernburg, Köthen, Bitterfeld, the district Delitzsch in the Free State of Saxony, and the district Merseburg-Querfurt. The district-free city Halle is nearly surrounded by the district.

==Geography==

The main river of the district is the Saale, which also gave it its name. Other rivers and streams flowing through the former district are the Laweke, Würde, Kabelske, Strengbach and Götsche. Whilst the western part of the region is dominated by hillocks and dissecting valleys, the north and east are characterized by flat plains. The Petersberg near Halle, at [tpl]Höhe|250.40|DE-NN|link=true[/tpl], was the highest point of the former Saalkreis and lay in the northeast of the district.
