A Camp is the solo side project of Nina Persson, vocalist for the Swedish Indie Pop band The Cardigans.
Persson formed A Camp when The Cardigans took a break after several years of touring and the recording of their 1998 album Gran Turismo.

A Camp's debut album, also called A Camp, was originally recorded with Niclas Frisk of Atomic Swing, before Persson teamed up with Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse to re-record it. In doing so he also contributed some new songs to the album.
Persson had been a long-time fan of Sparklehorse and has referred to them as "the best I've ever heard".  After a gig in Lund, Sweden, Persson gave Linkous a cassette of all the demo A Camp songs.  When they met again during the recording of his most recent album, Persson mustered the courage to invite him to produce her project.  Linkous listened, liked the songs, and agreed.
The debut album released the singles "I Can Buy You" and "Song for the Leftovers". These country-inspired selections later seemed to have inspired The Cardigans' following album, Long Gone Before Daylight, which was released in the UK summer 2003, and the USA in May 2004.
In 2004, "Charlie Charlie" (the "I Can Buy You" single B-side) was covered (with new lyrics in Polish) by the Polish singer Ania and released as a single from her debut album Samotność po zmierzchu.
