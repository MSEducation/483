National Institute of Aeronautics and Space ([tpl]lang-id|Lembaga Penerbangan dan Antariksa Nasional[/tpl]/LAPAN) is the Indonesian government space agency.  It was established on November 27, 1963 by former Indonesian president Sukarno after one year's existence of an informal space agency organization. LAPAN is responsible for long-term civilian and military aerospace research. For over two decades, it has managed satellites^ domain-developed small scientific-technology satellites Lapan and telecommunication satellites Palapa, which were built by Hughes (now Boeing Satellite Systems) and launched from the US on Delta rockets or from French Guiana using Ariane 4 and Ariane 5 rockets. It has also developed sounding rockets and has been developing small orbital space launchers that will allow Indonesia to join the space power's club within the 2012-2014 time frame. It has also been reported that LAPAN plans to launch its first indigenous space launcher with a satellite payload some time in November 2013.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.antaranews.com/berita/375368/lapan-suvei-lokasi-peluncuran-roket-pembawa-satelit-di-morotai |title=LAPAN Luncurkan Roket pembawa Satelit di bulan November |date=May 18, 2013[/tpl]

==History==

On May 31, 1962, Indonesia commenced aeronautics exploration when the Aeronautics Committee was established by the Indonesian Prime Minister, Juanda, who was also the head of Indonesian Aeronautics.  The secretary of Indonesian Aeronautics, RJ Salatun, was also involved in the establishment.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
On September 22, 1962, the Initial Scientific and Military Rocket Project (known in Indonesia as Proyek Roket Ilmiah dan Militer Awal or "PRIMA") was formed as an affiliation of AURI (Indonesian Air Force) and ITB (Bandung Institute of Technology).  The outcome of the project was the launching of two "Kartika"("star") series rockets and their telemetric ordnances.
After two informal projects, which had no national contribution, the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) was established in 1963 by Presidential Decree 236.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]

==Programmes==

For more than 20 years, LAPAN doing in research on Rocket, Remote Sensing, Satellites and Space Sciences.

===Satellites===

====Palapa A1 and A2====

The first program was the Palapa A1 (launched August 7, 1976) and A2 (launched October 3, 1977). The satellites were almost identical to Canada's Anik and Western Union's Westars although the Indonesian variants had larger parabolic reflectors suited to the large area of the archipelago.  Although the satellites belonged to the government-owned company Perumtel, the spacecraft were made in the United States.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]

====LAPAN Satellites====

The development of microsatellites has become an opportunity for LAPAN in developing its space program. The development of such satellites requires only limited budget and facilities, compared to the development of big satellites. Meanwhile, the capability to develop micro-satellite will brings LAPAN to the readiness state to implement a future space program that will have measureable economic impact, and therefore contribute to the country’s sustainable development effort.

=====LAPAN-A1=====

Lapan-A1 or Lapan-Tubsat is designed to transfer of knowledge, skill and experience on micro-satellite technology development from Technische Universität Berlin, Germany to LAPAN. The spacecraft is based the German DLR-Tubsat, but includes a new star sensor and features a new 45 × 45 × 27 cm structure. The satellite payload is a COTS video camera with 1000 mm lens, resulting into nadir resolution of 5 m and nadir swath of 3,5 km from 650 km altitude. In addition to that the satellite carries another video camera with 50 mm lens, resulting into 200 m resolution video image with swath of 80 km at nadir. The uplink and downlink for telemetry, tracking and command (TTC) is done in UHF and downlink for video is done in S-band analog. The satellite is successfully launched to SSO of 635 km as auxiliary payload in Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) C7 from Sriharikota, India on January 10, 2007. LAPAN Tubsat performed technological experiments, earth observation and attitude control experiments.

=====LAPAN-A2=====

The mission for LAPAN-A2 or LAPAN-ORARI is Earth observation using RGB camera, maritime traffic monitoring using AIS, and amateur radio communication (text & voice; ORARI is Indonesian Amateur Radio Organization). The satellite will be launched as auxiliary payloads for ASTROSAT mission which has orbit of be 650 km circular at inclination of 8 degree. The purpose of the project is to develop capability to design, Assembly, Integration and Test (AIT) process of micro-satellite in Indonesia. The satelitte will be launched in second half of 2012 through Indian PSLV and will monitor Indonesia every 97 minutes or 14 times a day.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mediaindonesia.com/read/2012/02/02/295809/291/7/Lapan-Kembangkan-Satelit-Observasi-Bumi |title=Lapan Kembangkan Satelit Observasi Bumi |date=February 2, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.garudamiliter.blogspot.com/2013/04/sasaran-kegiatan-lapan-2013.html |title=Sasaran Kegiatan LAPAN 2013 |date=April 14, 2013[/tpl]

=====LAPAN-A3=====

LAPAN-A3 or LAPAN-IPB will perform experimental remote sensing mission. In addition to that, the satellite will support global AIS mission and amateur radio communication. The satellite payload is a 4-bands push broom multi-spectral imaging camera (Landsat band : B, G, R, NIR), which will give resolution of 18 m and coverage of 120 km from 650 km altitude.

===International cooperation===

In 2008 Indonesia signed an agreement with the Ukrainian National Space Agency (NSAU) that will allow access to rocket and satellite technologies.

===Spaceport Development Plan===

====Biak Spaceport Plan (2006)====

Since 2006 Indonesia and Russia have been discussing the possibility of launching satellite from Biak island using Air Launch technology. LAPAN and Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA) have worked on a Government-to-Government agreement in Space Cooperation in order to enable such activities in Indonesia. It is planned that Antonov An-124 aircraft will deliver a Polyot space launch vehicle to the new Indonesian spaceport on Biak island (West Papua province). This spaceport is well suited to commercial launches as it sits almost exactly on the equator - any space vehicle launched at the equator has a greater initial velocity imparted to it, making higher velocity or heavier payloads possible. In the spaceport, the launch vehicle will be fuelled and the satellites will be loaded on it. The Antonov An-124 carrying the launch vehicle is to fly at 10 km altitude above the ocean East of Biak island to jettison the launch vehicle John J. Klein.

==Rockets==

LAPAN rockets are classified "RX" (Roket Eksperimental) followed by the diameter in millimeters. For example, the RX-100 has a diameter of 100 mm.
LAPAN's current workhouse rocket propulsion system consists of four stages, namely the three-stage RX 420 and the RX-320 level. It is planned to use the RX-420 as a booster (rocket booster) RPS for the planned Roket Pengorbit Satelit ("Orbital Satellite Rocket") planned to fly in 2014.
In 2008 optimistic hopes were that this rocket,. known as SLV (Satellite Launch Vehicle) would first be launched in Indonesia to 2012, and if there were extra funds pursuant to the good economic situation of 2007-8, possibly the year 2010.
In fact, the LAPAN budget for 2008 and 2007 was Rp 200 billion (approximately USD $20million). Budgetary issues surrounding the international credit crises of 2008-2009 placed many Indonesian technical projects in jeopardy most especially the complete development of RX-420 and associated micro-satellite program to world-class standards ahead of project finalization schedule and the opportunity to work together with the world institutions. LAPAN hopes to be an educating partner with Indian Aerospace in sciences related to satellite.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
