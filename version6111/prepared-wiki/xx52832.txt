Modest Mouse is an American indie rock band formed in 1993 in Issaquah, Washington, by singer/guitarist Isaac Brock, drummer Jeremiah Green, and bassist Eric Judy. Since their 1996 debut album, This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About, their lineup has centered around Brock, Green, and Judy. Guitarist Johnny Marr (formerly of The Smiths) joined the band in May 2006, along with percussionist Joe Plummer (formerly of The Black Heart Procession) and multi-instrumentalist Tom Peloso, to work on the album We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank. Guitarist Jim Fairchild joined the band in February 2009. Their name is derived from a passage from the Virginia Woolf story "The Mark on the Wall" which reads, "I wish I could hit upon a pleasant track of thought, a track indirectly reflecting credit upon myself, for those are the pleasantest thoughts, and very frequent even in the minds of modest, mouse-coloured people, who believe genuinely that they dislike to hear their own praises."[tpl]cite book|last=Goldsher |first=Alan |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Mt-pjSw03WMC&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=%22The+Mark+on+the+Wall%22+%22modest+mouse%22&source=bl&ots=YlMpmbmg6S&sig=zmLMSu6Ktw9Cu_pesBqDPGRTJ9A&hl=en&ei=jotHTcmgFpP6sAOu4uyUAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Mark%20on%20the%20Wall%22%20%22modest%20mouse%22&f=false |title=Modest Mouse: A Pretty Good Read |accessdate=2011-01-31[/tpl]

==History==

===Formation and early years: 1994-1999===

In 1994, Modest Mouse recorded their first EP, Blue Cadet-3, Do You Connect?, at Calvin Johnson's Dub Narcotic Studios. It was released by K Records. A single, "Broke", followed under Sub Pop that was recorded by Steve Wold (a.k.a. bluesman Seasick Steve) at Moon Studios in Olympia, Washington. During this time, Modest Mouse also recorded what would have been their first album, Sad Sappy Sucker, but constant delays caused the album to be shelved and forgotten. It was not until 2001 that it was officially released. Before making their way into the pop music world in 2004, many of their tours included stops at DIY/punk venues.
After moving to Up Records,Epitonic.com: Your Source for Cutting-Edge Music[tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] Modest Mouse released two full-length albums and other recordings recorded at Moon Studios, including the 1996 LP This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About. This album was produced and recorded by Steve Wold (at the time Wold was assisting in the recordings as well, but was not officially part of the band). The next offering was Interstate 8, also produced by Wold. The 1997 album, The Lonesome Crowded West, (also recorded at Moon Studios, by Scott Swayze) turned out to serve as the band's breakthrough. The Lonesome Crowded West gained the band a cult following, and is now popularly considered to be one of the defining albums of mid-1990s indie rock. During this time Nick Kraft was brought in to refine the band's sound. Prior to its release, the band had recorded the EP The Fruit That Ate Itself. In 1999, Up Records released a singles and rarities collection entitled Building Nothing Out of Something, which included the entirety of Interstate 8 except for the songs "Edit the Sad Parts" and "Buttons to Push the Buttons".

===Critical success: 2000-2002===

In 2000, Modest Mouse released The Moon & Antarctica, their first album on Epic Records. The album was critically well-received[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/modestmouse/moonandantarctica |title=Modest Mouse: The Moon & Antarctica (2000): Reviews |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=2009-12-15 |accessdate=2011-07-15[/tpl] including a 9.8 out of 10 score from online music magazine, Pitchfork Media.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5358-the-moon-antarctica/ |title=Pitchfork: Album Reviews: Modest Mouse: The Moon & Antarctica |publisher=Pitchforkmedia.com |date=2000-06-13 |accessdate=2010-09-08[/tpl] It has subsequently gone on to receive further acclaim.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.listology.com/content_show.cfm/content_id.16477 |title=Pitchfork's Top 100 Albums of 2000–2004 |publisher=Listology |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15[/tpl] Brock has since released an album with his side project Ugly Casanova on Sub Pop, which was the only side project allowed due to the contract. The band licensed "Gravity Rides Everything" for a commercial for Nissan's Quest minivan, a move that Brock has publicly acknowledged as blatantly commercial but necessary to achieve financial stability.  Regarding the commercial, Brock stated, "People who don't play music for a living can criticize my morals while they live off their parents' money or wash dishes for some asshole."[tpl]cite web|last=Modell |first=Josh |url=http://avclub.com/content/node/23015 |title=Modest Mouse |publisher=The A.V.

According to e-mails sent from Glacial Pace which responded to fans confused about the large gaps between albums, Modest Mouse is indeed currently writing and recording material and have been for quite some time.

Thus, it remains unclear when Modest Mouse will release their next album.
