==Music video==

The music video begins with a quick arrangement of clips showing the members of Jump5 doing various flips/jumps in the air. Then it shows Brittany atop a balcony singing the beginning words. The camera then pans down to the other members who are dancing on a stone courtyard with a waterfall in the background. They go into a dance routine as the song is in full swing. During the singing of the first two verses, there are many clips of Jump5 dancing and singing sometimes in red clothes, sometimes in blue. After the bridge, the remainder of the video shows Jump5 on a carousel, and dancing in the courtyard. Upon the last words of, "You keep me spinnin' around" at the song's close, the members jump in the air and strike a mid-air pose.
