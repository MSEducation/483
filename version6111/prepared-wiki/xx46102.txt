[[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)]]

CATEGORIES: Ethnic groups of partial European ancestry

The word Eurasian refers to people of mixed Asian and European ancestry. It was originally coined in nineteenth-century British India to refer to Anglo-Indians of mixed British and Indian descent.[tpl]cite web|title=Eurasian|publisher=Dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Eurasian|accessdate=2009-01-13[/tpl] The term has seen some use in anthropological literature from the 1960s.Current Anthropology, Vol. 2, No. 1 (Feb., 1961), p. 64.

==Overview==

===Eurasian peoples===

Historically, Central Asia has been a crossroad between West and East Eurasian people leading to the current high population genetic admixture and diversity.[tpl]cite journal |last=González-Ruiz |first=Mercedes |last2=Santos |first2=Cristina |last3=Jordana |first3=Xavier |last4=Simón |first4=Marc |last5=Lalueza-Fox |first5=Carles |last6=Gigli |first6=Elena |last7=Pilar Aluja |first8=Maria |first8=Assumpció |last8=Malgosa |year=2012 |title=Tracing the Origin of the East-West Population Admixture in the Altai Region (Central Asia) |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0048904 |journal=PLOS ONE |publisher=Public Library of Science |volume= 7|issue=11 |page=1 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0048904 |accessdate=23 November 2013[/tpl]
Early physical analyses have unanimously concluded that the Scythians, even those in the east (e.g. the Pazyryk region), possessed predominantly "Europioid" features, although mixed 'Euro-mongoloid" phenotypes also occur, depending on site and period. Based on craniofacial data, the Scythians were believed to be of mixed Euro-Mongoloid origin.[ref]

Anthropologist SA Pletnev studied a group of burials of Kipchaks in the Volga region and found them to have Caucasoid features with some admixture of Mongoloid traits, with physical characteristics such as flat face and distinctly protruding nose.SA Pletnev, Page 2 They were nomadic people that ruled areas stretching from Kazakhstan, Caucasus, eastern Europe.
The Eurasian Avars were group of sixth-century nomadic warriors that came from Northern Central Asia who ruled in what is today Central Europe. Anthropological research has revealed few skeletons with Mongoloid-type features, although there was continuing cultural influence from the Eurasian nomadic steppe. The early Avar anthropological material was said to be almost exclusively Europoid in the seventh century according to Pál Lipták, while grave-goods indicated Middle and Central Asian parallels. However, cemeteries dated for the eighth century contained Mongoloid elements among others. He analysed population of the Danube-Tisza midland region in the Avar period and found that approximately 80% of them showed Europoid characteristics.Erzsébet Fóthi, Anthropological conclusions of the study of Roman and Migration periods, Acta Biologica Szegediensis, Volume 44(1-4):87-94, 2000 Mongoloid and Euro-Mongoloid types compose about one-third of the total population of the Avar graves of the eighth century with the late Avar Period showing more hybridization resulting in higher frequencies of Europo-Mongolids."Acta archaeologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae", Magyar Tudományos Akadémia, 1 Jan 1967, Page 86 http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HCIrAQAAIAAJ&q=Avars++mongoloids&dq=Avars++mongoloids&hl=en&ei=s6_OTrv0CMTc8AOUwpT0Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&redir_esc=y Initially, the Avars and their subjects lived separately, except for Slavic and Germanic women who were married to Avar men. Eventually, the Germanic and Slavic peoples were included in the Avaric social order and culture, which itself was Persian-Byzantine in fashion.History of Transylvania
The Seljuk empire which ruled from Central Asia, Middle East to modern Turkey, their descendants are the Iranian Turkmen and Afghan Turkmen and are mixture of Mongoloid/Caucasoid.
Many Eurasian ethnic groups arose during the Mongol invasion of Europe. Partial Mongol descendants of Central Asians and Circassians such as the Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Nogais also created many Eurasian ethnic groups under the empires they created (Timurid dynasty, Mughal Empire, Kazakh Khanate, Nogai Horde) and ruled vast lands stretching from Russia, the Caucasus, Middle East, Central Asia, South Asia. Other Eurasian ethnicities developed by the colonial occupation of Asian regions by European states and private corporations that started with the great wave of European naval expansion and exploration in the sixteenth century and continues to the present.  The main European colonial powers were Spain and Portugal in the sixteenth century, followed by the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and France from the seventeenth century onwards.  They colonized throughout South Asia, and into Indonesia and the Philippines.
The term 'Eurasian' was first coined in British India in 1844 by the Marquess of Hastings.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] The term was originally used to refer to those who are now known as Anglo-Indians, people of mixed British and Indian descent.[tpl]cite book |author=Meiqi Lee |title=Being Eurasian: Memories Across Racial Divides |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mVGd71y1Y-0C&lpg=PP1&dq=eurasian%20people&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2011-11-02 |edition=illustrated |series= |volume= |date= |year=2004 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |location= |language= |isbn=962-209-671-9 |page=2 |pages= |at= |chapter=[/tpl]

==Specific groups==

===Argentina===

Today, there are an estimated of 180,000 Asian-Argentines, with 120,000 of Chinese descent,27/9/2010 clarin.com    January 2009 32,000 of Japanese descent, 25,000 of Korean descent.[tpl]citation|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade|publication-place=South Korea|year=2009|accessdate=2009-05-21|url=http://www.mofat.go.kr/consul/overseascitizen/compatriotcondition/index6.jsp?TabMenu=TabMenu6|title=재외동포현황/Current Status of Overseas Compatriots[/tpl]

===Brazil===

Common estimates generally include about 25–35% of Japanese Brazilians as multiracial, being generally over 50–60% among the yonsei, or fourth-generation outside Japan. In Brazil, home to the largest Japanese community overseas, miscegenation is celebrated, and it promoted racial integration and mixing over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, nevertheless as a way of dealing with and assimilating its non-white population, submitted to white elites, with no dangers of uprisings that would put its status quo in risk.
While culture shock was strong for the first and second generations of Japanese Brazilians, and the living conditions in the fazendas (plantation farms) after the slavery crisis were sometimes worse than in Asia, Brazil stimulated immigration as means of substitution for the lost workforce, and any qualms about the non-whiteness of the Japanese were quickly forgotten. After Japan became one of the world's most developed and rich nations, the Japanese in Brazil and their culture as well gained an image of progress, instead of the old bad perception of a people which would not be assimilated or integrated as its culture and race were deemed as diametrically opposed to the Brazilian ones.
In the censuses, self-reported amarelos (literally "yellows" i.e. Mongolics, people racially Asian) include about 2,100,000 people, or around 1% of the Brazilian population. A greater number of persons may have Japanese and less commonly Chinese and Korean ancestry, but identify as white (Brazilian society has no one drop rule), pardo (i.e. brown-skinned multiracial or assimilated Amerindian, pardo stands for a Brazilian darker than white and lighter than black, but not necessarily implying a white-black admixture) or Afro-Brazilian. When it comes to religion, self-reported Asian Brazilians are only less Irreligious than whites, and a little more Catholic than Amerindians. They are the least group when it comes to traditional churches of Christianity, and also the least group in percent of Protestants, and Evangelicals or Pentecostals as well. Asian Brazilians have the highest income per capita according to the 2010 census.

===Central Asia===

Central Asians are a mixture of various peoples such as Mongols, Turkics, and Iranians. Genetic studies show that Central Asian Turkic people and Hazara are a mixture of East Asians and Indo-Iranian people. Caucasian ancestry is prevalent in many of Central Asian Turkic people. Kazakhs, Hazara, Karakalpaks, Crimean Tatars have more Caucasoid mtdna than Caucasoid y-dna, Kyrgyz have mostly Caucasoid y-dna with substantial Caucasoid mtdna. Other Turkic people like Uyghurs and Uzbeks, have mostly Caucasoid y-dna but also a significant high percentages of Caucasoid mtdna. Turkmen have predominately Caucasoid y-dna and mtdna.[tpl]citation  |doi=10.1086/342096 |author=Tatjana Zerjal |title=A Genetic Landscape Reshaped by Recent Events: Y-Chromosomal Insights into Central Asia |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |year=2002 |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=466–482 |pmid=12145751 |pmc=419996 |author-separator=, |display-authors=1 |last2=Wells |first2=R.

===Caucasus===

The Nogais who live in Southern Russia/North Caucasus are a mixture of Mongoloid and Caucasoid and also have high frequencies mongoloid paternal y-dna. Some North Caucasus ethnic groups also contain low to moderate frequencies of Mongolian paternal DNA such as Haplogroup C-M217 (Y-DNA).The Caucasus as an asymmetric semipermeable barrier to ancient human migrations http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/09/13/molbev.msr221.abstractDienekes’ Anthropology Blog: The Caucasus revisited (Yunusbayev et al. 2011)

===Hong Kong===

In 19th century Hong Kong, Eurasian or "half-caste" children were stigmatised as symbols of moral degradation and racial impurity by both European and Chinese communities.[ref]
[tpl]cite journal|title=‘A position of usefulness’: gendering history of girls’ education in colonial Hong Kong (1850s–1890s)|journal=History of Education: Journal of the History of Education Society|publisher=Routledge|author=Patricia Pok‐kwan Chiu|volume=37|issue=6|year=November 2008|page=799[/tpl][/ref] According to Chiu:
 
 "To the European community, such children were the ‘tangible evidence of moral irregularity’, while to the Chinese community they embodied the shame and ‘evil’ of their marginalised mothers. Stewart has commented that, ‘The word “barbarian” on the lip of a Greek contained but an iota of the contempt which the Chinese entertain for such persons’."

In the 1890s Ernst Johann Eitel, a German missionary, controversially claimed that most "half-caste" people in Hong Kong were descended exclusively from Europeans having relationships with outcast groups such as the Tanka people. Carl Smith's study in the 1960s on "protected women" (the kept mistresses of foreigners) to an extent supports Eitel's theory. The Tanka were marginalised in Chinese society which consisted of the majority Puntis (Cantonese-speaking people). Custom precluded their intermarriage with the Cantonese and Hakka-speaking populations and they had limited opportunities of settlement on land. Consequently the Tanka did not experience the same social pressures when dealing with Europeans. Eitel's theory, however, was criticised by Henry J. Lethbridge writing in the 1970s as a "myth" propagated by xenophobic Cantonese to account for the establishment of the Hong Kong Eurasian community.[tpl]cite book |author=Meiqi Lee |title=Being Eurasian: Memories Across Racial Divides |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mVGd71y1Y-0C&pg=PA262&dq=eitel+half+caste&hl=en&ei=cKqxTv2HM6fj0QHnmtzeAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=eitel%20half%20caste&f=false |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2011-11-02 |edition=illustrated |series= |volume= |date= |year=2004 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |location= |language= |isbn=962-209-671-9 |page=262 |pages= |at= |chapter= |quote=EJ Eitel, in the late 1890s, claims that the 'half-caste population in Hong Kong ' were from the earliest days of the settlement almost exclusively the offspring of liaisons between European men and women of outcaste ethnic groups such as Tanka (Europe in , 169). Lethbridge refutes the theory saying it was based on a 'myth' propagated by xenophobic Cantonese to account for the establishment of the Hong Kong Eurasian community. Carl Smith's study in late 1960s on the protected women seems, to some degree, support Eitel's theory. Smith says that the Tankas experienced certain restrictions within the traditional Chinese social structure. Custom precluded their intermarriage with the Cantonese and Hakka-speaking populations. The Tanka women did not have bound feet. Their opportunities for settlement on shore were limited. They were hence not as closely tied to Confucian ethics as other Chinese ethnic groups. Being a group marginal to the traditional Chinese society of the Puntis (Cantonese), they did not have the same social pressure in dealing with Europeans (CT Smith, Chung Chi Bulletin, 27). 'Living under the protection of a foreigner,' says Smith, 'could be a ladder to financial security, if not respectability, for some of the Tanka boat girls' (13 ).[/tpl][tpl]cite book |authors=Maria Jaschok, Suzanne Miers |editor=Maria Jaschok, Suzanne Miers |title=Women and Chinese patriarchy: submission, servitude, and escape |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f5o_t7VxHYAC&pg=PA223&dq=eitel+half+caste&hl=en&ei=N7OxTsPpMKjZ0QHu_KXVAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=eitel%20half%20caste&f=false |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2011-11-01 |edition=illustrated |series= |volume= |date= |year=1994 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Zed Books |location= |language= |isbn=1-85649-126-9 |page=223 |pages= |at= |chapter= |quote=He states that they had a near- monopoly of the trade in girls and women, and that: The half-caste population in Hong Kong were, from the earliest days of the settlement of the Colony and down to the present day, almost exclusively the offspring of these Tan-ka people.

These results do not give any information as to the extent of male European admixture in the Hong Kong population.
Notable examples of Eurasian people from Hong Kong include Nancy Kwan, once a Hollywood sex symbol, born in Hong Kong to a Cantonese father and English and Scottish mother, and Bruce Lee, the influential martial artist icon born to a Cantonese father and a Eurasian mother. The number of people who identified as "Mixed with one Chinese parent" according to the 2001 Hong Kong Census was 16,587, which had risen to 24,649 in 2011.

===Peru===

About 100,000 Cantonese coolies (almost all males) in 1849 to 1874 migrated to Peru and intermarried with Peruvian women of mestizo, European, Ameridian, European/mestizo, African and mulatto origin. Many Peruvian Chinese and Peruvian Japanese today are of Spanish, Italian, African and Ameridian. Estimates for Chinese-Peruvian is about 1.3-1.6 millions. Asian Peruvians are estimated to be 3% of the population, but one source places the number of citizens with some Chinese ancestry at 4.2 million, which equates to 15% of the country's total population.

===Cuba===

120000 Cantonese coolies (all males) entered Cuba under contract for 80 years, most did not marry, but Hung Hui (1975:80) cites there was a frequency of sexual activity between black women and Cantonese coolies. According to Osberg (1965:69) the free Chinese practice of buying slave women and freeing them expressly for marriage. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Chinese men (Cantonese) engaged in sexual activity with white Cuban women and black Cuban women, and from such relations many children were born. (For a British Caribbean model of Chinese cultural retention through procreation with black women, see Patterson, 322-31).http://www.cla.purdue.edu/idis/violence-center/documents/LAP_essay_on_sino-cubans__.race_gender__sexuality_as_discour.pdf[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
In the 1920s an additional 30000 Cantonese and small groups of Japanese also arrived; both immigrations were exclusively male, and there was rapid intermarriage with white, black, and mulato populations.http://www..com/topics/cubaCuba: a Lonely Planet travel survival kit CIA World Factbook.

===Costa Rica===

The Chinese originated from the Cantonese male migrants. Pure Chinese make up only 1% of the Costa Rican population but according to Jacqueline M. Newman close to 10% of Costa Ricans are of Chinese descent or married to a Chinese.Chinese Food in Costa Rica by Jacqueline M. Newman Most Chinese immigrants since then have been Cantonese, but in the last decades of the twentieth century, a number of immigrants have also come from Taiwan. Many men came alone to work and married Costa Rican women and speak Cantonese. However the majority of the descendants of the first Chinese immigrants no longer speak Cantonese and feel themselves to be Costa Ricans.Book: Costa Rica: a global studies handbook, Author: Margaret Tyler Mitchell, Scott Pentzer http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0edCL8TY08gC&pg=PA249&dq=Most+Chinese+immigrants+since+then+have+been+Cantonese,+but+in+the+last+decades+of+the+20th+century,+a+number+of+immigrants+have+also+come+from+Taiwan.+Many+men+came+alone+to+work+and+married+Costa+Rican+women+and+speak+Cantonese&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hmAjT6_LKMyJhQeM5KH1BA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Most%20Chinese%20immigrants%20since%20then%20have%20been%20Cantonese%2C%20but%20in%20the%20last%20decades%20of%20the%2020th%20century%2C%20a%20number%20of%20immigrants%20have%20alse%20come%20from%20Taiwan.%20Many%20men%20came%20alone%20to%20work%20and%20married%20Costa%20Rican%20women%20and%20speak%20Cantonese&f=false They married Tican women (who are a blend of Europeans, Caztizos, Mestizos, Indian, black).Costa Rica, People A Tican is also a white person with a small portion of nonwhite blood like caztizos. The census In 1989 shows about 98% of Costa Ricans were either white, castizos, mestizos, with 80% being white or caztizos.

===Philippines===

The Philippines is said to have the highest number of Eurasians in Asia and most of them are concentrated in the urban areas of Luzon and the Visayas. Most are descendants of Spanish and American settlers, as well as other European ethnicities who intermarried with people of indigenous, Chinese and Japanese descent. Significant intermarriage between Filipinos and European Americans has occurred since the United States colonial period up to the present day, as the US had numerous people stationed there at military bases. Aside from the more common Spanish mestizo, there are also Eurasians in the Philippines who have ancestries from various European countries. Because of a growing incidence of intermarriage between Filipinos and people from the Middle East, there is also a growing number of mestizos of mixed Filipino and Arab or Iranian ancestry, and a few of part Jewish descent. Because most Filipinos were given Spanish surnames by the Spanish governors during the colonial period, today's Eurasians of non-Spanish descent with Spanish surnames may be mistaken as Filipinos of Spanish descent, and that is how they are often presented in such circles as the film industry.

===United States===

According to the United States Census Bureau, concerning multi-racial families in 1990:U.S. Census Bureau, 2000
According to James P. Allen and Eugene Turner from California State University, Northridge, by some calculations, the largest part-European bi-racial population is European/Native American and Alaskan Native, at 7,015,017; followed by European/African at 737,492; then European/Asian at 727,197; and finally European/Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander at 125,628.http://www.csupomona.edu/~mreibel/2000_Census_Files/Allen-Turner.doc
The U.S. Census has categorized Eurasian responses in the "Some other race" section as belonging to the Asian category.  The Eurasian responses the US Census officially recognizes are Indo-European, Amerasian, and Eurasian.University of Michigan.  Census 1990: Ancestry Codes. August 27, 2007
Starting with the 2000 Census, people have been allowed to mark more than one "race" on the U.S. census, and many have identified as both Asian and European. Defining Eurasians as those who were marked as both "white" and "Asian" in the census, there were 868,395 Eurasians in the United States in 2000 and 1,623,234 in 2010.
Accusations of support for miscegenation were commonly made by slavery defenders against abolitionists before the US Civil War. After the War, similar charges were used by white segregationists against advocates of equal rights for African Americans. They were said to be secretly plotting the destruction of the white race through miscegenation. In the 1950s, segregationists alleged a Communist plot funded by the Soviet Union with that goal. In 1957, segregationists cite the anti-semitic hoax A Racial Program for the Twentieth Century as evidence for these claims.
From the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, the Chinese who migrated to the United States were almost entirely of Cantonese origin. Anti-miscegenation laws in many states prohibited Chinese men from marrying white women.Chin, Gabriel and Hrishi Karthikeyan, (2002) Asian Law Journal vol. 9 "Preserving Racial Identity: Population Patterns and the Application of Anti-Miscegenation Statutes to Asian Americans, 1910-1950" In the mid-1850s, 70 to 150 Chinese were living in New York City, and 11 of them married Irish women. In 1906 the New York Times (August 6) reported that 300 white women (Irish American) were married to Chinese men in New York, with many more cohabited. In 1900, based on Liang research, of the 120,000 men in more than 20 Chinese communities in the United States, he estimated that one out of every 20 Chinese men (Cantonese) was married to white women.Asian American children: a historical handbook and guide, By Benson Tong http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uK6xhcu-4hAC&pg=PA38&dq=+marriages+chinese+men+white+women&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8JcJT8HJBdT-8QOK262nAQ&ved=0CFQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%20marriages%20chinese%20men%20white%20women&f=false Interracial marriage for Chinese women with white men increases as more Chinese women migrated with equivalent number to Chinese men.

===Hawaii===

The majority of early Hawaiian Chinese were Cantonese-speaking migrants from Guangdong, with a small number of Hakka speakers. If all people with Chinese ancestry in Hawaii (including the Sino-Hawaiians) are included, they form about one-third of Hawaii's entire population. Many thousands of them married women of Hawaiian, Hawaiian/European and European origin. A large percentage of the Chinese men married Hawaiian and Hawaiian European women. While a minority married white women in Hawaii were with Portuguese women. The 12,592 Asiatic Hawaiians enumerated in 1930 were the result of Chinese men intermarrying with Hawaiian and part Hawaiian European. Most Asiatic Hawaiians men also married Hawaiians and European women (and vice versa). On the census some Chinese with little native blood would be classified as Chinese not an Asiatic Hawaiians due to dilution of native blood. Intermarriage started to decline in the 1920s.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GrvXiBNOsO0C&pg=PA154&dq=portuguese+women+marry+chinese&q=Portuguese%20women%20marry20%Chinese |title=Interracial Marriage in Hawaii|author=Romanzo Adams|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|location=|page=396|isbn=978-1-4179-9268-3|accessdate=2010-07-14[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a904831799|title=Interethnic Marriage and Divorce in Hawaii A Panel Study of 1968 First Marriages|author=Margaret M.

===Macau===

The early Macanese ethnic group was formed from Portuguese men with Malay, Japanese, Indian women.Macau, the imaginary city: culture and society, 1557 to the present The Portuguese encouraged Chinese migration to Macau, and most Macanese in Macau were formed from  between Portuguese and Chinese. In 1810, the total population of Macau was about 4033, of which 1172 were white men, 1830 were white women, 425 male slaves, and 606 female slaves. In 1830, the population increased to 4480 and the breakdown was 1,202 white men, 2149 white women, 350 male slaves and 779 female slaves. There is reason to speculate that large numbers of white women were involved in some forms of prostitution which would probably explain the abnormality in the ratio between men and women among the white population.macau - The Las Vegas of the East >>Inscrutable Chinese>>English>>北京仁和博苑中医药研究院 Majority of the early Chinese-Portuguese intermarriages were between Portuguese men and Chinese women of Tanka origin, who were considered the lowest class of Chinese had relations with Portuguese settlers and sailors,9781157453604 - Alibris MarketplaceBetween China and Europe: person, culture and emotion in Macao, By João de Pina-Cabral, page 164 http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GglrUksvCUcC&pg=PA165&dq=1980+portuguese+women+chinese+men+macau&hl=en&sa=X&ei=23QJT-mSDIaX8gPLzvWzBw&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=1980%20portuguese%20women%20chinese%20men%20macau&f=false while a minority were Cantonese men and Portuguese women. Macanese men and women also married with the Portuguese and Chinese, as a result some Macanese became indistinguishable from the Chinese or Portuguese population. Because the majority of the population who migrated to Macau were Cantonese, Macau became a culturally Cantonese-speaking society, other ethnic groups became fluent in Cantonese. Most Macanese had paternal Portuguese heritage until 1974. It was in 1980s that Macanese and Portuguese women began to marry men who defined themselves ethnically as Chinese,[ref]Between China and Europe: person, culture and emotion in Macau,

After the handover of Macau to China in 1999 many Macanese migrated to other countries. Of the Portuguese and Macanese women who stayed in Macau married with local Cantonese men, resulting in more Macanese with Cantonese paternal heritage. There are between 25,000-46,000 Macanese; 5,000-8,000 of whom live in Macau, while most live in Latin America (most particularly Brazil), America, and Portugal. Unlike the Macanese of Macau who are strictly of Chinese and Portuguese heritage, many Macanese living abroad are not entirely of Portuguese and Chinese ancestry; many Macanese men and women intermarried with the local population of America and Latin America etc. and have only partial Macanese heritage.

===Australia===

Most of the early Australian Chinese population consisted of Cantonese-speaking migrants from Guangzhou and Taishan as well as some from Fujian. They migrated to Australia during the gold rush period of the 1850s. Marriage records show that between the 1850s and the start of the twentieth century, there were about 2000 legal marriages between white women and migrant Chinese men in Australia’s eastern colonies, probably with similar numbers involved in de facto relationships of various kinds.Australian wives in China The rate of intermarriage declined as stories of the viciousness of Chinese men towards white women spread, mixed with increasing opposition to intermarriage. Rallies against Chinese men taking white women as wives became widespread as many white Australian men saw the intermarriage and cohabitation of Chinese men with white women as a threat to the white race. In late 1878, there were 181 marriages between women of European descent and Chinese men as well as 171 such couples cohabiting without matrimony, resulting in the birth of 586 children of Sino-European descent.Religion and retributive logic: essays in honour of professor Such a rate of intermarriage between Chinese Australians and white Australians was to continue until the 1930s.

===Indonesia===

The Eurasian community from Indonesia developed over a period of 400 years, it began with a mostly Portuguese Indonesian ancestry and ended with a dominant Dutch-Indonesian ancestry after the arrival of the Dutch East India Company in Indonesia in 1603 and near continuous Dutch rule until the Japanese occupation of Indonesia in World War II.

===Netherlands===

Dutch Eurasians of part Indonesian descent, also called Indos or Indo-Europeans, have largely assimilated in the Netherlands after arriving in the Netherlands following the end of World War II until 1965, their diaspora a result of Indonesia gaining its independence from Dutch colonial rule. Statistics show high inter marriage rates with native Dutch (50-80%). With over 500,000 persons, they are the largest ethnic minority in the Netherlands. So-called Indo rockers such as the Tielman Brothers introduced their blend of rock and roll music to Dutch audiences, whereas others gained fame as singers and TV presenters, such as Rob de Nijs and Sandra Reemer. There are also famous Indo soccer players such as Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Robin van Persie. Well-known politicians, such as Christian democrat Hans van den Broek and right-wing Geert Wilders, are also of Indo descent.

Interracial marriage was fairly common in Britain since the seventeenth century, when the British East India Company began bringing over thousands of Indian scholars, lascars and workers (mostly Bengali and/or Muslim) to Britain.  Most married and cohabited with local white British women and girls, due to the absence of Indian women in Britain at the time. This later became an issue, as a magistrate of the London Tower Hamlets area in 1817 expressed disgust at how the local British women and girls in the area were marrying and cohabiting with foreign South Asian lascars. Nevertheless, there were no legal restrictions against 'mixed' marriages in Britain, unlike the restrictions in India.[tpl]citation|title=Counterflows to Colonialism: Indian Traveller and Settler in Britain 1600-1857|first=Michael Herbert|last=Fisher|year=2006|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=81-7824-154-4|pages=106, 111–6, 119–20, 129–35, 140–2, 154–8, 160–8, 172, 181[/tpl][tpl]citation|title=Working across the Seas: Indian Maritime Labourers in India, Britain, and in Between, 1600–1857|first=Michael Herbert|last=Fisher|year=2006|journal=International of Social History|volume=51|pages=21–45|doi=10.1017/S0020859006002604[/tpl][tpl]citation|title=The Infidel Within: The History of Muslims in Britain, 1800 to the Present|first=Humayun|last=Ansari|year=2004|publisher=C.

They denounced white girls who mixed with Muslim Asian men as 'shameless' and called for a ban on the breeding of 'half-caste' children.  Such attempts at imposing anti-miscegenation laws were unsuccessful.[tpl]citation|title=The Infidel Within: The History of Muslims in Britain, 1800 to the Present|first=Humayun|last=Ansari|year=2004|publisher=C.

As of 2006, there are 246,400 'British Mixed-Race' people of European and South Asian descent.
There is also a small Eurasian community in Liverpool. The first Chinese settlers were mainly Cantonese from south China some were also from Shanghai. The figures of Chinese for 1921 are 2157 men and 262 women. Many Chinese men married British women while others remained single, possibly supporting a wife and family back home in China. During the second world war (1939-1945) another wave of Chinese seamen from Shanghai and of Cantonese origin married British women. Records show that about some 300 of these men had married British women and supported families.UK Chinese

===Korea===

U.S. military personnel married 6423 Korean women as war brides during and immediately after the Korean War. The average number of Korean women marrying US military personnel each year was about 1500 per year in the 1960s and 2300 per year in the 1970s.Eui-Young Yu and Earl H. Phillips, Korean women in transition: at home and abroad, Center for Korean-American and Korean Studies, California State University, Los Angeles, 1987, p. 185 ISBN 0-942831-00-4. Since the beginning of the Korean War in 1950, nearly 100,000 Korean women have immigrated to the United States as the wives of American soldiers.

===India===

The first use of the term 'Anglo-Indian' was to describe all British people living in India, regardless of whether they had Indian ancestors or not. This usage changed to describe people who were of the very specific lineage descending from the British on the male side and women from the Indian side.Stark, Herbert Alick. Hostages To India: OR The Life Story of the Anglo Indian Race. Third Edition. London: The Simon Wallenberg Press: Vol 2: Anglo Indian Heritage Books People of mixed British and Indian descent were previously referred to as simply 'Eurasians' but are now more commonly referred to as 'Anglo-Indians'.
During the British East India Company's rule in India in the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, it was initially fairly common for British officers and soldiers to take local Indian wives and have Eurasian children. Interracial marriages between European men and Indian women were very common during colonial times.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] The scholar Michael Fisher estimates that one in three European men in colonial India had Indian wives. The Europeans (mostly Portuguese, Dutch, French, German, Irish, Scottish, and English) were stationed in India in their youth, and looked for relationships with local women.[tpl]citation|title=Counterflows to Colonialism: Indian Traveller and Settler in Britain 1600-1857|first=Michael Herbert|last=Fisher|year=2006|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=81-7824-154-4|pages=111–9, 129–30, 140, 154–6, 160–8[/tpl] The most famous of such interracial liaisons was between the Hyderabadi noblewoman Khair-un-Nissa and the Scottish resident James Achilles Kirkpatrick. In addition to intermarriage, inter-ethnic prostitution in India existed. Generally, Muslim women did not marry European men because the men were not of the Islamic faith.
By the mid-nineteenth century, there were around 40,000 British soldiers but fewer than 2000 British officials present in India.[tpl]citation|title=Excluding and Including "Natives of India": Early-Nineteenth-Century British-Indian Race Relations in Britain|first=Michael H.|last=Fisher|journal=Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East|volume=27|issue=2|year=2007|pages=303–314 305|doi=10.1215/1089201x-2007-007[/tpl] As British women began arriving to British India in large numbers around the early-to-mid-nineteenth century, mostly as family members of British officers and soldiers, intermarriage with Indians became less frequent among the British in India.  After the events of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, such intermarriage was considered undesirable by both cultures.[tpl]citation|title=Vanishing Women: Magic, Film, and Feminism|first=Karen Redrobe|last=Beckman|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8223-3074-1|pages=31–3[/tpl]  The colonial government passed several anti-miscegenation laws.[tpl]citation|title=Converting Women|first=Eliza F.|last=Kent|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2004|isbn=0-19-516507-1|pages=85–6[/tpl][tpl]citation|title= Essay: Colonial Figures and Postcolonial Reading|first=Suvir|last=Kaul|journal=Diacritics|volume=26|issue=1|year=1996|pages=74–89 83–9|doi=10.1353/dia.1996.0005[/tpl] As a result, Eurasians became more marginal to both the British and Indian populations in India.
Over generations, Anglo-Indians intermarried with other Anglo-Indians to form a community that developed a culture of its own. They created distinctive Anglo-Indian, dress, speech and religion.  They established a school system focused on English language and culture, and formed social clubs and associations to run functions, such as regular dances, at holidays such as Christmas and Easter. Over time, the British colonial government recruited Anglo-Indians into the Customs and Excise, Post and Telegraphs, Forestry Department, the Railways and teaching professions, but they were employed in many other fields as well. A number of factors fostered a strong sense of community among Anglo-Indians. Their English-language school system, their Anglocentric culture, and their Christian beliefs helped bind them together.Maher, James, Reginald. (2007). These Are The Anglo Indians, London: Simon Wallenberg Press. (An Anglo Indian Heritage Book) Today, an estimated 300,000-1 million Anglo-Indians live in India.Fisher, Michael H.

===Sri Lanka===

Due to prolonged colonial contact with Portugal, the Netherlands and Britain, Sri Lanka has had a long history of intermarriage between locals and colonists. Originally these people were known as Mestiços, literally "mixed people" in Portuguese; today they are collectively classified as Burghers. The Sri Lankan Civil War has prompted numerous Burghers to flee the island.  Most have settled in Europe, the Americas, Australia and New Zealand.
Portuguese Burghers are usually descended from a Sri Lankan mother and a Portuguese father, or a Sri Lankan mother of Portuguese descent and a Sri Lankan father (the former is more common).  This configuration is also the case with the Dutch Burghers.  When the Portuguese arrived on the island in 1505, they were accompanied by African slaves.  Kaffirs are a mix of African, Portuguese colonist and Sri Lankan. The free mixing between the various groups of people was encouraged by the colonials.  Soon the Mestiços or the "Mixed People" began speaking a creole known as the Ceylonese-Portuguese Creole.  It was based on Portuguese, Sinhalese and Tamil.
The Burgher population numbers 40,000 in Sri Lanka and thousands more worldwide, concentrated mostly in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Phenotypically Burghers can have skin ranging from light to darker, depending on their ancestors, even within the same family.  Burghers with dark to light brown skin usually are of Portuguese Burghers or Kaffir ancestry; they may also have European facial features common to the Mediterranean basin (see Mediterraneans).  They have a distinct look compared to native Sri Lankans.  Most light-skinned Burghers are of Dutch or British descent.  Most Burghers are Roman Catholic in religion.
The long and rich colonial past of Sri Lanka left lasting impressions on the cultures and the languages of the island.  Both Sinhalaese and Sri Lankan (Ceylonese) Tamil contain numerous words from Portuguese, Dutch and English.
