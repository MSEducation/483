James Rupert Naden (13 July 1889 â€“ 14 June 1963) was an English cricketer: a right-handed batsman and right arm fast bowler who played two first-class games for Worcestershire in midsummer 1922.
He took his only two wickets (those of George Collins and Bill Ashdown) on debut against Kent, but that was in a Kent innings of 509/6 declared, and Worcestershire were demolished by an innings and 234 runs. In his other first-class game, against Gloucestershire a fortnight later, he did not take a wicket.
Naden was born in Tipton (which was then in Staffordshire); he died at the age of 73 in Turls Hill, Sedgley (also at the time in Staffordshire).
