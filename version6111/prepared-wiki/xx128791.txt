CATEGORIES: Botanical gardens in England, Gardens in Essex

The Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Hyde Hall in the English county of Essex east of London. It is one of four public gardens run by the Society, alongside Wisley, Harlow Carr, and Rosemoor. In the year ended 31 January 2010 it received 130,011 visitors.
The garden at Hyde Hall was created by Dr and Mrs Robinson in 1955. Hyde Hall was formerly a working farm on a hilltop surrounded by arable land. The site was cleared and 60 trees purchased from Wickford market a few miles away. These trees now form the Woodland Garden.
In the 1960s shelter belts of Lawson and Leyland cypress hedges were planted. During this decade the farmland to the west of the Hyde Hall hilltop was incorporated into the garden.
In 1976 Helen and Dick Robinson formed the Hyde Hall Garden Trust which would manage the garden on a long term basis. The trust donated Hyde Hall to the Royal Horticultural Society in 1993.
