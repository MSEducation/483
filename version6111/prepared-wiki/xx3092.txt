[[Electronegativity]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical properties, Chemical bonding

Electronegativity, symbol Ï‡, is a chemical property that describes the  tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself.[tpl]GoldBookRef|file=E01990|title=Electronegativity[/tpl] An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance that its valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus. The higher the associated electronegativity number, the more an element or compound attracts electrons towards it. First proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932 as a development of valence bond theory,[ref]
