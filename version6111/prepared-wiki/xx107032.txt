Bortezomib (BAN, INN and USAN. Originally codenamed PS-341; marketed as Velcade by Millennium Pharmaceuticals and Cytomib by Venus Remedies) is the first therapeutic proteasome inhibitor to be tested in humans. It is approved in the U.S. for treating relapsed multiple myelomaTakimoto CH, Calvo E.

In multiple myeloma, complete clinical responses have been obtained in patients with otherwise refractory or rapidly advancing disease.

==Origin and development==

Bortezomib was originally synthesized in 1995 at Myogenics. The drug (PS-341) was tested in a small Phase I clinical trial on patients with multiple myeloma cancer. It was brought to further clinical trials by Millenium Pharmaceuticals in October 1999.
In May 2003, seven years after the initial synthesis, bortezomib (Velcade) was approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in multiple myeloma, based on the results from the SUMMIT Phase II trial.[tpl]cite journal | author = Adams J, Kauffman M | title = Development of the Proteasome Inhibitor Velcade (Bortezomib) | journal = Cancer Invest | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 304–11 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15199612  | doi = 10.1081/CNV-120030218[/tpl]

==Pharmacology==

===Structure===

The drug is an N-protected dipeptide and can be written as Pyz-Phe-boroLeu, which stands for pyrazinoic acid, phenylalanine and Leucine with a boronic acid instead of a carboxylic acid. Peptides are written N-terminus to C-terminus, and this convention is used here even though the "C-terminus" is a boronic acid instead of a carboxylic acid.

===Mechanism===

The boron atom in bortezomib binds the catalytic site of the 26S proteasome[tpl]cite journal |author=Bonvini P, Zorzi E, Basso G, Rosolen A |title=Bortezomib-mediated 26S proteasome inhibition causes cell-cycle arrest and induces apoptosis in CD-30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma |journal=Leukemia |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=838–42 |year=2007 |pmid=17268529 |doi=10.1038/sj.leu.2404528[/tpl] with high affinity and specificity. In normal cells, the proteasome regulates protein expression and function by degradation of ubiquitylated proteins, and also cleanses the cell of abnormal or misfolded proteins. Clinical and preclinical data support a role in maintaining the immortal phenotype of myeloma cells, and cell-culture and xenograft data support a similar function in solid tumor cancers. While multiple mechanisms are likely to be involved, proteasome inhibition may prevent degradation of pro-apoptotic factors, permitting activation of programmed cell death in neoplastic cells dependent upon suppression of pro-apoptotic pathways. Recently, it was found that bortezomib caused a rapid and dramatic change in the levels of intracellular peptides that are produced by the proteasome.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gelman JS, Sironi J, Berezniuk I, Dasgupta S, Castro LM, Gozzo FC, Ferro ES, Fricker LD |title=Alterations of the intracellular peptidome in response to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib |journal = PLoS One |year = 2013 | issue = 8 | pages = e53263|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0053263| pmid=23308178 |editor1-last=Gartel |editor1-first=Andrei L |volume=8 |pmc=3538785[/tpl] Some intracellular peptides have been shown to be biologically active, and so the effect of bortezomib on the levels of intracellular peptides may contribute to the biological and/or side effects of the drug.

===Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics===

Bortezomib is rapidly cleared following intravenous administration.[tpl]cite journal |author=Voorhees PM, Dees EC, O'Neil B, Orlowski RZ |title=The proteasome as a target for cancer therapy |journal=Clin Cancer Res |volume=9 |issue=17 |pages=6316–25 |year=2003 |pmid=14695130 |doi=[/tpl] Peak concentrations are reached at about 30 minutes. Drug levels can no longer be measured after an hour. Pharmacodynamics are measured by measuring proteasome inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The much greater sensitivity of myeloma cell lines and mantle cell lines to proteasome inhibition compared with normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and most other cancer cell lines is poorly understood.

==Costs==

===UK===

NICE recommended against Velcade in Oct 2006 due to its cost.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6069386.stm | title=NHS watchdog rejects cancer drug | accessdate=2009-08-14 | publisher=BBC News UK | date=20 October 2006[/tpl]

==Adverse effects==

Bortezomib is associated with peripheral neuropathy in 30% of patients; occasionally, it can be painful.  This can be worse in patients with pre-existing neuropathy. In addition, myelosuppression causing neutropenia and thrombocytopenia can also occur and be dose-limiting. However, these side effects are usually mild relative to bone marrow transplantation and other treatment options for patients with advanced disease. Bortezomib is associated with a high rate of shingles,[tpl]cite journal | author=Oakervee HE, Popat R, Curry N, et al. | title=PAD combination therapy (PS-341/bortezomib, doxorubicin and dexamethasone) for previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma | journal=Br J Haematol | volume=129 | issue=6 | pages=755–62 | year=2005 | pmid=15953001 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05519.x[/tpl] although prophylactic acyclovir can reduce the risk of this.[tpl]cite journal | author=Pour L., Adam Z., Buresova L., et al. | title=Varicella-zoster virus prophylaxis with low-dose acyclovir in patients with multiple myeloma treated with bortezomib | journal=Clinical Lymphoma & Myeloma | volume=9 | issue=2 | pages=151–3 | year=2009 | pmid=19406726 | doi=10.3816/CLM.2009.n.036[/tpl]

==Therapeutic efficacy==

Two open-label, phase II trials (SUMMIT and CREST) established the efficacy of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 (with or without dexamethasone) administered by intravenous bolus on days 1,4,8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle for a maximum of eight cycles in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.[tpl]cite journal |title=Bortezomib: A Review of its Use in Patients with Multiple Myeloma |author=Curran M, McKeage K. |url=http://adisonline.com/drugs/abstract/2009/69070/Bortezomib__A_Review_of_its_Use_in_Patients_with.6.aspx |journal=Drugs |year=2009 |volume=69 |issue=7 |pages=859–888 |doi=10.2165/00003495-200969070-00006 |pmid=19441872[/tpl] [tpl]doi|10.2165/00003495-200969070-00006[/tpl]. The phase III APEX trial demonstrated the superiority of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 over a high-dose dexamethasone regimen (e.g. median TTP 6.2 vs 3.5 months, and 1-year survival 80% vs 66%).
