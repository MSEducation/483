When Constantinople fell in 1453 he left it for the Peloponnesus and in 1456 took refuge in Italy where he worked as a teacher in the revival of Greek philosophy in the universities of Padua, Florence and Rome and as head of the Greek department at Florence’s ‘Florentine Studium’ university.[tpl]Cite book|author= Hancock, Lee |title= Lorenzo de' Medici: Florence's great leader and patron of the arts |publisher= The Rosen Publishing Group |year= 2005 |page=35 |isbn= 9781404203150 |quote= He learned Greek from Johannis Argyropoulos (circa 1416-1486), who was the head of the Greek department at the city’s university, called Florentine Studium.[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34066/John-Argyropoulos|title= John Argyropoulos.|publisher= www.britannica.com |accessdate=2009-10-02|last=|first=|quote= When Constantinople fell in 1453 he left it for the Peloponnese and in 1456 took refuge in Italy.[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|author= Rabil, Albert |title= Knowledge, goodness, and power: the debate over nobility among quattrocento Italian humanists |publisher= Medieval & Renaissance Texts & Studies |year= 1991 |page=197 |isbn= 0-86698-100-4[/tpl] In 1471, on the outbreak of the plague, he moved to Rome, where he continued to act as a teacher of Greek till his death.
He made efforts to transport Greek philosophy to Western Europe. He had students such as Pietro de' Medici and Lorenzo de' Medici, Angelo Poliziano and Johann Reuchlin.
It is well known that students hailing from different parts of Europe came to see and hear him at those classes, when he taught Greek and philosophy courses. Leonardo da Vinci probably attended the lectures of Argyropoulos.[ref]This conclusion is based on researches such as

He was a member of the Byzantine delegation to the Council of Ferrara-Florence and left a number of Latin translations, including many of Aristotle's works. His principal works were translations of the following portions of Aristotle, Categoriae, De Interpretatione, Analytica Posteriora, Physica, De Caelo, De Anima, Metaphysica, Ethica Nicomachea, Politica; and an Expositio Ethicorum Aristotelis. Several of his writings exist still in manuscript.
He died on June 26, 1487 at Florence, supposedly of consuming too much watermelon.Harris, Jonathan, The End of Byzantium (Yale University Press, 2011), p. 348.
