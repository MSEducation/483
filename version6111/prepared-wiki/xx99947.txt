The Ufton Nervet rail crash was a train crash between a train and car near Ufton Nervet, Berkshire, England in 2004. Seven people, including the drivers of both the train and the car, were killed.

==Collision==

On 6 November 2004 at 18:12 GMT, the First Great Western 17:35 service from [tpl]rws|London Paddington[/tpl] to [tpl]rws|Plymouth[/tpl], an InterCity 125 (HST) led by a Class 43 power car (43019) collided with a stationary automobile at an automatic level crossing close to the rural West Berkshire village of Ufton Nervet. The inquest concluded that the crash was caused by Brian Drysdale, a chef at the nearby Wokefield Park Hotel, attempting suicide by parking his car on the crossing.
The rear of the [tpl]convert|220|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long InterCity 125 train came to rest about [tpl]convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on[/tpl] beyond the crossing with all eight coaches derailed. Six people were killed in the crash: the car's driver, the driver of the train, and four of its passengers.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3989277.stm |title=Six die as train ploughs into car |date=7 November 2004 |accessdate=3 June 2010 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl] A fifth passenger died in hospital. About 200 people were on board at the time of the incident (official estimates are around 180–200). About half of these were injured, 12 of them seriously. 11 people were cut free from the wreckage. The high structural integrity of the Mark 3 coaches prevented a much higher death toll, plus the fact that the more lightly loaded first class coaches were at the leading end of the train.
The crash, investigation and necessary repairs blocked the main railway route between London and the West Country until the morning of 16 November, subsequently operating under temporary speed restrictions to allow the bedding in of ballast. In the meantime InterCity trains operated via [tpl]rws|Swindon[/tpl] and [tpl]rws|Westbury[/tpl] and local services were replaced by rail and bus shuttles.

===Background===

In the United Kingdom, automatic half-barrier level crossings (AHB) are used on roads where traffic is unlikely to queue across the crossing and where rail line-speed is not more than [tpl]convert|100|mph|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/rspg-2e-levxngs.pdf |format=PDF |title=Railway Safety Principles and Guidance, part 2, section E, Guidance on level crossings |publisher=HSE Books |date=2005 |accessdate=13 October 2010[/tpl] There are no means of checking that the crossing is not obstructed before the passage of a train. The half barriers close the road to traffic approaching the crossing but allow any vehicle still crossing to escape.[tpl]cite book |last=Leach |first=Maurice |authorlink= Institution of Railway Signal Engineers |title=Railway Control Systems |place=London |publisher=A & C Black |year=1991 |isbn=0-7136-3420-0 [/tpl] However, this does not physically prevent road users from zigzagging around the barriers and crossing the line, usually in an attempt to save time.

===Site===

The crash was at a level crossing on the narrow lane linking the village of Ufton Nervet to the Bath Road (A4), about [tpl]convert|300|m|yd|abbr=on[/tpl] from their junction. The crossing is between [tpl]rws|Theale[/tpl] and [tpl]rws|Aldermaston[/tpl] stations. The train was not scheduled to stop at either station.

===Investigation===

An investigation was carried out by Thames Valley Police and British Transport Police. A preliminary report by the Health and Safety Executive indicated that the car stopped on the level crossing before any warnings and failed to react to the barrier alarm sequence. A minor deflection of the stationary car to one side by the train derailed the forward bogie, which continued to travel at about 25° to the rails until reaching the points at the start of a loop. At this point the power car derailed completely, causing the remainder of the train to derail.
In the absence of information from the investigation, local and news media speculation centred on the theory that Bryan Drysdale, the car's driver, might have parked on the level crossing in order to attempt suicide, because there was no evidence of any attempt to move or exit the car.
The Rail Safety and Standards Board published a preliminary report on 1 February 2005[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rssb.co.uk/pdf/reports/Ufton%20-%20Preliminary%20Report.pdf |date=25 January 2005 |accessdate=3 June 2010 |format=PDF |publisher=Rail Safety and Standards Board |location=London, United Kingdom |title=Formal Inquiry: Preliminary Report: Ufton Level Crossing Passenger Train Collision with a Road Vehicle and Subsequent Derailment, 06 November 2004[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] which stated:
On 1 June 2005 it was announced that an inquest into the crash would be held at the Guildhall in Windsor, Berkshire.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/4599813.stm |title=Inquest into Ufton Nervet crash |date=1 June 2005 |accessdate=3 June 2010 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl] The inquest was expected to last 12 days, starting on 17 October 2005. It had been delayed due to a dispute over whether the families of the victims should be granted legal aid.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/4406490.stm |title=Memorial for rail crash victims |publisher=BBC News |date=5 November 2005 |accessdate=3 June 2010[/tpl] The inquest finally began in October 2007. A policeman who had witnessed the crash, PC Brazier, testified at the inquest. He told the jury that he believed the crash was caused by a suicide attempt.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/7048929.stm |title=Rail crash was 'suicide attempt' |date=17 October 2007 |accessdate=3 June 2010 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl] The Forensic Accident Investigator, David Price, told the inquest that he had been able to determine that the car had been parked on the level crossing with its engine switched off, the handbrake fully applied, the vehicle's lights switched off, the steering on a partial left hand lock (which was not consistent with driving across the crossing), and that its fuel tank still contained at least 8 litres (about 2 gallons) of petrol.
On 1 November 2007 the inquest returned the verdict that the crash was caused by Brian Drysdale's (completed) attempt at suicide.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/7072672.stm |title=Rail crash was caused by suicide |publisher=BBC News |date=1 November 2007 |accessdate=3 June 2010[/tpl]
A support network, the Ufton Nervet Train Crash Network,Ufton Nervet Train Crash Network was set up for survivors and relatives of the victims.

===2011 near miss===

There was a near miss at the same level crossing on 4 September 2011. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch is investigating the cause, which may have been an error or omission by rail staff.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.raib.gov.uk/publications/current_investigations_register/110904_ufton.cfm |title= RAIB Investigation into an incident at Ufton level crossing between Theale and Aldermaston stations, Berkshire, on 4 September 2011[/tpl]

===2012 fatality===

At 1310 hrs on 22 May 2012 the 1218 hrs InterCity 125 express from Paddington to [tpl]rws|Taunton[/tpl] hit a motor scooter on the crossing, killing the rider, David Montague.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/news/around/articles/2012/05/23/59782-ufton-nervet-train-crash-victim-named/ |newspaper=Reading Chronicle |title=Ufton Nervet train crash victim named |date=23 May 2012 |accessdate=6 July 2012[/tpl] The train driver was slightly injured[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-18159556 |title= Moped rider killed in Ufton Nervet level crossing crash |publisher=BBC |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=6 July 2012[/tpl] and the line was closed until 1930 hrs that day. British Transport Police reports that the crossing was working correctly when the collision happened. The RAIB is investigating the collision.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.newburytoday.co.uk/2012/ufton-nervet-crash-victim-named |newspaper=Newbury Weekly News |title=Ufton Nervet crash victim named |last=Taylor |first=Mark |date=23 May 2012 |accessdate=6 July 2012[/tpl]

===Future of the crossing===

In July 2012 an Internet petition was started by Liberal Democrat members of West Berkshire Council[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-18736317 |title=Rail crash level crossing at Ufton Nervet: Bridge considered |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=6 July 2012[/tpl] and a Hungerford resident[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/make-ufton-nervet-level-crossing-safer |title=Make Ufton Nervet Level Crossing Safer |last=Hudson |first=Simon |publisher=change.org |accessdate=6 July 2012[/tpl] to lobby for full barriers and closed circuit television to be installed at the level crossing.  The petition closed with 148 votes of support.
On 6 July 2012, Network Rail announced that it was considering either converting the crossing to full barriers "or even consideration for a bridge", and that the latter would have the advantage that NR could safely increase train speeds on that part of the line. NR said it would decide whether to implement either of these options in "about three or four months".
