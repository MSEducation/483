Graber was also subsequently involved by carrying out a "mercy killing".  Graber  made an arrangement with the government to plead guilty to a reduced charge of aggravated assault. A team of civilian and military lawyers defended Clagett, Hunsaker, and Girouard in Article 32 proceedings (military equivalent to a grand jury) in Tikrit, Iraq and Courts Martial proceedings in Fort Campbell, KY.  Graber was defended by two military lawyers in the same proceedings, but was considered to be separate from the other three soldiers.  After eight months of legal battles, defendant Graber agreed to testify against Hunsaker and the other defendants. Facing mandatory life sentences, Hunsaker and Clagett entered plea deals that reduced their maximum sentence to 18 years, making them eligible for parole after 5Â½ years.
