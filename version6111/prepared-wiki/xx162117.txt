CATEGORIES: Farm to Market Roads in Texas

Farm to Market Road 526, or FM 526 or Urban Road 526 (UR 526), is a state highway entirely inside the city of Houston, Texas.  Locally, the road is now known as Maxey Road. The road runs from  I-10 north to US 90 Business.
The road was established in 1941 as a spur from U.S. Highway 90, then the main route east from Houston, to the Market Street Road.  In 1961, the road was shortened to State Highway 73, which later became Interstate 10. In 1995, the state of Texas re-designated the road as Urban Road 526, but like FM 525 to the northwest, people rarely refer to the road as a state highway.
