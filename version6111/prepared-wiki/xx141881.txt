EudraPharm (European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Pharmaceutical Database) is the database of medicinal products authorised in the European Union, and includes the information contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics, the patient or user package leaflet and the information shown on the labelling. The EudraPharm database is accessible to the general public and the information thus made available is worded in an appropriate and comprehensible manner. 
The EudraPharm database of authorised medicinal products is foreseen in the EU Regulation 726/2004.
EudraPharm contains only details of products that were licensed using the Centralised procedure.  Therefore for human medicines, it is only a new interface for information that was and still is available via the EPARs section at the EMEA.
