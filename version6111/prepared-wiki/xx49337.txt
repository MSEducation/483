Sevigny made her film debut with a leading role in the controversial film Kids (1995), written by Harmony Korine, which led to an Independent Spirit Award nomination for her performance. A long line of roles in generally well-received independent and often avant-garde films throughout the decade established Sevigny's reputation as an indie film queen.[tpl]cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/fashion/article6280331.ece |title=Chloë Sevigny, queen of cool |author=Jessica Brinton |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |work=The Times |location=London  | date=May 17, 2009[/tpl] In 1999, Sevigny won eight acting awards and gained serious critical and commercial recognition for her first mainstream role in the critically lauded Boys Don't Cry, for which she also received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress. Sevigny continued acting in mostly independent art house films, such as American Psycho (2000), Party Monster (2003), and Dogville (2003). Her role in the art house film The Brown Bunny (2003) caused significant controversy because of a scene where she performs unsimulated fellatio. Her films since then have included Melinda and Melinda (2004), Manderlay (2005), Zodiac (2007) and My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done? (2009).
From 2006 to 2011, Sevigny played a leading role in the HBO television series Big Love, for which she received a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress in 2010.

Between her junior and senior year of high school, Sevigny even shaved her head and sold her hair to a Broadway wigmaker. She openly admitted to experimenting with drugs as a teenager, especially hallucinogens, but said she was never a "good drug user". Sevigny has commented that her father was aware of her experimentation with hallucinogens and marijuana, and even told her that it was "alright, but to stop if she had bad trips"."Chloe: New York Doll", The Face, February 1, 1997. Despite her father's leniency, her mother later chose to send her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In 2007, she told The Times, "I had a great family life[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]I would never want it to look as if it reflected on them. I think I was very bored, and I did just love taking hallucinogens ... But I often feel it's because I experimented when I was younger that I have no interest as an adult. I know a lot of adults who didn't, and it's much more dangerous when you start experimenting drugs as an adult." She often described herself as a "loner" and a "depressed teenager." Her only extracurricular activity was occasionally skateboarding with her older brother, and she spent most of her free time in her bedroom: "Mostly I sewed. I had nothing better to do, so I made my own clothes."
As a teenager, Sevigny would occasionally cut school in Darien to go into Manhattan.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/meredith-barnett/andrea-linett-on-sassy-di_b_815063.html|title=Andrea Linett on how she discovered Chloe Sevigny|last=Barnett|first=Meredith|work=Huffington Post|date=February 1, 2011|accessdate=August 31, 2012[/tpl] There, in 1992 at age 17, she was spotted on an East Village street by Andrea Linett, a fashion editor of Sassy magazine, who was so impressed by Sevigny's style that she asked her to model for the magazine, she was later made an intern. When recounting the event, Sevigny was reluctant about it: "The woman at Sassy just liked the hat I was wearing," she said. She later modeled in the magazine as well as for X-girl, the subsidiary fashion label of the Beastie Boys' "X-Large", designed by Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, which then led to an appearance in the music video for Sugar Kane. In 1993, at age 18, straight after her high-school graduation, Sevigny relocated from her Connecticut hometown to an apartment in Brooklyn.  During that time, author Jay McInerney spotted her around New York City and wrote a seven-page article about her for The New Yorker in which he dubbed her the new "it-girl" and referred to her as one of the "coolest girls in the world"."Chloe's Scene", The New Yorker, November 7, 1994, pp 182–192 She subsequently appeared on the album cover of Gigolo Aunts' 1994 recording Flippin' Out and the EP Full-On Bloom,[tpl]cite web |title=Biography of Chloe Sevigny |url=http://www.allamericanspeakers.com/speakers/Chloe-Sevigny/9687 |work=AllAmericanSpeakers.com|accessdate=January 22, 2008[/tpl] as well as a Lemonheads music video.

==Career==

===1995–99: Early work===

Sevigny encountered young screenwriter and aspiring director Harmony Korine in Washington Square Park in New York City during her senior year of high school in 1993.[tpl]cite web |title=Harmony Korine Official Website |url=http://www.harmony-korine.com/paper/index/i_kids.html|work=Harmony Korine.com |accessdate=January 8, 2010[/tpl] The two became close friends, which resulted in her being cast in the low-budget independent film Kids (1995).[tpl]cite web |title=Chloe Sevigny Films |url=http://www.chloesevigny.info/films_page1.html |work=Chloe Sevigny.info. |accessdate=January 7, 2010[/tpl] Directed by Larry Clark and written by Korine, Sevigny plays a New York teenager who discovers she is HIV-positive. According to Sevigny, she was originally cast in a much smaller role in the film, but ended up replacing Canadian actress Mia Kirshner. Just two days before production began, the leading role went to the then-19-year-old Sevigny, who had no professional acting experience;[tpl]cite web |title=Buzzine |url=http://www.buzzine.com/2007/03/chloe-sevigny/|work=Buzzine Interview with Chloe Sevigny for Zodiac|accessdate=January 8, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/summer1995/rascals.php |accessdate=January 11, 2010 |title=Filmmaker Magazine|work=Peter Bowen on Larry Clarke's Kids|accessdate=January 8, 2010[/tpl] she said of her casting in the role, "Harmony Korine just thought I was this sweet, cute girl and he liked my blonde hair." Nonetheless, Kids was controversial; the film was given an NC-17 rating by the Motion Picture Association of America for its graphic depiction of sexuality and recreational substance and drug use involving teenagers."Controversy: 'Kids' for Adults," Newsweek, February 20, 1995. Despite its controversy, Kids was taken note of critically and commercially: respected film critic Janet Maslin considered the film a "wake-up call to the modern world" about the nature of the youth in urban life at the time.Kids at Rotten Tomatoes; last accessed May 22, 2007. Sevigny's performance was praised, with critics noting that she brought a tenderness to the chaotic, immoral nature of the film: "Sevigny provided the warm, reflective center in this feral film".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2008/02/20/2003402141/4|title=Chloe will be Chloe|work=The Guardian New York|last=Gillbey|first=Ryan|date=February 20, 2008|accessdate=August 31, 2012[/tpl] She ended up receiving an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Supporting Female.
Sevigny followed Kids with actor/director Steve Buscemi's independent film Trees Lounge (1996), starring in a relatively small role as Buscemi's object of affection. During this time, director Mary Harron (after having seen Kids) offered Sevigny a minor part in her film, I Shot Andy Warhol (1996). Harron tracked Sevigny down to the SoHo clothing store Liquid Sky, where she was working at the time. Sevigny then gave her first audition ever, but ultimately decided to turn down the part; she would later work with Harron on American Psycho (2000). Instead of taking the part in I Shot Andy Warhol, Sevigny starred in and worked as a fashion designer on Gummo (1997),[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/feb/16/fashion|title=Chloë's world: Ryan Gilbey meet actress Chloë Sevigny|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=February 16, 2008|accessdate=January 7, 2010 [/tpl] directed and written by Harmony Korine, who was romantically involved with Sevigny during filming.[tpl]cite news|title=Style stolen in Gummo|author=Chicago Sun Times|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4431443.html|accessdate=January 19, 2010[/tpl] Gummo was as controversial as Sevigny's debut; set in Xenia, Ohio, the film depicts an array of nihilistic characters in a poverty-stricken small-town America, and presents issues such as drug and sexual abuse as well as anti-social alienated youth in Midwestern America.[tpl]cite news|work=Variety|title=Gummo|accessdate=9 November 2009|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117329547.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 | first=Emanuel | last=Levy | date=September 14, 1997[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmratings.com/filmRatings_Cara/|title=Classification information for Gummo|accessdate=July 12, 2010[/tpl] In retrospection to the confronting nature of the film, Sevigny cited it as one of her favorite projects: "Young people love that movie. It's been stolen from every Blockbuster in America. It's become a cult film". The film was dedicated to Sevigny's father, who died prior to the film's release.Note: "This film is dedicated to David Sevigny, a beautiful sailor"; seen in the end credits of Gummo.
After Gummo, Sevigny starred in the neo-noir thriller Palmetto (1998), playing a young Florida kidnapee alongside Woody Harrelson. She then had a leading role as a Hampshire College graduate in the sardonic period piece The Last Days of Disco (1998), alongside Kate Beckinsale. The film was written and directed by cult director Whit Stillman and details the rise and fall of the Manhattan club scene in the "very early 1980s".Note: It is stated clearly at the beginning of The Last Days of Disco that the film is set in the "very early 80s". Stillman said of Sevigny: "Chloë is a natural phenomenon. You're not directing, she's not performing—it's just real." Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that Sevigny "is seductively demure" in her performance as Alice.[tpl]cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0DE7DE1038F93AA15756C0A96E958260&partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes|title=Film Review: Last Days of Disco, Night Life of the [tpl]sic|hide=y|the[/tpl] Young, Urban and Genteel|last=Maslin|first=Janet|date=May 28, 1998|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 1, 2010[/tpl] The film was generally well received, but was not a box-office success in the United States, only grossing $3 million[tpl]cite web|title=The Last Days of Disco |publisher=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lastdaysofdisco.htm |accessdate=April 14, 2009[/tpl]—it has since become somewhat of a success as a cult film.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/the-last-days-of-disco-the-criterion-collection/1587|title=The Last Days of Disco: The Criterion Collection|last=Lanthier|first=Joseph|date=August 25, 2009|work=Slant Magazine|accessdate=January 8, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=MoMA PopRally – The Last Days of Disco|work=The Museum of Modern Art|url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/events/7167[/tpl]
Aside from film work, Sevigny starred in a 1998 Off-Broadway production of Hazelwood Jr. High, which tells the true story of the 1992 murder of Shanda Sharer; Sevigny played seventeen-year-old Laurie Tackett, one of four girls responsible for savagely torturing and murdering twelve-year-old Sharer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9c02e1d81131f935a35750c0a96e958260|work=New York Times|date=March 6, 1998|accessdate=June 17, 2010|author=Brantley, Ben|title=THEATER REVIEW; Indiana School Days: Reading, Writing and Murder[/tpl] Sevigny was reportedly so emotionally disturbed after playing the role that she began attending Catholic Mass again.

Following Boys Don't Cry, Sevigny had a supporting role in American Psycho, based on the controversial 1991 novel by Bret Easton Ellis. Sevigny plays the office assistant of Patrick Bateman, played by Christian Bale, a 1980s Manhattan yuppie-turned-serial killer. The film, as was its source novel, was controversial because of its depiction of graphic violence and sexuality in an upper-class Manhattan society.[tpl]cite news | last= Corliss | first= Richard | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,995904,00.html | title=Sundance Sorority | work=Time | date=January 24, 2000 | accessdate=March 22, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=DVD Review – American Psycho (Unrated version)|work=The Digital Bits|date=October 2, 2000|author=Kelly, Dan|url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/reviews/americanpsycho.html[/tpl] In addition, she reunited with Kids writer and Gummo director Harmony Korine for the experimental Julien Donkey-Boy (1999), playing the pregnant sister of a schizophrenic man. Though it never saw a major theatrical release, it garnered some critical praise; Roger Ebert gave the film his signature thumbs up, referring to it as "Freaks shot by the Blair Witch crew", and continuing to say, "The odds are good that most people will dislike this film and be offended by it. For others, it will provoke sympathy rather than scorn".[tpl]cite news|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=November 5, 1999|author=Ebert, Roger|title=Julien Donkey-Boy Review|accessdate=February 13, 2010|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19991105/REVIEWS/911050303/1023[/tpl] Sevigny followed Julien with a small part in the drama film A Map of the World (1999), opposite Sigourney Weaver.
Between 1998 and 2000, Sevigny moved back to Connecticut to live with her mother,[tpl]cite news|title=The Brown Bunny girl bites back | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3595378/The-Brown-Bunny-girl-bites-back.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London|accessdate=March 29, 2010  | first=Catherine | last=Shoard | date=May 27, 2003[/tpl] and appeared as a lesbian in the Emmy Award-winning television movie If These Walls Could Talk 2 (2000), the sequel to the HBO television drama-film If These Walls Could Talk (1996). Sevigny reportedly took the role in the film in order to help pay her mother's mortgage payment, and has credited it as the only film she ever made for financial benefit. Following this appearance, Sevigny was approached for a supporting role in the 2001 comedy Legally Blonde alongside Reese Witherspoon and offered $500,000; she declined and the role was given to Selma Blair. Instead, she starred in Olivier Assayas' French techno thriller Demonlover (2002) alongside Connie Nielsen, for which she was required to learn her lines in French. Sevigny described shooting the film as "strange", in the sense that director Assayas hardly spoke to her during the filming, which she said was difficult because of the lack of "input".[tpl]cite video|title=Demonlover|date=2003|medium=DVD|publisher=Lions Gate Films/PALM Media|people=Sevigny, Chloë[/tpl] After spending nearly three months in France to complete Demonlover, Sevigny returned to New York to film the club kid biopic, Party Monster (2003); coincidentally, Sevigny in fact knew several of the people depicted in the film (Michael Alig and James St. James included), whom she met during her frequent trips to New York City's club scene as a teenager.
Sevigny then obtained a role in Lars von Trier's parable film Dogville (2003), playing one of the various residents of a small mountain town, alongside Nicole Kidman, Lauren Bacall, and Paul Bettany; the film received mixed reactions, and was criticized by critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper as being "anti-American".[tpl]cite news|title=Roger Ebert reviews "Dogville"|date=April 9, 2004|accessdate=February 27, 2010|author=Ebert, Roger|work=Chicago Sun-Times|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040409/REVIEWS/404090303/1023[/tpl] Sevigny re-united with former Boys Don't Cry star Peter Sarsgaard for the biographical film Shattered Glass (2003), also alongside Hayden Christensen, about the career of Stephen Glass, a journalist whose reputation is destroyed when his widespread journalistic fraud was exposed. Sevigny played a co-editor of Glass's.

===2003–06: The Brown Bunny and aftermath===

In 2003, Sevigny took on the lead female role in the art house film The Brown Bunny (2003), which details a lonely traveling motorcycle racer reminiscing about his former lover. The film achieved notoriety for its final scene, which involves Sevigny performing unsimulated fellatio on co-star and director Vincent Gallo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/news/2006/10/sidebar-a-brief-history-of-rea.php|work=Independent Film Channel (IFC)|date=October 4, 2006|title=A Brief History of Real Sex on Screen (Well, Without the Porn)|author=Orange, Michelle|accessdate=September 22, 2009[/tpl] The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, and opened to significant controversy and criticism from both audiences and critics alike.[tpl]cite news |title=Week in Review |author=Joe Bob Briggs |newspaper=Upi.com |date=June 9, 2003 |url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2003/06/09/Week-in-Review-by-Joe-Bob-Briggs/UPI-30191055188066/ |accessdate=January 8, 2010 [/tpl] She went on to defend the movie, "It's a shame people write so many things when they haven't seen it.

Despite the backlash toward the film, some critics praised Sevigny's performance; Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, "Actresses have been asked and even bullied into performing similar acts for filmmakers since the movies began, usually behind closed doors. Ms. Sevigny isn't hiding behind anyone's desk. She says her lines with feeling and puts her iconoclasm right out there where everyone can see it; she may be nuts, but she's also unforgettable."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/27/movies/film-review-the-narcissist-and-his-lover.html|work=New York Times|date=August 27, 2004|accessdate=January 29, 2010|title=FILM REVIEW: The Narcissist and His Lover|author=Dargis, Manohla[/tpl] Roger Ebert, although critical of The Brown Bunny, nevertheless noted that Sevigny brought "a truth and vulnerability" to the film.[tpl]cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040903/REVIEWS/409020301/1023|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Ebert, Roger|date=September 3, 2004|accessdate=March 19, 2010|title=The Brown Bunny[/tpl]
Despite her agency's disapproval of the film (and fear that the actress might have forever tarnished her career), she continued on with various projects. Sevigny had a major supporting role as a fellow Manhattanite in Woody Allen's two-sided tragicomedy, Melinda and Melinda (2004), which Sevigny referred to as being a "pleasing" experience. She subsequently guest-starred on the popular television show Will & Grace, and a string of film roles followed, including a small role in Lars von Trier's sequel to Dogville, titled Manderlay (2005), as well as a bit part alongside Bill Murray in Broken Flowers (2005). Sevigny also played one of several lovers of New York doctor Herman Tarnower in the HBO television film Mrs. Harris (2005) alongside Annette Bening and Ben Kingsley. Sevigny then had a major role as a Catholic nun visiting Africa in one of three stories in 3 Needles (2005), an anthology dealing with the prevalence of AIDS in various parts of the world. Sevigny's performance in the film was praised; Dennis Harvey of Variety called her performance in the film "convincing",[tpl]cite news|date=October 5, 2005|author=Harvey, Dennis|work=Variety|accessdate=January 15, 2010|title=3 Needles Review: Variety|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117928409.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0[/tpl] while Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times also referred to Sevigny as "ever-daring and shrewd".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-needles1dec01,0,708560.story|work=Los Angeles Times|author=Thomas, Kevin|title=3 Needles Movie Review|date=December 1, 2006|accessdate=January 15, 2010[/tpl] Shortly after 3 Needles, Sevigny played the lead character in the experimental indie-film Lying (2006) with Jena Malone and Leelee Sobieski, playing a pathological liar who gathers three female acquaintances for a weekend at her upstate New York country house; the film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2006. She also had a leading part in Douglas Buck's 2006 remake of the Brian De Palma horror film Sisters (1973).

===2006–11: Big Love===

In 2006, Sevigny began her five-season run in the HBO television series Big Love, about a family of fundamentalist Mormon polygamists. She played Nicolette Grant, the conniving, shopaholic daughter of a cult leader and second wife to a polygamist husband, played by Bill Paxton. Sevigny found even more mainstream success with a role in her first big-budget production[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.femail.com.au/chloe-sevigny-zodiac-interview.htm|work=Femail.au|title=Chloe Goes Mainstream: Chloe Sevigny Zodiac Interview|year=2007|accessdate=February 2, 2010|author=Fischer, Paul[/tpl] as Robert Graysmith's wife Melanie in David Fincher's Zodiac (2007), telling the true story of San Francisco's infamous Zodiac killer. In 2009, Sevigny starred in the independent psychological thriller film The Killing Room, and Werner Herzog's My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done, a crime horror film based on murderer Mark Yavorsky, produced by David Lynch.

In January 2010, Sevigny won a Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for her performance in the third season of Big Love. The series itself also received nominations in two other categories.[tpl]cite web|title=HFPA News: 67th Golden Globe Award Nominations|date=15 December 2009|work=Hollywood Foreign Press Association|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/news/id/159[/tpl] During a press conference following the award win, Sevigny addressed the repressed women living in the fundamentalist Mormon compounds: "These women are kept extremely repressed.

In a later interview with The A.V. Club, Sevigny was asked if she felt that the show's message was that polygamy was "wrong". In response, Sevigny stated: "No, absolutely not. I think there are more parallels to gay rights and alternative lifestyles within Big Love—more so than “Polygamy is wrong.” I think they actually condone people who decide to live this lifestyle outside of fundamentalist sects."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/chloe-sevigny,39476/|work=The A.V.

"didn't want them to think that I was biting the hand that feeds me, because I obviously love the show and have always been nothing but positive about it. And I didn’t want anybody to misunderstand me or think that I wasn’t, you know, appreciative."
In March 2010, Sevigny attended the South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin for the premiere of both Barry Munday and Mr. Nice;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cinematical.com/2010/03/15/kick-ass-females-of-sxsw-chloe-sevigny/|work=Cinematical|title=Kick-Ass Females of SXSW: Chloe Sevigny|author=Yamato, Jen|date=March 15, 2010|accessdate=March 22, 2010[/tpl] Barry Munday was picked up for distribution by Magnolia Pictures several months later.

While her sense of style in the early 1990s only reflected small downtown scenes and trends, it still made a significant impression on high class fashion chains which began to emulate Sevigny's look. Her interest in fashion and clothing, as well as her career as a fashion model in her late teenage years and early twenties, have led to a career as a prominent and well-respected fashion designer. She has expressed interest in fashion design throughout the entirety of her career, even dating back to her childhood: "Little House on the Prairie was my favorite show. I would only wear calico print dresses, and I actually slept in one of those little nightcaps!", she told People in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20060137,00.html|date=September 3, 2007|accessdate=March 2, 2010|work=People|author=Tan, Michelle|title=Inside My Closet: Chloe Sevigny[/tpl] Her unorthodox style (which garnered her initial notoriety in the early '90s) has often been referred to as very eclectic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.okmagazine.com/tag/kate-moss/page/6/|work=OK Magazine|title=Kate Moss|date=April 8, 2008|accessdate=March 2, 2010|last=Willett |first=C.[/tpl] Sevigny has since released several clothing lines designed by herself, both solo and in collaboration, and has earned a title as a modern fashion icon.

Critical reception of her fashion and style has been extensively written about by both designers and fashion stylists and has generally proved favorable. American designer Marc Jacobs wrote of Sevigny in 2001: "The fashion world is fascinated by her.

During the 29th International Festival of Fashion and Photography, which runs from April 25 to 28, 2014, Sevigny is a judge of the fashion jury, along with Humberto Leon and Carol Lim.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/chlo-sevigny-heads-to-hyres-7388680?src=nl/mornReport/20140123 | title=Chloë Sevigny Heads to Hyères | publisher=WWD | date=22 January 2014 | accessdate=23 January 2014 | author=Guilbault,  Laure[/tpl] Also, in 2014, she was "working on a style book published by Rizzoli".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/chlo-sevigny-heads-to-hyres-7388680?src=nl/mornReport/20140123 | title=Chloë Sevigny Heads to Hyères | publisher=WWD | date=22 January 2014 | accessdate=23 January 2014 | author=Guilbault,  Laure[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Sevigny owned an apartment in the East Village, Manhattan, which she purchased for $1.2 million in 2006 and sold in March 2013 for $1.85 million.[tpl]cite news |date=April 17, 2005 |title=In an East Village Co-op, The Famous Stick Together |first=William |last=Neuman|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/17/realestate/17deal.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print&position= |work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 10, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=House of the day: Check Out The East Village Apartment Chloë Sevigny Just Sold For $1.85 Million|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/chlo-sevigny-sold-her-farmer-chic-home-2013-3?op=1#the-co-op-is-on-east-10th-street-1|work=Business Insider Australia|date=March 27, 2013|accessdate=April 7, 2014[/tpl] In October 2013, after selling her East Village apartment, she purchased a classic six bedroom apartment residence, overlooking Prospect Park in Park Slope, Brooklyn for $2 million.[tpl]cite web|title=Chloe Sevigny buys "Classic Six" apartment overlooking Prospect Park|work=Brownstoner|url=http://www.brownstoner.com/blog/2013/10/chloe-sevigny-buys-classic-six-apartment-overlooking-prospect-park/|accessdate=April 7, 2014[/tpl]
Her father died when she was in her early 20s, and Sevigny stated in a 2006 interview that she came from a "close-knit" family, that she speaks to her mother every day,  and that her brother lives three blocks away from her apartment.[tpl]cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_4_36/ai_n26846989/ |title=Find Articles |author=Blair, Selma|date=May 6, 2006 |work=Selma Blair |publisher=Interview Magazine |accessdate=August 6, 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2010[/tpl] Sevigny also suffers from scoliosis, which was diagnosed when she was a child, though she never received any surgical treatment. She has stated that she practices yoga for relief from the condition. Sevigny is a practicing Roman Catholic, although she admits she rebelled against religion as a teenager. She said she began attending church services again after playing a Satan-worshipping teenage murderer in a 1998 Off-Broadway production of Hazelwood Junior High, claiming that she "got really disturbed" and "started having nightmares and thinking horrible things".
Sevigny has had various relationships with men, though in 2006 she stated to the New York Post Gossip column: "I've questioned issues of gender and sexuality since I was a teenager, and I did some experimenting."[tpl]cite news|author=Kennedy, Dana|title=Oscar films/First timers; Who Says You Have to Struggle to Be a Star?|date=March 12, 2000|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/12/movies/oscar-films-first-timers-who-says-you-have-to-struggle-to-be-a-star.html?pagewanted=1[/tpl] In a later interview, she stated that she "wouldn't call herself bisexual", and that she could never see herself in a relationship with a woman. Nonetheless, Sevigny has been popular with the gay community throughout her career.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/Arts_and_Entertainment/People/Second_Wifes_Club/|work=The Advocate|date=April 1, 2010|accessdate=March 10, 2010|title=Second Wife's Club|author=Voss, Brandon[/tpl] Following her relationship with Harmony Korine (which ended in the late 1990s), Sevigny dated British musician Jarvis Cocker, and later Matt McAuley, a member of the noise-rock band A.R.E. Weapons. Sevigny and McAuley ended their relationship in early 2008, after being together for nearly eight years.[tpl]cite news|publisher=Times Online (UK)|title=Chloë Sevigny, the queen of cool|author=Brinton, Jessica|date=May 17, 2009|accessdate=October 7, 2009|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/fashion/article6280331.ece | location=London[/tpl]
In a 2009 interview, Sevigny reflected on her career, and said she was content with the level of stardom she had maintained: "When I was in my early 20s, I went out with a British pop star, Jarvis Cocker; of course, pop stars have much more celebrity, I think, than actors even. They’re really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' And I saw the effect it had on him, and that’s when I decided I never wanted to be a celebrity at that level, and I think that’s why I’ve chosen to do the work that I do and just kind of work with directors that I love and try and do work that means something to me."
