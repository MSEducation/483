Wolfgang Přiklopil (May 14, 1962 – August 23, 2006) was an Austrian communications technician. In 1998, he kidnapped 10-year-old Natascha Kampusch and held her for eight years, committing suicide after she escaped.
Přiklopil was born to Karl and Waltraud Přiklopil, in Vienna, an only child. Karl was a cognac salesman and Waltraud a shoe saleswoman.[tpl]cite news | title = The silence of the lamb | work = Guardian | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2099-2483706_2,00.html | accessdate = 2006-12-10  | location=London | first=Patrick | last=Foster[/tpl] Přiklopil worked for a time at Siemens as a communications technician.
Přiklopil kidnapped Kampusch on the morning of March 2, 1998 as she was on her way to school, eventually keeping her in a custom built basement (sometimes referred to as a "dungeon" in news reports) under his house in Strasshof, Lower Austria.  The house was built by Přiklopil's grandfather, Oskar Přiklopil, after World War II. During the Cold War period, Oskar and his son Karl built a bomb shelter, thought to be the origin of Kampusch's dungeon.  Přiklopil took over the house in 1984 following his grandmother's death.
Kampusch escaped on August 23, 2006. After a police chase, from which he escaped, Přiklopil committed suicide by stepping in front of a moving train near the Vienna Northern Station.[tpl]cite news | first = Duke| last = Katie| title = 'Respect my privacy' says kidnap victim | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/austria/article/0,,1859303,00.html| work = Guardian Unlimited| date = 2006-08-27| accessdate = 2006-08-27 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|publisher=Washington Post|date=24 August 2006|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/24/AR2006082400174.html|title=Austrian girl's suspected kidnapper kills himself|accessdate=2006-08-25|first=Karin|last=Strohecker[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Přiklopil appeared to have relied exclusively on a Commodore 64 as his computer, which is a complicating factor in the recovery of evidence because of the obsolete technology.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/austria/article/0,,1865500,00.html|title=Kidnapper's retro computer offers scant clues|first=Mark|last=Oliver|date=September 5, 2006|publisher=Guardian Unlimited | location=London[/tpl]

==Personal Life==

Wolfgang was allegedly a divorced man, who had a marriage which produced a daughter. His alleged wife is named Margit Wendelberger, and is the sister of his good friend and alleged accomplice in Natascha Kampusch's abduction, Ernst Holzapfel. Margit refuted the claim, but could not explain clearly why she dealt with Priklopil's funeral arrangements or why her daughter inherited one of three of Priklopil's properties or Priklopil's burial in her family plot.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2303168/Natascha-Kampuschs-father-names-second-kidnapper-claims-police-covered-errors-search-daughter-explosive-new-book.html|title=Natascha Kampusch's father names a second kidnapper and claims police covered up errors in the search for his daughter in explosive new book|first=Allan|last=Hall|date=3 April 2013|publisher=Daily Mail|location=London[/tpl]
