The strength of the FARC–EP forces is indeterminate; in 2007, the FARC said they were an armed force of 18,000 men and women; in 2010, the Colombian military calculated that FARC forces consisted of approximately 13,800 members, 50 per cent of which were armed guerrilla combatants; and, in 2011, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said that FARC–EP forces comprised fewer than 10,000 members. 26,648 FARC and ELN members have decided to demobilize since 2002.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/desmovilizacion-principal-arma-contra-las-guerrillas_13077339-4 |title= Desmovilización, principal arma contra las guerrillas|publisher= eltiempo.com|language=Spanish|accessdate= 26 September 2013[/tpl] According to a report from Human Rights Watch, approximately 20-30% of the recruits are minors, most of whom are forced to join the FARC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2005/02/21/colombia-armed-groups-send-children-war |title=Colombia: Armed Groups Send Children to War |publisher=|date= |accessdate=2006-09-01[/tpl] The greatest concentrations of FARC guerrilla forces are in the south-eastern regions of Colombia's [tpl]convert|500000|km2|sqmi|sp=us[/tpl] of jungle, in the plains at the base of the Andean mountain chain [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] and in northwestern Colombia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/farc-peace/farc-vulnerability-ivan-rios|title=Ivan Rios Bloc: the FARC's Most Vulnerable Fighting Division - InSight Crime – Organized Crime in the Americas|accessdate=11 Jan 2014[/tpl] However, the FARC and the ELN (National Liberation Army of Colombia) lost control of the territory, forcing them to hide primarily in remote areas in the jungle.[tpl]cite web|author=CIA world fact book|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/co.html|title=Colombia|work=CIA|accessdate=24 May 2009[/tpl]
In 1964, the FARC–EP were established as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party (Partido Comunista Colombiano, PCC), after the Colombian military attacked rural Communist enclaves in the aftermath of The Violence (La Violencia, ca. 1948–58). The FARC are a violent non-state actor (VNSA) whose formal recognition as legitimate belligerent forces is disputed by some organizations. As such, the FARC has been classified as a terrorist organization by the governments of Colombia, the United States, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, and the European Union; whereas the governments of Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, and Nicaragua don't. In 2008, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez recognized the FARC-EP as a proper army. President Chávez also asked the Colombian government and their allies to recognize the FARC as a belligerent force, arguing that such political recognition would oblige the FARC to forgo kidnapping and terrorism as methods of civil war and to abide by the Geneva Convention. Juan Manuel Santos, the current President of Colombia, has followed a middle path by recognizing in 2011 that there is an "armed conflict" in Colombia although his predecessor, Alvaro Uribe, strongly disagreed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com.co/elpais/colombia/presidente-santos-reconoce-en-colombia-hay-conflicto-armado |title=Presidente Juan Manuel Santos reconoce que en Colombia hay conflicto armado : Noticias de Colombia conflicto armado PolĂ­tica |publisher=elpais.com.co |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14[/tpl] In 2012, FARC announced they would no longer participate in kidnappings for ransom and released the last 10 soldiers and police officers they kept as prisoners but it has kept silent about the status of hundreds of civilians still reported as hostages.[tpl]cite news|author=Toby Muse in Bogota |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/03/colombian-farc-releases-hostages-jungle |title=Colombian Farc rebels release hostages after decade of jungle captivity | World news | guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 3 April 2012|accessdate=2012-10-14 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Gabriel Elizondo |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/05/20125301425187352.html |title=FARC's civilian captives suffer in silence - Features |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14[/tpl] In February 2008, millions of Colombians demonstrated against the FARC.
In 2012, the FARC made 239 attacks on the energy infrastructure. However, the FARC show signs of social fatigue. Also the FARC are already not seeking battles with the army, and rarely make attacks against the police. This follows the trend of the 1990s during the strengthening of the Government forces. Currently the FARC and the Colombian Government are in peace talks in the city of Havana in Cuba.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/actualidad/farc-cambiaron-secuestro-por-extorsion-y-se-freno-la-desmovilizacion/20131119/nota/2019212.aspx|title= Informe del Centro de Memoria Histórica conocido por Caracol Radio revela historia de las Farc de los últimos 65 años |publisher= caracol.com.co|language=Spanish|accessdate=1 November 2013[/tpl]

===La Violencia and the National Front===

[tpl]Quotebox|align=right|width=25%|quote="There is more repression of individual freedom here, than in any country we've been to; the police patrol the streets, carrying rifles, and demand your papers every few minutes... the atmosphere, here, is tense, and it seems a revolution may be brewing.

In 1948, in the aftermath of the assassination of the populist politician Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, there occurred a decade of large-scale political violence throughout Colombia, which was a Conservative – Liberal civil war that killed more than 200,000 people. In Colombian history and culture, the killings are known as La Violencia (The Violence, 1948–58); most of the people killed were peasants and laborers in rural Colombia.[tpl]cite book|title=Systems of Violence: the political economy of war and peace in Colombia|author=Nazih Richani|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2002|pages=23–28[/tpl] In 1957–1958, the political leadership of the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party agreed to establish a bipartisan political system known as the National Front (Frente Nacional, 1958–74). The Liberal and the Conservative parties agreed to alternate in the exercise of government power by presenting a joint National Front candidate to each election and restricting the participation of other political movements. The pact was ratified as a constitutional amendment by a national plebiscite on 1 December 1957 and was supported by the Roman Catholic Church as well as Colombia's business leaders. The initial power-sharing agreement was effective until 1974; nonetheless, with modifications, the Liberal–Conservative bipartisan system lasted until 1990.[tpl]cite book|title=Beyond Bogota: Diary of a Drug War Journalist|author=Garry Leech|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston, MA|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8070-6148-0|pages=242–247[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Forrest Hylton|title=Evil Hour in Colombia|publisher=Verso|year=2006|isbn=978-1-84467-551-7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yF1WxzySuEgC&pg=PA51|pages=51–52[/tpl] The sixteen-year extension of the bipartisan power-sharing agreement permitted the Liberal and Conservative élites to consolidate their socioeconomic control of Colombian society, and to strengthen the military to suppress political reform and radical politics proposing alternative forms of government for Colombia.[tpl]cite book|last=Stokes|first=Doug|title=America's Other War: Terrorizing Colombia|year=2005|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84277-547-9|page=68[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Global Capitalism, Democracy, and Civil-Military Relations in Colombia|author=William Avilés|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7914-6699-5|page=32[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Forrest Hylton|title=Evil Hour in Colombia|publisher=Verso|year=2006|isbn=978-1-84467-551-7|pages=53, 55–56[/tpl]
During the 1960s, the Colombian government effected a policy of Accelerated Economic Development (AED), the agribusiness plan of Lauchlin Currie, a Canadian-born U.S.economist who owned ranching land in Colombia. The plan promoted industrial farming that would produce great yields of agricultural and animal products for world-wide exportation, while the Colombian government would provide subsidies to large-scale private farms. The AED policy came at the expense of the small-scale family farms that only yielded food supplies for local consumption. Based on a legalistic interpretation of what constituted "efficient use" of the land, thousands of peasants were forcefully evicted from their farms and migrated to the cities, where they became part of the industrial labor pool. In 1961, the dispossession of farmland had produced 40,000 landless families and by 1969 their numbers amounted to 400,000 throughout Colombia.[tpl]Cite book|title=Colombia: Inside the Labyrinth|author=Jenny Pearce|year=1990|publisher=Latin American Bureau|page=92[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Guerrilla Movements in Latin America|author=Richard Gott|publisher=Nelson|year=1970|page=516[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Revolution Next Door: Latin America in the 1970s|author=Gary MacEoin|publisher=Holt, Rinehart & Winston|year=1971|page=91[/tpl] By 1970, the  latifundio type of industrial farm (more than 50 hectares in area) occupied more than 77 per cent of arable land in the country.[tpl]cite journal|title=Imperialist capitalism in the Third World: theory and evidence from Colombia|author=Raúl A.

===PCC and self-defense communities===

Communists were active throughout rural and urban Colombia in the period immediately following World War I.[tpl]cite book|title=The Political, Economic, and Labor Climate in Colombia|author1=David R. Decker|author2=Ignacio Duran|publisher=University of Pennsylvania |year=1982|pages=80–81[/tpl] The Colombian Communist Party (Partido Comunista Colombiano, PCC) was formally accredited by the Comintern in 1930. The PCC began establishing "peasant leagues" in rural areas and "popular fronts" in urban areas, calling for improved living and working conditions, education, and rights for the working class. These groups began networking together to present a defensive front against the state-supported violence of large landholders.Gomez, Alberto (1972) "Perspectives of the revolutionary armed forces of Colombia (FARC)". National Liberation Fronts 1960/1970: Essays, documents, interviews New York: William Morrow & Company, ISBN 978-0-688-02189-4, p. 248[tpl]cite book|title=Revolutionary Social Change in Colombia: The Origin and Direction of the FARC-EP|author=James J. Brittain|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7453-2876-8|pages=2–3[/tpl] Members organized strikes, protests, seizures of land, and organized communist-controlled "self-defense communities" in southern Colombia that were able to resist state military forces, while providing for the subsistence needs of the populace. Many of the PCC's attempts at organizing peasants, were met with violent repression by the Colombian government, and landowning class. U.S. military intelligence estimated that in 1962, the size of the PCC had grown to 8,000 to 10,000 active members, and an additional 28,000 supporters.
In 1961, a guerrilla leader and long-time PCC organizer named Manuel Marulanda Vélez declared an independent "Republic of Marquetalia". The Lleras government attempted unsuccessfully to attack the communities to drive out the guerrillas, due to fears that "a Cuban-style revolutionary situation might develop". After the failed attacks, several army outposts were set up in the area.[tpl]cite journal|author=Dennis M.

Although unsuccessful in driving the irregular forces from their stronghold, several army outposts were established in the area.[/tpl]

===Plan Lazo===

In October 1959, the United States sent a "Special Survey Team" composed of counterinsurgency experts to investigate Colombia's internal security situation. Among other policy recommendations the US team advised that "in order to shield the interests of both Colombian and US authorities against 'interventionist' charges any special aid given for internal security was to be sterile and covert in nature."

In a secret supplement to his report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Yarborough encouraged the creation and deployment of a US-backed force to commit "paramilitary, sabotage and/or terrorist activities against known communist proponents".Visit to Colombia, South America, by a Team from Special Warfare Center, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Headquarters, U.S. Army Special Warfare School, 26 February 1962, Kennedy Library, Box 319, National Security Files, Special Group; Fort Bragg Team; Visit to Colombia; 3/62, "Secret Supplement, Colombian Survey Report."[tpl]cite book|title=Rogue states: the rule of force in world affairs|author=Noam Chomsky|publisher=South End Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-89608-611-1|page=69|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dCBwFyNp6jQC&pg=PA69[/tpl]Las Redes de Asesinos de Colombia. La asociación militar-paramilitares y Estados Unidos, Human Rights Watch, 1996 (Spanish)
The new counter-insurgency policy was instituted as Plan Lazo in 1962 and called for both military operations and civic action programs in violent areas. Following Yarborough's recommendations, the Colombian military recruited civilians into "civil defense" groups which worked alongside the military in its counter-insurgency campaign, as well as in civilian intelligence networks to gather information on guerrilla activity.[tpl]cite book|last=Stokes|first=Doug|title=America's Other War: Terrorizing Colombia|year=2005|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84277-547-9|pages=71–72[/tpl] Doug Stokes argues that it was not until the early part of the 1980s that the Colombian government attempted to move away from the counterinsurgency strategy represented by Plan Lazo and Yarborough's 1962 recommendations.[tpl]cite book|last=Stokes|first=Doug|title=America's Other War: Terrorizing Colombia|year=2005|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84277-547-9|page=74[/tpl]
The Colombian government began attacking many of the communist groups in the early 1960s, attempting to re-assimilate the territories under the control of the national government. FARC was formed in 1964 by Manuel Marulanda Vélez and other PCC members, after a military attack on the community of Marquetalia. 16,000 Colombian troops attacked the community, which only had 48 armed fighters. Marulanda and 47 others fought against government forces at Marquetalia, and then escaped into the mountains along with the other fighters. These 48 men formed the core of FARC, which later grew in size to hundreds of fighters.[tpl]cite book|title=Latin America, its problems and its promise: a multidisciplinary introduction |author=Jan Kippers Black| publisher=Westview Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8133-4164-4| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5v1gkSLNEA4C&pg=PA404| page=404[/tpl][tpl]cite book |first1=Jorge Pablo |last1=Osterling |authorlink= |author2=Xavier Sanin |title=Democracy in Colombia: Clientelist Politics and Guerrilla Warfare |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location= |year=1989 |page=280[/tpl]

===Seventh Guerrilla Conference of the FARC-EP===

In 1982, FARC-EP held its Seventh Guerrilla Conference, which called for a major shift in FARC's strategy. FARC had historically been doing most of its fighting in rural areas, and was limited to small-scale confrontations with Colombian military forces. By 1982, increased income from the "coca boom" allowed them to expand into an irregular army, which would then stage large-scale attacks on Colombian troops. They also began sending fighters to Vietnam and the Soviet Union for advanced military training. They also planned to move closer to middle-sized cities, as opposed to only remote rural areas, and closer to areas rich in natural resources, in order to create a strong economic infrastructure. It was also at this conference that FARC added the initials "EP", for "Ejército del Pueblo" or "People's Army", to the organization's name.[tpl]cite book|author=Dudley, Steven|title=Walking Ghosts: Murder and Guerrilla Politics in Colombia|publisher=Routledge| date=January 2004|isbn=0-415-93303-X|pages=47–56, 59–60[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The Human Condition|author=Robert C.

===La Uribe Agreement and Union Patriótica===

In the early 1980s, President Belisario Betancur began discussing the possibility of peace talks with the guerrillas. Ultimately this resulted in the 1984 La Uribe Agreement, which called for a cease-fire, which ended up lasting from 1984 to 1987.[tpl]cite book|title=Voting amid violence: electoral democracy in Colombia|author=Steven Lynn Taylor|publisher=Northeastern University Press (UPNE)|year=2009|isbn=978-1-55553-698-5|pages=153–154| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xr_7dHPt9pAC&pg=PA153[/tpl]
In 1985, members of the FARC-EP, along with a large number of other leftist and communist groups, formed a political party known as the Union Patriótica ("Patriotic Union", UP). The UP sought political reforms (known as Apertura Democratica) such as constitutional reform, more democratic local elections, political decentralization, and ending the domination of Colombian politics by the Liberal and Conservative parties. They also pursued socioeconomic reforms such land redistribution, greater health and education spending, the nationalization of foreign businesses, Colombian banks, and transportation, and greater public access to mass media. While many members of the UP were involved with the FARC-EP, the large majority of them were not and came from a wide variety of backgrounds such as labor unions and socialist parties such as the PCC.[tpl]cite book|title=Revolutionary Social Change in Colombia: The Origin and Direction of the FARC-EP|author=James J. Brittain|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7453-2876-8|pages=206–210[/tpl] In the cities, the FARC-EP began integrating itself with the UP and forming Juntas Patrióticas (or "solidarity cells") -- small groups of people associated with labor unions, student activist groups, and peasant leagues, who traveled into the barrios discussing social problems, building support for the UP, and determining the sociopolitical stance of the urban peasantry.[tpl]cite book|title=Inside insurgency: violence, civilians, and revolutionary group behavior|author=Claire Metelits|publisher=NYU Press|year=2009| isbn=978-0-8147-9578-1|pages=98–99|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CrskYcO58oIC&pg=PA98[/tpl]
The UP performed better in elections than any other leftist party in Colombia's history. In 1986, UP candidates won 350 local council seats, 23 deputy positions in departmental assemblies, 9 seats in the House, and 6 seats in the Senate. The 1986 Presidential candidate, Jaime Pardo Leal, won 4.6% of the national vote.[tpl]cite book|title=The Politics and Ideology of the Colombian Peasant Movement: The Case of ANUC (National Association of Peasant Smallholders)|author=Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui|publisher=UN Research Institute for Social Development/CINEP|year=1987|page=129[/tpl]
Since 1986, thousands of members of the UP and other leftist parties were murdered (estimates range from 4,000 to 6,000). In 1987, the President of the UP, Jaime Pardo, was murdered. In 1989 a single large landholder had over 400 UP members murdered. Over 70% of all Colombian presidential candidates in 1990—and 100% of those from center-left parties—were assassinated.[tpl]cite book|title=Our Guerrillas, Our Sidewalks: a journey into the violence of Colombia, 2nd ed.|author=Herbert T.

===1990–1998===

During this period, the Colombian government continued its negotiations with the FARC-EP and other armed groups, some of which were successful. Some of the groups which demobilized at this time include the EPL, the ERP, the Quintín Lame Armed Movement, and the M-19.
Towards the end of 1990, the army, with no advance warning and while negotiations were still ongoing with the group, attacked a compound known as Casa Verde, which housed the National Secretariat of the FARC-EP. The Colombian government argued that the attack was caused by the FARC-EP's lack of commitment to the process, since the organization was continuing its criminal activities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
During this year on 10 August senior leader Jacobo Arenas, an ideological leader and founder of FARC-EP, died.
On 3 June 1991, dialogue resumed between the Simón Bolívar Guerrilla Coordinating Board and the government on neutral territory in Caracas, Venezuela and Tlaxcala, Mexico.«40 años de las FARC. Pág. 6: Otros acercamientos», en BBC Mundo. However, the war did not stop, and armed attacks by both sides continued. The negotiation process was broken off in 1993 after no agreement was reached. The Coordinating Board disappeared not long after that time, and guerrilla groups continued their activities independently.
Before the break off of dialogue, a letter written by a group of Colombian intellectuals (among whom were Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez) to the Simón Bolívar Guerrilla Coordinating Board was released denouncing the approach taken by the FARC-EP and the dire consequences that it was having for the country.Carta de los intelectuales colombianos a la Coordinadora Guerrilla Simón Bolívar, in Nueva Sociedad 125: May–June 1993.
In the early 1990s, the FARC-EP had between 7,000 and 10,000 fighters, organized into 70 fronts spread throughout the country.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] From 1996 to 1998 they inflicted a series of strikes on the Colombian Army, including a three-day offensive in Mitú (Vaupés department), taking a large number of soldiers prisoner.
On 23 September 1994, the FARC kidnapped American agricultural scientist Thomas Hargrove and held him captive for 11 months. After his release, Hargrove wrote a book about his ordeal which inspired the 2000 film Proof of Life starring Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe.
Over this period in Colombia, the cultivation of different drugs expanded and there were widespread coca farmers' marches. These marches brought to a halt several major arteries in southern Colombia. Government officials said that FARC-EP had forced the protesters to participate.Ramírez, María Clemencia: «The Politics of Recognition and Citizenship in Putumayo and in the Baja Bota of Cauca: The Case of the 1996 cocalero movement».Betancourt Santiago, Milson: «El movimiento de campesinos cocaleros del Putumayo en Colombia», in Aportes Andinos 11 October 2004. According to social anthropologist María Clemencia Ramírez, the relationship between the guerrillas and the marches was ambivalent: FARC-EP promoted the 1996 protests as part of their participatory democracy policies yet also exercised authoritarianism, which led to tensions and negotiations with peasant leaders, but the cocalero movement brought proposals on behalf of the coca growers and defended its own interests.

===Andrés Pastrana's presidency (1998–2002)===

In March 1999 members of a local FARC contingent killed 3 USA-based indigenous rights activists, who were working with the U'Wa people to build a school for U'Wa children, and were fighting against encroachment of U'Wa territory by multinational oil corporations. The killings were questioned by many and condemned by many others, and led the United States to increase pressure on the Pastrana administration to crack down on FARC guerrillas.[tpl]cite book|title=Colombia and the United States: war, unrest, and destabilization |author1=Mario A.

With the hope of negotiating a peace settlement, on 7 November 1998, President Andrés Pastrana granted FARC-EP a [tpl]convert|42000|km2|sqmi|-2|abbr=on[/tpl] safe haven meant to serve as a confidence building measure, centered around the San Vicente del Caguán settlement.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]
After a series of high-profile guerrilla actions, including the hijacking of an aircraft, the attack on several small towns and cities, the arrest of the Irish Colombia Three (see below) and the alleged training of FARC-EP militants in bomb making by them, and the kidnapping of several political figures, Pastrana ended the peace talks on 21 February 2002 and ordered the armed forces to start retaking the FARC-EP controlled zone, beginning at midnight. A 48-hour respite that had been previously agreed to with the rebel group was not respected as the government argued that it had already been granted during an earlier crisis in January, when most of the more prominent FARC-EP commanders had apparently left the demilitarized zone.BBC News. "Colombian army moves against rebels." 21 February 2002 Available online. Retrieved 3 November 2006. Shortly after the end of talks, the FARC-EP kidnapped Oxygen Green Party presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, who was traveling in Colombian territory. Betancourt was rescued by the Colombian government on 2 July 2008 (see Operation Jaque below).

====The Colombia Three case====

On 24 April 2002, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on International Relations published the findings of its investigation into IRA activities in Colombia. Their report alleged a longstanding connection between the IRA and FARC-EP, mentioned at least 15 IRA members who had been traveling in and out of Colombia since 1998, and estimated that the IRA had received at least $2 million in drug proceeds for training FARC-EP members.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nationalreview.com/script/printpage.p?ref=/comment/comment-ehrenfeld082102.asp | title = Ira + plo | date = 21 August 2002 | publisher=National Review[/tpl] The IRA/FARC-EP connection was first made public on 11 August 2001, following the arrest in Bogotá of two IRA explosives and urban warfare experts and of a representative of Sinn Féin who was known to be stationed in Cuba. Jim Monaghan, Martin McCauley and Niall Connolly (known as the Colombia Three), were arrested in Colombia in August 2001 and were accused of teaching bomb-making methods to FARC-EP.[tpl]cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E2DD163EF937A15757C0A9649C8B63 | title = Adams Delays Testifying in U.S. About I.R.A.

On 15 February 2002, the Colombia Three were charged with training FARC-EP members in bomb-making in Colombia. The Colombian authorities had received satellite footage, probably supplied by the CIA, of the men with FARC-EP in an isolated jungle area, where they are thought to have spent the last five weeks. They could have spent up to 20 years in jail if the allegations were proved.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/aug/16/colombia.northernireland?commentpage=1 | title = Arrested IRA man is Sinn Féin's fixer in Latin America | date = 16 August 2001 |work=The Guardian |location=London    | first=Rosie | last=Cowan | accessdate=22 May 2010[/tpl]
During October 2001, a key witness in the case against the three Irish republicans disappeared. This came as Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams admitted one of the men was the party's representative in Cuba. The missing witness, a former police inspector, said he had seen Mr McCauley with FARC-EP members in 1998. Without his testimony, legal sources said the chances of convicting the three men were reduced.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]
They were eventually found guilty of traveling on false passports in June 2004 but were acquitted of training FARC-EP members. That decision was reversed after an appeal by the Attorney General of Colombia and they were sentenced to 17-year terms.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4140302.stm | title = Appeal to Ahern over republicans | date = 11 August 2005 |publisher=BBC News    | accessdate=4 January 2010[/tpl] However, they vanished in December 2004 while on bail and returned to Ireland. Tánaiste Mary Harney said no deal had been done with Sinn Féin or the IRA over the three's return to Ireland adding that the Irish government would consider any request from the Colombian authorities for their extradition. Colombian vice-president Francisco Santos Calderón did not rule out allowing them to serve their sentences in Ireland.

===Álvaro Uribe's Presidency (2002–2010)===

====2002–2005 period====

For most of the period between 2002 and 2005, the FARC-EP was believed to be in a strategic withdrawal due to the increasing military and police actions of new president Álvaro Uribe, which led to the capture or desertion of many fighters and medium-level commanders. Uribe ran for office on an anti-FARC-EP platform and was determined to defeat FARC-EP in a bid to create "confidence" in the country.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl] Uribe's own father had been killed by FARC-EP in an attempted kidnapping in 1983.BBC News.

During the first two years of the Uribe administration, several FARC-EP fronts, most notably in Cundinamarca and Antioquia, were broken by the government's military operations.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]
On 5 May 2003, the FARC assassinated the governor of Antioquia, Guillermo Gaviria Correa, his advisor for peace, former defense minister Gilberto Echeverri Mejía, and 8 soldiers.

On 13 July 2004, the office of the United Nations' High Commissioner for Human Rights publicly condemned the group, proving that FARC-EP  violated article 17 of the additional Protocol II of the Geneva Convention and international humanitarian law, as a result of the 10 July massacre of seven peasants and the subsequent displacement of eighty individuals in San Carlos, Antioquia.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.hchr.org.co/publico/comunicados/2004/cp0423.pdf| title = FARC-EP violan el DIH en San Carlos, Antioquia| date = 13 July 2004 | publisher=OFICINA EN COLOMBIA DEL ALTO COMISIONADO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS PARA LOS DERECHOS HUMANOS [/tpl] Accessed 1 March 2010.
In early February 2005, a series of small-scale actions by the FARC-EP around the southwestern departments of Colombia, resulted in an estimated 40 casualties. The FARC-EP, in response to government military operations in the south and in the southeast, would now be displacing its military center of gravity towards the Nariño, Putumayo and Cauca departments.BBC News.

====Possibility of prisoner exchange with the government====

The FARC-EP originally said that they would only release the police and military members they held captive (whom they considered to be prisoners of war) through exchanges with the government for imprisoned FARC-EP members.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cambio.com.co/portadacambio/841/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR_CAMBIO-5836431.html |title=Portada -> Habla 'Cano' |publisher=Cambio.com.co |accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl] During the duration of the DMZ negotiations, a small humanitarian exchange took place.[tpl]cite web|url=http://colombiajournal.org/colombia70.htm |title=Prisoner Release Represents FARC's First Political Concession |publisher=Colombia Journal |date=2001-07-02 |accessdate=2012-10-14[/tpl]
The group demanded a demilitarized zone including two towns (Florida and Pradera) in the strategic region of Valle del Cauca, where much of the current military action against them has taken place, plus this region is also an important way of transporting drugs to the Pacific coast.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] This demand was rejected by the Colombian government based on previous experience during the 2002 peace talks.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
On 2 December 2004, the government announced the pardon of 23 FARC-EP prisoners, to encourage a reciprocal move. The prisoners to be released were all of low rank and had promised not to rejoin the armed struggle. In November 2004, the FARC-EP had rejected a proposal to hand over 59 of its captives in exchange for 50 guerrillas imprisoned by the government.BBC News. "Colombia 'to release Farc rebels.'" 2 December 2006. Available online. Retrieved 5 November 2006.
In a communique dated 28 November but released publicly on 3 December, the FARC-EP declared that they were no longer insisting on the demilitarization of San Vicente del Caguán and Cartagena del Chairá as a precondition for the negotiation of the prisoner exchange, but instead that of Florida and Pradera in the Valle department.FARC-EP. Comunicado las FARC. 28 November 2004. Archived online. Archive created 5 March 2006 and accessed 11 November 2006.

The FARC-EP also mention in the communique that Simón Trinidad's extradition, would be a serious obstacle to reaching a prisoner exchange agreement with the government.[tpl]Cite news|title=Colombia extradites top rebel commander to U.S |work=Chicago Tribune|date=31 December 2004|first=Gary|last =Marx[/tpl]  On 17 December 2004, the Colombian government authorized Trinidad's extradition to the United States, but stated that the measure could be revoked if the FARC-EP released all political hostages and military captives in its possession before 30 December. The FARC-EP rejected the demand.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]

====Partial captive releases and escapes during 2006 and 2007====

On 25 March 2006, after a public announcement made weeks earlier, the FARC-EP released two captured policemen at La Dorada, Putumayo. The release took place some [tpl]convert|335|mi|km[/tpl] southwest of Bogotá, near the Ecuadorean border. The Red Cross said the two were released in good health.

====2007 death of 11 hostage deputies====

On 28 June 2007, the FARC-EP reported the death of 11 out of 12 provincial deputies from the Valle del Cauca Department whom the guerrillas had kidnapped in 2002. The guerrillas claimed that the deputies had been killed by crossfire during an attack by an "unidentified military group." The Colombian government stated that government forces had not made any rescue attempts and that the FARC-EP executed the hostages. FARC did not report any other casualties on either side and delayed months before permitting the Red Cross to recover the remains. According to the government, the guerrillas delayed turning over the corpses to let decomposition hide evidence of how they died. The Red Cross reported that the corpses had been washed and their clothing changed before burial, hiding evidence of how they were killed. The Red Cross also reported that the deputies had been killed by multiple close-range shots, many of them in the back of the victims, and even two by shots to the head.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6251878.stm|title=Colombia rebels 'killed hostages' |accessdate=13 February 2008|publisher=BBC News   | date=28 June 2007[/tpl]
In February 2009, Sigifredo López, the only deputy who survived and was later released by FARC, accused the group of killing the 11 captives and denied that any military rescue attempt had taken place. According to López, the unexpected arrival of another guerrilla unit resulted in confusion and paranoia, leading the rebels to kill the rest of the Valle deputies. He survived after previously being punished for insubordination and was held in chains nearby but separated from the rest of the group.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=45707|title=COLOMBIA: Ex-Hostage Says FARC Killed 11 Captives |accessdate=6 January 2010|publisher=Inter Press Service | date=2 February 2009[/tpl]

In a televised speech, Colombia's U.S.-allied president, Álvaro Uribe, thanked Chavez for his efforts.
During the period she was held kidnapped in the jungle in 2004, Clara Rojas gave birth to her son by Caesarean. At 8 months old, the baby was removed from the area and Rojas didn't hear of the boy again until 31 December, when she heard Colombian President Álvaro Uribe say on the radio that the child was no longer with her captors. DNA tests later confirmed the boy, who had been living in a Bogotá foster home for more than two years under a different name, was hers. She reclaimed her son.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=4125500 | title = Freed Colombian Hostages Relate Ordeal | publisher=ABC News | date = 12 January 2008[/tpl] Asked about her opinion of the FARC-EP as group, Rojas called it "a criminal organization", condemning its kidnappings as "a total violation of human dignity" and saying some captive police and soldiers are constantly chained.

=====February 2008 liberations=====

On 31 January 2008, the FARC-EP announced that they would release civilian hostages Luis Eladio Perez Bonilla, Gloria Polanco, and Orlando Beltran Cuellar to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez as a humanitarian gesture. On 27 February 2008, the three hostages and Jorge Eduardo Gechem Turbay (who was added to the list due to his poor health) were released by FARC-EP.

On 4 February 2008, several rallies were held in Colombia and in other locations around the world, criticizing FARC-EP and demanding the liberation of hundreds of hostages. The protests were originally organized through the popular social networking site Facebook and were also supported by local Colombian media outlets as well as the Colombian government.

=====Operation Jaque=====

On 2 July 2008, under a Colombian military operation called Operation Jaque, the FARC-EP was tricked by the Colombian Government into releasing 15 captives to Colombian Intelligence agents disguised as journalists and international aid workers in a helicopter rescue. Military intelligence agents infiltrated the guerrilla ranks and led the local commander in charge of the captives, Gerardo Aguilar Ramírez, alias Cesar, to believe they were going to take them by helicopter to Alfonso Cano, the guerrillas' supreme leader. The  rescued included Íngrid Betancourt (former presidential Candidate), U.S. military contractors Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes, and Keith Stansell, as well as eleven Colombian police officers and soldiers. The commander, Cesar and one other rebel were taken into custody by agents without incident after boarding the helicopter.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,375481,00.html |title = Politician Ingrid Betancourt, 3 American Hostages Rescued From Colombian Rebels |publisher=foxnews | date=2 July 2008[/tpl] On 4 July, some observers questioned whether or not this was an intercepted captive release made to look like a rescue.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article4270908.ece | title = Brilliant or a sham?

=====Óscar Tulio Lizcano Freed=====

Lizcano, a Colombian Conservative Party congressman, was kidnapped 5 August 2000. On Sunday, 26 October 2008, the ex-congressman, Óscar Tulio Lizcano escaped from FARC-EP rebels. Tulio Lizcano was a hostage for over 8 years, and escaped with a FARC-EP rebel he convinced to travel with him. They evaded pursuit for three days as they trekked through mountains and jungles, encountering the military in the western coastal region of Colombia. Tulio Lizcano is the first hostage to escape since the successful military rescue of Ingrid Betancourt, and the longest held political hostage by the organization. He became the 22nd Colombian political hostage to gain freedom during 2008.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]
During his final days in captivity, Lizcano told Santos, they had nothing to eat but wild palm hearts and sugar cane. With the military tightening the noose, a FARC-EP rebel turned himself in and provided Colombian authorities with Lizcano's exact location in the northwest state of Choco. As police and army troops prepared to launch a rescue operation, Lizcano escaped alongside one of his guerrilla guards who had decided to desert. The two men hiked through the rain forest for three days and nights until they encountered an army patrol.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/world/6079567.html | title = FARC hostage escapes, has his captor to thank |work=Houston Chronicle | date = 26 October 2008[/tpl] Speaking from a clinic in the western city of Cali, Mr Lizcano said that when soldiers saw him screaming from across a jungle river, they thought he was drunk and ignored him. Only when he lifted the FARC-EP rebel's Galil assault rifle did the soldiers begin to understand that he was escaping from the FARC-EP rebels. "They jumped into the river, and then I started to shout, 'I'm Lizcano'", he said.

=====Other late 2008 developments=====

Soon after the liberation of this prominent political hostage, the Vice President of Colombia Francisco Santos Calderón called Latin America's biggest guerrilla group a "paper tiger" with little control of the nation's territory, adding that "they have really been diminished to the point where we can say they are a minimal threat to Colombian security", and that "After six years of going after them, reducing their income and promoting reinsertion of most of their members, they look like a paper tiger." However, he warned against any kind of premature triumphalism, because "crushing the rebels will take time." The [tpl]convert|500000|km2|sqmi|sp=us[/tpl] of jungle in Colombia makes it hard to track them down to fight.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&sid=aCsN3xsYNI0M&refer=latin_america | title = FARC Is a 'Paper Tiger' After Offensive, Desertions (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg  | date = 29 October 2008[/tpl]

====Release of Swedish hostage====

On 17 March 2009, The FARC-EP released Swedish hostage Erik Roland Larsson. Larsson, paralyzed in half his body, was handed over to detectives in a rugged region of the northern state of Córdoba. Larsson was kidnapped from his ranch in Tierralta, not far from where he was freed, on 16 May 2007, along with his Colombian girlfriend, Diana Patricia Pena while paying workers. She escaped that same month following a gun battle between her captors and police. Larsson suffered a stroke while in captivity. The FARC-EP had sought a $5 million ransom. One of Larsson's sons said that the ransom was not paid.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/18/farc-hostage-release-larsson |location=London |work=The Guardian    | first=Rory | last=McCarthy | title=Colombian FARC rebels release last known foreign hostage | date=18 March 2009[/tpl]

====December 2009 hostage killing====

On 22 December 2009, the body of Luis Francisco Cuéllar, the Governor of Caquetá, was discovered, a day after he had been kidnapped from his house in Florencia, Caquetá.

The kidnappers cut the governor's throat as they evaded security forces. In a statement broadcast on radio, the acting governor, Patricia Vega, said, "I no longer have any doubts that FARC has done it again." The FARC claimed responsibility for Cuéllar's kidnapping and murder in January 2010. The group said that they kidnapped him in order to "put him on trial for corruption" and blamed his death on an attempt to rescue him by force.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN05122506 | title=Colombian rebels say killed governor, blame Uribe | first=Hugh | last=Bronstein | date=6 January 2010 | work=Reuters[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8427582.stm |title=Kidnapped Colombian governor found with throat slit |date=23 December 2009 |publisher=BBC    |accessdate=23 December 2009[/tpl]

===Juan Manuel Santos's presidency===

President Juan Manuel Santos began his term with a suspected FARC bomb-blast in Bogotá.Staff (12 August 2010) "Car bomb rocks Colombian capital" BBC News This followed the resolution of the 2010 Colombia–Venezuela diplomatic crisis which erupted over outgoing President Álvaro Uribe's allegations of active Venezuelan support for FARC.

According to a December report by the Corporación Nuevo Arco Iris NGO, 473 FARC-EP guerrillas and 357 members of the Colombian security forces died in combat between January and September 2010. An additional 1,382 government soldiers or policemen were wounded during the same period, with the report estimating that the total number of casualties could reach 2,500 by the end of the year.Death of Mono Jojoy forces FARC to carry out different strategy: NGO. Colombia Reports. 1 December 2010. Nuevo Arco Iris head León Valencia considered that FARC guerrillas have reacted to a series of successful military blows against them by splitting up their forces into smaller groups and intensifying the offensive use of anti-personnel land mines, leading to what he called a further "degradation" of the conflict. Valencia also added that both coca crops and the drug trade have "doubled" in areas with FARC-EP presence. Researcher Claudia López considered that the Colombian government is winning the strategic and aerial side of the war but not the infantry front, where both the FARC-EP and ELN continue to maintain an offensive capacity.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] Colombianas FARC resisten con nueva estrategia tras duros golpes sufridos.AFP. 1 December 2010.

Second, any process must lead to the end of the conflict, not making it longer. Third, operations and military presence will be maintained across the entire national territory

The Colombian government has also stated that they expect that a post-Chavez government will continue to support the peace process. In late 2012, FARC declared a two-month unilateral cease-fire and said that they would be open to extending it as a bilateral truce afterwards during the rest of the negotiations. The Colombian government refused to agree to a bilateral cease-fire, alleging violations of the truce by FARC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/thomson-reuters/130115/colombia-expects-venezuelan-help-farc-talks-even-if-chavez-dies |title=Colombia expects Venezuelan help for FARC talks even if Chavez dies. |publisher=Globalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/01/201312016575695697.html |title=Colombia refuses to extend FARC ceasefire. |publisher=Aljazeera.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23[/tpl]

==Financing==

FARC receives most of its funding—which has been estimated to average some $300 million per year—from taxation of the illegal drug trade, ransom kidnappings, bank robberies, and extortion of large landholders, multinational corporations, and agribusiness. From taxation of illegal drugs alone, FARC has been estimated to receive approximately 60 to 100 million dollars per year.

===Drug trade===

FARC-EP was not initially involved in direct drug cultivation, trafficking, or trans-shipment prior to or during the 1980s. Instead, it maintained a system of taxation on the production that took place in the territories that they controlled, in exchange for protecting the growers and establishing law and order in these regions by implementing its own rules and regulations.Ferro Medina, Juan Guillermo: «Las FARC y su relación con la economía de la coca en el sur de Colombia: Testimonios de Colonos y Guerrilleros», L´ordinaire Latino-americain 179: enero-marzo de 2000.[tpl]cite book|title=America's other war: terrorizing Colombia |author=Doug Stokes|publisher=Zed Books |year=2005| isbn=978-1-84277-547-9 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=OoQSQw-v4pYC&pg=PA101&dq=farc+paramilitaries&cd=13#v=onepage&q=farc%20paramilitaries|pages=101–102[/tpl] During the 1990s, FARC expanded its operations, in some areas, to include trafficking and production, which has provided a significant portion of its funding.[tpl]cite book|title=Drugs and democracy in Latin America: the impact of U.S. policy |editors=Coletta Youngers, Eileen Rosin |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |year=2005 | isbn=978-1-58826-254-7 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=jAzNQGZ0AV4C&pg=PA103&dq=farc+paramilitaries&cd=54#v=onepage&q=farc%20paramilitaries | page=103|author1=Youngers, Coletta|author2=Rosin, Eileen[/tpl] Right-wing paramilitary groups also receive a large portion of their income from drug trafficking and production operations.
A 1992 Central Intelligence Agency report "acknowledged that the FARC had become increasingly involved in drugs through their 'taxing' of the trade in areas under their geographical control and that in some cases the insurgents protected trafficking infrastructure to further fund their insurgency",[tpl]cite book|last=Stokes|first=Doug|title=America's Other War: Terrorizing Colombia|year=2005|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84277-547-9|pages=86–87[/tpl] but also described the relationship between the FARC and the drug traffickers as one "characterized by both cooperation and friction" and concluded that "we do not believe that the drug industry Colombia would be substantially disrupted in the short term by attacks against guerrillas. Indeed, many traffickers would probably welcome, and even assist, increased operations against insurgents."Narco-Insurgent Links in the Andes 8, Central Intelligence Agency, 29 July 1992.
In 1994, the DEA came to three similar conclusions. First, that any connections between drug trafficking organizations and Colombian insurgents were "ad hoc 'alliances of convenience'".Drug Intelligent Report, Insurgent Involvement in the Colombian Drug Trade 16, Drug Enforcement Administration, Jun. 1994 Second, that "the independent involvement of insurgents in Colombia's domestic drug productions, transportation, and distribution is limited…there is no evidence that the national leadership of either the FARC or the ELN has directed, as a matter of policy, that their respective organizations directly engage in independent illicit drug production, transportation, or distribution."  Third, the report determined that the DEA "has no evidence that the FARC or ELN have been involved in the transportation, distribution, or marketing of illegal drugs in the United States. Furthermore it is doubtful that either insurgent group could develop the international transportation and logistics infrastructure necessary to establish independent drug distribution in the United States or Europe… DEA believes that the insurgents never will be major players in Colombia's drug trade."
FARC has called for crop substitution programs that would allow coca farmers to find alternative means of income and subsistence. In 1999, FARC worked with a United Nations alternative development project to enable the transition from coca production to sustainable food production. On its own, the group has also implemented agrarian reform programs in Putumayo.[tpl]cite book|title=Hugo Chávez: oil, politics and the challenge to the United States |author=Nikolas Kozloff |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |year=2007| isbn=978-1-4039-8409-8| url=http://books.google.com/?id=kYGdEtdZrFUC&pg=PA148&dq=farc+tax&cd=6#v=onepage&q=farc%20tax |page=148[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Colombia and the United States: war, unrest, and destabilization |author1=Mario A.

When growers in a FARC-controlled area are caught selling coca to non-FARC brokers, they are generally forced to leave the region, but when growers are caught selling to FARC in paramilitary-controlled areas, they are generally killed. Lower prices paid for raw coca in paramilitary-controlled areas lead to significantly larger profits for the drug processing and trafficking organizations, which means that they generally prefer that paramilitaries control an area rather than FARC.
In 2000, FARC Spokesman Simon Trinidad said that taxes on drug laboratories represented an important part of the organization's income, although he didn't say how much it was. He defended this funding source, arguing that drug trade was endemic in Colombia because it had pervaded many sectors of its economy.Simón Trinidad, FARC Spokesman at the Negotiating Table D.Streatfeild. 20 November 2000.

On 22 March 2006 the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales announced the indictment of fifty leaders of FARC for exporting more than $25 billion worth of cocaine to the United States and other countries. Several of the FARC leaders appeared on the Justice Department's Consolidated Priority Organization target list, which identifies the most dangerous international drug trafficking organizations. Recognizing the increased profits, the FARC moved to become directly involved in the manufacture and distribution of cocaine by setting the price paid for cocaine paste and transporting it to jungle laboratories under FARC control. The charged FARC leaders ordered that Colombian farmers who sold paste to non-FARC buyers would be murdered and that U.S. fumigation planes should be shot down.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/dea/pubs/pressrel/pr032206c.html|title=News from DEA, News Releases, 03/22/06|publisher=justice.gov|accessdate=2014-04-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/March06/farcindictmentpr.pdf |title=farc indictment |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14[/tpl]

During the 1984 peace negotiations, FARC pledged to stop kidnapping and condemned the practice. However, hostage-taking by FARC increased in the years following this declaration. In a 1997 interview, FARC-EP Commander Alfonso Cano argued that some guerrilla units continued to do so for "political and economic reasons" in spite of the prohibition issued by the leadership.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6a7e30.html | title = War Without Quarter: Colombia and International Humanitarian Law |work=Human Rights Watch | date = 1 October 1998[/tpl]
In 2000, the FARC-EP issued a directive called "Law 002" which demanded a "tax" from all individuals and corporations with assets worth at least $1 million USD, warning that those who failed to pay would be detained by the group. In 2001, FARC Commander Simón Trinidad claimed that the FARC-EP does not engage in kidnapping but instead "retains individuals in order to obtain resources needed for our struggle". Commander Trinidad said he did not know how many people had been taken by FARC or how much money was collected by the organization in exchange for their freedom. In addition, FARC spokesperson Joaquín Gómez stated that the payment demanded was a tax which many people paid "voluntarily", with kidnapping undertaken because "those who have the resources must pay their share".[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1399580/Colombia-Factfile-Kidnap-capital-of-the-world.html | title = Colombia Factfile: Kidnap capital of the world |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London   | date = 28 September 2001  | first=Jeremy | last=McDermott[/tpl]
In 2002, Amnesty International sent a letter to FARC-EP Commander Manuel Marulanda condemning kidnapping and hostage-taking as well as rejecting the threats directed at municipal or judicial officials and their families, arguing that they are civilians who are protected by international humanitarian law as long as they do not participate in hostilities.
According to Amnesty International, the number of kidnappings has decreased in recent years but the human rights organization estimates that FARC and ELN guerrillas continue to be behind hundreds of cases.

FARC has been accused of committing violations of human rights by numerous groups, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the United Nations as well as by the Colombian, U.S. and European Union governments.
A February 2005 report from the United Nations' High Commissioner for Human Rights mentioned that, during 2004, "FARC-EP continued to commit grave breaches human rights such as murders of protected persons, torture and hostage-taking, which affected many civilians, including men, women, returnees, boys and girls, and ethnic groups."Commission on Human Rights.

A 2001 Human Rights Watch report considered FARC-EP's refusal to admit children under fifteen years old into their forces to be "encouraging" but added that there is "little evidence that this rule is being strictly applied" and called on the group to demobilize all existing child soldiers and cease this practice in the future.
In 2003, Human Rights Watch reported that FARC-EP shows no leniency to children because of their age, assigning minors the same duties as adults and sometimes requiring them to participate in executions or witness torture.

===Extrajudicial executions===

FARC has consistently carried out attacks against civilians specifically targeting suspected supporters of paramilitary groups, political adversaries, journalists, local leaders, and members of certain indigenous groups since at least as early as 1994.Uppsala Conflict Data Program Conflict Encyclopedia, Colombia, One-Sided violence, FARC-Civilians, 1994–2010, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=35&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas# From 1994 to 1997 the region of Urabá in Antioquia department was the site of FARC attacks against civilians. FARC has also executed civilians for failing to pay "war taxes" to their group.
In 2001, Human Rights Watch (HRW) denounced that the FARC-EP had abducted and executed civilians accused of supporting paramilitary groups in the demilitarized zone and elsewhere, without providing any legal defense mechanisms to the suspects and generally refusing to give any information to relatives of the victims. The human rights NGO directly investigated three such cases and received additional information about over twenty possible executions during a visit to the zone.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/farc/Formatted%20FARC-Eng%208-241-02.htm#P155_22204 | title = 'International Humanitarian Law and its Application to the Conduct of the FARC-EP. – III. Abductions and Extrajudicial Executions'  |work=Human Rights Watch | date = August 2001[/tpl]
According to HRW, those extrajudicial executions would qualify as forced disappearances if they had been carried out by agents of the government or on its behalf, but nevertheless remained "blatant violations of the FARC-EP's obligations under international humanitarian law and in particular key provisions of article 4 of Protocol II, which protects against violence to the life, physical, and mental well-being of persons, torture, and ill-treatment."
The Colombian human rights organization CINEP reported that FARC-EP killed an estimated total of 496 civilians during 2000.

===Use of gas cylinder mortars and landmines===

The FARC-EP has employed a type of improvised mortars made from gas canisters (or cylinders), when launching attacks.
According to Human Rights Watch, the FARC-EP has killed civilians not involved in the conflict through the use of gas cylinder mortarsHuman Rights Watch.

Human Rights Watch considers that "the FARC-EP's continued use of gas cylinder mortars shows this armed group's flagrant disregard for lives of civilians...gas cylinder bombs are impossible to aim with accuracy and, as a result, frequently strike civilian objects and cause avoidable civilian casualties."Human Rights Watch.

According to the ICBL Landmine and Cluster Munitions Monitor, "FARC is probably the most prolific current user of antipersonnel mines among rebel groups anywhere in the world." Furthermore, FARC use child soldiers to carry and deploy antipersonnel mines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the-monitor.org/index.php/publications/display?act=submit&pqs_year=2009&pqs_type=lm&pqs_report=colombia&pqs_section= |title=Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor |publisher=The-monitor.org |accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl]

===Violence against indigenous people===

FARC has sometimes threatened or assassinated indigenous Colombian leaders for attempting to prevent FARC incursions into their territory and resisting the forcible recruitment by FARC of indigenous youth. Between 1986 and 2001, FARC was responsible for 27 assassinations, 15 threats, and 14 other abuses of indigenous people in Antioquia Department.
In March 1999 members of a local FARC contingent killed 3 indigenous rights activists, who were working with the U'Wa people to build a school for U'Wa children, and were fighting against encroachment of U'Wa territory by multinational oil corporations. The killings were almost universally condemned, and seriously harmed public perceptions of FARC.
Members of indigenous groups have demanded the removal of military bases set up by the Colombian government and guerrilla encampments established by FARC in their territories, claiming that both the Colombian National Army and the FARC should respect indigenous autonomy and international humanitarian law.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/epa/article/ALeqM5hcjyOYRTZS13urZy_whouPKUd9BA?docId=157311 |title=epa - european pressphoto agency: Indígenas colombianos exigen al Ejército y a las FARC desmontar sus "bases militares" |publisher=Google.com |date=2011-07-20 |accessdate=2012-10-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapress.org/articles.asp?art=6526 |title=::.

The Regional Indigenous Council of Cauca (CRIC) issued a statement concerning the release of two  hostages taken by FARC in 2011: "Compared to past statements made by the national government, it is important to reiterate that the presence of armed groups in our territories is a fact that has been imposed by force of arms, against which our communities and their leaders have remained in peaceful resistance." The CRIC also indicated that neither the Colombian government nor the mediators and armed groups involved consulted with the indigenous people and their authorities about the hostage release, raising concerns about the application of national and international law guaranteeing their autonomy, self-determination and self-government. The indigenous organization also demanded the immediate end of all violence and conflict within indigenous territories and called for a negotiated solution to the war.Colombia: Statement Concerning Release Of Two Indigenous Hostages By FARC - Indigenous Peoples Issues and Resources.

==Organization and structure==

FARC-EP remains the largest and oldest insurgent group in the Americas. According to the Colombian government, FARC-EP had an estimated 6,000–8,000 members in 2008, down from 16,000 in 2001, having lost much of their fighting force since President Álvaro Uribe took office in 2002.BBC News "Colombia Seizes 'key FARC Data'" 23 September 2008.
