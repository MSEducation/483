The Battle of Kaliakra[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl], usually known as the Attack of the ''Drazki ([tpl]lang-bg|Атаката на Дръзки[/tpl]) in Bulgaria, was a maritime action between four Bulgarian torpedo boats and the Ottoman cruiser Hamidiye'' in the Black Sea. It took place on 21 November 1912 at 32 miles off Bulgaria's primary port of Varna.
During the course of the First Balkan War, the Ottoman Empire's supplies were dangerously limited after the battles in Kirk Kilisse and Lule Burgas and the sea route from the Romanian port Constanţa to Istanbul became vital for the Ottomans. The Ottoman navy also imposed a blockade on the Bulgarian coast and on 15 October, the commander of the cruiser Hamidiye threatened to destroy Varna and Balchik, unless the two towns surrendered.
On 21 November an Ottoman convoy was attacked by the four Bulgarian torpedo boats Drazki (Bold), Latyashti (Flying), Smeli (Brave) and Strogi (Strict). As a result of the battle, the cruiser Hamidiye was torpedoed by Drazki and suffered heavy damage; only the calm sea prevented the ship from sinking. Half-sunk with her front parts underwater, she was towed to Istanbul. After this encounter, the Turks ceased any maritime operations close to the Bulgarian coastline.
