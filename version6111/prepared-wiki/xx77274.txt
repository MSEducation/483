The Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug, or DFS  (German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight) was formed in 1933 to centralise all gliding activity in Germany. It was formed by the nationalisation of the Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft (RRG) at Darmstadt.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl] 
The DFS was involved in producing training sailplanes for the Hitler Youth and Luftwaffe, as well as conducting research into advanced technologies such as flying wings and rocket propulsion. Notable DFS-produced aircraft include the DFS 230 transport glider (1600+ produced), the German counterpart to the British Airspeed Horsa glider, and the DFS 194 forerunner of the famous Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket fighter.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl]
In 1938, following a fatal accident at the Wasserkuppe, DFS held a competition to design a more effective speed brake for gliders.  The final design, produced by Wolfgang and Ulrich Hütter of Schempp-Hirth, is used to this day and generally referred to as the "Schempp-Hirth brake".

==Legacy of the DFS==

The modern DLR still does research into gliding flight, as the DFS once did - evidence of this is their enlarged 17-meter wingspan Glaser-Dirks DG-300 Elan high-performance glider, used to precisely set and measure comparative glider performance parameters.
