==Production==

Production of the show began in 2000. The pilot episode, All Growed Up, aired in 2001 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Rugrats. Production for the series later began in September 2002. During summer 2003, teasers for All Grown Up aired. However, the scenes shown were not clips from actual episodes of the show.
The show premiered on April 12, 2003, as a preview before starting its regular run in late November 2003. When the series did start its regular run, more than 3.2 million viewers tuned in, enough to put it into the 2nd place slot for the week (behind an NFL game on ESPN) and making it the highest-rated premiere in Nickelodeon's history at the time. (The April sneak peek didn't make the top 15 cable programs for that week, due to the ongoing war in Iraq.) It aired on Nick on CBS on September 18, 2004 and ended on September 17, 2005. The original titles for this series were All Growed Up! and Rugrats: All Growed Up!. 
In addition, in its first season, All Grown Up! had its first of two celebrity guest star: Lil Romeo as "Lil Q" (Cupid) in episode 11, "It's Cupid, Stupid".Lil' Romeo
Beginning in Season 4, the show would be put on hiatus numerous times between 2005-2008. The first began on October 10, 2005. The second began on November 25, 2006. And the final one began on November 30, 2007. The show premiered on Nicktoons on September 2005.
In early 2007, All Grown Up! was removed from the Nickelodeon schedule in the United States. Although it later returned, no new episodes have been produced since 2006.
Nickelodeon UK aired all 55 episodes before the end of 2006.  However, Nickelodeon in the United States didn't air all the episodes until 2008. 
Nickelodeon US aired most of the final season of All Grown Up! November 12, 2007 through November 30, 2007. The final three episodes aired on August 3, 2008, August 10, 2008, and August 17, 2008.
