The Monastery of the Transfiguration of Christ the Saviour ([tpl]lang-el|Μονή Μεταμορφόσεως Σωτήρος Χριστού[/tpl]), commonly known as the Soteros or Saviour Monastery (Μονή Σωτήρος, [tpl]lang-tr|Aya Sotiri manastırı[/tpl]) or as the Batheos Rhyakos Monastery (Μονή του Βαθέως Ρύακος), was a Byzantine-era monastery near modern Tirilye in Turkey (medieval Trigleia in Bithynia). The complex now lies ruined, although some buildings are used as animal shelters.
