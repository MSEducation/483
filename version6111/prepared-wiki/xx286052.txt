==1960 Fort Dix IM-99 accident==

"On 7 June 1960, an explosion in a helium tank the missile's fuel tanks[tpl]r|Imholtz[/tpl] took place in Shelter 204 causing a fire in a liquid-fueled, nuclear-tipped BOMARC missile. The fire burned uninhibited for about 30 minutes. Firefighting activities, using water as a suppressant, were conducted for 15 hours. As a result, materials from the shelter flowed under the front shelter doors, down the asphalt apron and street between the row of shelters, and into the drainage ditch".[tpl]r|Rademacher[/tpl]  "Contamination was restricted to an area immediately beneath the weapon and an adjacent elongated area approximately 100 feet long".quotation from http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/operation_and_plans/NuclearChemicalBiologicalMatters/21.pdf similar to 1981 DoD statemtent A nuclear response team from Griffiss Air Force Base found "no trace of dispersed radiation" during spot checks "outside the facility's boundaries" for [tpl]Convert|66|mi|abbr=on[/tpl].http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2012/July%202012/0712nuclear.aspx  Approximately [tpl]Convert|300|g|abbr=on[/tpl] of WGP was not recovered,http://www.hps1.org/aahp/public/AAHP_Special_Sessions/2008_Pittsburgh/Nuclear%20Weapons%20Accidents%20-%20Leasons%20Learned.pdf  and "a significant fraction of the radiological material contained in the weapon was shipped…to Medina Base, San Antonio TX"[tpl]r|Rademacher[/tpl] and then to Amarillo.[tpl]Cite report |last=McCulla et al |date=May 22, 1996 |title=BOMARC…Missile Accident Site Mitigation Review |url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/osti/258214.pdf |volume=LA-UR-96-1765 |publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory |accessdate=2013-07-08[/tpl]  After repairs to the Lakehurst rail linehttp://tri.gmnews.com/news/2002-05-16/Front_Page/005.html from April 2002-May 27, 2004,http://www.cpeo.org/lists/military/2004/msg00545.html [tpl]Convert|21998|yd3|abbr=on[/tpl] of "contaminated debris and soils were packaged, shipped, and disposed"Duratek 2006, cited by Rademacher at Clive, Utah,http://amcadminrec.com/pdfs/mcguire2/AR-1163.pdf [tpl]Convert|80|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] west[tpl]Where|reason=What is the name of the Utah storage location? |date=August 2013[/tpl] of Salt Lake City[tpl]r|Gambardello[/tpl]; the remains of the shelter were removed.
