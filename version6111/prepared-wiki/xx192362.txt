==History==

SunSetter was founded in 1988 in Malden, Massachusetts.[tpl]Citation|last= Haire|first=Thomas|title=DR Shines Bright for SunSetter|url=http://www.response-digital.com/response/201208#pg22|magazine=Response Magazine|accessdate=Aug 2012[/tpl] SunSetter’s mission is to provide the highest quality retractable awnings for the home at economical prices which are affordable to middle-America. SunSetter targets its products to both the do-it-yourself consumer and to consumers who are uncomfortable with self-installations.[tpl]Citation|last= Haire|first=Thomas|title=DR Shines Bright for SunSetter|url=http://www.response-digital.com/response/201208#pg22|magazine=Response Magazine|accessdate=Aug 2012[/tpl]

==Manufacturing==

SunSetter manufactures its retractable awnings in a [tpl]convert|72000|sqft|m2|sing=on[/tpl] facility in Malden, MA.  Because SunSetter targets the middle-income market, all of the awnings are mass-produced to keep costs low.[tpl]Citation|last= Qualters|first=Sheri|title=Made in the shade: Awning co. grows with contractors|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2006/03/06/story7.html|journal=Boston Business Journal|accessdate= 6 March 2006[/tpl] Two person teams assemble each awning based on the consumer's choice of color, size, and model.  Each awning is tested and operated in the factory before shipment. SunSetter has developed a large shipping network by partnering with UPS Freight to deliver awnings as long as [tpl]convert|20|ft|m[/tpl] directly to residential neighborhoods.

==Products==

SunSetter produces four different style deck and patio awnings and allows the customer to customize different features such as size and fabric color.[tpl]Citation|last= Qualters|first=Sheri|title=Made in the shade: Awning co. grows with contractors|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2006/03/06/story7.html|journal=Boston Business Journal|accessdate= 6 March 2006[/tpl] SunSetter manufactures two manually operated awnings with vertical support arms that open with a hand-crank, the 900XT and 1000XT models.  The XT models are similar in style and operation to awnings on recreational vehicles. SunSetter also offers three lateral arm awnings, the automatic Motorized model, Motorized XL model and the non-motorized VISTA model. Lateral arm awnings have support arms that expand directly under the awning fabric. The awnings are manufactured in one foot increments, ranging from seven feet to a maximum width of twenty feet. The awnings are available in many color choices.
The awning framework of all SunSetter deck and patio models mount directly onto the home using wall or soffit brackets and can be installed on every kind of siding.[tpl]Citation|last= Martin|first=Brett|title=Shade your deck|magazine=The Family Handyman|accessdate= March 2007[/tpl] The awning hardware is made of strong, lightweight, rust-proof aluminum. The weatherproof materials allow the awning to be closed against the house and kept on the home year round.
In addition to deck and patio awnings SunSetter also manufactures a freestanding retractable awning called the SunSetter Oasis.  The Oasis has the same stainless steel dual cable lateral arm technology as the Motorized and VISTA awning models.  Because the Oasis is freestanding it can be placed on any flat surface.
SunSetter also manufactures window awnings, telescoping flagpoles, vertical solar shades, screen rooms, and mats.
