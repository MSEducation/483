Tomasz Witold Drwal (born January 22, 1982) is a Polish mixed martial artist from Nowy Sącz. Drwal was a dominating light heavyweight fighter in Europe, gathering a record of 14–1 in various European MMA promotions before he signed a contract with the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

==Career==

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===

He lost his UFC debut against Thiago Silva at UFC 75 on September 8, 2007.
He returned to action after knee surgery at UFC 93 in January 2009 and defeated the debuting Ivan Serati via KO in the first round.
His next fight was a first round TKO over Mike Ciesnolevicz on the TUF 9 Finale on June 20, 2009 (a replacement for injured Eric Schafer).
Moving down to middleweight, he defeated Drew McFedries at UFC 103 in the second round by rear naked choke submission.
Drwal faced Rousimar Palhares on March 27, 2010 at UFC 111, losing after an early slip via heel hook submission which appeared to injure Drwal. Palhares was subsequently suspended for 90 days for continuing to apply pressure to the lock after the referee intervened.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/18482/ufc-111-suspensions-palhares-receives-disciplinary-action-riddle-out-indefinitely.mma |title=UFC 111 suspensions: Palhares receives disciplinary action, Riddle out indefinitely|publisher=MMAJunkie.com|date=March 28, 2010[/tpl] In fact, the heel hook caused no bone fractures,http://mmajunkie.com/news/18490/tomasz-drwals-x-rays-show-no-fractures-after-ufc-111-loss-mri-results-monday.mma which is to be expected since heel hooks are a danger to ankle and knee ligaments, as well as knee cartilage, not bones.
Drwal then fought David Branch on September 15, 2010 at UFC Fight Night 22.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/20222/tomasz-drwal-vs-dave-branch-expected-at-ufc-fight-night-22.mma|title=Tomasz Drwal vs David Branch expected at UFC Fight Night 22 |publisher=mmajunkie.com |date=August 9, 2010[/tpl] Drwal was initially set to fight Nick Catone who had to withdraw from the fight due to injury.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/20232/nick-catone-to-undergo-surgery-on-re-injured-shoulder-and-back-return-date-unknown.mma|title=Nick Catone to undergo surgery on re-injured shoulder and back, return date unknown|author=Steven Marrocco|publisher=MMAjunkie[/tpl] He lost the fight via unanimous decision. Following two subsequent losses, Drwal was released from his UFC contract.[tpl]cite web| url=http://garnekmedia.blogspot.com/2010/09/tomasz-drwal-juz-nie-bedzie-sie-bi-w.html| title=Drwal is not going to fight in UFC anymore|accessdate=September 20, 2010|publisher=http://garnekmedia.blogspot.com[/tpl]  (in Polish)

===Post-UFC===

Tomasz returned to his winning ways knocking out Leonardo Lucio Nascimento at FAŁ 2 in his native Poland. His next fights were for new Polish promotion called MMA Attack, in which to this point he had two fights, against Gary Padilla and Wes Swofford, and all of them he won, respectively by unanimous decision and submission via armbar in 1st round.

==Personal life==

Drwal runs his own gym in Poland, the "Change Gym", but trains also at Alliance Training Center in San Diego before his fights.
