Gregory "Rat" Rathbone is a character in Robert Muchamore's acclaimed CHERUB series. He was born in the Australian outback as the youngest son of the leader of a religious cult The Survivors, Joel Reagan. He is also the on-off boyfriend of Lauren Adams.

==Background and early life==

Rathbone was born in the Australian out back. He was brought up in difficult conditions, living all of his early life in the Survivor's ark, a building in North Australia containing the most radical of the cult Survivors, set up by Joel Reagan. He was often thrashed for bad behaviour. His mother committed suicide when Rathbone was young.

==Academia==

Rat is highly intelligent, although tests undertaken on CHERUB campus have failed to replicate the IQ of 197 that he claimed to possess while living in the Survivor's Ark. Due to him spending many years living with 'The Survivors' he has major gaps in his common sense. He enjoys reading and had a badly damaged copy of Oliver Twist which he read many times whilst in 'The Ark'.
