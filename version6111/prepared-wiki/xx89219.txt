The Peugeot 505 is a large family car produced by the French manufacturer Peugeot from 1979 to 1992 in Sochaux, France. The 505 was Peugeot's last rear-wheel drive car.[tpl]cite book | last = Allain | first = François | title = Guide Peugeot: Tous le modèles de 1970 à 1990 | publisher = E/P/A | isbn = 2-85120-493-9 | page = 60 | year = 1996 | language = French [/tpl] It was also manufactured outside France, for example in Argentina by Sevel from 1981 to 1995, China, Indonesia and Nigeria.
According to the manufacturer 1,351,254 Peugeot 505s were produced between 1978 and 1999: of these 1,116,868 were saloons/sedans.Musée de l'Aventure Peugeot.  The exhibit label (2012) states: «Le 505 fut produit de 1978 a 1999 en 1,351,254 exemplaires, dont 1,116,868 berlines.»

==History==

It is known as the "Work Horse" of Africa today.
The 505 was praised by contemporary journalists for its ride and handling, especially on rough and unmade roads; perhaps one reason for its popularity in less developed countries. "Remember that the 505´s predecessor, the 504, had an outstanding ride. It took a British-market model on a hard charging drive across the green lanes of the Chilterns. The impacts were well suppressed and the car veritably floated over the undulations and potholes. I concluded that the 505 is as good as the 504 (but no better)."Drivers & Motorists Review, Feb 1979 The 505 also had good ground clearance; if it wasn't enough though, Dangel offered a taller four-wheel drive version of the 505 estate equipped with either the intercooled turbodiesel 110 hp (81 kW) engine or the 130 hp 2.2 L petrol (96 kW) engine. The four-wheel drive 505 also had shorter gear ratios.
The interior styling was viewed positively in contemporary reviews: "Having settled into the 505's neat cockpit one notices how handsomely styled it all would appear to be. The tweed seats and brown trim look smart and less confrontational than offerings from a certain other French marque."Drivers & Motorists Monthly" (February 1979) But the ergonomics were criticised too: "The ashtray was competitively sized but is placed directly behind the gear stick. For British market cars, this will be a constant nuisance while our continental cousins will consider the placement quite logical and natural.""The Monthly Car Review" (February 1979).
The range was given a facelift, including an all new interior, in 1986, but European Peugeot 505 production began to wind down following the launch of the smaller Peugeot 405 at the end of 1987. Saloon production came to a halt in 1989, coincidentally with the launch of Peugeot's flagship 605, and estates in 1992. There was already a 405 estate by this stage, but the 605 was never sold as an estate. In some countries such as France and Germany, the 505 estate was used as an ambulance, a funeral car, police car, military vehicle and as a road maintenance vehicle. There were prototypes of 505 coupés and 505 trucks, and in France many people have modified 505s into pickup trucks themselves.
The 505 was one of the last Peugeot models to be sold in the United States, with sedan sales ending there in 1990 and wagon sales in 1991. The last sedans sold had PRV's 2.8 V6 engine only. Unique to the US were turbocharged station wagons, both with petrol and diesel engines. 505s were also sold in Australia (where they were assembled by Renault Australia from 1980 to 1981,TORQUE 909, September 2009, Vol 50, No. 8, page 14, worm.rkweb.org Retrieved on 30 September 2013 and by Leyland Australia from 1981 to 1983), Argentina, Chile, China, and New Zealand. In New York City, Peugeot 505s were used as taxicabs.
The car was summed up as follows by motoring writer Archie Vicar: "The 505 is a saloon with quite a pleasant appearance, quite efficient engines, quite comfortable seating, quite nice steering and a quite reasonable price. And it is quite well constructed. So, you might say it was merely average. But can it really be that simple? Have Peugeot in fact, played a very clever game where, instead of dazzling us with technology or breathtaking styling, they have decided to woo us with understatement of the profoundest kind?""The Monthly Car Review" (February 1979)
In Thailand, the Peugeot 505 was quite popular. They were available as a CKD version assembled in Bangkok, due to the restrictions on importing completely built-up cars.

==Mechanical characteristics==

The 505 had rear-wheel drive and the engine at the front, mounted longitudinally. The suspension system included MacPherson struts and coil springs at front and semi-trailing arms with coil springs at rear, with a body-mounted rear differential and four constant-velocity joints.  Station wagons (and most sedans built in Argentina) had instead a live-axle rear suspension, with Panhard rod and coil springs. Stabilizer bars were universal at front but model-dependent at rear. The car used disc brakes at the front, and either disc or drum brakes at the rear, depending on the model. The steering was a rack and pinion system, which was power assisted on most models.

==Break/Familiale==

Introduced in the spring of 1982, the Break (Estate) and Familiale versions were quite different from saloons. The wheelbase was also longer, to help make it one of the most spacious in the market, at [tpl]convert|2900|mm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. This was, not coincidentally, the same exact wheelbase as had been used on both the 404 and 504 estate derivatives.
The Familiale (family estate), with its third row of bench seats (giving a total of eight forward-facing seats), was popular with larger families and as a taxi. The two rows of rear seats could be folded to give a completely flat load area, with 1.94 cubic metres of load capacity. The total load carrying capacity is [tpl]convert|590|kg|lb|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. When released, it was hailed as a luxury touring wagon. The Familiale was marketed as the "SW8" in the United States, for "station wagon, eight seats."

==Engines==

A range of diesel and petrol engines were offered.[tpl]cite web|author=Tom Wright, developer@tomwright.me.uk |url=http://www.clubpeugeotuk.org/articles/peugeot_engine_codes.html |title=Peugeot engine codes |publisher=Clubpeugeotuk.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04[/tpl] The first diesels (XD2) arrived in July 1979, two months after the petrol versions.

===Gasoline===

The petrol engines had either four or six cylinders:

===Diesel===

The diesel engines were all four-cylinder:

==Trim levels==

505 models varied very much in equipment.  Base SRD cars with the 2,304 cc diesel engine didn't even have power steering, but the GTD Turbo, the GTI, the V6, and the TI all had power steering, central locking doors, air conditioning, a five-speed manual transmission, moonroof (except the GTD Turbo), and front fog lights. In the V6, the power steering was speed-sensitive, the central locking doors came with an infrared remote, and the heating and ventilation systems included electronic climate control. A three-speed automatic transmission was available on early 505s, which was later replaced by a four-speed unit. The most durable 505 model proved to be the GTD with a five-speed manual transmission. In Australia, the 505 was sold as a GR, SR, STi, or GTi sedan, or an SR or GTi eight-seater station wagon, all with petrol engines. Very few GRD and SRD diesel-engined 505s were sold in Australia. The Series II update saw the SR replaced with an SLi.
The United States and Canada had their own 505 body. Notable differences were: gas tank moved inwards (now behind rear bench), with filling neck on rightside, different style quad headlamps, taillights (pre-1986 sedans), distinctive whip antenna moved from roof to rear fender (and changed to telescopic), larger bumpers, tailpipe moved from right to left. Fewer engines were offered, all detuned to meet more restrictive emission standards. The models sold in North America were: Base, "GL", "S", "GLS", "STI", "DL", "Liberté", "STX", "Turbo", "GLX", "SW8", "V6", "Turbo S".
All North-American bound 505's were built in Peugeot's Sochaux Plant, in France. The Turbo estate version was unique to the North American markets.
