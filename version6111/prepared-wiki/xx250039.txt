The Raymond Street Jail was a jail in Brooklyn, New York City. With its cornerstone laid in a ceremony on August 27, 1836, Raymond Street Jail was the chief prison for Brooklyn before the latter was incorporated into New York City, and was closed on July 20, 1963. When initially constructed, an oversight of planning resulted in there being no front door, with one having to be cut into the walls. Originally for male prisoners, a female wing was added in 1839. It underwent several phases of construction, and was rebuilt in 1879 and 1909.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.correctionhistory.org/html/museum/gallery/raymondst/return2raymondst.html|title=Return to Raymond St. Jail|publisher=Correction History|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl]
