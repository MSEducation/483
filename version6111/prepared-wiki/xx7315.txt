[[Microsoft Windows]]

CATEGORIES: 1985 software, Microsoft Windows

Microsoft Windows is a series of graphical interface operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft.
Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20, 1985 as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).[tpl]cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/mstartinventions/a/Windows.htm?rd=1 |title=The Unusual History of Microsoft Windows |accessdate=April 22, 2007[/tpl] Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world's personal computer market with over 90% market share, overtaking Mac OS, which had been introduced in 1984.
[tpl]As of|April 2014[/tpl], the most recent versions of Windows for personal computers, smartphones, server computers and embedded devices are respectively Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Embedded 8.

==Version history==

The term Windows collectively describes any or all of several generations of Microsoft operating system products. These products are generally categorized as follows:

===Early versions===

The history of Windows dates back to September 1981, when Chase Bishop, a computer scientist, designed the first model of an electronic device and project "Interface Manager" was started. It was announced in November 1983 (after the Apple Lisa, but before the Macintosh) under the name "Windows", but Windows 1.0 was not released until November 1985.A history of Windows (at microsoft.com) Windows 1.0 was to compete with Apple's operating system, but achieved little popularity.  Windows 1.0 is not a complete operating system; rather, it extends MS-DOS. The shell of Windows 1.0 is a program known as the MS-DOS Executive. Components included Calculator, Calendar, Cardfile, Clipboard viewer, Clock, Control Panel, Notepad, Paint, Reversi, Terminal and Write. Windows 1.0 does not allow overlapping windows. Instead all windows are tiled. Only modal dialog boxes may appear over other windows.
Windows 2.0 was released in December 1987 and was more popular than its predecessor. It features several improvements to the user interface and memory management.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] Windows 2.03 changed the OS from tiled windows to overlapping windows. The result of this change led to Apple Computer filing a suit against Microsoft alleging infringement on Apple's copyrights.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/apple-vs-microsoft.html |title=The Apple vs. Microsoft GUI Lawsuit |year=2006 |accessdate=March 12, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~mjohnsen/Technology/Lawsuits/appvsms.html |title=Apple Computer, Inc. v. MicroSoft Corp., 35 F.3d 1435 (9th Cir. 1994) |accessdate=March 12, 2008[/tpl] Windows 2.0 also introduced more sophisticated keyboard shortcuts and could make use of expanded memory.
Windows 2.1 was released in two different versions: Windows/286 and Windows/386. Windows/386 uses the virtual 8086 mode of Intel 80386 to multitask several DOS programs and the paged memory model to emulate expanded memory using available extended memory. Windows/286, in spite of its name, runs on both Intel 8086 and Intel 80286 processors. It runs in real mode but can make use of the high memory area.
In addition to full Windows-packages, there were runtime-only versions that shipped with early Windows software from third parties and made it possible to run their Windows software on MS-DOS and without the full Windows feature set.
The early versions of Windows are often thought of as graphical shells, mostly because they ran on top of MS-DOS and use it for file system services.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.soft32.com/windows-evolution_1629.html |title=Windows Evolution |publisher=Soft32.com News[/tpl] However, even the earliest Windows versions already assumed many typical operating system functions; notably, having their own executable file format and providing their own device drivers (timer, graphics, printer, mouse, keyboard and sound). Unlike MS-DOS, Windows allowed users to execute multiple graphical applications at the same time, through cooperative multitasking. Windows implemented an elaborate, segment-based, software virtual memory scheme, which allows it to run applications larger than available memory: code segments and resources are swapped in and thrown away when memory became scarce; data segments moved in memory when a given application had relinquished processor control.

===Windows 3.0 and 3.1===

Windows 3.0, released in 1990, improved the design, mostly because of virtual memory and loadable virtual device drivers (VxDs) that allow Windows to share arbitrary devices between multi-tasked DOS applications.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl] Windows 3.0 applications can run in protected mode, which gives them access to several megabytes of memory without the obligation to participate in the software virtual memory scheme. They run inside the same address space, where the segmented memory provides a degree of protection. Windows 3.0 also featured improvements to the user interface. Microsoft rewrote critical operations from C into assembly. Windows 3.0 is the first Microsoft Windows version to achieve broad commercial success, selling 2 million copies in the first six months.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/compsoft/soft1991.htm |title=Chronology of Personal Computer Software[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |title=Microsoft Company[/tpl]
Windows 3.1, made generally available on March 1, 1992, featured a facelift. In August 1993, Windows for Workgroups, a special version with integrated peer-to-peer networking features and a version number of 3.11, was released. It was sold along Windows 3.1. Support for Windows 3.1 ended on December 31, 2001.[tpl]cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?LN=en-us&p1=3078&x=10&y=11 |title=Windows 3.1 Standard Edition Support Lifecycle |accessdate=January 3, 2011[/tpl]

===Windows 9x===

The next major consumer-oriented release of Windows, Windows 95, was released on August 24, 1995. While still remaining MS-DOS-based, Windows 95 introduced support for native 32-bit applications, plug and play hardware, preemptive multitasking, long file names of up to 255 characters, and provided increased stability over its predecessors. Windows 95 also introduced a redesigned, object oriented user interface, replacing the previous Program Manager with the Start menu, taskbar, and Windows Explorer shell. Windows 95 was a major commercial success for Microsoft; Ina Fried of CNET remarked that "by the time Windows 95 was finally ushered off the market in 2001, it had become a fixture on computer desktops around the world."[tpl]cite news|title=Windows 95 turns 15: Has Microsoft's OS peaked?|url= http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/08/25/cnet.microsoft.windows/index.html|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100826141242/http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/08/25/cnet.microsoft.windows/index.html|archivedate= 2010-08-26|publisher=CNET/CNN Tech|date=August 25, 2010|accessdate=August 22, 2012[/tpl] Microsoft published four OEM Service Releases (OSR) of Windows 95, each of which was roughly equivalent to a service pack. The first OSR of Windows 95 was also the first version of Windows to be bundled with Microsoft's web browser, Internet Explorer.[tpl]cite press release|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=14 February 2011|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1996/apr96/iemompr.mspx|title=Microsoft Internet Explorer Web Browser Available on All Major Platforms, Offers Broadest International Support|date=30 April 1996[/tpl] Mainstream support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2000 and extended support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2001.[tpl]cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=7864 |title=Windows 95 Support Lifecycle |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=January 3, 2011[/tpl]
Windows 95 was followed up with the release of Windows 98 on June 25, 1998, which introduced the Windows Driver Model, support for USB composite devices, support for ACPI, hibernation, and support for multi-monitor configurations. Windows 98 also included integration with Internet Explorer 4 through Active Desktop and other aspects of the Windows Desktop Update (a series of enhancements to the Explorer shell which were also made available for Windows 95). In May 1999, Microsoft released Windows 98 Second Edition, an updated version of Windows 98. Windows 98 SE added Internet Explorer 5.0 and Windows Media Player 6.2 amongst other upgrades. Mainstream support for Windows 98 ended on June 30, 2002 and extended support for Windows 98 ended on July 11, 2006.[tpl]cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=6513 |title=Windows 98 Standard Edition Support Lifecycle |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=January 3, 2011[/tpl]
On September 14, 2000, Microsoft released Windows ME (Millennium Edition), the last DOS-based version of Windows. Windows ME incorporated visual interface enhancements from its Windows NT-based counterpart Windows 2000, had faster boot times than previous versions (which however, required the removal of the ability to access a real mode DOS environment, removing compatibility with some older programs),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/fast-boot.mspx |title=Improving "Cold Boot" Time for System Manufacturers |publisher=Microsoft |date=2001-12-04 |accessdate=2010-08-26[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl] expanded multimedia functionality (including Windows Media Player 7, Windows Movie Maker, and the Windows Image Acquisition framework for retrieving images from scanners and digital cameras), additional system utilities such as System File Protection and System Restore, and updated home networking tools.[tpl]cite web|title=Windows Millennium Edition: All About Me|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/17791/article.html|publisher=PC World|accessdate=21 May 2013[/tpl] However, Windows ME was faced with criticism for its speed and instability, along with hardware compatibility issues and its removal of real mode DOS support. PC World considered Windows ME to be one of the worst operating systems Microsoft had ever released, and the 4th worst tech product of all time.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125772-2/the_25_worst_tech_products_of_all_time.html | title=The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time | publisher=PC World | accessdate=February 10, 2012[/tpl]

===Windows NT===

In November 1988, a new development team within Microsoft (which included former Digital Equipment Corporation developers Dave Cutler and Mark Lucovsky) began work on a revamped version of IBM and Microsoft's OS/2 operating system known as "NT OS/2". NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, multi-user operating system with POSIX compatibility and a modular, portable kernel with preemptive multitasking and support for multiple processor architectures. However, following the successful release of Windows 3.0, the NT development team decided to rework the project to use an extended 32-bit port of the Windows API known as Win32 instead of those of OS/2. Win32 maintained a similar structure to the Windows APIs (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be ported to the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel. Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows. However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own.[tpl]cite book | ref= harv | last= Custer | first= Helen | title= Inside Windows NT | publisher= Microsoft Press | location= Redmond | year= 1993 | ISBN=1-55615-481-X[/tpl]
The first release of the resulting operating system, Windows NT 3.1 (named to associate it with Windows 3.1) was released in July 1993 with versions for desktop workstations and servers. Windows NT 3.5 was released in September 1994, focusing on performance improvements and support for Novell's NetWare, and was followed up by Windows NT 3.51 in May 1995, which included additional improvements and support for the PowerPC architecture. Windows NT 4.0 was released in June 1996, introducing the redesigned interface of Windows 95 to the NT series. On February 17, 2000, Microsoft released Windows 2000, a successor to NT 4.0. The Windows NT name was dropped at this point in order to put a greater focus on the Windows brand.[tpl]cite web | last=Thurrott | first=Paul | title=Windows Server 2003: The Road To Gold - Part One: The Early Years | url=http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/winserver2k3_gold1.asp | date= 2003-01-24 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20050101005634/http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/winserver2k3_gold1.asp | archivedate = 2005-01-01| accessdate=2012-05-28[/tpl]

====Windows XP====

The next major version of Windows, Windows XP, was released on October 25, 2001. The introduction of Windows XP aimed to unify the consumer-oriented Windows 9x series with the architecture introduced by Windows NT, a change which Microsoft promised would provide better performance over its DOS-based predecessors. Windows XP would also introduce a redesigned user interface (including an updated Start menu and a "task-oriented" Windows Explorer), streamlined multimedia and networking features, Internet Explorer 6, integration with Microsoft's .NET Passport services, modes to help provide compatibility with software designed for previous versions of Windows, and Remote Assistance functionality.[tpl]cite web|title=Windows XP review|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/windows/microsoft-windows-xp-home/4505-3672_7-6534881.html|publisher=CNET|accessdate=24 May 2013[/tpl]
At retail, Windows XP was now marketed in two main editions: the "Home" edition was targeted towards consumers, while the "Professional" edition was targeted towards business environments and power users, and included additional security and networking features. Home and Professional were later accompanied by the "Media Center" edition (designed for home theater PCs, with an emphasis on support for DVD playback, TV tuner cards, DVR functionality, and remote controls), and the "Tablet PC" edition (designed for mobile devices meeting its specifications for a tablet computer, with support for stylus pen input and additional pen-enabled applications).[tpl]cite web|url=http://review.zdnet.com/4520-6033_16-4206552.html|title=The 10 top things you MUST know about Win XP|author=David Coursey|publisher=ZDNet|date=October 25, 2001|accessdate=July 22, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://review.zdnet.com/4520-6033_16-4206367.html |title=Your top Windows XP questions answered!

After Windows 2000, Microsoft also changed its release schedules for server operating systems; the server counterpart of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, was released in April 2003. It was followed in December 2005 by Windows Server 2003 R2.

====Windows Vista and later====

After a lengthy development process, Windows Vista was released on November 30, 2006 for volume licensing and January 30, 2007 for consumers. It contained a number of new features, from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant technical changes, with a particular focus on security features. It was available in a number of different editions, and has been subject to some criticism. Vista's server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 was released in early 2008.
On July 22, 2009, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 were released as RTM (release to manufacturing) while the former was released to the public 3 months later on October 22, 2009. Unlike its predecessor, Windows Vista, which introduced a large number of new features,[tpl]which|date=May 2013[/tpl] Windows 7 was intended to be a more focused, incremental upgrade to the Windows line, with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware with which Windows Vista was already compatible.[tpl]cite web |url=http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windows7/archive/2008/10/28/windows-7-unveiled-today-at-pdc-2008.aspx |title=Windows 7 Unveiled Today at PDC 2008 |author=Mike Nash |date=October 28, 2008 |work=Windows Team Blog |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=November 11, 2008[/tpl] Windows 7 has multi-touch support, a redesigned Windows shell with an updated taskbar, a home networking system called HomeGroup,[tpl]cite web |url=http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsexperience/archive/2008/10/28/how-libraries-amp-homegroup-work-together-in-windows-7.aspx |title=How Libraries & HomeGroup Work Together in Windows 7 |author=Brandon LeBlanc |date=October 28, 2008 |work=Windows Team Blog |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=November 11, 2008[/tpl] and performance improvements.
Windows 8, the successor to Windows 7, was released generally on October 28, 2012. A number of significant changes were made on Windows 8, including the introduction of a user interface based around Microsoft's Metro design language with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one PCs. These changes include the Start screen, which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually updated information, and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices. Other changes include increased integration with cloud services and other online platforms (such as social networks and Microsoft's own SkyDrive and Xbox Live services), the Windows Store service for software distribution, and a new variant known as Windows RT for use on devices that utilize the ARM architecture.[tpl]cite web|last=Case|first=Loyd|title=Test Driving Windows 8 RTM|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/260884/test_driving_windows_8_rtm.html|work=PC World|publisher=IDG|accessdate= September 9, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Rosoff|first=Matt|title=Here's Everything You Wanted To Know About Microsoft's Upcoming iPad Killers|url=http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-02-09/tech/31040510_1_steven-sinofsky-pcs-microsoft-first|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate= February 10, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/04/16/announcing-the-windows-8-editions.aspx |title=Announcing the Windows 8 Editions |publisher=Microsoft|date=April 16, 2012 |accessdate=April 17, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Building Windows for the ARM processor architecture|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/02/09/building-windows-for-the-arm-processor-architecture.aspx|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=November 21, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Microsoft talks Windows Store features, Metro app sandboxing for Windows 8 developers|url=http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/17/3026590/microsoft-windows-8-developers-windows-store-sandboxing|work=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate= September 8, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Build: More Details On Building Windows 8 Metro Apps|url=http://forwardthinking.pcmag.com/show-reports/287736-build-more-details-on-building-windows-8-metro-apps|work=PC Magazine|accessdate=February 10, 2012|first=Michael|last=Miller[/tpl] An update to Windows 8, called Windows 8.1, was released on October 17, 2013, and includes features such as new live tile sizes, deeper SkyDrive integration, and many other revisions.Windows 8.1 now available!.

====Multilingual support: IMEs and LIPs====

There are three main issues involved in making English-language Windows multilingual: 
(1) some languages require an Input Method Editor (IME) to enter text, (2) many users want application menus (such as MS Office menus) to display in their own language, and they may also want to use a keyboard that matches the normal keyboard layout and marking for their own language, and (3) some users want Windows menus and messages to display in their own language, i.e. they want to be able to switch from an English Windows environment to another language.
For languages like Italian, Spanish, French and German, (2) alone may suffice. For languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK), an IME (1) is also required. This is bundled with the corresponding language version of Windows, but is also available as a separate download for English Windows, as described below; (1) and (2) can be essentially free (apart from the custom keyboard). 
For some languages, (3), multilingual support for Windows, is a free download for Windows XP and later—but it requires Windows 7 Ultimate or better for languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.
[tpl]anchor|ime[/tpl](1) After releasing Chinese, Japanese, and Korean bundles of Office 2010 and IME 2010, 
Microsoft made IME 2010 available as a free upgrade for users of the earlier IME versions of Windows. Microsoft later made these Chinese, Japanese, and Korean IME versions available free to users of Windows XP and later, including English Windows XP (but now says that users should own some version of MS Office).Download IME 2010 Microsoft. Each IME package enables the entering of text in the corresponding language; necessary fonts may be bundled with it (or supplementary fonts offered with the corresponding version of Office).
[tpl]anchor|lipso[/tpl](2) Microsoft now also offers Language Interface Packs (LIPs) for MS Office. Some LIPs are free;MS Office Language Interface Packs Microsoft. some "Language Packs" (such as the CJK ones) are sold separately and may include spelling and grammar checking tools.MS Office Language Packs Microsoft.
(Recent application software from some companies may support two or more popular languages).
[tpl]anchor|lipsw[/tpl](3) Microsoft now also offers Language Interface Packs (LIPs) that allow users to view Windows menus, dialog boxes, and other user interface items in their preferred language. These are free; most are for English Windows (XP and later)—however, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean LIP downloads require Windows 7 Ultimate or Enterprise.Download Windows Language Interface Packs Microsoft. These LIPs include IMEs where applicable. 

====Platform support====

Windows NT included support for several different platforms before the x86-based personal computer became dominant in the professional world. Windows NT 4.0 and its predecessors supported PowerPC, DEC Alpha and MIPS R4000. (Although some these platforms implement 64-bit computing, the operating system treated them as 32-bit.) However, Windows 2000, the successor of Windows NT 4.0, dropped support for all platforms except the third generation x86 (known as IA-32) or newer in 32-bit mode. The client line of Window NT family still runs on IA-32, although the Windows Server line has ceased supporting this platform with the release of Windows Server 2008 R2.
With the introduction of the Intel Itanium architecture (IA-64), Microsoft released new versions of Windows to support it. Itanium versions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 were released at the same time as their mainstream x86 counterparts. Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, released in 2005, is the last Windows client operating systems to support Itanium. Windows Server line continued to support this platform until Windows Server 2012; Windows Server 2008 R2 is the last Windows operating system to support Itanium architecture.
On April 25, 2005, Microsoft released Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions to support the x86-64 (or simply x64), the eighth generation of x86 architecture. Windows Vista was the first client version of Windows NT to be released simultaneously in IA-32 and x64 editions. x64 is still supported.
An edition of Windows 8 known as Windows RT was specifically created for computers with ARM architecture.

===Windows CE===

Windows CE (officially known as Windows Embedded Compact), is an edition of Windows that runs on minimalistic computers, like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones. Windows Embedded Compact is based on its own dedicated kernel, dubbed Windows CE kernel. Microsoft licenses Windows CE to OEMs and device makers. The OEMs and device makers can modify and create their own user interfaces and experiences, while Windows CE provides the technical foundation to do so.
Windows CE was used in the Dreamcast along with Sega's own proprietary OS for the console. Windows CE was the core from which Windows Mobile was derived. Its successor, Windows Phone 7, was based on components from both Windows CE 6.0 R3 and Windows CE 7.0. Windows Phone 8 however, is based on the same NT-kernel as Windows 8.
Windows Embedded Compact is not to be confused with Windows XP Embedded or Windows NT 4.0 Embedded, modular editions of Windows based on Windows NT kernel.

==Security==

Consumer versions of Windows were originally designed for ease-of-use on a single-user PC without a network connection, and did not have security features built in from the outset.Multi-user memory protection was not introduced until Windows NT and XP, and a computer's default user was an administrator until Windows Vista. Source: UACBlog. However, Windows NT and its successors are designed for security (including on a network) and multi-user PCs, but were not initially designed with Internet security in mind as much, since, when it was first developed in the early 1990s, Internet use was less prevalent.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0883396.html |title=Telephones and Internet Users by Country, 1990 and 2005 |publisher=Information Please Database |accessdate=June 9, 2009[/tpl]
These design issues combined with programming errors (e.g. buffer overflows) and the popularity of Windows means that it is a frequent target of computer worm and virus writers. In June 2005, Bruce Schneier's Counterpane Internet Security reported that it had seen over 1,000 new viruses and worms in the previous six months.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0506.html |title=Crypto-Gram Newsletter |author=Bruce Schneier |authorlink=Bruce Schneier |date=June 15, 2005 |publisher=Counterpane Internet Security, Inc. |accessdate=April 22, 2007[/tpl] In 2005, Kaspersky Lab found around 11,000 malicious programs—viruses, Trojans, back-doors, and exploits written for Windows.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3601946 |title=Linux Malware On The Rise |author=Andy Patrizio |date=April 27, 2006 |work=InternetNews |publisher=QuinStreet |accessdate=January 3, 2011[/tpl]
Microsoft releases security patches through its Windows Update service approximately once a month (usually the second Tuesday of the month), although critical updates are made available at shorter intervals when necessary.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Windows/Microsofts-Security-Response-Center-How-Little-Patches-Are-Made/ |title=Microsoft's Security Response Center: How Little Patches Are Made |author=Ryan Naraine |date=June 8, 2005 |work=eWeek |publisher=Ziff Davis Enterprise |accessdate=January 3, 2011[/tpl] In versions of Windows after and including Windows 2000 SP3 and Windows XP, updates can be automatically downloaded and installed if the user selects to do so.

While the Windows 9x series offered the option of having profiles for multiple users, they had no concept of access privileges, and did not allow concurrent access; and so were not true multi-user operating systems. In addition, they implemented only partial memory protection. They were accordingly widely criticised for lack of security.
The Windows NT series of operating systems, by contrast, are true multi-user, and implement absolute memory protection. However, a lot of the advantages of being a true multi-user operating system were nullified by the fact that, prior to Windows Vista, the first user account created during the setup process was an administrator account, which was also the default for new accounts. Though Windows XP did have limited accounts, the majority of home users did not change to an account type with fewer rights – partially due to the number of programs which unnecessarily required administrator rights – and so most home users ran as administrator all the time.
Windows Vista changes thisMicrosoft describes in detail the steps taken to combat this in a TechNet bulletin. Source: Windows Vista Security and Data Protection Improvements. by introducing a privilege elevation system called User Account Control. When logging in as a standard user, a logon session is created and a token containing only the most basic privileges is assigned. In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system. When logging in as a user in the Administrators group, two separate tokens are assigned. The first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator, and the second is a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive. User applications, including the Windows Shell, are then started with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account. When an application requests higher privileges or "Run as administrator" is clicked, UAC will prompt for confirmation and, if consent is given (including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is not a member of the administrators group), start the process using the unrestricted token.[tpl]cite web |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |title=Windows Vista for Developers – Part 4 – User Account Control |author=Kenny Kerr |date=September 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2007[/tpl]

===File permissions===

All Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as AGLP (Accounts, Global, Local, Permissions) AGDLP which in essence where file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members. These global groups then hold other groups or users depending on different Windows versions used. This system varies from other vendor products such as Linux and NetWare due to the 'static' allocation of permission being applied directory to the file or folder. However using this process of AGLP/AGDLP/AGUDLP allows a small number of static permissions to be applied and allows for easy changes to the account groups without reapplying the file permissions on the files and folders.

===Windows Defender===

On January 6, 2005, Microsoft released a Beta version of Microsoft AntiSpyware, based upon the previously released Giant AntiSpyware. On February 14, 2006, Microsoft AntiSpyware became Windows Defender with the release of Beta 2. Windows Defender is a freeware program designed to protect against spyware and other unwanted software. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 users who have genuine copies of Microsoft Windows can freely download the program from Microsoft's web site, and Windows Defender ships as part of Windows Vista and 7.[tpl]cite web |url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/products/features/security-safety|title=Windows Vista: Security & Safety|publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=April 16, 2012[/tpl] In Windows 8, Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials have been combined into a single program, named Windows Defender. It is based on Microsoft Security Essentials, borrowing its features and user interface. Although it is enabled by default, it can be turned off to use another anti-virus solution.[tpl]cite web |url=http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-security/how-do-i-keep-windows-8-consumer-preview-secure/acd2bfea-ed36-401e-9050-f2fe4212ecf3 |title=Microsoft Answers: How do I keep Windows 8 Consumer Preview secure from malware?|publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=April 16, 2012[/tpl] Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool and the optional Microsoft Safety Scanner are two other free security products offered by Microsoft.

A study conducted by Kevin Mitnick and marketing communications firm Avantgarde in 2004 found that an unprotected and unpatched Windows XP system with Service Pack 1 lasted only 4 minutes on the Internet before it was compromised, and an unprotected and also unpatched Windows Server 2003 system was compromised after being connected to the internet for 8 hours.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.avantgarde.com/ttln113004.html |title=Automated "Bots" Overtake PCs Without Firewalls Within 4 Minutes |date=November 30, 2004 |work=Avantgarde |publisher=Avantgarde |accessdate=January 3, 2011[/tpl] This study does not apply to Windows XP systems running the Service Pack 2 update (released in late 2004), which vastly improved the security of Windows XP.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] The computer that was running Windows XP Service Pack 2 was not compromised.

Typical suggestions include deploying Microsoft Windows behind a hardware or software firewall, running anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and installing patches as they become available through Windows Update.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.computer-security-news.com/0969/5-steps-to-securing-your-windows-xp-home-computer |title=5 Steps To Securing Your Windows XP Home Computer |author=Richard Rogers |date=September 21, 2009 |work=Computer Security News |publisher=Computer Security News |accessdate=January 3, 2011[/tpl]

==Alternative implementations==

Owing to the operating system's popularity, a number of applications have been released that aim to provide compatibility with Windows applications, either as a compatibility layer for another operating system, or as a standalone system that can run software written for Windows out of the box. These include:
