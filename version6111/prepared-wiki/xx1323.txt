[[Calorie]]

CATEGORIES: Units of energy, Heat transfer, Non-SI metric units

The name calorie is used for two units of energy.
Although these units are part of the metric system, they have been superseded in the International System of Units by the joule.  One small calorie is approximately 4.2 joules (so one large calorie is about 4.2 kilojoules). The factor used to convert calories to joules at a given temperature is numerically equivalent to the specific heat capacity of water expressed in joules per kelvin per gram or per kilogram. The precise conversion factor depends on the definition adopted.
In spite of its non-official status, the large calorie is still widely used as a unit of food energy in the US, UK and some other Western countries.  The small calorie is also often used for measurements in chemistry, although the amounts involved are typically recorded in kilocalories.
The calorie was first defined by Nicolas Clément in 1824 as a unit of heat, and entered French and English dictionaries between 1841 and 1867. The word comes from Latin calor meaning "heat".

==Definitions==

The energy needed to increase the temperature of a given mass of water by 1 °C depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature. Accordingly, several different precise definitions of the calorie have been used.
The pressure is usually taken to be the standard atmospheric pressure ([tpl]val|101.325|u=kPa[/tpl]). The temperature increase can be expressed as one kelvin, which means the same as an increment of one degree Celsius.

==Usage==

The calorie was first defined specifically to measure energy in the form of heat, especially in experimental calorimetry.

===Nutrition===

In nutritional contexts, the kilojoule (kJ) is the SI unit of food energy. However, the calorie and kilocalorie are still in common use.[tpl]cite web|title=Prospects improve for food energy labelling using SI units|url=http://metricviews.org.uk/2012/02/prospects-improve-for-food-energy-labelling-using-si-units/|work=Metric Views|publisher=UK Metric Association|accessdate=17 April 2013|date=24 February 2012[/tpl]
In these contexts, confusingly, the word "calorie" and "kilocalorie" refer to equivalent units (the former to the large calorie and the latter to [tpl]gaps|1|000[/tpl] small calories). Sometimes, in an attempt to avoid confusion, the large calorie is written as "Calorie" (with a capital "C").  This convention is not always followed, and not explained to the average person clearly.
These quantities are often used for the total amount of food energy (e.g., in a meal) and for the specific energy, namely amount of energy per unit of mass (e.g. "calories per gram", "calories per serving"). Nutritional requirements or intakes are often expressed in calories per day.

===Chemistry===

In scientific contexts, the term calorie almost always refers to the small calorie. Even though it is not an SI unit, it is still used in chemistry. For example, the energy released in a chemical reaction per mole of reagent is occasionally expressed in kilocalories per mole. Traditionally, this use was largely due to the ease with which it could be calculated in laboratory reactions, especially in aqueous solution: a volume of reagent dissolved in water forming a solution, with concentration expressed in moles per liter (1 liter weighing 1 kg), will induce a temperature change in degrees Celsius in the total volume of water solvent, and these quantities (volume, molar concentration and temperature change) can then be used to calculate energy per mole. It is also occasionally used to specify energy quantities that relate to reaction energy, such as enthalpy of formation and the size of activation barriers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] However, its use is being superseded by the SI unit, the joule, and multiples thereof such as the kilojoule.
