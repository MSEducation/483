==Storylines== 

===2003–06===

When Aaron was young, his parents, Gordon Livesy (Gordon Fletcher) and Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter), separated and Chas left her son to live with his father and Gordon's second wife, Sandra (Janet Bamford). Aaron visits his mother in Emmerdale, where he tells her that he resents her for not raising him and explains that he feels that she abandoned him. The two begin to bond, before Aaron returns home to his father. Aaron returns to visit Chas, but she reprimands him after she catches him talking to other people about her behind her back. Louise Appleton (Emily Symons) witnesses Chas slapping Aaron and tells Gordon when he arrives to collect his son. Gordon tells Chas that her relationship with her son is over and that Aaron will not visit her again. Despite this, Aaron returns to Emmerdale several months later, staying longer than expected as he came into contact with a person who had German measles and Sandra was pregnant. Aaron returns home to his father and his stepmother, after telling Chas that while she was in the Army, her partner Carl King (Tom Lister) had a one night stand with her cousin, Del Dingle (Hayley Tamaddon).

===2008–12===

Aaron returns to the village two years later when arrested by Ross Kirk (Samuel Anderson) for possession of drugs. He is cautioned and meets his mother. Aaron later runs away and Gordon reveals that he threw Aaron out for hitting Sandra. Chas's family learn that Aaron is a drug courier for the McFarlanes and they bring him to Emmerdale, after Gordon refuses to take him back. Aaron clashes with Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins), but they eventually become friends and Aaron helps rescue her when she falls into a frozen lake. After Aaron convinces his cousin, Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper), to take the day off school and is caught stealing, her mother Lisa (Jane Cox) throws him out. So he and Chas move into Smithy Cottage with Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt), until he catches Aaron selling drugs. Aaron gets a job at the garage.
Aaron begins dating Victoria and loses his virginity to her but they break up when he discovers her relationship with her foster-brother, Daz Eden. Aaron then dates Holly Barton (Sophie Powles) and make friends with her brother, Adam (Adam Thomas). When Aaron ignites a bale of hay at the Bartons' farm, Holly's father, John (James Thornton), hits him and locks him in a stable. Aaron reports John to the police but drops the charges. Aaron discovers that Chas has resumed her relationship with Carl and he tells her that he wants nothing more to do with her. After Aaron and Adam are involved in a run-off-road collision, Aaron tries to kiss Adam. Aaron is embarrassed and tells Adam that he misunderstood the situation. Aaron sleeps with Holly and Adam tells his family that he thinks Aaron is gay. Adam tells Aaron that he is fine with him being gay, but he does not want his sister to be used. Aaron denies it but Holly ends their relationship.

===Characterisation===

Violent, angry and always in trouble, the character quickly established himself as the 'baddest' of bad boys. Describing Aaron, Lucy Pargeter (Chas Dingle) said "Aaron's an absolute pain in the arse for Chas. Danny Miller, who plays him, is brilliant. He gives so much and he's only young".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a150441/emmerdales-chas-on-lexi-aaron-and-cain.html|title='Emmerdale's Chas on Lexi, Aaron and Cain|publisher=Digital Spy|first=Kris|last=Green|date=24 March 2009|accessdate=12 April 2010[/tpl]

===Sexuality===

A high profile storyline for the character was when he began to question his sexual orientation. As the storyline progressed, Aaron was seen struggling to come to terms with his sexuality, before admitting the truth to his friend and guardian Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a209145/miller-enjoying-dales-plot-challenge.html|title=Miller 'enjoying' Dales plot challenge|publisher=Digital Spy|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=17 March 2010|accessdate=12 April 2010[/tpl] Miller admits that he was apprehensive when the Emmerdale writers approached him and told him they were making Aaron gay. Miller said "Being a straight actor and having to kiss another lad, I'm not going to lie, I was a bit worried about it, because it's a great test of your acting skills." Miller's co-star, Dominic Brunt has praised the storyline and told Media and Entertainment website, Digital Spy, that "It's done more realistically than I've seen in a soap." He went on to describe Aaron as being a homophobic homosexual, who doesn't like what he is.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a210459/brunt-emmerdale-gay-plot-is-fantastic.html|title=Brunt: 'Emmerdale gay plot is fantastic'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=24 March 2010|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl] Miller has stated that he is enjoying the challenge presented by the storyline saying "It's definitely been a big challenge - I feel a big responsibility to get this right and portray it in a way that makes it real, because there are so many lads who are going through what Aaron is going through".[tpl]cite web|url=http://celebrity.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=152601156|title=Livesy: Gay plot is responsibility|date=16 March 2010|publisher=MSN Celebrity|accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl] Miller's co-star James Sutton, who previously played a gay character in Hollyoaks, has said that Miller did not need any advice for the role and said, "We've chatted but I've given him no advice - he's a great actor, he doesn't need me to give him any pointers".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/untitled/story/20810.html|title=Dales James: Danny needs no advice|publisher=TV.com|date=19 January 2010|accessdate=12 April 2010[/tpl]
Emmerdale producer Gavin Blyth explained the gay plotline to Miller saying, "There are hundreds of thousands of teenage lads out there who are struggling with it as we speak - they're sexually confused". He also added "Aaron keeps it in so much because he's worried about what people think of him".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/interviews/a189197/danny-miller-aaron-livesy-emmerdale.html|title=Danny Miller (Aaron Livesy, 'Emmerdale')|publisher=Digital Spy|first=Kris|last=Green|date=1 December 2009|accessdate=12 April 2010[/tpl] Miller has admitted that he felt "awkward" and "strange" when he filmed an intimate moment with his Emmerdale co-star Adam Thomas, who is his real-life flatmate.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a189242/miller-dales-twist-was-strange-to-film.html|title=Miller: 'Dales twist was strange to film'|publisher=Digital Spy|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=2 December 2009|accessdate=12 April 2010[/tpl] He said "You'd never think yourself to be in the position that these two are in.

===Departure===

On 18 November 2011, Miller announced he would be leaving Emmerdale in 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a351625/emmerdale-star-danny-miller-to-leave-soap.html|title='Emmerdale' star Danny Miller to leave soap|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=18 November 2011|work=Digital Spy|publisher=Hearst Magazines UK|accessdate=18 November 2011[/tpl] Of his decision to leave, Miller said "It has been an incredibly difficult decision but after three years playing Aaron and much soul-searching, I am eager to explore other roles. I am so grateful to Emmerdale for the opportunity that I have been given and have loved every moment. I will miss everyone enormously but this might not be the last we see of Aaron." Series producer Stuart Blackburn said he respected Miller's decision and was grateful for the hard work he had put into the role of Aaron. On 20 January 2012, Miller revealed the Emmerdale team were still discussing how to write out Aaron.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a361223/emmerdale-aaron-exit-keeps-changing-says-danny-miller.html|title='Emmerdale' Aaron exit keeps changing, says Danny Miller|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=20 January 2012|work=Digital Spy|publisher=Hearst Magazines UK|accessdate=20 January 2012[/tpl] The actor said "They keep chopping and changing it - I think because they want to make it quite impactful and dramatic. I hope it's not leaving in the back of a cab, but there's great storyliners and a great team there."
In February 2012, Susan Hill of the Daily Star reported Aaron would exit the village in "heartbreaking scenes" after turning down the chance to leave with his new man, Ed Roberts (Lloyd Everitt).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/posts/view/234933/Emmerdale-s-Aaron-Livesy-in-sad-end/|title=Aaron Livesy in sad end|last=Hill|first=Susan|date=12 February 2012|work=Daily Star|publisher=Northern & Shell|accessdate=12 February 2012[/tpl] Hill said the show's bosses were desperate to get the character's departure right and spent months coming up with a dramatic storyline. Details of what happens to stop Aaron having a happy ending were being kept under wraps. The following month, Miller and other members of the cast and crew were spotted filming Aaron's final scenes at Robin Hood Airport.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thornegazette.co.uk/news/local-news/spoiler_alert_emmerdale_filming_danny_miller_s_exit_at_doncaster_airport_1_4303931|title=Spoiler Alert: Emmerdale filming Danny Miller’s exit at Doncaster Airport|date=1 March 2012|work=Thorne and District Gazette|publisher=Johnston Press|accessdate=1 March 2012[/tpl] Paul Millar of Digital Spy reported that Aaron's final scenes could see him on the run from the police after being accused of setting fire to the garage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a368841/emmerdales-aaron-livesy-exit-details-revealed.html|title='Emmerdale's Aaron Livesy exit details revealed?|last=Millar|first=Paul|date=1 March 2012|work=Digital Spy|publisher=Hearst Magazines UK|accessdate=1 March 2012[/tpl] Aaron made his last screen appearance on 5 April 2012.
