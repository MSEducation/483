Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms (COBR)Emergency Response - Central Government Arrangements - cabinetoffice.gov.ukEmergencies: the legal and operational framework - cabinetoffice.gov.uk refers to the location for a type of crisis response committee set up to coordinate the actions of bodies within the government of the United Kingdom in response to instances of national or regional crisis, or during events abroad with major implications for the UK. The constitution of a COBR meeting depends on the nature of the incident but it is usually chaired by the Prime Minister or another senior minister, with other key ministers as appropriate, and representatives of relevant external organizations such as the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Local Government Association.[tpl]cite news |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/publicservices/story/0,11032,816220,00.html|title=What is Cobra|work=The Guardian|accessdate=15 Sep 2009 | location=London | date=21 October 2002 | first=Joey | last=Gardiner[/tpl]
COBR meetings are generally held in one of the Cabinet Office buildings in Whitehall, London. Each is held in a secure room fitted with video and audio links able to display all intelligence information relevant to the situation under discussion. Unlike the equivalent U.S. facility, the White House Situation Room, it is only staffed during each period of use. It is actually on the first floor of the building and not below ground.
It is often referred to as COBRA or Cobra by the media; this relates to the acronym for Cabinet Office Briefing Room A as the meetings were usually held in Conference Room A[tpl]cite web |url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/facts/cobr.aspx |title=Key facts about COBR(A) |date=7 September 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2012[/tpl] at the Cabinet Office main building at 70 Whitehall. This abbreviation is no longer used within the Cabinet Office. Official papers bear a logo based on that of the Cabinet Office with the addition of the words "Briefing Rooms".[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.scotsman.com/iran/Blair-convenes-Cobra-team-as.3357226.jp |title=Blair convenes Cobra team as crisis in Iran escalates |author=Brian Brady |work=Scotland on Sunday |date=25 March 2007 |accessdate=28 April 2009[/tpl]Sir Gus O'Donnell, Cabinet Secretary, interviewed on BBC TV programme The Secret World of Whitehall, 2011 There is no basis to the widespread story that it was originally referred to simply as "Briefing Room A" and that the words "Cabinet Office" were added to give the acronym a more virile character. In 2009, former senior police officer Andy Hayman, who sat on the committee after the 7 July 2005 London bombings and at other intervals from 2005 to 2007, was highly critical of its workings in his book The Terrorist Hunters.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article6552590.ece?print=yes&randnum=1151003209000|title=Cobra emergency committee 'slows everything down'|last=O'Neil|first=Sean |date=June 22, 2009|work=The Times|publisher=News International|accessdate=3 January 2010|location=London[/tpl]
