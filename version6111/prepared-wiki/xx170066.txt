Batman Forever: Original Music from the Motion Picture is the 1995 soundtrack to the motion picture Batman Forever.

==Background==

Only five of the songs are actually featured in the movie.[tpl]cite web |first=Chris |last=Willman |title=Feature: ROCKIN' IN THE REEL WORLD |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,297888,00.html |date=July 14, 1995 |publisher=Time Inc. |accessdate=October 6, 2009[/tpl] Hit singles from the soundtrack include "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me" by U2 and "Kiss from a Rose" by Seal, both of which were nominated for MTV Movie Awards. "Kiss from a Rose" (whose video was also directed by Joel Schumacher) reached No. 1 in the U.S. charts as well. The soundtrack itself, featuring additional songs by The Flaming Lips, Brandy (both songs also included in the film), Method Man, Nick Cave, Michael Hutchence (of INXS), PJ Harvey, and Massive Attack, was an attempt to (in producer Peter MacGregor-Scott's words) make the film more "pop". The soundtrack was hugely successful, selling almost as many copies as Prince's soundtrack to the 1989 Batman film.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=Batman&artist=&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |title=RIAA |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=January 2, 2011[/tpl] A second album, featuring over 40 minutes of Elliot Goldenthal's Original Motion Picture Score, was released two weeks after the soundtrack album.
In 1996, "Kiss from a Rose" won three Grammy Awards for best male pop vocal performance, record of the year and song of the year.
