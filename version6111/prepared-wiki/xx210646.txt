==Annual Pony Swim==

On the last Wednesday in July, the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department conducts the annual Wild Pony Swim as part of Pony Penning.  Salt Water Cowboys round up wild Chincoteague Ponies from Assateague Island and drive them across the Assateague Channel to Veteranâ€™s Memorial Park on Chincoteague Island.Chincoteague Beachcomber.

Once on Chincoteague Island, the Salt Water Cowboys heard the ponies to pens on the Chincoteague Carnival Grounds where some of the foals are auctioned off the next day.Gooldrup, Harley.
