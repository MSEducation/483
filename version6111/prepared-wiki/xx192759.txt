==Background==

Ocean State Policy Research Institute was founded on July 4, 2007 by William J. Felkner, who is chiefly known as an advocate for libertarian principles in education and social services. As Rhode Island’s first and only free market think tank, it had emerged as a resource for the state, national, and international political community [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl]. Felkner was replaced as Executive Director by Mike Stenhouse in the spring of 2011, and OSPRI itself was dissolved in late July 2011[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl].

==Projects==

The Rhode Island Center Right Coalition meeting, a collection of conservative and libertarian groups was coordinated through OSPRI.
The organization had been a strong advocate for “work first” based reforms to the Rhode Island welfare system. Their research on education issues has supported change to “school choice” and the opportunity for parents to have more say in affecting their children’s education.
OSPRI promoted an immigration policy that does not constrict the economy or increase costs of social services. They supported a guest worker program but suggested that guest workers should not be eligible for taxpayer funded welfare programs.
Ocean State Policy was a leader in the call for governmental transparency. They have “tackled the confusion of education union contracts by developing spreadsheets that outline the multitude of compensation methods often hidden from the public” [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl] and were developing an interactive website listing all state and local contracts and expenditures. They had begun a network of local blogs to promote transparency in each city and town in Rhode Island.
