Richard Morgan (born 1965 and known as Richard K. Morgan in the USA) is an English science fiction and fantasy author.
Born in London, and brought up in the village of Hethersett, near Norwich, Morgan studied history at Queens' College, Cambridge. After graduating he started teaching English in order to travel the world. After 14 years and a post at the University of Strathclyde, his first novel was published and he became a full-time writer.
Morgan's books are generally set in a dystopian world.  Morgan described his "takeaway" of one of his books as  Society is, always has been and always will be a structure for the exploitation and oppression of the majority through systems of political force dictated by an élite, enforced by thugs, uniformed or not, and upheld by a wilful ignorance and stupidity on the part of the very majority whom the system oppresses.Morgan discussing his "take away" of his novel Altered Carbon, in  "Never Mind the Cyberpunks: An Interview with Richard Morgan", SaxonBullock.com.  Originally published online at SlateMagazine.co.uk, 2002. 

==Literary career==

In 2002 Morgan's first novel Altered Carbon was published, combining elements of cyberpunk and hardboiled detective fiction and featuring the antihero Takeshi Kovacs. The film rights for the book sold for a reported figure of $1,000,000 to film producer Joel Silver, enabling Morgan to become a full-time writer. In 2003 the U.S. edition received the Philip K. Dick Award.
In 2003 Broken Angels was published, the sequel to Altered Carbon, again featuring Takeshi Kovacs and blending science fiction and war fiction in a similar way to his cross-genre début.
Market Forces, Morgan's first non-Kovacs novel, is set in the not-too-distant future. It was originally written as a short story, then as a screenplay (both unpublished). After the success of his first two works, it was released as a novel and has also been optioned as a film.
Morgan's third, and he has stated final,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1899.html |title=Interview with Richard Morgan |date=16 August 2005 |work=IT Conversations [/tpl] Kovacs novel Woken Furies was released in the UK in March 2005 and in the U.S. in September 2005.
Morgan wrote two six issue miniseries for Marvel Comics under the Marvel Knights imprint. His first story, Black Widow: Homecoming published monthly in 2004 was followed by a second, Black Widow: The Things They Say About Her published monthly in 2005; both are now available in collected editions. According to Morgan's official website the series was "an artefact of limited appeal" and is unlikely to be continued, although he has other comic projects in development.
Black Man was released in May 2007 in the UK and (as Thirteen or Th1rte3n) June 2007 in the USA. According to the author, the book is about the constraints of physicality and the fact that you are locked into who you are and there's not a whole lot you can do about that.  These are things he could not deal with in the Kovacs universe, because for Kovacs and people like him mortality is avoidable: you just skip into a new body.[tpl]cite web |author=Moira Gunn |title=Tech Nation |url=http://www.yourmomsbasement.com/archives/2005/08/interview_with_2.html |publisher=Your Mom's Basement [/tpl] The novel subsequently won the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award.
