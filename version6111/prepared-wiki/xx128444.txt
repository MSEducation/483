The Template Numerical Toolkit (or TNT) is a software library for manipulating vectors and matrices in C++ created by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.  
TNT provides the fundamental linear algebra operations (for example, matrix multiplication).  TNT is analogous to the BLAS library used by LAPACK.  Higher level algorithms, such as LU decomposition and singular value decomposition, are provided by JAMA, also developed at NIST, which uses TNT.
The major features of TNT are:
TNT is mature and NIST classifies its development status as active maintenance.
The principal designer of TNT is Roldan Pozo.
