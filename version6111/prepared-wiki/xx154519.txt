Jessica (also Jesica, Jessicah or Jessikahttp://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/0/Jesica) is a female given name.
The oldest written record of the name with its current spelling is found as the name of a character in Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice, where it belongs to the daughter of Shylock. The name may have been an Anglicisation of the Biblical Iskah  (from the Hebrew: יִסְכָּה : yiskāh), the name of a daughter of Haran briefly mentioned in the Book of Genesis in the Bible. Iskah was rendered "Jeska" in English Bibles available in Shakespeare's day.Hanks, P. & Hodges, F. A Dictionary of First Names. (1990). Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-211651-7.
The original Hebrew name Yiskāh (יִסְכָּה), means "foresight", or being able to see the potential in the future. The Hebrew root sakhah (ס.כ.ה) means "to see," so the name Yiskah, with the added future-tense yod, implies foresight or clairvoyance.  Yiskah is the niece of Abraham.

==Usage in Ireland and Scotland==

It is important to note that in Celtic usage, Jessie is not related to Jessica. It is considered a pet form of the name Jane or Jean (feminisations of John). This is further expressed in Gaelic variants as the names Seana/Seóna (Shawna) or Sìne (Sheena). Related feminine names taken from John are Jane/Joan (Sìne), Janie (Sìneag), and Janet/Janice (Seònaid); all are considered equated, though spelling may change slightly dependent upon the form of Gaelic (Irish or Scottish).
An additional nickname for Jessie, heard in Scotland, is Jinty (or Jinny). This may or may not be the case in Ireland or Northern Ireland. It hints at the connection there to Jean (female given name)/Jane/Jennie.
Also of note is that Jessie serves as an Anglicisation of the Gaelic word meaning "to stand".http://corkirish.wordpress.com/verb-conjugation/seasaim/ In Irish Gaelige this is Seasaídh (pro. "Shey-see", emphasis on first syllable); the Scots Gàidhlig variant is Teasaidh/Teasag, (pro. "Cheh-say").List of Scottish Gaelic given names#H1
