The I SS Panzer Corps ''Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler or 'I SS Panzer Corps''' ([tpl]lang-de|I.SS-Panzerkorps[/tpl]) was a German Waffen-SS panzer corps which saw action on both the Western and Eastern Fronts during World War II.

==Formation and training==

The corps was raised on 26 July 1943 in Berlin-Lichterfeld, with initial mustering taking place on the Truppenübungsplatz at Beverloo, in occupied Belgium.Reynolds 2007, p. 16. The formation resulted in SS-Obergruppenführer Paul Hausser's existing (unnumbered) SS Panzer Corps being renamed to II SS Panzer Corps. SS-Obergruppenführer Josef "Sepp" Dietrich, previously in charge of the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, was the corps' first commander. The Leibstandarte division's symbol was a skeleton key, in honour of Dietrich (Dietrich is German for skeleton key or lock pick), and it was retained and modified to serve as the Corps' symbol.
In August 1943, the corps was transferred to Meran in Italy, where it took part in operations to disarm Italian troops. After the completion of this, the Corps continued its training, being sporadically engaged in anti-partisan operations in northern Italy. By December 1943, the Corps was fully formed and deemed ready for action, and its HQ was set up in Brussels.

==Operational history==

===Western Front: Normandy===

In April 1944, the corps was moved to Septeuil, to the west of Paris, where it was assigned the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend, Panzer-Lehr-Division and the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen. The corps was to form a part of General Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg's Panzer Group West, the Western theatre's armoured reserve. During this time, the corps was granted the honorary title Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler.
With the launch of Operation Overlord and the allied invasion of France on 6 June 1944, the corps was ordered to Falaise. The Hitlerjugend engaged British and Canadian troops to the north of Caen on 8 June. The corps was tasked with holding the area of Caen and saw heavy fighting around the villages of Authie, Buron and the airport at Carpiquet. The Tigers of the corps' 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion distinguished themselves during the fighting defeating a British armoured breakthrough near the village of Villers-Bocage.
The corps played a major role in the halting of the British Epsom and Goodwood operations, and the 17th SS Panzergrenadier and Panzer Lehr Divisions bitterly contested the American advance in the bocage country near Saint-Lô.
After the launch of the American Operation Cobra, which decimated the Panzer Lehr, the Corps was ordered to take part in Operation Lüttich, the abortive counter-offensive towards Avranches. The remnants of the Corps were caught in the Falaise Pocket, where they fought hard to keep open an escape corridor for the trapped German forces, losing virtually all their armour and materiel in the process. After the fall of the Falaise pocket and the collapse of the front, the Corps took part in the fighting withdrawal to the Franco-German border.

===Battle of the Bulge===

In early October 1944, the Corps was pulled back from the front line for rest and refit in Westfalen. Refitting was complete by early December, and it was ordered to the Ardennes region to join its old commander, Sepp Dietrich's Sixth SS Panzer Army, in preparation for a major offensive codenamed Wacht Am Rhein, and the ensuing Battle of the Bulge.
The Corps played a major role in the battle with Kampfgruppe Peiper of the Leibstandarte division forming the spearhead. After several weeks heavy fighting, and with severely limited fuel supplies, the Corps was exhausted. The offensive was called off, and the Corps, together with the whole of Dietrich's Army, was moved to Hungary.

===Eastern Front: Hungary===

The German forces began Operation Frühlingserwachen on 6 March 1945. The Corps, which formed the left flank of Dietrich's assault, was soon bogged down by mud and, despite initial gains, the attack was soon halted by intense Soviet opposition. The Corps fell back in an attempt to support the IV SS Panzer Corps, which was to their left and engaged in heavy action near Stuhlweissenberg. On 15 March, the Soviets launched the Vienna offensive, which split the lines of the neighbouring German Sixth Army and forced the entire southern front to retreat towards Vienna. The Corps engaged in scattered resistance, retreating through Hungary and Austria, finally surrendering to the Americans on 8 May 1945.
