[[Eilean Mòr]]

Eilean Mòr, literally meaning "large island" in Scottish Gaelic is the name of several Scottish islands. In some areas, the term merely refers to the large island of a group, and may be used in place of the actual name:

==Saltwater==

==Freshwater==

Alternatively, you may be looking for Eilean Dubh Mòr in the Firth of Lorn or Eilean Ruairidh Mòr in Loch Maree.
