[[Alex Awards]]

CATEGORIES: American literary awards, Awards established in 1998, American children's literary awards, Young adult literature awards, American Library Association awards

The Alex Awards are also a separate award given for excellence in entertainment packaging.

The Alex Awards annually recognize "ten books written for adults that have special appeal to young adults, ages 12 through 18". Essentially the award is a listing by the American Library Association parallel to its annual Best Books for Young Adults, a longer list of recommended books that have been promoted in the YA category. YALSA also names several other "Top Tens" annually.
The awards, named after the dedicated Baltimore librarian, Margaret Alexander Edwards, who was known as "Alex", are sponsored by the Margaret Alexander Edwards Trust and Booklist magazine.[tpl]cite journal | last = Carter | first = Betty  | title = Who Is Margaret Edwards and What Is This Award Being Given In Her Honor?  | journal = The ALAN Review | issue = Spring 1992 | pages = 45â€“48  | url = http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/yalsa/booklistsawards/margaretaedwards/whowasedwards/whomargaretedwards.cfm  | accessdate = 2009-03-05[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl] The list of books published during the previous year serves to provide the choice of titles selected for the awards which were initially bestowed in 1998 and, since 2002, have been administered by the Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) a division of the American Library Association (ALA).  Only one author, Neil Gaiman, has made the list twice.
