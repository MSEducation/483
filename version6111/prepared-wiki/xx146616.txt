==Criticism==

DiStaso was accused of Republican bias in one Columbia Journalism Review article. The criticism came from a long interview with George W. Bush presidential adviser Karl Rove.  Zachary Roth (currently an MSNBC Digital reporter) wrote this:
 "As Rove no doubt expected, DiStaso -- who was singled out by Campaign Desk back in January for distorting a quote by Democratic candidate Wesley Clark during a televised debate -- dutifully transcribed Rove's words and presented them as a full news story, under the title, 'Presidential Adviser Defends Decision to Liberate Iraq.'"http://www.cjrdaily.org/politics/our_roving_reporter.php
