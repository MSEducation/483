==Construction==

A golden rectangle can be constructed with only straightedge and compass by 4 simple steps:

==Relation to regular polygons and polyhedra==

A distinctive feature of this shape is that when a square section is removed, the remainder is another golden rectangle; that is, with the same aspect ratio as the first.  Square removal can be repeated infinitely, in which case corresponding corners of the squares form an infinite sequence of points on the golden spiral, the unique logarithmic spiral with this property.
An alternative construction of the golden rectangle uses three polygons circumscribed by congruent circles: a regular decagon, hexagon, and pentagon. The respective lengths a, b, and c of the sides of these three polygons satisfy the equation a2 + b2 = c2, so line segments with these lengths form a right triangle. The ratio of the side length of the hexagon to the decagon is the golden ratio, so this triangle forms half of a golden rectangle.Euclid, Book XIII, Proposition 10.
The convex hull of two opposite edges of a regular icosahedron forms a golden rectangle. The twelve vertices of the icosahedron can be decomposed in this way into three mutually-perpendicular golden rectangles, whose boundaries are linked in the pattern of the Borromean rings.[tpl]Cite book|title=The Heart of Mathematics: An Invitation to Effective Thinking|first1=Edward B.|last1=Burger|first2=Michael P.|last2=Starbird|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=9781931914413|page=382|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M-qK8anbZmwC&pg=PA382|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl].

==Applications==

According to astrophysicist and mathematics popularizer Mario Livio, since the publication of Luca Pacioli's Divina Proportione in 1509,Pacioli, Luca.  De divina proportione, Luca Paganinem de Paganinus de Brescia (Antonio Capella) 1509, Venice. when "with Pacioli's book, the Golden Ratio started to become available to artists in theoretical treatises that were not overly mathematical, that they could actually use,"[tpl]cite book|last=Livio|first=Mario|year=2002|title=The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, The World's Most Astonishing Number|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=0-7679-0815-5[/tpl] many artists and architects have been fascinated by the presumption that the golden rectangle is considered aesthetically pleasing. The proportions of the golden rectangle have been observed in works predating Pacioli's publication.Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis with a Philosophical Polemic, Communication Quarterly, Vol. 46, 1998 ("a 'Golden Rectangle' has a ratio of the length of its sides equal to 1:1.61803+. The Parthenon is of these dimensions.")
