[[Comet Hale–Bopp]]

CATEGORIES: Heaven's Gate, Comets, 1997 in science, Non-periodic comets

Comet Hale–Bopp (formally designated C/1995 O1) was perhaps the most widely observed comet of the 20th century and one of the brightest seen for many decades. It was visible to the naked eye for a record 18 months, twice as long as the previous record holder, the Great Comet of 1811.
Hale–Bopp was discovered on July 23, 1995, at a great distance from the Sun, raising expectations that the comet would brighten considerably by the time it passed close to Earth. Although predicting the brightness of comets with any degree of accuracy is very difficult, Hale–Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997. The comet was dubbed the Great Comet of 1997.

==Discovery==

The comet was discovered independently on July 23, 1995 by two observers, Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp, both in the United States.[tpl]cite journal |title = The comets of 1995 | last = Shanklin |first = Jonathan D. | journal = Journal of the British Astronomical Association | year= 2000 | volume =110 |issue = 6 |pages= 311 |bibcode = 2000JBAA..110..311S[/tpl]
Hale had spent many hundreds of hours searching for comets without success, and was tracking known comets from his driveway in New Mexico when he chanced upon Hale–Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an apparent magnitude of 10.5 and lay near the globular cluster M70 in the constellation of Sagittarius. Hale first established that there was no other deep-sky object near M70, and then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky. Once he had established that the object was moving relative to the background stars, he emailed the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.[tpl]cite news|title=Comet of the decade Part II| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986055,00.html | work = Time | date=March 17, 1997 | first = Michael D. | last = Lemonick | accessdate=2008-10-30[/tpl]
Bopp did not own a telescope. He was out with friends near Stanfield, Arizona observing star clusters and galaxies when he chanced across the comet while at the eyepiece of his friend's telescope. He realized he might have spotted something new when, like Hale, he checked his star maps to determine if any other deep-sky objects were known to be near M70, and found that there were none. He alerted the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams through a Western Union telegram. Brian G. Marsden, who had run the bureau since 1968, laughed, "Nobody sends telegrams anymore. I mean, by the time that telegram got here, Alan Hale had already e-mailed us three times with updated coordinates."[tpl]cite web | url = http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/space/solar-system/comets-age.html | title = The Age of Comets | first = William  |date=December 1997 | last = Newcott | work = National Geographic Society | accessdate = 7 December 2009 | quote = "Nobody sends telegrams anymore..."[/tpl]
The following morning, it was confirmed that this was a new comet, and it was given the designation C/1995 O1. The discovery was announced in International Astronomical Union circular 6187.[tpl]cite web|last=Hale|first=A.|coauthors= Bopp, T.; Stevens, J.|title=IAU Circular No. 6187|publisher=IAU |date=July 23, 1995|url=http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/iauc/06100/06187.html#Item1|accessdate=2011-07-05[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | title = Amateur Contributions in the study of Comet Hale–Bopp | journal = Earth, Moon, and Planets | volume =79 | issue = 1–3 | year = 1997 | pages = 307–308 | first =Thomas | last =Bopp | doi = 10.1023/A:1006262006364|bibcode = 1997EM&P...79..307B [/tpl]
The comet may have been observed by ancient Egyptians during the reign of pharaoh Pepi I (2332–2283 BC). In Pepi's pyramid in Saqqara is a text referring to an "nhh-star" as a companion of the pharaoh in the heavens, where "nhh" is the hieroglyph for long hair."The Lost Tomb", Kent Weeks, ISBN 0-297-81847-3, page 198

==Early observation==

Hale–Bopp's orbital position was calculated as 7.2 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, placing it between Jupiter and Saturn and by far the greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs.[tpl]cite journal|title=Comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) | url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/mpec/J95/J95P01.html | last=Marsden | first= B.

An image taken at the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed comet some 13 AU from the Sun,[tpl]cite web|last = McNaught| first = R. H. | coauthors = West, R.

(Halley's Comet was more than 100 times fainter at the same distance from the Sun.)[tpl]cite journal | last=Biver | first=N. | title = Substantial outgassing of CO from Comet Hale–Bopp at large heliocentric distance | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v380/n6570/abs/380137a0.html | journal = Nature | volume=380 | pages = 137–139 | year=1996 | doi=10.1038/380137a0 | pmid=8600385 | issue=6570 | last2=Rauer | first2=H | last3=Despois | first3=D | last4=Moreno | first4=R | last5=Paubert | first5=G | last6=Bockelée-Morvan | first6=D | last7=Colom | first7=P | last8=Crovisier | first8=J | last9=Gérard | first9=E| last10=Jorda | first10=Laurent |bibcode = 1996Natur.380..137B | display-authors=8 [/tpl] Analysis indicated later that its comet nucleus was 60±20 kilometres in diameter, approximately six times the size of Halley.
Its great distance and surprising activity indicated that comet Hale–Bopp might become very bright indeed when it reached perihelion in 1997. However, comet scientists were wary – comets can be extremely unpredictable, and many have large outbursts at great distance only to diminish in brightness later. Comet Kohoutek in 1973 had been touted as a 'comet of the century' and turned out to be unspectacular.

==Perihelion==

Hale–Bopp became visible to the naked eye in May 1996, and although its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.[tpl]cite news|title = Comet Holds Clues to Birth of Time | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E6DF1639F93AA35750C0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 | last = Browne | first = Malcolm R. | date = March 9, 1997 | work = The New York Times[/tpl]
The Internet was a growing phenomenon at the time, and numerous websites that tracked the comet's progress and provided daily images from around the world became extremely popular. The Internet played a large role in encouraging the unprecedented public interest in comet Hale–Bopp.[tpl]cite web| title= The Trail of Hale-Bopp | url= http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-trail-of-hale-bopp | work= Scientific American | date= 1997-03-17 | accessdate =2008-10-23[/tpl]
As the comet approached the Sun, it continued to brighten, shining at 2nd magnitude in February, and showing a growing pair of tails, the blue gas tail pointing straight away from the Sun and the yellowish dust tail curving away along its orbit. On March 9, a solar eclipse in China, Mongolia and eastern Siberia allowed observers there to see the comet in the daytime.[tpl]cite journal |title = The total solar eclipse of 1997 March 9 | last = McGee | first= H.

As it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997 the comet developed into a spectacular sight. It shone brighter than any star in the sky except Sirius, and its dust tail stretched 40–45 degrees across the sky.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.eso.org/public/events/astro-evt/hale-bopp/comet-hale-bopp-summary-apr13-97-rw.html | title = Comet Hale-Bopp (April 13, 1997) | accessdate=2008-11-23 | last = West | first = Richard M. | authorlink = Richard Martin West | date = April 13, 1997 | publisher=European Southern Observatory[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | first=B.

==After perihelion==

After its perihelion passage, the comet moved into the southern celestial hemisphere. The comet was much less impressive to southern hemisphere observers than it had been in the northern hemisphere, but southerners were able to see the comet gradually fade from view during the second half of 1997. The last naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that the comet had remained visible without aid for 569 days, or about 18 and a half months.[tpl]cite journal | last = Kidger| first = M.R. | year=2004 | journal = Earth, Moon, and Planets | volume = 78 | issue=1–3 | pages = 169–177 | title = The Visual Light Curve Of C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) From Discovery To Late 1997 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/h72381014307x661/ | doi=10.1023/A:1006228113533 | last2 = Hurst | first2 = G. | last3 = James | first3 = N.|bibcode = 1997EM&P...78..169K [/tpl] The previous record had been set by the Great Comet of 1811, which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.
The comet continued to fade as it receded, but is still being tracked by astronomers. In October 2007, 10 years after the perihelion and at distance of 25.7 AU from Sun, the comet was still active as indicated by the detection of the CO-driven coma.[tpl]cite journal|last=Szabó |first= Gy.
