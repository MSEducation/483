Jesup Wakeman Scott High School is a public high school located in the Old West End neighborhood of Toledo, Ohio.  It is part of Toledo Public Schools.  It was named for a former editor of The Toledo Blade from 1844 to 1847. Scott was an entrepreneur, philanthropist and well-known civic leader who envisioned Toledo as the "Future Great City of the World."  The current high school building was built in 1913.[tpl]cite web | last = | first = | title = Monetta To Teach Scott Hi Athletes| publisher = Toledo News-Bee | date = September 2, 1913 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Jd9XAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2EQNAAAAIBAJ&dq=scott%20high%20toledo&pg=5302%2C4665086| accessdate = February 9, 2011[/tpl]
After receiving a $1 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Scott High School began a transformation from a comprehensive high school to four small learning academies.  Each academy, or "Small School" is based on a different career pathway.
The Scott Bulldogs wear maroon and white for athletic events. Their basketball program has been historically known as a powerhouse in the Toledo City League with their biggest rivals being the Macomber Macmen and the Libbey Cowboys.  Macomber was the big rivalry until that school's closure in 1991, and Libbey was the main rival until it was closed in 2010.  Scott's oldest rivals are the Waite Indians, as their school was built a year after Scott and prompted an annual Thanksgiving Day football matchup that ran from 1914-1963 and generated the interest of many Midwestern newspapers.[tpl]cite web | last = Hackenberg| first = Dave| title = Scott-Waite game kicked off great tradition of high school feasts| publisher = Toledo Blade | date = November 27, 2003 | url = http://www.toledoblade.com/article/20031127/COLUMNIST08/111270131| accessdate = February 7, 2011[/tpl]  Scott is also known for its internationally known marching band the "Fantastic Dancing Machines," having one of the premier marching bands in the mid-west, who have won numerous awards in band competitions throughout the United States. The band has performed all over the country. The band was directed by Florida A&M University alum Gus Walker from 1970-1977, then rose to fame under the baton of Mr. Edward Dixon beginning in 1978.
The actual school building on Collingwood Avenue was temporarily closed for a $42 million renovation that took place. It was finished in December 2011. Prior to that, the students, staff and faculty spent 2.5 school years at the closed DeVilbiss High School.[tpl]cite web | last = Kushma| first = David| title = Bulldog Nation at 100: Scott's past, present converge| publisher = Toledo Blade | date = October 20, 2013 | url = http://www.toledoblade.com/DavidKushma/2013/10/20/Bulldog-Nation-at-100-Scott-s-past-present-converge.html| accessdate = February 14, 2014[/tpl]
