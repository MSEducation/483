The Medical Practitioners' Union is a section of Unite the Union, a trade union in the United Kingdom.
The union was founded as the Medico-Political Union in 1914 and was renamed the Medical Practitioners' Union in 1922.  It amalgamated with the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs in 1970 under the leadership of Hugh Faulkner.  It remained a distinct section through a series of mergers which formed Manufacturing, Science and Finance, Amicus and ultimately Unite.Records of the Medical Practitioners' Union, University of Warwick Modern Records Centre
The union published Medical World.  This originated in 1913 as the official journal of the State
Medical Service Association, but was adopted as the official union journal the following year.  The union opposed the British Medical Association.  It aimed to extend the provision of medical care by the state, while retaining the independence of general practitioners.Roger Cooter, The Rise and Decline of the Medical Member: Doctors and Parliament in Edwardian and Interwar Britain
