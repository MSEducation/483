==History==

The Aristotle University of Thessaloniki was founded in 1925 during the premiership of Alexandros Papanastassiou and was legislated under Law 3341/14-6-25. It was the second Greek university to be founded after the University of Athens, which was established in 1837. The university was built on top of the remains of what had once been the Jewish cemetery in Thessaloniki, until the cemetery's tragic destruction during the Nazi occupation.
According to Eleftherios Venizelos' plans following the end of the World War I, Smyrni was intended to be the seat of the second Greek university, while the third university was to be established in Thessaloniki. However, Smyrni was not part of Greece at the time and the plans fell through after the outcome of the Greco-Turkish War in Asia Minor. Nevertheless, in 1924, Alexandros Papanastassiou decided to found a university in Thessaloniki in order to boost the local economy and culture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.auth.gr/univ/city/history/index_el.html |title=History of the Aristotle University |language=[tpl]el icon[/tpl] |publisher=Auth.gr |date=2003-08-28 |accessdate=2013-09-13[/tpl]
The chronological development of the university, which was renamed the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 1954, can be divided into three stages, each covering a period of approximately 25 years.

===First stage (1926–1950)===

During the first stage of its operation (1926–1950), the development focused on those Schools which were generally accepted as constituting one educational Institute, namely the Faculty of Philosophy, the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics, the Faculty of Law and Economics, the School of Theology and the Medical School. The first stage of development ended with the foundation of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1950, which was the only faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Greece for many years. After this period, some of the aforementioned faculties were extended by integrating more departments. In more detail, the Departments of Pharmacy and Dentistry were founded in 1955 and 1959 respectively and they were incorporated into the Medical School. Moreover, the Faculty of Philosophy was expanded by integrating the Institutes of Foreign Languages (English, French, German and Italian).

===Second stage (1951–1975)===

During the second stage (1951–1975) the focal point of development was the Faculty of Engineering, also known as the Polytechnic Faculty. At the beginning, this faculty constituted an independent institute also called the Polytechnic or Technical University.History of the Faculty of Engineering[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] Therefore, for the first fifty years of its operation the Aristotle University consisted of two distinct institutes which operated independently. Subsequently these two educational institutes where unified. The various Schools within the Faculty of Engineering were founded in the following order: School of Civil Engineering (1955–56), School of Architecture (1956–57), School of Rural and Surveying Engineering (1962–63), School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (1972–73), School of Chemical Engineering (1972–73), School of Mathematics, Physics and Computational Sciences (1982–83) and School of Urban-Regional Planning and Development Engineering (2004). The School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering was split in two independent schools (School of Mechanical Engineering and School of Electrical and Computer Engineering) in 1976.

===Third stage (1975–present)===

Finally, during the third stage of its development (1975-today), new schools and departments were founded along with the aforementioned Engineering Schools. Moreover, the university acquired a small number of departments which operated in the past as independent institutes of Higher Education. During this period, the Faculty of Fine Arts was established, along with all its constituent Schools (Drama, Film Studies, Music Studies, Visual and Applied Arts). Additionally, the School of Journalism and Mass Media Studies and the School of Physical Education and Sports Sciences were created as independent schools. Overall, the third stage of development of the Aristotle University is characterized not only by the establishment of new Faculties, Schools and Departments, but also by many major changes in the structure of the university itself. These changes include the downgrade of some former Faculties into Schools or Departments and the upgrade of others.
Today, the Aristotle University comprises 12 Faculties, 36 schools, and numerous other units (such as laboratories, study rooms, libraries, clinics, research centres etc.), which make it the largest university in Greece and southeastern Europe in terms of number of staff, undergraduate and postgraduate students and the facilities offered.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.auth.gr/home/ |title=Message by the Rector |language=[tpl]el icon[/tpl] |publisher=Auth.gr |date=2013-08-14 |accessdate=2013-09-13[/tpl]

===Academic Evaluation===

An external evaluation of all academic departments in Greek universities will be conducted by the Hellenic Quality Assurance and Accreditation Agency (HQAA) in the following years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adip.gr/index.php?lang=en |title=Hellenic Quality Assurance and Accreditation Agency |publisher=Adip.gr |date= |accessdate=2013-09-13[/tpl]

==Organization and administration==

The Aristotle University is one of Greece's public Universities and therefore it is a legal entity with full self governance. It is primarily state-funded and functions under the supervision of the Greek Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs. Other financial resources for the university are donations from individuals, participation in various EU research programmes and profits generated through management of the university assets. It is important to note that no fees are charged to the students of the university.
The administration of the university consists of collective bodies who take decisions within the framework of the Greek laws. Main objective of the administration's efforts is to ensure the proper function of the university and pursuit the benefit of the academic community as a whole.

===Hierarchy===

In Greece every university (Higher Education Institution) implements the hierarchy shown in the image.
Every Greek public university comprises the faculties and the faculties comprise the schools. A school covers a basic scientific area and thus is considered to be the basic academic unit. Every school is subdivided into departments, which are responsible for the teaching of a specific part of the school's scientific area. Moreover, departments have substantial autonomy in educational matters and therefore they are mainly responsible for planning and implementing educational programs and granting degrees. Finally, clinics, reading rooms and laboratories are smaller units that belong to a department.

===Administrative authorities===

====University Senate====

The highest administrative authority is the University Senate. It consists of the following members (senators):

====Rector's Council====

The second highest administrative authority is the Rector's Council, which comprises the rector, the three vice-rectors, one student representative and one representative of the administration staff. Each member of the Rector's Council is elected every 3 years.

====Rector====

The Rector is the president of the University Senate and the main representative of the University in various national and international bodies. Moreover, he/she is responsible for developing an overall strategy for the development of the university and for implementing the decisions taken by the Senate and the Rector's Council. Both the Rector and the three Vice-rectors are elected every three years in university-wide elections where all faculty, staff and student representatives vote. Each Vice-rector has different administrative responsibilities, among which are: staff management, financial planning and development, academic affairs.

====Faculty, School and Department administrative bodies====

Every faculty, school and department has its own administrative body, the members of which are democratically elected on the basis of collective processes.Administrative Bodies In more detail, decisions on academic, financial and administrative matters within a single department are made by the department's General Assembly, which consists of faculty members and student representatives. The decision making process often involves the creation of ad hoc committees.

==Staff==

The university staff is divided into five main categories:
The educational work is also exercised by people that do not belong to the university staff, such as guest professors and generally scientists who are invited to teach specific courses.

==University units==

The campus of the Aristotle University covers 230,000 square metres and is located near the centre of the city of Thessaloniki. The majority of the university units is found inside the campus, but there are also various institutions, laboratories, and facilities of the university which are located outside the campus such as the Centre of Byzantine Researches, veterinary clinics, the university farm, and forest reserves).The Student handbook[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] The following are some of the most important university units of the Aristotle University:
