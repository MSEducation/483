CATEGORIES: Tourism in Japan

Tourism in Japan attracted 8.3 million foreign visitors in 2008, slightly more than Singapore and Ireland. Japan has 16 World Heritage Sites, including Himeji Castle and Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto. Kyoto receives over 30 million tourists annually.Scott, David (1996). Exploring Japan. Fodor's Travel Publications, Inc. ISBN 0-679-03011-5. Foreigners also visit Tokyo and Nara, Mount Fuji, ski resorts such as Niseko in Hokkaido, Okinawa, ride the shinkansen and take advantage of Japan's hotel and hotspring network.

==History of Tourism==

The origins of early traditions of visits to picturesque sites are unclear, but early sight-seeing excursions was Matsuo Basho's 1689 trip to the then "far north" of Japan, which occurred not long after Hayashi Razan categorized the Three Views of Japan in 1643.  During the feudal era of Japan, from around 1600 to the Meiji Restoration in 1867, travel was regulated within the country through the use of shukuba or post stations, towns in which travelers had to present appropriate documentation.  Despite these restrictions, porter stations and horse stables, as well as places for lodging and food were available on well-traveled routes.  During this time, Japan was a closed country to foreigners, so no foreign tourism existed in Japan. Following the Meiji Restoration and the building of a national railroad network across Japan, tourism became more of an affordable prospect for domestic citizens and visitors from foreign countries could enter Japan legally.  As early as 1887, government officials recognized the need for an organized system of attracting foreign tourists; the [tpl]nihongo|Kihinkai|貴賓会[/tpl], which aimed to coordinate the various players in  tourism, was established that year with Prime Minister Ito Hirobumi's blessing. Its early leaders included Shibusawa Eiichi and Ekida Takashi. Another major milestone in the development of the tourism industry in Japan was the 1907 passage of the Hotel Development Law, as a result of which the Railways Ministry began to construct publicly owned hotels all throughout Japan.[tpl]cite book|title=The Rules of Play: National Identity and the Shaping of Japanese Leisure|page=59|publisher=Cornell University Press|first=David Richard|last=Leheny|isbn=0-8014-4091-2[/tpl]

==Tourism Today==

Domestic tourism remains a vital part of the Japanese economy and Japanese culture.  School children in many middle schools see the highlight of their years as a visit to Tokyo Disneyland or perhaps Tokyo Tower and many  high school students often visit Okinawa or Hokkaido. The extensive rail network together with domestic flights sometimes in planes with modifications to favor the relatively short distances involved in intra-Japan travel allows efficient and speedy transport.
In inbound tourism, Japan was ranked 28th in the world in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tourismroi.com/Content_Attachments/27670/File_633513750035785076.pdf |title=UNTWO World Tourism Barometer, Vol.5 No.2 |accessdate=2008-03-26 |last=UNTWO |date=June 2008 |format=PDF [/tpl]

===Tourism after the Fukushima disaster===

After the triple melt-down of the nuclear reactors in Fukushima, the number of foreign visitors declined for months in a row. To boost tourism the Japanese Tourism Agency announced in October 2011 a plan to give 10,000 round-trip air tickets to Japan away in order to encourage visitors to come to Japan. In 2012 free tickets would be offered on condition that the winners would write online about their experiences in Japan. They also would need to answer some questions, about how they felt while visiting Japan after the earthquake, and how the interest in tourism in Japan could be renewed. In September 2011 some 539,000 foreign people visited Japan, this was 25 percent down compared with the same month in 2010. This decline was largely attributed to the Fukushima nuclear accident, but also the stronger yen made a visit to Japan more expensive. About 15 million dollars would be spent on this program.NHK-world (21 October 2011) Japan to give away air tickets to 10,000 visitorsJAIF (22 October 2011)Earthquake report 242: Japan to give away air tickets to 10,000 visitors
