In March 2010, the Ayush Department of the Union Health Ministry decided to bifurcate CCRAS to create an exclusive body for Siddha research called the Central Council of Research in Siddha (CCRS), after a long period of pressure from the Siddha community in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere. The new council was decided to be headquartered in Chennai, and the council was officially formed in September 2010.[ref]
