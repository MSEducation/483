CATEGORIES: Jötnar

In Norse mythology, Suttungr ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ʊ|t|ʊ|ŋ|ər[/tpl] [tpl]respell|SUUT|uung-ər[/tpl]) was a jötunn, a son of Gilling, who (along with Suttungr's mother) had been murdered by Fjalar and Galar.

==Mythology==

Suttungr searched for his parents and threatened the dwarven brothers Fjalar and Galar, tying them and some other dwarves who killed Gilling to a rock that would be submerged by the rising tide. The dwarves begged for Suttungr to spare their life and offered him the magical mead of poetry. Suttungr took it and hid it in the center of a mountain, with his daughter Gunnlöð, standing guard whom he turned into a witch in order to guard it.Hávamál, Poetic Edda
Odin eventually decided to obtain the mead. He worked for Baugi, Suttungr's brother, a farmer, for an entire summer, then asked for a small sip of the mead, which Suttungr refused. Baugi drilled into the mountain and Odin changed into a snake and slithered inside. Inside, Gunnlod was on guard but he persuaded her to give him three sips in exchange for three nights of sex.Prose Edda Odin proceeded to drink all the mead in the three containers, changed into an eagle and escaped. Suttungr chased him in the shape of an eagle, but Odin was able to escape him and returned to Asgard.Suttung
