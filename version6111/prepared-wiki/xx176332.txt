In an interview with Robert D. Wilson of the E-journal Simply Haiku, Krawiec said: "Many of my friends lived in the projects. So I grew up hanging around with people who were primarily excluded... I found myself telling the stories of those who were ‘voiceless’."INTERVIEW: Richard Krawiec by Robert Wilson in Simply Haiku v2n6, 2004
