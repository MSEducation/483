[[Grey matter]]

CATEGORIES: Neuroanatomy, Central nervous system

Grey matter (or gray matter) (lat. Substantia grisea) is a major component of the central nervous system, consisting of neuronal cell bodies, neuropil (dendrites and myelinated as well as unmyelinated axons), glial cells (astroglia and oligodendrocytes) and capillaries. Grey matter is distinguished from white matter, in that grey matter contains numerous cell bodies and relatively few myelinated axons, while white matter is composed chiefly of long-range myelinated axon tracts and contains relatively very few cell bodies.[tpl]cite book | author = Purves, Dale, George J.

In living tissue, grey matter actually has a very light grey color with yellowish or pinkish hues, which come from capillary blood vessels and neuronal cell bodies.Kolb & Whishaw: Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology (2003) page 49

==Function==

Grey matter contains most of the brain's neuronal cell bodies. The grey matter includes regions of the brain involved in muscle control,and sensory perception such as seeing and hearing, memory, emotions, speech, decision making, and self-control. While 20% of all oxygen taken in by the body goes to the brain, 95% of that goes specifically into the grey matter.[tpl]cite journal|last=Miller|first=A. K.

==Distribution==

Grey matter is distributed at the surface of the cerebral hemispheres (cerebral cortex) and of the cerebellum (cerebellar cortex), as well as in the depths of the cerebrum (thalamus; hypothalamus; subthalamus, basal ganglia - putamen, globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens; septal nuclei), cerebellar (deep cerebellar nuclei - dentate nucleus, globose nucleus, emboliform nucleus, fastigial nucleus), brainstem (substantia nigra, red nucleus, olivary nuclei, cranial nerve nuclei) and spinal grey matter (anterior horn, lateral horn, posterior horn). Grey matter undergoes development and growth throughout childhood and adolescence.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sowell|first=Elizabeth|coauthors=Thompson, Tessner, Toga|title=Mapping Continued Brain Growth and Gray Matter Density Reduction in Dorsal Frontal Cortex: Inverse Relationships during Postadolescent Brain Maturation|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=15 November 2001[/tpl]

===Volume and cognition in elderly people===

Significant positive correlations have been found between grey matter volume in elderly persons and measures of semantic and short-term memory. No significant correlations with white matter volume were found. These results suggest that individual variability in specific cognitive functions that are relatively well preserved with ageing is accounted for by the variability of gray matter volume in healthy elderly subjects.[tpl]cite web|last=Taki, Y., Kinomura, S., Sato, K., Goto, R., Wu, K., Kawashima, R., & Fukuda, H.|title=Correlation between gray/white matter volume and cognition in healthy elderly people.|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/ehost/detail?vid=3&hid=15&sid=bb077608-d2b7-4bbd-b006-85f23b27db1b%40sessionmgr11&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2011-01976-010|publisher=Brain and Cognition|accessdate=2011-04-21[/tpl]

===Volume associated with bipolar disorder===

Some structural differences in grey matter may be associated with psychiatric disorders. There was no difference in whole-brain grey matter volume between patients with bipolar I disorder and healthy controls. Subjects with bipolar I disorder had smaller volumes in the left inferior parietal lobule, right superior temporal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and left caudate. Only the volume of the right middle frontal gyrus was correlated with duration of illness and the number of episodes in patients.[tpl]cite web|last=Li, M., Cui, L., Deng, W., Ma, X., Huang, C., Jiang, L., & ...

===Effects of smoking===

Older smokers lose grey matter and cognitive function at a greater rate than non-smokers. Chronic smokers who quit during the study lost fewer brain cells and retained better intellectual function than those who continued to smoke.[tpl]cite web|last=Almeida|first=Osvaldo|title=Smoking causes brain cell loss and cognitive decline|url=http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201102093273/business-and-industry/smoking-causes-brain-cell-loss-and-cognitive-decline|publisher=NeuroImage|accessdate=2011-04-21[/tpl]

===Effects of child abuse===

Adolescents who were subjected to abuse and neglect appear to have decreased grey matter in the prefrontal cortex.http://news.yale.edu/2011/12/05/past-abuse-leads-loss-grey-matter-brains-adolescents-0

==History==

===Etymology===

In the current editionFederative Committee on Anatomical Terminology (FCAT) (1998). Terminologia Anatomica. Stuttgart: Thieme of the official Latin nomenclature, Terminologia Anatomica, substantia grisea is used for English grey matter. The adjective grisea for grey is however not attested in classical Latin.Triepel, H. (1910). Die anatomischen Namen. Ihre Ableitung und Aussprache. Mit einem Anhang: Biographische Notizen.(Dritte Auflage). Wiesbaden: Verlag J.F. Bergmann. The adjective grisea is derived from the French word for grey, gris. Alternative designations like substantia cana Triepel, H. (1910). Nomina Anatomica. Mit Unterstützung von Fachphilologen. Wiesbaden: Verlag J.F. Bergmann. and substantia cinerea Schreger, C.H.Th.(1805). Synonymia anatomica. Synonymik der anatomischen Nomenclatur. Fürth: im Bureau für Literatur. are being used alternatively. The adjective cana, attested in classical Latin,Lewis, C.T. & Short, C. (1879). A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary. Oxford: Clarendon Press. can mean grey, or greyish white.Stearn, W.T. (1983). Botanical Latin. History, grammar, syntax, terminology and vocabulary. (3rd edition). Newton Abbot London: David Charles. The classical Latin cinerea means ash-colored.
