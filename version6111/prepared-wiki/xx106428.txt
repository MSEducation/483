The Corona Stadium (the name comes from the beer brand) was one of the smallest football (soccer) stadiums in Mexico having only capacity for 20,100 seats.  It was located in the city of Torre√≥n, Coahuila. This sport facility was used mostly for football games and was the home of the club Santos Laguna. This stadium did not host any FIFA World Cup games because of its limited size and facilities. In 2004 this stadium hosted several games of the Copa Libertadores.
