[[Cuban convertible peso]]

CATEGORIES: Circulating currencies, Economy of Cuba, Fixed exchange rate, 1994 introductions

The convertible peso (sometimes given as CUC$) (informally called a cuc' or "chavito"'), is one of two official currencies in Cuba, the other being the peso. It has been in limited use since 1994, when it was treated as equivalent to the U.S. dollar: its value was officially US$1.00. On 8 November 2004, the U.S. dollar ceased to be accepted in Cuban retail outlets leaving the convertible peso as the only currency in circulation in many Cuban businesses. Officially exchangeable only within the country, its value was increased to US$1.08 on 5 April 2008, and reverted to US$1.00 on 15 March 2011. The convertible peso is, by the pegged rate, the twelfth-highest-valued currency unit in the world and the highest valued "peso" unit.
On 22 October 2013, it was announced that the currency is to be scrapped by gradually unifying it with the lower value Cuban peso.[tpl]citeweb|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-24627620|title= Cuba to scrap two-currency system in latest reform|publisher= BBC News|date= October 22, 2013|accessdate= October 22, 2013[/tpl]

==History==

From 1993 until 2004, the Cuban currency was split between the Cuban peso (the currency Cuban citizens are paid in and used for staples and non-luxury items) and the U.S. dollar in combination with the convertible peso, which was a foreign exchange certificate (in use since at least 1985[tpl]citeweb|url= http://www.banknote.ws/COLLECTION/countries/AME/CUB/CUB-FEX.htm|title= CUBA - Foreign Exchange Certificates|publisher= Banknote.ws|date= |accessdate= November 10, 2013[/tpl]) used for tourism and for luxury items.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] The Cuban peso (CUP) can be exchanged to the convertible peso (CUC) at the exchange offices (CADECA), at a fixed rate of 24 CUP  to 1 CUC (sell) and 25 CUP to 1 CUC (buy); however, for state household book-keeping purposes, both pesos are valued at a 1:1 rate.
On 8 November 2004, the Cuban government withdrew the U.S. dollar from circulation citing the need to retaliate against further U.S. sanctions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/3339738 |title=Cuba's currency: Adios to the greenback |publisher=The Economist |date=2004-10-28 |accessdate=2011-09-30[/tpl] After a grace period ending on November 14, 2004, a 10% surcharge began to be imposed when converting U.S. dollars into convertible pesos. The change was announced some weeks beforehand and was extended by the aforementioned grace period (it has been claimed this was because the amounts of US dollars being exchanged were more than anticipated).[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl] This measure helped the Cuban government collect hard currency.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]

==Coins==

In 1994, coins were introduced in denominations of 5, 10, 25 and 50 centavos, and 1 peso. 5 pesos (rarely seen) was introduced in 1999, followed by 1 centavo coins in 2000.

==Banknotes==

In 1994, the Banco Central de Cuba introduced notes in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pesos. On December 18, 2006, the Banco Central de Cuba introduced a new series of notes themed to "Socialist History and Achievements". The front of the notes are similar to its previous series, but on the back of the notes, instead of depicting the Cuban coat of arms on all denominations, each of the notes now have individualized designs.Cuba issues new convertible peso series dated 2006 BanknoteNews.com.

==The CUC and the U.S. dollar==

Between April 2005 and March 2011, the convertible peso was worth 1.08 USD. The CUC is currently pegged to the U.S. dollar at 1:1, as it was between 1994 and 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bc.gov.cu/Espanol/Acuerdo30-11.asp |title=Política Monetaria |publisher=Bc.gov.cu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-30[/tpl]
