[[Dropsonde (album)]]

CATEGORIES: 2006 albums, Biosphere albums, Touch Music albums

Dropsonde is an ambient album by musician Biosphere (alias Geir Jenssen). Unlike his previous output, there is a notable jazz influence present on this album.

==Overview==

The title refers to a dropsonde,  a device designed to be dropped at altitude by parachute to collect data as the device falls to the ground (on Earth or sent to another planet.)
A Dropsonde sampler was pre-released on vinyl as a mini album on September 27, 2005, and the full album released on compact disc in January 2006 (though the track "In the Shape of a Flute" remained exclusive to the vinyl sampler). 
Unlike Jenssen's previous output, there is a notable jazz influence present on this album (such as on the tracks "Birds Fly By Flapping Their Wings" and "In Triple Time"), evocative of Miles Davis's 1970s jazz fusion works.Cf. the Allmusic review. Some tracks also integrates material Jenssen recorded in late 2001 during his climbing of the 8201 meters mount Cho Oyu in Himalaya. (The raw material itself was released some months later as Cho Oyu 8201m – Field Recordings from Tibet.)CD notes: "Birds on "Birds Fly..." recorded in Cho Oyu Base Camp (5700), Tibet, Oct. 2001."Sources at the Cho Oyu 8201m – Field Recordings from Tibet article.
