[[Innominate Tarn]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of Cumbria

Innominate Tarn is a small tarn in the northern Lake District National Park in England. It is situated at 520 metres above sea level, near the summit of Haystacks. The name Innominate means "without a name".
It was formerly known as Loaf Tarn, which referred to small islands of peat in the tarn resembling loaves.
The tarn is the location where Alfred Wainwright's ashes were scattered. He had expressed this wish in A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells Volume 7: The Western Fells, and in other publications.
"All I ask for, at the end, is a last long resting place by the side of Innominate Tarn, on Haystacks, where the water gently laps the gravelly shore and the heather blooms and Pillar and Gable keep unfailing watch. A quiet place, a lonely place. I shall go to it, for the last time, and be carried: someone who knew me in life will take me and empty me out of a little box and leave me there alone. And if you, dear reader, should get a bit of grit in your boot as you are crossing Haystacks in the years to come, please treat it with respect. It might be me."
~ Alfred Wainwright - from "Memoirs of a Fellwalker" (1990)
