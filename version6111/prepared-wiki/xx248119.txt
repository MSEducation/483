The Caspar U.1 (sometimes known as the Caspar-Heinkel U.1) was a 1920s German patrol seaplane designed by Ernst Heinkel and built by Caspar-Werke. The U.1 was designed to fit into a cylindrical container to allow it to be carried, then launched from a submarine.

==Development==

The U.1 was designed to meet a requirement to fit inside a cylindrical container [tpl]convert|7.40|m[/tpl] long with a diameter of [tpl]convert|1.70|m|abbr=on[/tpl]; this allowed the aircraft to be carried by a submarine. To reduce the time to launch the aircraft, it was built as a cantilever biplane to remove the need to rig struts and wires on assembly. The U.1 had two single-step floats and was powered by a front-mounted [tpl]convert|55|hp|adj=on[/tpl] Siemens radial piston engine. The pilot had an open cockpit behind the upper wing which gave a clear view forward. It is claimed that during tests, four men could remove the U.1 from the container and erect it in 1 minute 3 seconds. Two aircraft were bought by the United States Navy for evaluation; these were delivered to NAS Anacostia in late 1922, and were tested during 1923; one of the aircraft was lost over the course of the test program.[tpl]cite journal|last=Treadwell|first=Terry|date=February 1983|title=Submarine Aviation|journal=Naval Aviation News|publisher=Naval Air Systems Command|location=Washington, DC|volume=65|issue=2|page=9|issn=0028-1417[/tpl]
