CATEGORIES: White wine grape varieties

Rieslaner is a breed cross of the Silvaner and Riesling grape that was first bred in Veitsh√∂cheim, Franconia, Germany in 1921 by the grape breeder August Ziegler. It is a late ripening grape that is fairly high in acidity. Oz Clarke The Encyclopedia of Grapes Websters International Publishers 2001, pg 189 ISBN 0-15-100714-4   Today it is mostly grown in the Franconia (Franken) region and in the Palatinate (Pfalz) region where the grape is often affected by botrytis. Winegeeks.com Rieslaner is bred to do well with botrytis, and it holds a lot of potential to form an acidic, fruity, and full yield when it is ripened.
