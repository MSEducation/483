The eggplant is usually cut longitudinally  ([tpl]Lang-bn|বেগুন[/tpl] begun) and are dipped in a batter of Bengal gram flour with salt and turmeric, and deep-fried in mustard oil. Sometimes a small amount of poppy seeds is added to the batter. Some people prefer adding a small amount of baking powder to the batter to make it more crunchy. It is commonly consumed along with puffed rice and is an extremely popular street food in the cities. It is normally an evening snack in Bengali households and is a very common component of Iftar in Bangladesh during the month of Ramadan of the Islamic calendar.
Beguni is also a quintessential component of the Bengali monsoon cuisine, where it is consumed along with a rice and lentil preparation called Khichuri.
