In the present media-sensitive world, many organizations are increasingly likely to employ  professionals who have received formal training in journalism, communications, public relations and public affairs in this role in order to ensure that public announcements are made in the most appropriate fashion and through the most appropriate channels to maximize the impact of favorable messages, and to minimize the impact of unfavorable messages.  Popular local and national sports stars (such as Michael Jordan or Bob Uecker) are often chosen as spokesmen for commercial advertising.

==Identity==

A corporation may be represented in public by its chief executive officer, chairman or president, chief financial officer, counsel or external legal advisor. In addition, on a day-to-day level and for more routine announcements, the job may be delegated to the corporate communications or investor relations departments (or equivalents), who will act as spokesmen.
In the particle physics community, large collaborations of physicists elect one (or two) spokesperson(s) as leader(s) of the collaboration.  The spokesperson in such cases is the lead scientist of the collaboration, not a public speaker.  Each collaboration chooses the roles and responsibilities of the spokesperson for internal purposes, but typically spokespersons also have defined roles for liaising with the host laboratory and/or funding agencies.
