The District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment was a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution that would have given the District of Columbia full representation in the United States Congress, full representation in the Electoral College system, and full participation in the process by which the Constitution is amended.
This proposed amendment was proposed by the Congress on August 22, 1978. It was ratified by only 16 states by the time of its expiration on August 22, 1985, 22 ratifications short of the needed 38 in order for the proposed amendment to have been adopted.

The Congress, via Section 4 of the proposed amendment, required ratification by three-fourths (38) of the states to be completed within seven years following its passage by the Congress (i.e., August 22, 1985) in order for the proposed amendment to become part of the Constitution.In Dillon v.

==Ratification history==

Ratification by the legislatures of at least 38 of the 50 states by August 22, 1985 was necessary for the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment to become an operative part of the Constitution. During the seven-year period specified by Congress it was ratified by only 16 states and so failed to be adopted.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dcvote.org/trellis/response/1978amendmenthjres554.cfm|title=The 1978 Constitutional Amendment for DC Voting Representation|publisher=DC Vote|accessdate=October 22, 2013[/tpl] The amendment was ratified by the following states:

==Effects if it had been adopted==

Had it been adopted, this proposed amendment would have repealed the Twenty-third Amendment. The Twenty-third Amendment does not allow the District of Columbia to have more electoral votes "than the least populous State," nor does it grant Washington, D.C. any role in the election of a President by the House of Representatives (or that of the Vice President by the Senate). In contrast, this proposed amendment would have given Washington, D.C. full representation in both houses of the Congress in addition to full participation in the Electoral College. The proposed amendment would have also allowed the Council of the District of Columbia, the Congress, or the people of Washington D.C. (depending on how this proposed amendment would have been interpreted) to decide whether to ratify any proposed amendment to the Constitution, or to apply to the Congress for a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution, just as a state's legislature can pursuant to the Constitutional amendment process.
The amendment would neither have made Washington, D.C. a state, nor affected the Congress' authority over it.
