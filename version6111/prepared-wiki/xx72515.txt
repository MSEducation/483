In South Australia land titles still record which hundred a parcel of land is located in. Similar to the notion of the South Australian counties listed on the system of titles, hundreds are not generally used when referring to a district and are little known by the general population. Cumberland County (Sydney) was also divided into hundreds in the nineteenth century, although these were later repealed.  A hundred is traditionally one hundred square miles.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.atlas.sa.gov.au/go/resources/atlas-of-south-australia-1986/the-course-of-settlement/land-survey-and-disposal | work = Atlas of South Australia | title = Land Survey and Disposal |publisher= SA | location= AU |date = 2004-04-28 | accessdate =2010-01-31[/tpl]
