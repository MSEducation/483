thumb|aerial view of Vansittart IslandVansittart Island, also known as Gun Carriage Island, is a granite island, with an area of 800 ha, in south-eastern Australia.  It is part of Tasmania’s Vansittart Island Group, lying in eastern Bass Strait between Flinders and Cape Barren Islands in the Furneaux Group.  It is partly private property and partly leasehold land and is currently used for grazing wiltshire horn sheep. The island is part of the Franklin Sound Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it holds over 1% of the world populations of six bird species.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Franklin Sound Islands |accessdate=2011-06-22 |work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= [/tpl]

==Flora and fauna==

Most of the original vegetation of the island has been cleared by the use of fire and by bulldozers with chains, destroying many stands of Oyster Bay Pine.
Recorded breeding seabird and wader species are Little Penguin, Pacific Gull, Sooty Oystercatcher and Pied Oystercatcher.  Black Swans have nested on the island, which is also a refuge for Cape Barren Geese.  Reptiles present include Tiger Snake, Southern Grass Skink, Metallic Skink and Bougainville's Skink.  Red-necked Wallabies are present, and possibly Echidnas, though the Tasmanian Pademelon is extinct there.Brothers, Nigel; Pemberton, David; Pryor, Helen; & Halley, Vanessa. (2001).
