Bloom 06 were an Italian electronic dance music group, composed of two of the original three members of Eiffel 65, another group who compose different types of music ranging from electropop to mellowed rock. They have released two albums, Crash Test 01, Crash Test 02, and two remix EPs, Club Test 01 and Club Test 02. They have also released five singles since their debut in 2006.
The original group, Eiffel 65, has reformed as of June 2010.

==The Birth of Bloom 06==

Shortly after the departure of Gabry Ponte from Eiffel 65, due to a desire to begin a project of his own, Maurizio (Maury) Lobina (born on 1973 in Asti, Italy) and Gianfranco (Jeffrey) Randone officially announced, on 15 June 2006, that they had permanently  put the name Eiffel 65 behind them and they were ready to begin a new chapter in their artistic careers, releasing their current work under a new name which they had chosen as Bloom 06. The duo also confirmed that their debut album Crash Test 01 would be released on their brand new label Blue Boys, which would subsequently be distributed by Universal Italy in Fall of 2006. Through a press release published on a new Web domain, the Bloom 06 boys explained:

==Albums==

Their first album, titled Crash Test 01, was released in October 2006. It contained 8 tracks, 5 in English and 3 in Italian. The tracks were composed over the course of 2½–3 years, though during the time that Jeffrey and Maury were still working under Eiffel 65. This album was originally intended to be Eiffel's fourth album, but it was thought to be too dark for the band which until then had been characterized as playing upbeat and happy dance music. This partly contributed to Jeffrey and Maury's departure from Bliss Corporation.
The band's second album is considered to be a 'second chapter' or 'second part' of Crash Test 01[ref]
