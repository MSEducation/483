Martin Weber (December 9, 1890 in Frankfurt am Main – February 27, 1941) was a German architect who designed Catholic churches.

==Life and work==

After training in construction, he went to the building and art school in Offenbach am Main. In 1914-1915 he worked for Friedrich Pützer in Darmstadt, who built the Evangelical Church in Hesse, and then for Dominic Bohm in Offenbach am Main. During 1919-1921 he lived as an Oblate (Brother Maurus, OSB) in the Benedictine Abbey of Maria Laach. From 1921 to 1923 he ran a "studio for church architecture" with Bohm. In 1924 he established himself as an independent architect in Frankfurt. In 1935 he founded a "Study Circle of Sacred Art" with Rudolf Schwarz.  
He built mainly many Catholic churches, and became one of the leading church architects of the time.

==Style==

In Weber churches the altar is the centre and focus of the Mass. He conceived the church as an integral whole, without separate bays. The altar is emphasized according to its role, highlighted by the lighting.
