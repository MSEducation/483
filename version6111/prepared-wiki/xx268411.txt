Salam Shabab is a community of Iraqi youth committed to building peace in Iraq.  It is both the first reality television series geared toward empowering Iraqi teens and a social networking website where they can connect with one another and create online content in a variety of multimedia formats.

==Salam Shabab on TV==

The television series, with Season 1 prepped to air in Iraq and Season 2 filming just completed, follows 54 youth from twelve different Iraqi provinces as they compete in four categories of challenges: sport; mental; film; and performance.  The overall winners are dubbed the nation's "Ambassadors of Peace," and earn an audience with a group of Iraqi MPs with whom they can share their opinions and discuss issues that are important to them.

The online community is a free space for Iraqi teens to communicate, compete and express themselves openly.  They can write blogs, upload photos, videos and essays, and interact with members of the television cast.  Salam Shabab youth are also active on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Flickr.
