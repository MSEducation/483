The existing Minuteman-III missiles have been further improved over the decades in service, with more than $7 billion spent in the last decade to upgrade the 450 missiles."Life Extension Programs modernize ICBMs."

====Guidance Replacement Program (GRP)====

The Guidance Replacement Program (GRP) replaces the NS20A Missile Guidance Set with the NS50A Missile Guidance Set. The newer system extends the service life of the Minuteman missile beyond the year 2030 by replacing aging parts and assemblies with current, high reliability technology while maintaining the current accuracy performance.  The replacement program was completed 25 February 2008.

====Propulsion Replacement Program (PRP)====

Beginning in 1998 and continuing through 2009,2006 ATK press release on PRP[tpl]dead link|date=March 2011[/tpl]  the Propulsion Replacement Program extends the life and maintains the performance by replacing the old solid propellant boosters (downstages).

====Single Reentry Vehicle (SRV)====

The Single Reentry Vehicle (SRV) modification enabled the United States ICBM force to abide by the now-vacated START II treaty requirements by reconfiguring Minuteman-III missiles from three reentry vehicles down to one. Though it was eventually ratified by both parties, START II never entered into force and was essentially superseded by follow-on agreements such as SORT and New START, which do not limit MIRV capability.

====Safety Enhanced Reentry Vehicle (SERV)====

Beginning in 2005, Mk-21/W87 RVs from the deactivated Peacekeeper missile will be placed on the Minuteman-III force under the Safety Enhanced Reentry Vehicle (SERV) program. The older W78 currently used is not equipped with important safety features[tpl]Clarification needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]. In addition to implementing these safety features in at least a portion of the future Minuteman-III force, the decision to transfer W87s onto the missile is based on two features that will improve the targeting capabilities of the weapon: more fuzing options which will allow for greater targeting flexibility and the most accurate reentry vehicle available which provides a greater probability of damage to the designated targets. The first SERV-modded Minuteman-III was put on alert status at FE Warren AFB, Wyoming, in 2006.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl]

==Current and future deployment==

The Minuteman-III missile entered service in 1970, with weapon systems upgrades included during the production run from 1970 to 1978 to increase accuracy and payload capacity. [tpl]As of|2008[/tpl], the USAF plans to operate it until at least 2030.
The LGM-118A Peacekeeper (MX) ICBM, which was to have replaced the Minuteman, was retired in 2005 as part of START II.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123011845 | title=Peacekeeper missile mission ends during ceremony | first=Joshua S. | last=Edwards | date=2005-09-20 | publisher=United States Air Force | accessdate=2009-05-28 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/6vOy|archivedate=2012-07-17[/tpl]
A total of 450 LGM-30G missiles are emplaced at F.E.

==Testing==

Minuteman-III missiles are regularly tested with launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base in order to validate the effectiveness, readiness, and accuracy of the weapon system, as well as to support the system's primary purpose, nuclear deterrence.  The safety features installed on the Minuteman-III for each test launch allow the flight controllers to terminate the flight at any time if the systems indicate that its course may take it unsafely over inhabited areas.  Since these flights are for test purposes only, even terminated flights can send back valuable information to correct a potential problem with the system.
The 576th Flight Test Squadron is responsible for planning, preparing, conducting, and assessing all ICBM ground and flight tests.

==Influences==

The Minuteman Missile National Historic Site in South Dakota preserves a Launch Control Facility (D-01) and a launch facility (D-09) under the control of the National Park Service.

==Appearances in media==

Footage of Minuteman-III ICBM test launches have been featured in several theatrical films and television movies where missile launch footage is needed. The Department of Defense film released for use was mainly drawn from Vandenberg Air Force Base test shots in 1966, including from a "salvo launch" (more than one ICBM launched simultaneously).
Theatrically released films using the footage include (most notably), the 1978 film Superman (which features the "twin shot"), and more extensively, the 1977 nuclear war film Damnation Alley. The made for TV film The Day After also features the same footage, although the first stage of flight is completed via special effects. Terminator 3 uses computer generated images of Minuteman missiles launching from the Plains on "Judgment Day". Minutemen also feature in Eagle Strike, by Anthony Horowitz, in which fictional power-crazed multimillionaire Damian Cray orders their release from Air Force One.  In the film WarGames a failed Minuteman launch simulation exercise caused by a conflicted launch control officer is the impetus for the conversion of the missiles to full automatic control by the computer system that Matthew Broderick's character later hacks into.

==Other roles==

===Mobile Minuteman===

Mobile Minuteman was a program for rail-based ICBMs to help increase survivability and for which the USAF released details on October 12, 1959.  The Operation Big Star performance test was from June 20 to August 27, 1960 at Hill Air Force Base, and the 4062nd Strategic Missile Wing (Mobile) was organized 1 December 1960 for 3 planned missile train squadrons, each with 10 trains carrying 3 missiles per train. During the Kennedy/McNamara cutbacks, the DoD announced "that it has abandoned the plan for a mobile Minuteman ICBM.  The concept called for 600 to be placed in service--450 in silos and 150 on special trains, each train carrying 5 missiles."[tpl]Cite journal |journal=Flight |date=December 21, 1961 |page=844[/tpl] (cited by [tpl]Cite journal |journal=Aerospace America |date=December 2011 |title=Out of the Past: 50 Years Ago, December 1961 |page=76[/tpl])  After Kennedy announced on March 18, 1961, that the 3 squadrons were to be replaced with "fixed-base squadrons",[tpl]Citation |format=Kennedy speech |title=title tbd |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=8554 |quote=The three mobile Minuteman squadrons funded in the January budget should be deferred for the time being and replaced by three more fixed-base squadrons (thus increasing the total number of missiles added by some two-thirds). Development work on the mobile version will continue.[/tpl] Strategic Air Command discontinued the 4062nd Strategic Missile Wing on 20 February 1962.

===Air Launched ICBM===

Air Launched ICBM was a STRAT-X proposal[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/milestones.asp?dec=1970-1980&sd=01/01/1970&ed=12/31/1989 |title=History Milestones |author= |work=U.S. Air Force |publisher=AF.mil |accessdate=24 February 2012|archiveurl=http://archive.is/5PWL|archivedate=19 July 2012[/tpl] in which SAMSO successfully conducted an Air Mobile Feasibility Test that airdropped a Minuteman from a C-5A Galaxy aircraft from [tpl]Convert|20000|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] over the Pacific Ocean. The missile fired at [tpl]Convert|8000|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], and the 10-second engine burn carried the missile to 20,000 feet again before it dropped into the ocean.  Operational deployment was discarded due to engineering and security difficulties, and the capability was a negotiating point in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.U.S. Air Force, Inside the AF.MIL Heritage section (Thursday, January 01, 1970 – Sunday, December 31, 1989)Marti and Sarigul-Klijn, A Study of Air Launch Methods for RLVs. Doc No. AIAA 2001-4619, Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering Dept, University of California, Davis, CA 95616

===Emergency Rocket Communications System (ERCS)===

An additional part of the National Command Authority communication relay system was called the Emergency Rocket Communication System (ERCS). Specially designed rockets called BLUE SCOUT carried radio-transmitting payloads high above the continental United States, to relay messages to units within line-of-sight. In the event of a nuclear attack, ERCS payloads would relay pre-programmed messages giving the “go-order” to SAC units. BLUE SCOUT launch sites were located at Wisner, West Point and Tekamah, Nebraska. These locations were vital for ERCS effectiveness due to their centralized position in the US, within range of all missile complexes. Later ERCS configurations were placed on the top of modified Minuteman-II ICBMs (LGM-30Fs) under the control of the 510th Strategic Missile Squadron located at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri.
The Minuteman ERCS may have been assigned the designation LEM-70A.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-70.html |title=Boeing LEM-70 Minuteman ERCS |first=Andreas |last=Parsch |year=2002 |work=Directory of U.S. Military Rockets and Missiles |publisher=designation-systems.net |accessdate=2011-01-10[/tpl]

===Satellite launching role===

The U.S. Air Force has considered using some decommissioned Minuteman missiles in a satellite launching role. These missiles would be stored in silos, for launch upon short notice. The payload would be variable, and would have the ability to be replaced quickly. This would allow a surge capability in times of emergency.
During the 1980s, surplus Minuteman missiles were used to power the Conestoga rocket produced by Space Services Inc. of America. It was the first privately developed rocket, but only saw three flights and was discontinued due to a lack of business. More recently, converted Minuteman missiles have been used to power the Minotaur line of rockets produced by Orbital Sciences.

===Ground and air launch targets===

L-3 Communications is currently using SR-19 SRBs, Minuteman-II Second Stage Solid Rocket Boosters, as delivery vehicles for a range of different re-entry vehicles as targets for the THAAD and ASIP interceptor missile programs as well as radar testing.

==Operator==

[tpl]USA[/tpl]: The United States Air Force has been the only operator of the Minuteman ICBM weapons system, currently with three operational wings and one test squadron operating the LGM-30G. The active inventory in FY 2009 is 450 missiles and 45 Missile Alert Facilities (MAF).

===Operational units===

The basic tactical unit of a Minuteman wing is the squadron, consisting of five flights. Each flight consists of ten unmanned launch facilities (LFs) which are remotely controlled by a manned launch control center (LCC). The five flights are interconnected and status from any LF may be monitored by any of the five LCCs. Each LF is located at least three nautical miles (5.6 km) from any LCC. Control does not extend outside the squadron (thus the 319th Missile Squadron’s five LCCs cannot control the 320th Missile Squadron’s 50 LFs even though they are part of the same Space Launch Wing). Each Minuteman wing is assisted logistically by a nearby Missile Support Base (MSB).
