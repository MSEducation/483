[[Eisenstein integral]]

CATEGORIES: Representation theory

In mathematical representation theory, the Eisenstein integral is an integral introduced by [tpl]harvs|txt|last=Harish-Chandra|authorlink=Harish-Chandra|year1=1970|year2=1972[/tpl] in the representation theory of semisimple Lie groups, analogous to Eisenstein series in the theory of automorphic forms.
[tpl]harvs|txt|last=Harish-Chandra|year1=1975|year2=1976a|year3=1976b[/tpl] used Eisenstein integrals to decompose the regular representation of a semisimple Lie group into representations induced from parabolic subgroups. 
[tpl]harvtxt|Trombi|1989[/tpl] gave a survey of Harish-Chandra's work on this.
