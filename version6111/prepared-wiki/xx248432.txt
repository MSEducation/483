Villa Carminati-Ferrario is a building located in Monza, Italy, in piazza Citterio, built in 1830 and designed by the architect Pietro Pestagalli, in late neoclassical style.
The layout of the villa is u-shaped, centred around an internal courtyard, which reflects the architectural taste of Bourgeois families at the time. A small garden with two palm trees is located at the front of the building facing piazza Citterio.
The facade is symmetrical, and decorated with reliefs, depicting the four seasons by Girolamo Rusca.
