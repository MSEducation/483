==Criticism and controversies==

===Operator fatigue===

An investigation by The Oregonian led to the revelation that some TriMet drivers work as many as 22 hours in a 24 hour period. There have also been 22 reported cases of drivers falling asleep at the wheel.Rose, Joseph. "TriMet board member demands action in light of investigation by The Oregonian."

===Failure rate of MAX ticket vending machines===

An investigation by several local Portland news outlets found that several of the MAX Light Rail ticket machines have extremely high failure rates. Many riders have claimed that they have received a fare evasion citation after boarding the MAX train without a fare after they have attempted to pay for a ticket. The official statement from TriMet is to ride to the next MAX station, de-board the train and pay for a ticket there and wait for the next train. This response has been deemed unacceptable both by riders and bus/rail operators. TriMet has began replacing all of their older machines with newer machines, but the break-downs have persisted with newer machines. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

===Sanctioned for illegal employee negotiations behavior===

On January 3, 2013 TriMet was found by The Oregon Employment Relations Board to be in violation of ORS 243.672 by restricting the ATU 757 from attending contract negotiation hearings. In retaliation to the ATU filing a ULP earlier in 2010, TriMet implemented a wage freeze requiring all employees to pay their increases in healthcare premiums and changing insurance plans after the union contract expired without first discussing it with the union.
