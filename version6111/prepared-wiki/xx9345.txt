CATEGORIES: Aging-associated diseases, Endocrine diseases, Osteopathies

Osteoporosis ("porous bones", from Greek: οστούν/ostoun meaning "bone" and πόρος/poros meaning "pore") is a progressive bone disease that is characterized by a decrease in bone mass and density which can lead to an increased risk of fracture.[tpl]cite book |author=Brian K Alldredge; Koda-Kimble, Mary Anne; Young, Lloyd Y.; Wayne A Kradjan; B. Joseph Guglielmo |title=Applied therapeutics: the clinical use of drugs |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2009 |pages=101–3 |isbn=0-7817-6555-2[/tpl] In osteoporosis, the bone mineral density (BMD) is reduced, bone microarchitecture deteriorates, and the amount and variety of proteins in bone are altered. Osteoporosis is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a bone mineral density of 2.5 standard deviations or more below the mean peak bone mass (average of young, healthy adults) as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; the term "established osteoporosis" includes the presence of a fragility fracture.[tpl]cite journal |author=WHO |title=Assessment of fracture risk and its application to screening for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Report of a WHO Study Group |journal=World Health Organization technical report series |volume=843 |pages=1–129 |year=1994 |pmid=7941614 [/tpl] The disease may be classified as primary type 1, primary type 2, or secondary. The form of osteoporosis most common in women after menopause is referred to as primary type 1 or postmenopausal osteoporosis. Primary type 2 osteoporosis or senile osteoporosis occurs after age 75 and is seen in both females and males at a ratio of 2:1. Secondary osteoporosis may arise at any age and affect men and women equally. This form results from chronic predisposing medical problems or disease, or prolonged use of medications such as glucocorticoids, when the disease is called steroid- or glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.
The risk of osteoporosis fractures can be reduced with lifestyle changes and in those with previous osteoporosis related fractures medications. Lifestyle change includes diet, exercise, and preventing falls. The utility of calcium and vitamin D is questionable in most. Bisphosphonates are useful in those with previous fractures from osteoporosis but are of minimal benefit in those who have osteoporosis but no previous fractures. Osteoporosis is a component of the frailty syndrome.

==Signs and symptoms==

Osteoporosis itself has no symptoms; its main consequence is the increased risk of bone fractures. Osteoporotic fractures occur in situations where healthy people would not normally break a bone; they are therefore regarded as fragility fractures. Typical fragility fractures occur in the vertebral column, rib, hip and wrist.

===Fractures===

Fractures are the most dangerous aspect of osteoporosis. Debilitating acute and chronic pain in the elderly is often attributed to fractures from  osteoporosis and can lead to further disability and early mortality.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Old|first1=JL|last2=Calvert|first2= M|title=Vertebral compression fractures in the elderly|journal=American Family Physician|year=2004|volume=69|issue=1|pages=111–6|pmid=14727827|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/0101/p111.html|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl] These fractures may also be asymptomatic. The most common osteoporotic fractures are of the wrist, spine, shoulder and hip. The symptoms of a vertebral collapse ("compression fracture") are sudden back pain, often with radicular pain (shooting pain due to nerve root compression) and rarely with spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome. Multiple vertebral fractures lead to a stooped posture, loss of height, and chronic pain with resultant reduction in mobility.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kim DH, Vaccaro AR |title=Osteoporotic compression fractures of the spine; current options and considerations for treatment |journal=The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=479–87 |year=2006 |pmid=16934715 |doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2006.04.013[/tpl]
Fractures of the long bones acutely impair mobility and may require surgery. Hip fracture, in particular, usually requires prompt surgery, as serious risks are associated with it, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and increased mortality.
Fracture risk calculators assess the risk of fracture based upon several criteria, including BMD, age, smoking, alcohol usage, weight, and gender. Recognized calculators include FRAX[tpl]cite web|url= http://courses.washington.edu/bonephys/FxRiskCalculator.html|title= Fracture Risk Calculator|author=Susan Ott |accessdate=2009-11-03 [/tpl] and Dubbo.

===Falls risk===

The increased risk of falling associated with aging leads to fractures of the wrist, spine, and hip. The risk of falling, in turn, is increased by impaired eyesight due to any cause (e.g. glaucoma, macular degeneration), balance disorder, movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease), dementia, and sarcopenia (age-related loss of skeletal muscle). Collapse (transient loss of postural tone with or without loss of consciousness) leads to a significant risk of falls; causes of syncope are manifold, but may include cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart beat), vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension (abnormal drop in blood pressure on standing up), and seizures. Removal of obstacles and loose carpets in the living environment may substantially reduce falls. Those with previous falls, as well as those with gait or balance disorders, are most at risk.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ganz DA, Bao Y, Shekelle PG, Rubenstein LZ |title=Will my patient fall? |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=1 |pages=77–86 |year=2007 |pmid=17200478 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.1.77[/tpl]

==Risk factors==

Risk factors for osteoporotic fracture can be split between nonmodifiable and (potentially) modifiable. In addition, osteoporosis is a recognized complication in specific diseases and disorders. Medication use is theoretically modifiable, although in many cases, the use of medication that increases osteoporosis risk may be unavoidable.
Caffeine is not a risk factor for osteoporosis.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Waugh|first1=EJ|last2=Lam|first2=MA|last3=Hawker|first3=GA|last4=McGowan|first4=J|last5=Papaioannou|first5=A|last6=Cheung|first6=AM|last7=Hodsman|first7=AB|last8=Leslie|first8=WD|last9=Siminoski|first9=K|last10=Jamal|first10=SA|last11=Perimenopause BMD Guidelines Subcommittee of Osteoporosis, Canada|title=Risk factors for low bone mass in healthy 40–60 year old women: a systematic review of the literature|journal=Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA|date=January 2009|volume=20|issue=1|pages=1–21|pmid=18523710|doi=10.1007/s00198-008-0643-x[/tpl]

===Nonmodifiable===

===Potentially modifiable===

===Medical disorders===

Many diseases and disorders have been associated with osteoporosis.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070718014056/http://www.icsi.org/osteoporosis/diagnosis_and_treatment_of_osteoporosis__3.html |title=ICSI Health Care Guideline: Diagnosis and Treatment of Osteoporosis, 5th edition |accessdate=2008-04-08 |author=Simonelli, C et al. |date=July 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement[/tpl] For some, the underlying mechanism influencing the bone metabolism is straightforward, whereas for others the causes are multiple or unknown.

===Medication===

Certain medications have been associated with an increase in osteoporosis risk; only steroids and anticonvulsants are classically associated, but evidence is emerging with regard to other drugs.

===Evolutionary===

Age related bone loss is common among humans due to exhibiting less dense bones than other primate species.[tpl]cite journal |author=Latimer B |year=2005 |title= Editorial: The Perils of Being Bipedal |journal= Annals of biomedical engineering |volume=33| issue=1 |pages=3–6 |doi=10.1007/s10439-005-8957-8[/tpl] Because of the more porous bones of humans, frequency of severe osteoporosis and osteoporosis related fractures is higher.[tpl]cite journal | author=Cotter M et. al |year=2011 |title= Human evolution and osteoporosis-related spinal fractures |journal= PloS one |volume=6 | issue=10[/tpl] The human vulnerability to osteoporosis is an obvious cost but it can be justified by the advantage of bipedalism inferring that this vulnerability is the byproduct of such. It has been suggested that porous bones help to absorb the increased stress that we have on two surfaces compared to our primate counterparts who have four surfaces to disperse the force.[tpl]cite journal | author=Latimer B|year=2005 |title= Editorial: The Perils of Being Bipedal |journal= Annals of biomedical engineering |volume=33 | issue=1|pages=3–6 |doi=10.1007/s10439-005-8957-8[/tpl] In addition, the porosity allows for more flexibility and a lighter skeleton that is easier to support. One other consideration may be that diets today have much lower amounts of calcium than the diets of other primates or the tetrapedal ancestors to humans which may lead to higher likelihood to show signs of osteoporosis.[tpl]cite journal | author=Eaton S, Nelson D |year=1991 |title= Calcium in evolutionary perspective |journal= American journal of clinical nutrition |volume=54 | issue=1 |pages=281S-287S[/tpl]

==Pathogenesis==

The underlying mechanism in all cases of osteoporosis is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. In normal bone, matrix remodeling of bone is constant; up to 10% of all bone mass may be undergoing remodeling at any point in time. The process takes place in bone multicellular units (BMUs) as first described by Frost in 1963.Frost HM, Thomas CC. Bone Remodeling Dynamics. Springfield, IL: 1963. Bone is resorbed by osteoclast cells (which derive from the bone marrow), after which new bone is deposited by osteoblast cells.[tpl]cite journal | author = Raisz L | title = Pathogenesis of osteoporosis: concepts, conflicts, and prospects | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 115 | issue = 12 | pages = 3318–25 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16322775 | url=http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/115/12/3318 | doi=10.1172/JCI27071 | pmc = 1297264[/tpl]
The three main mechanisms by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass (the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth), excessive bone resorption, and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling. An interplay of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue. Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. as a result of menopause) increases bone resorption, as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in weight-bearing bones. The amount of estrogen needed to suppress this process is lower than that normally needed to stimulate the uterus and breast gland. The α-form of the estrogen receptor appears to be the most important in regulating bone turnover. In addition to estrogen, calcium metabolism plays a significant role in bone turnover, and deficiency of calcium and vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition; in addition, the parathyroid glands react to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone (parathormone, PTH), which increases bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the blood. The role of calcitonin, a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH.
The activation of osteoclasts is regulated by various molecular signals, of which the receptor activator for nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) is one of best studied. This molecule is produced by osteoblasts and other cells (e.g. lymphocytes), and stimulates RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB). Osteoprotegerin (OPG) binds RANKL before it has an opportunity to bind to RANK, and hence suppresses its ability to increase bone resorption. RANKL, RANK and OPG are closely related to tumor necrosis factor and its receptors. The role of the Wnt signaling pathway is recognized, but less well understood. Local production of eicosanoids and interleukins is thought to participate in the regulation of bone turnover, and excess or reduced production of these mediators may underlie the development of osteoporosis.
Trabecular bone (or cancellous bone) is the sponge-like bone in the ends of long bones and vertebrae. Cortical bone is the hard outer shell of bones and the middle of long bones. Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts inhabit the surface of bones, trabecular bone is more active, and is more subject to bone turnover and remodeling. Not only is bone density decreased, but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted. The weaker spicules of trabecular bone break ("microcracks"), and are replaced by weaker bone. Common osteoporotic fracture sites, the wrist, the hip and the spine, have a relatively high trabecular bone to cortical bone ratio. These areas rely on trabecular bone for strength, so the intense remodeling causes these areas to degenerate most when the remodeling is imbalanced.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl] Around the ages of 30–35, cancellous or trabecular bone loss begins. Women may lose as much as 50%, while men lose about 30%.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made using conventional radiography and by measuring the bone mineral density (BMD).[tpl]cite journal|author=Guglielmi G, Scalzo G. |url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/display/article/113619/1565165 |title=Imaging tools transform diagnosis of osteoporosis|journal=Diagnostic Imaging Europe|date=May 6, 2010|volume=26|pages=7–11[/tpl] The most popular method of measuring BMD is dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. In addition to the detection of abnormal BMD, the diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigations into potentially modifiable underlying causes; this may be done with blood tests. Depending on the likelihood of an underlying problem, investigations for cancer with metastasis to the bone, multiple myeloma, Cushing's disease and other above-mentioned causes may be performed.

===Conventional radiography===

Conventional radiography is useful, both by itself and in conjunction with CT or MRI, for detecting complications of osteopenia (reduced bone mass; preosteoporosis), such as fractures; for differential diagnosis of osteopenia; or for follow-up examinations in specific clinical settings, such as soft tissue calcifications, secondary hyperparathyroidism, or osteomalacia in renal osteodystrophy. However, radiography is relatively insensitive to detection of early disease and requires a substantial amount of bone loss (about 30%) to be apparent on X-ray images.
The main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Frequent complications of osteoporosis are vertebral fractures for which spinal radiography can help considerably in diagnosis and follow-up. Vertebral height measurements can objectively be made using plain-film X-rays by using several methods such as height loss together with area reduction, particularly when looking at vertical deformity in T4-L4, or by determining a spinal fracture index that takes into account the number of vertebrae involved. Involvement of multiple vertebral bodies leads to kyphosis of the thoracic spine, leading to what is known as dowager's hump.

===Dual-energy X-ray===

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone mineral density is less than or equal to 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young (30–40-year-old:58), healthy adult women reference population. This is translated as a T-score. But because bone density decreases with age, more people become osteoporotic with increasing age.:58 The World Health Organization has established the following diagnostic guidelines:[tpl]cite web | author=WHO Scientific Group on the Prevention and Management of Osteoporosis (2000 : Geneva, Switzerland) |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_921.pdf |title=Prevention and management of osteoporosis : report of a WHO scientific group| year=2003 |accessdate=2007-05-31 |format=PDF [/tpl]
The International Society for Clinical Densitometry takes the position that a diagnosis of osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone. It also states, for premenopausal women, Z-scores (comparison with age group rather than peak bone mass) rather than T-scores should be used, and the diagnosis of osteoporosis in such women also should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone.[tpl]cite journal |author=Leib ES, Lewiecki EM, Binkley N, Hamdy RC |title=Official positions of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry |journal=J Clin Densitom |volume=7 |issue=1 | year=2004 |pmid=14742881 | doi=10.1385/JCD:7:1:1 |pages=1–5[/tpl] quoted in: "Diagnosis of osteoporosis in men, premenopausal women, and children"

===Biomarkers===

Chemical biomarkers are a useful tool in detecting bone degradation. The enzyme cathepsin K breaks down type-I collagen protein, an important constituent in bones. Prepared antibodies can recognize the resulting fragment, called a neoepitope, as a way to diagnose osteoporosis.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Yasuda|first1=Y|first2=K |last2=Kaleta |last3= Brömme |first3=D|title=The role of cathepsins in osteoporosis and arthritis: Rationale for the design of new therapeutics|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|year=2005|volume=57|issue=7|pages=973–993|pmid=15876399|doi=10.1016/j.addr.2004.12.013[/tpl] Increased urinary excretion of C-telopeptides, a type-I collagen breakdown product, also serves as a biomarker for osteoporosis.[tpl]cite book|last1=Meunier|first1=Pierre|title=Osteoporosis: Diagnosis and Management|year=1998|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London|isbn=1-85317-412-2[/tpl]

===Other measuring tools===

Quantitative computed tomography differs from DXA in that it gives separate estimates of BMD for trabecular and cortical bone and reports precise volumetric mineral density in mg/cm3 rather than BMD's relative Z score. Among QCT's advantages: it can be performed at axial and peripheral sites, can be calculated from existing CT scans without a separate radiation dose, is sensitive to change over time, can analyze a region of any size or shape, excludes irrelevant tissue such as fat, muscle, and air, and does not require knowledge of the patient's subpopulation in order to create a clinical score (e.g. the Z-score of all females of a certain age). Among QCT's disadvantages: it requires a high radiation dose compared to DXA, CT scanners are large and expensive, and because its practice has been less standardized than BMD, its results are more operator-dependent. Peripheral QCT has been introduced to improve upon the limitations of DXA and QCT.
Quantitative ultrasound has many advantages in assessing osteoporosis. The modality is small, no ionizing radiation is involved, measurements can be made quickly and easily, and the cost of the device is low compared with DXA and QCT devices. The calcaneus is the most common skeletal site for quantitative ultrasound assessment because it has a high percentage of trabecular bone that is replaced more often than cortical bone, providing early evidence of metabolic change. Also, the calcaneus is fairly flat and parallel, reducing repositioning errors. The method can be applied to children, neonates, and preterm infants, just as well as to adults. Once microimaging tools to examine specific aspects of bone quality are developed, it is expected that quantitative ultrasound will be increasingly used in clinical practice.

===Screening===

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend that all women 65 years of age or older be screened by bone densitometry.[tpl]cite journal|last=U.S. Preventive Services Task|first=Force|title=Screening for osteoporosis: U.S. preventive services task force recommendation statement|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=2011-03-01|volume=154|issue=5|pages=356–64|pmid=21242341|doi=10.1059/0003-4819-154-5-201103010-00307[/tpl] Additionally they recommend screening women with increased risk factors that puts them at risk equivalent to a 65 year old. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations about the intervals for repeated screening and the appropriate age to stop screening. In men the harm versus benefit of screening for osteoporosis is unknown. A number of tool exist to help determine who is reasonable to test.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Rud|first1=B|last2=Hilden|first2= J|last3= Hyldstrup|first3= L|last4=Hróbjartsson|first4= A|title=The Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool versus alternative tests for selecting postmenopausal women for bone mineral density assessment: a comparative systematic review of accuracy|journal=Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA|date=April 2009|volume=20|issue=4|pages=599–607|pmid=18716823|doi=10.1007/s00198-008-0713-0[/tpl]

==Management==

===Lifestyle===

Lifestyle prevention of osteoporosis is in many aspects the inverse of the potentially modifiable risk factors. As tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis, smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended as ways to help prevent it.
Weight-bearing endurance exercise and/or exercises to strengthen muscles improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Body|first1=JJ|last2=Bergmann|first2=P|last3= Boonen|first3=S|last4= Boutsen|first4= Y|last5= Bruyere|first5= O|last6= Devogelaer|first6= JP|last7= Goemaere|first7= S|last8= Hollevoet|first8= N|last9= Kaufman|first9= JM|last10= Milisen|first10= K|last11= Rozenberg|first11= S|last12= Reginster|first12=JY|title=Non-pharmacological management of osteoporosis: a consensus of the Belgian Bone Club|journal=Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA|date=November 2011|volume=22|issue=11|pages=2769–88|pmid=21360219|doi=10.1007/s00198-011-1545-x|pmc=3186889[/tpl] Aerobics, weight bearing, and resistance exercises all maintain or increase BMD in postmenopausal women.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bonaiuti D, Shea B, Iovine R,et al. |title=Exercise for preventing and treating osteoporosis in postmenopausal women|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=3 |pages=CD000333 |year=2002|pmid=12137611| doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000333[/tpl] Fall prevention can help prevent osteoporosis complications.

===Nutrition===

As of 2013 there is insufficient evidence to determine if supplementation with calcium and vitamin D results in greater harm or benefit in men and premenopausal women.[tpl]cite journal|last=Moyer|first=VA|last2=on behalf of the U.S. Preventive Services Task, Force*|title=Vitamin D and Calcium Supplementation to Prevent Fractures in Adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=Feb 26, 2013|pmid=23440163|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-158-9-201305070-00603[/tpl] Low dose supplementation (less than 1 g of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D) is not recommended in postmenopausal women as there does not appear to be a difference in fracture risk. It is unknown what effect higher doses have. There however may be some benefit for the frail elderly living in care homes.[tpl]cite journal|last=Avenell|first=A|last2=Gillespie|first2= WJ|last3= Gillespie|first3= LD|last4= O'Connell|first4= D|title=Vitamin D and vitamin D analogues for preventing fractures associated with involutional and post-menopausal osteoporosis|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Apr 15, 2009|issue=2|pages=CD000227|pmid=19370554|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000227.pub3[/tpl]

===Medications===

Bisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the risk of future fractures in those who have already sustained a fracture due to osteoporosis.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wells|first=GA|coauthors=Cranney, A; Peterson, J; Boucher, M; Shea, B; Robinson, V; Coyle, D; Tugwell, P|title=Alendronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Jan 23, 2008|issue=1|pages=CD001155|pmid=18253985|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001155.pub2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Wells|first=G|coauthors=Cranney, A; Peterson, J; Boucher, M; Shea, B; Robinson, V; Coyle, D; Tugwell, P|title=Risedronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Jan 23, 2008|issue=1|pages=CD004523|pmid=18254053|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004523.pub3[/tpl] This benefit is present when taken for three to four years.[tpl]cite journal|last=Whitaker|first=Marcea|last2=Guo|first2=Jia|last3=Kehoe|first3=Theresa|last4= Benson|first4=George|title=Bisphosphonates for Osteoporosis — Where Do We Go from Here?|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=9 May 2012|page=120509140014000|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1202619|volume=366|issue=22[/tpl] They have not been compared directly to each other, though, so it is not known if one is better. Fracture risk reduction is between 25 and 70% depending on the bone involved.

==Prognosis==

Although osteoporosis patients have an increased mortality rate due to the complications of fracture, it is rarely lethal.
Hip fractures can lead to decreased mobility and additional risks of numerous complications (such as deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia). The six-month mortality rate following hip fracture is around 13.5%, and a substantial proportion (almost 13%) of people who have suffered a hip fracture need total assistance to mobilize after a hip fracture.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hannan EL, Magaziner J, Wang JJ, et al. |title=Mortality and locomotion 6 months after hospitalization for hip fracture: risk factors and risk-adjusted hospital outcomes |journal=JAMA |volume=285 |issue=21 |pages=2736–42 |year=2001 |pmid=11386929| doi = 10.1001/jama.285.21.2736[/tpl]
Vertebral fractures, while having a smaller impact on mortality, can lead to severe chronic pain of neurogenic origin, which can be hard to control, as well as deformity. Though rare, multiple vertebral fractures can lead to such severe hunch back (kyphosis), the resulting pressure on internal organs can impair one's ability to breathe.
Apart from risk of death and other complications, osteoporotic fractures are associated with a reduced health-related quality of life.[tpl]cite journal |author=Brenneman SK, Barrett-Connor E, Sajjan S, Markson LE, Siris ES |title=Impact of recent fracture on health-related quality of life in postmenopausal women |journal=J.

==Epidemiology==

Osteoporosis affects 55% of Americans aged 50 and above. Of these, approximately 80% are women.[ref]National Osteoporosis Foundation (2002). America’s Bone Health: The State of Osteoporosis and Low Bone Mass in Our Nation.
Washington, DC: National Osteoporosis Foundation.[/ref] One in three women and one in 12 men over the age of 50 worldwide are estimated to have osteoporosis.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] It is responsible for millions of fractures annually, mostly involving the lumbar vertebrae, hip, and wrist. Fragility fractures of ribs are also common in men.

===Hip fractures===

Hip fractures are responsible for the most serious consequences of osteoporosis. In the United States, more than 250,000 hip fractures annually are attributable to osteoporosis.[tpl]cite journal|last=Riggs|first=BL|last2=Melton |first2=LJ|title=The worldwide problem of osteoporosis: insights afforded by epidemiology|journal=Bone|date=November 1995|volume=17|issue=5 Suppl|pages=505S–511S|pmid=8573428|doi=10.1016/8756-3282(95)00258-4[/tpl] A 50-year-old white woman is estimated to have a 17.5% lifetime risk of fracture of the proximal femur. The incidence of hip fractures increases each decade from the sixth through the ninth for both women and men for all populations. The highest incidence is found among men and women ages 80 or older.

===Vertebral fractures===

Between 35 and 50% of all women over 50 had at least one vertebral fracture. In the United States, 700,000 vertebral fractures occur annually, but only about a third are recognized. In a series of 9704 women aged 68.8 on average studied for 15 years, 324 had already suffered a vertebral fracture at entry into the study and 18.2% developed a vertebral fracture, but that risk rose to 41.4% in women who had a previous vertebral fracture.[tpl]cite journal | author = Cauley JA, Hochberg MC, Lui LY et al. | year=2007 | title=Long-term Risk of Incident Vertebral Fractures |journal = JAMA |volume =298|pages=2761–67|doi= 10.1001/jama.298.23.2761 | pmid=18165669 | issue = 23[/tpl]

===Wrist fractures===

In the United States, 250,000 wrist fractures annually are attributable to osteoporosis. Wrist fractures are the third most common type of osteoporotic fractures. The lifetime risk of sustaining a Colles' fracture is about 16% for white women. By the time women reach age 70, about 20% have had at least one wrist fracture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/diseasemodules/osteoporosis/epidemiology.jsp |title=MerckMedicus Modules: Osteoporosis – Epidemiology |accessdate=2008-06-13 |publisher=Merck & Co., Inc |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071228030929/http://www.merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/diseasemodules/osteoporosis/epidemiology.jsp |archivedate = 2007-12-28[/tpl]

===Rib fractures===

Fragility fractures of the ribs are common in men as young as age 35. These are often overlooked as signs of osteoporosis, as these men are often physically active and suffer the fracture in the course of physical activity. An example would be as a result of falling while water skiing or jet skiing. However, a quick test of the individual's testosterone level following the diagnosis of the fracture will readily reveal whether that individual might be at risk.

==History==

The link between age-related reductions in bone density and fracture risk goes back at least to Astley Cooper, and the term "osteoporosis" and recognition of its pathological appearance is generally attributed to the French pathologist Jean Lobstein.Lobstein JGCFM. Lehrbuch der pathologischen Anatomie. Stuttgart: Bd II, 1835. The American endocrinologist Fuller Albright linked osteoporosis with the postmenopausal state.[tpl]cite journal | author=Albright F, Bloomberg E, Smith PH |year=1940 |title= Postmenopausal osteoporosis |journal=Trans. Assoc. Am. Physicians. |volume=55 |pages=298–305[/tpl] Bisphosponates, which revolutionized the treatment of osteoporosis, were discovered in the 1960s.[tpl]cite journal |author=Patlak M |title=Bone builders: the discoveries behind preventing and treating osteoporosis |journal=FASEB J. |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1677E–E |year=2001 |pmid=11481214 |doi= 10.1096/fj.15.10.1677e[/tpl]
