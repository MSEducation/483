Hong Kong became a colony of the British Empire after the First Opium War (1839–42). Hong Kong Island was first ceded to the UK in perpetuity, followed by  Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and then the New Territories was put under lease in 1898. It was occupied by Japan during the Pacific War (1941–45), after which the British resumed control until 1997, when China resumed sovereignty.[tpl]cite web|title=Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong|date=19 December 1984|quote=The Government of the People's Republic of China declares that to recover the Hong Kong area (including Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories, hereinafter referred to as Hong Kong) is the common aspiration of the entire Chinese people, and that it has decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong with effect from 1 July 1997.|url=http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm|publisher=Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, Hong Kong Government|postscript=|accessdate=4 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/1/newsid_2656000/2656973.stm|title=On This Day: 1997: Hong Kong handed over to Chinese control|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 September 2008|date=1 July 1997[/tpl] The region espoused minimum government intervention under the ethos of positive non-interventionism during the colonial era.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/32970596?slide=14|title=The World's Most Competitive Financial Centers|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=30 October 2009 [/tpl] The time period greatly influenced the current culture of Hong Kong, often described as "East meets West", and the educational system, which used to loosely follow the system in England until reforms implemented in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/index.aspx?nodeID=2063&langno=1 |title=Programme Highlights|work=Hong Kong Government|accessdate=20 October 2010[/tpl]
On 1 July 1997, Hong Kong became the first Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, under the principle of "one country, two systems" (the other, Macau, attained that status in December 1999).
It has a different political system from mainland China.[tpl]cite book|last=So|first=Dudley L.|last2=Lin|first2=Nan|last3=Poston|year=2001|title=The Chinese Triangle of Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|pages=13–29|isbn=0-313-30869-1[/tpl] Hong Kong's independent judiciary functions under the common law framework.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html#section_4|title=Basic Law, Chapter IV, Section 4|publisher=Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee|accessdate=10 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Russell|first=Peter H.|first2=David M.|last2=O'Brien|title=Judicial Independence in the Age of Democracy: Critical Perspectives from around the World|year=2001|publisher=University of Virginia Press|isbn=978-0-8139-2016-0|page=306[/tpl] Hong Kong Basic Law, its constitutional document, which stipulates that Hong Kong shall have a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign relations and military defence, governs its political system.[tpl]cite book|last=Ghai|first=Yash P.|title=Autonomy and Ethnicity: Negotiating Competing Claims in Multi-ethnic States|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78642-3|pages=92–97[/tpl] Although it has a burgeoning multi-party system, a small-circle electorate controls half of its legislature.

Hong Kong is a world city. It is one of the Al­pha+ cities. Also, a Time Magazine article in 2008 coined the phrase "Nylonkong", which referred to New York City, London and Hong Kong, that these three cities form a global network that facilitates the global economy. As Hong Kong ranks the third most important leading international financial centre, after London and New York City, Hong Kong has a major capitalist service economy characterised by low taxation and free trade, and the currency, Hong Kong dollar, is the eighth most traded currency in the world.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.bis.org/publ/rpfxf10t.pdf|title=Triennial Central Bank Survey: Report on global foreign exchange market activity in 2010|date=December 2010|work=Monetary and Economic Department|page=12|publisher=Bank for International Settlements|accessdate=15 October 2011[/tpl] The lack of space caused demand for denser constructions, which developed the city to a centre for modern architecture and the world's most vertical city. Hong Kong has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.[ref]
