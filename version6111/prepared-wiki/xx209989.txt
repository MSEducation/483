DeWitt Clinton Park is a [tpl]convert|5.8|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] New York City public park in the Hell's Kitchen, New York neighborhood between West 52nd Street and 54th Street (Manhattan) and Eleventh Avenue (Manhattan) and the West Side Highway in Manhattan.
The park which was one of the first New York City parks in Manhattan on the working waterfront of the Hudson River is named for DeWitt Clinton who had created a business boom of Hudson commerce when he opened the Erie Canal.
It is the biggest New York City park in the neighborhood and since 1959 the neighborhood has frequently been referred to as "Clinton."  It is the only park on the west side of Manhattan to have lighted ball fields.
The park was the first community garden in New York City.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=6395 |title=Erie Canal Playground - Historical Sign |publisher=New York City Department of Parks & Recreation |accessdate=2010-03-05[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Shaw |first=Albert |title=The American Monthly Review of Reviews |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Jr8CAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA440 |accessdate=2010-03-05 |volume=29 |date=January–June 1904 |publisher=The Review of Reviews Company |location=New York |page=440[/tpl]

==Design==

The park's original 1901 design by Samuel Parsons Jr. encompassed a bigger park that was much less developed than the current park.  The park was dramatically altered by the construction of the New York Passenger Ship Terminal on its west side.  Since Navy requirements set length limits on piers, the city was able to lengthen the piers by removing land from Manhattan so that longer piers could be built that would not extend beyond the Navy limits.
In the shrinking of land, a [tpl]convert|250|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] wide swath on the west of the park was removed in the 1930s for the Terminal and West Side Elevated Highway.

The park's unobstructed views of the Hudson River and New Jersey Palisades have been affected by the construction of the New York Passenger Terminal (although a sidewalk along a sycamore lined curved path on the west side side is a popular vantage point for viewing cruise ships at the terminal).  The children's garden was removed in 1932.  The undulating lawn, music stands, and lengthy arbor have been removed.  In their place is a fenced in lighted area for three baseball fields,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/DeWittClintonPark/facilities/baseball |title=De Witt Clinton Park Facilities - Baseball Fields |publisher=New York City Department of Parks & Recreation |accessdate=2010-03-05[/tpl] an asphalt basketball and handball courts and a children's playground as well as a dog park.

==History==

The land for the park was part of the Striker and Hopper homestead farms which had been in those families for more than 200 years.  The home of General Garrit Hopper Striker built in 1752 had been torn down in 1895.  Another farmhouse called the Mott farmhouse built in 1796 on 54th Street was torn down in 1896.  The city announced plans to purchase the land (called "Sriker's Lane") in 1896.[tpl]cite news |title=West Side Park Among Tenements |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F03E3D91439E133A25751C0A9669D946095D6CF |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 2, 1921 |accessdate=2010-03-05[/tpl]
Other buildings on the site were torn down in 1902 and a tent was placed on the site in 1903.  In 1906 the hilly terrain was graded at a cost of $200,000.  At the same time the De Witt Clinton High School opened nearby on Tenth Avenue.
The park was designed by Samuel Parsons, Jr. and was originally  [tpl]convert|7.4|acre|m2[/tpl] and stretched nearly to the Hudson River.  It featured a recreation/bathing pavilion, gymnasium, running track, playgrounds, and a series of curving paths with viewing desks of the Hudson River and the Palisades. The park’s centerpiece was a children’s farm garden, which operated from 1902 to 1932. 
The farm which was the first of its kind in New York City was championed by Frances Griscom Parsons (no relation to the landscaper Samuel Parsons).
It featured flower beds, observation plots, a pergola, and 356 4' x 8' vegetable gardens each assigned to a “little farmer.” 
The Atlantic Monthly describe the spot as it was about to be rehabilitated:
