Other teams, however, had more serious interest in signing a black ballplayer. In the mid-1940s, Branch Rickey, club president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began to scout the Negro leagues for a possible addition to the Dodgers' roster. Rickey selected Robinson from a list of promising black players and interviewed him for possible assignment to Brooklyn's International League farm club, the Montreal Royals.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/general/povich/launch/jackier.htm |title=The Ball Stayed White, but the Game Did Not |accessdate=October 12, 2008 |last=Povich |first=Shirley |date=March 28, 1997 |work=The Washington Post[/tpl] Rickey was especially interested in making sure his eventual signee could withstand the inevitable racial abuse that would be directed at him.[tpl]cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016431.html |title=Jackie changed face of sports |accessdate=September 25, 2009 |last=Schwartz |first=Larry |year=2007 |publisher=ESPN[/tpl] In a famous three-hour exchange on August 28, 1945, Rickey asked Robinson if he could face the racial animus without taking the bait and reacting angrily—a concern given Robinson's prior arguments with law enforcement officials at PJC and in the military. Robinson was aghast: "Are you looking for a Negro who is afraid to fight back?" Rickey replied that he needed a Negro player "with guts enough not to fight back."Robinson, Jackie, p. 33. After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to "turn the other cheek" to racial antagonism, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month, equal to $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|600|1945[/tpl][/tpl] today.Rampersad, p. 127.Robinson, Jackie, p. 34.

Although he required Robinson to keep the arrangement a secret for the time being, Rickey committed to formally signing Robinson before November 1, 1945.Rampersad, pp. 127–128. On October 23, it was publicly announced that Robinson would be assigned to the Royals for the 1946 season.Lamb, p. 43. On the same day, with representatives of the Royals and Dodgers present, Robinson formally signed his contract with the Royals.Rampersad, p. 129.

The best was Josh Gibson. I think that's one of the reason why Josh died so early - he was heartbroken."
Rickey's offer allowed Robinson to leave behind the Monarchs and their grueling bus rides, and he went home to Pasadena.
That September, he signed with Chet Brewer's Kansas City Royals, a post-season barnstorming team in the California Winter League.Tygiel (2002), p. 28. Later that off-season, he briefly toured South America with another barnstorming team, while his fiancée Isum pursued nursing opportunities in New York City.Robinson, Jackie, p. 37. On February 10, 1946, Robinson and Isum were married by their old friend, the Rev. Karl Downs.Linge, p. 49.Robinson, Jackie, p. 38.

===Minor leagues===

In 1946, Robinson arrived at Daytona Beach, Florida, for spring training with the Montreal Royals of the Class AAA International League (the designation of "AAA" for the highest level of minor league baseball was first used in the [tpl]by|1946[/tpl] season). Clay Hopper, the manager of the Royals, asked Rickey to assign Robinson to any other Dodger affiliate, but Rickey refused.[tpl]cite web|last=Lamb |first=Chris |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/sports/Opinion+redemption+Clay+Hopper/8196800/story.html |title=Opinion: The redemption of Clay Hopper |publisher=Montreal Gazette |date=April 7, 2013 |accessdate=April 13, 2013[/tpl]
Robinson's presence was controversial in racially charged Florida. As he was not allowed to stay with his teammates at the team hotel, he lodged instead at the home of a local black politician.Lamb, p. 93.Robinson, Jackie, p. 41. Since the Dodgers organization did not own a spring training facility (the Dodger-controlled spring training compound in Vero Beach known as "Dodgertown" did not open until spring 1948),McNeil, pp. 358–359. scheduling was subject to the whim of area localities, several of which turned down any event involving Robinson or Johnny Wright, another black player whom Rickey had signed to the Dodgers' organization in January. In Sanford, Florida, the police chief threatened to cancel games if Robinson and Wright did not cease training activities there; as a result, Robinson was sent back to Daytona Beach.Lamb, p. 88.Robinson, Jackie, pp. 42–43.

After much lobbying of local officials by Rickey himself, the Royals were allowed to host a game involving Robinson in Daytona Beach.Lamb, p. 104.Robinson, Jackie, p. 45. Robinson made his Royals debut at Daytona Beach's City Island Ballpark on March 17, 1946, in an exhibition game against the team's parent club, the Dodgers. Robinson thus became the first black player to openly play for a minor league team against a major league team since the de facto baseball color line had been implemented in the 1880s.[tpl]cite book |title=Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong |last=Loewen |first=James W. |year=1995 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=1-56584-100-X |page=163 [/tpl] Later in spring training, after some less-than-stellar performances, Robinson was shifted from shortstop to second base, allowing him to make shorter throws to first base.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,933586,00.html |title=Jackie Makes Good |accessdate=October 12, 2008 |date=August 26, 1946 |work=Time[/tpl] Robinson's performance soon rebounded. On April 18, 1946, Roosevelt Stadium hosted the Jersey City Giants' season opener against the Montreal Royals, marking the professional debut of the Royals' Jackie Robinson and the first time the color barrier had been broken in a game between two minor league clubs.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=FV0uF_RwC00C&pg=PA15|title=The Negro Leagues in New Jersey: A History|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|location=Jefferson, NC|year=2008|last1=Martin|first1=Alfred M.|last2=Martin|first2=Alfred T.|page=15|isbn=9780786439003[/tpl] Pitching against Robinson was Warren Sandel who had played against him when they both lived in California. During Robinson's first at bat, the Jersey City catcher, Dick Bouknight, demanded that Sandel throw at Robinson, but Sandel refused. Although Sandel induced Robinson to ground out at his first at bat, in his five trips to the plate, Robinson ended up with four hits, including his first hit, a three-run home run, in the game's third inning.Van Blair, Rick (1994) Dugout to Foxhole: Interviews with Baseball Players Whose Careers Were Affected by World War II. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, pages 180-191  He also scored four runs, drove in three, and stole two bases in the Royals' 14–1 victory.Tygiel (1983), pp. 3, 7  Robinson proceeded to lead the International League that season with a .349 batting average and .985 fielding percentage, and he was named the league's Most Valuable Player.Simon, p. 97. Although he often faced hostility while on road trips (the Royals were forced to cancel a Southern exhibition tour, for example), the Montreal fan base enthusiastically supported Robinson.Linge, p. 54.[tpl]cite news|title=US to honor Robinson's Montreal home|date=February 27, 2011|agency=Associated Press|work=FOXSports.com|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/United-States-to-honor-Jackie-Robinsons-Montreal-apartment-022711|accessdate=2011-02-27|quote=... the apartment the couple called home in the summer of 1946.[/tpl] Whether fans supported or opposed it, Robinson's presence on the field was a boon to attendance; more than one million people went to games involving Robinson in 1946, an amazing figure by International League standards.[tpl]cite web |url=http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&bid=2379&pid=12074 |title=SABR Biography of Jackie Robinson |publisher=Society for American Baseball Research |accessdate=May 27, 2009 |first=Rick |last=Swaine[/tpl] In the fall of 1946, following the baseball season, Robinson returned home to California and briefly played professional basketball for the short-lived Los Angeles Red Devils.Tygiel, pp. 163–164.Rampersad, pp. 158–159.

===Major leagues===

====Breaking the color barrier (1947)====

The following year, six days before the start of the 1947 season, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues. With Eddie Stanky entrenched at second base for the Dodgers, Robinson played his initial major league season as a first baseman. On April 15, 1947, Robinson made his major league debut at age 28 at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, including more than 14,000 black patrons. Although he failed to get a base hit, he walked and scored a run in the Dodgers' 5-3 victory.McNeil, p. 357. Robinson became the first player since 1880 to openly break the major league baseball color line.[tpl]cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Ethnicity and Sports in the United States|author=Kirsch, George B., Othello Harris, and Claire Elaine Nolte, eds.|year=2000 |isbn=0-313-29911-0 |publisher=Greenwood|location=Westport, CT |pages=12, 336|chapter=The Right to Travel[/tpl]  Black fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning their Negro league teams.
Robinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and white major league players.For a general survey of the media reaction to Robinson at various phases of his career, see www.umass.edu and subpages. Retrieved on July 8, 2009. However, racial tension existed in the Dodger clubhouse.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/jackie-robinson-breaks-color-barrier |title=Jackie Robinson breaks major league color barrier |accessdate=October 21, 2011 |publisher=History Channel [/tpl] Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson. The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager Leo Durocher informed the team, "I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded."Kirwin, p. 198.
Robinson was also derided by opposing teams. Some, notably the St. Louis Cardinals, threatened to strike if Robinson played. After the threat, National League President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler let it be known that any striking players would be suspended.Kirwin, p. 199.Eig, p. 95.Bryant, p. 70. Robinson nonetheless became the target of rough physical play by opponents (particularly the Cardinals). At one time, he received a seven-inch gash in his leg from Enos Slaughter.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_jackie.html |title=Jackie Robinson integrates Baseball |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |last=Wormser |first=Richard |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |year=2002 [/tpl] On April 22, 1947, during a game between the Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies, Phillies players and manager Ben Chapman called Robinson a "nigger" from their dugout and yelled that he should "go back to the cotton fields".Williams, p. 9.[tpl]cite video |people=Burns, Ken (writer and director) |date=1994 |title=Baseball, Part 6 |medium=Television production |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |time=minute 120 [/tpl] Rickey later recalled that Chapman "did more than anybody to unite the Dodgers.

Robinson did, however, receive significant encouragement from several major league players. Dodgers teammate Pee Wee Reese once came to Robinson's defense with the famous line, "You can hate a man for many reasons. Color is not one of them."[tpl]cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070412&content_id=1895445&vkey=perspectives&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=1947: A time for change |accessdate=September 12, 2009 |last=Newman |first=Mark |date=April 13, 2007 |publisher=MLB.com [/tpl] In 1948, Reese put his arm around Robinson in response to fans who shouted racial slurs at Robinson before a game in Cincinnati.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-04-24/news/debunkers-strike-out/ |title=Debunkers Strike Out |accessdate=October 11, 2008 |last=Barra |first=Allen |date=April 24, 2007 |work=The Village Voice[/tpl] A statue by sculptor William Behrends, unveiled at KeySpan Park on November 1, 2005, commemorates this event by representing Reese with his arm around Robinson.[tpl]cite news |title=From Clay to Bronze to the Hall |last=Sandomir |first=Richard |date=June 1, 2008 |work=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/sports/baseball/01oneil.html |accessdate=July 12, 2009[/tpl] Jewish baseball star Hank Greenberg, who had to deal with racial epithets during his career, also encouraged Robinson. Following an incident where Greenberg collided with Robinson at first base, he "whispered a few words into Robinson's ear", which Robinson later characterized as "words of encouragement." Greenberg had advised him to overcome his critics by defeating them in games.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2000/01/12/2000-01-12a_home_run.html |title='Greenberg' A Home Run |accessdate=October 12, 2008 |last=Mathews |first=Jack |date=January 12, 2000 |work=New York Daily News |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100706072855/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2000/01/12/2000-01-12a_home_run.html |archivedate=July 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] Robinson also talked frequently with Larry Doby, who endured his own hardships since becoming the first black player in the American League with the Cleveland Indians, as the two spoke to one another via telephone throughout the season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.courant.com/1997-04-15/sports/9704150685_1_larry-doby-jackie-robinson-modern-major-leagues|publisher=Hartford Courant|date=15 April 1997|last=Amore|first=Dom|accessdate=30 July 2012|title=Larry Doby Remembers Being Introduced To[/tpl]
Robinson finished the season having played in 151 games for the Dodgers, with a batting average of .297, an on-base percentage of .383, and a .427 slugging percentage.  He had 175 hits (scoring 125 runs) including 31 doubles, 5 triples, 12 home runs, driving in 48 runs for the year. Robinson led the league in sacrifice hits, with 28, and in stolen bases, with 29.Eig, p. 224. His cumulative performance earned him the inaugural Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award (separate National and American League Rookie of the Year honors were not awarded until 1949).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mlb.com/mlb/awards/mlb_awards_content.jsp?content=roy_history |title=Rookies of the Year |publisher=MLB.com |accessdate=July 15, 2009[/tpl]

====MVP, Congressional testimony, and film biography (1948–1950)====

Following Stanky's trade to the Boston Braves in March 1948, Robinson took over second base, where he logged a .980 fielding percentage that year (second in the National League at the position, fractionally behind Stanky).McNeil, p. 94.

Racial pressure on Robinson eased in 1948 as a number of other black players entered the major leagues. Larry Doby (who broke the color barrier in the American League on July 5, 1947, just 11 weeks after Robinson) and Satchel Paige played for the Cleveland Indians, and the Dodgers had three other black players besides Robinson. In February 1948, he signed a $12,500 contract (equal to $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|12500|1948[/tpl][/tpl] today) with the Dodgers; while a significant amount, this was less than Robinson made in the off-season from a vaudeville tour, where he answered pre-set baseball questions, and a speaking tour of the South. Between the tours, he underwent surgery on his right ankle. Because of his off-season activities, Robinson reported to training camp [tpl]Convert|30|lb|kg[/tpl] overweight. He lost the weight during training camp, but dieting left him weak at the plate.Linge, pp. 71–72.
In the spring of 1949, Robinson turned to Hall of Famer George Sisler, working as an advisor to the Dodgers, for batting help. At Sisler's suggestion, Robinson spent hours at a batting tee, learning to hit the ball to right field. Sisler taught Robinson to anticipate a fastball, on the theory that it is easier to subsequently adjust to a slower curveball. Robinson also noted that "Sisler showed me how to stop lunging, how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second". The tutelage helped Robinson raise his batting average from .296 in 1948 to .342 in 1949.[tpl]cite book |title=The Sizzler: George Sisler, Baseball's Forgotten Great |last=Huhn |first=Rick |year=2004 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |location=Columbia |isbn=0-8262-1555-6 |chapter=Full circle |page=260 [/tpl] In addition to his improved batting average, Robinson stole 37 bases that season, was second place in the league for both doubles and triples, and registered 124 runs batted in with 122 runs scored. For the performance Robinson earned the Most Valuable Player Award for the National League. Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 All-Star Game—the first All-Star Game to include black players.In addition to Robinson, the 1949 All-Star game featured Larry Doby, Roy Campanella, and Don Newcombe.

Summer 1949 brought an unwanted distraction for Robinson. In July, he was called to testify before the United States House of Representatives' Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) concerning statements made that April by black athlete and actor Paul Robeson. Robinson was reluctant to testify, but he eventually agreed to do so, fearing it might negatively affect his career if he declined.[tpl]cite book |title=Paul Robeson |last=Duberman |first=Martin |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-394-52780-2 |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |pages=361–362 |chapter=The Right to Travel[/tpl]
In 1950, Robinson led the National League in double plays made by a second baseman with 133.

Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not sit well with Dodgers co-owner Walter O'Malley, who referred to Robinson as "Rickey's prima donna".Stout, p. 160. In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the franchise.Stout, p. 162. Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, "Regardless of what happens to me in the future, it all can be placed on what you have done and, believe me, I appreciate it."Long, p. 7.[tpl]cite book |author=Robinson, Jackie |year=1950 |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/robinson/jaraglet.html |title=Letter to Branch Rickey |publisher= Library of Congress |accessdate=September 12, 2009[/tpl]

====Pennant races and outside interests (1951–1953)====

Before the 1951 season, O'Malley reportedly offered Robinson the job of manager of the Montreal Royals, effective at the end of Robinson's playing career.

During the 1951 season, Robinson led the National League in double plays made by a second baseman for the second year in a row, with 137. He also kept the Dodgers in contention for the 1951 pennant.  During the last game of the regular season, in the 13th inning, he had a hit to tie the game, and then won the game with a home run in the 14th.  This forced a 3 out of 5 playoff series against the crosstown rival New York Giants.[tpl]cite book|last=Bitker|first=Steve|title=The Original San Francisco Giants: The Giants of '58|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2001|page=196|isbn=978-1-58261-335-2[/tpl]
Despite Robinson's regular-season heroics, the Dodgers lost the pennant on Bobby Thomson's famous home run, known as the Shot Heard 'Round the World, on October 3, 1951. Overcoming his dejection, Robinson dutifully observed Thomson's feet to ensure he touched all the bases. Dodgers sportscaster Vin Scully later noted that the incident showed "how much of a competitor Robinson was."[tpl]cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/mlb/y2007/m04/d12/c1895331.jsp |title=Robinson made impact on field, too |accessdate=October 11, 2008 |last=Bloom |first=Barry |date=April 13, 2007 |publisher=MLB.com[/tpl] He finished the season with 106 runs scored, a batting average of .335, and 25 stolen bases.
Robinson had what was an average year for him in 1952.[tpl]cite book |chapter=Jackie Robinson and the Third Age of Modern Baseball |last=Shiner |first=David |title=Jackie Robinson: Race, Sports, and the American Dream |page=154 [/tpl] He finished the year with 104 runs, a .308 batting average, and 24 stolen bases. He did, however, record a career-high on-base percentage of .436. The Dodgers improved on their performance from the year before, winning the National League pennant before losing the 1952 World Series to the New York Yankees in seven games. That year, on the television show Youth Wants to Know, Robinson challenged the Yankees' general manager, George Weiss, on the racial record of his team, which had yet to sign a black player.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/04/13/1997-04-13_the_legacy__race_through_time.html |title=The Legacy of Race Through Time |accessdate=October 28, 2008 |date=April 13, 1997 |work=New York Daily News |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100408185940/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/04/13/1997-04-13_the_legacy__race_through_time.html |archivedate=April 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] Sportswriter Dick Young, whom Robinson had described as a "bigot", said, "If there was one flaw in Jackie, it was the common one. He believed that everything unpleasant that happened to him happened because of his blackness."Falkner, p. 213. The 1952 season was the last year Robinson was an everyday starter at second base. Afterward, Robinson played variously at first, second, and third bases, shortstop, and in the outfield, with Jim Gilliam, another black player, taking over everyday second base duties. Robinson's interests began to shift toward the prospect of managing a major league team. He had hoped to gain experience by managing in the Puerto Rican Winter League, but according to the New York Post, Commissioner Happy Chandler denied the request.Tygiel (2002), p. 34.
In 1953, Robinson had 109 runs, a .329 batting average, and 17 steals, leading the Dodgers to another National League pennant (and another World Series loss to the Yankees, this time in six games). Robinson's continued success spawned a string of death threats.Long, pp. 10–11. He was not dissuaded, however, from addressing racial issues publicly. That year, he served as editor for Our Sports magazine, a periodical focusing on Negro sports issues; contributions to the magazine included an article on golf course segregation by Robinson's old friend Joe Louis.[tpl]cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/learn//collections/jr/history.html |title=Jackie Robinson and baseball highlights, 1860s–1960s |accessdate=September 13, 2009 |date=September 26, 2002 |publisher=Library of Congress |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090810071209/http://memory.loc.gov/learn//collections/jr/history.html |archivedate=August 10, 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/robinson/jr1947.html |title=Robinson as a Dodger: 1947–1956 |work=Baseball, the Color Line, and Jackie Robinson |accessdate=September 12, 2009 |publisher=Library of Congress [/tpl] Robinson also openly criticized segregated hotels and restaurants that served the Dodger organization; a number of these establishments integrated as a result, including the five-star Chase Park Hotel in St. Louis.[tpl]cite book |title=What I Learned from Jackie Robinson: A Teammate's Reflections On and Off the Field |author=Erskine, Carl with Burton Rocks |chapter=Wait Till Next Year |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=0-07-145085-8 |pages=61–74 [/tpl]

====World Championship and retirement (1954–1956)====

In 1954, Robinson had 62 runs, a .311 batting average, and 7 steals. His best day at the plate was on June 17, when he hit two home runs and two doubles. The following autumn, Robinson won his only championship when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in the 1955 World Series. Although the team enjoyed ultimate success, 1955 was the worst year of Robinson's individual career. He hit .256 and stole only 12 bases. The Dodgers tried Robinson in the outfield and as a third baseman, both because of his diminishing abilities and because Gilliam was established at second base.Eig, p. 269. Robinson, then 37 years old, missed 49 games and did not play in Game 7 of the World Series. Robinson missed the game because manager Walter Alston decided to play Gilliam at second and Don Hoak at third base. That season, the Dodgers' Don Newcombe became the first black major league pitcher to win twenty games in a year.Nemec & Flatow, p. 198.
In 1956, Robinson had 61 runs, a .275 batting average, and 12 steals. By then, he had begun to exhibit the effects of diabetes, and to lose interest in the prospect of playing or managing professional baseball. After the season, Robinson was traded by the Dodgers to the arch-rival New York Giants for Dick Littlefield and $35,000 cash (equal to $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|35000|1956[/tpl][/tpl] today). The trade, however, was never completed; unbeknownst to the Dodgers, Robinson had already agreed with the president of Chock full o'Nuts to quit baseball and become an executive with the company.Linge, p. 114. Since Robinson had sold exclusive rights to any retirement story to Look magazine two years previously, his retirement decision was revealed through the magazine, instead of through the Dodgers organization.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070603&content_id=2003372&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Jackie Robinson: Gone but not forgotten |accessdate=October 11, 2008 |last=Bloom |first=Barry |date=June 4, 2007 |publisher=MLB.com[/tpl]

==Legacy==

Robinson's major league debut brought an end to approximately sixty years of segregation in professional baseball, known as the baseball color line. After World War II, several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks, including their accelerated migration to the North, where their political clout grew, and President Harry Truman's desegregation of the military in 1948.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/17/opinion/better-late-than-never.html|title=Better Late Than Never|last=Klarman|first=Michael J. |date=May 17, 2004|work=New York Times|accessdate=September 16, 2009[/tpl] Robinson's breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter. Martin Luther King, Jr. said that he was "a legend and a symbol in his own time", and that he "challenged the dark skies of intolerance and frustration."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/03/02/a_pioneer_in_civil_rights/|title=A pioneer in civil rights|last=Robinson|first=Rachel|coauthors=John Kerry|date=March 2, 2005|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=September 16, 2009[/tpl] According to historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, Robinson's "efforts were a monumental step in the civil-rights revolution in America ...

Beginning his major league career at the relatively advanced age of twenty-eight, he played only ten seasons from 1947 to 1956, all of them for the Brooklyn Dodgers. During his career, the Dodgers played in six World Series, and Robinson himself played in six All-Star Games.  In 1999, he was posthumously named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp?story=2|title=The All-Century Team|year=1999|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=September 16, 2009[/tpl]
Robinson's career is generally considered to mark the beginning of the post–"long ball" era in baseball, in which a reliance on raw power-hitting gave way to balanced offensive strategies that used footspeed to create runs through aggressive baserunning.[tpl]cite book |chapter=Jackie Robinson and the Third Age of Modern Baseball |last=Shiner |first=David |title=Jackie Robinson: Race, Sports, and the American Dream |pages=151–152 [/tpl] Robinson exhibited the combination of hitting ability and speed which exemplified the new era. He scored more than 100 runs in six of his ten seasons (averaging more than 110 runs from 1947 to 1953), had a .311 career batting average, a .409 career on-base percentage, a .474 slugging percentage, and substantially more walks than strikeouts (740 to 291).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/sports2000/numbers/170132.html |title=The No. 1 Most Significant Development in the 20th Century |accessdate=October 31, 2008 |last=Kindred |first=Dave |date=July 1999 |work=The Sporting News |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080821135309/http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/sports2000/numbers/170132.html |archivedate=August 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1783632 |title=Remembering Jackie Robinson |accessdate=October 31, 2008 |last=Simon |first=Mark |publisher=ESPN[/tpl] Robinson was one of only two players during the span of 1947–56 to accumulate at least 125 steals while registering a slugging percentage over .425 (Minnie Miñoso was the other).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/04/19/SP68618.DTL |title=By The Numbers -- Robinson Was All-Around Player |work=San Francisco Chronicle |last=Camps |first=Mark |date=April 7, 1997 |accessdate=July 12, 2009 [/tpl] He accumulated 197 stolen bases in total, including 19 steals of home.

Assessing himself, Robinson said, "I'm not concerned with your liking or disliking me ... all I ask is that you respect me as a human being." Regarding Robinson's qualities on the field, Leo Durocher said, "Ya want a guy that comes to play. This guy didn't just come to play. He come to beat ya.

Although Robinson adopted an insulin injection regimen, the state of medicine at the time could not prevent continued deterioration of Robinson's physical condition from the disease.Rampersad, p. 320.
In his first year of eligibility for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962, Robinson encouraged voters to consider only his on-field qualifications, rather than his cultural impact on the game.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=mlb&id=3460774&campaign=rsssrch&source=dodgers |title=Robinson honored with new Hall of Fame plaque |accessdate=October 31, 2008 |date=June 25, 2008 |publisher=ESPN[/tpl] He was elected on the first ballot, becoming the first black player inducted into the Cooperstown museum.

Robinson also chaired the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP) million-dollar Freedom Fund Drive in 1957, and served on the organization's board until 1967. In 1964, he helped found, with Harlem businessman Dunbar McLaurin, Freedom National Bank—a black-owned and operated commercial bank based in Harlem.[tpl]cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/robinson/jr1957.html |title=Robinson's later career: 1957–1972 |work=Baseball, the Color Line, and Jackie Robinson |accessdate=September 12, 2009 |publisher=Library of Congress [/tpl] He also served as the bank's first Chairman of the Board.Robinson, Rachel, p. 190.

Robinson was active in politics throughout his post-baseball life. He identified himself as a political independent,Robinson, p. 139.Long, p. 43. although he held conservative opinions on several issues, including the Vietnam War (he once wrote Martin Luther King, Jr. to defend the Johnson Administration's military policy).Long, pp. 255–257. After supporting Richard Nixon in his 1960 presidential race against John F. Kennedy, Robinson later praised Kennedy effusively for his stance on civil rights.Long, pp. 171–172. Robinson was angered by conservative Republican opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He became one of six national directors for Nelson Rockefeller's unsuccessful campaign to be nominated as the Republican candidate for the 1964 presidential election.  After the party nominated Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona instead, Robinson left the party's convention commenting that he now had "a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a Jew in Hitler's Germany".[tpl]cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Cheryl Lynn|title=Troubling the Waters: Black-Jewish Relations in the American Century|page=235|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-691-14616-4[/tpl] He later became special assistant for community affairs when Rockefeller was re-elected governor of New York in 1966. Switching his allegiance to the Democrats, he subsequently supported Hubert Humphrey against Nixon in 1968.

Robinson did not long outlive his son. Complications of heart disease and diabetes weakened Robinson and made him almost blind by middle age. On October 24, 1972, he died of a heart attack in his home at 95 Cascade Road in North Stamford, Connecticut, aged 53. Robinson's funeral service on October 27, 1972, at Upper Manhattan's Riverside Church adjacent to Grant's Tomb in Morningside Heights attracted 2,500 mourners.Linge, p. 149. Many of his former teammates and other famous baseball players served as pallbearers, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson gave the eulogy. Tens of thousands of people lined the subsequent procession route to Robinson's interment site at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, where he is buried next to his son Jackie and mother-in-law Zellee Isum.
