Öre ([tpl]IPA-sv|øːrɛ|pronounced[/tpl]) is the discontinued centesimal subdivision of the Swedish krona. The plural and singular are the same in the indefinite forms, whereas the singular definite form is öret and the plural definite is örena. The name derives from the Latin aureus (gold), the name of a coin worth 25 denarii.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] The corresponding subdivisions of the Norwegian and Danish krones are called øre.
After 1991, the only coin in use with a value below 1 kr was the 50 öre coin. On 18 December 2008, the Swedish Riksbank announced a recommendation to the Swedish government to phase out the final öre coin by 2010.The Local.

During the Middle Ages, the öre was a unit of Swedish currency equal to 1/8 of a mark, 3 örtugar or either 24, 36 or 48 penningar (depending on the geographical area in which it was used). It was used as a counting unit for currency already in the 11th century, but was not minted until 1522. This öre was withdrawn in 1776, but returned in 1855 as 1/100 of the riksdaler. The riksdaler was replaced by the krona in 1873 (one riksdaler equalling one krona in the exchange), but öre remained the name of the subdivision of the currency.
