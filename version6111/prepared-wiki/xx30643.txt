Johns Frederick (Jeff) Rulifson (born August 20, 1941) is an American computer scientist.

==Early life and education==

Johns Frederick Rulifson was born August 20, 1941 in Bellefontaine, Ohio. His father was Erwin Charles Rulifson and mother was Virginia Helen Johns. He married Janet Irving on June 8, 1963 and had two children.[tpl]cite web |title= Johns Frederick (Jeff) Rulifson |work= Biographical Sketches |publisher=Stanford University |date= November 9, 1996 |url= http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/JeffRulifson/jfr.html |accessdate= April 15, 2011 [/tpl]
Rulifson graduated with a BS in mathematics from the University of Washington in 1966.

==Career==

Rulifson joined the Augmentation Research Center, at the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) in 1966.
He led the software team that implemented the oN-Line System (NLS), a system that foreshadowed many future developments in modern computing and networking.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.sri.com/about/alumni/alumni-hall-fame-2006#Rulifson|title=Johns Frederick (Jeff) Rulifson|work=SRI Hall of fame|publisher=SRI International|accessdate=2013-06-13[/tpl] Although Douglas Engelbart was the founder and leader of ARC, Rulifson's innovative programming was essential to the realization of Engelbart's vision.
Rulifson was SRI's representative to the "network working group" in 1968, which led to the first connection on the ARPANET.[tpl]citation |title= Host Software |author= Steve Crocker |work= RFC 1 |date= April 7, 1969|publisher= Network Working Group |accessdate= April 15, 2011 [/tpl] He described the Decode-Encode Language (DEL), which was designed to allow remote use of NLS over ARPANET.[tpl]citation |title= DEL |author= Jeff Rulifson |work= RFC 5 |date= June 2, 1969 |publisher= Network Working Group |accessdate= April 15, 2011 [/tpl] Although never used, the idea was small "programs" would be down-loaded to enhance user interaction. This concept was fully developed in Sun Microsystems's Java programming language almost 30 years later.[tpl]citation |title= 30 Years of RFCs |author= RFC Editor, et a. |work= RFC 2555 |date= April 7, 1999 |publisher= Network Working Group |accessdate= April 15, 2011 [/tpl]
Rulifson earned a doctorate in computer science from Stanford University in 1973.
Rulifson left SRI to join the System Sciences Laboratory (SSL) within Xerox PARC in 1973. While at PARC, he worked on implementing distributed office systems. He worked for ROLM in 1980 as an engineering manager. In 1985 he joined the company Syntelligence in Sunnyvale, California.
He worked for Sun Microsystems Laboratories, in Ivan Sutherland's lab since 1987. Sun was purchased by Oracle Corporation in 2010.

==Awards==

In 1990, Rulifson won the Association for Computing Machinery's Software System Award for implementing groundbreaking innovations such as hypertext, outline processors, and video conferencing.[tpl]cite web |title= 1990 â€“ Jeff Rulifson: NLS |work= Software system award citation |publisher= Association for Computing Machinery |url= http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=8204965&srt=all&aw=149&ao=SOFTWSYS&yr=1990 |accessdate= April 15, 2011 [/tpl]
In 1994, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.
