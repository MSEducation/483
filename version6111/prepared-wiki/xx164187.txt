==History==

Great Mall of the Great Plains was co-developed by Glimcher Realty Trust and Jordan Robert Perlmutter & Co. The mall was intended to feature a "value oriented megamall" with a mix of outlet stores, traditional mall stores, big box retail, and entertainment venues, comparable to malls developed by the former Mills Corporation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://retailtrafficmag.com/mag/retail_great_expectations/ |title=Great Expectations |accessdate=2007-08-17 |work=Retail Traffic Mag.com[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/1997/08/11/focus4.html |title=Work bustles at Great Mall of the Great Plains |accessdate=2007-08-17 |work=Bizjournals.com |first=Stephen |last=Roth |date=1997-08-10[/tpl] Construction began on the Great Mall of the Great Plains in 1996.[tpl]cite news |title=What's Happening at...

Originally scheduld to open in March 1997, the mall did not open until August 14 of that year, due to leasing issues.[tpl]cite news |title=Olathe mall's debut delayed The Great Mall of the Great Plains to open its [tpl]convert|1200000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of retail space in August. |work=Kansas City Star |page=B4 |date=1997-01-08 |accessdate=2007-08-17[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://columbus.bizjournals.com/columbus/stories/1997/08/18/story8.html?jst=cn_cn_lk |title=Great Mall project helps put Glimcher on national map |accessdate=2007-08-17 |work=BizJournals.com |first=Brian R. |last=Ball |date=1997-08-18[/tpl] Upon its opening, the mall had several anchor stores: Linens 'n Things, Burlington Coat Factory, Oshman's SuperSports USA, Marshalls, Group USA Clothing Company, Foozles Bookstore, and Dillard's clearance center. Other original features of the mall included a family entertainment center called Jeepers, later to become Zonkers. A food court, and a Dickinson movie theater also reside in the mall. Great Mall of the Great Plains opened with 150 stores laid out in a half-mile "racetrack" pattern. The mall was the largest outlet mall in the state of Kansas.

==Closures==

Despite a highly successful opening which attracted more than one-and-a-half million visitors, Great Mall of the Great Plains saw its success waning with time, due in part to a retail saturation in the market.[tpl]cite news |url=http://kansascity.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/1999/11/29/story3.html |title=Retailers say things aren't so great at Olathe's mall |accessdate=2007-08-17 |work=BizJournals.com |first=Amy |last=Trollinger |date=1999-11-28[/tpl]
Although Off 5th opened as an additional anchor store in 1999,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/10-19-1999/0001048366&EDATE= |title=OFF 5TH Saks Fifth Avenue Outlet Newest Anchor at Glimcher Realty Trust's The Great Mall of The Great Plains |accessdate=2007-08-17 |work=PRNewswire.com[/tpl] the mall lost three anchor stores soon afterward. Dillard's closed its clearance center in 2001, and was soon replaced with VF Outlet.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/2001/08/06/daily6.html |title=VF Factory Outlet will replace Dillard's at Great Mall |accessdate=2007-08-17 |work=BizJournals.com |first=Kansas |last=City |date=2001-08-06[/tpl] A year later, both Oshman's and Linens 'n Things closed as well, as did Off 5th. Marshalls also relocated to a nearby strip center in 2005,[tpl]cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmtkc/is_200603/ai_n16096154 |title=Cityscape: Great Mall's loss Olathe Pointe's gain |accessdate=2007-08-17 |work=FindArticles.com[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] while Steve & Barry's opened in 2005, and Famous Labels opened in 2007 but soon closed at the end of 2009. The food court now only has 4 restaurants in it. In early 2009, The Steve & Barry's closed as part of a national bankruptcy.
In an early 2008 Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Glimcher Realty Trust expressed a desire to sell the Great Mall of the Great Plains.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/2008/02/11/daily21.html |title=Owner wants to sell Great Mall in Olathe |accessdate=2008-02-11 |work=BizJournals.com |first=Kansas |last=City |date=2008-02-12[/tpl] On January 6, 2009, Glimcher sold the Great Mall of the Great Plains to focus on more valuable assets to Cecil Van Tuyl of the Van Tuyl Group. The mall is currently managed by MC Realty Group, LLC.
