[[TNT Sunday Night Football results (1990â€“1997)]]

CATEGORIES: Turner Sports, National Football League on television results, Sunday Night Football

This is a list of results of National Football League games played on Turner Network Television (TNT).  From 1990-1997, TNT broadcast NFL games on Sunday nights for the first half of the regular season (or nine games a year).  Meanwhile, ESPN would pick things up for the second half of the season.  TNT also got a couple of Thursday night games to show, which were aired in place of Sunday night games (that would have otherwise conflicted with the World Series; coincidentally, the [tpl]wsy|1991[/tpl], [tpl]wsy|1992[/tpl], [tpl]wsy|1995[/tpl], and [tpl]wsy|1996[/tpl] editions of the World Series featured the Turner-owned Atlanta Braves). Following the 1997 season, ESPN would broadcast Sunday night NFL games for the whole season.  This particular arrangement between ESPN and the National Football League would continue until the end of the 2005 season.  Since that time, NBC (who last broadcast NFL games the same year that TNT last broadcast them, 1997) has been the television home of Sunday night games.  Meanwhile, ESPN has replaced ABC as the broadcaster of Monday night games.
The Phoenix/Arizona Cardinals were the only team to appear on TNT every year of the run, as they had their home opener (and one additional game in 1994) aired on the network each year.
