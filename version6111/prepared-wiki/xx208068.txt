Andrei Oliver Bra≈üovean aka ATMA (born 20 August 1979 in Sibiu) is a Romanian composer, performer and electronic music producer.
Andrei Oliver Brasovean is one of the pioneers of electronic music in Eastern Europe.
Born in Sibiu (Romania) and now living in Germany, he started to produce electronic music in 1991. Few years later he focused his productions mostly on trance, techno, downtempo and epic music.
Known around the globe for his unique style, and with more than 20 years of electronic music production and hundreds of live performances, ATMA made his entrance between the most established names in the electronic music scene.
With his long musical background and the experience of working different musical styles he developed a totally unique style of electronic dance music. Deep melodies, perfect harmonies, psychedelic sounds and pumping basslines, it's his "new definition" of the trance dance music.
After the great success of his first two solo albums, Beyond Good & Evil (Geomagnetic.Tv)"Atma - Beyond Good & Evil" on Geomagnetic.Tv (USA) (26 November 2006) and The Secrets Of Meditation (Millennium Records)"Atma - The Secrets Of Meditation " on Y.S.E / Millennium Records (UK) (3 January 2009)
Atma is back in business with his brand new album, Music Revolution,"Atma - Music Revolution" on Bmss Records (Germany) (25 November 2011) released in December 2011 on the German label BMSS.
Beside his trance projects, Andrei works as music composer for commercial bands (house, techno, dance, pop, rock, hip hop..) but also as a film music producer.
On the international scene he performed on over 500 festivals and music events all around the world: Dubai (U.A.E), Germany, United Kingdom, Swiss, Denmark, Austria, Italy, Sweden, Bulgaria, Romania, Macedonia, Serbia, Chile, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Portugal, Russia, Ireland, Spain, Turkey, Greece and many more.
