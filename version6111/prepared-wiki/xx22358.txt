==History==

Dreamland was founded in 1913 with the building of the resort (containing a bar and hotel rooms often frequented by loggers unable to make it home in the winter) by Norbert Sarazin.  A dance pavilion, originally quite a local attraction, burned in 1921 and Prohibition caused the closing of the bar; it reopened in 1947.[ref]

Logging was formerly the main industry in the town.[tpl]cite web|title=Office-Nara Logging-Dreamland: Photograph by J.W. Nara from Michigan Technological University digital archives|url=http://digarch.lib.mtu.edu/showbib.aspx?bib_id=604753#|accessdate=2007-08-30[/tpl]
