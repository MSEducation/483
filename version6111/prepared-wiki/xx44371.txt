Also called "Ayu" by her fans, Hamasaki has been dubbed the "Empress of J-pop" because of her popularity and widespread influence in Japan and throughout Asia.[tpl]Cite news |first=Lisa |last=Takeuchi Cullen |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/ |title=Empress of Pop |work=Time |accessdate=January 24, 2008 |pages=Splash |date=March 25, 2002 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080102082430/www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/ |archivedate=January 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cnnasiapacific.com/programs/en/program/15/ | title=Talk Asia — Program Descriptions|publisher=Turner International Asia Pacific| accessdate=February 19, 2008[/tpl] Born and raised in Fukuoka, she moved to Tokyo at fourteen to pursue a career in entertainment. In 1998, under the tutelage of Avex CEO Max Matsuura, she released a string of modestly selling singles that concluded with her 1999 debut album A Song for ××. The album debuted at the top of the Oricon charts and remained there for four weeks, establishing her popularity in Japan.
Hamasaki's constantly changing image and tight control over her artistry has helped her popularity extend across Asia; music and fashion trends she has started have spread regionally to China, Singapore and other countries across Southeast Asia. She has appeared in or lent her songs to many advertisements and television commercials. Though she originally supported the exploitation of her popularity for commercial purposes, she later reconsidered and eventually opposed her status as an Avex "product".
Since her 1998 debut with the single recording "Poker Face",Oricon does not count Nothing from Nothing, released by Nippon Columbia, among Hamasaki's albums. Hamasaki has sold over 53,000,000 records in Japan, ranking her among the best-selling recording artists in the country.[ref][tpl]ja icon[/tpl]
