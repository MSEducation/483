[[Lituus]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Roman religion, Natural horns

The word lituus originally meant a curved augural staff (cp. "crozier") or a curved war-trumpet in the ancient Latin language. In English it is used with several meanings.

==Roman ritual wand==

The lituus was a crooked wand (similar in shape to the top part of a crosier) used as a cult instrument in ancient Roman religion by augurs to mark out a ritual space in the sky (a templum). The passage of birds through this templum indicated divine favor or disfavor for a given undertaking.
The lituus was also used as a symbol of office for the college of the augurs to mark them out as a priestly group.

==Music instrument==

===Ancient lituus===

The ancient lituus was an old Etruscan high-pitched brass instrument, which was bent at the end, similar to the Gallic carnyx. It was later used by the Romans, especially for processional music and as a signalling horn in the army.Picture of reconstructed Roman lituus. In 17th century Germany a variant of the bent ancient lituus was still used as a signalling horn by nightwatchmen.

===Mediaeval lituus===

The mediaeval lituus was a different brass instrument from the ancient Etruscan instrument, described by KÃ¼rzinger (1763) as a variant of the early trumpet or horn, i.e. a later development of the ancient Roman tuba. One of the last compositions orchestrated for the mediaeval lituus was Bach's motet O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht (BWV 118). Scientists from Edinburgh University tried to recreate the lituus in May 2009, when the instrument had been out of use for 300 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8075223.stm|title='Lost' music instrument recreated|accessdate=30 May 2009|date=30 May 2009|author=Pallab Ghosh|publisher=BBC  |work=BBC News[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5aHfVk_71c|title=Scientists recreate Bachs forgotten horn|accessdate=1 June 2009|date=1 June 2009|author=Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)|publisher=YouTube|work=EPSRCvideo[/tpl]
