The Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889 was the first land rush into the Unassigned Lands and included all or part of the 2013 modern day Canadian, Cleveland, Kingfisher, Logan, Oklahoma, and Payne counties of the U.S. state of Oklahoma.[tpl]cite web |url=http://marti.rootsweb.com/land/oklands.html |title=Oklahoma Land Openings 1889-1907  |accessdate=2007-03-03  |author=Bradford, Susan |date=2007-02-10[/tpl]  The land run started at high noon on April 22, 1889, with an estimated 50,000 people lined up for their piece of the available two million acres (8,000 km²).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ok-history.mus.ok.us/lib/1890/1890index.htm | title=1890 Oklahoma Territory Census |accessdate=2007-03-03 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060206034927/http://www.ok-history.mus.ok.us/lib/1890/1890index.htm |archivedate=2006-02-06[/tpl]
The Unassigned Lands were considered some of the best unoccupied public land in the United States. The Indian Appropriations Bill of 1889 was passed and signed into law with an amendment by Illinois Representative William McKendree Springer, that authorized President Benjamin Harrison to open the two million acres (8,000 km²) for settlement. Due to the Homestead Act of 1862, signed by President Abraham Lincoln, legal settlers could claim lots up to [tpl]convert|160|acre|km2[/tpl] in size.  Provided a settler lived on the land and improved it, the settler could then receive the title to the land.

==Boomers and Sooners==

A number of the people who participated in the run entered the unoccupied land early and hid there until the legal time of entry to lay quick claim to some of the most choice homesteads. These people came to be identified as "Sooners." This led to hundreds of legal contests that arose and were decided first at local land offices and eventually by the U.S. Department of the Interior. Arguments included what constituted the "legal time of entry."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ok-history.mus.ok.us/enc/landrun.htm |title=Land rush of 1889 |accessdate=2007-03-03 |author=Hoig, Stan |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060411041957/http://www.ok-history.mus.ok.us/enc/landrun.htm |archivedate=2006-04-11[/tpl]  While some people think that the settlers who entered the territory at the legally appointed time were known as "boomers," the term actually refers to those who campaigned for the opening of the lands, led by David L. Payne.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
The University of Oklahoma's fight song, "Boomer Sooner" derives from these two names.Sooners Sports website: What is a Sooner

==Rapid growth==

By the end of the day (April 22, 1889), both Oklahoma City and Guthrie had established cities of around 10,000 people in literally half a day. As Harper's Weekly put it:
 
 "At twelve o'clock on Monday, April 22d,  the resident population of Guthrie was nothing; before sundown it was at least ten thousand. In that time streets had been laid out, town lots staked off, and steps taken toward the formation of a municipal government."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.library.cornell.edu/Reps/DOCS/landrush.htm |title=The Rush to Oklahoma |accessdate=2007-03-04  |author=Howard, William Willard  |date=1889-05-18[/tpl]

Many settlers immediately started improving their new land or stood in line waiting to file their claim.  Many children sold creek water to homesteaders waiting in line for five cents a cup, while other children gathered buffalo dung to provide fuel for cooking.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/%7Eitunassi/index.html |title=History of the Unassigned Lands |accessdate=2007-03-04 |date=2007-01-02[/tpl] By the second week, schools had opened and were being taught by volunteers paid by pupils' parents until regular school districts could be established.  Within one month, Oklahoma City had five banks and six newspapers.
On May 2, 1890, the Organic Act was passed creating the Oklahoma Territory. This act included the Panhandle of Oklahoma within the territory. It also allowed for central governments and designated Guthrie as the territory's capital.

==Depiction of 1889 Land Rush==

Hollywood has produced motion pictures illustrating the Oklahoma Land Run of 1889 and the way of a pioneer's life on the acreaged claims.
The rush is also the central theme of an album in the Belgian comics series Lucky Luke.
