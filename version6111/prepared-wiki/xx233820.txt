Joe Gittleman described the band's approach to the album in an interview:  "We really want to make a fun, upbeat record with a lot of cool ska stuff. Songs I look forward to playing at shows."  Dicky Barrett added that the songs reflect his "skewed and slightly distorted look at our world and life in general."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jimsullivanink.com/content/view/1538/38/ |title=Mighty Mighty Bosstones Back in the Flesh ...
