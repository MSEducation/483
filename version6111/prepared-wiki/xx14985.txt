A supercomputer is a computer at the frontline of contemporary processing capacity – particularly speed of calculation which can happen at speeds of nanoseconds.
Supercomputers were introduced in the 1960s, made initially and, for decades, primarily by Seymour Cray at Control Data Corporation (CDC), Cray Research and subsequent companies bearing his name or monogram. While the supercomputers of the 1970s used only a few processors, in the 1990s machines with thousands of processors began to appear and, by the end of the 20th century, massively parallel supercomputers with tens of thousands of "off-the-shelf" processors were the norm.[tpl]cite book |title=Supercomputers: directions in technology and applications |first=Allan R. |last=Hoffman |last2=et al. |publisher=National Academies |year=1990 |isbn=0-309-04088-4 |pages=35–47 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Readings in computer architecture |first=Mark Donald |last=Hill |first2=Norman Paul |last2=Jouppi |first3=Gurindar |last3=Sohi |year=1999 |isbn=1-55860-539-8 |pages=40–49 [/tpl] [tpl]As of|2013|11[/tpl], China's Tianhe-2 supercomputer is the fastest in the world at 33.86 petaFLOPS, or 33.86 quadrillion floating point operations per second.
Systems with massive numbers of processors generally take one of two paths: In one approach (e.g., in distributed computing), a large number of discrete computers (e.g., laptops) distributed across a network (e.g., the Internet) devote some or all of their time to solving a common problem; each individual computer (client) receives and completes many small tasks, reporting the results to a central server which integrates the task results from all the clients into the overall solution.[tpl]cite book |title=Grid computing: experiment management, tool integration, and scientific workflows |first=Radu |last=Prodan |first2=Thomas |last2=Fahringer |year=2007 |isbn=3-540-69261-4 |pages=1–4 [/tpl]DesktopGrid In another approach, a large number of dedicated processors are placed in close proximity to each other (e.g. in a computer cluster); this saves considerable time moving data around and makes it possible for the processors to work together (rather than on separate tasks), for example in mesh and hypercube architectures.
The use of multi-core processors combined with centralization is an emerging trend; one can think of this as a small cluster (the multicore processor in a smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc.) that both depends upon and contributes to the cloud.Performance Modelling and Optimization of Memory Access on Cellular Computer Architecture Cyclops64 K Barner, GR Gao, Z Hu, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2005, Volume 3779, Network and Parallel Computing, Pages 132–143Analysis and performance results of computing betweenness centrality on IBM Cyclops64 by Guangming Tan, Vugranam C.

Supercomputers play an important role in the field of computational science, and are used for a wide range of computationally intensive tasks in various fields, including quantum mechanics, weather forecasting, climate research, oil and gas exploration, molecular modeling (computing the structures and properties of chemical compounds, biological macromolecules, polymers, and crystals), and physical simulations (such as simulations of the early moments of the universe, airplane and spacecraft aerodynamics, the detonation of nuclear weapons, and nuclear fusion). Throughout their history, they have been essential in the field of cryptanalysis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://odenton.patch.com/articles/nsa-breaks-ground-on-massive-computing-center |title=NSA Breaks Ground on Massive Computing Center |first=Tim |last=Lemke |date=May 8, 2013 |accessdate=December 11, 2013[/tpl]

==History==

The history of supercomputing goes back to the 1960s, with the Atlas at the University of Manchester and a series of computers at Control Data Corporation (CDC), designed by Seymour Cray. These used innovative designs and parallelism to achieve superior computational peak performance.Hardware software co-design of a multimedia SOC platform by Sao-Jie Chen, Guang-Huei Lin, Pao-Ann Hsiung, Yu-Hen Hu 2009 ISBN pages 70-72 
The Atlas was a joint venture between Ferranti and the Manchester University and was designed to operate at processing speeds approaching one microsecond per instruction, about one million instructions per second.[tpl]citation |title=The Atlas |url=http://www.computer50.org/kgill/atlas/atlas.html |publisher=University of Manchester |accessdate=21 September 2010[/tpl] The first Atlas was officially commissioned on 7 December 1962 as one of the world's first supercomputers – considered to be the most powerful computer in the world at that time by a considerable margin, and equivalent to four IBM 7094s.[tpl]citation |last=Lavington |first=Simon |title=A History of Manchester Computers |year=1998 |edition=2 |publisher=The British Computer Society |location=Swindon |isbn=978-1-902505-01-5|pages=41–52[/tpl]
The CDC 6600, released in 1964, was designed by Cray to be the fastest in the world by a large margin. Cray switched from germanium to silicon transistors, which he ran very fast, solving the overheating problem by introducing refrigeration.The Supermen, Charles Murray, Wiley & Sons, 1997. Given that the 6600 outran all computers of the time by about 10 times, it was dubbed a supercomputer and defined the supercomputing market when one hundred computers were sold at $8 million each.A history of modern computing by Paul E.

While the supercomputers of the 1980s used only a few processors, in the 1990s, machines with thousands of processors began to appear both in the United States and in Japan, setting new computational performance records.

==Hardware and architecture==

Approaches to supercomputer architecture have taken dramatic turns since the earliest systems were introduced in the 1960s. Early supercomputer architectures pioneered by Seymour Cray relied on compact innovative designs and local parallelism to achieve superior computational peak performance. However, in time the demand for increased computational power ushered in the age of massively parallel systems.
While the supercomputers of the 1970s used only a few processors, in the 1990s, machines with thousands of processors began to appear and by the end of the 20th century, massively parallel supercomputers with tens of thousands of "off-the-shelf" processors were the norm. Supercomputers of the 21st century can use over 100,000 processors (some being graphic units) connected by fast connections.
Throughout the decades, the management of heat density has remained a key issue for most centralized supercomputers.[tpl]cite web |title=The TianHe-1A Supercomputer: Its Hardware and Software |author= Xue-June Yang, Xiang-Ke Liao, et al in Journal of Computer Science and Technology | volume= 26, Number 3 |pages= 344–351 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h70244371pr727g0/[/tpl]The Supermen: Story of Seymour Cray and the Technical Wizards Behind the Supercomputer by Charles J. Murray 1997 ISBN 0-471-04885-2 pages 133–135Parallel Computational Fluid Dyynamics; Recent Advances and Future Directions edited by Rupak Biswas 2010 ISBN 1-60595-022-X page 401 The large amount of heat generated by a system may also have other effects, e.g. reducing the lifetime of other system components.Supercomputing Research Advances by Yongge Huáng 2008 ISBN 1-60456-186-6 pages 313–314 There have been diverse approaches to heat management, from pumping Fluorinert through the system, to a hybrid liquid-air cooling system or air cooling with normal air conditioning temperatures.
Systems with a massive number of processors generally take one of two paths. In the grid computing approach, the processing power of a large number of computers, organised as distributed, diverse administrative domains, is opportunistically used whenever a computer is available. In another approach, a large number of processors are used in close proximity to each other, e.g. in a computer cluster. In such a centralized massively parallel system the speed and flexibility of the interconnect becomes very important and modern supercomputers have used various approaches ranging from enhanced Infiniband systems to three-dimensional torus interconnects.Knight, Will: "IBM creates world's most powerful computer", NewScientist.com news service, June 2007 The use of multi-core processors combined with centralization is an emerging direction, e.g. as in the Cyclops64 system.
As the price/performance of general purpose graphic processors (GPGPUs) has improved, a number of petaflop supercomputers such as Tianhe-I and Nebulae have started to rely on them.[tpl]cite web |last=Prickett |first=Timothy |title=Top 500 supers – The Dawning of the GPUs |publisher==Theregister.co.uk |date= May 31, 2010 |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/31/top_500_supers_jun2010/ [/tpl] However, other systems such as the K computer continue to use conventional processors such as SPARC-based designs and the overall applicability of GPGPUs in general purpose high performance computing applications has been the subject of debate, in that while a GPGPU maybe tuned to score well on specific benchmarks its overall applicability to everyday algorithms may be limited unless significant effort is spent to tune the application towards it.[tpl]cite book |title=Considering GPGPU for HPC Centers: Is It Worth the Effort? |author= Hans Hacker et al in Facing the Multicore-Challenge: Aspects of New Paradigms and Technologies in Parallel Computing by Rainer Keller, David Kramer and Jan-Philipp Weiss |year=2010 |isbn= 3-642-16232-0 |pages= 118–121 |url=http://books.google.it/books?id=-luqXPiew_UC&pg=PA118&dq=GPGPU+supercomputer&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NKYyT-XTCYSk4gTf342XBQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=GPGPU%20supercomputer&f=false |publisher= [/tpl] However, GPUs are gaining ground and in 2012 the Jaguar supercomputer was transformed into Titan by replacing CPUs with GPUs.[tpl]cite web |title=Cray's Titan Supercomputer for ORNL Could Be World's Fastest |author=Damon Poeter |publisher=Pcmag.com |date=October 11, 2011 |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2394515,00.asp[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=GPUs Will Morph ORNL's Jaguar Into 20-Petaflop Titan |first= Michael |last=Feldman |publisher=Hpcwire.com |date=October 11, 2011 |url=http://www.hpcwire.com/hpcwire/2011-10-11/gpus_will_morph_ornl_s_jaguar_into_20-petaflop_titan.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Oak Ridge changes Jaguar's spots from CPUs to GPUs |author= Timothy Prickett Morgan |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date= October 11, 2011 |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/11/oak_ridge_cray_nvidia_titan/ [/tpl]
A number of "special-purpose" systems have been designed, dedicated to a single problem. This allows the use of specially programmed FPGA chips or even custom VLSI chips, allowing better price/performance ratios by sacrificing generality.

===Energy usage and heat management===

A typical supercomputer consumes large amounts of electrical power, almost all of which is converted into heat, requiring cooling. For example, Tianhe-1A consumes 4.04 Megawatts of electricity. The cost to power and cool the system can be significant, e.g. 4MW at $0.10/kWh is $400 an hour or about $3.5 million per year.
Heat management is a major issue in complex electronic devices, and affects powerful computer systems in various ways.[tpl]cite web |title=Better Computing Through CPU Cooling |first= Alexander A. |last=Balandin |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date= October 2009 |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/materials/better-computing-through-cpu-cooling/0 [/tpl] The thermal design power and CPU power dissipation issues in supercomputing surpass those of traditional computer cooling technologies.

The packing of thousands of processors together inevitably generates significant amounts of heat density that need to be dealt with. The Cray 2 was liquid cooled, and used a Fluorinert "cooling waterfall" which was forced through the modules under pressure. However, the submerged liquid cooling approach was not practical for the multi-cabinet systems based on off-the-shelf processors, and in System X a special cooling system that combined air conditioning with liquid cooling was developed in conjunction with the Liebert company.Computational science – ICCS 2005: 5th international conference edited by Vaidy S. Sunderam 2005 ISBN 3-540-26043-9 pages 60–67
In the Blue Gene system IBM deliberately used low power processors to deal with heat density.[ref]

==Software and system management==

===Operating systems===

Since the end of the 20th century, supercomputer operating systems have undergone major transformations, based on the changes in supercomputer architecture.Encyclopedia of Parallel Computing by David Padua 2011 ISBN 0-387-09765-1 pages 426–429 While early operating systems were custom tailored to each supercomputer to gain speed, the trend has been to move away from in-house operating systems to the adaptation of generic software such as Linux.Knowing machines: essays on technical change'' by Donald MacKenzie 1998 ISBN 0-262-63188-1 page 149-151
Since modern massively parallel supercomputers typically separate computations from other services by using multiple types of nodes, they usually run different operating systems on different nodes, e.g. using a small and efficient lightweight kernel such as CNK or CNL on compute nodes, but a larger system such as a Linux-derivative on server and I/O nodes.Euro-Par 2004 Parallel Processing: 10th International Euro-Par Conference 2004, by Marco Danelutto, Marco Vanneschi and Domenico Laforenza ISBN 3-540-22924-8 pages 835Euro-Par 2006 Parallel Processing: 12th International Euro-Par Conference, 2006, by Wolfgang E.

Alam etal International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications February 2008 vol. 22 no. 1 52–80
While in a traditional multi-user computer system job scheduling is in effect a tasking problem for processing and peripheral resources, in a massively parallel system, the job management system needs to manage the allocation of both computational and communication resources, as well as gracefully dealing with inevitable hardware failures when tens of thousands of processors are present.Open Job Management Architecture for the Blue Gene/L Supercomputer by Yariv Aridor et al in Job scheduling strategies for parallel processing by Dror G. Feitelson 2005 ISBN ISBN 978-3-540-31024-2 pages 95–101
Although most modern supercomputers use the Linux operating system, each manufacturer has its own specific Linux-derivative, and no industry standard exists, partly due to the fact that the differences in hardware architectures require changes to optimize the operating system to each hardware design.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.top500.org/overtime/list/32/os |title=Top500 OS chart |publisher=Top500.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl]

===Software tools and message passing===

The parallel architectures of supercomputers often dictate the use of special programming techniques to exploit their speed. Software tools for distributed processing include standard APIs such as MPI and PVM, VTL, and open source-based software solutions such as Beowulf.
In the most common scenario, environments such as PVM and MPI for loosely connected clusters and OpenMP for tightly coordinated shared memory machines are used. Significant effort is required to optimize an algorithm for the interconnect characteristics of the machine it will be run on; the aim is to prevent any of the CPUs from wasting time waiting on data from other nodes. GPGPUs have hundreds of processor cores and are programmed using programming models such as CUDA.
Moreover, it is quite difficult to debug and test parallel programs. Special techniques need to be used for testing and debugging such applications.

==Distributed supercomputing==

===Opportunistic approaches===

Opportunistic Supercomputing is a form of networked grid computing whereby a “super virtual computer” of many loosely coupled volunteer computing machines performs very large computing tasks. Grid computing has been applied to a number of large-scale embarrassingly parallel problems that require supercomputing performance scales. However, basic grid and cloud computing approaches that rely on volunteer computing can not handle traditional supercomputing tasks such as fluid dynamic simulations.
The fastest grid computing system is the distributed computing project Folding@home. F@h reported 8.1 petaflops of x86 processing power [tpl]As of|2012|03|alt=as of March 2012[/tpl]. Of this, 5.8 petaflops are contributed by clients running on various GPUs, 1.7 petaflops come from PlayStation 3 systems, and the rest from various CPU systems.[tpl]Cite document |url=http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=osstats |title=Folding@home: OS Statistics |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=2012-03-11[/tpl]

[tpl]As of|2011|05[/tpl], BOINC recorded a processing power of over 5.5 petaflops through over 480,000 active computers on the network[tpl]Cite document |url=http://www.boincstats.com/stats/project_graph.php?pr=bo |title=BOINCstats: BOINC Combined |publisher=BOINC |accessdate=2011-05-28 |postscript=Note this link will give current statistics, not those on the date last accessed[/tpl] The most active project (measured by computational power), MilkyWay@home, reports processing power of over 700 teraflops through over 33,000 active computers.[tpl]Cite document |url=http://boincstats.com/stats/project_graph.php?pr=milkyway |title=BOINCstats: MilkyWay@home |publisher=BOINC |accessdate=2011-05-28 |postscript=Note this link will give current statistics, not those on the date last accessed[/tpl]
[tpl]As of|2011|05[/tpl], GIMPS's distributed Mersenne Prime search currently achieves about 60 teraflops through over 25,000 registered computers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mersenne.org/primenet |title=Internet PrimeNet Server Distributed Computing Technology for the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search |work=GIMPS |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |postscript= [/tpl] The Internet PrimeNet Server supports GIMPS's grid computing approach, one of the earliest and most successful grid computing projects, since 1997.

===Quasi-opportunistic approaches===

Quasi-opportunistic supercomputing is a form of distributed computing whereby the “super virtual computer” of a large number of networked geographically disperse computers performs huge processing power demanding computing tasks.[tpl]cite web|last=Kravtsov|first=Valentin; Carmeli, David; Dubitzky, Werner; Orda, Ariel; Schuster, Assaf; Yoshpa, Benny|title=Quasi-opportunistic supercomputing in grids, hot topic paper (2007)|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.135.8993|work=IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=4 August 2011[/tpl] Quasi-opportunistic supercomputing aims to provide a higher quality of service than opportunistic grid computing by achieving more control over the assignment of tasks to distributed resources and the use of intelligence about the availability and reliability of individual systems within the supercomputing network. However, quasi-opportunistic distributed execution of demanding parallel computing software in grids should be achieved through implementation of grid-wise allocation agreements, co-allocation subsystems, communication topology-aware allocation mechanisms, fault tolerant message passing libraries and data pre-conditioning.

==Performance measurement==

===Capability vs capacity===

Supercomputers generally aim for the maximum in capability computing rather than capacity computing. Capability computing is typically thought of as using the maximum computing power to solve a single large problem in the shortest amount of time. Often a capability system is able to solve a problem of a size or complexity that no other computer can, e.g. a very complex weather simulation application.
Capacity computing in contrast is typically thought of as using efficient cost-effective computing power to solve a small number of somewhat large problems or a large number of small problems, e.g. many user access requests to a database or a web site.The Potential Impact of High-End Capability Computing on Four Illustrative Fields of Science and Engineering by Committee on the Potential Impact of High-End Computing on Illustrative Fields of Science and Engineering and National Research Council (October 28, 2008) ISBN 0-309-12485-9 page 9 Architectures that lend themselves to supporting many users for routine everyday tasks may have a lot of capacity but are not typically considered supercomputers, given that they do not solve a single very complex problem.

===Performance metrics===

In general, the speed of supercomputers is measured and benchmarked in "FLOPS" (FLoating Point Operations Per Second), and not in terms of MIPS, i.e. as "instructions per second", as is the case with general purpose computers.[tpl]cite book |title=Performance Evaluation, Prediction and Visualization of Parallel Systems |author= Xingfu Wu |year=1999 |isbn= 0-7923-8462-8 |pages= 114–117 |url=http://books.google.it/books?id=IJZt5H6R8OIC&pg=PA116&dq=supercomputer+Mips+flops&hl=en&sa=X&ei=teUzT6C7OY3qOZ2qhYgC&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=supercomputer%20Mips%20flops&f=false |publisher= [/tpl] These measurements are commonly used with an SI prefix such as tera-, combined into the shorthand "TFLOPS" (1012 FLOPS, pronounced teraflops), or peta-, combined into the shorthand "PFLOPS" (1015 FLOPS, pronounced petaflops.) "Petascale" supercomputers can process one quadrillion (1015) (1000 trillion) FLOPS. Exascale is computing performance in the exaflops range. An exaflop is one quintillion (1018) FLOPS (one million teraflops).
No single number can reflect the overall performance of a computer system, yet the goal of the Linpack benchmark is to approximate how fast the computer solves numerical problems and it is widely used in the industry. The FLOPS measurement is either quoted based on the theoretical floating point performance of a processor (derived from manufacturer's processor specifications and shown as "Rpeak" in the TOP500 lists) which is generally unachievable when running real workloads, or the achievable throughput, derived from the LINPACK benchmarks and shown as "Rmax" in the TOP500 list.  The LINPACK benchmark typically performs LU decomposition of a large matrix. The LINPACK performance gives some indication of performance for some real-world problems, but does not necessarily match the processing requirements of many other supercomputer workloads, which for example may require more memory bandwidth, or may require better integer computing performance, or may need a high performance I/O system to achieve high levels of performance.

===The TOP500 list===

Since 1993, the fastest supercomputers have been ranked on the TOP500 list according to their LINPACK benchmark results. The list does not claim to be unbiased or definitive, but it is a widely cited current definition of the "fastest" supercomputer available at any given time.
This is a recent list of the computers which appeared at the top of the TOP500 list,[tpl]cite web|author=Intel brochure – 11/91 |url=http://www.top500.org/sublist |title=Directory page for Top500 lists. Result for each list since June 1993 |publisher=Top500.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl] and the "Peak speed" is given as the "Rmax" rating.

==Applications of supercomputers==

The stages of supercomputer application may be summarized in the following table:
The IBM Blue Gene/P computer has been used to simulate a number of artificial neurons equivalent to approximately one percent of a human cerebral cortex, containing 1.6 billion neurons with approximately 9 trillion connections. The same research group also succeeded in using a supercomputer to simulate a number of artificial neurons equivalent to the entirety of a rat's brain.Kaku, Michio. Physics of the Future (New York: Doubleday, 2011), 65.
Modern-day weather forecasting also relies on supercomputers. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration uses supercomputers to crunch hundreds of millions of observations to help make weather forecasts more accurate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/08/0829_050829_supercomputer.html |title=Faster Supercomputers Aiding Weather Forecasts |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2011-07-08[/tpl]
In 2011, the challenges and difficulties in pushing the envelope in supercomputing were underscored by IBM's abandonment of the Blue Waters petascale project.Washington Post August 8, 2011[tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl]

==Research and development trends==

Given the current speed of progress, industry experts estimate that supercomputers will reach 1 exaflops (1018, one quintillion FLOPS) by 2018. China has stated plans to have a 1 exaflop supercomputer online by 2018.[tpl]cite web|author=Kan Michael |url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/computer-hardware/china-building-100-petaflop-supercomputer-206072 |title=China is building a 100-petaflop supercomputer, InfoWorld, October 31, 2012 |publisher=infoworld.com |date=2012-10-31 |accessdate=2012-10-31[/tpl] Using the Intel MIC multi-core processor architecture, which is Intel's response to GPU systems, SGI plans to achieve a 500-fold increase in performance by 2018, in order to achieve one exaflop.
