Induction coils were used to provide high voltage for early gas discharge and Crookes tubes and other high voltage research.  They were also used to provide entertainment (lighting Geissler tubes, for example) and to drive small "shocking coils", Tesla coils and violet ray devices used in quack medicine.  They were used by Hertz to demonstrate the existence of electromagnetic waves, as predicted by James Maxwell  and by Lodge and Marconi in the first research into radio waves.  Their largest industrial use was probably in early wireless telegraphy spark-gap radio transmitters and to power early cold cathode x-ray tubes from the 1890s to the 1920s, after which they were supplanted in both these applications by AC transformers and vacuum tubes.   However their largest use was as the ignition coil or spark coil in the ignition system of internal combustion engines, where they are still used, although the interrupter contacts are now replaced by solid state switches.  A smaller version is used to trigger the flash tubes used in cameras and strobe lights.
