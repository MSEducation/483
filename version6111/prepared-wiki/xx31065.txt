==History==

===Beginnings===

Turner Network Television first launched on October 3, 1988, with a telecast of the 1939 classic film Gone with the Wind, to which TNT founder Ted Turner had acquired the rights. The movie was chosen as the channel's first program because, it was said that Gone with the Wind was Turner's favourite movie (it would also be the first program to air on sister channel Turner Classic Movies, when it debuted in April 1994). Incidentally, Gone With the Wind had its premiere held in Atlanta, Georgia – Turner's hometown and the headquarters of Turner Broadcasting System – and the city served as the setting for the film. TNT was, at least initially, a vehicle for older movies and television shows, but slowly began to add original programming and newer reruns. When TNT began broadcasting films from the pre-1986 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer library, it caused controversy when the network aired colorized versions of many black-and-white classics.

===Expansion===

In 1990, TNT obtained partial television rights to the National Football League's Sunday Night Football package, which it retained until 1997. The NFL on TNT consisted of three or four preseason games annually and telecasts of regular season games during the first half of each season. As has always been the case for cable broadcasts, TNT distributed its feed to broadcast television stations in each team's home market. Starting in 1995, TNT was also the home of WCW Monday Nitro, the flagship program of the now-defunct World Championship Wrestling, which was once regularly the highest rated weekly program on cable television. The program defeated Monday Night Raw, the flagship show of the World Wrestling Federation (now the WWE or World Wrestling Entertainment), for 83 straight weeks until 1998.
The network was also known for its late night programming, such as MonsterVision, which showcased B movies (including a Godzilla marathon at the end of every month), with occasional guest hosts Penn and Teller. MonsterVision eventually found a permanent host in cult personality and drive-in movie aficionado Joe Bob Briggs (the pseudonym of actor and film critic John Irving Bloom, who had hosted a similar B movie showcase on The Movie Channel called Joe Bob Briggs' Drive-In Theater for ten years prior to becoming host of MonsterVision). Every Saturday night, from 1997 to 2000, Briggs would host a pair of horror films (such as Friday the 13th Part 2 and Wes Craven's New Nightmare) and provide a running commentary, trivia, off-color jokes and a drive-in total. Also included in his host segments were jokes at the expense of TNT's Standards & Practices department for heavy censorship of the featured movies (comparatively, Briggs' Drive-In Theater showcase on The Movie Channel broadcast films with more risque content than that allowed by TNT, as well as a wider variety of B movies). This running joke culminated in a Friday the 13th all-night marathon during Halloween of 1998, where it was implied that Ted Turner was out to kill him.
Up until 1998, TNT would also show cartoons from the Turner library (such as The Flintstones, Scooby-Doo, the DePatie-Freleng Pink Panther cartoons, Dexter's Laboratory and The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest) on a block called "TNT Toons". The Rudy and Gogo World Famous Cartoon Show, which ran from 1995 to 1997, was an original children's program on the network featuring classic Warner Bros., MGM and Popeye shorts, hosted by marionettes and a nanny goat. In 1998, TNT dropped all of its remaining cartoons (which at the time were running under the "Disaster Area" banner), with those shows moving to Cartoon Network and becoming the core of a new cable network devoted to classic cartoons that launched several months later called Boomerang.
During the 1990s, TNT scheduled a lineup of shows on weekday afternoons that included Due South, Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, L.A. Law, Kung Fu: The Legend Continues, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman and Babylon 5. In 1998, TNT took over production of the fifth and final season of Babylon 5 from the Prime Time Entertainment Network, after the ad-hoc syndication block ceased operations; the following year, TNT produced the Babylon 5 spinoff series Crusade, which was canceled after 13 episodes, after TNT management decided that science fiction did not fit the channel's brand identity. In 2001, TNT debuted its then most successful original series, Witchblade, which ran for two seasons, ending in 2002.

===Shift towards drama===

On June 12, 2001, TNT underwent an extensive rebrand, with a new logo (designed by Trollbäck + Company) and a new slogan, "We Know Drama", which emphasized the network's new programming focus on dramatic shows, including sports and off-network syndicated dramas such as Law & Order, NYPD Blue, ER and Judging Amy. As the decade went on, its format became a direct contrast to sister network TBS, which had focused on a wider variety of programming initially but moved toward and now focuses largely on comedic series and films, and by extension Cartoon Network, which showed exclusively animated programming at the time (that channel still has a predominately animated schedule). In addition, NASCAR coverage moved to TNT from TBS starting with the 2001 season, as Turner Broadcasting System management believed that it would fit more with TNT's new format than TBS.
On January 1, 2003, "TNT Plus" launched as a substitute feed for TNT, although it does not appear this was ever reflected in the network's on-air identity. The apparent sole purpose of its establishment was to force renegotiations to increase carriage fees to help pay for TNT's new NBA and NASCAR contracts, well before the network's rates were scheduled to come up for renewal with most cable and satellite providers. In theory, TNT Plus was to have been the sole carrier of Turner's NBA and NASCAR coverage from that point forward, while any providers still carrying the original TNT would have seen replacement programming instead.R. Thomas Umstead, "TNT to ops: pay up for 'Plus'", Multichannel News, 21 October 2002 Although it appears that Comcast did not immediately sign on for TNT Plus, there is no evidence of Turner actually pulling sports programming from the "original" TNT.Linda Moss and R. Thomas Umstead, "TNT gets in HD game – TCM next?", Multichannel News, 12 January 2004
On December 7, 2008, TNT unveiled an update to its logo, mainly in a silver (shown on-screen during programming and on the TNT website) or sometimes gold beveling. The "We Know Drama" tagline remained, but the network added more of a focus on its original series and planned to have three nights of original primetime programming starting in 2009.[tpl]cite web|last=Lafayette |first=Jon |url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2008/12/new_promo_campaign_touts_tnts.php |title=New Promo Campaign Touts TNT’s Dramatic Credentials |publisher=TVWeek |date= |accessdate=2009-09-05[/tpl] In 2012, TNT rebranded itself with a new slogan: "Drama, Period." (visually displayed as "Drama.," with the TNT logo serving as the period symbol), and the logo was simply recolored to match the themes of its shows.

The European, Australian and Asian versions of the channel were paired with Cartoon Network, while the Latin American version of the channel was paired with CNN International.
