This is a list of hospitals in the Netherlands.

==University and supra-regional hospitals==

All hospitals listed here are also listed under their respective provinces.
The eight university hospitals offer the highest level of care available in the Netherlands. Each of these hospitals offers specialized services such as neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, a high-level emergency department, advanced oncology, departments for infectious diseases, and other services generally not found in smaller hospitals.
A level and type of care similar to that offered by university hospitals is offered by a number of large hospitals which are not directly affiliated with a university, though these hospitals tend to be somewhat smaller. These hospitals are frequently referred to as "top-clinical" centers.
