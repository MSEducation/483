==Founder==

Douban is founded by Ph.D Bo Yang. Dr. Yang had majored in Physics in Tsinghua University before he attended University of California at San Diego as a PhD student. After having received his Ph.D in computational physics, he worked as a research scientist at IBM. Later, he returned to China, becoming the CTO of a software company founded by one of his friends. In 2005, Dr. Yang started to create a web 2.0 site for travelling, named Luzong (驴宗), initially a one man project at a Starbucks in Beijing. In a couple of months, however, the site was transformed to what is now known as Douban.com.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/douban|title=douban profile|publisher=crunchbase|accessdate=2011-12-11[/tpl]

==Timeline==

==Censorship==

Douban has attracted a large number of intellectuals who are eager to discuss social issues. This makes douban vulnerable to be outlawed by the Chinese government. Douban has introduced a massive censorship on all contents posted in the website and often found itself in the hot water of controversy.
In March 2009, douban removed art paintings of the Renaissance for the ground that it contained 'pornographic' elements.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/simp/hi/newsid_7940000/newsid_7948300/7948369.stm|title=泥马战河蟹 草根斗权威|publisher=BBC中文网|date=2009-03-17|accessdate=2009-03-20[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/simp/hi/newsid_7870000/newsid_7877400/7877462.stm|title=给大卫像穿衣抗议政府封网|publisher=BBC中文网|date=2009-02-09|accessdate=2009-02-09[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.163.com/09/0210/08/51PEPTVI00011229.html|title=网友响应反低俗号召 给名画“穿上”衣服|publisher=信息时报|date=2009-02-10|accessdate=2009-03-20[/tpl] The action led to a campaign called "Portraits: Dress up" in which internet users were asked to dress up images of famous renaissance nudes in a protest against douban's self-censorship. The discussion about the campaign was then removed by the administrator.
That year also saw the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and douban has further extended its keyword list to ban any terms that may be relevant to the incident. One notable example is the ban on merely mentioning the name of Victoria Park in Hong Kong where the memorial gathering for the 20th anniversary was held, in the fear that it may lead to sensitive discussions. Users also found that some discussion groups, like a Hong Kong cultural study group hkren were suddenly banned and all topics were removed without any notices. The action further angered some members to move to other similar websites that employ lesser strict self-censorship policies.
