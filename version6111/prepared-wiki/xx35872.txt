[[Malapropism]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics, Speech error

A malapropism (also called a Dogberryism) is the use of an incorrect word in place of a word with a similar sound, resulting in a nonsensical, often humorous utterance. An example is Yogi Berra's statement: "Texas has a lot of electrical votes,"[tpl]cite web | title = Great Quotes | url = http://www.great-quotes.com/quote/12877 | accessdate = 2011-09-28 | quote = Texas has a lot of electrical votes[/tpl] rather than "electoral votes".
The word malapropism comes ultimately from the French mal à propos meaning "inappropriate" via "Mrs. Malaprop", a character in the Richard Brinsley Sheridan comedy The Rivals (1775) who habitually misused her words. Dogberryism comes from "Officer Dogberry", the name of a character in the William Shakespeare play Much Ado About Nothing. These are the two best-known fictional characters who made this kind of error—there are many other examples. Malapropisms also occur as errors in natural speech. Malapropisms are often the subject of media attention, especially when made by politicians or other prominent individuals.
The philosopher Donald Davidson has noted that malapropisms show how complex the process is by which the brain translates thoughts into language.

==Etymology==

The word "malapropism" (and its earlier variant, "malaprop") comes from a character named "Mrs. Malaprop" in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's 1775 play The Rivals.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |year=2000 |title =malapropism, n. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-957112-3[/tpl] Mrs. Malaprop frequently misspeaks (to great comic effect) by using words which don't have the meaning she intends, but which sound similar to words that do. Sheridan presumably chose her name in humorous reference to the word malapropos, an adjective or adverb meaning "inappropriate" or "inappropriately", derived from the French phrase, mal à propos (literally "poorly placed"). According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first recorded use of "malapropos" in English is from 1630,[tpl]cite encyclopedia |year=2000 |title =malapropos, adv., adj., and n. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-957112-3[/tpl] and the first person known to have used the word "malaprop" in the sense of "a speech error" is Lord Byron in 1814.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |year=2000 |title =malaprop, n. and adj. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-957112-3[/tpl]
The synonymous term "Dogberryism" comes from the 1598 Shakespearean play Much Ado About Nothing, in which the character Dogberry utters many malapropisms to humorous effect.[tpl]cite book|title=Situated Utterances|first=Harry|last=Berger|page=499|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-8232-2429-5[/tpl][tpl]cite encyclopedia |year=2010 |title =Dogberry, n.2 |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary online |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-957112-3 |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/56415 |accessdate=2013-09-09[/tpl]

==Distinguishing features==

An instance of speech error is called a malapropism when a word which is nonsensical or ludicrous in context, but similar in sound to what was intended, is produced.[tpl]cite book|last1=Aitchison |first1=Jeanne |last2=Straf |first2=Miron |editor=Anne Cutler|title=Slips of the Tongue and Language Production|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ILBaZpZIyXEC |accessdate=2013-09-12 |year=1982 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-082830-6 |pages=197–242 |chapter=Lexical storage and retrieval: a developing skill?[/tpl]
Definitions differ somewhat in terms of the cause of the error. Some scholars include only errors that result from a temporary failure to produce the word the speaker intended.[tpl]Cite journal |title=Malapropisms and the Structure of the Mental Lexicon |last1=Fay |first1=David |last2=Cutler |first2=Anne |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |volume=8 |issue=3 |year=1977 |pages=505–520[/tpl] Such errors are sometimes called "Fay-Cutler malapropism", after David Fay and Anne Cutler, who described the occurrence of such errors in ordinary speech.[tpl]cite book|last=Zwicky|first=Arnold|editor=Loraine Obler and Lise Menn|title=Exceptional Language and Linguistics|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~zwicky/malapropism-mental-lexicon.pdf|accessdate=2013-09-12|year=1982|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-523680-5|pages=115–132|chapter=Classical malapropisms and the creation of the mental lexicon[/tpl] Most definitions, however, include any actual word that is wrongly or accidentally used in place of a similar sounding, "correct" word. This broader definition is sometimes called "classical malapropism", or simply "malapropism".
Malapropisms differ from other kinds of speaking or writing mistakes, such as eggcorns or spoonerisms, and from the accidental or deliberate production of newly made-up words (neologisms).
For example, using obtuse or dull instead of acute or sharp is not a malapropism; using obtuse or slow-witted  when one means abstruse or difficult to understand is.
Malapropisms tend to maintain the part of speech of the originally intended word. According to linguist Jean Aitchison, "The finding that word selection errors preserve their part of speech suggest that the latter is an integral part of the word, and tightly attached to it."[tpl]Cite book|last=Aitchison |first=Jean |year=2012 |title=Words in the Mind: An Introduction to the Mental Lexicon |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=1118170962[/tpl] Likewise, substitutions tend to have the same number of syllables and the same metrical structure – the same pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables – as the intended word or phrase. If the stress pattern of the malapropism differs from the intended word, unstressed syllables may be deleted or inserted; stressed syllables and the general rhythmic pattern are maintained.

==Examples from fiction==

The fictional Mrs. Malaprop, in Sheridan's play The Rivals, utters many malapropisms. In Act III Scene 3, she declares to Captain Absolute, "Sure, if I reprehend any thing in this world it is the use of my oracular tongue, and a nice derangement of epitaphs!"[tpl]Citation |year=2008 |origyear=1775 |title=The Rivals: A Comedy |last=Sheridan |first=Richard Brinsley |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24761 |accessdate=2012-07-10[/tpl] This nonsensical utterance might, for example,  be 'corrected' to, "If I apprehend anything in this world, it is the use of my vernacular tongue, and a nice arrangement of epithets",[tpl]Cite web |title=Quotations from Richard Brinsley Sheridan |publisher=Poem Hunter |url=http://www.poemhunter.com/quotations/famous.asp?people=Richard%20Brinsley%20Sheridan&p=2 |accessdate=2012-07-10[/tpl] although these are not the only words that can be substituted to produce an appropriately expressed thought in this context, and commentators have proposed other possible replacements that work just as well.
Other malapropisms spoken by Mrs. Malaprop include "illiterate him quite from your memory" (instead of  'obliterate')', and "she's as headstrong as an allegory" (instead of alligator).
Malapropisms appeared in many works before Sheridan created the character of Mrs. Malaprop. William Shakespeare used them in a number of his plays. For example, in Much Ado About Nothing, Constable Dogberry tells Governor Leonato, "Our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two auspicious persons" (i.e., apprehended two suspicious persons) (Act 3, Scene V).[tpl]Citation |year=1997 |origyear=1598 |title=Much Ado About Nothing |last=Shakespeare |first=William |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1118 |accessdate=2012-07-10[/tpl] And in The Merchant of Venice, Launcelot, describing Shylock, declares, "Certainly he is the very devil incarnal..." (i.e., incarnate) (Act 2, Scene II).
Modern writers make use of malapropisms in novels, cartoons, films, television, and other media.
Malapropism was one of Stan Laurel's comic mannerisms. In Sons Of The Desert, for example, he says that Oliver Hardy is suffering a nervous "shakedown" (rather than "breakdown"), and calls the Exalted Ruler of their group the "exhausted ruler".[tpl]cite book|last=Gehring|first=Wes|title=Laurel and Hardy: A Bio-Bibliography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VcVohkED9e4C|accessdate=11 December 2012|year=1990|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-25172-6[/tpl]
Archie Bunker, a character in the American TV sitcom All in the Family is also known for malapropisms. He calls Orthodox Jews "off-the-docks Jews" and refers to "the Women's Lubrication Movement" (rather than Liberation).[tpl]cite book |last1=Shapiro|first1=Marianne |last2=Shapiro|first2=Michael |title=From The Critic's Workbench: Essays In Literature And Semiotics |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Vkww4u5BnU0C&pg=PA471 |accessdate=2012-07-10 |year=2005 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=978-0-8204-7915-6 |chapter=Chapter 21: The semiotics of Archie Bunker[/tpl]

==Real-life examples==

Malapropisms do not occur only as comedic literary devices. They also occur as a kind of speech error in ordinary speech. Examples are often quoted in the media.
Bertie Ahern, Taoiseach of Ireland, warned his country against "upsetting the apple tart" (i.e., apple cart) of his country's economic success.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1614940,00.html | work=Time | title=Mr. Popularity | date=2007-04-26 | accessdate=2010-05-12 | first=Catherine | last=Mayer[/tpl]
Former Chicago Mayor Richard J.

The song titles, "A Hard Day's Night" and "Tomorrow Never Knows", by The Beatles, both originated as "Ringoisms" — confused speech uttered by Ringo Starr. John Lennon and Paul McCartney called the two phrases "malapropisms".[tpl]Cite book|author=The Beatles |title=The Beatles Anthology |year=2000 |publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=978-0-8118-2684-6[/tpl]
It was reported in New Scientist that an office worker had described a colleague as "a vast suppository of information" (i.e., repository or depository). The worker then apologised for his "Miss-Marple-ism" (i.e. malapropism).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18625042.600-feedback.html |title=New Scientist 18 June 2005 Malapropism for malapropism |publisher=Newscientist.com |date=2005-06-18 |accessdate=2012-10-02[/tpl] New Scientist noted this as possibly the first time anyone had uttered a malapropism for the word malapropism itself.

==Philosophical implications==

In his essay, "A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs", the philosopher Donald Davidson suggests that malapropisms reveal something about how people process the meanings of words. He argues that language competence must not simply involve learning a set meaning for each word, and then rigidly applying those semantic rules to decode other people's utterances. Rather, he says, people must also be continually making use of other contextual information to interpret the meaning of utterances, and then modifying their understanding of each word's meaning based on those interpretations.[tpl]cite book |last=Davidson |first=Donald |chapter=A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs |pages=157–174 |editor=R.
