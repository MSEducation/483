A Beowulf cluster is a computer cluster of what are normally identical, commodity-grade computers networked into a small local area network with libraries and programs installed which allow processing to be shared among them. The result is a high-performance parallel computing cluster from inexpensive personal computer hardware.
The name Beowulf originally referred to a specific computer built in 1994 by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker at NASA.[ref]

[/ref] The name "Beowulf" comes from the main character in the Old English epic poem Beowulf, which Sterling bestowed because the poem describes its eponymous hero as having "thirty men's heft of grasp in the gripe of his hand".[ref]

No particular piece of software defines a cluster as a Beowulf. Beowulf clusters normally run a Unix-like operating system, such as BSD, Linux, or Solaris, normally built from free and open source software. Commonly used parallel processing libraries include Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM). Both of these permit the programmer to divide a task among a group of networked computers, and collect the results of processing. Examples of MPI software include OpenMPI  or MPICH. There are additional MPI implementations available.
[tpl]As of | 2014[/tpl] Beowulf systems operate worldwide, chiefly in support of scientific computing.

==Development==

A description of the Beowulf cluster, from the original "how-to", which was published by Jacek Radajewski and Douglas Eadline under the Linux Documentation Project in 1998.

===Operating systems===

[tpl]As of | 2014[/tpl] a number of Linux distributions, and at least one BSD, are designed for building Beowulf clusters. These include:
A cluster can be set up by using Knoppix bootable CDs in combination with OpenMosix. The computers will automatically link together, without need for complex configurations, to form a Beowulf cluster using all CPUs and RAM in the cluster. A Beowulf cluster is scalable to a nearly unlimited number of computers, limited only by the overhead of the network.
Provisioning of operating systems and other software for a Beowulf Cluster can be automated using software, Open Source Cluster Application Resources (OSCAR) for example. OSCAR installs on top of a standard installation of a supported Linux distribution on a cluster's head node.
