The auramine-rhodamine stain (AR), also known as the Truant auramine-rhodamine stain, is a histological technique used to visualize acid-fast bacilli using fluorescence microscopy, notably species in the Mycobacterium genus.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kommareddi S, Abramowsky C, Swinehart G, Hrabak L |title=Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections: comparison of the fluorescent auramine-O and Ziehl-Neelsen techniques in tissue diagnosis |journal=Hum Pathol |volume=15 |issue=11 |pages=1085–9 |year=1984 |pmid=6208117 |doi=10.1016/S0046-8177(84)80253-1[/tpl] Acid-fast organisms display a reddish-yellow fluorescence.[tpl]cite journal |last=Abe |first=C. |title=結核とそれらの上達テストの実験室テストの標準化 |trans_title=Standardization of laboratory tests for tuberculosis and their proficiency testing |journal=Kekkaku |volume=78 |issue=8 |pages=541–551 |date=August 2003 |pmid=14509226 |issn=0022-9776 |language=Japanese[/tpl] Although the auramine-rhodamine stain is not as specific for acid-fast organisms (i.e. Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Nocardia) as the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, it is more affordable and more sensitive, therefore it is often utilized as a screening tool.
AR stain is a mixture of Auramine O and Rhodamine B.
