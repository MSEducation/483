Mucklewain was conceived from the notion that there are rock and roll bands and songwriters in the South, whose musical "voice" is underexposed in relation to its impact on southern culture. Artists who have toured or are constantly touring and trying to take the rock to the people. Mucklewain's a people's festival, a southern people's festival featuring artists whose music speaks to the working southerner, and helps to shape and create a positive "southern culture".
