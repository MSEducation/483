==Career==

He is a young Member of Parliament sitting in the National Assembly (Tanzania) representing Nzega constituency of the Tabora region. He was first elected in the national elections on October 31, 2010. His appointment by the national executive council to run for the post through the ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) ticket was followed by a lot of criticism with critics claiming that he was appointed to contest for the post despite being the second runner up after Hussein Mohammed Bashe (the winner of the primary votes) who was not favoured on account of his citizenship being unclear, and the incumbent Lucas Lumambo Selelii (1st runner up) in the primaries, because he was working for the First Lady of Tanzania's charitable organisation, Wanawake na Maendeleo (WAMA), a rumour which he denies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jamiiforums.com/jukwaa-la-siasa/70500-witch-hunting-on-opponents-vying-seats.html |title=Witch hunting on opponents vying seats |publisher=Jamiiforums.com |date=2010-08-21 |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl]http://www.mwanahalisi.co.tz/waliopita_waliobebwa_kura_za_maoni_ccm
Immediately after his nomination by the CCM's top congregation, he was also arrested by the immigration police on charges of being a non-citizen of Tanzania and this became a center issue in the Tanzanian media. He was however cleared two days later.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mwananchi.co.tz/habari/4-habari-za-kitaifa/3939-uraia-wa-mrithi-wa-bashe-nao-matatani-akamatwa-na-uhamiaji-akidaiwa-ni-mrundi |title=Uraia wa mrithi wa Bashe nao matatani |publisher=Mwananchi.co.tz |date=2010-08-18 |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl] Despite the fact that he was cleared by the immigration officials, he still had to face stern objections from the opposition contestants.
Despite criticism and allegations, Kigwangalla won the elections.
