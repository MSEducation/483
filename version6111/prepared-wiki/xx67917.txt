[[Brucite]]

CATEGORIES: Magnesium minerals, Hydroxide minerals, Cement, Concrete, Trigonal minerals

Brucite is the mineral form of magnesium hydroxide, with the chemical formula Mg(OH)2. It is a common alteration product of periclase in marble; a low-temperature hydrothermal vein mineral in metamorphosed limestones and chlorite schists; and formed during serpentinization of dunites. Brucite is often found in association with serpentine, calcite, aragonite, dolomite, magnesite, hydromagnesite, artinite, talc and chrysotile.
Notable locations include Wood's Chrome Mine, Cedar Hill Quarry, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, USA.

==Discovery==

Brucite was first described in 1824 and named for the discoverer, American mineralogist, Archibald Bruce (1777–1818). A fibrous variety of Brucite is called Nemalite. It occurs in fibers or laths, usually elongated along 1010, but sometimes 1120 crystalline directions.

==Industrial applications==

Brucite is used as a flame retardant because it thermally decomposes to release water in a similar way to aluminium hydroxide and mixtures of huntite and hydromagnesite.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hollingbery|first=LA|author2=Hull TR|title=The Thermal Decomposition of Huntite and Hydromagnesite - A Review|journal=Thermochimica Acta|year=2010|volume=509|issue=1-2|pages=1–11|url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/1139/|doi=10.1016/j.tca.2010.06.012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Hollingbery|first=LA|author2=Hull TR|title=The Fire Retardant Behaviour of Huntite and Hydromagnesite - A Review|journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability|year=2010|volume=95|issue=12|pages=2213–2225|url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/1432|doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2010.08.019[/tpl] It also constitutes a significant source of magnesium for industry.

==Magnesian attack of cement and concrete==

When cement or concrete are exposed to non negligible  concentration of Mg2+, e.g. when these materials are left in prolonged contact with sea water or brines, Mg(OH)2 precipitates under the high pH conditions prevailing in the cement porewater. The neoformation of brucite, an expansive material, induces mechanical stress in the hardened cement paste and is responsible for the formation of cracks and fissures in concrete.
The use of dolomite as aggregate in concrete can also cause the magnesian attack and should be avoided.
