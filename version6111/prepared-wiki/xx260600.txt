The 2011 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup tournament proper features teams from four of the five tiers of the American Soccer Pyramid. These four levels—Major League Soccer, United Soccer League's Pro League, the USL's Premier Development League, the National Premier Soccer League, and the United States Adult Soccer Association— each have their own separate qualification process to trim their ranks down to their final club delegations in the months leading up to the start of the tournament proper.
The event will feature 40 teams. Eight clubs from Major League Soccer will participate, six that automatically qualify based on last season's league position and two that qualify through a play-in tournament. In addition, 11 USL Pro League clubs, 9 clubs from the USL Premier Development League, 4 clubs from the National Premier Soccer League,http://www.nationalpremiersoccerleague.com/home/505327.html and 8 USASA clubs and will also qualify.http://thecup.us/2011-us-open-cup-team-allocations-dates-finalized-mls-qualifying-returns-npsl-gets-automatic-berths-pdl-gets-extra-team/
The provisional second tier of the soccer pyramid, a reincarnation of the North American Soccer League, was disallowed by the United States Soccer Federation for the American-based clubs to participate into the tournament, mainly due to scheduling conflicts it would cause.[tpl]cite news |title=USSF: NASL teams will not be eligible for 2011 Lamar Hunt US Open Cup |first=Josh |last=Hakala |url=http://thecup.us/ussf-nasl-teams-will-not-be-eligible-for-2011-lamar-hunt-us-open-cup/ |newspaper=TheCup.us |date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=February 15, 2011[/tpl]

===Bracket===

The bracket is loosely based on geography, rather than seeding. This is the first time qualification is bracketed geographically. In the previous years, teams were bracketed strictly according to seeding. Seeds 7–10 play an extra round. All teams in the top bracket are the westernmost teams, except for Chicago. All teams in the bottom bracket are easternmost teams, except for Houston.

Note: Scorelines use the standard U.S. convention of placing the home team on the right-hand side of the score boxes.

==North American Soccer League==

USSF President Sunil Gulati announced that NASL teams were being denied entry due to the lateness of their provisional sanctioning.

==USL Professional League==

All eleven U.S.-based clubs are qualified to the tournament.

==Premier Development League==

The PDL received nine berths to the 2011 U.S. Open Cup.  One entrant from each division will be determined based upon the results of four PDL divisional games also serving as U.S. Open Cup qualifiers.  Canadian and Bermudan PDL sides are not eligible for U.S. Open Cup play.
As part of PDL qualification, the Northwest Division spot was completely deadlocked between Portland Timbers U23's and Kitsap Pumas. Instead of going to a lottery, the two sides mutually agreed to hold an unprecedented "fifth game" tiebreaker, using their regular season game on June 3, 2011, to determine the slot.http://thecup.us/historic-%E2%80%9Cfifth-game%E2%80%9D-tiebreaker-to-decide-northwest-pdl-us-open-cup-berth/
