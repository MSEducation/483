The Five People You Meet in Hell: Surviving Katrina, Smallwood's account of his experience during the storm and in its aftermath, was his first book and the first personal account of the disaster to be published.  The book was optioned for film in November, 2013, by Safier Entertainment under the working title, A Season in Hell borrowed from the extended poem of the same name by French writer Arthur Rimbaud.
