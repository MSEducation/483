[[Echi no Takutsu]]

CATEGORIES: 663 deaths, People of Asuka-period Japan, Year of birth unknown

Echi no Takutsu (kanji 朴市田来津) died in 663 at the Battle of Baekgang.
The Nihon Shoki records that, in 661, Naka-no-Oe (soon to be the Emperor Tenji-Tenno) sent a group of generals to help the country Baekje in its fight against Tang China and the kingdom of Silla. In what could almost be considered a side-note, the text states, "Takutsu, Hada no Miyakko, of Lower Shousen rank..." was sent to help Baekje.  Echi no Takutsu is said to have died a heroic death at Baekgang, slaying "tens of men."
