[[Wien's displacement law]]

CATEGORIES: Statistical mechanics, Foundational quantum physics, Optics

Wien's displacement law states that the wavelength distribution of thermal radiation from a black body at any temperature has essentially the same shape as the distribution at any other temperature, except that each wavelength is displaced on the graph. Apart from an overall T4 multiplicative factor, the average thermal energy in each mode with frequency ν only depends on the ratio ν/T. Restated in terms of the wavelength [tpl]nowrap|λ [tpl]=[/tpl] c/ν[/tpl], the distributions at corresponding wavelengths are related, where corresponding wavelengths are at locations proportional to 1/T.  Blackbody radiation approximates to Wien's law at high frequency.
From this general law, it follows that there is an inverse relationship between the wavelength of the peak of the emission of a black body and its temperature when expressed as a function of wavelength, and this less powerful consequence is often also called Wien's displacement law in many textbooks.
where λmax is the peak wavelength, T is the absolute temperature of the black body, and b is a constant of proportionality called Wien's displacement constant, equal to [tpl]physconst|bwien|after=.[/tpl]
For wavelengths near the visible spectrum, it is often more convenient to use the nanometer in place of the meter as the unit of measure.
In the field of plasma physics temperatures are often measured in units of electron volts and the proportionality constant becomes [tpl]nowrap|b [tpl]=[/tpl] [tpl]val|249.71066|u=nm·eV[/tpl][/tpl].

==Explanation and familiar approximate applications==

The law is named for Wilhelm Wien, who derived it in 1893 based on a thermodynamic argument. Wien considered adiabatic, or slow, expansion of a cavity containing waves of light in thermal equilibrium. He showed that under slow expansion or contraction, the energy of light reflecting off the walls changes in exactly the same way as the frequency. A general principle of thermodynamics is that a thermal equilibrium state, when expanded very slowly stays in thermal equilibrium. The adiabatic principle allowed Wien to conclude that for each mode, the adiabatic invariant energy/frequency is only a function of the other adiabatic invariant, the frequency/temperature.
Max Planck reinterpreted a constant closely related to Wien's constant b as a new constant of nature, now called Planck's constant, which relates the frequency of light to the energy of a light quantum.
Wien's displacement law implies that the hotter an object is, the shorter the wavelength at which it will emit most of its radiation, and also that the  wavelength for maximal or peak radiation power is found by dividing Wien's constant by the temperature in kelvins.
===Examples=== 
There are many familiar situations to which Wien's Law may be applied:

==Frequency-dependent formulation==

where [tpl]nowrap|α ≈ 2.821439...[/tpl] is a constant resulting from the numerical solution of the maximization equation, k is the Boltzmann constant, h is the Planck constant, and T is the temperature (in kelvins).
Because the spectrum from Planck's law of black body radiation takes a different shape in the frequency domain from that of the wavelength domain, the frequency location of the peak emission does not correspond to the peak wavelength using the simple relationship between frequency, wavelength, and the speed of light.

==Derivation from Planck's Law==

Wilhelm Wien first derived this law in 1893 by applying the laws of thermodynamics to electromagnetic radiation. A modern variant of Wien's derivation can be found in the textbook by Wannier.
Planck's law for the spectrum of black body radiation may be used to find the actual constant in the peak displacement law. Specifically, the spectral energy density (that is, the energy density per unit frequency) is
However the frequency is a non-linear function of wavelength
This allows to present the energy density depending on the wavelength
Differentiating u(λ,T) with respect to λ and setting the derivative equal to zero gives
which can be simplified to give
By defining the dimensionless quantity
then the equation becomes
Solving for the wavelength λ in units of nanometers, and using kelvins for the temperature yields:
The frequency form of Wien's displacement law is derived using similar methods, but starting with Planck's law in terms of frequency instead of wavelength.  The effective result is to substitute 3 for 5 in the equation for the peak wavelength. This is solved giving x = 2.82143937212... 
Using the value 4 in this equation (midway between 3 and 5) yields a "compromise" wavelength-frequency-neutral peak, which is given for x = 3.92069039487....
