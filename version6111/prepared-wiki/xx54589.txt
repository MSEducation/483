Operation Golden Pheasant was an emergency deployment of U.S. troops to Honduras in 1988, as a result of threatening actions by the forces of the Nicaraguans.

==History==

In early March, 1988, the Nicaraguan Sandinista government launched Operation Danto to overrun Contra rebel supply caches in the San Andr√©s de Bocay region, crossing into Honduran territory in their drive.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
The United States, under President Ronald Reagan, dispatched elements of the 7th Infantry Division (Light) Quick Reaction Force (QRF) on a no-notice deployment. This small force quickly landed at Palmerola Air Base (now known as Soto Cano Air Base) and moved quickly into position at a Honduran military base to facilitate the guarding of a local general.  The units from the 7th Infantry Division were on the ground several days when the 82nd Airborne elements arrived.  The deployment evolved into a live-fire training exercise, but the light infantry soldiers and paratroopers deployed ready to fight, causing the Sandinistas to rapidly withdraw back across their border.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment and Charlie Company, 3rd Battalion of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment 82nd Airborne Division, were joined by soldiers from the 2nd Battalion 9th Infantry Regiment, 2d and 3d Battalions of the 27th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division (Light) from Fort Ord, California.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
On 17 March, 1st Battalion landed at Palmerola Airfield, a Honduran Air Force base that was the headquarters for the U.S. military presence in Honduras.[tpl]cn|date=April 2012[/tpl] The 2nd Battalion jumped onto the airfield a day later, soldiers of the 27th Infantry Regiment (the "Wolfhounds") rappelled onto the airbase on 17 March 1988 and moved within 3 miles of the Nicaraguan border the same day.
The units from the 82nd Airborne, the 504th began rigorous training exercises with orders to avoid the fighting on the border. Had those orders changed, the paratroopers and infantrymen were prepared to fight, but the invading Sandinista troops had already begun to withdraw. Within days, the Sandinista government negotiated a truce with Contra leaders, and by the end of March the 27th Infantry had returned to Fort Ord, California and the paratroopers of the 504th had returned to Fort Bragg.
