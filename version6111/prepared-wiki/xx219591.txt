The film is also notable for being the first cartoon with synchronized sound. It was the first cartoon to feature a fully post-produced soundtrack which distinguished it from earlier sound cartoons such as Inkwell Studios' Song Car-Tunes (1924–1927) and Van Beuren Studios' Dinner Time (1928). Also distinguishing Steamboat Willie from earlier sound cartoons was the level of popularity.Steamboat Willie (1929) at Screen Savour

Man overboard!" and "Hope you don't feel hurt, big boy!" - see here

==Synopsis==

Mickey Mouse pilots a river steamboat, suggesting that he himself is the captain. He cheerfully whistles "Steamboat Bill" and sounds the boat's three whistles. Soon the real captain appears (Pete) and angrily orders Mickey off the bridge. Mickey makes a Bronx cheer (blows a raspberryhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowing_a_raspberry) at Pete, and then Pete kicks him, making him fall down the stairs, slip on a bar of soap on the boat's deck and land in a bucket of water. A parrot makes fun of him, and Mickey throws the bucket over the bird.
Now piloting the steamboat himself, Pete bites off some chewing tobacco and spits into the wind. The spit flies backward and rings the boat's bell. Amused by this Pete spits again, but it hits him in the face.
The steamboat makes a stop at "Podunk Landing" to pick up a cargo of various livestock. Just as they set off again, Minnie appears, running to catch the boat before it leaves. Mickey does not see her in time, but she runs after the boat along the shore and Mickey takes her on board using the cargo crane.
Landing on deck, Minnie accidentally drops a guitar and some sheet music for the song "Turkey in the Straw" which are eaten by a goat. The two mice use the goat's body as a phonograph which they play by turning the animal's tail like a crank. Mickey uses various objects on the boat as percussion accompaniment and "plays" the animals like musical instruments.http://books.google.com/books?id=cDk8d2UMRLwC&pg=PA86&dq=%22Steamboat+Willie%22+%22turkey+in+the+straw%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=d-DQT-iALcOg2AXYi8jEDA&ved=0CGgQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22Steamboat%20Willie%22%20%22turkey%20in%20the%20straw%22&f=falsehttp://books.google.com/books?id=8-EEANKOC6kC&pg=PA832&dq=%22Steamboat+Willie%22+%22turkey+in+the+straw%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=d-DQT-iALcOg2AXYi8jEDA&ved=0CGQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22Steamboat%20Willie%22%20%22turkey%20in%20the%20straw%22&f=falsehttp://books.google.com/books?id=iOGW56Q5uToC&pg=PA9&dq=%22Steamboat+Willie%22+%22turkey+in+the+straw%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=d-DQT-iALcOg2AXYi8jEDA&ved=0CFwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22Steamboat%20Willie%22%20%22turkey%20in%20the%20straw%22&f=false
Finally Captain Pete appears and puts Mickey to work peeling potatoes. In the potato bin, the same parrot from before appears in the port hole and mocks Mickey again. The mouse throws a partially peeled potato at him, knocking him into the river below. The film ends with Mickey laughing at the sound of the bird struggling in the water.

==Background==

According to Roy O. Disney, Walt Disney was inspired to create a sound cartoon after watching The Jazz Singer (1927). Disney had intended for Mickey Mouse to be the new star character to replace Oswald the Lucky Rabbit after he lost the rights to the character to Charles Mintz. However the first two Mickey Mouse films produced, silent versions of Plane Crazy and The Gallopin' Gaucho, had failed to impress audiences and gain a distributor. Disney believed that adding sound to a cartoon would greatly increase its appeal.
Steamboat Willie was not the first cartoon with synchronized sound. Dave and Max Fleischer's Inkwell Studios had earlier produced seven sound cartoons, part of the Song Car-Tunes which started in May 1924. However the Song Car-Tunes failed to keep the sound fully synchronized, while Steamboat Willie was produced using a click track to keep his musicians on the beat.[tpl]cite book|last=Finch|first=Christopher|title=The Art of Walt Disney from Mickey Mouse to the Magic Kingdom|year=1995|publisher=Harry N. Abrahms, Inc., Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-2702-0|pages=23[/tpl]  As little as one month before Steamboat Willie was released, Paul Terry released Dinner Time which also used a soundtrack, but Dinner Time was not a financial success.
In June 1927, producer Pat Powers made an unsuccessful takeover bid for Lee DeForest's Phonofilm Corporation. In the aftermath, Powers hired a former DeForest technician, William Garrity, to produce a cloned version of the Phonofilm system, which Powers dubbed "Powers Cinephone". By then, DeForest was in too weak a financial position to mount a legal challenge against Powers for patent infringement. Powers convinced Disney to use Cinephone for Steamboat Willie before Powers and Disney had a falling-out over money, and over Powers hiring away Disney animator Ub Iwerks in 1930.

==Production==

The production of Steamboat Willie took place between July and September 1928 with an estimated budget of $4,986. There was initially some doubt among the animators that a sound cartoon would appear believable enough, so before a soundtrack was produced, Disney arranged for a screening of the film to a test audience with live sound to accompany it.[tpl]cite book|last=Fanning|first=Jim|title=Walt Disney|year=1994|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|isbn=9780791023310[/tpl]  This screening took place on July 29 with Steamboat Willie only partly finished. The audience sat in a room adjoining Walt's office. Roy placed the movie projector outdoors and the film was projected through a window so that the sound of the projector would not interfere with the live sound. Ub Iwerks set up a bed sheet behind the movie screen behind which he placed a microphone connected to speakers where the audience would sit. The live sound was produced from behind the bed sheet. Wilfred Jackson played the music on a mouth organ, Ub Iwerks banged on pots and pans for the percussion segment, Johnny Cannon provided sound effects with various devices including slide whistles and spittoons for bells. Walt himself provided what little dialogue there was to the film, mostly grunts, laughs, and squawks. After several practices, they were ready for the audience which consisted of Disney employees and their wives.
The response of the audience was extremely positive, and it gave Walt the confidence to move forward and complete the film. He said later in recalling this first viewing, "The effect on our little audience was nothing less than electric. They responded almost instinctively to this union of sound and motion. I thought they were kidding me. So they put me in the audience and ran the action again. It was terrible, but it was wonderful! And it was something new!" Iwerks said, "I've never been so thrilled in my life. Nothing since has ever equaled it."The Test Screening of Steamboat Willie
Walt traveled to New York City to hire a company to produce the sound system. He eventually settled on Pat Powers's Cinephone system, created by Powers using an updated version of Lee De Forest's Phonofilm system without giving De Forest any credit, a decision he would later regret.
The music in the final soundtrack was performed by the Green Brothers Novelty Band and was conducted by Carl Edouarde. The brothers Joe and Lew Green from the band also assisted in timing the music to the film. The first attempt to synchronize the recording with the film was a disaster. Disney had to sell his Moon roadster in order to finance a second recording. This was a success with the addition of a filmed bouncing ball to keep the tempo.Steamboat Willie at The Encyclopedia of Disney Animated Shorts

==Release and reception==

Steamboat Willie premiered at Universal's Colony Theater in New York City on November 18, 1928.Broadway Theater Broadway | The Shubert Organization 1691 Broadway, between 52nd and 53rd streets, now The Broadway Theater. The film was distributed by Celebrity Productions and its initial run lasted two weeks. Disney was paid $500 a week which was considered a large amount at the time. It played ahead of the independent feature film Gang War. Steamboat Willie was an immediate hit while Gang War is all but forgotten today.
The success of Steamboat Willie not only led to international fame for Walt Disney, but for Mickey as well. On November 21, Variety magazine published a review which read in part "Not the first animated cartoon to be synchronized with sound effects, but the first to attract favorable attention. Willie'' represents a high order of cartoon ingenuity, cleverly combined with sound effects. The union brought laughs galore. Giggles came so fast at the Colony Theater they were stumbling over each other."
The response led to the two previous Mickey films to be reproduced as sound cartoons and given wide theatrical releases.

==Copyright status==

The film has been the center of a variety of controversies regarding copyright. The copyright of the film has been repeatedly extended by acts of the United States Congress. However, recent evidence suggests that the film may be in the public domain due to technicalities related to the original copyright notice.
The film has been the center of some attention regarding the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act passed in the United States. Steamboat Willie has been close to entering the public domain in the U.S. several times. Each time, copyright protection has been extended. It could have entered public domain in 4 different years; first in 1956, renewed to 1984, then to 2003 by the Copyright Act of 1976, and finally to the current public domain date of 2023 by the Copyright Term Extension Act (also known pejoratively as the "Mickey Mouse Protection Act")Lawrence Lessig, Copyright's First Amendment, 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1057, 1065 (2001) of 1998. The U.S. copyright on Steamboat Willie will be in effect through 2023 unless there is another extension of the law.
It has been claimedLessig, Free Culture, p. 220 that these extensions were a response by the Congress to extensive lobbying by The Walt Disney Company.
In the 1990s, former Disney researcher Gregory S. Brown determined that the film was likely in U.S. public domain already due to errors in the original copyright formulation.[tpl]cite news |first=Joseph |last=Menn |title=Disney's rights to young Mickey Mouse may be wrong |url=http://articles.latimes.com/p/2008/aug/22/business/fi-mickey22 |publisher=Los Angeles Times  |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2014-02-08  [/tpl] In particular, the original film's copyright notice had two additional names between Disney and the copyright statement. Thus, under the rules of the Copyright Act of 1909, all copyright claims would be null. Arizona State University professor Dennis Karjala suggested that one of his law school students look into Brown's claim as a class project. Lauren Vanpelt took up the challenge and produced a paper agreeing with Brown's claim. She posted her project on the Web in 1999.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~dkarjala/publicdomain/Vanpelt-s99.html |title=Mickey Mouse -- A Truly Public Character |accessdate=2008-08-22 |first=Lauren|last=Vanpelt |date=Spring 1999 |work= |publisher= [/tpl] Disney later threatened to sue a Georgetown University law student who wrote a paper confirming Brown's claims.[tpl]cite journal |last= Hedenkamp|first= Douglas A. |title= Free Mickey Mouse: Copyright Notice, Derivative Works, and the Copyright Act of 1909 (Spring, 2003)|journal=Virginia Sports & Entertainment Law Journal |issue=2 [/tpl]2 Va.
