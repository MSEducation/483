Josiah Hasbrouck (March 5, 1755 – March 19, 1821) was a United States Representative from New York. Born in New Paltz, he completed preparatory studies and conducted a general merchandising business. He was a second lieutenant in the Third Regiment of Ulster County Militia in 1780, and was supervisor of New Paltz from 1784 to 1786 and in 1793, 1794, and 1799 to 1805. He was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1796, 1797, 1802, and 1806.
Hasbrouck was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Eighth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of John Cantine and served from April 28, 1803, to March 3, 1805. He engaged in agricultural pursuits, and was then elected to the Fifteenth Congress (March 4, 1817 – March 3, 1819), during which he was chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of State. He died near Plattekill. Original interment was in the family burial ground; reinterment was in New Paltz Rural Cemetery, New Paltz.
Locust Lawn, his Federal style-home during his last years, is a Registered Historic Place, located along NY 32 in what is today the town of Gardiner, just south of New Paltz. The house, which is owned and operated as a house museum by Historic Huguenot Street boasts an outstanding collection of original furnishings and interior mouldings, and is open to the public on weekends from June through October.
