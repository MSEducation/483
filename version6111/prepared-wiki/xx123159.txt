[[Río Santa Rosalía]]

Modern-day Río Santa Rosalía in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur was originally named Río Santa Rosalía de Mulegé, the same name given to the Spanish mission in the town of Mulegé.  The river enters the Sea of Cortez (or Gulf of California.)   The name of the river has been shortened to Río Santa Rosalía, and likewise the name of the town has been reduced to simply "Mulegé."  Another city grew about 30 miles north of Mulegé because of a large copper mining operation.  This city borrowed the name Santa Rosalía and it is likely for this reason that "Santa Rosalía de" was dropped from the name Mulegé.
