Brethren is a name adopted by a wide range of mainly Christian religious groups throughout history which do not necessarily share historical roots, including some of the earliest primitive churches, the Paulician Brethren, the Bogomil Brethren, the Brethren of the Free Spirit, the Schwarzenau Brethren and some Anabaptist groups, the Moravian Brethren, and the Plymouth Brethren, among many others.

These groups grew out of the Anabaptist movement at the time of the Protestant Reformation (16th century).

The group split into three wings in 1881â€“1883:

The various Plymouth Brethren bodies originated in the 1820s work of John Nelson Darby and others in Ireland and the United Kingdom as well as India:

==Methodist groups==
