</ref> Unconfirmed planetary systems include the [[Epsilon Eridani]] system at 10.5ly from Earth and the [[Tau Ceti]] system at 11.905ly, both believed to have multiple detected planets.

====Red dwarf systems====

Red dwarf systems orbit red dwarfs, stars which may represent 70% to more than 90% of the stars in the galaxy.  The Gliese 876 was the first such system discovered in 1998.
Most planets of these systems are thought to be tidally locked.  This and high stellar variation are postulated to be major impediments to planetary habitability.  Gliese 581 is another well known red dwarf system which is speculated to have multiple planets within the habitable zone.

===Brown dwarf systems===

Brown dwarf planetary system orbit brown dwarfs.  2M1207, the first planetary system to be imaged, was also the first such system discovered.
Some companions of brown dwarfs, such as those of 2M1207 and GQ Lupi, are thought to have formed by cloud collapse rather than accretion, and hence these are sometimes considered sub-brown dwarfs rather than planets.
Disks around brown dwarfs have been found to have many of the same features as disks around stars; therefore, it is expected that there will be accretion-formed planets around brown dwarfs.The onset of planet formation in brown dwarf disks, Dániel Apai, Ilaria Pascucci, Jeroen Bouwman, Antonella Natta, Thomas Henning, Cornelis P. Dullemond Given the small mass of brown dwarf disks, most planets will be terrestrial planets rather than gas giants.Tidal evolution of planets around brown dwarfs, E. Bolmont, S. N. Raymond, and J. Leconte, 2011
It is now believed that many brown dwarfs may have planets and also, possibly, a shortly lived habitable zone.  Most planets of these systems are thought to be tidally locked.

===Sub-brown dwarf (rogue) systems===

Rogue systems are systems that are not gravitationally bound to any star. It is theorised that objects ejected from a planetary system could retain a system of satellites. These types of system have galactic rather than stellar orbits. Others still may yet be found moving freely in intergalactic space,http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120430140033.htm though it is unclear whether such systems could be sustained. Some astronomers have estimated that there may be twice as many Jupiter-sized rogue planets as there are stars. Isolated planetary-mass objects that were not ejected from a star's orbit may have formed in a similar way to stars. The IAU has proposed that those objects be called sub-brown dwarfs.
Cha 110913-773444 is an example of a rogue system with a protoplanetary disk speculated to contain as many as 4 satellites.  It is unknown whether it is ejected planet, or formed on its own.

===Pulsar systems===

Pulsar systems orbit pulsars, or rapidly rotating neutron stars.  PSR B1257+12 was not only the first pulsar exoplanetary system but also the first planetary system discovered.  PSR B1620-26 is also confirmed, however many other pulsar systems remain unconfirmed.
The formation of pulsar systems is still the subject of research.  It is thought that planets form from the debris of companion stars.

===Multi-star systems===

Multiple star systems, including binary stars are abundant in the Milky Way and several are now known to possess planetary systems.  The discovery of such systems however creates new challenges on theories on planetary system formation.
Prior to the groundbreaking 1993 discovery of the first known planet PSR B1620-26 b in the binary system PSR B1620-26, the possibility of the existence of such systems was long theorised and debated.  Chinese-American astrophysicist Su-Shu Huang had dampened expectations of planets forming or remaining in such systems in his 1959 paper "Life-Supporting Regions in the Vicinity of Binary Systems" claiming that due to orbital instability planets and in particular habitable planets would likely be rare.Su-Shu Huang. Life-Supporting Regions in the Vicinity of Binary System. Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, Vol. 72, No. 425, p.106  The film Star Wars, however captured the imagination of popular culture with its "twin sun" scene on Tatooine.  PSR B1620-26 was not only the first binary system (and multistar system) found with a planet but the first found in which the planet orbited both stars (i.e. in circumbinary orbit, a circumbinary planet).
16 Cygni, discovered in 1996 was the first confirmed triple star planetary system found however the planet orbits just one of the stars – 16 Cygni B.  In 2011, the Kepler-16 system was found to have a circumbinary planet within its habitable zone,[tpl]cite web|last=Harwood |first=William |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-19514_3-20106952-239/nasa-spots-first-planet-in-binary-star-system/ |title=NASA spots first planet in binary star system | The Space Shot – CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2012-08-17[/tpl] leading to the Smithsonian Center informally referring to it as "Tatooine" in reference to Star Wars.[tpl]cite news|last=Jaggard|first=Victoria|title="Tatooine" Planet With Two Suns Could Host Habitable Moon?|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/01/120109-earthlike-planets-moons-nasa-kepler-16b-space-science/|newspaper=National Geographic|date=January 9, 2012[/tpl]
This type of planetary system is of particular interest due to Alpha Centauri A being the closest main-sequence star to Earth but also a binary (Alpha Centauri AB) contained within a triple star system. The notion of planets in the Centauri system has been a popular theme in fiction.  In 2012 Alpha Centauri B was found to have an Earth-sized planet in orbit around it, increasing expectations of more terrestrial planet discoveries in this and similar systems.
PH1, confirmed in 2012, is the first quadruple star planetary system confirmed.[tpl]cite news|title=Astronomers discover 'Star Wars' planet with four suns|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/astronomers-discover-star-wars-planet-with-four-suns-20121017-27pzd.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=October 17, 2012[/tpl] NN Serpentis and HW Virginis are notable multi-planet multi-star systems.

===Transiting systems===

Transiting planetary systems are those with multiple planets in orbital planes along the line of sight between their star the observer.  The transit method is one of the most successful observation methods. The Kepler mission was designed to discover systems of this type and has found numerous candidate systems. Kepler-11 is a prominent example of a transiting system in which multiple simultaneous planetary transits have been observed.
Transiting systems can be studied to not only discover planets, but through Astronomical spectroscopy and Transit timing effects accurately analyse the properties of the systems including the detection of extraterrestrial atmospheres, dust or asteroid belts and possibly natural satellites.
