SmarTrip is a contact-less stored-value smart card payment system managed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Unlike traditional paper farecards or bus passes, SmarTrip is designed to be permanent and reloadable. The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) uses a compatible payment system called CharmCard. A reciprocity agreement between the MTA and WMATA allows either card to be used for travel on any of the participating transit systems in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area.
WMATA began using SmarTrip for payment on Metrorail in 1999 followed shortly by Metrobus and Metro parking lots. It was later extended to other public transit systems throughout the region. SmarTrip users receive discounts on Metrorail and Metrobus fares. Although WMATA initially drew criticism due to the limited number of SmarTrip sales locations, distribution has expanded to local convenience stores and supermarkets. By late 2012 all Metrorail stations were equipped with SmarTrip vending machines.[tpl]cite news |title=All Metro stations now have SmarTrip vending machines |first=Luz |last=Lazo |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/all-metro-stations-now-have-smartrip-vending-machines/2012/11/06/8981778e-284c-11e2-b4e0-346287b7e56c_story.html |newspaper=Washington Post |date=2012-11-06[/tpl]
In October 2010, WMATA announced that it was working on a replacement system because the company that makes SmarTrip cards has since gone out of business. However, the transit agency found an alternate manufacturer to produce additional cards until a new payment system is introduced.[tpl]cite news|last=Weir|first=Kytja|title=Metro to get new, cheaper SmarTrip cards this fall|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/local/transportation/2012/05/metro-get-new-cheaper-smartrip-cards-fall/663481|accessdate=29 May 2012|newspaper=Washington Examiner|date=28 May 2012[/tpl]

==Overview==

SmarTrip cards are 3⅜ by 2⅛ inches (85.7 mm × 54.0 mm), roughly the same size as a credit card or driver’s license.  The card is touched to a circular target on the top or side of each fare gate rather than inserted into a slot, affording some speed and convenience over the paper farecard.  Additionally, it is usually not necessary to remove the card from a wallet or purse before touching the SmarTrip target.  In the Metrorail system, touching the card to the target will display the value remaining as the fare gate opens, both when entering and exiting.  On Metrobuses, the farebox will audibly beep and display the value.  In all cases, the appropriate fare is deducted automatically, accounting for any applicable transfers and discounts.
In an effort to reduce fraud and waste, Metro announced in October 2008 that it would be eliminating paper bus transfers effective January 4, 2009. All riders who wished to take advantage of reduced-fare transfers were required to pay using SmarTrip.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/faqs/preview.cfm?faqID=47|title=Elimination of paper transfers in January 2009 FAQ|publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|accessdate=2008-11-19[/tpl] Paper bus passes were eliminated in January 2011 and are now only available on SmarTrip.[tpl]cite press release|title=Bus passes available on SmarTrip® starting October 17|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=4686|publisher=WMATA|date=October 12, 2010[/tpl]
All Metrorail passes are now available (and, except the One-Day, only available) on SmarTrip. These include One-Day, 7-Day, and 28-Day fast passes valid for unlimited travel on Metrorail. A 7-Day Short Trip Pass is also sold, allowing unlimited off-peak rides, and unlimited peak rides for trips costing up to $3.50, with the difference in fare deducted from the stored value on the card if necessary. Metro also sells SmarTrip cards that are preloaded with a One-Day rail pass online for the same price as just the pass alone ($14 since July 1, 2012), including all of the commemorative SmarTrip cards issued since 2009.
The cards can be purchased at vending machines within all Metrorail stations, at Metro sales offices, selected retail stores, and online. The purchase price includes $2 for the card itself plus an initial fare value, which varies depending on where they are purchased: cards purchased at stations cost $10 ($2 for the card and $8 fare value), while those purchased online cost either $10 or $30 ($2 for the card and $8 or $28 fare value). The cards can be reloaded using farecard vending machines or using cash at fareboxes onboard buses. Riders may also add value to their SmarTrip cards by trading in paper farecards (a used farecard up to $20, or an unused farecard of any value). SmarTrip can store up to $300 in value.
“Exit fare” machines (used with paper farecards) previously did not accept SmarTrip, and riders with insufficient value to pay their fare were allowed to exit the system with a negative balance. This negative balance must, however, be paid before the card may be used again to enter the system. In addition, the card must contain sufficient value to pay the full fee in order to exit a Metro parking lot or board a Ride On bus. Because SmarTrip owners were allowed to exit the system with an unlimited negative balance, the Metro Board had previously rejected proposals to reduce the price of SmarTrip cards from $5 down to $2.50.[tpl]cite web|last=Jamieson|first=Dave|title=Metro meeting: SmarTrip issue tabled, Blue/Orange work moves ahead, extra security added to bus depots|url=http://www.tbd.com/blogs/tbd-on-foot/2010/10/metro-meeting-smartrip-issue-tabled-blue-orange-work-moves-ahead-extra-security-added-to-bus-terminals-3114.html|work=TBD.com|accessdate=20 May 2012|date=October 14, 2010[/tpl]
Starting September 1, 2012, Metro began offering $3 rebates to customers who registered their cards online after purchase. The cards still cost $5, but a $3 credit was refunded to the card five days after first use. Also starting Sept. 1, riders have been required to have a minimum balance of $1.20 on their SmarTrip cards (35¢ for half-fare senior/disabled cards) in order to enter the Metrorail system, which reduced the possible negative balance upon exit.
Effective October 1, 2013, the price of the card was reduced to $2, the rebate program was discontinued, and the maximum permitted negative balance upon exit was set at $1.50, with riders who would exceed this being required to use the Exitfare machines to add value to their cards.
SmarTrip cards comply with the ISO/IEC 14443 Type B standard.[tpl]cite web | title = Contactless Payment and the Retail Point of Sale|publisher = Smart Card Alliance  |url=http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~tijo/seminar/Contactless_Pmt_Report.pdf|page=9|format=PDF| date=March 2003|accessdate=2011-05-24 [/tpl] A microchip contained within the card stores its value, as well as the rider’s most recent entry and exit points, and a unique identifier. However, the unique identifier is not linked to a person’s name or identity, unless one registers the card online. Registering SmarTrip cards allows riders to recover their remaining balance (minus a $5 replacement fee), should the card be lost, stolen, or damaged. The unique identifier also allows workers enrolled in the SmartBenefits program, which allows employers to subsidize employee transportation costs tax-free, to credit their monthly benefits to their cards.
The SmarTrip system was built and designed by Cubic Transportation Systems, Inc., a subsidiary of San Diego-based Cubic Corporation.  As of October 2010 Cubic is reportedly no longer producing the cards. In December 2010, WMATA issued a request for proposals for a replacement system. The new payment system is expected to use federal employee badges and certain smart phones in addition to the stored value cards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=4783|title=Metro seeking next generation fare payment system|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=April 21, 2011[/tpl] In May 2012, the transit agency announced that it had found a replacement manufacturer for SmarTrip cards to avoid shortages until a new payment system goes into place. Customers will likely not notice any differences except that the new cards are slightly thinner and cheaper to produce.

==History==

SmarTrip was the first contact-less smart card for transit in the United States[tpl]cite web| url = http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/11203/a-brief-history-of-metrorail-fare-collection/| title = A Brief History of Metrorail Fare Collection| publisher = Greater Greater Washington| author= Raschke, Kurt| accessdate = 2011-07-08[/tpl] when WMATA began selling SmarTrip cards on May 18, 1999.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/docs/history.pdf| title = WMATA History| format = PDF| publisher = WMATA| accessdate = 2011-04-26[/tpl] By 2004, 650,000 SmarTrip cards were in circulation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smartcardalliance.org/newsletter/september_04/feature_0904.html|title=Smart Card Talk|date=September 2004|publisher=Smart Card Alliance|accessdate=2011-04-26[/tpl] On November 12, 2002, the first SmarTrip readers were used on Metrobuses. In May 2004, SmarTrip readers were introduced at parking garage gates. In December 2010, 1,800,000 SmarTrip cards were in use.[tpl]cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/dr-gridlock/2010/12/metro_seeks_vendor_for_new_far.htm|title=Metro seeks SmarTrip replacement|date=December 30, 2010|publisher=Washington Post|first=Ann Scott |last=Tyson|accessdate=2011-05-24[/tpl] In February 2011, WMATA replaced the antennas on all Metrorail faregates to improve the speed and range of its the faregates' SmarTrip processing.[tpl]cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/dr-gridlock/2011/02/_metro_is_installing_new.html|title=Domes aim to make SmarTrip faster|first=Ann Scott |last=Tyson|date=February 9, 2011|work=Washington Post|accessdate=2011-04-26[/tpl]
In May 2011, WMATA and the District of Columbia Department of Transportation started a pilot project to give students in the DC Public Schools "DC One Cards" which are SmarTrip compatible. The new cards serve as both a student identification card and provide reduced Metro fares during student commuting hours. The cards are intended to address youth behavior problems in Metrorail stations.[tpl]cite news|work=Washington Post|title=D.C. to test new Metro ID cards for students|first=Lori|last=Aratani|date=May 4, 2011|page=B1[/tpl]

==Design==

On the front of the standard SmarTrip card is a stylized picture of a Metrorail car and Metrobus in front of representations of the Washington Monument, United States Capitol, and stylized versions of classical architecture found in Washington, D.C. The Metro logo appears in the bottom left. A "Senior" SmarTrip is also available that automatically calculates applicable discounted fares for senior citizens (age 65+). The design is identical to the standard SmarTrip except that the card is printed in shades of bright yellow and brown, instead of blue and green. Since the Senior SmarTrip allows for discounted fares, the card may only be purchased in person with a valid ID from a Metro sales office or authorized vendor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/fares/smartrip/senior.cfm|title=Metro Senior SmarTrip Card |publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|accessdate=2008-11-21[/tpl]
The first two promotional SmarTrip cards were issued in 2008 to commemorate the opening of the newly built stadium of the Washington Nationals, Nationals Park. Special SmarTrip cards commemorating the inauguration of President Barack Obama were issued in January 2009 and 2013.[tpl]cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/campaigns/administration/40683-obamas-mug-on-dc-subway-cards-for-inauguration/|title=Obama's Mug on D.C. Subway Cards for Inauguration|last=Alarkon|first=Walter|date=2008-11-20|work=The Hill|accessdate=2008-11-21[/tpl]  In July 2013, a special July 4 commemorative SmarTrip card was introduced.

==Criticism==

An early criticism of the SmarTrip cards had been that they were only sold at suburban Metrorail stations, online, a few selected retailers, and Metro sales offices. However, in 2008, Metro reached an agreement with CVS/pharmacy to sell the cards at 187 DC-area locations in an effort to increase SmarTrip use.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wmata.com/board_gm/board_docs/112008_Admin4100208CVSSellSmarTrip.pdf|format=PDF|title=Indemnify CVS/pharmacy for selling SmarTrip Cards|publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|accessdate=2008-11-19[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2009[/tpl] The SmarTrip cards are also sold at area grocery store chains.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/fares/smartrip/smartrip_load.cfm?|title=SmarTrip Retail Outlets: Purchase Cards and Add Value |publisher=WMATA |accessdate=April 21, 2011[/tpl] In late 2012 WMATA installed SmarTrip vending machines at all Metrorail stations.
A number of SmarTrip features that were supposed to be introduced in 2005 by SmarTrip's creator, Cubic Transportation Systems, were not fully implemented until 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/docs/CubicReportFinal.pdf|format=PDF|title=Final Contract Audit Report with Recommendations|date=2008-02-19|publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|accessdate=2008-11-19[/tpl] Initially, riders could only add value to a SmarTrip card at Metrorail stations or by using cash while boarding a Metrobus. In November 2008, after years of delays, WMATA announced that customers would have the ability to add funds to their SmarTrip cards online by September 2009, but that deadline was missed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/board_of_directors/board_docs/110608_SmarTripupdaterev1.pdf|format=PDF|title=SmarTrip Program Update|date=2008-11-06|publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|accessdate=2008-11-19[/tpl] WMATA did launch SmarTrip's online reload feature in September 2011.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=5042 |title=Metro launches SmarTrip® Online Reload |publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority |date=2011-09-22[/tpl] WMATA allowed customers to load a seven-day unlimited Metrorail pass to their SmarTrip cards in April 2012.[tpl]cite press release|title=Metro introduces unlimited 7-day rail pass on SmarTrip®|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=5199|publisher=WMATA|date=April 16, 2012[/tpl]
All trips made with a SmarTrip card, with the exception of bus transfers and passes, are charged as individual one-way fares. WMATA offers discounted rail and bus passes to customers who make several trips in one day, or many trips, or many short trips, in a seven-day period; however, SmarTrip users can only use the 7-day unlimited pass, and must manually load each transit pass onto their SmarTrip cards. This is in contrast to the Oyster card system on the London Underground, for example, where fares are automatically capped to ensure that customers never pay more than the cost of a one-day pass each day.[tpl]cite web|title=Daily price capping|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tickets/14837.aspx|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=20 May 2012[/tpl]
There have been complaints when customers' cards cease to work as a result of placing the card in proximity to metal or physically damaging the card. In such cases Metro guarantees that the fund balance on the card will be transferred to a new card. However, customers have complained that WMATA has not been processing such balance transfers promptly.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.myfoxdc.com/dpp/traffic/metro_news/inoperable-metro-smartrip-card-causes-trouble-for-udc-student-030111|title=Inoperable Metro SmarTrip Card Causes Trouble For UDC Student|date=March 2, 2011|publisher=Fox 5 News|first=Stacey |last=Cohan|accessdate=April 22, 2011[/tpl]

===Parking===

In a controversial move, WMATA announced that as part of a new cashless parking payment system, SmarTrip would be the only way to pay for parking at Metro-operated garages and lots effective June 28, 2004, after reports of widespread theft by Metro's parking contractor, Penn Parking.[tpl]cite web|date = 2004-05-30| url = http://thisweek.cua.edu/archive_view.cfm?issue=94| title = For Your Benefit: Metrorail SmarTrip Cards| work = This Week @ CUA| publisher = Catholic University of America| accessdate = 2007-06-13[/tpl]
The decision prompted complaints that Metro was inconveniencing its many customers, including tourists and other infrequent users, who did not own a SmarTrip card. In April 2007, WMATA began testing the use of credit cards to pay for parking at six Metro stations, avoiding the need to pay for parking with SmarTrip cards at those stations. The sites are Anacostia on the Green Line, Shady Grove on the Red Line, Vienna and New Carrollton on the Orange Line, and Franconia-Springfield and Largo Town Center on the Blue Line.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.wusa9.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=57059| title = Metro Unveils Credit Card Parking Lot Payment Pilot Program|publisher = WUSA-TV| date = 2007-03-29| accessdate = 2007-06-13[/tpl] One exit lane at each station accepts credit card payments through a reader next to the existing SmarTrip card target.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.wmata.com/rail/parking/| title = Parking at Metrorail Stations| publisher = Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority| accessdate = 2008-12-11[/tpl] WMATA has since announced that it will make at least one credit card exit lane available at all Metro pay-on-exit parking facilities.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=4733 |title=Metro installing credit card payment readers to make parking more convenient |publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority |date=November 8, 2010 |accessdate=November 19, 2010[/tpl]

==Participating systems==

The following is a list of transit systems that accept the SmarTrip card for payment. The Maryland Transit Administration’s CharmCard uses a compatible payment system from the same manufacturer. A reciprocity agreement allows patrons to use either payment card to travel on any of the participating systems throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/20/AR2010092005782.html|title=Maryland answers SmarTrip with CharmCard|first=Kafia|last=Hosh|publisher=Washington Post|date=2010-09-21|page=B8|location=Baltimore, Maryland|accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl]
 Virginia Regional Transit (VRT), a separate bus service which also serves Loudoun County, does not participate in SmarTrip.
