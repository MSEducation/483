[[CNO cycle]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear fusion

The CNO cycle (for carbon–nitrogen–oxygen) is one of two sets of fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium, the other being the proton–proton chain reaction. Unlike the latter, the CNO cycle is a catalytic cycle. Theoretical models[tpl]which|date=June 2013[/tpl] show that the CNO cycle is the dominant source of energy in stars more massive than about 1.3 times the mass of the Sun. The proton–proton chain is more important in stars the mass of the Sun or less. This difference stems from temperature dependency differences between the two reactions; pp-chain reactions start occurring at temperatures around [tpl]val|4|e=6|ul=K[/tpl][ref]
</ref> (4 megakelvins), making it the dominant energy source in smaller stars. A self-maintaining CNO chain starts occurring at approximately [tpl]val|15|ul=MK[/tpl], but its energy output rises much more rapidly with increasing temperatures.<ref name=salaris_cassini2005>
</ref> At approximately [tpl]val|17|u=MK[/tpl], the CNO cycle starts becoming the dominant source of energy.<ref>

[/ref] The Sun has a core temperature of around [tpl]val|15.7|u=MK[/tpl],  and only [tpl]val|1.7|s=%[/tpl] of [tpl]SimpleNuclide2|Helium|4|link=yes[/tpl] nuclei being produced in the Sun are born in the CNO cycle. The CNO-I process was independently proposed by Carl von Weizsäcker and Hans Bethe in 1938 and 1939, respectively.
In the CNO cycle, four protons fuse, using carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotopes as a catalyst, to produce one alpha particle, two positrons and two electron neutrinos.  Although there are various paths and catalysts involved in the CNO cycles, simply speaking all these cycles have the same net result:
The positrons will almost instantly annihilate with electrons, releasing energy in the form of gamma rays. The neutrinos escape from the star carrying away some energy. One nucleus goes to become carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes through a number of transformations in an endless loop.

==Cold CNO cycles==

Under typical conditions found in stellar plasmas, catalytic hydrogen burning by the CNO cycles is limited by proton captures.  Specifically, the timescale for beta decay of radioactive nuclei produced is faster than the timescale for fusion.  Because of the long timescales involved, the cold CNO cycles convert hydrogen to helium slowly, allowing them to power stars in quiescent equilibrium for many years.

===CNO-I===

The first proposed catalytic cycle for the conversion of hydrogen into helium was at first simply called the carbon–nitrogen cycle (CN cycle), also honorarily referred to as the Bethe–Weizsäcker cycle, because it does not involve a stable isotope of oxygen.  Bethe's original calculations suggested the CN-cycle was the Sun's primary source of energy, owing to the belief at the time that the Sun's composition was 10% nitrogen; the solar abundance of nitrogen is now known to be less than half a percent.  This cycle is now recognized as the first part of the larger CNO nuclear burning network.  The main reactions of the CNO-I cycle are [tpl]Nuclide2|carbon|12|link=yes[/tpl]→[tpl]Nuclide2|nitrogen|13|link=yes[/tpl]→[tpl]Nuclide2|carbon|13|link=yes[/tpl]→[tpl]Nuclide2|nitrogen|14|link=yes[/tpl]→[tpl]Nuclide2|oxygen|15|link=yes[/tpl]→[tpl]Nuclide2|nitrogen|15|link=yes[/tpl]→[tpl]Nuclide2|carbon|12[/tpl]:

where the Carbon-12 nucleus used in the first reaction is regenerated in the last reaction.  After the two positrons emitted annihilate with two ambient electrons producing an additional 2.04 MeV, the total energy released in one cycle is 26.73 MeV; it should be noted that in some texts, authors are erroneously including the positron annihilation energy in with the beta-decay Q-value and then neglecting the equal amount of energy released by annihilation, leading to possible confusion.  All values are calculated with reference to the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2003.[tpl]cite web |url=http://amdc.in2p3.fr/web/masseval.html |title=The 2003 Atomic Mass Evaluation |last1=Wapstra |first1=Aaldert |last2=Audi |first2=Georges |date=18 November 2003 |publisher=Atomic Mass Data Center |accessdate=25 October 2011 [/tpl]
The limiting (slowest) reaction in the CNO-I cycle is the proton capture on [tpl]Nuclide2|nitrogen|14[/tpl]; it was recently experimentally measured down to stellar energies, revising the calculated age of globular clusters by around 1 billion years.
The neutrinos emitted in beta decay will have a spectrum of energy ranges, because although momentum is conserved, the momentum can be shared in any way between the positron and neutrino, with either being emitted at rest and the other taking away the full energy, or anything in between, so long as all the energy from the Q-value is used.  All momentum which get the electron and the neutrino together is not great enough to cause a significant recoil of the much heavier daughter nucleus
