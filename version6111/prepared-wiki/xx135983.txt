==Common business capabilities==

===Expertise location===

Expertise-location capability provides corporations with the ability to solve business problems that are difficult to articulate or communicate explicitly and that involve highly skilled people.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]  Dynamic people-profiles and -searches are increasingly[tpl]quantify|date=November 2010[/tpl] seen as integral components of a support environment that encourages unplanned collaboration and informal interactions as effective ways to solve business problems. Expertise location increases productivity and organizational success by identifying the status and location of human expertise in globally dispersed and increasingly virtual organizations.  Publishing of  employee profiles and searches against those profiles are increasingly seen by strategists as integral components of a business process that encourages unplanned collaboration and informal interactions as effective ways to solve business problems.by The Social Workplace
Social network tools help managers find the right person or group for the appropriate task.

===Corporate blogging===

Like personal blogs, corporate blogs use blogging technology - in this case for leadership messages, online journals and knowledge-management forums.  Google Inc. and Facebook, Inc. pioneered this practice within their own corporations.  Instead of a flashy launch event or a press conference, corporations have started to use internal and external corporate blogs.http://www.masternewmedia.org/business-applications-of-social-media-inside-organizations-an-overview By MasterNewMedia  Corporate blogs are becoming a part of the standard set of corporate communication tools and the emerging portfolio of social-media tools. Features like tags and rating help corporate employees find content and make judgments about policies or procedures.

===Corporate wikis===

Corporate wikis provide an easy-to-use environment for subject-matter experts to publish their interpretation on any subject.  A corporate wiki can capture corporate acronyms.  Large corporations create a roll-up wiki so that individual divisions have the flexibility to add items to their wiki and make a decision on which items should roll up to the corporate level.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2007/tc20070312_740461.htm |title=No Rest for the Wiki |publisher=Businessweek |date=2007-03-12 |accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl]
Wikis, like blogs, provide platforms for collaborating and communication.

===Internal community platforms===

Internal community platforms provide an environment for corporate employees to create a virtual forum to share their opinions, knowledge and subject-matter expertise on topics of interest.  Usually[tpl]quantify|date=November 2010[/tpl] community platforms center around a particular topic of interest.  Generally[tpl]quantify|date=November 2010[/tpl] the community participates in an unstructured exchange of ideas which could mature given significant interest from the community.

===Idea generation===

Idea generation - also known as ideation - can involve a structured business methodology for collecting and incubating innovative ideas that could mature with community participation.  Large corporations[tpl]which|date=November 2010[/tpl] use idea management systems to solicit ideas from their customers and employees.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]  Idea generation in some cases fuels the product pipeline.

===Business Process Improvement===

Social interactions are given tremendous speed and scale with Web 2.0 technologies.  By transacting business processes on Web 2.0 technologies, most (if not all) processes can be significantly improved when measured by time and accuracy.  This is because most business processes have a large human to human or social component where information flows between people.  By reducing the time cost of these components, the productivity gains are significant.McKinsey Global Institute 2012.
