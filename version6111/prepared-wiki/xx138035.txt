Brian Wiseman (born July 13, 1971) is a retired Canadian ice hockey forward and assistant coach.
As a novice player, Brian scored an astounding 413 goals in a single season[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl].  This broke a record held by Wayne Gretzky, and brought about national attention to the nine year-old Wiseman.
Brian owns the only retired number of the former Chatham MicMacs (now named Jr. Maroons) of the former Western Ontario Hockey League. His number 9 was retired after he left Chatham to play for the University of Michigan Wolverines. Approximately 3,600 spectators were in attendance to see Wiseman break Ed Olczyk's single season point record. Wiseman amassed 147 points in just 40 games in 1989–90.
During his career at University of Michigan, he was named Freshman of the Year in 1991, had Frozen Four appearances in 1992 and 1993 and the Wolverines were CCHA Tournament Champions in 1994.  He finished his U-M career with 248 points including a school-record 164 assists.
He was drafted by the New York Rangers in the 12th round of the 1991 NHL Entry Draft after his freshman season, but remained at U-M to complete his stellar career.
Brian would next move to play hockey professionally.  He played for the Chicago Wolves (IHL), St. John's Maple Leafs (AHL), Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL), and Houston Aeros (IHL) before retiring due to concussion problems stemming from an injury suffered during the Aeros' 1999–2000 playoff season. He helped the Houston Aeros capture the Turner Cup in the 1998–1999 season and was named the IHL's Most Valuable Player in 1999 after leading the league in scoring with 109 points.
After his playing career, he spent one season as a video coach with the Dallas Stars and another as an assistant coach at Princeton University.
In 2007, Brian Wiseman was inducted into the Chatham (Ontario) Sports Hall of Fame.
