Christopher Kier (born Toronto 1959) is an encaustic painter who graduated from the Ontario College of Art in 1987. He is represented by the Newzones Gallery of Contemporary Art in Calgary, Alberta.
Encaustic painting, also called "hot wax painting," involves using heated beeswax to which colored pigments are added. The liquid/paste is then applied to a surface â€” usually prepared wood, though canvas and other materials are often used.
His works have been acquired by corporate collections such as those of Air Canada, Westin and Nordstrom.
