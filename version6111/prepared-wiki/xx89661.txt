Glasgow Caledonian University (informally GCU or Caledonian) is a public university in Glasgow, Scotland. With a history traceable to 1875, the University was formally instituted in 1993 by an Act of Parliament that created Glasgow’s third university, and what would become one of Scotland’s largest universities with more than 18,000 students.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gcu.ac.uk/theuniversity/aboutglasgowcaledonian/abouttheuniversity/ | title = About the University | accessdate = 2012-09-05 | author = GCU[/tpl]

==History==

The University traces it origin from The Queen's College, Glasgow (founded 1875) and the Glasgow Polytechnic (founded 1971). The Queen’s College, which specialised in providing training in domestic science, received the Royal accolade of being named after Queen Elizabeth II in its centenary celebrations in 1975. Queen Elizabeth II was, herself, Patron of the College since 1944.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gashe.ac.uk:443/isaar/C0774.html | title = Queen's College, Glasgow | accessdate = 2012-09-05 | author = GASHE[/tpl] Glasgow Polytechnic, which was one of the largest central institutions in Scotland, offered externally validated degrees and diplomas in engineering, science, and the humanities: the first of which was a BA in Optics, followed by degrees in Social Sciences (1973) and Nursing (1977).[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gashe.ac.uk:443/isaar/C0868.html | title = Glasgow College of Technology | accessdate = 2012-09-05 | author = GASHE[/tpl]
On 1 April 1993, the two institutions amalgamated to form Glasgow Caledonian University. The new university took its name from Caledonia, the poetic Latin name for present-day Scotland.

===Coat of arms and motto===

The University’s coat of arms is the work of university academic and artist Malcolm Lochhead and draws on four elements from the coat of arms of the University’s predecessor institutions. The Caledonian Oak Tree (of St. Mungo's infamous legend) and the Book of Knowledge were borrowed from the arms of Glasgow Polytechnic while the Saltire Ermine and the Crossed Keys (intended to represent the “unlocking” of the Book of Knowledge) were taken from the arms of The Queen’s College. A visual feature was added to the new arms with the illuminated capital letters in the Book’s paragraphs reading: G C U (the three-letter abbreviation of the University’s name). The Coat of Arms was matriculated by the Lord Lyon King of Arms and is inscribed into university degree parchments. The University’s motto: "for the common weal", which has been adopted since 1975, features in the full design of the arms.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gcu.ac.uk/archives/gcu/GCUCOA.html | title = The University Coat of Arms and Motto | accessdate = 2012-09-06 | author = GCU[/tpl]

==Campuses==

GCU is located in a modern purpose-built campus in the heart of Glasgow’s city centre and opened a graduate campus in London in 2010, the first for a Scottish university. The University also has affiliate campuses in China and Oman and is planning to open a graduate campus in New York to deliver executive training and short courses, as the first British university to do so.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gcu.ac.uk/study/name,50334,en.html | title = GCU New York Base | accessdate = 2012-12-06 | author = GCU[/tpl] The University's Glasgow Campus is highly energy efficient and integrates a combined heat and power plant and district heating scheme to minimise carbon emissions.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.clarke-energy.com/2013/glasgow-caledonian-university-chp-district-heating-scheme/ | title = Glasgow Caledonian University CHP & District Heating Scheme | accessdate = 2013-09-22 | author = Clarke Energy[/tpl]

===Magnus Magnusson Fellowship===

The Magnus Magnusson Fellowship, named in honour of former University Chancellor Sir Magnus Magnusson, is an intellectual group based at the University and comprises leading international figures from a variety of backgrounds.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gcu.ac.uk/alumni/magnusmagnussonfund/fellowships/ | title = Magnus Magnusson Fellowship | accessdate = 2012-09-06 | author = GCU[/tpl] The fellowship meets annually to debate and agree action on issues of major concern to society, both locally and globally. It holds an annual lecture that alternates between Glasgow, London, and Reykjavík (Magnusson’s birthplace). 
Muhammad Yunus gave the inaugural Magnusson Fellowship Lecture in 2008 and was formally inducted as one of the first cohort of fellowship members. Fellowship members include Will Hutton (Magnusson Fellow, 2010), former President of Ireland Mary Robinson (Magnusson Fellow, 2011), and Renata Salecl (Magnusson Fellow, 2012).

==Partnerships==

===Grameen Caledonian Partnership===

The University has developed a unique partnership with the Grameen Trust, described in Yunus’s 2008 book Building Social Business as "a collection of initiatives that illustrate how a university can help spread and develop and new approach to society’s ills".[tpl]cite book | last1 = Yunus | first1 = Muhammad | authorlink1 = Muhammad Yunus | title = Building Social Business: The New Kind of Capitalism That Serves Humanity's Most Pressing Needs | edition = 1 | publisher = PublicAffairs | date = 11 May 2010 | pages = 53–163[/tpl] The partnership resulted in the creation of the Yunus Centre for Social Business and Health, a research institute in social business and healthcare development based in Glasgow, and the Grameen Caledonian College of Nursing in Dhaka, which provides accredited nursing and midwifery education to some of Bangladesh's most disadvantaged communities, with the aspiration, as Yunus  puts it, of utilising the intellectural leadership of the University to turn members of Grameen-borrowing families into world-class nurses. In March 2011, the Grameen Caledonian College celebrated its inaugural capping ceremony in Dhaka, with the Princess Royal in attendance.
The Grameen Caledonian partnership also envisaged the creation of a Caledonian-backed Grameen Bank in Scotland, the first to be set up in Europe. A 2009 BBC documentary on the proposed Bank highlighted the legal difficulties surrounding the Bank’s potential operations in Scotland, including the risk that Scottish micro-loan recipients would forfeit their entitlement to much-needed state benefits, failing governmental intervention to amend the law [tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/8134491.stm | title = Bangladeshi banking to help Scots | accessdate = 2012-09-06 | author = BBC | work=BBC News | date=2009-07-04[/tpl] In March 2012, Yunus announced the creation of the Grameen Scotland Foundation at a major event in the University in a fund-raising bid to finance the first branch of the Grameen Bank in Glasgow.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/muhammed-yunus-social-way-to-shift-people-out-of-poverty-1-2154775 | title = Social way to shift people out of poverty | accessdate = 2012-09-06 | last = Yunus | first = Muhammed | work = Scotsman[/tpl] Later that year, it was announced that Yunus would succeed Baron Macdonald of Tradeston as University Chancellor.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-18653792 | title = Muhammad Yunus accepts Glasgow Caledonian University post | accessdate = 2012-09-06 | author = BBC | work=BBC News | date=2012-07-01[/tpl]

===South African Link===

The University has enjoyed a rich history of interaction with South Africa and a number of its leading figures. It was the first university to award Nelson Mandela an honorary doctorate upon his release from prison in 1990 in recognition of his leadership during the anti-apartheid movement.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/754600.stm | title = Degree honour for Mbeki | accessdate = 2012-09-06 | author = BBC | work=BBC News | date=2000-05-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gcu.ac.uk/archives/gcu/GCUandSA.html | title = GCU's links with South Africa | accessdate = 2012-09-06 | author = GCU[/tpl] In accepting the honour, Mandela asked the University to offer support for reconstruction and development in South Africa and the University developed in this regard several projects to assist in research and training at a number of South African universities. Mandela officially received the honorary degree in June 1996 at a special ceremony in Buckingham Palace,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=100001§ioncode=26 | title = Nelson Mandela receives eight honorary degrees at Buckingham Palace | accessdate = 2012-09-06 | author = THE[/tpl] and suggested the renaming of the University’s Health Building after his close associate, Govan Mbeki, who was imprisoned in the cell next to him on Robben Island. The Govan Mbeki Building was officially inaugurated by Mbeki’s son, President Thabo Mbeki, in June 2001 and a specially-commissioned portrait of Nelson Mandela was unveiled that year at the Building’s foyer by Mandela’s wife, Graça Machel. The University is also home to two significant scholarly collections on South Africa: the Anti-Apartheid Movement in Scotland Archive and the George Johannes Collection. In 2012, GCU began designing and developing work-based programmes in railway operations management for Transnet Freight Rail, South Africa's largest freight rail organisation.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gcu.ac.uk/business/newsevents/news/article.php?id=41675 | title = GCU delivers Railway Operations Management programme in South Africa | accessdate = 2012-09-06 | author = GCU[/tpl]

===Cultural Fellows===

The Caledonian Cultural Fellows Initiative was set up in 2009 with the aim of enhancing university cultural life and promoting cultural engagement with wider community. Liz Lochhead, the Scots Makar, is the current Honorary President of the Fellowship, whose membership includes writer Anne Donovan, poet and novellist Jackie Kay, and artist Toby Paterson.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gcu.ac.uk/theuniversity/aboutglasgowcaledonian/culturalfellows/ | title = Cultural Fellows | accessdate = 2012-09-07 | author = GCU[/tpl]

==Caledonian Club==

The Caledonian Club is a multi award-winning social and community engagement initiative involving staff and students coaching young people and their families in advancing their learning and life skills, while university-based researchers carry out long-term analysis into the process as part of a wider university research agenda into life-long learning. In 2011, the Club developed an award-winning project named 'The Tale of Two Sporting Cities', with the aim of engaging cultural exchanges between primary schools in Glasgow and London and assessing the sporting and cultural legacy of the 2012 London Summer Olympics and the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gcu.ac.uk/caledonianclub/about/ | title = Caledonian Club | accessdate = 2012-09-06 | author = GCU[/tpl]

==Student life==

===Students' Association===

Glasgow Caledonian University Students' Association (GCUSA) is an independent body serving and representing the student population of the University. It is located on a separate site within campus and students are automatically admitted to its membership upon matriculation. In 2011, the Association was awarded the coveted title of Students' Union of the Year by NUS Scotland.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gcu.ac.uk/newsevents/news/bydate/2011/1/name,21575,en.html | title = Double success for GCU at the NUS Scotland Awards | accessdate = 2012-09-06 | author = GCU[/tpl]

===Graduation===

GCU holds its annual graduation ceremonies during the Summer and Autumn and its academic attire is made by robe-maker Ede & Ravenscroft. Under the University's academic dress code, the wearing of the customary mortar boards is disallowed, as it is not part of the official academic attire that consists of gowns and hoods only, individual to each award conferred.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gcu.ac.uk/graduation/gettingready/gownhiredresscode/gownhirefaqs/ | title = Graduation | accessdate = 2012-09-06 | author = GCU[/tpl] Graduants traditionally receive their degrees at graduation ceremonies by being 'capped' on the head with the Chancellor's hat, in a gesture that signifies the Chancellor's authority and status within the University.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gcu.ac.uk/graduation/graduationday/theceremony/ | title = Graduation Ceremony | accessdate = 2012-09-06 | author = GCU[/tpl] The postnominals for university graduates are prescribed with the abbreviation GlasCal.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/global/wwwoxacuk/localsites/gazette/documents/universitycalendar/Calendar_Style_Guide_2012.pdf | title = University Calendar 2012 | accessdate = 2012-09-06 | author = Oxford University[/tpl]
