Woodspring Priory is a former Augustinian priory beside the Severn Estuary about [tpl]convert|3|mi|km|0[/tpl] north-east of Weston-super-Mare, North Somerset.
The priory was founded in the early thirteenth century, and dedicated to Thomas Becket (the founder was a grandson of Reginald Fitzurse, one of Becket's murderers). It was home to a small community of Victorine Canons.[tpl]cite book|last=Greenwood|first=Charles|title=Famous Houses of the West Country|year=1977|publisher=Kingsmead Press|location=Bath|isbn=978-0-901571-87-8|pages=109â€“111[/tpl]
