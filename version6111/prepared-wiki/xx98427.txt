"Funkytown" is a 1980 song by the band Lipps Inc., with Cynthia Johnson as the lead singer. The Platinum-certified global disco hit, written by Steven Greenberg, expresses the singer's pining for a metaphorical place that will "keep me movin', keep me groovin' with some energy".
It was written while the band lived in Minneapolis, Minnesota with dreams of moving to New York.[tpl]cite web|title= 50 cool facts about the Minnesota music scene |url= http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2011/09/50_minnesota_music_facts.php |author= Andrea Swensson |work= Blogs.citypages.com |publisher= City Pages, LLC |date= September 22, 2011 |accessdate= July 28, 2013[/tpl] It entered the Billboard Hot 100 on March 29, 1980 and spent four weeks at #1, beginning May 31. It also hit #1 on the Dance chart in the spring of 1980. 
The single holds a unique record for reaching number 1 in more countries (28 total) than any other before and did until Madonna's "Hung Up" hit number 1 in 41 countries in 2005.  It reached the top spot in the United States, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, The Netherlands, and Australia, among many others. It also reached #2 in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and on the US R&B chart. "Funkytown" is often considered to be one of the last massive hits of the Disco genre.  Lipps Inc's version was that group's only US Top 40 hit.

==Controversies==

In 1976, an amendment was made to the Copyright Act that permits authors to terminate grants of copyright assignments and licenses that were made on or after January 1, 1978. Under Section 203 of the Copyright Act, artists may reclaim ownership of a work's copyright no earlier than 35 years after the grant was executed. However, artists may give notice of their intent to terminate as early as 25 years after the grant had been executed.[tpl]cite web|title= Copyright Law of the United States of America and Related Laws Contained in Title 17 of the United States Code - Circular 92 - Chapter 2 |url= http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html |work= U.S. Copyright Office |publisher= Copyright.gov |accessdate= March 30, 2012[/tpl] In 2006, Steven Greenberg became the first American songwriter to file "notice of termination" under this act, in regard to Funkytown and the album it is a part of.[tpl]cite web|author= Chris Roberts |title= 'Funkytown' Songwriter Leads Copyright Fight against Music Industry |publisher= Minnesota Public Radio |accessdate= March 31, 2012 |url= http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/12/06/funkytown/[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author= Ted Johnson |title= Funky Future For Copyright Act Proviso |accessdate= March 31, 2012 |newspaper= Daily Variety |year= 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author= David Menconi |title= 30 Years After Disco Fame, "Funkytown" Could Become Copyright Milestone |work= SXSWorld |publisher= Etypeservices.com |url= http://www.etypeservices.com/SWF/LocalUser/sxsw25//Magazine7826/Full/index.aspx?id=7826#/46/ |accessdate= March 30, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author= Dan Emerson |title= Law: 'Funkytown' goes to court |url= http://www.minnesotabusiness.com/article/funkytown-goes-court |publisher= Minnesota Business |accessdate= March 31, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author= Esme Murphy |title= Talk About It: ‘Funkytown’ Composer Battles Music Biz |url= http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2011/12/07/talk-about-it-funkytown-composer-takes-music-biz-to-court/ |publisher= CBS Minnesota |date= December 7, 2011 |accessdate= March 31, 2012[/tpl] Because the song was released in 1980, the earliest that Greenberg would actually have the copyright returned to him is in the year 2015. So far, Casablanca's successor (Universal Music Group) has had little to say on the matter. Their stance legally has been that the song was a "work for hire" which are not protected under the copyright amendment, with Greenberg playing the role of the employee. As the first major hit to be reviewed for termination, many artists across the country are eagerly awaiting the outcome.

==Pseudo Echo version==

In 1986, "Funkytown" was covered by Australian band Pseudo Echo, who gave the song a different sound, less of early 1980s electronica and more of a late 1980s rock-infused dance sound, including a guitar solo in the middle. Pseudo Echo's version spent 7 weeks at number 1 in Australia (Lipps Inc.'s was at number 1 for only 2 weeks in Australia), and was also a number 6 US hit in July of the following year, and in August a number 1 hit in Canada. Despite Pseudo Echo's rock-like arrangement, on the 12" single issue of this version, the song is labelled as "Funkytown (Dance Mix)".  Mirroring Lipps Inc's experience, Pseudo Echo's version was that group's only US Top 40 hit. This version by "Funky Town" by Pseudo Echo was played in the 1987 sequel comedy film Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise.

===Music video===

The music video is a very basic, low-budget video that features the band with their instruments on a lighted, smoke-filled set "performing" the song to a backing track.[tpl]cite video|title= Pseudo Echo - Funkytown |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnejLmQGYhg[/tpl]

==Other cover versions==

In 1980, it was covered by the Spanish group Parchís. This cover is possibly the first cover of the song. It was recorded as a result of the song's popularity as the main song of the Vuelta a España that year. The cover is completely in Spanish with the exception of the name "Funkytown".
The same year, Swedish group Flamingokvintetten covered the same song for their album Flamingokvintetten 11. Like the Parchís cover, the only English word in the song is "Funkytown".
In 1981, it was included by SNK in their licensed game Fantasy, released by Rock-Ola.
In 1984, the British post-punk band The 012 covered it at about double the original speed on rock instruments, under the title "Funkytown People", on their album Let's Get Professional. The performance is sloppy, with blurry, atonal guitar playing, and singer/guitarist Kif Kif Le Batter (real name Keith Dobson) throws in lots of asides putting the song down. After The 012 split up, Dobson formed World Domination Enterprises, and re-recorded the song under its proper title for their 1988 album Let's Play Domination. This performance is noticeably tighter than The 012's and the lyrics are played straight this time (although Dobson interprets "with some energy" as "It's Saturday"), but the guitar style remains the same. A "Let's Go Mix" of the song is included on World Dom's 1989 split remix/live album Love from Lead City.
In 1992, Danish singer/DJ Master Fatman covered it on his debut album, Hail Hail.
In 1995, it was covered by Tejano singer Selena during her last televised concert. The song was later included on the Selena film soundtrack album.
In 1997, French Industrial metal Treponem Pal covered this song in their "Higher" album.
In 2005, Robyn Hitchcock covered it on Obliteration Pie, an album released in Japan.
In 2007, it was covered by Alvin and the Chipmunks in the live-action/CGI film adaptation (this same version can also be heard in the video game based on the 2009 sequel). Their version peaked at number 86. It was also used in the video game Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 by Ubisoft for the music rhythm games.
The same year, French singer Lorie sampled the music of "Funkytown" for a remixed version of her hit single "Je Vais Vite"; it became "Je Vais Funky". A video was also made to promote the mix.
In 2009, Swedish group Alcazar released a cover of "Funkytown", included on their album Disco Defenders.
In 2010, the song was included in the video game Just Dance 2 as a cover version exclusive to the Best Buy Special Edition. It was also later included on Just Dance: Summer Party.
In 2011, Colombian singer Fanny Lú used the main synth riff and part of the vocal melody from "Funkytown" in the song "Te Amo, Te Amo" on her album Felicidad y Perpetua. In the same year, a sample of the song's verse was used in the lyrics of Super Junior members Donghae and Eunhyuk's second duo song, "Oppa, Oppa".
