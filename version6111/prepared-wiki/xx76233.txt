In the mathematical field of graph theory, a spanning tree T of a connected, undirected graph G is a tree that includes all of the vertices and some or all of the edges of G.

==Definitions==

A tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles. It is a spanning tree of a graph G if it spans G (that is, it includes every vertex of G) and is a subgraph of G (every edge in the tree belongs to G). A spanning tree of a connected graph G can also be defined as a maximal set of edges of G that contains no cycle, or as a minimal set of edges that connect all vertices.

===Fundamental cycles===

Adding just one edge to a spanning tree will create a cycle; such a cycle is called a fundamental cycle. There is a distinct fundamental cycle for each edge; thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between fundamental cycles and  edges not in the spanning tree.  For a connected graph with V vertices, any spanning tree will have V − 1 edges, and thus, a graph of E edges and one of its spanning trees will have E − V + 1 fundamental cycles. For any given spanning tree the set of all E − V + 1 fundamental cycles forms a cycle basis, a basis for the cycle space.[tpl]harvtxt|Kocay|Kreher|2004[/tpl], pp. 65–67.

===Fundamental cutsets===

Dual to the notion of a fundamental cycle is the notion of a fundamental cutset. By deleting just one edge of the spanning tree, the vertices are partitioned into two disjoint sets. The fundamental cutset is defined as the set of edges that must be removed from the graph G to accomplish the same partition. Thus, each spanning tree defines a set of V − 1 fundamental cutsets, one for each edge of the spanning tree.[tpl]harvtxt|Kocay|Kreher|2004[/tpl], pp. 67–69.
The duality between fundamental cutsets and fundamental cycles is established by noting that cycle edges not in the spanning tree can only appear in the cutsets of the other edges in the cycle; and vice versa: edges in a cutset can only appear in those cycles containing the edge corresponding to the cutset. This duality can also be expressed using the theory of matroids, according to which a spanning tree is a base of the graphic matroid, a fundamental cycle is the unique circuit within the set formed by adding one element to the base, and fundamental cutsets are defined in the same way from the dual matroid.[tpl]citation|title=Matroid Theory|volume=3|series=Oxford Graduate Texts in Mathematics|first=J.

===Spanning forests===

In graphs that are not connected, there can be no spanning tree, and one must consider spanning forests instead. Here there are two competing definitions:
To avoid confusion between these two definitions, [tpl]harvtxt|Gross|Yellen|2005[/tpl] suggest the term "full spanning forest" for a spanning forest with the same connectivity as the given graph, while [tpl]harvtxt|Bondy|Murty|2008[/tpl] instead call this kind of forest a "maximal spanning forest".[tpl]citation|title=Graph Theory and Its Applications|edition=2nd|first1=Jonathan L.|last1=Gross|first2=Jay|last2=Yellen|publisher=CRC Press|year=2005|isbn=9781584885054|page=168|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-7Q_POGh-2cC&pg=PA168[/tpl]; [tpl]citation|title=Graph Theory|volume=244|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|first1=J.

==Counting spanning trees==

The number t(G) of spanning trees of a connected graph is a well-studied
invariant.

===In specific graphs===

In some cases, it is easy to calculate t(G) directly:
 | last1 = Aigner | first1 = Martin | author1-link = Martin Aigner
 | last2 = Ziegler | first2 = Günter M. | author2-link = Günter M. Ziegler
 | pages = 141–146
