Putignano (Putign√†ane in Bari dialect) is a town and comune in the province of Bari, Puglia, Italy.

==Economy==

In the past the economy of the city was principally based on agriculture, but soon the population converted the rural village into an industrial center. Numerous families   created many companies from the scratch, in industries such as foods (taralli are one example), wedding and children dresses.

==Culture==

Putignano is well known for its Carnival.
It is the oldest (dating to 1394) and longest Italian carnival. It starts the day after Christmas and finishes the day before the ash Wednesday. There are four Carnival parades, 3 on the last month's Sundays and one in the evening of the last day of carnival (shrove Tuesday). Since 2005 the Carnival Foundation added a summer parades that usually takes place in July. 
The name of the city has also been given to an asteroid (7665 Putignano) of the solar system.
