The JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge is an annual series of 3.5-mile (5.63 km) road footraces owned and operated by JPMorgan Chase, with an intended focus on promoting "fitness in the workplace".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jpmorganchasecc.com/events.php |title=2007 marks 31st annual running of JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge |accessdate=2007-06-01 |publisher=Official Corporate Challenge web site[/tpl] Teams are organized by company or organization, and the JPMorgan Chase Foundation makes charitable donations proportional to the number of participants.
The Corporate Challenge was founded in 1977 by the New York Road Runners with a single race in New York City, with 200 runners from 50 companies. The top-finishing teams in all 12 cities will qualify to compete in the fifteenth, the Championship Race, held in October in New York City.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/sports/html/chasecc.html |title=JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge |accessdate=2007-06-01 |publisher=New York Sports Commission |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070414034510/http://www.nyc.gov/html/sports/html/chasecc.html  |archivedate = 2007-04-14[/tpl]
Not all participants race competitively; large percentages walk or jog the entire course, with the purpose being camaraderie within and among the corporate teams.  The festival atmosphere during and after the race attracts non-runners as well.
A new and primary focus for this year’s event is the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge’s Teaming Up For A Greener Tomorrow initiative.  JPMorgan Chase aims to implement the greenest road race in each city that the Corporate Challenge is held.  To date, the Series has saved more than six tons of paper (through online registration and paper-free marketing practices), recycled on-site more than 10 tons of plastic and glass, and saved more than 5,000 gallons of crude oil (through alternate modes of transportation by participants).  That’s more than 900 million BTUs, or enough energy to light a home for nearly 10 years. 
The 25th annual JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge Championship was held on October 6, 2007, with Enos Matalane of Transnet Rail Engineering (Johannesburg) and Claire Martin of Royal Mail Letters (London) earning the men's and women's individual titles.  Transnet, Polizei Hessen (Frankfurt) and Royal Mail Letters earned the men's, women's and mixed team titles, respectively.
With nearly 74,000 participants in 2008, the Frankfurt event was the world's largest footrace that year.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
