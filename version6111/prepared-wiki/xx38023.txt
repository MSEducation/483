The Process of Weeding Out is an instrumental EP released by Black Flag in 1985 on SST Records. 
One of the most potent realizations of Ginn's fascination with the avant-garde, Weeding Out is described by critic Chris True of Allmusic as "an interesting document of Greg Ginn's development from high-speed guitar 'sculptor' to one of the few punk artists to embrace 12-tone experimental music." Like Family Man, the album is highly regarded by fans of free jazz and experimental metal, and alludes musically to the direction Ginn's guitar playing would go to on In My Head.
The back cover has a quote from guitarist Greg Ginn, reading, in part:
"...even though this record may communicate certain feelings, emotions, and ideas to some, I have faith that cop-types with their strictly linear minds and stick-to-the-rules mentality don't have the ability to decipher the intuitive contents of this record."
