In signal processing, cross-correlation is a measure of similarity of two waveforms as a function of a time-lag applied to one of them. This is also known as a sliding dot product or sliding inner-product. It is commonly used for searching a long signal for a shorter, known feature. It has applications in pattern recognition, single particle analysis, electron tomographic, averaging, cryptanalysis, and neurophysiology.
For continuous functions f and g, the cross-correlation is defined as:
Similarly, for discrete functions, the cross-correlation is defined as:
The cross-correlation is similar in nature to the convolution of two functions.
In an autocorrelation, which is the cross-correlation of a signal with itself, there will always be a peak at a lag of zero unless the signal is a trivial zero signal.
In probability theory and statistics, correlation is always used to include a standardising factor in such a way that correlations have values between −1 and +1, and the term cross-correlation is used for referring to the correlation corr(X, Y) between two random variables X and Y, while the "correlation" of a random vector X is considered to be the correlation matrix (matrix of correlations) between the scalar elements of X.

==Explanation==

In econometrics, lagged cross-correlation is sometimes referred to as cross-autocorrelation.[tpl]cite book |last=Campbell |last2=Lo |last3=MacKinlay |year=1996 |title=The Econometrics of Financial Markets |location=NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0691043019 [/tpl]

==Properties==

==Time series analysis==

In time series analysis, as applied in statistics and signal processing, the cross correlation between two time series describes the normalized cross covariance function.
The cross correlation of a pair of jointly wide sense stationary stochastic process can be estimated by averaging the product of samples measured from one process and samples measured from the other (and its time shifts). The samples included in the average can be an arbitrary subset of all the samples in the signal (e.g., samples within a finite time window or a sub-sampling of one of the signals). For a large number of samples, the average converges to the true cross-correlation.

==Time delay analysis==

Cross-correlations are useful for determining the time delay between two signals, e.g. for determining time delays for the propagation of acoustic signals across a microphone array.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rhudy|first=Matthew|coauthors=Brian Bucci, Jeffrey Vipperman, Jeffrey Allanach, and Bruce Abraham|title=Microphone Array Analysis Methods Using Cross-Correlations|journal=Proceedings of 2009 ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress, Lake Buena Vista, FL|date=November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Rhudy|first=Matthew|title=Real Time Implementation of a Military Impulse Classifier|journal=University of Pittsburgh, Master's Thesis|date=November 2009[/tpl]  After calculating the cross-correlation between the two signals, the maximum (or minimum if the signals are negatively correlated) of the cross-correlation function indicates the point in time where the signals are best aligned, i.e. the time delay between the two signals is determined by the argument of the maximum, or arg max of the cross-correlation, as in

==Normalized cross-correlation==

In functional analysis terms, this can be thought of as the dot product of two normalized vectors. That is, if
and
then the above sum is equal to
Thus, if f and t are real matrices, their normalized cross-correlation equals the cosine of the angle between the unit vectors F and T, being thus 1 if and only if F equals T multiplied by a positive scalar.
Normalized correlation is one of the methods used for template matching, a process used for finding incidences of a pattern or object within an image. It is also the 2-dimensional version of Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient.

==Nonlinear systems==

Caution must be applied when using cross correlation for nonlinear systems. In certain circumstances, which depend on the properties of the input, cross correlation between the input and output of a system with nonlinear dynamics can be completely blind to certain nonlinear effects.Billings S.A. "Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains". Wiley, 2013 This problem arises because some moments can go to zero and this can incorrectly suggest that there is little correlation between two signals when in fact the two signals are strongly related by nonlinear dynamics.
