==Personal life==

At 13, she moved out of her mother’s house and went to live with her aunt.
A resident of Portland, Oregon, she is a close friend of Scissor Sisters lead singer Ana Matronic, and considers her favorite song to be "Oh Bondage, Up Yours" by X-Ray Spex. She courted mild  controversy in 2006 when, during an interview for NME magazine, she claimed to have eaten squirrels as a child, saying that "people in Arkansas just do – they'd think you were a freak if you ate squid there!"http://drownedinsound.com/news/1341104
Ditto is known for her noticeable stage dances and her unique and revealing image. She classes herself as a punk, and thus does not wear deodorant or shave under her armpits, having once remarked that "I think punks usually smell".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.psychopedia.com/dailynews/2006/11/listen_upi_dont_think_were_in.html|title=Listen Up: I Don’t Think We’re In Kansas Anymore|accessdate=2008-03-06|date=2006-11-20|publisher=psychoPEDIA[/tpl] She also formerly contributed an advice column on body image to The Guardian newspaper.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/apr/27/popandrock.healthandwellbeing1|title=What Would Beth Ditto Do?|accessdate=2009-07-14|publisher=The Guardian | location=London | date=2007-04-27[/tpl]
