[[List of breakcore artists]]

CATEGORIES: Breakcore, Lists of musicians by genre

This is a list of notable breakcore artists. This includes artists who have either been very influential within the genre, or are nationally known due to a considerable amount of exposure (for example, an artist that has released material on a major record label). This list does not include artists whose notability is restricted to their local scene or home country. Artists are listed by the first letter in their name (not including the words "a", "an", or "the"), and individuals are listed by last name.
