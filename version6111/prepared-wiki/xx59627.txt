Saskatchewan's Lieutenant Governors have filled the office of Visitor to the University of Saskatchewan since its establishment.Government of Saskatchewan (2006). The University of Saskatchewan Act, 1995. Regina: The Queen's Printer. Former Lieutenant Governor Sir Richard Lake was famously called upon to assume the visitor's role in the so-called Crisis of 1919. Four senior members of the Board of Governors had been dismissed after three among them abstained from a vote of confidence in university president Walter Murray. Murray was under scrutiny for his maintenance of University finances. The public and press clamoured for an explanation, and, in accordance with provincial law, Lake held a series of hearings through the office of the King’s Bench. His findings, delivered in April 1920, vindicated the dismissals, saying they were “regular, proper and in the best interest of the university.” In other words, their acts of disloyalty were enough to cost them their jobs.University of Saskatchewan Archives. 1919: Crisis.

===University presidents===

The past 100+ years have seen nine university presidents beginning with Walter Charles Murray (1908–37) who helped establish and set the groundwork for the University of Saskatchewan. In other words,  to make a University where no University existed. James Sutherland Thomson (1937–49) was the second president  during some of the most difficult years in the institution's history. His term spanned the final years of the Great Depression, the Second World War, and the hectic, early post-war years.  Walter Palmer Thompson presidency term (1949–59) spanned the university's 50th anniversary year. Dr. Walter Murray said to him  "Do not be appalled at the absence of all you have been accustomed to find in other Universities. We have all had to start with nothing.. .You have virgin soil to break."  In many fields Biologist Walter P. Thompson leadership brought innovation, insight and research to new areas beginning with rust resistant varieties of wheat which curtailed the 1916 catastrophic outbreak of rust. He also was instrumental in developing in Saskatchewan a comprehensive medicare program. His popularity and qualities of administrator and teacher served the U of S well during his presidency.[ref]
