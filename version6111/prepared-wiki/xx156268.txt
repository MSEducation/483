In the spring of 2002, shortly after yEnc gained popularity in binary newsgroups,Agent Newsreader and yEnc yProxy was released as freeware. yProxy was designed to convert yEnc attachments as they are downloaded, without user intervention.

===How yProxy works===

yProxy is a non-transparent NNTP proxy server. A NNTP client connects to yProxy. yProxy connects to the NNTP server. When the NNTP client makes a request for a news article, yProxy passes the request directly to the server. When the server responds with a yEnc encoded attachment, yProxy will decode the yEnc attachment to its raw binary form and reencode the attachment using the older, more widely accepted UUE format before passing the attachment to the client. The client then handles the attachment normally.
Below is a textual diagram of how yProxy works for the downstream from the NNTP server to the NNTP client.
