It is very difficult to get historical records of this ethnic people as they didn't have a written languages many years ago. But it still can be traced back as far to the year 1300 AD as there are the names of the places and traditional songs which can reveal the times being composed and the stories of ancient people. These people are from a Tibeto-Burman group and are familiar with all other Chin groups even though they have their own written language which is intelligible to others. These people called themselves "Zo Mingphuin" from the early times while others called them "Zotung" from during and after British rule. From 1931, their language was recorded using the Roman alphabet. It was called "Zo Ccaaw" (Zo Literature). Most of these people are farmers and prefer hunting animals for their meals like other Chin groups. In early history, the Zotung Mingphuin believed in Khozi as god and they used to pray to Khozi for their health, wealth and sins through Khuarum services. But when the western missionaries entered Chinland, the Zo people converted to Christianity between the 1930s and the present...
