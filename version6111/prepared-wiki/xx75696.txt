==History==

===Anglo-Saxons===

The town is known for its Saxon church tower of St Peter's, and there have been many Saxon archaeological finds within the town. An Anglo-Saxon inhumation cemetery at Castledyke South, in use from the late fifth or early sixth century until the late 7th century, was investigated and partially excavated 1975-90: the skeletal remains of 227 individuals were identified, including one who had undergone (and survived) trepanning.'The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery at Castledyke South, Barton-on-Humber' Drinkall & Foreman, Sheffield Academic PRess 1998 ISBN 1-85075-643-0  The church was reopened in May 2007 as a resource for medical research into the development of diseases, and ossuary, containing the bones and skeletons of some 2,750 people whose remains were removed between 1978 and 1984 from the 1,000 year old burial site, after the Church of England made the church redundant in 1972.Church finds there's life in the old bones yet, Ekklesia and Ecumenical News International, accessed 18 August 2007Skeleton collection goes on show, BBC News, 24 May 2007, accessed 18 August 2007Reburial for Anglo Saxon remains, BBC News, 7 March 2008, accessed 4 March 2012 The significance of the human remains lies in their representing the pathology of an isolated community over the period ca.950-ca1850. The excavation report on what is believed to be England's most extensively investigated parish church, including a volume on the human remains, was published 2007-11.'St Peter's Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire' vol. 1 Rodwell & Atkins, Oxbow 2011, ISBN 978-1-84217-325-1, vol 2 on the human remains, Waldron, Oxbow 2007 ISBN 978-1-84217-283-4
A ferry to Hull began in 1351, being granted by Edward II running until 1851, but this was superseded by a ferry at New Holland which began in 1820.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
In 1880 Frank Hopper started a bicycle repair business in a former blacksmith's shop in the town. He soon began manufacturing bicycles, and after buying the Elswick Cycle Company of Elswick in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1910, developed the renamed Elswick Hopper into a major manufacturer. Listed on the London Stock Exchange from 1930, the company had expanded into a diverse engineering, manufacturing and distribution conglomerate by the late 1970s. After moving residual UK bicycle manufacture to Brigg in the late 1980s, the now renamed Falcon Cycles division was sold to investors in the early 1990s. Elswick plc itself was sold in 1994, at which point it closed its offices in the town. The former head office at the junction of Brigg Road and Holydyke was converted into apartments in 2006.The Barton Racing Pigeon Club as we know it today, was formed around 1971, and is just coming up to its 40th anniversary
The club has spent most of its time in premises at the White Swan hotel in Barton, although the membership numbers are not as high as they were in the 70s & 80s, the club is still going strong
In its forty years history the club has always been outstanding in its racing achievements,  racing distances from fifty to five hundred miles into France, and no more so then when Gordon King won certificates  two years running in the British Barcelona Clubs races from Spain, flying  a distance of  almost 1000 miles.
The club has a very impressive array of trophies that are competed for every year,
The club would welcome new members, and would make them very welcome.

===Churches===

There are two churches in Barton-upon-Humber, St Peter's and St Mary's. Unusually for large mediaeval churches in a small town, they are located only about five hundred feet apart. St Peter's is a large, mostly Anglo-Saxon, church and predates St Mary's — which may have originated as a chapel on the original market place, enlarged and increasing in importance as the town's trade thrived in the 12th and 13th centuries.[tpl]cite web|last=Varah|first=Hugh|title=Visitors' Guide and History of Saint Mary's Church|url=http://www.stmarysbarton.org.uk/StMarysBarton/History.html|publisher=The Parish Church of Saint Mary the Virgin|accessdate=4 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=St Peter's Church, Barton-upon-Humber|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/st-peters-church-barton-upon-humber/|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=4 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]NHLE|num=1083103|desc=St Peter's Church|grade=I|accessdate=4 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]NHLE|num=1346773|desc=St Mary's Church|grade=I|accessdate=4 December 2013[/tpl]
