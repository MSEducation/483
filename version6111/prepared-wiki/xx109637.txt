[[Carbon suboxide]]

CATEGORIES: Oxocarbons

Carbon suboxide, or tricarbon dioxide, is an oxide of carbon with chemical formula C3O2  or O=C=C=C=O.  Its four cumulative double bonds make it a cumulene. It is one of the stable members of the series of linear oxocarbons O=Cn=O, which also includes carbon dioxide (CO2) and pentacarbon dioxide (C5O2).
The substance was discovered in 1873 by Benjamin Brodie by subjecting carbon monoxide to an electric current. He claimed that the product was part of a series of "oxycarbons" with formulas Cx+1Ox, namely C, C2O, C3O2, C4O3, C5O4, ..., and to have identified the last two;[tpl] cite journal | authorlink = Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 2nd Baronet | author = Brodie, B.

Carbonic acid dioxide is formed, and simultaneously with its formation a solid deposit may be observed in the induction-tube. This deposit appears as a transparent film of a red-brown color, lining the walls of the tube. It is perfectly soluble in water, which is strongly colored by it. The solution has an intensely acid reaction. The solid deposit, in the dry condition before it has been in contact with the water, is an oxide of carbon.

In 1891 Marcellin Berthelot observed that heating pure carbon monoxide at about 550 °C created small amounts of carbon dioxide but no trace of carbon, and assumed that a carbon-rich oxide was created instead, which he named "sub-oxide".  He assumed it was the same product obtained by electric discharge and proposed the formula C2O.[ref][tpl] cite journal | authorlink = Marcellin Berthelot | author = Berthelot, M. | title = Action de la chaleur sur l'oxyde de carbone | journal = Annales de Chimie et de Physique | volume = 6 | issue = 24 | year = 1891 | pages = 126–132 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k34894x/f124.table [/tpl]

It is commonly described as an oily liquid or gas at room temperature with an extremely noxious odor.[tpl] cite journal | author = Reyerson, L.

==Synthesis==

It is synthesized by warming a dry mixture of phosphorus pentoxide (P4O10) and malonic acid or the esters of malonic acid.[tpl] cite journal | author = Diels, O. | authorlink = Otto Diels | coauthor = Wolf, B. | title = Ueber das Kohlensuboxyd.

Therefore, it can be also considered as the anhydride of malonic anhydride, i.e. the "second anhydride" of malonic acid. Malonic anhydride (not to be confused with maleic anhydride) is a real molecule.[tpl] cite journal | author = Perks, H. M.; Liebman, J.

Several other ways for synthesis and reactions of carbon suboxide can be found in a review from 1930 by Reyerson.[tpl] cite journal | author = Reyerson, L.

Carbon suboxide polymerizes spontaneously to a red, yellow, or black solid. The structure is postulated to be poly(α-pyronic), similar to the structure in 2-pyrone (α-pyrone).[tpl] cite journal | author = Ballauff, M.; Li, L.; Rosenfeldt, S.; Dingenouts, N.; Beck, J.; Krieger-Beck, P. | title = Analysis of Poly(carbon suboxide) by Small-Angle X-ray Scattering | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition | year = 2004 | volume = 43 | issue = 43 | pages = 5843–5846 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200460263 | pmid = 15523711 [/tpl][tpl] cite journal | author = Ellern, A.; Drews, T.; Seppelt, K. | title = The Structure of Carbon Suboxide, C3O2, in the Solid State | journal = Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie | year = 2001 | volume = 627 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–76 | doi = 10.1002/1521-3749(200101)627:13.0.CO;2-A  [/tpl]
In 1969, it was hypothesized that the color of Martian surface was caused by this compound; this was disproved by the Viking Mars probes.[tpl] cite journal | author = Plummer, W. T.; Carsont, R.

==Uses==

Carbon suboxide is used in the preparation of malonates; and as an auxiliary to improve the dye affinity of furs.
