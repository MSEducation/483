==Political history==

===Bachelet's first presidency===

During January 2006's presidential campaign both President Michelle Bachelet and center-right candidate Sebastián Piñera voiced their support for civil unions, but the Catholic Church and many members of Congress were opposed.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/05/chile-law-on-civil-union-for-gays-within-reach/|title=CHILE: Law on Civil Union for Gays Within Reach |publisher=IPS News |date=2006-05-17 |accessdate=2014-03-30[/tpl]
In October 2009, a civil union bill was introduced but failed to pass.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agmagazine.info/2009/10/14/presentaran-el-pacto-de-union-civil-en-el-parlamento-chileno/ |title=Presentaron el Pacto de Unión Civil en el Parlamento chileno |publisher=Agmagazine.info |date=2009-10-14 |accessdate=2011-10-03[/tpl]

===Piñera's presidency===

During his run-up to the presidency in 2009, Piñera vowed to end discrimination based on sexual orientation and included a gay couple in one of his televised campaign ads.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/chile/091130/gay-rights-campaign |title=Chile's elections: “Who gets the gay vote?” |publisher=globalpost |date=2009-12-03 |accessdate=2014-03-30[/tpl]
In June 2010, senator Andrés Allamand (National Renewal) submitted the Acuerdo de Vida en Común (AVC) ("Commonlife Agreement") to Congress. AVC was a civil unions agreement identical to marriage other than in name that would be open to any two people regardless of sex.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.latercera.com/contenido/674_267717_9.shtml|title=Allamand reflota la agenda valórica|publisher=La Tercera (newspaper)|date=2010-06-13|accessdate=2014-03-30[/tpl] On 3 August 2010, senator Fulvio Rossi (Socialist Party) introduced a bill to legalize same-sex marriage in the country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ontopmag.com/article.aspx?id=6155&MediaType=1&Category=24 |title=Chile Senator Fulvio Rossi Introduces Gay Marriage Bill |publisher=Ontopmag.com |date=2010-08-03 |accessdate=2011-10-03[/tpl] During the first week of September 2010, several senators backing the bill stated they would withdraw their support after talks with members of the Evangelical Church, and instead announced support for the civil union bill introduced by senator Allamand.
In May 2011, president Piñera stated that he was in favor of an upcoming bill which would legalize a form of civil union; his stated intent was to “protect and safeguard ... the dignity of those couples, whether of the opposite or even the same sex”.[tpl]cite web|url = http://news.pinkpaper.com/NewsStory/5427/29/05/2011/chile-set-to-allow-gay-civil-unions-.aspx|title = Chile set to allow gay civil unions|author = Johnny Payne|publisher = PinkPaper.com|date = 29 May 2011|archiveurl=http://archive.is/g1Lt|archivedate=11 July 2012[/tpl] Piñera introduced a bill to Congress in August 2011 allowing registered cohabitation, known as Acuerdo de Vida en Pareja (Life Partnership Agreement).

In response to the proposed legislation and potential legal battles brewing in the country's Constitutional Court, members of Chile's Independent Democrat Union introduced a constitutional amendment on 11 August 2011, that sought to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ontopmag.com/article.aspx?id=9184&MediaType=1&Category=24 |title=Chile Introduces Constitutional Gay Marriage Ban Amendment |publisher=Ontopmag.com |date=2011-08-11 |accessdate=2011-10-03[/tpl]
On 10 April 2013, the Acuerdo de Vida en Pareja law creating civil unions in Chile was approved by the Senate's Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, on a 4-1 vote.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.senado.cl/prontus_senado/site/artic/20130410/pags/20130410134323.html|title=Comisión de Constitución aprobó idea de legislar sobre proyecto que establece un Acuerdo de Vida en Pareja|publisher=Senado|date=10 April 2013[/tpl]Draft law establishing and regulating the Life Partner Agreement, Government of Chile On 7 January 2014, the Senate voted 28–6 in favor of the law,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/01/07/chile-civil-unions-bill-advances/|title=Chile civil unions bill advances|publisher=Washington Blade|date=2014-01-07[/tpl] but the bill was not voted on by the Chamber of Deputies before the end of the parliamentary session in March 2014, despite it being a priority issue for Piñera.

===Bachelet's second presidency===

Michelle Bachelet declared on 11 April 2013 that she supports marriage equality and will seek to legalise it if elected president in the November 2013 presidential elections. Bachelet, who was president of Chile between 2006 and 2010, won the election on 15 December 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aciprensa.com/noticias/bachelet-quiere-legalizar-aborto-y-matrimonio-igualitario-en-chile-64688/#.UWk9s6JkSYQ |title=Bachelet quiere legalizar aborto y matrimonio igualitario en Chile |publisher=Aciprensa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02[/tpl]
When Bachelet took office in March 2014, she made passing Piñera's civil union bill a priority issue as well.[tpl]cite news|url=http://santiagotimes.cl/government-announces-priority-sex-civil-unions-tax-reform/|title= Government announces priority for same-sex civil unions and tax reform|publisher=Santiago Times|date=March 17, 2014[/tpl] Legalising same-sex marriage remains a longer-term goal of Bachelet's administration.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.24horas.cl/politica/ministro-gomez-abre-discusion-sobre-matrimonio-homosexual-1139180|title=Ministro Gómez abre discusión sobre matrimonio homosexual|publisher=24horas|date=2014-03-20|accessdate=2014-03-30[/tpl]

==Challenges in court==

Chile's Constitutional Court heard arguments on 28 July 2011, regarding the constitutionality of Article 102 of the Civil Code that bans same-sex marriage[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.santiagotimes.cl/chile/human-rights-a-law/22085-chiles-same-sex-marriage-debate-reaches-constitutional-court |title=Chile’s same-sex marriage debate reaches Constitutional Court |publisher=Santiagotimes.cl |date= |accessdate=2011-10-03[/tpl] but it ruled in a 9-1 vote on November 3 that the ban wasn't unconstitutional.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/chile-court-rejects-gay-marriage-appeal-1.1171482 |title=Chile court rejects gay marriage appeal |publisher=IOL |date=2011-11-04 |accessdate=2014-03-30[/tpl]

==Polls==

An April 2009 poll concluded that only 33.2% of Chileans were in favor of allowing same-sex couples to be married, with 65.2% opposed.[tpl]cite web|author=(04/24/09) |url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/most_chileans_reject_same_sex_marriage/ |title=Most Chileans Reject Same-sex Marriage |publisher=Angus-reid.com |date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2011-10-03[/tpl] However, support among young people was much higher: according to a study by the National Youth Institute of Chile, 56% of people aged between 15 and 29 supported same-sex marriage, while 51.3% supported same-sex adoption.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ipsnoticias.net/nota.asp?idnews=92541 |title=Unión civil para gays y lesbianas anima debate electoral |publisher=Ipsnoticias.net |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2011-10-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.injuv.gob.cl/pdf/sondeo_juventud_final.pdf |title=Presentación de PowerPoint |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-10-03[/tpl]
The July 2011 nation-wide CEP poll found that 52% of Chileans were in favor of granting legal rights to same-sex unions: 18% supported granting civil marriage to gay couples, while 34% preferred giving same-sex couples a "legal union". When the question is slightly rephrased, 57% of Chileans were against gay marriage where "the same rights as a heterosexual couple are guaranteed" and 27% in favor, while support for a "legal union" of same-sex couples was higher at 35%, with 57% against. In all questions, support for gay unions was higher among the younger and better educated. In the case of adoption of children by a lesbian couple, 24% were in favor and 61% against. Support was lower for male gay couples: 20% in favor and 64% against.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cepchile.cl/dms/lang_1/doc_4844.html |title=Estudio Nacional de Opinión Pública, Junio-Julio 2011.
