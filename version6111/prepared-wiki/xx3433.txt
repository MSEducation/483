During the beginning of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids, the Fatimid Caliphs claimed spiritual supremacy not only in Egypt, but also contested the religious leadership of Syria. At the beginning of the Abbasid realm in Baghdad, the Alids faced severe persecution by the ruling party as they were a direct threat to the Caliphate. Owing to the Abbasid inquisitions, the forefathers opted for concealment of the Dawa's existence. Subsequently, they traveled towards the Iranian Plateau and distanced themselves from the epicenter of the political world. Al Mahdi's father, Al Husain al Mastoor returned to control the Dawa's affairs. He sent two Dai's to Yemen and Western Africa. Al Husain died soon after the birth of his son, Al Mahdi. A system of government helped update Al Mahdi on the development which took place in North Africa.John Bagnell Bury. The Cambridge Medieval History, Volume 2. Macmillan, 1913. Pg 379.
Al Mahdi established the first Imam of the Fatimid dynasty. He claimed genealogic origins dating as far back as Fatimah through Husayn and Ismail. Al Mahdi established his headquarters at Salamiyah and moved towards north-western Africa, under Aghlabid rule. His success of laying claim to being the precursor to the Mahdi was instrumental among the Berber tribes of North Africa, specifically the Kutamah tribe. Al Mahdi established himself at the former Aghlabid residence at Raqqadah, a suburb of Al-Qayrawan in Tunisia. At the time of his death he had extended his reign to Morocco of the Idrisids, as well as Egypt itself. In 920, Al Mahdi took up residence at the newly established capital of the empire, Al-Mahdiyyah. After his death, Al Mahdi was succeeded by his son, Abu Al-Qasim Muhammad Al-Qaim, who continued his expansionist policy.al-Qaim bi-Amrillah. archive.mumineen.org

===Berbers and Iberian Umayyads===

The Arabs, under the command of the Berber General Tarik ibn Ziyad, first began their conquest of southern Spain or al-Andalus in 711. A raiding party led by Tarik was sent to intervene in a civil war in the Visigothic kingdom in Hispania. Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar (named after the General), it won a decisive victory in the summer of 711 when the Visigothic king Roderic was defeated and killed on July 19 at the Battle of Guadalete. Tariq's commander, Musa bin Nusair crossed with substantial reinforcements, and by 718 the Muslims dominated most of the peninsula. Some later Arabic and Christian sources present an earlier raid by a certain Ṭārif in 710 and also, the Ad Sebastianum recension of the Chronicle of Alfonso III, refers to an Arab attack incited by Erwig during the reign of Wamba (672–80). The two large armies may have been in the south for a year before the decisive battle was fought.[tpl]harvnb|Collins|2004|p=139[/tpl]
The rulers of Al-Andalus were granted the rank of Emir by the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I in Damascus. After the Abbasids came to power, some Umayyads fled to Muslim Spain to establish themselves there. By the end of the 10th century, the ruler Abd al-Rahman III took over the title of Emir of Córdoba(912-961).[tpl]harvnb|Hourani|2003|p=41[/tpl]  Soon after, the Umayyads went on developing a strengthened state with its capital as Córdoba. Al-Hakam II succeeded to the Caliphate after the death of his father Abd ar-Rahman III in 961. He secured peace with the Christian kingdoms of northern Iberia,[tpl]Cite book|last=Glubb |first=John Bagot|authorlink=|editor= |others= |title=The course of empire: The Arabs and their successors |origdate= |origyear=|url=|format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1966|publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=|language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=128 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= [/tpl] and made use of the stability to develop agriculture through the construction of irrigation works.[tpl]Cite book|last=Glick |first=Thomas F. |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Islamic and Christian Spain in the early Middle Ages |origdate= |origyear=|url= |format=|accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=2005|publisher=BRILL|location= |language=|isbn=90-04-14771-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=102 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= [/tpl] Economic development was also encouraged through the widening of streets and the building of markets.

The Umayyad Caliphate collapsed in 1031 due to political divisions and civil unrest during the rule of Hicham II who was ousted because of his indolence.[tpl]Cite book|last=O'Callaghan |first=Joseph F. |authorlink= |editor= |title=A History of Medieval Spain |origyear= |accessdate=2009 |edition= |year=1983 |publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-9264-5 |pages=133 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= [/tpl] Al-Andalus then broke up into a number of states called taifa kingdoms (Arabic, Muluk al-ṭawā'if; English, Petty kingdoms). The decomposition of the Caliphate into those petty kingdoms weakened the Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula vis-à-vis the Christian kingdoms of the north. Some of the taifas, such as that of Seville, were forced to enter into alliances with Christian princes and pay tributes in money to Castille.[tpl]Cite book|last=Constable |first=Olivia Remie |authorlink= |editor= |title=Medieval Iberia: Readings from Christian, Muslim, and Jewish Sources |origyear= |accessdate=2009 |edition= |year=1997 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1569-9 |pages=103 |chapter=The Political Dilemma of a Granadan Ruler |chapterurl= |quote= [/tpl]
