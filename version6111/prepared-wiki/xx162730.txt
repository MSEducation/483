Two years later, Alison Stewart received text message "Can I trust you? LM". It was from Lucy, and they soon met. She was now back in Oakdale with Johnny, who has gotten sick again and needs a bone marrow transplant as soon as possible. The two girls teamed up to take blood tests from every person related to Johnny, in order to find a match for the transplant.

However, Johnny's temperature was rising again and the three went to the hospital. Dusty found himself unable to be angry with Lucy, and he made plans with her to flee from Oakdale as soon as Johnny recovered. Unfortunately, Katie told Craig about Lucy's return with Johnny, and Craig went to the hospital where Johnny had the procedure. While Craig, at first, had forgiven Lucy for taking off two years ago, he later overheard a conversation between his daughter and Dusty, discussing their plan to flee Oakdale. Craig called Margo with the request to arrest Lucy for kidnapping.

Lucy quickly went to see Johnny before she left town promising him she would come back. Dusty arranges the plane and kissed briefly before Lucy left Oakdale.
