Humani, or the Humanist Association of Northern Ireland, is a humanist organisation based in Northern Ireland. They publish Humanism Ireland in association with the Humanist Association of Ireland.
'Humanism Ireland' is an all-Ireland Humanist magazine published bi-monthly.
Humani, which is affiliated to the BHA and the IHEU, seeks to promote secular Humanism in Northern Ireland and to represent the interests of those who adopt this enlightened philosophy.
Its campaigns include: integrated education; religious and moral education or philosophy including Humanism to replace RE in schools; an end to collective worship in schools; fair employment in teaching appoints and promotions; defending the teaching of evolution; combatting superstitious and irrational beliefs; advice on contraception and abortion; civil partnerships and other rights for gays and lesbians; legal Humanist ceremonies, as in Scotland; voluntary euthanasia and assisted dying; the rights of ethnic minorities and migrant workers; cosmopolitan and 'third discourse' politics; promoting Humanist and dissident view in the media; a Humanist 'Thought for the Day'; and a public holiday commemorating Darwin.
Humani organises an annual Darwin Day Lecture and dinner in February and an all-Ireland Summer School at Carlingford in conjunction with the Humanist Association of Ireland, usually towards the end of August.
Humani meets on the second Thursday of the month in the Malone Lodge Hotel, Eglantine Avenue, Belfast.
