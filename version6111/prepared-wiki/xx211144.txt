Pōhakuloa Training Area (PTA) is located on the island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i in the high plateau between Mauna Loa, Mauna Kea and the Hualālai volcanic mountains. It includes a small military airstrip known as Bradshaw Army Airfield.

==Description==

The area  of [tpl]convert|108863|acre|km2[/tpl] is the largest United States Department of Defense installation in the state of Hawaii, or anywhere in the Pacific.
The region was used for live fire exercises in 1943 during World War II when Camp Tarawa temporarily held troops on Parker Ranch.[tpl]cite web |title= Analysis of Fire History and Management Concerns at Pohakuloa Training Area |author= Andrew M. Beavers |publisher= Colorado State University |date= December 19, 2000  |url= http://www.cemml.colostate.edu/assets/pdf/tps02-02.pdf |accessdate= August 27, 2010 [/tpl]
About [tpl]convert|91000|acre[/tpl] were leased from Richard Smart, owner of the ranch.
At that time it was called the Waikoloa Maneuver Area, and located northwest of current base, south of Waimea. In September 1946 the land used for the old maneuver area and camp was returned to the ranch, and a smaller Lalamilo Firing Range used until 1953. Since coastal areas were developed into tourist resorts, military areas were moved inland to more remote locations.[tpl]cite web |title=Phase II Former Waikoloa Maneuver Area and Nansay Sites Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis |author= |publisher= US Army Corps of Engineers |date= July 1, 2002 |url= http://www.poh.usace.army.mil/env/Docs/EECA/Ch02.pdf |accessdate= August 27, 2010 [/tpl]

==Location==

The name of the current facility comes from pu[tpl]okina[/tpl]u pōhaku loa, which means "long rocky cinder cone" in the Hawaiian Language, although like many other Hawaiian names, the same name has been used for other places on the island.[tpl]cite web |url= http://ulukau.org/cgi-bin/hpn?a=q&r=1&hs=1&t=1&e=q-0mahele--00-0-0--010---4----dtx--0-0l--1en&q=p%F6hakuloa&h=dtx&summarise=0 |title= Lookup of pohakuloa |work= Hawaiian place names web site |year= 2004 |accessdate= August 27, 2010[/tpl]
Pōhakuloa Training Area lies in a high plateau between lower slopes of Mauna Kea to approximately [tpl]convert|6800|ft|m[/tpl] in elevation and to about [tpl]convert|9000|ft|m[/tpl] on Mauna Loa. The training area is about midway between Hilo, on the east coast and the Army landing site at Kawaihae Harbor.Pahakuloa Training Area page at Marine Corps Base Hawaii web site
It is used by both the U.S. Army and Marine Corps.
The only road access is via the narrow Saddle Road (Hawaii Route 200), which is paralleled by a tank trail.
Heavy equipment is either flown into Hilo, or else shipped via barge to Kawaihae Harbor, about [tpl]convert|40|mi[/tpl] away on the Saddle Road.
Because of this remoteness, the area is used mostly for short training sessions.

==Facilities==

The barracks for about 2,000 troops were constructed in April 1955 from prefabricated buildings used in World War II.
The support area includes [tpl]convert|600|acre[/tpl] of logistic and administrative facilities.
In July 2006 an additional [tpl]convert|24000|acre[/tpl] were purchased from Parker Ranch in an area known as Keʻāmuku,[tpl]cite web |title= U.S. Army Acquires Keamuku Parcel |publisher= Parker Ranch Foundation |url= http://prft.org/index.php/news/u.s._army_acquires_keamuku_parcel/  |accessdate= August 27, 2010 [/tpl]
which means "cut-off lava" in Hawaiian, from to the 19th century lava flows through the area.[tpl]cite web |url= http://ulukau.org/cgi-bin/hpn?e=p&a=q&l=en&q=Keamuku&d=HASH018c4e98cba8a6237eb7a74d |title=lookup of Keamuku |work= on Hawaiian place names |author= Lloyd J.

There are approximately [tpl]convert|32000|acre|km2[/tpl] of land level enough for large maneuvers, more than twice the area available on O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu.
Its remoteness allows a wide range of weapons to be used.
The 25th Infantry Division and 3rd Marine Regiment often use the base for four to six-week training periods.[tpl]cite news |title= Big Isle site is base for heavy Army training Pohakuloa Training Area allows for large-scale training that the Army cannot do on Oahu |author= Gregg K.

==Bradshaw Army Airfield==

The airstrip was constructed at the area in 1956.
The runway is only [tpl]convert|3700|ft[/tpl] long, which only accommodates small aircraft. 
Fog often restricts helicopters, which can also fly in from the larger bases on O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu.

==Environment==

Vegetation varies from sparse grassland and low shrubs to open māmane forest. Despite the volcanic terrain, some of the areas contain protected wildlife. Within the borders of the training area, ten different endangered species can be found. These include the native Hawaiian mint honohono (Haplostachys haplostachya) and the shrub 'kio'ele (Kadua coriacea). This area has more endangered species than any other US Army installation.Pohakuloa Training Area on GlobalSecurity.Org web site The northeastern portion of the site near Mauna Kea provides habitat for the endangered bird Palila (Loxioides bailleui), for example.
Several archaeological sites have been found in the training area, including the Bobcat Trail Habitation Cave, listed in the National Register of Historic Places.[ref]"Historic Sites Review of a Proposed Mauna Loa Trail System" by Thomas S. Dye,

To reduce fire danger and damage from feral goats, areas were fenced.
