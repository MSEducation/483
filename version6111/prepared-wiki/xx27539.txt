SmartSuite is an office suite from Lotus Software. The company made versions of its office suite for IBM OS/2 and Microsoft Windows.

==Status==

SmartSuite is in maintenance mode, and supported with fixes and fixpacks on Windows 2000 and Windows XP. SmartSuite is not officially supported by IBM on versions of Windows after XP, but it does work well on both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and of Windows 7, if the installer and applications are run with XP compatibility mode set for the executable files. This mode isn't needed to install or run Organizer 6. IBM has no plans to release specific Windows 7-compatible versions of SmartSuite or Organizer.Information about SmartSuite and Organizer working on the new Microsoft Windows Vista operating system

===Microsoft Windows===

==Compatibility==

Most or all SmartSuite programs are capable of reading and writing the corresponding Microsoft Office files. The Microsoft programs, however, are capable of reading only a few vintage formats of the Lotus programs, such as the older 1-2-3 .wks and .wk1 files.  Furthermore, several of the SmartSuite components provide functionality not found in the Microsoft Office suite, for example Lotus FastSite and Lotus SmartCenter.

==IBM vs Microsoft==

In his finding of facts for United States v. Microsoft, Judge Jackson determined that because of IBM's marketing of Lotus SmartSuite, and other alternatives to Microsoft products (like World Book electronic encyclopedia instead of Microsoft's Encarta[tpl]citation|url =http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f3800/msjudgex.htm|title=Court's finding of fact|publisher=United States Department of Justice[/tpl], Sec. 127. November 5, 1999), Microsoft "punished the IBM PC Company with higher prices, a late license for Windows 95, and the withholding of technical and marketing support."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.com.com/Full+text+of+Judge+Jacksons+findings+of+fact+-+page+23/2009-1001_3-232571-23.html|title=Full text of Judge Jackson's findings of fact|publisher=CNet[/tpl], Sec. 116.

Microsoft did not grant IBM OEM rights for Windows 95 until 15 minutes prior to the release of Windows 95, August 24, 1995. Because of this uncertainty, IBM machines were sold without Windows 95, while Compaq, HP, and other indulgent companies sold machines with Windows 95 from day one.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.com.com/Full+text+of+Judge+Jacksons+findings+of+fact+-+page+25/2009-1001_3-232571-25.html?tag=st.next|title=Full text of Judge Jackson's findings of fact|publisher=CNet[/tpl], Sec. 125.
