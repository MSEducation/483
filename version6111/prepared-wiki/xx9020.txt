Naive Set Theory is a mathematics textbook by Paul Halmos originally published in 1960. This book is an undergraduate introduction to set theory.  It is still considered by many to be the best introduction to set theory for beginners.  While the title states that it is naive, which is usually taken to mean without axioms, the book does introduce all the axioms of Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory and gives correct and rigorous definitions for basic objects.  Where it differs from a "true" axiomatic set theory book is its character: there are no long-winded discussions of axiomatic minutiae, and there is next to nothing about advanced topics like large cardinals. Instead, it tries to be intelligible to someone who has never thought about set theory before.
Halmos later stated that it was the fastest book he wrote, taking about six months, and that the book "wrote itself".
