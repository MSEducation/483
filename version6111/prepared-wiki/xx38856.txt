==History==

===TAM – Táxi Aéreo Marília===

TAM – Táxi Aéreo Marília and TAM – Transportes Aéreos Regionais were two different entities, although both belonged to the TAM Group. TAM – Marília, an air taxi company founded in 1961, provided the start-up infrastructure for TAM – Regionais.

===TAM – Transportes Aéreos Regionais (KK)===

On November 11, 1975, the Government of Brazil created the Brazilian Integrated System of Regional Air Transportation and divided the country in five different regions, for which five newly created regional airlines received a concession to operate air services. Founded by Rolim Adolfo Amaro[tpl]cite book | last1=Guaracy | first1=Thales | title=O sonho brasileiro: como Rolim Adolfo Amarou criou a TAM e sua filosofia de negócios | year=2003 | publisher=Girafa | location= | language=Portuguese | isbn=85-89876-02-0 | page=480[/tpl] TAM – Transportes Aéreos Regionais S/A was the third of those regional airlines to be made operational. Its services started on July 12, 1976, and its operational area comprised parts of the Southeast and Central West regions of Brazil, specifically the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, and parts of Mato Grosso, and São Paulo plus the possibility of serving the cities of Cuiabá, Rio de Janeiro, Londrina, Maringá and Brasília when linking them to its area of concession.[tpl]cite book| first=Gílson de Lima | last=Garófalo | title=O Mercado Brasileiro de Transporte Aéreo Regional | place=São Paulo | publisher=Instituto de Pesquisas Econômicas | year=1982 | language=Portuguese | pages=103–107, 122–125[/tpl]
TAM – Linhas Aéreas Regionais was formed as a joint-venture between TAM – Táxi Aéreo Marília and VASP, the latter of which was then a state-owned airline. The airline received the IATA code KKHome Page on October 13, 1999. The new airline flew Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirantes at first, but these proved grossly inadequate for the task at hand, and even at full capacity needed to be subsidized by the government in order to be profitable.
TAM went on to purchase three used Fokker F27 turboprops, which were subsequently refurbished by Fokker in the Netherlands. In order to obtain the import authorization for the aircraft, a deal was struck with the government in which TAM was forced to maintain 3 Bandeirantes for every F27, as well as removing 5 seats from each one, bringing the F27's capacity down to 40 passengers. A fourth F27, previously owned by Air New Zealand, was added to the TAM fleet in 1981. By 1983, TAM had acquired 10 F27s. By 1981, TAM had flown one million passengers, and two million by 1984.

===TAM (KK) joint operations with TAM (JJ)===

In August 1986, the company, under financial stress, went public and began floating stock in the market. The same year, TAM – Transportes Aéreos Regionais (KK) acquired another regional airline, VOTEC, which operated in areas of northern and central Brazil. VOTEC was then renamed Brasil Central Linhas Aéreas. TAM and Brasil Central were both regional airlines and operated in different designated areas. They however operated as a consortium with integrated networks and fleet, with the most notable differences being the flight number IATA codes (whereas TAM had the IATA code KK, Brasil Central operated with the code JJ inherited from VOTEC), the different color schemes of the aircraft, and their designated areas of operation. In 1988, TAM flew its 3 millionth passenger.
On May 15, 1990, the Brazilian Government lifted restrictions on operational areas of regional airlines allowing them to fly anywhere in Brazil. As a consequence, Brasil Central was renamed TAM – Transportes Aéreos Meridionais, acquired the same color scheme of TAM (KK) but maintained the IATA code JJ.
In 2000 TAM (KK) was merged into TAM (JJ) and TAM (JJ) was renamed TAM Transportes Aéreos. The code JJ was maintained and the code KK was released back to IATA. It is now used by Atlasjet.
Despite TAM's success in the market, it was evident the airline would not last long when competing against airlines such as Varig and VASP, both of which already possessed Boeing 737s in their fleet. Amaro then tried to buy VASP, which was about to be privatized, and called the project "Revolution". Having lost the bid, he opted for slower growth with a gradual addition of new aircraft, re-dubbed "Evolution".
On September 15, 1989, TAM arranged for the acquisition of two Fokker 100 jets, which had originally been ordered by the now-bankrupt Pan American World Airways. Like the F27s before them, TAM did not actually purchase these aircraft, but used Amaro's credibility to arrange for a third-party asset management company, Guinness Peat Aviation to purchase them and subsequently lease them back to TAM. Two more were added in 1991. In 1992, TAM carried its eight millionth passenger. By 1993, through the use of the Fokker 100 fleet, which now numbered at 14, TAM was serving 56 cities in Brazil.
In 1996 TAM bought another airline, Helisul Linhas Aéreas, which used the trade name of TAM. In 1997, TAM ordered its first large jets; the airline ordered 45 planes from Airbus, including 10 A330s, 4 A319s, and 34 A320s. In 1997, the Airbuses began to be delivered and the airline flew its first international service, from São Paulo to Miami International Airport.
Two years later, in 1999, services to Europe were inaugurated through a code share service with Air France, to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. In 2000, the airline was renamed TAM Linhas Aéreas in Portuguese. Long running discussions to merge with Varig ended in 2004. In 2008, TAM transported 30,144,000 passengers, with an average load factor of 71%.Airways magazine, Fast Facts - TAM Linhas Aereas, February 2010, p. 25 As of 2010, the airline is owned by the Amaro family (46.25%), Amaro Aviation Part (3.52%), treasury stocks (0.27%) and minority shareholders (49.96%). It employs 24,000 staff. On May 13, 2010, TAM became the 27th member of Star Alliance.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/press/tam-launch-prp/ | title=TAM Airlines joins Star Alliance | date=13 May 2010 | publisher=Star Alliance | accessdate=28 August 2010[/tpl]

On March 30, 2011, TAM signed a letter of intentions to purchase up to 31% of the shares of TRIP Linhas Aéreas, a regional airline which code-shares with TAM since 2004.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.valoronline.com.br/online/geral/87/405493/tam-negocia-com-trip-e-pode-ter-participacao-de-31-na-aerea-regional | title=TAM negocia com TRIP e pode ter participação de 31% na aérea regional | publisher=Valor Online | date=March 30, 2011 | accessdate=April 18, 2011 | language=Portuguese | first=Ana Luísa | last=Westphalen[/tpl] A final decision had however been postponed,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.valor.com.br/empresas/1102036/tam-reforca-gestao-do-mercado-interno | title=TAM reforça gestão do mercado interno | publisher=Valor Econômico | date=November 21, 2011 | accessdate=December 13, 2011 | language=Portuguese | first=Alberto | last=Komatsu[/tpl] and finally in February 2012 the purchase agreement was not renewed.

On 23 January 2013, the Jet Airliner Crash Data Evaluation Centre (JACDEC) announced that TAM Airlines had the second worst safety record in the world. The ratings take into account the number and deadliness of the hull losses (destroyed airplanes) they have suffered in the past 30 years, how they have fared more recently, and how many flights they have flown without incident. The results do not take into account the cause of the hull losses, or whether the airline is at fault, so they are not a perfect measure of how safely an airline behaves.[tpl]cite web | first=Alex | last=Davies | url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/worlds-10-most-dangerous-airlines-171800816.html | title=The World's 10 Most Dangerous Airlines | publisher=Yahoo Finance | date=January 23, 2013 | accessdate=January 23, 2013[/tpl]

===Agreement with LAN to create LATAM Airlines Group===

===Subsidiaries===

In 1994 TAM Airlines established a small subsidiary airline in Paraguay called ARPA - Aerolíneas Paraguayas with a fleet consisting mostly of Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft, formerly operated by TAM. On September 1, 1996, TAM via ARPA, purchased 80% of the shares of the former state-owned LAP – Líneas Aéreas Paraguayas and merged it with ARPA. The new airline was named TAM – Transportes Aéreos del Mercosur and maintained the IATA code of LAP, PZ. Today TAM owns 94.98% and the Paraguayan government 5.02% of the shares.
In 2008, following a branding strategy, the name TAM Mercosur was dropped and the airline adopted an identical corporate identity of TAM Airlines. However, its corporate structure remains the same.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS143061+26-May-2008+PRN20080526 | title=TAM Airlines Consolidates Fleet and Initiates New Air Network | publisher=Reuters | date=May 26, 2008 | accessdate=February 2, 2009[/tpl] This airline is today informally known as TAM Paraguay, and uses the IATA code PZ.
On December 21, 2009, TAM Airlines purchased Pantanal Linhas Aéreas. TAM, however, decided to maintain Pantanal as a different airline within the TAM Group and integrated into its network of TAM.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/economia,tam-compra-pantanal-linhas-aereas-por-r-13-milhoes,485269,0.htm | title=TAM compra Pantanal Linhas Aéreas por R$13 milhões | publisher=O Estado de São Paulo | date=21 December 2009 | accessdate=28 August 2010 | language=Portuguese[/tpl] Presently Pantanal operates flights on behalf of TAM, all with origin and destination at São-Paulo-Congonhas Airport.
