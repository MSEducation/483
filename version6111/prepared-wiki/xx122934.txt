In 1981, President Ronald Reagan nominated Miner to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/Judgesbio.htm#RJM|title=Biographical information: Roger J.

In January 1987 Miner and Jon O. Newman heard Salinger v. Random House, deciding that with unpublished works the right of the copyright owner to control publication took precedence over the right of "fair use".[ref]

In 1987 after Robert Bork's Supreme Court nomination was rejected by the Senate, President Reagan considered appointing Miner. However, due to his refusal to disclose his position on abortion, Reagan nominated Anthony Kennedy instead. Kirsten Gillibrand, the junior Senator from New York, served as his law clerk from 1992-1993.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/nyregion/roger-j-miner-judge-who-valued-neutrality-dies-at-77.html | work=The New York Times | first=Douglas | last=Martin | title=Roger J.
