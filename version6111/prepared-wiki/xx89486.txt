The Conservatorio Nacional Superior de Música is a music school in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
The Conservatorio Nacional was founded, among others, by Argentine musician Carlos López Buchardo on July 7, 1924, during the presidency of Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear. Upon the death of Buchardo at the end of 1948, the Conservatoire is renamed after its first director, and has since then been known as Conservatorio "Carlos López Buchardo".
The National Conservatoire was divided in 1989 into the present and independent Escuela Nacional de Música (basic and first levels) and the Conservatorio Nacional Superior de Música (middle and high levels).
In 1995, the middle level of the National Conservatorium is assigned to the government of the city of Buenos Aires, which is in 1998 named Conservatorio de Música de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires.
