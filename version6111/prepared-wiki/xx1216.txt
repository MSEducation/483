In addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore."Poll: In a changing nation, Santa endures", Associated Press, December 22, 2006. Retrieved 2009-11-18. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity among both Christians and non-Christians, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. The economic impact of Christmas is a factor that has grown steadily over the past few centuries in many regions of the world.

==Etymology==

"Christmas" is a compound word originating in the term "Christ's Mass". It is derived from the Middle English Cristemasse, which is from Old English Crīstesmæsse, a phrase first recorded in 1038 followed by the word Cristes-messe in 1131.Cyril Charles Martindale, "Christmas", in The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3, New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908 (accessed 2012-12-21) Crīst (genitive Crīstes) is from Greek Khrīstos (Χριστός), a translation of Hebrew Māšîaḥ (מָשִׁיחַ), "Messiah", meaning "anointed";[tpl]cite book|title=God's human face: the Christ-icon |first=Christoph |last=Schoenborn |year=1994 |isbn=0-89870-514-2 |page=154[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Sinai and the Monastery of St. Catherine |first=John |last=Galey |year=1986 |isbn=977-424-118-5 |page=92[/tpl] and mæsse is from Latin missa, the celebration of the Eucharist. The form "Christenmas" was also historically used, but is now considered archaic and dialectal;Christenmas, n., Oxford English Dictionary. Retrieved December 12. it derives from Middle English Cristenmasse, literally "Christian mass"."Christmas" in the Middle English Dictionary "Xmas" is an abbreviation of Christmas found particularly in print, based on the initial letter chi (Χ) in Greek Khrīstos (Χριστός), "Christ", though numerous style guides discourage its use;Griffiths, Emma, "Why get cross about Xmas?", BBC website, December 22, 2004. Retrieved 2011-12-12. it has precedent in Middle English Χρ̄es masse (where "Χρ̄" is an abbreviation for Χριστός).

===Other names===

In addition to "Christmas", the holiday has been known by various other names throughout its history. The Anglo-Saxons referred to the feast as "midwinter",Hutton, Ronald, The stations of the sun: a history of the ritual year, Oxford University Press, 2001."Midwinter" in Bosworth & Toller or, more rarely, as Nātiuiteð (from Latin nātīvitās below).Serjeantson, Mary Sidney, A History of Foreign Words in English "Nativity", meaning "birth", is from Latin nātīvitās.nativity, Online Etymology Dictionary In Old English, Gēola ("Yule") referred to the period corresponding to January and December, which was eventually equated with Christian Christmas.yule, Online Etymology Dictionary. Retrieved December 12. "Noel" (or "Nowell") entered English in the late 14th century and is from the Old French noël or naël, itself ultimately from the Latin nātālis (diēs), "(day) of birth".noel'' Online Etymology Dictionary.

==History==

The Chronography of 354 AD contains early evidence of the celebration on December 25 of a Christian liturgical feast of the birth of Jesus. This was in Rome, while in Eastern Christianity the birth of Jesus was already celebrated in connection with the Epiphany on January 6.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=Wainwright+%22epiphany+is+older%22&btnG= |title=Geoffrey Wainwright, Karen Beth Westerfield Tucker (editors), The Oxford History of Christian Worship (Oxford University Press 2005 ISBN 978-0-19-513886-3), p. 65 |publisher=Google.com |accessdate=2012-02-03[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Traditional_Festivals_An_Multicultur.html?id=ANxZYgEACAAJ= |title=Christian Roy, Traditional Festivals: A Multicultural Encyclopedia (ABC-CLIO 2005 ISBN 978-1-57607-089-5) p. 146 |publisher=Google.com |accessdate=2012-02-03[/tpl] The December 25 celebration was imported into the East later: in Antioch by John Chrysostom towards the end of the 4th century, probably in 388, and in Alexandria only in the following century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=Hastings+%22been+between+400+and+432%22&btnG= |title=James Hastings, John A. Selbie (editors), Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (reproduction by Kessinger Publishing Company 2003 ISBN 978-0-7661-3676-2), Part 6, pp. 603–604 |publisher=Google.com |accessdate=2012-02-03[/tpl] Even in the West, the January 6 celebration of the nativity of Jesus seems to have continued until after 380.Hastings and Selbie, p. 605 In 245, Origen of Alexandria, writing about [tpl]bibleverse||Leviticus|12:1–8|ESV[/tpl], commented that Scripture mentions only sinners as celebrating their birthdays, namely Pharaoh, who then had his chief baker hanged ([tpl]bibleverse||Genesis|40:20–22|ESV[/tpl]), and Herod, who then had John the Baptist beheaded ([tpl]bibleverse||Mark|6:21–27|ESV[/tpl]), and mentions saints as cursing the day of their birth, namely Jeremiah ([tpl]bibleverse||Jeremiah|20:14–15|ESV[/tpl]) and Job ([tpl]bibleverse||Job|3:1–16|ESV[/tpl]).Origen, "Levit., Hom. VIII"; Migne P.G., XII, 495. partially quoted in "Natal Day", The Catholic Encyclopedia, 1911. In 303, Arnobius ridiculed the idea of celebrating the birthdays of gods, a passage cited as evidence that Arnobius was unaware of any nativity celebration.McCracken, George, Arnobius of Sicca, the Case Against the Pagans, Volume 2, p. 83, . "Therefore if this is a fact, how can Jupiter be god if it is agreed that god is everlasting, while the other is represented by you to have a birthday, and frightened by the new experience, to have squalled like an infant." G. Brunner, "Arnobius eine Zeuge gegen das Weihnachtsfest? " JLW 13 (1936) pp. 178–181. Since Christmas does not celebrate Christ's birth "as God" but "as man", this is not evidence against Christmas being a feast at this time. The fact the Donatists of North Africa celebrated Christmas may indicate that the feast was established by the time that church was created in 311.
Many popular customs associated with Christmas developed independently of the commemoration of Jesus' birth, with certain elements having origins in pre-Christian festivals that were celebrated around the winter solstice by pagan populations who were later converted to Christianity. These elements, including the Yule log from Yule and gift giving from Saturnalia, became syncretized into Christmas over the centuries. The prevailing atmosphere of Christmas has also continually evolved since the holiday's inception, ranging from a sometimes raucous, drunken, carnival-like state in the Middle Ages,Murray, Alexander, "Medieval Christmas", History Today, December 1986, 36 (12), pp. 31 – 39. to a tamer family-oriented and children-centered theme introduced in a 19th-century reformation.Les Standiford.
