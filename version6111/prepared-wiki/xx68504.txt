==V-2 rockets==

The first of 300 railroad cars of V-2 rocket components began to arrive at Las Cruces, New Mexico in July 1945 for transfer to WSPG.[tpl]Rp|246[/tpl] Launch Area 1 Army blockhouse (Launch Complex 33) was completed in September. In November General Electric employees began to identify, sort, and reassemble V-2 rocket components in Building 1538, designated as Assembly Building 1. German rocket scientists of Operation Paperclip arrived at Fort Bliss in January 1946 to assist the V-2 rocket testing program. After a static test firing of a V-2 engine on 15 March 1946, the first V-2 rocket launch from Launch Complex 33 was on 16 April 1946. Approximately two V-2 launches per month were scheduled from Launch Complex 33 until the German rocket scientists transferred from Fort Bliss to Redstone Arsenal in 1949. Remaining V-2 rockets were launched from Launch Complex 33 on a reduced frequency until 1952. Launch Complex 33 was designated a National Historic Landmark on 3 October 1985.[tpl]cite web |title=White Sands V-2 Launching Site |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/aviation/whi.htm |work= Aviation: From Sand Dunes to Sonic Booms |accessdate=7 October 2008 [/tpl][tpl]gutenberg author | id=White+Sands+Missile+Range+Public+Affairs+Office | name=White Sands Missile Range Public Affairs Office |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/278[/tpl] Refurbished Mittelwerk V-2 rocket #FZ04/20919 was returned to the WSMR Museum in May 2004 after being taken to the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center in September 2002 for restoration.
