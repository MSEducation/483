==Career==

Voronov began skating in 1991. He broke his collarbone two years later while skating. Voronov was coached by Rafael Arutyunyan in Moscow until 2000 when Arutyunyan moved to the U.S. Voronov decided to move to Saint Petersburg where he was coached by Galina Kashina for two years and then switched to Alexei Urmanov.
Voronov withdrew from the 2005 World Junior Championships after the qualifying round due to an injury which kept him off the ice for three months. He had placed sixth in the qualifying round. He withdrew from the 2007 Skate Canada International before the event due to a recurring foot injury.
Voronov placed fourth in the free skate at the 2008 World Championships and finished 7th overall.
In the 2009–10 season, Voronov was assigned to the 2009 Cup of China, where he took bronze, and 2009 Trophée Eric Bompard, where he was sixth. He won the silver medal at the 2010 Russian national championships. Voronov was sent to Europeans but his 14th place result led Russia to assign the country's second men's spot at the Olympics and Worlds to Russian national bronze medalist Artem Borodulin (along with Evgeni Plushenko). Plushenko's withdrawal from the 2010 World Championships due to injury allowed Voronov to be called up as a late replacement. Voronov would place 14th. This placement, along with Borodulin's withdrawal during the competition, meant Russia would have one men's berth to the 2011 World Championships. At the end of the season, he left coach Alexei Urmanov and moved back to Moscow to be coached by Nikolai Morozov.
For the 2010–11 season, Voronov was assigned to the 2010 Cup of China and the 2010 Trophée Eric Bompard. He was injured during the short program at Cup of China and withdrew from the event and from Trophee Bompard. He competed at Russian Nationals where he placed 10th in the short program, 3rd in the long, and 4th overall, just 0.27 points off the podium.
Voronov finished 17th at the 2012 World Championships in Nice, France. He withdrew from the 2012 World Team Trophy due to an ankle fracture which he sustained in Nice.
Voronov won the bronze medal at the 2012 Cup of China, his third Grand Prix medal. He finished 7th at the 2012 NHK Trophy and won the silver medal at the 2013 Russian Championships. On 4 April 2013, Morozov confirmed that Voronov had left his group.
Voronov joined Eteri Tutberidze and Sergei Dudakov. In the 2013–14 season, he won silver at his first event, the 2013 Finlandia Trophy. He was assigned to one ISU Grand Prix event at the 2013 NHK Trophy and finished 9th. He won the gold medal at the 2013 Golden Spin of Zagreb and then won the bronze medal at the 2014 Russian Championships. Appearing in his 6th European Championships, Voronov won the silver medal with a new Personal Best overall score of 252.55 points.
