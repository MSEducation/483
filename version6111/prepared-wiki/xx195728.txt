A thin strip of land between Moulton Business Park and Boughton Lane, this boundary park that is a remnant of a historic Deer Park and part of a Royal Warren, has history extending back to the 13th Century. The Park has a link to the Brickyard Spinney on its Eastern edge and bears a ridge and furrow on its South side, indicating its agricultural heritage. Remnants of a dry stone wall link its history to that of a natural boundary.
