[[Padilla (spider)]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Padilla is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Almost all described species are endemic to Madagascar, with one species only occurring on Java.
Most males in this genus have a characteristic very long, forward projecting process on each chelicera, which looks like a lance which has been bent near the tip. It is missing in P. javana. The genitalia of both sexes of a Padilla species are drawn in Proszynski (1987), and resemble those of Marengo.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 276f
