==Uses today==

===Coal as fuel===

Coal is primarily used as a solid fuel to produce electricity and heat through combustion. World coal consumption was about 7.25 billion tonnes in 2010World coal consumption 2000–2011 EIA statistics (7.99 billion short tons) and is expected to increase 48% to 9.05 billion tonnes (9.98 billion short tons) by 2030.EIA, World Energy Projections Plus (2009) China produced 3.47 billion tonnes (3.83 billion short tons) in 2011. India produced about 578 million tonnes (637.1 million short tons) in 2011. 68.7% of China's electricity comes from coal. The USA consumed about 13% of the world total in 2010, i.e. 951 million tonnes (1.05 billion short tons), using 93% of it for generation of electricity.U.S. Coal Supply and Demand: 2010 Year in Review.

When coal is used for electricity generation, it is usually pulverized and then combusted (burned) in a furnace with a boiler. The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin turbines which turn generators and create electricity. The thermodynamic efficiency of this process has been improved over time. Simple cycle steam turbines have topped out with some of the most advanced reaching about 35% thermodynamic efficiency for the entire process. Increasing the combustion temperature can boost this efficiency even further.[tpl]cite web | title = Fossil Power Generation | publisher = Siemens AG | url = http://w1.siemens.com/responsibility/en/environment/portfolio/fossil_power_generation.htm | accessdate =23 April 2009[/tpl] Old coal power plants, especially "grandfathered" plants, are significantly less efficient and produce higher levels of waste heat.

===Coking coal and use of coke===

Coke is a solid carbonaceous residue derived from low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal from which the volatile constituents are driven off by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000 °C (1,832 °F), so the fixed carbon and residual ash are fused together. Metallurgical coke is used as a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace.Blast furnace steelmaking cost model. Steelonthenet.com. Retrieved on 24 August 2012. The result is pig iron, and is too rich in dissolved carbon, so it must be treated further to make steel. The coking coal should be low in sulfur and phosphorus, so they do not migrate to the metal.
The coke must be strong enough to resist the weight of overburden in the blast furnace, which is why coking coal is so important in making steel using the conventional route. However, the alternative route is direct reduced iron, where any carbonaceous fuel can be used to make sponge or pelletised iron. Coke from coal is grey, hard, and porous and has a heating value of 24.8 million Btu/ton (29.6 MJ/kg). Some cokemaking processes produce valuable byproducts, including coal tar, ammonia, light oils, and coal gas.
Petroleum coke is the solid residue obtained in oil refining, which resembles coke, but contains too many impurities to be useful in metallurgical applications.

===Gasification===

Coal gasification can be used to produce syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) gas. This syngas can then be converted into transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, through the Fischer-Tropsch process. This technology is currently used by the Sasol chemical company of South Africa to make motor vehicle fuels from coal and natural gas. Alternatively, the hydrogen obtained from gasification can be used for various purposes, such as powering a hydrogen economy, making ammonia, or upgrading fossil fuels.
During gasification, the coal is mixed with oxygen and steam while also being heated and pressurized. During the reaction, oxygen and water molecules oxidize the coal into carbon monoxide (CO), while also releasing hydrogen gas (H2). This process has been conducted in both underground coal mines and in the production of town gas.
If the refiner wants to produce gasoline, the syngas is collected at this state and routed into a Fischer-Tropsch reaction. If hydrogen is the desired end-product, however, the syngas is fed into the water gas shift reaction, where more hydrogen is liberated.
In the past, coal was converted to make coal gas (town gas), which was piped to customers to burn for illumination, heating, and cooking.

===Liquefaction===

Coal can also be converted into synthetic fuels equivalent to gasoline or diesel by several different processes. In the direct liquefaction processes, the coal is either hydrogenated or carbonized. Hydrogenation processes are the Bergius process,[tpl]Cite journal| first = Robert|last= Haul| title = Friedrich Bergius (1884–1949)| page =  62 |journal = Chemie in unserer Zeit| publisher =  VCH-Verlagsgesellschaft mbH| volume= 19|date= April 1985[/tpl] the SRC-I and SRC-II (Solvent Refined Coal) processes and the NUS Corporation hydrogenation process. In the process of low-temperature carbonization, coal is coked at temperatures between 360 and 750 °C (680 and 1,380 °F). These temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar. The coal tar is then further processed into fuels. Alternatively, coal can be converted into a gas first, and then into a liquid, by using the Fischer-Tropsch process. An overview of coal liquefaction and its future potential is available.[tpl]cite journal|author=Höök, M., Aleklett, K.|url=http://www.tsl.uu.se/uhdsg/Publications/CTL_Article.pdf |doi=10.1002/er.1596|title=A review on coal-to-liquid fuels and its coal consumption|year=2010|journal=International Journal of Energy Research|volume=34|issue=10|pages=848[/tpl]
Coal liquefaction methods involve carbon dioxide ([tpl]CO2[/tpl]) emissions in the conversion process. If coal liquefaction is done without employing either carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies or biomass blending, the result is lifecycle greenhouse gas footprints that are generally greater than those released in the extraction and refinement of liquid fuel production from crude oil. If CCS technologies are employed, reductions of 5–12% can be achieved in Coal to Liquid (CTL) plants and up to a 75% reduction is achievable when co-gasifying coal with commercially demonstrated levels of biomass (30% biomass by weight) in coal/biomass-to-liquids plants. For future synthetic fuel projects, carbon dioxide sequestration is proposed to avoid releasing [tpl]CO2[/tpl] into the atmosphere. Sequestration adds to the cost of production. Currently, all US and at least one Chinese synthetic fuel projects,[tpl]cite news | title=Shenhua Group Starts China's First Coal-to-Fuel Plant | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601072&sid=a3SIXbVZ8JiE&refer=energy | work=Bloomberg | date=6 January 2009[/tpl] include sequestration in their process designs.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]

===Refined coal===

Refined coal is the product of a coal-upgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite (brown) coals. It is one form of several precombustion treatments and processes for coal that alter coal's characteristics before it is burned. The goals of precombustion coal technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when the coal is burned. Depending on the situation, precombustion technology can be used in place of or as a supplement to postcombustion technologies to control emissions from coal-fueled boilers.

===Industrial processes [tpl]anchor|Industrial processes[/tpl]===

Finely ground bituminous coal, known in this application as sea coal, is a constituent of foundry sand. While the molten metal is in the mould, the coal burns slowly, releasing reducing gases at pressure, and so preventing the metal from penetrating the pores of the sand. It is also contained in 'mould wash', a paste or liquid with the same function applied to the mould before casting.[tpl]cite book|last=Rao|first=P.

==Economic aspects==

Coal (by liquefaction technology) is one of the backstop resources that could limit escalation of oil prices and mitigate the effects of transportation energy shortage that will occur under peak oil. This is contingent on liquefaction production capacity becoming large enough to satiate the very large and growing demand for petroleum. Estimates of the cost of producing liquid fuels from coal suggest that domestic U.S. production of fuel from coal becomes cost-competitive with oil priced at around $35 per barrel,[tpl]cite news | title=Diesel Fuel News: Ultra-clean fuels from coal liquefaction: China about to launch big projects – Brief Article | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYH/is_15_6/ai_89924477 |accessdate=9 September 2005 | work=Diesel Fuel News | first=Jack | last=Peckham | year=2002[/tpl] with the $35 being the break-even cost. With oil prices as low as around $40 per barrel in the U.S. as of December 2008, liquid coal lost some of its economic allure in the U.S., but will probably be re-vitalized, similar to oil sand projects, with an oil price around $70 per barrel.
In China, due to an increasing need for liquid energy in the transportation sector, coal liquefaction projects were given high priority even during periods of oil prices below $40 per barrel.[tpl]cite news |author=Tingting, Si and Jing, Li  | title=Coal-to-liquids project rescheduled to launch in early 2009 | url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-12/12/content_7300666.htm |date=12 December 2008 |accessdate=12 December 2008 |newspaper=China Daily[/tpl] This is probably because China prefers not to be dependent on foreign oil, instead utilizing its enormous domestic coal reserves.

This place has been well-known since the time of Herodotus, but European geographers misinterpreted the Ancient Greek descriptions as the evidence of active volcanism in Turkestan (up to the 19th century, when the Russian army invaded the area).[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
The reddish siltstone rock that caps many ridges and buttes in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and in western North Dakota is called porcelanite, which resembles the coal burning waste "clinker" or volcanic "scoria".[tpl]cite web | title=North Dakota's Clinker | url=http://www.state.nd.us/ndgs/ndnotes/ndn13_h.htm | accessdate=9 September 2005[/tpl] Clinker is rock that has been fused by the natural burning of coal. In the Powder River Basin approximately 27 to 54 billion tons of coal burned within the past three million years.[tpl]cite web | title=BLM-Environmental Education- The High Plains | url=http://www.blm.gov/education/high_plains/article.html |accessdate=9 September 2005 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20050312133748/http://www.blm.gov/education/high_plains/article.html |archivedate = 12 March 2005[/tpl] Wild coal fires in the area were reported by the Lewis and Clark Expedition as well as explorers and settlers in the area.[tpl]cite web | title=Pyrophoricity (spontaneous combustion) of Powder River Basin coals: Considerations for coalbed methane development| url=http://www.wsgs.uwyo.edu/Coal/CR01-1.pdf | accessdate=9 September 2005|format=PDF |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20050912063721/http://www.wsgs.uwyo.edu/Coal/CR01-1.pdf|archivedate = 12 September 2005|author=Lyman, Robert M. and Volkmer, John E.|date=March 2001[/tpl]

==Production trends==

In 2006, China was the top producer of coal with 38% share followed by the United States and India, according to the British Geological Survey. As of 2012 coal production in the United States was falling at the rate of 7% annually[tpl]cite web|title=EIA projects little change in U.S. coal production in 2013|url=http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=9010|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Agency|accessdate=20 December 2012|date=3 December 2012[/tpl] with many power plants using coal shut down or converted to natural gas; however, some of the reduced domestic demand was taken up by increased exports[tpl]cite news|title=Power Company Loses Some of Its Appetite for Coal|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/business/energy-environment/aep-has-plan-to-close-kentuckys-big-sandy-power-plant.html|accessdate=20 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 December 2012|author=Lipton, Eric [/tpl] with five coal export terminals being proposed in the Pacific Northwest to export coal from the Powder River Basin to China and other Asian markets;[tpl]cite news|title=NW governors ask White House to exam coal exports|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/energy/article/NW-governors-ask-White-House-to-exam-coal-exports-4383234.php|accessdate=March 26, 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=March 25, 2013|author=Le, Phuong |agency=Associated Press[/tpl] however, as of 2013, environmental opposition was increasing.[tpl]cite news|title=Coal Industry Pins Hopes on Exports as U.S. Market Shrinks|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/business/energy-environment/a-fight-over-coal-exports-and-the-industrys-future.html|accessdate=June 15, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 14, 2013|author=Clifford Krauss[/tpl] High-sulfur coal mined in Illinois which was unsaleable in the United States found a ready market in Asia as exports reached 13 million tons in 2012.[tpl]cite news|title=Report: Ill. coal enjoyed record exports in 2012|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/energy/article/Report-Ill-coal-enjoyed-record-exports-in-2012-4480173.php|accessdate=May 2, 2013|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|agency=Associated Press|date=May 1, 2013|author=Suhr, Jim [/tpl]

===World coal reserves===

The 948 billion short tons of recoverable coal reserves estimated by the Energy Information Administration are equal to about 4,196 BBOE (billion barrels of oil equivalent).[tpl]cite web | title=EIA International Energy Statistics : Coal : Recoverable Reserves | url=http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=1&pid=7&aid=6| accessdate=31 May 2012[/tpl] The amount of coal burned during 2007 was estimated at 7.075 billion short tons, or 133.179 quadrillion BTU's.[tpl]cite web | title=EIA International Energy Statistics : Coal : Consumption | url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=1&pid=1&aid=2 |accessdate=10 June 2009[/tpl] This is an average of 18.8 million BTU per short ton. In terms of heat content, this is about [tpl]convert|57000000|oilbbl[/tpl] of oil equivalent per day. By comparison in 2007, natural gas provided [tpl]convert|51000000|oilbbl[/tpl] of oil equivalent per day, while oil provided [tpl]convert|85800000|oilbbl|m3[/tpl] per day.
British Petroleum, in its 2007 report, estimated at 2006 end that there were 147 years reserves-to-production ratio based on proven coal reserves worldwide. This figure only includes reserves classified as "proven"; exploration drilling programs by mining companies, particularly in under-explored areas, are continually providing new reserves. In many cases, companies are aware of coal deposits that have not been sufficiently drilled to qualify as "proven". However, some nations haven't updated their information and assume reserves remain at the same levels even with withdrawals. Speculative projections predict that global peak coal production may occur sometime around 2025 at 30 percent above current production, depending on future coal production rates.Coal: Resources and Future Production, Energy Watch group, 28 March 2007 (revised 10 July 2007)
Of the three fossil fuels, coal has the most widely distributed reserves; coal is mined in over 100 countries, and on all continents except Antarctica. The largest reserves are found in the United States, Russia, China, Australia and India. Note the table below.

===Major coal producers===

The reserve life is an estimate based only on current production levels and proved reserves level for the countries shown, and makes no assumptions of future production or even current production trends. Countries with annual production higher than 100 million tonnes are shown. For comparison, data for the European Union is also shown.
Shares are based on data expressed in tonnes oil equivalent.

===Major coal consumers===

Countries with annual consumption higher than xx million tonnes are shown.

===Major coal exporters===

Countries with annual gross export higher than 10 million tonnes are shown. In terms of net export the largest exporters are still Australia (328.1 millions tonnes), Indonesia (316.2) and Russia (100.2).

===Major coal importers===

Countries with annual gross import higher than 20 million tonnes are shown. In terms of net import the largest importers are still Japan (206.0 millions tonnes), China (172.4) and South Korea (125.8).EIA International Energy Annual: Coal Overview 2010. Eia.gov. Retrieved on 24 August 2012.
