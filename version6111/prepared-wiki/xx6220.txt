==Marriage and family==

She met George W. Bush in July 1977 when mutual friends Joe and Jan O'Neill invited her and Bush to a backyard barbecue at their home. He proposed to her at the end of September and they were married on November 5 of that year at the First United Methodist Church in Midland, the same church in which she had been baptized. Laura bought a tan, two-toned dress off the rack for the wedding.[tpl]cite news|title=[tpl]-'[/tpl]We Need To Pay More Attention To Boys' (First Lady Laura Bush)|first=Lyric Wallwork|last= Winik|work=Parade|date=January 16, 2005|accessdate=April 21, 2011|url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_01-16-2005/featured_0 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080601094302/http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_01-16-2005/featured_0|archivedate=March 22, 2006[/tpl] The couple honeymooned in Cozumel, Mexico.[tpl]cite book |title=Spoken from the Heart |last=Bush |first=Laura |year=2010 |publisher=Scribner |isbn=978-1-4391-5520-2[/tpl] excerpt available at Oprah.com.
The year after their marriage, the couple began campaigning for George W. Bush's 1978 Congressional candidacy.  According to George Bush, when he asked her to marry him, she had said, "Yes. But only if you promise me that I'll never have to make a campaign speech." She soon relented, and gave her first stump speech for him in 1978 on the courthouse steps in Muleshoe, Texas.[tpl]cite news|title=Laura Welch Bush: Shy no more|first=John|last=Hanchette|newspaper=USA Today|date=Juse 23, 2000|accessdate=April 21, 2011|url= http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/e2147.htm[/tpl] After narrowly winning the primary, he lost the general election.
The Bushes had tried to conceive for three years, but pregnancy did not happen easily. On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna. The twins were born five weeks early by an emergency Caesarean section, as Laura had developed life-threatening pre-eclampsia (toxemia). The twins graduated from high school in 2000 and attended Yale University and the University of Texas at Austin, respectively, in 2004. To date, Bush is the only First Lady to have given birth to twins.
George W. Bush credited his wife with his decision to stop drinking in 1986.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/bush/articles/2000/01/23/george_w_bush/|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20040507200414/www.boston.com/news/politics/president/bush/articles/2000/01/23/george_w_bush/|title=Turning Point: George W.

According to People magazine reporter Jane Simms Podesta, "She is the steel in his back. She is a civilizing influence on him. I think she built him, in many ways, into the person he is today."
Several times a year, Bush and her husband travel to their sprawling family estate, the Bush compound, better known as Walker's Point. Located in Kennebunkport, Maine, the compound is where Bush family gatherings have been held for nearly 100 years.

==First Lady of Texas==

Bush became the First Lady of Texas when her husband was elected as the Governor of Texas and served as first lady of that state from January 17, 1995, to December 21, 2000. When asked about her interest in politics, she responded, "It doesn't drive me."
Though during her years in the Governor's Mansion, she did not hold a single formal event, Laura worked for women's and children's causes including health, education, and literacy. She implemented four major initiatives: Take Time For Kids, an awareness campaign to educate parents and caregivers on parenting; family literacy, through cooperation with the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, she urged Texas communities to establish family literacy programs; Reach Out and Read, a pediatric reading program; and Ready to Read, an early childhood educational program.
She raised money for public libraries through her establishment of the Texas Book Festival, and established the First Lady's Family Literacy Initiative, which encouraged families to read together. Bush further established "Rainbow Rooms" across the state, in an effort to provide emergency services for neglected or abused children. Through this, she promoted the Adopt-a-Caseworker Program to provide support for Child Protective Services. She used her position to advocate Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer awareness as well.
Her husband announced his campaign for President of the United States in mid-1999, something that she agreed to. She did say, however, that she had never dreamed that he would run for office. In July, she delivered a keynote address to the delegates at the 2000 Republican National Convention, which put her on the national stage.[tpl]cite news|url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E5DF113DF932A3575BC0A9669C8B63 |title=The Republicans; Excerpts From Laura Bush's Speech to the G.O.P.

==First Lady of the United States==

As First Lady, Bush was involved in issues of concern to children and women, both nationally and internationally. Her major initiatives included education and women's health.

===Education and children===

Early into the administration, Bush made it known that she would focus much of her attention on education. This included recruiting highly qualified teachers to ensure that young children would be taught well. She also focused on early child development. In 2001, to promote reading and education, she partnered with the Library of Congress to launch the annual National Book Festival. In January 2002, Bush testified before the Senate Committee on Education, asking for higher teachers' salaries and better training for Head Start programs. She is also credited with creating a national initiative called "Ready to Read, Ready to Learn", which promotes reading at a young age. To promote American patriotic heritage in schools, she helped launch the National Anthem Project. In 2006, Bush and media executives worked together to provide a $500,000 grant for school libraries along the Gulf Coast which had been devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Immediately following the September 11, 2001 attacks, Bush spoke regarding America's children:
 
 We need to reassure our children that they are safe in their homes and schools. We need to reassure them that many people love them and care for them, and that while there are some bad people in the world, there are many more good people.
The following day, she composed open letters to America's families, focusing on elementary and middle school students, which she distributed through state education officials. She took an interest in mitigating the emotional effects of the attacks on children, particularly the disturbing images repeatedly replayed on television. On the one-year anniversary, she encouraged parents to instead read to their children, and perhaps light a candle in memoriam, saying, "Don't let your children see the images, especially on September 11, when you know it'll probably be on television again and again – the plane hitting the building or the buildings falling."
Later in her tenure, she was honored by the United Nations, as the body named her honorary ambassador for the United Nations' Decade of Literacy. In this position, she announced that she would host a Conference on Global Literacy.[tpl]cite web|title=Secretary Spellings Spoke at UNESCO's 'Education for All' Event|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2006/04/04242006a.html|date=April 26, 2006|accessdate=May 26, 2008|publisher=U.S. Department of Education[/tpl] The conference, held in September 2006, encouraged a constant effort to promote literacy and highlighted many successful literacy programs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/09/20060918-1.html|title=Mrs. Laura Bush Hosts White House Conference on Global Literacy|accessdate=May 26, 2008|publisher= The White House|date=September 18, 2006[/tpl] She coordinated this as a result of her many trips abroad where she witnessed how literacy benefited children in poorer nations.

===Women's health===

Another of her signature issues were those relating to the health and well being of women. She established the Women's Health and Wellness Initiative and became involved with two major campaigns.
Bush first became involved with The Heart Truth awareness campaign in 2003. It is an organization established by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to raise awareness about heart disease in women, and how to prevent the condition.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/whatis/index.htm|title=What is The Heart Truth?|accessdate=May 25, 2008|publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080514064711/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/whatis/index.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2003[/tpl] She serves in the honorary position of ambassador for the program leading the federal government's effort to give women a "wake up call" about the risk of heart disease. She commented on the disease: "Like many women, I assumed heart disease was a man's disease and cancer was what we would fear the most. Yet heart disease kills more women in our country than all forms of cancer combined. When it comes to heart disease, education, prevention, and even a little red dress can save lives." She has undertaken a signature personal element of traveling around the country and talking to women at hospital and community events featuring the experiences of women who live, or had lived, with the condition. This outreach was credited with saving the life of one woman who went to the hospital after experiencing symptoms of a heart attack.
With her predecessor, former First Lady Nancy Reagan, Bush dedicated the First Ladies Red Dress Collection at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in May 2005. It is an exhibit containing red suits worn by former First Ladies Lady Bird Johnson, Betty Ford, Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, and Laura Bush meant to raise awareness by highlighting America's first ladies. She has participated in fashion shows displaying red dresses worn on celebrities as well.
Bush's mother, Jenna Welch, was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 78. She endured surgery and currently has no further signs of cancer. Laura Bush has become a breast cancer activist on her mother's behalf[tpl]cite web|url= http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030312-8.html |title=Remarks by Mrs. Bush at Susan G.

Komen for the Cure. She applauded the foundation's efforts in eliminating cancer and said, "A few short years ago, a diagnosis of breast cancer left little hope of recovery. But thanks to the work of the Komen Foundation... more women and men are beating breast cancer and beating the odds." She used her position to gain international support for the foundation through the Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research of the Americas, an initiative that unites experts from the United States, Brazil, Costa Rica and Mexico.
In November 2001, she became the first person other than a president to deliver the weekly presidential radio address. She used the opportunity to discuss the plight of women in Afghanistan during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, saying, "The brutal oppression of women is a central goal of the terrorists." In May 2002, she made a speech to the people of Afghanistan through Radio Liberty, a radio station in Prague, Czech Republic.

====Laura W. Bush Institute for Women's Health====

In August 2007, the Laura W. Bush Institute for Women's Health (LWBIWH) was founded at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. This institute aims to integrate research, education and community outreach in a multidisciplinary approach to women's health and has begun efforts to establish a multi-campus women's health institute in Amarillo, El Paso, Lubbock and the Permian Basin.Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center :: LWBIWH : History and More About Us

Former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said, "She is more popular, and more welcome, in many parts of the country than the president... In races where the moderates are in the most trouble, Laura Bush is the one who can do the most good."
She disagreed with Fox News' Chris Wallace in 2006 when Wallace asked why the American people were beginning to lose confidence in President Bush, saying, "Well, I don't think they are. And I don't really believe those polls. I travel around the country, I see people, I see their response to my husband, I see their response to me. There are a lot of difficult challenges right now in the United States... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them... When his polls were really high they weren't on the front page."[tpl]cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/05/20060512-11.html|title=Interview of Mrs. Laura Bush by Fox News|accessdate=May 28, 2008|date=May 12, 2006|publisher=The White House|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080601094302/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/05/20060512-11.html|archivedate=September 12, 2009[/tpl]
During the January 2005 second inauguration ceremonies for her husband, Laura Bush was looked highly upon by People magazine, The Washington Post, and others for her elegance and fashion sense. At the inauguration she wore a winter white cashmere dress and matching coat designed by Oscar de la Renta. Following the inauguration were the inaugural galas, to which Bush wore a pale, aqua lace gown, sprinkled with crystals, with long sleeves in a silver blue mist.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24999-2005Jan20.html|title=Laura Bush, Stepping Out|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=May 27, 2008|author=Givhan, Robin|date=January 21, 2005[/tpl] The tulle gown was also designed for her by de la Renta.

===Foreign trips===

During her husband's second term, Bush was more involved in foreign matters. She traveled to numerous countries as a representative of the United States.
As First Lady, she took five goodwill trips to Africa. The purpose of these has mostly been to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and malaria, but Bush has also stressed the need for education and greater opportunities for women. She has taken many other trips to other countries to promote and gain support for President Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS relief;[tpl]cite news|title=First Lady Laura Bush Tours Haiti To Highlight U.S. HIV/AIDS Programs|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/100788.php |accessdate=May 28, 2008|publisher=Medical News Today|date=March 14, 2008 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080601094302/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/100788.php|archivedate=March 19, 2008[/tpl] these countries include Zambia (2007), Mozambique (2007),[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-06-26-laura-bush-africa_N.htm|title=Laura Bush presses AIDS fight in Africa|accessdate=May 28, 2008|agency=Associated Press|work=USA Today|date=July 2007[/tpl] Mali (2007), Senegal (2007),[tpl]cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200706230037.html|accessdate=May 28, 2008|title=Africa: HIV/Aids, Malaria Focus of Laura Bush's Africa Trip|date=June 22, 2007|author= Terhune, Lea|work=United States Department of State|publisher=AllAfrica.com |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080601094302/http://allafrica.com/stories/200706230037.html|archivedate=November 27, 2007[/tpl] and Haiti (2008).
In mid-2007, she took a trip to Burma where she spoke out in support of the pro-democracy movement, and urged Burmese soldiers and militias to refrain from violence. Later that October, she ventured to the Middle East. Bush said she was in the region in an attempt to improve America's image by highlighting concern for women's health, specifically promoting her breast cancer awareness work with the US-Middle East Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research.Mrs. Bush's Remarks on the U.S.-Saudi Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research She defined the trip as successful, saying that stereotypes were broken on both sides.

===Views on policy===

Bush is a Republican and has identified herself with the GOP since her marriage.
When asked about abortion in 2000, Bush said she did not believe Roe v. Wade should be overturned. She did not comment on whether women had the right to an abortion. She did say, however, that the country should do "what we can to limit the number of abortions, to try to reduce the number of abortions in a lot of ways, and that is, by talking about responsibility with girls and boys, by teaching abstinence, having abstinence classes everywhere in schools and in churches and in Sunday school".
Bush responded to a question during a 2006 interview concerning the Federal Marriage Amendment by calling for elected leaders not to politicize same-sex marriage, "I don't think it should be used as a campaign tool, obviously. It requires a lot of sensitivity to just talk about the issue... a lot of sensitivity."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/05/14/politics/p131514D67.DTL&feed=rss.news|title=Mrs. Bush: Don't Campaign on Marriage Ban|author=Pickler, Nedra|accessdate=December 13, 2006|date =May 14, 2006|agency=Associated Press|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070810084948/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/05/14/politics/p131514D67.DTL&feed=rss.news|archivedate= August 10, 2007[/tpl]
On July 12, 2005, while in South Africa, Bush suggested her husband replace retiring Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O'Connor with another woman.

On May 11, 2010, during an interview on Larry King Live, Bush was asked about same-sex marriage.  She said she views it as a generational issue and said she believes it will be made legal in the future.  Bush offered support for the issue by saying, "...when couples are committed to each other and love each other...they ought to have the same sort of rights that everyone has."  Bush referred to her 2000 interview, reaffirming her support for Roe v. Wade, "I think it's important that abortion remain legal. Because I think it's important for people – that for medical reasons and, and other reasons."[tpl]YouTube|HtNabdDx_mU|Laura Bush For Gay Marriage & Pro-Choice![/tpl] On February 22, 2013, without her consent, she was included in a pro-gay advertisement from the Respect of Marriage Coalition. A statement from Bush's spokesperson states that Bush "did not approve of her inclusion in this advertisement nor is she associated with the group that made the ad in any way. When she became aware of the advertisement last night, we requested that the group remove her from it."

==Libraries==

Bush created the Laura Bush Foundation for America's Libraries "to support the education of our nation's children by providing funds to update, extend, and diversify the book and print collections of America's school libraries". Every year, the Laura Bush Foundation's grants awards more than $1,000,000 to US schools.  The Laura Bush 21st Century Library Program grant, offered by the Institute of Museum and Library Services, provides funding for "the recruitment and education of library students and continuing education for those already in the profession, as well as the development of new programs and curricula".
