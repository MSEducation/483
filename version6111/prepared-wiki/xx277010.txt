A special election for Louisiana's 5th congressional district was held on November 16, 2013, to elect a member of the United States House of Representatives.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20130807/NEWS01/308070027/Special-election-set-Oct-19-qualifying-month|title=Special election set Oct. 19; qualifying this month|date=August 7, 2013|accessdate=August 8, 2013|work=The News-Star|first=Greg|last=Hilburn|location=Monroe, Louisiana[/tpl] Incumbent Republican Congressman Rodney Alexander resigned on September 26, 2013, to become the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs under Governor Bobby Jindal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/08/rodney_alexander_to_join_jinda.html|title=Rodney Alexander to join Jindal administration, departure from Congress will trigger special election|date=August 7, 2013|accessdate=August 8, 2013|work=The Times-Picayune|first=Lauren|last=McGaughy[/tpl]
The primary election was held on October 19, 2013. Under Louisiana's jungle primary system, all candidates appear on the same ballot, regardless of party. As no candidate received 50 percent plus one vote during the primary election, the general election was held on November 16 between the top two candidates in the primary, Republicans Neil Riser, a State Senator from Columbia in Caldwell Parish, and Vance McAllister, a businessman from Swartz.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20131115/NEWS01/131115001/|title=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20131115/NEWS01/131115001/|date=August 7, 2013|accessdate=November 20, 2013|work=thetowntalk.com[/tpl] In the general election, McAllister handily defeated Riser to win the seat.

==Background==

On August 6, 2013, Alexander announced that he would not seek a seventh term in the House in the 2014 congressional elections. He cited his weariness with partisanship in Washington, D.C., as the primary reason for his decision to retire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/315849-rep-alexander-to-retire|title=Alexandra Jaffe, "Rodney Alexander to retire from House"|publisher=thehill.com|accessdate=August 6, 2013[/tpl] On August 7, Alexander moved up his timetable for departure from Congress. He resigned his seat effective September 26. Alexander joined the administration of Governor Bobby Jindal as the new secretary of the Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/home/6722936-125/us-rep-alexander-joining-jindal|title=Jordan Blum, Veterans job speeds D.C. exit|publisher=Baton Rouge Morning Advocate, August 7, 2013|accessdate=August 8, 2013[/tpl]

==Controversy==

The day after Alexander announced his resignation, Republican State Senator Neil Riser publicly declared his candidacy and launched his website. Within days, he had hired a campaign manager and started distributing campaign material. Riser's unusually fast response to the unexpected announcement of the special election led to charges of favoritism by Alexander and Governor Jindal. Specifically, that they colluded to declare Alexander's appointment to the State Cabinet in a surprise announcement and ensure a short filing period so as to benefit Riser, who, it was alleged, knew of Alexander's plans in advance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/08/louisiana_5th_congress_riser_a.html|title=Crowded field, controversy brings uncertainty to Louisiana's 5th Congressional District race|date=August 26, 2013|accessdate=August 28, 2013|work=Nola.com[/tpl]
Riser had filed documents with the Federal Election Commission to run in the special election the day before Alexander announced his resignation, although he claimed that this was a "clerical error" on the part of the FEC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/08/neil_riser_says_fec_made_mista.html|title=Louisiana Sen. Neil Riser says FEC made mistake in candidacy records|date=August 23, 2013|accessdate=August 28, 2013|work=Nola.com[/tpl] Additionally, Riser had traveled through the district for several months with Alexander before the announcement and had been endorsed by every Republican congressman from Louisiana within days. An editorial by The Town Talk said: "If this feels a lot like someone has stolen your vote, well, let’s just say you’re not alone."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20130818/OPINION/308180006/Our-View-Louisiana-s-5th-District-really-early-Riser|title=Our View: In Louisiana's 5th District, a really early Riser|date=August 19, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013|work=The Town Talk[/tpl]
Republican State Representative Jay Morris declared his candidacy and accused Alexander and Jindal of trying to "rig the election", adding that "it appears to me some sort of deal was made to grant an advantage to Riser. It disturbs me and should disturb everyone that an election could be manipulated like this."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/08/special_election_for_alexander.html|title=Jindal administration says special congressional election not rigged |date=August 13, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013|work=Nola.com|first=Lauren|last=McGaughy[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20130813/NEWS01/308130029/Morris-Jindal-Alexander-conspired-rig-election|title=Morris: Jindal, Alexander conspired 'to rig' election |date=August 13, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013|work=The News Star|first=Greg|last=Hilburn[/tpl] Democratic State Senator Rick Gallot had considered joining the race but declined, citing the short time frame and unexpected nature of the announcement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/08/state_sen_rick_gallot_will_not.html|title=State Sen. Rick Gallot will not seek Louisiana's 5th Congressional District seat|date=August 15, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013|work=Nola.com|first=Lauren|last=McGaughy[/tpl] When declaring his candidacy, Democrat Jamie Mayo, the Mayor of Monroe, said that he assumed the allegations were true, "but I'm not doing to cry over spilled milk."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/08/monroe_mayor_jumps_into_5th_co.html|title=Monroe Mayor jumps into 5th congressional district race|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=August 28, 2013|work=Nola.com|first=Lauren|last=McGaughy[/tpl] Republican Public Service Commissioner and former Congressman Clyde C. Holloway said that his candidacy for the seat was motivated by suspicions that Alexander and Jindal wanted Riser to win, saying: "This thing stinks... I feel like we tried to have an appointed congressman by the governor and by Rodney... Without any doubt, I think they've been orchestrating this for months."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/08/21/4251846/5th-district-race-sign-up-period.html|title=14 candidates in 5th District congressional race|date=August 21, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013|work=Charlotte Observer|first=Melinda|last=Deslatte[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20130821/NEWS01/308210028/Monroe-s-Morris-yet-qualify-5th-Cong-Dist-seat-BR-s-Zaitoon-does|title=Fourteen qualify for 5th Congressional District seat|date=August 21, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013|work=Nola.com[/tpl] The state's junior U.S. Senator, Republican David Vitter, declined to make an endorsement and said that "it's a very quick election. And it's obvious that didn't happen by accident." Attorney Ed Tarpley, who had considered running, said that "Everywhere I go without exception people are angry about what happened. short time frame means voters are deprived of the normal election cycle."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/08/a_closer_look_at_louisianas_5t.html|title=A closer look at those scrambling to enter Louisiana's 5th congressional district race|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013|work=Nola.com|first=Lauren|last=McGaughy[/tpl]
The Jindal administration has responded that the election was not rigged, with press secretary Sean Lansing saying: "There is no truth to the claims." Timmy Teepell, who previously worked as a political consultant for Riser and as Jindal's Chief of Staff said: "It's a free country, and nobody is prevented from running. Is two weeks not enough time... to get to Baton Rouge to qualify to run next week?" Alexander said, "There was no deal", and Riser added, "I don’t think it was any secret that I wanted to eventually run for the seat. I've been clear the past two years about my intention to run." After Riser announced that he would run for Congress, Teepell and his Virginia-based On Message, Inc., assumed management of the campaign.[tpl]cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/home/6863564-125/riser-claims-fec-mistaken|title=http://theadvocate.com/home/6863564-125/riser-claims-fec-mistaken|publisher=Baton Rouge Morning Advocate, October 14, 2013|accessdate=October 25, 2013[/tpl]

===Polling===

Other polls that were not made public showed that Riser was a "lock" to make the runoff with Holloway "consistently" polling in second place. Morris, McAllister and Mayo also had the potential to make the runoff, with McAllister seen as the most likely to benefit from a slip in support for Holloway.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/louisiana_special_riser_is_sitting_pretty_but_who_will_he_face_in_runoff-228372-1.html|title=Louisiana Special: Riser Is Sitting Pretty, but Who Will He Face in Runoff?|date=October 11, 2013|accessdate=October 15, 2013|work=Roll Call|first=Emily|last=Cahn[/tpl]

===Campaign===

Riser was the heavy favorite to win and McAllister was thought to have little chance of pulling off an upset.[tpl]cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/news/opinion/6773261-123/riser-alexander-and-jindal|title=James Gill: Riser, Alexander and Jindal|date=November 3, 2013|accessdate=November 17, 2013|work=The Advocate|first=James|last=Gill[/tpl] Riser raised and spent more money than McAllister, who largely self-financed his campaign. While Riser was backed by both the Republican establishment and the Tea Party, McAllister boasted endorsements from the stars of the television show Duck Dynasty. During the campaign, McAllister ran to Riser's left, particularly on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Riser spoke only of repealing the law whereas McAllister argued that with a Democratic majority in the Senate, repeal had no chance of success and that the two parties should work together to improve the law. He also emphasised his support for two of its key components: the Medicaid expansion and preventing insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/obamacare-louisiana-republicans-election-99766.html|title=A GOP split over Obamacare in Louisiana race|date=November 12, 2013|accessdate=November 17, 2013|work=Politico|first=Alex|last=Isenstadt[/tpl] Riser campaigned on his experience and his opposition to President Obama.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/17/louisiana-voters-pick-between-two-republicans-to-fill-open-congressional-seat|title=Duck Dynasty'-backed candidate wins Louisiana congressional election|date=November 17, 2013|accessdate=November 17, 2013|work=Fox News[/tpl] McAllister campaigned as a pragmatic outsider and won over voters who were frustrated with Congress and politicians in general.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/viewart/20131116/ELECTION/131116015/Vance-McAllister-wins-5th-District-congressional-seat|title=Vance McAllister wins 5th District congressional seat|date=November 16, 2013|accessdate=November 17, 2013|work=Shreveport Times|first=Melinda|last=Deslatte[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/home/7602498-125/mcallister-apparent-winner-in-5th|title=McAllister apparent winner in 5th District|date=November 17, 2013|accessdate=November 17, 2013|work=The Advocate[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/home/7557395-125/mcallister-is-a-first-time-candidate|title=McAllister is a first-time candidate in the 5th congressional district race|date=November 13, 2013|accessdate=November 17, 2013|work=The Advocate[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/17/republican-vance-mcallister-house-election-louisiana|title=Republican outsider Vance McAllister wins House seat in Louisiana|date=November 17, 2013|accessdate=November 17, 2013|work=The Guardian[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/newcomer-mcallister-wins-special-election-in-louisiana/|title=Newcomer McAllister Wins Special Election in Louisiana|date=November 16, 2013|accessdate=November 17, 2013|work=Roll Call[/tpl]
