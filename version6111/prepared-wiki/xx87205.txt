serializer.net was an online artist collective featuring many free and subscription-based alternative webcomics.  It was launched in October 2002 by Publisher Joey Manley, Editor Tom Hart, and approximately 20 professional cartoonists. After being offline due to a server crash in April, 2005, Serializer relaunched in October, 2006 under the editorship of Eric Millikin. 
Serializer's contributing artists included many well-known award-winning alternative comics artists like  James Kochalka, Sam Henderson, Howard Cruse, Chris Onstad and Eric Millikin.
Serializer was the first site to spin off from the subscription  webcomics site Modern Tales. 
The Sunday Times described it as the "high-art" off-shoot of Modern Tales.O'Brien, Danny (February 26, 2006). "The tooniverse explodes". Sunday Times (London), p. 27.

After a decade of publishing art comics on the web, Serializer ended in 2012, saying "Thank you to all the editors, creators, subscribers, and free readers who made serializer.net such a fantastic experiment over the years. Our time has come and gone, but we carry on ... elsewhere!"[tpl]cite web|title=Serializer.net 2002-2012|url=http://www.serializer.net/|author=|publisher=Serializer[/tpl]
