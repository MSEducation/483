Hexaamminecobalt(III) chloride is the chemical compound with the formula Co(NH3)6Cl3.  This coordination compound is considered an archetypal "Werner complex", named after the pioneer of coordination chemistry, Alfred Werner. This salt consists of Co(NH3)63+ trications with three Cl− anions.  The term "ammine" refers to ammonia in its metal complexes, and the prefix hex (Greek: six) indicates that there are six ammonias per cation. 
Originally this compound was described as a "luteo" (Latin: yellow) complex, but this name has been discarded as modern chemistry considers color less important than molecular structure. Other similar complexes also had color names, such as purpureo (Latin: purple) for a pentammine complex, and praseo (Greek: green) and violeo (Latin: violet) for two isomeric tetrammine complexes.

==Properties and structure==

Co(NH3)63+ is diamagnetic, with a low-spin octahedral Co(III) center.  The cation obeys the 18-electron rule and is considered to be a classic example of an exchange inert metal complex.  As a manifestation of its inertness, Co(NH3)6Cl3 can be recrystallized unchanged from concentrated hydrochloric acid: the NH3 is so tightly bound to the Co(III) centers that it does not dissociate to allow its protonation.  In contrast, labile metal ammine complexes, such as Ni(NH3)6Cl2, react rapidly with acids reflecting the lability of the Ni(II)-NH3 bonds.  Upon heating, hexamminecobalt(III) begins to lose some of its ammine ligands, eventually producing a stronger oxidant.
The chlorides in Co(NH3)6Cl3 can be exchanged with a variety of other anions such as nitrate, bromide, and iodide to afford the corresponding Co(NH3)6X3 derivative.  Such salts are bright yellow and display varying degrees of water solubility.

==Preparation==

Since CoCl3 is not available, Co(NH3)6Cl3 is prepared from cobalt(II) chloride.  The latter is treated with ammonia and ammonium chloride followed by oxidation.  Oxidants include hydrogen peroxide or oxygen in the presence of charcoal catalyst.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bjerrum, J.; McReynolds, J. P. | title = Hexamminecobalt(III) Salts | journal = Inorg.

The acetate salt can be prepared by aerobic oxidation of cobalt(II) acetate, ammonium acetate, and ammonia in methanol.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lindholm, R.

==Uses==

Co(NH3)63+ is a component of some structural biology methods (especially for DNA or RNA, where positive ions stabilize tertiary structure of the phosphate backbone), to help solve their structures by X-ray crystallography[tpl]cite journal | author = Ramakrishnan, B.; Sekharudu, C.; Pan, B.; Sundaralingam, M. | title = Near-atomic resolution crystal structure of an A-DNA decamer d(CCCGATCGGG): cobalt hexammine interaction with A-DNA | journal = Acta Crystallogr. | year = 2003 | volume = D59 | pages = 67–72 | PMID = 12499541[/tpl] or by nuclear magnetic resonance.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rudisser, S.;  Tinoco Jr., I. | title = Solution structure of Cobalt(III)hexammine complexed to the GAAA tetraloop, and metal-ion binding to G.A mismatches. | journal = J.
