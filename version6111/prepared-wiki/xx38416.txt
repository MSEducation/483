CATEGORIES: Conservatism in the United States, American political neologisms, Words coined in the 2000s

Christianism had various definitions over the years. It was originally defined as "the Christian religion" or "the Christian world",http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Christianism with cognates in languages like Spanish ([tpl]lang|es|cristianismo[/tpl]) or French ([tpl]lang|fr|christianisme[/tpl]) retaining this meaning. In recent years, Christianism (or Christianist) has also been used as a descriptive term of Christian political conservatives mostly in the United States, for the ideology of the Christian right, meant as a counterpoint to "Islamism".[tpl]cite journal|last=Walker|first=Ruth|date=May 20, 2005|title=Onward, Christianist soldiers?|journal=Christian Science Monitor|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|location=Boston, Massachusetts|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0520/p18s04-hfes.html|accessdate=January 31, 2010[/tpl] Writing in 2005, the New York Times language columnist William Safire attributed the term (in its modern usage) to blogger Andrew Sullivan, who wrote on June 1, 2003 :[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/magazine/15ONLANGUAGE.html|title=Isms and Phobias |last=Safire|first=William|date=May 15, 2005 |work=New York Times|accessdate=January 29, 2010[/tpl]
 I have a new term for those on the fringes of the religious right who have used the Gospels to perpetuate their own aspirations for power, control and oppression: Christianists. They are as anathema to true Christians as the Islamists are to true Islam. 
The bloggers Tristero and David Neiwert used the term shortly after.When Semantic Differences Are Not: Part Two Tristero, June 2, 2003, accessed January 31, 2010.How about Christianism? David Neiwert, June 8, 2003, accessed January 31, 2010.  Sullivan later expanded on his usage of the term in a Time magazine column.Sullivan, Andrew (May 7, 2006)."My Problem with Christianism", Time, accessed January 31, 2010. Uses of the term can be found dating back to the seventeenth century, but these are unrelated to its modern meaning.
Christianism has started to gain a foothold in the United Kingdom too, according to one commentator.Catholic Church leader rejects claim UK Christians are persecuted, Andrew Brown, the Guardian, 22 [tpl]dabbr|Feb|February[/tpl] 2012 (accessed 22 [tpl]dabbr|Feb|February[/tpl] 2012)
This word does not operate strictly withi the etymology of the suffix "-ism" which means "doctrine, theory, system of principles" (the other meanings are not applicable to religions) whereas the suffix "-ity" means just "state, quality or condition". In other Latin-based languages such as Castilian, Catalonian, Galician, French, Occitanian, Italian, etc., the suffix "-ity" (-idad, -té, -ità) means Christians as a group, their geographical distribution even their cultural identity, what in English is called Christendom.
