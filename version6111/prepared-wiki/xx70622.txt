[[Sube a mi Motora]]

CATEGORIES: Menudo songs, 1981 songs

Sube a mi Motora is the name of a Menudo song from their 1981 album Quiero Ser. It became arguably the album's most popular song, topping the charts in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Venezuela. It is considered by many Menudo fans to have been the group's best song ever. Rene Farrait was the lead singer for this song.
Sube a mi Motora (Motorcycle Dreamer in English) created some controversy in Mexico, because in Mexico, moto usually is the term used for illegal drugs. Because of that, the song's name had to be changed for the Mexican audience, who knew the song as Subete a mi Moto. The Mexican version also became known across Latin America, and was used in Menudo's 1983 movie, Una Aventura Llamada Menudo,  where Farrait's substitute, Charlie Masso, sang it.
Sube a mi Motora was usually the last song performed at Menudo concerts during the era that the song was a hit. When six members of Menudo returned to the stage in 1998 during their El Reencuentro comeback tour, Sube a mi Motora was always the last song performed by the former Menudo's and Farrait ended the shows by driving a motorcycle around.
In the mid-80s, the song was released in Portuguese (Suba na minha Moto) and it was a big hit there, but the biggest hit of the group in the country was NÃ£o Se Reprima.
