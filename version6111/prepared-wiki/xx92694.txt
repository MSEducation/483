==Death==

On April 10, 1877 at the age of 23, Prince Leleiohoku died of rheumatic fever.  Because Leleiohoku was unmarried and had no children, his brother King Kalākaua named their sister Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani Crown Princess.  It was said that Ke[tpl]okina[/tpl]elikōlani had wished that Kalākaua had chosen her instead of Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani, but making her heir would make Bernice Pauahi Bishop next in line to the throne. He is buried in the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii.
