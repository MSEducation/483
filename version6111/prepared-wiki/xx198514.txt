CATEGORIES: Dyson products, Vacuum cleaners

Dyson is a British-based company and manufacturer of bagless vacuum cleaners - that use cyclonic separation, bladeless fans and brushless electric motors - heatless hand dryers and bladeless fans/heaters.
While initially made in England, all of its products are now made in Malaysia and its brushless electric motors in Singapore.

==Technologies and other products==

Dyson has developed various technologies in their products, such as the dual cyclone used in vacuum cleaners and their Airblade hand dryers.

===Digital motor===

The Dyson digital motor is a DC electric motor operates on the switched reluctance principleThe Telegraph newspaper:Dyson unveils 'world's fastest motor' in new vacuum, 25 June 2009 used in several pieces of equipment. According to Dyson, it is smaller, lighter, cleaner and more power-efficient (due in part to tight tolerances) than conventional electric motors. These brushless motors rotate at up to 104,000 rpm.Dyson website: Dyson digital motors The motor is a two-pole brushless motor with a digital controller. Dyson says efficiency is 84%, which is less than the 96% efficiency that is achieved in some brushless designs. In order to deal with the high speed, the impeller is made of carbon-fibre reinforced polymer, the shaft is steel. The first version was named X020 and used in the Airblade hand dryer; the later DDM (Dyson digital motor) V2 is used for Dyson handheld vacuum cleaners.Electronics Weekly: Dyson vacuums 104,000rpm brushless DC technology, 29 June 2009

===Airblade hand dryer===

The Dyson Airblade is a hand dryer for commercial customers, typically made available in public hand-washing facilities. The Airblade uses Dyson's Digital Motor to produce a stream of air that flows at up to 430 mph (700 km/h) and is claimed to dry the hands in 10 to 12 seconds.Dyson Airblade hand dryer specification (US)Dyson Airblade hand dryer specification (UK) The Airblade uses a HEPA filter to remove bacteria and mould from the air. The Dyson Airblade is the world's first hygienic commercial hand dryer according to NSF International; it is accredited by the British Skin Foundation and the Royal Institute of Public Health as well.Accreditations for Airblade The Dyson Airblade is HACCP approved.

===Bladeless fan===

====Air Multiplier====

The Dyson Air Multiplier was announced on 18 October 2009 as an electric fan, intended to provide smoother airflow and, having no exposed rotating blades, operating in a safer manner than conventional bladed fans.[tpl]cite web |author=Paul Taylor |title=Dyson launches the bladeless electric fan |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5ba62a00-b755-11de-9812-00144feab49a.html |publisher=Financial Times |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2009-10-13 [/tpl] The fan works by drawing 27 litres of air per second[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1288803/Dyson-launches-new-jet-engine-bladeless-fan-British-inventor-declares-war-air-conditioning.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Dyson launches new 'jet engine' bladeless fan as British inventor declares war on air conditioning | date=2010-06-23[/tpl] in through an inlet in the base pillar and forcing it through an outlet in the upper ring. The jet of air travels over the aerofoil shape of the ring, creating local low pressure, thereby pulling air from behind it as it decelerates in a process known as inducement, a property of Bernoulli's principle. Once the air exits the ring it entrains the air in front and alongside, producing an airflow of 405 l/second. Using this process, a small brushless impeller in the fan's base can power a much larger air outlet without exposing any blades.
The design for a nearly identical bladeless fan was patented by Toshiba in 1981, but was never manufactured. The initial patent claim by Dyson was rejected by the Intellectual Property Office, ruling that it "cannot be considered novel or cannot be considered to involve an inventive step" compared to the Japanese version.[tpl]cite news |author=Harry Wallop |title=Dyson fan: was it invented 30 years ago? |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/6377644/Dyson-fan-was-it-invented-30-years-ago.html |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2010-09-10 |location=London[/tpl] A subsequent patent application from Dyson highlights improvements in air dynamics.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
The Air Multiplier fan received the Good Design Award in 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.g-mark.org/english/archive/2010/award-best15.html|title=Good Design Award 2010 Results|author=Japan Industrial Design Promotion Organization|year=2010|accessdate=2010-12-02[/tpl]

====Fan heater====

In September 2011 Dyson announced the Dyson Hot fan heater (AM04), using Air Multiplier technology. Like most fan heaters it has a thermostat to control the temperature, and can also be used as a fan (without heat).

===Contrarotator washing machine===

The discontinued Dyson CR01 Contrarotator is a washing machine with two counter-rotating drums, the first of its type. Each drum has 5,000 spin perforations to help evacuate water. The machine was marketed under the slogan "Two drums are better than one"[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] and first available in November 2000. Dyson's next washing machine, in 2004, was the CR02, with "Flowcheck" and "Allergy" models. The company later stopped making washing machines the same year, as they were unprofitable for the company.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content.dyson.co.uk/insidedyson/article.asp?aID=cr01|publisher=Dyson|title=Inside Dyson|accessdate=13 December 2012[/tpl]
As from the end of November 2012, Dyson no longer supports or services the Contrarotator washing machines, which will officially become obsolete.

==Vacuum cleaners==

===Root Cyclone technology===

The Dyson Root Cyclone technology is used in all Dyson vacuum cleaners from DC07. DC17, DC22, and DC23 use the improved Root Cyclone & Core Separator, also called Radix Cyclone, Intermediary Cyclone, or Level 3 Root Cyclone Technology.

===Model versions===

All versions are identified by a name such as "DC14". Some have submodels identified by a suffix indicating specific facilities, implemented sometimes by additional tools supplied. Suffixes with the same meaning vary from model to model.

====Special Edition Models====

Other suffixes sometimes used indicate exclusivity to certain stores, e.g. "Comet Exclusive" and "Overdrive" (Comet) or "Blitz it" (Currys).
Some are limited editions:

====="Drawing" limited editions=====

These machines feature a different range of tools to the usual "Multifloor" and "Animal" versions and also appear in different colours. The Drawing later became exclusive to John Lewis.

====="De Stijl" limited editions=====

Some of the early Dyson models (DC01, DC02, DC04) were available in a special limited edition "De Stijl" colour scheme, in homage to the Dutch design movement of the same name. All these are coloured a combination of purple, red and yellow.

====="Dyson Antarctic Solo" limited editions=====

In 1996, 100,000 recoloured DC01 and DC02 models were produced as part of a fund-raising effort for Ranulph Fiennes's solo expedition to the Antarctic. For these models, the yellow parts found on the mainstream models were replaced with light blue ones, and on the DC02 Antarctic Solo the body was also recoloured in white instead of silver.Dyson, J. (1997). Against the odds. London: Butler & Tanner Ltd.

===Discontinued models===

====G-Force====

"G-Force" was the name given to Dyson's first widely available vacuum cleaner. It was the first to use "Dual Cyclone" separation technology. Licensed to the Japanese company Apex Inc., and only available on the Japanese market, it was not sold under the Dyson name. Dyson used the money he earned from G-Force to start up the Dyson company.

====DA001 / DC01====

The first vacuum cleaner sold under the Dyson name was the DA001, launched in 1993. It was a domestic upright model that used the patented "Dual Cyclone" technology and was made in Chippenham, England. After a short period, it was renamed the DC01 and production later moved to Malmesbury, at the company's new factory/research centre.
The DA001/DC01 had a single motor which provided the suction and also drove the brushroll directly via a single rubber toothless belt with no form of "brush control" (where the user can turn off the brushroll for use on hard floors), so was mainly designed to use on carpeted floors. It stored its hose on the back of the housing as part of the handle wand, and removing the handle wand enabled this stretch hose to be used. This was the only Dyson upright not to use washable pre-motor filters; these had to be purchased and replaced every 3 months. It also had a choice of post motor filtration - standard or HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Arrest) according to the model purchased. It competed with models like the Hoover Turbopower, and was priced very high in comparison to other bagged cleaners. The suction power of the DC01 is 90 airwatts. Dyson no longer supports this model, nor produces parts for it.

====DC02====

The DC02, launched in 1995, was the first cylinder (canister) model sold by Dyson. Its shape allowed it to sit on stairs. Like the DC01, it used Dual Cyclone technology. It was not that popular during its production run and sold fewer than the DC01. It was replaced in the late 1990s by the DC05. The DC02 is no longer supported by Dyson.
The DC02 was available in several special editions:

====DC03====

The DC03, Dyson's second upright vacuum cleaner, released in 1997, was a lightweight (6.9 kg), low profile upright cleaner. It resembled a twin-cylinder version of the DC01, contained one normal cylinder and a second which contained a pair of HEPA filters. The DC03 had a smaller, more compact 700W motor, and while its suction power was lower than any of the currently available uprights at around 100 Airwatts, its heavy-duty filtration system allowed it to survive for many years after the rest of the original Cyclone cleaners were discontinued. It was the first upright model to feature brush control, via a clutch between the motor and the brushroll, and was able to be stored hung on a wall. It was also the first Dyson to have the Reversible Hose, like on the DC07 and DC24 Ball

====DC04====

The DC04, released around 1998, had improved filters fitted as standard. The Pre motor filter was washable and was relocated to the top of the cyclone assembly, and the tools stored on the top of the filter housing. Most models also featured the new clutch controlled brushbar introduced on the DC03.

====DC05====

The DC05 was the second cylinder model. It was designed as a replacement for the DC02. The 'Motorhead' version was the first Dyson to offer a powernozzle: a floor nozzle with a motor-powered brush-roll for improved performance on carpets.

====DC06====

Dyson's first robotic vacuum cleaner, equipped with the Dyson Digital Motor, had not proceeded beyond the home-trial stage by 2012, as cost and weight needed reducing. It had the ability to 'learn' the room, and to distinguish between solid objects, such as walls and furniture, and human beings, pets, etc. by utilising sensors and specially-written navigation software.

====DC07====

The DC07, released in 2001 was the first implementation of Root Cyclone technology into a vacuum cleaner. It was the first model to be sold in the USA. In features it was similar to the DC04, but included a bottom drop bin, controlled by a trigger in the top of the cyclone housing, which made for easier emptying, and the handle wand was also able to be reversed and fitted to the hose cuff at the handle, so making it easier to use than that on the DC04. Many models were fitted with clutch controlled brushbars.
The DC07 had a new 1400W motor that provided 280 Airwatts, making it about the most powerful model that Dyson made, and also the noisiest in use, with much of the operating noise coming from the upwards mounted cyclone assembly.
In September and October 2006, Target sold pink Dyson vacuum cleaners to help support breast cancer research.
The DC07 had a long production run from 2001 - 2008, and came in many different colour combinations.

====DC08====

The DC08 was a new cylinder revision, released around 2002, incorporating the Dyson Root Cyclone technology found on the DC07. The DC08 was the replacement for the DC05. It was the first of the Dyson cylinder models to feature the new "Animal" derivative first seen on the DC07, which essentially meant that the cleaner was capable of dealing effectively with pet hair and dander. Animal models came with an air driven turbine floorhead and mini turbo brush for effective pet hair removal on carpets and furnishings - they also came equipped with Hepa post motor filters.
None of the DC08 models had electric motorised floorheads. Like the DC07, the DC08 was fitted with an uprated motor giving it more suction power, handled by the new root 12 cyclone system the DC08 was equipped with. This higher power output was able to drive the main turbo floorhead without the need for an electric motor and the expensive wiring that the DC05 motorhead had.
Lower models in the DC08 range did not come with the turbine floorhead, having only the standard floorheads which were better suited to hard flooring than carpets. Unlike the DC02, the DC08 did not have storage for its small tools in the body of the cleaner. As with the DC05, tools were stored on a small caddy attached to the suction hose.
The DC08 had a long production run; it was upgraded to the DC08 Telescope wrap after the launch of the DC11, to enable it to be stored more efficiently, and was eventually superseded by the DC19.

====DC08T====

Next product after the DC11 with 'Telescope Wrap'. Wand handle is telescopic and the hose wraps around the machine.

====DC09, DC10, DC13 omitted====

There are no Dyson models DC09 or DC10, as these numbers are associated with the DC-9 and DC-10 aircraft produced by McDonnell Douglas. DC13 omitted due to superstition surrounding the number 13.

====DC11====

The DC11 was the first Dyson cylinder cleaner with Telescope wrap. It had two separate dust bins and cyclone assemblies to make the machine smaller when it was packed away. It was only available in two variants, one coloured yellow and the other was a turquoise/aqua model. The DC11 was quickly superseded by the DC08T Telescope wrap, and not produced for very long.

====DC14====

The DC14 was released in 2004. It is a revision of the DC07 upright vacuum cleaner with lower centre of gravity and 'telescope reach'. It uses Dyson's Root 8 Cyclone technology, which maintains constant suction. Aside from the different design of the cyclone assembly and bin, the DC14 looks very similar to the DC07. It also has the same motor as fitted to the DC07 and the same floorhead (with the exception that the DC14 has a large debris channel fitted to the front of the brushroll housing). Due to the different downwards pointing cyclone design, the DC14 was slightly quieter in operation than the DC07 was, but still had the familiar motor noise as it used the same 1400 watt motor. Like the DC07, the DC14 comes in many variants, the standard DC14 (the Origin, non clutched), the All Floors (Clutched), the Allergy (Clutched), the Animal (Clutched, + mini turbine tool) and other special editions and colourways. [tpl]As of|2012|1[/tpl] listed as "End of Line" on Dyson Web site.

====DC15====

The DC15, known as The Ball was released in 2005 in three variants, the DC15 All Floors, Allergy and Animal. It was the first of the many "Ball" vacuums, and is based on the DC14. It has a ball instead of wheels which, in conjunction with a universal joint on the cleaner head, makes it possible to steer the machine by twisting the handle to the right or left. The inspiration of the "Ball" system originated from the Ballbarrow, James Dyson's first invention.
The DC15 is a complex machine compared to earlier upright models, and is the first Dyson upright with an independent motorised brushroll, controlled by a switch next to the main power switch. The main suction motor is housed inside the "ball".
Due to its high launch price, its weight ([tpl]Convert|8.6|kg|lb[/tpl]), and the fact that it may have initially been seen as a gimmick, not that many DC15s were sold, with the cheaper DC14 remaining much more popular. The lightweight DC18 was launched late the following year, addressing the DC15's biggest criticism - its heavy weight.

====DC18====

The [tpl]Convert|6.6|kg|lb[/tpl] Dyson DC18 Slim, launched in September 2006 and produced until summer 2008, is a slimmer and lighter-weight successor of the DC15 Ball upright. The DC18's Root Cyclone system has been trimmed down to better accommodate the machine's slimmer profile; the DC15 uses 8 cyclones, the DC18, 6.
The ball design has been simplified for the DC18: rather than riding on a large ball that encloses the primary motor, the DC18 rides on a thin, cigar-shaped roller that provides more space for separate motor enclosure and airway paths.Official DC18 Page

====DC24====

A small version of the DC25. Also uses ball technology with separate brushroll motor. It weighs 5.4 kilogrammes (11.9 pounds) and has 115 airwatts of suction power.[ref]Official DC24 Page
The Dyson DC24 office information page
[/ref] It is small and compact, and the handle compacts further for easy storage. Looks like a child's toy, but appeals to people who prefer a lightweight cleaner.
Like the DC25, this model has proved to be a big seller, due to its extremely compact size, but did have quality issues with the brushroll motors, some of which have failed prematurely. Was superseded by the DC50 in November 2012

====DC25====

The DC25 is a full size Ball upright, the replacement for the DC15 and DC18. A no-loss-of-suction vacuum features a lifetime washable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. The DC25 and the other upright vacuums from Dyson are the only vacuum on the market that has been certified asthma and allergy friendly by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.http://www.asthmaandallergyfriendly.com/find-certified-products.html?page=shop.browse&category_id=23 It is available as All Floors (yellow), Animal (purple), Overdrive (blue), Blitz It (red), Exclusive (silver), and Blueprint (white and blue). This vacuum is very similar to the DC15 but on a smaller size, addressing issues brought up with the DC15. Proved to be a very popular ball cleaner, more so than the DC15 and the DC18 (which was not a true ball model). Superseded in mid-2012 by the DC40 and DC41 Animal

===Models current as of November 2012===

====DC12====

Small cylinder machine released in Japan.

====DC12plus====

Small cylinders in Japan. Top-of-the-range models are fitted with the Dyson Digital Motor, which rotates at 100,000rpm.

====DC16 - Dyson Handheld====

The DC16 is Dyson's first handheld vacuum cleaner based on the same technology as used in the DC14 and DC15 root cyclone upright vacuum cleaners. The DC16 has 36 airwatts of constant suction. The DC16 shares the same styling as the other recent upright and cylinder vacuum cleaners in the Dyson range, and weighs 1.5 kg (3.3 lb).
Also available in an Issey Miyake limited edition in which the manifold on the cyclone assembly is pink instead of the standard yellow, and an Animal version with a motorised brushbar for picking up pet hair and gold cyclone manifold. Newest to the range is the DC16 Car and Boat which is designed for car and boat cleaning, supplied with a car 12 V charger and has a blue cyclone manifold.

====DC17====

The Dyson DC17 is an upright cleaner launched in October 2006 in the US. Although visually similar to the DC14, it contains new technologies. The first upgrade is the use of Dyson's Level 3 Root Cyclone. This system incorporates 11 cyclones to more efficiently filter sand and dust particles out of the airstream. In this system, the airflow travels from the low speed outer cyclone to two intermediate cyclones that filter out the bulk of dust and sand particles that are drawn into the system. Beyond that, the airflow flows through the remaining eight high speed cyclones which filters any remaining dust particles out of the airstream. The Level 3 Root Cyclone improves upon the original Root Cyclone system with its capability to more efficiently separate sand particles from the air flow, a problem with the earlier system.
The second change with the DC17 upright is the brushroll design. While the brushrolls used on the DC07, DC14 and DC15 were designed with European carpets in mind, the DC17's brush roll was designed for North America with a cylindrical shape, a large diameter, and short stiff bristles. A separate motor drives the brushroll, unlike the DC07 and DC14, which use power from the main motor via clutches. This made the DC17 the most effective of Dyson cleaners on carpeting.
The third change is a new colour scheme for the DC17, and also the Dyson DC16 Root 6 Handheld; the bright colours and silver tones are toned down in favour of shiny metallic accents and titanium as the main colour for the entire machine.Official DC17 Page.
The level 3 root cyclone system on the DC17 was quietly redesigned due to a gasket defect that allowed dirt to enter the cylones backward, clogging them and causing the cleaner to lose suction; almost all of the original DC17s had this problem. The redesigned cyclone pack, fitted to later DC17s, resolved this issue. Older DC17s were not recalled, but Dyson gave out and sold many of the redesigned cyclone packs.

====DC19====

Cylinder model, without the Telescopic Wrap system.
It was the replacement of the DC08, and to all intents and purposes is virtually the same in appearance and design as the DC08.

====DC19 T2====

Same as DC19, but improved so that the brushbar can pick up on carpets and on hard floors. This model also used a plastic telescopic rod instead of the metal one found on the original DC19.
Still a current model as of November 2012.

====DC20====

'Stowaway', as DC19 but with telescope wrap. Dyson have updated the DC08T (part of the DC08) series to form the DC20. Called the Dyson Stowaway in the UK. The colour scheme is new, and the cleaner is available in Standard, Allergy and Animal.

====DC21====

The model is known as the Stowaway in the United States, but as the Motorhead in the United Kingdom and other countries. It is the second cylinder vacuum from Dyson to have a motorised brushbar on the head of the nozzle. It is an advance on the DC08 Telescopic Wrap system, discontinued in some countries including the United Kingdom.

====DC22====

Known as "Dyson Baby" or "Dyson Compact" or "Dyson Allergy" and two-thirds the size of the DC23. Using the Dyson Digital Motor and Core Separation which adds a third cyclone 'layer' to filter out smaller particles. Has turbine head and motor head versions.

====DC23====

DC23 is similar in design to the DC21 but uses the new Core Separation that is also in the DC22. There is also a turbinehead animal version in Canada.

====DC23 T2====

A DC23 with different accessories and tools.

====DC26====

Ultra compact cylinder model, the DC26, known as the Dyson "City" is the World's smallest vacuum with constant suction. Even smaller than the DC22. The machine is so small that it will fit onto a piece of A4 paper. With a very small dust container of 0.68 litres, and cord length of 5 metres, it was designed for small flats with primarily hard floors. It weighs just 5.6 kg and has an impressive 160 AirWatts suction power.

====DC27====

The DC27 is an update on the DC14. The DC27 is a full size upright which has wheels rather than a ball, an auto-adjusting cleaner head and "root-cyclone" technology. It also features an extending wand and hose and has a large debris channel to pick up large dirt particles.http://www.dyson.co.uk/Vacuumcleaners/Uprights/DC27/DC27-All-Floors.aspx

====DC28====

This was another upright model produced for the US market. It was the replacement for the DC17. Has a powered cam to adjust the height of the brushbar ("Dyson Airmuscle") - controlled from a set of buttons by the main power switch above the cyclone assembly, a pneumatic actuator to keep the cleaning head on the floor, and a high-torque clutch to give extra power to the brushbar.

====DC29====

In Australia the DC29 is a cylinder model, an improved version of DC19. Very similar to DC19T2, the main differences being colour and tooling and non-HEPA machine. A HEPA filter is now included in 2012 'Multi-Floor' white models. In Canada, the DC29 is actually an upright model similar to the DC25. This appears to be the first instance of a particular model number being used on an Upright OR a Cylinder depending on country of destination
Supplied to Continental Europe and Australia (Cylinder type) and Canada (Upright type) (Not available in the UK)

====DC30====

Powerful handheld with a brushless----- switched reluctance motor.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/5636349/Dyson-unveils-worlds-fastest-motor-in-new-vacuum.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Harry | last=Wallop | title=Dyson unveils 'world's fastest motor' in new vacuum | date=2009-06-25[/tpl] Can provide 6 minutes of high and constant suction. It is smaller, lighter and more powerful than the DC16, which uses a conventional motor. The DC30 has a yellow cyclone manifold.

====DC31====

The most powerful handheld, with the same motor technology as the DC30, but with a larger battery and dual power for more runtime. 10 minutes of high constant suction (at the same level as the DC30) or 6 minutes with 70% higher suction. Available as DC31 with a blue (UK and AUS), yellow (US), or red (EU) cyclone manifold, or the DC31 Animal which has a purple cyclone manifold.

====DC32====

Basically the same as DC23T2 (in the UK) with a revised color scheme and additional tooling.

====DC33====

Revised version of the DC27/DC28. Replacement for the DC14, upright wheeled cleaner that does not use ball technology. Available as Multi Floor (Yellow), Stubborn (White), Animal (Purple), i (Red).
The DC33 has a plastic telescopic pole with smaller diameter than the metal telescopic pole of the DC14, so attachments from older Dyson's such as the DC14 do not fit the DC33. This model does not seem to be much of an advance on previous wheeled uprights, and more closely resembles the old DC14 than the DC27 did, using exactly the same style of floorhead as the DC14,DC07 and DC04. The plastic wand pole has been criticised as a lowering of quality from the older metal type, and also causes the main spine of the cleaner to flex more, without the support of the metal wand. The fact that older model's tools were not interchangeable was also criticised, with many buyers trading up from the DC07 or DC14 to the DC33, and finding that their old tools would not fit.
The DC33 uses a single motor for the suction and to drive the brushroll via a mechanical clutch as on the DC04, DC07 and DC14. At this time, it seemed that Dyson were spending more of their development time with the new ranges of ball vacuum cleaners rather than the traditional all wheeled cleaners. The DC33 is still a current model as of November 2012. This unit has been discounted as of July of 2013. No replacement model has been announced.

====DC34====

Another Handheld model similar to the DC31.

====DC35====

Dyson Digital Slim. Similar design to the DC30/31/34 but with detachable extension tube, modified electronics and motorised brush head.

====DC36====

DC38 version for Japan, France, South Korea and Canada.

====DC37====

DC39 version for Continental Europe.

====DC38====

Smaller version of the DC39.

====DC39====

Dyson's new cylinder vacuum cleaner released in late 2011. It uses Dyson's Radial Root Cyclone Technology. Uses a ball and a swivel mechanism for improved manoeuvrability.

====DC40====

The Dyson DC40 upright vacuum released in early 2012. The DC40 vacuum is Dyson's counterpart to the previously released DC41 Animal. The DC40 has Multifloor and Animal editions that utilise the Dyson ball technology.

====DC41====

The Dyson DC41 upright released in late 2011 as the replacement for the DC25, is the first upright vacuum with Dyson's new Radial Root Cyclone technology as well as an automatic height adjuster which provides the maximum amount of power in the suction head. The cleaner also has Dyson's new high-powered turbo brush for the hose. The DC41 uses ball technology.

====DC42====

A version of the Dyson DC40 offered for sale in Canada.

====DC43====

A version of the Dyson DC41 offered for sale in Canada.

====DC44====

The Dyson Digital Slim DC44 is Dyson's newest handheld vacuum cleaner which uses the same motorised brush head as the DC35 as well as the Radial Root Cyclone Technology. Has an extension pole to make it similar to a cylinder cleaner's handle, pole and floorhead. Improves on the DC35 by incorporating a more powerful brush bar motor and different battery chemistry. Detailed review of the cleaner, with examples demonstrating the suction power.

====DC45====

Dyson Digital Slim for Canada and Continental Europe, essentially the same as the DC44

====DC46====

Version of the DC47 cylinder model for the Japanese market.

====DC47====

The DC47 was released at the end of 2012, and is an update on the DC38. It is a compact cylinder model based on the technologies featured on the DC38, but introducing the new 2 Tier Radial Root Cyclone Technology for greater suction and filtration, and also the new 2 channel floor tool.
It weighs 6 kg and has a suction power of 180 Airwatts.

====DC50====

The DC50 was released at the end of 2012, and is an update on the DC24. It is a very small and lightweight upright ball cleaner incorporating the technologies introduced on the DC41 (i.e. self-adjusting brushroll), plus the addition of a new brushroll motor mounted inside the brushroll to save on space. The brushroll also incorporates carbon fibre bristles found in the DC35 and DC44 models. It weighs 5.4 kg (11.9 lbs) and has a suction rating of 140 airwatts, with a dirt capacity of 0.8 litres. Also featuring the 2 tier radial cyclone system found on the DC47. In Canada it is called the DC51

====DC54====

Newest ball vacuum cleaner from Dyson.  It uses Cinetic technology which Dyson says "no loss of suction".  For the first time it is Dyson that does not require cleaning of filters.  Consists of 54 cyclones with high frequency oscillating tips that vibrate to prevent clogging.  Comes in Animal and Multi-Floor versions.

====DC58====

The newest handheld. Is powered by Dyson digital motor V6 has 15 cyclones.

====DC59====

The DC59 replaces the DC44 and is claimed to remove as much dust as a corded vacuum. This is made possible by the combination of the Dyson digital motor V6, 2 Tier Radial™ cyclones and the latest floor tool with carbon fibre filaments. This power-dense motor uses digital pulse technology and a neodymium magnet to spin at up to 110,000 times a minute.
