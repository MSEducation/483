Earl Attlee is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 16 December 1955 for Clement Attlee, the former Labour Prime Minister. At the same time he was made Viscount Prestwood, of Walthamstow in the County of Essex, which serves as the subsidiary title to the earldom and is also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. 
As of 2012, the titles are held by his grandson, the third Earl, who succeeded his father in 1991. He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. In contrast to his father and grandfather, the current Lord Attlee is a member of the Conservative Party.
