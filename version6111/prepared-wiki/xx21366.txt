San Juan ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|s|æ|n|_|ˈ|hw|ɑː|n[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-es|saŋ ˈhwan[/tpl], Saint John), officially Municipio de la Ciudad Capital San Juan Bautista (Municipality of the Capital City, Saint John the Baptist), is the capital and most populous municipality in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 395,326 making it the 46th-largest city under the jurisdiction of the United States. San Juan was founded by Spanish colonists in 1521, who called it Ciudad de Puerto Rico ("Rich Port City"). Puerto Rico's capital is the second oldest European-established capital city in the Americas, after Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic.[tpl]cite web|author=Magaly Rivera|title=San Juan Capital City|url=http://welcome.topuertorico.org/city/sanjuan.shtml|publisher=Welcome to Puerto Rico|accessdate=2007-05-02[/tpl] Several historical buildings are located in San Juan; among the most notable are the city's former defensive forts, Fort San Felipe del Morro and Fort San Cristóbal, and La Fortaleza, the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Americas.
Today, San Juan is one of Puerto Rico's most important seaports,[tpl]cite web|url=http://apprportal.prpa.gobierno.pr/servlet/page?_pageid=70&_dad=portal30&_schema=PORTAL30&_type=site&_fsiteid=54&_fid=3640&_fnavbarid=1&_fnavbarsiteid=54&_fedit=0&_fmode=2&_fdisplaymode=1&_fcalledfrom=1&_fdisplayurl= |publisher=Puerto Rico Port Authority |title=the San Juan Port |language=Spanish |year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-09[/tpl] and is the island's manufacturing[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl], financial, cultural, and tourism center. The population of the Metropolitan Statistical Area, including San Juan and the municipalities of Bayamón, Guaynabo, Cataño, Canóvanas, Caguas, Toa Alta, Toa Baja, Carolina and Trujillo Alto, is about 2 million inhabitants; thus, about half the population of Puerto Rico now lives and works in this area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gotopuertorico.com/tourism-puerto-rico.php|title=About Puerto Rico|publisher=Puerto Rico Tourism Company|year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-08[/tpl] San Juan is also a principal city of the San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo Combined Statistical Area. The city has been the host of numerous important events within the sports community, including the 1979 Pan American Games, 1966 Central American and Caribbean Games, events of the 2006, 2009 and 2013 World Baseball Classics, the Caribbean Series and the Special Olympics and MLB San Juan Series in 2010.

==History==

In 1508, Juan Ponce de León founded the original settlement Caparra (named after the province Caceres, Spain, the birthplace of then-governor of Spain's Caribbean territories Nicolás de Ovando),"Guaynabo -- Encyclopædia Britannica" (with history of Puerto Rico),Encyclopædia Britannica, 2006, Britannica.com webpage:EB-Guaynabo-Puerto-Rico:names: Caparra, the first Spanish settlement of Puerto Rico (1508). which today is known as the Pueblo Viejo sector of Guaynabo, just to the west of the present San Juan metropolitan area. A year later, the settlement was moved to a site then called Puerto Rico, Spanish for "rich port" or "good port", after its similar geographical features to the island of Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands.[tpl]cite web|publisher=National Park Service|title=Historic places in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nR/travel/prvi/pr27.htm|accessdate=2007-05-02[/tpl]  In 1521, the newer settlement was given its formal name, San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico, in honor of John the Baptist, following the tradition of christening the town with both its formal name and the name which Christopher Columbus had originally given the island.
The ambiguous use of San Juan Bautista and Puerto Rico for both the city and the island led to a reversal in practical use by most inhabitants: by 1746, the name for the city (Puerto Rico) had become that of the entire island, while the name for the Island (San Juan Bautista) had become the name for the city.[tpl]cite web|title=Historia de San Juan de Puerto Rico |language=Spanish|publisher=Vive San Juan|year=2006|url=http://www.vivesanjuan.com/historia.htm|accessdate=2007-05-02[/tpl]Puerto Rico.

San Juan, as a settlement of the Spanish Empire, was used by merchant and military ships traveling from Spain as the first stopover in the Americas. Because of its prominence in the Caribbean, a network of fortifications was built to protect the transports of gold and silver from the New World to Europe. Because of the rich cargoes, San Juan became a target of the foreign powers of the time.[tpl]cite web|title=San Juan National Historic Site|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/saju/faq.html#3|publisher=National Park Service|year=2000|accessdate=2007-05-29[/tpl]
The city was witness to attacks from the English led by Sir Francis Drake in 1595 (in what is known as the Battle of Puerto Rico) and by George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, in 1598.  Artillery from San Juan's fort, El Morro, repelled Drake; however, Clifford managed to land troops and lay siege to the city.[tpl]cite web|title=History of Puerto Rico|publisher=Sol Boricua|year=2000|url=http://www.solboricua.com/history.htm|author=William Figueroa|language=Spanish |accessdate=2007-05-02[/tpl] After a few months of English occupation, Clifford was forced to abandon the siege when his troops began to suffer from exhaustion and sickness.  In 1625 the city was sacked by Dutch forces led by Captain Balduino Enrico (also known as Boudewijn Hendricksz/Bowdoin Henrick), but El Morro withstood the assault and was not taken. The Dutch were counterattacked by Captain Juan de Amezquita and 50 members of the civilian militia on land and by the cannons of the Spanish troops in El Morro Castle. The land battle left 60 Dutch soldiers dead and Enrico with a sword wound to his neck which he received from the hands of Amezquita."DON JUAN DE HARO Y LOS HOLANDESES" (24 de Septiembre de 1625)][tpl]broken link|date=January 2014[/tpl][tpl]unreliable source|date=January 2014[/tpl] The Dutch ships at sea were boarded by Puerto Ricans who defeated those aboard. After a long battle, the Spanish soldiers and volunteers of the city's militia were able to defend the city from the attack and save the island from an invasion. On October 21, Enrico set La Fortaleza and the city ablaze. Captains Amezquita and Andre Botello decided to put a stop to the destruction and led 200 men in an attack against the enemy's front and rear guard. They drove Enrico and his men from their trenches and into the ocean in their haste to reach their ships.The History of Puerto Rico From the Spanish Discovery to the American Occupation / Middeldyk, R.A.

The British attack in 1797, during the French Revolutionary Wars, led by Sir Ralph Abercromby (who had just conquered Trinidad).  His army laid siege to the city but was forced to withdraw in defeat as the Puerto Rican defenses proved more resilient than those of Trinidad. Various events and circumstances, including liberalized commerce with Spain, the opening of the island to immigrants as a direct result of the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815, and the colonial revolutions, led to an expansion of San Juan and other Puerto Rican settlements in the late 18th and early 19th century.
On May 8, 1898, United States Navy ships, among them the [tpl]USS|Detroit|C-10|6[/tpl], [tpl]USS|Indiana|BB-1|6[/tpl], [tpl]USS|New York|ACR-2|6[/tpl], [tpl]USS|Amphitrite|BM-2|6[/tpl], [tpl]USS|Terror|BM-4|6[/tpl] and [tpl]USS|Montgomery|C-9|6[/tpl], commanded by Rear Admiral William T.

On May 9, Yale fought a brief battle with an auxiliary cruiser of Spain, name unknown, resulting in a Spanish victory. Around this time, Captain Ángel Rivero Méndez was assigned the command of the Spanish forces in the fortress of San Cristóbal in San Juan. On May 10, the Yale returned to San Juan Bay, Rivero-Méndez ordered his men to open fire upon the [tpl]USS|Yale|1889|6[/tpl] using an Ordoñez 15 centimeter cannon, thus becoming the first attack against the Americans in Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War. For his actions, Captain Rivero-Mendez was awarded the "Cruz de la Orden de Merito Militar" (The Cross of the Order of the Military Merit) first class. The residents of San Juan were furious with Rivero and blamed him for the destruction caused to their city by the American bombardments. Nothing came of those accusations and Capt. Rivero-Méndez was ordered to turn over the keys of all the military installations in San Juan to Captain Henry A. Reed of the U.S. Army after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 was signed. On July 25, General Nelson A. Miles landed at Guánica (in southwestern Puerto Rico) with 3,300 soldiers in what was known as the Puerto Rico Campaign. The American troops found some resistance and engaged the Spanish and Puerto Rican troops in battle, the most notable of these the Battles of Yauco and Asomante. All military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended August 13, 1898, after President William McKinley and French Ambassador Jules Cambon, acting on behalf of the Spanish government, signed an armistice.[tpl]cite book |author=Karl Stephen Herrman |title=From Yauco to Las Marias a Recent Campaign in Puerto Rico |year=2004 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |page=2|isbn=1-4191-2123-5[/tpl]  Spain ceded the island to the United States later the same year by signing the Treaty of Paris.
Camp Las Casas, located in the district of Santurce, served as the main training camp for the Puerto Rican soldiers prior to World War I and World War II; the majority of the men trained in this facility were assigned to the "Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry" which was renamed the 65th Infantry Regiment of the United States Army by the Reorganization Act of June 4, 1920. The 65th Infantry was deactivated in 1956 and became the only unit ever to be transferred from an active Army component to the Puerto Rico National Guard.Puerto Rico's 65th Infantry

In 1919, Félix Rigau Carrera, "El Aguila de Sabana Grande" (The Eagle from Sabana Grande), the first Hispanic fighter pilot in the United States Marine Corps and first Puerto Rican pilot, became the first native Puerto Rican to fly an aircraft in the island when he flew his Curtiss JN-4 from Las Casas. At the time, the area was used by the military as an air base and it was also Puerto Rico's first commercial airport, and Rigau Carrera was allowed to perform his historic flight from the air field."El Mundo"; "Fallece El Aguila - Fue Primer Boricua Manejo Avion en la Isla" (Spanish); by: Malen Rojas Daporte; October 20, 1954; Number 13,448 Camp Las Casas was eventually closed down, and in 1950 a public housing project by the name of Residencial Fray Bartolome de Las Casas was constructed on its former location.
On January 2, 1947, the people of San Juan elected Felisa Rincón de Gautier (also known as Doña Fela) (1897–1994) as their mayor. Thus, she became the first woman to be elected as the Mayor of a capital city in any of The Americas.El Nuevo Dia During the Cold War era, she ordered the establishment of the island's first Civil Defense system under the directorship of Colonel Gilberto Jose Marxuach (Teofilo's son)."heroe del 65 Satisfecho de Haber Cumplido su Deber"; El Mundo; May 2, 1952 Rincón de Gautier served as mayor until January 2, 1969.
On October 30, 1950, San Juan was the scene of the San Juan Uprising, one of many uprisings which occurred in various towns and cities in Puerto Rico, by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party against the governments of Puerto Rico and the United States. Among the uprising's main objective was to attack "La Fortaleza" (the Governors mansion) and the United States Federal Court House Building in Old San Juan. In accordance to the planned uprising in San Juan, a group of nationalists were supposed to attack simultaneously the gubernatorial mansion La Fortaleza, where Puerto Rican governor Luis Muñoz Marín resided, and the United States Federal Court House which is located close to an area called "La Marina" in Old San Juan. The La Fortaleza battle, which ensued between the nationalists and the police lasted 15 minutes, and ended when four of the five attackers were killed."El ataque Nacionalista a La Fortaleza"; by Pedro Aponte Vázquez; Page 2; Publisher: Publicaciones RENÉ; ISBN 978-1-931702-01-0

===Coat of arms and flag of San Juan===

On March 8, 1948 the city government of San Juan officially adopted as the city's first flag an orange field, in the center of which is the Coat of Arms of the City. The orange color was based and taken from Father Diego de Torres Vargas' text and it reads : "Escudo de armas dado a Puerto Rico por los Reyes Católicos en el año de 1511, siendo Procurador un vecino llamado Pedro Moreno. Son : un cordero blanco con su banderilla colorada, sobre un libro, y todo sobre una isla verde, que es la de Puerto Rico, y por los lados una F y una I, que quiere decir Fernando e Isabel, los Reyes Católicos que se las dieron, y hoy se conservan en el estandarte real, que es de damasco anaranjado, con que se ganó la ciudad" ("Coat of Arms given to Puerto Rico by the Catholic Monarchs in the year 1511 being Procurator a vecino named Pedro Moreno. They are: a white lamb with a red flag, on top of a book, and everything above a green island, which is Puerto Rico...which is of orange damask, with which the city was won"). It appears that the color was changed from orange to white at some point.A discussion of the flag

==Geography==

San Juan is located along the north-eastern coast of Puerto Rico. It lies south of the Atlantic Ocean; north of Caguas and Trujillo Alto; east of  and Guaynabo; and west of Carolina. The city occupies an area of [tpl]convert|76.93|sqmi|km2[/tpl], of which, [tpl]convert|29.11|sqmi|km2[/tpl] (37.83%) is water. San Juan's main water bodies are San Juan Bay and two natural lagoons, the Condado and San José.

===Climate===

San Juan has a tropical monsoon climate and enjoys an average temperature of [tpl]convert|79.9|F|1[/tpl] although [tpl]convert|90|°F|0[/tpl] or higher temperatures are often felt during the wetter months of the northern summer, especially if the winds come from the south. In the winter, temperatures can drop to around [tpl]convert|60|°F[/tpl], though the average winter low is [tpl]convert|71|°F|0[/tpl]. The coolest temperature ever recorded was [tpl]convert|60|°F|0[/tpl] on March 3, 1957, and the hottest was [tpl]convert|98|°F|0[/tpl] on October 9, 1981. Rainfall is well-distributed throughout the year, but the months of January, February, and March are the driest; as February averages just under [tpl]convert|1.95|in|1[/tpl] of rain, the city falls under the tropical monsoon category.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.climate-zone.com/climate/puerto-rico/fahrenheit/san-juan-intl-arpt.htm|title=Climate information for San Juan Intl. Airport[/tpl] Rainfall averages [tpl]convert|56.35|in|mm|1[/tpl], falling on an average 198.5 days per year; despite this dampness, the city averages nearly 3,000 hours of sunshine per year, or just over 2/3 of the possible total.

==Cityscape==

===Architecture===

The architecture of San Juan is very diverse, due to its size and all the cultural influences received during its existence. The oldest part of the city, known as Old San Juan, mostly features the influence of Spanish architecture. This part of the city is comprised by a network of setted roads usually surrounded by ancient, two-storied houses built on masonry. Some colonial structures have been restored and serve either as government offices or museums. Some examples are the Ballajá Barracks, which now serve as museum and headquarter of several cultural organizations; La Fortaleza, which has served as the residence of the Governor of Puerto Rico since the 16th Century; and the Ancient Welfare Asylum, which now houses the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, among others. Old San Juan also features several public squares, like the Plaza de Armas, located in front of San Juan City Hall; and cathedrals, like the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.enciclopediapr.org/pr_new/viejo_sanjuan.php|title=Viejo San Juan|work=Enciclopedia Puerto Rico|author=Grupo Editorial EPRL|accessdate=November 4, 2012[/tpl] Old San Juan is also notable for being partly enclosed by massive walls and fortifications built by the Spanish government.
The architecture is more varied in other districts of the city. The district of Santurce features a lot of influence from art deco, while the districts of Hato Rey feature more modern structures.

===Districts===

What is now known as Old San Juan occupied the western end of a rocky islet, the Isleta de San Juan, at the mouth of San Juan Bay. During the 20th century, the main population centers surged well beyond the walls of the old city and onto Puerto Rico's main island, and merged with the existing settlements east and south of Old San Juan. With the annexation of Río Piedras in 1951, the municipality of San Juan grew four times its previous size. As a result, the city is now composed of a variety of districts and neighborhoods. San Juan is now subdivided into 18 districts,[tpl]cite web|url=http://welcome.topuertorico.org/maps/sanjuan.pdf |title=San Juan map: Municipo de San Juan |publisher=Welcome.topuertorico.org |accessdate=2012-11-25[/tpl] 16 of which fall within the former municipality of Río Piedras. Eight districts are further subdivided into sectors, including two districts in the area that covered the original municipality of San Juan. The 18 districts are:

====Old San Juan====

During the Spanish colonial times most of the urban population resided in what is now known as Old San Juan. This sector is located on the western half of a small island called the Isleta de San Juan, which is connected to the mainland by two bridges and a causeway. The small island, which comprises an area of [tpl]convert|47|sqmi[/tpl], also hosts the working-class neighborhood of Puerta de Tierra and most of Puerto Rico's central government buildings, including the Commonwealth's Capitol.
The main central part of the city is characterized by narrow streets made of blue cobblestone and picturesque colonial buildings, some of which date back to the 16th and 17th century. Sections of the old city are surrounded by massive walls and several defensive structures and notable forts.  These include the 16th-century Fort San Felipe del Morro and the 17th-century Fort San Cristóbal, both part of San Juan National Historic Site, and the 16th-century El Palacio de Santa Catalina, also known as La Fortaleza, which serves as the governor's mansion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/60sjspanish/60sanjuan.htm|title=Los Castillos del Viejo San Juan|language=Spanish |publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2007-05-06[/tpl] Other buildings of interest predating the 20th century are the Ayuntamiento or Alcaldía (City Hall), the Diputación Provincial and the Real Intendencia buildings, which currently house the Puerto Rico Department of State,[tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl] the Casa Rosa, the San José Church (1523) and the adjacent Hotel El Convento, the former house of the Ponce de León family known as Casa Blanca, the Teatro Tapia, the former Spanish barracks (now Museum of Ballajá), La Princesa (former municipal jail, now headquartering the Puerto Rico Tourism Company), and the municipal cemetery of Santa María Magdalena de Pazzi, located just outside the city walls.[tpl]cite web|url=http://home.coqui.net/sarrasin/ballaja.htm|title=History of El Cuartel de Ballajá |language=Spanish |publisher=Coquí.Net |accessdate=2007-05-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~prsanjua/pazzi.htm|title=Viejo Cementerio de San Juan (graveyard's history)|author=E.

====Other districts====

East of Old San Juan lies the wealthy tourist-oriented neighborhood of Condado, which occupies land that used to be owned by entrepreneur Pablo Ubarri Capetillo, a Spanish railroad developer and Count of San José de Santurce under the Spanish colonial period. Beaches such as nearby Ocean Park, popular with swimmers, surfers and kitesurfers, are found all along the district's Atlantic coastline which is also the locus of numerous hotels.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.puertoricocheaphotels.com|title=Puerto Rico Cheap Hotels: Condado, Old San Juan, Isla Verde and Ocean Park budget hotels|publisher=Hola San Juan|year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-06[/tpl]
Near Condado are two separate business districts, Santurce and Miramar. Miramar is mainly a residential area rising south of the Condado Lagoon. It comprises the former barrio of Miraflores, as well as drained marshland and landfill over which was built San Juan's first airport, the Isla Grande airport, which was renamed Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport in honor of Major Fernando Luis Ribas-Dominicci (USAF).
Miramar now hosts the Puerto Rico Convention Center as well as some of San Juan Harbor's cruise ship piers. In 2005 Miramar was designated an historical district of Puerto Rico.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.miramarpr.com/ |title=Informese: Miramar designated a historical district|publisher=MiramarPR|year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-06[/tpl]
Santurce, originally named San Mateo de Cangrejos (Saint Matthew of the Crabs), was a settlement for freed African slaves during the early days of the city. After Pablo Ubarri sought permission to link San Juan with Río Piedras proper via steam tramway in 1878, the time it took to travel between both points were shortened and thereby stimulated the colonization and growth of the district. At the beginning of the twentieth century an electric trolley was installed, the township was split into three parts, and its main settlement, merged with the city, was renamed using the Spanish spelling of Santurtzi (Saint George in Basque), Ubarri's birthplace in Vizcaya, Spain. The "Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico" (Puerto Rico Museum of Art)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mapr.org/|title=Official site of the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico|language=Spanish|publisher=Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico|year=2006|accessdate=2007-05-06[/tpl] and other important cultural venues are located in Santurce.
South of Santurce is Hato Rey, part of the former municipality of Río Piedras. Hato Rey was grazing ground for cattle owned by the royal government (hence its name, the King's Herd in Spanish) as early as the 16th century, and is now considered the financial center of the island. A section of this district is often referred to as Milla de Oro (actually [tpl]convert|0.47|mi|km|2|disp=or[/tpl] long) due in part to the many banks and businesses located there.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2004/vol8n47/PRSST0847-en.shtml|title=Eatin’ Where The Cows Used To Roam: Hato Rey Dining At Its Best|author=Brenda A. Mari|publisher=The Puerto Rico Herald|date=November 19, 2004|accessdate=2007-05-06[/tpl]
In the southern part of the city is the socially diversified community of Río Piedras. Founded in the mid-1850s, Río Piedras was a separate town which hosted sugar cane plantations and the estates of some of San Juan's wealthiest inhabitants (as well as their working class staff). The Spanish colonial governors also had their summer home there on land which eventually gave way to the main campus of the University of Puerto Rico. In 1951 the municipalities of San Juan and Río Piedras were merged to redefine San Juan's current city limits.  Today Río Piedras comprises the largest area of the municipality of San Juan.[tpl]cite web|title=Official site of the University of Puerto Rico|url=http://www.uprrp.edu/|language=Spanish|publisher=Universidad de Puerto Rico|year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-06[/tpl] and is home to the renowned, traditional "Plaza del Mercado" (Río Piedras Marketplace), the main campus and the Medical Sciences campus of the University of Puerto Rico and the San Juan Botanical Garden.

==Demographics==

San Juan is the largest city in Puerto Rico by population.[tpl]cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFPopulation?_event=ChangeGeoContext&geo_id=05000US72127&_geoContext=&_street=&_county=San+Juan&_cityTown=San+Juan&_state=04000US72&_zip=&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv=&_useEV=&pctxt=fph&pgsl=010&_submenuId=population_0&ds_name=null&_ci_nbr=null&qr_name=null&reg=null%3Anull&_keyword=&_industry=|title=San Juan and its barrios|publisher=United States Census Bureau |year=2008|accessdate=2009-10-26[/tpl] From 1899 to 1950 the municipality of San Juan excluded the township of Río Piedras. For this reason, population data and land area for the period make reference only to the Antiguo San Juan and Santurce barrios, or subdivisions, of San Juan. The old municipality of Río Piedras constituted the third most populated city of Puerto Rico at the time of its annexation in 1951. Its strategic location south of the capital served as a junction for all the principal ways of transportation of the island and as a geographical entry to San Juan,  which are factors that prompted Río Piedras's dramatic urban development in the 20th century.
According to the 2010 Census, the racial composition of San Juan was as follows:
Among the Hispanic and Latino population, Puerto Ricans are, unsurprisingly, the largest group; they make up 87.5% of San Juan's Hispanic population. People of Dominican descent made up 12.2% of the Hispanic population, while those of Cuban descent formed 1.7% of the Hispanic populace. Other Hispanic and Latino groups collectively formed 3.2% of San Juan's Hispanic population.
There are 13,304 whites of non-Hispanic origin living in San Juan; 10,571 blacks of non-Hispanic origin living in San Juan. Non-Hispanic whites and blacks form 3.2% and 2.6% of San Juan's population respectively. There are also approximately 562 Asians of non-Hispanic origin in San Juan; they make up only 0.1% of the population. However, Asians of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin together number at 6,342.

The airport accommodates more than 30 domestic and international airlines and is the busiest airport in the Caribbean.

The area's secondary airport is the Fernando Ribas Dominicci Airport, which is located directly across the San Antonio Creek or Cano San Antonio from Old San Juan in the Isla Grande district.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prpa.gobierno.pr/APMain.aspx|title=Autoridad de puertos de Puerto Rico official website |language=Spanish|publisher=Autoridad de Puertos de Puerto Rico|accessdate=2007-05-08[/tpl] Dominicci Airport is used mainly by general aviation aircraft, charter flights, and some domestic commercial flights.

It is now also widely used by the Isla Grande Flight School and Caribbean Flight Center, the only flight school on the island.

===Public transport===

At 4,300 vehicles per paved mile, San Juan has by far the highest density of vehicles on the road of any country in the world.Highest auto density in the world The city is served by five limited-access expressways and highways and numerous arterial avenues and boulevards, but continues to suffer from severe traffic congestion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dollarman.com/puertorico/sanjuan.html|title=About Puerto Rico...San Juan |publisher=Dollarman.com|accessdate=2007-05-11[/tpl]
The Metropolitan Bus Authority (Autoridad Metropolitana de Autobuses or AMA in Spanish) provides daily bus transportation to residents of San Juan, Guaynabo, Bayamón, Toa Baja, Trujillo Alto, Cataño and Carolina through 30 fixed routes. Its fleet consists of 277 regular buses and 35 handicap-accessible buses. AMA's ridership is estimated at 112,000 on weekdays.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dtop.gobierno.pr/AMA/Amades_e.htm|title=AMA: Descripción|publisher=Departamento de Transportación Publica|language=Spanish|year=2006|accessdate=2007-06-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070502004203/http://www.dtop.gobierno.pr/AMA/Amades_e.htm  |archivedate = May 2, 2007[/tpl]  There is also a daily ferry service, known as the Cataño Ferry (La Lancha de Cataño), which operates between Old San Juan and the town of Cataño.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.presupuesto.gobierno.pr/Tomo_II/transporteMaritimo.htm#PROG1314|title=Government's page on Lancha de Cataño's economical impact|language=Spanish|publisher=Gobierno de Puerto Rico|year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-08[/tpl]
In an attempt to decrease vehicle dependency and road congestion, the City built a metro system dubbed "Tren Urbano" ("Urban Train"). The [tpl]convert|10.7|mi|adj=on[/tpl] line connects to 16 stations.[tpl]cite web|title=Alternativa de Transporte Integrado homepage|publisher=Departamento de Trasportación Publica|year=2006|url=http://www.ati.gobierno.pr/|language=Spanish|accessdate=2007-05-08[/tpl] The project, which opened in late 2004, cost $2.25 billion and was more than $1 billion over budget and four years late. The Tren Urbano has received less ridership than was originally projected and has not significantly reduced the city's automobile traffic, despite a reported 7.5% ridership increase in 2006 over 2005. There is a planned project to build a "interurban light rail system" connecting the cities of San Juan and Caguas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2004/vol8n15/CBCaguasSanJuan.html|title=Caguas To San Juan In 15 Minutes|publisher=Puerto Rico Herald|year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-08[/tpl]
Increased investment in public transportation, however, has not changed the fact that San Juan is an automobile reliant city and its fast growth has sparked urban sprawl. As of mid-2010, the government has approved plans for a redesign of this Puerto Rican city, featuring a new mass transit system, new roads and intersections, and more beach access points. No cars will be allowed inside the oldest part of city (Old San Juan). The plans hope to remedy previous poor urban planning  in the oldest section of the city, the Isleta, while curbing reliance on motor vehicles. The plans for redevelopment also hope to make the city more appealing in order to attract new residents, as San Juan has suffered from a shrinking population over the past 60 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://issuu.com/sanjuannews/docs/finalreportsummary_walkablecity_july3-final|title=Walkable City San Juan|publisher=Issuu|year=2010|accessdate=2010-08-10[/tpl]
