The Sea Cliff is a historic station along the Oyster Bay Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. It is located on Sea Cliff Avenue and Glen Keith Road between Glen Cove Avenue and Cedar Swamp Road in the City of Glen Cove, New York, east of the Town of Oyster Bay hamlet of Sea Cliff, New York. The station was actually named after Sea Cliff Avenue, rather than the hamlet.

==History==

Sea Cliff station was built in 1867, and renovated in May 1888 at the cost of $4,000. The station is typical of many LIRR stations of the late-Victorian era. It contains a two-story red brick structure with an gabled-roof that extended into canopies on the sides, which contains elaborate gingerbread woodwork along the canopies. From July 2, 1902 to December 31, 1924, it had connections to two trolley lines. One was the Sea Cliff Village Trolley, owned by the Nassau County Railway and the other was the Glen Cove Railroad which ran along the Oyster Bay Branch right-of-way into Downtown Glen Cove in 1905. From 1909 to 1956, it also contained a wooden pedestrian bridge.Bob Emery Sea Cliff Station map (TrainsAreFun.com) Nearly a century after the second station was built, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The station was renovated in 1997.[tpl]cite book |last=Morrison |first=David D. |last2=Pakaluk |first2=Valerie |title=Long Island Rail Road Stations |series=Images of Rail |year=2003 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |location=Chicago |page=59 |isbn=0-7385-1180-3 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=20BUDIVc-5AC&pg=PA59 |accessdate=2011-11-25[/tpl]

This station has two high-level side platforms, each four cars long. The west platform, adjacent to Track 1, is generally used by southbound or New York City-bound trains. The east platform, adjacent to Track 2, is generally used by northbound or Oyster Bay-bound trains. The Oyster Bay Branch has two main tracks at this location, and there is also a spur east of the east platform. The spur is currently used for track maintenance equipment, but was used as a freight siding until the 1970s. The siding at one point crossed Sea Cliff Avenue to service Sea Cliff Coal and Lumber, whose covered coal dump still stands.
