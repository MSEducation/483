The Chabad movement represents a school of thought established and led by a dynasty of Hasidic rebbes. The Chabad movement was founded in the late 18th century by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the first rebbe of Chabad. The movement was based in Lyubavichi (Lubavitch) for over a century, beginning with the second rebbe, Rabbi Dovber Schneuri, until the fifth rebbe, Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn. The movement was briefly centered in the cities of Rostov-on-Don, Riga, and Warsaw. From the start of World War Two until the present day, the movement's center has been in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.Chabad.org. "Sholom Dovber Schneersohn".

==History==

The Chabad movement was established in the town of Liozna, Grand Duchy of Lithuania (present day Belarus), in 1775, by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi. Rabbi Shneur Zalman was a student of Rabbi Dovber ben Avraham, the "Maggid of Mezritch", the successor of Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism. The movement later relocated its center to Poland, and finally, to the United States.
Today, Chabad is among the world's largest Hasidic groups, and it is the largest Jewish religious organization. The vast network of Chabad institutions have placed the movement at the forefront of Jewish communal life today.
While the movement has spawned a number of other groups, the Chabad-Lubavitch branch appears to be the only one still active, making it the movement's main surviving line. In the early 1900s, Chabad-Lubavitch legally incorporated itself under Agudas Chasidei Chabad ("Association of Chabad Hasidim").

===Leadership===

The Chabad movement has been led by a succession of Hasidic rebbes. The main line of the movement, Chabad-Lubavitch, has had seven rebbes in total:

===The Chabad community===

The Chabad community consists of the followers (Hasidim) of the Chabad Rebbes. Originally, based in Eastern Europe, today, various Chabad communities span the globe; the communities with higher concentrations of Chabad's Hasidic followers are located in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and Kfar Chabad, Israel. Other communities hold smaller population sizes.
The members or adherents of the Chabad movement are formally called "Chabad Chasidim" (Hasidim). Other designations include "Lubavitchers", "Chabadskers" (Yiddish) and  "Chabadnikim" (Hebrew). Chabad's adherents include both Hasidic followers, as well as non-Hasidim, who have joined Chabad synagogues and other Chabad run institutions.

===Oppression in Russia===

The Chabad movement was subject to government oppression in Russia. The Russian government, first under the Czar, later under the Bolsheviks, imprisoned several of the Chabad rebbes. The Bolsheviks also imprisoned, exiled and executed a number of Chabad Hasidim. But since the fall of communism in 1991, Chabad has enjoyed warm relations with the Russian government.

==Philosophy==

Chabad Hasidic philosophy focuses on religious and spiritual concepts such as God, the soul, and the meaning of the Jewish commandments. Classical Judaic writings and Jewish mysticism, especially the Zohar and the Kabbalah of Rabbi Isaac Luria, are frequently cited in Chabad works. These texts are used both as sources for Chabad teachings, as well as material requiring interpretation by Chabad authors. Chabad philosophy is rooted in the teachings of Rabbis Yisroel ben Eliezer, (the Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism) and Dovber ben Avraham, the "Maggid of Mezritch" (Rabbi Yisroel's successor).
Rabbi Shneur Zalman's teachings formed the basis of Chabad philosophy, as expanded by succeeding generations. Many Chabad activities today are understood as applications of Shneur Zalman's teachings.

===Tanya===

Sefer HaTanya, Shneur Zalman's magnum opus, is the first schematic treatment of Hasidic moral philosophy and its metaphysical foundations. The original name of the first book is Sefer Shel Beinonim, the "Book of the Intermediates." It is also known as Likutei Amarim — "Collected Sayings." Sefer Shel Beinonim analyzes the inner struggle of the individual and the path to resolution. Citing the biblical verse "the matter is very near to you, in your mouth, your heart, to do",Deuturonomy 30:14. the philosophy is based on the notion that the human is not inherently evil; rather, every individual has an inner conflict that is characterized with two different inclinations, the good and the bad.The Encyclopedia of Hasidism, entry: Tanya, Jonathan Sacks, pp. 475–477 (15682–11236)

===="Chabad"====

According to Shneur Zalman's seminal work Tanya, the intellect consists of three interconnected processes: Chochma (wisdom), Bina (understanding), and Da'at (knowledge). While other branches of Hasidism focused primarily on the idea that "God desires the heart," Shneur Zalman argued that God also desires the mind, and that the mind is the "gateway," to the heart. With the Chabad philosophy he elevated the mind above the heart, arguing that "understanding is the mother of fear and love for God".''Tanya', Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Chapter 13.
Chabad often contrasted itself with the Chagat schools of Hasidism."Chagat" is an acronym for "Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet" (kindness, severity, beauty), the Kabbalistic terms for the three primary emotions. Schools of Hasidic thought stressing emotive patterns of worship have been termed "Chagat". While all Hasidism have a certain focus on the emotions, Chagat saw emotions as a reaction to physical stimuli, such as dancing singing or beauty. Shneur Zalman, on the other hand, taught that the emotions must be led by the mind, and thus the focus of Chabad thought was to be Torah study and prayer rather than esotericism and song. As a Talmudist, Shneur Zalman endeavored to place Kabbalah and Hasidism on a rational basis. In Tanya, he defines his approach as moach shalit al halev (Hebrew: "מוח שליט על הלב", "the brain ruling the heart").Tanya, ch. 12

==Customs==

Chabad adherents follow Chabad traditions and prayer services based on Lurianic kabbalah. General Chabad customs, called minhagim, distinguish the movemment from other Hasidic groups. Some of the main Chabad customs are minor practices performed on traditional Jewish holidays:

==Holidays==

There are a number of days marked by the Chabad movement as special days. Major holidays include the liberation dates of the leaders of the movement, the Rebbes of Chabad, others corresponded to the leaders' birthdays, anniversaries of death, and other life events.
The days marking the leaders' release, are celebrated by the Chabad movement as "Days of Liberation" (Hebrew: יום גאולה (Yom Geulah)). The most noted day is Yud Tes Kislev – The liberation of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the founder of the Chabad movement. The day is also called the "New Year of Hasidism".Chabad Customs. Kehot Publication Society. Sichosinenglish.org
The birthdays of several of the movement's leaders are celebrated each year include Chai Elul, the birthday of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the founder of the Chabad movement,Dalfin, Chaim "Chabad Elul Customs".

==Demographics==

Demographic accounts on the Chabad movement vary. Chabad adherents are often reported to number some 200,000 persons.The perfect matzo a matter of timing, Associated Press April. 12, 2006Occhiogrosso, Peter. The Joy of Sects: A Spirited Guide to the World's Religious Traditions. New York: Doubleday (1996), Chapter: Judaism; pg. 250.Andryszewski, Tricia. Communities of the Faithful: American Religious Movements Outside the Mainstream. Bookfield, Connecticut: Millbrook Press (1997); pg. 95. Some scholars have pointed to the lack of quantitative data to back this claim, and some place the number of Chabad followers at around 40,000 but note that the number may be higher if the non-Hasidic Jews who join Chabad synagogues are included as well.Heilman, Sam.

===United States===

An estimate for Chabad in the United States places the movement's followers in the US at around 18,600. The estimate is drawn from existing data on the Montreal Chabad community, and Chabad Day School figures.ChabadSociologist.wordpress.com. "At Last: Estimate for Chabad in the US!!!". ''ChabadSociologist.wordpress.com". October 17, 2013.

====Student body in the United States====

The report findings of studies on Jewish Day Schools and supplementary Jewish education in the United States show that the student body currently enrolled in some 295 Chabad schools exceeds 20,750.The Chabad Sociologist.

====Chabad Ashkenazim and Sephardim====

Though the Chabad movement was founded in Eastern Europe, a center of Ashkenazic Jewry, it has in the past several decades attracted a significant number of Sephardi Jews as adherents.Shokeid, Moshe. Children of Circumstances: Israeli Emigrants in New York. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, (1988): 139-160. Some Chabad communities are now a mix of Ashkenazi and Sephardi Chabad Hasidim. In Montreal, close to 25% of Chabad households include a Sephardi parent.The Chabad Sociologist. (2013). "Did You Know 25% of Chabad in Montreal are Sefardi?" chabadsociologist.wordpress.com. http://chabadsociologist.wordpress.com/2013/07/09/did-you-know-25-of-chabad-in-montreal-are-sefardi/Shahar, Charles.

==Influence==

Chabad's influence since World War Two has been far reaching amongst world Jewry. Chabad pioneered the post-World War II outreach movement, which spread Judaism to many assimilated Jews worldwide, leading to a substantial number of baalei teshuva ("returnees" to Judaism). The very first Yeshiva/Rabbinical College for such baalei teshuva, Hadar Hatorah, was established by the Lubavitcher Rebbe. It is reported that up to a million Jews attend Chabad services at least once a year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/subscriber/faith/story/4017869p-4630456c.html |title=Chabad Lubavitch centre set for River Heights area |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070927194259/http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/subscriber/faith/story/4017869p-4630456c.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |date=5 August 2007 |author=Sharon Chisvin |publisher=Winnipeg Free Press[/tpl]
According to Steven I. Weiss, Chabad's ideology has dramatically influenced non-Hasidic Jews' practice with regard to Jewish outreach issues.Weiss, Steven I. "Orthodox Rethinking Campus Outreach", The Jewish Daily Forward, January 20, 2006. (originally) Accessed April 7, 2007
Because of its outreach to all Jews, including those quite alienated from religious Jewish tradition, Chabad has been described as the one Orthodox group to evoke great affection from large segments of American Jewry."Jewish Literacy", Telushkin, William Morrow 2001, p.471

==Organizations==

Chabad's central organization representing the movement at large, Agudas Chasidei Chabad, is headed by Rabbi Abraham Shemtov. The educational and outreach arm, Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch, is headed by Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky. Other central organizations include Lubavitch Youth Organization and Mahane Israel.
Local Chabad centers and institutions are often incorporated as separate legal entities.Burstein, Paul. "Jewish Nonprofit Organizations in the U.S.: A Preliminary Survey". Contemporary Jewry. 31:2. (2011): pp. 129-148. [tpl]DOI|10.1007/s12397-010-9028-5[/tpl]

===Chabad institutions===

As of 2007 there are 3,300 Chabad institutions around the world. As of 2006 there were Chabad centers in 75 countries.
Listed on the Chabad movement's online directory are around 1,350 Chabad institutions. This number includes schools and other Chabad-affiliated establishments. The number of Chabad centers vary per country; the majority are in the United States and Israel. There are over 40 countries which have a small Chabad presence.
In total, according to its directory, Chabad maintains a presence in 950 cities around the world: 178 in Europe, 14 in Africa, 200 in Israel, 400 in North America, 38 in South America, and about 70 in Asia (excluding Israel, including Russia).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/centers |title=The directory of Chabad Institutions throughout the world |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl]

===The "Chabad House"===

A Chabad house is a form of Jewish community center, primarily serving both educational and observance purposes.The New York Times, December 16, 2005. Often, until the community can support its own center, the Chabad house is located in the shaliach's home, with the living room being used as the "synagogue". Effort is made to provide an atmosphere in which the nonobservant will not feel intimidated by any perceived contrast between their lack of knowledge of Jewish practice and the advanced knowledge of some of the people they meet there."Passover Seders Around the World", Associated Press, March 19, 2007. The term "Chabad House" originated with the creation of the first such outreach center on the campus of UCLA by Rabbi Shlomo Cunin.Challenge
In the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the local Chabad house was targeted.Jewish Center Is Stormed, and 6 Hostages Die[tpl]cite web |author=By Joshua RunyanNov 30, 2008 |url=http://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/775065/jewish/Funeral-Preparations-Under-Way.htm |title=Funeral Preparations for Chabad House Victims Under Way |publisher=Chabad.org |date=2008-11-30 |accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl] The local Chabad emissaries, Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivka, and four other Jews were brutally murdered. Chabad received condolences from around the world.Obama sends condolences to Chabad, Jewish Telegraph Agency (JTA), December 4, 2008.

===Fundraising===

Funds for activities of a Chabad center rely entirely on the local community. Chabad centers do not receive funding from Lubavitch headquarters. For the day to day operations, local emissaries do all the fundraising by themselves.
Chabad emissaries often solicit the support of local Jews.M. Avrum Ehrlich. The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present. p. 134. Funds are used toward purchasing or renovating Chabad centers, synagogues and Mikvahs.Fishkoff, Sue, ‘’The Rebbe’s Army’’, Schoken books 2003 (ISBN 08052 11381) pages 160–161.

==Activities==

The Chabad movement has been involved in numerous activities in contemporary Jewish life. These activities include providing Jewish education to different age groups, outreach to non-affiliated Jews, publishing Jewish literature, summer camps for children among other activities.

===Education===

Chabad runs a number of educational institutions. Most are Jewish day schools; others offer secondary and adult education.

===Outreach activities===

Much of the movement's activities emphasize on outreach activities. This is due to Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson encouraging his followers to reach out to other Jews.Hayom Yom, p.A38 Chabad outreach includes activities promoting the practice of Jewish commandments (Mitzvah campaigns), as well as other forms of Jewish outreach. Much of Chabad's outreach is performed by Chabad emissaries (see Shaliach (Chabad)).

====Mitzvah campaigns====

The Rebbes of Chabad have issued the call to all Jews to attract non-observant Jews to adopt Orthodox Jewish observance, teaching that this activity is part of the process of bringing the Messiah. Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson issued a call to every Jew: "Even if you are not fully committed to a Torah life, do something. Begin with a mitzvah — any mitzvah — its value will not be diminished by the fact that there are others that you are not prepared to do".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/62228/jewish/10-Point-Mitzvah-Campaign.htm |title=The Rebbe's 10-Point Mitzvah Campaign |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl]
Schneerson also suggested ten specific mitzvot that he believed were ideally suited for the emissaries to introduce to non-observant Jews. These were called "mivtzoim" — meaning "campaigns" or "endeavors." These were: lighting candles before Shabbat and the Jewish holidays by Jewish women; putting on tefillin; affixing a mezuzah; regular Torah study; giving Tzedakah; purchasing Jewish books; observing kashrut (kosher); kindness to others; Jewish religious education, and observing the family purity laws.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
In addition, Schneerson emphasized spreading awareness of preparing for and the coming of the moshiach Jewish messiah, consistent with his philosophy. He wrote on the responsibility to reach out to teach every fellow Jew with love, and implored that all Jews believe in the imminent coming of the  moshiach as explained by Maimonides. He argued that redemption was predicated on Jews doing good deeds, and that gentiles should be educated about the Noahide Laws. Chabad has been a prime force in disseminating awareness of these laws.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
Schneerson was emphatic about the need to encourage and provide strong education for every child, Jew and non-Jew alike.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]

====Shluchim (Emissaries)====

Following the initiative of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson spurred on the movement to what has become known as shlichus ("serving as an emissary outreach") in 1950–1951. As a result, Chabad shluchim ("emissaries", sing. shliach) have moved all over the world with the stated mission of encouraging non-observant Jews to adopt Orthodox Jewish observance. They assist Jews with all their religious needs, as well as with physical assistance and spiritual guidance and teaching. The stated goal is to encourage Jews to learn more about their Jewish heritage and to practice Judaism.Fishkoff, Sue, "The Rebbe’s Army", Schoken books 2003 (ISBN 08052 11381)
The Chabad movement, motivated by Schneerson, has trained and ordained thousands of rabbis, educators, ritual slaughterers, and ritual circumcisers, who are then accompanied by their spouses to many locations around the world. Typically, a young Lubavitch rabbi and his wife, in their early twenties, with one or two children, will move to a new location, and as they settle in will raise a large family who as a family unit, will aim to fulfill their mandate of bringing Jewish people closer to Orthodox Judaism and encouraging gentiles to adhere to the Seven Laws of Noah.

====Mitzvah tank====

A mitzvah tank is a vehicle used by Chabad members involved in outreach as a portable "educational and outreach center" and "mini-synagogue" (or "minagogue"). Mitzvah tanks are commonly used for advancing the Mitzvah campaigns. Mitzvah tanks have been commonplace on the streets of New York City since 1974.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/timeline_cdo/aid/62178/jewish/1974-The-Mitzvah-Tank.htm |title=1974: The Mitzvah Tank on |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-13[/tpl] Today, they are used all over the globe, in countries where Chabad is active.

====Campus outreach====

In recent years, Chabad has greatly expanded its outreach on university and college campuses. Chabad Student Centers are active on over 100 campuses, and Chabad offers varied activities at an additional 150 universities worldwide.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chabad.edu |title=Directory of Chabad on Campus |publisher=Chabad.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl] Professor Alan Dershowitz has said that "Chabad’s presence on college campuses today is absolutely crucial", and "We cannot rest until Chabad is on every major college campus in the world".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oxfordchabad.org/templates/articlecco.html?AID=331005 |title=Oxford Chabad website quoting Dershowitz |publisher=Oxfordchabad.org |date=2005-11-27 |accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl]

===Publishing===

Chabad publishes and distributes Jewish religious literature. Under Kehot Publication Society, Chabad's main publishing house, Jewish literature has been translated into 12 different languages. Kehot regularly provides books at discounted prices, and hosts book-a-thons. Kehot commonly distributes books written or transcribed from the rebbes of Chabad, prominent chassidim and other authors who have written Jewish materials.
Kehot is a division of Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch, the movement's educational arm.

Letter to Zalman Shazar[/ref] He maintained that as a matter of Jewish law,Based on Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim, 328 any territorial concession on Israel's part would endanger the lives of all Jews in the Land of Israel, and is therefore forbidden. He also insisted that even discussing the possibility of such concessions showed weakness, would encourage Arab attacks, and therefore endanger Jewish lives.Essentially his argument was sought merely the position which would prevent loss of life, rather than taking a stance in the nature of the Land of Israel and Zionism [tpl]cite web |last=Freeman |first=Tzvi |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/807777/jewish/Should-I-Pray-for-the-Death-of-Terrorists.htm |title=Should I Pray for the Death of Terrorists? – Ethics & Religion |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl]
In USA domestic politics, Schneerson supported government involvement in education and welcomed the establishment of the United States Department of Education in 1980, yet insisted that part of a school's educational mission was to incorporate the values espoused in the Seven Laws of Noah. He called for the introduction of a moment of silence at the beginning of the school day, and for students to be encouraged to use this time for such improving thoughts or prayers as their parents might suggest.Hayom Yom, p.A29

===Messianism===

In the late 1980s, the Rebbe called for his followers to become involved in outreach activities with the purpose of bringing about the Jewish Messianic Age. Statements concerning the advancement of the Messianic age was a factor leading to the controversy surrounding the messianic beliefs of some members of the movement.
