The Euchites or Messalians were a sect first mentioned in the 370s by Ephrem the Syrian,Ephrem the Syrian, Against the Heresies, 22.4 and Epiphanius,Epiphanius, Ancoratus 13, and Panarion 80 and Jerome.,Jerome, Dialogue against the PelagiansFrances Young, From Nicaea to Chalcedon, (2nd edn, 2010), p118 and first condemned as heretical in a synod of 383 AD (Side, Pamphylia), whose acta was referred by Photius.http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pearse/morefathers/files/photius_03bibliotheca.htm#52 From Mesopotamia they spread to Asia Minor and Thrace. The name 'Messalian' comes from the Syriac [tpl]lang|syr|ܡܨܠܝܢܐ[/tpl], mṣallyānā, meaning 'one who prays'.[tpl]cite book| last=Payne Smith | first=Jessie | title=A Compendious Syriac Dictionary | pages=294, 478 (for the root)[/tpl] The Greek translation is [tpl]lang|grc|εὐχίτης[/tpl], euchitēs, meaning the same.
Modern scholarship has questioned, though, whether a coherent heretical movement existed behind these condemnations, and has emphasised instead the friction in the Eastern Church caused by Messalianism's 'ascetical practices and imagistic language far more characteristic of Syriac Christianity than of the imperial Church centred on Constantinople'.Columba Stewart,  'Working the Heart of the Earth': The Messalian Controversy in History, Texts and Language to AD431, (1991); Frances Young, From Nicaea to Chalcedon, (2nd edn, 2010), p118
The condemnation of the sect by St John Damascene and Timothy, priest of Constantinople, expressed the view that the sect espoused a sort of mystical materialism. The sect's teaching asserted that:
Messalians taught that once a person experienced the essence of God they were freed from moral obligations or ecclesiastical discipline.The Vision of God by Vladimir Lossky pg 111-112The Macarian Legacy: The Place of Macarius-Symeon in the Eastern Christian Tradition (Oxford Theological Monographs 2004) by Marcus Plested pg 16–27 They had male and female teachers whom they honored more than the clergy, the "perfecti".

The group continued to exist for several centuries, influencing the Bogomils of Bulgaria, whose name appears to be a translation of "Messalian" and, thereby, the Bosnian Church, the Patarenes and Catharism.S.

By the 12th century the sect had reached Bohemia and Germany[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] and, by a resolution of the Council of Trier (1231), was condemned as heretical.
