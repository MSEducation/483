[[Nandor (Middle-earth)]]

CATEGORIES: Middle-earth Elves

In the fictional word of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Nandor (singular Nando) were Elves of the Teleri, the third clan of Elves.

==Internal History of the Nandor==

When the marching Elves reached the Hithaeglir (Misty Mountains) some left the Great Journey under their leader Lenwë (Dan or Denweg in Nandorin). These Elves turned south along the Great River (Anduin). 
Nandor means in Quenya "those who turned back".
Many years later a group of Nandor under Denethor, son of Lenwë, crossed the Ered Luin into Ossiriand, which was after named Lindon, or Land of the singers, after these elves. They became known as the Laiquendi (singular Laiquendë) or Green Elves.
The Silvan Elves of Mirkwood and Lothlórien were Nandor (but most of their lords were not), as were the Elves which dwelt at Edhellond near Dol Amroth. They also mixed with Avarin Elves and in minor part with the Sindar and the Noldor (the latter especially mixing with the Silvan Elves of Lothlórien, these were exiles and survivors from the Elven realm of Eregion).
Nandor meant "those who turn back" in Quenya. They called themselves Danas after their leader Dan (Lenwë in Quenya). These Elves were later called Silvan Elves or Wood-elves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/nandorin.htm |title=Nandorin |work=Ardalambion |first=Helge K. |last=Fauskanger |publisher=University of Bergen |accessdate=17 September 2012[/tpl]

==Nandorin==

Nandorin is a constructed language devised by J. R. R. Tolkien. It is one of the many fictional language set in his Secondary world, often called Middle-earth.
In the setting of Tolkien's works, Nandorin is the language of the Nandor Elves. It gradually disappeared from Middle-earth after the end of the First Age, when Sindar elves merged with the Silvan folk and were taken as their lords. Nandorin/Silvan gradually became extinct, surviving only in placenames such as Laurelindórinan/Lindórinand (old names for Lórien) and proper names such as Amroth. The daily tongue of the Silvan elves became Sindarin, or Sindarin with some Silvan influences.
