==Movies==

Ravi has directed the following films:
Since 2006, the only movies Ravi produced after his father's death was Bhoothnath and Bhoothnath Returns. Ravi Chopra was served with a legal notice in 2009 by 20th Century Fox, which charged that his upcoming movie Banda Yeh Bindaas Hai blatantly plagiarized the 1992 comedy My Cousin Vinny. Chopra and the production company, Mumbai-based BR Films, denied the charges in court in May 2009; the movie's release was to be delayed until June 2009 by order of the Bombay High Court. Fox sought damages of $1.4 million; this was the first time a Bollywood filmmaker was taken to court by a Hollywood company over the remaking of a film. Fox had given Chopra permission "to make a film loosely based on the Oscar winning movie" but concluded the final product was a "substantial reproduction" of the original.

Ravi directed the highly successful television serial Mahabharat, which aired during 1988-1990, and the television mini-series, Ramayan, which was aired in 2002.
