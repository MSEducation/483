==Etymology==

Two theories have been put forward for the origin of Burlington's name.  The first is that it was named after Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, while the second is that the name honors the politically prominent and wealthy Burling family of New York. While no family members are listed as grantees of the town, the family held large tracts of land in other nearby towns, some of which were granted on the same day as Burlington.Swift, Esther Munroe (1977) Vermont Place-Names ISBN 0-8289-0291-7. p.165

==History==

One of the New Hampshire grants, the land which became Burlington was awarded by Governor Benning Wentworth on June 7, 1763 to Samuel Willis and 63 others.Coolidge, A. J. and Mansfield, J. B. A History and Description of New England. Boston, 1859 In the summer of 1775 land clearing began and two or three log huts were erected, but the Revolution delayed permanent settlement until 1783, when Stephen Lawrence arrived with his family. The town was organized in 1785.
The War of 1812 was unpopular in Vermont. Along with the rest of New England, Vermont did not provide militia units or financial support. Vermont voted for the Federalist party, which opposed the war.Johnson, Tim. "1812: A look back at Burlington's 20-minute war". Burlington Free Press (July 29, 2007) p.4A Nevertheless, 5,000 troops were stationed there at one point during the War of 1812, outnumbering residents; about 500 of them died of disease.Logan, Lee. "Grant may help Burlington reclaim War of 1812 heritage" Burlington Free Press (July 8, 2007) Some soldiers were quartered in the main building at the University of Vermont, where a memorial plaque commemorates them.[tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl]
In a skirmish on August 2, 1813, the British shelled Burlington. This has either been cited as a bold stroke by the British with an ineffectual response from the Americans, or a weak sally by the British, properly ignored by the Americans, depending on who relates the story. The cannonade lasted for about ten minutes and did not affect the outcome of the war. The American side was commanded by Naval Lieutenant Thomas Macdonough, later hero of the Battle of Lake Champlain.
The town's position on Lake Champlain helped it develop into a port of entry and center for trade, particularly after completion of the Champlain Canal in 1823, the Erie Canal in 1825, and the Chambly Canal in 1843. Wharves allowed steamboats to connect freight and passengers with the Rutland & Burlington Railroad and Vermont Central Railroad. Burlington became a bustling lumbering and manufacturing center, and incorporated as a city in 1865. Its Victorian era prosperity left behind much fine architecture, including buildings by Ammi B. Young, H. H. Richardson and McKim, Mead & White.
In 1870, the waterfront was extended by construction of the Pine Street Barge Canal.Pine Street Barge Canal This became polluted over the years and is a focus for cleanup in 2009.Evaluation of Pine Street Canal[tpl]clear left[/tpl]

===Public library===

The Fletcher Free Library at 235 College Street at the corner of South Winooski Avenue was established in 1873, endowed by Mary Martha Fletcher, the daughter of a local businessman, but outgrew its initial building on Church Street by 1901. A new building was constructed in 1901-04 with funds provided by industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, making it the first of the four Carnegie libraries in the state.   It was designed in the Beaux-Arts style by Walter R. B. Willcox of Burlington, who won a competition to receive the commission.
The building had major settling problems in 1973 where it had been built over a former railroad ravine, which had been improperly filled in, and the library's collection was moved elsewhere.  The possible razing of the building was stopped by a citizens' committee, which successfully had it added to the National Register of Historic Places, and a grant allowed the stabilization and repair of the building.
