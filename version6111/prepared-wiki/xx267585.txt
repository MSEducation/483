The Nyborg Tunnel is a proposed road tunnel between Åsane and Klauvaneset in Bergen, Norway. If built, it would extend the four-lane motorway section of European Road 39 (E39) from Åsane to the Nordhordland Bridge. The tunnel is presumed financed with a five-year toll collection at the bridge while the tunnel is being built, and then with a toll on the tunnel for 15 years. It is estimated to cost 1,900 million Norwegian krone. Construction will not start earlier than 2013.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nordhordland.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Brosjyre_nhpakken_april11.pdf |title=Nordhordlandspakken |date=April 2011 |language=Norwegian |publisher=Nordhordland Regional Council |accessdate=23 September 2011 |archivedate=23 September 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61uYcTUkY[/tpl]
