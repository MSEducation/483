Central Advisory Commission ([tpl]zh|s=中央顾问委员会|t=中央顧問委員會|p=Zhōngyāng Gùwèn Wěiyuánhuì[/tpl]) (CAC) of the People's Republic of China provided "political assistance and consultation" to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

==History==

The Commission was established after the Twelfth People's Political Consultative Conference in 1982, and abolished in 1992. The chairmen were Deng Xiaoping (1982-1987) and Chen Yun (1987-1992). Its membership was offered only to party members with forty years or more of service which made it almost synonymous with the Eight Elders.  Despite being supposedly advisory its power surpassed that of the Politburo Standing Committee and was nicknamed the sitting committee.
