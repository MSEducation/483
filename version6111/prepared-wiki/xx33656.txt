iCab is a web browser for the Macintosh by Alexander Clauss, derived from Crystal Atari Browser (CAB) for Atari TOS compatible computers. It was one of the few browsers that was still updated for the classic Mac OS; only Classilla is more recent. The downloadable product is fully functional, but is nagware—periodically displaying a dialog box asking the user to register the product, and upgrade to the "Pro" version.

==Versions==

While no longer maintained, iCab 2.9.9 is still available for download and registration. It supported both 68k and PowerPC Macintosh systems running System 7.5 through Mac OS 9.2.2. It also supported early versions of Mac OS X natively up to iCab 2.9.8, but those iCab versions are no longer available for download.

As of January 2008, iCab 3 is still maintained.  This version can run on PowerPC systems running Mac OS 8.5 through Mac OS 9.2.2, or PowerPC or Intel systems running Mac OS X 10.1 or later.

===iCab 4.x===

iCab 4 was rewritten to use the Cocoa API and the WebKit rendering engine.  It can run on PowerPC or Intel systems running Mac OS 10.3.9 or later.

iCab 5 was released on June 12, 2012.  It runs on Mac OS 10.5 or later.

==History==

iCab's original rendering engine was often criticized for not supporting CSS and DOM.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] iCab 3 introduced improved rendering capabilities, including support for CSS2 and Unicode (via the ATSUI toolkit). iCab 4 switched to WebKit for its rendering engine, giving it the same rendering abilities as Apple's Safari browser.
On 7 June 2009, iCab 4.6, using the WebKit rendering engine, became the first desktop browser released to display a score of 100/100 and pass the Acid3 test.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl] Apple's Safari 4 browser was released one day later and has been officially credited as being the first official release browser to pass the Acid3 test with a score of 100/100.

==Features==

iCab features a filter manager which allows users to avoid downloading advertisements and other content. Currently iCab comes with two filters (advertisements and video). Other kinds of filters add features, such as the YouTube video filter which adds a download link on all YouTube page views.
iCab has features for website developers, including an HTML validity checker, an automatic page refresh option, a Web Inspector, DOM Inspector, JavaScript debugger, and a Console.  iCab’s “Automatic Update” option, for any page it is rendering directly from the local hard disk, will automatically reload the page when changes are saved to disk. The HTML syntax validity checker displays a smiley face in the Status Bar and also, optionally, in the Toolbar. Clicking on the smiley will bring up a list of any errors on the page, as will “Error Report” from the Tools menu.  Double clicking on an error will display the page source, with the offending syntax highlighted. The HTML syntax validator was first seen in the same author's earlier web browser, CAB.
iCab’s Download manager allows the user start, stop, resume and review downloads.  It maintains a download history, supports downloading of an individual page, or a whole site (crawling) with many user selectable crawl-constraint options.  It can save as portable web archives (a ZIP archive containing HTML, images and other files), or as individual files on the local hard drive.
iCab also contains the following features:
