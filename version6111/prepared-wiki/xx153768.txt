Stadlern is a municipality  in the district of Schwandorf in Bavaria, Germany.

==History==

In the 11. century the castle of Reichenstein was the center of the settlement of the region around Stadlern. It was built under the reign of Charlemagne or his successors to fortify the Bavarian Nordgau (now Upper Palatinate). Stadlern was a little settlement beneath the castle where the servants of the castle lived.
1266 Ottokar II of Bohemia conquered and devastated the whole region. After that Reichenstein with Stadlern belonged to Bohemia to the earls of Hostau.
1333 the Stadlern was sold to earl Ulrich of Leuchtenberg - this is where Stadlern is for the first time mentioned in written form.
1425 and 1431 ravaged the Hussites Stadlern.
Stadlern changed often its owner and was eventually 1803 sold to the earl of Du Moulin-Eckart to whom it belongs until today.
All this centuries Stadlern was inhabited by Bavarians but was Bohemian fief. Finally as result of the Peace of Pressburg (1805) Stadlern came to Bavaria.Andreas Lesser (Hrsg.): Stadlern im Oberpfälzer Wald. Forstner GmbH, Oberviechtach 2000, ISBN 3-00-006390-0, p. 26-28
