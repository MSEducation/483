===Amnesty International===

The bombing raised serious criticisms from the Amnesty Internationalhttp://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA37/022/1999/fr/661b9c60-9171-49cd-9fcc-b400f7954cd8/asa370221999en.pdfhttp://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA37/022/1999/en/33f41c35-e034-11dd-865a-d728958ca30a/asa370221999en.html which in a statement expressing concern over the bombing, said a Sri Lankan military spokesperson had denied the raid, which killed at least 21 refugees in a crowded market place, had been a deliberate attack on civilians.
The organization also questioned the Sri Lankan military's adherence to the fundamental rules of the Humanitarian law which include the prohibition of direct attacks on civilians and civilian objects and the prohibition of attacks on military targets expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life.

===Sri Lankan Government===

The charges were denied by the Sri Lankan government spokesperson who claimed that two bombing raids were conducted in the area and one of them was aimed at a nearby LTTE base. But this was rejected by other sources, who claimed that the LTTE camp was located near the Nandikadal Lagoon situated 4 and a half kilometers away from the town. 
A Tamil politician from Colombo said that the SLAF attack on the civilian target appeared to be in retaliation to the heavy losses suffered last Sunday by the Sri Lanka army north of Mannar. 
He pointed out that civilian targets have been bombed by the SLAF in past following major set backs in the war against the Liberation Tigers.
According to independent sources, 138 Sri Lanka army personnel, including two officers, were killed and 902 were wounded when the Liberation Tigers counter attacked a major offensive by government forces.
