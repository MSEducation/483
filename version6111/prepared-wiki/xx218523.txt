It was Yao's love of singing from his school days at Dulwich College that lead him years later to acting.  He first trained in musical theatre under Professors Mary Hammond and Paul Farrington of the Royal Academy of Music.  Part of that training was sponsored by Sir Cameron Mackintosh.  He counts amongst his acting tutors former RADA director and friend Andrew Neil.  Yao has also appeared in numerous adverts and corporate videos.
