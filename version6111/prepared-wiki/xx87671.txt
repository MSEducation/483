==History==

A permanent station building was built in 1886, the present buildings in 1925. The bridge over Racecourse Road is the third on the site. Interlocking and a signal box for the Racecourse line junction were brought into use in 1880, becoming remotely controlled from Kensington in 1969.
The station was used during construction of CityLink in 1997/98 for passengers to shuttle to and from Flemington Bridge station on the Upfield line because trains were not running on the Upfield line between Flemington Bridge and North Melbourne due to the closure of Macaulay station to allow elevated roads linking the West Gate Freeway and the Tullamarine Freeway to be constructed.
In the 2010s, it became obvious that structural problems were affecting the building on Platform 1, which is elevated and on concrete piers on which cracks and concrete cancer were evident. The retaining wall at the back of the platform was also exhibiting extensive concrete cancer. Metal props were inserted to shore up the piers, and the cantilevered awning over the platform was demolished and replaced by a temporary timber structure. Half of the large ramp from street level to the station entrance was removed, partly to allow three steel straps to be bolted to the outside of the building to support the wall.[tpl]cite web|title=Crumbling station building at Newmarket|url=http://railgallery.wongm.com/crumbling-newmarket|publisher=Wongm's Rail Gallery|accessdate=2013-10-01[/tpl]
Special services to Flemington Racecourse and Showgrounds stations run though the station, but do not stop, with signs on the platform advising passengers of the fact. The junction for the Flemington Racecourse line is immediately north of the station.
