Recorded at the same May 10, 1953 session as the boogie-woogie-like R&B hit "Mess Around", which was written by Ertegun and released first, "It Should've Been Me" played on a comedic rap vibe/jive in which Charles talked about certain instances where he was smitten with "fine chicks" only to be dismayed that they had partners causing Charles (and in background vocal, Atlantic session musician and writer Jesse Stone), to say "it should have been (him) with (those) real fine chick(s)."
Released in early 1954, the song became Charles' first charted hit for Atlantic Records and soon reached number five on the Billboard R&B singles chart.
