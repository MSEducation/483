==History==

Bluefish was started by Chris Mazuc and Olivier Sessink in 1997 to facilitate web development professionals on Linux desktop platforms. Bluefish has been developed ever since by a changing group of professional web developers under lead of Olivier Sessink. The project has had different names. The initial name Thtml editor was abandoned for being too cryptic. The following name Prosite was abandoned to avoid clashes with multiple web development companies that used this name in a commercial context in various countries. The name Bluefish was chosen after a logo (a child's drawing of a fish, in blue) was proposed on the mailing list. Since the 1.0 release the original logo was replaced with a new, more polished logo.
