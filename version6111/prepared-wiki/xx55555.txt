Metformin (BAN, USAN and INN, pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|m|ɛ|t|ˈ|f|ɔr|m|ɨ|n[/tpl], [tpl]respell|met|FAWR|min[/tpl]; sold as Glucophage) is an oral antidiabetic drug in the biguanide class. It is the first-line drug of choice for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, in particular, in overweight and obese people and those with normal kidney function.Clinical Guidelines Task Force, International Diabetes Federation (2005).

It is also used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, and has been investigated for other diseases where insulin resistance may be an important factor. Metformin works by suppressing glucose production by the liver.
A preponderance of evidence suggests that metformin may prevent the cardiovascular complications of diabetes. It helps reduce LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and is not associated with weight gain. [tpl]As of|2010[/tpl], metformin is one of only two oral antidiabetics in the World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines (the other being glibenclamide).(March 2010) [tpl]PDFlink|WHO Model List of Essential Medicines|433 KB[/tpl], 16th edition, World Health Organization, p. 24. Retrieved December 22, 2010.
Metformin causes few adverse effects when prescribed appropriately (the most common is gastrointestinal upset) and has been associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia. Lactic acidosis (a buildup of lactate in the blood) can be a serious concern in overdose and when it is prescribed to people with contraindications, but otherwise, there is no significant risk.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lipska KJ, Bailey CJ, Inzucchi SE | title = Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 1431–7 |date=June 2011  | pmid = 21617112 | pmc = 3114336 | doi = 10.2337/dc10-2361 [/tpl]
First synthesized and found to reduce blood sugar in the 1920s, metformin was forgotten for the next two decades as research shifted to insulin and other antidiabetic drugs. Interest in metformin was rekindled in the late 1940s after several reports that it could reduce blood sugar levels in people, and in 1957, French physician Jean Sterne published the first clinical trial of metformin as a treatment for diabetes. It was introduced to the United Kingdom in 1958, Canada in 1972, and the United States in 1995. Metformin is now believed to be the most widely prescribed antidiabetic drug in the world; in the United States alone, more than 48 million prescriptions were filled in 2010 for its generic formulations.[tpl]PDFlink|"The Use of Medicines in the United States: Review of 2010"|1.79 MB[/tpl].

==Medical uses==

Metformin is primarily used for type 2 diabetes, but is increasingly being used in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),[tpl]vcite journal |author=Lord JM, Flight IHK, Norman RJ |title=Metformin in polycystic ovary syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |year=2003 |volume=327 |issue=7421 |pages=951–3 |pmid=14576245 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/327/7421/951 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7421.951 | pmc=259161[/tpl] and in prediabetes.

===Type 2 diabetes===

Evidence supports metformin as a first-line agent to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), metformin reduced diabetes complications and overall mortality in overweight diabetics by about 30% when compared with insulin and sulfonylureas (glibenclamide and chlorpropamide) and by about 40% over 10 years when compared with the group only given dietary advice. (UKPDS study) This difference held in people who were followed up for five to 10 years after the study.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Holman RR, Paul SK, Bethel MA, Matthews DR, Neil HA |title=10-year follow-up of intensive glucose control in type 2 diabetes |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=359 |issue=15 |pages=1577–89 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18784090 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0806470 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/359/15/1577[/tpl] In the UKPDS study metformin was the only drug associated with decreased mortality.[tpl]cite journal|last=Shaughnessy|first=A. F|title=What happened to the valid POEMs? A survey of review articles on the treatment of type 2 diabetes|journal=BMJ|date=31 July 2003|volume=327|issue=7409|pages=266–0|doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7409.266[/tpl]  Since intensive glucose control with metformin appears to decrease the risk of diabetes-related endpoints in overweight people with diabetes, and is associated with less weight gain and fewer hypoglycaemic attacks than are insulin and sulphonylureas, it may be the first-line pharmacological therapy of choice in this group. In addition, metformin had no effect on body weight: Over the 10-year treatment period, the metformin group gained about 1 kg, the same as the dietary advice group, while the sulfonylureas group gained 3 kg, and the insulin group, 6 kg.[tpl]vcite journal |title=Effect of intensive blood-glucose control with metformin on complications in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes (UKPDS 34).

A dissenting viewpoint is presenting in two recent meta-analyses. The more recent of these, published in 2011, examined the effect of metformin vs. comparator (no treatment, placebo or other anti-diabetic drugs) in 13 trials including 13,000 subjects. No effect effect of metformin on all cause mortality (relative risk, 0.99) or cardiovascular mortality (relative risk, 1.05) relative to other treatments was seen in this analysis. Similarly, there was no significant difference between metformin and alternative treatments in the risk of stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, leg amputation, or microvascular complications. This analysis differed from earlier meta analyses in that it included treatment arms in which metformin plus a sulfonylurea was compared to treatment with metformin alone. In the UKPDS, the combination of metformin plus a sulfonylurea produced a higher mortality rate in normal weight subjects compared to a sulfonylurea alone.[tpl]cite journal |author=Boussageon R, Supper I, Bejan-Angoulvant T, et al. |title=Reappraisal of metformin efficacy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=e1001204 |year=2012 |pmid=22509138 |pmc=3323508 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001204 |url=[/tpl]
A second meta analysis published in 2011 similarly concluded that metformin was not associated with significant benefits overall on endpoints including cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure. A beneficial effect on cardiovascular events was seen compared to placebo, but not relative to active comparators. In subgroup analyses, metformin was associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity in trials that enrolled patients less than 30 years old, or that excluded patients over 65 years old. This study also noted an reduction in survival when metformin was combined with a sulfonylurea.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lamanna C, Monami M, Marchionni N, Mannucci E |title=Effect of metformin on cardiovascular events and mortality: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials |journal=Diabetes Obes Metab |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=221–8 |date=March 2011  |pmid=21205121 |doi=10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01349.x |url=[/tpl]
An American Diabetes Association position paper summarizes the evidence to date regarding metformin and cardiovascular outcomes as "there may be some cardiovascular benefits from this drug metformin, but the clinical trial data are not robust."[tpl]cite journal |author=Inzucchi SE, Bergenstal RM, Buse JB, et al. |title=Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=1364–79 |date=June 2012  |pmid=22517736 |pmc=3357214 |doi=10.2337/dc12-0413 |url=[/tpl]

====Advantages====

Metformin may be associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular mortality compared with other oral diabetes agents or placebo.
All-cause mortality was slightly lower with metformin than with a sulfonylurea in observational studies, but results differed between trials and observational studies. Risk for bias in the studies was moderate. Cardiovascular mortality was slightly lower with metformin than with a sulfonylurea, but results were imprecise and had moderate risk for bias.(Low strength of evidence).
Observational studies were associated with a lower risk for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity than were sulfonylureas.

Metformin is not associated with weight gain, rather weight loss.
In comparison with thiazolidinediones or sulfonylureas, the mean differences in body weight were about −2.5 kg.[tpl]cite web|last=Jonas|first=Dan|title=Drug Class Review: Newer Diabetes Medications, TZDs, and Combinations Final Original Report Drug Class Reviews|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0009777/|publisher=Oregon Health & Science University;|accessdate=1 April 2014[/tpl]
Metformin modestly reduces LDL and triglyceride levels. Metformin decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with pioglitazone, sulfonylureas, and DPP-4 inhibitors.
Metformin  is similarly efficacious as most diabetes medications when used as mono therapy and decreased HbA1c levels by 1 absolute percentage point on average over the course of a study.   Metformin reduced HbA1c levels more than the DPP-4 inhibitors as mono therapy. Combination therapy (including the combination of metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor) decreased HbA1c levels more than monotherapy did, by about 1 absolute percentage point.
Metformin is not expensive.[tpl]cite journal|last=Clarke|first=P.|coauthors=A. Gray, A. Adler, R. Stevens, M. Raikou, C. Cull, I. Stratton, R.

===Prediabetes===

Metformin treatment of people at risk for type 2 diabetes may decrease their chances of developing the disease, although intensive physical exercise and dieting work significantly better for this purpose. In a large U.S. study known as the Diabetes Prevention Program, participants were divided into groups and given either placebo, metformin, or lifestyle intervention, and followed for an average of three years. The intensive program of lifestyle modifications included a 16-lesson training on dieting and exercise followed by monthly individualized sessions with the goals to decrease the body weight by 7% and engage in a physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week. The incidence of diabetes was 58% lower in the lifestyle group and 31% lower in those given metformin. Among younger people with a higher body mass index, lifestyle modification was no more effective than metformin, and for older individuals with a lower body mass index, metformin was no better than placebo in preventing diabetes.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Knowler WC, Barrett-Connor E, Fowler SE, et al. |author.= |title=Reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle intervention or metformin |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=346 |issue=6 |pages=393–403 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11832527 |pmc=1370926 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa012512[/tpl] After ten years, the incidence of diabetes was 34% lower in the group of participants given diet and exercise and 18% lower in those given metformin.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Knowler WC, Fowler SE, Hamman RF, et al. |author.= |title=10-year follow-up of diabetes incidence and weight loss in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study |journal=Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9702 |pages=1677–86 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19878986 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61457-4 |pmc=3135022[/tpl] It is unclear whether metformin slowed down the progression of prediabetes to diabetes (true preventive effect), or the decrease of diabetes in the treated population was simply due to its glucose-lowering action (treatment effect).[tpl]vcite journal |author=Lilly M, Godwin M |title=Treating prediabetes with metformin: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=363–9 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19366942 |pmc=2669003[/tpl]
A systematic review analysed children and adolescents with clinical insulin resistance or pre-diabetes. Four randomized controlled trials were identified. All compared the effect of 6 months of metformin plus or minus lifestyle intervention with placebo plus or minus lifestyle intervention. It was found that metformin improves markers of insulin sensitivity and reduces BMI.[tpl]cite journal|last=Quinn|first=SM|coauthors=Baur, LA; Garnett, SP; Cowell, CT|title=Treatment of clinical insulin resistance in children: a systematic review.|journal=Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity|date=Oct 2010|volume=11|issue=10|pages=722–30|pmid=20003069[/tpl]

===Polycystic ovary syndrome===

Antidiabetic therapy has been proposed as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Kidson W |title=Polycystic ovary syndrome: a new direction in treatment |journal=Med J Aust |volume=169 |issue=10 |pages=537–40 |year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9861912 |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/nov16/kidson/kidson.html[/tpl] The use of metformin in PCOS was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Velazquez EM, Mendoza S, Hamer T, Sosa F, Glueck CJ |title=Metformin therapy in polycystic ovary syndrome reduces hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, hyperandrogenemia, and systolic blood pressure, while facilitating normal menses and pregnancy |journal=Metab Clin Exp |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=647–54 |year=1994 |month=May |pmid=8177055[/tpl][tpl]vcite book |author=Teede H |editor=Kovács GT, Norman RW |chapter=Insulin sensitizers in polycystic ovary syndrome |title=Polycystic ovary syndrome |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2007 |pages=65–81 |isbn=0-521-84849-0[/tpl] The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies have failed to produce results.[tpl]vcite book| author=National Collaborating Centre for Women’s and Children's Health | title=Fertility: assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems | location=London | publisher = Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists | year=2004 | isbn=1-900364-97-2 | pages=58–9 | url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg011fullguideline.pdf | format=pdf [/tpl] However, two clinical studies completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with metformin being no better than placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination no better than clomifene alone.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Legro RS, Barnhart HX, Schlaff WD, et al. |author.= |title=Clomiphene, metformin, or both for infertility in the polycystic ovary syndrome |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=356 |issue=6 |pages=551–66 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17287476 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa063971 |url=[/tpl][tpl]vcite journal |author=Moll E, Bossuyt PM, Korevaar JC, Lambalk CB, van der Veen F |title=Effect of clomifene citrate plus metformin and clomifene citrate plus placebo on induction of ovulation in women with newly diagnosed polycystic ovary syndrome: randomised double blind clinical trial |journal=BMJ |volume=332 |issue=7556 |pages=1485 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16769748 |pmc=1482338 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38867.631551.55 |url=[/tpl] Reflecting this, subsequent reviews noted large randomized controlled trials have, in general, not shown the promise suggested by the early small studies.

In a dissenting opinion, a systematic review of four head-to-head comparative trials of metformin and clomifene found them equally effective for infertility.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Palomba S, Pasquali R, Orio F, Nestler JE |title=Clomiphene citrate, metformin or both as first-step approach in treating anovulatory infertility in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): a systematic review of head-to-head randomized controlled studies and meta-analysis |journal=Clin.

Therefore, the role of metformin in improving reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS appears to be limited.[tpl]cite journal|last=Tang|first=T|coauthors=Lord, JM; Norman, RJ; Yasmin, E; Balen, AH|title=Insulin-sensitising drugs (metformin, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, D-chiro-inositol) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome, oligo amenorrhoea and subfertility.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=May 16, 2012|volume=5|pages=CD003053|pmid=22592687[/tpl] However, in a recent multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, metformin increased live-birth rates compared to placebo  with the most beneficial effect seen in obese women. These results are consistent with another study that evaluated pretreatment with metformin for 3 months before in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). Although the role of metformin for ovulation induction in PCOS has been limited, these results suggest that metformin may play an important role in improving live birth rates when administered 3 months prior to and concurrent with standard infertility treatments.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sirmans|first=Susan|coauthors=Pate, Kirsten|title=Epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of polycystic ovary syndrome|journal=Clinical Epidemiology|date=December 2013|pages=1|doi=10.2147/CLEP.S37559[/tpl]
The use of metformin throughout pregnancy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome reduces the rates of early pregnancy loss and preterm labor and protects against fetal growth restriction.

==Contraindications==

Metformin is contraindicated in people with any condition that could increase the risk of lactic acidosis, including kidney disorders (creatinine levels over 150 μmol/l (1.7 mg/dL),[tpl]vcite journal |author=Jones G, Macklin J, Alexander W |title=Contraindications to the use of metformin |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7379 |pages=4–5 |year=2003 |pmid=12511434 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7379.4 |pmc=1124930 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/326/7379/4[/tpl] although this is an arbitrary limit), lung disease and liver disease.

Metformin is recommended to be temporarily discontinued before any radiographic study involving iodinated contrast agents, (such as a contrast-enhanced CT scan or angiogram), as the contrast dye may temporarily impair kidney function, indirectly leading to lactic acidosis by causing retention of metformin in the body.Weir J (March 19, 1999).

==Adverse effects==

The most common adverse effect of metformin is gastrointestinal irritation, including diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting and increased flatulence; metformin is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal side effects than most other antidiabetic drugs.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Bolen S, Feldman L, Vassy J, et al. |author.= |title=Systematic review: comparative effectiveness and safety of oral medications for type 2 diabetes mellitus |journal=Ann Intern Med |volume=147 |issue=6 |pages=386–99 |year=2007 |pmid=17638715 |url=http://www.annals.org/content/147/6/386.long [/tpl] The most serious potential side effect of metformin use is lactic acidosis; this complication is very rare, and the vast majority of these cases seem to be related to comorbid conditions, such as impaired liver or kidney function, rather than to the metformin itself.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Khurana R, Malik IS |title=Metformin: safety in cardiac patients |journal=Heart |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=99–102 |year=2010 |pmid=19564648 |doi=10.1136/hrt.2009.173773 [/tpl]
Metformin has also been reported to decrease the blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone in people with hypothyroidism,[tpl]vcite journal |author=Vigersky RA, Filmore-Nassar A, Glass AR |title=Thyrotropin suppression by metformin |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=225–7 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16219720 |doi=10.1210/jc.2005-1210 |url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/91/1/225[/tpl] The clinical significance of this is still unknown.

In a clinical trial of 286 subjects, 53.2% of the 141 given immediate-release metformin reported diarrhea, versus 11.7% for placebo, and 25.5% reported nausea/vomiting, versus 8.3% for those on placebo.[tpl]vcite book |title=Drug Facts and Comparisons 2005 |year=2004 |month=October |publisher=Facts and Comparisons |location=St. Louis, Mo |isbn=1-57439-193-3 [/tpl]
Metformin was associated with a 4,27 significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal disturbances than placebo in 5 trials in women with poly cystic ovary syndrome.
Gastrointestinal upset can cause severe discomfort; it is most common when metformin is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1 to 1.7 grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually. Gastrointestinal upset after prolonged, steady use is less common.[tpl]citation needed | date=March 2011[/tpl]

===Vitamin B12 deficiency===

===Lactic acidosis===

The most serious potential adverse effect of biguanide use is lactic acidosis ("metformin-associated lactic acidosis" or MALA), the incidence for which is 9 per 100,000 person-years.[tpl]cite journal|author=Stang M, Wysowski D K, Butler-Jones D|title=Incidence of lactic acidosis in metformin users|journal=Diabetes Care|doi=10.2337/diacare.22.6.925| year=1999|volume=22|issue=6|pages=925–927|pmid=10372243[/tpl] Phenformin, another biguanide, was withdrawn from the market because of an increased risk of lactic acidosis (rate of 40-64 per 100,000 patient-years). However, metformin is safer than phenformin, and the risk of developing lactic acidosis is not increased by the medication as long as it is not prescribed to known high-risk groups.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Salpeter S, Greyber E, Pasternak G, Salpeter E |title=Risk of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis with metformin use in type 2 diabetes mellitus: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Arch Intern Med |volume=163 |issue=21 |pages=2594–602 |year=2003 |pmid=14638559 |doi=10.1001/archinte.163.21.2594 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/21/2594[/tpl]
Lactate uptake by the liver is diminished with metformin administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, a process that metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is simply cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by the kidneys, when their function is unimpaired), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs.[tpl]vcite book |author=Maharani U |editor=Papadakis MA, McPhee SJ |chapter=Chapter 27: Diabetes Mellitus & Hypoglycemia |title=CURRENT Medical Diagnosis and Treatment 2010 |edition=49th |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location= |year=2009 |pages=1092–93 |isbn=0-07-162444-9[/tpl] When there is impaired renal function, however, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, leading to increased levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acidosis due to a buildup of lactic acid. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication to its use. Common causes of increased lactic acid production include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure, and respiratory disease (due to inadequate oxygenation of tissues); the most common cause of impaired lactic acid excretion is kidney disease.[tpl]vcite book |author=Shu AD, Myers Jr MG, Shoelson SE |editor=Golan ED et al.

Metformin has also been suggested to increase production of lactate in the small intestine; this could potentially contribute to lactic acidosis in those with risk factors. However, the clinical significance of this is unknown, and the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is most commonly attributed to decreased hepatic uptake rather than increased intestinal production.[tpl]vcite book |author=Davis SN |editor=Brunton L, Lazo J, Parker K |title=Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics |edition=11th |year=2006 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-142280-2 |pages= |chapter=Chapter 60: Insulin, Oral Hypoglycemic Agents, and the Pharmacology of the Endocrine Pancreas[/tpl]

===Overdose===

The most common symptoms following overdose appear to include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, tachycardia, drowsiness, and, rarely, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The major potentially life-threatening complication of metformin overdose is lactic acidosis, which is due to lactate accumulation.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Dell'Aglio DM, Perino LJ, Kazzi Z, Abramson J, Schwartz MD, Morgan BW |title=Acute metformin overdose: examining serum pH, lactate level, and metformin concentrations in survivors versus nonsurvivors: a systematic review of the literature |journal=Ann Emerg Med |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=818–23 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=19556031 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2009.04.023[/tpl][tpl]vcite journal |author=Lacher M, Hermanns-Clausen M, Haeffner K, Brandis M, Pohl M |title=Severe metformin intoxication with lactic acidosis in an adolescent |journal=Eur J Pediatr |volume=164 |issue=6 |pages=362–5 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15729560 |doi=10.1007/s00431-005-1634-y[/tpl] Treatment of metformin overdose is generally supportive, as there is no specific antidote. Lactic acidosis is initially treated with sodium bicarbonate, although high doses are not recommended, as this may increase intracellular acidosis.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Teale KF, Devine A, Stewart H, Harper NJ |title=The management of metformin overdose |journal=Anaesthesia |volume=53 |issue=7 |pages=698–701 |year=1998 |month=July |pmid=9771180|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2044.1998.436-az0549.x[/tpl] Acidosis that does not respond to administration of sodium bicarbonate may require further management with standard hemodialysis or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration. In addition, due to metformin’s low molecular weight and lack of plasma protein binding, these techniques also have the benefit of efficiently removing metformin from blood plasma, preventing further lactate overproduction.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Harvey B, Hickman C, Hinson G, Ralph T, Mayer A |title=Severe lactic acidosis complicating metformin overdose successfully treated with high-volume venovenous hemofiltration and aggressive alkalinization |journal=Pediatr Crit Care Med |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=598–601 |year=2005 |pmid=16148825 |doi=10.1097/01.PCC.0000162451.47034.4F[/tpl][tpl]vcite journal |author=Guo PY, Storsley LJ, Finkle SN |title=Severe lactic acidosis treated with prolonged hemodialysis: recovery after massive overdoses of metformin |journal=Semin Dial |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=80–3 |year=2006 |pmid=16423187 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-139X.2006.00123.x[/tpl][tpl]vcite journal |author=Barrueto F, Meggs WJ, Barchman MJ |title=Clearance of metformin by hemofiltration in overdose |journal=J Toxicol Clin Toxicol |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=177–80 |year=2002 |pmid=12126190 |doi= 10.1081/CLT-120004407[/tpl]
Metformin may be quantitated in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma metformin concentrations are usually in a range of 1–4 mg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 40–120 mg/L in victims of acute overdosage, and 80–200 mg/L in fatalities. Chromatographic techniques are commonly employed.Liu A, Coleman SP. Determination of metformin in human plasma using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. J. Chrom.

===Interactions===

The H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine causes an increase in the plasma concentration of metformin, by reducing clearance of metformin by the kidneys;[tpl]vcite journal |author=Somogyi A, Stockley C, Keal J, Rolan P, Bochner F |title=Reduction of metformin renal tubular secretion by cimetidine in man |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=545–51 |year=1987 |month=May |pmid=3593625 |pmc=1386190[/tpl] both metformin and cimetidine are cleared from the body by tubular secretion, and both, particularly the cationic (positively charged) form of cimetidine, may compete for the same transport mechanism. A small double-blind, randomized study found the antibiotic cephalexin to also increase metformin concentrations by a similar mechanism;[tpl]vcite journal |author=Jayasagar G, Krishna Kumar M, Chandrasekhar K, Madhusudan Rao C, Madhusudan Rao Y |title=Effect of cephalexin on the pharmacokinetics of metformin in healthy human volunteers |journal=Drug Metabol Drug Interact |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=41–8 |year=2002 |pmid=12222753 [/tpl] theoretically, other cationic medications may produce the same effect.

==Mechanism of action==

Metformin decreases glucose production in the liver, increases insulin sensitivity and enhances peripheral glucose uptake. It doesn't stimulate secretion of endogenous insulin.
Metformin decreases hyperglycemia primarily by suppressing glucose production by the liver (hepatic gluconeogenesis).[tpl]vcite journal |author=Kirpichnikov D, McFarlane SI, Sowers JR |title=Metformin: an update |journal=Ann Intern Med |volume=137 |issue=1 |pages=25–33 |year=2002 |pmid=12093242 |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/137/1/25.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] The "average" person with type 2 diabetes has three times the normal rate of gluconeogenesis; metformin treatment reduces this by over one third.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Hundal R, Krssak M, Dufour S, Laurent D, Lebon V, Chandramouli V, Inzucchi S, Schumann W, Petersen K, Landau B, Shulman G |title=Mechanism by which metformin reduces glucose production in type 2 diabetes |journal=Diabetes |volume=49 |issue=12 |pages=2063–9 |year=2000 |pmid=11118008 |doi=10.2337/diabetes.49.12.2063 |url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/reprint/49/12/2063 |format=PDF |pmc=2995498[/tpl] The molecular mechanism of metformin is incompletely understood: inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I), activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of glucagon-induced elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and consequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA), and an effect on gut microbiota have been proposed as potential mechanisms.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rena G, Pearson ER, Sakamoto K | title = Molecular mechanism of action of metformin: old or new insights? | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 56 | issue = 9 | pages = 1898–906 |date=September 2013  | pmid = 23835523 | pmc = 3737434 | doi = 10.1007/s00125-013-2991-0  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Burcelin R | title = The antidiabetic gutsy role of metformin uncovered? | journal = Gut | volume = | issue = | pages = |date=July 2013  | pmid = 23840042 | doi = 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-305370  [/tpl]

More recent studies using mouse models in
which the genes for AMPKα1 and α2 catalytic subunits (Prkaa1/2) or LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, had been knocked out in hepatocytes have raised doubts over the obligatory role of AMPK, since the effect of metformin was not abolished by loss of AMPK function. 
The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain; however, research suggests that metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic AMP (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/ATP).[tpl]vcite journal |author=Zhang L, He H, Balschi JA |title=Metformin and phenformin activate AMP-activated protein kinase in the heart by increasing cytosolic AMP concentration |journal=Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol |volume=293 |issue=1 |pages=H457–66 |year=2007 |pmid=17369473 |url=http://ajpheart.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/293/1/H457 |doi=10.1152/ajpheart.00002.2007[/tpl] Increased cellular AMP has also been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon-induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. Metformin and other biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels.Miller RA, Chu Q, Xie J, Foretz M, Viollet B, Birnbaum MJ. Biguanides suppress hepatic glucagon signalling by decreasing production of cyclic AMP. Nature. 2013 Feb 14;494(7436):256-60. doi: 10.1038/nature11808. Epub 2013 Jan 6. PMID 23292513 Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice and it has also been proposed that this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion.
In addition to suppressing hepatic glucose production, metformin increases insulin sensitivity, enhances peripheral glucose uptake (by inducing the phosphorylation of GLUT4 enhancer factor), decreases insulin-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation,[tpl]vcite journal |author=Collier CA, Bruce CR, Smith AC, Lopaschuk G, Dyck DJ |title=Metformin counters the insulin-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation and stimulation of triacylglycerol storage in rodent skeletal muscle |journal=Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab |volume=291 |issue=1 |pages=E182–E189 |year=2006 |pmid=16478780 |doi=10.1152/ajpendo.00272.2005 |url=http://ajpendo.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/291/1/E182[/tpl] and decreases absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract. Increased peripheral utilization of glucose may be due to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Bailey CJ, Turner RC |title=Metformin |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=334 |issue=9 |pages=574–9 |year=1996 |pmid=8569826 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199602293340906[/tpl] The increase in insulin binding after metformin treatment has also been demonstrated in patients with NIDDM [tpl]vcite journal |author=Fantus IG, Brosseau R |title=Mechanism of action of metformin: insulin receptor and postreceptor effects in vitro and in vivo |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=898-905 |year=1986[/tpl]. AMPK probably also plays a role, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Musi N, Hirshman MF, Nygren J, et al. |author.= |year=2002 |title=Metformin increases AMP-activated protein kinase activity in skeletal muscle of subjects with type 2 diabetes |journal=Diabetes |volume=51 |issue=7 |pages=2074–81 |pmid=12086935 |url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/51/7/2074 |doi=10.2337/diabetes.51.7.2074[/tpl] AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms; a 2008 study found "the metabolic actions of metformin in the heart muscle can occur independent of changes in AMPK activity and may be mediated by p38 MAPK- and PKC-dependent mechanisms."[tpl]vcite journal |author=Saeedi R, Parsons HL, Wambolt RB, et al. |author.= |year=2008 |title=Metabolic actions of metformin in the heart can occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms |journal=Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol |volume=294 |issue=6 |pages=H2497–506 |pmid=18375721 |doi=10.1152/ajpheart.00873.2007 |url=http://ajpheart.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/294/6/H2497[/tpl]

==Chemistry==

The usual synthesis of metformin, originally described in 1922 and reproduced in multiple later patents and publications, involves the reaction of dimethylamine hydrochloride and 2-cyanoguanidine (dicyandiamide) with heating.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Shapiro SL, Parrino VA, Freedman L |title=Hypoglycemic Agents. I Chemical Properties of β-Phenethylbiguanide. A New Hypoglycemic Agent |journal=J Am Chem Soc |volume=81 |issue=9 |year=1959 |pages=2220–5 |doi=10.1021/ja01518a052[/tpl]
According to the procedure described in the 1975 Aron patent,[tpl]vcite journal |title=Procédé de préparation de chlorhydrate de diméthylbiguanide |journal=Patent FR 2322860|language=French|year=1975[/tpl] and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia,[tpl]vcite book |title=Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia (Sittig's Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia) |edition=3rd |volume=3 |publisher=William Andrew |location=Norwich, NY |year=2007 |pages=2208 |isbn=0-8155-1526-X[/tpl] equimolar amounts of dimethylamine and 2-cyanoguanidine are dissolved in toluene with cooling to make a concentrated solution, and an equimolar amount of hydrogen chloride is slowly added. The mixture begins to boil on its own, and after cooling, metformin hydrochloride precipitates with a 96% yield.

==Structure==

The structure of metformin was generally represented in a wrong tautomeric form for a number of years. This was corrected in 2005.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Bharatam PV, Patel DS, Iqbal P, |title=Pharmacophoric Features of Biguanide Derivatives: An Electronic and Structural Analysis |journal=J Med Chem |issue=24 |volume=48 |year=2005 |pages=7615–7622 |doi=10.1021/jm050602z[/tpl] The energy difference between the correct tautomer and the generally represented tautomer is about 37 kJ/mol (9 kcal/mol). The drug is administered as metformin hydrochloride. The structure of the metformin hydrochloride was also corrected recently.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Patel DS, Bharatam PV |title=Novel N(L)2 species with two lone pairs on nitrogen: systems isoelectronic to carbodicarbenes |journal=Chem Commun |issue=9 |year=2009 |pages=1064–6 |doi=10.1039/b816595e[/tpl] According to these studies, the metformin has different electronic structure compared to its protonated form. The neutral species is a simple conjugated system. Upon protonation, (i) the conjugation breaks down, (ii) the intramolecular hydrogen bond breaks down, (iii) the molecule becomes non-planar (iv) two lone pairs get accumulated at the central nitrogen (v) dynamism increases in the system via C=N rotational process and via N-inversion process. Thus, electronically, metformin hydrochloride should be treated as a simple extension of metformin. The nucleophilicity of metformin hydrochloride is moderate and that is a desired property. Metformin is shown to belong to a new class of compounds called nitreones.

==Pharmacokinetics==

Metformin has an oral bioavailability of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and is absorbed slowly.[tpl]vcite web |author=Bristol-Myers Squibb |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/020357s031,021202s016lbl.pdf |title=Glucophage (metformin hydrochloride tablets) Label Information |year=August 27, 2008 |accessdate=2009-12-08 |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration[/tpl][tpl]vcite journal |author=Heller JB |title=Metformin overdose in dogs and cats |journal=Veterinary Medicine |issue=April |year=2007 |pages=231–233 |url=http://www.aspca.org/site/DocServer/vetm0407_231-234.pdf?docID=11061 [/tpl] Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached within one to three hours of taking immediate-release metformin and four to eight hours with extended-release formulations. The plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible, as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution (300–1000 L after a single dose). Steady state is usually reached in one or two days.
Metformin has acid dissociation constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5 and, therefore, exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin acid dissociation constant values (pKa) make metformin a stronger base than most other basic drugs with less than 0.01% unionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the unionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value of the distribution coefficient of the unionized form between octanol and water of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin (-0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently being investigated with the aim of producing prodrugs with better oral absorption than metformin itself.Garry G.

Metformin is not metabolized. It is cleared from the body by tubular secretion and excreted unchanged in the urine; metformin is undetectable in blood plasma within 24 hours of a single oral dose. The average elimination half-life in plasma is 6.2 hours. Metformin is distributed to (and appears to accumulate in) red blood cells, with a much longer elimination half-life: 17.6 hours (reported as ranging from 18.5 to 31.5 hours in a single-dose study of non-diabetic people).[tpl]vcite journal |author=Robert F, Fendri S, Hary L, Lacroix C, Andréjak M, Lalau JD |title=Kinetics of plasma and erythrocyte metformin after acute administration in healthy subjects |journal=Diabetes Metab |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=279–83 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12909816 |url=http://www.em-consulte.com/article/80210[/tpl]

==History==

The biguanide class of antidiabetic drugs, which also includes the withdrawn agents phenformin and buformin, originates from the French lilac or goat's rue (Galega officinalis), a plant used in folk medicine for several centuries.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Witters L |title=The blooming of the French lilac |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=108 |issue=8 |pages=1105–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11602616 |doi=10.1172/JCI14178 |pmc=209536 |url=http://www.jci.org/articles/view/14178[/tpl]
Metformin was first described in the scientific literature in 1922, by Emil Werner and James Bell, as a product in the synthesis of N,N-dimethylguanidine.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Werner E, Bell J |title=The preparation of methylguanidine, and of ββ-dimethylguanidine by the interaction of dicyanodiamide, and methylammonium and dimethylammonium chlorides respectively |journal=J Chem Soc, Transactions |volume=121|pages=1790–5 |year=1921 |doi=10.1039/CT9222101790[/tpl] In 1929, Slotta and Tschesche discovered its sugar-lowering action in rabbits, noting it was the most potent of the biguanide analogs they studied.See Chemical Abstracts, v.23, 42772 (1929) [tpl]vcite journal |author=K.

Interest in metformin, however, picked up at the end of the 1940s. In 1950, metformin, unlike some other similar compounds, was found not to decrease blood pressure and heart rate in animals.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Dawes GS, Mott JC |title=Circulatory and respiratory reflexes caused by aromatic guanidines |journal=Br J Pharmacol Chemother |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=65–76 |year=1950 |month=March |pmid=15405470 |pmc=1509951 |doi= |url=[/tpl] That same year, a prominent Philippine physician, Eusebio Y.

While training at the Hôpital de la Pitié, French diabetologist Jean Sterne studied the antihyperglycemic properties of galegine, an alkaloid isolated from Galega officinalis, which is related in structure to metformin and had seen brief use as an antidiabetic before the synthalins were developed.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Bailey CJ, Day C |title=Metformin: its botanical background |journal=Practical Diabetes International |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=115–7 |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/pdi.606 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/108564133/HTMLSTART[/tpl] Later, working at Laboratoires Aron in Paris, he was prompted by Garcia's report to reinvestigate the blood sugar lowering activity of metformin and several biguanide analogs. Sterne was the first to try metformin on humans for the treatment of diabetes; he coined the name "Glucophage" (glucose eater) for the drug and published his results in 1957.
Metformin became available in the British National Formulary in 1958. It was sold in the UK by a small Aron subsidiary called Rona.

==Formulations==

Metformin is sold under several trade names, including Glucophage XR, Carbophage SR, Riomet, Fortamet, Glumetza, Obimet, Gluformin, Dianben, Diabex, Diaformin, Siofor and Metfogamma.
The liquid metformin is sold under the name Riomet. Each 5 ml of Riomet is equivalent to the 500 mg tablet form of metformin.http://www.rxwiki.com/Metformin 
Metformin IR (immediate release) is available in 500 mg, 850 mg, and 1000 mg tablets.  All of these are now available as generic drugs in the U.S.
Metformin SR (slow release) or XR (extended release) was introduced in 2004. It is available in 500 mg, 750 mg and 1000 mg strengths, mainly to counteract the most common gastrointestinal side effects, as well as to increase compliance by reducing pill burden. No difference in effectiveness exists between the two preparations.

===Combinations with other drugs===

When used for type 2 diabetes, metformin is often prescribed in combination with other drugs. Several are available as fixed-dose combinations, also with the purpose of reducing pill burden and making administration simpler and more convenient.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Bailey CJ, Day C |title=Fixed-dose single tablet antidiabetic combinations |journal=Diabetes Obes Metab |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=527–33 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19175373 |doi=10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00993.x[/tpl]
As of 2009, the most popular brand-name combination was metformin with rosiglitazone, sold as Avandamet by GlaxoSmithKline since 2002.[tpl]cite press release |title=FDA Approves GlaxoSmithKline's Avandamet (rosiglitazone maleate and metformin HCl), The Latest Advancement in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes |publisher=GlaxoSmithKline |date=October 12, 2002 |accessdate=2006-12-27 |url=http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/news/8525697700573E1885256C4F0075B2B3[/tpl][tpl]PDFlink|2009 Top 200 branded drugs by total prescriptions|96.5 KB[/tpl]. Drug Topics (June 17, 2010). Retrieved September 2, 2010. Rosiglitazone actively makes cells more sensitive to insulin, complementing the action of the metformin. In 2005, all current stock of Avandamet was seized by the FDA and removed from the market, after inspections showed the factory where it was produced was violating good manufacturing practices.[tpl]cite press release |title=Questions and Answers about the Seizure of Paxil CR and Avandamet |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=March 4, 2005 |accessdate=2006-12-27 |url=http://www.fda.gov/oc/qanda/PaxilandAvandamet.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071014014507/http://www.fda.gov/oc/qanda/PaxilandAvandamet.html |archivedate=October 14, 2007[/tpl] The drug pair continued to be prescribed separately in the absence of Avandamet, which was available again by the end of that year.
In the United States, metformin is also available in combination with pioglitazone (trade name Actoplus Met), the sulfonylureas glipizide (trade name Metaglip) and glibenclamide (known as glyburide in the United States, trade name Glucovance), the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin (with the combination sold under the trade name Janumet), the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor saxagliptin (with the combination sold under the trade name Kombiglyze XR), and the meglitinide repaglinide (PrandiMet). Generic formulations of metformin/glipizide and metformin/glibenclamide are available (the latter being more popular). A generic formulation of metformin/rosiglitazone from Teva has received tentative approval from the FDA, and is expected to reach the market in early 2012.[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/inPlayBriefing/idUSIN20070927170530TEVA20070927 |title=Teva Pharm announces settlement of generic Avandia, Avandamet, and Avandaryl litigation with GlaxoSmithKline |publisher=Reuters |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=2009-02-17[/tpl]

==Research==

There is tentative evidence that metformin may decrease the risk of cancer.[tpl]cite journal|last=Malek|first=M|coauthors=Aghili, R; Emami, Z; Khamseh, ME|title=Risk of Cancer in Diabetes: The Effect of Metformin.|journal=ISRN endocrinology|year=2013|volume=2013|pages=636927|pmid=24224094|doi=10.1155/2013/636927[/tpl]
A direct action of metformin on cancer cells is suspected. Metformin exhibits a strong and consistent antiproliferative action on several cancer cell lines, including breast, colon, ovarian, pancreatic, lung and prostate cancer cells. These cellular studies were generally completed by preclinical studies showing a reliable antitumoral effect in various mouse models. In addition, the first clinical trials demonstrated a beneficial effect in breast and colon cancer.[tpl]vcite journal |author= Ben Sahra I, Le Marchand Brustel Y, Tanti JF, Bost F |title=Metformin in cancer therapy: a new perspective for an old antidiabetic drug?|journal=Mol Cancer Therapeutics|volume=9 |issue=5|pages=1092–99|year=2010|month=May |pmid=20442309 | doi=10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-1186[/tpl]
Metformin appears to be effective and safe for the treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), particularly for overweight or obese women, to immediate pregnancy outcomes. However, patients with multiple risk factors for insulin resistance may not meet their treatment goals with metformin alone and may require supplementary insulin. Evidence suggests that there are potential advantages for the use of metformin over insulin in gestational diabetes mellitus with respect to maternal weight gain and neonatal outcomes.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lautatzis|first=ME|coauthors=Goulis, DG; Vrontakis, M|title=Efficacy and safety of metformin during pregnancy in women with gestational diabetes mellitus or polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review.|journal=Metabolism: clinical and experimental|date=Nov 2013|volume=62|issue=11|pages=1522–34|doi=10.1016/j.metabol.2013.06.006|pmid=23886298|accessdate=3 April 2014[/tpl]  Nonetheless, several concerns have been raised regarding studies published thus far, and evidence on the long-term safety of metformin for both mother and child is still lacking.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Cheung NW |title=The management of gestational diabetes |journal=Vasc Health Risk Manag |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=153–64 |year=2009 |pmid=19436673 |pmc=2672462 |url=http://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=4160 |format=pdf[/tpl]
