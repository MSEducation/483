[[Antipyretic]]

CATEGORIES: Antipyretics

Antipyretics [tpl]IPA|/ænti.paɪˈrɛ.tɪks/[/tpl]; an-tee-pahy-ret-iks; from the Greek anti, against, and pyreticus, pertaining to fever, are drugs or herbs that reduce fever.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antipyretic |title=Definition of antipyretic|accessdate=2007-12-19 |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary[/tpl]  Antipyretics cause the hypothalamus to override an interleukin-induced increase in temperature. The body then works to lower the temperature, resulting in a reduction in fever.
Most antipyretic medications have other purposes. The most common antipyretics in the United States are ibuprofen and aspirin, which are used primarily as pain relievers. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and pain relievers.
There is some debate over the appropriate use of such medications, as fever is part of the body's immune response to infection.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fever/ID00052 |title=Mayo Clinic[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003090.htm |title=Medline Plus[/tpl] A study published by the Royal Society claims fever suppression causes at least 1% more influenza cases, resulting in at least 700 extra deaths per year in the United States alone.[tpl]cite news|last=Kupferschmidt|first=Kai|title=Fight the Flu, Hurt Society?|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/health/2014/01/fight-flu-hurt-society|newspaper=ScienceNow|date=2014-01-21[/tpl]

==Non-pharmacological treatment==

Bathing or sponging with lukewarm or cool water can effectively reduce body temperature in those with heat illness but not usually in those with fever.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=pedi_id/19036&source=preview&selectedTitle=10~150&anchor=H19#H19 |title=UpToDate Inc |work= |accessdate=[/tpl] The use of alcohol baths is not an appropriate cooling method, because there have been reported adverse events associated with systemic absorption of alcohol.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1542/peds.2010-3852[/tpl]

==Medications==

Many medications have antipyretic effects and thus are useful for fever but not heat illness, including:

===Plants===

Traditional use of higher plants with antipyretic properties is a common worldwide feature of many ethnobotanical cultural systems. In ethnobotany, plants with naturally occurring antipyretic properties are commonly referred to as febrifuges.Schultes, R.E.; Raffauf, R.F.

===In children===

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notes that improper dosing is one of the biggest problems in giving acetaminophen (paracetamol) to children.Reducing Fever in Children: Safe Use of Acetaminophen The effectiveness of acetaminophen alone as an antipyretic in children is uncertain, with some evidence showing it is no better than physical methods.[tpl]cite journal |author=Meremikwu M, Oyo-Ita A |title=Paracetamol for treating fever in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD003676 |year=2002 |pmid=12076499 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003676 |quote=Trial evidence that paracetamol has a superior antipyretic effect than placebo is inconclusive. |editor1-last=Meremikwu |editor1-first=Martin M[/tpl] Therapies involving alternating doses of acetaminophen and ibuprofen have shown greater antipyretic effect than either drug alone.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpedi.160.2.197 |author=E. Michael Sarrell, MD; Eliahu Wielunsky, MD; Herman Avner Cohen, MD |title=Antipyretic treatment in young children with fever: acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or both alternating in a randomized, double-blind study |journal=Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine |volume=160 |issue=2 |pages=197–202 |year=2006 |pmid=16461878 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/160/2/197 | accessdate=2010-09-25[/tpl] One meta-analysis indicated that ibuprofen is more effective than acetaminophen in children at similar doses when both are given alone.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kauffman|first=Ralph|author2=Sawyer, L.A.|author3=Scheinbaum, M.L.|year=1992|title=Antipyretic Efficacy of Ibuprofen vs Acetaminophen|journal=Am J Dis Child.|volume=146|issue=5|pages=622–625|url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/146/5/622[/tpl] 
Due to concerns about Reye syndrome, the U.K. NHS,Reye's syndrome - Prevention the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Surgeon General, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend that aspirin and combination products containing aspirin not be given to children or teenagers during episodes of fever-causing illnesses.CDC Study Shows Sharp Decline in Reye's Syndrome among U.S. Children However, the decreased use of Aspirin with the converse increased use of Acetaminophen/Paracetamol has been linked to the increase in asthma and other autoimmune disorders by several studies. Physicians recommending Acetaminophen/Paracetamol should use caution and be especially attentive to any genetic or environmental predisposition to asthma or other autoimmune disorders.[tpl]cite pmid|9809499[/tpl]
