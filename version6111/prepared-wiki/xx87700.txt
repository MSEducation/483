Freight lines run to the south of the station. The closest are used by V/Line to reverse empty trains from Traralgon and Bairnsdale line services, while the ones further south are used by a variety of standard gauge freight operators. The lines to the east join Melbourne Yard while those to the west are the South Kensington-West Footscray line that leads to either South Dynon or West Footscray via the Bunbury Street tunnel.
Private sidings formerly provided around South Kensington have now all closed. These included one to a large wool store to the north east (now demolished), one to a warehouse and silos the east (open but no longer served by rail), and two sidings to the north serving the Melbourne City Council abattoirs and Kenstore, a military warehouse complex opened during World War II.
The current configuration of the station dates from November 1976 when the line between South Kensington and Footscray was quadruplicated.
As part of the Regional Rail Link project, the V/Line tracks closest to the station were replaced in December 2013 by a pair of tracks that carry regional trains into Southern Cross.
