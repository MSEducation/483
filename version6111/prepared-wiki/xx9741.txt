Lemurs, lorises, tarsiers, and New World monkeys rely on olfactory signals for many aspects of social and reproductive behavior. Specialized glands are used to mark territories with pheromones, which are detected by the vomeronasal organ; this process forms a large part of the communication behavior of these primates. In Old World monkeys and apes this ability is mostly vestigial, having regressed as trichromatic eyes evolved to become the main sensory organ.[tpl]cite journal |title=Relaxed selective pressure on an essential component of pheromone transduction in primate evolution |author=Liman, E.

===Life history===

Primates have slower rates of development than other mammals. All primate infants are breastfed by their mothers (with the exception of some human cultures and various zoo raised primates which are fed formula) and rely on them for grooming and transportation. In some species, infants are protected and transported by males in the group, particularly males who may be their fathers. Other relatives of the infant, such as siblings and aunts, may participate in its care as well. Most primate mothers cease ovulation while breastfeeding an infant; once the infant is weaned the mother can reproduce again. This often leads to weaning conflict with infants who attempt to continue breastfeeding.
Infanticide is common in polygynous species such as gray langurs and gorillas. Adult males may kill dependent offspring that are not theirs so the female will return to estrus and thus they can sire offspring of their own. Social monogamy in some species may have evolved to combat this behavior.[tpl]cite journal|author=Opie, Christopher; Atkinson, Quentin D.; Dunbarc, Robin I. M.; Shultz, Susanne|year=2013|title=Male infanticide leads to social monogamy in primates|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|doi=10.1073/pnas.1307903110|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/33/13328.full[/tpl] Promiscuity may also lessen the risk of infanticide since paternity becomes uncertain.[tpl]cite journal|author=De Ruiter, Jan R.; Van Hooff, Jan A.

Primates have a longer juvenile period between weaning and sexual maturity than other mammals of similar size. Some primates such as galagos and new world monkeys use tree-holes for nesting, and park juveniles in leafy patches while foraging. Other primates follow a strategy of "riding", i,e. carrying individuals on the body while feeding. Adults may construct and/or use nesting sites, sometimes accompanied by juveniles, for the purpose of resting, a behavior which has developed secondarily in the great apes.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Kappeler |first1=Peter M. |year=1998 |title=Nests, Tree Holes, and the Evolution of Primate Life Histories |journal=American Journal of Primatology |publisher=Wiley-Liss, Inc. |volume= |issue=46 |pages=7–33 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/%28SICI%291098-2345%281998%2946:1%3C7::AID-AJP3%3E3.0.CO;2-%23/abstract |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2345(1998)46:13.0.CO;2-# |accessdate=9 February 2012|format=abstract[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Ross |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1991 |title=Park or ride?

During the juvenile period, primates are more susceptible than adults to predation and starvation; they gain experience in feeding and avoiding predators during this time  They learn social and fighting skills, often through playing. Primates, especially females, have longer lifespans than other similarly sized mammals, this may be partially due to their slower metabolisms.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/humans-primates-burn-50-percent-fewer-calories-each-day-other-mammals-1539866 |title=Humans And Primates Burn 50 Percent Fewer Calories Each Day Than Other Mammals |last1=Mintz |first1=Zoe |date=14 January 2014 |website=www.ibtimes.com |publisher=IBT Media Inc. |accessdate=14 January 2014[/tpl] Late in life, female catarrhine primates appear to undergo a cessation of reproductive function known as menopause; other groups are less studied.[tpl]cite journal | author = Walker ML, Herndon JG | title = Menopause in nonhuman primates? | journal = Biology of Reproduction | volume = 79 | pages = 398–406 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18495681 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod.108.068536 | issue = 3 | pmc=2553520[/tpl]

===Diet, feeding and hunting===

Primates exploit a variety of food sources. It has been said that many characteristics of modern primates, including humans, derive from an early ancestor's practice of taking most of its food from the tropical canopy.[tpl]cite journal |last1 = Milton |first1 = K. |year=1993 |title = Diet and Primate Evolution |url=http://nature.berkeley.edu/miltonlab/pdfs/diet_primate_evolution.pdf |journal=Scientific American |volume=269 |issue=2 |pages=86–93 |pmid=8351513 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0893-86[/tpl] Most primates include fruit in their diets to obtain easily digested carbohydrates and lipids for energy. However, they require other foods, such as leaves or insects, for amino acids, vitamins and minerals. Primates in the suborder Strepsirrhini (non-tarsier prosimians) are able to synthesize vitamin C, like most other mammals, while primates of the suborder Haplorrhini (tarsiers, monkeys and apes) have lost this ability, and require the vitamin in their diet.[tpl]cite journal | title = Vitamin C biosynthesis in prosimians: Evidence for the anthropoid affinity of Tarsius | author = Pollock, J. I. & Mullin, R. J. | journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | year = 1986 | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–70 | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.1330730106 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/110488482/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 | pmid = 3113259[/tpl]
Many primates have anatomical specializations that enable them to exploit particular foods, such as fruit, leaves, gum or insects. For example, leaf eaters such as howler monkeys, black-and-white colobuses and sportive lemurs have extended digestive tracts which enable them to absorb nutrients from leaves that can be difficult to digest. Marmosets, which are gum eaters, have strong incisor teeth, enabling them to open tree bark to get to the gum, and claws rather than nails, enabling them to cling to trees while feeding. The aye-aye combines rodent-like teeth with a long, thin middle finger to fill the same ecological niche as a woodpecker. It taps on trees to find insect larvae, then gnaws holes in the wood and inserts its elongated middle finger to pull the larvae out.[tpl]cite journal |author=Milliken, G. W., Ward, J. P. & Erickson, C. J. |year=1991 |title=Independent digit control in foraging by the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) |journal=Folia Primatologica |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=219–224 |doi=10.1159/000156551 |pmid=1937286[/tpl] Some species have additional specializations. For example, the grey-cheeked mangabey has thick enamel on its teeth, enabling it to open hard fruits and seeds that other monkeys cannot. The gelada is the only primate species that feeds primarily on grass.[tpl]cite web |last=Hiller|first=C.|year=2000|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Theropithecus_gelada.html|title = Theropithecus gelada|accessdate=2008-08-08|work=Animal Diversity Web[/tpl]

====Hunting====

Tarsiers are the only extant obligate carnivorous primates, exclusively eating insects, crustaceans, small vertebrates and snakes (including venomous species).[tpl]cite book|title=Tarsiers Past, Present and Future|chapter=Introduction|author=Wright, P., Simmons, E. & Gursky, S.|editor=Wright, P., Simmons, E. & Gursky, S.|year=2003|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-3236-1|pages=1[/tpl] Capuchin monkeys can exploit many different types of plant matter, including fruit, leaves, flowers, buds, nectar and seeds, but also eat insects and other invertebrates, bird eggs, and small vertebrates such as birds, lizards, squirrels and bats.
The common chimpanzee has a varied diet that includes predation on other primate species, such as the western red colobus monkey.[tpl]cite book|title=Monkeys of the Taï Forest : an African primate community|chapter=Interactions between Red Colobus Monkeys and Chimpanzees|author=Bshary, R.|editor=McGraw, W., Zuberbuhler, K. & Noe, R.|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-81633-5|pages=155–170[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Chimpanzee and red colobus : the ecology of predator and prey|author=Stanford, C.|year=1998|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-00722-0|pages=130–138, 233[/tpl] This sometimes involves tool use. Common chimpanzees sharpen sticks to use as weapons when hunting mammals.  This is considered the first evidence of systematic use of weapons in a species other than humans.  Researchers documented 22 occasions where wild chimpanzees fashioned sticks into "spears" to hunt lesser bush babies (Galago senegalensis). In each case, a chimpanzee modified a branch by breaking off one or two ends and, frequently using its teeth, sharpened the stick. The tools, on average, were about 60 cm (24 in) long and 1.1 cm (0.4 in) in circumference. The chimpanzees then jabbed their spears into hollows in tree trunks where bush babies sleep. There was a single case in which a chimpanzee successfully extracted a bush baby with the tool. The bonobo is an omnivorous frugivore. The majority of its diet is fruit, but supplements its diet with leaves, meat from small vertebrates such as anomalures, flying squirrels and duikers,[tpl]cite journal |author=Ihobe H |title=Observations on the meat-eating behavior of wild bonobos (Pan paniscus) at Wamba, Republic of Zaire |journal=Primates |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=247–250|year=1992 |doi=10.1007/BF02382754[/tpl] and invertebrates.Rafert, J. and E.O.

===As prey===

Predators of primates include various species of carnivorans, birds of prey, reptiles and other primates. Even gorillas have been recorded as prey. Predators of primates have diverse hunting strategies and as such, primates have evolved several different antipredator adaptations including crypsis, alarm calls and mobbing. Several species have separate alarm calls for different predators such as air-borne or ground-dwelling predators. Predation may have shaped group size in primates as species exposed to higher predation pressures appear to live in larger groups.[tpl]cite book|author=Fichtel, Claudia|contribution=Predation|year=2012|title=The Evolution of Primate Societies|editor=Mitani, John C.; Call, Josep;  Kappeler, Peter M.; Palombit, Ryne A.; Silk, Joan B|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=169–84|isbn=0-226-53172-4[/tpl] With their technology and increased intelligence, modern humans are nearly free of threats from predators and are themselves apex predators.

===Tool use and manufacture===

====Tool use====

There are many reports of primates using tools, both in the wild or when captive. The use of tools by primates is varied and includes hunting (mammals, invertebrates, fish), collecting honey, processing food (nuts, fruits, vegetables and seeds), collecting water, weapons and shelter.
In 1960, Jane Goodall observed a chimpanzee poking pieces of grass into a termite mound and then raising the grass to his mouth. After he left, Goodall approached the mound and repeated the behaviour because she was unsure what the chimpanzee was doing. She found that the termites bit onto the grass with their jaws. The chimpanzee had been using the grass as a tool to “fish” or "dip" for termites.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.janegoodall.org/chimpanzees/tool-use-hunting-other-discoveries|title=Tool use, hunting & other discoveries|publisher=The Jane Goodall Institute|accessdate=Aug 1, 2013[/tpl] There are more limited reports of the closely related bonobo using tools in the wild; it has been claimed they rarely use tools in the wild although they use tools as readily as chimpanzees when in captivity,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clemetzoo.com/apetag/Bonobos.html|title=Bonobos|publisher=ApeTag|year=2010|accessdate=August 3, 2013[/tpl]  It has been reported that both female chimpanzees and bonobos use tools more avidly than males.Gruber, T., Clay, Z. and Zuberbühler, K., (2010). A comparison of bonobo and chimpanzee tool use: evidence for a female bias in the Pan lineage. Animal Behaviour, 80: 1023-1033.http://www.emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS/publications/articles/Gruber_etal_2010.pdf  Orangutans in Borneo scoop catfish out of small ponds.  Anthropologist Anne Russon saw several animals on these forested islands learn on their own to jab at catfish with sticks, so that the panicked prey would flop out of ponds and into the orangutan's waiting hands.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/04/orangutan-tools-fishing/|title=Orangutans use simple tools to catch fish|author=Bower, B.|year=2011|accessdate=August 5, 2013[/tpl] There are few reports of gorillas using tools in the wild.  An adult female Western lowland gorilla used a branch as a walking stick apparently to test water depth and to aid her in crossing a pool of water. Another adult female used a detached trunk from a small shrub as a stabilizer during food gathering, and another used a log as a bridge.Breuer, T., Ndoundou-Hockemba, M. and Fishlock, V., (2005). First observation of tool use in wild gorillas. PLoS Biol. Nov;3(11):e380 http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0030380
The black-striped capuchin was the first non-ape primate for which tool use was documented in the wild; individuals were observed cracking nuts by placing them on a stone anvil and hitting them with another large stone.Fragaszy, D., Izar, P., Visalberghi, E., Ottoni, E.B., de Oliveira, M.G., (2004). Wild capuchin monkeys (Cebus libidinosus) use anvils and stone pounding tools.  American Journal of Primatology, 64: 359–366. DOI: 10.1002/ajp.20085  In Thailand and Myanmar, crab-eating macaques use stone tools to open nuts, oysters and other bivalves, and various types of sea snails.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Gumert|first1=M.D.|last2=Kluck|first2=M.|last3=Malaivijitnond|first3=S.|title=The physical characteristics and usage patterns of stone axe and pounding hammers used by long-tailed macaques in the Andaman Sea region of Thailand|journal=American Journal of Primatology|year=2009|volume=71|pages=594–608|doi=10.1002/ajp.20694[/tpl] Chacma baboons use stones as weapons; stoning by these baboons is done from the rocky walls of the canyon where they sleep and retreat to when they are threatened. Stones are lifted with one hand and dropped over the side whereupon they tumble down the side of the cliff or fall directly to the canyon floor.Hamilton, W.J., Buskirk, R.E. and Buskirk, W.H., (1975). Defensive stoning by baboons. Nature, 256: 488-489. doi:10.1038/256488a0
Although they have not been observed to use tools in the wild, lemurs in controlled settings have been shown to be capable of understanding the functional properties of the objects they had been trained to use as tools, performing as well as tool-using haplorhines.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Fichtel | first1 = C. | last2 = Kappeler | first2 = P.

====Tool manufacture====

Tool manufacture is much rarer than simple tool use and probably represents higher cognitive functioning.  Soon after her initial discovery of tool use, Goodall observed other chimpanzees picking up leafy twigs, stripping off the leaves and using the stems to fish for insects. This change of a leafy twig into a tool was a major discovery.  Prior to this, scientists thought that only humans manufactured and used tools, and that this ability was what separated humans from other animals. Both bonobos and chimpanzees have also been observed making "sponges" out of leaves and moss that suck up water and are used as grooming tools.  Sumatran orangutans have been observed making and using tools. They will break off a tree branch that is about 30 cm long, snap off the twigs, fray one end and then use the stick to dig in tree holes for termites.[tpl]cite web|url=http://orangutanislands.com/sumatra-orangutans.htm|title=Sumatran orangutans|publisher=OrangutanIslands.com|accessdate=August 2, 2013[/tpl]van Schaik, C., Fox, E. and Sitompul, A., (1996). Manufacture and use of tools in wild Sumatran orangutans. Naturwissenschaften, 83: 186–188 In the wild, mandrills have been observed to clean their ears with modified tools. Scientists filmed a large male mandrill at Chester Zoo (UK) stripping down a twig, apparently to make it narrower, and then using the modified stick to scrape dirt from underneath its toenails.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/14227783 | title = Mandrill monkey makes 'pedicuring' tool | first = Victoria | last = Gill | publisher = BBC | date = 22 July 2011 | accessdate = 11 August 2013[/tpl] Captive gorillas have made a variety of tools.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/therevealed/comments/_zprava/488947|author=Vancatova, M.|title=Gorillas and Tools - Part I|year=2008|accessdate=August 4, 2013[/tpl]

==Habitat and distribution==

Primates evolved from arboreal animals, and many species live most of their lives in trees. Most primate species live in tropical rain forests. The number of primate species within tropical areas has been shown to be positively correlated to the amount of rainfall and the amount of rain forest area.[tpl]cite journal|title=Geographic and climatic control of primate diversity|author=Reed, K. & Fleagle, J.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=92|issue=17|pages=7874–7876|date=August 15, 1995|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/92/17/7874.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.17.7874|pmid=7644506|pmc=41248|bibcode = 1995PNAS...92.7874R [/tpl] Accounting for 25% to 40% of the fruit-eating animals (by weight) within tropical rainforests, primates play an important ecological role by dispersing seeds of many tree species.[tpl]cite book|title=Primates in Perspective|author=Chapman, C. & Russo, S.|chapter=Primate Seed Dispersal|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Campbell, C.

Some species are partially terrestrial, such as baboons and patas monkeys, and a few species are fully terrestrial, such as geladas and humans. Non-human primates live in a diverse number of forested habitats in the tropical latitudes of Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and South America, including rainforests, mangrove forests, and montane forests. There are some examples of non-human primates that live outside of the tropics; the mountain-dwelling Japanese macaque lives in the north of Honshū where there is snow-cover eight months of the year; the Barbary macaque lives in the Atlas Mountains of Algeria and Morocco. Primate habitats span a range of altitudes: the black snub-nosed monkey has been found living in the Hengduan Mountains at altitudes of 4,700 meters (15,400 ft),[tpl]cite journal | author = Long, Y.

==Interactions between humans and other primates==

Close interactions between humans and non-human primates (NHPs) can create pathways for the transmission of zoonotic diseases. Viruses such as Herpesviridae (most notably Herpes B Virus), Poxviridae, measles, ebola, rabies, the Marburg virus and viral hepatitis can be transmitted to humans; in some cases the viruses produce potentially fatal diseases in both humans and non-human primates.[tpl]cite journal | author=Renquist, D.

NHPs are kept in zoos around the globe. Historically, zoos were primarily a form of entertainment, but more recently have shifted their focus to conservation, education and research. Many zoos now feature naturalistic exhibits and educational material for the public; in the United States many participate in the Species Survival Plan (SSP), developed by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), to maximize genetic diversity through captive breeding. Zoos and other animal welfare supporters generally oppose animal rights initiatives and the GAP's insistence that all NHPs be released from captivity for two primary reasons. First, captive-born primates lack the knowledge and experience to survive in the wild if released. Second, zoos provide living space for primates and other animals threatened with extinction in the wild.

===Role in scientific research===

Thousands of non-human primates are used around the world in research because of their psychological and physiological similarity to humans.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chen, F. C. & Li, W.

NHPs are commonly used in preclinical trials, neuroscience, ophthalmology studies, and toxicity studies. Rhesus macaques are often used, as are other macaques, African green monkeys, chimpanzees, baboons, squirrel monkeys, and marmosets, both wild-caught and purpose-bred.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ebra.org/ebrabulletin-the-supply-and-use-of-primates-in-the-eu_17.htm |title=The supply and use of primates in the EU |publisher=European Biomedical Research Association |year=1996 |accessdate=2008-08-18[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Conlee, K.

===Conservation===

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists more than a third of primates as critically endangered or vulnerable. Trade is regulated, as all species are listed by CITES in Appendix II, except 50 species and subspecies listed in Appendix I, which gain full protection from trade.[tpl]cite book | author = IFAW | title = Born to be wild: Primates are not pets | publisher = International Fund for Animal Welfare | year = 2005 | url = http://www.ifaw.org/Publications/Program_Publications/Wildlife_Trade/Campaign_Scientific_Publications/asset_upload_file812_49478.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 2011-02-26 |authorlink=International Fund for Animal Welfare[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author = CITES | title = Appendices I, II and III | publisher = Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora | date = 2010-10-14 | url = http://www.cites.org/eng/app/index.php | accessdate = 2012-04-02 |authorlink=CITES[/tpl] Common threats to primate species include deforestation, forest fragmentation, monkey drives (resulting from primate crop raiding),[tpl]cite book |author=Grubb, P. |year=1998 |chapter=The Sierra Leone monkey drives |title=Mammals of Ghana, Sierra Leone, and the Gambia |location=St. Ives |publisher=Trendrine |pages=214–219 |isbn=0-9512562-4-6 |display-authors=1[/tpl] and primate hunting for use in medicines, as pets, and for food.

Primates with a large body size (over 5 kg) are at increased extinction risk due to their greater profitability to poachers compared to smaller primates. They reach sexual maturity later and have a longer period between births.
