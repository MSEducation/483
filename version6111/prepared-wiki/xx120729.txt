==History==

Campus Mellis rose probably over the ruins of Apiola, a very ancient Latin city, destroyed by Tarquinius Priscus, fifth king of Rome (579 BC); the ruins of Apiola are visible 6Â km away from the present-day historic center of Campodimele.
In the 6th century AD the Lombards established the first fortified settlement, while in the following century if was part of the possessions of the Monastery of Montecassino.
From 916 it was acquired by the Duchy of Gaeta. Campo de Melle is mentioned again in a donation by the Consul of Fondi in 1072. In 1087, Pope Victor III has a list of the abbey's property sculpted onto the bronze door of the Basilica of Montecassino. 
In 1384 it became a possession of the Caetani family of Fondi, but, in 1497, King Frederick IV of Naples gave the county of Fondi with the surrounding duchies, including Campodimele, to the Colonna family.
In 1534 Giulia Gonzaga fled her from the attempted capture by the Algerian pirate Hayreddin Barbarossa. In 1591 the fief was inherited by Luigi Carafa, Prince of Stigliano.
Campodimele gained municipal rights in  1813.
During World War II the Gustav Line passed from Campodimele. Alberto Moravia, who had been deported here, took inspiration from the happenings of the time for his novel La Ciociara.
