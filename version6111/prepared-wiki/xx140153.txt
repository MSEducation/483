==Vääna manor==

At this time, there was a fortified manor or a castle at the site, the remains of which were reconstructed and expanded in a romantic fashion during the 19th century but are still visible in the manor park. 
The present manor house was commissioned by the Baltic German von Stackelberg family and built 1784-1797. It was designed by an anonymous Italian architect in late baroque style. The wings of the long main house have circular pavilions with preserved decorated vaulted roofs, where formerly the family displayed their art collection, which reputedly held works by Hans Holbein, Nicolas Poussin, Claude Lorrain and Antoine Watteau . The main building also showcases some preserved architectural details, notably two painted ceilings as well as further, albeit later, architectural details.[tpl]cite book | last = Sakk | first = Ivar | authorlink = | title = Estonian Manors - A Travelogue | publisher = Sakk & Sakk OÜ | series = | volume = | edition = | date = 2004 | location = Tallinn | pages = 26-27 | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 9949-10-117-4 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = [/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Viirand| first = Tiiu| authorlink = | title = Estonia.

==Railroad line==

In 1913 a narrow-gauge, military-purpose railroad connecting Vääna and Tallinn was opened. Its initial purpose was supplying forts and defensive positions of Peter the Great's Naval Fortress, located in the vicinity of Vääna. In 1933 railroad was handed over to Estonian Railways and used for passenger transport, until the line was finally closed in 1959. There is still an old station building on the north-eastern edge of the village.
