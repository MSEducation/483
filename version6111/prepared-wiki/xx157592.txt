Barzillai Gannett (June 17, 1764 – 1832) was a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts.

Gannett was Selectman and assessor of Gardiner, Maine from 1803 to 1808.  He was appointed as the first postmaster of Gardiner and served from September 30, 1804, to October 1, 1809.  He also served as Town Moderator. Gannett served as member of both the Massachusetts House of Representatives and the Massachusetts State Senate.
