==Involvement in Foreign Exchange Ponzi Scheme==

In October 2008, Herbin Hoyos partnered with the Panamanian company FinanzasForex to open a fund to collect money for the kidnapped. The money would supposedly be invested in foreign exchange markets, with the proceeds going to the kidnapped to help them attain financial security upon their release.http://www.pnud.org.co/sitio.shtml%20?apc=a-b0200310--&x=55600http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFvf0Q1sp1g At that time, the Commissions of Securities of Panama and Spain had already issued warnings that Finanzasforex was not licensed to take deposits nor to trade in financial markets.http://www.allforexworld.com/Snaps/?Snap=CNMV-Warning-against-Finanzas-Forex Finanzasforex eventually collapsed when the banks stopped accepting money transfers to its accounts under suspicion of illegal activities. In March 2011, its founder German Cardona Soler was detained in Spain under accusations of money laundering and of operating a Ponzi scheme that defrauded at least 100,000 people in Europe, USA, and South America, including the people who had contributed to the kidnapped's fund.http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-25/-mini-madoff-arrested-in-300-million-suspected-ponzi-scheme.html
