Washington Dulles International Airport [tpl]Airport codes|IAD|KIAD|IAD[/tpl] is a public airport in Dulles, Virginia, 26 miles (42 km) west of downtown Washington, D.C.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metwashairports.com/dulles/208.htm|title=Dulles International Airport|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|accessdate=December 4, 2010[/tpl] The airport serves the Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia metropolitan area centered on the District of Columbia. It is named after John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State in the Eisenhower Administration. The Dulles main terminal is a well-known landmark designed by Eero Saarinen. Operated by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, Dulles Airport occupies [tpl]convert|11830|acre|km2[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Facts About Washington Dulles International Airport|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|url=http://www.metwashairports.com/dulles/663.htm|accessdate=June 3, 2011[/tpl] straddling the border of Fairfax County and Loudoun County, Virginia,[tpl]FAA-airport|ID=IAD|use=PU|own=PU|site=03002.*A[/tpl] within the unincorporated communities of  Chantilly and Dulles.
Washington Dulles Airport is the busiest airport in the Washington metropolitan area, and second busiest airport in the larger Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area (after BWI Airport) with over 22 million passengers a year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mwaa.com/dulles/653.htm|title=Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) Air Traffic Statistics|year=2011|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|accessdate=August 21, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/passenger_allcargo_stats/passenger/media/PrelimCY12CommercialServiceEnplanements.pdf|title=Preliminary CY 2012 Enplanements|year=2013|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|accessdate=August 27, 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] With nearly all of the international passenger traffic in the Washington-Baltimore region, Dulles is the busiest international airport in the Northeast outside of the New York metropolitan area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dot.gov/sites/dot.dev/files/docs/US%20International%20Air%20Passenger%20and%20Freight%20Statistics%20Report%20for%20Dec%202012.pdf |title=U.S. International Air Passenger and Freight Statistics Report |publisher=Office of the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, U.S. Department of Transportation |accessdate=November 16, 2013[/tpl] On a typical day, more than 60,000 passengers pass through Washington Dulles to and from more than 125 destinations around the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mwaa.com/dulles/872.htm |title=Air Service Maps – IAD|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|accessdate=December 4, 2010[/tpl]

==History==

===Origins===

At the end of World War II, growth in aviation and in the Washington metropolitan area led Congress to pass the Washington Airport Act of 1950, providing federal backing for a second airport. After preliminary proposals failed, including one to establish an international airport at what is now Burke Lake Park, the current site was selected by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1958. As a result of the selection, the unincorporated community of Willard, which once stood in the airport's current footprint, was demolished.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.loudounhistory.org/history/dulles-airport-history.htm|title=History of Dulles Airport|first=Eugene|last=Scheel|accessdate=September 12, 2010[/tpl]

===Design and original construction===

The civil engineering firm Ammann and Whitney was named lead contractor. The airport was dedicated by President John F. Kennedy on November 17, 1962. Its original name, Dulles International Airport, was changed in 1984 to Washington Dulles International Airport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metwashairports.com/dulles/661.htm|title=History of Washington Dulles International Airport|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|accessdate=December 4, 2010[/tpl] The main terminal was designed in 1958 by famed Finnish architect Eero Saarinen and it is highly regarded for its graceful beauty, suggestive of flight. In the 1990s, the main terminal at Dulles was reconfigured to allow more space between the front of the building and the ticket counters. Additions at both ends of the main terminal more than doubled the structure's length. The original terminal at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in Taoyuan, Taiwan was modeled after the Saarinen terminal at Dulles.
The design included a landscaped man-made lake to collect rainwater, a low-rise hotel, and a row of office buildings along the north side of the main parking lot. The design also included a two-level road in front of the terminal to separate arrival and departure traffic and a federally owned limited access highway connecting the terminal to the Capital Beltway (I-495) about [tpl]convert|17|mi[/tpl] to the east. (Eventually, the highway system grew to include a parallel toll road to handle commuter traffic and an extension to connect to I-66). The access road had a wide median strip to allow the construction of a passenger rail line, which will be in the form of an extension of the Washington Metro and is expected to be completed in 2018.

===Notable operations and milestones===

===Planned development===

By the 1980s, the original design, which had mobile lounges meet each plane, was no longer well-suited to Dulles' role as a hub airport. Instead, midfield concourses were added to allow passengers to walk between connecting flights without visiting the main terminal. Mobile lounges were still used for international flights and to transport passengers between the midfield concourses and the main terminal. An underground tunnel (consisting of a passenger walkway and moving sidewalks) which links the main terminal and concourse B was opened in 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mwaa.com/File/WalkwaytoAandB.pdf|format=PDF|title=Passenger Walkway to Concourses A and B Fact Sheet|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|year=2009|accessdate=October 12, 2010[/tpl] The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) began a renovation program for the airport including a new security mezzanine with more room for lines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mwaa.com/File/MainTerminal.pdf|format=PDF|title=Dulles Development: Main Terminal Improvement Fact Sheet|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|year=2009|accessdate=October 12, 2010[/tpl]
A new train system, dubbed AeroTrain and developed by Mitsubishi, began in 2010 to transport passengers between the concourses and the main terminal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mwaa.com/File/AeroTrainSystem.pdf|format=PDF|title=Aerotrain – Dulles Train System Fact Sheet|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|year=2009|accessdate=October 12, 2010[/tpl] The system, which uses rubber tires and travels along a fixed underground guideway, is similar to the people mover systems at Singapore Changi Airport, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and Denver International Airport. The train is intended to replace the mobile lounges, which many passengers found crowded and inconvenient. The initial phase includes the main terminal station, a permanent Concourse A station, a permanent Concourse B station, a permanent midfield concourse station (with access to the current temporary C concourse via a tunnel with moving walkways), and a maintenance facility. Mobile lounges continue to service the D Concourse from both the main terminal and the A Concourse. Mobile lounges will continue to transport international arrivals to the IAB facility. Dulles has stated that the wait time for a train does not exceed four minutes, compared to the average 15-minute wait and travel time for mobile lounges.
Under the development plan, future phases would see the addition of several new midfield concourses and a new south terminal.[tpl]cite news|first=Eric M.|last=Weiss|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/18/AR2008081801349.html|title=Dulles Updates Its People Movers|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 19, 2008|accessdate=October 12, 2010[/tpl] A fourth runway (parallel to the existing runways 1 and 19 L&R) opened in 2008,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mwaa.com/dulles/773.htm|title=D2 Projects: Fourth Runway|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority|year=2009|accessdate=October 12, 2010[/tpl] and development plans include a fifth runway to parallel the existing runway 12–30.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mwaa.com/dulles/771.htm|title=D2 Projects: Future Fifth Runway|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority|year=2009|accessdate=October 12, 2010[/tpl] An expansion of the B concourse, used by many low cost airlines as well as international arrivals, has been completed, and the Midfield Concourses C and D mainly house United Airlines, and will eventually be knocked down to make room for a more ergonomic building. Because Concourses C and D are temporary concourses, the only way to get to those concourses is via moving walkway from the Concourse C station which is built in the location of the future gates and Concourse D by mobile lounge from the main terminal.[tpl]cite news|first=Peggy|last=Fox|url=http://www.wusa9.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=96354|title=Dulles Airport To Open AeroTrain|work=9 News Now|publisher=WUSA|date=January 25, 2010|accessdate=October 12, 2010[/tpl]

==Statistics==

United Airlines maintains one of two East Coast hubs at Dulles which handled 56.7% of scheduled air carrier passengers at the airport. JetBlue handled 6.8% of scheduled air carrier passengers. American Airlines is the airport's third largest carrier in tickets sold and handled: 5.4%.[tpl]cite web|title=Total Passenters by Airline: January 2010 – December 2010|url=http://www.mwaa.com/file/dpsp1210ye.pdf|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|date=January 2011|accessdate=June 3, 2011[/tpl] In addition, 24 foreign carriers have service in and out of Washington Dulles. On a typical day, Dulles averages 1,000 to 1,200 flight operations.[tpl]cite web|title=Total Operations by Airline-May 2010 – April 2011|url=http://www.metwashairports.com/file/dpso411ye.pdf| publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|date=May 2011|accessdate=June 3, 2011[/tpl] Dulles International served 22.6 million passengers in 2012, a 2.8% decrease over 2011. However, international passenger traffic has increased by 2.0% during the same time.Washington's Airports Set Records for Passenger Growth. Mwaa.com (2013-02-20). Retrieved on 2013-08-16. Additional international service is commencing service at Washington Dulles. With 43 weekly flights, Dulles is now the second largest United States gateway to the Middle East. Even before the United States economic recession started, international passengers have continued to grow, which prompted the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority to expand the international arrivals building to handle 2,400 passengers per hour.

==Terminals==

The airport's terminal complex consists of a main terminal and two midfield terminal buildings: Concourses A/B and C/D. The entire terminal complex has 123 gates and 16 hardstand locations[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mwaa.com/dulles/663.htm|title=Facts About Washington Dulles International Airport|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|year=2010|accessdate=October 12, 2010[/tpl] from which passengers can board or disembark using the airport's plane mate vehicles.
Conceived in early planning sessions in 1959, Dulles is one of the few remaining airports to use the mobile lounge (also known as "plane mates" or "people movers") for boarding and disembarkation from aircraft, and to transfer passengers between the midfield concourses and to and from the main terminal building. They have all been given names based on the postal abbreviations of 50 states, e.g.: VA, MD, AK.[tpl]cite journal|magazine=Air Progress|date=August 1989|page=65|author=Nick Komons[/tpl]
The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority has begun to gradually phase out the mobile lounge system for inter-terminal passenger movements in favor of the AeroTrain, an underground people mover which currently operates to Concourses A, B and C, and a pedestrian walkway system (now in service to concourse A/B). The mobile lounges are still used to transport passengers directly from the main terminal to Concourse D. Plane mates also remain in use to disembark international passengers and carry them to the International Arrivals Building, as well as to convey passengers to and from aircraft on hard stand (i.e., those parked remotely on the apron without access to jet bridges).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/25/AR2006012500172.html|title=At Dulles, The Tarmac Is Their Turf|last=Aryanpur|first=Arianne|newspaper=The Washington Post|page=VA16|date=February 2, 2006|accessdate=September 1, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/13/AR2006091302157.html|title=Airport's Future Is on Rails|last=Miroff|first=Nick|newspaper=The Washington Post|page=B01|date=September 14, 2006|accessdate=September 1, 2008[/tpl]

===Main terminal===

The main terminal (which houses ticketing, baggage claim, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Z gates, and other support facilities) was recognized by the American Institute of Architects in 1966 for its design concept; its roof is a suspended catenary providing a wide enclosed area unimpeded by any columns. It houses ticketing, baggage claim, and information facilities, as well as the International Arrivals Building for passenger processing.
The main terminal was extended in 1996 to [tpl]convert|1240|ft|m[/tpl]—Saarinen's original design length—which was slightly more than double its originally constructed length of [tpl]convert|600|ft|m[/tpl]. In addition, an extension for international arrivals was added to the west of the main terminal in 1991. On September 22, 2009, an expansion of the international arrivals building opened which includes a [tpl]convert|41400|sqft|m2[/tpl] arrival hall for customs and immigration processing. The new facility has the capacity to process 2,400 arriving passengers per hour.[tpl]cite news|title=Elbow Room Expands for International Arrivals|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/21/AR2009092102703.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|first=Sholnn|last=Freeman|date=September 22, 2009|page=B2[/tpl]
In September 2009, a [tpl]convert|121700|sqft|m2[/tpl] central Transportation Security Administration checkpoint was added on a new security mezzanine level of the main terminal. This checkpoint replaced previous checkpoints located behind the ticketing areas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mwaa.com/file/pr2009_09_14.pdf|format=PDF|title=New Passenger Security Screening Areas Open at Dulles International Airport Tomorrow|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority Office of Public Affairs|date=September 14, 2009|accessdate=October 12, 2010[/tpl] A separate security checkpoint is available on the baggage claim level. Both security checkpoints connect to the new AeroTrain, which links the main terminal with the A, B, and C concourses.
There are two sets of gates in the main terminal: waiting areas for airlines which lack permanent physical gates and therefore use plane mates to reach planes parked at 16 hard-stand locations, which are referred to as the "H" Gates, and the "Z" Gates (with 4 gates), which provide service for US Airways.

===Midfield terminals===

There are two midfield terminal buildings at Washington Dulles: one contains the A and B midfield concourses, the other the C and D midfield concourses.
Concourse A (which has 47 gates) consists of a permanent ground level set of gates designed for small planes such as regional jets and several former B concourse gates.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mwaa.com/dulles/2540.htm|title=Aerotrain has Opened|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority|year=2010|accessdate=October 12, 2010[/tpl] Concourse B (which has 28 gates) is the first of the permanent elevated midfield concourses. Originally constructed in 1998 and designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, the B concourse contained 20 gates. In 2003, 4 additional gates were added to concourse B, followed by a 15-gate expansion in 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mwaa.com/file/conbexpansion.pdf|title=D2 Dulles Development: Concourse B Expansion|accessdate=March 12, 2013[/tpl] It is connected to the main terminal by an underground walkway in addition to the AeroTrain.
The C and D concourses (with each concourse containing 22 gates), completed in 1983 and designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum,[tpl]cite book|first=G. E.|last=Kidder Smith|title=Source Book of American Architecture: 500 Notable Buildings from the 10th Century to the Present|trans_title=Dulles Airport|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kM5H7TNRh2sC&pg=PA449&dq=dulles+hellmuth+skidmore&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2BPcT-TWHOGA2wX_o8TRDQ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=dulles%20hellmuth%20skidmore&f=false|accessdate=June 16, 2012|year=2000|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York|isbn=1-56898-254-2|page=449[/tpl] were originally designed as a temporary base for United Airlines, which began hub operations at the airport in 1985.[tpl]cite web|title=D2 Projects – Concourse C/D|url=http://www.mwaa.com/dulles/783.htm|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority|year=2011|accessdate=March 12, 2013[/tpl] The C/D concourses were given a face lift in 2006 which included light fixture upgrades, new paint finishes, new ceiling grids and tiles, heating and air conditioning replacement, and complete restroom renovations. This building also has a dedicated Federal Inspection Station ("FIS") for arriving United and certain Star Alliance-member airlines' international passengers to clear U.S. Customs prior to connecting to subsequent flights. Since this immigration facility is only for connecting passengers on United and its partners' flights, it has shorter lines and passengers don't have to clear security at the massive TSA checkpoint in the main terminal.
A new and permanent C/D concourse (also called "Tier 2") is planned as part of the D2 Dulles Development Project. The new building is to include a three-level structure with 44 airline gates and similar amenities to Concourse B. The concourse plan includes a dedicated mezzanine corridor with moving sidewalks to serve international passengers. The design and construction of the new C/D concourse has not been scheduled.

==Airlines and destinations==

===Passenger===

====Airline lounges====

Since many major domestic and international airlines have a large presence at Washington Dulles, there are several airline lounges in active operation there.

==Ground transportation==

===Roads===

Dulles is accessible via the Dulles Access Road/Dulles Greenway (State Route 267) and State Route 28. The Dulles Airport Access Highway (DAAH) is a toll-free, limited access, highway owned by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) to facilitate car access to Dulles from the Washington Capital Beltway and Interstate 66.[tpl]cite web|title=Dulles Toll Road|url=http://www.mwaa.com/tollroad/921.htm|publisher=mwaa.com|accessdate=June 3, 2011[/tpl] After it opened, non-airport traffic between Washington and Reston became so heavy that a parallel set of toll lanes were added on the same right-of-way to accommodate non-airport traffic (Dulles Toll Road). However, the airport-only lanes are both less congested as well as toll-free. As of November 1, 2008, MWAA assumed responsibility from the Virginia Department of Transportation both for operating the Dulles Toll Road and for the construction of a rapid transit rail line down its median. Route 28, which runs north–south along the eastern edge of the airport, has been upgraded to a limited access highway, with the interchanges financed through a property tax surcharge on nearby business properties. The Dulles Toll Road has been extended to the west to Leesburg as the Dulles Greenway.

===Mass transportation===

Loudoun County Transit provides a bus service which runs from the Dulles Town Center shopping center, to the airport, then to the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center Air and Space Museum.
Passengers connecting to the Shenandoah Valley can use the Shenandoah Valley Commuter Bus, which connects to the Vienna and Rosslyn Metro station. Taxis and SuperShuttle ride sharing vans are also available.
Fairfax Connector service to Dulles is through via route 981; from Tysons Corner to Reston then to Herndon.
[tpl]As of|2012[/tpl], the only Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority service to Dulles is the "Express" 5A Metrobus route. The 5A express bus makes two stops on its way from the airport to downtown Washington. Stops include the Herndon–Monroe park & ride lot in Herndon and the Rosslyn Metro station in Arlington. It terminates at the L'Enfant Plaza Metro station in Southwest DC. Both metro stations can be accessed by the Orange and Blue lines, while the latter can also be accessed by the Yellow and Green lines. The 950 Fairfax Connector bus brings passengers from Reston to the Herndon–Monroe transfer station, where they can switch to the 5A bus to the airport. The RIBS 2 Fairfax Connector bus also connects Reston passengers to the Herndon–Monroe transfer point. An alternative (but slightly more expensive)Washington Flyer bus is $10 one-way while the 5A Metrobus is $6 one-way.[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] way of reaching Dulles is the Washington Flyer Coach bus service that operates roughly every thirty minutes between the airport and the West Falls Church Metro station.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.toandfromtheairport.com/washington-dc.html#IAD|title=USA: Washington DC|publisher=To and From the Airport.com|year=2010|accessdate=October 12, 2010[/tpl]
