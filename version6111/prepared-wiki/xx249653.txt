CATEGORIES: Baloch tribes

Jagirani is  a Baloch tribe in  Balochistan and Sindh provinces of Pakistan. They mostly speak Balochi and Sindhi.

==History==

It has been stated[tpl]By whom|date=September 2010[/tpl] that the Balochs migrated from Aleppo, Northern Syria in the 2nd century after the Hijra. They started migrating to the south of the Caspian Sea and later settled in the mountainous regions of southeastern Iran and Makran (presently an area of the western Balochistan province of Pakistan). When the Balochs entered Makran from Iran, they settled in the village namely Buleda (now Buleda is a tehsil of District Turbat in the Makran division of Balochistan, Pakistan). At that time Balochs comprised about 40 sub-clans and  Mir Jalalan Khan Baloch was their chieftain (sardar). The son of Mir Jiand Khan Baloch the First, he is said to have been the Grand Ruler over all Balochs. He has a prestigious position among Balochs for being the ancestor of the most famous Baloch tribes − Bugti, Buledi, Bozdar, Jagirani, Jatoi, Khosa, Korai, Lashari, Magsi, Marri, Soomrani and Sundrani. After few decades Balochs started migrating from Buleda to central parts of Balochistan − presently the Kalat, Bolan and Kacchi areas. After few centuries, some groups of the tribe started moving to upper parts of Sindh − presently Jacobabad, Khairpur, Shahdadkot, and Qambar − and settled there permanently.

==Clans==

There are 7 sardars (chieftains) among Buledis, namely Sundrani , Hajija , Bijarani, Suhriani, Teghani, Pitafi and remaining Buledis in Buleda. Among all the seven groups, Sundrani is the largest clan of Buledis, commanding all the tribes on both sides of the border. Jagirani tribe falls into the clan of Sundrani which heads over 40 tribes. Nearly 90% of Jagiranis live in district Qambar/Shahdadkot, Larkana, Sukkur, Khairpur,Jacobabad, Shikarpur, Kandhkot, Ghotki  and some parts of Balochistan including Jhal Magsi. http://www.jagirani.com/
