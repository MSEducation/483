The pepperoni roll is a snack popular in West Virginia and some nearby regions of the Appalachian Mountains such as Western Pennsylvania, Western Maryland, and Appalachian Ohio. It is ubiquitous in West Virginia, particularly in convenience stores, and is arguably the food most closely associated with the state.[tpl]cite news |title=United Tastes - Pepperoni Rolls, a Piece of West Virginia Culinary History: Fast Food Even Before Fast Food |author=John T.

The classic pepperoni roll consists of a fairly soft white yeast bread roll with pepperoni baked in the middle. During baking, the fats in the pepperoni (which are hard at room temperature) melt, resulting in a spicy oil suffusing into the bread.[tpl]cite web | last=Heffner | first=Bob | title=What is a Pepperoni Roll? |work=The Pepperoni Roll Homepage | publisher=Bob Heffner | url=http://www.bobheffner.com/pepperoniroll/what.htm | accessdate=1 December 2009[/tpl] Pepperoni rolls are typically eaten as a snack or as the main dish of a lunch either unheated or slightly warmed.

==Origins==

The pepperoni roll was invented by Giuseppe "Joseph" Argiro at the Country Club Bakery in Fairmont, West Virginia, in 1927.[tpl]cite book | last=Mozier | first=Jeanne | title=Way Out in West Virginia: A Must Have Guide to the Oddities & Wonders of the Mountain | publisher=Quarrier Press | date=April 1999 | location=Charleston, WV | isbn=978-1-891852-02-2[/tpl]
The rolls originated as a lunch option for the coal miners of north-central West Virginia in the first half of the 20th century.[tpl]cite web | title=History of Pepperoni Rolls | publisher=Rogers & Mazzas Bakery / Marty's Italian Bakery | url=http://www.pepperonirolls.net/history.html | accessdate=2 December 2009[/tpl] Pepperoni rolls do not need to be refrigerated for storage and could readily be packed for lunch by miners.  Pepperoni and other Italian foods became popular in north-central West Virginia in the early 20th century, when the booming mines and railroads attracted many immigrants from Italy.  The pepperoni roll bears a resemblance to the pasty and sausage roll, which originated in the mining communities of Great Britain, as well as the Italian calzone.

==Variations==

Variations on the original pepperoni roll may contain different types of cheese, peppers, etc.  The pepperoni can take several forms: a single stick; several folded slices; or shredded or ground meat.[tpl]cite web | last=Heffner | first=Bob | title=Pepperoni Roll Variations |work=The Pepperoni Roll Homepage | publisher=Bob Heffner | url=http://www.bobheffner.com/pepperoniroll/variations.htm | accessdate=1 December 2009[/tpl]

==Legal challenges==

Pepperoni rolls faced a legal challenge in 1987 when the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) proposed re-classifying bakeries that manufactured the rolls as meat packing plants, thus subjecting them to stricter regulations. The bakery owners claimed, however, that the costs of meeting the new regulations would put them out of business. The USDA's proposal was quashed after Jay Rockefeller, U.S. Senator for West Virginia, intervened.[tpl]cite web | author=John D.

==As military rations==

Since the early 2000s, the U.S. military began including a version of the pepperoni roll in one of the MREs (Meals, Ready-to-Eat) provided to troops. The military's rolls are made by a North Carolina company.[tpl]cite book | last=Sullivan | first=Ken | title=The West Virginia Encyclopedia | publisher=West Virginia Humanities Council | year=2006 | isbn=0-9778498-0-5 | pages=560â€“561[/tpl]
