Chengdu, formerly transliterated as Chengtu, is the capital of Sichuan province in Southwest China and a major city in Western China. It holds sub-provincial administrative status. The urban area houses 14,047,625 inhabitants: 7,123,697 within the municipality's nine districts2010 census and 6,730,749 in the surrounding. Chengdu is the fourth most populous city in mainland China, and most populous among prefecture-level cities as well.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/newsandcomingevents/t20110428_402722244.htm |title=Communiqué of the National Bureau of Statistics of People's Republic of China on Major Figures of the 2010 Population Census (No. 1) |publisher=National Bureau of Statistics of China |date=April 28, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2014, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131108022004/http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/newsandcomingevents/t20110428_402722244.htm|archivedate=November 8, 2013|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
Chengdu is one of the most important economic, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. According to the 2007 Public Appraisal for Best Chinese Cities for Investment, Chengdu was chosen as one of the top ten cities to invest in out of a total of 280 urban centers in China.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allroadsleadtochina.com/index.php/2007/07/08/chengdus-june-news/ |title=Chengdu's June News |publisher=All Roads Lead To China |date=2007-07-08 |accessdate=2011-03-15[/tpl] In 2006, it was named China's 4th-most livable city by China Daily.[tpl]cite news|last=Jing|first=Fu|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2006-01/03/content_508828.htm|title= Beijing drops out of top 10 'best city' list|work=China Daily|date=2006-01-03[/tpl]
The fertile Chengdu Plain, on which Chengdu is located, is also known as the "Country of Heaven" ([tpl]zh|s=[tpl]linktext|天|府|之|国[/tpl]|hp=Tiānfǔzhiguó|links=no[/tpl]), a phrase also often translated as "The Land of Abundance". The discovery of the Jinsha site suggests the area of Chengdu had become the center of the bronze age Sanxingdui culture around the time of the establishment of the state of Shu, prior to its annexation by Qin in 316 BC.

==Nicknames==

Chengdu is the original city name which dates back to its founding over 2000 years ago. However, its following nicknames are well known in China.

==Logo==

Chengdu unveiled its city logo in 2011. The design was inspired by the Golden Sun Bird artifact excavated from Jinsha Ruins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/mainland/detail_2011_12/31/11688105_0.shtml |title=Chengdu Unveils its New City Logo |publisher=news.ifeng.com |date=2011-12-30 |accessdate=2012-02-10[/tpl]

==History==

Archaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the Chengdu region was inhabited over four thousand years ago and was an important center of a unique ancient culture. During the period of Shang and Zhou dynasties, this region was the center of Shu culture.
In the early 4th century BC, the 9th king of the state of Shu, Kaiming IX, moved his capital from today's nearby Pixian to the city's current location. The Song dynasty geographical work Tai Ping Huan Yu Ji states that the king was inspired by King Tai of Zhou's statement that a settlement needed "one year to become a town; two years to become a capital."[tpl]zh|s=“以周太王从梁王止岐山，一年成邑，二年成都，因名之成都” (太平寰宇记)|links=no[/tpl] Following this, the king named the new city Cheng Du: literally, "become the capital". There are, however, several versions of why the capital was moved to Chengdu, and more recent theories of the name's origin point to it as stemming from, or referring to, earlier non-Han inhabitants and/or their languages.
The state of Shu was conquered by the State of Qin in 316 BC, and a new city was founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi (who as a matter of fact had argued against the invasion). This can be seen as the beginning of the Chinese Chengdu. Chengdu is the only major city in China to have remained in the same location with the same name after more than 2000 years,[tpl]cite web|url=http://cd.wenming.cn/lsmc/201101/t20110106_655.shtml |title=Chengdu, the City Whose Name hasn't changed for 2300 years |publisher=cd.wenming.cn |date=2011-01-06 |accessdate=2011-01-06[/tpl] although it was also known as Yizhou ([tpl]linktext|益|州[/tpl]) for a long time, and was given other names at other times.
As a central city for at least 2000 years, Chengdu's influence gradually expanded from the Sichuan basin to Western China. At its height, Chengdu was once named "One of the Five Metropolis" in China and was equally famous with Yangzhou (in modern-day Jiangsu) in history. During the Three-Kingdom period, Zhuge Liang, the prime minister of Shu kingdom, called Chengdu "the land of abundance". Li Bai, the famous poet during the Tang dynasty, eulogized the city as "Chengdu lies above empyrean". Su Shi, the eminent writer during the Song dynasty, hailed Chengdu as "the southwestern metropolis".
During the partition following the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty—i.e., the era of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei founded the southwest kingdom of Shu-Han (221–263) with Chengdu as its capital. Over time, Chengdu had been the capital of six local feudal reigns of which Shu-Han is the best known.
During the Tang dynasty, both the "Poet God" Li Bai and the "Poet Sage" Du Fu spent some part of their lives in Chengdu. Du Fu constructed the celebrated "Caotáng" (thatched cottage or grass-hut) in the second year of his four-years stay (759–762). But today's Caotang, a rather sumptuous house in the traditional style, was only constructed in 1078 in memory of Du Fu. During the Tang dynasty more than 1,200 years ago, Chengdu became one of the foremost commercial cities in China, second only to Yangzhou ([tpl]zh|s=扬一州二 |t=揚一益二|hp=Yáng yī Yì èr|l=Yangzhou first Yizhou (Chengdu) second|links=no[/tpl]).
Chengdu was also the birthplace of the first widely used paper money in the world (Northern Song dynasty, around 960 AD). The Qingyang Gong Taoist temple was built in Chengdu in the 9th century, meaning "Green Goat".
At around the end of the Song dynasty, a rebel leader set up the capital of a short-lived kingdom in Chengdu, called Dashu ([tpl]zh|s=[tpl]linktext|大|蜀[/tpl]|hp=Dà shǔ|links=no[/tpl]).
In 1279, the Mongols sacked Chengdu and over a million of its inhabitants were estimated to have been killed.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TR6svTcMQVoC&pg=PA25&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Rising China and Its Postmodern Fate: Memories of Empire in a New Global Context |author=Charles Horner |isbn=978-0820338781 |publisher=University of Georgia Press[/tpl] During the Yuan dynasty, Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge (or an earlier version of it) in Chengdu. He referred to Chengdu as "Sindafu" ("Cheng-Tu_Fu") as the capital of the province of the same name.Quian, Jack, Chengdu: A City of Paradise, 2006. Cf. p.109Marco Polo referred to Chengdu as Sindafu (variously spelled in different editions as "Sin-din-fu". &c.) which was certainly Ch'eng-Tu-Fu (Chengdu), the capital of Sichuan province. Cf. Polo, Chapter XLIV: Concerning the Province and City of Sindafu. See Henry Yule; Henri Cordier (translators and editors), The Travels of Marco Polo, v.2, the complete Yule-Cordier edition. "Let us now speak of a great Bridge which crosses this River within the city. This bridge is of stone; it is seven paces in width and half a mile in length (the river being that much in width as I told you); and all along its length on either side there are columns of marble to bear the roof, for the bridge is roofed over from end to end with timber, and that all richly painted. And on this bridge there were houses in which a great deal of trade and industry is carried on. But these houses were all of wood merely, and they are put up in the morning and taken down in the evening. Also there stands upon the bridge the Great Kaan's _Comercque_, that is to say, his custom-house, where his toll and tax were levied."Mayhew, Bradley; Miller, Korina; English, Alex, South-West China, Lonely Planet Publications, 1998 (2nd edition 2002). Cf. p.19 on the Mongul Reign: Yuan Dynasty.
In 1644, at the end of the Ming dynasty, another rebel leader, Zhang Xianzhong, established a short-lived Daxi dynasty ([tpl]lang|zh|大西[/tpl]) in Sichuan with Chengdu, which he renamed Xijing ([tpl]lang|zh|西京|l=Western Capital|links=no[/tpl]), as the capital.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/CHANG_HSIEN-CHUNG.html |title=Chang Hsien-chung |work= Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period |publisher=Qing Research Portal, Dartmouth College[/tpl] Zhang was said to have massacred large number of people in Sichuan and Chengdu was reduced to a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers.[tpl]cite book |author=Yingcong Dai |title=The Sichuan Frontier and Tibet: Imperial Strategy in the Early Qing |year=2009 |publisher=University of Washington Press |pages=22–24 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DYHfVVAAf_kC&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-295-98952-5 [/tpl] The depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. In 1911, the Railway Protection Movement centered in Chengdu helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.
During World War II, the Kuomintang (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek fled to Sichuan to escape the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them businesspeople, workers and academics, who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important center.
In 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.
During the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defence of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On December 10 the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.
The industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.
Chengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region.
On May 12, 2008, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck causing damage to the area, killing about 80,000 people and injuring 26,413 as of May 12, 2008. 4,021 of the casualties and most of the property damage were from Dujiangyan and Pengzhou, two cities within the administration of Chengdu, the sub-provincial city. Chengdu did not suffer any discernible damage.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/pc/2008-05-13/326/651.html|date=2008-05-24|accessdate=2008-05-24|title=Casualties in Wenchuan Earthquake|publisher=Sina.com|language=Chinese[/tpl] The reason why many people died in the surrounding areas had to do with poor construction. Though only [tpl]convert|75|km|mi|sp=uk[/tpl] from the epicenter, Chengdu itself was built to earthquake specification, and most buildings there remained intact.
The Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainably planned city that will be outside of Chengdu, and is expected to open later in the decade. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.[tpl]cite web|last=Davies|first=Alex|title=China Is Building A Huge Eco-City Where No One Will Need To Drive|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/china-is-building-a-nearly-car-free-city-2012-11?op=1|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=27 January 2013|date=2 November 2012[/tpl]

==Geography==

The vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 meters to 720 meters.
Northwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountain and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds [tpl]convert|3000|m|abbr=on[/tpl] and includes Miao Jiling ([tpl]convert|5364|m|abbr=on[/tpl]) and Xiling Snow Mountain ([tpl]convert|5164|m|abbr=on[/tpl]). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a Giant Panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountain and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as "the Abundant Land" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.
Chengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30° 05' to 31° 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102° 54' to 104° 53' E, stretching for [tpl]convert|192|km[/tpl] from east to west and [tpl]convert|166|km|abbr=on[/tpl] south to north, administering [tpl]convert|12390|km2[/tpl] of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of [tpl]convert|500|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on[/tpl], features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Range ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|龙泉山脉[/tpl]) and the Penzhong Hills ([tpl]lang|zh|盆中丘陵[/tpl]); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to [tpl]convert|5364|m|abbr=on[/tpl] in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at [tpl]convert|378|m|abbr=on[/tpl], lies in the southeast in Jintang County.

===Climate===

Chengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa) and is largely mild and humid. It has four distinct seasons, blessed with abundant rainfall, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is [tpl]convert|5.6|°C|1[/tpl], and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the "Three Furnaces" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around [tpl]convert|25|°C[/tpl], with afternoon highs sometimes reaching [tpl]convert|33|°C[/tpl]; sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are cloudy and overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is typically interminably grey and dreary, compounding the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March–April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October–November). The annual mean is [tpl]convert|16.14|°C|1[/tpl], and extremes have ranged from [tpl]convert|−5.9|°C|0[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|40.0|°C[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm|title=Extreme Temperatures Around the World|accessdate=2013-02-21[/tpl]

===Administrative divisions===

Chengdu is a sub-provincial city. It has direct jurisdiction over 9 districts, 4 county-level cities and 6 counties:

==Cityscape==

The basic layout of Chengdu dates back to the Qing dynasty. Most rivers, bridges, streets and alleys were well preserved until 1949 when the new construction started.
As of July 2013, the world's largest building the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. At [tpl]convert|328|ft|m[/tpl] high, [tpl]convert|1,640|ft|m[/tpl] long, and [tpl]convert|1,312|ft|m[/tpl] wide, the Center houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, the Paradise Island waterpark, an artificial beach, a [tpl]convert|164|yd|m[/tpl]-long LED screen, skating rink, pirate ship, fake Mediterranean village, 24-hour artificial sun, and 15,000-spot parking area.[tpl]cite web|title=The world's new largest building is four times the size of Vatican City|url=http://qz.com/100639/china-chengdu-world-new-largest-building-is-four-times-the-size-of-vatican-city/|work=Quartz|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=4 July 2013|author=Roberto A. Ferdman|date=3 July 2013[/tpl]

===Ancient fortress wall===

The ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, [tpl]convert|10|m[/tpl] high and [tpl]convert|11|km|abbr=on[/tpl] long, was built during the Qing dynasty. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures [tpl]convert|10|m|abbr=on[/tpl] wide while the top measures [tpl]convert|6|m|abbr=on[/tpl] wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.
Four gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.

===City in a city===

Shaocheng (Small City), also known as Manchu City, was built within the fortress wall. It was a "city in a city" established by the imperial court of the Qing dynasty for Manchu soldiers and their families in 1718. People's Park, once known as Shaocheng Park, was used as a military warehouse for Qing soldiers.

==Demography==

The municipality is home for 14,047,625 inhabitants at the 2010 census whom 7,123,697 in the city considered as urban. The built up area is home to 6,730,749 inhabitants and emcompasses 7 out of 9 urban districts (all but Longquanyi District and Qingbaijiang District still separated of core built up area + Pi county being urbanized quickly).
The total number of foreigners living in Chengdu (including people from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) was about 20,000 by the end of 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90782/90872/6882671.html|title=Chengdu builds 1st "foreigner community" in western China|publisher=english.people.com.cn|accessdate=2013-04-22[/tpl]

==Culture==

===Literature===

Some of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu: Chengdu has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Hanfu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Han dynasty; Li Bai and Su Shi, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, "A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs."

===Fine art===

During the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school with other painters. At that time, “Hanlin Painting Academy” was the earliest royal academy in China.

===Education===

Wen Weng, administer of Chengdu during the Western Han dynasty, established the first local public school named Shishi (literally a stone house), in the world. The school site has not changed for more than 2,000 years, which remains the site of today's Shishi High School.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdshishi.net/ |title=成都石室中学 |publisher=Cdshishi.net|accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]

===Theatre===

The saying "Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world" reflects the achievement of Sichuan Opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera "Bullfighting" was written in the Warring States Period.[tpl]clarify|date=October 2013[/tpl] The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan Opera.

===Language===

The native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, "Chengdu Dialect" ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|成都话/成都方言[/tpl]) is widely used in lieu of "Sichuanese" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.

===Culinary art and tea culture===

The distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Grandma Chen's Tofu (Mapo doufu), Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien (literally meaning, "Noodles carried on a pole" (Dan Dan Noodles). All three dishes are spicy. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers to give them additional flavor. An article[tpl]cite news|title=People's Party Animals|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/la-fi-chinaparty8feb08,1,6127459,full.story|date=2006-02-08|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Don|last=Lee[/tpl] by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu "China's party city" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu outnumbers Shanghai in the number of tea houses and bars despite having less than half the population.
Sichuanese cuisine features careful pairings of boldness and subtlety in dishes, snacks, banquets, and hotpot. A characteristic adage goes: 'one dish, one style; one hundred dishes, one hundred flavors; flexible use of hot chilis and delicate flavors.' Of thousands of dishes, every one has a story behind it.
The local snacks in Chengdu are known for creative ingredients, skilled preparation, wide variety, and cheap prices. Tastes range from sweet and spicy to sour and hot in a range of cooking techniques including frying, stewing, baking, steaming and boiling. Some of the more common snacks found across town include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads, and soups.
With over a thousand years of history, Chinese tea culture is perhaps best exemplified by the bamboo chairs and wooden tables found in the hundreds of tea houses throughout Chengdu, with jasmine tea being served as the local staple. As early as the Western Han period, both tea trade and tea culture were very prosperous in Sichuan with Chengdu as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.
Chengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.[tpl]cite news|title=Gastronomy - United Nations|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/creativity/creative-industries/creative-cities-network/gastronomy/|date=2012-07-30|publisher=UNESCO[/tpl] 

===Teahouse===

Traditional tea houses in Chengdu usually feature bamboo chairs and wooden tables and offer jasmine, long jing and biluochun tea.
Modern tea houses can be spotted on almost every city corner. The price for tea varies from 5 RMB to several hundred. Besides tea and snacks, almost all tea houses offer Majiang sets, tables, and sometimes separate majiang rooms. Most locals go to tea houses to play majiang with friends. Some luxury tea houses in Chengdu also offer live entertainment such as Sichuan opera shows.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sc.sina.com.cn/life/travel/twc/2011-04-13/085564023_4.html |title=阳光下最热闹的地方 外地人眼中的成都茶文化 |publisher=Sina Sichuan |date=2011-04-13 |accessdate=2012-02-09[/tpl]

===Mahjong===

Mahjong has been an essential part of most local people's life. Almost every household in Chengdu has at least one set of mahjong. People play majiang at home or in tea houses. On sunny days, local people like to play mahjong on the sidewalks, especially in the area nearby the Fu Nan River. Most people play with money to make the game more exciting.
Mahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese mahjong. A small amount of gambling is regarded as harmless entertainment. Friends and families chat over mahjong tables, making mahjong an important social vehicle. In fact, many business people negotiate deals while playing mahjong.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whatsonchengdu.com/ent18.html |title=Playing Mahjong games, the popular way of relaxation in Chengdu |publisher=What'sonchengdu.com |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2012-02-09[/tpl]

===Rural tourism: Nong Jia Le===

Chengdu claims to have first practiced the modern business model of 'Nong Jia Le' (Happy Rural Homes). It refers to the practice of suburban and rural residents converting their houses into restaurants, hotels and entertainment spaces in order to attract city dwellers.
Nong Jia Le features different styles and price levels and have been thriving around Chengdu. They provide gateways for city dwellers to escape the city, offer delicious and affordable home-made dishes, and provide mahjong facilities.
Some of the most popular ones are located in Sansheng Village east of Chengdu, and Nongke Village in Pixian County, northwest of Chengdu.

===Customs and festivals===

====The Grand Temple Fair====

Chengdu's annual Grand Temple Fair is held every year during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) in Wuhou Shrine, Jinli, the Culture Park, and several other city parks. The 15-day-long festival showcases both traditional Sichuan folk art and modern fashions of the city. Food stalls on site offer over 100 varieties of freshly made local snacks.

====The Lantern Festival====

Chengdu’s annual Lantern Festival is held every year during the Spring Festival in Tazishan Park in the eastern part of Chengdu. Lanterns of different designs and themes are on display with traditional art performances including Sichuan opera, acrobatics shows, and local talkshows.

====The Dujiangyan Water Releasing Festival====

The Dujiangyan Water-Releasing Festival takes place on the 5th of April each year in Du Jiang Yan, [tpl]convert|58|km|abbr=on[/tpl] away from Chengdu. Residents dress up in ancient costumes and read elegies for Li Bing and his sons, in order to honor them for their contribution to the irrigation project they built over 2,000 years ago.

====The Huanglongxi Fire Dragon Festival====

Fire Dragon Festival of HuangLongXi is celebrated from the 2nd to the 15th day of the first lunar month of each new year.
The Festival originated from South Song dynasty (1127–1279 A.D.). Celebrations include lighting paper dragons, a lion dance, floating lanterns on the water, and various street activities.

====South China Snow and Ice Festival====

The South China Snow and Ice Festival takes place from January to March at the Xiling Snow Mountain Ski Resort, [tpl]convert|95|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] west of downtown Chengdu. The festival is popular among locals, especially children, since it rarely snows in Chengdu and people relish the sight of snow. A large variety of snow activities are offered during the festival.

==Home of the giant pandas==

As China's National Treasure, the giant panda is one of the rarest animals in the world. The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.
A breeding center for giant pandas was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only [tpl]convert|130|km|abbr=on[/tpl] outside Chengdu.
The western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first discovered this species in Sichuan in 1869.http://www.chengdu.gov.cn/echengdu/news/detail.jsp?id=274101 [tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] Now, the somewhat clumsy giant panda is a symbol representing the World Wildlife Fund. They are also a messenger of friendly communication between Chengdu and international cities. Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.
Chengdu has established the world renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.
In 2008, after the release of the American animation movie Kung Fu Panda, DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg and other DreamWorks members visited the city of Chengdu.

===Railway transport===

Chengdu is a major railway junction city and rail administrative center in southwestern China. It is the terminus for railways leading to Baoji, Shaanxi, Chongqing, Kunming, Yunnan and Dazhou in eastern Sichuan, as well as the Shanghai–Wuhan–Chengdu and Chengdu-Dujiangyan High-Speed Railways. The Chengdu Railway Bureau manages the railway system of Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou and Yunnan.
Since April 2013, a new solution allows companies to ship goods three times a week (initially it was only one train a week)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wbj.pl/article-62893-poland-china-cargo-train-a-success.html |title=Poland-China cargo train a success |publisher=wbj.pl |date=2013-06-03 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl] to Europe by train starting from Chengdu Qingbaijiang Station with final destination Łódź, Poland. It is the first express cargo train linking China and Europe, with a transit time of 12 to 14 days.
New lines under construction include conventional line to Lanzhou and new high-speed lines to Mianyang, Leshan and Chongqing.
There are two major passenger stations servicing Chengdu. They are Chengdu Railway Station (commonly referred to as the "North Station") and the new modern Chengdu East Railway Station, which was opened in May 2011. There are also two minor passenger stations, the Chengdu South Railway Station (closed for renovation and expansion) and Chengdu West Railway Station (under construction).
Chengdu also has four main freight train stations. Among them the North Marshalling Station is one of the largest marshalling station in Asia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://21asiantravelguide.info/chengdu/index.html|title=Chengdu city info southwest china|accessdate=2010-03-05[/tpl]

===Intercity high-speed rail===

Chengdu and Chongqing are connected by a high-speed rail service via Suining. This service is being upgraded from the current [tpl]convert|200|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] up to [tpl]convert|350|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] trains with construction of the Chengdu–Chongqing High-Speed Railway. This is being built on new and upgraded trackage along the current route, with expected completion in 2014.
The Chengdu–Dujiangyan High-Speed Railway is a dual-track, electrified, passenger-dedicated, high-speed rail line connecting the urban area of Chengdu with the satellite city of Dujiangyan. The line is [tpl]convert|65|km|abbr=on[/tpl] in length with 15 stations. China Railways CRH1 train sets on the line reach a maximum speed of [tpl]convert|220|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] and make the full-trip in 30 minutes. The line was built in 18 months and entered into operation on May 12, 2010. The railway is built to withstand an 8.0-magnitude earthquake.
On May 28, 2008, 16 days after the Wenchuan Earthquake devastated Dujiangyan and the western suburbs of Chengdu, the Chengdu city government and the Ministry of Railways agreed to build a high-speed railway line as part of the reconstruction of the disaster zone. Construction began on November 4, 2008 and involved 20,000 workers at the cost of Y13 billion. The line entered trial operation on April 1, 2010 and full commercial operation began on May 12, 2010, the second anniversary of the large earthquake that killed some 70,000 people in the region.2
The route uses CRH1 trains in eight-car train sets, which can carry 661 passengers. Each day, 15 pairs of trains are scheduled daily between Chengdu and Dujiangyan’s Mountain Qingcheng Station.
Jiangyou, Mianyang and Leshan are being connected to Chengdu by a regional north-south running high-speed rail network. It will be designed to run at 200 kph. Construction commenced in 2008 and is due for completion by the end of 2012.

===Expressways===

Chengdu's transportation network is well developed, and Chengdu serves as the starting point for many national highways, with major routes going from Sichuan–Shanxi, Sichuan–Tibet, and Sichuan–Yunnan.
For the year 2007, Chengdu announced the official launch of 37 significant projects, including the Chengdu–Jianyang Expressway in an attempt to accelerate the construction of the experimental district. This project is expected to solve the current transportation problem, which is proved to be the bottleneck in Jianyang's development. Development of major tunnels and the Longquan Lake scenic spot has also been planned to integrate Jianyang better into the Chengdu economic circle.
Several major road projects were also mentioned in the paper: a [tpl]convert|15|km|abbr=on[/tpl] tunnel from Shuangliu Taiping to Jianyang Sancha Lake; alteration of the National Expressway 321, from Jiangyang to Longquanyi, totaling [tpl]convert|26|km|abbr=on[/tpl]. There will also be a road that connects Longquan Town to Longquan Lake; it will be connected to the Chengdu–Jianyang Expressway and hence shorten the journey by [tpl]convert|10|km|abbr=on[/tpl]. The authority has yet to decide whether drivers will have to pay tolls to access the road. By the end of 2008, there are ten expressways, connecting the center of Chengdu to its suburbs. The expressways that will be open to the public by the end of December are the Chenglin Expressway, extensions of Guanghua Avenue, Shawan Line, and an expressway from Chengdu to Heilongtan.
The toll-free Chengjin Expressway in the east of Chengdu is [tpl]convert|38.7|km|abbr=on[/tpl] long, with six lines. After it opens to the public, it will take only about half an hour to drive from the downtown Chengdu to Jintang, half the time of the current journey.
The expressway between Chengdu to Heilongtan (Chengdu section), going to the south of the city, is [tpl]convert|42|km|abbr=on[/tpl] long. It is also toll-free and a journey from downtown Chengdu to Heilongtan will only take half an hour.
The extension of Guanghua Avenue, going towards the west of the city, is [tpl]convert|11.6|km|abbr=on[/tpl] long with an estimated investment of 300 million yuan. It will cut the journey time from Chongzhou City to Sanhuan Road to less than half an hour.
The extension of Shawan Road going north will be [tpl]convert|8.8|km|abbr=on[/tpl] long, and is designed for travel at [tpl]convert|60|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl]. After it is connected to the expressways Pixian–Dujiangyan and Pixian–Pengzhou, it will take only 30 minutes to go from Chengdu to Pengzhou.
Via the Sichuan–Tibet Highway, from Chengdu to Nagchu (near Lhasa) is a distance of [tpl]convert|2028|km|abbr=on[/tpl].

===Public transport===

====Chengdu Metro====

The Chengdu Metro officially opened on 1 October 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdmetro.cn/|title=Chengdu Metro Company website|publisher=Cdmetro.cn|accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl] The [tpl]convert|18|km|abbr=on[/tpl] North-South Line runs from Shengxian Lake (near northern railway station) to Century City (south Chengdu/Software Park). This is also called the number 1 line. Line 2 (Phase 1) opened on September 2012. Line 1 (Phase 2), Line3 (Phase 1) and Line 4 (Phase 1) are currently under constructions. Four more lines are planned to start constructions in the (near) future. Future plans call for seven lines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2010-09-28/074818170533s.shtml |title=我国中西部地区第一条地铁开通_新闻中心_新浪网 |publisher=News.sina.com.cn |date=2010-09-28|accessdate=2011-03-15[/tpl]

====Chengdu Bus====

Bus is the most important Public Transport in Chengdu. There are about 400 bus lines in Chengdu. Chengdu was the site of the June 5th bus fire incident.

===River transport===

Historically, the Silk River (a.k.a. the Funan River) was used for boat traffic in and out of Chengdu. However, due to the size of the river itself and the reduced water depth over time in history, the Silk River is no longer capable of carrying any type of water traffic. Due to this reason, Chengdu has no direct access to the Yangtze River, or any other larger river. However, to ensure that Chengdu's goods have access to the river efficiently, the port cities of Yibin and Luzhou—both of which are reachable from Chengdu within hours by expressways—on the Yangtze have commenced large-scale port infrastructure development. As materials and equipment for the rebuilding of northern Sichuan are sent in from the East Coast to Sichuan, these ports will see significant increases in throughput.
