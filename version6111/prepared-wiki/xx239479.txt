It was the birth of McLean's daughter which spurred him on to make his musical dreams a reality. “Me and My Business partner D-el the producer went at it hard, making and sending out t-shirts and CDs, and setting up a Myspace page. We’d wake at the crack of dawn and work until we couldn’t stay awake – even if that was two days later” he stated.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] Around this time, the singer also took jobs as a night watchman, at a fire alarm factory and at Pizza Hut in order to support his family.Myspace
