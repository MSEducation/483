Initially, his artistic style was similar to that of Mikiya Mochizuki and had humoristic touches, but moved on to the gekiga style. He is known for using the gekiga style to create detailed and serious science fiction stories based on American and European SF novels but creating a completely different storyline. He had also drawn various works based on ancient and pre-historic histories. Amongst other things, he is known for his graphic novel series, 2001 Nights.
His work is acknowledged by the British Museum and was on display during 5 November 2009 to 3 January 2010.http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/press_releases/2009/manga.aspx
