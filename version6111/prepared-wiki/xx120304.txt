[[Bisection bandwidth]]

CATEGORIES: Information theory, Network management

If the network is segmented into two equal parts, this is the bandwidth between the two parts.[tpl]cite book|author=John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson|title=Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach|edition=Third Edition|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Inc|year=2003|isbn=1-55860-596-7[/tpl] Typically, this refers to the worst-case segmentation, but being of equal parts is critical to the definition, as it refers to an actual bisection of the network. 
Theoretical support for the importance of this measure of network performance was developed in the PhD research [tpl]cite book|author=C. D. Thompson|title=A complexity theory for VLSI|publisher=PhD Thesis, Technical Report CMU-CS-80-140, Carnegie-Mellon University|year=2003[/tpl] of Clark Thomborson (formerly Clark Thompson).  Thomborson proved that important algorithms such as sorting, fast Fourier transformation, and matrix-matrix multiplication become communication-limited—as opposed to CPU-limited or memory-limited—on computers with insufficient bisection width.  Thomborson's last publication on this topic[tpl]cite article|author=Clark Thomborson|title=The economics of large-memory computations|journal=Information Processing Letters|volume=66|pages=263-268|year=1998[/tpl] was published in 1998.
