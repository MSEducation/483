It is located [tpl]convert|7.2|mi|1[/tpl] southwest of Mount Hood, [tpl]convert|1.9|mi|1[/tpl] west-southwest of Government Camp between the Zigzag River and Still Creek, south of Zigzag Mountain.  Because of its proximity to Mount Hood, it is considered a foothill.
The mountain is named for its three distinct peaks along the summit, forming the cirque that is now part of the Mount Hood Skibowl ski resort.[ref]

The highest peak is [tpl]convert|5066|ft|0[/tpl] above sea level. The name was in use as early as 1897, according to Elijah "Lige" Coalman, the namesake of Coalman Glacier. The mountain has also been called "Tom Dick Mountain" in the past, although the Board on Geographic Names officially decided in favor of including "Harry" in 1969 making it a play on phrase "Tom, Dick and Harry."
Mirror Lake, a popular hiking destination, is located on the north side of the mountain.
Both Tom Dick and Harry Mountain and Zigzag Mountain are capped by Pliocene andesite and basalt.[ref]
