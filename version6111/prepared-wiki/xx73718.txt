[[Närke and Värmland County]]

CATEGORIES: Former counties of Sweden

Närke and Värmland County ([tpl]Lang-sv|Närkes och Värmlands län[/tpl]) was the earlier name of Örebro County in Sweden, between 1634 and 1779. In that year Värmland ceded to form Värmland County. Since Närke only corresponded the southern part of the remaining territory and the name was changed to reflect the city where the Governor resided, namely Örebro.
