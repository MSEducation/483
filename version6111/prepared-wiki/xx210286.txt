==Promotion==

In the Spring of 2008, a billboard for the album was placed on Sunset Blvd. Various print advertisements for bus stops, magazines and newspaper circulated from April 2008 to the release date of the album. The theme of the advertisements featured Griffin in an red carpetesque gown desperate for media attention (for which she is famously known). The album also gained its own episode on Griffin's reality show, titled "For Your (Grammy) Consideration".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bravotv.com/Kathy_Griffin/season/4/episodes/index.php?episode=8 |title=Episode 8: For Your (Grammy) Consideration |accessdate=2008-08-10 |work=Bravo Television |publisher=NBC[/tpl]
