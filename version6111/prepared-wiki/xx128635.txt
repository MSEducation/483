Junger Tag (English translation: "Young Day") was the German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1973, performed in German by Danish singer Gitte Hænning. Hænning was the third of three female Scandinavian schlager artists to represent Germany in the Contest in the late 60s and early 70s, the first being Norwegian Wenche Myhre in 1968 with "Ein Hoch der Liebe" and the second Swedish Siw Malmkvist with "Primaballerina" in 1969.
The song was performed fourth on the night (following Portugal's Fernando Tordo with "Tourada" and preceding Norway's Bendik Singers with "It's Just A Game"). At the close of voting, it had received 85 points, placing 8th in a field of 17.
The song is addressed to the new day, with Gitte asking what it will bring her - new hope, or the sadness of the previous day. Hænning also recorded the song in her mother tongue Danish (as "Unge Dag"), English ("Hello Today"), French ("Nouveau Jour") and Spanish ("El nuevo sol").
It was succeeded as German representative at the 1974 Contest by Cindy & Bert with "Die Sommermelodie".
