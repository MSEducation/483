This is a list of issue covers of TV Guide magazine from the decade of the 2000s, from January 2000 to December 2009.  The entries on this table include each cover's subjects and their artists (photographer or illustrator).  This list is for the regular weekly issues of TV Guide, and includes covers that are national or regional in nature, along with any covers that were available exclusively to subscribers.  Any one-time-only special issues of TV Guide are not included.
From the beginning of this decade until the 4/3/2004 cover, dates indicated fell on a Saturday (the TV listings were in a Saturday-to-Friday pattern).  Issue dates from 4/11/2004 to 10/9/2005 fell on a Sunday (Sunday-to-Saturday listings).  Issue dates from 10/17/2005 onward fall on a Monday (Monday-to-Sunday listings).
NOTE: Beginning in 2006, TV Guide occasionally produced 2-week "double issues."  Such issue dates are indicated in bold italics, with listings covering that week and the following week.
