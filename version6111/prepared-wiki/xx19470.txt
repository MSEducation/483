===Origins===

An early use of the term supermodel appeared in 1891 in an interview with artist Henry Stacy Marks for The Strand Magazine, in which Marks told journalist Harry How, "A good many models are addicted to drink, and, after sitting a while, will suddenly go to sleep. Then I have had what I call the 'super' model. You know the sort of man; he goes in for theatrical effect ..."[tpl]cite journal|title=Illustrated Interviews.

On 6 October 1942, a writer named Judith Cass had used the term super model for her article in the Chicago Tribune, which headlined "Super Models are Signed for Fashion Show".Chicago Tribune archives Cass, Judith. Chicago Daily Tribune "'Super' Models Are Signed for Fashion Show" 6 October 1942. pg 21. Later in 1943, an agent named Clyde Matthew Dessner used the term in a "how-to" book about modeling entitled So You Want to Be a Model! in which Dessner wrote, "She will be a super-model, but the girl in her will be like the girl in you—quite ordinary, but ambitious and eager for personal development."So You Want to Be a Model!

===1960s–1970s===

In February 1968, an article in Glamour described 19 models as "supermodels", of whom were: Cheryl Tiegs, Verushka, Lisa Palmer, Peggy Moffitt, Susan (Sue) Murray, Twiggy, Sunny Harnett, Marisa Berenson, Gretchen Harris, Heide Wiedeck, Irish Bianchi, Hiroko Matsumoto, Anne de Zogheb, Kathy Carpenter, Jean Shrimpton, Jean Patchett, Benedetta Barzini, Claudia Duxbury, and Agneta Frieberg.Cokal, Susann.

In the 1970s, some models became more prominent as their names became more recognizable to the general public.

===1990s===

By the 1990s, the supermodel became increasingly prominent in the media. The title became tantamount to superstar, to signify a supermodel's fame having risen simply from "personality." Supermodels did talk shows, were cited in gossip columns, partied at the trendiest nightspots, landed movie roles, inspired franchises, dated or married film stars, and earned themselves millions. Fame empowered them to take charge of their careers, to market themselves, and to command higher fees.
The defining year and turning point for models, fashion, and popular culture was 1990 when the combined power, singular beauty and influence of five women created such an impression on the world that a new word was coined especially for them: supermodel. January 1990 began with a British Vogue cover presenting five models - Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, and Tatjana Patitz[tpl]cite web |last=Leisa |first=Barnett |title=Those Jeans Look Super |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/2007-07/070716-those-jeans-look-super.aspx |publisher=Vogue.com.uk|accessdate=16 July 2007[/tpl] - who had gradually attained fame since the mid-1980s, and were now the industry's top stars, responsible for expanding and positively changing ideals of beauty due to their individual and idiosyncratic looks.

'90", directed by David Fincher. Each supermodel attained world-wide fame and fortune, sharing covers of all the international editions of Vogue, walking the catwalks for the world's top designers, and becoming known by their first names alone.[tpl]cite news |last=Saner |first=Ermine |title=The Forgotten Supermodel |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=15 January 2009 |at=page 12, G2 section |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/15/fashion-supermodel-vogue-tatjana-patitz[/tpl]
In 1991, Christy Turlington signed a contract with Maybelline that paid her $800,000 for twelve days' work each year. Four years later, Claudia Schiffer reportedly earned $12 million for her various modeling assignments. Authorities ranging from Karl Lagerfeld to Time had declared the supermodels more glamorous than movie stars.
As the phenomenon progressed, the supermodels were joined by Stephanie Seymour, Claudia Schiffer, and then in 1992 Kate Moss. They were the most heavily in demand, collectively dominating magazine covers, fashion runways, editorial pages, and both print and broadcast advertising."We Three Queens" by Alex Williams, New York online retrieved 7 July 2006"The Fall of the Supermodel" Time.

They were like movie stars." The editors name famous models from previous decades, but explain that, "None of them attained the fame and world-wide renown bestowed on Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Tatjana Patitz, Stephanie Seymour, Claudia Schiffer, Amber Valletta, Yasmeen Ghauri, and Karen Mulder in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These models burst out beyond the pages of the magazines. Many became the faces of cosmetics brands and perfumes, had their own television programs and physical-fitness videos and their own lines of lingerie ... Their lives, activities, influences, and images were the subjects of all types of sociological and historical analysis."
In the mid-1990s, the initial era of the supermodel ended and a new era for the supermodel began driven by heroin chic. By the late 1990s, actresses, pop singers, and other entertainment celebrities began gradually replacing models on fashion magazine covers and ad campaigns.Death of the Supermodels by C. L. Johnson, Urban Models 21 October 2002 online Retrieved 13 July 2006 The pendulum of limelight left many models in anonymity. A popular "conspiracy theory" explaining the supermodel's disappearance is that designers and fashion editors grew weary of the "I won't get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day" attitude and made sure no small group of models would ever again have the power of the Big Six.
Charles Gandee, associate editor at Vogue, has said that high prices and poor attitudes contributed less to the decline of the supermodel. As clothes became less flashy, designers turned to models who were less glamorous, so they wouldn't overpower the clothing. Whereas many supermodels of the previous era were American-born, their accents making for an easier transition to stardom, the majority of models began coming from non-English speaking countries and cultures,Who will be the next Super Model?

During the 1990s, this group of women were considered to be 'the most famous supermodels of them all' including Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Christy Turlington.[tpl]cite journal|last=Collacello|first=Bob|title=A League of their Own|journal=Vanity Fair|date=September 2008|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/style/features/2008/09/supermodels200809|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl] They became known as The Trinity, a term first used by Journalist, Michael Gross. This term became sensationalized throughout the media however it has come to light that this was not favoured by the women. Due to their large scale success, these three were known throughout the industry on a first name basis, Christy, Naomi, Linda.[tpl]cite journal|last=Williams|first=Alex|title=We Three Queens|journal=New York Magazine|year=2002|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/anniversary/35th/n_8578/|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl] They all were known for something within their group, Linda as the Chameleon for her ability to transform her look and to reinvent herself [tpl]cite web|last=Fidanzia|first=Valentina|title=Vogue Italia: Encyclo- Linda Evangelista|url=http://www.vogue.it/en/encyclo/people/e/linda-evangelista|publisher=Vogue Italia|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl] Christy was known as the 'insurance model' [tpl]cite news|last=Chun|first=Rene|title=More to Christy than Meets the Eye|url=http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Christy_Turlington|accessdate=17 March 2014|newspaper=The Dallas Morning News|date=20 September 1995[/tpl] saying "Clients know that if they hire me, nothing will go wrong.""

For the first time, supermodels were having their names credited in the magazine editorials. Linda was quoted saying in 1990 that, "We don't 'vogue'; we are vogue," referring to herself and fellow model, Christy Turlington. According to Christy, there term The Trinity was made-up and only came about due to the surfacing of two now iconic images of the three women; drinking champagne in a bathtub, and the other portraying the 'see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil' metaphor.[tpl]cite journal|last=Brown|first=Laura|title=Wild At Heart: Christy Turlington|journal=Harpers Bazaar|date=15 May 2013|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/news/christy-turlington-interview-0613#slide-2|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl] Even though as time is passing, these three women still remain active in the modelling industry and have went on the become heavily involved in philanthropic endeavours.

===2000s and present day===

Emerging in the late 1990s, Gisele Bündchen became the first in a wave of Brazilian models to gain popularity in the industry and with the public. With numerous covers of Vogue under her belt, including an issue that dubbed her the "Return of the Sexy Model," Bündchen was credited with ending the "heroin chic" era of models.[tpl]cite web|author=Gisele Bündchen |url=http://www.people.com/people/gisele_bundchen/biography |title=Celebrity Central: Gisele Bundchen biography |work=People |accessdate=7 March 2011[/tpl]  Following in her footsteps by signing contracts with Victoria's Secret, fellow Brazilians Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambrosio rose to prominence; however, this "new trinity" were unable to cross over into the world of TV, movies and talk shows as easily as their predecessors due to their foreign accents. 
Several seasons later, they were followed by Eastern Europeans barely into their teens, pale, and "bordering on anorexic. They were too young to become movie stars or date celebrities; too skeletal to bag Victoria's Secret contracts; and a lack of English didn't bode well for a broad media career". The opportunities for super-stardom were waning in the modeling world, and models like Heidi Klum and Tyra Banks took to television with reality shows like Project Runway and America's Next Top Model, respectively, to not only remain relevant but establish themselves as media moguls.
Contrary to the fashion industry's celebrity trend of the previous decade, lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret continues to groom and launch young talents into supermodel status, awarding their high-profile "Angels" multi-year, multi-million-dollar contracts.  In addition to Klum, Banks, Bündchen, Lima, and Ambrosio, these models have included Karolína Kurková, Miranda Kerr, Izabel Goulart, Selita Ebanks, and Marisa Miller. Although some, such as Claudia Schiffer, argued that Bündchen is the only model who comes close to earning the supermodel title.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/2007-09/070904-death-of-the-supermodel.aspx |title=Death of the supermodel |publisher=Vogue.co.uk |date=4 September 2007 |accessdate=7 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://toronto.fashion-monitor.com/news.php/fashion_models/2007090510Claudia-Schiffer |title=Claudia Schiffer: Supermodels Are Extinct |publisher=Toronto.fashion-monitor.com |date=22 October 2006 |accessdate=7 March 2011[/tpl]
American Vogue dubbed ten models (Doutzen Kroes, Agyness Deyn, Hilary Rhoda, Raquel Zimmermann, Coco Rocha, Lily Donaldson, Chanel Iman, Sasha Pivovarova, Caroline Trentini, and Jessica Stam) as the new crop of supermodels in their May 2007 cover story,Vogue's ten covergirls bring personality and attitude to spring's eye-popping prints. Are we witnessing the return of the model? Jonathan Van Meter reports while the likes of Christie Brinkley, Christy Turlington, and Linda Evangelista returned to reclaim prominent contracts from celebrities and younger models.

==Perception==

Critical perception of the supermodel as an industry has been frequent inside and outside the fashion press, from complaints that women desiring this status become unhealthily thin to charges of racism, where the "supermodel" generally has to conform to a Northern European standard of beauty. According to fashion writer Guy Trebay of The New York Times, in 2007, the "android" look is popular, a vacant stare and thin body serving, according to some fashion industry conventions, to set off the couture. This was not always the case. In the 1970s, black, heavier and "ethnic" models dominated the runways but social changes since that time have made the power players in the fashion industry shun suggestions of "otherness".On runways, racial diversity is out Author: Guy Trebay, International Herald Tribune, 23 October 2007.
