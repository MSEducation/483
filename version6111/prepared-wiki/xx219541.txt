Also in 2002, Internet Archive removed all Wayback Machine archival pages of Xenu.net at the request of lawyers for the Church of Scientology. Initially queries reported that the pages had been removed "per the request of the site owner", which Andreas Heldal-Lund denied. This was later changed to a generic "Blocked Site Error" message.[tpl]cite web | first = Lisa M. | last = Bowman | title = Net archive silences Scientology critic | url = http://www.news.com/2100-1023-959236.html |  publisher = CNET | date = 2002-24 September | accessdate = 2007-10-20 [/tpl][tpl]cite web| last = Staff |    title = Blocked Site Error. | work = Wayback Machine  | publisher = Internet Archive | url = http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://xenu.net |   accessdate =  2007-10-27[/tpl]
