[[St John's in the Vale]]

CATEGORIES: Valleys of Cumbria

St John's in the Vale is a glacial valley in the Lake District National Park, Cumbria, England. Within the vale are a number of farms and small settlements, in addition to several disused quarry and mining works. St Johns Beck meanders northward along the floor of the vale, and is the primary route of outflow from Thirlmere reservoir to the south. Alongside the beck runs the B5322, St Johns in the Vale Road.
The vale is in the heart of the northern Lake District and is surrounded by many of the most striking of the Lakeland fells. It runs from south to north, set between the rocky flanks of Clough Head to the east and the neighbours High Rigg and Low Rigg to the west. The southern end of the vale is a narrow pass between High Rigg and Great Dodd, just to the north of the small settlement of Legburthwaite. At its northern end the vale widens to meet the broad east-to-west valley of the River Greta near Threlkeld. The view north from the vale is dominated by the mountains Blencathra and Skiddaw.
High on the western side of the vale lies St Johns in the Vale Church, located in a low pass between High Rigg on the southern side and Low Rigg to the north. This pass provides access for suitably capable vehicles between the vale and Dale Bottom in the Naddle Valley to the west of High Rigg. The present building dates from 1845, with the earliest reference to a church at the site being 1554.[tpl]cite web|title=VisitCumbria.com|url=http://www.visitcumbria.com/kes/chk8.htm|accessdate=27 October 2006[/tpl] On the opposite side of the vale, cut into the northern flank of Clough Head, lies the Threlkeld Quarry and Mining Museum. This former commercial quarry, first opened in the late nineteenth century, was established as a museum in 1992.[tpl]cite web|title=ThrelkeldMiningMuseum.co.uk|url=http://www.threlkeldminingmuseum.co.uk/history.htm|accessdate=27 October 2006[/tpl]
