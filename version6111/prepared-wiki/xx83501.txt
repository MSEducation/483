==Biography==

===Early life and career===

Van Helden was born to an Indo (Dutch-Indonesian) father and a French-Lebanese mother but traveled around the world as a child, spending time in the Netherlands, Latvia, Turkey, and Italy as his father was a member of the U.S. Air Force. At the age of 13, he bought a drum machine and started DJing two years later.IMO Records. “Armand Van Helden Biography", IMO Records, London, Retrieved on 25 January 2012.

He returned to Boston in 1988, moonlighting as a DJ in Boston clubs. He attended college in Boston. He quit his legal-review job in 1991 to work as a remixer under the management of Neil Petricone and X-Mix. He took up a DJ residency at the Loft, a top Boston nightclub at the time. He released his first official single, a mix of Deep Creed's "Stay On My Mind" through Nervous Records.
He released "Move It To the Left" (credited to Sultans of Swing) in 1992 on the Strictly Rhythm label, which became a moderate club hit and led to a string of singles released under several monikers for that label. His first track to make the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart was "Witch Doktor," which made the top 5 in 1994, and led to opportunities to remix acts such as New Order, Deep Forest, Jimmy Somerville, Deee-Lite, and Faithless.
However, it was the "Professional Widow" remix that established him and became a dance hit around the world as well as a number-one hit in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, Van Helden did not receive a penny for this remix because he presented it non-commissioned and, thus, was not entitled to compensation[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl]. However, it led to work remixing the Rolling Stones, Janet Jackson, Katy Perry, Britney Spears, and Puff Daddy, as well as Daft Punk and Sneaker Pimps, adding to his reputation as one of the world's top house-music musicians.
"Cha Cha" was another top-ten dance hit from his first album, Old School Junkies: The Album, which was released in 1996, along with "The Funk Phenomena." A greatest hits album appeared the next year, followed by a breakbeat album later in 1997. "U Don't Know Me" was a number two hit on the Billboard dance chart, a number one hit in the United Kingdom, and a top 20 single on the pop charts in Australia and Canada. The song was the breakout track from his 2Future4U album, which was released stateside on Armand's own label, Armed Records.
Van Helden released the Killing Puritans album in 2000 (also on Armed Records), which contained the hit "Koochy". The track was based around Gary Numan's five times UK chart hit, "Cars". His single "Why Can't You Free Some Time" made it to number 34 in the UK in 2001. His New York: A Mix Odyssey album released in 2004 produced two hits: "Hear My Name", a collaboration with Spalding Rockwell that reached number 7 on the Billboard dance chart, number 34 in the UK, and the top 40 in Australia; and "My My My", which reached number 4 on the world internet charts, number 5 in the Belgian and Dutch charts, number 6 in Australia, number 15 in the UK, and top 30 in the world dance charts.

===2014===

On Van Helden’s latest tune “Power of Bass”, a collaboration with Cheap Thrills label boss Hervé, it is apparent that the Grammy nominated producer hasn't slowed down in the slightest, especially if you’ve followed he and A-Trak’s Duck Sauce project. “Power of Bass”, is a monster of a future house tune, kicking off almost immediately with a throwback synth line that only artists in the genre with as much experience as these two could put over; but also draws from their current contemporary takes on four-four dance rhythms. Carefully layed swells and high energy hi-hats fuel its heart, and when they’re paired with such a choice baseline, as a listener there is no other choice but to start twerking your proverbial stuff. The colossal club track is forthcoming from the almighty Ministry of Sound Recordings out of the U.K., 
Duck Sauce, the DJ duo of A-Trak and Armand Van Helden, are finally releasing a full-length debut album to follow their long string of singles. It's called Quack and it's out on April 15 through Fool's Gold.
