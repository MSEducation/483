==Controversy==

In July 2013, controversy emerged when it was revealed that St Lucy's Priory had terminated the employment of a teacher who had married a partner of the same-sex, following changes to California's marriage law. Ken Bencomo had taught at the school for 17 years and was gay, but had his contract terminated by Assistant Principal Sister Helen Dziuk after a photograph of the marriage appeared in a local newspaper. He was told that his marriage violated the church's teachings, in the wake of statements by Pope Francis concerning gay marriage, including: "Who am I to judge?"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/07/31/pope-francis-kimmel-letterman-conan-gay-priests/2602339/ A public petition was launched calling for his reinstatement.[tpl]cite news |last=Hernandez |first=Greg |title=After 17 years at Catholic school in California, gay teacher is fired for marrying his partner |url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/after-17-years-catholic-school-california-gay-teacher-fired-marrying-his-partner020813 |newspaper=GayStarNews |date=August 1, 2013 |quote=More than 10,000 people have signed petition[/tpl]
