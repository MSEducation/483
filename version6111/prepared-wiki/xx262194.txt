==Religion==

Givot Olam founder Tovia Luskin was drawn to the Meged site after interpreting a geological survey of the area in 1988 as confirming a biblical passage in the Book of Deuteronomy (33:15) and its associated commentary by Rashi.[tpl]cite news|last=Shamah|first=David|title=Oil magnate: Israeli tech can solve the world’s energy crisis, if red tape doesn’t tie it up|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/oil-magnate-tovia-luskin-israeli-tech-can-solve-the-worlds-energy-crisis/|accessdate=4 May 2012|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=25 April 2012[/tpl] According to the Chabad religious movement, Luskin visited the Lubavitcher Rebbe in New York in 1990 and received a blessing from him.[tpl]cite web|last=Yisraeli|first=David|title=Blessings Materialize: Oil Production in Israel|url=http://www.chabad.info/index.php?url=article_en&id=23482|publisher=Chabad|accessdate=30 January 2012|date=10 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Yeshayahou|first=Koby|title=Chabad article boosts Givot's share price|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000653332&fid=1725|accessdate=30 January 2012|newspaper=Globes|date=12 June 2011[/tpl]

==Land rights==

Efraim Sneh has stated that although the oil drilling site is in Israel the oil reservoir may extend to the West Bank near the West Bank village of Rantis. Sneh suggested that cooperation between the Israeli and Palestinian sides could lead to the construction of a joint oil pipeline.[tpl]cite news|last=Barkat|first=Amiram|title='Givot can meet 10% of Israel's oil consumption'|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000734556&fid=1725|accessdate=1 April 2012|newspaper=Globes|date=19 March 2012[/tpl]

==Controversy==

With the location of Meged Oil field directly next to the border between Israel and the West Bank, which is under control of the Palestinian National Authority, it remains controversial. 
Palestinians claim, that only after the creation of the Israeli West Bank barrier that annexed the oil field, which was originally located within the borders of the Palestinian city of Ramallah, Givot Olam declared to have made it commercially viable to drill.[tpl]cite web|title=Israel is stealing Palestinian oil and gas|url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/middle-east/6331-israel-is-stealing-palestinian-oil-and-gas|publisher=Middle East Monitor|accessdate=19 June 2013[/tpl]
According to a source in the Palestinian Authority, eighty percent of the Meged oil field is on land owned by Palestinians.[tpl]cite news|last=Mar'i|first=Mohammed|title=PA accuses Israel of drilling for oil in West Bank|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/403761|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=Arab News|date=13 January 2012[/tpl]
Feb 18, 2014 - Givot Olam Oil ousts CEO Tovia Luskin, who began serving as Givot CEO on August 13, 2010, and has appointed special consultant IDF Major General (res.) Giora Eiland as acting CEO.
The company said that the official reason for his ouster was "disagreements with and dissatisfaction of the board of directors about his performance as CEO."
