, Vol. 1, §10–1 and §10–2.[/ref]
The air changes direction as it passes the airfoil and follows a path that is curved. Whenever airflow changes direction, a reaction force is generated opposite to the directional change.[ref]"Lift is a force generated by turning a moving fluid...  If the body is shaped, moved, or inclined in such a way as to produce a net deflection or turning of the flow, the local velocity is changed in magnitude, direction, or both. Changing the velocity creates a net force on the body."
</ref>

====Pressure differences====

Lift may also be described in terms of air pressure: pressure is the normal force per unit area. Wherever there is net force there is also a pressure difference, thus deflection/flow turning indicates the presence of a net force and therefore a pressure difference. The direction of the net force implies that the average pressure on the upper surface of the wing is lower than the average pressure on the underside.A uniform pressure surrounding a body does not create a net force. (See buoyancy). Therefore pressure differences are needed to exert a force on a body immersed in a fluid. For example, see: [tpl]Citation |first=G.K. |last=Batchelor |authorlink=George Batchelor |title=An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics |year=1967 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-66396-2 |pages=14–15 [/tpl][ref]
</ref><ref name=Babinsky>"''...if a streamline is curved, there must be a pressure gradient across the streamline...''"
</ref>
Whenever a fluid follows a curved path, there is a pressure gradient perpendicular to the flow direction. This direct relationship between curved streamlines and pressure differences was derived from Newton's second law by Leonhard Euler in 1754:
where R is the radius of curvature, p is the pressure, ρ is the density, and v is the velocity.  This formula shows that higher velocities and tighter curvatures create larger pressure differentials and that for straight flow (R → ∞) the pressure difference is zero.Thus a distribution of the pressure is created which is given in Euler's equation. The physical reason is the aerofoil which forces the streamline to follow its curved surface. The low pressure at the upper side of the aerofoil is a consequence of the curved surface." A comparison of explanations of the aerodynamic lifting force Klaus Weltner  Am. J. Phys. Vol.55 No.January 1, 1987 pg 53 http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&id=AJPIAS000055000001000050000001&idtype=cvips&doi=10.1119/1.14960&prog=normal

====Flow on both sides of the wing====

In the picture above, observe that the air is turned both above and below the wing so both the upper and lower surface contribute to the flow turning and therefore the lift.  In fact, for typical airfoils at subsonic speeds the top surface contributes more flow turning than the bottom surface, and the pressure deviation along the top is significantly larger than along the bottom. A common explanation describes lift as merely the result of the air molecules bouncing off the lower surface of the wing, but since this ignores the airflow around the top of the wing it usually leads to incorrect results. However, at hypersonic speeds, this model becomes applicable.[tpl]cite web|last=NASA|first=Glenn Research Center|title=Aerodynamic Forces|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/presar.html|accessdate=August 15, 2011[/tpl]"...newtonian theory is used frequently to estimate the pressure distribution of a hypersonic body."

====Angle of attack====

The angle of attack is the angle between an airfoil and the oncoming air.  A symmetrical airfoil will generate zero lift at zero angle of attack. But as the angle of attack increases, the air is deflected through a larger angle and the vertical component of the airstream velocity increases, resulting in more lift.  For small angles a symmetrical airfoil will generate a lift force roughly proportional to the angle of attack."You can argue that the main lift comes from the fact that the wing is angled slightly upward so that air striking the underside of the wing is forced downward. The Newton's 3rd law reaction force upward on the wing provides the lift. Increasing the angle of attack can increase the lift, but it also increases drag so that you have to provide more thrust with the aircraft engines" hyperphysics Georgia State University Department of Physics and Astronomy http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/fluids/angatt.html"If we enlarge the angle of attack we enlarge the deflection of the airstream by the airfoil. This results in the enlargement of the vertical component of the velocity of the airstream... we may expect that the lifting force depends linearly on the angle of attack. This dependency is in complete agreement with the results of experiments..." Klaus Weltner A comparison of explanations of the aerodynamic lifting force Am. J. Phys. 55(1), January 1987 pg 52
As the angle of attack grows larger, the lift reaches a maximum at some angle; increasing the angle of attack beyond this critical angle of attack causes the air to become turbulent and separate from the wing; there is less deflection downward so the airfoil generates less lift.  The airfoil is said to be stalled."The decrease of angles exceeding 25° is plausible.  For large angles of attack we get turbulence and thus less deflection downward." Klaus Weltner A comparison of explanations of the aerodynamic lifting force Am. J. Phys. 55(1), January 1987 pg 52
Cambered airfoils will generate lift at zero angle of attack. When the chordline is horizontal, the trailing edge has a downward direction and since the air follows the trailing edge it is deflected downward."With an angle of attack of 0°, we can explain why we already have a lifting force.  The air stream behind the aerofoil follows the trailing edge.  The trailing edge already has a downward direction, if the chord to the middle line of the profile is horizontal." Klaus Weltner A comparison of explanations of the aerodynamic lifting force Am. J. Phys. 55(1), January 1987 pg 52  When a cambered airfoil is upside down, the angle of attack can be adjusted so that the lift force is upwards. This explains how a plane can fly upside down."...the important thing about an aerofoil (say an aircraft wing) is not so much that its upper surface is humped and its lower surface is nearly flat, but simply that it moves through the air at an angle.  This also avoids the otherwise difficult paradox that an aircraft can fly upside down!" N. H. Fletcher Mechanics of Flight Physics Education July 1975 http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9120/10/5/009/pdf/0031-9120_10_5_009.pdf"It requires adjustment of the angle of attack, but as clearly demonstrated in almost every air show, it can be done." hyperphysics Georgia State University Department of Physics and Astronomy  http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/fluids/airfoil.html#c2

===Bernoulli's principle: lift, pressure, and speed===

Bernoulli's principle states that within an airflow of constant energy, when the air flows through a region of lower pressure it speeds up and vice versa."A complete statement of Bernoulli's Theorem is as follows: "In a flow where no energy is being added or taken away, the sum of its various energies is a constant: consequently where the velocity increasees the pressure decreases and vice versa."" Norman F Smith Bernoulli, Newton and Dynamic Lift Part I School Science and Mathematics Vol 73 Issue 3 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1949-8594.1973.tb08998.x/pdf Thus, there is a direct mathematical relationship between the pressure and the speed, so if one knows the speed at all points within the airflow one can calculate the pressure, and vice versa. For any airfoil generating lift, there must be a pressure imbalance, i.e. lower average air pressure on the top than on the bottom.  Bernoulli's principle states that this pressure difference must be accompanied by a speed difference.
Bernoulli's principle does not explain why the air flows faster over the top of the wing; to explain that requires some other physical reasoning."Although the Bernoulli principle can be used to determine the net force and the lifting force upon a solid body once the pressure and velocity distribution around the body have been specified, this flow regime is a consequence of viscosity, and cannot be explained without recourse to the Coanda effect, circulation, and the curvature of the wing. Hence the Bernoulli principle explanation is subservient to an explanation of lift which employs the latter concepts." Gordon McCabe Explanation and discovery in aerodynamics http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2573/1/aero.pdf  It is in providing that additional reasoning where some explanations oversimplify things.

====Conservation of mass====

If one takes the experimentally observed flow around an airfoil as a starting point, then lift can be explained in terms of pressures using Bernoulli's principle  and conservation of mass.
Returning to the picture from the previous section, the flow approaching an airfoil can be divided into  streamtubes, which are defined based on the area between two streamlines.  By definition, fluid never crosses a streamline in a steady flow.  Assuming that the air is incompressible, the rate of flow (e.g. liters or gallons per minute) must be constant within each streamtube since matter is not created or destroyed.  If a streamtube becomes narrower, the flow speed must increase in the narrower region to maintain the constant flow rate. This idea is called "conservation of mass", and for incompressible flow mass is conserved within each streamtube.[ref]"The effect of squeezing streamlines together as they divert around the front of
an airfoil shape is that the velocity must increase to keep the mass flow constant since the area between the streamlines has become smaller."  Charles N. Eastlake An Aerodynamicist’s View of Lift, Bernoulli, and Newton THE PHYSICS TEACHER  Vol. 40, March 2002 http://www.df.uba.ar/users/sgil/physics_paper_doc/papers_phys/fluids/Bernoulli_Newton_lift.pdf[/ref]
The picture shows that the upper stream tubes constrict as they flow up and around the airfoil. Conservation of mass says that the flow speed must increase as the stream tube area decreases. Similarly, the lower stream tubes expand and the flow slows down.
From Bernoulli's principle, the pressure on the upper surface where the flow is moving faster is lower than the pressure on the lower surface where it is moving slower. The pressure difference thus creates a net aerodynamic force, pointing upward and downstream to the flow direction. The component of the force perpendicular to the free stream is lift; the component parallel to the freestream is drag. In conjunction with this force by the air on the airfoil, the airfoil imparts an equal-and-opposite force on the surrounding air that creates the downwash, in accordance with Newton's third law. Measuring the momentum transferred to the downwash is another way to determine the amount of lift on the airfoil.[ref]

====Limitations of explanations based on Bernoulli's principle====

still. After the passage of the wing there is a great deal of air in motion. A 250-ton jet at
cruse speed is doing a lot of work to stay in the air. Much of the fuel that is burned is
adding energy to the air to create lift. Thus the Bernoulli equation is not applicable." The Newtonian Description of Lift of a Wing-Revised David F. Anderson & Scott Eberhardt http://home.comcast.net/~clipper-108/Lift_AAPT.pdf[/ref]"Although the Bernoulli equation is very useful for qualatative descriptions of many features of fluid flow, such descriptions are often grossly inaccurate when compared with the quantitative results of experiments.  Prominent reasons for the discrepancies are that gasses like air are hardly incompressible, and liquids like water are hardly inviscid, which invalidates the assumptions made in deriving the Bernoulli equation. In addition it is often difficult to maintain steady, streamlined flow without turbulence, and the introduction of turbulence can greatly affect the results" Paul A.

===A more detailed physical description===

Lift is generated in accordance with the fundamental principles of physics. The most relevant physics reduce to three principles:"Analysis of fluid flow is typically presented to engineering students in terms of three fundamental principles: conservation of mass, conservation of momentum, and conservation of energy." Charles N. Eastlake An Aerodynamicist’s View of Lift, Bernoulli, and Newton THE PHYSICS TEACHER  Vol. 40, March 2002 http://www.df.uba.ar/users/sgil/physics_paper_doc/papers_phys/fluids/Bernoulli_Newton_lift.pdf
In addition, one needs an expression relating the fluid stresses (consisting of pressure and shear stress components) to the properties of the flow.[tpl]Citation |first=G.K. |last=Batchelor |authorlink=George Batchelor |title=An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics |year=1967 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-66396-2 |pages=141–151 [/tpl][ref]"The main relationships comprising the NS equations are the basic conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy. To have a complete equation set we also need an equation
of state relating temperature, pressure, and density, and formulas defining the other required gas properties." Doug McLean Understanding Aerodynamics: Arguing from the Real Physics  page 14 Wiley Print ISBN 9781119967514 Online ISBN 9781118454190 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118454190.ch3/pdf[/ref] The pressure depends on the other flow properties, such as its mass density, through the (thermodynamic) equation of state, while the shear stresses are related to the flow through the air's viscosity.

====Navier–Stokes and Euler equations====

The above conditions can be expressed as partial differential equations that constrain the fluid flow.  Unlike the physics of rigid bodies where the equations of motion describe the physical location of the rigid body, fluid dynamics describes the flow as a velocity field, i.e. a solution associates each point in space with a vector that represents the speed and direction of the flow at that point.  Once the velocity field is solved for, other quantities of interest may be computed from the velocity field. For instance, Bernoulli's equation can be used to determine the pressure at each point on the airfoil from the speed of the velocity field. The pressures can then be "added up" (integrated) to determine the net aerodynamic force.
Application of the viscous shear stresses to Newton's second law for an airflow results in the Navier–Stokes equations. These equations are notoriously difficult to solve, but in many instances approximations suffice for a good description of lifting airfoils. In large parts of the flow viscosity may be neglected; such an inviscid flow can be described mathematically through the Euler equations, resulting from the Navier-Stokes equations when the viscosity is neglected.  Neither the Navier-Stokes equations nor the Euler equations lend themselves to exact analytic solutions; usually engineers have to resort to numerical solutions to solve them, but Euler's equation can be solved by making further simplifying assumptions.Jaakko Hoffren Quest for an Improved Explanation of Lift Section 4.3 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 2001 http://corsair.flugmodellbau.de/files/area2/LIFT.PDF

====Potential flow, the Kutta condition, and circulation====

One further simplifying approximation is to assume that the flow is irrotational, i.e. that the flow does not rotate around itself.  Mathematically, this is expressed by saying that the curl of the flow field is everywhere equal to zero.  Irrotational flows have two nice properties: 1) an irrotational flow can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function called a potential (the flow is then called potential flow)  2) solutions to complicated flows can be expressed as the sum of simpler flow fields.  These two properties make the calculations tractable.[ref]"...whenever the velocity field is irrotational, it can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function we
call a velocity potential φ:  V = ∇φ. The existence of a velocity potential can greatly simplify the analysis of inviscid flows by way of potential-flow theory..." Doug McLean Understanding Aerodynamics: Arguing from the Real Physics p 26 Wiley http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118454190.ch3/pdf[/ref]Elements of Potential Flow California State University Los Angeles http://instructional1.calstatela.edu/cwu/me408/Slides/PotentialFlow/PotentialFlow.htm
In particular, solutions can be expressed as the sum of a uniform flow (i.e.  a steady flow equal to the free stream velocity) plus a free vortex flow, i.e. a circular flow around the airfoil with the speed inversely proportional to the radius.""...we can visualize the true flow over an airfoil...as the superposition of a uniform flow and a circulatory flow..." John D Anderson Introduction to Flight 4th Ed. pg 325  (Vortex flow is irrotational, except at the center of its circulation; since the center is inside the airfoil, the flow itself remains irrotational.)  A vortex flow of any strength may be added to this uniform flow and the equation is solved, thus there are many flows that solve the Euler equations.IRROTATIONAL PLANE FLOWS OF AN INVISCID FLUID UNIVERSITY OF GENOA FACULTY OF ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING http://www.diam.unige.it/~irro/lecture_e.html
In order to arrive at a unique (physical) solution, one can apply the Kutta condition, which says that for steady flow the rear stagnation point is coincident with the trailing edge of the airfoil. The magnitude of the vortex flow is adjusted so that the Kutta condition is met.  Another way to say this is that the airflow around the airfoil develops enough vorticity to satisfy the Kutta condition.  Vorticity is measured by a number called the circulation, so an airfoil in a steady flow will develop sufficient circulation to satisfy the Kutta condition.
The image to the right shows the streamlines over a NACA 0012 airfoil computed using potential flow theory and applying the Kutta condition as a boundary condition.Potential Flow over a NACA Four-Digit Airfoil from the Wolfram Demonstrations Project http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/PotentialFlowOverANACAFourDigitAirfoil/ The stagnation streamline is the streamline that intersects the airfoil.  In the front it typically intersects the arifoil on the lower surface near the leading edge. The stagnation streamline leaves the airfoil at the sharp trailing edge, according to the Kutta condition.
The physical interpretation of circulation is that the vortex flow adds to the uniform flow above the wing and subtracts from it below the wing.  Thus, the speed of the air above the wing is higher than below it, as can be seen in the narrower streamtube.  By Bernoulli's principle, this implies a pressure difference and therefore lift. The amount of lift is directly proportional to the circulation.[ref]"On the top side of the airfoil, the circulation vectors are in the same direction as the free stream direction, therefore causing the flow to speed up. This increase in speed means lower pressures (according to Bernoulli's equation). On the bottom
side of the airfoil, the circulation vector is opposite the general flow direction so the fluid tends to be slowed down resulting in increased pressure. The difference in pressure forces between the top and bottom sides of an airfoil are what gives us lift." Arvel Gentry The Origins of Lift January 2006 http://www.arvelgentry.com/techs/origins_of_lift.pdf[/ref]

====Flowfield formation====

Consider the case of an airfoil accelerating from rest in a viscous flow. When there is no flow, there is no lift and the aerodynamic forces acting on the airfoil are zero. At the instant when the flow is “turned on”, the flow is undeflected downstream of the airfoil and there are two stagnation points on the airfoil (where the flow velocity is zero): one near the leading edge on the bottom surface, and another on the upper surface near the trailing edge. The dividing line between the upper and lower streamtubes intersects the body at the stagnation points. Since the flow speed is zero at these points, by Bernoulli's principle the static pressure at these points is at a maximum.  As long as the second stagnation point is at its initial location on the upper surface of the wing, the circulation around the airfoil is zero and, in accordance with the Kutta–Joukowski theorem, there is no lift.  The net pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces is zero.[tpl]citation|last=Karamacheti|first=Krishnamurty|title=Principles of Ideal-Fluid Aerodynamics|year=1980|edition=Reprint|publisher=Robert E. Krieger[/tpl]
The effects of viscosity are contained within a thin layer of fluid called the boundary layer, close to the body.  As flow over the airfoil commences, the flow along the lower surface turns at the sharp trailing edge and flows along the upper surface towards the upper stagnation point.  The flow in the vicinity of the sharp trailing edge is very fast and the resulting viscous forces cause the boundary layer to accumulate into a vortex on the upper side of the airfoil between the trailing edge and the upper stagnation point.Clancy, L.J., Aerodynamics, Figure 4.7  This is called the starting vortex.  The starting vortex and the bound vortex around the surface of the wing are two halves of a closed loop.  As the starting vortex increases in strength the bound vortex also strengthens, causing the flow over the upper surface of the airfoil to accelerate and drive the upper stagnation point towards the sharp trailing edge.  As this happens, the starting vortex is shed into the wake,Clancy, L.J., Aerodynamics, Figure 4.8 and is a necessary condition to produce lift on an airfoil. If the flow were stopped, there would be a corresponding "stopping vortex".[tpl]citation|last=White|first=Frank M.|title=Fluid Mechanics|year=2002|edition=5th|publisher=McGraw Hill[/tpl] Despite being an idealization of the real world, the “vortex system” set up around a wing is both real and observable; the trailing vortex sheet most noticeably rolls up into wing-tip vortices.
The upper stagnation point continues moving downstream until it is coincident with the sharp trailing edge (as stated by the Kutta condition). The flow downstream of the airfoil is deflected downward from the free-stream direction and, from the reasoning above in the basic explanation, there is now a net pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces and an aerodynamic force is generated.

===Other alternative explanations for the generation of lift===

Many other alternative explanations for the generation of lift by an airfoil have been put forward,  a few of which are presented here. Most of them are intended to explain the phenomenon of lift to a general audience. Although the explanations may share features in common with the explanations above, additional assumptions and simplifications may be introduced. This can reduce the validity of an alternative explanation to a limited sub-class of lift generating conditions, or might not allow a quantitative analysis. Several theories introduce assumptions which proved to be wrong, like the equal transit-time theory.

====False explanation based on equal transit-time====

Basic or popular sources often describe the "Equal Transit-Time" theory of lift, which incorrectly assumes that the parcels of air that divide at the leading edge of an airfoil must rejoin at the trailing edge, forcing the air traveling along the longer upper surface to go faster. Bernoulli's Principle is then cited to conclude that since the air moves slower along the bottom of the wing, the air pressure must be higher, pushing the wing up."The airfoil of the airplane wing, according to the textbook explanation that is more or less standard in the United States, has a special shape with more curvature on top than on the bottom; consequently, the air must travel farther over the top surface than over the bottom surface.  Because the air must make the trip over the top and bottom surfaces in the same elapsed time ..., the velocity over the top surface will be greater than over the bottom.  According to Bernoulli's theorem, this velocity difference produces a pressure difference which is lift." Bernoulli and Newton in Fluid Mechanics Norman F. Smith The Physics Teacher  November 1972 Volume 10, Issue 8, pp. 451  http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&id=PHTEAH000010000008000451000001&idtype=cvips&doi=10.1119/1.2352317&prog=normal
However, there is no physical principle that requires equal transit time and experimental results show that this assumption is false. In fact, the air moving over the top of an airfoil generating lift moves much faster than the equal transit theory predicts.[ref]"The actual velocity over the top of an airfoil is much faster than that predicted by the "Longer Path" theory and particles moving over the top arrive at the trailing edge before particles moving under the airfoil."
[/ref] Further, the theory violates Newton's third law of motion, since it describes a force on the wing with no opposite force."Unfortunately, this explanation falls to earth on three counts.  First, an airfoil need not have more curvature on its top than on its bottom.  Airplanes can and do fly with perfectly symmetrical airfoils; that is with airfoils that have the same curvature top and bottom. Second, even if a humped-up (cambered) shape is used, the claim that the air must traverse the curved top surface in the same time as it does the flat bottom surface...is fictional.  We can quote no physical law that tells us this.  Third – and this is the most serious – the common textbook explanation, and the diagrams that accompany it, describe a force on the wing with no net disturbance to the airstream.  This constitutes a violation of Newton's third law." Bernoulli and Newton in Fluid Mechanics Norman F. Smith The Physics Teacher  November 1972 Volume 10, Issue 8, pp. 451  http://tpt.aapt.org/resource/1/phteah/v10/i8[ref]

The assertion that the air must arrive simultaneously at the trailing edge is sometimes referred to as the "Equal Transit-Time Fallacy".[ref]A false explanation for lift has been put forward in mainstream books, and even in scientific exhibitions. Known as the "equal transit-time" explanation, it states that the parcels of air which are divided by an airfoil must rejoin again; because of the greater curvature (and hence longer path) of the upper surface of an aerofoil, the air going over the top must go faster in order to "catch up" with the air flowing around the bottom. Therefore, because of its higher speed the pressure of the air above the airfoil must be lower. Despite the fact that this "explanation" is probably the most common of all, it is false.
It has recently been dubbed the "Equal transit-time fallacy".

====Coandă effect====

In a limited sense, the Coandă effect refers to the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to an adjacent surface that curves away from the flow, and the resultant entrainment of ambient air into the flow. The effect is named for Henri Coandă, the Romanian aerodynamicist who exploited it in many of his patents.
More broadly, some consider the effect to include the tendency of any fluid boundary layer to adhere to a curved surface, not just the boundary layer accompanying a fluid jet. It is in this broader sense that the Coandă effect is used by some to explain why the air flow remains attached to the top side of an airfoil.[tpl]Citation |url=http://www.allstar.fiu.edu/AERO/airflylvl3.htm|last=Anderson|first=David|last2=Eberhart|first2=Scott|title=How Airplanes Fly: A Physical Description of Lift|year=1999|accessdate=June 4, 2008[/tpl] Jef Raskin,[ref]
