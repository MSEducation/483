Indonesia is an archipelago comprising 13,466 islands."The Naming Procedures of Indonesia’s Islands", Tenth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names, New York, 31 July – 9 August 2012, United Nations Economic and Social Council It encompasses 33 provinces and 1 Special Administrative Region (for being governed by a pre-colonial monarchy) with over 238 million people, making it the world's fourth most populous country. Indonesia's republic form of government comprises an elected legislature and president. The nation's capital city is Jakarta. The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and Malaysia. Other neighboring countries include Singapore, the Philippines, Australia, Palau, and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Indonesia is a founding member of ASEAN and a member of the G-20 major economies. The Indonesian economy is the world's 16th largest by nominal GDP.
The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the 7th century, when Srivijaya and then later Majapahit traded with China and India. Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign cultural, religious and political models from the early centuries CE, and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished. Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources. Muslim traders brought the now-dominant Islam, while European powers brought Christianity and fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery. Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism, Indonesia secured its independence after World War II. Indonesia's history has since been turbulent, with challenges posed by natural disasters, corruption, separatism, a democratization process, and periods of rapid economic change.
Indonesia consists of hundreds of distinct native ethnic and linguistic groups. The largest – and politically dominant – ethnic group are the Javanese. A shared identity has developed, defined by a national language, ethnic diversity, religious pluralism within a majority Muslim population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. Indonesia's national motto, "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika" ("Unity in Diversity" literally, "many, yet one"), articulates the diversity that shapes the country. Despite its large population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world's second highest level of biodiversity. The country has abundant natural resources, yet poverty remains widespread.[tpl]cite journal |title=Poverty in Indonesia: Always with them |journal=The Economist |date=14 September 2006 |accessdate=26 December 2006 |url= http://www.economist.com/node/7925064?story_id=7925064[/tpl]; correction.[tpl]cite journal | last =Guerin |first=G | title = Don't count on a Suharto accounting |journal=Asia Times Online | location = Hong Kong |date=23 May 2006 |url= http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HE23Ae01.html[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The name Indonesia derives from the Greek words Indós and nèsos, which means "island".[tpl]cite book | last = Tomascik | first = T | coauthors=Mah, JA, Nontji, A, Moosa, MK |title = The Ecology of the Indonesian Seas – Part One | publisher = Periplus Editions | year = 1996 | location = Hong Kong | isbn = 962-593-078-7[/tpl] The name dates to the 18th century, far predating the formation of independent Indonesia.[tpl]id icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news | last=Anshory |first=Irfan |title=Asal Usul Nama Indonesia |publisher=Pikiran Rakyat |date= 16 August 2004 | url = http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0804/16/0802.htm |accessdate=5 October 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061215190155/http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0804/16/0802.htm |archivedate = 15 December 2006|deadurl=yes[/tpl] In 1850, George Windsor Earl, an English ethnologist, proposed the terms Indunesians — and, his preference, Malayunesians — for the inhabitants of the "Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago".[tpl]cite journal |last=Earl |first= George SW |title=On The Leading Characteristics of the Papuan, Australian and Malay-Polynesian Nations |journal= Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia (JIAEA) |year=1850 |page = 119[/tpl] In the same publication, a student of Earl's, James Richardson Logan, used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago.[tpl]cite journal |last=Logan |first= James Richardson | title = The Ethnology of the Indian Archipelago: Embracing Enquiries into the Continental Relations of the Indo-Pacific Islanders | journal = Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia (JIAEA) |year=1850 |pages=4:252–347[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Earl |first=George SW |title= On The Leading Characteristics of the Papuan, Australian and Malay-Polynesian Nations |journal= Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia (JIAEA) |year=1850 |pages= 254, 277–8[/tpl] However, Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia. Instead, they used the terms Malay Archipelago (Maleische Archipel); the Netherlands East Indies (Nederlandsch Oost Indië), popularly Indië; the East (de Oost); and Insulinde.[tpl]cite journal |title = The Term Indonesia: Its Origin and Usage |journal= Journal of the American Oriental Society |author = Justus M van der Kroef | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 166–71 | year = 1951 | doi =10.2307/595186 |jstor=595186[/tpl]
After 1900, the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands, and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression. Adolf Bastian, of the University of Berlin, popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayischen Archipels, 1884–1894. The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat (Ki Hajar Dewantara), when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913.

Fossils and the remains of tools show that the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited by Homo erectus, popularly known as "Java Man", between 1.5 million years ago and as recently as 35,000 years ago.[tpl]cite journal|title=Shell tool use by early members of Homo erectus in Sangiran, central Java, Indonesia: cut mark evidence |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2006.03.013|year=2007|last1=Choi|first1=Kildo|last2=Driwantoro|first2=Dubel|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=34|page=48[/tpl]Finding showing human ancestor older than previously thought offers new insights into evolution.

Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population, migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan.

Although Muslim traders first traveled through Southeast Asia early in the Islamic era, the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra.Ricklefs (1991), pp. 3–14 Other Indonesian areas gradually adopted Islam, and it was the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century. For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia, particularly in Java.Ricklefs (1991), pp. 12–14 The first regular contact between Europeans and the peoples of Indonesia began in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by Francisco Serrão, sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in Maluku.Ricklefs (1991), pp. 22–24 Dutch and British traders followed. In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and became the dominant European power. Following bankruptcy, the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800, and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony.Ricklefs (1991), p. 24
For most of the colonial period, Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous outside of coastal strongholds; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia's present boundaries.Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java. The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java, Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku, and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces.([tpl]Cite journal|title=A Nation in Waiting: Indonesia's Search for Stability. 2nd Edition|location=St Leonards, NSW |publisher=Allen & Unwin. | last = Schwartz | year = 1999|pages = 3–4[/tpl] Japanese occupation during the Second World War ended Dutch ruleRicklefs (1991)[tpl]cite journal | title = Dutch Attitudes towards Colonial Empires, Indigenous Cultures, and Slaves |journal= Eighteenth-Century Studies | volume=31 |issue=3 | author = Gert Oostindie and Bert Paasman |pages=349–55 |year=1998 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/eighteenth-century_studies/v031/31.3oostindie.html |doi= 10.1353/ecs.1998.0021[/tpl] and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement.[tpl]Cite journal | url = http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+id0029) | publisher = Library of Congress | year = 1992 | title = Indonesia: World War II and the Struggle For Independence, 1942–50; The Japanese Occupation, 1942–45[/tpl] A later UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia as a result of the Japanese occupation.Cited in: Dower, John W.

In contrast to Sukarno's anti-imperialistic antipathy to western powers and tensions with Malaysia, Indonesia's foreign relations since the Suharto "New Order" have been based on economic and political cooperation with Western nations.[tpl]cite web |title=Indonesia – Foreign Policy |work=U.S. Library of Congress |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/indonesia/97.htm |accessdate=5 May 2007[/tpl] Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia, and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit. The nation restored relations with the People's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era. Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950,Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on 20 January 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. It announced its intention to "resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities" on 19 September 1966, and was invited to re-join the UN on 28 September 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC, now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation).

==Administrative divisions==

Administratively, Indonesia consists of 34 provinces, five of which have special status. Each province has its own legislature and governor. The provinces are subdivided into regencies (kabupaten) and cities (kota), which are further subdivided into districts (kecamatan or distrik in Papua and West Papua), and again into administrative villages (either desa, kelurahan, kampung, nagari in West Sumatra, or gampong in Aceh). Village is the lowest level of government administration in Indonesia. Furthermore, a village is divided into several community groups (Rukun-Warga (RW)) which are further divided into neighbourhood groups (Rukun-Tetangga (RT)). In Java the desa (village) is divided further into smaller units called dusun or dukuh (hamlets), these units are the same as Rukun-Warga. Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001, the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units, responsible for providing most government services. The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen's daily life and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa (village chief).
The provinces of Aceh, Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Papua, and West Papua have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces. The Acehnese government, for example, has the right to create certain elements of an independent legal system; in 2003, it instituted a form of Sharia Law (Islamic law).[tpl]cite journal |author=Michelle Ann Miller |title=The Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam law: a serious response to Acehnese separatism? |journal=Asian Ethnicity |volume=5 |issue=3 |year=2004 |pages=333–351 |doi=10.1080/1463136042000259789[/tpl] Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution and its willingness to join Indonesia as a republic.The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam, respectively, much like a sultanate.

In the 1960s the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability, a young and inexperienced government, and economic nationalism, which resulted in severe poverty and hunger. By the time of Sukarno's downfall in the mid-1960s, the economy was in chaos with 1,000% annual inflation, shrinking export revenues, crumbling infrastructure, factories operating at minimal capacity, and negligible investment. Following President Sukarno's downfall in the mid-1960s, the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down, stabilized the currency, rescheduled foreign debt, and attracted foreign aid and investment. (See Berkeley Mafia). Indonesia was until recently Southeast Asia's only member of OPEC, and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates, averaging over 7% from 1968 to 1981.Schwarz (1994), pp. 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s,Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s, due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices, growth slowed to an average of 4.3% per annum between 1981 and 1988. A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s. Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness, and de-regulation of the financial sector (Schwarz (1994), pp. 52–57). foreign investment flowed into Indonesia, particularly into the rapidly developing export-oriented manufacturing sector, and from 1989 to 1997, the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7%.Schwarz (1994), pp. 52–57.[tpl]cite web |title=Indonesia: Country Brief |work=Indonesia: Key Development Data & Statistics |publisher=The World Bank |date=September 2006 | url = http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/INDONESIAEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20095968~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:226309,00.html [/tpl]
Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98. During the crisis there were sudden and large capital outflows leading the rupiah to go into free fall. Against the US dollar the rupiah dropped from about Rp 2,600 in late 1997 to a low point of around Rp 17,000 some months later and the economy shrank by a remarkable 13.7%. These developments led to widespread economic distress across the economy and contributed to the political crisis of 1998 which saw Suharto resign as president.[tpl]cite web |title=Indonesia: Country Brief |work=Indonesia:Key Development Data & Statistics |publisher=The World Bank |date=September 2006 |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/INDONESIAEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20095968~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:226309,00.html[/tpl] The rupiah later stabilised in the Rp. 8,000 range[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oanda.com/convert/fxhistory |title=Historical Exchange Rates |publisher=OANDA |date=7 January 2010 |accessdate =28 April 2010[/tpl] and economic growth returned to 4% per year by 2000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG/countries?page=2 |title=World Bank data |accessdate =29 April 2014[/tpl] However, the currency still fluctuates, dropping below Rp 11,000 per dollar in September 2013.

The official national language is Indonesian, a form of Malay. It is based on the prestige dialect of Malay, that of the Johor-Riau Sultanate, which for centuries had been the lingua franca of the archipelago, standards of which are the official languages in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. Indonesian is universally taught in schools, consequently it is spoken by nearly every Indonesian. It is the language of business, politics, national media, education, and academia. It was promoted by Indonesian nationalists in the 1920s, and declared the official language under the name Bahasa Indonesia on the proclamation of independence in 1945. Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages and dialects, often as their first language. Of these, Javanese is the most widely spoken as the language of the largest ethnic group.

==Culture==

Indonesia has about 300 ethnic groups, each with cultural identities developed over centuries, and influenced by Indian, Arabic, Chinese, and European sources. Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances, for example, contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology, as do wayang kulit (shadow puppet) performances. Textiles such as batik, ikat, ulos and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region. The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian; however, Chinese, Arab, and European architectural influences have been significant.

Indonesian players have won the Thomas Cup (the world team championship of men's badminton) thirteen of the twenty-six times that it has been held since 1949, as well as numerous Olympic medals since the sport gained full Olympic status in 1992. Its women have won the Uber Cup, the female equivalent of the Thomas Cup, twice, in 1994 and 1996. Liga Indonesia is the country's premier football club league. Traditional sports include sepak takraw, and bull racing in Madura. In areas with a history of tribal warfare, mock fighting contests are held, such as caci in Flores and pasola in Sumba. Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art.
