Sir John Carew Eccles, AC FRS[tpl]cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.2001.0010[/tpl] FRACP FRSNZ FAAS (27 January 1903 – 2 May 1997) was an Australian neurophysiologist who won the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the synapse. He shared the prize with Andrew Huxley and Alan Lloyd Hodgkin.

==Life and work==

===Early life===

Eccles was born in Melbourne, Australia. He grew up there with his two sisters and his parents: William and Mary Carew Eccles (both teachers, who home schooled him until he was 12).[ref][tpl]cite book |last1= McGrath |first1= K.

[/ref] He initially attended Warrnambool High School[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.science.org.au/fellows/memoirs/eccles.html|title=BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS - John Carew Eccles 1903-1997|publisher=Australian Academy of Science|accessdate=17 November 2011[/tpl]  (now Warrnambool College) (where a science wing is named in his honour), then completed his final year of schooling at Melbourne High School. Aged 17, he was awarded a senior scholarship to study medicine at the University of Melbourne. As a medical undergraduate, he was never able to find a satisfactory explanation for the interaction of mind and body; he started to think about becoming a neuroscientist. He graduated (with first class honours) in 1925,[ref][tpl]cite web |url= http://biotechnology-innovation.com.au/scientists/john_eccles.html |title = Sir John Carew Eccles |quote= As a medical student he was greatly influenced by Charles Darwin's Origin of Species [/tpl]
[/ref] and was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study under Charles Scott Sherrington at Magdalen College, Oxford University, where he received his Doctor of Philosophy in 1929.
In 1937 Eccles returned to Australia, where he worked on military research during World War II. After the war, he became a professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand. From 1952 to 1962 he worked as a professor at the John Curtin School of Medical Research (JCSMR) of the Australian National University. The Eccles Institute of Neuroscience will be headquartered in a new $60 million wing of JCSMR from 2012.

===Career===

In the early 1950s, Eccles and his colleagues performed the research that would win Eccles the Nobel Prize. To study synapses in the peripheral nervous system, Eccles and colleagues used the stretch reflex as a model. This reflex is easily studied because it consists of only two neurons: a sensory neuron (the muscle spindle fiber) and the motor neuron. The sensory neuron synapses onto the motor neuron in the spinal cord. When Eccles passed a current into the sensory neuron in the quadriceps, the motor neuron innervating the quadriceps produced a small excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). When he passed the same current through the hamstring, the opposing muscle to the quadriceps, he saw an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) in the quadriceps motor neuron. Although a single EPSP was not enough to fire an action potential in the motor neuron, the sum of several EPSPs from multiple sensory neurons synapsing onto the motor neuron could cause the motor neuron to fire, thus contracting the quadriceps. On the other hand, IPSPs could subtract from this sum of EPSPs, preventing the motor neuron from firing.
Apart from these seminal experiments, Eccles was key to a number of important developments in neuroscience. Until around 1949, Eccles believed that synaptic transmission was primarily electrical rather than chemical. Although he was wrong in this hypothesis, his arguments led him and others to perform some of the experiments which proved chemical synaptic transmission. Bernard Katz and Eccles worked together on some of the experiments which elucidated the role of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter.

===Honours===

He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1958 in recognition of services to physiological research.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1083462&search_type=simple&showInd=truee |title= It’s an Honour |publisher= Australian Government |quote= Award: Knight Bachelor |date= 1958-06-12 [/tpl]
He won the Australian of the Year Award in 1963,[tpl]cite book | author=Lewis, Wendy | title=Australians of the Year | publisher=Pier 9 Press | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-74196-809-5 [/tpl] the same year he won the Nobel Prize.
In 1964 he became an honorary member to the American Philosophical Society, and in 1966 he moved to the United States to work at the Institute for Biomedical Research in Chicago.[ref]
