Victoria Bridge is a road bridge spanning the River Clyde in Glasgow, Scotland. Victoria Bridge is the oldest surviving bridge in Glasgow, which replaced the Bishop's Bridge, its 500-year-old predecessor located on the same site, lying at the foot of Stockwell Street in the city centre.

==History==

Victoria Bridge is built on the site of the first recorded bridge over the Clyde; a timber bridge believed to exist in 1285 and described as "Glaskow bryg, that byggt was of tre" in Henry the Minstrel's epic poem on Sir William Wallace.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=8072|title=Victoria Bridge History|publisher=Glasgow City Council|accessdate=10/8/2013[/tpl]
By 1851 Glasgow's population had risen to 329,000 having doubled in the previous 25 years and the old bridge couldn't cope with current demands, and needed to be replaced.

==Construction==

A new 50 ft wide masonry arch bridge was designed by James Walker, with foundations 19 ft below those of the old bridge, and timber piles which were steam-driven a further 14 ft below that.
Named after Queen Victoria, when the bridge opened in 1854, Glasgow had one of the two widest bridges in Britain - London's widest at that time was only 54 ft.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=8072|title=Victoria Bridge|publisher=Glasgow City Council|accessdate=10/8/2013[/tpl]
The bridge carries the western arm of the A8 across the River Clyde. It is one way city-bound with 2 lanes. However, it also has a contraflow Bus, Cycle and Taxi lane. It is complemented by the Albert Bridge on the other side of the railway bridge, which is also two-way.
On the northern shore, the A8 immediately crosses the A814, to take Bridgegate towards Glasgow Cross. Meanwhile, on the southern shore, the A8 takes Gorbals Street as far as Norfolk Street, which is the A8 in both directions, Gorbals Street becoming the A730.
