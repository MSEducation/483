Wisley [tpl]IPAc-en|w|ɪ|z|l|i[/tpl] is a village and civil parish in Surrey, England between Cobham and Woking, in the Borough of Guildford. It is the home of the Royal Horticultural Society's Wisley Garden. The River Wey runs through the village and Ockham and Wisley Commons form a large proportion of the parish on a high acid heathland, which is a rare soil type providing for its own types of habitat.  It has a standard weather monitoring station, which has recorded some national record high temperatures.

==Geography==

The village is equidistant between Cobham and Woking, in the Borough of Guildford. It is the home of the Royal Horticultural Society's Wisley Garden. The River Wey forms part of the western part of the village, but is partly on both banks within Pyrford.

===Manorial descent===

After a series of minor nobility and non-nobility owners, the manor passed in the Middle Ages to an earl: in 1434 Robert de Poynings settled the manor on his daughter Eleanor on her marriage with Henry Percy, son and heir of the Earl of Northumberland, which led to his inheritance.  The earl was murdered in a riot in 1489, and the Earl of Ormond (an Anglo-Irish peer) acquired it following litigation.  That family granted it to John Covert who held in 1503.  Richard Covert in 1594 joined with his son Anthony in conveying the manor to notable courtiers/high-ranking national executives Sir John Wolley (MP) and Elizabeth his wife, daughter of Sir William More (died 1600).
Sir Arthur Mainwaring conveyed the manor in 1641 to Sir Robert Parkhurst, who died in 1651. His son died in 1674, and in 1677 it was sold to Denzil Onslow — it passed under his will, after his widow's death in 1729, to Thomas Lord Onslow, and early in the 19th century it was exchanged for the manor of Papworth in Send, Surrey with Lord King, whose main descendant, a third earl, (see Earl of Lovelace) owned it, as his family did Ockham, in the early 20th century.

===19th and 20th centuries===

Slade Farm and a cottage were transferred from Wisley to Ockham 25 March 1883.  The children of Wisley Common began to attend Byfleet School.  Charles Buxton, brewer and MP, had his solitary, stark Neo-Gothic mansion home placed upon the far woodlands of the heath, in land well within the orbital motorway of today and associated with Weybridge.
In 1911 it was recorded in the Victoria County History "there is no village of Wisley; merely some scattered farms and cottages".
The former Wisley Airfield, is a misnomer as it is within the bounds of Ockham, next to the junction of the M25/A3Google Maps  Location of Wisley Airfield had a 6,691 foot (1.27 mile) runway. Built towards the end of World War II as a flight test airfield for the Vickers aircraft factory at nearby Brooklands, it opened in 1944 and after extended use for the development of military aircraft during the Cold War, it finally closed in 1972.
Although the runway, taxiways and large areas of hardstanding survive, most of the buildings—including the unique control tower converted from an old timber-framed cottage—were demolished around 1980. The Ockham Beacon at the east end serves as a navigation aid for aircraft flying over the area.
