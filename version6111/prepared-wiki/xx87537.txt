The gatekeeper was found not guilty to the charge of manslaughter, the jury finding the incident was due to the fault of the system and not through human negligence. In 1932 there was a shootout between a policeman, and a burglar who was killed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://localhistory.kingston.vic.gov.au/htm/article/245.htm|title=Events in the Past: Shooting at Highett: Man Dies|publisher=localhistory.kingston.vic.gov.au|accessdate=2008-05-11[/tpl]
