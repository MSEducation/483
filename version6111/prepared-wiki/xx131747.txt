==History==

Colby High School was founded in 1890.  As the community grew, so did the school, and eventually surrounding smaller schools in Levant, Kansas, and Gem, Kansas, were closed so students could attend classes at Colby. Until 1995, Colby High School was located on Third Street, but the need for a larger building was recognized, and thus emerged the building that accommodates the students and teachers now.
