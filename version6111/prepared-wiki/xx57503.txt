Washington and Lee University (Washington and Lee or W&L) is a private liberal arts university in Lexington, Virginia, United States.
Washington and Lee's 325 acre campus sits at the heart of Lexington and abuts the Virginia Military Institute in the Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Allegheny Mountains. The rural campus is approximately 50 miles from Roanoke, Virginia, 140 miles from Richmond, Virginia, and 180 miles from Washington, DC.
Washington and Lee was founded in 1749 as a small classical school by Scotch-Irish Presbyterian pioneers, though currently the University maintains no religious affiliation. In 1796, George Washington endowed the struggling academy with a gift of stock. In gratitude, the school was renamed for the first United States President. In 1865, General Robert E. Lee served as president of the college until his death in 1870, prompting the college to be renamed as Washington and Lee University. Washington and Lee is the ninth oldest institution of higher learning in the United States and the second oldest in Virginia.
The University consists of three academic units: The College; the Williams School of Commerce, Economics, and Politics; and the School of Law. The University hosts 23 intercollegiate athletic teams which compete as part of the Old Dominion Athletic Conference of the NCAA Division III.

==History==

The classical school from which Washington and Lee descended was established in 1749 as Augusta Academy,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x22.xml |title=A History :: Washington and Lee University |publisher=Wlu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28[/tpl] about [tpl]convert|20|mi|km[/tpl] north of its present location. In 1776 it was renamed Liberty Hall in a burst of revolutionary fervor. The academy moved to Lexington in 1780, when it was chartered as Liberty Hall Academy, and built its first facility near town in 1782. The Academy became a college when it granted its first bachelor of arts degree in 1785,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.braintrack.com/college/u/washington-and-lee-university |title=Washington And Lee University |publisher=Braintrack.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28[/tpl] making it the ninth oldest institution of higher education in the country.
In 1796, George Washington endowed the academy with $20,000 in James River Canal stock, at the time the largest gift ever given to an educational institution in the United States. Washington's gift continues to provide nearly $1.87 a year toward every student's tuition.  The gift rescued Liberty Hall from near-certain insolvency. In gratitude, the trustees changed the school's name to Washington Academy; in 1813 it was chartered as Washington College. An 8-foot tall statue of George Washington, known as Old George, has sat atop the historic Colonnade since 1844 in memory of Washington's gift.
Liberty Hall is said to have admitted its first African-American student when John Chavis, a free black, enrolled in 1795.http://www.wlu.edu/x9651.xml Chavis accomplished much in his life including fighting in the American Revolution, studying at both Liberty Hall and the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), becoming an ordained Presbyterian minister, and opening a school that instructed white and poor black students in North Carolina. He is believed to be the first black student to enroll in higher education in the United States, although he did not receive a degree.http://www.jbhe.com/timeline.html Washington and Lee enrolled its next African-American student in 1966 in the law school.
The campus took its current architectural form in the 1820s when a local merchant, "Jockey" John Robinson, an uneducated Irish immigrant, donated funds to build a central building. For the dedication celebration in 1824, Robinson supplied a huge barrel of whiskey, which he intended for the dignitaries in attendance. But according to a contemporary history, the rabble broke through the barriers and created pandemonium, which ended only when college officials demolished the whiskey barrel with an ax. A justice of the Virginia State Supreme Court, Christian Compton ('50 undergraduate, '53 law), re-created the episode in 1976 for the dedication of the new law school by having several barrels of Scotch imported (without the unfortunate dénouement).
During the Civil War, the students of Washington College raised the Confederate flag in support of Virginia's secession. The students formed the Liberty Hall Volunteers, as part of the Stonewall Brigade under General Stonewall Jackson and marched from Lexington. Later in the war, during Hunter's Raid, Captain Henry DuPont refused to destroy the Colonnade due to its support of the statue of George Washington, Old George.

===Lee years===

After the Civil War, General Robert E. Lee turned down several financially tantalizing offers of employment that would merely have traded on his name,http://dsuka.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=29 and instead accepted the post of college president for three reasons. First, he had been superintendent of the United States Military Academy, so supervising higher education was in his background. Second, and more important, he believed that it was a position in which he could actually make a contribution to the reconciliation of the nation. Third, the Washington family were his in-laws: his wife was the great-granddaughter of Martha Washington, and Lee had long looked on George Washington as a hero and role model, so it is hardly surprising that he welcomed the challenge of leading a college endowed by and named after the first president.
Arguably Lee's finest achievement was transforming a small, not particularly distinguished Latin academy into a forward-looking institution of higher education. He established the first journalism courses (which were limited and only lasted several years),Washington and Lee University website. and he added both a business school and a law school to the college curriculum, under the conviction that those occupations should be intimately and inextricably linked with the liberal arts. That was a radical idea: Journalism and law had always been considered technical crafts, not intellectual endeavors, and the study of business was seen with skepticism.
Lee was also the father of an Honor System and a speaking tradition at Washington College that continue to the present time. And, ardent about restoring national unity, he successfully recruited students from the North as well as the South.
Lee died on October 12, 1870, after just five years as Washington College president.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=Lee&GSfn=Robert&GSmn=Edward&GSbyrel=in&GSdyrel=in&GSob=n&GRid=615& |title=Robert Edward Lee (1807 - 1870) - Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28[/tpl] The college's name was almost immediately changed to Washington and Lee University, linking Lee's name with Washington's. The university's motto, Nōn Incautus Futūrī', meaning "Not unmindful of the future", is an adaptation of the Lee family motto. Lee's son, George Washington Custis Lee, followed as the school's next president. General Lee and much of his family—including his wife, his seven children, and his father, the Revolutionary War hero "Light Horse Harry" Lee—are buried in the Lee Chapel on campus,http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gsr&GScid=641527 which faces the main row of antebellum college buildings. Robert E. Lee's beloved horse Traveller is buried outside, near the wall of the chapel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GScid=641527&GRid=3082& |title=Traveller (1857 - 1870) - Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28[/tpl]

===20th century and beyond===

After Lee's death, the university continued his program of modernization and expansion. In 1905, the Board of Trustees formally organized a School of Commerce in order to train students in business and finance alongside the college and the School of Law. In 1995, Ernest Williams II of the Class of 1938 endowed the School of Commerce which was renamed the Ernest Williams II School of Commerce, Economics, and Politics. The Williams School is one of the few accredited schools of business at a top liberal arts college and consists of departments of Business, Economics, Politics, and Accounting. Also in 1905, Andrew Carnegie donated $55,000 to the university for the erection of a new library.
Omicron Delta Kappa or ODK, one the nation's premier leadership honor societies was founded at Washington and Lee on December, 3 1914. Chapters, known as Circles, are located on over 300 college campuses. The society recognizes achievement in the five areas of scholarship; athletics; campus/community service, social/religious activities, and campus government; journalism, speech and the mass media; and creative and performing arts. ODK is a quasi-secret society in regards to the way its members are selected and kept secret for a period of time. Membership in the Omicron Delta Kappa Society is regarded as one of the highest collegiate honors that can be awarded to an individual, along with Phi Kappa Phi and Phi Beta Kappa. Some Circles limit membership to less than the top one quarter of one percent of students on their respective campuses. Omicron Delta Kappa continues to maintain its headquarters in Lexington and is a major presence at W&L.
During the first half of the 20th century, the university began its traditions of the Fancy Dress Ball and Mock Convention. Both of these are still staples of the W&L experience.
The second half of the 20th century saw Washington and Lee move from being an all-men's college to a co-ed university. The School of Law enrolled its first women in 1972 and the undergraduate program enrolled its first woman in 1985. The university built new buildings to house its science departments as well as a new School of Law facility. Further, W&L successfully completed several multi-million dollar capital campaigns.
Among many alumni who have followed in George Washington's footsteps by donating generously, Rupert Johnson, Jr., a 1962 graduate who is vice chairman of the $600-billion Franklin Templeton investment management firm, gave $100 million to Washington and Lee in June 2007, establishing a merit-based financial aid and curriculum enrichment program.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wlu.edu/x26096.xml | title=W&L Concludes Outstanding Fund-Raising Year | publisher=W&L | date=August 12, 2008 | accessdate=August 20, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://sacs.wlu.edu/documents/100MillionGiftAnnouncement.pdf | title=Washington and Lee University Receives $100 Million  Gift, One of the Largest Ever to a Liberal Arts College | publisher=W&L | date=June 7, 2007 | accessdate=August 20, 2012[/tpl]

==Campus==

The row of brick buildings that form the Colonnade, which traces to 1824, is a U.S. National Historic Landmark.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x8.xml |title=About W&L :: Washington and Lee University |publisher=Wlu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28[/tpl] Separately, the Lee Chapel is also a National Historic Landmark.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/vamainstreet/was.HTM |title=Washington and Lee University: Virginia Main Street Communities: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28[/tpl]
The British writer John Cowper Powys once called W&L the "most beautiful college campus in America." The poet and dramatist John Drinkwater remarked, "If this scene were set down in the middle of Europe, the whole continent would flock to see it!"
In recent years the university has invested heavily in upgrading and expanding its academic, residential, athletic, research, arts and extracurricular facilities. The new facilities include an undergraduate library, gymnasium, art/music/theater complex, dorms, student center, student activities pavilion and tennis pavilion, as well as renovation of the journalism and commerce buildings and renovation of every fraternity house and construction of several sorority houses. Lewis Hall, the 30-year-old home of the law school, as well as athletic fields and the antebellum Historic Front Campus buildings, are all currently undergoing major renovation.
Constructed in 1991, the Lenfest Center for the Arts has presented both performances from students and presentations that are open to the community. The Reeves Center houses a notable ceramics collection which spans 4000 years and includes ceramics from Asia, Europe and America, and examples of Chinese export porcelain.
In 1977, The New Yorker published a cartoon showing a family in a car in front of the Washington and Lee campus. The caption was: "The College of Your Choice".

==Organization and administration==

The school is governed by a Board of Trustees that has a maximum of 34 members.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x2137.xml|title=Board of Trustees|publisher=Washington & Lee Univ.|accessdate=2010-09-20[/tpl]
The undergraduate calendar is an unusual three-term system with 12-week fall and winter terms followed by a four-week spring term. The spring-term courses include topical, often unique, seminars, faculty-supervised study abroad, and some domestic and international internships. The law calendar consists of the more traditional early-semester system.

===Demographics===

Washington and Lee was essentially all male until 1972, when women were admitted to the law school; the first female undergraduates enrolled in 1985.
As of 2006, the University's undergraduate population was equally divided between men and women.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ie.wlu.edu/ |title=Institutional Effectiveness :: Washington and Lee University |publisher=ie.wlu.edu |date=2010-11-30 |accessdate=2011-02-28[/tpl] In 2006, the number of women receiving undergraduate degrees exceeded the number of men for the first time in the school's history. The law school population is more generally 40 percent women, 60 percent men.
In 1795, the first known Black person was admitted to the school, John Chavis, who became a teacher and Presbyterian minister. Walter Blake and Carl Linwood Smothers become the first African-American students to graduate from Washington and Lee University in 1972, the same year women were first admitted. The University has worked to increase the number of minority faculty and students. Minority students now comprise approximately 15 percent of the student body.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x48564.xml |title=University Chronology :: Washington and Lee University |publisher=Wlu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28[/tpl]

===Honor system===

Washington and Lee maintains a rigorous honor system that traces directly to Robert E. Lee, who said, "We have but one rule here, and it is that every student must be a gentleman."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x36856.xml|title=Student Judicial Council|publisher=Washington & Lee Univ.|accessdate=2010-09-20[/tpl]  Students, upon entering the university, vow to act honorably in all academic and nonacademic endeavors. 
The Honor System is administered by students through the Executive Committee of the Student Body (and has been since 1905).[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] Any student found guilty of an Honor Violation by his or her peers is subject to a single sanction: expulsion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x48252.xml|title=Enforcement Procedure|accessdate=2012-02-07[/tpl] The Honor System is defined solely by students, and there is an appeal process. Appeals are heard by juries composed of students drawn randomly by the University Registrar. A formal assessment of the Honor System's "White Book," occasionally including referenda, is held every three years to review the tenets of the Honor System. Overwhelmingly, students continue to support the Honor System and its single sanction, and they and alumni point to the Honor System as one of the distinctive marks they carry with them from their W&L experience.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x34.xml|title=The Honor System|publisher=Washington & Lee Univ.|accessdate=2010-09-20[/tpl]
Washington and Lee's Honor System is distinct from others such as those found at the neighboring Virginia Military Institute and the University of Virginia because it is not codified. That is to say, unlike its Virginia neighbors, Washington and Lee's does not have a list of rules that define punishable behavior—beyond the traditional guide of the offenses lying, cheating or stealing. Exams at W&L are ordinarily unproctored and self-scheduled. It is not unusual for professors to assign take-home, closed-book finals with an explicit trust in their students not to cheat.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/honor-and-testing-at-a-virginia-university/2012/12/12/bc9bfa6a-43ca-11e2-9648-a2c323a991d6_story.html|title=Washington Post: Honor and Testing at Washington & Lee University|accessdate=2012-12-17 | work=The Washington Post|first=Nick|last=Anderson|date=2012-12-14[/tpl]
The Honor System is strongly enforced. In most years, only a few students withdraw in the face of an honor charge or after investigations and closed hearings conducted by the Executive Committee of the Student Body, the University's elected student government (with the accused counseled by Honor Advocates, often law students). In recent years, four or five students have left each year.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] Students found guilty in a closed hearing may appeal the verdict to an open hearing before the entire student body, although this option is rarely exercised. If found guilty at an open trial, the student is dismissed from the university permanently.
Separately from the student-run honor system, the Student-Faculty Hearing Board hears allegations of student misconduct.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x36855.xml|title=Student-Faculty Hearing Board|publisher=Washington & Lee Univ.|accessdate=2010-09-20[/tpl]

==Academics and reputation==

Today the university has about 2,000 undergraduate students and 400 in the School of Law.

===Student activities===

====Traditions====

Every four years, the school sponsors the Washington and Lee Mock Convention for whichever political party (Democratic or Republican) does not hold the Presidency. The Convention has received gavel-to-gavel coverage on C-SPAN and attention from many other national media outlets. The convention has correctly picked the out-of-power nominee for 18 of the past 23 national elections. It has been wrong twice since 1948,US News and World Report, "Campus Pundits' Winning Record," January 28, 2008 including its incorrect choice of Hillary Clinton in 2008. In 1984, the failure of the scoreboard significantly slowed the vote tally process and almost led to a wrong selection.W&L Mock Convention 2008 Official Site  The Washington Post declared Washington and Lee's Mock Convention "one of the nation’s oldest and most prestigious mock conventions."Washington Post, 1996
The university hosts the Fancy Dress Ball, a 105-year old formal black-tie event. Each year, the Fancy Dress Ball has a theme and has a rumored budget of over $80,000.http://www.wlu.edu/x53276.xml
W&L also follows the "speaking tradition" which traces its history to Robert E. Lee. Under this tradition, students are suggested to greet one another upon passing on campus. This tradition is not enforced.
Washington and Lee University has several mysterious societies including the Cadaver Society, the Sigma Society, and the Mongolian Minks.

===Fraternities and sororities===

Greek letter organizations play a major role in Washington and Lee's social scene. The following is a list of active, recognized fraternities and sororities.

====Fraternities====

The Kappa Alpha Order, one of the Lexington Triad, was founded at W&L.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ka-zetazeta.com/page.php?page_id=4348 |title=Welcome to Kappa Alpha Order, Zeta Zeta Chapter |publisher=Ka-zetazeta.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28[/tpl]  Alpha Tau Omega and Sigma Nu, the other two members of the Triad, were founded at neighboring VMI and instituted early chapters at W&L.
Dormant fraternity chapters at Washington and Lee also include Alpha Chi Rho, Alpha Tau Omega, Chi Phi, Delta Sigma Phi, Delta Tau Delta, Delta Upsilon, Theta Delta Chi. Phi Kappa Sigma, Psi Upsilon, Phi Epsilon Pi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Zeta Beta Tau.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]

====Sororities====

===Media and culture===

The eminent photographer Sally Mann got her start at Washington and Lee, photographing the construction of the law school while a university employee. The photos eventually became the basis of a one-woman exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C.
Secretariat, who holds the record for the fastest time in the Kentucky Derby and winner of the Triple Crown in 1973, wore royal blue and white (as vividly shown in the 2010 Disney movie) because his owner, Christopher Chenery, was a graduate and trustee of Washington and Lee.
A Washington and Lee art history professor, Pamela Hemenway Simpson, in 1999 wrote the only scholarly book on linoleum, giving it the title Cheap, Quick and Easy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1572330376 |title=Cheap, Quick and Easy |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28[/tpl]  The book also examines other home-design materials once used by the lower classes to emulate their betters. More recently, she has become an expert, perhaps the leading academic expert, on butter sculpture.
Washington and Lee is home to a collection of 18th- and 19th-century Chinese and European porcelain, the gift of Euchlin Dalcho Reeves, a 1927 graduate of the law school, and his wife, Louise Herreshoff. In 1967, Mr. Reeves contacted Washington and Lee about making "a small gift," which turned out to be a collection of porcelain so vast that it filled two entire houses which he and his wife owned in Providence, Rhode Island. A number of dirt-covered picture frames, found in the two houses, were put on the van along with the porcelain. Soon it was discovered that the frames actually contained Impressionist-like paintings created by Louise as a young woman in the early days of the century. Mrs. Reeves had, it turned out, been a painter of stupendous talent, certified when in 1976 the Corcoran Gallery in Washington mounted a posthumous one-woman exhibition of her works. Their story is helped by the fact that he ("Boy") was almost 30 years younger than she ("Dol").
The world's first recorded streaker — George William Crump — was a student at Washington College, in 1804. He later became a U.S. Congressman.

===Music===

Before it morphed into a swing, Dixieland and bluegrass standard, "The Washington and Lee Swing" was one of the most well known — and widely borrowed — football marches ever written, according to Robert Lissauer's Encyclopedia of Popular Music in America. Schools and colleges from Tulane to Slippery Rock copied it (sometimes with attribution). It was written in 1910 by Mark W. Sheafe, '06, Clarence A. (Tod) Robbins, '11, and Thornton W. Allen, '13. It has been recorded by virtually every important jazz and swing musician, including Glenn Miller (with Tex Beneke on vocals), Louis Armstrong, Kay Kyser, Hal Kemp and the Dukes of Dixieland. "The Swing" was a trademark of the New Orleans showman Pete Fountain. The trumpeter Red Nichols played it (and Danny Kaye pretended to play it) in the 1959 movie The Five Pennies. (Herehttp://www.bizpubs.com/swing.mp3 is an audio excerpt from a 1944 recording by Jan Garber, a prominent dance-band leader of the era.

The "Swing" was parodied in "The Dummy Song" by Ray Brown and Lew Henderson.who also wrote "Birth of the Blues," "Bye Bye Blackbird," "Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries." "You're the Cream in My Coffee" and "Keep Your Skirts Down, Mary Ann" "Dummy" was recorded by NRBQ, Louis Armstrong, Louis Prima and Glenn Miller's vocal jazz group, the Modernaires, among many others, and was used in the movie You've Got Mail.

==Notable alumni==

Washington and Lee University is the alma mater of three United States Supreme Court Justices, a Nobel Prize laureate, winners of the Pulitzer Prize, the Tony Award, and the Emmy Award, as well as many government officials, judges, business leaders, entertainers, and athletes.
Several well-known alumni include United States Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.; United States Senator John Warner from Virginia; United States Solicitor General John W. Davis, Democratic Party nominee for President of the United States during the 1924 presidential election; author Tom Wolfe, founder of New Journalism; artist Cy Twombly; explorer Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition; and billionaire Rupert Johnson, Jr. of Franklin Templeton Investments.

==In literature==

A fictionalized representation of the University appears in L'Étudiant étranger by Philippe Labro (1986, Editions Gallimard), translated into English two years later and published as The Foreign Student (Ballantine Books)http://www.amazon.com/The-Foreign-Student-Philippe-Labro/dp/0345346963/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1331508841&sr=8-2. In 1994 it was made into a movie, starring Robin Givens and Marco Hofschneider, but it grossed only $113,000 at the box office.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109828/business
Other novels about the university include Geese in the Forum (Knopf, 1940) by Lawrence Edward Watkin, a professor of English who went on to become a screenwriter for Disney (the college faculty were the titular geese); The Hero (Julian Messner, 1949), by Millard Lampell, filmed as Saturday's Hero, starring Donna Reed and John Derek (Columbia Studios, 1951), about a football player who struggles to balance athletics, academics and a social life; and A Sound of Voices Dying by Glenn Scott (E.P. Dutton, 1954), released in a paperback edition in 1955 under the new title Farewell My Young Lover (replete with a lurid illustration on the cover).http://www.amazon.com/Farewell-Young-Lover-Sound-Voices/dp/B001VNWLE8
