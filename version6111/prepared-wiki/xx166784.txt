[[Call gapping]]

CATEGORIES: Teletraffic

Call Gapping is a load control method for throttling telephone traffic on a telephone network when the network is overloaded.
Call gapping works by blocking calls for a determined period of time (the gap size).  After the period of time passes, another call is allowed through.  Another gap is then started and the process repeats until the overload condition is resolved.
Call gapping is not to be confused with Silence suppression.
