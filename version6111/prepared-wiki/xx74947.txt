Mount Kenya is a stratovolcano that was active in the Plio-Pleistocene. The original crater was probably over [tpl]convert|6000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on[/tpl] high; higher than Kilimanjaro. Since it became extinct there have been two major periods of glaciation, which are shown by two main rings of moraines below the glaciers. The lowest moraine is found at around [tpl]convert|3300|m|ft|-2|abbr=on[/tpl]. Today the glaciers reach no lower than [tpl]convert|4650|m|ft|-1|abbr=on[/tpl]. After studying the moraines, Gregory put forward the theory that at one time the whole summit of the mountain was covered with an ice cap, and it was this that eroded the peaks to how they are today.
The lower slopes of the mountain have never been glaciated. They are now mainly cultivated and forested. They are distinguished by steep-sided V-shaped valleys with many tributaries. Higher up the mountain, in the area that is now moorland, the valleys become U-shaped and shallower with flatter bottoms. These were created by glaciation.
When Mount Kenya was active there was some satellite activity. The north-eastern side of the mountain has many old volcanic plugs and craters. The largest of these, Ithanguni, even had its own ice cap when the main peaks were covered in ice. This can be seen by the smoothed summit of the peak. Circular hills with steep sides are also frequent in this area, which are probably the remains of small plugged vents. However, as the remaining mountain is roughly symmetrical, most of the activity must have occurred at the central plug.
The rocks that form Mount Kenya are mainly basalts, rhomb porphyrites, phonolites, kenytes and trachytes. Kenyte was first reported by Gregory in 1900 following his study of the geology of Mount Kenya.
The geology of the Mount Kenya area was first proposed to the Western Community by Joseph Thomson in 1883. He saw the mountain from the nearby Laikipia Plateau and wrote that it was an extinct volcano with the plug exposed. However, as he had only seen the mountain from a distance his description was not widely believed in Europe, particularly after 1887 when Teleki and von Höhnel ascended the mountain and described what they considered to be the crater. In 1893 Gregory's expedition reached the Lewis Glacier at [tpl]convert|5000|m|ft|-1|abbr=on[/tpl]. He confirmed that the volcano was extinct and that there were glaciers present. The first thorough survey by Europeans was not undertaken until 1966.

==Peaks==

The peaks of Mount Kenya are almost all from a volcanic origin. The majority of the peaks are located near the centre of the mountain. These peaks have an Alpine appearance due to their craggy nature. Typically of Alpine terrain, the highest peaks and gendarmes occur at the intersection of ridges. The central peaks only have a few mosses, lichens and small alpine plants growing in rock crevices. Further away from the central peaks, the volcanic plugs are covered in volcanic ash and soils. The vegetation growing on these peaks is typical for their vegetation band.
The highest peaks are Batian ([tpl]convert|5199|m|ft|0[/tpl]), Nelion ([tpl]convert|5188|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]) and Pt Lenana ([tpl]convert|4985|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]). Batian and Nelion are within [tpl]convert|250|m|yd|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] of each other, separated by the Gate of the Mists gap ([tpl]convert|5144|m|ft|0[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ewpnet.com/eaimg/Mount_Kenya_climbs.htm|title=Mount Kenya Climbing guide |publisher=Ewpnet.com |date= |accessdate=11 September 2013[/tpl] Coryndon Peak ([tpl]convert|4960|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]) is the next highest, but unlike the previous peaks it does not form a part of the central plug.
Other peaks around the central plug include Pt Piggot ([tpl]convert|4957|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]), Pt Dutton ([tpl]convert|4885|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]), Pt John ([tpl]convert|4883|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]), Pt John Minor ([tpl]convert|4875|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]), Krapf Rognon ([tpl]convert|4800|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]), Pt Peter ([tpl]convert|4757|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]), Pt Slade ([tpl]convert|4750|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]) and Midget Peak ([tpl]convert|4700|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]). All of these have a steep pyramidal form.
Significant craggy outlying peaks include Terere ([tpl]convert|4714|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]) and Sendeyo ([tpl]convert|4704|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]) which form a pair of twin peaks to the north of the main plug. Together, they form a large parasitic plug. Other notable peaks include The Hat ([tpl]convert|4639|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]), Delamere Peak, Macmillan Peak and Rotundu.

==Glaciers==

The glaciers on Mount Kenya are retreating rapidly. The Mountain Club of Kenya in Nairobi has photographs showing the mountain when it was first climbed in 1899, and again more recently, and the retreat of the glaciers is very evident.[ref]Recession of Equatorial Glaciers. A Photo Documentation, Hastenrath, S., 2008, Sundog Publishing, Madison, WI, ISBN 978-0-9729033-3-2, 144 pp.
[/ref]  Descriptions of ascents of several of the peaks advise on the use of crampons, but this is true only in some cases and at higher heights. Every year there is less new snow accumulating in winter than melting on summer, even on the Lewis Glacier (the largest of them) in winter, so there is no formation of new ice. It is predicted to be less than 30 years before there will no longer be ice on Mount Kenya.  Glacial retreat and disappearance can be caused by change in temperature trends, or by change in precipitation trends.[ref]

The glacier names are (clockwise from the north):
The area of glaciers on the mountain was measured in the 1980s, and recorded as about [tpl]convert|0.7|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on[/tpl].  This is far smaller than the first observations, made in the 1890s.

===Periglacial landforms===

Although Mount Kenya is on the equator the freezing nightly temperatures result in periglacial landforms. There is permafrost a few centimetres (inches) below the surface. Patterned ground is present at [tpl]convert|3400|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to the west of Mugi Hill. These mounds grow because of the repeated freezing and thawing of the ground drawing in more water. There are blockfields present around [tpl]convert|4000|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] where the ground has cracked to form hexagons. Solifluction occurs when the night temperatures freeze the soil before it thaws again in the morning. This daily expansion and contraction of the soil prevents the establishment of vegetation.

==Rivers==

Mount Kenya is the main water catchment area for two large rivers in Kenya; the Tana, the largest river in Kenya, and the Ewaso Ng'iso North.  The Mount Kenya ecosystem provides water directly for over 2 million people. The rivers on Mount Kenya have been named after the villages on the slopes of the mountain that they flow close to. The Thuchi River is the district boundary between Meru and Embu. Mount Kenya is a major water tower for the Tana river which in 1988 supplied 80% of Kenya's electricity using a series of seven hydroelectric powerstations and dams.
The density of streams is very high, especially on the lower slopes which have never been glaciated. The ice cap which used to cover the mountain during the Pliocene eroded large U-shaped valleys which tend to only have one large stream.
Where the original shape of the shield volcano is still preserved, there have been millions of years for streams to erode the hillside. This area is therefore characterised by frequent deep fluvial V-shaped valleys.
The gradual transition from glaciated to fluvial valley can be clearly observed.
Rivers which start on Mount Kenya are the tributaries of two large Kenyan rivers: the Tana and the Ewaso Ng'iro rivers. A lot of Mount Kenyan rivers flow into the Sagana which itself is a tributary of the Tana, which it joins at the Masinga Reservoir. The rivers in the northern part of the mountain, such as the Burguret, Naro Moro, Nanyuki, Liki, Sirimon flow into the Ewaso Ng'iro. The rivers to the south-west, such as the Keringa and Nairobi flow into the Sagana and then into the Tana. The remaining rivers to the south and east, such as the Mutonga, Nithi, Thuchi and Nyamindi, flow directly into the Tana.

==Natural history==

Mount Kenya has several distinct ecological zones, between the savanna surrounding the mountain to the nival zone by the glaciers. Each zone has a dominant species of vegetation. Many of the species found higher up the mountain are endemic, either to Mount Kenya or East Africa.
There are also differences within the zones, depending on the side of the mountain and aspect of the slope. The south-east is much wetter than the north, so species more dependent on moisture are able to grow. Some species, such as bamboo, are limited to certain aspects of the mountain because of the amount of moisture.

===Zones===

The climate of Mount Kenya changes considerably with altitude, forming belts of community types.  Around the base of the mountain is fertile farmland. The tribes living around the mountain have cultivated this cool relatively moist area for centuries.
Mount Kenya is surrounded by forests. The vegetation in the forests depend on rainfall, and the species present differ greatly between the northern and southern slopes.  As time has passed the trees on the edge of the forest have been logged and the farmland has encroached further up the fertile slopes of the mountain.
Above the forest is a belt of bamboo. This zone is almost continuous, but is restricted to small isolated bunches in the north because of low rainfall. The bamboo is natural, and does not require forest disturbance. Tracks are common through the bamboo. Bamboo suppresses other vegetation, so it is uncommon to find trees or other plants here.
Above the bamboo is the timberline forest. The trees here are often smaller than the trees in the forests lower down the mountain.  The forest here is more intact, because it is less accessible and better protected.
When the trees can no longer grow the vegetation changes into heathland and chaparral, at around [tpl]convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. Heathland is found in the wetter areas, on the west side of Mount Kenya, and is dominated by giant heathers. Chaparral is found in the drier areas and grasses are more common. and bush fires still occur.
As the altitude increases the temperature fluctuations become extreme and the air becomes thinner and drier. This region is known as the Afro-alpine zone. The environment here is isolated, with the only similar area nearby being the Aberdares, which are [tpl]convert|80|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] away.  Many of the species here are endemic, with adaptations to the cold and fluctuating temperatures.  Typical plants here include giant groundsels (senecios) and giant lobelias.
The region where the glaciers have recently retreated from is nival zone. It is the area that plants have not yet been able to colonise.

===Flora===

The flora found on Mount Kenya varies with altitude, aspect and exposure. As the altitude increases, the plants have to be more specialised, with adaptations to strong sunlight with ultraviolet, lower mean temperatures and freezing night temperatures.
Plants in the Afro-alpine zone have overcome these difficulties in several ways.  One adaptation is known as the giant rosette, which is exhibited by giant senecio, giant lobelia and giant thistle (Carduus), which use bud leaves to protect their buds from freezing. Giant rosette senecios form single-aged stands that drive community structure over decades.
Many plant species in the Afro-alpine zone of Mount Kenya are giant versions of lowland (or temperate) relatives. However, nearer the nival zone the plants decrease in size again.

===Fauna===

The majority of animals live lower down on the slopes of Mount Kenya. Here there is more vegetation and the climate is less extreme. Various species of monkeys, several antelopes, tree hyrax, porcupines and some larger animals such as elephant and buffalo all live in the forest.  Predators found here include hyena and leopard, and occasionally lion.
There are fewer mammals found at high altitudes on Mount Kenya.  The Mount Kenya hyrax and common duiker are able to live here, and are important to the ecosystem. Some smaller mammals, such as the groove-toothed rat, can live here by burrowing into the giant senecios and using their thick stem of dead leaves as insulation.  The Mount Kenya mole-rat Tachyoryctes rex occurs at high altitudes, living in visible mounds.[tpl]cite book|author=Musser, Guy G. and Carleton, Michael D.|year=2005|pages=894–1531|editor=Wilson, Don E. and Reeder, DeeAnn M|url=http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3|title=Mammal Species of the World: a taxonomic and geographic reference|edition=3rd|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8221-0|chapter=Superfamily Muroidea[/tpl]  Leopards are resident in the alpine zone.
Other mammal species are only occasional visitors. Remains of elephants, monkeys and bongo have been found high in the alpine zone, and other sightings are remembered in names such as Simba Tarn (simba means lion in Swahili).
Several bird species live in the Afro-alpine zone, including sunbirds, alpine chats and starlings and the raptors Augur Buzzard, Lammergeier and Verreaux's Eagle, the latter of which specializes in hunting hyraxes. Birds are important in this ecosystem as pollinators.

==Climate==

The climate of Mount Kenya has played a critical role in the development of the mountain, influencing the topography and ecology amongst other factors. It has a typical equatorial mountain climate which Hedberg described as winter every night and summer every day. Mount Kenya is home to one of the Global Atmosphere Watch's atmospheric monitoring stations.
