Today the region of Buze-stina is the central area of the future Native Park of Istria. Beautiful, almost pristine nature and an abundance of cultural and historical monuments, together with wholesome, home-made food (especially that which uses home-grown ingredients, such as the highly-esteemed White Truffle), exquisite local wines, folklore (ancient music playing - lamentations and dances - balun, legends of citadels) and pearls of small towns on conically shaped hills (Roč, Hum, Vrh, and Sovinjak) attract tourists every year.

A few kilometers to the west is the ancient castle of Pietrapelosa.[ref]
