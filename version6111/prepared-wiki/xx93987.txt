Pulau Tiga is one of a group of small uninhabited islands in Kimanis Bay off the western coast of Sabah, Malaysia. The islands were formed on September 21, 1897, when an earthquake on Mindanao caused a volcanic eruption near Borneo.  The island is 607 hectares in size and has a couple of active mud volcanos at the highest part of the island.
Pulau Tiga is one of the three islands that make up Pulau Tiga National Park.  The Park Headquarters are on the island, comprising an office complex, and accommodation for the park staff and visiting scientists.

==Transportation==

Located 48 km south of Kota Kinabalu and the Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park, Pulau Tiga National Park is reached by driving the 140 km to Kuala Penyu, a small settlement on the tip of the Klias Peninsula.
