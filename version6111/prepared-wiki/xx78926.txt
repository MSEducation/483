Born Ralph Lifshitz, he changed his surname to Lauren when he was 16 years old.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] “My given name has the word 'shit' in it,” he told Oprah Winfrey. “When I was a kid, the other kids would make a lot of fun of me. It was a tough name. That's why I decided to change it.  Then people said, "Did you change your name because you don't want to be Jewish?" I said, "Absolutely not. That's not what it's about. My cousins who lived in California had changed their last name to Lawrence. So I just thought, "I'm going to pick a nice last name"—it wasn't particularly connected to anything or anyone."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Oprah-Interviews-Ralph-Lauren/print/1 |title=Oprah Interviews Ralph Lauren |publisher=Oprah.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-01[/tpl]

==Career==

He went to Baruch College where he studied business, although he dropped out after two years.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] From 1962 to 1964 he served in the United States Army and left to work briefly for Brooks Brothers as a sales assistant before leaving to become a salesman for a tie company. In 1966, when he was 26, he was inspired to design a wide, European-style necktie he had seen Douglas Fairbanks Jr wearing, but the idea was rejected by the company he worked for as not being commercially viable. He left to establish his own company working out of a drawer in the Empire State Building, taking rags and turning them into ties. He sold the ties to small shops in New York, with a major turning point when he was approached by Neiman Marcus, who bought 100 dozen.
In 1967, with the financial backing of Manhattan clothing manufacturer Norman Hilton, Lauren opened a necktie store where he also sold ties of his own design, under the label "Polo."[tpl]cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5202/is_1991/ai_n19122043/ |title=Polo/Ralph Lauren Corporation – International Directory of Company Histories |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=October 14, 1939 |accessdate=2011-05-01[/tpl] He later received the rights to use the trademark Polo from Brooks Brothers, however Brooks Brothers managed to retain its rights to the iconic "original polo button-down collar" shirt (still produced today), in spite of Lauren's Polo trademark. In 1971, he expanded his line and opened a Polo boutique on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.Winfrey, Oprah. Oct. 2002:  Oprah. Web. 12 Dec. 2012. Oprah Interviews Ralph Lauren
In 1970, Ralph Lauren won the COTY Award for his menswear line.  Around that same time he released a line of women's suits that were tailored in a classic men's style, which was when the first Polo emblem was seen. It was on the cuff of the women's suit. Ralph Lauren released Polo's famous short sleeve pique shirt with the Polo logo in 1972 and unveiled his first Ralph Lauren collection for women.Lambert, Eleanor. "Ralph Lauren." 1980.
