Speyside single malts are single malt Scotch whiskies, distilled in Strathspey, the area around the River Spey in Moray and Badenoch and Strathspey, in northeastern Scotland. 
The two best-selling single malt whiskies in the world, The Glenlivet and Glenfiddich, come from Speyside. Speyside has the greatest number of distilleries of any of the whisky-producing areas of Scotland.
Speyside whiskies can generally be classified as light and grassy (e.g. Glenlivet) or rich and sweet, (e.g. Macallan).[tpl]cn|date=October 2013[/tpl]
