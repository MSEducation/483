Kuwait, officially the State of Kuwait [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Kuwait.ogg|k|uː|ˈ|w|eɪ|t[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-ar|[tpl]big| دولة الكويت[/tpl][/tpl] Dawlat al-Kuwayt ), is an Arab country in Western Asia. Situated in the northeastern edge of the Arabian peninsula at the tip of the Persian Gulf, it shares borders with Iraq to the north and Saudi Arabia to the south. The name "Kuwait" is the diminutive of Arabic [tpl]lang|ar|[tpl]big|كوت[/tpl][/tpl] kūt, meaning "fortress".KUWAIT — Institute MEDEA The country covers an area of 17,820 square kilometers (6,880 square miles) and according to CIA has a population of 2.6 million as of 2012.

==History==

Kuwait was historically the site of settlements from the Mesopotamian Ubaid period (ca. 6500 to 3800 BC).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arabtimesonline.com/Portals/0/PDF_Files/pdf12/nov/30/04.pdf|title=Kuwait-Polish team finds Ubaid era village|work=arabtimesonline.com |accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Carter |first=Robert |title=Boat remains and maritime trade in the Persian Gulf during the sixth and fifth millennia BC |journal=Antiquity |volume=80 |issue=307 |year=2006|url=http://www.academia.edu/173149/Boat_remains_and_maritime_trade_in_the_Persian_Gulf_during_the_sixth_and_fifth_millennia_BC [/tpl] The earliest evidence of sailing has been found in Kuwait, the world's oldest reed boat was found in Subiya in northern Kuwait.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/kuwait/1314980/Secrets-of-worlds-oldest-boat-are-discovered-in-Kuwait-sands.html |title=Secrets of world's oldest boat are discovered in Kuwait sands|work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=21 August 2013[/tpl] The Kuwaiti island of Failaka was first inhabited by Mesopotamians in 2000 BC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/issues/79-1303/features/kuwait/548-meopotamian-ur-traders|title=Traders from Ur?|work=Archaeology Magazine |accessdate=21 July 2013[/tpl] In 224 AD, Kuwait fell under the control of the Sassanid Empire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gulfartguide.com/essay/kuwait/ |title=Kuwait |publisher=gulfartguide.com|accessdate=2013-07-29[/tpl] In 636 AD, the Battle of Chains between the Sassanid Empire and Rashidun Caliphate was fought in Kuwait near the town of Kazma.[tpl]cite book|author=Kurt Ray|title=A Historical Atlas of Kuwait|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RvXDiWHSxN4C&pg=PA10&dq|page=10|year=2003[/tpl] As a result of the Rashidun victory in the seventh century, an early Islamic settlement known as Kazima was founded in Kuwait, Kuwait was known as Kazima for many centuries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/archaeology/research/projects/?mode=project&id=482 |title=Kadhima : an Early Islamic settlement and landscape on Kuwait Bay |publisher=Durham University|accessdate=2013-07-28[/tpl] Kuwait was a famous trading station in the 9th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ACS3J9mVInMC&pg=PA20&dq|title=Kuwait in Pictures|work=Francesca Davis DiPiazza|year=2008|pages=20–21[/tpl]

===Economic prosperity===

In 1613, the town of Kuwait was founded in modern-day Kuwait City. In 1716, the Bani Utubs settled in Kuwait. At the time of the arrival of the Utubs, Kuwait was inhabited by a few fishermen and primarily functioned as a fishing village.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R0NH1CbXf24C&pg=PA64&dq|title=Constancy and Change in Contemporary Kuwait City: The Socio-cultural Dimensions of the Kuwait Courtyard and Diwaniyya|work=Mohammad Khalid A. Al-Jassar|year=2009|page=64[/tpl]
In the eighteenth century, Kuwait prospered and rapidly became the principal commercial center for the transit of goods between India, Muscat, Baghdad and Arabia.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.kw/books?id=qVBjiaTROe8C&pg=PA222&dq|title=Shadows on the Sand: The Memoirs of Sir Gawain Bell|author=Sir Gawain Bell|page=222|year=1983[/tpl] By the mid 1700s, Kuwait had already established itself as the major trading route from the Persian Gulf to Aleppo. Between the years 1775 and 1779, the Indian trade routes with Baghdad, Aleppo, Smyrna and Constantinople were diverted to Kuwait due to the Persian occupation of Basra. The Persian invasion of Basra in 1775 greatly benefited Kuwait's economy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R0NH1CbXf24C&printsec=frontcover|title=Constancy and Change in Contemporary Kuwait City: The Socio-cultural Dimensions of the Kuwait Courtyard and Diwaniyya|work= Mohammad Khalid A. Al-Jassar|year=2009|pages=66–71[/tpl]
In addition to the diversion of trade routes, many of Basra's leading merchants moved to Kuwait. The English Factory was diverted to Kuwait in 1792, which consequently expanded Kuwait's resources beyond fishing and pearling. The English Factory secured the sea routes between Kuwait, India and the east coasts of Africa. This allowed Kuwaiti vessels to venture all the way to the pearling banks of Sri Lanka and trade goods with India and East Africa.
Kuwait was the center of boat construction in the Gulf region.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WhUCAwAAQBAJ&pg=PR15&lpg=PR15&dq|title=Kuwait, 1945-1996: An Anglo-American Perspective|author=Miriam Joyce|page=XV|year=2006[/tpl] Before the dominance of steamships, Kuwaiti wooden boats were considered superior in ocean travel. Ship vessels made in Kuwait carried the bulk of international trade between India, East Africa, and Red Sea trade ports.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.kw/books?id=hcMmAQAAMAAJ&q|title=The Arabian Peninsula|author=Richard Harlakenden Sanger |page=150|year=1970[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.kw/books?id=logbAAAAIAAJ|title=Bijdragen tot de taal-, land- en volkenkunde, Volume 130|author=M. Nijhoff |page=111|year=1974[/tpl] Boats made in Kuwait were capable of sailing up to China, thus Kuwaitis were players in world trade. Kuwait's boat building industry was well known for its design and craftsmanship. Kuwaitis were regarded the best shipbuilders and sailors in the Gulf.[tpl]cite web|url=http://digitalarchive.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&context=history_theses|title= The Shia Migration from Southwestern Iran to Kuwait: Push-Pull Factors during the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries|work=Georgia State University|pages=67 & 72|year=2012[/tpl] The East India Company officer, Lewis Pelly regarded Kuwaitis the best sailors in the Gulf.
Kuwait was also the center for all caravans carrying goods between Basra, Baghdad and Aleppo. Kuwait partly functioned as a haven for merchants from Basra fleeing Ottoman government persecution.[tpl]cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g5MewSBHkG4C&pg=PA114&dq|title=The Politics of Regional Trade in Iraq, Arabia, and the Gulf, 1745-1900 |work=Hala Mundhir Fattah |year=1997 |page=114[/tpl] Kuwait was also significant in the horse trade.[tpl]cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g5MewSBHkG4C&pg=PA181&lpg=PA181&dq|title=The Politics of Regional Trade in Iraq, Arabia, and the Gulf, 1745-1900 |work=Hala Mundhir Fattah |year=1997 |page=181[/tpl] Horses were regularly shipped by the way of sailing boats from Kuwait. In the mid 19th century, it was estimated that Kuwait was exporting an average of 800 horses to India annually.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R0NH1CbXf24C&pg=PA68&dq|title=Constancy and Change in Contemporary Kuwait City: The Socio-cultural Dimensions of the Kuwait Courtyard and Diwaniyya|work=Mohammad Khalid A. Al-Jassar|year=2009|page=68[/tpl]
The strategic location of Kuwait and geopolitical turbulence in the region helped foster economic prosperity in Kuwait. Kuwait became wealthy due to Basra's instability.[tpl]cite web |url=http://books.google.com.kw/books?id=iT_8KzTECwMC&pg=PA18&dq|title=Waqai-i manazil-i Rum: Tipu Sultan's mission to Constantinople |work= Mohibbul Hasan |year= 2007 |page=18[/tpl] It was estimated that Kuwait's sea trade reached 16 million Bombay rupees by 1800, a substantial amount at that time. Economic prosperity during the late 18th century attracted many immigrants from Iran and Iraq to Kuwait. Kuwait's pre-oil population was ethnically diverse.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pubcouncil.kuniv.edu.kw/jgaps/home.aspx?id=8&Root=yes&authid=1383 |title=The Hypothetical Population Pattern of the Population Growth of the State of Kuwait in the pre-oil era |publisher=Kuwait University |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26[/tpl] The population consisted of Arabs, Persians, Africans, Jews and Armenians.
Kuwait was divided into three areas: Sharq, Jibla and Mirqab.[tpl]cite thesis|last=Taqi|first=Hanan|year=2010|title=Two ethnicities, three generations: Phonological variation and change in Kuwait|type=PhD|publisher=Newcastle University|url=https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/730/1/Taqi10.pdf|page=26[/tpl] Sharq and Jibla were the most populated areas. Sharq was inhabited by Bani Utub families and large numbers of Persians (Ajam). The number of Arabs in Sharq was very small compared to Persians. Jibla was inhabited by immigrants from different parts of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Bahrain. Mirgab was lightly populated by butchers.
In the early 20th century, Kuwait was dubbed the "Marsielles of the Gulf" because its economic vitality attracted a large variety of people. In a good year, Kuwait's annual revenue actually came up to 100,000 riyals, the governor of Basra considered Kuwait's annual revenue an astounding figure. A Western author's account of Kuwait in 1905:[tpl]cite web|url=http://ed-thelen.org/LordOfArabia-Part02.pdf|title=Lord of Arabia|pages=18–19 |work=H. C. Armstrong |year=1905[/tpl]

Kuwait was a central part of the trade in frankincense from Oman, textiles from China, and Indian spices, all destined for lucrative European markets. In the first decades of the twentieth century, Kuwait had a well-established elite: wealthy trading families who were linked by marriage and shared economic interests.[tpl]cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=D8di8GN_hKsC&pg=PA37&dq|title=Oil and Politics in the Gulf: Rulers and Merchants in Kuwait and Qatar |work=Jill Crystal |year=1995 |page=37[/tpl] The elite were long-settled, urban, Sunni families, the majority of which claim descent from the original 30 Bani Utubi families. The wealthiest families were trade merchants who acquired their wealth from long-distance commerce, shipbuilding and pearling. They were a cosmopolitan elite, they traveled extensively to India, Africa and Europe. The elite educated their sons abroad more than other Gulf Arab elite. Western visitors noted that the Kuwaiti elite used European office systems, typewriters and followed European culture with curiosity. The richest families were involved in general trade. The merchant families of Al-Ghanim and Al-Hamad were estimated to be worth millions before the 1940s.

===Downfall of economy===

In the 20th century, Kuwait immensely declined in regional economic importance, mainly due to many trade blockades and the world economic depression. Before Mary Bruins Allison visited Kuwait in 1934, Kuwait lost its prominence in long distance trade. During World War I, the British Empire imposed a trade blockade against Kuwait because Kuwait's ruler supported the Ottoman Empire. The British economic blockade heavily damaged Kuwait's economy.
The Great Depression negatively impacted Kuwait's economy starting in the late 1920s. International trading was one of Kuwait's main sources of income before oil. Kuwaiti merchants were mostly intermediary merchants. As a result of European decline of demand for goods from India and Africa, the economy of Kuwait suffered. The decline in international trade resulted in an increase in gold smuggling by Kuwaiti ships to India. Some Kuwaiti merchant families became rich due to gold smuggling to India.
Kuwait's pearling industry also collapsed as a result of the worldwide economic depression. At its height, Kuwait's pearling industry led the world's luxury market, regularly sending out between 750 and 800 ship vessels to meet the European elite's need for luxuries pearls. During the economic depression, luxuries like pearls were in little demand. The Japanese invention of cultured pearls also contributed to the collapse of Kuwait's pearling industry.
Following the Kuwait–Najd War of 1919-1920, Ibn Saud imposed a tight trade blockade against Kuwait from the years 1923 until 1937.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R0NH1CbXf24C&pg=PA80&dq|title=Constancy and Change in Contemporary Kuwait City: The Socio-cultural Dimensions of the Kuwait Courtyard and Diwaniyya|author= Mohammad Khalid A. Al-Jassar|year=2009|page=80[/tpl] The goal of the Saudi economic and military attacks on Kuwait was to annex as much of Kuwait's territory as possible. At the Uqair conference in 1922, the boundaries of Kuwait and Najd were set. Kuwait had no representative at the Uqair conference. Ibn Saud persuaded Sir Percy Cox to give him two-thirds of Kuwait's territory. More than half of Kuwait was lost due to Uqair. After the Uqair conference, Kuwait was still subjected to a Saudi economic blockade and intermittent Saudi raiding.
In 1937, Freya Stark wrote about the extent of poverty in Kuwait at the time:[tpl]cquote|Poverty has settled in Kuwait more heavily since my last visit five years ago, both by sea, where the pearl trade continues to decline, and by land, where the blockade established by Saudi Arabia now harms the merchants.[/tpl]
Some prominent merchant families left Kuwait in the early 1930s due to the prevalence of economic hardship. At the time of the discovery of oil in 1937, most of Kuwait's inhabitants were impoverished.

===Discovery of oil===

In 1937, the 15 year trade blockades against Kuwait were lifted and Kuwait's large oil reserves were discovered by the US-British Kuwait Oil Company. Exploration was delayed until after World War II, the use of oil only began in 1951. Between World War II and 1948, Kuwait's inhabitants were still largely impoverished. A few years after the end of World War II, oil exploration finally began. In 1951, a major public-work programme began to enable Kuwaitis to enjoy a better standard of living. By 1952, the country became the largest exporter of oil in the Persian Gulf region. This massive growth attracted many foreign workers, especially from India.

===Independence and beyond===

On 19 June 1961, Kuwait became independent with the end of the British protectorate; the sheikh Abdullah III Al-Salim Al-Sabah, became an emir, and the country joined the Arab League. Iraq laid claim that Kuwait was part of its territory, but formally recognized Kuwait's independence and its borders in October 1963. Under the terms of a newly drafted constitution, Kuwait held its first parliamentary elections in 1963. The exploitation of large oil fields improved Kuwait's economy. Kuwait settled its boundary disputes with Saudi Arabia and agreed on sharing equally the Saudi–Kuwaiti neutral zone's petroleum reserves. During the 1970s, the Kuwaiti government nationalized the Kuwait Oil Company, ending its partnership with British Petroleum.
In the early 1980s, Kuwait experienced a major economic crisis after the Souk Al-Manakh stock market crash and decrease in oil price.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stock-market-crash.net/souk.htm |title=Kuwait’s Souk al-Manakh Stock Bubble |publisher=Stock-market-crash.net |date=2012-06-23 |accessdate=2013-01-14[/tpl] This prompted the Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah to recall the National Assembly in 1981. However, the crisis was short-lived as Kuwait's oil production increased steadily to fill the gap caused by decrease in Iraq's and Iran's oil production due to the Iran–Iraq War. The National Assembly was dissolved again in 1986.
During the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, Kuwait supported Iraq. In 1983, the Shiite Dawa Party carried out a series of bombings, in opposition to Kuwait's support of Iraq.[tpl]cite book|last=Hunter|first=Shireen T.|title=Iran and the world : continuity in a revolutionary decade|year=1990|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=9780253328779|page=117[/tpl] After the war ended, Kuwait declined an Iraqi request to forgive its US$65 billion debt.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_213.shtml|title=Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait; 1990|work=Acig.org|accessdate=28 June 2010[/tpl] An economic rivalry between the two countries ensued after Kuwait increased its oil production by 40 percent.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=DejCbO1mvCYC&pg=PA156&dq=Kuwait+slant+drilling |title=The colonial present: Afghanistan ... |publisher=Google Books|accessdate=28 June 2010|isbn=978-1-57718-090-6|year=2004[/tpl] Tensions between the two countries increased further in July 1990, after Iraq complained to OPEC that Kuwait was stealing its oil from a field near the border by slant drilling of the Rumaila field.
On 2 August 1990, Iraqi forces invaded and annexed Kuwait. After a series of failed diplomatic negotiations, the United States led a coalition to remove the Iraqi forces from Kuwait, in what became known as the Gulf War. On 26 February 1991, the coalition succeeded in driving out the Iraqi forces. As they retreated, Iraqi forces carried out a scorched earth policy by setting oil wells on fire.[tpl]cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429014811/http://earthshots.usgs.gov/Iraq/Iraqtext |title=Iraq and Kuwait: 1972, 1990, 1991, 1997 |publisher=Earthshots: Satellite Images of Environmental Change |date= |accessdate=2013-01-14[/tpl] During the Iraqi occupation, about 1,000 Kuwaiti civilians were killed and more than 300,000 residents fled the country.[tpl]cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031025015555/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/actual/iraq/3.html |title=The Use of Terror during Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait |publisher=Jafi.org.il |date=15 May 2005 |accessdate=24 October 2010[/tpl]
The Emir and the government returned in March 1991 and imposed a three-month period of martial law.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ehistory.osu.edu/middleeast/CountryView.cfm?ID=115|title=Kuwait|work=Ehistory.osu.edu|accessdate=28 June 2010[/tpl] Kuwait paid the coalition forces US$17 billion for their war efforts. Under domestic and international pressure, Emir Jaber gave the green light to parliamentary elections in 1992. In 1993 the UN demarcated the new Kuwait-Iraq border, and Iraq officially recognised Kuwait's independence and the UN-demarcated borders in 1994.
The Emir once again dissolved the National Assembly in 1999; liberals predominated in the resulting parliamentary elections.Nohlen, D, Grotz, F & Hartmann, C (2001) Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume I, p. 161-162 ISBN 978-0-19924-958-9 In March 2003 Kuwait became the springboard for the US-led invasion of Iraq. Islamist and pro-government candidates fared well in the parliamentary elections of 2003. In May 2005, parliament approved a law allowing women to vote and run for parliament for the first time. In June the first woman cabinet minister, Massouma al-Mubarak, was appointed.
Upon the death of the Emir Jaber, in January 2006, Saad Al-Sabah succeeded him but was removed nine days later by the Kuwaiti parliament due to his ailing health. Sabah Al-Sabah was sworn in as Emir. Sheikh Nawaf Al-Sabah was named as crown prince and his nephew Nasser Al-Sabah was named as prime minister.
Parliamentary elections were held in 2006. The opposition – a loose alliance of reformists, liberals and Islamists – won nearly two-thirds of the seats despite government attempts to curb media freedoms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14647211 |title=BBC News – Kuwait profile – Timeline |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-10-17 |accessdate=2013-01-14[/tpl] The 2008 parliament was dissolved by the Emir due to constant clashes between the government and the elected MPs.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/03/19/us-kuwait-government-idUSL1911122520080319 |title=Kuwait dissolves parliament, sets May election |work=Reuters |date=19 March 2008[/tpl] The parliament was dissolved again in 2009 due to corruption allegations.

In 2011–2012 there were protests inspired by the Arab Spring. The parliament was dissolved in December 2011 due to protests against the parliament. The prime minister stepped down following protests and allegations of high-level corruption.[tpl]cite web|title=Political Climate of Kuwait|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/kuwait/general-information.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=7 February 2014[/tpl] In parliamentary elections in February 2012, the opposition won a majority. In October 2012, the Emir dissolved the parliament, paving the way for snap elections. The elections of December 2012 were boycotted by the opposition protesting against proposed changes to the electoral law which would give official candidates an advantage.

==Geography==

Located in the north-east corner of the Arabian Peninsula, Kuwait is one of the smallest countries in the world in terms of land area. It lies between latitudes 28° and 31° N, and longitudes 46° and 49° E. The flat, sandy Arabian Desert covers most of Kuwait. The country is generally low lying, with the highest point being [tpl]convert|306|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea-level. It has nine islands, all of which, with the exception of Failaka Island, are uninhabited.[tpl]cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-82709/Bubiyan |title=Bubiyan (island, Kuwait) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |work=Britannica.com|accessdate=28 June 2010[/tpl] With an area of [tpl]convert|860|km2|mi2|abbr=on[/tpl], the Bubiyan is the largest island in Kuwait and is connected to the rest of the country by a [tpl]convert|2380|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long bridge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0000613|title=Structurae en: Bubiyan Bridge (1983)|language=German|work=En.structurae.de|date=19 October 2002|accessdate=28 June 2010[/tpl] The land area is considered arable and sparse vegetation is found along its 499 km long coastline. Kuwait City is located on Kuwait Bay, a natural deep-water harbor.

==Politics==

Kuwait is a constitutional monarchy and has the oldest directly elected parliament among the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The head of state is the Emir, a hereditary office. A council of ministers, also known as cabinet ministers, aids the Prime Minister, and appoints and dismisses diplomats. The Al Sabah family has been Kuwait's monarchy since 1938,[tpl]Cite book|year=1999|title=All in the Family: Absolutism, Revolution, and Democracy in Middle Eastern Monarchies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GFdEMIkSfwEC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq|pages=68–69|author=Michael Herb[/tpl] before 1938 Kuwait's local merchants enjoyed a supremacy over the Al Sabah family.
Legislative power is vested in the National Assembly parliament and the Emir in accordance with the Constitution. The appointment of a new Emir needs the approval of the Kuwaiti parliament (per article 3 of the Constitution), therefore the parliament has the authority to remove an Emir from his post. The parliament effectively removed Saad al-Sabah from his post in 2006 due to his illness. Kuwait's judiciary system is independent from government influence and is often viewed as the most independent judiciary system in the Arab world.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/15/us-kuwait-politics-economy-idUSBRE94E0OL20130515|work=Reuters|title=Kuwait court ruling may threaten economic recovery |date=15 May 2013 |accessdate=1 July 2013[/tpl] The judicially independent Constitutional Court and the Emir both have the authority to dissolve the National Assembly but must subsequently call a national election.
The National Assembly consists of fifty elected members, who are chosen in elections held every four years. Government ministers are also granted membership in the parliament and can number up to sixteen excluding the fifty elected members. According to the Constitution of Kuwait, nomination of a new Emir or Crown Prince by the Al-Sabah monarchy has to be approved by the National Assembly. Any amendment to the constitution can be proposed by the Emir but it needs to be approved by more than two-thirds of the members of the National Assembly before being implemented.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.majlesalommah.net/enrun.asp?id=226 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040821015459/http://www.majlesalommah.net/enrun.asp?id=226 |archivedate=2004-08-21 |title=Part V General And Transitional Provisions |publisher=National Assembly – Kuwait |date=2004-08-21 |accessdate=2013-01-14[/tpl]

There have been several conflicts between the Emir, the government and the National Assembly over various policies. The National Assembly was suspended from 1976 to 1981, from 1986 to 1991 and from May 1999 to July 1999, due to irresolvable conflicts between some members of the government and the Assembly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.meepas.com/Kuwaitpoliticalsnapshot.htm|title=meepas Kuwait country profile–Kuwait politics, Political snapshot|work=Meepas.com|date=15 January 2006|accessdate=28 June 2010[/tpl] Approximately half of those who reside in Kuwait do not hold Kuwaiti citizenship and thus cannot vote in parliamentary elections.
When voting was first introduced in Kuwait in 1985, Kuwaiti women had the right to vote.[tpl]Cite book|year=2001|title=African Women and Children: Crisis and Response|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mX0_Z3-yThUC&pg=PA8&dq|page=8|author=Apollo Rwomire[/tpl] Moves to change the male-dominated political structure culminated in the re-granting of full political rights to women in 2005. In May 2005, the Parliament decided by a 35–15 vote to give women the right to vote and stand as candidates in elections. The decision raised Kuwait's eligible voter population from 139,000 to about 339,000. In 2006, the number of Kuwaiti citizens was estimated to be more than 960,000. In 2005, the former Prime Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah announced the appointment of the first female cabinet minister, Massouma Mubarak.

More generally, the growing assertiveness of parliament has led to frequent confrontations with the government. The Assembly was dissolved again by the Emir in May 2009, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Nasser al-Sabah and the rest of the Cabinet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/03/19/Kuwaiti_parliament_dissolved/UPI-75111237444712/|title=Kuwaiti parliament dissolved|work=Upi.com|date=19 March 2009|accessdate=28 June 2010[/tpl] Nationwide elections were held on 16 May 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011545/http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=ODE3NTU4MzAx|title=Elections set for May 16|work=Kuwait Times|date=14 April 2009|accessdate=28 June 2010[/tpl] In April 2010, Kuwait's government deported 17 Egyptians for trying to organize a local chapter of Mohamed ElBaradei's National Association for Change in Kuwait.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.themajlis.org/2010/04/10/kuwait-deports-17-egyptian-activists|title=Kuwait deports 17 Egyptian activists|work=The Majlis|accessdate=28 June 2010[/tpl] After opposition candidates made major gains in the elections of February 2012, the Constitutional Court annulled the elections and later the Emir made changes to the election law, changing the number for votes given from a person from four to one.
