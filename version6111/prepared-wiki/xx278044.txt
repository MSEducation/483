[tpl]quote|In 1978 there was an advert for a girl group called Cats UK. I auditioned as I was in musical theatre and I got the job - it was to sing Luton Airport. Clearly this song was done for Lorraine, she'd said it in a famous advert for Campari. But Lorraine didn't really want to have anything to do with it she objected to not being paid for it. So Cats UK ended up recording it and went to No 9 in the charts.|Deena Payne[tpl]cite news |last=Rudden |first=Liam |work=The Scotsman |title= Interview: Lorraine Chase and Deena Payne, actresses |url=http://www.scotsman.com/interviews/Interview-Lorraine-Chase-and-Deena.6466508.jp |date= 11 August 2010 |accessdate=22 December 2010[/tpl][/tpl]
