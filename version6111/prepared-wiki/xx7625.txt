==Ethical and philosophical views==

===Heterodox economics===

Rothbard rejected the application of the scientific method to economics, and dismissed econometrics, empirical and statistical analysis, and other tools of mainstream social science as useless for the study of economics.Rothbard, Murray (1976). Praxeology:  The Methodology of Austrian Economics. Mises.org He instead embraced praxeology, the strictly a priori methodology of Ludwig von Mises. Praxeology conceives of economic laws as akin to geometric or mathematical axioms: fixed, unchanging, objective, and discernible through logical reasoning, without the use of any evidence. On the account of Misesian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, eschewing the scientific method and empirical evidence distinguishes the Misesian approach "from all other current economic schools". Mark Skousen of Grantham University and the Foundation for Economic Education, a critic of mainstream economics,"Where Modern Economics Went Wrong" praises Rothbard as brilliant, his writing style persuasive, his economic arguments nuanced and logically rigorous, and his Misesian methodology sound.Mark Skousen. The Making of Modern Economics (M. E. Sharpe, 2009, p. 390). Skousen writes that Rothbard "refused to write for the academic journals." However, citing Rothbard's absence of academic publications, Skousen concedes that Rothbard was effectively "outside the discipline" of mainstream economics and that his work "fell on deaf ears" outside his ideological circles. Paralleling Skousen's remarks, Hans-Hermann Hoppe laments the fact that all non-Misesian economists dismiss the Misesian approach, which both he and Rothbard embraced, as "dogmatic and unscientific".
Though he self-identified as an Austrian economist, Rothbard's methodology was at odds with many other Austrians. In 1956, Rothbard deprecated the views of Austrian economist Fritz Machlup, stating that Machlup was no praxeologist, and calling him instead a "positivist" who failed to represent the views of Ludwig von Mises. Rothbard stated that in fact Machlup shared the opposing positivist view associated with economist Milton Friedman.In Defense of "Extreme Apriorism" Murray N. Rothbard Southern Economic Journal, January 1957, pp. 314–320 Mises and Machlup had been colleagues in 1920's Vienna before each relocated to the United States, and von Mises later urged his American protege, Israel Kirzner, to pursue his PhD studies with Machlup at Johns Hopkins University.[tpl]cite web|last=Kirzner|first=Israel|title=Interview of Israel Kirzner|url=http://www.mises.org/journals/aen/aen17_1_1.asp|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=17 June 2013[/tpl] Professors Gabriel J. Zanotti and Nicolas Cachanosky recently reviewed the controversy.  They prefer Machlup's reading of Mises to Rothbard's, and state, " Machlup's interpretation shows that Austrian epistemology is well grounded in post-Popperian epistemology and that most criticisms of Austrian economics based on its aprioristic character are misplaced. Furthermore, Machlup's interpretation provides us with a setting to re-build the academic interaction between Austrians and non-Austrians that was characteristic of the early twentieth century."  They conclude that Rothbard's approach to economics was an "outdated and untenable extreme apriorism."[tpl]cite web|last=Gabriel J.

According to libertarian economists Tyler Cowen and Richard Fink,[tpl]cite journal|last=Tyler Cowen and Richard Fink|title=Inconsistent Equilibrium Constructs: The Evenly Rotating Equilibrium Economy of Mises and Rothbard|journal=American Economic Review|year=1985|page=866|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1821365|accessdate=24 August 2013[/tpl] Rothbard wrote that the term evenly rotating economy ("ERE") can be used to analyze complexity in a world of change. The words ERE had been introduced by von Mises as an alternative nomenclature for the mainstream economic method of static equilibrium and general equilibrium analysis. Cowen and Fink found "serious inconsistencies in both the nature of the ERE and its suggested uses."  With the sole exception of Rothbard, no other economist adopted Mises' term, and the concept continued to be called "equilibrium analysis."[tpl]cite journal|last=Gunning|first=Patrick|title=Mises on the Evenly Rotating Economy|journal=Journal of Austrian Economics|volume=3|issue=3|url=http://mises.org/periodical.aspx?Id=4[/tpl]
In a blog post written in response to Lew Rockwell's claim that Rothbard has been much more influential than Milton Friedman,http://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/rothbard-rules/, LewRockwell.com, July 25, 2011 economist George Selgin wrote that "as a monetary economist, Rothbard was mediocre to bad. His version of the Austrian business cycle theory was naive – in essence it equated behavior of M consistent with keeping interest rates at their "natural" levels with the elimination of fractional-reserve banking, an equation that holds only with the help of about a dozen auxiliary assumptions, all of which are patently false. He then went on to conjure up an equally false history of banking and of bank contracts designed to square his theory of the cycle, with its implied condemnation of fractional reserve banking, with his libertarian ethics."[tpl]cite web|last=Selgin|first=George|title=Me Murray and Milton|url=http://www.freebanking.org/2011/07/28/me-murray-and-milton/|publisher=Free Banking|accessdate=4 September 2013[/tpl] Rothbard strongly opposed central banking, fiat money, and fractional reserve banking and advocated a gold standard and a 100% reserve requirement for banks.[tpl]rp|pages=89–94, 96–97[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://mises.org/daily/1829 |first=Murray |last=Rothbard |title=The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar |year=1991 |origyear=1962 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |accessdate=August 13, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north769.html |title=What Is Money?

In an 2011 article critical of Rothbard's "reflexive opposition" to inflation, The Economist noted that his views are increasingly gaining influence among politicians and laypeople on the Right. The article contrasted Rothbard's categorical rejection of inflationary policies with the monetary views of "sophisticated Austrian-school monetary economists such as George Selgin and Larry White, who defend rule-based inflation-targeting policies not all that different from Mr Sumner's"."free marketeers and inflation." The Economist
According to economist Peter Boettke, Rothbard is better described as a property rights economist than as an Austrian economist.  In 1988, Boettke noted that Rothbard "vehemently attacked all of the books of the younger Austrians".[tpl]cite journal|last=Boettke|first=Peter|title=Economists and Liberty: Murray N.

====Polemics against mainstream economists====

Rothbard authored a series of scathing polemics aimed at discrediting key figures in the development of modern mainstream economics. He vilified Adam Smith, calling him a "shameless plagiarist" who set economics off-track, ultimately leading to the rise of Marxism. In response to Rothbard's charge that Smith's The Wealth of Nations was largely plagiarized, David Friedman castigated Rothbard's scholarship and character, saying that he "was either deliberately dishonest or never really read the book he was criticizing".Casey, Gerard (2010). Murray Rothbard. New York, NY: The Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 112. ISBN 978-1-4411-4209-2. Tony Endres called Rothbard's treatment of Adam Smith a "travesty".Tony Endres, review of Classical Economics: An Austrian Perspective, History of Economics Review, http://www.hetsa.org.au/pdf-back/23-RA-7.pdf Rothbard was contemptuous of John Maynard Keynes,Keynes the Man, originally published in Dissent on Keynes: A Critical Appraisal of Keynesian Economics, Edited by Mark Skousen. New York: Praeger, 1992, pp. 171–198; Online edition at The Ludwig von Mises Institute and wrote that governmental regulation of money and credit creates a "dismal monetary and banking situation". He demeaned John Stuart Mill as a "wooly man of mush", and speculated that Mill's "soft" personality led his economic thought astray.Gordon, David (1999). "John Stuart Mill on Liberty and Control." The Mises Review
Rothbard denigrated Milton Friedman, a Nobel Laureate economist and a competing libertarian theorist. In a polemic entitled "Milton Friedman Unraveled", he maligned Friedman as a "statist", a "favorite of the establishment", a friend of and "apologist" for Richard Nixon, and a "pernicious influence"  on public policy.Ruger, William (2013). Meadowcroft, John, ed. Milton Friedman. Major Conservative and Libertarian Thinkers. New York, NY: Bloomsbury. p.174Rothbard, Murray (1971). "Milton Friedman Unraveled." LewRockwell.com Rothbard said that libertarians should scorn rather than celebrate Friedman's academic prestige and political influence. Noting that Rothbard has "been nasty to me and my work", Friedman responded to Rothbard's criticism by calling him a "cult builder and a dogmatist."Doherty, Brian (1995). "Best of Both Worlds." Reason
In a memorial volume published by the Mises Institute, his protégé Hans-Hermann Hoppe wrote that Rothbard's Man, Economy, and State "presented a blistering refutation of all variants of mathematical economics." and listed this as among Rothbard's "almost mind-boggling achievements". Hoppe lamented that like his own mentor Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard died without winning the Nobel Prize which Hoppe says Rothbard deserved "twice over." Though Hoppe conceded that Rothbard and his work were largely ignored by academia, he called Rothbard an intellectual giant comparable to Aristotle, Locke and Kant.[tpl]cite book|last=Rockwell|first=Llewellyn|title=Murray N. Rothbard In Memoriam|year=1995|publisher=Mises Institute|location=Alabama, USA|pages=33–37|url=http://mises.org/books/memoriam.pdf[/tpl]

===Ethics===

Although Rothbard adopted von Mises' deductive methodology for his social theory and economics,Grimm, Curtis M.; Hunn, Lee; Smith, Ken G. Strategy as Action: Competitive Dynamics and Competitive Advantage. New York Oxford University Press (US). 2006. p. 43 he parted with Mises on the question of ethics. Specifically, he rejected Mises conviction that ethical values remain subjective, and opposed utilitarianism in favor of principle-based, natural law reasoning. In defense of his free market views, Mises employed utilitarian economic arguments aimed at demonstrating that interventionist policies made all of society worse off. Rothbard, on the other hand, concluded that interventionist policies do in fact benefit some people, including certain government employees and beneficiaries of social programs. Therefore, unlike Mises, Rothbard attempted to assert an objective, natural law basis for the free market.[tpl]rp|pages=87–89[/tpl] He called this principle "self-ownership," loosely basing the idea on the writings of John LockeOlsaretti, Serena. 2004. Liberty, Desert and the Market. Cambridge University Press. p. 91 and also borrowing concepts from classical liberalism and the anti-imperialism of the Old Right.[tpl]rp|page=134[/tpl] 
Rothbard accepted the Labor theory of property, but rejected the Lockean proviso, arguing that if an individual mixes his labor with unowned land then he becomes the proper owner eternally, and that after that time it is private property which may change hands only by trade or gift.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1536-7150.2004.00298.x |title=31 Reckoning with Rothbard |year=2004 |last1=Kyriazi |first1=Harold |journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=451–84[/tpl]
Rothbard was a strong critic of egalitarianism. The title essay of Rothbard's 1974 book Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays held, "Equality is not in the natural order of things, and the crusade to make everyone equal in every respect (except before the law) is certain to have disastrous consequences."George C. Leef, "Book Review of Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays by Murray Rothbard", edited by David Gordon (2000 edition), The Freeman, July 2001. In it, Rothbard wrote, "At the heart of the egalitarian left is the pathological belief that there is no structure of reality; that all the world is a tabula rasa that can be changed at any moment in any desired direction by the mere exercise of human will."Rothbard, Murray (2003). "Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays", essay published in full at Lewrockwell.com. See also Rothbard's essay "The Struggle Over Egalitarianism Continues", the 1991 introduction to republication of Freedom, Inequality, Primitivism, and the Division of Labor, Ludwig Von Mises Institute, 2008.
In a critical examination of Rothbard's ethical and political theories, Noam Chomsky notes that they are not taken seriously by mainstream philosophers and academics.Noam Chomsky, Understanding Power, The Indispensable Chomsky (New York: New York Press, 2002), p. 398

===Anarcho-capitalism===

Various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to "anarcho-capitalism."  The first person to use the term, however, was Murray Rothbard, who in the mid-20th century synthesized elements from the Austrian School of economics, classical liberalism, and 19th-century American individualist anarchists.Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, 1987, ISBN 978-0-631-17944-3, p. 290; quote: "A student and disciple of the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard combined the laissez-faire economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker." According to Llewellyn Rockwell, Rothbard is the "conscience" of all the various strains of libertarian anarchism, whose contemporary advocates are former "colleagues" of Rothbard personally inspired by his example.Rockwell, Llewellyn (1995).  "Murray N. Rothbard: In Memoriam." pp. 117
During his years at graduate school in the late 1940s, Murray Rothbard considered whether a strict laissez-faire policy would require that private police agencies replace government protective services. He visited Baldy Harper, a founder of the Foundation for Economic Education,[tpl]cite book | editor = Ronald Hamowy |title=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism|year=Aug 15, 2008|publisher=SAGE|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=978-1-4129-6580-4|page=623|url=http://books.google.com/?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC&dq=libertarian+encyclopedia[/tpl][tpl]Cite news | last = Rothbard | first = Murray N | title = Floyd Arthur 'Baldy' Harper, RIP | work = Mises Daily | date = 2007-08-17 [/tpl] who doubted the need for any government whatsoever.  During this period, Rothbard was influenced by nineteenth-century American individualist anarchists, like Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker, and the Belgian economist Gustave de Molinari who wrote about how such a system could work.[tpl]rp|pages=12–13[/tpl] Thus he "combined the laissez-faire economics of Mises with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state" from individualist anarchists. In an unpublished memo written around 1949 Rothbard concluded that in order to believe in laissez-faire one must also embrace anarchism.[tpl]rp|pages=12–13[/tpl]
Rothbard began to consider himself a private property anarchist in 1950 and later began to use "anarcho-capitalist" to describe his political ideology.Roberta Modugno Crocetta, Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism in the contemporary debate. A critical defense, Ludwig Von Mises Institute.[tpl]cite journal|last=Oliver|first=Michael|title=Exclusive Interview With Murray Rothbard|journal=The New Banner: A Fortnightly Libertarian Journal|date=February 25, 1972|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard103.html |quote=Capitalism is the fullest expression of anarchism, and anarchism is the fullest expression of capitalism.[/tpl] In his anarcho-capitalist model, a system of protection agencies compete in a free market and are voluntarily supported by consumers who choose to use their protective and judicial services. Anarcho-capitalism would mean the end of the state monopoly on force.
In Man, Economy, and State, Rothbard divides the various kinds of state intervention in three categories: "autistic intervention", which is interference with private non-economic activities; "binary intervention", which is forced exchange between individuals and the state; and "triangular intervention", which is state-mandated exchange between individuals. According to Sanford Ikeda, Rothbard's typology "eliminates the gaps and inconsistencies that appear in Mises's original formulation."Ikeda, Sanford, Dyamics of the Mixed Economy: Toward a Theory of Interventionism, Routledge UK, 1997, 245.Rothbard, Murray. Chapter 2 "Fundamentals of Intervention" from Man, Economy and State, Ludwig von Mises Institute. Rothbard writes in Power and Market that the role of the economist in a free market is limited but is much larger in a government that solicits economic policy recommendations. Rothbard argues that self-interest therefore prejudices the views of many economists in favor of increased government intervention.Peter G. Klein, "Why Intellectuals Still Support Socialism", Ludwig von Mises Institute, November 15, 2006Man, Economy, and State, Chapter 7 – Conclusion: Economics and Public Policy, Ludwig Von Mises Institute.

===Race, gender and civil rights===

Michael O'Malley, Associate Professor of History at George Mason University, characterizes Rothbard's "overall tone regarding" the black civil rights movement and the women's suffrage movement to be "contemptuous and hostile".O'Malley, Michael (2012). Face Value: The Entwined Histories of Money and Race in America. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. pp. 205-207 On O'Malley's account, "Rothbard found the idea of freedom for Negroes alarming because they did not understand it properly". Rothbard vilified women's rights activists, attributing the growth of the welfare state to politically active spinsters "whose busybody inclinations were not fettered by the responsibilities of health and heart". He believed that Jewish and lesbian women were responsible for the movement to enact child labor laws, which he viewed with disgust.Berlet, Chip (Summer 2003). "Into the Mainstream." Southern Poverty Law Center. O'Malley summarized Rothbard's views: "votes for women and equality for African Americans ... upset the natural order".
Rothbard called for the elimination of "the entire 'civil rights' structure" stating that it "tramples on the property rights of every American." Rothbard also urged the (state) police to crackdown on "street criminals", writing that "cops must be unleashed" and "and allowed to administer instant punishment, subject of course to liability when they are in error". He also advocated that the police "clear the streets of bums and vagrants", and quipped "Who cares?" in response to the question of where these people would go after being removed from public property.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Sanchez |first1=Julian |last2=Weigel |first2=David |title=Who Wrote Ron Paul's Newsletters? |journal=Reason |date=January 16, 2008 |url=http://reason.com/archives/2008/01/16/who-wrote-ron-pauls-newsletter/singlepage |accessdate=August 14, 2013[/tpl]
Rothbard held strong opinions about many leaders of the civil rights movement. He considered black separatist Malcolm X to be a "great black leader" and integrationist Martin Luther King to be favored by whites because he "was the major restraining force on the developing Negro revolution."[tpl]Page needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] Rothbard praised Malcolm X for "acting white" through use of his intellect and wit, and contrasted him favorably with the "fraudulent intellectual with a rococo Black Baptist minister style, "Dr." King". But while he compared Malcolm X's black nationalism favorably to King's integrationism, he ultimately rejected the vision of a "separate black nation", asking "does anyone really believe that ... New Africa would be content to strike out on its own, with no massive "foreign aid" from the U.S.A.?"Rothbard, Murray N. (February 1993). "Their Malcolm ... and Mine." LewRockwell.com Rothbard also suggested that opposition to King, whom he demeaned as a "coercive integrationist", should be a litmus test for members of his "paleolibertarian" political movement.Pendelton, Arthur (May 14, 2008).

====Race and intelligence====

Both Michael O'Malley and political scientist Jean Hardisty have noted Rothbard's "praise" of the argument, made in Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's book The Bell Curve, that blacks are genetically inferior to whites with respect to intelligence.Hardisty, Jean (1999). Mobilizing Resentment, Conservative Resurgence from the John Birch Society to the Promise Keepers. Boston, MA: Beacon Press. pp. 165-167. Author holds a Ph.D. in Political Science from Northwestern University. Both authors quote Rothbard's remark that intellectual and "temperamental" differences between races are “self-evident”.
O'Malley quotes Rothbard as stating that public acceptance of the book's thesis "would put a bullet through the heart of the egalitarian socialist project", by providing an intellectual justification for racial inequalities.Rothbard, Murray (December, 1994). "Race! That Murray Book." LewRockwell.com

===Opposition to war===

Like Randolph Bourne, Rothbard believed that "war is the health of the state." According to David Gordon, this was the reason for Rothbard's opposition to aggressive foreign policy. Rothbard believed that stopping new wars was necessary and that knowledge of how government had led citizens into earlier wars was important. Two essays expanded on these views "War, Peace, and the State" and "The Anatomy of the State." Rothbard used insights of Vilfredo Pareto, Gaetano Mosca, and Robert Michels to build a model of state personnel, goals, and ideology.[tpl]cite web |first=Joseph R. |last=Stromberg |url=http://antiwar.com/stromberg/?articleid=4296 |title=Murray Rothbard on States, War, and Peace: Part I |date=January 10, 2005 |publisher=Antiwar.com |origyear=first published June 12, 2000[/tpl] Also see Part II, originally published June 20, 2000.See both essays: Rothbard, Murray.

Rothbard's The Libertarian Forum blamed the Middle East conflict on Israeli aggression "fueled by American arms and money." Rothbard warned that the mid-East conflict would draw the U.S. into a world war. He was strongly anti-Zionist and also opposed U.S. involvement in the Middle East.

Rothbard's colleague Joseph Stromberg notes that Rothbard made two exceptions to his general condemnation of war: "the American Revolution and the War for Southern Independence, as viewed from the Confederate side."Stromberg, Joseph (June 12, 2000). "Murray N. Rothbard on States, War, and Peace: Part I." Antiwar.com Rothbard condemned the "Northern war against slavery", saying it was inspired by "fanatical" religious faith and characterized by "a cheerful willingness to uproot institutions, to commit mayhem and mass murder, to plunder and loot and destroy, all in the name of high moral principle".Rothbard, Murray (1991).

===Historical revisionism===

Rothbard embraced "historical revisionism" as an antidote to what he perceived to be the dominant influence exerted by corrupt "court intellectuals" over mainstream historical narratives.[tpl]rp|pages=15, 62, 141[/tpl]Rothbard, Murray (February, 1976). "The Case for Revisionism." Mises.org Rothbard wrote that these mainstream intellectuals distorted the historical record in favor of "the state" in exchange for "power, prestige, and loot" from the state.[tpl]Page needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] Rothbard characterized the revisionist task as "penetrating the fog of lies and deception of the State and its Court Intellectuals, and to present to the public the true history". He was influenced by and a champion of Harry Elmer Barnes.Rothbard, Murray (February, 1976). "The Case for Revisionism." Mises.orgBertrand Badie, Dirk Berg-Schlosser, Leonardo Morlino, Editors, International Encyclopedia of Political Science, Volume 1, "Revisionism" entry, SAGE, 2011 p 2310, ISBN 1412959632[tpl]cite book |last=Raimondo |first=Justin |authorlink=Justin Raimondo |title=An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N.

Rothbard endorsed Barnes's revisionism on World War II, favorably citing his view that "the murder of Germans and Japanese was the overriding aim of World War II". In addition to broadly supporting his historical views, Rothbard promoted Barnes as an influence for future revisionists.Rothbard, Murray (1968). "Harry Elmer Barnes as Revisionist of the Cold War."
Rothbard's endorsing of World War II revisionism and his association with Barnes and other Holocaust deniers have drawn criticism from within the political right. Kevin D. Williamson wrote an opinion piece published by National Review which condemned Rothbard for "making common cause with the 'revisionist' historians of the Third Reich", a term he used to describe American Holocaust deniers associated with Rothbard, such as James J. Martin of the Institute for Historical Review. The piece also characterized "Rothbard and his faction" as being "culpably indulgent" of Holocaust denial, the view which "specifically denies that the Holocaust actually happened or holds that it was in some way exaggerated".Williamson, Kevin D. (January 23, 2012). "Courting the Cranks." National Review, January 2013 edition. p. 4 [tpl]Subscription required[/tpl]
In an article for Rothbard's 50th birthday, Rothbard's friend and Buffalo State College historian Ralph Raico stated that Rothbard "is the main reason that revisionism has become a crucial part of the whole libertarian position."[tpl]cite web|last=Raico|first=Ralph|title=Rothbard at his Semi-Centennial|url=http://mises.org/daily/4436/Murray-Rothbard-at-His-Semicentennial|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=15 November 2013[/tpl]

===Children's rights and parental obligations===

In the Ethics of Liberty, Rothbard explores issues regarding children's rights in terms of self-ownership and contract.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.l4l.org/library/chilroth.html |title=Children's Rights versus Murray Rothbard's The Ethics of Liberty |first=John |last=Walker |year=1991 |publisher=Libertarians for Life |accessdate=August 13, 2013[/tpl] These include support for a woman's right to abortion, condemnation of parents showing aggression towards children, and opposition to the state forcing parents to care for children. He also holds children have the right to run away from parents and seek new guardians as soon as they are able to choose to do so. He asserted that parents have the right to put a child out for adoption or sell the rights to the child in a voluntary contract in what Rothbard suggests will be a "flourishing free market in children". He believes that selling children as consumer goods in accord with market forces, while "superficially monstrous", will benefit "everyone" involved in the market: "the natural parents, the children, and the foster parents purchasing".The Ethics of Liberty, Chapter 14 "Children and Rights."See also: Hamowy, Ronald (editor) (2008). The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism, Cato Institute, SAGE, pp. 59–61, ISBN 1-4129-6580-2, ISBN 978-1-4129-6580-4 [tpl]OCLC|233969448[/tpl]
In Rothbard's view of parenthood, "the parent should not have a legal obligation to feed, clothe, or educate his children, since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights." Thus, Rothbard stated that parents should have the legal right to let any infant die by starvation. However, according to Rothbard, "the purely free society will have a flourishing free market in children". In a fully libertarian society, he wrote, "the existence of a free baby market will bring such 'neglect' down to a minimum".
Economist Gene Callahan of Cardiff University, formerly a scholar at the Rothbard-affiliated Mises Institute, observes that Rothbard allows "the logical elegance of his legal theory" to "trump any arguments based on the moral reprehensibility of a parent idly watching her six-month-old child slowly starve to death in its crib."[tpl]cite journal |last=Callahan |first=Gene |authorlink=Gene Callahan (economist) |date=February 2013 |url=http://ppe.sagepub.com/content/12/1/48.full.pdf+html |title=Liberty versus Libertarianism |journal=Politics, Philosophy & Economics |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=48–67 |doi=10.1177/1470594X11433739 |issn=1470-594X |oclc=828009007 |subscription=yes[/tpl]

===Retributive theory of criminal justice===

In The Ethics of Liberty, Rothbard advocates for a "frankly retributive theory of punishment" or a system of "a tooth (or two teeth) for a tooth".[tpl]cite book |url=http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/thirteen.asp |chapter=Punishment and Proportionality |pages=85–97 |author=Rothbard, Murray |title=The Ethics of Liberty |publisher=New York University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-8147-7506-3[/tpl] Rothbard emphasizes that all punishment must be proportional, stating that "the criminal, or invader, loses his rights to the extent that he deprived another man of his".Morimura, Susumu (1999). Libertarian theories of punishment. In P. Smith & P. Comanducci (Eds.), Legal Philosophy: General Aspects: Theoretical Examinations and Practical Application (pp. 135-138). New York, NY: Franz Steiner Verlag. Applying his retributive theory, Rothbard states that a thief "must pay double the extent of theft". Rothbard gives the example of a thief who stole $15,000, and says he not only would have to return the stolen money, but also provide the victim an additional $15,000, money to which the thief has forfeited his right. The thief would be "put in a temporary state of enslavement to his victim" if he is unable to pay him immediately. Rothbard also applies his theory to justify beating and torturing violent criminals, although the beatings are required to be proportional to the crimes for which they are being punished.

====Torture of criminal suspects====

In chapter twelve of Ethics,[tpl]cite book |url=http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/twelve.asp |chapter=Self-Defense |pages=77–84 |author=Rothbard, Murray |title=The Ethics of Liberty |publisher=New York University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-8147-7506-3[/tpl] Rothbard turns his attention to suspects arrested by the police. He argues that police should be able to torture certain types of criminal suspects, including accused murderers, for information related to their alleged crime. Writes Rothbard, "Suppose ... police beat and torture a suspected murderer to find information (not to wring a confession, since obviously a coerced confession could never be considered valid). If the suspect turns out to be guilty, then the police should be exonerated, for then they have only ladled out to the murderer a parcel of what he deserves in return; his rights had already been forfeited by more than that extent. But if the suspect is not convicted, then that means that the police have beaten and tortured an innocent man, and that they in turn must be put into the dock for criminal assault". Gene Callahan examines this position and concludes that Rothbard rejects the widely held belief that torture is inherently wrong, no matter who the victim. Callahan goes on to state that Rothbard's scheme gives the police a strong motive to frame the suspect, after having tortured him or her.

===Science, scientism and evolution===

In an essay condemning "scientism in the study of man", Rothbard rejected the application of causal determinism to human beings, arguing that the actions of human beings, as opposed to those of everything else in nature, are not determined by prior causes but by "free will".Rothbard, Murray (1960). "The Mantle of Science." Reprinted from Scientism and Values, Helmut Schoeck and James W. Wiggins, eds. (Princeton, N.J.: D. Van Nostrand), 1960, pp. 159–180, ISBN 978-0405004360 ; The Logic of Action One: Method, Money, and the Austrian School (Cheltenham UK: Edward Elgar, 1997), pp. 3–23. ISBN 978-1858980157 He argued that "determinism as applied to man, is a self-contradictory thesis, since the man who employs it relies implicitly on the existence of free will." Rothbard opposed what he considered the overspecialization of the academy and sought to fuse the disciplines of economics, history, ethics, and political science to create a "science of liberty." Rothbard described the moral basis for his anarcho-capitalist position in two of his books: For a New Liberty, published in 1973, and The Ethics of Liberty, published in 1982. In his Power and Market (1970), Rothbard describes how a stateless economy might function.

Jr (December 29, 2007). "Ron Paul's 'Evolution Denial'?" LewRockwell.com[tpl]Synthesis-inline|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Political activism==

As a young man, Rothbard considered himself part of the Old Right, an anti-statist and anti-interventionist branch of the Republican Party. In the 1948 presidential election, Rothbard, "as a Jewish student at Columbia, horrified his peers by organizing a Students for Strom Thurmond chapter, so staunchly did he believe in states' rights."[tpl]cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Daniel |date=March 12, 2007 |url=http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/mar/12/00027/ |title=Enemies of the State |publisher=The American Conservative |accessdate=August 13, 2013[/tpl]
By the late 1960s, Rothbard's "long and winding yet somehow consistent road had taken him from anti-New Deal and anti-interventionist Robert Taft supporter into friendship with the quasi-pacifist Nebraska Republican Congressman Howard Buffett (father of Warren Buffett) then over to the League of (Adlai) Stevensonian Democrats and, by 1968, into tentative comradeship with the anarchist factions of the New Left."[tpl]cite news |last=Kauffman |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Kauffman |date=May 19, 2008 |url=http://www.amconmag.com/article/2008/may/19/00009/ |title=When the Left Was Right |publisher=The American Conservative |accessdate=August 13, 2013[/tpl] Rothbard advocated an alliance with the New Left anti-war movement, on the grounds that the conservative movement had been completely subsumed by the statist establishment. However, Rothbard later criticized the New Left for supporting a "People's Republic" style draft. It was during this phase that he associated with Karl Hess and founded Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought with Leonard Liggio and George Resch, which existed from 1965 to 1968.
From 1969 to 1984 he edited The Libertarian Forum, also initially with Hess (although Hess's involvement ended in 1971).[tpl]cite web |url=http://mises.org/daily/4330 |title=Karl Hess and the Death of Politics |first=Jeff |last=Riggenbach |date=May 13, 2010 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |accessdate=August 13, 2013[/tpl] The Libertarian Forum provided a platform for Rothbard's writing. Despite its small readership, it engaged conservatives associated with the National Review in nation-wide debate. Rothbard rejected the view that Ronald Reagan's 1980 election as President was a victory for libertarian principles, and he attacked Reagan's economic program in a series of Libertarian Forum articles. In 1982, Rothbard called Reagan's claims of spending cuts a "fraud" and a "hoax", and accused Reaganites of doctoring the economic statistics in order to give the false impression that their policies were successfully reducing inflation and unemployment.Ronald Lora, William Henry Longton, editors, The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America, Chapter "The Libertarian Forum", Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, p. 372, ISBN 0313213909,
Rothbard criticized the "frenzied nihilism" of left-wing libertarians, but also criticized right-wing libertarians who were content to rely only on education to bring down the state; he believed that libertarians should adopt any moral tactic available to them in order to bring about liberty.[tpl]cite book |first=Marvin |last=Perry |chapter=Libertarian Forum 1969–1986 |editor1-last=Lora |editor1-first=Ronald |editor2-last=Henry |editor2-first=William Longton (eds.) |title=The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1999 |isbn=0-313-21390-9 |oclc=40481045 |page=369[/tpl]
Imbibing Randolph Bourne's idea that "war is the health of the state", Rothbard opposed all wars in his lifetime, and engaged in anti-war activism. During the 1970s and 1980s, Rothbard was active in the Libertarian Party. He was frequently involved in the party's internal politics. He was one of the founders of the Cato Institute, and "came up with the idea of naming this libertarian think tank after Cato's Letters, a powerful series of British newspaper essays by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon which played a decisive influence upon America's Founding Fathers in fomenting the Revolution."[tpl]cite web |last=Burris |first=Charles |date=February 4, 2011 |url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/kochs-v-soros-a-partial-backstory/ |title=Kochs v.

He opposed the "low-tax liberalism" espoused by 1980 Libertarian Party presidential candidate Ed Clark and Cato Institute president Edward H Crane III. According to Charles Burris, "Rothbard and Crane became bitter rivals after disputes emerging from the 1980 LP presidential campaign of Ed Clark carried over to strategic direction and management of Cato."
Rothbard split with the Radical Caucus at the 1983 national convention over cultural issues and aligned himself with what he called the "right-wing populist" wing of the party, notably Lew Rockwell and Ron Paul, who ran for President on the Libertarian Party ticket in 1988. "Rothbard worked closely with Lew Rockwell (joined later by his long-time friend Burt Blumert) in nurturing the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and the publication, The Rothbard-Rockwell Report; which after Rothbard's 1995 death evolved into the website, LewRockwell.com."

===Paleolibertarianism===

In 1989, Rothbard left the Libertarian Party and began building bridges to the post-Cold War anti-interventionist right, calling himself a paleolibertarian, a conservative reaction against the cultural liberalism of mainstream libertarianism.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Sanchez |first1=Julian |last2=Weigel |first2=David |title=Who Wrote Ron Paul's Newsletters? |journal=Reason |date=January 16, 2008 |url=http://reason.com/archives/2008/01/16/who-wrote-ron-pauls-newsletter/singlepage |accessdate=August 14, 2013[/tpl]Rothbard, Murray (November 1994). "Big Government Libertarianism", Lew Rockwell.com Paleolibertarianism sought to appeal to disaffected working class whites through a synthesis of cultural conservatism and libertarian economics.
A 2014 article in the New York Times noted that Rothbard "applauded the “right-wing populism” of David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard who ran for governor of Louisiana."Tanenhaus, Saul and Rutenberg, Jim (January 25, 2014). "Rand Paul's Mixed Inheritance." The New York Times According to Reason, Rothbard advocated right-wing populism in part because he was frustrated that mainstream thinkers were not adopting the libertarian view and suggested that Duke and former Wisconsin U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy were models for an "Outreach to the Rednecks" effort that could be used by a broad libertarian/paleoconservative coalition. Working together, the paleo coalition would expose the "unholy alliance of 'corporate liberal' Big Business and media elites, who, through big government, have privileged and caused to rise up a parasitic Underclass." Rothbard blamed this "Underclass" for "looting and oppressing the bulk of the middle and working classes in America." In addition to praising Duke's political strategy, Rothbard favored Duke's substantive political program, stating that there was "nothing" in it that "could not also be embraced by paleoconservatives or paleo-libertarians; lower taxes, dismantling the bureaucracy, slashing the welfare system, attacking affirmative action and racial set-asides, calling for equal rights for all Americans, including whites."[tpl]cite web |first=Murray |last=Rothbard |url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch5.html |title=Right-wing Populism |publisher=LewRockwell.com |date=January 1992 |accessdate=August 14, 2013[/tpl] Originally published in the January 1992 Rothbard-Rockwell Report.

Rothbard supported the presidential campaign of Pat Buchanan in 1992, and wrote that "with Pat Buchanan as our leader, we shall break the clock of social democracy."[tpl]cite web |first=Murray|last=Rothbard |url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard219.html |title=Strategy for the Right |publisher=LewRockwell.com |accessdate=August 14, 2013[/tpl] First published in The Rothbard-Rockwell Report, January 1992. In the January 1992 Rothbard-Rockwell Report, Rothbard's friend and confidante Llewellyn Rockwell reflected on the paleolibertarian vision, stating "We have a dream. (Hell, if 'Dr.' King can have a dream, why can't we?) Our dream is that, one day, we Buchananites can present Mr. and Mrs. America, and all the liberal and conservative and centrist elites, with a dramatic choice....We can say: 'Look, gang: you have a choice, it's either Pat Buchanan or David Duke."Sanchez, Julian and Weigel, David (January 16, 2008).

Like Buchanan, Rothbard opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).Reese, Charley (1993-10-14) "The U.S. Standard Of Living Will Decline If Nafta Is Approved", Orlando Sentinel However, by 1995, Rothbard had become disillusioned with Buchanan, believing that the latter's "commitment to protectionism was mutating into an all-round faith in economic planning and the nation state."Lew Rockwell, "What I Learned From Paleoism", LewRockwell.com, 2002.
After Rothbard's death in 1995 Lew Rockwell, President of the von Mises Institute, told The New York Times that Rothbard was "the founder of right-wing anarchism". William F. Buckley, Jr. wrote a critical obituary in the National Review criticizing Rothbard's "defective judgment" and views on the Cold War.[tpl]rp|pages=3–4[/tpl] The von Mises Institute published Murray N. Rothbard, In Memoriam which included memorials from 31 individuals, including libertarians and academics.Murray N. Rothbard, In Memoriam, Preface by JoAnn Rothbard, edited by Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr, published by Ludwig von Mises Institute,1995. Journalist Brian Doherty summarizes Buckley's obituary as follows: "when Rothbard died in 1995, his old pal William Buckley took pen in hand to piss on his grave. Rothbard, Buckley wrote, spent his life "huffing and puffing in the little cloister whose walls he labored so strenuously to contract, leaving him, in the end, not as the father of a swelling movement…but with about as many disciples as David Koresh had in his little redoubt in Waco. Yes, Murray Rothbard believed in freedom, and yes, David Koresh believed in God."[tpl]cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Jonah|title=Idealists vs. Empiricists|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/194277/idealists-v-empiricists/jonah-goldberg|publisher=New Republic|accessdate=4 September 2013[/tpl] Hoppe, Rockwell and Rothbard's colleagues at the Mises Institute took a different view, arguing that he was one of the most important philosophers in history.
