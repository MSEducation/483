==Activism==

Rodemeyer encountered bullying throughout middle school because of his homosexuality.

So just do it :) It would make everyone WAY more happier!".[tpl]cite news |author=Sandra Tan |title=Teenager struggled with bullying before taking his life |newspaper=The Buffalo News |date=September 20, 2011, updated September 27, 2011 |url=http://www.buffalonews.com/city/schools/article563538.ece |accessdate=October 17, 2011[/tpl] Despite this, he used his experiences to make videos on YouTube under the username xgothemo99xx to help others who were experiencing similar situations. He also made a video for the "It Gets Better" project, a website dedicated to preventing teen suicide.

Rodemeyer was found dead by his sister on the morning of September 18, 2011, in an apparent suicide by hanging. Before his death, he posted a final update on Twitter directed to Lady Gaga.

===Aftermath===

The Amherst, New York police department launched a criminal investigation after Jamey Rodemeyer's death, assisted by Erie County district attorney Frank Sedita. The investigation lasted nine weeks, and included analysis of Jamey's home computer and mobile phone records. Although possible evidence of criminal harassment was found, these incidents either had insufficient evidence to prosecute or were expired beyond the statute of limitations. The investigation concluded with no charges filed.[tpl]cite news|author=Sandra Tan|title=Police determine Rodemeyer incidents not prosecutable|publisher=The Buffalo News|date=November 23, 2011|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/topics/school-bullying/article644397.ece|accessdate=November 30, 2011[/tpl]
News of Jamey's death resulted in outrage by supporters worldwide. Following his death, Tim and Tracy Rodemeyer were interviewed by news media about their son and his struggles against bullying. Both parents took the opportunity to promote peace and equality in the hope of preventing occurrences similar to this.[tpl]cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/jamey-rodemeyer-suicide-ny-police-open-criminal-investigation/story?id=14580832 | title=Jamey Rodemeyer Suicide: Police Consider Criminal Bullying Charges | publisher=ABC News | work=ABC World News with Dianne Sawyer | date=September 22, 2011 | accessdate=October 17, 2011 | author=Susan Donaldson James[/tpl]
In an interview with Ann Curry on The Today Show Jamey's parents said that they, their daughter and son were still being bullied, even after his suicide.[tpl]cite web|last=Fashingbauer |first=Gael |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/44684938/ns/today-today_people/t/teens-parents-after-suicide-hes-still-being-bullied/ |title=Teen’s parents: After suicide, he’s still being bullied - TODAY People - TODAY.com |publisher=Today.msnbc.msn.com |date=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=October 13, 2011[/tpl] When his sister attended a school homecoming dance, Jamey's friends began chanting his name in support when a Lady Gaga song began playing. As a result, the very same bullies at the dance began chanting that they were glad he was dead.
Upon learning of his death, Lady Gaga stated that she was extremely upset, spending her days "reflecting, crying and yelling." She went on to dedicate her song "Hair" to Jamey during a performance at the iHeartRadio music festival at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas,  saying, "I wrote this record about how your identity is really all you've got when you're in school...so tonight, Jamey, I know you're up there looking at us and you're not a victim. You're a lesson to all of us. I know it's a bit of a downer, but sometimes the right thing is more important than the music." Lady Gaga later met with President Barack Obama to discuss what his administration would do to prevent bullying in schools.
Also in response to his death, reigning Miss New York Kaitlin Monte founded an online petition to bring the issue of cyberbullying (known as "Jamey's Law") to New York legislators.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/10/miss-new-york-petitions-against-cyberbullying-in-wake-of-williamsville-teens-s |title=Miss New York Petitions Against Cyberbullying In Wake Of Williamsville Teen's Suicide: UPDATED | New York Daily News |publisher=Nydailynews.com |date=2011-10-03 |accessdate=2011-11-08[/tpl] Shortly after, State Senator Jeffrey Klein proposed new cyberbullying legislation.

In October 2011 actor Zachary Quinto noted Rodemeyer's death as the genesis of his decision to come out publicly as gay, saying on his website "...but in light of Jamey's death – it became clear to me in an instant that living a gay life without publicly acknowledging it – is simply not enough to make any significant contribution to the immense work that lies ahead on the road to complete equality".Zachary Quinto (October 16, 2011).

That same month another teenager, Jamie Hubley, was reported to have committed suicide for the same reason. While he never explicitly talked about Rodemeyer, comparisons have been drawn.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/17/jamie-hubley-commits-suicide_n_1015646.html |title=Jamie Hubley, Gay 15-Year-Old Ottawa, Canada Teen Commits Suicide, Cites Depression, School Troubles |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= October 17, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-08 |first=Noah |last=Michelson[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.advocate.com/post/11580677515/jamie-hubley-15-commits-suicide-after-bullying |title=Jamie Hubley, 15, Commits Suicide After Bullying |publisher=News.advocate.com |date=2011-10-17 |accessdate=2011-11-08[/tpl]
The Fox TV show Glee referred to Jamey, when Finn (Cory Monteith) talked to Santana (Naya Rivera) about gay suicide in the episode I Kissed a Girl.
In 2012 the American metalcore band, The Bella Donna, produced a song based on the death of Jamey called "Don't Jump." The song has clips of one of Jamey's friends speaking on his behalf. The video has been posted at online video platform YouTube.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16VZrO8WquM
On March 27, 2013, The Gay, Lesbian and Straight Student Alliance (GLASS) of Niagara County Community College (NCCC) sponsored a performance of “Bullying is a Drag” as a tribute to Jamey.  The performance was free, open to the public, and featured entertainment by a number of drag queen entertainers from Buffalo area clubs.
