Judith Lucy's Spiritual Journey is a six-part Australian television comedy series, starring and primarily written by comedian Judith Lucy.
Judith Lucy grew up so heavily Catholic that she wanted to become a nun. By the time she left school, she was a committed atheist. Now that she's convinced there must be something in between those two extremes, she embarks on a quest to discover something to believe in.http://www.abc.net.au/tv/judithlucy/default.htm
