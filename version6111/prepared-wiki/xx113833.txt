==History==

From its origins,  (possibly Roman) until the 1920s, Predappio was a rural town of modest size, situated on the hills of Forlì. Augustus divided Italy into eleven provinces and Predappio was within the sixth province. It is believed that the town name derives from the installation in those locations of an ancient Roman family: the Appi. The town was so named Praesidium Domini Appi and abbreviated to Pre.DiAppi. 
Historically the town developed around the medieval castle, looking down the valley. Along the valley, about 2 km from Predappio, the town was known as Dovia (probably a corruption of the local Roman Road Duo Via).
Benito Mussolini was born in Predappio in 1883. After a landslide which hit the town and left many people homeless, it was decided to build a bigger, more prestigious township. The new town was built following the architectural dictates of the emerging new Fascist regime to celebrate the birthplace of Mussolini. Along with the  nearby town of Forlì, Predappio was given the title of La Città del Duce (the City of the Duce Duce: The title taken by Mussolini as Italian dictator), and became a site of pilgrimage for Fascists, and more recently, neo-Fascists.
