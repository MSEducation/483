==History==

===1990s===

Frontier Airlines was incorporated on February 8, 1994, by a group that included executives of a previous incarnation of Frontier Airlines in response to the void left by Continental Airlines 1993 shutdown of its Denver (Stapleton) hub.Our History - Frontier Airlines Scheduled flights began five months later in July 1994 utilizing Boeing 737 jetliners. Like the original, Frontier flew out of Denver and for the first 9 years used the slogan "The Spirit of the West" which was displayed above the windows and just behind the cursive letters "Frontier" on the fuselage of their aircraft. In 1999, Frontier signed agreements to begin purchasing and leasing Airbus A318 and A319 jet aircraft to expand its fleet.

===2000s===

Frontier took delivery of its first Airbus aircraft (an A319) in 2001 and simultaneously launched with it DirecTV in-flight television along with a new company livery.  Frontier Airlines was the launch customerA318 is certificated as newest and smallest Airbus aircraft of the Airbus A318 in 2003. In mid-April 2005, Frontier officially became an all-Airbus fleet, retiring its last Boeing 737.
As part of its plan to stay competitive in reaction to the entry of Southwest Airlines into Denver, the company underwent a reorganization early in 2006. On April 3, 2006, Frontier created Frontier Airlines Holdings, Inc. (FRNT), a holding company incorporated in Delaware to take advantage of favorable tax laws in that state. The corporate headquarters did not leave Colorado.[tpl]cite news |title=Frontier Airlines Fact Sheet |work=Frontier Airlines |accessdate=2006-11-01 |url=http://www.frontierairlines.com/frontier/who-we-are/company-info/fact-sheet.do;jsessionid=4d84da87d4b75a829dad1ef9f5[/tpl]
On January 11, 2007, Frontier Airlines announced it had signed an 11-year service agreement with Republic Airlines. Under the agreement, Republic was to operate 17, 76-seat Embraer 170 aircraft for the former Frontier JetExpress operations. At the time the contract was canceled in April 2008, Republic Airlines operated 11 aircraft for Frontier Airlines, with the remaining six aircraft expected to join the fleet by December 2008. With the integration of Republic aircraft, the 'JetExpress' denotation was removed. Subsequent to the cessation of Horizon's services for Frontier in December 2007, all flights operated by Republic were sold and marketed as "Frontier Airlines, operated by Republic Airlines." The first market created specifically for the Embraer 170 was Louisville, Kentucky, which began on April 1, 2007. Service to Louisville was suspended in August 2008 but restarted in April 2010.
On January 24, 2007, Frontier was designated as a major carrier by the United States Department of Transportation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://media.frontierairlines.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=4156 |title=Frontier Airlines Newsroom: Frontier Airlines Offers a Major Sale From a Major Airline! |publisher=Media.frontierairlines.com |accessdate=2012-05-17[/tpl]
Flights operated by Republic Airlines offered in-flight snack and beverage services similar to Frontier's mainline flights. Unlike Frontier's aircraft and due to the nature of contracting with regional carriers, these Embraer 170 aircraft were not fitted with LiveTV.

====Bankruptcy and acquisition by Republic====

On April 10, 2008, Frontier announced that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in reaction to the intent of its credit card processor, First Data, to withhold significant proceeds from ticket sales. First Data decided that it would withhold 100% of the carrier's proceeds from ticket sales beginning May 1.[tpl]cite news |last=Leavitt |first=Noelle |coauthors=McGaw, Renee |title=First Data offers regrets about Frontier Airlines |publisher=Denver Business Journal |date=2008-04-11 |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2008/04/07/daily72.html |accessdate=2008-04-10[/tpl] According to Frontier's press release, "This change in practice would have represented a material change to our cash forecasts and business plan. Unchecked, it would have put severe restraints on Frontier's liquidity..." Its operation continues uninterrupted, though, as Chapter 11 bankruptcy protects the corporation's assets and allows restructuring to ensure long-term viability.
After months of losses, Frontier Airlines reported that they made their first profit during the month of November 2008. Frontier Airlines reported $2.9 million in net income during the month of November.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/dec/29/frontier-stanches-losses-wth-november-profit/ |title=Frontier Reports First Profits in Chapter 11[/tpl]
On June 22, 2009, Frontier Airlines announced that pending bankruptcy court approval, Republic Airways Holdings, the Indianapolis based parent company of Republic Airlines, would acquire all assets of Frontier Airlines for the amount of $108 million. Thus, Frontier Airlines would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Republic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.republicair.com/pdf/F9.pdf |title=Republic Airways to Serve as Equity Sponsor for Frontier's Exit from Bankruptcy[/tpl]  However, 5 weeks later on July 30, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines announced that it would be making a competing bid of $113.6 million for Frontier with intentions to also operate Frontier as a wholly owned subsidiary, but that it would gradually fold Frontier resources into current Southwest operating assets.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.blogsouthwest.com/blog/southwest-bids-frontier-airlines |title=Southwest Bids for Frontier Airlines[/tpl]

====Merger with Midwest Airlines====

As Republic Airways Holdings was in the process of bidding to acquire Frontier in 2009, it was also in the process of acquiring Milwaukee-based Midwest Airlines.  Through the fall and winter of 2009, Republic operated its two new acquisitions as separate brands.  However, to improve efficiency by better matching aircraft capacity to route demand, Republic began to intermix the fleets of the two airlines, swapping a portion of its higher-capacity planes from Frontier with its smaller-capacity planes from Midwest and vice versa.  However, the move caused some confusion amongst the public, as the two brands did not offer the same amenities and did not match the amenities mentioned on the airfare.  As a result, in the Spring of 2010 it was announced that the Frontier and Midwest Airlines brands would merge.  On April 13, Republic announced that the Frontier Airlines name would be kept, and employees were issued new Frontier uniforms.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/90750954.html | title=New name for Midwest-Frontier airline: Frontier | work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel | first=Tom | last=Daykin | date=2010-04-13 | accessdate=2010-04-13[/tpl] This was a merger of brands only—no Midwest Airlines aircraft was ever operated by Frontier, as by this time, all Midwest Airlines flights were operated on its behalf by other Republic Airways Holdings subsidiaries.
On April 13, 2011, Frontier announced the formation of a new subsidiary, Frontier Express, that was planned to operate the airline's smaller aircraft with different services than those available on full-size aircraft.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/13/travel/main20053727.shtml | title=Frontier Airlines cuts fee for changing tickets | publisher=CBS News | date=April 13, 2011 | accessdate=April 19, 2011 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5y4jta3Jr | archivedate=April 18, 2011[/tpl]

===2010s===

====Closing Milwaukee Hub====

After merging with Midwest Airlines, Frontier announced it was cutting 11 out of its 18 flights leaving a total of just 7 from MKE to Denver, Orlando, Rhinelander and Washington-National.http://www.jsonline.com/business/frontier-to-cut-11-flights-from-milwaukee-furlough-125-worker… At its peak, Frontier operated around 50-80 flights from Milwaukee daily.
On September 9, 2011, Frontier notified the public of a 40% reduction of arriving and departing flights from MKE. Along with this reduction of flights, the company laid off approximately 140 employees from the MKE station. This includes but is not limited to: maintenance, grooming services, flight-line and gate.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.todaystmj4.com/news/local/129554838.html | title=Frontier Airlines layoffs | work=todaystmj4 | date=2011-09-09 | accessdate=2011-09-09[/tpl]
In February 2012, Frontier Airlines cut five nonstop routes from Milwaukee. This move "reduced Frontier's daily departing flights out of Mitchell International from 32 to 18," or 56%. Frontier announced further layoffs in conjunction with this route change: up to 446 Milwaukee-area employees were affected by the job cuts that occurred between April 15 and April 30, 2012.[tpl]cite journal|last=Daykin|first=Thomas|title=Frontier Airlines to cut about 450 Milwaukee-area employees|journal=Milwaukee Wisconsin Journal Sentinal|date=13 February 2012|url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/frontier-airlines-to-cut-500-milwaukeearea-employees-cv46bem-139239153.html|accessdate=14 April 2012[/tpl]

====Republic Airways spinoff of Frontier====

In an effort to focus on regional contract flights for major carriers, Republic Airways announced in January 2012 its intention to sell or spin off Frontier.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/travelers_check/archives/2011/11/does_frontier_have_a_future.html |title=Does Frontier Have a Future? |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=2011-11-08 |accessdate=2012-05-17[/tpl] On January 26, 2012, Republic Airways announced that it had appointed former US Airways and Gate Gourmet CEO David Siegel as President and CEO of Frontier Airlines. Republic also announced the addition of new senior officers for Frontier’s finance and commercial team, among other changes in the executive leadership team.

==Former Regional Carriers==

===Frontier Express===

Chautauqua Airlines operated up to 12 Embraer 135 and 145 jets out of Milwaukee. Frontier began branding these flights as Frontier Express in the spring of 2011.  With the pull-down of the Milwaukee hub, the only route that continued to operate with a Frontier Express ERJ-145 jet was Milwaukee to Rhinelander.  However, Frontier service to Rhinelander ended on January 3, 2013, and Chautauqua is transitioning the remaining aircraft to flying for other partners.

===Frontier JetExpress===

In February 2002, the airline launched its first regional product, Frontier JetExpress, initially operated by Mesa Airlines using CRJ-200 regional jets. Similar to "express" operations of other carriers, Frontier JetExpress is targeted for markets to and from Denver that do not generate traffic sufficient to support Frontier's smallest mainline jet, the Airbus A318, but can still offer lucrative business with a smaller jet. The operation's head office was in the Hughes Center in Clark County, Nevada.World Airline Directory. Flight International. March 23–29, 2004. 78.
The initial JetExpress partnership with Mesa ended in January 2004, when Horizon Air was selected to operate the routes. Horizon utilized slightly larger CRJ-700 aircraft on these routes. In August 2006, Frontier and Horizon announced that their partnership would end.Frontier JetExpress ends While Frontier was generally pleased with Horizon's operation, the carrier decided that it needed to revisit the agreement and find a provider with additional regional jets to grow the operation. The last of the CRJ-700's was returned to the Horizon Air fleet on November 30, 2007.

===Lynx Aviation===

===Livery===

Until 2013, Frontier Airlines livery consisted of an all-white fuselage with  "FRONTIER" titles on the sides of the aircraft, and the company's former slogan "A Whole Different Animal".

Retrieved on 2013-08-16. keeping the iconic animals on aircraft tails, but dropping its former slogan and replacing "FRONTIER" with "FLYFRONTIER.COM", the company's website, in support of new marketing that almost exclusively focuses on FlyFrontier.com. Aircraft in the old livery now feature "FLYFRONTIER.COM" titles on engine nacelles.
Animal concepts used in the livery extend into Frontier’s marketing as well. Each animal has a specific name.Frontier Airlines | Animal Tails. Flyfrontier.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.
