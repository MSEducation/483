[[Roughskin catshark]]

CATEGORIES: Apristurus, Animals described in 2008

The roughskin catshark, Apristurus ampliceps, is a species of fish in the Scyliorhinidae family found near Australia and New Zealand. Its natural habitat is open seas. This species belongs to a genus of poorly known deep-water catsharks. Very little is known of its biology. This species is known to occur in deep water (840 to 1,380 m) off New Zealand, sporadic sites around Tasmania, and a small area of Western Australia. Some concern exists for this species, as its distribution includes some heavily fished areas. Deep-water demersal trawl fisheries are expanding in the region, and assuming its biology is like other deep-water shark species, it may not be sufficiently fecund to withstand the exploitation pressure.
