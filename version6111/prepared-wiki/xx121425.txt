"Only Your Love" is a song recorded by English girl group Bananarama.  It was released as the first single from the group's fifth studio album Pop Life and was issued several months prior to the release of the album.  The Pop Life album marked a break for Bananarama from their long-standing relationship with the Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) production trio.  "Only Your Love" was co-written and produced by Youth.  The album version of the song was remixed for its single release.
The song's primary rhythm, complete with 'Woo Woo' hoots, directly references "Sympathy for the Devil". This led Jonathan Ross to jokingly thank 'The Rolling Stones' after Bananarama had performed the song on his TV show. The song also contains samples of "Loaded" by Primal Scream and "Fool's Gold" by The Stone Roses, two songs that had been recent pop and dance hits in the UK. Upon its release "Only Your Love" received positive critical reviews.  The song was not released as a single in the United States.
"Only Your Love" peaked at number twenty-seven in the UK singles chart, which the group considered to be a disappointment.  The single did not fare much better in other countries,  hitting number forty-nine in New Zealand and fifty-one in Australia.

==Music video==

The music video, directed by Philippe Gautier, which makes use of silhouettes against multicoloured backdrops, features the girls on a studio set made to look like a cross between a train and a jungle gym. They perform the song while dancing provocatively with various male dancers. The dancing features more physical contact between the girls and the male dancers than any of their other videos. The performance on the train is interspersed with shots of the girls singing on the front of the train engine in sunglasses and oversized dresses.
