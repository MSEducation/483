Phillip Anthony "Phil" Senior (born 30 October 1982 in Huddersfield, England) is an English footballer who currently plays as a goalkeeper for FC Halifax Town.

==Biography==

Senior made his first impact on the football scene at the age of 16 when Huddersfield manager Peter Jackson named him on the Town bench for a FA Cup tie against Wrexham in 1999.
Just after Town lost in the Football League One play-offs to Barnsley in May 2006, the manager, Peter Jackson decided not to renew his contract. Senior then signed for Northwich Victoria on a free transfer. He left at the end of the 2006-07 season to join Droylsden. By the end of 2007 he was playing for Alfreton Town, before joining neighbours Ilkeston Town in February 2008. He has since signed for F.C. Halifax Town in Northern Premier League Division One North where he has made a handful of appearances.
Senior now has a job as a Fitness Instructor at Total Fitness in Waterloo, Huddersfield, UK.
