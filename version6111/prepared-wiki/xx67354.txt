[[Platform Sutra]]

CATEGORIES: Mahayana sutras, Zen texts

The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch ([tpl]zh|c=六祖壇經|p=Liùzǔ Tánjīng[/tpl] or simply: [tpl]lang|zh|壇經[/tpl] Tánjīng) is a Chan Buddhist scripture that was composed in China during the 8th to 13th century.[tpl]sfn|Schlütter|2007|p=385[/tpl] The "platform" (施法壇) refers to the podium on which a Buddhist teacher speaks.
Its key theme are the direct perception of one's true nature, and the unity in essence of śīla (conduct), dhyāna (meditation) and prajñā (wisdom).
The text centers around teachings and stories ascribed to the sixth Chan patriarch Huineng. It contains the well-known story of the contest for the succession of Hongren (enlightenment by the non-abiding), and discourses and dialogues attributed to Huineng.
The text attributes its recollection to Fa-hai, but was probably written within the so-called Oxhead School, which existed along with the East Mountain School and Shenhui's Southern School. The text attempts to reconcile the so-called Northern School with its alleged gradual enlightenment teachings, and the so-called Southern School with its alleged sudden enlightenment teachings. In effect, the text incorporates the "rhetorical purity" which originated with Shenhui's attack on Shenxiu, while effectively "writing him out of the story".[tpl]sfn|McRae|2003|p=60-69[/tpl]

==History of the text==

The Platform Sutra underwent various redactions.[tpl]sfn|Schlütter|2007[/tpl] Though its recollection has been attributed to Fa-hai, a student of Huineng, its origins are not clear:
[tpl]quote|The early development of the Platform Sutra is shrouded in the mists of time, and we will probably never know much for certain about it. The Dunhuang version of the text, the earliest complete edition we have, is almost certainly a product of a long evolution with elements coming together from several different Chan groups with different agendas, as the uneven character of the text and its internal inconsistencies attest.[tpl]sfn|Schlütter|2007|p=386[/tpl][/tpl]
The Dunhuang versions are the oldest texts available, with the full title Southern School's Sudden Doctrine, Supreme Mahayana Great Perfection of Wisdom: The Platform Sutra as Delivered by the Sixth Patriarch Huineng at the Dafan Temple in Shao Prefecture [tpl]zh|c=南宗頓教最上大乘摩訶般若波羅蜜經：六祖惠能大師於韶州大梵寺施法壇經[/tpl], subtitled, “one roll, recorded by the spreader of the Dharma, the disciple Fahai, who at the same time received the Precepts of Formlessness” (一卷，兼受無相戒弘法弟子法海集記). 
Two copies dated to between 830 and 860 have been found in the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang. Both are thought to be based on an edition from about 780. The finds at Dunhuang have been very important for the historical understanding of Zen:
[tpl]quote|Scholarship on early Chan was transformed after the discovery in the beginning of the twentieth century of a number of texts relating to the early Chan movement in the cave library at Dunhuang, which also contained an early version of the Platform Sutra.[tpl]sfn|Schlütter|2007|p=383[/tpl][/tpl]
In 1056, the Chinese scholar-monk Qisong (契嵩, Wade-Giles: Ch'i-sung) produced a larger edition, entitled Liuzu fabao ji (法寶記 ‘Precious Record of the Dharma’).
In 1291, Zongbao (宗寶, Wade-Giles: Tsung-pao) produced the edition that became part of the Ming Dynasty Chinese Buddhist canon. This canonical version, apparently based on the Qisong edition, is about a third longer than the Mogao Caves version, and structured differently.

The Platform Sutra is:
[tpl]quote|...a wonderful melange of early Chan teachings, a virtual repository of the entire tradition up to the second half of the eighth century. At the heart of the sermon is the same understanding of the Buddha-nature that we have seen in texts attributed to Bodhidharma and Hongren, including the idea that the fundamental Buddha-nature is only made invisible to ordinary humans by their illusions".[tpl]sfn|McRae|2003|p=65-66[/tpl][/tpl]

===Chapter One - Personal History===

Chapter One contains the well-known story of the contest for the succession of Hongren. It is an essential part of the Traditional Zen Narrative.[tpl]sfn|Heine|2008|p=6[/tpl] According to the text, Huineng won this contest, but had to flee the monastery to avoid the rage of the supporters of Henxui. The story is not a factual account, but an 8th-century construction, probably by the so-called Oxhead School.
The contest centers on two verses:
Shenxiu: 
The body is the bodhi tree; 
The mind is like a bright mirror’s stand. 
Be always diligent in rubbing it— 
Do not let it attract any dust.
Huineng: 
Bodhi is fundamentally without any tree; 
The bright mirror is also not a stand. 
Fundamentally there is not a single thing— 
Where could any dust be attracted?[tpl]sfn|McRae|2008[/tpl]
[tpl]div col end[/tpl]}}
According to the traditional interpretation, which is based on Guifeng Zongmi, the fifth-generation successor of Shenhui, the two verses represent respectively the gradual and the sudden approach. According to McRae, this is an incorrect understanding: [tpl]quote|The verse attributed to Shenxiu does not in fact refer to gradual or progressive endeavor, but to a constant practice of cleaning the mirror ... His basic message was that of the constant and perfect teaching, the endless personal manifestation of the bodhisattva ideal.[tpl]sfn|McRae|2003|p=63-65[/tpl][/tpl]
Huineng's verse does not stand alone, but forms a pair with Shenxiu's verse:
[tpl]quote|Huineng's verse(s) apply the rhetoric of emptiness to undercut the substantiality of the terms of that formulation. However, the basic meaning of the first proposition still remains".[tpl]sfn|McRae|2003|p=65[/tpl][/tpl]
McRae notes a similarity in reasoning with the Oxhead School, which used a threefold structure of "absolute, relative and middle", or "thesis-antithesis-synthesis".[tpl]sfn|McRae|2003|p=60, 65[/tpl] According to McRae, the Platform Sutra itself is the synthesis in this threefold structure, giving a balance between the need of constant practice and the insight into the absolute.[tpl]sfn|McRae|2003|p=65[/tpl]

===Chapter Two - Prajna (Lecture)===

Chapter Two contains a lecture on prajna, given after a recitation of the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra. From this chapter: [tpl]quote|When our mind works freely without any hindrance, and is at liberty to "come" or to "go", we attain Samadhi of Prajna, or liberation.  Such a state is called the function of "thoughtlessness."  But to refrain from thinking of anything, so that all thoughts are suppressed, is to be Dharma-ridden, and this is an erroneous view.[/tpl]

===Chapter Three - Questions===

In Chapter Three Huineng answers questions from a lay audience. Huineng discusses the famous story of Bodhidharma telling Emperor Wu of Liang that his good deeds would bring him no merit. Next, he discusses the Pure Land of the West, asserting the greater importance of one's inner state compared to one's physical location. This leads to a conclusion in which Huineng asserts that lay practice outside of a monastery is preferable to following the forms of monastic renunciation without inner practice.

===Chapter Four - Meditation and Wisdom (Lecture)===

In Chapter Four, meditation and wisdom are said to be of the same essence:

===Chapter Five - Seated Meditation (Lecture)===

Chapter Five details the "pureness of our fundamental nature":[tpl]sfn|McRae|2008[/tpl]
[tpl]quote|In this teaching of seated meditation, one fundamentally does not concentrate on mind, nor does one concentrate on purity, nor is it motionlessness. If one is to concentrate on the mind, then the mind involved is fundamentally false. You should understand that the mind is like a phantasm, so nothing can concentrate on it. If one is to concentrate on purity, then that because our natures are fundamentally pure, it is through false thoughts that suchness is covered up. Just be without false thoughts and the nature is pure of itself. If you activate your mind to become attached to purity, you will only generate the falseness of purity. The false is without location; it is the concentration that is false. Purity is without shape and characteristics; you only create the characteristics of purity and say this is ‘effort’ meditation. To have such a view is to obscure one’s own fundamental nature, and only to be fettered by purity.[tpl]sfn|McRae|2008[/tpl][/tpl]

===Chapter Ten - Transmission===

In the chapter on his final instructions, Huineng instructs his accomplished disciples, giving specific instructions how to "preach the Dharma", which show the influence of the Buddhist teachings on the five skandhas, the concept of Namarupa, and the Yogacara-teachings:

==Scholarship and translations==

===Japanese scholarship===

In the 1920s, Japanese scholar Yabuki Keiki (矢吹慶輝 1879-1939) produced an edition based on one of the Mogao Caves texts (the only one known at the time), dividing the text into fifty-seven sections.
In 1934, D. T. Suzuki published an edition based on the Mogao Cave text, but incorporating corrections from the Tsungpao (Zongbao) edition.
In 1993, the Buddhist scholar Yang Zengwen (杨曾文, b. 1939, Shandong) published an annotated edition of the second Mogao Caves text (which has fewer errors than the first Mogao Caves text). (Pine, 2006, Introduction)

===Translations into English===

The first published translation into English was completed in 1930 by Wong Mou-lam (黃茂林 [tpl]circa|1886[/tpl]-1934) from Guangdong. It was based on the canonical Tsungpao edition, and published by the Yu Ching Press of Shanghai.[tpl]cite news |title=Foreword To New Edition |publisher=The State University of New York |date=1999-11-07 |url=http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/clubs/buddhism/huineng/foreword.html#forword |accessdate=2008-04-07[/tpl]
