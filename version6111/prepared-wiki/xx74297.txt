The Governor-General of the Union of South Africa was the representative of the British (1910–1931) and later South African Crown (1931–1961) in the Union of South Africa between 31 May 1910 and 31 May 1961. The Union of South Africa was a Commonwealth realm in which Queen Elizabeth II was given the title Queen of South Africa, although she never visited the country in that capacity.
Some of the first holders of the post were members of the British Royal Family including Prince Arthur of Connaught, between 1920 and 1924, and the Earl of Athlone, who served between 1924 and 1931, before becoming the Governor General of Canada. As in other Dominions, this would change, and from 1946 onward only local South African citizens held the office.
The office was established by the South Africa Act 1909.  Although he was nominally the country's chief executive, in practice he was bound by convention to act on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.

==Republicanism==

The Afrikaner-dominated National Party, which came to power in 1948, was avowedly republican, and regarded South Africa's links with the other Commonwealth realms as a relic of British imperialism.  The two Governors-General appointed after the party took power, Ernest George Jansen and Charles Robberts Swart, were retired National Party ministers who chose not to wear the traditional Windsor uniform or take the oath of allegiance to the Queen. 
In 1957, God Save the Queen ceased to have equal status with The Call of South Africa as a national anthem, and the Union Flag similarly ceased to have equal status with the South African flag. 
However, it was not until 1960 that Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd, advised Governor-General Swart to hold a referendum on the issue. After several protests regarding the lowering of the voting age to 18, and the inclusion of white voters in South West Africa, on 5 October 1960, South Africa's whites were asked: "Are you in favour of a Republic for the Union?" The result was 52 per cent in favour of the change.
Swart, the last Governor-General, asked the Queen to relieve him of his duties on 30 April 1961, after he signed the new republican constitution into law.  Chief Justice Lucas Cornelius Steyn become Officer Administering the Government under a transitional arrangement until 31 May 1961, when the Republic of South Africa was declared and Swart become the first State President of South Africa.
