[[Daduhe Road Station]]

CATEGORIES: Shanghai Metro stations

The Daduhe Road Station ([tpl]Zh|c = 大渡河路|p = Dàdùhé Lù Zhàn[/tpl]) is a future station on Line 13 of the Shanghai Metro.  It is located in Putuo District.
On December 30, Line 13 began providing service from Jinyun Road to the west to Jinshajiang Road to the east.[tpl]Citation|last = Zha|first = Minjie|title = Extension of Line 13 begins run tomorrow|date = 29 December 2012|url = http://www.shanghaidaily.com/nsp/Metro/2012/12/29/Extension%2Bof%2BLine%2B13%2Bbegins%2Brun%2Btomorrow/[/tpl]  However, this did not include the South Qilianshan Road or Daduhe Road stations.  Since then, the South Qilianshan Road station has opened, but the Daduhe Road station remains closed.
Although the station is fully constructed and ready for use, it cannot be used until Line 13 is extended beyond Jinshajiang Road.  This is because of the design of the rail lines through the station.  This station utilizes side platforms with three tracks running through the middle: one going towards Jinshajiang Road, one going towards Zhenbei Road, and a third used to store extra carriages. The centre track is presently being used by trains heading to Jinshajiang Road that are crossing over to the other track, as that station is the current terminus, and then return towards Jinyun Road using those tracks. This prevents trains from stopping on both sides of the station, therefore keeping it closed.
