[[Potometer]]

A potometer (from Greek ποτό = drunken, and μέτρο = measure) —sometimes known as a transpirometer— is a device used for measuring the rate of water uptake of a leafy shoot. The causes of water uptake are photosynthesis and transpiration.[tpl]cite book|title=Methods of Studying Plant Water Relations|first1= BohdanZ|last1= Slavík|first2= Margaret Susan[/tpl] Everything must be completely water tight so that no leakage of water occurs.
There are two main types of potometers used - the bubble potometer (as detailed below), and the mass potometer. The mass potometer consists of a plant with its root submerged in a beaker. This beaker is then placed on a digital balance; readings can be made to determine the amount of water lost by the plant. The mass potometer measures the water lost through transpiration of the plant and not the water taken up by the plant.
1) Indirectly - by measuring the distance the water level drops in the graduated tube over a measured length of time. It is assumed that this is due to the cutting taking in water which in turn is necessary to replace an equal volume of water lost by transpiration.
2) Directly - by measuring the reduction in mass of the potometer over a period of time. Here it is assumed that any loss in mass is due to transpiration.

Potometers come in a variety of designs, but all follow the same basic principle.
