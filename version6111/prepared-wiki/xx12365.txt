William College has had major updates or renovations of its
athletic facilities during the past several decades.
The Lansing Chapman hockey rink, built in 1953 and originally
uncovered, was canopied in 1963, enclosed in 1969 and has been periodically
upgraded to the present (2014) with rink, roof, locker room and lighting
improvements.
The Town Field House, constructed in 1970, is a multipurpose
facility, which includes an indoor track, tennis courts and a climbing wall.
The later was initially constructed in 1974 and updated to a state of the art
climbing wall wall in 1995. The field house also accommodates pre-season baseball, softball
and lacrosse.
The Lasell Gym built in 1886 was renovated and expanded with
the addition of the Chandler Athletic Center in the 1987. It provides a state
of the art 50-meter swimming pool, a gymnasium primarily for basketball, squash
facilities, wrestling rooms, various fitness centers and administrative offices.
In 1987 the Weston Field cinder running track and baseball field were
replaced: the Anthony Plansky 400-meter track was built around the refurbished
football field and the Bobby Coombs baseball field was re-located at Cole
Field. The Renzi Lamb Field for lacrosse and field hockey, built with
artificial turf, was added to Weston Field in 2004.
In November 2013 Williams College began its 22 million dollar renovation of
the Weston Field complex. This upgrade includes an artificial turf football
field, relocation of the Plansky Track and Lamb Field, new bleachers, improved
lighting and the addition of support buildings for the athletes. The completed
facility, scheduled to reopen in September 2014, will allow year round athletic
events and practice.Properties | Williams College Facilities. Facilities.williams.edu. Retrieved on 2014-04-12.
