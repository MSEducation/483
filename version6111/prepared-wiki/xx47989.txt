Does This Look Infected? is the second studio album by Sum 41. It was released on November 26, 2002 on Island Records. Even though there is relatively little profanity on the album, it is the only Sum 41 album with a parental advisory sticker on it. Both an explicit version and a clean version were released.

==Background and release==

The unedited version includes a bonus DVD which is entitled Cross The T's and Gouge Your I's. The DVD has footage of Sum 41's alter ego band, Pain for Pleasure, titled "Reign In Pain", as well as various humorous segments like "Going Going Gonorrhea", "Campus Invasion", and "Pizza Heist and Other Crap". Also included in the DVD are the Pain for Pleasure tracks "Reign In Pain" and "WWVII Parts 1 & 2", the Autopilot Off songs "Long Way to Fall" and "Nothing Frequency", the No Warning songs "Short Fuse" and "Ill Blood", and some weblinks.
The song "My Direction" lifts the chorus melody from The Rancid song "Let Me Go" from their self-titled album from 2000.http://www.punknews.org/review/1479
Deryck Whibley stated on the band's DVD Sake Bombs And Happy Endings that the song "A.N.I.C." is a special "love song" dedicated to Anna Nicole Smith. According to him, A.N.I.C. stands for "Anna Nicole is a Cunt." The band stopped including the song in their live performances after Smith died of an overdose in 2007.http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3536 However, they put "A.N.I.C" back to their setlist during the 2012 summer European leg of the Screaming Bloody Murder Tour.

==Cover and title==

The cover for Does This Look Infected? features drummer Steve Jocz dressed up as a zombie. It was chosen months before the title was. The album was almost delayed by the label because the band members did not have a name for it on time. Deryck suddenly thought of the name Does This Look Infected?; the whole band laughed at the idea and chose it as their album title.
The same thing is also used on the band's EP Does This Look Infected Too?, except Jocz was replaced with Deryck. He was dressed as a zombie as well.

==Critical reception==

Does This Look Infected? has received positive reviews from music critics. On Metacritic, the album has a 75 out of 100. E! Online said that it "has a clutch of songs that mix chord-y abandon with raging rock riffs--and a heck of a lot of good times." Blender also gave it a positive review, saying "So Sum 41 have grown up... a little.... It's all relative, and, crucially, it still rocks." The album has been acclaimed by the fanbase, and has been considered a fan favorite.

==Commercial performance==

The album gained commercial success, with singles "The Hell Song" and "Still Waiting" mainly gaining success on the modern rock charts. The album sold over 4.5 million copies, but the album didn't gain quite as much success as the band's previous album "All Killer, No Filler".
