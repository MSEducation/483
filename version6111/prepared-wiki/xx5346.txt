Jerome Callet is the most well-known teacher of the "Tongue Controlled Embouchure" method for brass instruments.
He is the author of a book titled "'Trumpet Secrets', the Tongue Controlled Embouchure (TCE)".
The method is all about a focused tone, perfect pitch, high notes and endurance. It is a rediscovered method of a technique which the clarino blaser were using in the 17th and 18th centuries. "Trumpet Secrets" is seen by Mr. Callet as a progression from his earlier books, "Trumpet Yoga"[tpl]cite book |title=Das grosse Buch der Trompete: Instrument, Geschichte, Trompeterlexikon |last=Keim |first=Friedel |page=157 |year=2005 |publisher=Schott |isbn=978-3-7957-0530-5 [/tpl] and "Super Chops"
Jerry recently invented the "last word" in trumpet mouthpieces...the Superchops 3, which is more improved from the others, Superchops 1 and Superchops 2.
