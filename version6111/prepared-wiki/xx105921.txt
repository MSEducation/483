Usk is a hamlet in British Columbia, Canada just off Highway 16 north-east of Terrace on the north bank of the Skeena River. Once famous for berry-growing, a flood in the 1930s destroyed most of the community. A few people still live there now. Access is by the Usk Ferry, a reaction ferry, or passenger-only cablecar when the river is iced over. The Usk railway station is served by Via Rails Jasper â€“ Prince Rupert train.
Between Usk and Kitselas, further upstream, is Kitselas Canyon.
