Branko Ivanković ([tpl]IPA-sh|ˈbraːŋkɔ ˈiʋaːŋkoʋitɕ|pron[/tpl]; born 28 February 1954) is a Croatian football manager and former player. After a 12-year playing career at Varteks Varaždin, Ivanković started his coaching career at the same club in 1991. He led the Iranian national football team at the 2006 World Cup.

==Playing career==

Ivanković spent his entire 12-season-long playing career at Varteks Varaždin, appearing in a total of 263 matches[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.index.hr/sport/clanak/ivankovic-za-index-spreman-sam-radim-taj-posao-12-godina/322263.aspx|title=Ivanković za Index: Spreman sam, radim taj posao 12 godina|work=Index.hr|date=16 July 2006|language=Croatian|accessdate=13 September 2011[/tpl] and scoring 31 goals. He then continued to work at the club by first being their secretary and then starting his coaching career.

==Managing career==

He was the head coach of Varteks Varaždin between 1991 and 1995. He then moved for one season to Segesta Sisak, and went on to coach Rijeka in the 1996–97 season.

===Croatian national team===

Ivanković then became the assistant coach to Ćiro Blažević, who led the Croatian national team to a sensational third-place finish at the 1998 FIFA World Cup finals in France.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/report_iran-s-former-football-coach-branko-ivankovic-takes-over-at-shandong_1324624|title=Iran's former football coach Branko Ivankovic takes over at Shandong|date=17 December 2009|work=Daily News and Analysis|agency=Reuters|accessdate=6 September 2011[/tpl]
In the 1999–2000 season, he coached German club Hannover 96, which was playing in the Second Bundesliga at the time. He briefly returned to the Croatian national team as the assistant to Mirko Jozić during the qualifications for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, before he took over the Iranian national team where he replaced Blažević, who had managed them since 2001.

===Iranian national team===

Ivanković was appointed to the head of the Iranian team on 29 January 2002.
Under Ivanković, Iran's U23 football team won the 2002 Asian Games in Pusan.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.index.hr/sport/clanak/ivankovic-ponovno-izbornik-irana/162120.aspx | language = Croatian | title = Ivanković ponovno izbornik Irana | publisher = Index.hr | date = 2003-10-01 | accessdate = 2011-09-13[/tpl] He remained the coach of the national team until the end of 2002, when he was replaced by Homayun Shahrokhi.
Ivanković had become very popular in Iran and the public media demanded a contract renewal, but the Football Federation was initially reluctant to appoint him as the head coach. Finally after a period of negotiations he was reappointed as the head coach of Iran on 3 October 2003.
Ivankovic led Iran to 2004 AFC Asian Cup third place.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/worldcup2006/groups/teams/iran.html | title = Iran - Group D | publisher = CBC.ca | work = World Cup 2006 | accessdate = 2011-09-13[/tpl] They lost only to the hosts, China, in penalties in a very controversial match in which the Chinese luckily avoided multiple red cards.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
Ivanković also led Iran to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, the third time in the country's history (they had previously been eliminated in the first round in 1978 and 1998).
Despite him being the most successful coach of the Iranian National Team in terms of winning percentage, Ivankovic was not liked by the Iranian government who deliberately tried to replace him with a native coach.
The Ministry for Physical Education which is a governmental watchdog on sports, tried to replace the coach before the World cup in Germany, however the Iranian Football Federation resisted the pressure and kept Ivankovic for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

====World Cup 2006====

Iran, at their opening game at the World Cup, showed a scintillating first half performance against Mexico, but conceded two goals. The second match against Portugal was not successful either, with Iran conceding two late goals to lose 2–0 and being left without any chances of advancing to the second stage of the tournament, as Mexico drew against Angola on the previous evening and left Iran unreachable four points behind. So, the third group match against Angola became insignificant for Iran. Angola put themselves into the lead with the opening goal after one hour of playing. The Iranians managed to equalise fifteen minutes later, eventually scoring their only point at the 2006 World Cup since the match ended in a 1–1 draw. This point was, however, only enough for Iran to occupy the last place in their group.
After the World Cup, MPE removed the Head of the Football federation of Iran, replacing Branko Ivanković with Amir Qalenoei.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20060718/sport/iran-replace-ivankovic-with-league-winner.47296 | title = Iran replace Ivankovic with league winner | agency = Reuters | newspaper = The Times (Malta) | date = 2006-06-18 | accessdate = 2011-09-13[/tpl] This in turn resulted a FIFA suspension for Iran's football due to political interference.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/administration/news/newsid=107889.html | title = FIFA suspends Iran Football Federation | date = 2006-11-23 | publisher = FIFA.com | accessdate = 2011-09-13[/tpl]

===Dinamo Zagreb===

On 6 November 2006, Ivanković replaced Josip Kuže as the head coach of Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb. He led the club to the Double in 2007 without losing a single competitive match. On 14 January 2008, Branko resigned as a coach of Dinamo mostly due to his differences with the club's executive vice-president Zdravko Mamić.http://www.24sata.hr/nogomet/zdravko-mamic-izvrijeao-i-otjerao-branka-ivankovica-90349

===Shandong Luneng===

On 17 December 2009, Ivanković was appointed as the new head coach of Chinese giant Shandong Luneng. In his first season, he led the team to the 2010 Chinese Super League winners with a record 63 points. The team secured the qualification for 2011 AFC Champions League. But Shandong were eliminated in the first round with 7 points. Due to poor result in the Champions League, he was dismissed on 10 May 2011 seven days before crucial game with Cerezo Osaka 0–4.

At the time of his dismissal, Al Wahda was ranked at the 7th place after a run of good results in the starting season.
