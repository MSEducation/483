The 2010 Varsity Cup was the third edition of this annual domestic cup competition and was contested from 1 February to 29 March 2010. The tournament (also known as the "FNB Varsity Cup" for sponsorship reasons) is an inter-university competition, featuring eight South African universities.

==Competition Rules==

There were eight participating universities in the 2010 Varsity Cup. These teams played each other once over the course of the season, either home or away.
Teams received four points for a win and two points for a draw. Bonus points were awarded to teams that scored four or more tries in a game, as well as to teams that lost a match by seven points or less. Teams were ranked by log points, then points difference (points scored less points conceded).
The top four teams qualified for the Title Play-Offs. In the Semi-Finals, the team that finished first had home advantage against the team that finished fourth, while the team that finished second had home advantage against the team that finished third. The winners of these semi-finals will play each other in the final, at the home venue of the higher-placed team.
