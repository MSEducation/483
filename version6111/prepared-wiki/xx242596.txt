==Plot==

Fourteen-year-old Ichigo Amano is clumsy and doesn't have any talent except for eating sweets (specifically cakes). When she stumbles upon a Sweets Festival, she meets Henri-sensei who acknowledges her ability of taste and invites her to transfer to St. Marie Academy to become a pâtissière. Ichigo has trouble adjusting initially, but with the help of the 3 Sweets Princes (Makoto Kashino, Satsuki Hanabusa, and Sennosuke Andou) and the Sweets Spirits (Vanilla, Chocolate, Caramel, and Cafe), she gains the confidence and skill to work towards becoming a pâtissière.
Two years after studying in Paris, the sixteen-year-old Ichigo now returns to Japan as a professional pâtissière. As soon as she returns, Ichigo finds Team Ichigo breaking up. The Sweets Princes, Hanabusa and Andou, take long absences from school to work for their dreams, leaving only Ichigo and Kashino. Kashino skipped a grade due to having top grades back at Paris. Soon a "new" Team Ichigo is formed by Henri-sensei for the project. The team includes Lemon Yamagishi, Johnny McBeal, Makoto Kashino, and Amano Ichigo. They are now working as professionals for the project and their dreams.

==Reception==

Carlo Santos of Anime News Network calls the anime "a baking-themed series so rife with clichés that it's hard to tell where the plagiarism stops and the actual show begins."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2009-10-01/carlo|title=Carlo Santos - The Fall 2009 Anime Preview Guide|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2009-10-02|accessdate=2010-01-14[/tpl] Other reviewers on the same site had slightly better opinions of the series though. Carl Kimlinger calls it "pure shōjo fluff" and says that it is a "sugary little distraction that won't harm any sensibilities."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2009-10-01/carl|title=Carl Kimlinger - The Fall 2009 Anime Preview Guide|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2009-10-01|accessdate=2010-01-14[/tpl] Theron Martin suggests either eating before or during viewing as the series is "undoubtedly one of the tastiest-looking series to come along in quite some time." Martin critiqued the art of the series however, saying "The dessert designs are unquestionably the visual highlight, as otherwise the artistry and technical merits are rather bland."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2009-10-01/theron|title=Theron Martin - The Fall 2009 Anime Preview Guide|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2009-10-01|accessdate=2010-01-14[/tpl] Summer Mullins also notes that the sweets are the best part of the animation, saying, "those detailed shots the sweets highlight the fact that some of the animation is only so-so". As of May 11, 2010 Crunchyroll's website listed Yumeiro Patissiere with an overall ranking of 4.8 out of 5 stars, with a total of 1761 votes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/library/Yumeiro_Patissiere|title=Crunchyroll - Official Home - Yumeiro Patissiere - Videos, Reviews, Photos, Forums|publisher=Crunchyroll|accessdate=2010-05-11[/tpl]
