[[People's Charter for Change, Peace and Progress]]

CATEGORIES: Fijian law, Politics of Fiji

The People's Charter for Change, Peace and Progress (initially, People's Charter for Change and Progress) is a proposed legal document which would complement the Constitution of the Republic of the Fiji Islands. It would establish compulsory guidelines for any government policy in Fiji over the coming years. The People's Charter is due to be completed and come into force prior to the scheduled 2014 general election.
A draft version of the Charter was released to the public in early August 2008. Input from the public will be received in August and September. Council member Filimoni Kau has stated that objections will be considered, but that the Charter will go ahead in any case.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=41230 |title=Fiji’s Council for Building a Better Fiji close to release of draft charter |date=July 31, 2008 |work=Radio New Zealand International |accessdate=November 2, 2011[/tpl]

==Context==

The People's Charter is the brainchild of current interim Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, head of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, who overthrew the elected Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase in December 2006. Bainimarama alleged that Qarase was corrupt and racist, and declared that a People's Charter was necessary in order to prevent corruption and racism within future elected governments.

==Content and aims of the Charter==

===Stated objective===

In April 2007, a draft version of the Charter was published."Building a Better Fiji for All through a People's Charter for Change and Progress", Fiji government website, April 2007 The draft, intended as a general presentation of the future Charter's aims, began with a statement that "Fiji’s politics and overall governance have been dominated by and deeply mired in divisive, race-based politics, policies, and institutions". Consequently, the text authors state, "Fiji needs to become a more progressive and a truly democratic nation; a country in which its leaders, at all levels, emphasize national unity, racial harmony and the social and economic advancement of all communities regardless of race or ethnic origin." 
The overall objective of the Charter is defined as follows:
Much emphasis is laid on the necessity to prioritise national unity over the politics of separate ethnic communities.
In August 2008, shortly before the Charter was due to be released to the public, it was announced that it recommended a change in the name of Fiji's citizens. If the proposal were adopted, all citizens of Fiji, whatever their ethnicity, would be called "Fijians". At present, the word "Fijian" does not denote a nationality, and refers exclusively to indigenous Fijians. Citizens of Fiji are referred to as "Fiji Islanders". The proposal would change the English name of indigenous Fijians from "Fijians" to itaukei, the Fijian word for indigenous Fijians."Charter proposes common Fijian name", August 4, 2008
Archbishop Petero Mataca summed up the Charter by saying it would "reinforce the quality and sustainability of democracy in Fiji" and "provide a clearer vision of the principles and values we want to live by"."'Charter will not replace Fiji Constitution'", FijiLive, January 16, 2008

===Short-term consequences===

Commodore Bainimarama has said that the People's Charter will prevent any candidate for the 2009 general election from campaigning on racist and divisive policies. Such candidates would be barred from taking part in the election.
Asked by a journalist whether Qarase would be allowed to take part in the election, Bainimarama said he would: "That is also in the commitment we had yesterday and that was sic always been there".see reference note 2
In May 2008, Bainimarama added that the military would enforce future governments' compliance with the provisions of the Charter."Agree With Charter Or No Elections", FijiVillage, May 22, 2008

===Methodology===

The Charter is to be prepared by a National Council for Building a Better Fiji (NCBBF), supposed to be "broadly representative of Fiji society (including leaders and representatives from the civil society including NGOs, the private sector, religious and community organisations, employers/workers and youth organisations, and the political parties)".
The NCBBF held its first meeting on January 16, 2008. It reportedly began with an "in depth" assessment of the state of the nation.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=37306 |title=Membership for National Council for Building a Better Fiji grows |date=January 4, 2008 |work=Radio New Zealand International |accessdate=November 2, 2011[/tpl]"Fiji council members revealed", Fiji Live, 16 January 2008"'Charter will not replace Fiji Constitution'", Fiji Live, 17 January 2008"PM explains where Fiji went wrong", Fiji Live, 16 January 2008"Fiji’s National Council members", Fiji Broadcasting Corporation Ltd, 16 January 2008
Officially, the NCBBF's work on the Charter is overseen by an independent monitoring group, which reports directly to President Ratu Josefa Iloilo. The monitoring group is chaired by Sela Molisa, a member of the Parliament of Vanuatu. Reverend Amy Chambers is also a member of the monitoring group."Vanuatu MP to monitor charter", Fiji Times, June 12, 2008 The NCBBF itself is composed of three task teams, one (co-chaired by Ratu Josefa Serulagilagi and Attorney General Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum) tasked with focusing on good governance, another (co-chaired by Ratu Josateki Nawalowalo and Finance Minister Mahendra Chaudhry) on economic growth, and the third (co-chaired by Lorrine Tevi and Health Minister Dr. Jiko Luveni) on "social cultural identity and nation building.""Flawed democracy", Fiji Labour Party website, July 23, 2008
On June 24, 2008, the NCBBF made several recommendations, all of them in line with Bainimarama's original aims. These included:
The NCBBF advocated implementing electoral reforms before holding any election. A representative of the Council stated: "The NCBBF is of the firm view that change is long overdue and that Fiji urgently needs a new electoral system based on equal suffrage - that is one person, one vote, equal value.""No Fiji vote 'before electoral reform'", AAP, June 24, 2008
On August 5, 2008, the NCBBF announced that it had endorsed a draft Charter document, which was to be released shortly thereafter. Fijilive reported that the NCBBF planned to "gauge the views of the people on the draft Charter via a public awareness campaign over the next six weeks". Meetings would be held in public venues, the Charter would be advertised in the media, and there would be "consultations by public relations teams at grassroots level in all the villages and settlements throughout the country"."NCBBF endorses draft Peoples’ Charter", Fijilive, August 5, 2008

====Implementation====

It remains unclear how the People's Charter will be officially implemented. The interim government has announced that the public will be consulted, but no official reference to a referendum has been made. Legally, if the Charter is deemed to alter the Constitution, it could only be adopted by a two-thirds majority of elected members of Parliament. Parliament is currently not in session, having been dismissed after the coup."Charter will end ethnic dominance", Sydney Morning Herald, August 7, 2008 Deposed Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, who opposes the Charter, has, however, stated that a referendum would constitute legal validation."Qarase: Let people decide", Fiji Times, August 8, 2008

===Content===

The People's Charter was released to the public on August 6, 2008. Among its key proposals were the following:"People’s Charter Insight", Fiji Daily Post, August 7, 2008
In addition, specific proposals aimed at promoting national unity and reducing inter-ethnic divisiveness:"Charter proposes common name", Fiji Times, August 7, 2008

==Criticism and support==

===Prior to publication===

The proposed Charter received strong support from the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Fiji, Archbishop Petero Mataca, who became co-chair (with Commodore Bainimarama) of the National Council for Building a Better Fiji. However, others were more cautious, noncommittal or openly critical. Fiji Women's Crisis Centre coordinator Shamima Ali declined to comment. Fiji's Citizens Constitutional Forum continued to oppose the military coup, calling it unjustifiable, but in response to the proposed Charter, said there is "a serious need to re-look at problems to find solutions to move the country forward"."Launch of the National Council for Building a Better Fiji", Citizens Constitutional Forum, October 10, 2007
The National Federation Party and the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua Party both opposed the idea of a People's Charter implemented by an unelected government."People's Charter for Change and Progress launched", Losalini Dulakiverata, 11 October 2007 Fiji’s Methodist Church, to which a majority of indigenous Fijians belong, also opposed the Charter,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=32986 |title=Fiji Methodists push for return to democracy |date=June 14, 2007 |work=Radio New Zealand International |accessdate=November 2, 2011[/tpl] stating that it had been instructed by God to do so.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=33050 |title=Fiji’s Methodist Church says its mandated by God to speak out against interim govt |date=June 18, 2007 |work=Radio New Zealand International |accessdate=November 2, 2011[/tpl] The Fiji Labour Party supported it."Labour supports reforms to the electoral system", Labour Party website, July 23, 2008 The Fiji Council of Churches offered cautious support, urging people not to oppose it outright, and suggesting that it provided "a window of opportunity for the nation to move forward".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=36005 |title=Fiji paramount chief critical of bishop over his role in People’s Charter |date=October 25, 2007 |work=Radio New Zealand International |accessdate=November 2, 2011[/tpl]
Samisoni Pareti of the magazine Islands Business expressed doubt as to whether elections could be held as promised in early 2009 if the interim government insisted on having the People's Charter in place before the election. In Pereti's view, the Charter would not be completed in time, and Bainimarama might have to choose between postponing the election (and thus sparking the ire of the international community) or abandoning his People's Charter."Polls to be Deferred? Either that or the People's Charter an exercise in futility", Samisoni Pareti, Islands Business Pareti's prediction turned out to be accurate: the election was postponed."No Elections in Fiji in 2009 says Bainimarama", Fiji Broadcasting Corporation, July 18, 2008
By contrast, New Zealander human rights activist Thakur Ranjit Singh expressed public support for the People's Charter, stating that fresh elections alone would not address the "fundamental problems in Fiji", such as "the agenda of the nationalists who want Fiji for Fijians and Fiji as a Christian state" or a "culture of corruption, nepotism and cronyism"; the People's Charter must therefore, in Singh's view, be implemented before any election takes place.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/democracy/news/article.cfm?c_id=171&objectid=10449640 |title=Thakur Ranjit Singh: Why Fiji needs our help |date=July 5, 2007 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=November 2, 2011[/tpl]
The responses of Indo-Fijian cultural and religious organisations were mixed. The Hindu organisations Arya Pratinidhi Sabha and Sanatan Dharam Pratinidhi Sabha supported the process and agreed to take part in the NCBBF. By contrast, Sangam, an organisation representing South Indians, refused to do so, as did the Fiji Muslim League, describing itself as non-political. On an individual basis, prominent Indo-Fijians such as Shamima Ali, Brij Lal, Imrana Jalal, Wadan Narsey and Richard Naidu refused to support the Charter."One hand clapping: Reflections on the first anniversary of Fiji’s 2006 coup", Brij V.

In March 2008, an editorial in the Fiji Daily Post commented that "a one-sided ‘People’s Charter’ for Fiji may not have the ameliorative effect its enforcers hope for. To truly succeed, the charter, like the nation, must proceed by bipartisan agreements, by consultative dialogue that brings victors and vanquished to the table of compromise so that a just settlement is achieved".Fiji Daily Post editorial, March 18, 2008, quoted in "One hand clapping: Reflections on the first anniversary of Fiji’s 2006 coup", Brij V. Lal, in Jon Fraenkel, Stewart Firth and Brij V. Lal (eds.), The 2006 Military Takeover in Fiji: A Coup to End All Coups?, op.cit.
The Pacific Islands Forum supported the proposed Charter."Forum recognizes People’s Charter: Fiji’s PM", Radio Fiji, 20 October 2007
In April 2008, a Fiji Times opinion poll found that public opinion was evenly split, with 46.2% disagreeing with the idea of the Charter, and 45.8% supporting it."Majority say no to Charter, but 'ayes' close behind", Fiji Times, April 15, 2008 The poll was taken in the context of a public debate over the Charter, during which it was supported by Joseva Serulagilagi (Chairman of the Tailevu Provincial Council),  
Lorine Tevi (President of the Fiji Council of Social Services),  and Pundit Kamlesh Arya (President of the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha of Fiji), and opposed by Wadan Narsey (Professor of Economics at the University of the South Pacific),  Richard Naidu (Senior Partner at the Munro Leys law firm) and Tupou Draunidalo (Former Vice-President of the Fiji Law Society)."The People's Charter for Change, Peace & Prosperity is good for Fiji - Media Council Forum Debate", Fiji Times

===After publication===

The People's Charter was released to the public on August 6, 2008. Deposed Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase was critical of its content. He dismissed as "unreasonable" its proposal to dissolve political parties which "engage in activities that breach important values of the Constitution". Qarase also opposed the proposed change in the country's demonym, which would enable all citizens of Fiji to refer to themselves as "Fijians": "That term Fijian is embedded into the indigenous population. It is a very sensitive issue and it will be opposed very strongly.""Charter won't end coups: Ousted PM", FijiLive, August 7, 2008 Qarase stated that the Charter made a number of good suggestions, but that it would, on the whole, increase inter-ethnic tensions. He stated that "some of the key proposals in the charter, if implemented without the approval of an elected parliament, would be contrary to the provisions of the 1997 Constitution.""People's Charter 'will divide Fiji'", Fiji Daily Post, August 8, 2008 He called upon the Charter to be voted on by an elected Parliament, and, alternately, suggested a referendum to decide the issue. He added:
Ousted Opposition leader Mick Beddoes also expressed his opposition to the Charter. The Fiji Labour Party, whose leader Mahendra Chaudhry is a member of the interim government, officially supported the Charter.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=41355 |title=Fiji Labour Party backs People’s Charter |date=August 8, 2008 |work=Radio New Zealand International |accessdate=November 2, 2011[/tpl]
Academic Brij Lal, one of the authors of the Constitution, described the Charter as "too prescriptive", commenting that it appeared to aim at creating an unfeasible utopia. He added: "I think that for the charter and some of the recommendations to have credibility, they have to be endorsed through parliament."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=41366 |title=Fiji charter too descripitive, says academic |date=August 8, 2008 |work=Radio New Zealand International |accessdate=November 2, 2011[/tpl]
The Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma has confirmed its opposition to the Charter, both because it originates from a government that came to power by force (despite the Church having openly supported the coups of 1987 and 2000"Tribal chiefs critical of coup", Sydney Morning Herald, December 7, 2006), and because the Church deems it to be an "an illegal, dangerous document that, if followed, will have a negative impact on the lives of Fiji citizens"."Fiji church maintains stance against People's Charter", August 27, 2008 Following a Church conference, Church general secretary Reverend Tuikilakila Waqairatu told the media:
The National Federation Party has called upon citizens to boycott the charter consultation process, claiming that the Charter would disadvantage Indo-Fijians. Referring to the proposed abolition of the communal voting system, to be replaced by a "one man, one vote" electoral process, party secretary Pramod Rae stated:
Ousted Vice-President and lawyer Joni Madraiwiwi has sought to take a balanced and cautionary view:
Jone Dakuvula, of the Citizens' Constitutional Forum, has commented favourably on the Charter:
Bainimarama has attacked some of his critics, labelling their objections self-serving:
In October 2008, the Fijian Teachers Association objected to a proposal for the Charter to be presented to children at school, describing the idea as "propaganda"."Fiji educators object to teaching People's Charter", Australia Broadcasting Corporation, October 16, 2008
