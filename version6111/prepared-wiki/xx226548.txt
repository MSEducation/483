Peter de Valognes was a Norman noble claimed by late sources to have accompanied William the Conqueror on the invasion of England, fought at the Battle of Hastings, and became great landowner in England.

==Land holdings==

Between 1070 and 1076 Peter de Valognes was granted lands in  the six counties of Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Lincolnshire. In 1086 when the Domesday book was completed, Peter was sheriff of the counties of Essex and Hertfordshire and he farmed the boroughs of Havering and Hertford. Although Peter de Valognes made  his caput  in Benington in Hertfordshire, his most valuable lands were in Norfolk, the latter being a later grant at the forfeiture of Ralph de Guader after the revolt of the Earls in 1075.
