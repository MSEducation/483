==Mission==

==History==

The site was conceived from an idea between Chris Bergin and three NASA and United Space Alliance managers, who wanted to see a news media site cover space flight (specifically Shuttle, VSE and NASA) from an engineering standpoint, concentrating on breaking news and documentation that involved the communication between the engineers and managers and the general public who were interested.
The website went online in the summer of 2005, just before the first "Return to Flight" Space Shuttle mission (STS-114) following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.
NASASpaceFlight.com now has a team of 20 writers and web developers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
