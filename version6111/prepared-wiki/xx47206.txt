A "gamer" is someone who plays video games or board games. [tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] The term nominally includes those who do not necessarily consider themselves to be gamers (i.e., casual gamers),[tpl]cite web | last =Cifaldi | first = Frank | coauthors =Jill Duffy, Brandon Sheffield | title =Gamers On Trial: The ECA's Hal Halpin on Consumer Advocacy | publisher =Gamasutra |date=2006-10-25 | url =http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1796/gamers_on_trial_the_ecas_hal_.php | accessdate =2007-12-03  [/tpl] as well as those who spend a notable part of their leisure time playing or learning about games.
There are many gamer communities around the world. Many of these take the form of discussion forums and other virtual communities, as well as college or university social clubs. Stores specializing in games often serve as a meeting place to organize groups of players [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl] Prior to the emergence of the Internet, many play-by-mail games developed communities resembling those surrounding today's online games.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl]

==Types of gamers==

In the United States, the average video game player is 30 and has been playing video games for over 12 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/facts/index.asp |title=The Entertainment Software Association - Industry Facts |publisher=Theesa.com |accessdate=2010-07-16[/tpl] In the UK as of 2007, the average video game player was over 23 years old, had played video games for over 10 years, and spent around 11 hours a week playing video games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://askaboutgames.com/?c=/pages/factsFigures.jsp |title=Facts and Figures |publisher=Askaboutgames |accessdate=2010-07-16|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070613033013/http://www.askaboutgames.com/?c=/pages/factsFigures.jsp|archivedate=13 Jun 2007[/tpl] The term "gamer" comprises several subgroups.

===Casual gamer===

A casual gamer is a player whose time or interest in playing games is limited. Casual gamers may play games designed for ease of gameplay, or play more involved games in small groupings of time, at a slower pace than hardcore gamers.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/10699-In-Defense-of-the-Casual-Gamer | title=In Defense of the Casual Gamer | publisher=Escapist magazine | date=30 October 2013 | accessdate=9 March 2014 | author=Heather Barefoot[/tpl]  The genres that casual gamers play vary, and they might not own a specific video game console to play their games.Magrino, Tom, GameStop: Casual gamers spurring hardcore holiday sales, GameSpot, Sep 11, 2007, Accessed 3 May 2008Boyes, Emma, GDC '08: Are casual games the future?, GameSpot, Feb 18, 2008, Accessed May 3, 2008
Casual gamer demographics vary greatly from those of other video gamers, as the typical casual gamer is older and more predominantly female.
One casual gamer subset is the "fitness gamer", who plays motion-based exercise games.[tpl]cite web|url = http://playstationlifestyle.net/2010/04/19/plethora-of-fitness-titles-lined-up-for-playstation-move/|title=Plethora of Fitness Titles Lined Up For PlayStation Move#|work=PlayStation LifeStyle|date=2010-04-19|accessdate=2010-04-22[/tpl]
The term casual gamer can be used to distinguish between play styles of level-based character advance in nonlinear games with respect to the amount of dedicated hours of play. MMORPGs may require many hours of grinding to develop a character to maximum level and reach the endgame, and are thus not typically suited for casual gaming. However, games like DOFUS, Eve Online(Specially flying to 0.0 security space.) and The Lord of the Rings Online try to balance leveling between any casual gamers and those dedicating more hours to the game.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.mmosite.com/interview/content/2006-10-11/20061011000827330,1.shtml|publisher=mmosite.com|author=Shine|title=Crusade Interview With David Allen[/tpl]

===Core gamer===

A core or mid-core gamer is a player with a wider range of interests than a casual gamer and is more likely to enthusiastically play different types of games,[tpl]cite web|url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/index.html?disableNav=true/#/e32011/newhw/0/6|title=Iwata Asks: E3 2011 Special Edition|page=7|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2011-06-09|quote=Iwata:  the definition of a core gamer is much wider, namely, someone who has a much wider range of interests, someone who enthusiastically plays many types of games that challenges different creative directions.[/tpl] but without the amount of time spent and sense of competition of a hardcore gamer. The mid-core gamer enjoys games but may not finish every game they buy, doesn't have time for long MMO quests,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/06/are-you-a-mid-core-gamer/|title=Are you a mid-core gamer?|publisher=joystiq.com|author=Scott Jon Siegel[/tpl] and is a target consumer.[tpl]cite web | title=GameStop | url=http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1277&Itemid=32 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071203110531/http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1277&Itemid=32 | archivedate=2007-12-03 | first=Colin | last=Campbell | date=2005-10-10 | work=Edge | publisher=Future| accessdate=2008-02-07[/tpl] Nintendo president Satoru Iwata stated that they designed the Wii U to cater to core gamers who are in between the casual and hardcore categories.[tpl]cite web|url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/index.html?disableNav=true/#/e32011/newhw/0/6|title=Iwata Asks: E3 2011 Special Edition|page=7|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2011-06-09|quote=Iwata: On the other hand, I certainly do not think that Wii was able to cater to every gamer's needs, so that's also something I wanted to resolve. ... The keyword for our presentation at this year's E3 is "Deeper and Wider". With Wii U, I would like to offer this proposal with that concept.[/tpl]
A number of theories have been presented regarding the rise in popularity of mid-core games.  James Hursthouse, the founder of Roadhouse Interactive credits the evolution of devices towards tablets and touch-screen interfaces, whereas Jon Radoff of Disruptor Beam compares the emergence of mid-core games to similar increases in media sophistication that have occurred in media such as television.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/9/4604088/the-rise-of-midcore-gaming|title=Core gamers, mobile games and the origins of the midcore audience|publisher=Polygon|accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl]

===Hardcore gamer===

Hardcore gamers extend gaming into their lifestyle and may represent the stereotypical “game geek”. They are frequent purchasers of games, prefer to expend significant time on games, and are more likely to try to "master" their games by completing as many objectives as possible. Hardcore gamers may take part in video game culture such as competitions, events and conventions. Competitions may involve organized tournaments, leagues, or ranked play integrated into the game. An example of this is Major League Gaming, an electronic sports organization that often holds events for first-person shooter games such as Quake. There are many subtypes of hardcore gamers based on the style of game, gameplay preference, hardware platform, and other preferences.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

===Pro gamer===

Professional gamers play video games and deeply study the game to master it and usually to play in competitions. Professional gamers don't necessarily play for money or earn a salary, but many do.[tpl]cite web|author=Daniel Schorn |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/19/60minutes/main1220146.shtml |title='Fatal1ty' article at CBS News |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=2006-08-06 |accessdate=2010-07-16[/tpl] A professional gamer may also be another type of gamer, such as a hardcore gamer, if he or she meets the additional criteria for that gamer type. In countries of Asia, particularly South Korea and Japan, professional gamers are sponsored by large companies and can earn more than $100,000USD a year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/7/23/235053/081 |title=A Brief Look At Professional Gaming |publisher=kuro5hin.org |accessdate=2010-07-16[/tpl] In the United States, Major League Gaming has contracted electronic sports gamers with $250,000USD yearly deals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mlgpro.com/content/page/86605/MLG-Awards-1-75-Million-in-Contracts-for-Top-Pro-Gamers |title=MLG Awards $1.75 Million in Contracts for Top Pro Gamers | Major League Gaming |publisher=Mlgpro.com |date=2006-12-18 |accessdate=2010-07-16[/tpl]

===Newbie===

"Newbie" is a slang term for a novice or newcomer to a certain game, or to gaming in general.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/Masonry/Misc/welaish.html |title=Masonry on the Internet |publisher=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2012-05-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/23/words-online-gaming-opinions-books-newbs.html|title=Gamer Speak for Newbs|work=Forbes|author=Anna Vander Broek|date=2009-04-23|accessdate=2010-02-16[/tpl] Two derived terms are "newb", a beginner who expresses a willingness to learn; and "noob", a derogatory term (an alternate spelling for n00b), though "newb" and "n00b" have become opposites of each other, meaning "newb" is plainly someone who is new to the game (thus having the potential to get better) and "n00b" is a player who both lacks skill and mainly fools around (not wanting to become better).[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

===Retrogamer===

A retrogamer is a gamer preferring playing and collecting retro games - older video games and arcade games. They may also be called classic gamers or old-school gamers, which are terms that are more prevalent in the United States. The games are played either on the original hardware, on modern hardware via console emulation, or on modern hardware via ports or compilations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/articles/columns/game/gars-07142004.ars|title=NES Classics: retro gaming, at a price: Page 1|publisher=arstechnica.com|accessdate=2008-04-14|last=|first=[/tpl] Some retrogamers are in the business of refurbishing old games, particularly arcade cabinets. Some even make their own arcade cabinets.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]

===Girl gamer/Gamer girl===

A girl gamer/gamer girl is any female who regularly engages in playing video games. According to a study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association in 2009, 40% of the game playing population is female, and women 18 or older now comprise 34% of all gamers. Also, the percentage of women now playing online has risen to 43%, up 4% from 2004. The same study shows that 48% of game purchasers are female.The Entertainment Software Association - Home Page.

Usage of the term "girl gamer" is controversial. Some critics have advocated use of the label as a reappropriated term, while others see it as nondescriptive or  perpetuating the minority position of female gamers.Bendixsen, Stephanie 'Hex'. Games 4 Girlz?. ABC. 16 February 2011. Some critics of the term believe there is no singular definition of a female gamer and that they are as diverse as any other group."http://www.joystiq.com/2007/03/21/sxsw-getting-girls-into-the-game-designing-and-marketing-games"
Girl gamers are often subject to sexual harassment while engaged in online play or tournaments."http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/us/sexual-harassment-in-online-gaming-stirs-anger.html?_r=0" This harassment often consists of insults based on the gamer being "fat, ugly, or slutty", that they belong in the kitchen, or threats of abuse, rape, and murder."http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18280000"

===Gaymer===

Gaymer, or gay gamer, is a term used to refer to the group of people, who identify themselves as LGBT (gay, bisexual, lesbian, or transgendered) and have an active interest in video games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/05/08/gaymer-org-looks-to-trademark-gaymer/|title=Gaymer.org looks to trademark 'Gaymer'|author=Alexander Sliwinski|date=2007-05-08|accessdate=2011-06-05|work=Joystiq[/tpl] This demographic has been the subject of two large surveys, one by Jason Rockwood in 2006,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=7415 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060618040019/http://www.washingtonblade.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=7415 |archivedate=2006-06-18 |title=First-ever survey of gay videogamers |accessdate= |last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2006-06-10 |work= |publisher=Washington Blade |pages= |language= |quote=[/tpl] who noted the level of prejudice that gaymers endure,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.innewsweekly.com/innews/?class_code=Ga&article_code=2071|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090101100249/http://www.innewsweekly.com/innews/?class_code=Ga&article_code=2071|archivedate=2009-01-01|title=Gay video game player survey |accessdate= |last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2006-06-08 |work= |publisher=In Newsweekly |pages= |language= |quote=[/tpl] and another in 2009, focusing on the content that gaymers expect in videogames, the results of which were not published.[tpl]cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5377127/what-do-gay-gamers-want-from-their-games |title=What Do Gay Gamers Want From Their Games? |accessdate= |last=Fahey |first= Mike  |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2009-10-08 |work= |publisher=Kotaku.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.watermarkonline.com/w-news/orlando/item/403-orlando-student-conducts-gay-gamer-survey |title=Orlando student conducts gay gamer survey |accessdate= |last=Hyman |first=Jamie |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2009-09-03 |work= |publisher=Orlando Watermark |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=[/tpl]

==Avatar==

An avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a pseudonym) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with online multiplayer support, or at electronic sport conventions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]
Similarly, a clan tag is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans.  They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another.  Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other.  A team tag is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team.  Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation.  These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.
