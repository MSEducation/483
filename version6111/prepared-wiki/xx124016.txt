==History==

Plans for the workhouse were ongoing in 1910 with Snowden Ashford as the Municipal Architect responsible for the workhouse while Leon E. Dessez was the special architect who was appointed by the commissioners to draft plans for the new workhouse.Lorton Occoquan Workhouse Northern Virginia History Notes It opened in 1916 as a facility for less serious offenders in the Lorton Correctional Complex. It is located in nearby Lorton in southern Fairfax County, Virginia. In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed a special Penal Commission to investigate deplorable conditions of the District of Columbia's jail and workhouse in Washington. As a result, the Commission recommended a complete change in the philosophy and treatment of prisoners in D.C. The United States Congress acted upon this recommendation, and a [tpl]convert|1155|acre|km2|0|sing=on[/tpl] tract north of the Occoquan River was purchased in 1910 through condemnation proceedings.
Classically inspired, symmetrical dormitory complexes were constructed instead of cellblocks. The brick buildings were built by the prisoners themselves, using brick manufactured at the on-site kiln complex located on the banks of the Occoquan. It became known in its later years, however, as an outdated and badly overcrowded facility. The last prisoners were removed from Lorton Reformatory late in 2001.Kovaleski, Serge F.

As a result of the pickets of the women's suffrage movement in the Washington D.C. area, approximately 168 women, most from the National Women's Party, were detained and mistreated at the Medium Security facility from June to December 1917. (This was later dramatized in the 2004 film Iron Jawed Angels.) Some suffragists at the facility were force-fed after they began hunger strikes. http://www.defendingdissent.org/now/what-good-is-a-hunger-strike-today/ Also, November 14th, 1917, is known as the "Night of Terror" because suffragist prisoners were beaten and abused.[tpl]cite web|url=http://womensenews.org/story/our-story/041029/night-terror-leads-womens-vote-1917#.Us2mpUko6M8|title=Night of Terror Leads to Women's Vote in 1917|publisher=Women's eNews|accessdate=January 8, 2014[/tpl]

It required the county to develop a plan to maximize use of land for open space, parkland or recreation prior to the transfer. Plans for the land the prison occupied can be found at the Fairfax County planning site.Lower Potomac District Land Use and Development 2007 Edition Amended as of May 4, 2009 pp. 22-60.
