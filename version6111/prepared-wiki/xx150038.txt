==Biography==

Born in 1849 in New York City, he was the elder half-brother of once popular but now relatively obscure novelist Edgar Saltus.The Bookmart: Volume Seven, June, 1889 to May, 1890. Page 95. He was educated at Columbia UniversityVechten, Carl Van. Excavations: a Book of Advocacies. Page 95. Ayer Publishing, 1971. and later at the Roblot Institution in Paris. Saltus was the leader of a group of bohemians in New York, including his brother Edgar and the young James Huneker, which met at Billy Moulds' bar in Manhattan's University Place; they were fond of absinthe and had "a taste for anything exotic".Morris, Lloyd R. Incredible New York. Page 177. Ayer Publishing, 1975. Van Wyck Brooks remarked that the unhappy Saltus "looked like a Greek god gone to ruin, partly as a result of the absinthe that he drank to excess".Brooks, Van Wyck. The Confident Years, 1885-1915. Page 3. Dutton, 1955. His verse reflects a refined, erotic and decadent temperament similar to that of his brother, inspired primarily by Edgar Allan Poe, Th√©ophile Gautier (of whom he was a student)Huneker, James. Steeplejack. Page 12. Charles Scribner's Sons, 1920. and Charles Baudelaire. He was praised by influential editor William Marion Reedy as an 'American Baudelaire' whose verse had "the perfume of exquisite sadness."Putzel, Max. J. The Man in the Mirror: William Marion Reedy and His Magazine. Page 44. University of Missouri Press, 1998. Able to converse in ten languages, Saltus also wrote poems in Italian, German and French.
