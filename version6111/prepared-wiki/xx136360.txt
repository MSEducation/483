[[Superficial external pudendal artery]]

CATEGORIES: Arteries of the lower limb

The superficial external pudendal artery (superficial external pudic artery) arises from the medial side of the femoral artery, close to the superficial epigastric artery and superficial iliac circumflex artery.

==Course and target==

After piercing the femoral sheath and fascia cribrosa, it courses medialward, across the spermatic cord (or round ligament in the female), to be distributed to the integument on the lower part of the abdomen, the penis and scrotum in the male, and the labium majus in the female, anastomosing with branches of the internal pudendal artery.
it crosses superficial to the inguinal ligament
