The Hillsborough disaster occurred on 15 April 1989 at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, England. During the FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football clubs, a human crush resulted in the deaths of 96 people and injuries to 766 others. The incident has since been blamed primarily on the police for letting too many people enter the stadium, and remains the worst stadium-related disaster in British history, and one of the world's worst football disasters.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article6083159.ece|title=Hillsborough: the disaster that changed football|last=Eason|first=Kevin|date=13 April 2009|work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=1 October 2009[/tpl]
At the time, semi-finals of the FA Cup were contested at a neutral venue.  For the 1989 tournament, the Football Association (FA) selected Hillsborough (home ground of Sheffield Wednesday football club) for the contest between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.  As is standard in domestic English football matches, opposing supporters were segregated in the stadium. Liverpool fans were allocated the Leppings Lane stand. Entry to the Leppings Lane stand was possible only via one of seven decrepit turnstiles, a restriction that led to dangerous overcrowding outside the ground before kick-off. In an attempt to ease pressure outside the ground, Chief Superintendent  David Duckenfield, the senior police officer responsible for the match, ordered an exit gate to be opened. The opened exit gate led to a tunnel marked "Standing", which led directly to the two already overcrowded enclosures. In previous years, the tunnel had been closed off by police when the two central pens were full; however, on this occasion the tunnel was unmanned.
The ensuing influx of supporters caused crushing, and some fans climbed over side fences or were lifted by fellow supporters onto the stand above to escape the crush. Moments after kick-off, a crush barrier broke, and fans began to fall on top of each other. The game was stopped after six minutes. To carry away the injured, supporters tore down advertising hoardings to use as stretchers, and emergency services were called to provide assistance. Of the 96 people who died, only 14 had been admitted to a hospital. When the FA Chairman visited the Control Box to find out what had happened, Duckenfield falsely claimed that the supporters had "rushed" the gate.Scrutiny of Evidence relating to the Hillsborough football stadium disaster, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, February 1998, Page 83
The 1990 official inquiry into the disaster, the Taylor Report, concluded that "the main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control." The findings of the report resulted in the elimination of standing terraces at all major football stadiums in England, Wales and Scotland.
On the 20th anniversary of the disaster, government minister Andy Burnham called for the police, ambulance and all other public agencies to release documents that had not been made available to Lord Justice Taylor in 1989.Conn, David (17 April 2009). "Football: David Conn on Hillsborough". The Guardian. Retrieved 12 September 2012. This action led to the formation of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, which in September 2012 concluded that no Liverpool fans were responsible for the deaths, and that attempts had been made by the authorities to conceal what happened, including the alteration by police of 116 statements relating to the disaster.Owen Gibson, David Conn and Haroon Siddique (12 September 2012). "Hillsborough disaster: David Cameron apologises for 'double injustice'". The Guardian. Retrieved 12 September 2012. The facts in the report prompted immediate apologies from Prime Minister David Cameron; the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, David Crompton; Football Association Chairman David Bernstein; and Kelvin MacKenzie, then-editor of The Sun, for their organisations' respective roles."Hillsborough files released: As it happened". BBC News. Retrieved 12 September 2012.
In September 2012, the Hillsborough Independent Panel concluded that up to 41 of the 96 fatalities might have been avoided had they received prompt medical treatment.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-19543964 |title=Hillsborough papers: Cameron apology over 'double injustice'|work=BBC News|date=12 September 2012 |accessdate=13 July 2013[/tpl] The report revealed "multiple failures" by other emergency services and public bodies that contributed to the death toll. In response to the panel's report, the  Attorney General for England and Wales, Dominic Grieve MP, confirmed he would consider all the new evidence to evaluate whether the original inquest verdicts of accidental death could be overturned.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/2012/09/12/attorney-general-to-consider-overturning-hillsborough-inquest-verdicts-100252-31823481/ |title=Attorney General to consider overturning Hillsborough inquest verdicts |work= Liverpool Echo|date=12 September 2012[/tpl] On 19 December 2012, a new inquest was granted in the High Court.

==Before the disaster==

===The venue===

Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, the home of Sheffield Wednesday, was selected by the Football Association (FA) as a neutral venue to host the 1988–89 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football clubs. Kick-off was scheduled for 3:00 pm on 15 April, and fans were advised to take up positions fifteen minutes beforehand.
At the time of the disaster, most British football stadiums had high steel fencing between the spectators and the playing field in response to both friendly and hostile pitch invasions. Hooliganism had affected the sport for some years, and was particularly virulent in England.[tpl]Cite news |title=Before Hillsborough fans were seen as terrace fodder.

A report by Eastwood & Partners for a safety certificate for the stadium in 1978 concluded that although it failed to meet the recommendations of the Green Guide, a guide to safety at sports grounds, the consequences were minor. It emphasised the general situation at Hillsborough was satisfactory compared with most grounds.[tpl]rp|67[/tpl]
Risks associated with confining fans in pens were highlighted by the Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds (the Popplewell inquiry) after the Bradford City stadium fire in May 1985. It made recommendations on the safety of crowds penned within fences,[tpl]cite news|last=Taylor|first=Daniel|title=How Bradford fire neglect left Hillsborough doomed to disaster|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/sep/15/hillsborough-bradford-daniel-taylor?newsfeed=true|work=The Guardian Sports Blog |accessdate=15 September 2012|date=15 September 2012[/tpl] including that "all exit gates should be manned at all times ... and capable of being opened immediately from the inside by anyone in an emergency".[tpl]cite book|title=Cmd 9710: Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds Final Report|year=1986|publisher=The Stationery Office, London|page=62|url=http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/HWP000000170001.html[/tpl]

===Warning signs===

Hillsborough was a regular venue for FA Cup semi-finals in the 1980s, hosting five matches. A crush occurred at the Leppings Lane end of the ground during the 1981 semi-final between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers after hundreds more spectators were permitted to enter the terrace than could safely be accommodated, resulting in 38 injuries, including broken arms, legs and ribs.Taylor (1989), p. 21. Police believed there had been a real chance of fatalities had swift action not been taken, and recommended the club reduce its capacity. In a post-match briefing to discuss the incident, Sheffield Wednesday chairman Bert McGee remarked: "Bollocks—no one would have been killed".Statement of Witness. Assistant Chief Constable Robert Goslin 14 August 1990.Conn, David. Safety failings that contributed to death of 96 Liverpool fans were foreseeable The Guardian. 19 September 2012. This incident prompted Sheffield Wednesday to alter the layout at the Leppings Lane end, dividing the terrace into three separate pens to restrict sideways movement. The terrace was divided into five pens when the club was promoted to the First Division in 1984, and a crush barrier near the access tunnel was removed in 1986 to improve the flow of fans entering and exiting the central enclosure. Its capacity remained unaltered and the safety certificate was not updated. After the crush in 1981, Hillsborough was not chosen to host an FA Cup semi-final for six years until 1987.

A Leeds fan described disorganisation at the turnstiles and no steward or police direction inside the stadium, resulting in the crowd in one enclosure becoming so compressed he was at times unable to raise and clap his hands. Other accounts told of fans having to be pulled to safety from above.
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest met in the semi-final at Hillsborough in 1988, and fans reported crushing at the Leppings Lane end. Liverpool lodged a complaint before the match in 1989. One supporter wrote to the Football Association and Minister for Sport complaining, "The whole area was packed solid to the point where it was impossible to move and where I, and others around me, felt considerable concern for personal safety".[tpl]cite news|last=Ross |first=Sam |url= http://www.webcitation.org/6AhxlVdrj|title=David Bernstein makes unreserved apology for Hillsborough disaster|work=Metro|date= 13 September 2012[/tpl] After changes to the ground's layout in 1981, its safety certificate became invalid but was not renewed.

==The disaster==

===Build-up===

As is common at domestic matches in England, opposing supporters were segregated. Nottingham Forest supporters were allocated the South and East ends (Spion Kop) with a combined capacity of 29,800, reached by 60 turnstiles spaced along two sides of the ground. Liverpool supporters were allocated the North and West ends (Leppings Lane), holding 24,256 fans, reached by 23 turnstiles from a narrow concourse. 10 turnstiles (numbered 1 to 10) provided access to 9,700 seats in the North Stand; a further 6 turnstiles (numbered 11 to 16) provided access to 4,456 seats in the upper tier of the West Stand.  Finally, 7 turnstiles (numbered A to G) provided access to 10,100 standing places in the lower tier of the West Stand. Although Liverpool had more supporters, Nottingham Forest was allocated the larger area, to avoid the approach routes of rival fans crossing. As a result of the stadium layout and segregation policy, turnstiles that would normally have been used to enter the North Stand from the east were off-limits and all Liverpool supporters had to converge on a single entrance at Leppings Lane. On match day, radio and television advised fans without tickets not to attend.Taylor (1989), p. 5.
Three chartered trains transported Liverpool supporters to Sheffield for a match fixture in 1988, but only one such train ran in 1989.Taylor (1989), p. 9. Many supporters wished to enjoy the day and were in no hurry to enter the stadium too early. Some supporters were delayed by roadworks while crossing the Pennines on the M62 motorway which resulted in minor traffic congestion. Between 2:30 pm and 2:40 pm, there was a build-up of supporters outside the turnstiles facing Leppings Lane, eager to enter the stadium before the game began.
A bottleneck developed with more fans arriving than could be safely filtered through the turnstiles before 3:00 pm. People presenting tickets at the wrong turnstiles and those who had been refused entry could not leave because of the crowd behind them but remained as an obstruction. Fans outside could hear cheering as the teams came on the pitch ten minutes before the match started, and as the match kicked off, but could not get in. A police constable radioed control asking the game to be delayed, as it had been two years before, to ensure the safe passage of supporters into the ground. The request was received but declined.Taylor (1989), p. 11.
With an estimated 5,000 fans trying to enter through the turnstiles and increasing safety concerns, the police, to avoid fatalities outside the ground, opened a large exit gate (Gate C) that ordinarily permitted the free flow of supporters departing the stadium. Two further gates were opened to relieve pressure. After an initial rush, thousands of supporters entered the stadium "steadily at a fast walk".Taylor (1989), p. 12.

===The crush===

When the gates were opened, thousands of fans entered a narrow tunnel leading to the rear of the terrace into two overcrowded central pens, creating pressure at the front. Hundreds of people were pressed against one another and the fencing by the weight of the crowd behind them. People entering were unaware of the problems at the fence; police or stewards usually stood at the entrance to the tunnel and, when the central pens reached capacity, directed fans to the side pens, but on this occasion, for reasons not fully explained, did not. A BBC TV news report conjectured that if police had positioned two police horses correctly, they would have acted as breakwaters directing many fans into side pens, but on this occasion, it was not done.
For some time, problems at the front of the pen went unnoticed, except by those affected, as attention was absorbed by the match. At 3:06 pm the referee, Ray Lewis, on the advice of the police, stopped the match after fans climbed the fence in an effort to escape the crush and went onto the track. By this time, a small gate in the fence had been forced open and some fans escaped via this route, as others continued to climb over the fencing. The police attempted to stop fans from spilling onto the pitch. Other fans were pulled to safety by fans in the West Stand above the Leppings Lane terrace. The intensity of the crush broke the crush barriers on the terraces. Holes in the perimeter fencing were made by fans desperately attempting to rescue others.
Those trapped were packed so tightly in the pens that many victims died of compressive asphyxia while standing. The crowd in the Leppings Lane Stand overspilled onto the pitch, where many injured and traumatised fans congregated who had climbed to safety. Police, stewards and members of the St John Ambulance service were overwhelmed. Many uninjured fans assisted the injured; several attempted CPR and others tore down advertising hoardings to use as stretchers. Chief Superintendent John Nesbit of South Yorkshire Police later briefed Michael Shersby MP that leaving the rescue to the fans was a deliberate strategy, and is quoted as saying "We let the fans help so that they would not take out their frustration on the police" at a Police Federation conference.Report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, Page 360, Section 2.12.161
As events unfolded, some police officers were still deployed making a cordon three-quarters of the way down the pitch to prevent Liverpool supporters reaching the opposing supporters. Some fans tried to break through the cordon to ferry injured fans to waiting ambulances but were forcibly turned back. 44 ambulances arrived, but police prevented all but one from entering the stadium.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7992687.stm |title= Ambulanceman: 'There were a lot of demands' |work=BBC News |date=15 April 2009[/tpl]

===Effect on survivors===

By the disaster's 10th anniversary in 1999, at least three people who survived were known to have committed suicide caused by  emotional problems brought on by the disaster. Another survivor had spent eight years in psychiatric care. Numerous cases of alcoholism and drug abuse were also attributed to lingering effects from the disaster, and it contributed to the collapse of a number of marriages involving people who had witnessed the events.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/1999/may/08/weekend7.weekend |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=Those who were left behind |date=8 May 1999[/tpl]

==The Taylor Inquiry==

After the disaster, Lord Justice Taylor was appointed to conduct an inquiry into the events. The Taylor Inquiry sat for a total of 31 days and published two reports: an interim report which laid out the events of the day and immediate conclusions,[tpl]cite web |last=Taylor |first=Lord Justice |authorlink=Peter Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gosforth |date=August 1989 |title=Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry – Interim Report |url=http://www.southyorks.police.uk/sites/default/files/Taylor%20Interim%20Report.pdf |accessdate=18 September 2012 |format=PDF[/tpl] and the final report which outlined general recommendations on football ground safety. This became known as the Taylor Report.
Lord Justice Taylor concluded that "policing on 15 April broke down" and "although there were other causes, the main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control." Attention was focused on the decision to open the secondary gates; moreover, the kick-off should have been delayed, as had been done at other venues and matches.
Sheffield Wednesday was criticised for the inadequate number of turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end and the poor quality of the crush barriers on the terraces, "respects in which failure by the Club contributed to this disaster."Taylor (1989), p. 52.

===Police control===

Taylor found there was "no provision" for controlling the entry of spectators into the turnstile area. Questioned why more action had not been taken to screen individuals and improve the flow of supporters approaching the stadium from the west "where the turnstile area was so small and awkwardly laid out", senior police officers responded that policy and practice had been no different from in the past, and they had no reason to anticipate problems as earlier events had proceeded without major incident. Taylor noted two occasions when the entry at Leppings Lane had been the sole access to the north and west sides of the ground, at the 1987 and 1988 semi-finals, with evidence of congestion at both, but owing to good fortune and circumstance police policy "was not put to the same test and strain as a year later".
 The senior police officers said it had never happened before so there was no reason to foresee it. In fact, the only two previous occasions when the Leppings Lane terraces had been used to fill the whole of the north and west sides of the ground were at the two semi-finals, in 1987 and 1988. In 1987, the match was on a Sunday scheduled for 12 noon, and kick-off was postponed for a quarter of an hour because of late arrivals.Taylor (1989), p. 36. 
 The need to open gate C was due to dangerous congestion at the turnstiles. That occurred because, as both Club and police should have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope with the large numbers demanded of it unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The Operational Order and police tactics on the day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival of large numbers should that occur in a short period. That it might so occur was foreseeable and it did.Taylor (1989), p. 47. 
As a result of the inadequate number of turnstiles, it has been estimated that it would have taken until 3:40 pm to get all ticket holders into the Leppings Lane end had an exit gate not been opened. Gate C was opened to let fans in, but the number of fans entering the terrace was not thought to have been more than the capacity of the entire standing area. Once inside the stadium, most fans entering the terraces headed for the central pens 3 and 4, as directed by a large sign above the access tunnel.
 Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 pm, the tunnel should have been closed off whether gate C was to be opened or not. ... It should have been clear in the control room where there was a view of the pens and of the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If orders had been given to that effect when gate C was opened, the fans could have been directed to the empty areas of the wings and this disaster could still have been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder of the first magnitude.Taylor (1989), p. 40. 
Standard procedure for league fixtures was to estimate the size of the visiting fan base, determine how many enclosures need to be opened, then fill each standing area one at a time.Taylor (1989), p. 30. For all-ticket games that had sold out, such as semi-final matches, a different approach was adopted whereby supporters were allowed to enter any enclosure they wished upon arrival. There was no mechanical or electronic means for calculating when individual enclosures had reached capacity. A police officer made a visual assessment before guiding fans to other pens.Taylor (1989), p. 23.
 Whilst in theory the police would intervene if a pen became "full", in practice they permitted the test of fullness to be what the fans would tolerate. By 2.52 pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 and 4 were over-full even by this test. Many were uncomfortable. To allow any more into those pens was likely to cause injuries; to allow in a large stream was courting disaster.Taylor (1989), p. 32. 
The official combined capacity of the central pens was 2,200, but the Health and Safety Executive found this should have been reduced to 1,693 as crush barriers and perimeter gates did not conform to the Green Guide.Taylor (1989), p. 24. It is estimated that more than 3,000 people were in the pens shortly after kick off at 3:00 pm. Overcrowding caused the fatal crush.
 When spectators first appeared on the track, the immediate assumption in the control room was that a pitch invasion was threatened. This was unlikely at the beginning of a match. It became still less likely when those on the track made no move towards the pitch. ... There was no effective leadership either from control or on the pitch to harness and organise rescue efforts. No orders were given for officers to enter the tunnel and relieve pressure.Taylor (1989), p. 44. 
 The anxiety to protect the sanctity of the pitch has caused insufficient attention to be paid to the risk of a crush due to overcrowding. Certain it was, that once the crush occurred on 15 April gates 3 and 4 were wholly inadequate for rescue purposes.Taylor (1989), p. 46. 
Lord Taylor regarded spectator allocation irrelevant to the disaster. "I do not consider choice of ends was causative of the disaster. Had it been reversed, the disaster could well have occurred in a similar manner but to Nottingham supporters."Taylor (1989), p. 49.

===Aggravating factors===

Accusations that the behaviour of Liverpool fans contributed to the disaster centred around consumption of alcohol before the game and attempts to enter the ground without a ticket. Although Lord Taylor acknowledged that these aggravated the situation, they were secondary factors. Witness estimates of the number of fans who were drunk varied from a minority to a large proportion of the crowd. Although it was clear many fans had been drinking, Lord Taylor unequivocally stated that most of them were: "not drunk, nor even the worse for drink". He concluded that they formed an exacerbating factorTaylor (1989), p. 34. and that police, seeking to rationalise their loss of control, overestimated the element of drunkenness in the crowd.http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/docs/HWP000000180001.pdf
The Hillsborough Independent Panel later noted that, despite being dismissed by the Taylor Report, the idea that alcohol contributed to the disaster proved remarkably durable. Documents later disclosed confirm that repeated attempts were made to find supporting evidence for alcohol being a factor, and that available evidence was significantly misinterpreted. It noted "The weight placed on alcohol in the face of objective evidence of a pattern of consumption modest for a leisure event was inappropriate. It has since fuelled persistent and unsustainable assertions about drunken fan behaviour."[tpl]cite web|url=http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/report/Section-1/summary/page-5/ |title=Page 4 | Home Office |publisher=Hillsborough.independent.gov.uk |date=15 April 1989 |accessdate=15 April 2014[/tpl]
The possibility of fans attempting to gain entry without tickets or with forged tickets was suggested as a contributing factor. South Yorkshire Police suggested the late arrival of fans amounted to a conspiracy to gain entry without tickets. However, analysis of the electronic monitoring system, Health and Safety Executive analysis, and eyewitness accounts showed that the total number of people who entered the Leppings Lane end was below the official capacity of the stand. Eye witness reports suggested that tickets were available on the day and tickets for the Leppings Lane end were on sale from Anfield until the day before. The report dismissed the conspiracy theory.

===Police evasion===

Taylor concluded his criticism of South Yorkshire Police by describing senior officers in command as "defensive and evasive witnesses" who refused to accept any responsibility for error.
 In all some 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I must report that for the most part the quality of their evidence was in inverse proportion to their rank. 
 It is a matter of regret that at the hearing, and in their submissions, the South Yorkshire Police were not prepared to concede they were in any respect at fault in what occurred. ... The police case was to blame the fans for being late and drunk, and to blame the Club for failing to monitor the pens. ... Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether lessons have been learnt. It would have been more seemly and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.Taylor (1989), p. 50. 

===Effect on stadia in Britain===

The Taylor Report had a deep impact on safety standards for stadia in the UK. Perimeter and lateral fencing was removed and many top stadia were converted to all-seated.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/318497.stm |title=A hard lesson to learn |date=15 April 1999 |work=BBC News |accessdate=4 August 2007 |location=London[/tpl] Purpose-built stadiums for Premier League and most Football League teams since the report are all-seater.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.millwall-history.co.uk/the_den5.htm |title=The Architects Journal:Building Study (September 1993) |publisher=Millwall-history.co.uk |accessdate=7 May 2011[/tpl] Chester City F.C.'s Deva Stadium was the first English football stadium to fulfil the safety recommendations of the Taylor Report, with Millwall F.C.'s The Den being the first new stadium to be built that fulfilled the recommendations.
Lord Taylor noted that the evidence he received was overwhelmingly in favour of more seating accommodation and that most was in favour of reversing the two thirds to one third standing–seating ratio.The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Inquiry by Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor Final Report – 66 His final report made 76 recommendations,The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Inquiry by Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor Final Report – Part V including a reduction in standing in line with this evidence but that, after a given timescale, all stadia designated under the Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 should admit spectators to seated accommodation only.The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Inquiry by Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor Final Report – Part V, 1 A number of his recommendations were not implemented, including all-seating for sports other than football.Stand Up Sit Down – A Choice to Watch Football. Peter Caton 2012. Troubador. ISBN 978-1-78088-177-5. Chapter 16
The Football Spectators Act (1989) contained a regulation requiring football grounds to become all-seated as directed by the Secretary of State.Football Spectators Act 1989. Section 11 This was to be overseen by the Football Licensing AuthorityFootball Spectators Act 1989. Section 8 (now the Sport Grounds Safety Authority).
In July 1992, the Government announced a relaxation of the regulation for the lower two English leagues (known now as League One and League Two). The Football Spectators Act does not cover Scotland, but the Scottish Premier League chose to make all-seater stadia a requirement of league membership.SPL rules In England and Wales all-seating is a requirement of the Premier LeaguePremier League rules and of the Football League for clubs who have been present in the Championship for more than three seasons.Football League rules
Several campaigns have been active in attempting to get the government to relax the regulation and allow standing areas to return to Premiership and Championship grounds.Stand Up Sit Down – A Choice to Watch Football. Peter Caton 2012. Troubador. ISBN 978-1-78088-177-5 Chapters 23 – 25

==Stuart-Smith scrutiny==

In May 1997, when the Labour Party came into office, Home Secretary Jack Straw ordered an investigation. It was performed by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.contrast.org/hillsborough/history/stuartsmith.shtm |title=The Stuart Smith Scrutiny - Hillsborough Football Disaster |publisher=Contrast.org |date= |accessdate=14 September 2012[/tpl] The appointment of Stuart-Smith was not without controversy. At a meeting in Liverpool with relatives of those involved in Hillsborough in October 1997, he flippantly remarked "Have you got a few of your people or are they like the Liverpool fans, turn up at the last minute?" He "apologised" for his remark, saying it was not intended to offend. The terms of reference of his inquiry were limited to "new evidence", that is "...evidence which was not available or was not presented to the previous inquires, courts or authorities." Therefore evidence such as witness statements which had been altered were classed as inadmissible.
When he presented his report in February 1998, he concluded that there was insufficient evidence for a new inquiry into the disaster. In paragraph 5 of his summary he said:
 I have come to the clear conclusion that there is no basis upon which there should be a further Judicial Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry. There is no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988. I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken. Nor do I consider that there is any justification for setting up any further inquiry into the performance of the emergency and hospital services. I have considered the circumstances in which alterations were made to some of the self-written statements of South Yorkshire Police officers, but I do not consider that there is any occasion for any further investigation.Stuart-Smith, Murray. Scrutiny of Evidence Relating to the Hillsborough Football Stadium Disaster London, The Stationary Office, 1998. 
Importantly Stuart-Smith's report supported the coroner's assertion that evidence after 3.15pm was inadmissible as "that by 3.15 pm the principal cause of death, that is, the crushing, was over."[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo980508/debtext/80508-01.htm|title=8 May 1998 : Column 941|publisher=www.parliament.uk|accessdate=15 September 2012[/tpl] This was controversial as the subsequent response of the police and emergency services would not be scrutinised. Announcing the report to the House of Commons, Home Secretary Jack Straw backed Stuart-Smith's findings and said that "I do not believe that a further inquiry could or would uncover significant new evidence or provide any relief for the distress of those who have been bereaved."

==Hillsborough Independent Panel==

The Hillsborough Independent Panel was instituted by the British government to investigate the Hillsborough disaster with the remit to oversee the disclosure of thousands of documents about the disaster and its aftermath and to produce a report illustrating how the information disclosed added to public understanding of the disaster and its aftermath. On 12 September 2012 it published its reportThe Report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel September 2012. and simultaneously launched a website containing 450,000 pages of material collated from more than 80 organisations over two years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/index.html |title=Hillsborough Independent Panel |publisher=Hillsborough.independent.gov.uk |date=15 April 1989 |accessdate=14 September 2012[/tpl]

===History of the panel===

In the years after the disaster there was a feeling that the full facts were not in the public domain and a suspicion that some facts were deliberately covered up. The Hillsborough Family Support Group, led by Trevor Hicks, campaigned for the release of all relevant documents. After the disaster's 20th anniversary in April 2009, supported by the Culture secretary, Andy Burnham, and Minister of State for Justice, Maria Eagle, the government asked the Home Office and Department of Culture, Media and Sport to investigate the best way for this information to be made public.
In December 2009, Home Secretary Alan Johnson announced the formation of the Hillsborough Independent Panel with a remit to oversee "full public disclosure of relevant government and local information within the limited constraints set out in the disclosure protocol" and "consult with the Hillsborough families to ensure that the views of those most affected by the disaster are taken into account".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/wmstext/91215m0004.htm|title=Parliamentary business|publisher=Parliament.uk|date=15 December 2009[/tpl] An archive of all relevant documentation would be created and a report produced within two years explaining the work of the panel and its conclusions.
The panel was chaired by James Jones, the Bishop of Liverpool. Other members were:-

===Findings===

On 12 September 2012, the Hillsborough Independent PanelHome Page Hillsborough Independent Report concluded that no Liverpool fans were responsible in any way for the disaster,[tpl]cite web|title=Page 14 - Hillsborough Independent Panel|url=http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/report/Section-1/summary/page-14/|work=Hillsborough Independent Panel Report|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl] and that its main cause was a "lack of police control". Crowd safety was "compromised at every level" and overcrowding issues had been recorded two years earlier. The panel concluded that "up to 41" of the 96 who perished might have survived had the emergency services' reactions and co-ordination been improved.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-inquest-prosecutions-report?intcmp=239 |title=Hillsborough disaster: new inquest likely after damning report|work= The Guardian|date=13 September 2012|accessdate=22 March 2013|first1=Owen|last1=Gibson|first2=David|last2=Conn[/tpl] The number is based on post-mortem examinations which found some victims may have had heart, lung or blood circulation function for some time after being removed from the crush. The report stated that placing fans who were "merely unconscious" on their backs would have resulted in their deaths.Tozer James 41 could have survived stadium crush The Advertiser 14 September 2012 p. 36
The findings concluded that 164 witness statements had been altered. Of those statements, 116 were amended to remove or change negative comments about South Yorkshire Police. South Yorkshire Police had performed blood alcohol tests on the victims, some of them children, and ran computer checks on the national police database in an attempt to "impugn their reputation".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-report-panel-released-live|title=Hillsborough disaster report published - Wednesday 12 September|publisher=Guardian.co.uk|date=12 September 2012|first=Haroon|last=Siddique[/tpl] The report concluded that the then Conservative MP for Sheffield Hallam, Irvine Patnick, passed inaccurate and untrue information from the police to the press.Hillsborough files: Calls to strip Sir Irvine Patnick of knighthood The ScotsmanHillsborough: The Report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, pages 350-352.

The IPCC announced on 12 October 2012 it would investigate the failure of the police to declare a major incident, failure to close the tunnel to the stands which led to overcrowded pens despite evidence it had been closed in such circumstances in the past; changes made to the statements of police officers; actions which misled Parliament and the media; shortcomings of previous investigations; and the role played by Norman Bettison. Separately the Director of Public Prosecutions announced a review of evidence, including from the HIP Report, to determine if criminal charges, including charges of corporate manslaughter arising out of gross negligence, should be brought by the Crown Prosecution Service against South Yorkshire police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield City Council, the Football Association, or individuals.
The IPCC investigation amounts to the biggest independent review of the police ever conducted; by 22 October 2012, the names of at least 1,444 serving and former police officers have been referred. In its announcement, the IPCC praised the tenacity of the Hillsborough families' campaign for truth and justice.[tpl]cite news|last=Gibson|first=Owen|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/12/hillsborough-disaster-new-evidence-ipcc|title=Hillsborough disaster: the new evidence under IPCC investigation|accessdate=2 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 October 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Gibson|first=Owen|title=Hillsborough disaster: watchdog to launch biggest ever inquiry into police|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/12/hillsborough-disaster-biggest-inquiry-police|accessdate=12 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 October 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Conn|first=David|title=IPCC Hillsborough inquiry is another vindication for families|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/12/ipcc-hillsborough-inquiry-vindication-families|accessdate=12 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 October 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Hillsborough probe 'to be UK's biggest into police conduct'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19922092|accessdate=12 October 2012|newspaper=BBC News website|date=12 October 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Hillsborough: 1,444 police names passed to IPCC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20035472|accessdate=24 October 2012|newspaper=BBC News Website|date=22 October 2012[/tpl] On 16 October 2012, the Attorney General announced in Parliament he has applied to have the original inquest verdict quashed, arguing it proceeded on a false basis and evidence now to hand requires this exceptional step.[tpl]cite news|title=Hillsborough: Application for new inquests|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-19960279|accessdate=16 October 2012|newspaper=BBC News website|date=16 October 2012[/tpl]

Several memorials have been erected in memory of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster; all are listed below:

===Memorial ceremonies===

The disaster has been acknowledged on 15 April each year by the community in Liverpool and football in general. An annual memorial ceremony is held at Anfield and at a church in Liverpool. The 10th and 20th anniversaries were marked by special services to remember the victims.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Since 2007 there has been a Hillsborough Memorial service held at Spion Kop, KZN South Africa. The significance of this ceremony is that it is held on the Spion Kop Battlefield which gave its name to the Kop Stand at Anfield. There is a permanent memorial to the 96 fans who died, in the form of a bench in view of the battlefield at a nearby lodge. Dean Davis and David Walters, members of the Official South African Liverpool Supporters Club (Gauteng Branch), are responsible for the service and the bench was commissioned by Guy Prowse in 2008.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The FA decided all FA Cup, Premier League, Football League and Football Conference matches 11–14 April 2014 would kick-off seven minutes later than originally scheduled with a six-minute delay and a one-minute silence tribute.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2014/mar/hillsborough-kick-off-tribute-210314|title=Football to remember Hillsborough disaster |work=The FA |location=UK |date=21 March 2014 |accessdate=12 April 2014 |first=FA |last=Staff[/tpl]

===Tenth anniversary===

In 1999 Anfield was packed with a crowd of around 10,000 people ten years after the disaster.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/a-minutes-silence-to-remember-hillsborough-1086572.html|title=A minute's silence to remember Hillsborough |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=11 April 1999 |accessdate=15 April 2009 |first=Lousie |last=Jury[/tpl] A candle was lit for each of the 96 victims. The clock at the Kop End stood still at 3:06 pm, the time that the referee had blown his whistle in 1989 and a minute's silence was held, the start signalled by match referee from that day, Ray Lewis. A service led by the Right Reverend James Jones, the Bishop of Liverpool, was attended by past and present Liverpool players, including Robbie Fowler, Steve McManaman and Alan Hansen. According to the BBC report: "The names of the victims were read from the memorial book and floral tributes were laid at a plaque bearing their names."[tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/319927.stm |title=Plea for Hillsborough justice |work=BBC News |date=15 April 1999 |accessdate=15 April 2009 |location=London[/tpl] A gospel choir performed and the ceremony ended with a rendition of "You'll Never Walk Alone". The anniversary was also marked by a minute's silence at the weekend's league games and FA Cup semi-finals.

===Twentieth anniversary===

In 2009, on the 20th anniversary of the disaster, Liverpool's request that their Champions League quarter-finals return leg, scheduled for 15 April, be played the day before was granted.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/liverpool-avoid-hillsborough-anniversary-clash-1650267.html |title=Liverpool avoid Hillsborough anniversary clash |date=20 March 2009 |agency=Reuters |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=2 April 2010[/tpl]
The event was remembered with a ceremony at Anfield attended by over 28,000 people.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.espnstar.com/football/fa-cup/news/detail/item247176/Reds-united-in-demanding-justice/ |title=Reds united in demanding justice |publisher=ESPN Star |date=16 April 2009 |accessdate=7 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Thousands flock to Anfield as Liverpool marks 20th anniversary of Hillsborough |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/hillsborough/hillsborough-news/2009/04/15/no-headline-100252-23393125/ |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=15 April 2009[/tpl] The Kop, Centenary and Main Stands were opened to the public before part of the Anfield Road End was opened to supporters. The memorial service, led by the Bishop of Liverpool began at 14:45 BST and a two minutes silence (observed across Liverpool and in Sheffield and Nottingham, including public transport coming to a stand-still)[tpl]Cite news |title=Sheffield's Hillsborough tribute |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/7999413.stm |work=BBC News |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=15 April 2009 |location=London[/tpl] was held at the time of the disaster twenty years earlier, 15:06 BST. Sports Minister Andy Burnham addressed the crowd but was heckled by supporters chanting "Justice for the 96".[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/liverpool/5160448/Liverpool-fans-turn-on-Andy-Burnham-at-Hillsborough-memorial.html |title=Liverpool fans turn on Andy Burnham |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=15 April 2009 |first=Jim |last=White[/tpl] The ceremony was attended by survivors of the disaster, families of victims and the Liverpool team, with goalkeeper Pepe Reina leading the team and management staff onto the pitch. Team captain Steven Gerrard and vice-captain Jamie Carragher handed the freedom of the city to the families of all the victims. Candles were lit for each of the 96 people who died. Kenny Dalglish, Liverpool's manager at the time of the disaster, read a passage from the Bible, "Lamentations of Jeremiah". The Liverpool manager, Rafael Benítez, set 96 balloons free. The ceremony ended with 96 rings of church bells across the city and a rendition of "You'll Never Walk Alone".[tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7999279.stm |title=Fans remember Hillsborough |work=BBC News |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=15 April 2009 |location=London[/tpl]
Other services took place at the same time, including at Liverpool's Anglican and Catholic Cathedrals. After the two minutes' silence, bells on civic buildings rang out throughout Merseyside.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.southport.tv/page.php?id=Hillsborough-20th-Anniversary-Se |title=Southport.TV |publisher=Southport.TV |accessdate=7 May 2011[/tpl]

Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United players showed respect by wearing black armbands during their Champions League matches on 14 and 15 April.
On 14 May, more than 20,000 people packed Anfield for a match held in memory of the victims. The Liverpool Legends, comprising ex-Liverpool footballers beat the All Stars, captained by actor Ricky Tomlinson, 3–1. The event also raised cash for the Marina Dalglish Appeal which contribute towards a radiotherapy centre at University Hospital in Aintree.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2009/05/15/kenny-s-king-as-legends-triumph-100252-23632614/ |title=Kenny's king as Legends triumph |date=15 May 2009 |work=Liverpool Echo |accessdate=21 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/8051595.stm |title=Match marks Hillsborough tragedy |date=15 May 2009 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=21 May 2009 |location=London[/tpl]
With the imminent release of police documents relating to events on 15 April 1989, the Hillsborough Family Support Group launched Project 96, a fundraising initiative on 1 August 2009. At least 96 current and former Liverpool footballers are being lined up to raise £96,000 by auctioning a limited edition (of 96) signed photographs.
On 11 April 2009 Liverpool fans sang "You'll Never Walk Alone" as a tribute to the upcoming anniversary of the disaster before the home game against Blackburn Rovers (which ended in Liverpool winning 4–0) and was followed by former Liverpool player, Stephen Warnock presenting a memorial wreath to the Kop showing the figure  96  in red flowers.

===Tributes from other clubs===

The Hillsborough disaster touched not only Liverpool, but clubs in England and around the world.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Soccer Resumes, Sadly |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/23/sports/soccer-resumes-sadly.html?sec=&spon= |work=The New York Times |date=23 April 1989 |accessdate=29 December 2008 |postscript=[/tpl] Supporters of Everton, Liverpool's traditional local rivals, were affected, many of them having lost friends and family. Supporters laid down flowers and blue and white scarves to show respect for the dead and unity with fellow Merseysiders.
On 19 April 1989, the Wednesday after the disaster, the European Cup semi-final tie between A.C. Milan and Real Madrid was played. The referee blew his whistle two minutes into the game to stop play and hold a minute's silence for those who lost their lives at Hillsborough.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMRyFdrO8d8#t=0m05s|title=Milan vs Real Madrid |accessdate=4 April 2014[/tpl] Halfway through the minute's silence, the A.C.

As a result of the disaster, Liverpool's scheduled fixture against Arsenal was delayed from 23 April until the end of the season and eventually decided the league title. At this fixture, Arsenal players brought flowers onto the pitch and presented them to the Liverpool fans around the stadium before the game commenced. In 2006, Celtic fans produced a banner bearing the words  'Justice For The 96, You'll Never Walk Alone' and presented it to the Kopites during the Champions League quarter-final match at Anfield.Justice for the 96, in Jungle Bhoys: Welcome to Paradise, #4

==Charges against officials==

===Inquests===

Inquests into the deaths, commencing later in 1989, proved controversial. South Yorkshire coroner Stefan Popper limited the main inquest to events up to 3:15 pm on the day of the disaster – nine minutes after the match was halted and the crowd spilled onto the pitch. Popper said this was because the victims were either dead, or brain dead, by 3:15 pm. The decision angered the families, many of whom felt the inquest was unable to consider the response of the police and other emergency services after that time.Hillsborough disaster: Families fight to force police to acknowledge cover-up over statements The Guardian, 13 April 2009 The inquest returned a verdict of accidental death on 26 March 1991, much to the dismay of the bereaved families, who had been hoping for a verdict of unlawful killing or an open verdict, and for manslaughter charges to be brought against the officers who had been present at the disaster. Popper's decision was subsequently endorsed by the Divisional Court who considered it to have been justified in the light of the medical evidence available to him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/HOM000038090001.html |title=Judgement of Divisional Court, 5 November 1993 application to quash the Inquest verdicts of six of the Hillsborough victims | Hillsborough Independent Panel |publisher=Hillsborough.independent.gov.uk |date=5 November 1993 |accessdate=15 April 2014[/tpl]
Relatives later failed to have the inquest reopened to allow more scrutiny of police actions and closer examination of the circumstances of individual cases. Anne Williams, who lost her 15-year-old son, Kevin, appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, on the strength of witness statements that her son showed signs of life at 4:00 pm. Her case was rejected in March 2009.European court blow for mother of Hillsborough victim Liverpool Daily Post, 31 March 2009
On 19 April 2009, the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced she had requested secret files concerning the disaster should be made public.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/8006744.stm |title=Hillsborough files may be opened |work=BBC News |date=19 April 2009 |accessdate=19 April 2009 |location=London[/tpl]
On 8 March 2011 the Hillsborough Independent Panel announced it would examine previously hidden documents to determine what took place after the 3:15 pm cutoff imposed during the inquest in 1991.

===Prosecution===

A private prosecution was brought against Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and another officer, Bernard Murray. Prosecutor Alun Jones QC[tpl]cite web |url=http://greatjames.co.uk/members |title= Members Great James Street |publisher=Greatjames.co.uk |accessdate=26 November 2011[/tpl] told the court that Duckenfield gave the order to open the gates so that hundreds of fans could be herded on to the already crowded terraces at the stadium. Mr Jones stated that minutes after the disaster,  "deceitfully and dishonestly" told senior FA officials that the supporters had forced the gate open. Duckenfield admitted he had lied in certain statements regarding the causes of the disaster. Other officers, including Norman Bettison, were accused of manipulating evidence. Bettison was later appointed Chief Constable of Merseyside in controversial circumstances. The prosecution ended on 24 July 2000, when Murray was acquitted and the jury was unable to reach a verdict in the case of Duckenfield. On 26 July 2000, the judge refused the prosecution's application for a re-trial of Duckenfield.
Police disciplinary charges were abandoned when Duckenfield retired on health grounds and because he was unavailable, it was decided it would be unfair to proceed with disciplinary charges against Bernard Murray. Duckenfield took medical retirement on a full police pension.[tpl]Cite news |title=Straw backs Hillsborough officer|publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/209499.stm |date=6 November 1998 |accessdate=11 September 2006 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |title=Hillsborough police 'blamed fans'|publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/788990.stm|date=13 June 2000|accessdate=11 September 2006 |location=London[/tpl]
On 19 December 2012, Attorney General Dominic Grieve made an application to the high court following the findings laid out in the report by the Hillsborough Panel. The decision set out by Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge quashed the original inquest verdicts.[tpl]cite news|title=Hillsborough inquest verdicts quashed by High Court|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-20772416|work=BBC News Online|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=19 December 2012[/tpl] The ruling came after revelations from the Hillsborough panel's findings showed police and emergency services had made "strenuous attempts" to deflect the blame for the disaster on to the fans which included alteration of more than 160 police statements where 116 of them were so altered with the intent to remove or change negative comments about the policing of the match 

In the wake of the decision the Home Secretary, Theresa May has announced that a new police enquiry,[tpl]cite news|last=Doyle|first=Mario Ledwith, Jack,|title=Fresh hopes for prosecutions over Hillsborough Disaster as police launch new investigation and High Court quashes accidental death inquest verdicts on 96 fans|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2250534/Police-launch-new-investigation-Hillsborough-Disaster-High-Court-quashes-accidental-death-inquest-verdicts-96-fans.html|publisher=Daily Mail Online|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=19 December 2012[/tpl] would be initiated to examine the possibility of charging agencies other than the police over the deaths of the 96 Liverpool fans who lost their lives at Hillsborough. The enquiry was headed by Former Durham Chief Constable Jon Stoddart.

===Psychiatric injury and other litigation===

Various negligence cases were brought against the police by spectators who had been at the ground but had not been in the pens, and by people who watched the incident unfolding on television (or heard about it on the radio). A case, Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police 1992 1 A.C. 310, was eventually appealed to the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords and was an important milestone in the law of claims of secondary victims for negligently inflicted psychiatric injury. It was held that claimants who watched the disaster on television/listened on radio were not 'proximal' and their claims were rejected.
Another psychiatric injury claim was brought to the House of Lords, White v Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police 1999 2 A.C. 455. It was brought by police officers on duty against the Chief Constable who was said to have been vicariously liable for the disaster. Their claims were dismissed and the Alcock decision was upheld. It affirmed the position of the courts once again towards claims of psychiatric injuries of secondary victims.
A third legal case which resulted from the Hillsborough disaster was Airedale N.H.S. Trust v Bland  1993 A.C. 789, a landmark House of Lords decision in English criminal law, that allowed the life-support machine of Tony Bland, a Hillsborough victim in a persistent vegetative state, to be switched off.

==Controversies==

===The Sun===

On 19 April, four days after the disaster, Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, a British red-top tabloid newspaper with national distribution owned by Rupert Murdoch, used "THE TRUTH" as the front page headline, followed by three sub-headlines: "Some fans picked pockets of victims", "Some fans urinated on the brave cops" and "Some fans beat up PC giving kiss of life".
The newspaper cited the words of unnamed police officers and Conservative MP for Sheffield Hallam Irvine Patnick for information relating to the alleged incidents.[tpl]cite news |first=Owen |last=Gibson |first2=Helen |last2=Carter |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/apr/18/hillsborough-anniversary-sun-newspaper |title=Hillsborough: 20 years on, Liverpool has still not forgiven the newspaper it calls 'The Scum' |work=The Guardian |date=18 April 2009|accessdate=26 November 2011 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title=Hillsborough report: Prime Minister David Cameron's statement in full|work=The Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9538391/Hillsborough-report-Prime-Minister-David-Camerons-statement-in-full.html|accessdate=12 September 2012|date=12 September 2012|location=London[/tpl] The Daily Express also carried Patnick's version, under the headline "Police Accuse Drunken Fans" and giving Patnick's views, saying he had told Margaret Thatcher, while escorting her on a tour of the ground after the disaster, of the "mayhem caused by drunks" and that policemen told him they were "hampered, harassed, punched and kicked".[tpl]cite news|url=http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/docs/PRE000000560001.pdf|title=Police Accuse Drunken Fans|work=Daily Express|date=19 April 1989|accessdate=12 September 2012|publisher=Northern & Shell|location=London|format=PDF[/tpl]
The story accompanying the Sun headlines claimed "drunken Liverpool fans viciously attacked rescue workers as they tried to revive victims" and "police officers, firemen and ambulance crew were punched, kicked and urinated upon". A quotation, attributed to an unnamed policeman, claimed a dead girl had been "abused", and that Liverpool fans were "openly urinating on us and the bodies of the dead".[tpl]cite news |first=Owen |last=Gibson |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/jul/07/pressandpublishing.football1 |title=What the Sun said 15 years ago |work=The Guardian |date=7 July 2004 |accessdate=26 November 2011 |location=London[/tpl] These allegations contradicted the behaviour of many Liverpool fans, who helped security personnel stretcher away a large number of victims and gave first aid to many of the injured.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p00hpfqh/Witness_Boycott_of_The_Sun_newspaper/ |title=Witness: Boycott of The Sun newspaper |publisher=BBC |accessdate=26 November 2011[/tpl]
In their history of The Sun, Peter Chippendale and Chris Horrie wrote: As MacKenzie's layout was seen by more and more people, a collective shudder ran through the office (but) MacKenzie's dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. (Everyone in the office) seemed paralysed—"looking like rabbits in the headlights"—as one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. It obviously wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it—they just took one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at the enormity of it. It was a 'classic smear'. 
After The Suns report, the newspaper was boycotted by most newsagents in Liverpool and many readers cancelled orders and refused to buy it from newsagents. The Hillsborough Justice Campaign organised a less successful national boycott that had some impact on the paper's sales, which some commentators considered a reason for continued price cuts, the introduction of free magazines, and video and free DVD offers.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2006/oct/29/whyisthesuncuttingitspri|title=Why is The Sun cutting its price |work=The Guardian |first=Roy |last=Greenslade |date=29 October 2006 |accessdate=25 March 2010 |location=London[/tpl] The issue was  addressed on the documentary Alexei Sayle's Liverpool on BBC Two[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.liverpool.com/capital-of-culture/alexi-sayle-s-liverpool.html |title=, What's Hot , Capital Of Culture , ALEXI SAYLE'S LIVERPOOL |publisher=Liverpool.com |accessdate=7 May 2011[/tpl] when it covered the subject of Hillsborough. The segment saw comedian Alexei Sayle with a newsagent attempting to give away copies of The Sun, but every customer declined. Eventually, Sayle and the newsagent took the copies outside and set them alight.
MacKenzie explained his actions in 1993. Talking to a House of Commons National Heritage Select Committee, he said: "I regret Hillsborough. It was a fundamental mistake. The mistake was I believed what an MP said. It was a Tory MP. If he had not said it and the Chief Superintendent  had not agreed with it, we would not have gone with it."
MacKenzie repudiated the apology in November 2006, saying he apologised because the newspaper's owner, Rupert Murdoch, had ordered him to do so, stating: "I was not sorry then and I'm not sorry now".[tpl]cite news |url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/tm_headline=ex-sun-editor--i-was-right-on-hillsborough&method=full&objectid=18190784&siteid=50061-name_page.html |title=Ex-Sun editor: I was right on Hillsborough |accessdate=1 December 2006 |last=Lister |first=Sam |work=Liverpool Daily Post |publisher=Liverpool Daily Post and Echo[/tpl] MacKenzie refused to apologise when appearing on the BBC's topical Question Time on 11 January 2007.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/jan/12/broadcasting.pressandpublishing |title=MacKenzie speaks out on Hillsborough comments |accessdate=25 March 2010 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |first=Tara |last=Conlan |date=12 January 2007[/tpl]
The Sun apologised for its treatment of the Hillsborough disaster "without reservation" in a full page opinion piece on 7 July 2004, saying it had "committed the most terrible mistake in its history" by publishing it. The newspaper apologised in response to criticism of Wayne Rooney, a Liverpool-born footballer who then played for Everton, who had sold his life story to the newspaper. Rooney's actions incensed Liverpudlians still angry with the newspaper whose apology was somewhat bullish, saying the "campaign of hate" against Rooney was organised in part by the Liverpool Daily Post & Echo, owned by Trinity Mirror—arch-rivals of The Sun. The apology angered some Liverpudlians further. The Liverpool Echo did not accept the apology, calling it "shabby" and "an attempt, once again, to exploit the Hillsborough dead".
On 6 January 2007, during Liverpool's FA Cup match at Anfield, fans in the Kop held up coloured cards spelling out "The Truth" and chanted "Justice for the 96" for six minutes at the start of the game. The protest was directed at Kelvin MacKenzie, The Sun, and the BBC for employing MacKenzie.
The controversy was referred to at the 2009 Labour Party conference. On 30 September 2009, after the decision by The Sun to switch support to the Conservative Party in advance of the 2010 general election, Union Leader Tony Woodley ripped up a copy saying "In Liverpool we learnt a long time ago what to do."[tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8282535.stm?ls |work=BBC News |title=Harman turns fire on Sun decision |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=2 April 2010[/tpl]
Subsequent articles in The Sun have said hooliganism was not a cause of the disaster; on the 20th anniversary an article by journalist Mike Ellis condemned the 1991 inquest verdict of death by misadventure as "tosh" and claimed that "death by negligence would have been a more accurate description".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/2376951/It-was-a-tragic-waste-of-life.html |location=London |work=The Sun |title=It was a tragic waste of life |date=14 April 2009[/tpl]
Others in the media pinned the blame partly on Liverpool fans, including the Daily Star, which ran the front page headline "Dead Fans Robbed By Drunk Thugs" on 18 April 1989.

===Edward Pearce===

Edward Pearce was criticised for writing a controversial article in the aftermath of the disaster, at a time when a number of victims' funerals were taking place. His article in The Sunday Times on 23 April 1989, included the text:
 
 "For the second time in half a decade a large body of Liverpool supporters has killed people ...the shrine in the Anfield goalmouth, the cursing of the police, all the theatricals, come sweetly to a city which is already the world capital of self-pity. There are soapy politicians to make a pet of Liverpool, and Liverpool itself is always standing by to make a pet of itself. 'Why us? Why are we treated like animals?' To which the plain answer is that a good and sufficient minority of you behave like animals."Sunday Times, 23 April 1989

Pearce went on reflect that if South Yorkshire Police bore any responsibility, it was "for not realising what brutes they had to handle."

Professor Phil Scraton described Pearce's comments as amongst the "most bigoted and factually inaccurate" published in the wake of the disaster"No Last Rites:The Denial of Justice and The Promotion of Myth in The Aftermath of The Hillsborough Disaster;" Scraton et al, 1995 A number of complaints were made to the Press Council concerning the article, but the Council ruled that it was unable to adjudicate on comment pieces, though the Council noted that tragedy or disaster is not an occasion for writers to exercise gratuitous provocation."Hillsborough Inquiry" Press Commission, 30 July 1989 Pearce has never apologised for the article.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]

===FHM===

The November 2002 edition of FHM in Australia was withdrawn from sale and a public apology made in the Australian and British editions, because it contained jokes mocking the disaster.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/161663/FHM-Australia-pulled-Hillsborough-comments/ |title=FHM Australia pulled after Hillsborough comments |publisher=Brand Republic |date=22 October 2002 |accessdate=7 May 2011[/tpl] As a result, Emap Australia pledged to make a donation to the families of the victims. Its Australian editor, Geoff Campbell, released a statement: "We deeply regret the photograph captions published in the November issue of the Australian edition of FHM, accompanying an article about the Hillsborough disaster of 1989. The right course of action is to withdraw this edition from sale – which we will be doing. We have been in contact with the Hillsborough Family Support Group and the Hillsborough Justice Campaign to express our deep regret and sincere apologies." The British edition disassociated itself from the controversy, stating: "FHM Australia has its own editorial team and these captions were written and published without consultation with the UK edition, or any other edition of FHM."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=21703&sectioncode=1 |title=FHM faces a boycott after Hillsborough 'joke' |work=Press Gazette |date=25 October 2002 |accessdate=7 May 2011[/tpl]
The vice-chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Philip Hammond, said he wanted all football fans to boycott the magazine, saying, "I am going to write to every fanzine in the country – including Liverpool F.C.'s – telling them to ban FHM. People are very upset by it. I think there will be a real boycott." He added it would be like making jokes about the 2002 Bali bombings, in which eight fewer Australians were killed.

===EastEnders===

In November 2007, the BBC soap opera EastEnders caused controversy when the character Minty Peterson (played by Cliff Parisi) made a reference to the disaster. During the episode car mechanic Minty said: "Five years out of Europe because of Heysel, because they penned you lot in to stop you fighting on the pitch and then what did we end up with? Hillsborough." This prompted 380 complaints and the BBC apologised, saying that the character was simply reminding another character, former football hooligan Jase Dyer, that the actions of hooligans led to the fencing-in of football fans. Ofcom also received 177 complaints.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/nov/16/bbc.television1 |title=EastEnders attracts 1,000 complaints |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=16 November 2007 |accessdate=18 November 2007 |first=Caitlin |last=Fitzsimmons[/tpl]

===Charles Itandje===

Liverpool reserve goalkeeper Charles Itandje was accused of having shown disrespect towards the Hillsborough victims during the 2009 remembrance ceremony, as he was spotted on camera "smiling and nudging" team-mate Damien Plessis. He was suspended from the club for a fortnight and many fans felt he should not play for the club again. He was omitted from the first team squad and never played for the club in any capacity again.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/8005039.stm |title=Club probes Hillsborough 'insult' |work=BBC News |date=18 April 2009 |accessdate=19 April 2009 |location=London[/tpl]

===Jeremy Hunt===

On 28 June 2010, following England's departure from the World Cup competition in South Africa, the UK's Culture and Sport Secretary Jeremy Hunt praised the England fans for their behaviour during the competition, saying "I mean, not a single arrest for a football-related offence, and the terrible problems that we had in Heysel and Hillsborough in the 1980s seem now to be behind us." He later apologised and said "I know that fan unrest played no part in the terrible events of April 1989 and I apologise to Liverpool fans and the families of those killed and injured in the Hillsborough disaster if my comments caused any offence." Margaret Aspinall, chairperson of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, asked for a face to face meeting with Mr Hunt before deciding if she would accept the apology.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/10434714.stm |work=BBC News |title=Apology over Hillsborough claims |date=28 June 2010[/tpl]
On 22 October 2012, Jeremy Hunt who is currently the British Parliament's Secretary of State for Health concluded the Hillsborough Debate in parliament by again apologising for his previous comments in connection to Hillsborough and reiterated that the Liverpool fans were innocent. He also apologised on behalf of the NHS (National Health Service) for the errors made on the day itself and for the involvement of South Yorkshire Ambulance Service and their part in the subsequent cover up including the changing of statements which is now subject to criminal investigation in the UK.

===Alan Davies podcast comments===

In April 2012, comedian Alan Davies was accused of showing disrespect towards the Hillsborough victims due to comments made in an episode of his comedy Arsenal podcast, The Tuesday Club. Commenting on the fact that Chelsea had to play their FA Cup semi final game only 3 days before their UEFA Champions League semi final first leg game against FC Barcelona due to Liverpool's refusal to play on 15 April, Davies said "Liverpool and the 15th – that gets on my tits, that shit... Hillsborough is one of the worst tragedies in English peacetime history, I understand that. But it's ridiculous that they refuse to play on that day any more." He has since apologised for the remark.

===Fans' chants===

Following the findings of the Independent Panel in September 2012, Alex Ferguson and two Manchester United fan groups called for an end to the "sick chants".Manchester United fan groups want to end sick chants, BBC, 20 September 2012 Leeds United chairman Ken Bates endorsed this call in the club programme and stated, "Leeds have suffered at times with reference to Galatasaray; some of our so-called fans have also been guilty as well, particularly in relation to Munich."[tpl]cite journal|title=|journal=Leeds United v Hull City official matchday programme|publisher=Leeds United A.F.C.|first=Ken|last=Bates|authorlink=Ken Bates|date=18 September 2012|page=5[/tpl]

===Oliver Popplewell===

In October 2011, Sir Oliver Popplewell, who chaired the public inquiry into the 1985 Bradford City stadium fire at Valley Parade that killed 56 people, called on the families of the Hillsborough victims to look at the "quiet dignity and great courage relatives in the West Yorkshire city had shown in the years following the tragedy". He said: "The citizens of Bradford behaved with quiet dignity and great courage. They did not harbour conspiracy theories. They did not seek endless further inquiries. They buried their dead, comforted the bereaved and succoured the injured. They organised a sensible compensation scheme and moved on. Is there, perhaps, a lesson there for the Hillsborough campaigners?"[tpl]cite news|title=Hillsborough disaster: Sir Oliver Popplewell outrages campaigners with comments|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/8835870/Hillsborough-disaster-Sir-Oliver-Popplewell-outrages-campaigners-with-comments.html|date=19 October 2011|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=31 October 2012|first=Matthew|last=Holehouse[/tpl]
Popplewell was widely criticised for the comments, including a rebuke from a survivor of the Bradford fire. Labour MP Steve Rotheram, for example, commented: "How insensitive does somebody have to be to write that load of drivel?"[tpl]cite news|title=Former judge tells Hillsborough families to drop 'conspiracy theories'|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/oct/19/judge-hillsborough-families-conspiracy-theories|work=The Guardian|date=19 October 2011 |agency=Press Association|accessdate=2 November 2012[/tpl]
Sir Oliver has not commented on the matter since the findings of the Hillsborough Independent Panel.

===David Crompton===

A formal complaint has been made against David Crompton, South Yorkshire's chief constable over internal emails relating to the Hillsborough disaster. In 2013, David Crompton sent an email in which he said the families' "version of certain events has become 'the truth' even though it isn't". In September, David Crompton had emailed the force's assistant chief constable Andy Holt and head of media Mark Thompson on 8 September, just four days before the Hillsborough Independent Panel Report was published. The email came to light as the result of a Freedom of Information request. South Yorkshire's police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright has appointed chief constable Simon Parr of Cambridgeshire Constabulary to head the investigation. Wright said: "The request has been submitted by a firm of solicitors in Liverpool acting on behalf of a number of individuals affected by the event."[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-22910241 |work=BBC News |title=Hillsborough disaster: Probe into South Yorkshire police email |date=14 June 2013[/tpl]

==Dramatisations and documentaries==

A television drama film, based on the disaster and subsequent events, titled simply Hillsborough, was produced by Granada Television. It was highly praised and won the BAFTA Award for Best Single Drama in 1997. Christopher Eccleston, Ricky Tomlinson and Mark Womack were among the leading actors appearing in the film. It was aired for the first time in 1996, and has been aired three times since then, in 1998, 2009 and again in September 2012 on the weekend following the release of the findings of the Hillsborough Independent Panel.
The American sports network ESPN, as part of its 30 for 30 series of sports films (under a new "Soccer Stories" subdivision), aired the documentary Hillsborough as a co-production with the BBC. Directed by Daniel Gordon, the 2-hour film chronicles the disaster, the investigations, and their lingering effects; it also included interviews with survivors, victims' relatives, police officers and investigators. Hillsborough aired the first time on 15 April 2014, the 25th anniversary of the disaster.Web page for 30 for 30: Hillsborough"When a game turned into a disaster," from The New York Times, 14 April 2014 The documentary is currently unable to be shown in Great Britain due to the 2012 High Court inquest still being in progress and the UK's jury tampering laws; the documentary contains previously unreleased security camera footage from the stadium the day of the disaster.[tpl]cite web|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2014/espns-hillsborough-documentary-cant-be-aired-in-the-united-kingdom-thanks-to-british-laws.html|title=ESPN’s Hillsborough documentary can’t be aired in the United Kingdom thanks to British laws|last=Buchholz|first=Andrew|date=15 April 2014|work=Awful Announcing, Bloguin|accessdate=21 April 2014[/tpl]
