[[Turán's inequalities]]

CATEGORIES: Orthogonal polynomials, Inequalities

In mathematics, Turán's inequalities are some inequalities for Legendre polynomials found by [tpl]harvs|txt=yes|first=Paul |last=Turán|authorlink=Paul Turán|year=1950[/tpl] (and first published by [tpl]harvtxt|Szegö|1948[/tpl]). There are many generalizations to other polynomials, often called Turán's inequalities, given by 
  and other authors.
If Pn is the nth Legendre polynomial, Turán's inequalities state that
For Hn, the nth Hermite polynomial, Turán's inequality is
and for Chebyshev polynomials it is
