==Controversies==

There was much controversy from Lagerfeld's use of a verse from the Qur'an in his spring 1994 couture collection for Chanel, despite apologies from the designer and the fashion house. The controversy erupted after the 1994 couture show in Paris, when the Indonesian Muslim Scholars Council in Jakarta called for a boycott of Chanel and threatened to file formal protests with the government of Mr. Lagerfeld's homeland, Germany. The designer apologized, explaining that he had taken the design from a book about the Taj Mahal, thinking the words came from a love poem.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/25/style/chronicle-979180.html |title=Style – Chronicle |first=Nadine |last=Brozan |newspaper=The New York Times |date=25 January 1994 |accessdate=8 September 2011[/tpl]
Lagerfeld was the target of a pieing by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in 2001 at a fashion premiere at Lincoln Center in New York City. The tofu pies hurled by animal rights activists in protest of his use of fur within his collections, however went astray and hit Calvin Klein. A PETA spokesperson described the hit on Klein as "friendly fire," calling Klein, who doesn't use fur, "a great friend to the animals" and Lagerfeld a "designer dinosaur," who continues to use fur in his collections.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/06/15/entertainment/main296799.shtml |title=Calvin Klein Pie-Faced |publisher=CBS news |date=11 February 2009 |accessdate=8 September 2011[/tpl]
Lagerfeld is attempting to defend the fur industry and the use of fur in fashion. He himself doesn't wear fur and hardly eats meat. In a BBC interview in 2009, he claimed that hunters "make a living having learnt nothing else than hunting, killing those beasts who would kill us if they could" and maintained: "In a meat-eating world, wearing leather for shoes and clothes and even handbags, the discussion of fur is childish." Spokespersons for PETA called Lagerfeld "a fashion dinosaur who is as out of step as his furs are out of style."[tpl]cite news| url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG4075783/Karl-Lagerfeld-defends-fur-industry-saying-beasts-would-kill-us-if-we-didnt-kill-them.html|newspaper=The Telegraph| title=Karl Lagerfeld defends fur industry saying 'beasts' would kill us if we didn't kill them| first=Stephen|last= Adams| date=2 January 2009| accessdate=8 September 2011| location=London[/tpl] and "particularly delusional with his kill-or-be-killed mentality.

In 2010, PETA cites Lagerfeld, who used fake fur in his 2010 Chanel collection, on its website as saying: "It's the triumph of fake fur… because fake fur changed so much and became so great now that you can hardly see a difference."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2010/03/10/Karl-Lagerfelds-Triumph-of-Fake-Fur.aspx| publisher=PETA| title=Karl Lagerfeld's 'Triumph of Fake Fur'| date=10 March 2010|accessdate=8 September 2011[/tpl]

Lagerfeld created an international furore on 9 February 2012, when he called the singer Adele "a little too fat."[tpl]cite web|title=Karl Lagerfeld on Adele, the Greek crisis and M.I.A.’s middle finger (UPDATED)|url=http://www.metro.us/newyork/news/international/2012/02/06/karl-lagerfeld-on-adele-the-greek-crisis-and-m-i-a-s-middle-finger-updated/|publisher=Metro[/tpl] This caused instant fury throughout the United Kingdom, and Lagerfeld responded with a statement of apology. Adele hit back by saying she is like the majority of women, and she is very proud of that fact.[tpl]cite news|title=Adele hits back at Lagerfeld's 'too fat' comment |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20120208/karl-lagerfeld-apologizes-for-calling-adele-fat-120208/|accessdate=20 February 2012|newspaper=CTV News[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=What right does Karl Lagerfeld have to criticise Adele's weight?|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/chat/t-10242673/index.html|accessdate=20 February 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|location=London|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] Lagerfeld later caused another controversy, on 31 July 2012, when he criticized Pippa Middleton, sister of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, for her looks. The comment was made when Lagerfeld was praising Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, for her "romantic beauty" before adding: "I don't like the sister's face. She should only show her back."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2181760/Karl-Lagerfeld-I-dont-like-Pippa-Middletons-face-back.html | work=Daily Mail | first=Sarah | last=Fitzmaurice | title='I don't like her face.

==Weight loss==

When Lagerfeld lost 42 kg (about 92.6 lbs.) in 13 months in 2001, he explained: "I suddenly wanted to dress differently, to wear clothes designed by Hedi Slimane.... But these fashions, modeled by very, very slim boys—and not men my age—required me to lose at least 40kg. It took me exactly 13 months." The diet was created specially for Lagerfeld by Dr. Jean-Claude Houdret, which led to a book called The Karl Lagerfeld Diet, which he promoted on Larry King Live and other TV shows.

==Personal life==

Lagerfeld owns a mansion in Paris and a Persian cat named Choupette,  which, on 1 June 2013, he indicated he would marry, were it legal.[tpl]cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/bestoftv/2013/05/06/fbs-karl-lagerfeld-on-beloved-companion-promo-sot.cnn | work=CNN | title=Video - Breaking News Videos from CNN.com[/tpl]
