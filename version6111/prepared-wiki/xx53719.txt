The Jersey Devil is a legendary creature or cryptid said to inhabit the Pine Barrens of Southern New Jersey, United States. The creature is often described as a flying biped with hooves, but there are many different variations. The common description is that of a kangaroo-like creature with the head of a goat, leathery bat-like wings, horns, small arms with clawed hands, cloven hooves and a forked tail. It has been reported to move quickly and often is described as emitting a "blood-curdling scream."The Jersey Devil, by James F. McCloy and Ray Miller, Jr., Middle Atlantic Press.

The Jersey Devil has worked its way into the pop culture of the area, lending its name to New Jersey's team in the National Hockey League, and appeared on an early episode of The X-Files.

==Origin of the legend==

There are many possible origins of the Jersey Devil legend. The earliest legends date back to Native American folklore. The Lenni Lenape tribes called the area around Pine Barrens "Popuessing", meaning "place of the dragon".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art57572.asp |title=The Jersey Devil - Paranormal |publisher=Bellaonline.com |accessdate=2014-01-04[/tpl] Swedish explorers later named it "Drake Kill", "drake" being a word for dragon, and "kill" meaning channel or arm of the sea (river, stream, etc.) in Dutch.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vernonkids.com/cedarmountain/4thgradelinks/jerseydevil/jerseydevil.htm |title=devil |publisher=Vernonkids.com |accessdate=2014-01-04[/tpl]
The common accepted origin of the story, as far as New Jersey people are concerned, started with Mother Leeds and is as follows:
"Mother Leeds" has been identified by some as Deborah Leeds.Mallowe, Mike, "The Enduring Reign Of The Jersey Devil" The Bulletin (Philadelphia), October 30, 2008 This identification may have gained credence from the fact that Deborah Leeds' husband, Japhet Leeds, named twelve children in the will he wrote in 1736,Documents Relating to the Colonial History of the State Of New Jersey, 1st Ser., Vol. XXX Ed. A. Van Doren Honeyman, (Union-Gazette, Somerville, N.J.)1918. which is compatible with the legend of the Jersey Devil being the thirteenth child born by Mother Leeds. Deborah and Japhet Leeds also lived in the Leeds Point section of what is now Atlantic County, New Jersey,Rundstrom, Olive Conover, "Daniel Leeds and his Descendants", Atlantic County Historical Society Year Book, vol. 6, no. 4, p. 156 (1971) which is the area commonly said to be the location of the Jersey Devil story.

===Sightings of 1909===

During the week of January 16 through 23, 1909, newspapers of the time published hundreds of claimed encounters with the Jersey Devil from all over the state. Among alleged encounters publicized that week were claims the creature "attacked" a trolley car in Haddon Heights and a social club in Camden.Moran, Mark and Sceurman, Mark (2004). Weird N.J.: Your Travel Guide to New Jersey's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets. Barnes & Noble. PP. 104-5. Police in Camden and Bristol, Pennsylvania supposedly fired on the creature to no effect.Moran and Sceurman(2004). P. 105. Other reports initially concerned unidentified footprints in the snow, but soon sightings of creatures resembling the Jersey Devil were being reported throughout South Jersey and as far away as Delaware.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jerseyhistory.org/legend_jerseydevil.html |title=The New Jersey Historical Society |publisher=Jerseyhistory.org |date=2000-10-26 |accessdate=2014-01-04[/tpl]  The widespread newspaper coverage led to a panic throughout the Delaware Valley prompting a number of schools to close and workers to stay home. During this period, it is rumored that the Philadelphia Zoo posted a $10,000 reward for the creature's dung. The offer prompted a variety of hoaxes, including a kangaroo with artificial wings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefixsite.com/jerseydevil/jdlegend.html |title=The Jersey Devil Legend |publisher=Thefixsite.com |accessdate=2014-01-04[/tpl]

==Explanations==

Skeptics believe the Jersey Devil to be nothing more than a creative manifestation of the English settlers, Bogeyman stories created and told by bored Pine Barren residents as a form of children's entertainment, and rumors arising from negative perceptions of the local population ("pineys"). According to Brian Dunning of Skeptoid, folk tales of the Jersey Devil prior to 1909 calling it the "Leeds Devil" may have been created to discredit local politician Daniel Leeds who served as deputy to the colonial governor of New York and New Jersey in the 1700s.[tpl]cite web|last=Dunning|first=Brian|title=The Jersey Devil|url=http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4282|work=Skeptoid #282 November 01, 2011|publisher=Skeptoid.com|accessdate=26 January 2012[/tpl] Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand wrote that the spread of contemporary pop culture has overtaken traditional Jersey Devil legends.[tpl]cite book|last=Brunvand|first=Jan Harold|title=American folklore|year=1998|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-8153-3350-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=l0N_sedAATAC&pg=PA408&dq=1909+jersey+devil+Brunvand#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] Jeff Brunner of the Humane Society of New Jersey thinks the Sandhill Crane is the basis of the Jersey Devil stories, adding, "There are no photographs, no bones, no hard evidence whatsoever, and worst of all, no explanation of its origins that doesn't require belief in the supernatural."[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.citypaper.net/articles/102397/cover.jerseydevil.shtml |title=The Devil Went Down To Jersey |publisher=Archives.citypaper.net |accessdate=2014-01-04[/tpl] Outdoorsman and author Tom Brown, Jr. spent several seasons living in the wilderness of the Pine Barrens. He recounts occasions when terrified hikers mistook him for the Jersey Devil, after he covered his whole body with mud to repel mosquitoes.
One New Jersey group called the "Devil Hunters" refer to themselves as â€œofficial researchers of the Jersey Devil", and devote time to collecting reports, visiting historic sites, and going on nocturnal hunts in the Pine Barrens in order to "find proof that the Jersey Devil does in fact exist."[tpl]cite news|last=Barry|first=Dan|title=THIS LAND; In the Wilds of New Jersey, a Legend Inspires a Hunt|work=The New York Times|page=14|date=8 September 2008|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/us/08land.html[/tpl]
