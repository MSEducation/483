6C RNA is a class of non-coding RNA present in actinomycetes.  6C RNA was originally discovered as a conserved RNA structure having two stem-loops each containing six or more cytosine (C) residues.[tpl]cite journal |author=Weinberg Z, Barrick JE, Yao Z, et al. |title=Identification of 22 candidate structured RNAs in bacteria using the CMfinder comparative genomics pipeline |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=35 |issue=14 |pages=4809–19 |year=2007 |pmid=17621584 |pmc=1950547 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkm487 |url=[/tpl]  Later work revealed that 6C RNAs in Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces avermitilis have predicted rho-independent transcription terminators, and microarray and reverse-transcriptase PCR experiments indicate that the S. coelicolor version is transcribed as RNA.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pánek J, Bobek J, Mikulík K, Basler M, Vohradský J |title=Biocomputational prediction of small non-coding RNAs in Streptomyces |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=9|pages=217 |year=2008 |pmid=18477385 |pmc=2422843 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-9-217 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Swiercz JP, Hindra, Bobek J, et al. |title=Small non-coding RNAs in Streptomyces coelicolor |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume= 36|issue= 22|pages= 7240|date=November 2008 |pmid=19008244 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkn898 |url= |pmc=2602773[/tpl]  Transcription of the S. coelicolor RNA increases during sporulation, and three transcripts were detected that overlap the 6C motif, but have different apparent start and stop sites.
