[[Nuptse]]

CATEGORIES: Mountains of Nepal, Seven-thousanders

Nuptse is a mountain in the Khumbu region of the Mahalangur Himal, in the Nepalese Himalayas. It lies two kilometres WSW of Mount Everest. Nuptse is Tibetan for "west peak", as it is the western segment of the Lhotse-Nuptse massif. 
The long east-west trending main ridge of Nuptse is crowned by seven peaks:
 
 
The main peak, Nuptse I, was first climbed on May 16, 1961 by Dennis Davis and Sherpa Tashi, members of a British expedition. After a long hiatus, Nuptse again became the objective of high-standard mountaineers in the 1990s and 2000s, with important routes being put up on its west, south, and north faces.
While Nuptse is a dramatic peak when viewed from the south or west, and it towers above the base camp for the standard south col route on Everest, it is not a particularly independent peak: its topographic prominence is only [tpl]convert|319|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Hence it is not ranked on the list of highest mountains.
