The Kangaamiut dike swarm (old spelling: Kangâmiut) is a 2.04 billion year old dike swarm located in the Kangerlussuaq region of western Greenland.Mayborn, K.R. & Lesher, C.E. 2006: Origin and evolution of the Kangâmiut mafic dyke swarm, West Greenland. In: Garde, A.A. & Kalsbeek, F. (eds): Precambrian crustal evolution and Cretaceous-Palaeogene faulting in West Greenland. Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland Bulletin 11 , 61-86.  The dikes cut Archean orthogneisses and are exposed along approximately [tpl]convert|150|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of the coast and a similar distance up to the inland ice to the east, covering an area of about [tpl]convert|18000|km2|mi2|abbr=on[/tpl]. To the north it is bounded by the paleoproterozoic Ikertooq shear zone (old spelling: Ikertôq) while to the south the boundary is gradational with a gradual reduction in the density of dikes.
