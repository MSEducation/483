==Life==

Cole was born in London and educated at Sir Walter St. John's School, Battersea and Jesus College, Oxford.  He was a lecturer in zoology at Liverpool University from 1897 until 1906, when he became Professor of Zoology at Reading University, the first holder of the post.  He then began setting up the Cole Museum of Zoology, encouraging overseas visitors to the Department to donate specimens. He remained at Reading until retiring in 1939, but carried on writing in retirement.  He wrote in particular on comparative anatomy and the history of zoology, after his early work on the morphology of fish.  His works included a "History of Protozoology" (1926), "Early Theories of Sexual Generation" (1930) and a "History of Comparative Anatomy from Aristotle to the Eighteenth Century" (1944). He was elected in 1926 as a Fellow of the Royal Society, and won the Neill Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1908.[tpl]cite news|title=Professor F. J.
