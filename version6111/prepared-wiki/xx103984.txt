==Properties==

Eta Geminorum A is a spectroscopic binary.  The primary is a semiregular variable star of type SRA whose brightness changes with a period of 234 days between magnitude +3.15 and +3.9. It is located 350 light years from the Sun and is a red giant of the spectral type M3.  The secondary, probably a class B, orbits with a period of 8.2 years. Eta Geminorum B, a class G dwarf, orbits the pair with a period of at least 700 years.The Spectrographic Orbit and Light-Variations of η Geminorum, Dean B. McLaughlin and Suzanne E. A. van Dijke, Astrophysical Journal 100 (July 1944), pp. 63–68.,Eta Geminorum at Jim Kaler's STARS. 
Eta Geminorum is near the ecliptic, so it can be occulted by the Moon and, very rarely, by planets. The last occultation by a planet took place on July 27, 1910, by Venus, and the next to last on July 11, 1837, by Mercury.

==Namesakes==

USS Propus (AK-132) was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the star.
