[[Bit-string physics]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical physics, Quantum mechanics

Bit-string physics is an emerging body of theory which considers the universe to be a process of operations on strings of bits.  Bit-string physics is often associated with A.F. Parker-Rhodes' combinatorial hierarchy, which is notable for its relationship with the electromagnetic and gravitational coupling constants of quantum theory.Ted Bastin and C.W. Kilmister, Combinatorial Physics, World Scientific 1995, ISBN 981-02-2212-2  Other leading contributors in the field include H. Pierre Noyes, Ted Bastin, C.W. Kilmister, John Amson, and David McGoveran.[tpl]cite book |author= H. Pierre Noyes |editor= J.

Critics of bit-string physics challenge that the theory has yet to present experimentally testable predictions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl]  In a 2001 paper by Noyes, evidence was presented for predictions made by the theory that were later confirmed.[tpl]cite web |title= Observational Evidence for Two Cosmological Predictions Made by Bit-String Physics |work= Publication 8779 |date= March 23, 2001 |author= H.
