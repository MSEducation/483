Frederick Henry Marvell Blaydes (29 September 1818 – 7 September 1908) was an English cleric and classical scholar.

==Life==

He was born at Hampton Court Green. He was a descendant of Anne Blaides (née Marvell), the sister of Andrew Marvell, the satirist and friend of Milton.
He was educated at St Peter's School, York, and Christ Church, Oxford. He was Hertford scholar in 1838, took a second class in literae humaniores in 1840, and was subsequently elected to a studentship at Christ Church. In 1842 he took orders, and from 1843 to 1886 was vicar of Harringworth in Northamptonshire.
During a long life he devoted himself almost entirely to the study of the Greek dramatists. His editions and philological papers are remarkable for bold conjectural emendations of corrupt (and other) passages. His distinction was recognized by his being made an honorary LL.D. of Dublin, Ph.D. of the University of Budapest and a fellow of the royal society of letters at Athens. He died at Southsea on the 7th of September 1908.
