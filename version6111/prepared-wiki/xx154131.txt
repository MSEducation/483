==Playing career==

===St. Johnstone===

Connolly was born in Barrhead, Scotland. He began his football career as a junior with Glasgow United before turning professional with St. Johnstone in January 1968.[tpl]cite book |author=Matthews, Tony |title=Birmingham City: A Complete Record |year=1995 |publisher=Breedon Books |location=Derby |pages= 79 |isbn=978-1-85983-010-9[/tpl] He played in the 1969 Scottish League Cup final at Hampden Park against a Celtic side on their way to their second European Cup final in four seasons. Saints lost narrowly 1–0 with Connolly later commenting, "We gave them the fright of their lives". With Connolly, Saints plundered league wins at Ibrox Park and Celtic Park."The Queens" by Iain McCartney on Creedon Publications, 2004
John Connolly's only experience of playing European club football occurred while at St Johnstone after finishing third in Scotland's top division. St Johnstone knocked out Hamburger SV.
Nobby Clark in an interview named Connolly as the best player he ever played directly against.[tpl]cite web |url=http://qosfc.com/AboutQueens/QueensLegends/tabid/115/Default.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917025553/http://qosfc.com/AboutQueens/QueensLegends/tabid/115/Default.aspx |title=Queens Legends: Nobby Clark |author=McLean, Kirk |publisher=Queen of the South F.C |archivedate=17 September 2009[/tpl]

===Everton===

Everton manager Harry Catterick paid £75,000 to take Connolly to Goodison Park in March 1972. Such was Catterick's determination to conclude the signing that he forced himself off his sick bed.
While at Everton, Connolly earned a full international cap playing for Scotland against Switzerland in Bern. Connolly already had four under-23 caps.
Connolly twice had to come back from leg breaks. Catterick was replaced by Billy Bingham and the two did not see eye to eye. Eventually, Connolly asked for a transfer and signed for Birmingham City in September 1977 for a fee of £90,000.

===Later career===

Connolly spent two seasons with Birmingham, the second of which was disrupted by injury, before joining Newcastle United. He later played for Hibernian, Gateshead and Blyth Spartans, where he acted as player-manager.

==Managerial career==

===Queen of the South===

Connolly was appointed manager of Dumfries club Queen of the South in July 2000 and he in turn appointed Iain Scott as his assistant. With the captaincy of Jim Thomson and Andy Aitken another defensive mainstay, Connolly led the club to the Scottish Second Division title in 2002, clinched with a 3–0 win away to Forfar Athletic. This made Connolly the first manager to give Queens a national competition victory since Jimmy McKinnell, Jr. with the same competition in 1951."Club History" on the official Queen of the South website
The following season Connolly's Queens side won the Scottish Challenge Cup after defeating Brechin City 2–0 in the final at Clyde's Broadwood Stadium. Robbie Neilson and Andy Goram were among those lining up beside Thomson for Queens."UP FOR THE CUP" www.qosfc.com 7th November 2010
When Connolly left QoS Scott was promoted to replace him as Queens manager.

===St. Johnstone===

Connolly left Queens in May 2004 to replace Billy Stark as manager of former club St Johnstone, with his former assistant Iain Scott taking over at Queens. After a disappointing first season, Connolly was sacked from his position with St Johnstone on 4 April 2005,[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/st_johnstone/4408767.stm | work=BBC News | title=Connolly sacked by St Johnstone | date=4 April 2005 | accessdate=6 May 2010[/tpl] with the team finishing in 8th place and only avoiding relegation in the last few weeks of the season.
