[[Figure-eight loop]]

CATEGORIES: Climbing knots, Double knots

A figure-eight loop (also figure-eight on a bight or Flemish loop or Flemish eight) is a type of knot created by a loop on the bight. It is used in climbing and caving where rope strains are light to moderate and for decorative purposes. The knot is commonly followed by tying a strangle knot (AKA Half a Double Fisherman's Knot) or an overhand knot around the standing end.Mountaineering: Freedom of the Hills, 8th ed., p. 141
The double figure eight is used to put a loop in the end of a rope, or around an object. It is relatively easy to tie and is secure, but can become difficult to untie after heavy loading, and can jam badly in any rope type.

==Tying methods==

===Traditional===

A figure-eight loop is created by doubling the rope into a bight, then tying the standard figure-eight knot. 

===Follow Through===

Alternatively, to tie the knot directly around an object, the follow through method must be used.
