CATEGORIES: Italian songs, Counter-revolutionaries

La Vandeana ([tpl]lang-en|The Vendéen[/tpl]) is an Italian song focusing on the topic of the counter-revolution against the Jacobin's anticlerical republican system by Royalists and Catholics during the War in the Vendée in France. The folk song is popular in traditionalist circles and it was also used by intransigent radical right cultural organisation Ordine Nuovo as their group anthem. Various slightly different versions of the song have been recorded, including versions by Contea and Settimo Sigillo.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.antiwarsongs.org/canzone.php?lang=it&id=8729|publisher=AntiWarSongs.org|title=La Vandeana - Settimo Sigillo|date=18 October 2009[/tpl]
