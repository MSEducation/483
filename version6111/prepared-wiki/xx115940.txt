Live on the Other Side is Korn's second live DVD release. This DVD contains footage from band's first American show in 2005 that was played at Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City on November 29, 2005. It also includes documentary, backstage videos, and interviews. The first 70,000 copies of Live on the Other Side included a voucher that gave opportunity to be exchanged for two free lawn tickets for 2006 edition of Family Values Tour at the time that the voucher's owner would buy an additional pair of lawn tickets, according to tour promoter Live Nation. The title suggested that they would play many of the songs from the album See You on the Other Side, but ended up playing only four.
