Okaukuejo is the administrative center for the Etosha National Park in Namibia. It is approximately 650 km from the capital Windhoek. The place normally receives an annual average rainfall of around [tpl]convert|350|mm[/tpl], although in the 2010/2011 rainy season [tpl]convert|676|mm[/tpl] were measured.
Originally the site of a German fort built in 1901, Okaukuejo now houses the Etosha Ecological Institute, founded in 1974; the round watchtower is a remnant of the fort. A major draw for tourists is the permanent waterhole, illuminated at night, which draws all types of wildlife, including elephants, lions and black rhinoceros, particularly during the lengthy dry season.  
The Namibian National Park Service also maintains a tourist camp.  There is a variety of resort facilities from camping sites to housekeeping cottages with braai facilities.  There is also a large swimming pool, a large restaurant and bar.  There are two small stores.  One store sells basic foods and firewood for a braai.
