El Plan de Santa Bárbara: A Chicano Plan for Higher Education was written by the Chicano Coordinating Council on Higher Education as a manifesto for the implementation of Chicano Studies educational programs throughout the state of California.  The Plan was adopted in April 1969 at a symposium held at the University of California, Santa Barbara, USA.  
The 155-page document outlines proposals for a curriculum in Chicano Studies, the role of community control in Chicano education, and the necessity of Chicano political independence.  The document retains visibility as the founding document of the Chicano student group MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanow de Aztlán).
