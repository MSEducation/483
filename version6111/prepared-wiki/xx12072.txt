[[File:World Health Organisation regional offices.svg|thumb|Regional offices and regions of the WHO:
]]
The regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on article 44 of WHO's constitution, which allowed the WHA to "establish a single regional organization to meet the special needs of defined area". Many decisions are made at regional level, including importance discussions over WHO's budget, and in deciding the members of the next assembly, which are designated by the regions.Burci, Vignes (2004). pp. 53–57.
Each region has a Regional Committee, which generally meets once a year, normally in the autumn. Representatives attend from each member or associative member in each region, including those states that are not fully recognised. For example, Palestine attends meetings of the Eastern Mediterranean Regional office. Each region also has a regional office. Each Regional Office is headed by a Regional Director, who is elected by the Regional Committee. The Board must approve such appointments, although as of 2004, it had never overruled the preference of a regional committee. The exact role of the board in the process has been a subject of debate, but the practical effect has always been small. Since 1999, Regional Directors serve for a once-renewable five-year term.[tpl]cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA52/ew2.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=WHO |title=A year of change: Reports of the Executive Board on its 102nd and 103rd sessions |accessdate=11 February 2012[/tpl]
Each Regional Committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region. Aside from electing the Regional Director, the Regional Committee is also in charge of setting the guidelines for the implementation, within the region, of the health and other policies adopted by the World Health Assembly. The Regional Committee also serves as a progress review board for the actions of WHO within the Region.
The Regional Director is effectively the head of WHO for his or her Region. The RD manages and/or supervises a staff of health and other experts at the regional offices and in specialized centers. The RD is also the direct supervising authority—concomitantly with the WHO Director-General—of all the heads of WHO country offices, known as WHO Representatives, within the Region.

===Country and liaison offices===

The World Health Organization operates 147 country offices in all its regions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/about/structure/en/index.html |title=WHO – its people and offices |publisher=WHO |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=9 February 2012[/tpl] It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the European Union, United Nations and a single office covering the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. It also operates the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France, and the WHO Centre for Health Development in Kobe, Japan.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/about/who_offices/en/index.html |title=WHO liaison and other offices |publisher=WHO |accessdate=29 March 2012[/tpl] Additional offices include those in Pristina; the West Bank and Gaza; the US-Mexico Border Field Office in El Paso; the Office of the Caribbean Program Coordination in Barbados; and Northern Micronesia office.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/countryfocus/country_offices/details/en/index.html |title=Detailed information of WHO offices in countries, territories and areas |publisher=WHO |accessdate=29 March 2012[/tpl] There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question.
The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). [tpl]As of|2010[/tpl], the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ("Libya"); all other staff were international. Those in the Region for the Americas, they are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as Head of Country Office, and are nationals with the exception of Serbia; there are also Heads of Country Office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The WR is member of the UN system country team which is coordinated by the UN System Resident Coordinator.
The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff. The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/where-we-work/member-states/hungary/who-country-office |title=WHO Country Office (Hungary) |publisher=WHO EURO |accessdate=31 March 2012[/tpl]

===Financing and partnerships===

The WHO is financed by contributions from member states and outside donors. [tpl]As of|2012[/tpl], the largest annual assessed contributions from member states came from the United States ($110 million), Japan ($58 million), Germany ($37 million), United Kingdom ($31 million) and France ($31 million).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/about/resources_planning/2012_2013_AC_summary.pdf |title=Assessed Contributions payable by Member States and Associate Members – 2012–2013 |publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012[/tpl] The combined 2012–2013 budget has proposed a total expenditure of $3,959 million, of which $944 million (24%) will come from assessed contributions. This represented a significant fall in outlay compared to the previous 2009–2010 budget, adjusting to take account of previous underspends. Assessed contributions were kept the same. Voluntary contributions will account for $3,015 million (76%), of which $800 million is regarded as highly or moderately flexible funding, with the remainder tied to particular programmes or objectives.[tpl]cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf |title=Programme Budget, 2012–2013|publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012 |pages=10, 15–16[/tpl]

==Controversies==

===IAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40===

In 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The agreement states that the WHO recognises the IAEA as having responsibility for peaceful nuclear energy without prejudice to the roles of the WHO of promoting health. However, the following paragraph adds: "whenever either organization proposes to initiate a programme or activity on a subject in which the other organization has or may have a substantial interest, the first party shall consult the other with a view to adjusting the matter by mutual agreement".[tpl]cite web|last=World Health Organization|title=Agreements with Other Intergovernmental Organizations|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/agreements-with-other-inter-en.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=7 May 2012[/tpl] The nature of this statement has led some pressure groups and activists (including Women in Europe for a Common Future) to believe that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate the effects on human health of radiation caused by the use of nuclear power and the continuing effects of nuclear disasters in Chernobyl and Fukushima. They believe WHO must regain what they see as "independence".[tpl]cite web|last=Independence for WHO|title=Appeal by Health Professionals for Independence of the World Health Organization|url=http://www.ippnw-europe.org/commonFiles/pdfs/Atomenergie/appeal_healthprofessionals.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Women in Europe for a Common Future|title=Open letter on the WHO/IAEA Agreement of 1959|url=http://www.wecf.eu/download/2010/04/letterIAEA-WHO.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.activistmagazine.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=703 |title=World Health Organization [tpl]sic|Accom|odates|hide=y[/tpl] Atomic Agency |date=3 June 2007 |publisher=Activist Magazine |accessdate=27 March 2012[/tpl]

===Roman Catholic Church and AIDS===

In 2003, the WHO denounced the Roman Curia's health department's opposition to the use of condoms, saying: "These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20 million people, and currently affects at least 42 million."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/oct/09/aids |title=Vatican: condoms don't stop Aids |publisher=The Guardian |date=9 October 2003[/tpl] [tpl]As of|2009[/tpl], the Catholic Church remains opposed to increasing the use of contraception to combat HIV/AIDS.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/17/pope-africa-condoms-aids |title=Pope claims condoms could make African Aids crisis worse |publisher=The Guardian |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012[/tpl] At the time, the World Health Assembly President, Guyana's Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy, condemned Pope Benedict's opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to "create confusion" and "impede" proven strategies in the battle against the disease.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hsk4RI5cPLSsvXTY9ZEyWSMrVElg |title=World Health Assembly: Pope Benedict "wrong" |work=Google News|agency=Agence France-Presse |date=21 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012[/tpl]

===Intermittent preventive therapy===

The aggressive support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for intermittent preventive therapy of malaria triggered a memo from the former WHO malaria chief Akira Kochi.[tpl]cite web|last=McNeil |first=Donald G. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/16/science/16malaria.html |title=Gates Foundation's Influence Criticized |work=The New York Times |date=16 February 2008 |accessdate=9 February 2012[/tpl]

===Diet and sugar intake===

Some of the research undertaken or supported by WHO to determine how people's lifestyles and environments are influencing whether they live in better or worse health can be controversial, as illustrated by a 2003 joint WHO/FAO report on nutrition and the prevention of chronic non-communicable disease,Report of a Joint FAO/WHO Consultation. Diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2003 (WHO Technical Report Series 916). which recommended that sugar should form no more than 10% of a healthy diet. This report led to lobbying by the sugar industry against the recommendation, to which the WHO/FAO responded by including in the report the statement "The Consultation recognized that a population goal for free sugars of less than 10% of total energy is controversial", but also stood by its recommendation based upon its own analysis of scientific studies.[tpl]cite journal |first=Jim |last=Mann |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/81/8/editorial2.pdf |format=pdf |title=Sugar revisited – again |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |year=2003 |volume=81 |number=8[/tpl] In 2014, WHO reduced recommended sugar levels by half, saying that sugar should make up no more than 5% of a healthy diet.[tpl]cite web|title=BBC News: WHO: Daily sugar intake 'should be halved'|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/health-26449497[/tpl]

===2009 influenza pandemic===

In 2007, the WHO organized work on pandemic influenza vaccine development through clinical trials in collaboration with many experts. A pandemic involving the H1N1 influenza virus was declared by Director-General Margaret Chan in April 2009.
By the post-pandemic period critics claimed the WHO had exaggerated the danger, spreading "fear and confusion" rather than "immediate information".WHO admits errors in handling flu pandemic: Agency accused of overplaying danger of the virus as it swept the globe. Posted by msnbc.com Industry experts countered that the 2009 pandemic had led to "unprecedented collaboration between global health authorities, scientists and manufacturers, resulting in the most comprehensive pandemic response ever undertaken, with a number of vaccines approved for use three months after the pandemic declaration. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken in during the last decade".Abelina A et al. "Lessons from pandemic influenza A(H1N1): The research-based vaccine industry’s perspective." Vaccine 29 (2011) 1135–1138.

==World headquarters==

The seat of the organization is in Geneva, Switzerland. It was dedicated and opened in 1966.
