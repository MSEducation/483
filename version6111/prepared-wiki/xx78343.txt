</ref> There are stub-end tunnels east of the line's northern terminus, [[Jamaica Center – Parsons/Archer (New York City Subway)|Jamaica Center – Parsons/Archer]], on both levels, which extend past the station for possible future extensions.
The 63rd Street Lines are two lines also split among the BMT and IND. The short BMT line connects the express tracks of the BMT Broadway Line from 57th Street – Seventh Avenue to Lexington Avenue – 63rd Street, where it stub-ends. The IND line runs from the IND Sixth Avenue Line at 57th Street in Manhattan east under 63rd Street and the East River through the 63rd Street Tunnel to the IND Queens Boulevard Line in Queens. There are stub-end tunnels at the northern termini of each line; the BMT line has a stub end to the Second Avenue Subway while the IND line has a stub-end to the Queens super-express bypass.

===1998–99===

In 1998, an extension of the BMT Astoria Line to LaGuardia Airport was planned, but the plan was canceled in 2003 following community opposition.[tpl]cite news |last=Toscano |first=John |title=N Train Extension To LaG Scrapped |newspaper=Queens Gazette |date=July 16, 2003 |url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2003/0716/Front_Page/002.html |accessdate=2009-07-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2007-06-27/Features/Flashback_To_1999_001.html |title=Flashback To 1999 | www.qgazette.com | Queens Gazette |publisher=www.qgazette.com |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl]
In 1999, the Regional Plan Association considered a full-length Second Avenue Subway from Broad Street to 125th Street, along with the LIRR East Side Access. It also planned the following extensions:Metrolink
The new set of extensions proposed by the RPA, dubbed "MetroLink", would make use of existing commuter rail infrastructure, so as to make it interoperable with the New York City Subway. Nine hundred and fifty "Rx" hybrid railcars would be ordered, with yard expansions and new yards being built. MetroLink, consisting of 31 new metro stations (not counting three recycled commuter rail stations) and 19 new route miles of track (not including existing commuter rail and then-under construction AirTrain JFK route miles) would have reduced the load on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, the IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line, and the IND Queens Boulevard Line. Two of these stations would be in Brooklyn, three in Queens, nine in the Bronx, and twenty in Manhattan. Five services would be run:
The AirTrain JFK, Atlantic Branch, Main Line ROW, and Northeast Corridor would all be "recycled" to accommodate subway service under this plan. The Nostrand Avenue and East New York LIRR stations would also have been closed under MetroLink.

==21st-century expansion==

Since the 2000s, the New York City Subway has undergone its biggest expansion program since the late 1960s. There are least four stations under construction (five if the South Ferry station—built in 2009 but currently under reconstruction due to Hurricane Sandy—is counted) and up to 15 more subway stations definitively planned. The 21st-century expansion plan pales in comparison to some of the subway system's other previous plans, as well as to the ambitious expansion of the subway in the early 20th century.

===Current or completed plans===

====South Ferry====

In mid-2005, construction commenced on the new South Ferry – Whitehall Street station on the IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line, which is located underneath an older loop-platformed station of the same name in South Ferry, Manhattan. It is designed as an ADA-accessible, two-track terminal, which allows all ten cars of the train to platform and all doors to be opened, as opposed to only the first five cars in the old station.
Originally budgeted at $400 million, the new South Ferry station cost a total of $530 million, with most of the money being a grant from the Federal Transit Administration earmarked for World Trade Center reconstruction.At the Last Subway Stop, a New Exit Strategy, New York Times, December 11, 2008 In January 2009, the opening was delayed because the tracks were too far from the edge of the platform. The problem was corrected and the station opened on March 16, 2009.South Ferry Station To Open Next Week It was the first new subway station completed since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened.
On October 29, 2012, the South Ferry station suffered extensive flooding damage caused by Hurricane Sandy. Salt water filled the station from the track level all the way up to the station mezzanine, turning the station into a "large fish tank," as former MTA chairman Joseph Lhota described it. As a result, this section of the complex was closed until further notice.Old South Ferry subway station to reopenStorm Damage Prompts Return of Old Subway Stop The station is expected to reopen in August 2016 after renovations, signal room relocations, and extensive waterproofing work costing $600 million.[tpl]cite web | url=http://secondavenuesagas.com/2014/04/28/board-docs-south-ferry-reopening-still-targeting-mid-2016/ | title=Board docs: South Ferry reopening still targeting mid-2016 | work=Second Avenue Sagas | date=28 April 2014 | accessdate=28 April 2014 | author=Kabak, Benjamin[/tpl] The signal room itself could be delayed to 2019.

====Second Avenue Subway====

The Second Avenue Subway, having been repeatedly delayed and shaved back from a six-track combined local/express line to a two-track superexpress line since 1919 (with occasional construction between 1972 and 1976), was launched in 2007. A tunnelling contract was awarded to the consortium of Schiavone/Shea/Skanska (S3) by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) on March 20, 2007.MTA Press Release March 20, 2007 This followed preliminary engineering and a final tunnel design completed by a joint venture between AECOM and Arup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arup.com/americas/newsitem.cfm?pageid=873 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090205053106/http://www.arup.com/americas/newsitem.cfm?pageid=873 |title=Arup to design new Second Avenue Subway, New York |publisher=Arup |date=November 20, 2001 |accessdate=June 9, 2013 |archivedate=February 5, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arup.com/transportconsulting/project.cfm?pageid=7267 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090202234311/http://www.arup.com/transportconsulting/project.cfm?pageid=7267 |title=Second Avenue Subway – Transport Consulting |publisher=Arup |accessdate=June 9, 2013 |archivedate=February 2, 2009[/tpl] Parsons Brinckerhoff is the Construction Manager of the project.

A ceremonial ground-breaking for the Second Avenue Subway was held on April 12, 2007; the contractor prepared the initial construction site at 96th Street on April 23, 2007. A tunnel boring machine (TBM) was originally expected to arrive six to eight months after construction began, but the utility relocation and excavation required to create its "launch box" delayed its deployment until May 2010. By May 2010, the TBM launch box was complete, and on May 14, 2010, MTA's contractors completed the TBM installation and turned it on.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thelaunchbox.blogspot.com/2010/03/march-19-20-2010-blasting-on-second.html" |title=Blasting on Second Avenue |publisher=thelaunchbox.blogspot.com |date=March 22, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=2nd Ave. Subway Tunnel Dig Begins |first=Andrew |last=Siff |url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local-beat/2nd-Ave-Subway-Tunnel-Dig-Begins-93787364.html | publisher = WNBC |date=May 14, 2010 |accessdate=May 14, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Tunneling Begins Under Second Avenue |url=http://www.mta.info/news/stories/?story=63 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120817181120/http://www.mta.info/news/stories/?story=63 |work=MTA |date=May 14, 2010 |accessdate=May 17, 2010 |archivedate=August 17, 2012[/tpl]  On March 28, 2011, S3, having completed the west tunnel to 65th Street, began drilling for the east tunnel.

===Proposals===

====Triboro RX====

A proposal for the LIRR Bay Ridge Branch would have the New York City Subway use the tracks to link Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx via the Hell Gate Bridge.[tpl]cite news |date=August 22, 2013 |title=How About A Subway Linking Brooklyn, Queens & The Bronx WITHOUT Manhattan? |url=http://gothamist.com/2013/08/21/the_dream_subway_line_with_20_conne.php |publisher=Gothamist |accessdate=August 22, 2013[/tpl] In 1996 the Regional Plan Association conducted a study to determine the feasibility of the rail link.Third Regional Plan Summary Based on Paris's RER commuter rail system, the Triboro RX proposal will create a loop around the city. It was first proposed by the Regional Plan Association in 1996, and has been denounced as disastrous by some.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ltvsquad.com/2013/08/22/the-triboro-rx-an-rx-for-disaster/ |title=The Triboro RX: An RX for disaster. |publisher=ltvsquad.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl] The proposed line, discussion of which was revived in 2012, would connect to all non-shuttle subway services.[tpl]cite web|last=Rubinstein |first=Dana |url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/04/5772951/surprising-return-three-borough-x-line-subway |title=The surprising return of the three-borough 'X line' subway |publisher=Capital New York |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl] Obstacles for the proposal include the proposed Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel, the lack of electrification on the line, and the single-tracking in some parts of the line. Additionally, there is debate on where the line's northern terminus would be: some project it to end at Hunts Point, while others plan the line to end at Yankee Stadium.

====Rockaway Line====

Some plans call for the IND Rockaway Line to be extended along the right-of-way of the LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch, as the success of a new racino at Aqueduct Racetrack led to a proposal from Governor Andrew Cuomo to build a massive convention center in the vicinity. Talks of reactivating the line were publicly endorsed in February 2012 by Assemblymen Phillip Goldfeder and Michael G. Miller. Goldfeder commented “The commute for people here is only going to go from bad to worse. You can’t talk about a convention center without talking about transportation.” Goldfeder and Miller said they are not opposed to turning sections of the line into a park, but said people who live in Rockaway, Ozone Park and other areas have no quick or easy way to get into Manhattan. The Genting Group, which operates the racino and has been asked to construct the convention center, are evaluating several plans to increase transportation access. Genting is committed to paying for part of the transportation improvements. Queensway advocates are against resumption of rail service, stating that current bus service fills current transportation needs in the area.[tpl]cite news |title=Lawmakers: southern Queens commuters need a new railway more than the Queensway |first=Lisa L. |last=Colangelo |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/reactivating-rockaway-beach-rail-line-spells-relief-stranded-southern-queens-commuters-article-1.1020731?localLinksEnabled=false |newspaper=Daily News |location=New York |date=February 13, 2012|accessdate=2012-02-14[/tpl] Congressmen Hakeem Jeffries and Gregory Meeks added their support for the project in March 2013.

====LaGuardia Airport extension====

The BMT Astoria Line extension to LaGuardia Airport is again being considered as part of LaGuardia's long-range expansion/renovation plan. Currently, no New York City Subway routes service the airport directly, but provisions for a subway connection are part of a 2014 long range rebuilding plan by the MTA.http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/03/19/a_revamped_la_guardia_airport_could_look_like_this_in_2021.php
