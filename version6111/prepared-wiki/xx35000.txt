Smoke Rise is a census-designated place (CDP) in Blount County, Alabama, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 1,825.[tpl]GR|8[/tpl]

==History==

Smoke Rise lies east of Interstate 65 in western Blount County, with most homes sitting atop Bryant Mountain or in the valley below. The community began in the late 1960s as a large planned residential subdivision. Smoke Rise originally was slated to include its own community school, but those plans never came to fruition; today, children there attend public schools in nearby Hayden.
Residents founded the Smoke Rise Homeowners Association in the mid-1990s, but the community remains unincorporated despite occasional discussion of an incorporation vote. Few businesses are in Smoke Rise's immediate vicinity, but many observers expect the impending construction of a new sewer system in western Blount County to fuel commercial growth.
