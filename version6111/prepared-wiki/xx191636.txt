Prithee is an archaic English interjection formed from a corruption of the phrase pray thee, which was initially an exclamation of contempt used to indicate a subject's triviality.[tpl]Cite book|title=Glossology: or, The Historical Relations of Languages|author=John Stoddart|publisher=R.

Prithee is the most widely known example of second person object enclitics. It is  considered by linguists to have been the final step in the grammaticalisation of the verb pray.[tpl]Cite book|title=Corpus Approaches to Grammaticalization in English|author=Hans Lindquist|coauthors=Christian Mair|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|pages=241–242|year=2004|isbn=1-58811-523-2|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=noJUHKREqtUC&dq=Prithee+linguistics&lr=&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl] The eventual use of prithee outside the thee/thou usage signalled its transition into a discourse particle.[tpl]Cite book|title=Linguistic Variation in the Shakespeare Corpus|author=Ulrich Busse|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2002|page=204|isbn=1-58811-280-2|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=oU8xxzKv_7IC&dq=Prithee+word&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl]
There has been extensive scholarship investigating the difference in usage of prithee as opposed to pray you, both in terms of politeness and grammaticalisation.[tpl]Cite book|title=Variation Past and Present: VARIENG Studies on English for Terttu Nevalainen|author=Helena Raumolin-Brunberg|publisher=Société Néophilologique|year=2002|page=146|isbn=951-9040-16-1|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=niRZAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl] Because prithee eventually came to be used in the same context with the word you, it is considered to have developed into a monomorpheme. Prithee was almost always used as a parenthesis in order to introduce indirect questions and requests. 
Prithee and pray you often coincide in Early Modern English texts, and the difference between the two terms has been debated by scholars. Scholars such as Roger Brown and Albert Gilman have suggested that prithee was an ingroup indicator. Other scholars suggest that it is simply the more deferential form.[tpl]Cite book|title=Alternative Histories of English|author=Richard J.

Although the closest Modern English equivalent of prithee is please, the two terms presume different attitudes within the addressee. While please accompanies a request addressing itself to the positive desire of the addressee, as in "if it please you," prithee accompanies a request which addresses itself to the threat of being answered in the negative, as though the request were against the addressee's wishes.[tpl]Cite book|title=Speech Acts in the History of English|author=Andreas H. Jucker|coauthors=Irma Taavitsainen|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2008|page=241|isbn=90-272-5420-6|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=lj9tmpDz5_QC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false[/tpl] Stated otherwise, the word please suggests that the person being addressed is willing to comply with the request, whereas the word prithee suggests that he or she is not willing. This switch from stating the speaker's contrary desire to stating the speaker's wish not to impose signaled a cultural shift in the English-speaking world in which politeness became stated negatively rather than positively. Wider repercussions are observable in the replacement of such phrases as "excuse me" and "pardon me," which request understanding or forgiveness, with "I am sorry," which instead acknowledges the speaker's remorse.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Andreas H.
