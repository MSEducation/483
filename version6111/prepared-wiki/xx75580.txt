</ref> Climbers typically set up three camps along the ridge with camp 3 just below and to the right of the hanging [[glacier]], the Dablam. Any ice that calves off the glacier typically goes left, away from the camp. However, a 2006 avalanche proved otherwise. A climbing permit and a liaison officer are required when attempting Ama Dablam. As with Mt. Everest, the best climbing months are April–May (before the [[monsoon]]) and September–October.

==2006 avalanche==

On the night of 13/14 November 2006, a large serac collapse occurred from the hanging glacier, which swept away several tents at Camp 3, killing six climbers (3 European, 3 Sherpa). Eyewitness testimony indicates that Camp 3 had not been sited in an unusual or abnormally dangerous spot, and that the serac fall was of such magnitude as to render the specific placing of the tents at Camp 3 irrelevant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mounteverest.net/news.php?id=15299|title=Ama Dablam avalanche testimony|publisher=MountEverest.net|date=2006-11-17|accessdate=2006-11-24[/tpl]
