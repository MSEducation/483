==Editorial stance==

Przegląd is a left-wing publication, and is considered to be connected with two Polish left-wing political parties, the Democratic Left Alliance and Labour Union. It has been critical of the policies of all post-communist governments, and is opposed to the monetarist policies that were instituted by Polish economist and finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz. The magazine was a vocal opponent of Poland's military presence in Iraq, and remains a persistent critic of the role that the Catholic Church plays in the social and political life of Poland.
