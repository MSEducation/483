==History==

===Portuguese rule===

Xai-Xai, formerly João Belo, developed in the early 1900s, under Portuguese rule, as a companion port to Lourenço Marques (currently Maputo), though its economic significance was never on par with Mozambique's largest city.[tpl]cite book |title=Lonely Planet Mozambique |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Mary |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Lonely Planet |location= |isbn=1-74059-188-7 |page=82 [/tpl] Before independence from Portugal in 1975, Xai-Xai was known as João Belo, in the Overseas Province of Mozambique.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/MZ/2/XaiXai.html |title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Xai-Xai, Mozambique |work=FallingRain Genomics |accessdate=2008-06-17[/tpl] João Belo grew and developed under Portuguese rule as a port, agricultural and industrial centre (rice and cashew were produced and transformed), a provider of services, including a district hospital and banking, and an administrative centre. Tourism was also important with beaches and hotels.JOÃO BELO-XAI-XAI, a film of João Belo, Portuguese Mozambique, before 1975. In 1970, the city had 63,949 inhabitants.
