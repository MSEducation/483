CATEGORIES: Suburbs of Sydney

Crows Nest is a suburb on the lower North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Crows Nest is located 5 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of North Sydney Council.

==History==

Crows Nest was originally part of a [tpl]convert|524|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] land grant made to Edward Wollstonecraft in 1821. 
The grant extended from the site of the present day Crows Nest to Wollstonecraft.  Edward Wollstonecraft built a cottage, the 'Crow's Nest' and, according to his business partner Alexander Berry, chose the name "on account of its elevated and commanding position".
Berry later built a more substantial Crow's Nest House on the estate in 1850, taking the name of the earlier cottage.
This site is now the building site of North Sydney Demonstration School and the gates of Crows Nest House (added in the 1880s) still stand at the Pacific Highway entrance to the school.  Berry died at Crows Nest House on 30 November 1873.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia ISBN 0-207-14495-8
