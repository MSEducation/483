Banu Lakhm is a large Arab tribe tracing their lineage back
to Qahtan, who among many achievements, created an
Arab kingdom in Al-Hira, near modern Kufa, Iraq.  This kingdom acted as a
buffer zone between Arabia and the Persian Empire, preventing Bedouin
Arab tribes from infiltrating Persian lands.
See more information in the Al-Hira page.
