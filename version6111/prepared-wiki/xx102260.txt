In 1988, Cansfield was elected to the Etobicoke Board of Education.[tpl]Cite news |title=NDP gains control of Toronto education board Picks up 4 more seats and now holds majority |first=Sandro |last=Contenta |work=Toronto Star |date=15 November 1988 |page=B4[/tpl] During her tenure she served as president of the Ontario Public School Boards' Association[tpl]cite news |title=School computer project unveiled |last=Lewington |first=Jennifer |work=The Globe and Mail |date=18 June 1994 |page=A11[/tpl] and later as president of the Canadian School Boards Association.

In November 1997 she was elected trustee as a member of the newly amalgamated Toronto District School Board.[tpl]cite web |title=Megacity Vote results |work=The Globe and Mail |date=12 November 1997 |page=A6[/tpl] In December 2001 she was elected by a vote of 12â€“10 as president of the school board beating rival her rival Kathleen Wynne.[tpl]cite news |title=Cansfield to chair school board ; Rookie trustee wins vice-chair job |last=Rushowy |first=Kristin |work=Toronto Star |date=6 December 2001 |page=B05[/tpl] In January 2003 Cansfield agreed to share the board chair position with Shelley Carroll. This came about because the board was deeply split by the province's takeover of the school board in 2002 by superintendent Paul Christie. The province took this action because the board could not balance its budget. The dual chair position was to remain in place until the following election in November 2003.[tpl]cite news |title=School board settles dispute |last=Lewington |first=Jennifer |work=The Globe and Mail |date=18 December 2002 |page=A24[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Supervisor tells board to 'get functional' |last1=Lewington |first1=Jennifer |last2=Taylor |first2=Gavin |work=The Globe and Mail |date=13 December 2002 |page=A30[/tpl] However, Cansfield resigned her position as co-chair four months later in order to focus on her run as a candidate in the 2003 provincial election. She retained her position as trustee.[tpl]cite web |title=Trustee Shelley Laskin named as new Co-Chair of the TDSB Board of Trustees |work=Canada NewsWire |date=14 May 2003[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=TDSB's Cansfield steps down to run for Liberals |last=Brunet |first=Carrie |work=The Villager |date=2 May 2003 |page=VLP00[/tpl]

===Provincial politics===

While there was some perception that Cansfield had centre-right or conservative views,[tpl]cite web |title=School board co-chair to run as Liberal |last=Urquhart |first=Ian |work=Toronto Star |date=12 April 2003 |page=A23[/tpl] she opted to run as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Etobicoke Centre in the 2003 election. Her decision to run for the Liberals rather than the Conservatives may have been driven by her distaste for the way that the Ernie Eves government had dealt with the budget crisis of the Toronto District School Board. She said, "I do not see a light at the end of the tunnel with this government. I'm tired of people not standing up and saying, 'I believe in public education.'" She based her campaign on improvements to the education system and handily beat Conservative rival Rose Andrachuk by 4,460 votes.[tpl]cite web |title=Parents hope politicians listening when it comes to education |last=O'Neill |first=Susan |work=The Villager |date=26 September 2003 |page=09[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Cansfield's victorious; After Stockwell's departure, riding was one to watch Liberals topple Tory stronghold in affluent riding |last=Lu |first=Vanessa |work=Toronto Star |date=3 October 2003 |page=B08[/tpl]
