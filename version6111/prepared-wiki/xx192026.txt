Phoenix is the first album by the singer-songwriter Vince Bell and was released on July 16, 1994, almost twelve years after Bell was broadsided by a drunk driver, leaving him with a severe traumatic head injury, broken ribs, multiple lacerations to his liver, and a mangled right forearm. The album landed high on many critics' best-of-the-year lists for 1994.[tpl]Fact|date=July 2008[/tpl]
