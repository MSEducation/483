Listed below are recipients of Champions Tour awards for golfers aged 50 and over.

==Player-elected awards==

Three Champions Tour year-end awards are elected by the players and announced in December.  The ceremony is held at a tournament early in the following season.  The Jack Nicklaus Trophy is for the player of the year.  The other two are the Rookie of the Year and Comeback Player of the Year awards.

==Statistical awards==

The Arnold Palmer Award is given to the player who earns the most Champions Tour money in a season. The Byron Nelson Award goes to the player who has the lowest scoring average (strokes-per-round).

==Charles Schwab Cup==

Points are earned for thousands of dollars earned in top-ten finishes at tournaments.  Since 2008, points have been doubled at majors and the Charles Schwab Cup Championship.  The top five win annuities.  Annuities involved in ties are divided amongst the tied players.

==Champions Tour Players of the Month==

Three members of the media form a panel which determines the recipients.  The winners receive a medal.
