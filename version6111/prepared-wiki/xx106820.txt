Chronicon Scotorum is a medieval Irish chronicle.
According to Nollaig Ó Muraíle,  it is "a collection of annals belonging to the 'Clonmacnoise group', covering the period from prehistoric times to 1150 but with some gaps, closely related to the 'Annals of Tigernach'. It survives in a paper copy made by Dubhaltach MacFhirbhisigh c.1640 from an exemplar no longer extant."
MacFhirbhisigh's copy was held by his friend (and possible pupil) Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh in the late 17th century, but was in France for a time in the 1760s before its purchase by Trinity College Dublin in 1776. Edited and published by William M. Hennessy in 1866, it is accorded to be one of the more valuable Irish annals by virtue of its computistical data which were frequently distorted in other such compilations.
Gilla Críst Ua Máel Eóin has been associated with the text as its compiler,Stokes, George Thomas: Ireland and the Anglo-Norman Church.  A History of Ireland and Irish Christianity from the Anglo-Norman Conquest to the Dawn of the Protestant Reformation (1889), p 360: "...The Chronicon Scotorum was originally compiled about the year 1150 by Christian Malone, Abbot of Clonmacnis,..." but if so, it was continued at some point after his death. His actual role in relation to the Chronicon is uncertain.
