Hermaphrodite is used in botany to describe a flower that has both staminate (male, pollen-producing) and carpellate (female, ovule-producing) parts. This condition is seen in many common garden plants. A closer analogy to hermaphroditism in botany is the presence of separate male and female flowers on the same individual—such plants are called monoecious. Monoecy is especially common in conifers, but occurs in only about 7% of angiosperm species.[tpl]cite web |last=Molnar|first=Sebastian|title= Plant Reproductive Systems|url= http://www.geocities.com/we_evolve/Plants/breeding_sys.html|date= 17 February 2004|work= Evolution and the Origins of Life|publisher= Geocities.com|accessdate=12 September 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091022174814/http://geocities.com/we_evolve/Plants/breeding_sys.html|archivedate=2009-10-22[/tpl]

==Other uses of the term==

Hermaphrodite was used to describe any person incompatible with the biological gender binary, but has recently been replaced by intersex in medicine. Humans with typical reproductive organs but atypical clitoris/penis are called pseudohermaphrodites in medical literature. Pseudohermaphroditism also refers to a human possessing both the clitoris and testicles.Voss, Heinz-Juergen: Sex In The Making – A Biological Account.

People with intersex conditions sometimes choose to live exclusively as one sex or the other, using clothing, social cues, genital surgery, and hormone replacement therapy to blend into the sex they identify with more closely. Some people who are intersex, such as some of those with  androgen insensitivity syndrome, outwardly appear completely female or male already, without realizing they are intersex. Other kinds of intersex conditions are identified immediately at birth because those with the condition have a sexual organ larger than a clitoris and smaller than a penis. Intersex is thought by some to be caused by unusual sex hormones; the unusual hormones may be caused by an atypical set of sex chromosomes.
Sigmund Freud (based on work by his associate Wilhelm Fliess) held fetal hermaphroditism to be a fact of the physiological development of humans.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] He based much of his theory of innate sexuality on that assumption.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] Similarly, in contemporary times, fetuses before sexual differentiation are sometimes described as female by doctors explaining the process.[tpl]cite book |last1=Leyner |first1=Mark |authorlink1= Mark Leyner|last2=Goldberg M.D.|first2=Billy|title=Why Do Men Have Nipples?: Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini|year=2005 |publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York |isbn=1-4000-8231-5|oclc=57722472[/tpl] Neither concept is technically true. Before this stage, humans are simply undifferentiated and possess a Müllerian duct, a Wolffian duct, and a genital tubercle.
