==Habitat==

The species is found in small calcium rich steams in the coastal rainforests of southeastern Nigeria and southwestern Cameroon. They are  benthopelagic, meaning they float just above the riverbed. They prefer water with a pH of 6 to 6.5 and temperature of 22 to 24oC.[tpl]cite book | title=Aquarien Atlas Volume 1 | publisher=Melle: Mergus, Verlag für Natur-und Heimtierkunde | author=Riehl, R. and H.A.

A bivittatum has only been observed in five locations and it is thought that they are present in no more than ten. This, along with the threat to their habitat from deforestation, has lead them to be classified as vulnerable.
