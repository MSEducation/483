It was also later used effectively by  at the Battle of Walaja in 633, by Alp Arslan at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 (under the name crescent tactic), at Battle of Mohács by Süleyman the Magnificent in 1526 and by Field Marshal Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld at the Battle of Fraustadt in 1706.
Daniel Morgan used it effectively  at the Battle of Cowpens in 1781 in South Carolina. Many consider Morgan's cunning plan at Cowpens the tactical masterpiece of the American War of Independence.
Zulu impis used a version of the maneuver that they called the buffalo horn formation.
Genghis Khan used a rudimentary form known colloquially as the horns tactic. In that case, two enveloping flanks of horsemen surrounded the enemy, though they usually remained unjoined, leaving the enemy an escape route to the rear, as described above. This was key to many of Genghis' early victories over other Mongolian tribes.
The maneuver was famously developed to perfection in the blitzkrieg of the armed forces of Nazi Germany during World War II.  In this case, rather than a mere infantry maneuver, it developed into a complex multi-discipline endeavor that involved fast movement by mechanized armor, artillery barrages, air force bombardment, and effective radio communications—with the primary objective of destroying enemy command and control chains, undermining enemy troop morale, and disrupting supply lines.
