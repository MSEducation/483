Mount Cromwell is a mountain located in the Sunwapta River Valley of Jasper National Park, in Alberta, Canada. Cromwell lines two km north of the east summit of Stutfield Peak. The mountain was named in 1972 by J. Monroe Thorington after Oliver Eaton Cromwell, an American climber who made many first ascents in the Canadian Rockies.
The first ascent was made in 1938 by E. Cromwell, E. Cromwell jr., F.S. North, J. Monroe Thorington, guided by Edward Feuz jr.
In 2005, Bill Corbett, author of "The 11,000ers of the Canadian Rockies," climbed to the top of Mount Cromwell.  At the summit, his GPS registered 11,006 feet.  So perhaps Mount Cromwell should be included in the list of the Canadian Rocky Mountains that are over 11,000 feet in elevation.
