"Spotlighting Sound Talent"  Interview Magazine.
January 1996.[/ref]"I loved the incredible story telling in Cole Porter and Dylan songs, and I related terribly to the heartbreak and vulnerability I heard in Billy Holiday's voice. Punk Rock and Hip Hop, on the other hand, influenced me deeply with their language of empowerment and raw immediacy. Those genres demanded a brave refusal to be silenced or forgotten, and that inspired me tremendously." – Poe.  Robertson, R. "Poe to Poe" Venice Magazine. December 1995.

October 29, 2000. Listening to those tapes for the first time proved so difficult for Poe that she was hesitant to use them in her music. She was quoted in the Los Angeles Times, saying, "I took these tapes home, and I couldn't listen to them. It was too hard, so I kept finding ways to avoid it. They were sitting on my coffee table next to a boombox for quite some time."Appleford, Ibid.

Of his sister's support, Mark recounts how he once, in a moment of rage, tore the handwritten manuscript of a story called "Redwood" into tiny pieces and threw it into a dumpster and that Poe had gone out to that dumpster and taped the entire manuscript back together.

2001.[/ref]Billboard - Google Books. Books.google.com (2001-06-09). Retrieved on 2012-12-14. Atlantic announced that it had renewed Poe's contract and committed to Poe for three more albums.Singer, Maya.  "Poe"  New York Post.  August 21, 2001.Taylor, Chuck (editor). "Pick Ups" Billboard Magazine.  August 26, 2001. They renewed their agreement with the boutique label, Modern/FEI Records (Fishkin Entertainment, Inc.) through which Poe was signed to Atlantic.Taylor, Ibid.Singer, Ibid. In addition, Atlantic committed to releasing and distributing "Haunted" internationally and serviced the album globally. Shortly thereafter, they printed promo copies of "Wild," which was "Haunted's" second single that included a remix by Static Revenger. Copies of that single were never sent to radio.
A merger of Atlantic and AOL Time Warner was approved by the FCC in January 2001. AOL Time Warner was under close scrutiny to show positive results almost immediately after their mega-merger. With a softening of the economy after the FCC approval, they began close review of all relationships with third party production houses, such as Modern Records[tpl]cite web|author=Bronson, Marena|title=AOL Time Warner: A Closer Look at the Largest Media Merger in History|publisher=3.villanova.edu|url=http://www3.villanova.edu/realtimefinance|accessdate=November 3, 2012[/tpl]

The net result of this was that Poe was to be dropped from its roster of artists.  Poe's manager and Modern/FEI label head, Paul Fishkin, stated that 'Poe was stunned to be let go as Atlantic had just picked up its option on her next three albums and had already printed promo CDs of her next single 'Wild' and sent them to radio.'Lee, Felicia R. "Tori Drops Her Label" The New York Times.  June 4, 2008.Robinson, Lisa. "Paths Diverge inside the AOl Time Warner Merger" Vanity Fair. December 2001. Val Azzoli, then President of Atlantic, said to Billboard Magazine of dropping Poe, 'Poe must be feeling pretty bruised right about now,' adding only that Atlantic had simply made a business decision.Newman, Melinda. "The Beat: Waves at Atlantic" Billboard Magazine.  November 24, 2001. The article points out that it was a strange decision in light of the fact that, 'according to SoundScan, "Haunted" had sold 250,000 copies and the album's first single, "Hey Pretty,"  had only come out two months prior'.  Spinner reflected ten years later on the business decision and its impact stating, 'With a gold record under her belt, a [tpl]Sic|?|hide=y|critically|-[/tpl]acclaimed second album, a new hit single, strong sales,  and an arena tour opening for Depeche Mode, Poe was well-established as an important influence.  And then, poof—she disappeared.' Poe Returns After 10 Years of Legal Battles. Spinner (2010-01-28). Retrieved on 2012-12-14.

==2001–2011==

In 2002, a story in the August issue of "LA Weekly"  shed some light on the action of Atlantic to drop their rapidly rising artist with commitments and creative work underway.  Poe had been signed to Atlantic in 1995 through a boutique label called Modern Records/Fishkin Entertainment Inc. (FEI).  Amidst the complex and huge merger of Time Warner with AOL in 2000, it came to light that, in spite of the fact that Atlantic was responsible for providing all funding, marketing, publicity, radio promotion, tour support and distribution for the Poe project, Modern/FEI (not Atlantic) in its 1982 distribution deal with Atlantic, was awarded ownership of the masters of all Poe recordings.  What this meant for Atlantic was that, by renewing Poe's contract, Atlantic had committed sizable resources to a project in which, it would have a financial participation, but not an equity stake in Poe's past, present or future catalogue.Babayan, Siran. "Free Poe. Free Fiona."  LA Weekly. August 11–16, 2002.
In November 2000, Atlantic/AOL Time Warner first chose to drop the Modern/FEI, and as a result were contractually obligated pay Modern/FEI an undisclosed amount of money, and effectively release themselves from any further fiduciary responsibilities to Modern/ FEI and/or Poe.  This resulted in a pay-off for Modern/FEI and prematurely ended  all printing, distribution, marketing, and promotion of Poe's second album "Haunted." Babayan, Ibid. In exchange for these monies, Modern/FEI's agreed to give Atlantic a two-year grace period during which Modern/FEI agreed not to do anything commercially with any of Poe's master recordings, enabling Atlantic to sell off their stock of already produced copies of "Haunted."  As a result, "Haunted" received no further promotional support and the album faded from the market place.Klein, Alec. "New Firm to Follow Three Leaders" Washington Post.

Though Modern/ FEI kept ownership of Poe’s masters until 2004, in 2001 as “Haunted” was climbing the charts, the label sold its interest in Poe as an artist and in Poe’s future recordings, in a questionable deal to a wealthy oil executive and longtime Poe fan who bought her contract and kept Poe tied up in court, unable to release new music or perform professionally for nearly a decade. What music Poe did release during that time was generally done under the pseudonym “Jane.”’’http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=8/’’’’http://orphicmusic.com’’The contract eventually ended after 10 years of legal wrangling, when The Labor Commission of California ruled in favor of Poe. Katz, Miriam.  “A Decade of Silence” ‘’New York Post’’.  December 2011. New York Post writer, Miriam Katz, quoted Poe in her 2011 article, “A Decade of Silence,” about Poe’s ten-year legal battles, “My entire life was suddenly under the control of a very powerful man whom I didn’t know, and who didn’t to mean well. It was a horror story from which I am just beginning to recover.” Katz, Ibid.
Poe was able to perform for charitable events during this period, and she collaborated on film soundtracks and continued to compose and write.Ragogna, Mike.
