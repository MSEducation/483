 If you had seen this road before it was made.

You would lift up your hands and bless General Wade.

Wade also organised a militia named "Highland Watches", calling on members of the landed gentry to sign up[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bcmh.org.uk/archive/reviews/NewarkHighlanderMessenger.pdf|title=Highlander: The History of the Legendary Highland Soldier|publisher=British Commission for Military History|date=Autumn 2009|accessdate=5 May 2012[/tpl] and raising the first six companies in 1725 (three of Campbells and one each of Frasers, Grants, and Munros).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reocities.com/Bohemiabhoy/black.html|title=The Black Watch Regiment (1739-2006)|accessdate=5 May 2012[/tpl] Also in 1725, Wade put down an insurrection after the Government attempted to extend the "Malt tax" to Scotland and enraged citizens in Glasgow drove out the military and destroyed the home of their representative in parliament.Chalmers, p.871 He was promoted to lieutenant general on 15 April 1727.[tpl]LondonGazette|issue=6572|supp=|startpage=3|date=11 April 1727|accessdate=5 May 2012[/tpl]

==War of the Austrian Succession==

On 17 December 1743 he became a field marshal[tpl]LondonGazette|issue=8284|supp=|startpage=5|date=13 December 1743|accessdate=5 May 2012[/tpl] with his appointment to the joint command of the Anglo-Austrian force in Flanders against the French in the War of the Austrian Succession. Wade organised an advance towards Lille in July 1744 but the action became stalled in the face of logistical problems. He resigned from his command in March 1745, returning home to become Commander-in-Chief of the Forces.

==Jacobite rising==

In October 1745 during the Jacobite rising Wade focussed his troops on Newcastle upon Tyne on the East coast of England; however the Jacobite forces advanced from Scotland down the West coast of England via Carlisle into Lancashire and the speed of their advance left Wade scrambling. In freezing conditions and with his men starving, he failed to counter their march into England or their subsequent retreat back from Derby to Scotland; Wade was replaced as Commander-in-Chief by Prince William, Duke of Cumberland who led the army to success at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746.Pollard p.41-42
Wade received mention in a verse used as part of God Save the King circa 1745:
 
 Lord, grant that Marshal Wade

May, by thy mighty aid,

Victory bring.

May he sedition hush

And, like a torrent, rush

Rebellious Scots to crush.

God save the King.

Wade died, unmarried, on 14 March 1748 and is buried at Westminster Abbey where his life is recognised by a monument created by Louis-François Roubiliac.Hiatt, p.4
