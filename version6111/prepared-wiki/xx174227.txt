[[Bartonville Agreement]]

CATEGORIES: Continuing Anglicanism, Christian ecumenism, Peoria County, Illinois, 1999 in religion

The Bartonville Agreement came from a meeting held on May 1999 by bishops representing both the Anglican Communion's American province (The Episcopal Church) and a number of Continuing Anglican jurisdictions in North America. As such, it was an early effort made by conservative Episcopal bishops and Continuing Anglican bishops to voice a common set of principles which might become the basis of future cooperation between their churches or dioceses. The schism that had divided these church bodies had occurred in 1977 at the Congress of St. Louis when "Continuers" met and formed a new Anglican church in reaction to changes in doctrine and practice that had been approved by The Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada.
These bishops assembled in Bartonville, Illinois at Saint Benedict's Abbey. In his opening comments the host, Abbot Alberto Morales, encouraged those present "to let the Holy Spirit guide us and show us the way that we should go...that as we face the new millennium we may present to the world a portion of the Anglican Communion reconciled and united, which in turn, may be an example to imitate for all good and faithful Anglicans and for the Church in general."  The result of the meeting was the signing of a "Call to prayer" for unity and a determination to meet again.
A second convocation of bishops took place in Bartonville on October 29 of the same year.  The result of this meeting was the signing of the Articles of Ecclesiastical Fellowship.
