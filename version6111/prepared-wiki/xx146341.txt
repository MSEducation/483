[[Wireless light switch]]

CATEGORIES: Switches, Remote control

A wireless light switch is a light switch that commands a light or home appliance to turn itself off or on, instead of interrupting the power line going to the light fixture. There are different ways to communicate between the switch and the fixture:

==Common uses for wireless switches==

===Complicated wiring===

Multiple transmitters can be used with a single receiver, allowing more than the two-switch limit imposed by using a three-way switch. Some modern vehicles also have built-in transmitters.

===Remodeling===

Wireless light switches eliminate the wire from the light to the switch location. This is useful in remodeling situations where new wiring can be a hassle. Rather than tearing down a wall to gain access to the wires, a wireless switch can be used. This avoids any need to access wires and makes remodeling fast and simple.

===Log homes===

Another use for wireless switches is in log homes, where electrical installations can be difficult because of the amount of routing and drilling that would otherwise be needed. When running a regular (non-wireless) circuit, the electrician must drill a hole through all of the logs to get each wire to the switch location. The electrician also must route a large hole in the log to install a switch box. Wireless switches do not need switch boxes because there are no wires and no routing is needed which decreases the electrical work required.

==Battery-free switches==

All remote light switches require a power source in order to facilitate the transmission of a signal to the receiving device.Some of these switches rely on batteries for power output while most are required to be wired into an existing electrical system. Lightning Switch, EnOcean with Ad Hoc Electronics, and Arveni s.a.s. manufacture wireless light switches that use energy harvesting instead of batteries. The mechanical energy created by pressing the switch generates enough electricity to power a built-in transmitter that  sends a radio signal to the receiver. LightwaveRF manufacture wireless switches that use mains power LightwaveRF and offer devices for lighting, power, heating control along with remote control via an iPhone or Android phone.
