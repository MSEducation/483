Julie Frances Christie (born 14 April 1940 or 1941) is a British actress. A pop icon of the "swinging London" era of the 1960s, she has won the Academy, Golden Globe, BAFTA, and Screen Actors Guild Awards.
Christie's breakthrough film role was in Billy Liar (1963). In 1965, she won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Diana Scott in Darling. That same year, she starred as Lara Antipova in Doctor Zhivago, the eighth highest grossing film of all time after adjustment for inflation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm|title=All Time Box Office Adjusted for Ticket Price Inflation|publisher=Boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=27 March 2012[/tpl] In the following years, she starred in Fahrenheit 451 (1966), Far from the Madding Crowd (1967), Petulia (1968), The Go-Between (1970), McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971), Don't Look Now (1973), Shampoo (1975), and Heaven Can Wait (1978).

She was baptised in the Church of England and studied as a boarder at the independent Convent of Our Lady school in St. Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, after being expelled from another convent school for telling a risqué joke which reached a wider audience than originally anticipated. After being asked to leave the Convent of Our Lady as well, she later attended Wycombe Court School, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, during which time she lived with a foster mother from the age of six.[tpl]cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2047296,00.html|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=The divine Miss Julie|first=Tim|last=Adams|date=1 April 2007|accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl]
After her parents' divorce, Christie spent time with her mother in rural Wales. As a teenager at the all-girls' Wycombe Court School, she played "the Dauphin" in a production of Shaw's Saint Joan. She later studied at the Central School of Speech and Drama.[tpl]cite web|last=Sirota|first=David|url=http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2001/06/12/julie_christie/index.html|title=Salon.com|publisher=Archive.salon.com|date=12 June 2001|accessdate=30 May 2010[/tpl]

==Career==

Christie made her professional stage debut in 1957, and her first screen roles were on British television. Her big break came in the 1961 BBC serial A for Andromeda. She was a contender for the role of Honey Rider in the first James Bond film, Dr. No, but producer Albert R. Broccoli reportedly thought her breasts were too small."Kiss Of Death", 12 November 1995, New York Daily News
In 1962, Christie appeared in feature films with co-starring roles in a pair of comedies for Independent Artists: Crooks Anonymous and The Fast Lady. Her breakthrough role, however, was as Liz, the friend and would-be lover of the eponymous character played by Tom Courtenay in Billy Liar (1963), which earned her a BAFTA Award nomination. The director, John Schlesinger, had cast Christie only after another actress dropped out of the film.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2010/sep/01/billy-liar-tom-courtenay-julie-christie|location=London|work=The Guardian|title=Billy Liar – still in town|first=Laura|last=Barton|date=1 September 2010[/tpl]
Life magazine hailed 1965 as "The Year of Julie Christie" when the young actress became known internationally for her role as an amoral model in Darling, directed by Schlesinger. Christie, who had obtained the lead role when the casting of Shirley MacLaine fell through,[tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/person/julie-christie/biography.htm|title=Julie Christie Biography at Yahoo! Movies[/tpl] won numerous accolades for her performance, including the Academy Award for Best Actress.
Christie starred in two other films released in 1965, first appearing as Daisy Battles in Young Cassidy, a biopic of Irish playwright Seán O'Casey, co-directed by Jack Cardiff and (uncredited) John Ford. Her last film of the year was David Lean's Doctor Zhivago, adapted from the epic/romance novel by Boris Pasternak. The film was a box office smash, and Christie's role as Lara Antipova would become her most famous. As of 2014, Doctor Zhivago is the 8th highest-grossing film of all time, adjusted for inflation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=doctorzhivago.htm|title=Doctor Zhivago (1965)|publisher=Box Office Mojo|date=22 December 1965|accessdate=27 March 2012[/tpl]
In 1966, Christie played a dual role in François Truffaut's adaptation of the Ray Bradbury novel Fahrenheit 451, where she starred opposite Oskar Werner. Later, she played Thomas Hardy's heroine Bathsheba Everdene in Schlesinger's Far from the Madding Crowd (1967), and the title role, Petulia Danner, in Richard Lester's Petulia (1968), opposite George C. Scott.
Christie's persona as the "swinging 60s British bird" she had embodied in Billy Liar and Darling was further cemented by her appearance in the documentary Tonite Let's All Make Love in London. In 1967, Time magazine said of her: "What Julie Christie wears has more real impact on fashion than all the clothes of the ten best-dressed women combined.""The private life of Julie Christie", L.A. Times, 5 January 2008.
In 1970, Christie co-starred with Alan Bates in Joseph Losey's romantic drama The Go-Between, which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. She earned a second Best Actress Oscar nomination the following year for her role as a brothel madame in Robert Altman's postmodern western McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971). The film marked the first of three collaborations between Christie and Warren Beatty, who described her as "the most beautiful and at the same time the most nervous person I had ever known." The two had a high-profile but intermittent relationship between 1967 and 1974. After the relationship ended, they worked together again in the hit comedies Shampoo (1975) and Heaven Can Wait (1978).
Christie's other films during the 1970s were Nicolas Roeg's controversial thriller Don't Look Now  (1973), in which she had a graphic sex scene with Donald Sutherland, and the science-fiction/horror film Demon Seed (1977), based on the novel of the same name by Dean Koontz.
Having moved to Los Angeles in 1967 ("I was there because of a lot of American boyfriends"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20124450,00.html|title=Darling|date=9 February 1998[/tpl]) Christie returned to the United Kingdom in 1977, where she lived on a farm in Wales. In 1979, she was a member of the jury at the 29th Berlin International Film Festival.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1979/04_jury_1979/04_Jury_1979.html|title=Berlinale 1979: Juries|accessdate=8 August 2010|work=berlinale.de[/tpl] Never a prolific actress, even at the height of her fame and bankability, Christie turned down many high-caliber film roles, including Anne of the Thousand Days, They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, Nicholas and Alexandra, and Reds, all of which earned Oscar nominations for the actresses who eventually played them.[tpl]cite web|title=Oscar Augury – Best Actress: Julie Christie is Front-Runner for Her Performance in "Away from Her"|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/oscar-augury-best-actress-julie-christie-front-705979.html|publisher=Yahoo![/tpl]
In the 1980s, Christie appeared in non-mainstream films such as The Return of the Soldier (1982) and Heat and Dust (1983). She had a major supporting role in Sidney Lumet's Power (1986) opposite Richard Gere and Gene Hackman, but other than that, Christie avoided large budget studio films. In 1988, she starred in the television film Dadah Is Death, based on the Barlow and Chambers execution, playing Barlow's mother who desperately fights to save her son from being hanged for drug trafficking in Malaysia.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/12/arts/julie-christie-making-us-tv-movie.html|title=Julie Christie Making U.S. TV Movie|work=New York Times|date=12 July 1988[/tpl]
In 1996, Christie appeared as Gertrude in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. Her next critically acclaimed role was the unhappy wife in Alan Rudolph's domestic comedy-drama Afterglow (1997), which gained her a third Oscar nomination.
In 2004, Christie made a brief cameo appearance in the third Harry Potter film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, playing Madam Rosmerta. That same year, she also appeared in two other high-profile films: Wolfgang Petersen's Troy with Brad Pitt and Marc Forster's Finding Neverland, as Kate Winslet's mother. The latter performance earned Christie a BAFTA nomination as supporting actress in film.
Christie portrayed the female lead in Away from Her, a film about a long-married Canadian couple coping with the wife's Alzheimer's disease. Based on the Alice Munro short story "The Bear Came Over the Mountain", the movie was the first feature film directed by Christie's sometime co-star, Canadian actress Sarah Polley. She took the role, she says, only because Polley is her friend.Olsen, Mark (14 November 2007)."Julie Christie is good at being picky", Los Angeles Times Polley has said Christie liked the script but initially turned it down as she was ambivalent about acting. It took several months of persuasion by Polley before Christie finally accepted the role.[tpl]cite web|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|title='I felt like a crazy stalker'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/apr/13/4|work=The Guardian,12 April 2007|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=25 December 2013[/tpl]

The critics singled out the performances of Christie and her co-star, Canadian actor Gordon Pinsent, and Polley's direction. Christie's performance generated Oscar buzz, leading the distributor, Lions Gate Entertainment, to buy the film at the festival to release the film in 2007 to build momentum during the awards season.
On 5 December 2007, she won the Best Actress Award from the National Board of Review for her performance in Away from Her.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nbrmp.org/awards/awards.cfm?award=William%20K%2E%20Everson%20Award%20For%20Film%20History|title=National Board of Review of Motion Pictures: Awards|publisher=Nbrmp.org|accessdate=30 May 2010[/tpl] She also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama, the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role and the Genie Award for Best Actress for the same film.
