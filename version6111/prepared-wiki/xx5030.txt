==Biography==

John Digweed began DJing at age 15 and made a name for himself in his home town of Hastings where he put on successful club nights, the most famous of which were successful raves on Hastings Pier where the likes of Carl Cox and The Prodigy performed[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]. His breakthrough came in 1993 when he sent a mix tape to Geoff Oakes, the founder of Renaissance Club in Mansfield who played it to fellow DJ Alexander Coe (aka Sasha) heard his demo. The two DJs struck up a long-term friendship and working relationship despite Sasha twice failing to turn up for gigs that Digweed had booked him for in Hastings.
In partnership with Sasha Digweed is known for promoting the progressive house and notable for producing the first commercial compilation for a nightclub when they releasd the 1994  compilation of mixes from the nighclub Renaissance entitled Renaissance:_The_Mix_Collection. Until then mixtapes from clubs had only been circulated by DJs on an amatuers basis. The Renaissance CD was first time that a compilation CD had been planned stragetically for marketing from the artwork to promotion. The two DJs famously followed this up with their Norther Exposure compilations and those on Global Underground. 
He then started the record label Bedrock Records to further promote the music he was playing at the time. In addition to starting the Bedrock imprint, he and friend Nick Muir produce under the Bedrock alias getting their big break when their first track 'For What You Dream Of' was used in the film Trainspotting. 
In his sets, Digweed is noted[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] for adopting tracks with new and different styles.
Between 2000 and 2005, John Digweed promoted his "Bedrock" sound with monthly club nights for members and newcomers to the electronic music scene.  He played Thursday nights at Heaven in London and Friday nights at a smaller club night at The Beach in Brighton.  These nights featured numerous guest DJs including  Danny Howells, Phil Thompson, Hernan Cattaneo, and Chris Fortier.  As Digweed's international schedule increased, these events drew to a close, although occasional reunions are still held at Heaven. Digweed celebrated 10 years of his Bedrock club night at Matter, London on 10 October 2008 with a near on 10-hour set.
Digweed has enjoyed popularity throughout North America in addition to Europe. Digweed, as well as Sasha, established a monthly residency at the now defunct New York club Twilo, which proved a key location for the American electronic music scene. The residency began in 1996 with a lukewarm reception but grew into one of the most popular club nights in New York City by the end of its run in 2001. Sasha and Digweed DJ'd at Twilo on the last Friday of every month, playing sets that lasted between 8 and 12 hours. In early 2001, Sasha suffered an ear injury and was unable to play for their last 4 dates until Twilo was closed by the New York City authorities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] Digweed continued to play the time slot by himself until May 6, 2001 when Twilo was raided by the NYPD and subsequently forced to close down.
Digweed DJed as himself in the Greg Harrison's 2000 movie Groove, which tells the story of an all-night rave in San Francisco.
In early 2002, Digweed underwent a six week country-wide tour of the United States with Sasha and Jimmy Van M called Delta Heavy. Promotion of the tour was done by Clear Channel and attendance reached 85,000.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] The tour took place in a variety of venues but was completely self-reliant from a technical point of view.  Sound, lights, and visual setups were brought along to every gig of the tour. Also in 2002, Digweed created the soundtrack to the film Stark Raving Mad.
From September 2000 to January 2011, Digweed hosted a weekly two-hour radio show on Kiss 100 in the UK, in which Digweed played the first hour of music and a guest DJ played the second hour. Beginning in September 2006, John Digweed's show was available on all 3 Kiss radio stations. By that time, the show's name became Transitions, which was also the name of a four-volume series of mix albums by Digweed released every six months during 2006-2008. In January 2011, "Transitions" aired for the last time on Kiss 100.Twitter: DJJohnDigweed The show continues to be broadcast online.
