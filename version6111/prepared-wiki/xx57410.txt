[[Mooneye]]

CATEGORIES: Hiodontidae, Fish of North America

The mooneyes are a family, the Hiodontidae, of primitive ray-finned fish comprising two living and three extinct species in the genus Hiodon. They are large-eyed, fork-tailed fish that physically resemble shads. Their common name comes from the metallic gold or silver shine of their eyes.
The higher classification of the mooneyes is not as yet fully established.  Some sources place them in their own Order - Hiodontiformes (as in the treatment here), while others retain them in the order Osteoglossiformes.

==Hiodon tergisus==

The mooneye (Hiodon tergisus Lesueur, 1818) is widespread across North America, living in the clear waters of lakes, ponds, and rivers. It consumes aquatic invertebrates, insects, and fish. Mooneyes can reach [tpl]convert|47|cm|in[/tpl] in length.
Mooneyes feed readily on terrestrial insects, and will provide fine sport for an intrepid flyrod angler. They will also take small lures and natural baits with gusto. Mooneyes are frantic, hyperactive fish and their impressive leaps and passionate fighting style has earned them the nickname "Freshwater Tarpon".

==Hiodon alosoides==

The goldeye (Hiodon alosoides (Rafinesque, 1819)) is also widespread across North America, and is notable for a conspicuous golden iris in the eyes. It prefers turbid slower-moving waters of lakes and rivers, where it feeds on insects, crustaceans, fish, frogs, shrews, and mice. The fish has been reported up to [tpl]convert|52|cm|in[/tpl] in length. The smoked meat is highly valued and sold as "Winnipeg goldeye".
