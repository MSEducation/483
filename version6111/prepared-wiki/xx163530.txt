[[Interstate 24 in Tennessee and Georgia]]

CATEGORIES: Interstate 24, Interstate Highways in Tennessee, Transportation in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Interstate Highways in Georgia (U.S. state)

Interstate 24 (I-24) runs from Clarksville to Chattanooga via Nashville in the U.S. state of Tennessee.  Just west of Chattanooga, I-24 drops into Georgia's Dade County for [tpl]convert|4.10|mi|km[/tpl] before reentering Tennessee.
In Georgia, exit numbers for I-24 are a continuation of Tennessee's exit numbering scheme, while the mileposts are Georgia's mileposts. It is also designated, but not signed as, State Route 409.  The portion east of Interstate 59 runs along the U.S. Route 11 corridor.

==Route description==

One of the more hazardous stretches of Interstate highway in the United States [tpl]citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl] is located approximately 40 miles (64 km) west of Chattanooga on I-24 in Monteagle, where the highway crosses the Cumberland Plateau. Compared to grades elsewhere, Monteagle's 4–6% grade does not come close to the steepest (Interstate 40 between Nashville and Knoxville features 5% grades in each direction as well as a 5% grade north of Nashville on 24, near Joelton), but the slope is protracted over a distance of several miles. While all motorists need to exercise caution, truckers are particularly vexed by Monteagle, and many have died going through this area.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] As runaway trucks had been a regular and deadly occurrence, in part of the failure or inability of truckers to slow down to the [tpl]convert|35|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] truck speed limit once on the slope, the eastbound lanes were rebuilt in the late 1980s. This work reduced the grade, widened the road, added a required stopping area with traffic lights for trucks prior to descending the mountain, and added two runaway truck ramps where a truck whose brakes have failed due to overheating can exit into a long pit full of loose gravel to safely stop. Owing to geography, these two ramps are on the left side of the grade. This stretch of highway inspired Johnny Cash to write a song about Monteagle Mountain.
The Monteagle grade also has one of the three widest medians of any Interstate highway, with the others being I-8 through the In-Ko-Pah grade in California and I-84 through the Cabbage Hill grade east of Pendleton, Oregon. There is more than a mile between the eastbound and westbound lanes at one point. The eastbound lanes descend the mountain on one side of a ridge, while the westbound lanes ascend the other. Also of interest on Monteagle Mountain is the steep grade on I-24 north of Monteagle. This steep grade occurs for westbound traffic and features a sharp [tpl]convert|45|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] curve to the right while descending steeply at the same time. This downhill curve also features off-ramp approach style lane dividers, in order to slow both motorists and truckers. Also in Chattanooga is the "Ridge Cut", a 1/4 mile section of Missionary Ridge, between the 4th Avenue exit and the Germantown/Belvoir exit.  Accidents and severe congestion are common here.

==History==

On May 18, 2010, it was announced that a sinkhole was found in the eastbound lanes of I-24 in Grundy County near the exit of Tennessee State Route 50. Tennessee Department of Transportation officials stated that hole was growing with traffic diverted onto the westbound lanes.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12500016 |title= Sinkhole Forces I-24 Closure in Grundy County |location= Nashville, TN |publisher= WTVF-TV |date= May 18, 2010 |accessdate= May 18, 2010[/tpl]  However, emergency repairs commenced and was reopened several days later.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2010/may/22/sinkhole-repaired-i-24-reopens/?local |title= Sinkhole Repaired, I-24 Reopens |work= Chattanooga Times Free Press |date= May 22, 2010 |accessdate= June 26, 2010[/tpl]
