Heath High School was a secondary school operated by the McCracken County Public Schools district in the rural community of West Paducah, unincorporated McCracken County, Kentucky, near the largest city in the state's far-western Purchase region, Paducah. Established in 1910, the school served students in grades 9-12. It closed in June 2013 in advance of the August opening of a new McCracken County High School, which consolidates Heath, Reidland and Lone Oak High Schools. The final graduate of the last ever senior class in Heath High School history was Zachary Compton, who graduated May 24, 2013.
