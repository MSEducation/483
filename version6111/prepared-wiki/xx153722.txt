Count Carl August Ehrensvärd (May 5, 1745 – May 21, 1800) was a Swedish naval officer, painter, author, and neo-classical architect.  
Ehrensvärd  was born in Stockholm, and died in Örebro. Though active as a naval officer during his entire life, he is mostly remembered for the burlesque caricatures of often famous people from his era with which he decorated his letters.  Some of his writings were published by Svenska Vitterhetssamfundet.
In 1790, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
