Household Words was an English weekly magazine edited by Charles Dickens in the 1850s. It took its name from the line in Shakespeare's Henry V: "Familiar in his mouth as household words."

==History==

During the planning stages, titles originally considered by Dickens included The Robin, The Household Voice, The Comrade, The Lever, and The Highway Of Life.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Fitzgerald | first1 = Percy Hetherington | title = Memories of Charles Dickens, with an account of "Household words" and "All the year round" and of the contributors thereto | publisher = J.

Household Words was published every Wednesday from March 1850 to May 1859. Each number cost a mere tuppence, thereby ensuring a wide readership. The publication's first edition carried a section covering the paper's principles, entitled "A Preliminary Word":
A longer version of the publication's principles appeared in newspapers such as The Argus in September 1850.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4766745 |title=HOUSEHOLD WORDS. |newspaper=The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957) |location=Melbourne, Vic. |date=2 September 1850 |accessdate=4 September 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
Theoretically, the paper championed the cause of the poor and working classes, but in fact addressed itself almost exclusively to the middle class. Only the name of Dickens, the journal's "conductor", appeared; articles were unsigned (although authors of serialized novels were identified) and, in spite of its regularly featuring an "advertiser", the paper was unillustrated.
In order to boost slumping sales Dickens serialized his own novel, Hard Times, in weekly parts between April 1 and August 12, 1854. It had the desired effect, more than doubling the journal's circulation and encouraging the author, who remarked that he was, "three–parts mad, and the fourth delirious, with perpetual rushing at Hard Times".Kitton, Frederic George (2004 ed.)1902 The Life of Charles Dickens: His Life, Writings, and Personality, p. 230.

That Dickens owned half of the company and his agents, John Forster and William Henry Wills, owned a further quarter of it was insurance that the author would have a free hand in the paper. Wills was also appointed associate editor and, in December 1849, Dickens' acquaintance, writer and poet Richard Henry Horne was appointed sub-editor at a salary of "five guineas a week".[tpl]cite book | last1 = Blainey | first1 = Ann | title = The farthing poet : a biography of Richard Hengist Horne, 1802-84; a lesser literary lion. | publisher = Longmans | year = 1963 | location = London | page = 179[/tpl] In 1859, however, owing to a dispute between Dickens and the publishers, Bradbury and Evans, publication ceased and Household Words was replaced by All the Year Round, in which he had greater control.
The journal contained a mixture of fiction and nonfiction. A large amount of the non-fiction dealt with the social issues of the time.
