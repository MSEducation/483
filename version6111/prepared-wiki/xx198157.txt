[[List of Petaling Jaya city sections]]

CATEGORIES: Petaling Jaya

Petaling Jaya is divided into several sections. Some sections themselves are subdivided into smaller neighbourhoods (kejiranan), for example SS5D. Some sections have their own names (SS1 is Kampung Tunku), while other sections are grouped together (SS5, SS6 are part of Kelana Jaya).

==Addressing format==

These sections names are used in the addressing format for locations in Petaling Jaya.
No. 15,  
Jalan SS20/6, 
47300 Petaling Jaya, 
Selangor. 
This system would point to house number xx, 5th street, section SS3, Petaling Jaya. This would remove the need to have an additional address line for the housing estate name (in this example, Taman Subang) like most addresses used for the rest of the country.
The city sections are numbered as such that the older sections have no prefixes to their section number (Seksyen 1, Seksyen 9) while later sections have prefixes such as SS (Sungei Way-Subang), PJS (Petaling Jaya Selatan) and PJU (Petaling Jaya Utara).
