==Television personality==

On a national level, Kunawicz is probably best known as one of the three female hosts for a talk show called XYZ Young Women's TV, which aired over PTV-4 and later on the ABS-CBN News Channel (ANC).

In 2000 she was also the producer of Quark Henares' Palanca Award winning independent film "A Date With Jao Mapa."

==Writer and editor==

Prior to her television exposure, she was known for her columns in the Manila Times and Mirror Weekly.  Her In The Dark column in the Manila Times, a daily broadsheet, came out every Saturday until the paper closed down in 1999.
Her On The Verge column for Mirror Weekly, a magazine at which she was also Youth Editor, ran for six years until she left the publication in 2000.  Her work on On The Verge led to the 1999 release of a book of the same title.
Aside from these columns, she continues to contribute articles to various newspapers and magazines on a freelance basis.  Among the publications these works have come out in include the Manila Chronicle, Daily Globe, Philippine Graphic, Philippine Daily Inquirer, and Music News Asia.
