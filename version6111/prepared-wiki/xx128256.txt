CATEGORIES: Bus stations in Brisbane

The Aspley Bus Station, at Aspley, is serviced by TransLink bus routes. It is part of the Aspley Hypermarket Shopping Centre. It is in Zone 4 of the TransLink integrated public transport system.
The station is presently being upgraded with enhanced waiting areas, an enclosed lounge, improved accessibility and real-time passenger information, as part of TransLink's wider project for upgrading bus stations in South East Queensland.
An additional service has been added in 2008 which offers Personalised Public Transport (PPT). This service consists of a 'Black & White' MaxiTaxi servicing from the bus station, up Albany Creek Road, up Bangalow St, down through Trouts road, then back to the Hypermarket. This service runs approximately every 20 minutes during peak times morning and afternoon. The cost of this service is $1 and will pick up patrons anywhere along the route.http://www.blackandwhitecabs.com.au/cms/pages/BM_Menu/FOR+PASSENGERS/!/Services/Personalised+Public+Transport/display.html
