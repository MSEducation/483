The Miao ([tpl]zh|c=苗|p=Miáo[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-vi|Mèo or H'Mông[/tpl]; Thai: แม้ว (Maew) or ม้ง (Mong); [tpl]lang-my|mun lu-myo[/tpl]) is an ethnic group recognized by the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) as one of the 55 official minority groups. Miao is a Chinese term and does not reflect the self-designations of the component nations of people, which include (with some variant spellings) Hmong, Hmu, A Hmao, and Kho (Qho) Xiong. The Chinese government has grouped these people and other non-Miao peoples together as one group, whose members may not necessarily be either linguistically or culturally related. For this reason, many Miao peoples cannot communicate with each other, and have different histories and cultures.  Some groups designated as Miao by the PRC do not even agree that they belong to the ethnic group.
The Miao live primarily in southern China, in the provinces of Guizhou, Hunan, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Hainan, Guangdong, and Hubei. Some members of the Miao sub-groups, most notably the Hmong people, have migrated out of China into Southeast Asia (northern Vietnam, Laos, Burma (Myanmar) and Thailand). Following the communist takeover of Laos in 1975, a large group of Hmong refugees resettled in several Western nations, mainly in the United States, France, and Australia.  There has been a recent tendency by Hmong Americans to group all Miao peoples together under the term Hmong because of their disdain for the Chinese term Miao. This however fails to recognize that, while the Hmong are a small nation within the broader linguistic/cultural family of Miao people, the vast majority of Miao people do not classify themselves as Hmong and have their own names for themselves.

==Nomenclature: Miao and Hmong==

The term "Miao" gained official status in 1949 as a minzu (ethnic group) encompassing a group of linguistically related ethnic minorities in southwest China. This was part of a larger effort to identify and classify minority groups to clarify their role in the national government, including: establishing areas of autonomous government and allocating the seats for representatives in provincial and national government.Schein, Louisa. "The Miao in contemporary China." In The Hmong in transition. Edited by Hendricks, G. L., Downing, B. T., & Deinard, A. S. Staten Island: Center for migration studies (1986): 73-85.
Historically, the term "Miao" had been applied inconsistently to a variety of non-Han peoples. Early Western writers used Chinese-based names in various transcriptions: Miao, Miao-tse, Miao-tsze, Meau, Meo, mo, miao-tseu etc. In South-East Asian contexts words derived from the Chinese "Miao" took on a sense which was perceived as derogatory by the Hmong sub-group living in that region. In China, however, the term has no such context and is used by the Miao people themselves, of every group.Tapp, Nicholas. "Cultural Accommodations in Southwest China: the 'Han Miao' and Problems in the Ethnography of the Hmong." Asian Folklore Studies, Vol. 61, 2002: 77-104. The later prominence of Hmong people in the West has led to a situation where the entire Miao linguistic/cultural family is sometimes referred to as Hmong in English language sources. Following the recent increased interaction of Hmong in the West with Miao in China it is reported that some non-Hmong Miao have even begun to identify themselves as Hmong. However, most non-Hmong Miao in China are unfamiliar with the term as referring to their entire group and continue to use "Miao", or their own separate ethnic self-designations.
Though the Miao themselves use various self-designations, the Chinese traditionally classify them according to the most characteristic colour of the women's clothes. The list below contains some of these self-designations, the colour designations, and the main regions inhabited by the four major groups of Miao in China:

==Demographics==

According to the 2000 census, the number of Miao in China was estimated to be about 9.6 million. Outside of China, members of the Miao linguistic/cultural family sub-group or nations of the Hmong live in Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Burma due to outward migrations starting in the 18th century. As a result of recent migrations in the aftermath of the Indochina and Vietnam wars between 1949 and 1975, many Hmong people now live in the United States, French Guiana, France and Australia. Altogether there are approximately 8 million speakers in the Miao language family. This language family, which consists of 6 languages and around 35 dialects (some of which are mutually intelligible) belongs to the Hmong/Miao branch of the Hmong–Mien (Miao–Yao) language family.
The Hmong live primarily in the northern mountainous reaches of Southeast Asia including Thailand, Laos and Vietnam, and in far Southwest China mostly in the provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi, and to a very limited extend in Guizhou. There are about 1.5-2 million Hmong in China.
Most Miao currently live in China. Miao population growth in China:
3,600,000 Miao, about half of the entire Chinese Miao population, were in Guizhou in 1990. The Guizhou Miao and those in the following six provinces make up over 98% of all Chinese Miao:
In the above provinces, there are 6 Miao autonomous prefectures (shared officially with one other ethnic minority):
There are in addition 23 Miao autonomous counties:
Most Miao reside in hills or on mountains, such as
Several thousands of Miao left their homeland to move to larger cities like Guangzhou and Beijing. There are 2,000,000 Hmong spread throughout northern Vietnam, Laos, Burma, and on other continents. 174,000 live in Thailand, where they are one of the six main hill tribes.

==History==

===History according to Chinese legend and other considerations===

According to Chinese legend, the Miao who descended from the Jiuli tribe led by Chiyou (Chinese: 蚩尤 pinyin: Chīyóu) were defeated at the Battle of Zhuolu (Chinese: 涿鹿 pinyin: Zhuōlù, a defunct prefecture on the border of present provinces of Hebei and Liaoning) by the military coalition of Huang Di (Chinese: 黃帝 pinyin: Huángdì) and Yan Di, leaders of the Huaxia (Chinese: 華夏 pinyin: Huáxià) tribe as the two tribes struggled for supremacy of the Yellow River valley. According to legend, the battle, said to have taken place in the 2500 BC, was fought under heavy fog.  The Huaxia, who possessed a form of mechanical compass, was able to defeat the tribe of Chiyou. (In an alternative account, Chiyou was never defeated and has been worshiped as god. It is generally accepted that Chiyou has been worshiped by succeeding dynasties regardless of their ethnic origins.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] This further corroborates the possibility that the defeat was not a fact but a likely story rewritten to legitimize the Huaxia history for later Han Chinese dynasties such as Qin or Han.)[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
After general population movement toward south, southwest, and southeast (due in part to influx of northern and western groups such as Huaxia and Donghu), the tribe of Chiyou split into two smaller splinter tribes, the Miao and the Li (Chinese: 黎; pinyin: lí). The Miao continuously moving southwest and Li southeast as the Huaxia people, later known as Han Chinese, expanded southward. Some members of the Miao and Li tribes were assimilated into the Han Chinese during the Zhou Dynasty.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] (Recent DNA studies suggest that the movement of ethnic groups such as Miao in ancient East Asia is far more complex than this unsubstantiated "historical" accounts.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
Another version of the story says that the tribe split three ways. It is said Chiyou had 3 sons, and after the fall of Jiuli, his eldest son led some people south, his middle son led some people north, and his youngest son remained in Zhuolu and assimilated into the Huaxia culture. Those who were led to the south established the San-Miao nation.

===Archaeological discoveries===

According to André-Georges Haudricourt and David Strecker, the Miao were among the first people to settle in present day China.Haudricourt, Andre and Strecker. "Hmong–Mien (Miao–Yao) Loans in Chinese". T'uong Pao, Vol. 77, Numbers 4-5, (1991): 335-341  They found that the Chinese borrowed a lot of words from the Miao in regard to rice farming.  This indicated that the Miao were among the first rice farmers in China.  In addition, geneticists have connected the Miao to the Daxi Culture (5,300 - 6,000 years ago) in the middle Yangtze River region.Wen, Bo; Li, Hui; Gao, Song; Mao, Xianyun; Gao, Yang; Li, Feng; Zhang, Feng; He, Yungang; Dong, Yongli; Zhang, Youjun; Huang, Wenju; Jin, Jianzhong; Xiao, Chunjie; Lu, Daru; Chakraborty, Ranajit; Su, Bing; Deka, Ranjan; Jin, Li. "Genetic Structure of (H)mong-Mien Speaking Populations in East Asia as Revealed by mtDNA Lineages", Oxford Journal of Molecular Biology and Evolution (2005) 22 (3): 725-734. doi:10.1093/molbev/msi055 The Daxi Culture has been credited with being amongst the first cultivators of rice in the Far East.
The study goes on to mention that the Miao (especially the Miao-Hunan) have some DNA from the Northeast people of China, but has origins in southern china.
In 2006 rice cultivation was found in the Shandong province even earlier than the Daxi Culture.Crawford, G. W., X. Chen, and J. Wang Houli Culture Rice from the Yuezhuang Site, Jinan. Kaogu Archaeology 3:247-251, 2006. (In Chinese)
Miao scholars also proposed that an intact female corpse found in 1972 in Changsha, Hunan could be a Miao woman, based on the drawings on the casket which are characteristic of Miao design, and except for a few minor illustrations on the top left, Miao scholars assert the rest of the intricate illustrations resembles Miao legends and folk stories.Xiong, Yuepheng L.

===Chu===

In 2002, the Chu language has been identified as perhaps having influence from Tai–Kam and Miao–Yao languages by researchers at University of Massachusetts Amherst.Chu Language Rhymes at University of Massachusetts Amherst

===Qin and Han dynasties===

In 2011 the DNA of the Miao were sampled with the White Hmong having 7.84% D-M15.http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0024282  Chinese text stated the San Miao went South to the Yangtze River area then were later exiled to Gansu. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] The Miao seem to be the remanents of this ancient San Miao tribe.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
The term Miao was first used by the Han Chinese in pre-Qin times (in other words, before 221 BC) for designating non-Han Chinese groups in the south. It was often used in combination: "nanmiao", "miaomin", "youmiao" and "sanmiao" (三苗; pinyin: Sānmiáo)

===Ming and Qing dynasties===

During the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368–1911) 'miao' and 'man' were both used, the second possibly to designate the Yao (傜 Yáo) people. The Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties could neither fully assimilate nor control the aboriginal people.
During the Miao Rebellions, when Miao tribes rebelled, Ming troops, including Han chinese, Hui people, and Uyghurs crushed the rebels, killing thousands of them.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8ePxMW066j8C&pg=PA133&dq=jian+uyghur+hunan&hl=en&ei=-BO9TJ3BK4SBlAfLxZ2GDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Negotiating ethnicity in China: citizenship as a response to the state|author=Chih-yu Shih, Zhiyu Shi|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|location=|isbn=0415283728|page=133|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tyhT9SZRLS8C&pg=PA380&dq=miao+rebellion+tribe+southwest+china+ming&hl=en&ei=yE_MTLnOIsKBlAfDw7XlCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Cambridge history of China: The Ming dynasty, 1368-1644, Part 1|author=Frederick W.

During the Qing Dynasty the Miao fought three wars against the empire. In 1735 in the southeastern province of Guizhou, the Miao rose up against the government's forced assimilation. Eight counties involving 1,224 villages fought until 1738 when the revolt ended. According to Xiangtan University Professor Wu half the Miao population were affected by the war.
The second war (1795–1806) involved the provinces of Guizhou and Hunan. Shi Sanbao and Shi Liudeng led this second revolt. Again, it ended in failure, but it took 11 years to quell the uprising.[tpl]cite book|last=Elleman|first=Bruce A.|title=Modern Chinese Warfare, 1795-1989|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415214742|pages=7–8|location=London|chapter=The Miao Revolt (1795–1806)[/tpl]
The greatest of the three wars occurred from 1854 to 1873. Xiu-mei Zhang led this revolt in Guizhou until his capture and death in Changsha, Hunan. This revolt affected over one million people and all the neighbouring provinces. By the time the war ended Professor Wu said only 30 percent of the Miao were left. This defeat led to the Hmong people migrating out of China.
During Qing times, more military garrisons were established in southwest China. Han Chinese soldiers moved into the Taijiang region of Guizhou, married Miao women, and the children were brough up as Miao.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5wOBAAAAMAAJ&q=Despite+such+conflict,+Jin+Dan+informed+me+that,+in+the+past,+some+Miao+women+in+the+Taijiang+area+married+Han+soldiers,+though+the+children+were+raised+as+Miao.+Memories+also+exist+of+Nationalist+troops,+in+the+decades+before+1949&dq=Despite+such+conflict,+Jin+Dan+informed+me+that,+in+the+past,+some+Miao+women+in+the+Taijiang+area+married+Han+soldiers,+though+the+children+were+raised+as+Miao.+Memories+also+exist+of+Nationalist+troops,+in+the+decades+before+1949&hl=en&ei=BNLMTIfrLIK0lQfZkuT8CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA|title=Contributions to Southeast Asian ethnography, Issue 7|author=|year=1988|publisher=Board of Editors, Contributions to Southeast Asian Ethnography|location=|isbn=|page=99|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HLERRaLvOXEC&pg=PR17&dq=taijiang+miao+rebellion&hl=en&ei=ruDMTKrdIsH_lgeH1uiYBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=taijiang%20miao%20rebellion&f=false|title=Butterfly mother: Miao (Hmong) creation epics from Guizhou, China|author=Dan Jin, Xueliang Ma, Mark Bender|year=2006|publisher=Hackett Publishing|location=|isbn=0872208494|page=xvii|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl] In spite of rebellion against the Han, Hmong leaders made allies with Chinese merchants.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IZPKAAAAMAAJ&q=Despite+the+bloody+revolt+against+Han+oppression,+the+Hmong+leaders+were+receptive+to+alliances+with+Chinese+merchants,+developing+a+symbiotic+relation+with+them+%E2%80%94+indication+of+the+fluidity+of+ethnic+relations+during+that+period.&dq=Despite+the+bloody+revolt+against+Han+oppression,+the+Hmong+leaders+were+receptive+to+alliances+with+Chinese+merchants,+developing+a+symbiotic+relation+with+them+%E2%80%94+indication+of+the+fluidity+of+ethnic+relations+during+that+period.&hl=en&ei=59_MTMjEM8GBlAf9_uHjCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA|title=The dream of the Hmong kingdom: resistance, collaboration, and legitimacy under French colonialism (1893-1955)|first=Mai Na M. |last = Lee|year=2005|publisher=University of Wisconsin--Madison|location=|isbn=|page=149|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl]
Politically and militarily, the Miao continued to be a stone in the shoe of the Chinese empire. The imperial government had to rely on political means to ensnare Hmong people, they created multiple competing positions of substantial prestige for Miao people to participate and assimilate into the Qing government system. During the Ming and Qing times, the official position of Kaitong was created in Indochina. The Miao would employ the use of the Kiatong government structure until the 1900s when they entered into French colonial politics in Indochina.

===20th Century===

During the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the Miao played an important role in its birth when they helped Mao Zedong to escape the Kuomintang in the Long March with supplies and guides through their territory.
In Vietnam, a powerful Hmong named Vuong Chinh Duc dubbed the king of the Hmong aided Ho Chi Minh's nationalist move against the French, and thus secured the Hmong's position in Vietnam.Nevison, Leslie. "In Search of a Hmong King" During the Vietnam War, Miao fought on both sides, the Hmong in Laos primarily for the US, across the border in Vietnam for the North-Vietnam coalition, the Chinese-Miao for the Communists. However after the war the Vietnamese took great aggression against the Hmong who suffered years of reprisals and genocide.  Interestingly, most Hmong in Thailand also supported a brief Communist uprising during the war.
