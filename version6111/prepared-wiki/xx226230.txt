CATEGORIES: 2009 in American motorsport, Atlantic Championship seasons

The 2009 IMSA Cooper Tires Atlantic Championship season was the thirty-sixth Atlantic Championship season. It was the first full season of the Championship under the sanctioning of the International Motor Sports Association. After a three-way title battle into the final round at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca, John Edwards became the series' youngest champion, beating Jonathan Summerton on a tie-breaker, after both drivers finished on 182 points. They also finished tied on four victories, but Edwards broke the tie with four second place finishes compared to Summerton's three.

==Schedule==

Seven rounds are held jointly with the American Le Mans Series: Sebring, Miller, Lime Rock, Mid-Ohio, Mosport, Road Atlanta and Laguna Seca.
The series planned to open its season on a road course on Hutchinson Island in Savannah, Georgia on March 15. The race was postponed until 2010, as further work on the track was required before it could be homolgated for professional open wheel racing. A second race at New Jersey Motorsports Park and Autobahn Country Club were added instead.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.eformulacarnews.com/news_info.php?n=4887&sid=c710e0dbe651826fc9f70554c15c0199|title=Atlantic: Team Owners Meeting Details Revealed| date=2009-02-03 | accessdate=2009-02-03| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090208031357/http://eformulacarnews.com/news_info.php?n=4887&sid=93c39998a69e4723efd96569bfe753fa| archivedate= 8 February 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
