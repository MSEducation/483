Boston Phoenix critic Milo Miles criticizes "Can'tcha Say (You Believe in Me)" as "tedium."[tpl]cite news|title=Pop-Pourri|newspaper=Boston Phoenix|date=October 21, 1986|author=Miles, M.|page=40|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X20tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tooFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6501,2051409&dq=boston+cool+the+engines&hl=en|accessdate=2013-08-11[/tpl]  He singles out the line "Where there's a will there's a way" as an example of the song's "prosaic, cliched lyrics."
