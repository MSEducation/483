"Our Lady of Banneux" is the sobriquet given to the apparition of the Virgin Mary to Mariette Beco, an adolescent girl living in Banneux, province of Liège (Belgium). Between January 15 and March 2, 1933, Beco told her family and parish priest of seeing a Lady in white who declared herself to be the "Virgin of the Poor", saying I come to relieve suffering and believe in me and I will believe in you. 

==The apparitions==

According to Mariette, she first saw the Blessed Virgin on the evening of Sunday, January 15, 1933, as she was looking out the kitchen window. A woman in white stood in the garden and called to her to come out, but her mother would not let her. Three days later the woman in white reappeared and told Marlette she was "Our Lady of the Poor". The lady appeared eight times in all."Apparitions after Beauraing", Catholic Herald, 15 November 1957 
In one of these visions, Beco said the Lady asked her to plunge (push) her hands into a small spring vos mains dans l'eau, telling her the spring was for healing and "for all nations". Over time the site drew pilgrims. Today, the small spring yields about 2,000 gallons of water a day with many reports of miraculous healings.Peter Stravinskas, 1998, Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Encyclopedia ISBN 0-87973-669-0 page 124
Her claims were subject to an official investigation from 1935 to 1937 by an episcopal commission. The evidence collected was submitted to Rome for further analysis. In May 1942 Bishop Kerkhofs of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Liège (Belgium) gave a first recognition of the authenticity of the reports. Then,  in 1947, approval for the apparitions came from the Holy See. It was declared definite in 1949.van Houtryve, La Vierge des Pauvres, Banneux, 1947Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices ISBN 0-87973-910-X page 641Matthew Bunson, 2008, The Catholic Almanac, ISBN 978-1-59276-441-9 page 123
After the apparitions, Beco decided to remain a private person, married and led a quiet family life.Teahan, Madeleine.
