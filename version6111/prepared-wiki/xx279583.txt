CATEGORIES: Physics books, Engineering books, Science textbooks, John Wiley & Sons books

Optical Waves in Layered Media is written as a textbook by Pochi Yeh for current optics courses in electrical engineering or applied physics. The book focuses on physics theory more than practical application. It is clearly written and includes comprehensive mathematical theoretical representations of the topics covered. General topical coverage is divided into five parts beginning with electromagnetic theory. It then covers isotropic layered thin films, anisotropic and inhomogeneous media including crystals and birefringence, and guided waves using layered media.[ref] Book review
