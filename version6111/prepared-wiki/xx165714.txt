The Dr Lagan Cup was an inter-county Gaelic football competition in the province of Ulster. The competition was discontinued in 1967 when Donegal won the competition. The Lagan Cup was the trophy for a Senior Football League, which at the time was limited to five Ulster counties, unlike the Dr. McKenna Cup, which is a knockout competition that includes all nine of Ulster's counties.
