==Career==

Hinkle started her career on the soap opera Another World. She also portrayed Judy Brooks on ABC's drama series Once and Again from 1999 to 2002.Marin Hinkle:Biography
Hinkle starred on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer, Angus T. Jones and Ashton Kutcher as Alan's (Cryer) neurotic ex-wife, Judith. Despite being a main cast member, she rarely made appearances in her later seasons on the show. She was quietly phased out of the series, and her last appearances as a regular were in the ninth season of the series. She made a brief cameo appearance in the tenth and current season, though still credited as a regular. This may be due to commitments to her new role as Samantha Bowers in the NBC drama series Deception with Tate Donovan, Victor Garber and Katherine LaNasa.'Two and a Half Men' star Marin Hinkle joins NBC's 'Infamous'
