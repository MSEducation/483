==Constitutional monarchy in Quebec==

The role of the Crown is both legal and practical; it functions in Quebec in the same way it does in all of Canada's other provinces, being the centre of a constitutional construct in which the institutions of government acting under the sovereign's authority share the power of the whole.[tpl]cite journal| last=Cox| first=Noel| title=Black v Chrétien: Suing a Minister of the Crown for Abuse of Power, Misfeasance in Public Office and Negligence| journal=Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law| volume=9| issue=3| pages=12| publisher=Murdoch University| location=Perth| date=September 2002| url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v9n3/cox93.html| accessdate=17 May 2009[/tpl] It is thus the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the province's government.[tpl]cite book| last=Privy Council Office| authorlink=Privy Council Office (Canada)| title=Accountable Government: A Guide for Ministers and Ministers of State[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]2008| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| year=2008| location=Ottawa| page=49| url=http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng&page=information&sub=publications&doc=ag-gr/2008/ag-gr-eng.htm| isbn=978-1-100-11096-7| accessdate=17 May 2009[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=February 2011[/tpl] The Canadian monarch—since 6 February 1952, Queen Elizabeth II—is represented and her duties carried out by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, whose direct participation in governance is limited by the conventional stipulations of constitutional monarchy, with most related powers entrusted for exercise by the elected parliamentarians, the ministers of the Crown generally drawn from amongst them, and the judges and justices of the peace.[tpl]Cite book| last=MacLeod| first=Kevin S.| authorlink=Kevin S.

A viceregal suite in the André-Laurendeau building in Quebec City is used both as an office and official event location by the lieutenant governor, the sovereign, and other members of the Canadian Royal Family.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.lieutenant-gouverneur.qc.ca/histoire/bureau-en.html| last=Office of the Lieutenant Gouverneur of Quebec| title=History > Office > The Office of the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec| publisher=Éditeur officiel du Québec| accessdate=5 July 2009[/tpl] The viceroy resides in a separate home provided by the provincial Crown and the Queen and her relations reside at a hotel when in Quebec.

===Royal associations===

Those in the Royal Family perform ceremonial duties when on a tour of the province; the royal persons do not receive any personal income for their service, only the costs associated with the exercise of these obligations are funded by both the Canadian and Quebec Crowns in their respective councils.[tpl]Citation| first=Sean| last=Palmer| first2=John| last2=Aimers| author2-link=John Aimers| title=The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy: $1.10 per Canadian| year=2002| edition=2| place=Toronto| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/costofcrown.html| accessdate=15 May 2009| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080619203100/http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/costofcrown.html| archivedate=19 June 2008[/tpl] Monuments around Quebec mark some of those visits, while others honour a royal personage or event.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.crht.ca/DiscoverMonarchyFiles/FactsAboutMonarchy.html|title=Royal Statues| publisher=Canadian Royal Heritage Trust| accessdate=5 July 2009[/tpl] Further, Quebec's monarchical status is illustrated by royal names applied regions, communities, schools, and buildings, many of which may also have a specific history with a member or members of the Royal Family; for example, Quebec has at least seven distinct features named for Queen Victoria, including the second largest area in Canada and Grand lac Victoria at the head of the Ottawa River, south of Val-d'Or.[tpl]cite encyclopedia| url=http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008358| encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia| title=Victoria| first=Alan| last=Rayburn| accessdate=15 September 2007[/tpl] Gifts are also sometimes offered from the people of Quebec to a royal person to mark a visit or an important milestone; for instance, Queen Elizabeth II was in 1955 given the puck with which Maurice Richard scored his 325th career goal—thereby setting a new record—during a game against the Chicago Blackhawks on 8 November 1952.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/microsites/queenandcommonwealth/MicroObject.asp?row=8&themeid=451&item=8| last=The Royal Collection| title=e-Gallery > Exhibitions > Queen & Commonwealth > Gifts > Ice hockey puck| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=26 July 2009[/tpl]
Associations also exist between the Crown and many private organizations within the province; these may have been founded by a Royal Charter, receive a royal prefix, and/or be honoured with the patronage of a member of the Royal Family. Examples include the Royal Montreal Curling Club, which is under the patronage of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and received its royal designation from King George V in 1924,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.royalmontrealcurling.ca/node/1| title=Founded in 1807, The Royal Montreal Curling Club is the oldest active athletic club in North America| publisher=The Royal Montreal Curling Club| accessdate=5 July 2009[/tpl] and McGill University, which was originally constituted as the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning through royal charter by King George III in 1801, before being reconstituted as a university by George IV in 1827.
The main symbol of the monarchy is the sovereign herself, her image (in portrait or effigy) thus being used to signify government authority.[tpl]Citation| last=MacKinnon| first=Frank| title=The Crown in Canada| publisher=Glenbow-Alberta Institute| year=1976| location=Calgary| page=69| isbn=978-0-7712-1016-7[/tpl] A royal cypher or crown may also illustrate the monarchy as the locus of authority, without referring to any specific monarch. Further, though neither the monarch nor her viceroy form a part of the constitutions of Quebec's honours, the latter do stem from the Crown as the fount of honour; unlike in all of Canada's other provinces, however, the insignia do not bear any royal emblems. Quebec lawyers may be appointed Queen's Counsel.[tpl]Cite journal| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| publication-date=1 October 2008| title=An Act respecting the Ministère de la Justice| series=16| publication-place=Quebec City| publisher=Éditeur officiel du Québec| url=http://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?text=an+Act+respecting+the+Minist%C3%A8re+de+la+Justice&language=en&searchTitle=Search+all+CanLII+Databases&path=/en/qc/laws/stat/rsq-c-m-19/latest/rsq-c-m-19.html| accessdate=5 July 2009| ref=harv[/tpl]

The province's sovereigntist political party, the Parti Québécois (PQ), has pushed for reforms: at a constitutional conference held in Ottawa in February 1968, delegates from Quebec indicated that a provincial president might suit the province better than the Queen and a lieutenant governor, but the proposal was not accepted.[tpl]Cite web| last=Michener| first=Roland| authorlink=Roland Michener| title=The Empire Club of Canada Speeches 1970-1971| url=http://speeches.empireclub.org/details.asp?SpeechID=562&FT=yes| accessdate=10 February 2009| origyear=19 November 1970| year=1971| publisher=The Empire Club Foundation| location=Toronto| pages=130–149[/tpl] In an interview in 1971, the then leader of the PQ, René Lévesque, when asked if there would be any role for the monarchy in an independent Quebec, responded: "Are you joking?
