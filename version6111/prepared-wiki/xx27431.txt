SAMPA charts of consonants and vowels
Note that a font supporting the Unicode IPA Extensions is needed to see the IPA characters.
Note that SAMPA is not a universal system; it varies from language to language. This chart shows the typical symbols used. For a universal system, see X-SAMPA; For use specific to English, see SAMPA chart for English.

Note: It is common, especially in Spanish and Italian, to represent the alveolar trill with rr and the alveolar flap with r. In Spanish, too, jj is used to represent the palatal fricative against the semivowel j. It has been proposed to use 4 for the alveolar flap, in which case r can be used to represent the trill (as its equivalent in the IPA system), and j\ for the palatal fricative, keeping in this way the policy of using one letter per one IPA symbol (and a backslash for alternative symbols).
