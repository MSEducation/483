==Early life and career==

Born in London, Ruth Watson was educated in London and at Westonbirt School in Gloucestershire. After taking up a career in graphic design, she became an inspector for the Good Food Guide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hattowendesign.com/inspector/ruthwatson.html|title=Ruth Watson|publisher=hattowendesign.com|accessdate=2008-05-20[/tpl]
In 1983, Watson and her husband David bought Hintlesham Hall in Hintlesham, Suffolk as a restaurant and cookery school from Robert Carrier, which over six years they turned into a 33-room hotel, with an 18-hole golf course. In 1990 they bought the Fox and Goose Inn at Fressingfield, launching it as one of Britain's first ever gastropubs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/nov/28/channel4.channelfive|title=Watson checks in to Channel 4|author=Dowell, Ben|publisher=guardian.co.uk|date=2007-11-28|accessdate=2008-05-20[/tpl] In November 1999, Watson and her husband bought the Crown and Castle Hotel in Orford near Woodbridge, Suffolk, which they have fully restored and run as a modern country house hotel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crownandcastle.co.uk|title=Crown and Castle|accessdate=2008-05-20[/tpl]
In January 2013 Watson commenced the first stage of a judicial review action, after the restaurant at the Crown and Castle Hotel was awarded a 1 out of 5 food hygiene rating. Watson has claimed that an independent expert has since carried out her own assessment disputing the rating, and that a judicial review will allow a court to determine the fairness of the inspection and the rating.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-20909912 |title=BBC News - Ruth Watson in Orford Crown and Castle hygiene dispute |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2013-06-09[/tpl] In June 2013 the Crown and Castle Hotel regained a 5 rating for food hygiene.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-22819058 |title=BBC News - Ruth Watson: Hotel inspector gets hygiene stars back |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2013-06-09[/tpl]

==Food writing==

Ruth Watson's hotel experience brought her to the eye of various publishers, and was asked in 1994 by friend Delia Smith to be a contributing food editor on Sainsbury's Magazine. Watson subsequently became food editor of the Daily Mail Weekend magazine, for which she was shortlisted for a Glenfiddich Award as newspaper cookery writer in 2001, and won twice as Cookery Writer of the year - in 1997 and 2000. Watson has written three books: the Really Helpful Cookbook published in October 2000 by Ebury Press; the slimming book Fat Girl Slim,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fatgirlslim.net/|title=Fat Girl Slim|author=Watson, Ruth|publisher=Quadrille Publishing|accessdate=2008-05-20[/tpl] while her cook book Something for the Weekend is in its third edition.

==Broadcasting career==

In autumn 2005, Ruth Watson's public profile greatly increased when she became the star of the Channel 5 television series The Hotel Inspector. In each episode of this observational documentary series, Watson would visit a struggling British hotel and try to turn their fortunes by giving advice and suggestions to the owner.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.five.tv/factsheets/hotelinspector|title=The Hotel Inspector|publisher=Five.tv|accessdate=2008-05-20[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Watson's direct style appealed to viewers and The Hotel Inspector has became one of Channel 5's most popular series of the 2000s (the show won a Royal Television Society Award in November 2006). Despite this, Watson decided not to undertake a fourth series, and was succeeded on the programme by hotelier Alex Polizzi.
In November 2007, Ruth Watson signed an exclusive two year deal with Channel 4 to front a number of television shows, the first of which explores the commercial development of Britain's country houses. Titled, Country House Rescue, the series was broadcast on Channel 4 on Tuesday nights in December 2008 - January 2009, and gained audiences of up to 2.7 million on its first run. A mini-series of catch-up episodes were broadcast a year later. A second series of Country House Rescue was commissioned by Channel 4, and started airing from March 2010.[tpl]cite news|title=C4 wants longer run of Country House Rescue|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/multi-platform/news/c4-wants-longer-run-of-country-house-rescue/2011651.article|publisher=Broadcast|date=24 March 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-20[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Country House Rescue|url=http://www.ruthwatson.co.uk/country-house-rescue.html|publisher=ruthwatson.co.uk|date=|accessdate=2009-08-29[/tpl]  A third series aired from March 2011, and a further series of catch-up episodes aired from August 2011.
