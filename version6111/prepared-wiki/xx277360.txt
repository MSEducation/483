==Format==

Promi's had participated in tasks and matches for treats or to avoid punishments. Daily nominations also took place (from Day 8 to 14). 

==House==

Promi Big Brother has its own Diary Room called "The Consultation Room". The Consultation Room is where Promi's can talk to Big Brother in private if ever they feel upset, lonely, angry or in seek of help and advice. Much of the house seems to have similar design to that of the eighth series of Celebrity Big Brother UK. The bedroom was based on a forest theme just like the fifth series of Big Brother UK. The bedroom has secret storage cupboards hidden behind the walls. The garden has a swimming pool with a small boat floating in it. There is also a life guard chair next to the pool in homage to Promi David Hasslehoff and his previous role in Baywatch.

==Promis==

In Promi Big Brother, the celebrities are called "Promi's" rather than the traditional "Housemates" that had been used in the previous 11 series of normal Big Brother Germany. Originally 12 Promi's entered the house on Day 1. 
On Day 5, David was given news by Big Brother that his father was ill. David decided to walk from the house later that evening to be with his father.http://www.sat1.de/tv/promi-big-brother/news/david-hasselhoff-verlaesst-das-promi-big-brother-haus On Day 7, Georgina entered the house as a replacement Promi for David.http://www.sat1.de/tv/promi-big-brother/bewohner-2013/georgina-fleur On Day 8, Sarah Joelle walked from the house after receiving bad news from Big Brother about her family.
