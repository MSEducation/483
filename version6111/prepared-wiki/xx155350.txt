Partners: Mel and Jay is a now-defunct talk show show which used to air every Sunday on GMA Network from 1996 to 2004.

==History==

The show started in 1996 on GMA Network when Mel Tiangco transferred to the network. This was a direct result of the 1995 Tide commercial which had led to her exile from ABS-CBN. The show had a successful run for almost seven years before its conclusion in 2004, when Jay Sonza became a senatorial candidate under Aksyon Demokratiko under the late Raul Roco coalition.
The show was renamed Partners with Mel Tiangco.  Eventually it became Mel and Joey when Joey de Leon was introduced as the new co-host of the show.
