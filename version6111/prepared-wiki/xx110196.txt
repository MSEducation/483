</ref> and studies continue to be made on what other, more subtle, factors contribute to their flight. According to recent research conducted by the [[University of Chicago]], scientists discovered a correlation between size and gliding ability, in which smaller flying snakes were able to glide longer distances horizontally.<ref name="physorg"/>
According to a research performed by Professor Jake Socha at Virginia Tech, these snakes can change the shape of their body in order to produce aerodynamic forces so they can glide in the air.[tpl]cite journal|title=Flying snake gets lift from UFO cross section|journal=New Scientist|date=Feb 8, 2014|page=17|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129553.300-flying-snake-gets-lift-from-ufo-cross-section.html[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Aerodynamics of the flying snake Chrysopelea paradisi: how a bluff body cross-sectional shape contributes to gliding performance|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|date=Feb 1, 2014|volume=217|pages=382–394|doi=10.1242/jeb.090902|first = Daniel | last = Holden | first2 = John J. | last2 = Socha | first3 = Nicholas D. | last3 = Cardwell | first4 = Pavlos P. | last4 = Vlachos [/tpl] Scientists are hopeful that this research will lead to design robots which can glide in the air from one place to another.[tpl]cite news|title=The Secret of Flying Snakes is Revealed|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/science/2014/01/140130_flying_snake_explained_sa.shtml|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=BBC Urdu|date=30 January 2014[/tpl]

==Diet==

Chrysopelea are diurnal, which means they hunt during the day. They prey upon lizards, frogs, birds and bats.[tpl]cite web |last=Socha |first=J. |title=Flying Snake Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.flyingsnake.org/faqs/faqs.html |date=1999–2005 |publisher=flyingsnake.org |accessdate=15 July 2009[/tpl]

==Species==

There are five recognized species of flying snake, found from western India to the Indonesian archipelago. Knowledge of their behavior in the wild is limited, but they are thought to be highly arboreal, rarely descending from the canopy. The smallest species reach about 2 feet (61 centimeters) in length and the largest grow to 4 feet (1.2 meters).
Their diets are variable depending on their range, but they are known to eat rodents, lizards, frogs, birds, and bats. They are mildly venomous snakes, but their tiny, fixed rear fangs make them harmless to humans.[tpl]cite journal |last=Socha |first=J.J. |last2 = LaBarbera | first2 = M. |date=March 2005 |title=Effects of size and behavior on aerial performance of two species of flying snakes (Chrysopelea) |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=208 |pages=1835–1847 |url=http://www.esm.vt.edu/~jjsocha/Publications_list_files/Socha&LaBarbera_2005.pdf |accessdate=2009-07-14 |doi=10.1242/jeb.01580 |pmid=15879064 |issue=Pt 10 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Golden tree snake or ornate flying snake, Chrysopelea ornata (Shaw, 1802): This is the largest species of flying snake, reaching up to four feet in length. Though it is called the golden tree snake, there are other colour variations; for example, some phases tend to lean towards lime green in colour rather than pure yellow, while in India, the it has orange to red markings and small black bars on the dorsum, almost as rich in colouration as the paradise tree snake. Due to their size, their gliding ability is considered weak.
Paradise tree snake, Chrysopelea paradisi Boie & Boie, 1827: This flying snake species reaches up to three feet in length and is popular in the European pet trade. Their bodies are black, but covered in rich green scales. Clusters of red, orange and yellow-coloured scales in the shape of flower petals line the dorsal area from the base of the neck to the tail. This is the most well known colouration, but some specimens may exhibit fully green colouration without any bright dorsal markings. Their gliding ability is considered one of the best among the flying snakes.
Twin-barred tree snake or banded flying snake, Chrysopelea pelias (Linnaeus, 1758): This is the smallest flying snake species, reaching up to two feet in length. Its base colour is black or dark grey, and the entire body is covered with thick red and thin yellow with black bands. They also have cream-coloured ventrolateral lines, while the ventrals are pale green. While it is tiny, it is undoubtedly one of the rarest flying snake species within its range. Although it is able to move horizontally through the air when gliding, it does not glide as well as C. paradisi.[tpl]cite web |last=Socha |first=J. |title=Chrysopelea pelias aerial images |url=http://homepage.mac.com/j.socha/aerial_images/pelias/pelias_air_gallery_1.html |date=1999–2005 |publisher=flyingsnake.org |accessdate=14 July 2009[/tpl]
