Sainsbury's is the second largest chain of supermarkets in the United Kingdom with a share of the UK supermarket sector of 17.7%.[tpl]cite news|title=Sainsbury's overtakes Asda for first time in a decade|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10571062/Sainsburys-overtakes-Asda-for-first-time-in-a-decade.html|accessdate=15 January 2014|newspaper=Independent|date=15 January 2014|first=GRAHAM|last=RUDDICK[/tpl] Founded in 1869 by John James Sainsbury with a shop in Drury Lane, London, the company became the largest grocery retailer in 1922, pioneered self-service retailing in the UK, and had its heyday during the 1980s. In 1995, Tesco overtook Sainsbury's to become the market leader, and Asda became the second largest in 2003, demoting Sainsbury's into third place. In January 2014, Sainsbury's overtook Asda to become the second largest supermarket chain. The holding company, J Sainsbury plc, is split into three divisions, Sainsbury's Supermarkets Ltd, Sainsbury's Convenience Stores Ltd (Sainsbury's Local), and Sainsbury's Bank. The group's head office is in the Sainsbury's Store Support Centre in Holborn Circus, City of London."Contact us." J Sainsbury plc. Retrieved 20 June 2010.

==History==

===Origin and growth (1869–1955)===

Sainsbury's was established as a partnership in 1869 when John James Sainsbury and his wife Mary Ann opened a store at 173 Drury Lane in Holborn, London.[tpl]cite web |title=Drury Lane|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline.com/SainsburyArchive/Themes/Places/Expansion/Drurylane.htm|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl] He started as a retailer of fresh foods and later expanded into packaged groceries such as tea and sugar. His trading philosophy, as stated on a sign outside his first shop in Islington, was "Quality perfect, prices lower".[tpl]cite web |title=Islington|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline/SainsburyArchive/Themes/Places/Expansion/Islington.htm|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl]
It was very innovative in that its stores, instead of featuring five own-brand lines like arch-rival Home and Colonial, it offered a wide range of own label lines in comparison. Instead of sawdust floors and wooden counters, Sainsbury's boasted marble counters, mosaic floors and white-tiled walls. Staff even had a uniform of white aprons. Stores started to look similar, so people could recognise them throughout London, a high cast-iron 'J. SAINSBURY' sign featured on every store so their stores could be seen on coaches and omnibuses,[tpl]cite web |title=Shopfronts|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline/SainsburyArchive/Themes/Places/Design/prodfronts.htm|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl] and round-the-back deliveries started to add extra convenience and not upset rivals due to Sainsbury's popularity.[tpl]cite web |title=Stepney|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline/SainsburyArchive/Themes/Places/Expansion/Stepney.htm|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl]
In 1922 J Sainsbury was incorporated as a private company, as 'J. Sainsbury Limited', when it became the UK's largest grocery group.[tpl]cite web |title=Redhill|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline/SainsburyArchive/Themes/Places/Expansion/Redhill.htm|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl]
By this time each store had six departments: dairy, bacon and hams, poultry and game, cooked meats and fresh meats. Groceries had not been introduced until 1903 when John James purchased a grocer's branch at 12 Kingsland High Street, Dalston. Home delivery featured in every store as there were fewer cars in those days. Sites were carefully chosen, with a central position in a parade selected in preference to a corner shop. This allowed a larger display of products, which could be kept cooler in summer, which was important as there was no refrigeration.[tpl]cite web |title=Counter Service Layout|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline/SainsburyArchive/Themes/Places/Design/archcounter.htm|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl]
By the time John James Sainsbury died in 1928, there were 128 shops. His last words were said to be 'Keep the shops well lit'. He was replaced by his eldest son, John Benjamin Sainsbury, who had gone into partnership with his father in 1915.[tpl]cite web |title=The Founders: John James Sainsbury|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline/SainsburyArchive/Themes/People/Sainsburys/|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl]
During the 1930s and 1940s, with the company now run by John James Sainsbury's eldest son, John Benjamin Sainsbury, the company continued to refine its product offer and maintain its leadership in terms of store design, convenience and cleanliness.[tpl]cite web |title=The Design Journal 1966|publisher=Vads|url=http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/diad/article.php?year=1966&title=211&article=d.211.34|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl] The company acquired the Midlands-based Thoroughgood chain in 1936.[tpl]cite web |title=The Bantons and expansion into the Midlands|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline/SainsburyArchive/Themes/Places/Expansion/Bantonsandthemidlands.htm|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl]
Alan Sainsbury, the founder's grandson (later Lord Sainsbury of Drury Lane) became joint managing director of Sainsbury's along with his brother Sir Robert Sainsbury in 1938 after their father, John Benjamin Sainsbury, had a minor heart attack.[tpl]cite web |title=The Third Generation|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline/SainsburyArchive/Themes/People/Sainsburys/Thirdgeneration.htm|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl]
Following the outbreak of World War II, many of the men that worked for Sainsbury's were called to do National Service and were replaced by women. Given Sainsbury's reputation for quality foods at fair prices, the Second World War were difficult times for Sainsbury's, as most of its stores were trading in the London area and were bombed or damaged. Turnover fell to half the pre-war level. Food was rationed, and one particular store in East Grinstead was so badly damaged on Friday 9 July 1943 that it had to move to the local Church as a temporary replacement while a new one was built. This store was not completed until 1951.[tpl]cite web |title=East Grinstead Case Study|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/museum/case_study.htm|accessdate=11 November 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050307201513/www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/museum/case_study.htm |archivedate=7 March 2005[/tpl]

===Self-service and heyday (1956–1991)===

In 1956, Alan Sainsbury became chairman after his father, John Benjamin Sainsbury's death. During the 1950s and 1960s Sainsbury's pioneered self-service supermarkets in the UK. On a trip to the United States of America, Alan Sainsbury realised the benefits of self-service stores, and believed the future of Sainsbury's was self-service supermarkets of [tpl]convert|10000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl], with eventually the added bonus of a car park for extra convenience.[tpl]cite web |title=The American Example|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline/SainsburyArchive/Themes/Progress/Self-service/|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl] The first self-service branch opened in Croydon in 1950.[tpl]cite web |title=Overview|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline/SainsburyArchive/Themes/Products/Range/|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl]
Sainsbury's was a pioneer in the development of own-brand goods; the aim was to offer products that matched the quality of nationally branded goods, but at a lower price.[tpl]cite web |title=Advertising|publisher=Sainsbury Archive |url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline/SainsburyArchive/Themes/Products/Advertising/ |accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl] It expanded more cautiously than Tesco, shunning acquisitions, and it never offered trading stamps.[tpl]cite web |title=Targeting customers|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline/SainsburyArchive/Themes/Products/Advertising/target+cust.htm|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl]
Until the company went public on 12 July 1973, as J Sainsbury plc, the company was wholly owned by the Sainsbury family. It was at the time the largest ever flotation on the London Stock Exchange;[tpl]cite news |title=Sainsbury's targeted for Europe's biggest private equity buyout|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=3 February 2007|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/feb/03/privateequity.supermarkets|accessdate=11 November 2008 | location=London | first=Julia | last=Finch[/tpl] the company rewarded the smaller bids for shares in order to create as many shareholders as possible. A million shares were set aside for staff, which led to many staff members buying shares that shot up in value. Within one minute the list of applications was closed: £495 million had been offered for £14.5 million available shares. The Sainsbury family at the time retained 85% of the firm's shares. The feverish press that surrounded the flotation greatly enhanced the company's new dynamic image.
The company benefited, too, from a consistency of management stemming from family ownership and control. The fact that it did not go public until 1973 was not a disadvantage; unlike Tesco, Sainsbury's grew organically rather than by takeovers, and, at least during this period, did not need to use its shares as an acquisition currency. Sainsbury's had the advantage, shared to some extent by Tesco, of a strong market position in London and the South East.
Most of the senior positions were held by family members; John Davan Sainsbury (later Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover),[tpl]cite web |title=The Fourth Generation|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline/SainsburyArchive/Themes/People/Sainsburys/Fourthgeneration.htm|accessdate=15 November 2008[/tpl] a member of the fourth generation of the founding family, took over the chairmanship from his uncle Sir Robert Sainsbury in 1969, who had been chairman for two years from 1967 following Alan Sainsbury's retirement.
Sainsbury's started to replace its [tpl]convert|10000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] High Street stores with self-service supermarkets above [tpl]convert|20000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl], which were either in out-of-town locations or in regenerated town centres. Sainsbury's policy was to invest in uniform, well-designed stores with a strong emphasis on quality; its slogan was "good food costs less at Sainsbury's".[tpl]cite book |first=John|last=Kay|title=The Business of Economics Page 29|publisher=Oxford|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GwJSnuHLE6gC&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=%22good+food+costs+less+at+Sainsbury's%22.&source=web&ots=8uOLXajnq8&sig=YKj-lp75B5TchbwsDEjkv0-nawE&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl] During the 1970s the average size of Sainsbury's stores rose from [tpl]convert|10000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] to around [tpl]convert|18000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl]; the first edge-of-town store, with [tpl]convert|24000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] of selling space, was opened at Coldhams Lane in Cambridge in 1974. The last counter service branch closed in Peckham in 1982.[tpl]cite web |title=Evolution of the supermarket|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline/SainsburyArchive/Themes/Progress/Self-service/evolutionof+supermarket.htm|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl]
Although these larger stores contained some non-food items, they were not intended to match what Asda had been doing in the north; Sainsbury's focused more single-mindedly on food.
To participate in the hypermarket sector, Sainsbury's formed a joint venture, known as SavaCentre, with British Home Stores. The first SavaCentre store was opened in Washington, Tyne and Wear, in 1977;[tpl]cite web |title=London Roots|publisher=Sainsbury Archive|url=http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/Collections/CollectionsOnline/SainsburyArchive/Themes/Places/Expansion/|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl] nearly half the space, amounting to some [tpl]convert|35000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl], was devoted to textiles, electrical goods and hardware. As the hypermarket format became more mainstream, with rivals such as Asda and Tesco launching ever-larger stores, it was decided that a separate brand was no longer needed and the stores were converted to the regular Sainsbury's superstore format in 1999.[tpl]cite news |title=Sainsbury's plans new division|work=The Independent |location=UK |date=24 September 1999|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n14218861|accessdate=15 November 2008 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] This is in direct contrast to rival firms Tesco and Asda, which have been rapidly expanding their Tesco Extra and Asda Wal-Mart Supercentre hypermarket formats in recent years.
Another diversification took place in 1979, when Sainsbury's formed a joint venture with the Belgian retailer, GB-Inno-BM, to set up a chain of do-it-yourself stores under the Homebase name.[tpl]cite news |title=Retailers in the line of fire|work=The Independent |location=UK |date=25 July 2008|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20080725/ai_n27957864/pg_2|accessdate=11 November 2008 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The plan was to open a DIY store with a supermarket-style layout. Homebase was tripled in size in 1995 with the acquisition of the rival Texas Homecare from the Ladbroke Group plc. Sainsbury's sold the Homebase chain in December 2000 in a twofold deal worth £969 million. Sales of the chain of stores to venture capitalist Schroder Ventures generated £750 million and sale of 28 development sites, which had been earmarked for future Homebase stores, were sold for £219 million to rival B&Q's parent company, Kingfisher plc.[tpl]cite news |title=Sainsbury's sells Homebase|date=20 December 2000|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1082731.stm|accessdate=10 November 2008 | publisher=BBC News [/tpl]
The company's growth was still largely based on food, with only a modest contribution from the SavaCentre business (of which Sainsbury's took full control in 1989). There was, however, diversification outside the UK.
In November 1983 Sainsbury's purchased 21% of Shaw's Supermarkets, the second largest grocery group in the northeastern United States (primarily in New England). In June 1987, Sainsbury's acquired the rest of the company with the intention of creating a high-quality regional food retailing business based on the same principles as the UK-based operation.[tpl]cite news |title=Corporate Strategy in the UK Food Retailing 1980–2002 Page 7|publisher=|url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/seminarpapers/24-05-04%20-%20Background%20paper%20by%20Geoffrey%20Owen.pdf|accessdate=10 November 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080627171320/http://cep.lse.ac.uk/seminarpapers/24-05-04+-+Background+paper+by+Geoffrey+Owen.pdf  |archivedate = 27 June 2008[/tpl]
In 1985 the chairman reported that over the preceding ten years profits had grown from £15 million to over £168 million, a compound annual rise of 30.4% – after allowing for inflation a real annual growth rate of 17.6%.
During the 1980s the Company invested in new technology: the proportion of sales passing through EPOS scanning checkouts rose from 1% to 90%.
With the advent of out of town shopping complexes during the 1980s, Sainsbury's was one of the many big retail names to open new stores in such complexes – notably with its store at the Meadowhall Shopping Centre, Sheffield (originally as a SavaCentre) in 1990, which was converted into a regular Sainsbury store in 2005, and was closed in 2006 and the Merry Hill Shopping Centre at Brierley Hill in the West Midlands (part of an Enterprise Zone), which opened in September 1989 to replace a store in Dudley town centre. The success of the Merry Hill store, combined with the onset of the recession resulted in a fall in trade at the nearby store in Halesowen, which closed in 1992.
Sainsbury's expanded its operation into Scotland with a store in Darnley opening in January 1992, (the SavaCentre at Cameron Toll in Edinburgh had opened in 1984). In June 1995 Sainsbury's announced its intention to move into the Northern Ireland market, until that point dominated by local companies.[tpl]cite web | title = The sourcing in Northern Ireland of agricultural produce by national supermarkets and retailers | work=| publisher=Northern Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue | date = 23 January 1998 | url =http://www.ni-forum.gov.uk/reports/cr19.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =28 August 2006 [/tpl] Between December 1996 and December 1998 the company opened seven stores. Two others at Sprucefield, Lisburn and Holywood Exchange, Belfast would not open until 2003 due to protracted legal challenges. Sainsbury's move into Northern Ireland was undertaken in a very different way from that of Tesco. While Sainsbury's outlets were all new developments, Tesco (apart from one Tesco Metro) instead purchased existing chains from Associated British Foods (see Tesco Ireland).
In 1991, the group boasted a 12-year record of dividend increases of 20% or more and earnings per share had risen by as much for nearly as long.[tpl]cite news |title=Corporate Strategy in the UK Food Retailing 1980–2002 Page 14|publisher=|url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/seminarpapers/24-05-04%20-%20Background%20paper%20by%20Geoffrey%20Owen.pdf|accessdate=10 November 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080627171320/http://cep.lse.ac.uk/seminarpapers/24-05-04+-+Background+paper+by+Geoffrey+Owen.pdf  |archivedate = 27 June 2008[/tpl] Also in 1991 the company raised £489 million in new equity to fund the expansion of superstores.

===Sainsbury's decline (1992–1998)===

In 1992 the long-time CEO John Davan Sainsbury retired and was succeeded as chairman and chief executive by his cousin, David Sainsbury (later Lord Sainsbury of Turville); this brought about a change in management style – David was more consensual and less hierarchical but not in strategy or in corporate beliefs about the company's place in the market. Mistakes by David Sainsbury and his successors, Dino Adriano and Peter Davis, included the rejection of loyalty cards, the reluctance to move into non-food retailing, the indecision between whether to go quality or for value, "the sometimes brutal treatment of suppliers" which led to suppliers favouring Tesco over Sainsbury's and the unsuccessful John Cleese advertising campaign.[tpl]cite news|first =Patrick|last=Hosking|title=Rot set in at the family firm back in 1992|work=The Times|publisher=Times Newspapers|page = 48|date = 20 October 2004|accessdate =8 February 2007[/tpl]
At the end of 1993 it announced price cuts on 300 of its most popular own-label lines. Significantly, this came three months after Tesco had launched its Tesco Value line. A few months later Sainsbury's announced that margins had fallen, that the pace of new superstore construction would slow down, and that it would write down the value of some of its properties.
In 1994 Sainsbury's announced a new town-centre format, Sainsbury's Central, again a response to Tesco's Metro, which was already established in five locations. Also in 1994 Sainsbury's lost the takeover battle for William Low (like Tesco, Sainsbury's had long been under-represented in Scotland).[tpl]cite news|first =|last=|title=The Company file: a tale of two supermarkets |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/317325.stm |publisher=BBC News |page = |date = 12 April 1999|accessdate =10 November 2008[/tpl] Also that year David Sainsbury dismissed Tesco's clubcard initiative as 'an electronic version of Green Shield Stamps'; the company was soon forced to backtrack, introducing its own Reward Card 18 months later.[tpl]cite news|first =|last=|title=Report on Tesco|url=http://profesores.ie.edu/enrique_dans/TESCO/TESCO.pdf |work=|publisher=|page = |accessdate =10 November 2008[/tpl]
For much of the 20th century Sainsbury's had been the market leader in the UK supermarket sector, but in 1996 it lost its place as the UK's largest grocer to Tesco.[tpl]cite news|first =|last=|title=The bluffer's guide: Sainsbury's |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n14044252|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent Newspapers|page = |date = 5 May 1996|accessdate =9 November 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Some new ventures were successful, notably the launch of a retail bank, Sainsbury's Bank, in partnership with Bank of Scotland.[tpl]cite news|first =|last=|title=Sainsbury's opens bank with high rate for savers|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n14096852|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent Newspapers|page = |date = 20 February 1997|accessdate =9 November 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In addition to Shaw's, Sainsbury's bought a minority stake in another supermarket group, Giant Food, based in Washington DC,[tpl]cite news|first =Kenneth N.|last=Gilpin|title=Sainsburys buys stake in Giant Food|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E2DF153DF937A35753C1A962958260 |work=The New York Times|publisher=|page = |date = 4 October 1994|accessdate =9 November 2008[/tpl] although this shareholding was subsequently sold when Ahold of the Netherlands made a full bid for the company.
Sainsbury's also trebled the size of its Homebase do-it-yourself business in 1996 by merging its business with Texas Homecare, which it acquired from Ladbroke for £290 million.[tpl]cite news|first =|last=|title=Sainsbury's tipped to buy Texas|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n9636430 |work=The Independent|publisher=Independent Newspapers|page = |date = 14 January 1996|accessdate =9 November 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In addition to expansion of larger formats and banking services, Sainsbury's decided to provide shopping services to small towns, which led to the construction of "Country Town" stores. These were small supermarkets which enabled large villages to get their weekly shopping without travelling to large out of town stores. These "Country Town" stores were opened mainly across the south east which is historically Sainsbury's strongest market. Potential sites were identified and finally stores were opened in Attleborough and Chipping Ongar(Essex) towards the end of 1998. The "Country Town" format may now be discontinued but the stores which were completed have now been brought up to standard with the rest of the company's portfolio and continue to trade strongly even with many having larger stores within 10 minutes travel from the ""Country Town" stores.
In 1996 the company reported its first fall in profits for 22 years. David Sainsbury announced management changes, involving the appointment of two chief executives, one in charge of UK supermarkets (Dino Adriano) and the other responsible for Homebase and the US (David Bremner).[tpl]cite news|first =|last=|title=Sainsbury's profit slump sparks plan for aggression|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n14044961|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent Newspapers|page = |date = 9 May 1996|accessdate =9 November 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Finally, in 1998, David Sainsbury himself resigned from the company to pursue a career in politics.[tpl]cite news|first =Deborah|last=Summers|title=Science minister resigns|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/nov/10/immigrationpolicy.research|work=The Guardian|publisher=|page = |date = 10 November 2006|accessdate =9 November 2008 | location=London[/tpl] He was succeeded as non-executive chairman by George Bull, who had been chairman of Diageo,[tpl]cite news|first =|last=|title=Raise a glass to research|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2906524/Fifty-lessons-Raise-a-glass-to-research.html|work=The Telegraph|publisher=|page = |date = 23 February 2005|accessdate =9 November 2008 | location=London[/tpl] and Adriano was promoted to be Group Chief Executive.[tpl]cite news|first =|last=|title=Profile of Dino Adriano|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20974260.html|work=The Grocer|publisher=|page = |date = 25 July 1998|accessdate =9 November 2008[/tpl]

===The brand re-launch (1998–2003)===

In June 1998 Sainsbury's unveiled its new corporate identity, which was developed by M&C Saatchi, which consisted of the current company logo, new corporate colours of "living orange" and blue, Interstate as the company's new general use lowercase font from the old all uppercase font, the new slogan "Making life taste better", which replaced its old slogan from the 1960s and new staff uniforms.[tpl]cite news| first = Alexandra| last = Jardine| title = Sainsbury's overhauls its image for fightback| work=Marketing| publisher=Haymarket Publishing Services| date = 10 June 1999| accessdate =7 March 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news| first = Kathy| last = Marks| title = Dowdy Sainsbury to rebuild image| work=The Independent| publisher=Newspaper Publishing| page = 4| date = 3 June 1999| accessdate =7 March 2007[/tpl] The strapline was dropped in May 2005 and replaced in September of that year by "Try something new today." This new brand statement was created by Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO. While the Interstate font was used almost exclusively for many years, the company introduced another informal font in 2005 which is used in a wide range of advertising and literature. Since 2013 it is now "Live well for less", the design has varied on the receipts.
In 1999 Sainsbury's acquired an 80.1% share of Egyptian Distribution Group SAE, a retailer in Egypt with 100 stores and 2,000 employees.

Between 2000–2004, Sir Peter Davis was chief executive of Sainsbury's. Davis' appointment was well received by investors and analysts.[tpl]cite news|first= Saeed |last= Shah|title= Sir Peter Davis brought back to take helm at Sainsbury's|work=The Independent|publisher=Newspaper Publishing|page= 19|date= 15 January 2000|accessdate=8 February 2007[/tpl] The appointment was only confirmed after Sainsbury's was sure of the support of the Sainsbury family, who snubbed Davis' offer of becoming chief executive in the early 1990s, following which he became Chief Executive of Prudential plc.
In his first two years he exceeded profit targets, although by 2004 the group had suffered a decline in performance relative to its competitors and was demoted to third in the UK grocery market. Davis also oversaw an almost £3 billion upgrade of stores, distribution and IT equipment, entitled 'Business Transformation Programme', but his successor would later reveal that much of this investment was wasted and he failed in his key goal – improving availability. Part of this investment saw the construction of four fully automated depots, which at £100 million each cost four times more than standard depots.[tpl]cite news |first=Abigail|last=Townsend|title=How the 'Newbury process' turned Sainsbury's round |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20060423/ai_n16212212 |work=The Independent on Sunday |publisher=Independent Newspapers |date=23 April 2006 |accessdate=8 February 2007 [/tpl]
In 2001, Sainsbury's moved into its current headquarters at Holborn, London. Sainsbury's previously occupied Stamford House and 12 other buildings around Southwark. However the accounting department remained separate at Streatham. The building was designed by architectural firm Foster and Partners and had been developed on the former Mirror Group site for Andersen Consulting (now Accenture), however Sainsbury's acquired the 25-year lease when Accenture pulled out.[tpl]cite news |first=Nigel|last=Cope|title=Sainsbury's looks to sell HQ for £100m after move to Holborn Circus |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/sainsburys-looks-to-sell-hq-for-pound100m-after-move-to-holborn-circus-627769.html |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent Newspapers |date=9 December 2000 |accessdate=9 November 2008 | location=London[/tpl]
Sainsbury's is a founding member of the Nectar loyalty card scheme, which was launched in late 2002 in conjunction with Debenhams, Barclaycard and BP.Since then both Debenhams and Barclaycard have left the scheme.

In 2003 Wm Morrison Supermarkets (trading as Morrisons) made an offer for the Safeway group, prompting a bidding war between the major supermarkets. The Trade and Industry Secretary, Patricia Hewitt, referred the various bids to the Competition Commission which reported its findings on 26 September. The Commission found that all bids, with the exception of Morrison's, would "operate against the public interest". As part of the approval Morrison's was to dispose of 53 of the combined group's stores. In May 2004 Sainsbury's announced that it would acquire 14 of these stores (13 Safeway stores and 1 Morrison's outlet) located primarily in the Midlands and the North of England.[tpl]cite news |first=Susie|last=Mesure|title=Sainsbury's buys 14 supermarkets from Morrisons |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/sainsburys-buys-14-supermarkets-from-morrisons-563478.html|work=The Independent |publisher=|date=15 May 2004 |accessdate=9 November 2008 | location=London[/tpl]

==='Making Sainsbury's Great Again' (2004–2006)===

At the end of March 2004 Davis was promoted to chairman and was replaced as CEO by Justin King. King joined Sainsbury's in from Marks and Spencer plc where he was a director with responsibility for its food division and Kings Super Markets, Inc. subsidiary in the United States.[tpl]cite press release | title =Sainsbury's appoints new Group Chief Executive | publisher=J Sainsbury plc | date =19 November 2003 | url =http://www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/index.asp?PageID=418&subsection=&Year=2003&NewsID=374 | accessdate =28 October 2006[/tpl] Schooled in Solihull and a graduate of the University of Bath, where he took a business administration degree, King was also previously a managing director at Asda with responsibility for hypermarkets. In June 2004 Davis was forced to quit in the face of an impending shareholder revolt over his salary and bonuses. Investors were angered by a bonus share award of over £2 million despite poor company performance. On 19 July 2004 Davis' replacement, Philip Hampton, was appointed as chairman.[tpl]cite news |first=|last=|title=Sainsbury retreats on boss's bonus|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3877373.stm|publisher=BBC News  |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=9 November 2008 [/tpl]
King ordered a direct mail campaign to 1 million Sainsbury's customers as part of his 6-month business review asking them what they wanted from the company and where the company could improve. This reaffirmed the commentary of retail analysts – the group was not ensuring that shelves are fully stocked, this due to the failure of the IT systems introduced by Peter Davis. On 19 October 2004 King unveiled the results of the business review and his plans to revive the company's fortunes – in a three-year recovery plan entitled 'Making Sainsbury's Great Again'.[tpl]cite news | title =Sainsbury's heads back to basics | publisher=BBC News | date =19 October 2004 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3755066.stm | accessdate =9 October 2008[/tpl] This was generally well received by both the stock market and the media. Immediate plans included laying off 750 headquarters staff and the recruitment of around 3,000 shop-floor staff to improve the quality of service and the firm's main problem: stock availability. The aim would be to increase sales revenue by £2.5 billion by the financial year ending March 2008. Another significant announcement was the halving of the dividend to increase funds available for price cuts and quality.
King hired Lawrence Christensen as supply chain director in 2004. Previously he was an expert in logistics at Safeway, but left following its takeover by Morrisons. Immediate supply chain improvements included the reactivation of two distribution centres. In 2006 Christensen commented on the four automated depots introduced by Davis, saying "not a single day went by without one, if not all of them, breaking down... The systems were flawed. They have to stop for four hours every day for maintenance. But because they were constantly breaking down you would be playing catch up. It was a vicious circle." Christensen said a fundamental mistake was to build four such depots at once, rather than building one which could be thoroughly tested before progressing with the others.[tpl]cite news |first=Sarah |last=Butler|title=Sainsbury's takes stock of itself after a year of tents and bunkers|work=The Times|publisher=Times Newspapers |date=8 October 2005|accessdate=8 February 2007[/tpl] At the time of the business review on 19 October 2004, referring to the availability problems, Justin King said "Lawrence hadn't seen anything that he hadn't seen before. He just hadn't seen them all in the same place at the same time". In 2007 Sainsbury's announced a further £12 million investment in its depots to keep pace with sales growth and the removal of the failed automated systems from its depots.[tpl]cite news |first = Sarah |last = Butler|title = Sainsbury's to revamp depots as sales grow faster than forecast|url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9074-2543269,00.html|work=The Times|publisher=Times Newspapers|page = |date = 12 January 2007|accessdate =9 February 2007 | location=London[/tpl] In addition, it did a deal with IBM to upgrade its Electronic – Point of Sale systems as a result of increased sales.

===Takeover bids (2007)===

On 2 February 2007, after months of speculation about a private equity bid, CVC Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and Blackstone Group announced that they were considering a bid for Sainsbury's.[tpl]cite news| title = Bid talk lifts Sainsbury's shares| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6323371.stm| publisher=BBC News | date = 2 February 2007| accessdate =23 April 2007[/tpl] The consortium grew to include Goldman Sachs and Texas Pacific Group. On 6 March 2007, with a formal bid yet to be tabled, the Takeover Panel issued a bid deadline of 13 April.[tpl]cite news| first = Neelam| last = Verjee| coauthors = Hawkes, Steve; Seib, Christine| title = Tchenguiz buys 3% Sainsbury's stake as consortium is hurried| url =| work=The Times| publisher=Times Newspapers| page = 48| date = 7 March 2007| accessdate =23 April 2007[/tpl]
On 4 April KKR left the consortium to focus on its bid for Alliance Boots.[tpl]cite news| first = Tom| last = Braithwaite et al.| title = Private equity bid founders on family| work=Financial Times| page = 15| date = 14 April 2007| accessdate =23 April 2007[/tpl] On 5 April the consortium submitted an "indicative offer" of 562p a share to the company's board. After discussions between Sir Philip Hampton and the two largest Sainsbury family shareholders Lord Sainsbury of Turville and Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover the offer was rejected. On 9 April the indicative offer was raised to 582p a share, however this too was rejected. This meant the consortium could not satisfy its own preconditions for a bid, most importantly 75% shareholder support; the combined Sainsbury family holding at the time was 18%.[tpl]cite news| first = Sarah| last = Butler| title = CVC withdraws £10 billion offer for Sainsbury's| url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/retailing/article1640537.ece| work=The Times| publisher=Times Newspapers| date = 11 April 2007| accessdate =23 April 2007 | location=London[/tpl]
Lord Sainsbury of Turville, who then held 7.75% of Sainsbury's, stated that he could see no reason why the Sainsbury's board would even consider opening its books for due diligence for anything less than 600p per share.[tpl]cite news| first =James| last =Moore| title = Sainsbury family intervenes in bid| url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/sainsbury-family-intervenes-in-bid-443624.html| work=The Independent| publisher=| date = 6 April 2007| accessdate =11 November 2008 | location=London[/tpl] Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, with just under 3%, was more extreme than his cousin, and refused to sell at any price.[tpl]cite news| first =| last =| title = Sainsbury deadlock as family holds out| url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/eecce54a-e6ff-11db-9034-000b5df10621.html| work=Financial Times| publisher=| date = 10 April 2007| accessdate =11 November 2008[/tpl] He believed any offer at that stage of Sainsbury's recovery was likely to undervalue the business, and with private equity seeking high returns on their investments, saw no reason to sell, given that the current management, led by Justin King, could deliver the extra profit generated for the benefit of existing investors.[tpl]cite news| first =| last =| title = Sainsbury must now justify the revaluation which private equity bid has sparked| url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/jeremy-warners-outlook-sainsbury-must-now-justify-the-revaluation-which-the-private-equity-bid-has-sparked-444335.html| work=The Independent| publisher=| date = 12 April 2007| accessdate =11 November 2008 | location=London[/tpl] He claimed the bid 'brought nothing to the business', and that high levels of debt would significantly weaken the company and its competitive position in the long-term, which would have an adverse effect on Sainsbury's stakeholders.[tpl]cite news| first =Harry| last =Wallop| title = Lord Sainsbury speaks out over equity bid| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2807202/Lord-Sainsbury-speaks-out-over-equity-bid.html | work=The Telegraph| publisher=| date = 13 April 2007| accessdate =11 November 2008 | location=London[/tpl]
On 11 April the CVC-led consortium abandoned its offer, stating "it became clear the consortium would be unable to make a proposal that would result in a successful offer."
In May 2007 Sainsbury's identified five areas of growth: Growth of non-food ranges; opening of new convenience stores and growth of online home delivery and banking operations; Expansion of supermarket space through new stores and development of the company's "largely underdeveloped store portfolio"; and "active property management".[tpl]cite web| title=Corporate overview|url=http://www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/index.asp?pageid=12| publisher=Sainsbury's | accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl]
On 25 April 2007 Delta Two, a Qatari investment company, bought a 14% stake in Sainsbury's causing its share price to rise 7.17%, which was then upped to 17.6%. Their interest in Sainsbury's is thought to centre on its property portfolio. They increased their stake to 25% in June 2007.[tpl]cite news | title =Huge share deal lifts Sainsbury's | publisher=BBC News | date =25 April 2007 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6590879.stm | accessdate =9 November 2008[/tpl]

The family had reservations about the price of the bid.

==Leaders==

==Values==

Sainsbury's has two sets of values (company and colleague) that it claims provide the framework of its business and are used in decision making and day-to-day activity. It also has a single vision and a goal.
To be the most trusted retailer where people love to work and shop
We will make all our customers' lives easier every day by offering great quality and services at fair prices

==20x20 Sustainability Plan==

In October 2012 Sainsbury's announced a 'deliberately stretching' corporate responsibility and sustainability programme to achieve 20 goals by the year 2020. Sainsbury's describes the award winning plan as 'far enough ahead to be genuinely visionary and stretching, close enough for us to act now'. The goals relate to the companies core values, can be achieved at anytime and may permit and even require collaboration. Colleagues are frequently rewarded whenever the company achieves a goal.
