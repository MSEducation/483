[[Art group]]

CATEGORIES: Artist groups and collectives

An art group refers to an association of artists who may work (or live) communally, for the purpose of facilitating the creation of art, either that belonging to the individual, or the collective. 
Art groups typically were formed by established artists, such as Andy Warhol, as hired assistants to the artist, operating collectively under the artist's studio. More recently, art groups have been formed by unknown artists, pooling their limited resources toward the collective goal.
Groups have formed as political action groups, to work on political advocacy projects, while other groups formed simply for reasons of working and living in an environment conducive to the peculiar interests of artists. In this context, some groups began to create collective works of art, music, writing, etc., under the name of their group.
