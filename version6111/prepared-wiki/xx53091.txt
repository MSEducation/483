Fleiss was a popular and sought-after pediatrician in the Los Angeles area, both among poor and middle-class patients living near his Los Feliz office and among Southern California celebrities. Fleiss is a breastfeeding and anti-circumcision advocate, recommends but does not insist upon childhood vaccination, and has stated that he could be "convinced either way" as to whether HIV causes AIDS. In 1994, Fleiss pled guilty to conspiracy and bank fraud in relation to his daughter Heidi Fleiss' prostitution ring.
== History == 
Fleiss initially trained as a pharmacist and osteopath.  He relocated from Detroit to California to take advantage of 1962 legislation allowing an osteopath to convert his degree to an MD.[tpl]cite news |title=Did Father Know Best? Paul Fleiss was everyone's favorite baby doctor and the perfect dad of six of his own. So how did he end up facing a federal rap with his daughter Heidi? |url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1995-04-09/magazine/tm-52712_1_heidi-fleiss |date=April 9, 1995 |work=Los Angeles Times | first = Shawn | last = Hubler[/tpl]  He earned his B.S. in pharmacy from Wayne State University, his D.O. from the University of California, Irvine, and his M.P.H. from the University of California, Los Angeles.
Fleiss is the father of "Hollywood madam" Heidi Fleiss. In 1994, Fleiss pled guilty to charges of conspiracy and bank fraud.  He helped Heidi launder hundreds of thousands of dollars by lying on her loan application and falsely claiming that she was an employee of his medical practice. He was sentenced to one day in prison and community service. Following the felony convictions, the Medical Board of California placed him on probation for 1 year and publicly reprimanded him for "unprofessional conduct" and "dishonesty".
Fleiss was the subject of a 1996 made-for-TV movie entitled "The Good Doctor: The Paul Fleiss Story". In it, Fleiss (played by Michael Gross) was portrayed sympathetically, as the victim of his daughter Heidi's machinations. The New York Times noted that "the sweeping inaccuracies in 'The Good Doctor: The Paul Fleiss Story' evidently didn't hurt its ratings", and the film was subsequently retitled "The Making of a Hollywood Madam" and shown on cable television.[tpl]cite news | work = New York Times | title = The Good Doctor: The Paul Fleiss Story | accessdate = April 12, 2012 | url = http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/412765/The-Good-Doctor-The-Paul-Fleiss-Story/overview[/tpl]
