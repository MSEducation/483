[[Lord of Misrule]]

CATEGORIES: European folklore, European court festivities

In England, the Lord of Misrule — known in Scotland as the Abbot of Unreason and in France as the Prince des Sots — was an officer appointed by lot at Christmas to preside over the Feast of Fools. The Lord of Misrule was generally a peasant or sub-deacon appointed to be in charge of Christmas revelries, which often included drunkenness and wild partying, in the pagan tradition of Saturnalia.
The Church held a similar festival involving a Boy Bishop. This custom was abolished by Henry VIII in 1541, restored by the Catholic Queen Mary I and again abolished by Protestant Elizabeth I, though here and there it lingered on for some time longer.Tudor Christmas, The Anne Boleyn Files On the Continent it was suppressed by the Council of Basle in 1431, but was revived in some places from time to time, even as late as the eighteenth century.
While mostly known as a British holiday custom, the appointment of a Lord of Misrule comes from antiquity. In ancient Rome, from the 17th to the 23rd of December, a Lord of Misrule was appointed for the feast of Saturnalia, in the guise of the good god Saturn. During this time the ordinary rules of life were subverted as masters served their slaves, and the offices of state were held by slaves. The Lord of Misrule presided over all of this, and had the power to command anyone to do anything during the holiday period. This holiday seems to be the precursor to the more modern holiday, and it carried over into the Christian era.
In the Tudor period the Lord of Misrule is mentioned a number of times by contemporary documents referring to both revels at court and among the ordinary people.[tpl]cite web|last=John|first=Stow|title=A Survey of London (1603)|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=60025|work=British History Online|accessdate=16 October 2013[/tpl] [tpl]cite book|last=Hadfield|first=Miles & John|title=The Twelve Days of Christmas|year=1961|publisher=Cassell|location=London|pages=134-135[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|last=Higginbotham|first=Susan|title=The Lord of Misrule Comes to Court: 1551/52|url=http://www.susanhigginbotham.com/blog/posts/the-lord-of-misrule-comes-to-court-155152/|accessdate=16 October 2013[/tpl] 

==History==

On January 1, A.D. 400, the bishop Asterius of Amasea in Pontus (Amasya, Turkey) preached a sermon against the Feast of Calends ("this foolish and harmful delight") that describes the role of the Lord of Misrule in Late Antiquity. The New Years feast included children arriving at each doorstep, exchanging their gifts for reward:[ref]
