[[Palierne equation]]

CATEGORIES: Non-Newtonian fluids, Colloidal chemistry, Composite materials

Palierne equation connects the dynamic modulus of emulsions with the dynamic modulus of the two phases, size of the droplets and the interphase surface tension. The equation can also be used for suspensions of viscoelastic solid particles in viscoelastic fluids.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1002/pen.21065 |last=Pal |first=Rajinder |title=A New Viscoelastic Model for Emulsions and Suspensions|journal=Polymer Engineering and Science |volume=48 |date=July 2008 |issue=7  |pages=1250..1253[/tpl] The equation is named after French rheologist Jean-François Palierne who has proposed the equation in 1991.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01331356 |last=Palierne |first=Jean-François |title=Linear Rheology of viscoelastic emulsions with interfacial tension|journal=Rheologica Acta |volume=29 |issue=3 |year=1991 |pages=204[/tpl]
For the dilute emulsions Palierne equation looks like:
