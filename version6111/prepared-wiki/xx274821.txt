Barbara, also referred to as Bilad al-Barbar (Land of the Berbers), was an ancient region on the northern coast of the Somalia. The area was inhabited by the Eastern Baribah or Barbaroi (Berbers), as the ancestors of the Somalis were referred to by medieval Arab and ancient Greek geographers, respectively.[tpl]cite book|last=Raunig|first=Walter|title=Afrikas Horn: Akten der Ersten Internationalen Littmann-Konferenz 2. bis 5.

Correspondingly almost all these terms (or as I believe: all of them!) also appear in ancient and medieval Chinese geography[/tpl]F.R.C.

Along with the neighboring Habash (Abyssinians) of al-Habash, the Barbaroi are recorded in the 1st century Greek document the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as engaging in extensive commercial exchanges with Egypt and pre-Islamic Arabia. The travelogue mentions the Barbaroi trading frankincense, among various other commodities, through their port cities such as Avalites (modern Zeila). Competent seamen, the Periplus' author also indicates that they sailed throughout the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for trade. The document describes the Barbaroi's system of governance as decentralized, and essentially consisting of a collection of autonomous city-states.Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, Culture and Customs of Somalia, (Greenwood Press, 2001), pp.13-14 It also suggests that "the Berbers who live in the place are very unruly",Wilfred Harvey Schoff, The Periplus of the Erythræan sea: travel and trade in the Indian Ocean, (Longmans, Green, and Co., 1912) p.25 an apparent reference to their independent streak.
