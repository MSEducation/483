[[UEFA Euro 2004 knockout stage]]

CATEGORIES: UEFA Euro 2004

The UEFA Euro 2004 knockout stage was a single-elimination tournament involving the eight teams that qualified from the group stage of the tournament. There were three rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round, culminating in the final to decide the champions.
Any game in the knockout stage that was undecided by the end of the regular 90 minutes, was followed by up to 30 minutes of extra time (two 15-minute halves). For the first time in an international football tournament, the silver goal system was applied, whereby the team who leads the game at the half-time break during the extra time period would be declared the winner.
If the scores were still level after the initial 15 minutes of extra time play would continue for a further 15 minutes. If the teams could still not be separated there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each, and more if necessary) to determine who progressed to the next round.
The knockout stage began with the quarter-finals on 24 June and ended with the final on 4 July 2004 at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon. Greece won the tournament with a 1–0 victory over the host nation Portugal.
