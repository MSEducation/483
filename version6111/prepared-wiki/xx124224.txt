The Honda CB77, or Super Hawk, was a [tpl]Convert|305|cc|abbr=on[/tpl] vertical twin motorcycle produced from 1961 until 1967. It is remembered today as Honda's first sportbike. It is a landmark model in Honda's advances in Western motorcycle markets of the 1960s,Schilling, Phil. "The hawk above, the crud below." Cycle World Apr. 1999: 72+. General OneFile.

==Characteristics==

The CB77 had, at only 305cc, a relatively big engine in comparison to most other Japanese bikes of the period, although it had performance to rival much larger motorcycles from other countries.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] It quickly built a reputation for reliability, and was equipped with luxuries such as an electric starter.
The CB77 was built on the experience Honda had gained in Grand Prix racing, and differed greatly from previous models.[tpl]which|date=August 2013[/tpl] It had a steel-tube frame instead of the pressed frames of earlier Hondas, and a telescopic front fork. The parallel twin engine (the biggest then available in a Honda) was an integral element of the bike's structure, providing stiffness in a frame that had no downtube, and was capable of 9,000 rpm. It could propel the bike at over 100Â mph; as fast as British parallel twins with higher displacements, and with great reliability. It is now regarded as 'the first modern Japanese motorcycle...that established the motorcycle paradigm that we still operate under now, more than forty years later.'[tpl]cite book|last=Frank|first=Aaron|title=Honda Motorcycles|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CSxTaoGagKoC&pg=PA59|accessdate=5 December 2012|date=2003-05-01|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=9780760310779|page=59[/tpl]

Honda also produced a lower-powered [tpl]Convert|247|cc|abbr=on[/tpl] version called the CB72 Hawk, which otherwise had the same specifications. In 1962, Honda introduced an off-road bike, the CL72 250 Scrambler, with the same engine as the Hawk but with a different, full-cradle frame with a skid plate and other adjustments for off-road use. In 1965, the CL77 305 Scrambler appeared, with the (bigger) engine of the Super Hawk but otherwise similar to the CL72.
