==Plot synopsis==

The book focuses on a young girl as her mother undergoes abdominoplasty and rhinoplasty. The book is intended to help parents who have chosen to have plastic surgery explain their children the process of their surgery.

==Controversy==

My Beautiful Mommy has been criticized for depicting cosmetic surgery and for a line that suggests that mommy's new nose will "be prettier."[tpl]cite web|last=G.|first=Jessica|title=My Beautiful Mommy Teaches Kids Why Mommy’s Face Is Suddenly "Prettier"|url=http://jezebel.com/380481/my-beautiful-mommy-teaches-kids-why-mommys-face-is-suddenly-prettier|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=November 20, 2011|date=April 16, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Reist|first=Melinda Tankard|title=The pornification of girlhood|journal=Quadrant (magazine)|date=Jul–Aug 2008|volume=52|issue=7-8|page=13|url=http://proxy.library.vcu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,url,cookie,uid&db=hlh&AN=33517898&site=ehost-live&scope=site|accessdate=19 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Alter|first=Cathy|title='My Beautiful Mommy': How a Picture Book Explains Liposuction to Kids|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/03/my-beautiful-mommy-how-a-picture-book-explains-liposuction-to-kids/73051/|accessdate=19 February 2014|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=Mar 26, 2011[/tpl] Child psychologist Elizabeth Berger has noted that while an explanatory book will be helpful for children, it "can be difficult for small kids to understand".[tpl]cite web|first=Karen |last=Springen |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/04/14/mommy-2-0.html |title=Mommy 2.0 |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=April 14, 2008 |accessdate=November 19, 2011[/tpl]
Salzhauer has responded to the criticisms by saying "The book just goes toward trying to make the process as understandable as possible for the kids, so they can feel included and don't have to make things up in their minds on what's going on"[tpl]cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/24187476#.TqkcXfSSFDU |title=Children's book takes on mom's plastic surgery |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Today |date=April 23, 2008 |accessdate=November 19, 2011[/tpl] and "This book was written with the best of intentions. It wasn’t trying to corrupt society. It is not glamorizing plastic surgery. It is not intended to be a best seller that children read with their parents before they go to sleep."[tpl]cite web|last=Bierly|first=Mandi|title=My beautiful, scarring-me-forever mommy?|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2008/04/18/my-beautiful-mo/|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=November 20, 2011|date=April 18, 2008[/tpl]
