Fago imitated his own character by creating Atomic Rabbit (a.k.a. Atomic Bunny) and Atom the Cat, both of whom had costumes and powers similar to those of Atomic Mouse.

==2000s revival==

In 2001, Shanda Fantasy Arts licensed the character and gave him a new origin.  The City of Rodentia is menaced by an asteroid, so Professor LaSerne invents a machine to bring a drawing to life, and uses an old copy of Atomic Mouse comics.  The new redesigned Atomic Mouse stops the asteroid, and takes up life on his new planet.  He enters into a romantic relationship with Lil Mouse (a mouse of color) who draws his comic book.  A backup feature was about the Legion of Almost Villains, who were always trying to make a reputation for themselves by defeating Atomic Mouse, who was unaware of them.  In issue #3, Atomic Mouse met the Atomic Mouse of the old Charlton Comics.  And in a one-shot, Atomic Mouse vs. Power Jack and the Lost Menagerie, Atomic Mouse meets and helps a thinly disguised Captain Carrot and his Amazing Zoo Crew from DC Comics.
