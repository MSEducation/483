[[Collett School]]

CATEGORIES: Special schools in Hertfordshire, Hemel Hempstead, Community schools in Hertfordshire

The Collett School is unique in Hertfordshire, being the only Moderate Learning Difficulties school to have both primary and secondary pupils. We have 120 pupils between the ages of 4 and 16, each having complex needs.
The Collett School is a purpose-built special school, designed and built in the 1960s. We are situated on a hill with great views across Hemel Hempstead. We have a large field and several well-kept playgrounds that enable our pupils to play safely and imaginatively.
Reception to Year 6 pupils work predominantly in their own classrooms. Years 7-11 have a designated form room and move from room to room according to their timetable. Our curriculum is being adapted for 2012 and some pupls will have fewer transitions in the day.
Secondary teaching rooms are designated for one or two subjects. There are specialist rooms for art/design & technology, for food/textiles, science, music and a well-equipped ICT room. The school has high-speed broadband internet facilities. All the main teaching areas have interactive whiteboards and terminal PCs.
There is a library used by the whole school and the School Hall is used for PE, lunch, school assemblies and drama productions.
The "O2" is a classroom for supporting pupils with additional needs which has a sensory room, soft play equipment and resources for supporting pupils' social and educational development.
The current Headteacher of the school is Mr Stephen Hoult-Allen.
