[[Flow table test]]

CATEGORIES: Concrete

The flow table test or flow test is a method to determine the consistence of fresh concrete.
Application 
When fresh concrete is delivered to a site by a truck mixer it is sometimes necessary to check its consistence before pouring it into formwork.
If the consistence is not correct, the concrete will not have the desired qualities once it has set, particularly the desired strength. If the concrete is too pasty, it may result in cavities within the concrete which leads to corrosion of the rebar, eventually leading to the formation of cracks (as the rebar expands as it corrodes) which will accelerate the whole process, rather like insufficient concrete cover. Cavities will also lower the stress the concrete is able to support.
