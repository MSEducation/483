The Coats (sometimes called the Coats vocal band) are an a cappella singing group based along the west coast of the United States and originated in Seattle, Washington. It consists of bass singer Kerry Dahlen, baritone Doug Wisness, and Jamie Dieveney and Keith Michael Anderson as second and first tenors, respectively.

==History==

The group was formed in 1987, while each of its four members were studying at the University of Washington. They began singing unprofessionally around Seattle, at such locations as Pike Place Market, to pay their way through college. However, their unique singing style attracted attention, and they were soon singing professionally throughout the west coast and elsewhere.

===Name change===

The Coats were originally known as "The Trenchcoats," but following the Columbine High School massacre, they became unintentionally associated with the Trenchcoat Mafia. Numerous news reports erroneously provided the singing group's web address as that of the killers, so it was quickly simplified to their group's current name.

==Discography==

The Coats have released two demos & eleven albums as of December 2011:
