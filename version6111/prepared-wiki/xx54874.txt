[[Diabolo]]

CATEGORIES: Juggling props, Circus skills

The diabolo (commonly misspelled as diablo) is a juggling prop consisting of an axle and two cups or discs. This object is spun using a string attached to two hand sticks. A huge variety of tricks are possible using the diabolo which can include throws, various types of spinning and interactions with the sticks, string, and various body parts. Multiple diabolos can be spun on a single string.
Diabolos come in different shapes and materials. 

==History and etymology==

Diabolos evolved from the Chinese yo-yo, which was originally standardized in the 12th century.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] chinese yo-yos have a long thin axle, with disc-shaped wheels, while the western diabolo is more cone-shaped. Diabolos are made of different materials and come in different sizes and weights.
The term "diabolo" was not taken from the Italian word for "devil"—"diavolo"—but was coined by French engineer Gustave Phillippart, who developed the modern diabolo in the early twentieth century,Encyclopædia Britannica, 1958 ed. and derived the name from the Greek dia bolo, roughly meaning 'across throw'.
The Greek word "diabolos" means "the liar" or "the one that commits perjury", from the verb "diaballo", which means "to throw in", "to generate confusion", "to divide", or "to make someone fall".
Later the word "diabolos" was used by Christian writers as "the liar that speaks against God". From this meaning come many modern languages' words for "devil" (French: diable, Italian: diavolo, Spanish: diablo, Portuguese: diabo, German: Teufel, Polish: diabeł).
Confusion about the provenance of the name may have arisen from the earlier name "the devil on two sticks", although nowadays this often also refers to another circus-based skill toy, the devil stick.

==Design==

The design of diabolos has varied through history and across the world. Chinese diabolos have been made of bamboo. Wooden diabolos were common in Victorian times in Britain. Rubber diabolos were first patented by Gustave Phillippart in 1905. [tpl]cite web|title=Diabolo Patent|url=http://www.google.co.uk/patents/US822628|accessdate=16 July 2013[/tpl] In the late twentieth century a rubberised plastic material was first used. Metal has also been used especially for fire diabolos.
The size and weight of diabolos varies. Diabolos with more weight tend to retain their momentum for longer, whereas small, light diabolos can be thrown higher and are easier to accelerate to high speeds. Rubber diabolos are less prone to breakage yet are more prone to deformations.  More commonly used are plastic-rubber hybrids that allow flex but hold their shape. One-sided diabolos are also available but are more difficult to use. For beginners diabolos of a diameter of min 9 cm are recommended.

==Basic principles==

The most basic act of diabolo manipulation is to cause the spool to spin while it is suspended from the string. This is commonly achieved by dragging the string across the axle in such a way that the friction causes the spool to roll. By repeatedly lifting one of the handsticks while providing slack with the other the speed of rotation of the spool can be increased as the spool "rolls" down the string. The lifting hand is typically the user's dominant hand. This method is known as acceleration.
Further increases in speed are obtained by a variety of techniques, including power whips; accelerations, such as Chinese wip thrusts and loop acceleration; power burners; and orbit tricks.
Once speed is built up, the diaboloist typically performs a routine based on various advanced tricks outlined below. The best diaboloists can work these tricks smoothly and also accelerate keeping the diabolo in a constant motion without having to pause to speed up the spin again. The diabolo will stay balanced as long as there is speed.

==Tricks and styles==

===Fundamental tricks===

The following are considered fundamental/basic Diabolo tricks [tpl]citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]

===Advanced tricks===

There are countless tricks and variations that fall outside the above categories; these are often more difficult and form the cutting edge of modern diabolo routines. Some examples are:

===Multiple diabolos===

Perhaps the most active area of development for diabolo performance involves tricks with more than one diabolo on a single string. When manipulating multiple diabolos "low", the diabolos orbit continuously on the string in a "shuffle." Shuffles are either synchronous (commonly referred to as "sync") or asynchronous ("async"), depending on whether the diaboloist's hands' movements occur simultaneously or not; shuffles may also be performed with only one hand.
Juggling multiple diabolos "high" involves continuously catching and throwing a number of diabolos, never with more than one diabolo on the string simultaneously. Diaboloists have pushed the number of diabolos juggled at once up to six "high" (although there is some controversy as to whether this counts as the number of catches achieved is so small) and four "low."[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] Most diaboloists, however, stick to using only two or three diabolos at once. The introduction of multiple diabolos on a single string allows for many new moves. Many are applications of one-diabolo moves to multiple diabolos. The current world record for multiple "low" diabolos is 4 diabolos for 52 seconds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUZ-8QnLRhA |title=Jack Chen of MHD crew from Taiwan 4low Diabolo飛樂鈴揚陳玠竹 |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-08-28 |accessdate=2012-08-13[/tpl]

===Vertax===

Another advanced diabolo style is vertax (vertical axis; also known as "Excalibur"). This is where the diabolo is "tipped vertical" by means of "whipping" and is continually spun in this upright state. The person spinning it needs to rotate their body to keep up with the constant whipping action due to the momentum and centripetal motion at which the diabolo spins. Although the number of tricks seems limited, people are finding more ways to perform with this style, including vertax genocides, infinite suicides, and many suns, orbits, and satellites. It is also possible to have two diabolos in one string in vertax, this feat has been achieved by diabolo duo Tr'espace, and has also been done in the form of a fan.  Most of these tricks are accomplished by street performers in competitions, notably the GEDC and the Taipei PEC.  Some cutting-edge skilled vertax jugglers include William (Wei-Liang) Lin (in 2006, ranked #1 in the world), Ryo Yabe (multiple diabolos), Higami (a Japanese juggling group, noted for inventing the first 'infinite suicide vertax'), and Jonathan P. Chen (noted for inventing the vertax genocide); these jugglers are former and multiple winners of the above-mentioned cups.  Eric and Antonin (France) and Nate and Jacob Sharpe (USA) have contributed greatly to the development of vertax passing techniques.

===Contact diabolo===

This is a relatively recent style of diabolo that is gaining popularity. It utilizes the diabolo so that it has little or no spin at all. Then it can be caught and passed and manipulated with different parts of the body instead of just the sticks and string. It has new possibilities and new ideas are arising from this. Examples include catching the diabolo between one's arm and the stick before throwing it back. Tricks with multiple diabolos have also been developed.

===Loop diabolo===

Instead of having two sticks connected by a string, the diabolo is manipulated on a loop of string held around the hands. This opens up a variety of new tricks such as suicides, suns, whips, stopovers, trapezes, two diabolos and vertax. Yo-yo type slack tricks can also be performed in a loop.

===Monobolo===

Monobolo is a variation of the diabolo where instead of having two diabolo cups, there is only one and a weight on the other side. The monobolo can be used in the same fashion as normal diabolos. However, if a monobolo is put into excalibur, or horizontally, monobolos can be manipulated to be like a spinning top. To start a monobolo, twist the string around the axle and then let it gain some speed.

==Performances==

Cirque du Soleil combines diabolos with acrobatics during feature acts in five shows: Quidam, La Nouba, Dralion, Ovo and Viva Elvis.
In 2012 the Viva Elvis Casino show in Las Vegas, added a Diabolo Duet act, which includes Trevor Nassler & Maria Wolf.
In 2006 Circus Smirkus presented a duo diabolo act starring Jacob and Nate Sharpe, with advanced tricks including the first double sprinkler pass in a performance as well as some five-diabolo passing.
The diabolo programs of many Chinese schools provide performances during the Chinese New Year or near the end of the school year.
