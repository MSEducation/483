DYSEAC was the Second Standards Electronic Automatic Computer.  (See SEAC.) 
DYSEAC was a first-generation computer built by the National Bureau of Standards for the US Army Signal Corps.  It was housed in a truck, making it one of the first portable computers (perhaps the first).  It went into operation in April 1954.
DYSEAC used 900 vacuum tubes and 24,500 crystal diodes. It had a memory of 512 words of 45 bits each (plus one parity bit), using mercury delay line memory.  Memory access time was 48-384 microseconds.  The addition time was 48 microsecond and the multiplication/division time was 2112 microseconds.  These times are excluding the memory access time, which added up to approximately 1500 microseconds to those times.
