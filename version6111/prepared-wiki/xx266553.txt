==Life and career==

Based in Philadelphia, he was working for Billboard by the late 1930s, a period when he was credited with being, with Joe Csida, the first to seek to measure the popularity of songs on the basis of jukebox plays as an alternative to sheet music sales.Billboard, July 6, 1996, page 4  In 1942, in one of his regular record review columns, he described Sister Rosetta Tharpe's vocals on "Rock Me" as "rock-and-roll spiritual singing",Billboard, May 30, 1942, page 25 one of the first recorded uses of the phrase to describe a style of music, and he continued to use the term regularly in reviews over the next few years, several years before its popularisation by Alan Freed and others.J.

Hayes's Amazing Antifolk Explicator & Philosophic Analyzer   In 1945, for instance, he described Erskine Hawkins' version of "Caldonia" as "right rhythmic rock and roll music", a phrase precisely repeated in his 1946 review of "Sugar Lump" by Joe Liggins.Billboard, April 25, 1945, page 66Billboard, June 22, 1946, page 33
