The bonobo ([tpl]IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|n|oʊ|b|oʊ[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɒ|n|ə|b|oʊ[/tpl]), Pan paniscus, formerly called the pygmy chimpanzee and less often, the dwarf or gracile chimpanzee,[tpl]cite book | first1 = Frans | last1 = de Waal | first2 = Frans | last2 = Lanting | year = 1997 | title = Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape | publisher = University of California Press|isbn=0-520-20535-9[/tpl] is a great ape and one of the two species making up the genus Pan; the other is Pan troglodytes, or the common chimpanzee. Although the name "chimpanzee" is sometimes used to refer to both species together, it is usually understood as referring to the common chimpanzee, while Pan paniscus is usually referred to as the bonobo.
It is distinguished by relatively long legs, pink lips, dark face and tail-tuft through adulthood, and parted long hair on its head. The bonobo is found in a [tpl]Convert|500000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] area of the Congo Basin in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central Africa. The species is omnivorous and inhabits primary and secondary forests, including seasonally inundated swamp forests.
The bonobo is popularly known for its high levels of sexual behavior. Sex functions in conflict appeasement, affection, social status, excitement, and stress reduction. It occurs in virtually all partner combinations and in a variety of positions. This is a factor in the lower levels of aggression seen in the bonobo when compared to the common chimpanzee and other apes. Bonobos are perceived to be matriarchal and a male's rank in the social hierarchy is often determined by his mother's rank.
Along with the common chimpanzee, the bonobo is the closest extant relative to humans. Because the two species are not proficient swimmers, the formation of the Congo River 1.5–2 million years ago possibly led to the speciation of the bonobo. Bonobos live south of the river, and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee, which live north of the river. There is no concrete data on population numbers, but the estimate is between 29,500 and 50,000 individuals. The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is threatened by habitat destruction and human population growth and movement, though commercial poaching is the most prominent threat. They typically live 40 years in captivity,Rowe, N. (1996) Pictural Guide to the Living Primates, Pogonias Press, East Hampton, ISBN 0-9648825-1-5. though their lifespan in the wild is unknown.

==Etymology==

Despite the alternative common name "pygmy chimpanzee", the bonobo is not especially diminutive when compared to the common chimpanzee. "Pygmy" may instead refer to the pygmy peoples who live in the same area. The name "bonobo" first appeared in 1954, when Tratz and Heck proposed it as a new and separate generic term for pygmy chimpanzees. The name is thought to be a misspelling on a shipping crate from the town of Bolobo on the Congo River, which was associated with the collection of chimps in the 1920s.[tpl]cite book | first1 = Sue | last1 = Savage-Rumbaugh | first2 = Roger | last2 = Lewin | title = Kanzi: the ape at the brink of the human mind | year = 1994 | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | page=97 | isbn=0-385-40332-1[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = de Waal | first = Frans | title = Our Inner Ape | publisher = Riverhead Books | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-57322-312-3[/tpl] The term has also been reported as being a word for "ancestor" in an extinct Bantu language.

==Evolutionary history==

===Fossils===

Fossils of Pan species were not described until 2005. Existing chimpanzee populations in West and Central Africa do not overlap with the major human fossil sites in East Africa. However, Pan fossils have now been reported from Kenya. This would indicate that both humans and members of the Pan clade were present in the East African Rift Valley during the Middle Pleistocene.[tpl]cite journal | title = First fossil chimpanzee | last1 = McBrearty | first1 = Sally | first2 = Nina G. | last2 = Jablonski | journal = Nature | date = 1 September 2005 | volume = 437 | issue = 7055 | pages = 105–8 | pmid = 16136135 | doi = 10.1038/nature04008|bibcode = 2005Natur.437..105M [/tpl] According to A.

===Taxonomy and phylogeny===

German anatomist Ernst Schwarz is credited with having discovered the bonobo in 1928, based on his analysis of a skull in the Tervuren museum in Belgium that previously had been thought to have belonged to a juvenile chimpanzee. Schwarz published his findings in 1929.[tpl]cite journal | last = Schwarz | first = Ernst | title = Das Vorkommen des Schimpansen auf den linken Kongo-Ufer | language = German | journal =  Revue de zoologie et de botanique africaines | volume = 16 | pages = 425–426 | date = April 1, 1929[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last = Coolidge | first = Harold Jefferson Jr. | title = Pan paniscus.

The first official publication of the sequencing and assembly of the bonobo genome became publicly available in June 2012. It was deposited with the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank) under the EMBL accession number AJFE01000000Prüfer, Kay et al. (2012) "The bonobo genome compared with the chimpanzee and human genomes". Nature [tpl]DOI|10.1038/nature11128[/tpl] after a previous analysis by the National Human Genome Research Institute confirmed that the bonobo genome is about 0.4% divergent from the chimpanzee genome.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/neandertal-bonobo-genomes-may-shed-light-human-evolution-mpi-454-preparing-draft | first = Julia | last = Karow | title = Neandertal, bonobo genomes may shed light on human evolution; MPI, 454 preparing drafts |date = 2008-05-13 | publisher = Genome Web | work = In Sequence | accessdate = 2011-12-08[/tpl] In addition, Svante Pääbo's group at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology is currently sequencing the genome of a female bonobo from the Leipzig zoo.
Initial genetic studies characterised the DNA of chimpanzees and bonobos as being as much as 98% (99.4% in one study) identical to that of Homo sapiens.[tpl]cite web | url =  http://www.colszoo.org/animalareas/aforest/bonobo.html | title = Colombus Zoo: Bonobo | accessdate = 2006-08-01 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060502101116/http://www.colszoo.org/animalareas/aforest/bonobo.html | archivedate = 2006-05-02[/tpl] Later studies showed that chimpanzees and bonobos are more closely related to humans than to gorillas.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Takahata | first1 = N. | last2 = Satta | first2 = Y. | last3 = Klein | first3 = J. | year = 1995 | title = Divergence time and population size in the lineage leading to modern humans | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 198–221 | doi = 10.1006/tpbi.1995.1026 | pmid = 7482371[/tpl] In the crucial Nature paper reporting on initial genome comparisons, researchers identified 35 million single-nucleotide changes, five million insertion or deletion events, and a number of chromosomal rearrangements which constituted the genetic differences between the two Pan species and humans, covering 98% of the same genes.[tpl]cite journal | author = The Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium | date = 1 September 2005 | title = Initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue=7055 | pages = 69–87 | doi = 10.1038/nature04072 | pmid=16136131|bibcode = 2005Natur.437...69. [/tpl] While many of these analyses have been performed on the common chimpanzee rather than the bonobo, the differences between the two Pan species are unlikely to be substantial enough to affect the Pan-Homo comparison significantly.
There still is controversy, however. Scientists such as Jared Diamond in The Third Chimpanzee, and Morris Goodman[tpl]cite journal | last = Hecht | first = Jeff | title = Chimps are human, gene study implies | journal = New Scientist | date = 19 May 2003 | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3744-chimps-are-human-gene-study-implies.html | accessdate = 2011-12-08[/tpl] of Wayne State University in Detroit suggest that the bonobo and common chimpanzee are so closely related to humans that their genus name also should be classified with the human genus Homo: Homo paniscus, Homo sylvestris, or Homo arboreus. An alternative philosophy suggests that the term Homo sapiens is the misnomer  rather, and that humans should be reclassified as Pan sapiens, though this would violate the Principle of Priority, as Homo was named before Pan (1758 for the former, 1816 for the latter). In either case, a name change of the genus would have implications on the taxonomy of extinct species closely related to humans, including Australopithecus. The current line between Homo and non-Homo species is drawn about 2.5 million years ago, and chimpanzee and human ancestry converges only about 7 million years ago, nearly three times longer.
DNA evidence suggests the bonobo and common chimpanzee species effectively separated from each other fewer than one million years ago.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Won | first1 = Yong-Jin | last2 = Hey | first2 = Jody | title = Divergence population genetics of chimpanzees | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | journal = Molecular Biology & Evolution | pages = 297–307 | date = 13 October 2004 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msi017 | pmid = 15483319[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = Anne | first2 = Victor | last2 = Wiebe | first3 = Svante | last3 = Pääbo | first4 = Molly | last4 = Przeworski | title = Evidence for a complex demographic history of chimpanzees | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | journal = Molecular Biology & Evolution | pages = 799–808 | date = 12 February 2004 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msh083 | pmid = 14963091[/tpl] The Pan line split from the last common ancestor shared with humans approximately six to seven million years ago. Because no species other than Homo sapiens has survived from the human line of that branching, both Pan species are the closest living relatives of humans and cladistically are equally close to humans. The recent genome data confirms the genetic equidistance.

==Physical description==

The bonobo is commonly considered to be more gracile than the common chimpanzee. Although large male chimpanzees can exceed any bonobo in bulk and weight, the two species actually broadly overlap in body size. Adult female bonobos are somewhat smaller than adult males. Body mass in males ranges from [tpl]convert|34|to|60|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], against an average of [tpl]convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] in females. The total length of bonobos (from the nose to the rump while on all fours) is [tpl]convert|70|to|83|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]Cite doi|10.1098/rspb.2006.3568[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/bonobo/pan-paniscus/ |title=Bonobo videos, photos and facts – Pan paniscus |publisher=ARKive|accessdate=2012-08-15[/tpl]Burnie D and Wilson DE (Eds.), Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife.

(2011) Animal Tool Behavior: The Use and Manufacture of Tools by Animals, JHU Press, ISBN 1421401282. Its head is relatively smaller than that of the common chimpanzee with less prominent brow ridges above the eyes. It has a black face with pink lips, small ears, wide nostrils, and long hair on its head that forms a part. Females have slightly more prominent breasts, in contrast to the flat breasts of other female apes, although not so prominent as those of humans. The bonobo also has a slim upper body, narrow shoulders, thin neck, and long legs when compared to the common chimpanzee.
Bonobos are both terrestrial and arboreal. Most ground locomotion is characterized by quadrupedal knuckle walking. Bipedal walking has been recorded as less than 1% of terrestrial locomotion in the wild, a figure that decreased with habituation,[tpl]cite journal|author = Doran|title = Comparative locomotor behavior of chimpanzees and bonobos: the influence of morphology on locomotion|volume = 91|issue = 1|journal = Am J Phys Anthropol.|pages = :83–98|year = 1993|pmid = 8512056|doi = 10.1002/ajpa.1330910106[/tpl] while in captivity there is a wide variation. Bipedal walking in captivity, as a percentage of bipedal plus quadrupedal locomotion bouts, has been observed from 3.9% for spontaneous bouts to nearly 19% when abundant food is provided.[tpl]cite journal | first1 = K. | last1 = D’Août | first2 = E. | last2 = Vereecke | first3 = K. | last3 = Schoonaert | first4 = D. | last4 = De Clercq | first5 = L. | last5 = Van Elsacker | first6 = P. | last6 = Aerts | title = Locomotion in bonobos (Pan paniscus): differences and similarities between bipedal and quadrupedal terrestrial walking, and a comparison with other locomotor modes | journal = Journal of Anatomy | year = 2004 | volume = 204 | issue = 5 | pages = 353–361 | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-8782.2004.00292.x | pmc = 1571309 | pmid=15198700[/tpl] These physical characteristics and its posture give the bonobo an appearance more closely resembling that of humans than that of the common chimpanzee. The bonobo also has highly individuated facial features,Pauline Wilson Wiessner, Wulf Schiefenhövel. Food and the Status Quest: An Interdisciplinary Perspective. Berghahn Books. 1996. p. 50. "...twenty-two mature community members (eight males, fourteen females)could be identified using facial features... as humans do, so that one individual may look significantly different from another, a characteristic adapted for visual facial recognition in social interaction.
Multivariate analysis has shown bonobos are more neotenized than the common chimpanzee, taking into account such features as the proportionately long torso length of the bonobo.[tpl]cite journal|author=Shea, B.T. |pmid=6623093|year=1983|title=Paedomorphosis and neoteny in the pygmy chimpanzee|volume=222|issue=4623|pages=521–2|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.6623093 |bibcode = 1983Sci...222..521S [/tpl] Other researchers challenged this conclusion.[tpl]cite journal|author=Godfrey L, Sutherland M. |title=Paradox of peramophic paedomorphosis: heterochrony and human evolution|journal= Am J Phys Anthropol|year= 1996|volume=99|pages=17–42|pmid=8928718|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330990102|issue=1[/tpl]

==Behavior==

Primatologist Frans de Waal states bonobos are capable of altruism, compassion, empathy, kindness, patience, and sensitivity, and described "bonobo society" as a "gynecocracy".[tpl]cite book | last = de Waal | first = Frans | title = The Bonobo and the Atheist: In Search of Humanism Among the Primates | publisher = W.

Norton | edition = 1st | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-393-07377-5 | page = 78[/tpl][tpl]Efn|Gynecocracy, among people, 'women's government over women and men' or 'women's social supremacy'[/tpl] However, some have disputed how peaceful bonobos are.[tpl]cite web | last = Parker | first = Ian | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/07/30/070730fa_fact_parker?printable=true | work = Our Far-Flung Correspondents | title = Swingers | publisher = The New Yorker | date = 2007-07-30 | accessdate = 2011-12-08[/tpl]

===Social behavior===

Most studies indicate that females have a higher social status in bonobo society. Aggressive encounters between males and females are rare, and males are tolerant of infants and juveniles. A male derives his status from the status of his mother.White F. (1996) "Comparative socio-ecology of Pan paniscus", pp. 29–41 in: McGrew WC, Marchant LF, Nishida T (eds.) Great ape societies. Cambridge, England: Cambridge Univ Press, ISBN 0521555361. The mother–son bond often stays strong and continues throughout life. While social hierarchies do exist, rank plays a less prominent role than in other primate societies.
The limited research on bonobos in the wild was taken to indicate that these matriarchal behaviors may be exaggerated by captivity, as well as by food provisioning by researchers in the field.
Bonobo party size tends to vary because the groups exhibit a fission–fusion pattern. A community of approximately 100 will split into small groups during the day while looking for food, and then will come back together to sleep. They sleep in nests that they construct in trees.

===Sexual social behavior===

Sexual activity generally plays a major role in bonobo society, being used as what some scientists perceive as a greeting, a means of forming social bonds, a means of conflict resolution, and postconflict reconciliation.Aggression topics from the University of New Hampshire Bonobos are the only non-human animal to have been observed engaging in all of the following sexual activities: face-to-face genital sex (though a pair of western gorillas has been photographed performing face-to-face genital sexNguyen, Tuan C. (2008-02-13). "Gorillas Caught in Very Human Act". Live Science), tongue kissing, and oral sex.[tpl]cite journal|author = Manson, J.H.|coauthors = Perry, S.; Parish, A.R.|year = 1997|title = Nonconceptive Sexual Behavior in Bonobos and Capuchins|journal = International Journal of Primatology|volume = 18|issue = 5|pages = 767–86 |doi = 10.1023/A:1026395829818[/tpl]
Bonobos do not form permanent monogamous sexual relationships with individual partners. They also do not seem to discriminate in their sexual behavior by sex or age, with the possible exception of abstaining from sexual activity between mothers and their adult sons. When bonobos come upon a new food source or feeding ground, the increased excitement will usually lead to communal sexual activity, presumably decreasing tension and encouraging peaceful feeding.[tpl]cite journal | title = Bonobo Sex and Society | last = de Waal | first = Frans B. M. | authorlink = Frans de Waal | journal = Scientific American | date = March 1995 | volume = 272 | issue = 3 | pages = 58–64 | url = http://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/uploads/media/Bonobo_sex_01.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 21 December 2011 | bibcode = 1995SciAm.272c..82W | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0395-82 | pmid=7871411[/tpl]
Bonobo clitorises are larger and more externalized than in most mammals;[tpl]cite book |last=Balcombe |first=Jonathan Peter |title=The Exultant Ark: A Pictorial Tour of Animal Pleasure |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26024-5 |year=2011 |accessdate=2012-11-22|page=88|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tz9mSyTWh0oC&pg=PA88[/tpl] while the weight of a young adolescent female bonobo "is maybe half" that of a human teenager, she has a clitoris that is "three times bigger than the human equivalent, and visible enough to waggle unmistakably as she walks".[tpl]cite book |last=Angier |first=Natalie |authorlink=Natalie Angier |title=Woman: An Intimate Geography |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=978-0-395-69130-4 |year=1999 |accessdate=2012-11-22|page=68|url=http://books.google.com/?id=NIonAf-m9OwC&pg=PA68[/tpl] In scientific literature, the female–female behavior of pressing genitals together is often referred to as genital-genital (GG) rubbing, which is the non-human analog of tribadism, engaged in by human females. This sexual activity happens within the immediate female bonobo community and sometimes outside of it. Female bonobos rub their clitorises together rapidly for ten to twenty seconds, and this behavior, "which may be repeated in rapid succession, is usually accompanied by grinding, shrieking, and clitoral engorgement"; it is estimated that they engage in this practice "about once every two hours" on average. Because bonobos, like humans, mate face-to-face, "evolutionary biologist Marlene Zuk has suggested that the position of the clitoris in bonobos and some other primates has evolved to maximize stimulation during sexual intercourse".
Bonobo males occasionally engage in various forms of male–male genital behavior,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/vecase/Behavior/Spring2004/laird/Social%20Organization.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110519005633/http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/vecase/Behavior/Spring2004/laird/Social%20Organization.htm |archivedate=2011-05-19 |title=Courtney Laird, "Social Organization" |publisher=Bio.davidson.edu |year=2004 |accessdate=2009-07-03[/tpl] which is the non-human analog of frotting, engaged in by human males. In one form, two bonobo males hang from a tree limb face-to-face while penis fencing.[tpl]cite book|author= Frans B. M. de Waal |authorlink= Frans de Waal| title=The ape and the sushi master : cultural reflections by a primatologist|publisher=Basic Books|chapter=Bonobos and Fig Leaves|year= 2001|isbn= 84-493-1325-2[/tpl] This also may occur when two males rub their penises together while in face-to-face position. Another form of genital interaction (rump rubbing) occurs to express reconciliation between two males after a conflict, when they stand back-to-back and rub their scrotal sacs together. Takayoshi Kano observed similar practices among bonobos in the natural habitat.
More often than the males, female bonobos engage in mutual genital behavior, possibly to bond socially with each other, thus forming a female nucleus of bonobo society. The bonding among females enables them to dominate most of the males. Although male bonobos are individually stronger, they cannot stand alone against a united group of females. Adolescent females often leave their native community to join another community. Sexual bonding with other females establishes these new females as members of the group. This migration mixes the bonobo gene pools, providing genetic diversity.
Bonobo reproductive rates are no higher than those of the common chimpanzee. During oestrus, females undergo a swelling of the perineal tissue lasting 10 to 20 days. Most matings occur during the maximum swelling.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] The gestation period is on average 240 days. Postpartum amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) lasts less than one year and a female may resume external signs of oestrus within a year of giving birth, though the female is probably not fertile at this point. Female bonobos carry and nurse their young for four years and give birth on average every 4.6 years.[tpl]cite web | url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Pan_paniscus.html | last1 = Williams | first1 = A. | first2 = P. | last2 = Myers | year = 2004 | title = Pan paniscus | publisher = Animal Diversity Web | accessdate = 6 January 2012[/tpl] Compared to common chimpanzees, bonobo females resume the genital swelling cycle much sooner after giving birth, enabling them to rejoin the sexual activities of their society. Also, bonobo females which are sterile or too young to reproduce still engage in sexual activity.
It is unknown how the bonobo avoids simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and its effects.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jvi.asm.org/content/79/7/3891|title=Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Infection of Chimpanzees|author1=Paul M.

===Diet===

The bonobo is an omnivorous frugivore. The majority of its diet is fruit, but supplements its diet with leaves, meat from small vertebrates such as anomalures, flying squirrels and duikers,[tpl]cite journal |author=Ihobe H |title=Observations on the meat-eating behavior of wild bonobos (Pan paniscus) at Wamba, Republic of Zaire |journal=Primates |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=247–250|year=1992 |doi=10.1007/BF02382754[/tpl] and invertebrates.Rafert, J. and E.O.

===Peacefulness===

Observations in the wild indicate that the males among the related common chimpanzee communities are extraordinarily hostile to males from outside the community. Parties of males 'patrol' for the neighboring males that might be traveling alone, and attack those single males, often killing them.[tpl]cite news | date = June 24, 2010 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/16422404 | work = The Economist | title = Chimpanzee behavior: Killer instincts | accessdate = 2011-12-08[/tpl] This does not appear to be the behavior of bonobo males or females, which seem to prefer sexual contact over violent confrontation with outsiders. In fact, the Japanese scientists who have spent the most time working with wild bonobos describe the species as extraordinarily peaceful, and de Waal has documented how bonobos may often resolve conflicts with sexual contact (hence the "make love, not war" characterization for the species). Between groups, social mingling may occur, in which members of different communities have sex and groom each other, behavior which is unheard of among common chimpanzees. Conflict is still possible between rival groups of bonobos, but no official scientific reports of it exist. The ranges of bonobos and chimpanzees are separated by the Congo River, with bonobos living to the south of it, and chimpanzees to the north.The Smart and Swinging Bonobo|Science & Nature|Smithsonian Magazine.

Recent studies show that there are significant brain differences between bonobos and chimps. The brain anatomy of bonobos has more developed and larger regions assumed to be vital for feeling empathy, sensing distress in others and feeling anxiety, which makes them less aggressive and more empathic than their close relatives. They also have a thick connection between the amygdala, an important area that can spark aggression, and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, which helps control impulses. This thicker connection may make them better in regulating their emotional impulses and behavior.Brain differences may explain varying behavior of bonobos and chimpanzees.

The popular image of the bonobo as a peaceful ape does not always apply to captive populations. Accounts exist of bonobos confined in zoos mutilating one another and engaging in bullying. These incidents may be due to the practice in zoos of separating mothers and sons, which is contrary to their social organization in the wild. Bonobo society is dominated by females, and severing the lifelong alliance between mothers and their male offspring may make them vulnerable to female aggression. De Waal has warned of the danger of romanticizing bonobos: "All animals are competitive by nature and cooperative only under specific circumstances" and that "when first writing about their behaviour, I spoke of 'sex for peace' precisely because bonobos had plenty of conflicts. There would obviously be no need for peacemaking if they lived in perfect harmony."
Discussions of the peacefulness of bonobos sometimes touch on the fact that bonobos kill monkeys for food.
For the biologist, this fact is irrelevant in any discussion of aggression and peacefulness, because it is predation (due to hunger, not aggression) practiced against a different species. Hohmann and Surbeck published in 2008 that bonobos sometimes do hunt monkey species. Five incidents were observed in a group of bonobos in Salonga National Park, which seemed to reflect deliberate cooperative hunting. On three occasions, the hunt was successful, and infant monkeys were captured and eaten.

===Similarity to humans===

Bonobos are capable of passing the mirror-recognition test for self-awareness,[tpl]cite journal |title=Minding the Animals: Ethology and the Obsolescence of Left Humanism |last=Best |first=Steven |date=Spring 2009 |volume=5 |issue=2 |journal=The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy |url=http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol5/vol5_no2_best_minding_animals_PRINTABLE.htm |accessdate=2012-02-08[/tpl] as are all great apes. They communicate primarily through vocal means, although the meanings of their vocalizations are not currently known. However, most humans do understand their facial expressions and some of their natural hand gestures, such as their invitation to play. Two bonobos at the Great Ape Trust, Kanzi and Panbanisha, have been taught how to communicate using a keyboard labeled with lexigrams (geometric symbols) and they can respond to spoken sentences. Kanzi's vocabulary consists of more than 500 English words[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greatapetrust.org/bonobo/meet/kanzi.php|title=Meet our Great Apes: Kanzi|accessdate=2008-09-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080630201101/http://www.greatapetrust.org/bonobo/meet/kanzi.php|archivedate = 2008-06-30[/tpl] and he has comprehension of around 3,000 spoken English words.[tpl]cite web|author=Raffaele, P. |year=2006|title=Speaking Bonobo|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/10022981.html|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=2008-09-28[/tpl] Kanzi is also known for learning by observing people trying to teach his mother; Kanzi started doing the tasks that his mother was taught just by watching, some of which his mother had failed to learn. Some, such as philosopher and bioethicist Peter Singer, argue that these results qualify them for "rights to survival and life" — rights that humans theoretically accord to all persons. (See great ape personhood.)
As in other great apes and humans, third party affiliation toward the victim – the affinitive contact made toward the recipient an aggression by a group member other than the aggressor -  is present in bonobos.[tpl]cite journal | author = Palagi E, Paoli T, et al.| title = Reconciliation and consolation in captive bonobos (Pan paniscus) |year= 2004| journal = Am J Primatol| volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages= 15–30| pmid = 14752810 | doi = 10.1002/ajp.20000 [/tpl] A 2013 study [tpl]cite journal | author = Palagi E, Norscia I| title = Bonobos Protect and Console Friends and Kin |year= 2013| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 8(11) | issue = 11 | pages= e79290 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0079290[/tpl] found that both the affiliation spontaneously offered by a bystander to the victim and the affiliation requested by the victim (solicited affiliation) can reduce the probability of further aggression by group members on the victim (this fact supporting the Victim-Protection Hypothesis). Yet, only spontaneous affiliation reduced victim anxiety - measured via self-scratching rates - thus suggesting not only that non solicited affiliation has a consolatory function but also that the spontaneous gesture – more than the protection itself – works in calming the distressed subject. The authors hypothesize that the victim may perceive the motivational autonomy of the bystander, who does not require an invitation to provide post-conflict affinitive contact. Moreover, spontaneous - but not solicited - third party affiliation was affected by the bond between consoler and victim (this supporting the Consolation Hypothesis). Importantly, spontaneous affiliation followed the empathic gradient described for humans, being mostly offered to kin, then friends, then acquaintances (this categories having been determined using affiliation rates between individuals). Hence, consolation in the bonobo may be an empathy-based phenomenon.
Instances in which non-human primates have expressed joy have been reported. One study analyzed and recorded sounds made by human babies and bonobos when they were tickled.[tpl]cite web|author=Beale, B. |year=2003|title=Where Did Laughter Come From?|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/afp/20031006/laughter.html|publisher=ABC Science Online|accessdate=2008-08-10[/tpl] Although the bonobos' laugh was at a higher frequency, the laugh was found to follow a spectrographic pattern similar to that of human babies.

==Habitat and distribution==

Bonobos are found only south of the Congo River and north of the Kasai River (a tributary of the Congo),[tpl]cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Ancestor's Tale |year=2004 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |chapter=Chimpanzees |isbn=1-155-16265-X[/tpl] in the humid forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo of central Africa. Ernst Schwarz's 1927 paper “Le Chimpanzé de la Rive Gauche du Congo”, announcing his discovery, has been read as an association between the Parisian Left Bank and the left bank of the Congo River; the bohemian culture in Paris, and an unconventional ape in the Congo.[tpl]cite web|last=Quammen|first=david|title=The Left Bank Ape|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/bonobos/quammen-text|work=The New Age of Exploration, 2013|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=28 February 2013[/tpl]

==Conservation status==

The IUCN Red List classifies bonobos as an endangered species, with conservative population estimates ranging from 29,500 to 50,000 individuals. Major threats to bonobo populations include habitat loss and hunting for bushmeat, the latter activity having increased dramatically during the first and second Congo wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo due to the presence of heavily armed militias even in remote "protected" areas such as Salonga National Park. This is part of a more general trend of ape extinction.
As the bonobos' habitat is shared with people, the ultimate success of conservation efforts will rely on local and community involvement. The issue of parks versus peopleReid, John (2006-06-15). Parks and people, not parks vs. people, San Francisco Chronicle. is salient in the Cuvette Centrale the bonobos' range. There is strong local and broad-based Congolese resistance to establishing national parks, as indigenous communities have often been driven from their forest homes by the establishment of parks. In Salonga National Park, the only national park in the bonobo habitat, there is no local involvement, and surveys undertaken since 2000 indicate the bonobo, the African forest elephant, and other species have been severely devastated by poachers and the thriving bushmeat trade.Bonobo and large mammal survey Zoological Society of Milwaukee. In contrast, areas exist where the bonobo and biodiversity still thrive without any established parks, due to the indigenous beliefs and taboos against killing bonobos.

In 1995, concern over declining numbers of bonobos in the wild led the Zoological Society of Milwaukee, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with contributions from bonobo scientists around the world, to publish the Action Plan for Pan paniscus: A Report on Free Ranging Populations and Proposals for their Preservation. The Action Plan compiles population data on bonobos from 20 years of research conducted at various sites throughout the bonobo's range. The plan identifies priority actions for bonobo conservation and serves as a reference for developing conservation programs for researchers, government officials, and donor agencies.
Acting on Action Plan recommendations, the ZSM developed the Bonobo and Congo Biodiversity Initiative. This program includes habitat and rain-forest preservation, training for Congolese nationals and conservation institutions, wildlife population assessment and monitoring, and education. The Zoological Society has conducted regional surveys within the range of the bonobo in conjunction with training Congolese researchers in survey methodology and biodiversity monitoring. The Zoological Society’s initial goal was to survey Salonga National Park to determine the conservation status of the bonobo within the park and to provide financial and technical assistance to strengthen park protection. As the project has developed, the Zoological Society has become more involved in helping the Congolese living in bonobo habitat. The Zoological Society has built schools, hired teachers, provided some medicines, and started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.zoosociety.org/conservation/Bonobo/BCBI/ | title = Bonobo and Congo Biodiversity Initiative | publisher = Zoological Society of Milwaukee[/tpl]
During the wars in the 1990s, researchers and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were driven out of the bonobo habitat. In 2002, the Bonobo Conservation Initiative initiated the Bonobo Peace Forest Project supported by the Global Conservation Fund of Conservation International and in cooperation with national institutions, local NGOs, and local communities. The Peace Forest Project works with local communities to establish a linked constellation of community-based reserves, managed by local and indigenous people. Although there has been only limited support from international organizations, this model, implemented mainly through DRC organizations and local communities, has helped bring about agreements to protect over [tpl]convert|5000|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of the bonobo habitat. According to Dr. Amy Parish, the Bonobo Peace Forest "is going to be a model for conservation in the 21st century."The Make Love, Not War Species, Living on Earth, (July 2006), National Public Radio
With grants from the United Nations, USAID, the U.S. Embassy, the World Wildlife Fund, and many other groups and individuals, the Zoological Society also has been working to:
Starting in 2003, the U.S. government allocated $54 million to the Congo Basin Forest Partnership. This significant investment has triggered the involvement of international NGOs to establish bases in the region and work to develop bonobo conservation programs. This initiative should improve the likelihood of bonobo survival, but its success still may depend upon building greater involvement and capability in local and indigenous communities.Chapin, Mac, (November/December 2004), Vision for a Sustainable World, WORLDWATCH magazine
The Congo is setting aside more than [tpl]convert|11000|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of rainforest to help protect the endangered bonobo, in this central African country. U.S. agencies, conservation groups, and the Congolese government have come together to set aside [tpl]convert|11803|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of tropical rainforest, the U.S.-based Bonobo Conservation Initiative. The area amounts to just over 1% of the vast Congo – but that means a park larger than the state of Massachusetts.
The bonobo population is believed to have declined sharply in the last 30 years, though surveys have been hard to carry out in war-ravaged central Congo. Estimates range from 60,000 to fewer than 50,000 living, according to the World Wildlife Fund.
In addition, concerned parties have addressed the crisis on several science and ecological websites. Organizations such as the World Wide Fund for Nature, the African Wildlife Foundation, and others, are trying to focus attention on the extreme risk to the species. Some have suggested that a reserve be established in a more stable part of Africa, or on an island in a place such as Indonesia. Awareness is ever increasing, and even nonscientific or ecological sites have created various groups to collect donations to help with the conservation of this species.
