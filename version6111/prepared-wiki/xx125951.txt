==Career==

He had a small role in John Singleton's 2000 remake of the film Shaft.  He had a brief appearance in Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles as a soldier in a unit that was sent back in time. He has also had roles in Heroes and Kenan and Kel.
He is mostly known for his starring role on the HBO program The Wire as drug addict and confidential informant "Bubbles" (a regular character since the show's first season). Royo's portrayal of this character was so convincing that, during on-location filming, he was once approached by a Baltimore resident and given a small package of heroin, with the man saying to the in-character Royo, "Man, you need a fix more than I do." Royo has called this his "street Oscar".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/10/22/071022fa_fact_talbot?currentPage=1|title=Stealing Life|accessdate=2007-10-14|publisher=The New Yorker|year=2007|author=Margaret Talbot| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071016044744/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/10/22/071022fa_fact_talbot?currentPage=1| archivedate= 16 October 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
