==History==

The interconnectedness of Lusophone countries dates back to the Atlantic Slave Trade, between Portugal, Brazil and regions of Africa.[tpl]cite book|last=Arenas|first=Fernando|title=Lusophone Africa: Beyond Independence|year=2011|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=1–43[/tpl] In the 15th century, the Portuguese were the primary exporters of African slaves to the Americas, and with slaves came their musical traditions.[tpl]cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=4|accessdate=9 August 2012[/tpl] Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, there was a massive Brazilian presence in Angola, enabling a cultural exchange between the two Portuguese colonies.[tpl]cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=4|accessdate=9 August 2012[/tpl] This exchange enabled subtle amalgamations of musical styles between Angola, Brazil and other African slave trade countries.[tpl]cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=4|accessdate=9 August 2012[/tpl] The establishment of a creole population in Brazil  led to further cultural developments in language, religion and art.[tpl]cite book|last=Thorton|first=John|title=Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400-1800|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=183–205[/tpl]

==Dissemination==

Records from the inquisition of the 18th century reveal that the Europeans initially considered gandus and lundus to be witchcraft.[tpl]cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=12|accessdate=9 August 2012[/tpl] Many slave-owning Europeans in Brazil tolerated the dance in an attempt to avoid slave rebellion.[tpl]cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=12|accessdate=9 August 2012[/tpl] Eventually, the style became attractive to Europeans in Brazil for its sexualized quality and its believed effectiveness in reversing witchcraft.[tpl]cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=12|accessdate=9 August 2012[/tpl] de Mattos was disgruntled by the blurring by dance and drums of strict racial and cultural boundaries in Brazil.[tpl]cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=13|accessdate=9 August 2012[/tpl] 
Gradually, the lundu style grew in popularity among the elite population in Brazil.[tpl]cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=20|accessdate=9 August 2012[/tpl] In 1749, Brazilian musician Manuel de Almeida Botelho immigrated to Lisbon, bringing with him the modinha and lundu musical styles.[tpl]cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=19|accessdate=9 August 2012[/tpl] By the 19th century, lundu had become the music of choice for the Luso-Brazilian bourgeoisie.[tpl]cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=20|accessdate=9 August 2012[/tpl] Historians have even called the style the “…most characteristic late 18th century genre of dance and song in Portugal and Brazil”.[tpl]cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=20|accessdate=9 August 2012[/tpl]

==Style==

Lundus are characterized by varying structure, the interplay of tonic and dominant harmony, and strummed chords layered atop a syncopated rhythm reminiscent of traditional West African music.[tpl]cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=12|accessdate=9 August 2012[/tpl] Limited recordings are available of traditional lundus style. Usually a flirtatious ritual of a couple dance, accompanied by a guitar, or sometimes a thumb piano or drums, Lundu is related to the Spanish fandango and other new-world dances like the Argentine Zamba, Cueca and Bolero - they all involve, to some degree, handkerchiefs, castanets, and holding one's arms above one's head. In the 19th century, the lundu was one of the sources of the Choro, the Maxixe and the Samba
