[[Nights Like This]]

CATEGORIES: 1989 albums, Stacey Q albums, Atlantic Records albums

Nights Like This was Stacey Q's follow up album to Hard Machine.  Some of the songs made it to the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart such as the lead single, "Give You All My Love" produced by Clivilles & Cole of C&C Music Factory. That song  as well as others failed to reach the top 40 in the Hot 100. The second single, the slightly tropical ballad Heartbeat became a minor Adult Contemporary radio hit. While a commercial failure, it is still considered a critical success. Her follow up albums were a compilation of her old material named Stacey Q's Greatest Hits and the folk-styled album Boomerang. She released a new album in 2010 called "Color Me Cinnamon."
