[[Enarete]]

CATEGORIES: Greek mythology, Women in Greek mythology

In Greek mythology, Enarete ([tpl]lang|grc|Ἐναρέτη[/tpl]) or Aenarete ([tpl]lang|grc|Αἰναρέτη[/tpl], Ainarete), daughter of Deimachus, was the wife of Aeolus and ancestress of the Aeolians.Enarete is the form found in the manuscripts of Bibliotheca 1.7.1, which [tpl]harvtxt|West|1985|pp=59–60[/tpl] takes to be a misspelling of Aenarete, the form written in the scholia to Plato, Minos 315c, since Enarete cannot stand in a hexameter line and the Bibliothecas primary source at this point is the epic Hesiodic Catalogue of Women. At scholia to Pindar, Pythia 4.252 yet another form—Enarea ([tpl]lang|grc|Ἐνάρεα[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|grc|Ἐναρέᾱ[/tpl])—is found. Her children were Cretheus, Sisyphus, Athamas, Salmoneus, Deion, Magnes, Perieres, Canace, Alcyone, Peisidice, Calyce, and Perimede.Bibliotheca 1. 7. 3  She may have been the mother of Arne, if the Aeolus who was her husband was the same Aelous who fathered Arne.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 9. 40. 5; Diodorus Siculus (Library of History, 4. 67), however, states that the father of Arne was the great-grandson of Aeolus, husband of Enarete
