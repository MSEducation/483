Nikolaus Friedreich (July 1, 1825, Würzburg – 6 July 1882, Heidelberg) was a German pathologist and neurologist, and a third generation physician in the Friedreich family. His father was psychiatrist Johann Baptist Friedreich (1796-1862), and his grandfather was pathologist Nicolaus Anton Friedreich (1761-1836), who is remembered for his early description of idiopathic facial paralysis, which would later be known as Bell's palsy.Bell's paralysis @ Who Named It
In the early part of his career he studied and practiced medicine at the University of Würzburg under the tutelage of noted men such as physiologist Albert von Kölliker and pathologist Rudolf Virchow. He later became a professor of pathological anatomy at the University of Würzburg, and in 1858 he was appointed professor of pathology and therapy at the University of Heidelberg, where he remained for the rest of his career. Some of his better known students and assistants included Adolf Kussmaul, Wilhelm Heinrich Erb and Friedrich Schultze.
Friedreich was involved in the establishment of pathological correlations, notably in research of muscular dystrophy, spinal ataxia and brain tumors. He is remembered today for "Friedreich's ataxia", which he identified in 1863. It is a degenerative disease with sclerosis of the spinal cord which affects a person's speech, balance and coordination.
