[[Logic bomb]]

CATEGORIES: Types of malware

A logic bomb is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met. For example, a programmer may hide a piece of code that starts deleting files (such as a salary database trigger), should they ever be terminated from the company.
Software that is inherently malicious, such as viruses and worms, often contain logic bombs that execute a certain payload at a pre-defined time or when some other condition is met. This technique can be used by a virus or worm to gain momentum and spread before being noticed. Some viruses attack their host systems on specific dates, such as Friday the 13th or April Fool's Day. Trojans that activate on certain dates are often called "time bombs".
To be considered a logic bomb, the payload should be unwanted and unknown to the user of the software. As an example, trial programs with code that disables certain functionality after a set time are not normally regarded as logic bombs.

==Supposed logic bombing of the Trans-Siberian Pipeline==

It has been reported that in 1982 the Trans-Siberian Pipeline incident occurred because of a logic bomb (It has later been reported that this story may be a hoaxMackeown, Patrick (10 August 2006). "Bookscape: Short Story - Famous Computer Hoaxes". Bookscape. Archived on 13 November 2010.). A KGB operative was reported to have stolen the plans for a sophisticated control system and its software from a Canadian firm, for use on their Siberian pipeline. The CIA was supposedly tipped off by documents in the Farewell Dossier and had the company insert a logic bomb in the program for sabotage purposes.[tpl]Cite web|title=Tech sabotage during the Cold War|website=Federal Computer Week|publisher=1105 Media|first=Matthew|last=French|date=26 April 2004|url=http://fcw.com/Articles/2004/04/26/Tech-sabotage-during-the-Cold-War.aspx?Page=1[/tpl]
