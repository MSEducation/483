[[Road signs in South Korea]]

CATEGORIES: Road signs by country

Road signs in South Korea are regulated by the Korean Road Traffic Authority ([tpl]lang-ko|도로교통안전공단[/tpl]).
Signs indicating dangers are triangular with a red border, yellow background and black pictograms. Mandatory instructions are white on a blue background, prohibitions are black on a white background with a red border, and supplementary information signs are rectangular with black text on a white background. Like other countries, the signs use pictograms to display their meaning. Any text included in signs will normally be in Korean and English. Signs are normally placed 1 to 2.1 meters high.
