The Battle of Long Island, also known as the Battle of Brooklyn or the Battle of Brooklyn Heights, fought on August 27, 1776, was a defeat for the Continental Army under General George Washington and the beginning of a successful campaign that gave the British control of the strategically important city of New York. In the American Revolutionary War it was the first major battle to take place after the United States declared independence on July 4, 1776. In terms of troop size, it was the largest battle of the entire war.
After defeating the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17, 1776, General George Washington, Commander-in-Chief, brought the Continental Army to defend the port city of New York, then limited to the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city's harbor would provide an excellent base for the British Navy during the campaign. There he established defenses and waited for the British to attack. In July, the British, under the command of General William Howe, landed a few miles across the harbor from Manhattan on the sparsely-populated of Staten Island, where during the next month and a half they were slowly reinforced by ships in Lower New York Bay, bringing their total force to 32,000 troops. With the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at The Narrows, Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city. Believing Manhattan would be the first target, he moved there the bulk of his forces.
On August 22, the British landed on the shores of Gravesend Bay in southwest Kings County, across The Narrows from Staten Island, more than a dozen miles south from the East River crossings to Manhattan. After five days of waiting, the British attacked American defenses on the Guan Heights. Unknown to the Americans, however, Howe had brought his main army around their rear and attacked their flank soon after. The Americans panicked, although a stand by 400 Maryland troops prevented most of the army from being captured. The remainder of the army retreated to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights. The British dug in for a siege but, on the night of August 29â€“30, Washington evacuated the entire army to Manhattan without the loss of supplies or a single life. Washington and the Continental Army were driven out of New York entirely after several more defeats and forced to retreat through New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.

==Background==

===Boston to New York===

In the first stage of the war, the British Army was trapped in the then-peninsular city of Boston and on March 17, they abandoned it setting sail to Halifax, Nova Scotia to await reinforcements.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=101[/tpl]. Washington then began to transfer regiments to New York City where he believed that the British would next attack because of its strategic importance.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=112[/tpl].[tpl]Harvnb|Lengel|2005|p=128[/tpl]. Washington left Boston on April 4; arrive at New York on April 13,[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=121[/tpl]. and established headquarters at the former home of Archibald Kennedy on Broadway facing Bowling Green. Previously in February, Washington had sent his second in command, Charles Lee, ahead to New York to establish  the City's defenses.[tpl]Harvnb|Lengel|2005|p=129[/tpl]. Lee remained in New York City until March when the Continental Congress sent him to South Carolina; defense construction was left to General William Alexander (Lord Stirling). Troops were in limited supply so Washington found the defenses incomplete,[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=122[/tpl]. but Lee had concluded that with the British commanding the sea it would be impossible to hold the city. Lee reasoned that the defenses should be located with the ability to inflict upon the British heavy casualties if any move was made to take and hold ground. Barricades and redoubts were established in and around the city, and across the east River, in Brooklyn Heights facing the city, the bastion of Fort Stirling.[tpl]Harvnb|Lengel|2005|p=131[/tpl]. Lee also saw that Long Island was cleared of Loyalists.[tpl]Harvnb|Field|1869|p=47[/tpl].

===Strategy===

Washington began moving troops to Brooklyn in early May[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=127[/tpl]. so that within a short time, there were a few thousand of them in Brooklyn. On the eastern side of the East River, three more forts were under construction to support Fort Stirling, which stood to the west of the hamlet of Brooklyn Heights: Fort PutnamFort Putnam - New York State Military Museum (named for Rufus Putnam, not to be confused with the later Fort Putnam at West Point), Fort GreeneFort Greene - New York State Military Museum (named for Nathanael Greene) and Fort BoxFort Box - New York State Military Museum (named for Major Daniel Box).[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=128[/tpl]. From north to south they lied with Fort Putnam furthest to the north, with Greene slightly to the southwest and Box slightly further southwest. Each of these defensive structures were surrounded by a large ditch, all connected by a line of entrenchments and a total of 36 cannons (mostly 18-pounders).[tpl]Harvnb|Field|1869|p=144[/tpl].
Fort Defiance was also being constructed at this time, located further southwest, past Fort Box, near present day Red Hook. In addition to these new forts, a mounted battery was established on Governors Island, cannons were placed at Fort George facing Bowling Green and more cannons placed at the Whitehall Dock, which sat on the East River.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=129[/tpl]. Hulks were sunk at strategic locations to deter the British from entering the East River and other waterways.McCullough 2006 .
Washington had been authorized by Congress to recruit an army of up to 28,500 troops; he had only 19,000 troops when he reached in New York.[tpl]Harvnb|Lengel|2005|p=132[/tpl]. Military discipline was inadequate: routine simple orders were not carried out, muskets were fired in camp, flints ruined, bayonets as knives to cut food, and firearm readiness lax.[tpl]Harvnb|Lengel|2005|p=133[/tpl]. Petty internal conflict was common under the strain of the so many people from different environments and temperaments in relative closeness.[tpl]Harvnb|Ellis|2005|p=159[/tpl].
The commander of the artillery, Henry Knox, persuaded Washington to transfer 500 to 600 soldiers who lacked muskets to crew the artillery. In early June, Knox and Greene inspected the land at the north end of Manhattan and decided to establish Fort Washington. Another fort, Fort Constitution, later renamed Fort Lee, was planned for opposite from Fort Washington on the Hudson River. The forts were hoped to thwart the British ships from sailing up the Hudson.

===British Arrival===

On June 28 Washington learned that the British fleet had set sail from Halifax on June 9 and were heading toward New York.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=133[/tpl]. On June 29, signals were sent from men stationed on Staten Island that the British fleet had appeared. Within a few hours 45 British ships dropped anchor in Lower New York Bay.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=134[/tpl]. Less than a week later, there were 130 ships off Staten Island under the command of Richard Howe, the brother of the General.[tpl]Harvnb|Lengel|2005|p=135[/tpl]. The population of New York went into panic at the sight of the British ships, alarms went off and troops immediately rushed to their posts. On July 2, British troops began to land on Staten Island. The Continental regulars on the island took a few shots at the British before fleeing and the citizen's militia switched over to the British side.
On July 6, news reached New York that Congress had voted for independence four days earlier.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=135[/tpl]. On Tuesday, July 9, at 18:00, Washington had several brigades march onto the Commons of the City to hear the Declaration of Independence read. After the end of the reading, a mob ran down to Bowling Green, where, with ropes and bars, they tore down the gilded lead equestrian statue of George III of Great Britain.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=137[/tpl]. In their fury the crowd cut off the statue's head, severed the nose, and mounted what remained of the head on a spike outside a tavern, and the rest of the statue was dragged to Connecticut and melted down into musket balls.
On July 12, two British ships, the Phoenix and the Rose, sailed up the harbor toward the mouth of the Hudson.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=138[/tpl]. The American batteries stationed at Fort George, Red Hook and Governors Island opened fire, but the British returned fire into the city. The ships sailed along the New Jersey shore and continued up the Hudson, sailing past Fort Washington and arriving by nightfall at Tarrytown, the widest part of the Hudson.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=139[/tpl]. The goal of the British ships was to cut off American supplies and encourage Loyalist support. The only casualties of the day were six Americans who were killed when their own cannon blew up.
The next day, July 13, General Howe attempted to open negotiations with the Americans.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=144[/tpl]. Howe sent a letter to Washington delivered by Lieutenant Philip Brown, who arrived under the flag of truce. The letter was addressed George Washington, Esq. Brown was met by Joseph Reed, who on Washington's orders had hurried to the waterfront accompanied by Henry Knox and Samuel Webb. Washington asked his officers whether it should be received or not, as it did not recognize his rank as General, and they unanimously said no.[tpl]Harvnb|Johnston|1878|p=97[/tpl]. Brown was told by Reed that there was no one in the army with that address. On July 16 Howe tried again, this time with the address George Washington, Esq., etc., etc. but it was again declined.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=145[/tpl]. The next day Howe sent Captain Nisbet Balfour to ask if Washington would meet with Howe's adjutant face to face, and a meeting was scheduled for July 20. Howe's adjutant was Colonel James Patterson. Patterson told Washington that Howe had come with powers to grant pardons but Washington said, "Those who have committed no fault want no pardon." Patterson departed soon after. Washington's performance during the meeting was praised throughout the United States.[tpl]Harvnb|Lengel|2005|p=138[/tpl].
Meanwhile, British ships continued to arrive.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=146[/tpl]. On August 1, 45 ships with Generals Henry Clinton and Charles Cornwallis arrived, along with 3,000 troops. By August 12, 3,000 more British troops and another 8,000 Hessians had arrived.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=148[/tpl]. At this point the British fleet numbered over 400 ships, including 73 war ships, and 32,000 troops were camped on Staten Island. Faced with this large force, Washington was unsure as to where the British would attack.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=152[/tpl]. Both Greene and Reed thought that the British would attack Long Island, but Washington felt that a British attack on Long Island might be a diversion for the main attack on Manhattan. Washington broke his army in half, stationing half of it on Manhattan, and the other half on Long Island; the army on Long Island was commanded by Greene. On August 20 Greene became ill and was forced to move to a house in Manhattan where he rested to recover. John Sullivan was placed in command until Greene was well enough to resume command.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=153[/tpl].

===Invasion of Long Island===

At 05:10, on August 22, an advance guard of 4,000 British troops, under the command of Clinton and Cornwallis, left Staten Island to land on Long Island.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=156[/tpl]. At 08:00, all 4,000 troops landed on the shore of Gravesend Bay, unopposed. Colonel Edward Hand's Pennsylvanian riflemen had been stationed on the shore, but they did not oppose the landings and fell back, killing cattle and burning farmhouses on the way.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=157[/tpl]. By noon, 15,000 troops had landed on shore along with 40 pieces of artillery. As hundreds of Loyalists came to greet the British troops, Cornwallis pushed on with the advance guard, advancing six miles on to the island and establishing camp at the village of Flatbush; Cornwallis was given orders to advance no further.[tpl]Harvnb|Johnston|1878|p=141[/tpl].
Washington received word of the landings the same day they occurred, but was informed that the number was 8,000 to 9,000 troops.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=158[/tpl]. This convinced Washington that it was the feint he had predicted and therefore he only sent 1,500 more troops to Brooklyn, bringing the total troops on Long Island to 6,000. On August 24, Washington replaced Sullivan with Israel Putnam who commanded the troops on Long Island.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=160[/tpl]. Putnam arrived on Long Island the next day along with six battalions. Also that day the British troops on Long Island received 5,000 Hessian reinforcements, bringing their total to 20,000.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=161[/tpl]. Although there was little fighting on the days immediately after the landing, some small skirmishes did take place with American marksmen armed with rifles picking off British troops from time to time.[tpl]Harvnb|Johnston|1878|p=152[/tpl].
The American plan was that Putnam would direct the defenses from Brooklyn Heights while Sullivan and Stirling and their troops would be stationed on the Guan Heights.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=162[/tpl].[tpl]Harvnb|Lengel|2005|p=141[/tpl] The heights were up to 150 feet high and blocked the most direct route to Brooklyn Heights.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=162[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Lengel|2005|p=141[/tpl]. Washington believed by stationing men on the heights that heavy casualties could be inflicted on the British before the troops fell back to the main defenses at Brooklyn Heights.[tpl]Harvnb|Lengel|2005|p=142[/tpl]. There were three main passes through the heights; the Gowanus Road furthest to the west, the Flatbush Road slightly farther to the east, in the center of the American line where it was expected the British would attack, and the Bedford Road farthest to the east. Stirling was responsible to defend the Gowanus Road with 500 men, and Sullivan was to defend the Flatbush and Bedford Roads where there were 1,000 and 800 men respectively. 6,000 troops would remain behind at Brooklyn Heights. There was one lesser-known pass through the heights farther to the east called the Jamaica Pass. This pass was defended by just five militia officers on horses.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=163[/tpl].
On the British side, General Clinton learned of the almost undefended Jamaica Pass from local Loyalists.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=165[/tpl]. Clinton drew up a plan and gave it to William Erskine to propose to Howe. Clinton's plan had the main army making a night march and going through the Jamaica Pass to turn the American flank while other troops would keep the Americans busy in front.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=166[/tpl]. On August 26, Clinton received word from Howe that the plan would be used, and that Clinton was to command the advance guard of the main army of 10,000 men on the march through the Jamaica Pass. While they made the night march, General James Grant's British troops along with some Hessians, a total of 4,000 men, would attack the Americans in front to distract them from the main army coming on their flank. Howe told Clinton to be ready to move out that night, August 26.

===Night March===

At 21:00, the British moved out.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=168[/tpl]. No one, except the commandersâ€”not even the officersâ€”knew of the plan. Clinton led a crack brigade of light infantry with fixed bayonets in front, followed by Cornwallis who had eight battalions and 14 artillery pieces. Cornwallis was, in turn, followed by Howe and Hugh Percy with six battalions, more artillery, and baggage. The column consisted of 10,000 men who stretched out over two miles. Three Loyalist farmers led the column toward the Jamaica Pass. The British had left their campfires burning to deceive the Americans into thinking that nothing was happening. The column headed northeast until it reached what later became the village of New Lots when it headed directly north, toward the Heights.
The column had yet to run into any American troops when they reached Howard's Tavern (also known as Howard's Half-Way House), just a few hundred yards from the Jamaica Pass.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=169[/tpl]. The tavern keeper William Howard and his son William Jr. were forced to act as guides to show the British the way to the Rockaway Foot Path, an old Indian trail that skirted the Jamaica Pass to the west (located today in the Cemetery of the Evergreens). Five minutes after leaving the tavern, the five American militia officers stationed at the Pass were captured without a shot fired, as they thought the British were Americans.[tpl]Harvnb|McCullough|2006|p=170[/tpl]. Clinton interrogated the men and they informed him that they were the only troops guarding the pass. By dawn the British were through the pass and stopped so that the troops could rest. At 09:00, they fired two heavy cannons to signal the Hessian troops below Battle Pass to begin their frontal assault against Sullivan's men deployed on the two hills flanking the pass while Clinton's troops simultaneously flanked the American positions from the east.
