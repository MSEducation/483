==Biography==

===Early life===

In 1793, Dinmani Sharma was born to a Brahmin family in town of Datiya which still sits in the Lucknow district   in the northern part of India.  From a young age, he had shown an inclination towards studying and was sent to a school in Kashi, one of the preeminent arts and scriptural learning centers in India.Sadhu Bhagwatpriyadas. Satsang Reader 2. 4th. Amdavad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith, 2009. There, young Dinmani came to realize that one cannot attain the bliss of God merely through the study of scriptures, but rather, through the association of an enlightened being.  
	Once he completed his studies in Kashi, Dinmani set out on a quest to find such an enlightened being.  His travels took him from Kashi in the north to Jagannath Puri in the east to Rameswaram in the south.  Eventually, Dinmani went to Gujarat in the west and visited Dwarika.  It was here that Dinmani first heard the name of Swaminarayan.  Dinmani met Swaminarayan in the town of Unza and upon first meeting decided that his journey has ended and recognized that Swaminarayan was the enlightened being he sought.  Dinmani was later initiated as a sadhu by Swaminarayan in Meghpur and given the name Nityanand Swami.

===Life as a Sadhu===

Even though he had studied a great amount, Lord Swaminarayan instructed Nityanand Swami to continue further studies.   Nityanand Swami was considered one of the foremost scholars and debaters of Hindu scriptures of his era.   Along with Gopalanand Swami, Muktanand Swami and Shukanand Swami, Nityanand Swami was one of the four compilers of the Vachanamrutam, the written recordings of the sermons of Lord Swaminarayan.Williams, Raymond. An Introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism. 1st. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001. 187
Nityanand Swami was one of the first to openly state their belief that Lord Swaminarayan was the Supreme Lord.  He was steadfast in following the words and deeds of Lord Swaminarayan. 
Nityanand Swami died on Magshar Sud VS 1903 in the town of Vartal, India.

==Life's Works==

Besides his work in compiling the Vachanamrutam, Nityanand Swami also wrote many other volumes which included the commentary on the Shikshapatri, a code of ethics written by Swaminarayan, the Hari Digvijay, a 49-chapter volume which attempts to establish that Swaminarayan is supreme, the Hari Kavach, the Shri Hanuman Kavach, the Nishkaam Shuddhi, the Avatar Charitra, and a number of others.Williams, Monier.
