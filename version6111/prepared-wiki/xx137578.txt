Romberg attended the University of Miami, where he played for the Miami Hurricanes football team from 1999 to 2002.  As senior in 2002, he was distinguished as the best center in the nation when he was awarded the Dave Rimington Trophy and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American at center.2011 NCAA Football Records Book, Award Winners, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Indianapolis, Indiana, p. 11 (2011).

With Romberg at center, the Hurricanes won 35 of 37 games, one BCS National Championship (2001), three Big East Conference championships (2000, 2001, 2002), a Sugar Bowl (2001) and a Rose Bowl (2002).
Romberg never allowed a quarterback sack at center and was part of an offensive line that helped produce three 1,000-yard rushers (James Jackson, Clinton Portis and Willis McGahee), a quarterback (Ken Dorsey) who set every major Hurricanes career passing record and an offense that averaged more than 465 yards per game for the balance of his three years as the starting center.

After a stint with the Jacksonville Jaguars, Romberg became the starting center for the St. Louis Rams for a brief time in 2008, replacing Andy McCollum, but he was replaced in 2009 by Jason Brown.  In 2009, Romberg was a reserve offensive lineman for the  Atlanta Falcons.  He was released by the Falcons on September 4, 2010.
Due to an injury to starting center Todd McClure, the Falcons re-signed Romberg on August 30, 2011.  However, he was released during final cuts on September 3, but was re-signed on September 12.
