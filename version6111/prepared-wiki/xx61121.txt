===Coat of arms===

The school's coat of arms was originally shown as a black skull-and-crossbones on a field of white. This was later changed to a white tau Cross (symbolizing the "T" in Trinian's) on a black field bordered white.

===School motto===

The school has no fixed motto but has had several suggested ones. The school's motto is depicted in the original movies from the 1950s and 1960s as In flagrante delicto ("Caught in the Act"). This can be seen on the trophy shelf, above the stairs in The Belles of St Trinian's (1954). The lyrics of the original theme song by Sidney Galliat (c. 1954) implies that the school's motto is "Get your blow in first"[tpl]cite book |editor-last=Webb |editor-first=Kaye |title=The St Trinian's Story |location=London; New York (respectively) |publisher=Perpetua Books; London House & Maxwell |year=1959 |pages=44–45 |oclc=2898524[/tpl] (Semper debeatis percutis ictu primo). A poem in one of Searle's books called "St Trinian's Soccer Song" by D. B. Wyndham Lewis and Johnny Dankworth states the motto is Floreat St. Trinian's ("May St. Trinian's Bloom/Flourish"),[tpl]cite book |editor-last=Webb |editor-first=Kaye |title=The St Trinian's Story |location=London; New York (respectively) |publisher=Perpetua Books; London House & Maxwell |year=1959 |pages=46–48 |oclc=2898524[/tpl] a sly reference to the motto of Eton (Floreat Etona—"May Eton Flourish").

===School song===

The musical score for the St. Trinian films was written by Malcolm Arnold and included the school song, with words accredited to Sidney Gilliat (1954):

 Maidens of St Trinian's, gird your armour on.
 Grab the nearest weapon; never mind which one.
The battle's to the strongest; might is always right.
Trample on the weakest; glory in their plight.
St Trinian's! St Trinian's! Our battle cry.
St Trinian's! St Trinian's! Will never die.
Stride towards your fortune boldly on your way,
Never once forgetting there's one born every day.
Let our motto be broadcast: "get your blow in first!"
She who draws the sword last always comes off worst.
In the 2007 film, a new school song was written by Girls Aloud called "Defenders of Anarchy":
 Make us worthy, make us proud
 Teach us not to be too loud
We'll try to fit in with the crowd
But we are St. Trinian's
We can't fake the way we feel
We were born to keep it real
Hockey sticks and balls of steel
We are St. Trinian's
You bite us, we'll bite you back
Better be scared when we attack
Feel the fear, we're maniacs
St. Trinian's
Check out our battle cry
A song to terrify
No one can stand in our way
Refrain 1: We are the best, so screw the rest
We do as we damn well please
Until the end
St. Trinian's
Defenders of anarchy
R.2: So scam all the toffs, the neaks and the freaks
Blackmail the goths, the slappers and the geeks
And if they complain, we'll do it all again
We do as we damn well please
The ASBOs, the chavs, the emos and their mates
To torment the slags, we offer special rates
And if they complain, we'll do it all again
Defenders of anarchy
R.1:
ST. TRINIAN'S!
R.2:
Check out our battle cry
A song to terrify
No one can stand in our way
R.1:
Victorious, rebellious
We do as we damn well please
Until the end
St. Trinian's
Defenders of anarchy
ST. TRINIAN'S!

===Football song===

The school fight song:
 Whack it up, girls! Bung the ball
 Thro' Life's goalposts at the call.
Who can stay the Island Blood?
Rub their bustles in the mud!
Gallant hearts and bulldog pans,
Floreat St. Trinian's!
