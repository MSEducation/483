Avenir Club Avignonnais is a French association football team from the city of Avignon, Vaucluse, currently playing in Division d'honneur (6th division in the French football league system).

==History==

The club was founded in 1931 as Association Sportive Avignonaise and played professionally from 1942 until 1948. The club was later renamed Olympique Avignonnais in a merger with Saint-Jean and became professional again in 1965.
In 1975, the team was promoted to Division 1, after winning a playoff match against FC Rouen. However, the 1975–1976 season was disastrous, as the club finished bottom with 20 Points, 7 victories, 6 draws, 23 defeats, with 30 goals scored and 80 goals conceded. The club was relegated from Division 2 in 1976 and had to forgo its professional status in 1981 due to financial problems.
The club found itself in the fourth division in 1983–1984, but bounced back to Division 2 after successive promotions from 1989 to 1991. In 1992, the club was renamed Club Olympique Avignonnais after a merger with Sporting Club Avignonais. Relegation to the sixth division (Division d'honneur) followed in 1994. The club was renamed Avignon Foot 84 in 2003.
