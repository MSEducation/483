[[Chartered Certified Accountant]]

CATEGORIES: Accounting qualifications, Accounting in the United Kingdom

Chartered Certified Accountant (designatory letters ACCA or FCCA) was historically seen as a British qualified accountant designation awarded by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA).  However, although ACCA is UK based, it is a global body for professional accountants with 147,000 qualified members and 424,000 students globally.  Support offices/centres exist in 83 countries.  http://www.accaglobal.com/
The term Chartered Certified Accountant was introduced in 1996.  Prior to that date, ACCA members were known as Certified Accountant.  It is still permissible for an ACCA member to use this term. Members of ACCA with post-qualification experience of more than five years and have completed the required continued professional development are designated Fellows, and use the designatory letters FCCA in place of ACCA.
The term Chartered refers to the Royal Charter granted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.
Chartered Certified Accountants work in all fields of business and finance. Some are engaged in public practice work, others work in the private sector and some are employed by government bodies.
Since Chartered Certified Accountant is a legally protected term, individuals who describe themselves as such must be members of ACCA. If they carry out public practice engagements, they must comply with additional regulations such as holding a practising certificate, being insured against any possible liability claims and submitting to inspections.
