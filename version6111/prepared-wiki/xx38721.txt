Sanctacaris is a Middle Cambrian arthropod from the Burgess Shale of British Columbia. It was most famously regarded as a primitive chelicerate, a group which includes spiders and scorpions, although subsequent phylogenetic studies have not always supported this conclusion; it is best accommodated in the arachnate clade (i.e. as a stem-group chelicerate).
Sanctacaris specimens range from 46 to 93 mm in length.[tpl]cite journal |author=Briggs, Derek E. G. |author2=Collins, Desmond |year=1988 |title=A Middle Cambrian chelicerate from Mount Stephen, British Columbia |journal=Palaeontology |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=779–798 |url=http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2031/Pages%20779-798.pdf |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |format=PDF [/tpl] The head bears five pairs of grasping appendages and a sixth pair of large separate appendages. The grasping appendages each bear a short antenna-like second appendage. There are 11 body segments, each with a pair of walking legs and gills. There is a broad, flat paddle-like telson.
Originally Sanctacaris was called informally 'Santa Claws'. Its Latin name translates as "saintly crab".[tpl]fotbs[/tpl] Unlike most other Burgess forms, Sanctacaris is not present in Charles Walcott's 1909 quarry and was discovered at a different level by Desmond Collins in 1980–1981.[tpl]fotbs[/tpl]
