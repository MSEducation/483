==History and growth==

===Early history (2002-2006)===

Vantage Media was founded by two brothers, Mark and Todd DiPaola. Based in Venice, the company specialized early on in performance search marketing in online education. Clients included University of Phoenix, Kaplan, and other major distance learning providers. The company also became well known within the paid search space claiming to manage over 50 million keywords across the three major search engines.

===Expansion (2007-2012)===

In March 2007, Vantage Media raised a Series A round valued at $70M led by Montgomery & Co, Scale Venture Partners, Tudor Ventures, and Integral Capital Partners.[tpl]cite web|title=Search Ad Firm Vantage Media Gets $70 Million Round...|url=http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-search-ad-firm-vantage-media-gets-70-million-round/|accessdate=2013-08-20[/tpl] The company also named a new CEO, Steve Jillings, formerly of FrontBridge Technologies. As noted by Mr. Jillings in an interview with SoCalTech in early 2008, the financing was intended to allow Vantage to expand into new verticals outside of education, including home services, insurance, and consumer services.[tpl]cite web|title=Interview with Steve Jillings, Vantage Media...|url=http://www.socaltech.com/interview_with_steve_jillings_vantage_media/s-0016012.html|accessdate=2013-08-20[/tpl] It also named three new board members: Jamie Montgomery, CEO of Montgomery & Co., and Rory O'Driscoll, Managing Director with Scale Venture Partners.
The company completed its first acquisition in December 2007 with its purchase of the health insurance lead generation company Secure A Quote (SAQ). As part of the acquisition, Vantage brought on SAQ's two original founders, Jon Engleking and Steve Curry.[tpl]cite web|title=Vantage Media Makes First Acquisition: Secure A Quote, Leader in Insurance Lead Generation|url=http://www.vantagemedia.com/news.php?page=news4&link=link4|accessdate=2013-08-20[/tpl]
In October 2010, Vantage Media announced that Patrick Quigley, formerly a senior vice president at QuinStreet, would be replacing Jillings as CEO of the company.
The company completed its second acquisition in 2011, when it purchased leading pay-per-click insurance advertising firm, BrokersWeb.[tpl]cite web|title=Vantage Media Buys BrokersWeb...|url=http://leadconfidential.com/vantage-media-buys-brokersweb/|accessdate=2013-08-20[/tpl]
In 2012, Vantage Media launched SchoolSelect, a clicks product on the BrokersWeb platform that enabled advertisers target a new segment of customers with pre-defined parameters.[tpl]cite web|title=Vantage Media Introduces SchoolSelectâ„¢ A Pay-Per-Click Marketplace for Post-Secondary Schools...|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/prnewswire/press_releases/2012/03/21/FL73640|accessdate=2013-08-20[/tpl]

===Acceleration (2013-Present)===

In October 2013, Vantage Media launched a new platform, called Vantage Media Marketplaces. Marketplaces is a self-serve, real-time bidding platform for the insurance, home services, and education verticals. Marketplaces joins together high-traffic publishers with popular, household-name advertisers. It gives advertisers the power to pay what they want, when they want, and how they want, for the exact consumers they want. This is achieved through giving the advertiser the power to control how they want to engage with the customer, and vice versa, through either clicks, calls, or leads.
