Intel Corporation is an American multinational semiconductor chip maker corporation headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Intel is one of the world's largest and highest valued semiconductor chip makers, based on revenue.[tpl]cite web |url=http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/10/101302/2007annualReport/common/pdfs/intel_2007ar.pdf |title=Intel 2007 Annual Report |publisher=Intel |year=2007 |accessdate=July 6, 2011[/tpl] It is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers.
Intel Corporation, founded on July 18, 1968, is a portmanteau of Integrated Electronics (the fact that "intel" is the term for intelligence information also made the name appropriate).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1031210/secret-intel-revealed|title=Secret of Intel's name revealed|publisher=The Inquirer |year=2007 |accessdate=June 11, 2012[/tpl] Intel also makes motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphic chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing. Founded by semiconductor pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore and widely associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove, Intel combines advanced chip design capability with a leading-edge manufacturing capability. Though Intel was originally known primarily to engineers and technologists, its "Intel Inside" advertising campaign of the 1990s made it a household name, along with its Pentium processors.
Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, and this represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business. During the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry. During this period Intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for PCs, and was known for aggressive and sometimes illegal tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry.[tpl]Cite news|first=Dan |last=Goodin |title=Microsoft's holy war on Java |date=September 23, 1998 |publisher=CNET News.com |url=http://www.news.com/2009-1001-215854.html |work=news.com |accessdate=January 7, 2008 [/tpl][tpl]Cite news|first=Lea |last=Graham |title=USA versus Microsoft: the fourth week |date=December 14, 1998 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/04/98/microsoft/215645.stm |work=BBC News    |accessdate=January 7, 2008 [/tpl]

==Corporate history==

===Origins===

Intel was originally founded in Mountain View, California in 1968 by Gordon E. Moore (of "Moore's Law" fame, a chemist and physicist), Robert Noyce (a physicist and co-inventor of the integrated circuit), Arthur Rock (investor and venture capitalist), and Max Palevsky.[tpl]cite news|author=David B.

Rock was not an employee, but he was an investor and Chairman of the Board.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/history/historic-timeline.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130103012023/http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/history/historic-timeline.html |archivedate=2013-01-03 |title=Intel Online Museum: Corporate Timeline (Archived version) |work=Intel Museum |publisher=Intel|accessdate=July 23, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://silicongenesis.stanford.edu/transcripts/rock.htm |title=Silicon Genesis: Arthur Rock |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=July 23, 2011[/tpl] The total initial investment in Intel was $2.5 million convertible debentures and $10,000 from Rock. Just 2 years later, Intel completed their initial public offering (IPO), raising $6.8 million ($23.50 per share). Intel's third employee was Andy Grove,The Andrew Grove article explains how a clerical error exchanged the employee ID numbers of Grove and the fourth employee, Leslie L.

===Early history===

At its founding, Intel was distinguished by its ability to make semiconductors. Its first product, in 1969, was the 3101 Schottky TTL bipolar 64-bit  static random-access memory (SRAM), which was nearly twice as fast as earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan.1969 – Schottky-Barrier Diode Doubles the Speed of TTL Memory & Logic Computer History Museum. Retrieved September 23, 2011.Schottky Bipolar 3101, 3101A RAMs Google Docs.  In the same year Intel also produced the 3301 Schottky bipolar 1024-bit read-only memory (ROM)Schottky Bipolar 3301A ROM Google Docs. and the first commercial metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) silicon gate SRAM chip, the 256-bit 1101.[tpl]cite web|url=http://download.intel.com/museum/research/arc_collect/timeline/TimelineDateSort7_05.pdf |title=A chronological list of Intel products.

Intel's business grew during the 1970s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products, still dominated by various memory devices.
While Intel created the first commercially available microprocessor (Intel 4004) in 1971 and one of the first microcomputers in 1972,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/MUSEUM/computer.asp?c=754&st=1 |title=Intel Intellec Series |accessdate=July 31, 2007 |last=Silberhorn |first=Gottfried |coauthors=Colin Douglas Howell |work=old-computers.com |publisher=OLD-COMPUTERS.COM [/tpl] by the early 1980s its business was dominated by dynamic random-access memory chips. However, increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had, by 1983, dramatically reduced the profitability of this market, and the sudden success of the IBM personal computer convinced then-CEO Andrew Grove to shift the company's focus to microprocessors, and to change fundamental aspects of that business model.
By the end of the 1980s this decision had proven successful. Buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to IBM and IBM's competitors within the rapidly growing personal computer market, Intel embarked on a 10-year period of unprecedented growth as the primary (and most profitable) hardware supplier to the PC industry. By launching its Intel Inside marketing campaign in 1991, Intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection, so that by the end of the 1993s, its line of Pentium processors had become a household name.

===Slowing demand and challenges to dominance===

After 2000, growth in demand for high-end microprocessors slowed. Competitors, notably AMD (Intel's largest competitor in its primary x86 architecture market), garnered significant market share, initially in low-end and mid-range processors but ultimately across the product range, and Intel's dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060731&slug=btintelchip31|title=Intel Core 2 Duo a big leap in chip race|last=Wong|first=Nicole|date=July 31, 2006|work=Seattle Times|accessdate=October 15, 2009[/tpl] In the early 2000s then-CEO Craig Barrett attempted to diversify the company's business beyond semiconductors, but few of these activities were ultimately successful.
Intel had also for a number of years been embroiled in litigation. US law did not initially recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology (circuit layouts), until the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, a law sought by Intel and the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).The Senate Report on the bill (S.Rep. No. 425, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. (1984)) stated: "In the semiconductor industry, innovation is indispensable; research breakthroughs are essential to the life and health of the industry. But research and innovation in the design of semiconductor chips are threatened by the inadequacies of existing legal protection against piracy and unauthorized copying. This problem, which is so critical to this essential sector of the American economy, is addressed by the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984. ...bill would prohibit "chip piracy"--the unauthorized copying and distribution of semiconductor chip products copied from the original creators of such works." Quoted in Brooktree Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 977 F.2d 1555, 17 (Fed. Cir. 1992). See also Brooktree, 21–22 (copyright and patent law ineffective). During the late 1980s and 1990s (after this law was passed) Intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the 80386 CPU."Bill Gates Speaks", page 29. ISBN 978-0-471-40169-8 The lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills, even if Intel lost the suits. Antitrust allegations had been simmering since the early 1990s and had been the cause of one lawsuit against Intel in 1991. In 2004 and 2005, AMD brought further claims against Intel related to unfair competition.
In 2005, CEO Paul Otellini reorganized the company to refocus its core processor and chipset business on platforms (enterprise, digital home, digital health, and mobility).

==Product and market history==

===SRAMS and the microprocessor===

Intel's first products were shift register memory and random-access memory integrated circuits, and Intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive DRAM, SRAM, and ROM markets throughout the 1970s. Concurrently, Intel engineers Marcian Hoff, Federico Faggin, Stanley Mazor and Masatoshi Shima invented Intel's first microprocessor. Originally developed for the Japanese company Busicom to replace a number of ASICs in a calculator already produced by Busicom, the Intel 4004 was introduced to the mass market on November 15, 1971, though the microprocessor did not become the core of Intel's business until the mid-1980s. (Note: Intel is usually given credit with Texas Instruments for the almost-simultaneous invention of the microprocessor)

===From DRAM to microprocessors===

In 1983, at the dawn of the personal computer era, Intel's profits came under increased pressure from Japanese memory-chip manufacturers, and then-president Andy Grove focused the company on microprocessors. Grove described this transition in the book Only the Paranoid Survive. A key element of his plan was the notion, then considered radical, of becoming the single source for successors to the popular 8086 microprocessor.
Until then, the manufacture of complex integrated circuits was not reliable enough for customers to depend on a single supplier,[tpl]clarify|date=October 2013[/tpl] but Grove began producing processors in three geographically distinct factories,[tpl]which|date=October 2013[/tpl] and ceased licensing the chip designs to competitors such as Zilog and AMD.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] When the PC industry boomed in the late 1980s and 1990s, Intel was one of the primary beneficiaries.

===Intel, x86 processors, and the IBM PC===

Despite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor, the 4004 and its successors the 8008 and the 8080 were never major revenue contributors at Intel. As the next processor, the 8086 (and its variant the 8088) was completed in 1978, Intel embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed "Operation Crush", and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible. One design win was the newly created IBM PC division, though the importance of this was not fully realized at the time.
IBM introduced its personal computer in 1981, and it was rapidly successful. In 1982, Intel created the 80286 microprocessor, which, two years later, was used in the IBM PC/AT. Compaq, the first IBM PC "clone" manufacturer, produced a desktop system based on the faster 80286 processor in 1985 and in 1986 quickly followed with the first 80386-based system, beating IBM and establishing a competitive market for PC-compatible systems and setting up Intel as a key component supplier.
In 1975 the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced 32-bit microprocessor, finally released in 1981 as the Intel iAPX 432. The project was too ambitious and the processor was never able to meet its performance objectives, and it failed in the marketplace. Intel extended the x86 architecture to 32 bits instead.

====386 microprocessor====

During this period Andrew Grove dramatically redirected the company, closing much of its DRAM business and directing resources to the microprocessor business. Of perhaps greater importance was his decision to "single-source" the 386 microprocessor. Prior to this, microprocessor manufacturing was in its infancy, and manufacturing problems frequently reduced or stopped production, interrupting supplies to customers. To mitigate this risk, these customers typically insisted that multiple manufacturers produce chips they could use to ensure a consistent supply. The 8080 and 8086-series microprocessors were produced by several companies, notably AMD. Grove made the decision not to license the 386 design to other manufacturers, instead producing it in three geographically distinct factories: Santa Clara, California; Hillsboro, Oregon; and Chandler, a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona. He convinced customers that this would ensure consistent delivery. As the success of Compaq's Deskpro 386 established the 386 as the dominant CPU choice, Intel achieved a position of near-exclusive dominance as its supplier. Profits from this funded rapid development of both higher-performance chip designs and higher-performance manufacturing capabilities, propelling Intel to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early 1990s.

====486, Pentium, and Itanium====

Intel introduced the 486 microprocessor in 1989, and in 1990 formally established a second design team, designing the processors code-named "P5" and "P6" in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years, versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken. Engineers Vinod Dham and Rajeev Chandrasekhar (Member of Parliament, India) were key figures on the core team that invented the 486 chip and later, Intel's signature Pentium chip. The P5 was earlier known as "Operation Bicycle," referring to the cycles of the processor. The P5 was introduced in 1993 as the Intel Pentium, substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number (numbers, such as 486, are hard to register as a trademark). The P6 followed in 1995 as the Pentium Pro and improved into the Pentium II in 1997. New architectures were developed alternately in Santa Clara, California and Hillsboro, Oregon.
The Santa Clara design team embarked in 1993 on a successor to the x86 architecture, codenamed "P7". The first attempt was dropped a year later, but quickly revived in a cooperative program with Hewlett-Packard engineers, though Intel soon took over primary design responsibility. The resulting implementation of the IA-64 64-bit architecture was the Itanium, finally introduced in June 2001. The Itanium's performance running legacy x86 code did not meet expectations, and it failed to compete effectively with x86-64, which was AMD's 64-bit extensions to the original x86 architecture (Intel uses the name Intel 64, previously EM64T). As of 2012, Intel continues to develop and deploy the Itanium; known planning continues into 2014.
The Hillsboro team designed the Willamette processors (initially code-named P68), which were marketed as the Pentium 4.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]

====Pentium flaw====

In June 1994, Intel engineers discovered a flaw in the floating-point math subsection of the P5 Pentium microprocessor. Under certain data-dependent conditions, the low-order bits of the result of a floating-point division would be incorrect. The error could compound in subsequent calculations. Intel corrected the error in a future chip revision, but nonetheless declined to disclose it.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]
In October 1994, Dr. Thomas Nicely, Professor of Mathematics at Lynchburg College, independently discovered the bug. He contacted Intel, but received no response. On October 30, he posted a message on the Internet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emery.com/nicely.htm |title=Dr. Thomas Nicely's Pentium email |accessdate=July 12, 2007 |last=Nicely |first=Dr. Thomas R. |date=October 30, 1994 |publisher=Vince Emery Productions [/tpl] Word of the bug spread quickly and reached the industry press. The bug was easy to replicate; a user could enter specific numbers into the calculator on the operating system. Consequently, many users did not accept Intel's statements that the error was minor and "not even an erratum." During Thanksgiving, in 1994, The New York Times ran a piece by journalist John Markoff spotlighting the error. Intel changed its position and offered to replace every chip, quickly putting in place a large end-user support organization. This resulted in a $500 million charge against Intel's 1994 revenue.
Ironically, the "Pentium flaw" incident, Intel's response to it, and the surrounding media coverage propelled Intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name. Dovetailing with an uptick in the "Intel Inside" campaign, the episode is considered to have been a positive event for Intel, changing some of its business practices to be more end-user focused and generating substantial public awareness, while avoiding a lasting negative impression.Grove, Andrew and Burgleman, Robert; Strategy Is Destiny: How Strategy-Making Shapes a Company's Future, 2001, Free Press

===="Intel Inside" and other 1990s programs====

During this period, Intel undertook two major supporting programs. The first is widely known: the 1991 "Intel Inside" marketing and branding campaign. The idea of ingredient branding was new at the time with only Nutrasweet and a few others making attempts to do so.[tpl]Cite book|author=Richard S. Tedlow|title=Andy Grove: The Life and Times of an American Business Icon|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zQamXENAalkC&pg=RA1-PA256|page=256|year=2007|isbn=978-1-59184-182-1[/tpl] This campaign established Intel, which had been a component supplier little-known outside the PC industry, as a household name.
The second program is little-known: Intel's Systems Group began, in the early 1990s, manufacturing PC "motherboards", the main board component of a personal computer, and the one into which the processor (CPU) and memory (RAM) chips are plugged.[tpl]cite web|last=Wilson |first=Tracy V. |url= http://computer.howstuffworks.com/motherboard.htm |title= HowStuffWorks "How Motherboards Work" |publisher=Computer.howstuffworks.com |accessdate=July 29, 2010[/tpl] Shortly after, Intel began manufacturing fully configured "white box" systems for the dozens of PC clone companies that rapidly sprang up.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] At its peak in the mid-1990s, Intel manufactured over 15% of all PCs, making it the third-largest supplier at the time.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
During the 1990s, Intel's Architecture Lab (IAL) was responsible for many of the hardware innovations of the personal computer, including the PCI Bus, the PCI Express (PCIe) bus, the Universal Serial Bus (USB). IAL's software efforts met with a more mixed fate; its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video,[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from Microsoft. The competition between Intel and Microsoft was revealed in testimony by IAL Vice-President Steven McGeady at the Microsoft antitrust trial.

===Competition, antitrust and espionage===

Two factors combined to end this dominance: the slowing of PC demand growth beginning in 2000 and the rise of the low cost PC. By the end of the 1990s, microprocessor performance had outstripped software demand for that CPU power. Aside from high-end server systems and software, whose demand dropped with the end of the "dot-com bubble", consumer systems ran effectively on increasingly low-cost systems after 2000. Intel's strategy of producing ever-more-powerful processors and obsoleting their predecessors stumbled,[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] leaving an opportunity for rapid gains by competitors, notably AMD. This in turn lowered the profitability[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] of the processor line and ended an era of unprecedented dominance of the PC hardware by Intel.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]
Intel's dominance in the x86 microprocessor market led to numerous charges of antitrust violations over the years, including FTC investigations in both the late 1980s and in 1999, and civil actions such as the 1997 suit by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and a patent suit by Intergraph. Intel's market dominance (at one time[tpl]When|date=May 2009[/tpl] it controlled over 85% of the market for 32-bit x86 microprocessors) combined with Intel's own hardball legal tactics (such as its infamous 338 patent suit versus PC manufacturers)[tpl]Cite news|first=Richard |last=McCausland |title=Counterpunch: Amx86 buyers get 'legal aid.' – Advanced Micro Devices offers legal aid to manufactures of Amx86-based machines warned by Intel Corp. to take out patent licenses |date=May 24, 1993 |publisher=LookSmart Ltd. |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EKF/is_n1964_v39/ai_13901771 |work=FindArticles |accessdate=July 12, 2007 [/tpl] made it an attractive target for litigation, but few of the lawsuits ever amounted to anything.[tpl]Clarify|date=May 2009[/tpl]

===Advertising and brand management===

====Intel Inside====

Intel has become one of the world's most recognizable computer brands following its long-running Intel Inside campaign. The campaign, which started in 1991, was created by Intel marketing manager Dennis Carter.[tpl]cite web|title=Intel Inside Program: Anatomy of a Brand Campaign|url=http://www.intel.com/pressroom/intel_inside.htm|publisher=Intel Corporation|accessdate=July 22, 2011[/tpl] The five-note jingle was introduced in 1994 and by its tenth anniversary was being heard in 130 countries around the world. The initial branding agency for the Intel Inside campaign was DahlinSmithWhite Advertising of Salt Lake City. The Intel swirl logo was the work of DahlinSmithWhite art director Steve Grigg under the direction of Intel president and CEO Andy Grove.
The Intel Inside advertising campaign sought public brand loyalty and awareness of Intel processors in consumer computers.[tpl]Cite news|title=Intel plans a huge fall campaign for Pentium, its latest and most powerful computer chip.|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/24/business/media-business-advertising-intel-plans-huge-fall-campaign-for-pentium-its-latest.html | first=Stuart | last=Elliott | date=August 24, 1994 | work=The New York Times[/tpl] Intel paid some of the advertiser's costs for an ad that used the Intel Inside logo and xylomarimba jingle.[tpl]cite web|title=Intel mulls branding for handheld chips |url=http://news.cnet.com/Intel-mulls-branding-for-handheld-chips/2100-1041_3-1014468.html[/tpl]

====Sonic logo====

The famous D♭  D♭  G♭  D♭  A♭ xylophone/xylomarimba jingle, sonic logo, tag, audio mnemonic was produced by Musikvergnuegen and written by Walter Werzowa, once a member of the Austrian 1980s sampling band Edelweiss.[tpl]Cite news|author=Paul Morley|title=Boot me up, Dessie|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,4774366-111639,00.html|work=The Observer  |location=UK |date=October 19, 2003|accessdate=January 17, 2009 [/tpl] The sonic Intel logo has undergone substantial changes in tone since the introduction of the Pentium III, Pentium 4, and Core processors, yet keeps the same jingle.

====Naming strategy====

In 2006, Intel expanded its promotion of open specification platforms beyond Centrino, to include the Viiv media center PC and the business desktop Intel vPro.
In mid January 2006, Intel announced that they were dropping the long running Pentium name from their processors. The Pentium name was first used to refer to the P5 core Intel processors (Pent refers to the 5 in P5,) and was done to circumvent court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers, so competitors could not just call their processor the same name, as had been done with the prior 386 and 486 processors (both of which had copies manufactured by IBM and AMD). They phased out the Pentium names from mobile processors first, when the new Yonah chips, branded Core Solo and Core Duo, were released. The desktop processors changed when the Core 2 line of processors were released. By 2009 Intel was using a good-better-best strategy with Celeron being good, Pentium better, and the Intel Core family representing the best the company has to offer.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/166973/intels_chip_renaming_strategy_meets_resistance.html |title=Intel's Chip Renaming Strategy Meets Resistance |last=Shah |first=Agam |work=PC World |accessdate=June 22, 2009[/tpl]
According to spokesman Bill Calder, Intel has maintained only the Celeron brand, the Atom brand for netbooks and the vPro lineup for businesses. Since late 2009, Intel's mainstream processors have been called Celeron, Pentium, Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7, in order of performance from lowest to highest. The first generation core products carry a 3 digit name, such as i5 750, and the second generation products carry a 4 digit name, such as the i5 2500. In both cases, a K at the end of it shows that it is an unlocked processor, enabling additional overclocking abilities (for instance, 2500K). vPro products will carry the Intel Core i7 vPro processor or the Intel Core i5 vPro processor name.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2348923,00.asp |title=Intel Simplifying its Processor Branding |last=Hachman |first=Mark |date=June 17, 2009 |work=PC Magazine |accessdate=July 6, 2009[/tpl] In October 2011, Intel started to sell its Core i7-2700K "Sandy Bridge" chip to customers worldwide.Anton Shilov, XBitLabs. "Intel Quietly Starts to Sell New “Unlocked” Core i7 Chip." October 24, 2011. Retrieved October 26, 2011.
Beginning in 2010 "Centrino" will only be applied to Intel's WiMAX and Wi-Fi technologies; it won't be a PC brand anymore. This will be an evolutionary process taking place over time, Intel acknowledges that multiple brands will be in the market including older ones throughout the transition.

===Open source support===

Intel has a significant participation in the open source communities. For example, in 2006 Intel released MIT-licensed X.org drivers for their integrated graphic cards of the i965 family of chipsets. Intel released FreeBSD drivers for some networking cards,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=em |title=FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual |accessdate=August 5, 2007 |date=November 27, 2005 |work=freebsd.org |publisher=The FreeBSD Project [/tpl] available under a BSD-compatible license, which were also ported to OpenBSD.

However, after the release of the wireless products called Intel Pro/Wireless 2100, 2200BG/2225BG/2915ABG and 3945ABG in 2005, Intel was criticized for not granting free redistribution rights for the firmware that must be included in the operating system for the wireless devices to operate.[tpl]Cite news|first=Sam |last=Varghese |title=OpenBSD to support more wireless chipsets |date=March 1, 2005 |publisher=The Age Company Ltd |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/03/01/1109546842718.html |work=The Age |location=Australia |accessdate=August 5, 2007 | location=Melbourne[/tpl] As a result of this, Intel became a target of campaigns to allow free operating systems to include binary firmware on terms acceptable to the open source community.

==Competition==

In the 1980s, Intel was among the top ten sellers of semiconductors (10th in 1987) in the world. In 1991, Intel became the biggest chip maker by revenue and has held the position ever since. Other top semiconductor companies include TSMC, Advanced Micro Devices, Samsung, Texas Instruments, Toshiba and STMicroelectronics.
Competitors in PC chip sets include AMD, VIA Technologies, SiS, and Nvidia. Intel's competitors in networking include Freescale, Infineon, Broadcom, Marvell Technology Group and AMCC, and competitors in flash memory include Spansion, Samsung, Qimonda, Toshiba, STMicroelectronics, and Hynix.
The only major competitor in the x86 processor market is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), with which Intel has had full cross-licensing agreements since 1976: each partner can use the other's patented technological innovations without charge after a certain time.[tpl]Cite news|first=Ian |last=Fried |title=Intel, AMD sign new licensing deal |date=April 4, 2001 |publisher=CNET Networks, Inc |url=http://news.com.com/2100-1040-257059.html |work=news.com.com |accessdate=July 28, 2007 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/9iBs|archivedate=December 16, 2012[/tpl] However, the cross-licensing agreement is canceled in the event of an AMD bankruptcy or takeover.[tpl]Cite news|title=Patent Cross License Agreement – Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp. |publisher=Findlaws, Inc |url=http://contracts.corporate.findlaw.com/agreements/amd/intel.license.2001.01.01.html |accessdate=September 15, 2007 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl] Some smaller competitors such as VIA and Transmeta produce low-power x86 processors for small factor computers and portable equipment.

On July 22, 2010, Dell agreed to a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pay $100M in penalties resulting from charges that Dell did not accurately disclose accounting information to investors. In particular, the SEC charged that from 2002 to 2006, Dell had an agreement with Intel to receive rebates in exchange for not using chips manufactured by AMD. These substantial rebates were not disclosed to investors, but were used to help meet investor expectations regarding the company's financial performance; "These exclusivity payments grew from 10 percent of Dell’s operating income in FY 2003 to 38 percent in FY 2006, and peaked at 76 percent in the first quarter of FY 2007.".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-131.htm|title=SEC Charges Dell and Senior Executives with Disclosure and Accounting Fraud[/tpl] Dell eventually did adopt AMD as a secondary supplier in 2006, and Intel subsequently stopped their rebates, causing Dell's financial performance to fall.[ref]
