"If You're Reading This" is the second song in McGraw's career that has charted from a live performance. In 2001, "unknown fans" taped McGraw's performance of the song "Things Change" during the CMA awards, and posted the recording to Napster; as a result, several stations downloaded and played the live telecast of that song.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1472421/20030609/mcgraw_tim.jhtml |title= CMT.com: Tim McGraw: "Things Change" â€” But the Questions Keep Coming |accessdate=2007-05-31 |format= |work=CMT.com[/tpl]
