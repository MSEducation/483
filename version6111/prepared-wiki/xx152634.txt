[[Bel's Boys]]

CATEGORIES: Boy bands from Northern Ireland

Bel's Boys refers to a pop/rock band based in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and also to a children's television program which the band feature in.

==The band==

The three members of the band are Graham McKee (lead vocals/bass guitar) as Vince, Luke O'Reilly (lead guitar/vocals) as Leon and Eoin Logan (drums/vocals) as Tay. Their sound is similar to that of acts such as The Monkees, McFly and Led Zeppelin. They came together in the early part of 2006 to begin work on their debut album People Let's Go, and to film the first part of their television series. They have been signed to Universal Music and the album was released in April 2007. An exclusive download only release of "Can't Go There Again" was made available on 3 November 2007. They performed around in Primary Schools, culminating in a main-stage performance at the 21st World Scout Jamboree. This was the height of the band's success and they went their separate ways in 2007, however their fans hope for a reunion. The media has quashed speculation so far, however in late 2011 the youthful-looking Eoin Logan (who was 28 when filming for the show began) was quoted as saying "I would welcome a return to the band and would love to reprise my role of Tay again. I feel that the character still has a lot of potential and I have a few ideas on how I would like to develop him. A part of me will always be Tay".[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Eoin is now completing a History and Theatre Studies degree at the University of Glasgow.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

==The programme==

Bel's Boys was made by Initial (part of the Endemol group) and was part funded by the NIFTC (Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission). The series was filmed entirely in Belfast.
On the CITV television programme Graham as Vince, Luke as Leon and Eoin as Tay play the star rolls in the television series. The show follows the progress of the band as they try to reach the top. The show begins with the band being rejected by a talent agent, only to have his nine year old daughter, Bel Barter, played by Allanah Scully, assume the role of the band's manager.
