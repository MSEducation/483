Ravenswood is a railroad station on the North Side of Chicago serving Metra's Union Pacific/North Line.  It is located at 4800 North Ravenswood Avenue, just south of West Lawrence Avenue. The Ravenswood Station formerly was located at Wilson Avenue, but was relocated at its current location to be opposite the Chicago & North Western Railway's  Ravenswood Accounting Office & Carload Tracing Bureau, which were housed in a building at 4801 North Ravenswood Avenue.[tpl]fact|date=March 2009[/tpl] In Metra's zone-based fare system, Ravenswood is in zone B. Ravenswood station is near the eastern edge of the Chicago neighborhood also known as Ravenswood and the western edge of Uptown.
The station consists of two side platforms, and does not contain a ticket agent booth.  Northbound trains stop on the west platform and southbound trains stop on the east platform.  Many express trains skip Ravenswood during rush hours; however, all weekend passenger trains stop at the station.  Trains go south to Ogilvie Transportation Center and as far north as Kenosha, Wisconsin. It is the busiest station on the UP/North Line and will be rebuilt starting in the fall of 2010 as part of a project that includes replacing 12 bridges along this line.[tpl]cite news|last=Wronski|first=Richard|title=Bridge rebuilding will mean changes for Metra commuters|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/northnorthwest/ct-met-metra-bridges-upnorth-0716-20100716,0,1386230.story|accessdate=July 26, 2010|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=July 16, 2010[/tpl]
