===Consequences of depletion of megafauna===

====Effect on nutrient transport====

Megafauna play a significant role in the lateral transport of mineral nutrients in an ecosystem, tending to translocate them from areas of high to those of lower abundance. They do so by their movement between the time they consume the nutrient and the time they release it through elimination (or, to a much lesser extent, through decomposition after death).[tpl]cite journal|last1=Wolf|first1=A.|last2=Doughty|first2=C. E.|last3=Malhi|first3=Y.|title=Lateral Diffusion of Nutrients by Mammalian Herbivores in Terrestrial Ecosystems|journal=PLoS ONE|volume= 8|issue= 8|date= 2013-08-09|pages= e71352|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0071352[/tpl] In South America's Amazon Basin, it is estimated that such lateral diffusion was reduced over 98% following the megafaunal extinctions that occurred roughly 12,500 years ago.[ref]
