The PC-5 rights were purchased by Cub Aircraft Limited for wartime production. Harlow in turn bought one-third interest in Porterfield Aircraft Corporation. A majority interest in the company was bought by Intercontinent Corporation in 1941 who then sold the company to Vultee Aircraft The company and facilities were subsequently used to build aircraft assemblies and components throughout the war.
