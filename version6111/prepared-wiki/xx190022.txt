For the quarter ended 31 March 2014, ABP had 2.8 million participants and assets under management of €309 billion http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/economie/home/kassen-vol-maar-pensioenen-niet-hoger#node_804341 ($427 billion, 1 EUR=1.38 USD), making it the largest pension fund in the Netherlands and among the three largest pension funds in the world.Based on assets this designation changes frequently based on currency fluctuations
ABP’s predecessor, the Algemeen Burgerlijk Pensioenfonds ("Dutch Civil Servants Pension Fund"), was established in 1922 following the adoption of the superannuation act, which regulated the pensions of civil servants.  Originally, the pension fund was a government controlled entity that fell under the authority of the minister of home affairs in The Hague.  In January 1996, ABP was privatized although its primary function remains unchanged.
Since 1 March 2008 ABP's subsidiary APG administers the ABP pension scheme.
ABP is headquartered in Heerlen, Netherlands. Ed Nijpels took the chair as Chairman of the Board on 1 August 2009, he resigned in February 2010 because of his role in the failure of the DSB Bank.

==Pensions==

The pensions supplement statutory benefits such as the old age pension AOW, surviving dependents' pension, and incapacity benefits. If the participant stops working between the ages of 60 and 70, he/she will receive the ABP Multi-Option Pension. If the participant dies, his/her partner and children may receive an ABP Survivor’s Pension. If the participant becomes unfit for work, the government will pay incapacity benefits under the Work and Income (Ability to Work) Act (WIA); ABP can supplement these benefits with an incapacity pension.
Since 1 January 2004, ABP pensions are based on average salaries during the course of the pensioners’ careers. This is known as an average-salary scheme. As a transition measure, benefits accrued before 2004 are based on the salary on 1 January 2004. Only members of the armed forces now have pensions based on their final salariesABP.nl
Both contributions and accrual of benefits are based on the salary minus a threshold (2008: € 10,100 per year). The reason for the threshold is the fact that the pension is a supplement to the AOW, etc.

==Investments==

ABP manages the bulk of its investments in-house through its captive investment unit APG Investments, a privately owned investment manager. APG operates as a subsidiary of Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP and was formerly known as ABP Investments.
In 2006, ABP and PGGM, another large Dutch pension fund, considered a spinoff of their investment management businesses. The two pension funds coordinate their activities in private equity through AlpInvest Partners, one of the largest investors globally in the private equity asset class. Recently, AlpInvest Partners was acquired by the Carlyle group.
In January 2014, Dutch newspaper Trouw reported that ABP acknowledged continuing their investment in Israeli banks Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, and Bank Mizrahi-Tefahot, each of which fund Israeli settlement construction in the occupied Palestinian territories.http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4504/Economie/article/detail/3574645/2014/01/09/ABP-blijft-beleggen-in-Israelische-banken.dhtml
