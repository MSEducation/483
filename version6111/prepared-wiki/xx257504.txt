==History==

The area  around Kahana, especially mauka (up hill), was historically a native Hawaiian fishing and farming community prior to Western contact. Due to the abundant fresh water and fertile soil in the valley, the area was able to sustain a small population. Kahana Bay was said to provide a sustainable supply of fish and shellfish.http://www.hawaiistateparks.org/parks/oahu/index.cfm?park_id=13
