[[Identity (mathematics)]]

CATEGORIES: Elementary algebra, Mathematical identities

In mathematics, the term identity has several different important meanings:

==Examples==

===Identity relation===

A common example of the first meaning is the trigonometric identity
See also list of mathematical identities.

===Identity element===

The number 0 is the additive identity (identity element for the binary operation of addition) for integers, real numbers, and complex numbers. For every number a, including 0 itself, 
In a more general context, when a binary operation is denoted with [tpl]math|+[/tpl] and has an identity, this identity is commonly denoted by the symbol 0 (zero) and called an additive identity.
Similarly, the number 1 is the identity of the multiplication of numbers. It is often called the multiplicative identity for distinguishing it from the additive identity, zero. For every number a, including 1 itself,

===Identity function===

==Comparison==

Also, some care is sometimes needed to avoid ambiguities: 0 is the identity element for the addition of numbers and x + 0 = x is an identity. On the other hand, the identity function f(x) = x is not the identity element for the addition or the multiplication of functions (these are the constant functions 0 and 1), but is the identity element for the function composition.
