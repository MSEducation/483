==History==

The Columbus, Delaware, and Marion Railway was formed in 1901 to establish interurban service north of Columbus, Ohio. The CD&M Railway purchased the Columbus, Clinton and Worthington Street Railway. At the same time, a rival company, the Columbus, Delaware and Northern Railroad, acquired a right-of-way between Columbus and Marion. The CD&M Railway bought its rival and the railroad began interurban service in 1903. In October 1904, the CD&M incorporated as a holding company operating through its subsidiary the Columbus, Delaware, and Marion Electric Railroad.[tpl]cite news |title=GROWTH IN COTTON GINNING. |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A03EED71230EE32A2575BC2A9669D946597D6CF |work=The New York Times |date=1904-10-28 |pages=13 |accessdate=2008-01-05 | format=PDF[/tpl]
In 1908, the company built the Columbus, Marion, and Bucyrus Railway to connect Columbus to the Cleveland, Southwestern and Columbus Railway at Bucyrus with plans for service to Cleveland, Sandusky, and Toledo.
The Columbus Marion and Bucyrus operated passenger service from Columbus to Bucyrus and nightly through freight service between Columbus and Cleveland.
In 1909, both the CD&M Railway Company and its Bucyrus subsidiary went bankrupt. The Columbus, Marion and Bucyrus emerged from bankruptcy in 1914, and in 1917, the CD&M was reorganized as the Columbus, Delaware and Marion Electric Company.

===Decline and abandonment===

The Columbus, Marion and Bucyrus Railway lost money during the late 1920s. The railway went bankrupt in 1930 and was absorbed into Columbus, Delaware, and Marion in 1931.
In 1931, the Cleveland, Southwestern and Columbus Railway abandoned its rail lines, causing the CD&M to lose revenue from its Cleveland freight service in 1933
The company filed for bankruptcy in March 1933 and abandoned rail passenger service in August 1933.Brashares, p. 52 Passenger rail was replaced by bus service.
The CD&M Electric Company was merged with the Reserve Power Company to form Marion-Reserve Power Company in 1937.[tpl]cite news |title=BANK WINS A PLEA UNDER UTILITY ACT; SEC Lets a Unit Created by Manufacturers Trust Co.
