[[Gǁana language]]

CATEGORIES: Khoe languages, Languages of Botswana

Gǁana (pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|n|ə[/tpl] in English, and also spelled ǁGana, Gxana, Dxana, Xgana) is a Khoe dialect cluster of Botswana.  It is closely related to Naro, and includes the well-known dialect Gǀwi, which has the majority of speakers.
The double pipe at the beginning of the name "Gǁana" represents a click like the English interjection used when saying giddy-ap to a horse. For the clicks and other sounds found in Gǁana, see Gǀwi dialect.
