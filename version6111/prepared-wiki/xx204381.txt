In Australia, After Hours was the second album from the Australian rock band Little River Band. It was released in 1976 by EMI. The first single from the album, "Everyday of My Life", was a top-ten hit in Australia.LRB Timeline
Lead singer Glenn Shorrock names this Australian version of the album as his favourite album by the band.Little River Band Discography However, it was not released internationally until decades later. There were two reasons for this. Firstly, the band's record company contract at the time did not cover international releases. Secondly, at the time of its release in Australia, the band's first album, Little River Band, had not yet become a hit in the US. When the first album  entered the US charts, following the delayed success of single "It's a Long Way There", any potential US release of After Hours was delayed.
In the meantime, the band recorded their third album, Diamantina Cocktail. However, Capitol Records in the US deemed that album to be not commercial enough. In response, Capitol selected five tracks from the Australian After Hours plus four tracks from the Australian version of Diamantina Cocktail and released this compilation in the US under the name Diamantina Cocktail. On that album, the tracks from After Hours were released in different mixes than on the original album, "Days on the Road" was partly re-recorded and "Take Me Home" was completely re-recorded with the new lineup. Subsequently the remaining tracks from both Australian albums were compiled and released (in 1980) on another album, titled After Hours. Thus, all tracks from the two original Australian albums were eventually released in the US (remixed and re-recorded, to some extent), on albums of the same names as the Australian albums, but in a scrambled form across the two albums.Little River Band Discography The AllMusic rating for After Hours is for the version that is a compilation of leftovers from the Australian albums following the international release of Diamantina Cocktail.http://www.allmusic.com/album/after-hours-mw0000089169
The album, in its international form, was re-released with bonus tracks in 1997 by One Way Records.Allmusic On 30 July 2010, the original Australian version of After Hours became available for the first time in the US, as a download (in digitally remastered form) at the iTunes Store.
In between the recording of After Hours and Diamantina Cocktail, two founding members of the band departed: Ric Formosa (lead guitar) and Roger McLachlan (bass).
