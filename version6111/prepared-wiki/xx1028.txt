Corundum is a crystalline form of aluminium oxide ([tpl]chem|Al|2|O|3[/tpl]) with traces of iron, titanium and chromium. It is a rock-forming mineral. It is one of the naturally clear transparent materials, but can have different colors when impurities are present. Transparent specimens are used as gems, called ruby if red and padparadscha if pink-orange. All other colors are called sapphire, e.g., "green sapphire" for a green specimen. 
The name "corundum" is derived from Tamil word Kuruvindam or Sanskrit word  Kuruvinda  meaning ruby.[tpl]OEtymD|corundum[/tpl]
Because of corundum's hardness (pure corundum is defined to have 9.0 Mohs), it can scratch almost every other mineral. It is commonly used as an abrasive on everything from sandpaper to large machines used in machining metals, plastics, and wood. Some emery is a mix of corundum and other substances, and the mix is less abrasive, with an average Mohs hardness of 8.0. 
In addition to its hardness, corundum is unusual for its density of 4.02 g/cm3, which is very high for a transparent mineral composed of the low atomic mass elements aluminium and oxygen.The Mineral Corundum. galleries.com

==Geology and occurrence==

Corundum occurs as a mineral in mica schist, gneiss, and some marbles in metamorphic terranes. It also occurs in low silica igneous syenite and nepheline syenite intrusives. Other occurrences are as masses adjacent to ultramafic intrusives, associated with lamprophyre dikes and as large crystals in pegmatites. It commonly occurs as a detrital mineral in stream and beach sands because of its hardness and resistance to weathering. The largest documented single crystal of corundum measured about [tpl]convert|65|*|40|*|40|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], and weighed [tpl]convert|152|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885–907| year= 1981| title= The largest crystals| author = Rickwood, P.

Corundum for abrasives is mined in Zimbabwe, Russia, Sri Lanka and India. Historically it was mined from deposits associated with dunites in North Carolina, USA and from a nepheline syenite in Craigmont, Ontario. Emery grade corundum is found on the Greek island of Naxos and near Peekskill, New York, USA. Abrasive corundum is synthetically manufactured from bauxite. Four corundum axes dating back to 2500 BCE from the Liangzhou culture have been discovered in China. The surfaces of the axes are remarkably smoothly polished.

==Synthetic corundum==

In 1837, Marc Antoine Gaudin made the first synthetic rubies by fusing alumina at a high temperature with a small amount of chromium as a pigment.[tpl]cite journal| url = http://www.gem-a.com/media/94808/duroc%20danner%20website.pdf | journal = Journal of Gemmology| volume = 32| pages = 175–178|year= 2011| title=Untreated yellowish orange sapphire exhibiting its natural colour| author = Duroc-Danner, J. M. [/tpl]  In 1847, Ebelmen made white synthetic sapphires by fusing alumina in boric acid. In 1877 Frenic and Freil made crystal corundum from which small stones could be cut. Frimy and Auguste Verneuil manufactured artificial ruby by fusing [tpl]chem|BaF|2[/tpl] and [tpl]chem|Al|2|O|3[/tpl] with a little chromium at temperatures above [tpl]convert|2000|C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. In 1903, Verneuil announced he could produce synthetic rubies on a commercial scale using this flame fusion process.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_067|title = Bahadur: a Handbook of Precious Stones|year = 1943|accessdate = 2007-08-19[/tpl]
The Verneuil process allows the production of flawless single-crystal sapphires, rubies and other corundum gems of much larger size than normally found in nature. It is also possible to grow gem-quality synthetic corundum by flux-growth and hydrothermal synthesis. Because of the simplicity of the methods involved in corundum synthesis, large quantities of these crystals have become available on the market causing a significant reduction of price in recent years. Apart from ornamental uses, synthetic corundum is also used to produce mechanical parts (tubes, rods, bearings, and other machined parts), scratch-resistant optics, scratch-resistant watch crystals, instrument windows for satellites and spacecraft (because of its transparency in the ultraviolet to infrared range), and laser components.
