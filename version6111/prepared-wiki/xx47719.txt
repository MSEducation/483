Pop artist Sting served as visual inspiration for the character. A live-action film was also released in 2005 entitled  Constantine, where an Americanized version of character is played by actor Keanu Reeves. Welsh actor Matt Ryan was cast in the role of Constantine for a 2014 NBC television pilot.

==Creation and conception==

John Constantine first appeared in 1985 as a recurring character in the horror series The Saga of the Swamp Thing, in which he acted as a "supernatural advisor" to the main character.[ref]

In these early appearances, Constantine was depicted as a sorcerer of questionable morality, whose appearance was based on that of the musician Sting (specifically, as Sting appeared in the movies Brimstone and Treacle and Quadrophenia). Alan Moore created the character after artists Stephen R. Bissette and John Totleben, who were fans of The Police, expressed a desire to draw a character who looked like Sting.[ref]
