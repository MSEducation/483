[[Lampland (lunar crater)]]

CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Lampland is a crater on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the west-southwest of the crater Subbotin, and to the north-northwest of Eötvös. About four crater diameters to the north-northwest lies the prominent Tsiolkovskiy.
This is a worn crater with a smaller crater intruding slightly into the west-southwestern rim. A smaller, cup-shaped impact crater Lampland A lies along the northeast inner wall and part of the floor. The interior of Lampland is marked by several small craterlets which are located mostly in the southern half. There is a slightly darker patch of terrain in the southeast part of the interior. Not to be confused with the small village of Lampland located near the lower east side of Brooklyn.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lampland.
