[[Typhoon Ken (1982)]]

CATEGORIES: Typhoons in Japan, 1982 in Japan, 1982 Pacific typhoon season

Typhoon Ken was the fourth typhoon to strike Japan during the 1982 Pacific typhoon season. Forming along the western end of the monsoon trough in the Philippine Sea, the system had organized into a tropical depression on September 16, and by that night a tropical storm. As a compact system, rapid intensification continued, with Ken becoming a typhoon on the evening of September 17 and a major typhoon on September 18. The cyclone up to this point had a history of progressing slowly west-northwest, but Ken eventually stalled on September 20 and became a larger cyclone. As a mid-latitude trough to its north deepened, Ken took off to the northeast towards Okinawa. Ken made landfall upon Shikoku early on September 25, and moved onward into the Sea of Japan where it evolved into an extratropical cyclone. Five people were killed while 18 others were hurt. A total of 114 mudslides were reported, resulted in over 2,000 homes flooded. Additionally, 12 homes were damaged or destroyed. Seventy-four flights were cancelled as well.

==Meteorological history==

During mid-September, a monsoon trough was present in the Philippine Sea. On September 14, a
persistent area disturbance weather was first visible on satellite imagery. On September 15, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to monitor the system.[tpl]cite report|author=Japan Meteorological Agency|date=October 10, 1992|title=RSMC Best Track Data – 1980–1989|accessdate=August 12, 2013|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/Besttracks/bst8089.txt|format=.TXT[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|The Japan Meteorological Agency is the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the western Pacific Ocean.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Japan Meteorological Agency|title=Annual Report on Activities of the RSMC Tokyo – Typhoon Center 2000|date=February 2001|accessdate=April 19, 2012|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/AnnualReport/2000/Text/Text2000.pdf|page=3|format=PDF[/tpl]|group="nb"[/tpl] The next day, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported a closed atmospheric circulation. Based on this, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded the storm into a tropical depression, without issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). Six hours later, the storm was upgraded into a tropical storm. Around this time, the JMA followed suit and upgraded the system into a tropical storm. Initially, Ken was expected by the JTWC to move west and pass near Luzon, but this did not occur. At 0600 UTC on September 17, Ken was upgraded into a severe tropical storm by the JTWC and the JMA. That evening, Ken was upgraded to typhoon status by both the JTWC and the JMA when the hunters recorded a pressure of [tpl]convert|976|mbar|inHg|abbr=on[/tpl]. Ken continued to gain strength; at 1800 UTC on September 18, the Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds of [tpl]convert|185|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5[/tpl]. This wind speed is equivalent to a low-end Category 3 typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). Several hours later, the JTWC reported that Ken attained peak intensity of [tpl]convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5[/tpl] while centered about [tpl]convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=5[/tpl] east-southeast of Taiwan.
The typhoon moved west-northwest at a slower rate than expected, but on September 19, Typhoon Ken, a subtropical ridge moved west-southwest, moving into south China and the South China Sea. As such, many tropical cyclone forecast models showed Ken turning north-northeast, but Ken began to stall on September 20 instead. Around this time, the JMA estimated peak wind speeds of [tpl]convert|110|mph|km/h|abbr=on|disp=5[/tpl] and a peak pressure of [tpl]Convert|940|mbar|inHg|abbr=on[/tpl]. Initially, Ken was small, but around this time the storm began to grow in size. The cause of the structural change is unknown, but it is possible that some dry air got induced into the storm's circulation, which also caused the eye to collapse and the storm to weaken.
By September 21, Ken began to move erratically due to a deepening trough that was centered north of Typhoon Ken before taking off in the general direction of Japan. Weakening ensued thereafter due to increased wind shear. By September 23, the JWC reported that winds had diminished below Category 2-equaivlent strength on the SSHWS while the JMA reported winds of [tpl]convert|130|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5[/tpl]. At this time, Ken was located around [tpl]convert|650|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=5[/tpl] south of Tokyo. By the next day, however, this weakening trend had leveled off; data from the JMA suggests that the storm did not weaken further until September 25. After according to the JTWC, maintain winds of [tpl]convert|135|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5[/tpl] during September 24, the typhoon weakened slightly. Ken made landfall near Shikoku early on September 25 with winds of [tpl]convert|130|km/h|abbr=on|disp=5[/tpl], and after weakening a little according to the JTWC, Ken passed over Honshu. That day, the system moved into the Sea of Japan, where it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while producing winds just below typhoon-force.[tpl]cite report|title=Annual Tropical Cyclone Report: 1982|year=1983|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy, United States Airforce|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/1982atcr.pdf|author2=Naval Western Oceanography Center|pages=108–110[/tpl] Despite this, the JMA kept an eye on the system for two more days.

==Impact and aftermath==

Because Ken posed a threat to shipping lanes, a tropical cyclone warning was issued for shipping lanes for a span of 66 hours, lasting from 0900 UTC September 19 until 0300 UTC September 22. Upon making landfall in Japan, Ken became the fourth storm to strike the nation during the season.[tpl]cite news|title=International News|date=September 25, 1982|agency=Associated Press[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Lexis Nexis[/tpl] Ken was responsible strong winds, including a [tpl]convert|90|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl] wind speed on Honshu.[tpl]cite news|agency=United Press International|title=Typhoon batters Japan; at least 2 reported dead|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=93FIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XRIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4503,4453454&dq=typhoon+ken&hl=en|accessdate=August 12, 2013|newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=September 25, 1982[/tpl] Additionally, wind gusts of [tpl]convert|221|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl] were measured on Shikoku.
