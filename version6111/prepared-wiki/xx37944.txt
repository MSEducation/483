The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO) is a British orchestra based in Birmingham, England.  The Orchestra's current chief executive, appointed in 1999, is Stephen Maddock.  Since 2008, the CBSO's music director is Andris Nelsons.

==History==

Founded by Neville Chamberlain, the orchestra first rehearsed at 9.30am on 4 September 1920, in the band room at the Birmingham City Police's Steelhouse Lane station.[tpl]cite news|title=A glorious 90 years|last=Morley|first=Christopher|date=4 November 2010|publisher=The Birmingham Post|page=4|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl] The first public performance, as the City of Birmingham Orchestra occurred later that month, with Appleby Matthews, the orchestra's first chief conductor, at the baton. The programme included Overture: Saul by Granville Bantock, a strong supporter of the orchestra's foundation. However, its official foundation is generally reckoned to have been the "First Symphony Concert" in November 1920, when Edward Elgar conducted a programme of his own music in Birmingham Town Hall.
Adrian Boult was chief conductor from 1924 to 1930.  The CBO became a full-time organisation in 1944, changing its name to the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 1948.  Chief conductors since then included Rudolf Schwarz, the composer Andrzej Panufnik, Boult in an emergency return for a season after Panufnik's sudden resignation, Hugo Rignold and Louis Frémaux. During this time, the orchestra made recordings and gave regular concerts.
The CBSO began to gain greater international renown after Simon Rattle became chief conductor in 1980. Under him, the orchestra increased its recording profile and became one of the leading ensembles in Europe, and gained a name for its interpretations of late romantic and 20th century works, especially those of Sibelius and Gustav Mahler. During this period, the orchestra moved from Birmingham Town Hall to a new home venue, Symphony Hall, inside Birmingham's International Convention Centre. The nearby CBSO Centre, a converted factory, houses management offices, rehearsal facilities, and is a concert venue in its own right, for more intimate performances.  The CBSO Youth Orchestra has been affiliated with the CBSO since 2004.[tpl]cite news | author=Christopher Morley | title=CBSO's future in safe hands | url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/whats-on/music/cbsos-future-in-safe-hands-3966434 | work=Birmingham Post | date=2007-11-29 | accessdate=23 January 2009[/tpl]
Rattle was named music director of the CBSO in 1990.  That same year, the post of Radcliffe Composer in Association was created, with Mark-Anthony Turnage filling the role. In 1995 Judith Weir became Fairbairn Composer in Association, followed in 2001 by Julian Anderson.
After Rattle relinquished his posts with the CBSO, the Finnish conductor Sakari Oramo became chief conductor in 1998, and music director in 1999.  His CBSO work has included the Floof! festival of contemporary music.[tpl]cite news | author=Tom Service | title=Floof! | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,967590,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=31 May 2003 | accessdate=18 August 2007[/tpl]  He has also championed the music of John Foulds in concerts and recordings.[tpl]cite news | author=Peter Culshaw | title=Visionary genius of the spirit world | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/04/26/bafoulds26.xml | work=The Telegraph | date=2006-04-26 | accessdate=18 August 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news | author=Sakari Oramo | title=The forgotten man | url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/apr/28/classicalmusicandopera1 | work=The Guardian | date=28 April 2006 | accessdate=1 September 2007[/tpl]  In 2008, Oramo stood down as music director and took the title of principal guest conductor for the 2008-2009 season.Martin Cullingford, "Oramo to step down as CBSO music director".
