[[Twice Removed]]

CATEGORIES: 1994 albums, Sloan albums, Geffen Records albums

Twice Removed is the second album by Canadian rock band Sloan.  It was released on Geffen Records in 1994, and is considered to be one of their best albums.  It was more melodic and catchy than their previous album, Smeared, and as a result Geffen did not promote it very well because it didn't fit the commercially dominant grunge rock style of the time. The band was dropped from Geffen after Twice Removed was released.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.blogto.com/music/2012/11/sloans_jay_ferguson_talks_re-issue_of_twice_removed/|title=Sloan's Jay Ferguson talks re-issue of Twice Removed|last=Kamin|first=Adam|date=22 November 2012|work=blogTO|publisher=Fresh Daily|accessdate=5 January 2013[/tpl]  The band took time off from touring and writing after the troubles with Geffen, and they were rumoured to have broken up. The album was certified Gold in Canada on October 20, 1998.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musiccanada.com/GPSearchResult.aspx?st=Twice%20Removed&ica=False&sa=Sloan&sl=&smt=0&sat=-1&ssb=Artist|title=Gold Platinum Database: Sloan - Twice Removed|publisher=Canadian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=September 5, 2012[/tpl]
Lyrics for the first track on the album, "Penpals", are taken from broken English fan letters to Kurt Cobain, which the band rummaged through when they were signed to Geffen in the early â€™90s.[ref]
