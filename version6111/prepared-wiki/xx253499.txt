The White-crowned Shama (Copsychus stricklandii) is a bird in the Old World flycatcher family. It is endemic to the Southeast Asian island of Borneo.[tpl]cite book |title=Phillipps’ Field Guide to the Birds of Borneo |authors=Phillipps, Quentin; & Phillipps, Karen |year=2011 |series= |publisher=John Beaufoy Publishing |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-1-906780-56-2 |pages= |url= [/tpl]

==Taxonomy==

It is closely related to the White-rumped Shama (Copsychus malabaricus) of which it is sometimes considered a subspecies.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=32266 |title=White-rumped Shama |accessdate=2013-11-15 |work=Species factsheet |first= |last= |publisher=BirdLife International |year=2013 [/tpl] In turn, the White-crowned Shama has been credited with two subspecies:[tpl]cite web |url= |title= IOC World Bird List (v 3.5). |accessdate=2013-11-15 |work= |authors= Gill, F & D Donsker (Eds). |publisher= IOC|year=2013 |doi= 10.14344/IOC.ML.3.5[/tpl]

==Description==

The White-crowned Shama is about 21–28 cm in length (including a 7 cm tail in adult males) and 31–42 g in weight. Mainly blue-black upperparts contrast with orange-rufous underparts. It has a white rump and black throat. It is largely similar in appearance to the White-rumped Shama subspecies C. m. suavis, which replaces it in southern and western Borneo, and hybridises with it where the ranges meet.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hbw.com/species/white-rumped-shama-copsychus-malabaricus |title=White-rumped Shama |accessdate=2013-11-15 |work= HBW Alive|authors= |publisher=Lynx Editions |date=|doi= [/tpl] It differs in having a white, rather than black, crown. The distinctive Maratua form C. s. barbouri is about 20% longer than the nominate, and has an all-black tail, rather than white outer rectrices.

==Aviculture==

White-crowned Shamas are bred by local aviculturists in Borneo as cage-birds valued for their singing ability. They continue to be trapped as it is believed that wild-caught young birds are stronger, and better songsters, than those bred in captivity.
