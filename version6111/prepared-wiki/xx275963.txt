==Biography==

Sasson was born in 1965 in the small, ultra-orthodox Israeli city of Bnei-Brak. Raised in a large, close-knit family and community, she attended Orthodox schools and was expected to concentrate only on religious studies. But the desire to express herself through drawing and painting profoundly affected her, and she attempted to honor both worlds while hiding her talent from those in her family and community. 
A serious car accident at age 22 forced Sasson to rehabilitate herself through painting. By the age of 35, in addition to working on paintings, Mira added narration to a series of sketches and discovered her love and talent for storytelling. She began authoring children’s books and wrote a weekly article for a community newspaper. Her books are published and distributed in Israel and are being translated to English for release in North America.[tpl]cite web|author=PRWeb – Thu, Sep 1, 2011 |url=http://news.yahoo.com/mira-sasson-teams-pioneers-cure-songs-fight-cancer-020227069.html |title=Yahoo!

==Pioneers for a Cure==

Mira Sasson is currently working on a series of portraits of singers who have contributed songs to Pioneers For A Cure - Songs To Fight Cancer. These portraits include Suzanne Vega, Ben E. King, Tovah Feldshuh, Lorin Sklamberg, David Broza, Taylor Barton, Yossi Piamenta, Basya Schechter, Neshama Carlebach, Noah Solomon and Dudu Fisher.
In addition, Sasson contributed the cover artwork for the September 2011 release on iTunes of the 'Israeli Songs To Fight Cancer' compilation released by Pioneers For A Cure. The collection features songs by Dov Rosenblatt, Josh Nelson, Dudu Fisher, Y-Love and others.
Pioneers For A Cure is the largest showcase of cancer charities on the web. Called 'A stellar model of artist-driven grassroots philanthropy' by National Geographic, the non-profit project records public domain songs, reinterpreted and made available for donations of as little as $1.99. This treasure trove of over 100 songs has been recorded by dozens of artists from around the world including Suzanne Vega, Ben E. King, Tom Chapin, Tom Verlaine, Matt White and David Broza. Proceeds from song downloads are donated to artist-selected cancer charities such as the American Cancer Society, St. Jude Children's Hospital, the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and Susan G. Komen for the Cure.
