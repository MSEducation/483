Brighton is a town in Northumberland County, Ontario, Canada, approximately [tpl]convert|150|km|mi|0[/tpl] east of Toronto and [tpl]convert|100|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] west of Kingston. It is traversed by both Highway 401 and the former Highway 2.  The west end of the Murray Canal that leads east to the Bay of Quinte is at the east end of the town.
Brighton was primarily an agricultural community, specializing in the farming of apples and production of new apple types. However, in recent years, many of the original orchards in the area have been partially removed, to make way for the steadily growing population, and more profitable agricultural produce, such as: wheat, corn and soybeans. In late September, Brighton is host to Applefest, its largest yearly festival.
The Municipality of Brighton (formed on January 1, 2001, through an amalgamation of the former Town of Brighton and Brighton Township) is home to nearly 11,000 inhabitants, with a higher than average percentage of those retired. This is common, as the quiet, clean and friendly atmosphere of many smaller towns near lake Ontario tend to draw the elderly as popular places for retirement living. Many small hamlets surround the town, including Codrington, Carman, Hilton, Spring Valley and Smithfield.
Presqu'ile Provincial Park, just south of the town centre, is one of Brighton's most popular attractions. The park is noted for birdwatching and other nature-oriented activities.

==Founding==

The original Simpson house, is located on 61 Simpson Street, over 150 years old.

==The artificial island area of Brighton==

Part of the current Municipality of Brighton is on a separate artificial island.  This is a consequence of the borders chosen when the Township of Brighton was created in 1851, and the excavation of the Murray Canal across the historic Isthmus of Murray.  The Murray Canal opened in 1889.
