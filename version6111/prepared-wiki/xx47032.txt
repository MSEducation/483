Sorani ([tpl]lang|ckb|کوردیی ناوەندی، سۆرانی[/tpl]), also called Central Kurdish, is a Kurdish language spoken in Iran and Iraq.

==Name==

To refer to southern Kurmanji dialects as Soranî is a recent naming by linguists after the name of the former principality of Soran. D.N. Mackenzie writes that the present Kurdish standard called Sorani is in fact an idealized version of the Silêmanî dialect, which uses the phonemic system of the Píjhdar and Mukrî dialects.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] Objections have been made to the name Sorani on the grounds that the name of one dialect, Sorani, spoken in the region Soran should not be extended to cover a group of dialects.

==History==

===Ottoman era===

In Silemani (Sulaymaniyah), the Ottoman Empire had created a secondary school (Rushdíye), the graduates from which could go to Istanbul to continue to study there. This allowed Sorani, which was spoken in Silémaní, to progressively replace Hewrami (Gorani) as the literary vehicle.

===Modern===

Since the fall of the Ba'athist regime in Iraq, there have been more opportunities to publish works in the Kurdish language in Iraq than in any other country in recent times.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cal.org/co/kurds/klang.html |title=Iraqi Kurds |publisher=Cal.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15[/tpl]
As a result, Sorani Kurdish has become the dominant written form of Kurdish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://languages.refugeecouncil.org.uk/top_navigation/Language_profiles.htm |title=Language background of major refugee groups to the UK - Refugee Council |publisher=Languages.refugeecouncil.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15[/tpl]

==Alphabet==

Sorani Kurdish is written with a modified Perso-Arabic script; This is in contrast to the other main Kurdish dialect, Kurmanji which is spoken mainly in Turkey and is usually written in the Latin alphabet.
However, during the past decade, official TV in Iraqi Kurdistan has mainly used the Latin script for Sorani.

==Demographics==

The exact number of Sorani speakers is difficult to determine, but it is generally thought that Sorani is spoken by about 6 million people in Iraq and Iran.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.knn.u-net.com/kurd4.htm |title=Kurdistan Democratic Party-Iraq |publisher=Knn.u-net.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15[/tpl] It is the most widespread speech of Kurds in Iran and Iraq.

==As an official language==

A recent proposal was made for Sorani to be the official language of the Kurdistan Regional Government. This idea has been favoured by some Sorani-speaking Kurds but it has disappointed Kurmanjis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kurdishacademy.org/?q=node/194 |title=Kurdish language issue and a divisive approach | Kurdish Academy of Language |publisher=Kurdishacademy.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15[/tpl]
