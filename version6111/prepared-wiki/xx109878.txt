==History==

In 1874, Treaty 4 was established between Queen Victoria and the Cree and Saulteaux First Nations. On September 15 of the same year, Kaneonuskatew (or, in his English name of George Gordon) was among the first of the Indigenous leaders to make the agreement, signing as Chief of the George Gordon First Nation."George Gordon First Nation", The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan By 1884, half of the families belonging to the nation were farming, a development which had commenced in 1876, and would continue for many years. Although both George Gordon and his son, Moses Gordon, were originally hereditary chiefs, the people have since adopted the practice of democratically voting their chiefs and councillors into office."Gordon First Nation" website.
From 1889 to 1996, George Gordon First Nation was the location of the longest-running residential school in Canada.  Attendance there devastated many members of the nation-state as children because of various forms of abuse."Saskatchewan First Nation eyes wind power business to help future generations", Winnipeg Free Press The schools have been proven to have allowed abuse of the children.
