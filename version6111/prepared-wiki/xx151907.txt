[tpl]nihongo|Daiginjō|大吟醸[/tpl] is the compilation album by Japanese singer-songwriter Miyuki Nakajima, released in March 1996. The album features her most commercially successful singles "Between the Sky and You (Sora to Kimi no Aida ni)", "Shallow Sleep (Asai Nemuri)", "Wanderer's Song (Tabibito no Uta)", and "Bad Girl (Akujo)", and mainly consists of her singles that came out during the 1990s. It also includes well-recognized songs like "Rouge" (became famous by cover version Faye Wong recorded),  although her earlier massive hit singles such as "Yūwaku" and "Unrequited Love (Yokorenbo)" were disregarded. 
Daiginjō debuted at the number-one on the Japanese Oricon Weekly albums chart with sales of 210,000 copies, defeating The Beatles' blockbuster Anthology 2 released in the same week.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musictvprogram.com/corner-ranking-1996-4-1.html 1996年4月1日付 CDシングル/アルバムランキング|title= Overview of the magazine Oricon Weekly|language=Japanese|publisher=Oricon|accessdate=2009-06-06[/tpl]
