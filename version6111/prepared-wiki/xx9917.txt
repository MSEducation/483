Paul Leroy Robeson ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|r|oʊ|b|s|ən[/tpl] [tpl]respell|ROHB|sən[/tpl] April 9, 1898 – January 23, 1976) was an African-American singer and actor who became involved with the Civil Rights Movement. At Rutgers University, he was an outstanding football player, then had an international career in singing, as well as acting in theater and movies. He became politically involved in response to the Spanish Civil War, fascism, and social injustices. His advocacy of anti-imperialism, affiliation with communism, and criticism of the United States government caused him to be blacklisted during the McCarthy era. Ill health forced him into retirement from his career. He remained until his death an advocate of the political stances he took.
Robeson won an academic scholarship to Rutgers University, where he became a football All-American and the class valedictorian. He received his LL.B. from Columbia Law School, while playing in the National Football League (NFL). At Columbia, he sang and acted in off-campus productions; and, after graduating, he became a participant in the Harlem Renaissance with performances in The Emperor Jones and All God's Chillun Got Wings. Robeson initiated his international artistic résumé with a theatrical role in Great Britain, settling in London for the next several years with his wife Essie.
Robeson next appeared as Othello at the Savoy Theatre before becoming an international cinematic star through roles in Show Boat and Sanders of the River. He became increasingly attuned towards the sufferings of other cultures and peoples. Acting against advice, which warned of his economic ruin if he became politically active, he set aside his theatrical career to advocate the cause of the Republican forces of the Spanish Civil War. He then became active in the Council on African Affairs (CAA).
During World War II, he supported America's war efforts and won accolades for his portrayal of Othello on Broadway. However, his history of supporting pro-Soviet policies brought scrutiny from the FBI. After the war ended, the CAA was placed on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations and Robeson was investigated during the age of McCarthyism. Due to his decision not to recant his public advocacy of pro-Soviet policies, he was denied a passport by the U.S. State Department, and his income, consequently, plummeted. He moved to Harlem and published a periodical critical of United States policies. His right to travel was eventually restored by Kent v. Dulles, but his health broke down. He retired and he lived out the remaining years of his life privately in Philadelphia.

===Childhood (1898–1915)===

Paul Robeson was born in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1898, to Reverend William Drew Robeson and Maria Louisa Bustill.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Robeson | first1 = Paul Jr. | title = The Undiscovered Paul Robeson, An Artist's Journey, 1898–1939 | chapter = Motherless Child (1898–1919) | publisher = Wiley | year = 2001 | location = New York | page = 3 | url = http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/59/04712426/0471242659.pdf | isbn = 0-471-24265-9[/tpl]; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 18, Duberman: 4–5. His mother was from a prominent Quaker family of mixed ancestry: African, Anglo-American, and Lenape.Brown: 5–6, 145–149; cf. Robeson, 2001: 4–5; Boyle and Bunie: 10–12. His father, William, whose family traced their ancestry to the Igbo people of present-day Nigeria, escaped from a plantation in his teensRobeson 2001: 4, 337–338; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 4, Duberman: 4, Brown: 9–10. and eventually became the minister of Princeton's Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church in 1881.Boyle and Bunie: 5–6, 14; cf. Robeson 2001: 4–5, Duberman: 4–6, Brown: 17, 26. Robeson had three brothers: William Drew, Jr. (born 1881), Reeve (born c. 1887), and Ben (born c. 1893); and one sister, Marian (born c. 1895).Robeson 2001: 3; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 18, Brown: 21.
In 1900, a disagreement between William and white financial supporters of Witherspoon arose with apparent racial undertones,Duberman: 6–7; cf. Robeson, 2001: 5–6, Boyle and Bunie: 18–20. which were prevalent in Princeton.Boyle and Bunie: 16–17; cf. Duberman: 12. William, who had the support of his entirely black congregation, resigned in 1901.Robeson 2001: 5–6; cf. Duberman: 6–9, Boyle and Bunie: 18–20, Brown: 26. The loss of his position forced him to work menial jobs.Duberman: 9; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 21, Robeson 2001: 6–7, Brown: 28. Three years later when Robeson was six, his mother, who was nearly blind, died in a house fire.Boyle and Bunie: 22–23; cf. Duberman: 8, Robeson 2001: 7–8, Brown: 25–29; Robeson 1958: 7. Eventually, William became financially incapable of providing a house for himself and his children still living at home, Ben and Paul, so they moved into the attic of a store in Westfield, New Jersey.Robeson 2001: 11; cf. Duberman: 9, Boyle and Bunie: 27–29.
William found a stable parsonage at the St. Thomas A. M. E. Zion in 1910,Duberman: 9–10; cf. Brown: 39, Robeson 2001: 13–14. where Robeson would fill in for his father during sermons when he was called away.Robeson 2001: 17; cf. Duberman: 30, Brown: 46–47. In 1912, Robeson attended Somerville High School, Somerville, New Jersey,Boyle and Bunie: 37–38; cf. Duberman: 12, Brown: 49–51. where he performed in Julius Caesar, Othello, sang in the chorus, and excelled in football, basketball, baseball and track.Duberman: 13–16; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 34–36, Brown: 43, 46, 48–49. His athletic dominance elicited racial taunts which he ignored.Boyle and Bunie: 37–38; cf. Robeson: 16, Duberman: 13–16, Brown: 46–47. Prior to his graduation, he won a statewide academic contest for a scholarship to Rutgers.Boyle and Bunie: 41–42; cf. Brown: 54–55, Duberman: 17, Robeson 2001: 17–18; contra.

He tried out for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team,Boyle and Bunie: 45–49; cf. Duberman: 19, 24, Brown: 60, 65. and his resolve to make the squad was tested as his teammates engaged in unwarranted and excessive play, arguably precipitated by racism.Duberman: 20–21; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 49–50, Brown: 61–63. The coach, Foster Sanford, decided he had overcome the provocation and announced that he had made the team.[tpl]cite news | first = Robert | last = Van Gelder | title = Robeson Remembers: An interview with the Star of Othello, Partly about his Past | date = 1944-01-16 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/107050287 | work = New York Times | pages = X1[/tpl]; cf.

In 1951, an article titled "Paul Robeson – the Lost Shepherd" was published in The CrisisRobert Alan, "Paul Robeson - the Lost Shepherd". The Crisis, November 1951 pp. 569–573. although Paul Jr. suspected it was authored by Amsterdam News columnist Earl Brown.Duberman 1988: 396. J. Edgar Hoover and the United States State Department arranged for the article to be printed and distributed in AfricaFoner, Henry 2001 ?: 112–115 ? in order to defame Robeson's reputation and reduce his and Communists' popularity in colonial countries.Von Eschen: 127. Another article by Wilkins denounced Robeson as well as the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) in terms consistent with the anti-Communist FBI propaganda.Duberman: 396; cf. Foner, Henry 2001?: 112–115.
On December 17, 1951, Robeson presented to the United Nations an anti-lynching petition, "We Charge Genocide".Duberman: 397–398. The document asserted that the United States federal government, by its failure to act against lynching in the United States, was "guilty of genocide" under Article II of the UN Genocide Convention.
In 1952, Robeson was awarded the International Stalin Prize by the Soviet Union.[tpl]cite news | title = Paul Robeson is Awarded Stalin Prize | date = 1952-12-22 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z2NjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=F0YNAAAAIBAJ&dq=stalin%20peace%20prize%20robeson&pg=4377%2C6224357 | work = The News and Courier | page = 6 [/tpl] Unable to travel to Moscow, he accepted the award in New York.[tpl]cite news | title = Post Robeson Gets Stalin Peace Prize | date = 1953-09-25 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5FtTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Q4UDAAAAIBAJ&dq=stalin%20peace%20prize%20robeson&pg=7155%2C6420665 | work = The Victoria Advocate | page = 5 [/tpl] In April 1953, shortly after Stalin's death, Robeson penned To You My Beloved Comrade, praising Stalin as dedicated to peace and a guide to the world: "Through his deep humanity, by his wise understanding, he leaves us a rich and monumental heritage."Foner 1978: 347–349. Robeson's opinion on the Soviet Union kept his passport out of reach and stopped his return to the entertainment industry and the civil rights movement.Duberman: 354. In his opinion, the Soviet Union was the guarantor of political balance in the world.Foner 1978: 236–241.
In a symbolic act of defiance against the travel ban, labor unions in the United States and Canada organized a concert at the International Peace Arch on the border between Washington state and the Canadian province of British Columbia.Duberman, p. 400. Robeson returned to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953,Duberman p. 411. and over the next two years, two further concerts were scheduled. In this period, with the encouragement of his friend the Welsh politician Aneurin Bevan, Robeson recorded a number of radio concerts for supporters in Wales.

===End of McCarthyism (1956–1957)===

In 1956, Robeson was called before HUAC after he refused to sign an affidavit affirming that he was not a Communist.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] In his testimony, he invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to reveal his political affiliations.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] When he was asked why he had not remained in the Soviet Union because of his affinity with its political ideology, he replied that "because my father was a slave and my people died to build , I am going to stay here, and have a part of it just like you and no fascist-minded people will drive me from it!"[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012|reason=easy, easy to find[/tpl] Robeson's passport was subsequently revoked.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] Campaigns were launched to protest the passport ban and the restriction of his right to travel over the next four years,[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] but it was to no avail.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/explorefurther/images/robeson/ | title = Showcase: Let Robeson Sing | last = Howard | first = Tony | date = 2009-01-29 | publisher = University of Warwick[/tpl]
Nikita Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalinism at the 1956 Party Congress silenced Robeson on Stalin, though Robeson continued to praise the Soviet Union.Duberman 1988: 437. In 1956, after public pressure brought a one-time exemption to the travel ban, Robeson performed concerts in Canada in March.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] That year Robeson, along with close friend W. E. B. Du Bois, compared the anti-Stalinist revolution in Hungary to the "same sort of people who overthrew the Spanish Republican Government" and supported the Soviet invasion and suppression of the revolt.Barry Finger, "Paul Robeson: A Flawed Martyr", in: New Politics Vol. 7 No. 1 (Summer 1998)
An appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States to reinstate his confiscated passport had been rejected, but over the telephone Robeson was able to sing to the 5,000 gathered there as he had earlier in the year to London. Due to the reaction to the promulgation of Robeson's political views,[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] his recordings and films were removed from public distribution,[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] and he was universally condemned in the U.S press.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] During the height of the Cold War, it became increasingly difficult in the United States to hear Robeson sing on commercial radio, buy his music or see his films.Robeson 1978: 3–8.

==Later years (1958–1976)==

===Comeback tours (1958–1960)===

After[tpl]citation needed|reason=Duberman says early 1958, Kent Dulles was June 1958, source is unclear|date=December 2012[/tpl] the publication of Robeson's "manifesto-autobiography", Here I Stand,Duberman: 458. his passport was restored in June 1958 via Kent v.

Robeson and Essie then flew to Yalta to rest and spend time with Nikita Khrushchev.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
On October 11, 1959, Robeson took part in a service at St. Paul's Cathedral, the first black performer to sing there.Duberman: 471. On a trip to Moscow, Robeson experienced bouts of dizziness and heart problems and was hospitalized for two months while Essie was diagnosed with operable cancer.Robeson 1981: 218. He recovered and returned to the UK to visit the National Eisteddfod.
Meanwhile the State Department had circulated negative literature about him throughout the media in IndiaDuberman: 472.
During his run at the Royal Shakespeare Company playing Othello in Tony Richardson's 1959 production at Stratford-upon-Avon, he befriended actor Andrew Faulds, whose family hosted him in the nearby village of Shottery. In 1960, in what would prove to be his final concert performance in Great Britain, Robeson sang to raise money for the Movement for Colonial Freedom at the Royal Festival Hall.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
In October 1960, Robeson embarked on a two-month concert tour of Australia and New Zealand with Essie, primarily to generate money,Duberman: 487–491. at the behest of Australian politician Bill Morrow.Curthoys: 171. While in Sydney, he became the first major artist to perform at the construction site of the future Sydney Opera House.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/intothemusic/paul-robeson/4691690 | title = Paul Robeson: the singer who fought for justice and paid with his life | last = Steinke | first = Nicole[/tpl] After appearing at the Brisbane Festival Hall, they went to Auckland where Robeson reaffirmed his support of Marxism,Duberman: 489. denounced the inequality faced by the Māori and efforts to denigrate their culture.Curthoys: 168 ; cf. Duberman: 489. Thereabouts, Robeson publicly stated "...the people of the lands of Socialism want peace dearly".Foner 1978: 470–471. 
He was introduced to Faith Bandler who enlightened the Robesons to the deprivation of the Australian Aborigines.Curthoys: 164, 173–175: cf. Duberman: 490. Robeson, consequently, became enraged and demanded the Australian government provide the Aborigines citizenship and equal rights.Curthoys: 175–177; cf. Duberman He attacked the view of the Aborigines as unsophisticated and uncultured,[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=this is 'common knowledge' so it should be easy to find a source for this and the adjective 'unsophisticated and uncultured' is a rough draft[/tpl] and declared, "there's no such thing as a backward human being, there is only a society which says they are backward."[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

===Health breakdown (1961–1963)===

Back in London, he planned his return to the United States to participate in the Civil Rights Movement, stopping off in Africa, China and Cuba along the way. Essie argued to stay in London, fearing that he'd be "killed" if he returned and would be "unable to make any money" due to harassment by the United States government. Robeson disagreed and made his own travel arrangements, stopping off in Moscow in March 1961.Robeson 2010: 309.
During an uncharacteristically wild party in his Moscow hotel room, he locked himself in his bedroom and attempted suicide by cutting his wrists. Three days later, under Soviet medical care, he told his son that he felt extreme paranoia, thought that the walls of the room were moving and, overcome by a powerful sense of emptiness and depression, tried to take his own life.Nollen: 180.
Paul Jr. believed that his father's health problems stemmed from attempts by CIA and MI5 to "neutralize" his father.Radio broadcast presented by Amy Goodman, Did the U.S. Government Drug Paul Robeson? (Part 1). Democracy Now (July 1, 1999) Did the U.S. Government Drug Paul Robeson? (Part 2). Democracy Now (July 6, 1999).Duberman: 563–564. He remembered that his father had had such fears prior to his prostate operation.Duberman: 438–442. He said that three doctors treating Robeson in London and New York had been CIA contractors, and that his father's symptoms resulted from being "subjected to mind depatterning under MKULTRA", a secret CIA programme.[tpl]cite journal | title = Time Out: The Paul Robeson Files | journal = The Nation | date = 1999-12-20 | first = Paul Jr. | last = Robeson | volume = 269 | issue = 21 | page = 9| id = | url = http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=0d55a2a6-c110-46db-bd79-fbb91511a635%40sessionmgr13&vid=1&hid=8[/tpl] Martin Duberman claimed that Robeson's health breakdown was probably brought on by a combination of factors including extreme emotional and physical stress, bipolar depression, exhaustion and the beginning of circulatory and heart problems. "Even without an organic predisposition and accumulated pressures of government harassment he might have been susceptible to a breakdown."Duberman: 498–499.
Robeson stayed at the Barvikha Sanatorium until September 1961, when he left for London. There his depression reemerged, and after another period of recuperation in Moscow, he returned to London. Three days after arriving back, he became suicidal and suffered a panic attack while passing the Soviet Embassy.Duberman: 735–736. He was admitted to The Priory hospital, where he underwent electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and was given heavy doses of drugs for nearly two years, with no accompanying psychotherapy.Nollen: 180–181.
During his treatment at the Priory, Robeson was being monitored by the British MI5.[tpl]cite news | first = Alan | last = Travis | title = Paul Robeson was tracked by MI5 | date = 2003-03-06 | publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/mar/07/uk.race | work = The Guardian [/tpl]; cf. Western Mail,  Both intelligence services were well aware of Robeson's suicidal state of mind. An FBI memo described Robeson's debilitated condition, remarking that his "death would be much publicized" and would be used for Communist propaganda, necessitating continued surveillance.Duberman: 509. Numerous memos advised that Robeson should be denied a passport renewal which would ostensibly jeopardize his fragile health and his recovery process.
In August 1963, disturbed about his treatment, friends had him transferred to the Buch Clinic in East Berlin.Nollen: 182. Given psychotherapy and less medication, his physicians found him still "completely without initiative" and they expressed "doubt and anger" about the "high level of barbiturates and ECT" that had been administered in London. He rapidly improved, though his doctor stressed that "what little is left of Paul's health must be quietly conserved."Duberman: 516–518.

===Retirement (1963–1976)===

In 1963, Robeson returned to the United States and for the remainder of his life lived in seclusion.Duberman: 537. He momentarily assumed a role in the civil rights movement,Amy Goodman, "Did the U.S. Government Drug Paul Robeson? (Part 2)". Democracy Now (July 6, 1999). making a few major public appearances before falling seriously ill during a tour. Double pneumonia and a kidney blockage in 1965 nearly killed him.
Robeson was contacted by both Bayard Rustin and James L. Farmer, Jr. about the possibility of becoming involved with the mainstream of the Civil Rights movement.Robeson, Jr. 2010: 346. Because of Rustin's past anti-Communist stances, Robeson declined to meet with him. Robeson eventually met with Farmer, but because he was asked to denounce Communism and the Soviet Union in order to assume a place in the mainstream, Robeson adamantly declined.Farmer: 297–298.
After Essie died in December 1965,Duberman: 162–163. Robeson moved in with his son's family in New York CityRobeson 1981: 235–237. and in 1968 he settled at his sister's home in Philadelphia.Bell: ? Numerous celebrations were held in honor of Robeson over the next several years, including at public arenas that had previously shunned him, but he saw few visitors aside from close friends and gave few statements apart from messages to support current civil rights and international movements, feeling that his record "spoke for itself".Duberman: 516. At a Carnegie Hall tribute to mark his 75th birthday in 1973, he was unable to attend, but a taped message from him was played that said: "Though I have not been able to be active for several years, I want you to know that I am the same Paul, dedicated as ever to the worldwide cause of humanity for freedom, peace and brotherhood."[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
