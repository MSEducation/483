PEN/Ackerley Prize (or, J. R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography) is awarded annually by English PEN for a literary autobiography of excellence, written by an author of British nationality and published during the preceding year. The winner receives £2,500.  In recent years, the winner has been announced at the annual English PEN summer party.
The award was established by Nancy West, née Ackerley, sister of English author and editor J. R. Ackerley.
The prize is judged by the trustees of the J. R. Ackerley Trust.  There is no formal submission process for the award - judges simply 'call in' books to be added to their longlist.
