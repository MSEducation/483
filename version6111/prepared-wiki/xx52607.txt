==History==

===Origins===

"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point." Claude Shannon (1916-2001)
The origins of communication theory is linked to the development of information theory in the early 1920s.[tpl]cite book |title=Management Effectiveness and Communication, MBA 665, Online Resources, Communication Models |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Bob Jones University |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.shkaminski.com/Classes/Handouts/Communication%20Models.htm |accessdate=11.05.2011[/tpl] Limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at Bell Labs, all implicitly assuming events of equal probability.
Harry Nyquist's 1924 paper, Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed, contains a theoretical section quantifying "intelligence" and the "line speed" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system.
Ralph Hartley's 1928 paper, Transmission of Information, uses the word information as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other. The natural unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, much later renamed the hartley in his honour as a unit or scale or measure of information.
Alan Turing in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war Enigma ciphers.
The main landmark event that opened the way to the development of communication theory was the publication of an article by Claude Shannon in the Bell System Technical Journal in July and October 1948 under the title 'A Mathematical Theory of Communication.' Shannon focused on the problem of how best to encode the information that a sender wants to transmit. He used also tools in probability theory, developed by Norbert Wiener. They marked the nascent stages of applied communication theory at that time. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of information theory.
In 1949, in a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of cryptography ('Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems'), he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad. He is also credited with the introduction of sampling theory, which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later.
In 1951, Shannon made his fundamental contribution to natural language processing and computational linguistics with his article 'Prediction and Entropy of Printed English' (1951), providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.

===Models of communication===

The studies on information theory by Claude Elwood Shannon, Warren Weaver and others, prompted research on new models of communication from other scientific perspectives like psychology and sociology. In science, a model is a structure that represents a theory.[tpl]cite book |title=Models in Science |last=Frigg, Roman and Hartmann, Stephan |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/#ModThe |accessdate=11.06.2011[/tpl]
Scholars from disciplines different from mathematics and engineering began to take distance from the Shannon and Weaver models as a 'transmissible model':
[tpl]Quotation|They developed a model of communication which was intended to assist in developing a mathematical theory of communication. Shannon and Weaver's work proved valuable for communication engineers in dealing with such issues as the capacity of various communication channels in 'bits per second'. It contributed to computer science. It led to very useful work on redundancy in language. And in making 'information' 'measurable' it gave birth to the mathematical study of 'information theory'|D. Chandler|[tpl]cite book |title=The Transmission Model of Communication |last=Chandler |first=Daniel |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher=University of Western Australia |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/trans.html |accessdate=11.06.2011[/tpl][/tpl]
Harold Lasswell (1902–1978), a political scientist and communication theorist, was a member of the Chicago school of sociology. In his work 'The Structure and Function of Communication in Society' (1948), he defined the communication process as Who (says) What (to) Whom (in) What Channel (with) What Effect. The distinct model he propounded was known as Dance Model.[tpl]cite book |title=The Structure and Function of Communication in Society |last=Laswell |first=Harold Dwight |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1948 |publisher=Lyman Bryson (New York: Institute for Religious and Social Studies, Jewish Theological Seminary of America |location= |isbn= |page=37 |pages= |url= |accessdate=[/tpl]
These first studies on communication's models promoted more researches on the topic. Wilbur Lang Schramm (1907–1987), called by communication theorist Everett Rogers as the founder of communication study,[tpl]cite book |title=Wilbur Lang Schramm (1907-1987), Forefather in the field of communication |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=University of Rhode Island  |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.uri.edu/personal/carson/kulveted/schrammbio.html |accessdate=2011-11-15[/tpl] focused his studies on the experience of the sender and receiver (listener). Communication is possible only upon a common language between sender and receiver.[tpl]cite book |title=A History of the University of Iowa School of Journalism, from its founding in 1924 under C.H. Weller, through the Tenure of Wilbur Schramm as Director, June 1947 |last=Oukrop |first=Carol Christensen |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1965 |publisher=University of Iowa  |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=2011-11-15[/tpl]
Everett Roger's accounts later led to the basis for development communication studies.
In 1960, David Kenneth Berlo, a disciple of Schramm, expanded on Shannon and Weaver’s linear model of communication and created the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver Model of communication (SMCR Model) exposed in his work The Process of Communication, where communication appears as a regulated process that allows the subject to negotiate with his living environment. Communication becomes, then, a value of power and influence (psychology of communication.)[tpl]cite book |title=The process of communication |last=Berlo |first=David Kenneth |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1960 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, & Winston, New York |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=2011-11-15[/tpl]
In 1963, Richard Whately's (1787-1863) 'Elements of Rhetoric' was republished[tpl]cite book |title=Elements of Rhetoric: Comprising an Analysis of the Laws of Moral Evidence |last=Richard Whately, Douglas Ehninger and David Potter |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1963 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8093-2974-8 |page= |pages= |url=http://books.google.com.kh/books?id=bYbgnLDdOkQC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=Ehninger,+Aristotles&source=bl&ots=bkxHTlw9DZ&sig=YdmF1zKKM74WOgoI_0jvYq6kUpo&hl=en&ei=Hku3TsybFoGviQf7of2bAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=11.07.2011[/tpl] with a critical introduction by Douglas Ehninger and a foreword by David Potter.
