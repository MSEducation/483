Clopenthixol (Sordinol), also known as clopentixol, is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene class. It was introduced by Lundbeck in 1961.[tpl]cite book | author = Sneader, Walter | title = Drug discovery: a history | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2005 | page = 410 | isbn = 0-471-89980-1 | oclc = | doi = | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Cb6BOkj9fK4C&lpg=PA410&pg=PA410#v=onepage[/tpl]
Clopenthixol is a racemic mixture of cis and trans isomers. Zuclopenthixol, the pure cis isomer, was later introduced by Lundbeck in 1962,[tpl]cite book | author = José Miguel Vela; Helmut Buschmann; Jörg Holenz; Antonio Párraga; Antoni Torrens | title = Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics: From Chemistry and Pharmacology to Clinical Application | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | year = 2007 | page = 516 | isbn = 3-527-31058-4 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = | url = http://books.google.com/?id=yXD4QA-Y_Z0C&lpg=PA520&dq=thioxanthene%201965%20pfizer&pg=PA516#v=onepage&q=[/tpl] and has been much more widely used. Both drugs are equally effective as antipsychotics and have similar adverse effect profiles, but clopenthixol is half as active on a milligram-to-milligram basis and appears to produce more sedation in comparison.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gravem A, Engstrand E, Guleng RJ |title=Cis(Z)-clopenthixol and clopenthixol (Sordinol) in chronic psychotic patients.
