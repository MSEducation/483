Thus Bernoulli's formula can and has to be written:
If B1 stands for the value Bernoulli himself has given to the coefficient at that position.

==Generalized Bernoulli numbers==

The generalized Bernoulli numbers are certain algebraic numbers, defined similarly to the Bernoulli numbers, that are related to special values of Dirichlet L-functions in the same way that Bernoulli numbers are related to special values of the Riemann zeta function.
Let χ be a Dirichlet character modulo f. The generalized Bernoulli numbers attached to χ are defined by
Apart from the exceptional B1,1=1/2, we have, for any Dirichlet character χ, that Bk,χ = 0 if χ(-1) ≠ (-1)k.
Generalizing the relation between Bernoulli numbers and values of the Riemann zeta function at non-positive integers, one has the for all integers k ≥ 1
where L(s, χ) is the Dirichlet L-function of χ.[tpl]harvnb|Neukirch|1999|loc=§VII.2[/tpl]

===Values of the first Bernoulli numbers===

Bn = 0 for all odd n other than 1. For even n, Bn is negative if n is divisible by 4 and positive otherwise. The first few non-zero Bernoulli numbers are:
From 6, the denominators are multiples of the sequence of period 2 : 6,30 [tpl]OEIS2C|id=A165734[/tpl]. From 2, the denominators are of the form 4*k + 2.
