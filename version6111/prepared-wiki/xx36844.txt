Armed and Dangerous is the first EP by American heavy metal band Anthrax, released in February 1985 through Megaforce Records. The band produced the album with Carl Canedy and Jon Zazula acting as executive producer. This is the first Anthrax release to feature Joey Belladonna on vocals.
The 1992 issue includes the songs "Soldiers of Metal" and "Howling Furies" as its last two tracks. The line-up for those two tracks is Neil Turbin, Scott Ian, Dan Spitz, Greg D'Angelo (except where Charlie Benante rerecorded the drums), and Dan Lilker.

The song "Armed and Dangerous" also appears on the album Spreading the Disease with a different mix, which does not include the fade-in intro leading into the initial acoustic guitar melody. That intro was omitted from the album version for unverified reasons but it is possible that it was for album continuity.
The song "Raise Hell" was an original Anthrax recording exclusive to the EP, and "God Save the Queen" was originally recorded by the Sex Pistols on the Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols album.
As of 2006, Armed and Dangerous had sold about 36,000 copies in the U.S since the beginning of the SoundScan era.http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/anthrax/222300-latest-sales-number-anthrax.html
