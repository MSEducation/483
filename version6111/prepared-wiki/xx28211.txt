An Individual Savings Account (ISA; [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|s|ə[/tpl]) is a class of retail investment arrangements available to residents of the United Kingdom. It qualifies for a favourable tax status. Payments into the account are made from after tax income. The account is exempt from income tax and capital gains tax on the investment returns, and no tax is payable on money withdrawn from the scheme either. Cash and a broad range of investments can be held within the arrangement, and there is no restriction on when or how much money can be withdrawn. Funds cannot be used as security for a loan. 

==Origins==

ISAs were introduced on 6 April 1999, replacing the earlier Personal Equity Plans (PEPs; very similar to a Stocks and Shares ISA) and Tax-Exempt Special Savings Accounts (TESSAs; very similar to a Cash ISA).  Other tax-advantaged savings that also predate ISAs include many offered by National Savings and Investments, which is a state-owned institution which has in the past offered a range of other tax-ree accounts, in addition to its own ISAs.
With a few exceptions, such as from an employee share ownership plan, all investor contributions must be in cash. Adult ISAs are available to UK residents aged over 16, provided that they have a National Insurance number, but individuals between 16 and 18 are only permitted to use the adult cash component or can use a Junior ISA.
There are two broad types of ISA, cash or stocks and shares.

===Cash ISA===

A bank account which enjoys tax free status. Under the ISA rules, a cash ISA could also hold qualifying investments that fail the 5% test for holding within a stocks and shares ISA,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/isa/isa-bulletin2.htm|title=ISA Bulletin 2: Qualifying investments – db x-trackers – Sterling Money Market ETF|publisher=HM Revenue and Customs|accessdate=24 November 2010|quote=investors could be certain (or near certain) of getting back 95 per cent or more of their initial investment. The fund therefore fails the 5 per cent test and is a qualifying investment for cash ISAs, not stocks and shares ISAs[/tpl] but this facility is rarely, if ever, made available by the bank.

===Stocks and shares ISA===

The money is invested in 'qualifying investments'. Except for cash there must be a credible possibility of losing at least 5% of the investment, otherwise the investment must be held in a cash ISA instead. Qualifying investments are:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/isa/isa-guidance-notes.pdf|title=ISAs: Guidance Notes for ISA Managers|publisher=HM Revenue and Customs|accessdate=23 October 2011[/tpl]
Many of the above restrictions are due to be relaxed in July 2014, for example the minimum bond term of 5 years.

==Junior ISAs==

Junior ISAs were introduced on 1 November 2011 with an initial subscription limit of £3,600. At age 18 the JISA converts to an adult ISA. Like adult ISAs, JISAs are available in both cash and stocks and shares types. Money cannot be withdrawn until age 18 unless a terminal illness claim is agreed or following closure of the account after the death of the child. A child can open their own account from age 16, otherwise a person with parental responsibility can do it. They are available to those who are:
Unlike an adult ISA a child can only hold a total of one cash ISA and one stocks and shares ISA, including for all money from past years, but transfers of these two accounts can be carried out between providers as for adult accounts, except that transfers from S&S ISA to cash ISA are also permitted. Up to the full JISA limit can be used for any combination of cash and stocks and shares ISA subscriptions. An additional adult cash ISA can be held between 16 and 18. In the year in which a child becomes 18 the full adult and child ISA limits can both be used. Unlike adult ISAs a JISA allows transfers from the S&S form to the cash form.
Each child ISA has a single registered contact, a person with parental responsibility. From age 16 a child can register to be their own contact and this registration cannot normally be reversed. Except in that case and adoptive parents registering, the previous registered contact will be contacted to obtain their consent to a change of contact.

==Subscription limits==

There are restrictions on investing in ISAs in each tax year (6 April to the following 5 April) which affect the type of ISA that may be opened and the cumulative amount of investment during the course of that year. The key restrictions are:
These restrictions only apply to money paid in during the current tax year. For adult ISAs an unlimited number of accounts can hold money from past years and it can be freely moved between providers using ISA transfer requests.
In the March 2010 Budget the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that in future years the limits would rise annually with inflation,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/7513829/Budget-2010-ISA-limits-will-rise-with-inflation.html|author=Gammell, Kara|title=Budget 2010: ISA limits will rise with inflation|work=The Telegraph|date=25 March 2010|accessdate=2 April 2013|quote=The annual limit on individual savings accounts (ISAs) will rise from £7,200 to £10,200 from next month and the limits will increase each year in line with inflation[/tpl] rounded to the nearest £120, to ease the arithmetic for those using monthly payment schemes. From 2013–14 the inflation index used is changing from RPI to CPI.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced in the March 2014 Budget that the adult ISA limit would be increased to £15,000 from 1 July 2014, and the Junior ISA limit to £4,000. From that date savers will be allowed to invest the full amount as cash or stocks and shares, or a mix of both. Savers will also be able to switch stocks and shares ISAs to cash ISAs.[tpl]cite news |last=Peachey |first=Kevin |date=19 March 2014 |title=Budget 2014: What it means for you |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26619585 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=27 March 2014[/tpl]

==Transfer rules==

One can transfer ISAs from one manager to another; but:

==Fund Supermarkets and Self Select ISA providers==

There is no legal distinction between a fund supermarket and a self-select ISA provider. These are merely marketing terms used by stocks and shares ISA providers to distinguish the type of business that they tend to seek. Firms favouring collective investment business will often call themselves fund supermarkets, while firms who focus on share dealing will often call themselves self-select ISA providers. A firm can freely offer all types of permitted investment, regardless of its name, and many do. Others choose to offer only collective investment funds. An individual may not be the provider for their own ISA.
Except for fund houses, it is usual for providers to offer the facility to hold funds managed by many different organisations.
Instead of explicitly charging the investor, the S&S providers have until now often been remunerated by the fund managers out of their usual charges, though some may have both explicit dealing charges and collect the commission while others may make charges and refund all commission.
Examples of large ISA "providers" are Bestinvest's Online Investment Service, TD Direct Investing, Fidelity FundsNetwork, Clubfinance's Frequent Trader Platform, Hargreaves Lansdown's Vantage Service and Interactive Investor.

==Charges==

The ISA cash component normally has no disclosed charges: the company makes its money by taking a margin between the retail interest rate and the wholsale interest rate that it receives. Some providers charge a fee for transferring to another provider.
The built-in annual "re-registering" of an ISA may attract a fee which may be automatically extracted from an account, though this is normally done only by firms specialising in share deals, not those using funds or both funds and shares.
Stocks and shares ISA fund supermarkets often reduce some or all of the initial and annual charges made by fund houses to below the level paid when purchasing direct from the fund provider, often to zero initial charge. Some providers levy dealing charges even for fund transactions, typically firms desiring direct share investments more than fund investments. Dealing charges for shares are normal even from providers that do not charge for fund transactions. Firms that primarily focus on fund transactions tend to have higher share dealing charges than providers specialising in share transactions.

==Tax treatment==

Interest on deposits in a cash ISA is not taxed, whether it is an instant access or term deposit.
Interest on cash in a S&S ISA is subject to a 20% charge. Dividends are not subject to additional tax, interest on bonds is not taxed, and capital gains are not taxed (nor may capital losses be used to offset other gains).
There is no need to report interest or other income, capital gains or trades to HMRC as it is not taxable income. This is a considerable paperwork reduction for active traders or those who may otherwise be required to report their trades because they have total sales value exceeding four times the annual CGT allowance, which outside a tax wrapper would require that all trades be reported even if there is no capital gains tax to pay.
Since the income is not taxable it does not count for age-related personal income tax allowance reduction (although this age-related element is now being phased out).

==Transition and older types of ISA==

PEPs became stocks and shares ISAs, with an exemption that allowed them to continue to hold investments that could not be held in a stocks and shares ISA, provided that the investment did meet the pre-2001 PEP rules.
For some time there were Mini ISAs, Maxi ISAs and TESSA-only ISAs. A Mini ISA could hold cash OR a single holding of shares (except in the event of a demerger), while a Maxi ISA could hold cash AND stocks. Any UK resident individual aged 18 or over could invest in one 'maxi' ISA per year, with both components provided by a single financial institution. Alternatively, a person could invest in two 'mini' ISAs, one for each component. The two mini ISAs could be with two different providers if the investor wished. TOISAs and the full transfer of ISAs created in previous years to another provider had no bearing on these restrictions. In the March 2007 Budget the limits for the 2008/9 tax year were also increased.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/isa/rule-change-april08.htm|title=Rule changes from April 2008|publisher=HM Revenue and Customs|accessdate=24 January 2008[/tpl] From tax year 2008/2009 the distinction between a mini and maxi ISA was abolished.
An insurance component was available in both maxi and mini ISAs. Since the 2005/06 tax year this component has not been available. Collective investment funds that once qualified for this component will have been reclassified as qualifying for either the Cash or Stocks & Shares component.
New TESSAs could not be created after 5 April 1999, so the required five year term of all TESSAs ended by 5 April 2004. TOISAs were created to allow the original capital (excluding interest) invested in a TESSA (up to £9,000) to be reinvested in a tax free form. One could only invest in a TOISA  the capital from a matured TESSA, and new TOISAs could be created only for the complete transfer of funds from another TOISA.

===CAT standards===

In April 1999, the Government introduced a voluntary CAT standard for ISAs (standing for "Charges, Access, and Terms") to make them easier for inexperienced customers to understand and with the proposed intention that lower costs would attract more investors.  It does not guarantee the investment performance or that investors would buy or be sold the right type of investment.
Many equity funds also meet the CAT standards, but the restriction on costs generally means that these funds are index funds, which require little management and simply follow a given index, such as the FTSE 100 Index.
CAT standards were discontinued by the Treasury on 6 April 2005 following the introduction of the stakeholder product suite, although existing CAT standard ISAs continued on the same terms and conditions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_95_04.htm|title=CAT standards|publisher=HM Treasury|accessdate=27 October 2009[/tpl]
