Sfihah ([tpl]lang-ar|صفيحة[/tpl] sfīḥah) or lahm bi`ajin ([tpl]lang-ar|لحم بعجين[/tpl] laḥm bi‘ajīn), also known as Arab Pizza, is an Arab pizza-like dish originating from the Arabian Peninsula and Levant, and introduced in Brazil by Levantine immigrants.
In contrast to the modern use of lamb or beef, traditional sfiha are open-faced meat pies made with ground mutton. Historically, sfiha were much like dolma—simply ground lamb, lightly spiced, wrapped in brined grape leaves. In Brazil, sfihas are folded into a triangular pastry, although the open-faced version is very common too.
