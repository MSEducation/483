Vol. 1, p.135 Jervis went to take command of the Mediterranean fleet in the frigate [tpl]HMS|Lively|1794|2[/tpl]Tucker. Vol. 1, p.149 and once more took Charles Grey's son, Captain George Grey, as his flag-captain. Jervis also took Robert Calder as his captain of the fleet. On arrival at Gibraltar Jervis took [tpl]HMS|Victory[/tpl] as his flagship. Amongst Jervis' subordinates were Captains Horatio Nelson, Cuthbert Collingwood and Thomas Troubridge. Jervis began a close blockade of Toulon and Nelson was assigned the task of aiding the Austrian army along the Italian coast. By September 1796 the British presence in the Mediterranean had become untenable.Mahan Vol. 1, p.206 Napoleon had beaten Britain's Austrian allies who were in disarrayTucker. Vol. 1, p.158–160 and, in October, Spain had surrendered and allied themselves to the French.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.215 Jervis recalled Admiral Robert Mann to aid in the blockade of Cadiz. Mann took his ships instead to Spithead.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.217–219 Jervis abandoned Corsica between September and November 1796 and withdrew his forces to Gibraltar.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.216 A Spanish fleet made up of twenty four line-of-battle ships and seven frigates sailed from Toulon on 1 February 1797. Jervis' fleet of ten ships-of-the-line was patrolling off Cape Saint Vincent and was subsequently joined by five more under Sir William Parker. The Spanish admiral, José de Córdoba, had taken his ships into the Atlantic to weather a storm and was making his way to Cadiz when the two fleets caught sight of each other.

====The Battle of Cape St. Vincent====

The British and Spanish fleet sighted one another at dawn on 14 February 1797. The British fleet had fifteen line-of-battle ships against the twenty four Spanish ships.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.253 On the quarter-deck of Victory, Jervis and his flag captain, Robert Calder counted the ships. It was at this point Jervis discovered that he was outnumbered nearly two-to-one:

During the battle Nelson, in command of [tpl]HMS|Captain|1787|6[/tpl], wore out of line and performed a stunning feat by capturing two of the enemy vessels within moments. Nelson and his crew boarded and captured one and crossed her deck and boarded and captured the second, which had collided in the smoke and general melee of the battle.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.255–262Coleman, 2001. p.126 The move was later feted by the public and press and dubbed "Nelson’s patent bridge for boarding first-rates."Coleman, 2001. p.127 When the Spanish retreated Jervis did not press his advantage but consolidated his victory and began the lengthy job of repairing both his ships and crews. The British had suffered casualties of 73 killed and 227 wounded.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.266–267

Jervis silenced him by saying: "It certainly was so, and if you ever commit such a breach of your orders, I will forgive you also."Mahan Vol. 1, p.238

Both Jervis and Nelson were hailed as heroes and Jervis was made Baron Jervis of Meaford and Earl St Vincent.[tpl]London Gazette|issue=14012 |date=1797-23-05 |startpage=474|endpage=|accessdate=13 July 2010[/tpl]Coleman, 2001. p.130 Songs were written about Jervis and the battle and there was a general feeling of relief in both the Government and people of Britain.Palmer p.185 Nelson for his services was invested as a Knight of the Bath.Coleman 2001, p.130[tpl]London Gazette|issue=14012 |date=23 May 1797 |startpage=474|accessdate=12 July 2008[/tpl] The now Earl St Vincent was gifted a pension for life of £3,000 per year.Tucker.

====Mutiny and discipline====

During 1797 there was considerable discontent amongst the seamen of the Royal Navy. This discontent manifested itself at the Nore and at Spithead when the greater part of the Channel Fleet rose up against their officers. These mutinies were not overly violent and the officers were put ashore and the heads of the mutinies established their own order and kept the ships under "committee" control until their collective demands were met. The mutineers demands ranged from discontent at cruel officers to poor pay and long sea service without shore leave. There were other mutinies throughout the Navy that year, most notably [tpl]HMS|Hermione|1782|6[/tpl] and [tpl]HMS|Marie Antoinette|1793|6[/tpl] both on the Jamaica station. These mutinies resulted in the crews killing their officers and taking their ships into enemy held ports.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.293
Jervis had the reputation as a disciplinarian and put in place a new system that would ensure that the men in the Mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. To begin with the admiral wrote a new set of standing orders. For example, Jervis divided the seamen and marines and berthed the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.297 Thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.
Jervis discouraged conversation in Irish though he did not ban it. He ordered the marine detachments to be paraded every morning and, if there was a band available, for "God save the King" to be played. The marine detachment was then to remain armed at all times. Marines and soldiers were also excused from duties in regard to the general running of the ship.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.298
In order to keep his crews active and to ensure that the Spanish did not perceive that there might be discontent in the fleet, Jervis ordered the nightly bombardment of Cadiz in his own words to "Divert the animal."Tucker. Vol. 1, p.299Tucker. Vol. 1, p.325
The Admiral isolated the ships from one another to minimise collusion and the opportunities the men might have to band together in mutiny.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.300 St Vincent did ensure, however, that the men under his command were cared for. When the stock of tobacco ran low the Admiral ensured that the supply was renewed from his own funds.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.301 When the postmaster in Lisbon detained the letters and packets arriving from England for the men for fear that they would carry seditious communications, Jervis set up a post office aboard his flagship [tpl]HMS|Ville de Paris[/tpl] to receive and distribute all the letters that arrived for both seamen, marines and officers.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.322–323
Jervis strictly adhered to the Articles of War and individual regulations that he had written for his fleet. Any infraction was dealt with harshly and he was renowned for treating both officers and seamen with the same harsh discipline.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.329–330Tucker. Vol. 1, p.380 As an example, one officer who allowed his boats crew to plunder a fishing boat was placed before a court martial and it was ordered that he be "degraded from the rank of Midshipman in the most ignominious manner by having his uniform stripped from his back on the quarter deck of the (ship unknown)sic. before the whole ship's company and to be further disposed of as the Commander-in-chief shall direct. To be mulcted of his pay now due to him for his services on board any ship of his Majesty's service and to be rendered incapable of ever serving as an Officer or a Petty Officer in any of His Majesty's ships."Tucker. Vol. 1, p.382 Jervis later personally directed that the midshipman should have his head shaved, a notice hung around his neck describing his crime and that he should be solely responsible for the cleaning of the head (naval term for the communal toilets situated at the bow of the ship) until further notice. In another incident, St Vincent instructed that two men aboard [tpl]HMS|St George|1785|6[/tpl] who were tried for mutiny on a Saturday were executed on Sunday.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.310 The men were duly executed but Admiral Charles Thompson raised an objection to formal executions on the Sabbath and Jervis wrote to the Board of Admiralty demanding Thompson's removal or that they accept his own resignation. The Board relieved Thompson. On 9 July 1797 Nelson wrote to Jervis congratulating him in his resolve and wholeheartedly supporting his decision to execute the men on a Sunday.Tucker.

Jervis could also be exceptionally kind when he felt that the situation warranted it. On one occasion, whilst the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. The men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. One of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. In one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. The bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. The Admiral saw the man and asked the problem. One of his officers told him and St Vincent went to his cabin. When he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. "Roger Odell you are convicted, Sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the British oak with tears. What have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?" The man told him what had happened and St Vincent replied "Roger Odell you are one of the best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life I never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the Victory in the action with the Spanish fleet. To show therefore that your Commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. There is your money Sir!" The Earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor "but no more tears mind, no more tears Sir."Tucker. Vol. 1, p.384–387
When Nelson returned to the Mediterranean St Vincent wrote to Earl Spencer, First Lord of the Admiralty: "I do assure your Lordship that the arrival of Admiral Nelson has given me new life; you could not have gratified me more than in sending him. His presence in the Mediterranean is so very essential."Tucker. Vol. 1, p.435 St Vincent detached Nelson to pursue Napoleon in his invasion of EgyptTucker. Vol. 1, p.345 Rear-Admiral Sir John Orde who was senior to Nelson complained publicly and bitterly about what he considered a personal slight.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.351 Jervis ordered Orde home.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.452 Orde requested that he be court-martialled in order that he might have the opportunity to clear his name. The Board refused.The Naval Chronicle Vol. 11, p. 194 Orde then requested that St Vincent be brought before a court-martial. Again, the Board refused.The Naval Chronicle Vol. 11, p. 195 The Board censured Jervis for not having supported his subordinates.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.353–354 Orde later challenged the ageing admiral to a duel. The challenge became public knowledge and the king ordered Jervis to decline.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.3 Before the challenge was formally declined, Orde wrote to the Board to inform them that he had withdrawn it.The Naval Chronicle Vol. 11, p. 197–201
When the men aboard the [tpl]HMS|Marlborough|1767|2[/tpl] refused to execute a man for mutinous behaviour and their captain did nothing, the Earl threatened the captain with replacement and had boats from the rest of the fleet armed with carronades surround the Marlborough; he then threatened to sink the ship if his orders were not carried out. The man was duly executed. St Vincent turned to an officer beside him watching the mutineer hanging from the yard arm and said "Discipline is preserved, Sir!"Tucker. Vol. 1, p.304–308
Between 1797 and 1799 alongside the suppression of mutiny Jervis set himself the task of improving the dockyards and defences of Gibraltar including building a new Victualling Yard and Water Tanks to replenish his ships.[tpl]cite book|last=Jackson|first=Sir William G.

Vol. 1, p.344–378 Lady Lavinia Bingham, wife of Earl Spencer wrote to St Vincent to congratulate him for having provided the necessary tools for Nelson to have achieved the victory he did at the Nile. "Never did disinterested zeal and friendship meet with a brighter reward than yours has reaped in this victory of your gallant friend."Tucker. Vol. 1, p.454 Nelson commented that he had "never beheld a fleet equal to Sir John Jervis'"Palmer p.170 Having had great difficulty supplying the fleet with fresh water the Admiral arranged for large tanks to be built in Gibraltar.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.377–378 On 14 February 1799 St Vincent was created admiral of the white. Constant service and approaching old age meant that the admiral became increasingly unwell. Despite his failing health, St Vincent was reluctant to relinquish command and the Board reluctant to supersede him. By 17 June 1799 he had no choice but to resign his command and return to England. During his time ashore the Earl lived in Rochetts, Essex with his wife.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.2

===Command of the Channel Fleet===

left|thumb| John Bull peeping into Brest, The caption above the French fleet reads: "Mercy on us what a Monster – he'll swallow all my ships at a mouthful. I hope he don't see me."As his health had improved he was given command of the Channel Fleet. St Vincent was to comment "The King and the government require it and the discipline of the British Navy demand it. It is of no consequence to me whether I die afloat of ashore. The die is cast."Tucker. Vol. 2, p.5
He took command of the Channel fleet in [tpl]HMS|Namur|1756|6[/tpl] on 26 April 1800 and took up a close blockade of Brest. Once at Brest he transferred to the Ville de Paris of 110 guns and took Sir Thomas Troubridge as his captain of the fleet. He was also accompanied by his personal physician, Doctor Andrew Baird.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.6 Baird was later to become instrumental in the plans of the commander-in-chief and the health and well being of the Channel fleet.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.26
St Vincent's appointment was not popular amongst the officers of the Channel fleet.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.10Tucker. Vol. 2, p.89  His reputation as a strict disciplinarian had followed him from the Mediterranean and he immediately issued orders banning officers and captain to sleep ashore and forbade them from travelling more than three miles from their ship.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.11Tucker. Vol. 2, p.97  Amongst other strict regulations introduced were orders that ships were to be repaired where possible at sea and that Ushant was to be the official rendezvous for the Channel fleet rather than the traditional Torbay. The wife of one of his captains is said to have toasted the news of his appointment with the line "May his next glass of wine choke the wretch."Tucker. Vol. 2, p.37 Ships were forbidden to go to Spithead without specific written orders from the Admiral or Admiralty.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.14Tucker. Vol. 2, p.34–38 During his command he remained with the fleet and became respected by the officers and men for suffering their hardships with them.
With the charts that he had made with Barrington in 1775 the inshore squadron at Brest was able to keep a much tighter blockade. In one incident, the inshore squadron sighted several French ships leaving Brest. Sir Edward Pellew, captain of HMS Impétueux, gave chase. The rear admiral in charge of the inshore squadron recalled him, worried that the Impétueux would run aground. The French escaped. After several letters went back and forth between the two admirals, St Vincent, tired of his subordinate's excuses, took the entire offshore squadron and sailed them between the inshore squadron and the shore thus proving that the ships had a shallow enough draught to have given chase and captured the French. St Vincent then wrote to the rear admiral and suggested that he strike his flag and return to shore for some needed rest.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.38
St Vincent was as generous in the Channel as he had been in the Mediterranean. A particular letter from England made the admiral host a dinner aboard the flagship for fifty of the officers whom he felt closest to. At the dinner he revealed that the letter was from an orphanage near Paddington in London. The orphanage had run out of money to support the children of sailors who had died in the service of their country. St Vincent solicited from each captain and lieutenant a sum of money and then added his own donation. The cutter sailed back to England the same evening.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.46–49 St Vincent gave the orphanage £1,000Tucker. Vol. 2, p.93–94
St Vincent's skills as an administrator and logistician came into play and he issued orders regarding the health and well being of the fleet. St Vincent wrote to Earl Spencer, commenting "I have ever considered the care of the sick and wounded as one of the first duties of a Commander-in-chief, by sea or land,".Tucker. Vol. 2, p.116 Based on Doctor Baird's advice on cleanliness and hygieneTucker. Vol. 2, p.90 the admiral brought in as many fresh vegetables as he could, along with vast quantities of fresh lemon juice to minimise illness, particularly scurvy. The effect was dramatic. The hospital ship that accompanied the fleet was sent home unneeded and in November 1800 when the fleet came to anchor in Torbay there were as few as sixteen hospital cases amongst the estimated twenty three thousand men.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.31 In a letter to Sir Evan Nepean, first secretary to the Admiralty, St Vincent described Baird as "the most valuable man in the Navy not excepting the Board itself,"Tucker. Vol. 2, p.33 The oncoming winter of 1800–1801 forced the admiral to live ashore at Torre Abbey overlooking Torbay.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.49Tucker. Vol. 2, p.111  Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Harvey took over operational command of the fleet in St Vincent's absence.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.50
In 1801 in a letter to the Board of Admiralty, St Vincent made the now famous remark: "I do not say, my Lords, that the French will not come. I say only they will not come by sea."[tpl]cite book | last = Andidora | first = Ronald | title = Iron Admirals: Naval Leadership in the Twentieth Century | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-313-31266-3 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=0P-A8rIfO34C&pg=PA3 | page = 3[/tpl] In 1801 St Vincent was replaced by Admiral William Cornwallis and the new Prime Minister Henry Addington promoted St Vincent to First Lord of the Admiralty.[tpl]London Gazette|issue=15338 |date=1801-17-02 |startpage=202|endpage=|accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl]Tucker.

==First Lord of the Admiralty==

right|thumb|upright| John Jervis 1st Earl of St Vincent, 1806
by Domenico Pellegrini In January 1801 St Vincent had written a short letter to the then First Lord Earl Spencer stating: "Nothing short of a radical sweep in the dockyards can cure the enormous evils and corruptions in them; and this cannot be attempted till we have peace."Tucker. Vol. 2, p.123 As First Lord St Vincent intended to investigate, discover and remove all of the corruption that he considered plagued the Navy, the Royal Dockyards and their civilian administration. Consequently, he clashed with the various Navy Boards, the civil administration of the Royal Navy that administered amongst other things the navy yards and stores.The Naval Chronicle Vol. 13, p. 236 St Vincent saw these boards and individuals as hindering the efforts of the Navy.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.112Tucker. Vol. 2, p.147

===The Commission of Inquiry===

During the peace with France, after the Treaty of Amiens was signed on 25 March 1802, St Vincent ordered the Navy Board to begin an investigation for fraud and corruption in the Royal Dockyards. He swiftly found that the investigations were not being conducted effectively and ordered the commissioners to retrieve all logs and accounts and inventories and put them under their "personal seal" in anticipation of the Admiralty Board travelling to the various yards itself and conducting their own inspection.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.147–149 The investigation began in earnest in 1802. St Vincent swiftly uncovered casual and obvious abuses of the system. Some men were listed as having done work, then over-time and then acted as night watchmen for years without a break of any kind. Others were listed as workmen ashore but also as sailors receiving pay in the Receiving Ship.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.150 Work was done and then the identical work was charged for over various periods, often by different departments or sections.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.151 In another yard, "The men of an entire department were found to be incapables, as old, infirm boys, cripples, or idiots, and the department itself to have the appearance of an asylum for every rogue and vagabond that could not obtain a meal by any other means." St Vincent found that minor dockyard officials were the tip of a far bigger corruption. He lobbied the government to create a special commission of inquiry that would have the power to question suspects under oath. The cabinet determined that the outcome of such an inquiry might be damaging politically (and possibly in some cases, personally) and gave the board of inquiry permission to question suspects under oath but gave the suspects the right to refuse to answer questions that might incriminate themselves. This addendum removed the ability of the inquiry to act effectively in any way.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.155–157 The Commission of Inquiry produced twelve reports:
1. Foreign Yards;
2. the Chatham Chest (the pension fund for seamen);
3. supply of Blocks and Naval Cooperage;
4. prize money and prize causes;
5. the Collection of the sixpence from Merchant Seamen;
6. the Economy of the Naval Yards;
7. the Naval Hospitals and the Hospital ships for French prisoners at Plymouth;
8. the Victualling and Cooperage at Plymouth;
9. the receipt and expenditure of stores at Plymouth;
10. Office of Treasurer of the Navy;
11. the issue of Money Bills;
12. the purchase Stores for the Naval Service more particularly Masts, Spars, Fir and Hemp
One of St Vincent's biographers put the findings of the commission succinctly "The valuable British oak rotted in the forests for want of the axe; the frames building rotted on the stocks for want of timber; the ships at sea rotted before their day because constructed of such worthless perishable materials."Tucker. Vol. 2, p.162–163

===Reform===

thumb|right|alt=The Portsmouth Block Mills showing remaining overhead belt drive system. One reform St Vincent did achieve was the introduction of block making machinery at the navy yard in Portsmouth. The machinery was designed by Marc Isambard Brunel and Samuel Bentham. By 1808 forty-five machines were turning out 130,000 pulley blocks per year. The innovation meant that only ten to thirty unskilled men were able to equal the output of 100 skilled blockmakers and the capital cost of the project was recovered in three years. The revolution of machinery enabled the Navy to become self-sufficient in regard to the production of the essential blocks. This self-sufficiency removed a great deal of corruption, from external contractors producing inferior goods that jeopardised sailors' lives, to the corruption that arose from poorly paid officials responsible for awarding contracts and the bribes that might ensue.[tpl]cite web |title=Portsmouth Royal Dockyard: History 1690–1840 |url=http://www.portsmouthdockyard.org.uk/Page%206.htm | work=Portsmouth Royal Dockyard Historical Trust|publisher =portsmouthdockyard.org.uk|accessdate=19 July 2010[/tpl]Tucker.

As First Lord, St Vincent also determined to build a breakwater in Plymouth.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.168 The First Lord commissioned a civil engineer, John Rennie, and Joseph Whidbey, the former Master-Attendant at Woolwich dockyard, to design the breakwater. Work did not begin until 1811 but the earl is widely credited as the force behind its construction.[tpl]cite web |title=Plymouth Breakwater – A History|url= http://www.plymouthdata.info/Breakwater.htm| work= Brian Moseley, Plymouth, UK|publisher = http://www.plymouthdata.info|accessdate=19 July 2010[/tpl]Tucker. Vol. 2, p.270
St Vincent spoke with the King regarding the contribution made by marines to the general service of the Navy and recommended to the King that the prefix "Royal" be added. These were the first official discussions into the retitling of the corps to Royal Marines.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.137
During his tenure, the workers in the Royal dockyards demanded an increase in pay due to an increase in living costs. St Vincent reacted by dismissing the ringleaders and every man who had taken an active role in the strike. He eventually agreed to a small temporary allowance for the purchase of bread whilst the price of bread remained high.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.132–136
St Vincent's gaze passed over every aspect of the Navy from the Sea Fencibles to the Navy Hospitals. The earl attempted to disband the Sea Fencibles claiming that they were needed only to quiet the fears of little old ladies and that good men passed their whole careers without hearing a shot fired.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.206–207 Doctor Baird, St Vincent's personal physician, was appointed to the Sick and Hurt Board as Inspector of all Hospitals.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.207

===Powers to promote===

Another burden of his promotion to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers and their relatives and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.
The ways in which St Vincent chose to communicate the rejections often depended on the number of letters, the individual concerned, or the demands made by their respective well wishers. To the Earl of Portsmouth he wrote: "I cannot possibly agree in opinion with your Lordship, that a person sitting quietly by his fireside, and enjoying very nearly a sinecure, during such a war as we have been engaged in, has the same pretensions to promotion with the man who has exposed his person, and hazarded his constitution in every clime."Tucker. Vol. 2, p.192 A harsh rebuff to a peer of the realm. Yet to a lady of no discernible rank or influence he wrote: "Although I cannot admit the force of your argument in favour of Captain (name unknown) sic., there is something so amiable and laudable in a sister contending for the promotion of her brother that no apology was necessary for your letter of the 24th, which I lose no time in acknowledging;"Tucker. Vol. 2, p.194
Famously, when Commander Lord Cochrane captured the 32-gun Spanish frigate El Gamo in the 14-gun sloop [tpl]HMS|Speedy|1782|6[/tpl] a promotion was the usual reward for such a feat of skill and seamanship. It would be fair to argue that it would have been expected by both the commander and his friends and family. Unfortunately for Cochrane, the ship carrying the letter of that victory was intercepted and it was only received after he had himself been captured by the French and was facing a court-martial over the loss of his ship. A court-martial for losing one's ship was common practice at the time and in many cases, including Cochrane's, it was only a formality. It was only when Cochrane was cleared by the court that he could be promoted. Unfortunately the commander thought that the First Lord had deliberately withheld the promotion due to an unforeseen grudge; he held this opinion for the rest of his life.[tpl]Cite book | last = Vale| first = Brian| title = The Audacious Admiral Cochrane: The True Life of a Naval Legend| publisher = Conway Maritime Press| year =2004| isbn=978-0-85177-986-7|pages = 34–37[/tpl] Cochrane had many powerful friends and relatives who lobbied continuously on his behalf. These solicitations may have had a negative effect on Cochrane's career as it is possible that Jervis became irritated by them.

===Resignation as First Lord===

The detailed investigation into corruption that St Vincent began caused him to become extremely unpopular as many influential men were involved in the various money making schemes perpetrated. The board of inquiry set up by St Vincent was responsible for the impeachment of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville and his trial for misappropriation of public funds. St Vincent had made an enemy of Pitt and Pitt used the naval reform and its unpopularity to attack the First Lord and the Addington administration.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.208–230Ralfe. Vol.1, p.312  St Vincent left the office on 14 May 1804 when Addington was replaced as Prime Minister by Pitt.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.230–231  Lord Howick, second son of St Vincent's friend Sir Charles Grey came to his defence and with the assistance of Charles James Fox moved for a vote of thanks in the Commons for St Vincent's tireless efforts in naval reform in 1806.
On 14 May 1806, John Jeffery, one of the Members of Parliament for Poole, opened a Parliamentary debate condemning St Vincent for "unprecedented neglect in building and repairing of ships whilst his Lordship presided at the Board of Admiralty and with delivering up the navy to his successor in a far less efficient state than that in which he received it".http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1806/may/14/conduct-of-earl-st-vincent#S1V0007P0_18060514_HOC_15
This motion was rejected and instead the Foreign Secretary, Charles James Fox, proposed a vote of thanks to Earl St Vincent, "That it appears to this house, that the conduct of the Earl of St. Vincent, in his late naval administration, has added an additional lustre to his exalted character, and is entitled to the approbation of this house."http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1806/may/14/vote-of-thanks-to-earl-st-vincent
Fox had said of St Vincent's appointment in 1801 "allow me to say, that I do not think it would be easy, if possible, to find a man in the whole community better suited, or more capable of the high office he fills, than the distinguished person at the head of the Admiralty – I mean the Earl of St Vincent." and had continued his support of the Earl throughout his time as first lord.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.129Tucker. Vol. 2, p.256

==Resumption of command==

On 9 November 1805 St Vincent was promoted admiral of the red.[tpl]London Gazette|issue=15859 |date=11 May 1823 |startpage=1373|endpage=|accessdate=15 July 2010[/tpl]  He took command of the Channel fleet once more in the 110-gun first-rate [tpl]HMS|Hibernia|1804|6[/tpl].Tucker. Vol. 2, p.253 During his tenure in command he spent much of his time at a house that he rented in the village of Rame.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.305 Once again he issued the orders that had become so effective in the Mediterranean and his previous Channel command.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.254 Once again these orders proved unpopular.The Naval Chronicle Vol. 15, p. 158 For a short time in 1806 he gave command of the Channel fleet to his second-in-command Sir Charles Cotton in order that he might travel to Portugal on a particular mission.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.256–259 Portugal was under threat of invasion and St Vincent had been ordered, if necessary, to take the Portuguese court to its colony in Brazil. The invasion of Portugal was delayed and St Vincent was recalled to the Channel fleet. It was Sir Sidney Smith and Graham Moore who led the Royal family to safety in Brazil.[tpl]cite book| last = Gomes| first = Laurentino| title = 1808|publisher = Editora Planeta do Brasil Ltda.| isbn = | year =2007[/tpl] St Vincent had long suffered from poor health and a change in government led to his resignation on 24 April 1807.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.263
The Earl had always attempted to promote on merit rather than patronage and had become increasingly frustrated with the system of preferment by social rank and not competence. At his retirement in 1807 he had an audience with the King. The King asked if the navy were a better institution now than it had been on St Vincent's entrance into it. St Vincent replied that it was not. He stated: "Sire I have always thought that a sprinkling of nobility was very desirable in the Navy, as it gives some sort of consequence to the service; but at present the Navy is so overrun by the younger branches of nobility, and the sons of Members of Parliament and they so swallow up all the patronage and so choke the channel to promotion, that the son of an old Officer, however meritorious both their services may have been, has little or no chance of getting on." He continued on "I would rather promote the son of an old deserving Officer than of any noble in the land."Tucker. Vol. 2, p.267
In a letter dated 18 October 1806 to Viscount Howick, then the First Lord. "If you will, my good Lord, bring a bill into Parliament to disqualify any Officer under the rank of Rear-Admiral to sit in the House of Commons, the Navy may be preserved; but while a little, drunken, worthless jackanapes is permitted to hold the seditious language he has done, in the presence of Flag-officers of rank, you will require a man of greater health and vigour than I possess to command your fleets."Tucker. Vol. 2, p.306–307 Presumably St Vincent was referring to a particular member of Parliament although his feelings on the subject remain clear. right|thumb|upright| Earl St Vincent in retirement

==Final years==

In his retirement he seldom took his seat in the House of Lords and made his last appearance in either 1810 or 1811. During these final years St Vincent gave generously to various charities, organisations and individuals. He donated £500 to the wounded and survivors of the Battle of Waterloo and £300 to relieve starvation in Ireland.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.328 St Vincent also donated £100 to the building of a Jewish chapel in Whitechapel, London.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.355 In 1807 St Vincent, as a member of the House of Lords, opposed a bill to abolish the slave trade. His motives appear to have been practical rather than humanitarian or otherwise.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.337–338 St Vincent argued that if Britain were to ban the trade it would simply be continued by other countries and thereby Britain would lose the revenue generated and be weakened accordingly. St Vincent spoke in opposition to the Convention of SintraTucker. Vol. 2, p.339–344 He spoke against the Walcheren Campaign and then condemned its failure, although conspicuously excluded the failure of its officers and men.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.349–352 St Vincent spoke in defence of Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore's retreat through Spain and Portugal and condemned the government and army commanders for failure to support him thoroughly. In 1816 his wife Martha died at Rochetts in Essex.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.362 The couple had no children. In the winter of 1818–1819 St Vincent went to recover his health in France.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.383 When he arrived at Toulon he was greeted by Admiral Édouard Missiessy who said of St Vincent that he was: "as much the father of the French as of the English Navy."Tucker. Vol. 2, p.384

===Further honours===

In 1800 St Vincent was made an honorary lieutenant-general of Marines[tpl]London Gazette|issue=15288 |date=1800-26-08 |startpage=979|endpage=|accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl] and in 1814 was promoted to general.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.380[tpl]London Gazette|issue=16897 |date=5 October 1814 |startpage=984|endpage=985|accessdate=16 July 2010[/tpl] These positions were little more than a sinecure and carried no official duties. In 1801 St Vincent had been created Viscount St Vincent of Meaford, Staffordshire.[tpl]London Gazette|issue=15356 |date=1801-18-04 |startpage=421|endpage=|accessdate=16 July 2010[/tpl] a title that because he had no children passed to his nephew, Edward Jervis Ricketts. In 1806 he was appointed as one of the thirty one elder brothers of Trinity House. The elder brothers along with the master form the court of Trinity House. In 1809 St Vincent was honoured by John VI of Portugal who awarded him the Royal Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword in order to commemorate the safe arrival of the Royal Family in Brazil, after Napoleon had invaded Portugal.[tpl]London Gazette|issue=17924 |date=1823-20-05 |startpage=818|endpage=|accessdate=15 July 2010[/tpl]
In May 1814 he was promoted acting admiral of the fleet and commander-in-chief of the Channel squadron. He was confirmed Admiral of the fleet on 29 January 1820 and George IV sent him a gold topped baton[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/object.cfm?ID=PLT0174 |title=Admiral of the Fleet's baton |accessdate=28 September 2010[/tpl] as a symbol of the office.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.386 The baton is currently held in the collections of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/object.cfm?ID=PLT0174 |title= Admiral of the Fleet's baton presented to John Jervis, Earl St Vincent, held in the collections of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich|accessdate=28 September 2010[/tpl] On 2 January 1815 he was made Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath when the order was rearranged by the Prince Regent. The knight grand cross is the highest rank in the order.Tucker. Vol. 2, p.382

===Death and memorial===

St Vincent died on 13 March 1823 and, because he had no children, the Barony of Jervis and the Earldom of St Vincent became extinct. His nephew, Edward Jervis Ricketts, became the 2nd Viscount St Vincent and changed his surname to Jervis, becoming Edward Jervis Jervis in honour of his uncle. St Vincent was buried at Stone in Staffordshire, in the family mausoleum, at his own requestTucker. Vol. 2, p.395 and a monument was erected in St. Paul's Cathedral.

===Legacy===

200px|left|thumb|HMS St Vincent at the Coronation Review, Spithead, 24 June 1911At least three ships and two stone frigates (or shore establishments) have been named [tpl]HMS|St Vincent[/tpl] either in honour of the Earl or after that battle that he won. [tpl]HMS|St. Vincent|1908|6[/tpl], commissioned in 1910 was the first of her class and therefore the class of battleship was named after her. The St. Vincent-class battleships included [tpl]HMS|Collingwood|1908|6[/tpl] and [tpl]HMS|Vanguard|1909|6[/tpl]. [tpl]HMS|Jervis|F00|2[/tpl], a J-class destroyer, launched just prior to the Second World War, was named after the Admiral. HMS Jervis served throughout the war. She was known as a lucky ship as, despite taking part in several actions, she never lost a man to enemy fire.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-36J-JervisJERVIS%201a.htm|title=HMS Jervis (F.00) –  J-class Flotilla Leader |author=Edited by Gordon Smith, Naval-History.Net|date=23 September 2009|publisher=Naval-History.Net |accessdate=16 July 2010[/tpl] HMS Jervis Bay, an armed merchant cruiser which was lost in heroic circumstances, was indirectly named after him.
Jervis has also been remembered in schools in England. He has a boarding house (Saint Vincent) named in his honour at the Royal Hospital School.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.royalhospitalschool.org/|title=Royal Hospital School |author= DSD Education |publisher=Copyright  Royal Hospital School 2007|accessdate=26 July 2010[/tpl] Saint Vincent College in Gosport, England is also named after the admiral.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stvincent.ac.uk/|title= Saint Vincent College, Gosport|publisher= 2008–2009 St Vincent College|accessdate=26 July 2010[/tpl]
As with many other officers during the great age of discovery there are several areas of the world named in the earl's honour. Cape Jervis and Gulf St Vincent, South Australia, and Jervis Bay, New South Wales, Australia were named for him as was the town of Vincentia and Jervis Bay National Park. The County of St Vincent, New South Wales was also named in his honour.[tpl]NSW GNR|id=TRjLZxtLSX|title=St Vincent (County)|accessdate=28 September 2010[/tpl] Jervis Inlet, in British Columbia, Canada, was also named for him.[tpl]cite bcgnis|10102|Jervis Inlet[/tpl]

==Historiography==

Though Jervis clearly had a strong impact during the Napoleonic Wars and afterwards on the development of the Navy, surprisingly few contemporary biographies of Jervis are available, and those are seriously lacking in breadth and thoroughness. The most recent work related to Jervis is The Remaking of the English Navy by Admiral St. Vincent: The Great Unclaimed Naval Revolution by Charles Arthur, 1986, but this focused more on Jervis's reforms to the docks, and less to other parts of his life. Evelyn Berkman's Nelson's Dear Lord: Portrait of St. Vincent (1962), as the bibliographer Eugene Rasor points out, is merely an "effort" to create a biography. The same bibliographer says much the same about William Milbourne James's "Old Oak": The Life of John Jervis, Earl St. Vincent (1950) and Owen Sherrard's A life of Lord St. Vincent (1933), pointing to both as mediocre. Ruddock Mackay published an article[tpl]when|date=November 2010[/tpl] in Mariner's Mirror which documented the early life of Jervis.[tpl]cite book| title = English/British Naval History to 1815: A Guide to the Literature| first = Eugene L. | last = Rasor| year = 2004| location = Westport, Connecticut| publisher = Praeger|isbn = 978-0-313-30547-4| pages = 200–201, 362[/tpl]
