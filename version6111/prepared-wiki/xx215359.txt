[[Uniform coloring]]

CATEGORIES: Tessellation, Polyhedra

In geometry, a uniform coloring is a property of a uniform figure (uniform tiling or uniform polyhedron) that is colored to be vertex-transitive. Different symmetries can be expressed on the same geometric figure with the faces following different uniform color patterns.
A uniform coloring can be specified by listing the different colors with indices around a vertex figure.

In addition, an n-uniform coloring is a property of a uniform figure which has n types vertex figure, that are collectively vertex transitive.
