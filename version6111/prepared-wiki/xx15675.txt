[[Niacin]]

CATEGORIES: Hypolipidemic agents, B vitamins, Nicotinic acids

Niacin (also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid) is an organic compound with the formula [tpl]chem|C|6|H|5|NO|2[/tpl] and, depending on the definition used, one of the 20 to 80 essential human nutrients.
Not enough niacin in the diet can cause nausea, skin and mouth lesions, anemia, headaches, and tiredness.  Chronic Niacin deficiency leads to a disease called pellagra.  The lack of niacin may also be observed in pandemic deficiency disease which is caused by a lack of five crucial vitamins:  niacin, vitamin C, thiamin, vitamin D and vitamin A, and is usually found in areas of widespread poverty and malnutrition.
Niacin has been used for over 50 years to increase levels of HDL in the blood and has been found to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events modestly in a number of controlled human trials.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bruckert|first=E|coauthors=Labreuche, J; Amarenco, P|title=Meta-analysis of the effect of nicotinic acid alone or in combination on cardiovascular events and atherosclerosis|journal=Atherosclerosis|date=June 2010|volume=210|issue=2|pages=353–61|pmid=20079494|doi=10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2009.12.023[/tpl]
This colorless, water-soluble solid is a derivative of pyridine, with a carboxyl group (COOH) at the 3-position.  Other forms of vitamin B3 include the corresponding amide, nicotinamide ("niacinamide"), where the carboxyl group has been replaced by a carboxamide group ([tpl]chem|CONH|2[/tpl]), as well as more complex amides and a variety of esters. Nicotinic acid and niacinamide are convertible to each other with steady world demand rising from 8,500 tonnes per year in 1980s to 40,000 in recent years.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 22112948 | year = 2011 | last1 = Cantarella | first1 = L | last2 = Gallifuoco | first2 = A | last3 = Malandra | first3 = A | last4 = Martínková | first4 = L | last5 = Spera | first5 = A | last6 = Cantarella | first6 = M | title = High-yield continuous production of nicotinic acid via nitrile hydratase-amidase cascade reactions using cascade CSMRs | volume = 48 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 345–50 | doi = 10.1016/j.enzmictec.2010.12.010 | journal = Enzyme and Microbial Technology[/tpl]
Niacin cannot be directly converted to nicotinamide, but both compounds are precursors of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) in vivo.[tpl]cite book |author=Cox, Michael; Lehninger, Albert L; Nelson, David R. |title=Lehninger principles of biochemistry |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=1-57259-153-6 [/tpl] NAD converts to NADP by phosphorylation in the presence of the enzyme NAD+ kinase. NADP and NAD are coenzymes for many dehydrogenases, participating in many hydrogen transfer processes.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 21128910 | year = 2011 | last1 = Wan | first1 = P | last2 = Moat | first2 = S | last3 = Anstey | first3 = A | title = Pellagra: A review with emphasis on photosensitivity | volume = 164 | issue = 6 | pages = 1188–200 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2010.10163.x | journal = The British journal of dermatology[/tpl] NAD is important in catabolism of fat, carbohydrate, protein, and alcohol, as well as cell signaling and DNA repair, and NADP mostly in anabolism reactions such as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. High energy requirements (brain) or high turnover rate (gut, skin) organs are usually the most susceptible to their deficiency.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 7229643 | year = 1981 | last1 = Ishii | first1 = N | last2 = Nishihara | first2 = Y | title = Pellagra among chronic alcoholics: Clinical and pathological study of 20 necropsy cases | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 209–15 | pmc = 490893 | journal = Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.44.3.209[/tpl]
Although the two are identical in their vitamin activity, nicotinamide does not have the same pharmacological effects (lipid modifying effects) as niacin. Nicotinamide does not reduce cholesterol or cause flushing.[tpl]cite journal |author=Jaconello P |title=Niacin versus niacinamide |journal=CMAJ |volume=147 |issue=7 |page=990 |date=October 1992 |pmid=1393911 |pmc=1336277 [/tpl] Niacin is involved in both DNA repair, and the production of steroid hormones in the adrenal gland.

==Dietary needs==

One recommended daily allowance of niacin is 2–12 mg/day for children, 14 mg/day for women, 16 mg/day for men, and 18 mg/day for pregnant or breast-feeding women.[tpl]cite web | url = http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/niacin/ | title = Niacin | publisher = Linus Pauling Institute | year = 2007 | last = Jacobson | first = EL | accessdate = 2011-08-08[/tpl] Tolerable upper intake levels (UL) for adult men and women is considered to be 35 mg/day by the Dietary Reference Intake system to avoid flushing.
In general, niacin status is tested through urinary biomarkers,[tpl]cite book |author=Institute of Medicine |authorlink=Institute of Medicine |title=Dietary Reference Intakes Research Synthesis: Workshop Summary |publisher=National Academies Press |year=2006 |page=37 |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11767&page=37[/tpl] which are believed to be more reliable than plasma levels.[tpl]cite journal |author=Jacob RA, Swendseid ME, McKee RW, Fu CS, Clemens RA |title=Biochemical markers for assessment of niacin status in young men: urinary and blood levels of niacin metabolites |journal=J.

==Deficiency==

At present, niacin deficiency is sometimes seen in developed countries, and it is usually apparent in conditions of poverty, malnutrition, and chronic alcoholism.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pitsavas S, Andreou C, Bascialla F, Bozikas VP, Karavatos A |title=Pellagra encephalopathy following B-complex vitamin treatment without niacin |journal=Int J Psychiatry Med |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=91–5 |year=2004 |pmid=15242145 |url=http://baywood.metapress.com/link.asp?id=29xv1gg1u17krgjh |doi=10.2190/29XV-1GG1-U17K-RGJH [/tpl]  It also tends to occur in areas where people eat maize (corn, the only grain low in digestible niacin) as a staple food.  A special cooking technique called nixtamalization is needed to increase the bioavailability of niacin during maize meal/flour production.
Mild niacin deficiency has been shown to slow metabolism, causing decreased tolerance to cold.
Severe deficiency of niacin in the diet causes the disease pellagra, which is characterized by diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia, as well as “Casal's necklace” lesions on the lower neck, hyperpigmentation, thickening of the skin, inflammation of the mouth and tongue, digestive disturbances, amnesia, delirium, and eventually death, if left untreated.[tpl]cite journal|title=Rapid resolution of delusional parasitosis in pellagra with niacin augmentation therapy|journal=General Hospital Psychiatry|first=Ravi|last=Prakash|coauthors=Sachin Gandotra, Lokesh Kumar Singh, Basudeb Das, Anuja Lakra|volume=30|issue=6|pages=581–4|doi= 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2008.04.011|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T70-4T24FKB-D/2/f619871a3d1f1d626b775c84523d6d94|pmid=19061687|year=2008 [/tpl]  Common psychiatric symptoms of niacin deficiency include irritability, poor concentration, anxiety, fatigue, restlessness, apathy, and depression.  Studies have indicated that, in patients with alcoholic pellagra, niacin deficiency may be an important factor influencing both the onset and severity of this condition.  Patients with alcoholism typically experience increased intestinal permeability, leading to negative health outcomes.
Hartnup’s disease is a hereditary nutritional disorder resulting in niacin deficiency.  This condition was first identified in the 1950s by the Hartnup family in London.  It is due to a deficit in the intestines and kidneys, making it difficult for the body to break down and absorb dietary tryptophan.  The resulting condition is similar to pellagra, including symptoms of red, scaly rash, and sensitivity to sunlight.  Oral niacin is given as a treatment for this condition in doses ranging from 40–200 mg, with a good prognosis if identified and treated early. Niacin synthesis is also deficient in carcinoid syndrome, because of metabolic diversion of its precursor tryptophan to form serotonin.

==Therapeutic effects==

In 1955, Altschul and colleagues described niacin as having a lipid lowering property for the first time.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 14350806 | year = 1955 | last1 = Altschul | first1 = R | last2 = Hoffer | first2 = A | last3 = Stephen | first3 = JD | title = Influence of nicotinic acid on serum cholesterol in man | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 558–9 | journal = Archives of biochemistry and biophysics | doi = 10.1016/0003-9861(55)90070-9[/tpl]  Niacin is the oldest lipid lowering drug with unique anti atherosclerotic property. It reduces traditional parameters such as low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), but effectively increases high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL).[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 22037771 | year = 2012 | last1 = Villines | first1 = TC | last2 = Kim | first2 = AS | last3 = Gore | first3 = RS | last4 = Taylor | first4 = AJ | title = Niacin: The evidence, clinical use, and future directions | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–59 | doi = 10.1007/s11883-011-0212-1 | journal = Current atherosclerosis reports[/tpl] Despite the importance of other cardiovascular risk factors, high HDL correlated to lower cardiovascular event independent of LDL reduction.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 17898099 | year = 2007 | last1 = Barter | first1 = P | last2 = Gotto | first2 = AM | last3 = Larosa | first3 = JC | last4 = Maroni | first4 = J | last5 = Szarek | first5 = M | last6 = Grundy | first6 = SM | last7 = Kastelein | first7 = JJ | last8 = Bittner | first8 = V | last9 = Fruchart | first9 = JC | title = HDL cholesterol, very low levels of LDL cholesterol, and cardiovascular events | volume = 357 | issue = 13 | pages = 1301–10 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa064278 | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | pmid = 21173414 | year = 2010 | last1 = Jafri | first1 = H | last2 = Alsheikh-Ali | first2 = AA | last3 = Karas | first3 = RH | title = Meta-analysis: Statin therapy does not alter the association between low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased cardiovascular risk | volume = 153 | issue = 12 | pages = 800–8 | doi = 10.1059/0003-4819-153-12-201012210-00006 | journal = Annals of internal medicine[/tpl] Other effects include anti-thrombotic and vascular inflammation, improving endothelial function, and plaque stability.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 20167660 | year = 2010 | last1 = Wu | first1 = BJ | last2 = Yan | first2 = L | last3 = Charlton | first3 = F | last4 = Witting | first4 = P | last5 = Barter | first5 = PJ | last6 = Rye | first6 = KA | title = Evidence that niacin inhibits acute vascular inflammation and improves endothelial dysfunction independent of changes in plasma lipids | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 968–75 | doi = 10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.201129 | journal = Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology[/tpl] Niacin alone[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 20079494 | year = 2010 | last1 = Bruckert | first1 = E | last2 = Labreuche | first2 = J | last3 = Amarenco | first3 = P | title = Meta-analysis of the effect of nicotinic acid alone or in combination on cardiovascular events and atherosclerosis | volume = 210 | issue = 2 | pages = 353–61 | doi = 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2009.12.023 | journal = Atherosclerosis[/tpl] or in combination with other lipid lowering agents such as statin[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 17076985 | year = 2006 | last1 = Taylor | first1 = AJ | last2 = Lee | first2 = HJ | last3 = Sullenberger | first3 = LE | title = The effect of 24 months of combination statin and extended-release niacin on carotid intima-media thickness: ARBITER 3 | volume = 22 | issue = 11 | pages = 2243–50 | doi = 10.1185/030079906X148508 | journal = Current medical research and opinion[/tpl] or ezetimibe[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 19915217 | year = 2009 | last1 = Taylor | first1 = AJ | last2 = Villines | first2 = TC | last3 = Stanek | first3 = EJ | last4 = Devine | first4 = PJ | last5 = Griffen | first5 = L | last6 = Miller | first6 = M | last7 = Weissman | first7 = NJ | last8 = Turco | first8 = M | title = Extended-release niacin or ezetimibe and carotid intima-media thickness | volume = 361 | issue = 22 | pages = 2113–22 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0907569 | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine[/tpl] significantly reduces risk of cardiovascular disease and arthrosclerosis progression.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 21944259 | year = 2011 | last1 = Lukasova | first1 = M | last2 = Hanson | first2 = J | last3 = Tunaru | first3 = S | last4 = Offermanns | first4 = S | title = Nicotinic acid (niacin): New lipid-independent mechanisms of action and therapeutic potentials | volume = 32 | issue = 12 | pages = 700–7 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2011.08.002 | journal = Trends in pharmacological sciences[/tpl]
Niacin therapeutic effect is mostly through its binding to G protein coupled receptors, niacin receptor 1 (NIACR1) and niacin receptor 2 (NIACR2), that are highly expressed in adipose tissue, spleen, immune cells and keratinocytes but not in other expected organs such as liver, kidney, heart or intestine.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 12646212 | year = 2003 | last1 = Soga | first1 = T | last2 = Kamohara | first2 = M | last3 = Takasaki | first3 = J | last4 = Matsumoto | first4 = S | last5 = Saito | first5 = T | last6 = Ohishi | first6 = T | last7 = Hiyama | first7 = H | last8 = Matsuo | first8 = A | last9 = Matsushime | first9 = H | title = Molecular identification of nicotinic acid receptor | volume = 303 | issue = 1 | pages = 364–9 | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | doi = 10.1016/S0006-291X(03)00342-5[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | pmid = 12522134 | year = 2003 | last1 = Wise | first1 = A | last2 = Foord | first2 = SM | last3 = Fraser | first3 = NJ | last4 = Barnes | first4 = AA | last5 = Elshourbagy | first5 = N | last6 = Eilert | first6 = M | last7 = Ignar | first7 = DM | last8 = Murdock | first8 = PR | last9 = Steplewski | first9 = K | title = Molecular identification of high and low affinity receptors for nicotinic acid | volume = 278 | issue = 11 | pages = 9869–74 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M210695200 | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry[/tpl]
NIACR1 inhibits cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and thus fat breakdown in adipose tissue and free fatty acids available for liver to produce triglycerides and  very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and consequently low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or "bad" cholesterol.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 17705685 | year = 2008 | last1 = Gille | first1 = A | last2 = Bodor | first2 = ET | last3 = Ahmed | first3 = K | last4 = Offermanns | first4 = S | title = Nicotinic acid: Pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action | volume = 48 | pages = 79–106 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.48.113006.094746 | journal = Annual review of pharmacology and toxicology[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | pmid = 21418500 | year = 2011 | last1 = Wanders | first1 = D | last2 = Judd | first2 = RL | title = Future of GPR109A agonists in the treatment of dyslipidaemia | volume = 13 | issue = 8 | pages = 685–91 | doi = 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2011.01400.x | journal = Diabetes, obesity & metabolism[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Gille A, Bodor ET, Ahmed K, Offermanns S |title=Nicotinic acid: pharmacological effects and mechanism of action |journal=Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol |volume=48 |pages=79–106 |year=2008|pmid=17705685 |doi=10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.48.113006.094746[/tpl] Decrease in free fatty acids also suppress hepatic expression of apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) and PPARg coactivator-1b (PGC-1b) thus increase VLDL turn over and reduce its production.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 20889132 | year = 2010 | last1 = Hernandez | first1 = C | last2 = Molusky | first2 = M | last3 = Li | first3 = Y | last4 = Li | first4 = S | last5 = Lin | first5 = JD | title = Regulation of hepatic ApoC3 expression by PGC-1β mediates hypolipidemic effect of nicotinic acid | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 411–9 | doi = 10.1016/j.cmet.2010.09.001 | pmc = 2950832 | journal = Cell metabolism[/tpl] It also inhibits diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 (important hepatic TG synthesis).
The mechanism behind increasing HDL is not totally understood but it seems to be done in various ways. Niacin increases apolipoprotein A1 levels due to anti catabolic effects resulting in higher reverse cholesterol transport. It also inhibits HDL hepatic uptake, down-regulating production of the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) gene. Finally, it stimulates ABCA1 transporter in monocytes and macrophages and up-regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ results in reverse cholesterol transport.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 15037193 | year = 2004 | last1 = Rubic | first1 = T | last2 = Trottmann | first2 = M | last3 = Lorenz | first3 = RL | title = Stimulation of CD36 and the key effector of reverse cholesterol transport ATP-binding cassette A1 in monocytoid cells by niacin | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 411–9 | doi = 10.1016/j.bcp.2003.09.014 | journal = Biochemical pharmacology[/tpl]
Improving vascular endothelial function has been reported in few experiments using niacin. In an experiment on type 2 diabetes, nicotinic acid improved endothelial function comparing with control. Daily dose of 1 g niacin shows significant lipid modifying properties and reach the plateau using 2 grams. NIACR1 in immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells is responsible for atherosclerosis effects of niacin by reducing the immune cells’ infiltration of vessel wall[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 21317532 | year = 2011 | last1 = Lukasova | first1 = M | last2 = Malaval | first2 = C | last3 = Gille | first3 = A | last4 = Kero | first4 = J | last5 = Offermanns | first5 = S | title = Nicotinic acid inhibits progression of atherosclerosis in mice through its receptor GPR109A expressed by immune cells | volume = 121 | issue = 3 | pages = 1163–73 | doi = 10.1172/JCI41651 | pmc = 3048854 | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | pmid = 21242806 | year = 2011 | last1 = Holzhäuser | first1 = E | last2 = Albrecht | first2 = C | last3 = Zhou | first3 = Q | last4 = Buttler | first4 = A | last5 = Preusch | first5 = MR | last6 = Blessing | first6 = E | last7 = Katus | first7 = HA | last8 = Bea | first8 = F | title = Nicotinic acid has anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties on advanced atherosclerotic lesions independent of its lipid-modifying capabilities | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 447–54 | doi = 10.1097/FJC.0b013e31820dc1db | journal = Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology[/tpl] It also down regulates endothelial adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) or of chemokines such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) and inflammatory proteins which results in atherosclerotic stabilization and antithrombotic effects. The changes in adhesion molecules and chemokines might be through activation of receptor NIACR1 on immune cells.
Adipokines are the adipocytes’ produced mediators. Some adipokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukins and chemokines, have pro-inflammatory effect and some others such as adiponectin have anti-inflammatory effect that regulates inflammatory process, decrease vascular progression and atherosclerosis.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 16458316 | year = 2006 | last1 = Benjó | first1 = AM | last2 = Maranhão | first2 = RC | last3 = Coimbra | first3 = SR | last4 = Andrade | first4 = AC | last5 = Favarato | first5 = D | last6 = Molina | first6 = MS | last7 = Brandizzi | first7 = LI | last8 = Da Luz | first8 = PL | title = Accumulation of chylomicron remnants and impaired vascular reactivity occur in subjects with isolated low HDL cholesterol: Effects of niacin treatment | volume = 187 | issue = 1 | pages = 116–22 | doi = 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2005.08.025 | journal = Atherosclerosis[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | pmid = 20124732 | year = 2010 | last1 = Gustafson | first1 = B | title = Adipose tissue, inflammation and atherosclerosis | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 332–41 | journal = Journal of atherosclerosis and thrombosis | doi = 10.5551/jat.3939[/tpl] Nicotinic acid increase adiponectin plasma levels in humans and mice[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 19141678 | year = 2009 | last1 = Plaisance | first1 = EP | last2 = Lukasova | first2 = M | last3 = Offermanns | first3 = S | last4 = Zhang | first4 = Y | last5 = Cao | first5 = G | last6 = Judd | first6 = RL | title = Niacin stimulates adiponectin secretion through the GPR109A receptor | volume = 296 | issue = 3 | pages = E549–58 | doi = 10.1152/ajpendo.91004.2008 | journal = American journal of physiology.

Following Coronary Drug Project (CDP), one of the first experiments done to study long term clinical lipid-lowering effect of niacin in the 1960s to early 1970’s,JAMA. (1975). "Clofibrate and niacin in coronary heart disease." JAMA 231(4)  360-381. many other experiments have been done.

By lowering VLDL levels, niacin also increases the level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or "good" cholesterol in blood, and therefore it is sometimes prescribed for people with low HDL, who are also at high risk of a heart attack.[tpl]cite journal |author=McGovern ME |title=Taking aim at HDL-C.

However, a 2011 study (AIM-HIGH) was halted early because patients showed no decrease in cardiovascular events, but did experience an increase in the risk of stroke. These patients already had LDL levels well controlled by a statin drug, and the aim of the study was to evaluate extended-release niacin (2000 mg per day) to see if raising HDL levels had an additional positive effect on risk. In this study, it did not have such an effect, and appeared to increase stroke risk.[tpl]cite pmid | 22085343[/tpl] The role of niacin in patients whose LDL is not well-controlled (as in the majority of previous studies with niacin) is still under study and debate. However, it does not seem to offer benefits via raising HDL, in patients already lowering LDL by taking a statin.

==Niacin prescriptions==

Many preparations of niacin are available over-the-counter as dietary supplements. Immediate release niacin is effective at lowering cholesterol levels, and has minimal hepatotoxic side effects due to its rapid elimination from the body. However, it has the main drawback of causing strong vasodilation side effects with sensations of flushing and skin tingling that can be unpleasant to many patients. Non-prescription extended release niacin, such as Endur-acin, which uses a wax matrix to delay release is available as well.Endur-Acin Oral : Uses, Side Effects, Interactions, Pictures, Warnings & Dosing - WebMDL-arginine, niacin, phytosterols, pantethine, calcium, vitamin c, b complex, cholesterol control without diet, 8 week cholesterol cure, linus pauling A prescription extended release niacin, Niaspan, has a film coating that delays release of the niacin, resulting in an absorption over a period of 8–12 hours. The extended release formulations generally reduce vasodilation and flushing side effects, but increase the risk of hepatotoxicity compared to the immediate release forms.Pharmacokinetics and dose recommendations of Niaspan® in chronic kidney disease and dialysis patientsNiaspan (Niacin) Drug Information: Description, User Reviews, Drug Side Effects, Interactions - Prescribing Information at RxListAbout NIASPAN® (niacin extended-release)

Over-the counter niacin dietary supplements generally lack the safety and efficacy data required for FDA regulatory approval.

==Toxicity==

Pharmacological doses of niacin (1.5 - 6 g per day) lead to side effects that can include dermatological conditions such as skin flushing and itching, dry skin, and skin rashes including eczema exacerbation and acanthosis nigricans. Some of these symptoms are generally related to niacin's role as the rate limiting cofactor in the histidine decarboxylase enzyme which converts l-histidine into histamine.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=histidine decarboxylase is B6-dependent, not B3-dependent|date=May 2011[/tpl] H1 and H2 receptor mediated histamine is metabolized via a sequence of mono (or di-) amine oxidase and COMT into methylhistamine which is then conjugated through the liver's CYP450 pathways. Persistent flushing and other symptoms may indicate deficiencies in one or more of the cofactors responsible for this enzymatic cascade. Gastrointestinal complaints, such as dyspepsia (indigestion), nausea and liver toxicity fulminant hepatic failure, have also been reported. Side effects of hyperglycemia, cardiac arrhythmias and "birth defects in experimental animals" have also been reported.[tpl]cite book |author=Keith Parker; Laurence Brunton; Goodman, Louis Sanford; Lazo, John S.; Gilman, Alfred |title=Goodman & Gilman's the pharmacological basis of therapeutics |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-07-142280-3 [/tpl]
Flushing usually lasts for about 15 to 30 minutes, though it can sometimes last up to two hours. It is sometimes accompanied by a prickly or itching sensation, in particular, in areas covered by clothing. Flushing is mediated by prostaglandin E2 and D2 due to GPR109A activation of epidermal Langerhans cells and keratinocytes.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 16322797 | year = 2005 | last1 = Benyó | first1 = Z | last2 = Gille | first2 = A | last3 = Kero | first3 = J | last4 = Csiky | first4 = M | last5 = Suchánková | first5 = MC | last6 = Nüsing | first6 = RM | last7 = Moers | first7 = A | last8 = Pfeffer | first8 = K | last9 = Offermanns | first9 = S | title = GPR109A (PUMA-G/HM74A) mediates nicotinic acid-induced flushing | volume = 115 | issue = 12 | pages = 3634–40 | doi = 10.1172/JCI23626 | pmc = 1297235 | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation| display-authors = 9 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | pmid = 17008386 | year = 2006 | last1 = Benyó | first1 = Z | last2 = Gille | first2 = A | last3 = Bennett | first3 = CL | last4 = Clausen | first4 = BE | last5 = Offermanns | first5 = S | title = Nicotinic acid-induced flushing is mediated by activation of epidermal langerhans cells | volume = 70 | issue = 6 | pages = 1844–9 | doi = 10.1124/mol.106.030833 | journal = Molecular Pharmacology[/tpl] Langerhans cells use cyclooxygenase type 1 (COX-1) for PGE2 production and are more responsible for acute flushing while keratinocytes are COX-2 dependent and are in active continued vaso-dilation.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 20664170 | year = 2010 | last1 = Hanson | first1 = J | last2 = Gille | first2 = A | last3 = Zwykiel | first3 = S | last4 = Lukasova | first4 = M | last5 = Clausen | first5 = BE | last6 = Ahmed | first6 = K | last7 = Tunaru | first7 = S | last8 = Wirth | first8 = A | last9 = Offermanns | first9 = S | title = Nicotinic acid- and monomethyl fumarate-induced flushing involves GPR109A expressed by keratinocytes and COX-2-dependent prostanoid formation in mice | volume = 120 | issue = 8 | pages = 2910–9 | doi = 10.1172/JCI42273 | pmc = 2912194 | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation| display-authors = 9 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | pmid = 17008871 | year = 2006 | last1 = Maciejewski-Lenoir | first1 = D | last2 = Richman | first2 = JG | last3 = Hakak | first3 = Y | last4 = Gaidarov | first4 = I | last5 = Behan | first5 = DP | last6 = Connolly | first6 = DT | title = Langerhans cells release prostaglandin D2 in response to nicotinic acid | volume = 126 | issue = 12 | pages = 2637–46 | doi = 10.1038/sj.jid.5700586 | journal = The Journal of investigative dermatology[/tpl] To reduce flushing many studies focused on altering or blocking the prostaglandin mediated pathway.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 18375237 | year = 2008 | last1 = Kamanna | first1 = VS | last2 = Kashyap | first2 = ML | title = Mechanism of action of niacin | volume = 101 | issue = 8A | pages = 20B–26B | doi = 10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.02.029 | journal = The American journal of cardiology[/tpl] This effect is mediated by GPR109A-mediated prostaglandin release from the Langerhans cells of the skin and can be blocked by taking 300 mg of aspirin half an hour before taking niacin, by taking one tablet of ibuprofen per day or by co-administering the prostaglandin receptor antagonist laropiprant. Taking the niacin with meals also helps reduce this side effect.

Hepatotoxicity is another side effect of niacin. This is possibly related to metabolism via amidation resulting in NAD production. The time-release form has a lower therapeutic index for lowering serum lipids relative to this form of toxicity.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1016/0002-9343(92)90018-7[/tpl]
Although high doses of niacin may elevate blood sugar, thereby worsening diabetes mellitus, recent studies show the actual effect on blood sugar to be only 5–10%. Patients with diabetes who continued to take anti-diabetes drugs containing niacin did not experience major blood glucose changes.

==Nicotinamide==

Nicotinamide may be obtained from the diet where it is present primarily as NAD+ and NADP+. These are hydrolysed in the intestine and the resulting nicotinamide is absorbed either as such, or following its hydrolysis to nicotinic acid. Nicotinamide is present in nature in only small amounts. In unprepared foods, niacin is present mainly in the form of the cellular pyridine nucleotides NAD and NADP. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the co-enzymes can occur during the course of food preparation. Boiling releases most of the total niacin present in sweet corn as nicotinamide (up to 55 mg/kg).[tpl]cite journal | journal = The EFSA Journal | year = 2009 | volume = 949 | pages = 1–20 | title = Inositol hexanicotinate (inositol hexaniacinate) as a source of niacin (vitamin B3) added for nutritional purposes in food supplements | author = F.

==Inositol hexanicotinate==

One form of dietary supplement is inositol hexanicotinate (IHN), which is inositol that has been esterified with niacin on all six of inositol's alcohol groups. IHN is usually sold as "flush-free" or "no-flush" niacin in units of 250, 500, or 1000 mg/tablets or capsules. It is sold as an over-the-counter formulation, and often is marketed and labeled as niacin, thus misleading consumers into thinking they are getting the active form of the medication.  While this form of niacin does not cause the flushing associated with the immediate-release products, the evidence that it has lipid-modifying functions is contradictory, at best. As the clinical trials date from the early 1960s (Dorner, Welsh) or the late 1970s (Ziliotto, Kruse, Agusti), it is difficult to assess them by today's standards.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/447528 | title = No-Flush Niacin for the Treatment of Hyperlipidemia | last = Taheri | first = R | publisher = Medscape | date = 2003-01-15 | accessdate = 2008-03-31[/tpl] One of the last of those studies affirmed the superiority of inositol and xantinol esters of nicotinic acid for reducing serum free fatty acid,[tpl]cite journal | author=Kruse W, Kruse W, Raetzer H, Heuck CC, Oster P, Schellenberg B, Schlierf G | title=Nocturnal inhibition of lipolysis in man by nicotinic acid and derivatives | journal=European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume=16 | issue=1 | year=1979 | pages=11–15  | pmid=499296 | doi=10.1007/BF00644960 [/tpl] but other studies conducted during the same period found no benefit.[tpl]cite journal | author=Meyers CD, Carr MC, Park S, Brunzell JD | title=Varying cost and free nicotinic acid content in over-the-counter niacin preparations for dyslipidemia | journal=Annals of Internal Medicine | volume=139 | issue=12 | year=2003 | pages=996–1002 | url = http://www.annals.org/content/139/12/996.full.pdf+html | pmid=14678919 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-139-12-200312160-00009 [/tpl] Studies explain that this is primarily because "flush-free" preparations do not contain any free nicotinic acid.  A more recent placebo-controlled trial was small (n=11/group), but results after three months at 1500 mg/day showed no trend for improvements in total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C or triglycerides.[tpl]cite journal | author=Benjó AM, Maranhão RC, Coimbra SR, Andrade AC, Favarato D, Molina MS, Brandizzi LI, da Luz PL | title=Accumulation of chylomicron remnants and impaired vascular reactivity occur in subjects with isolated low HDL cholesterol: effects of niacin treatment | journal=Atherosclerosis  | volume=187 | issue=1 | year=2006 | pages=116–122 | pmid=16458316 | doi=10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2005.08.025 [/tpl] Thus, so far there is not enough evidence to recommend IHN to treat dyslipidemia. Furthermore, the American Heart Association and the National Cholesterol Education Program both take the position that only prescription niacin should be used to treat dyslipidemias, and only under the management of a physician. The reason given is that niacin at effective intakes of 1500–3000 mg/day can also potentially have severe adverse effects. Thus liver function tests to monitor liver enzymes are necessary when taking therapeutic doses of niacin, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT).

==Biosynthesis and chemical synthesis==

The liver can synthesize niacin from the essential amino acid tryptophan, requiring 60 mg of tryptophan to make one mg of niacin.[tpl]cite web | url = http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/niacin/ | title = Niacin | publisher = Linus Pauling Institute | year = 2007 | last = Jacobson | first = EL | accessdate = 2008-03-31[/tpl]  The 5-membered aromatic heterocycle of tryptophan is cleaved and rearranged with the alpha amino group of tryptophan into the 6-membered aromatic heterocycle of niacin. Riboflavin, vitamin B6 and iron are required in some of the reactions involved in the conversion of tryptophan to NAD.
Several thousand tons of niacin are manufactured each year, starting from 3-methylpyridine.

==Food sources==

Niacin is found in variety of foods, including liver, chicken, beef, fish, cereal, peanuts and legumes, and is also synthesized from tryptophan, an essential amino acid found in most forms of protein.

Niacin was extracted from livers by biochemist Conrad Elvehjem in 1937, who later identified the active ingredient, then referred to as the "pellagra-preventing factor" and the "anti-blacktongue factor."[tpl]cite journal |author=Elvehjem CA, Madden RJ, Strongandd FM, Woolley DW |year=1938 |title=The isolation and identification of the anti-blacktongue factor J |journal = J.

When the biological significance of nicotinic acid was realized, it was thought appropriate to choose a name to dissociate it from nicotine, to avoid the perception that vitamins or niacin-rich food contains nicotine, or that cigarettes contain vitamins. The resulting name 'niacin' was derived from nicotinic acid + vitamin.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
