Oestrogens or estrogens (spellings in British English and American English usage respectively), are a group of compounds named for their importance in both menstrual and estrous reproductive cycles. They are the primary female sex hormones. Natural estrogens are steroid hormones, while some synthetic ones are non-steroidal[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]. The name comes from the Greek [tpl]lang|grc|οἶστρος[/tpl] (oistros), literally meaning "gadfly" but figuratively sexual passion or desire,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oistros&la=greek|title=Greek Word Study Tool: oistros|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|accessdate=2011-12-28[/tpl] and the suffix -gen, meaning "producer of".
Estrogens are synthesized in all vertebrates[tpl]cite journal | author = Ryan KJ | title = Biochemistry of aromatase: significance to female reproductive physiology | journal = Cancer Res. | volume = 42 | issue = 8 Suppl | pages = 3342s–3344s |date=August 1982 | pmid = 7083198 | url =  [/tpl] as well as some insects.[tpl]cite journal | author = Mechoulam R, Brueggemeier RW, Denlinger DL | title = Estrogens in insects | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences |date=September 2025 | volume = 40 | issue = 9 | pages = 942–944|doi=10.1007/BF01946450 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/tr77034552r222m1/fulltext.pdf[/tpl] Their presence in both vertebrates and insects suggests that estrogenic sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history.
Estrogens are used as part of some oral contraceptives, in estrogen replacement therapy for postmenopausal women, and in hormone replacement therapy for trans women.
Like all steroid hormones, estrogens readily diffuse across the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, they bind to and activate estrogen receptors which in turn modulate the expression of many genes.[tpl]cite book | author = Whitehead SA,  Nussey S | editor = | others = | title = Endocrinology: an integrated approach | edition = | publisher = BIOS: Taylor & Francis | location = Oxford | year = 2001 | origyear = | quote = | isbn = 1-85996-252-1 | oclc = | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=endocrin.TOC&depth=10 [/tpl]  Additionally, estrogens have been shown to activate a G protein-coupled receptor, GPR30.[tpl]cite journal | author = Prossnitz ER, Arterburn JB, Sklar LA | title = GPR30: A G protein-coupled receptor for estrogen | journal = Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. | volume = 265–266 | pages = 138–42 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17222505 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2006.12.010 | pmc = 1847610 [/tpl]

==Types==

===Steroidal===

The three major naturally occurring estrogens in women are estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3). Estradiol  is the predominant estrogen during reproductive years both in terms of absolute serum levels as well as in terms of estrogenic activity.  During menopause, estrone is the predominant circulating estrogen and during pregnancy estriol is the predominant circulating estrogen in terms of serum levels.  Though estriol is the most plentiful of the three estrogens it is also the weakest, whereas estradiol is the strongest with a potency of approximately 80 times that of estriol.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] Thus, estradiol is the most important estrogen in non-pregnant females who are between the menarche and menopause stages of life. However, during pregnancy this role shifts to estriol, and in postmenopausal women estrone becomes the primary form of estrogen in the body. Another type of estrogen called estetrol (E4) is produced only during pregnancy. All of the different forms of estrogen are synthesized from androgens, specifically testosterone and androstenedione, by the enzyme aromatase.
Premarin, a commonly prescribed estrogenic drug produced from the urine of pregnant mares, contains the steroidal estrogens equilin and equilenin. There are estradiol skin patches such as Estraderm (the original brand, introduced in the late 1980s) that offer a completely natural alternative.

===Nonsteroidal===

A range of synthetic and natural substances have been identified that also possess estrogenic activity.[tpl]cite journal | author = Fang H, Tong W, Shi LM, Blair R, Perkins R, Branham W, Hass BS, Xie Q, Dial SL, Moland CL, Sheehan DM | title = Structure-activity relationships for a large diverse set of natural, synthetic, and environmental estrogens | journal = Chem. Res. Toxicol. | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 280–94 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11258977 | doi = 10.1021/tx000208y [/tpl]
Unlike estrogens produced by mammals, these substances are not necessarily steroids.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]

===Type in common reference===

Although scientifically there are various estrogens, the word "estrogen" in typical general conversation is usually used in the singular (making it sound as if there were only one kind of estrogen). Such usage refers specifically to the steroidal estrogen estradiol (E2). This is analogous to how "alcohol" in general conversation refers specifically (although implicitly) to ethanol. This explains why "estrogen" is generally said to have its highest levels in females of reproductive age, which is true of estradiol (E2), as explained above, although not of all other estrogens.

==Biosynthesis==

Estrogens, in females, are produced primarily by the ovaries, and during pregnancy, the placenta. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the ovarian production of estrogens by the granulosa cells of the ovarian follicles and corpora lutea. Some estrogens are also produced in smaller amounts by other tissues such as the liver, adrenal glands, and the breasts. These secondary sources of estrogens are especially important in postmenopausal women. Fat cells produce estrogen as well.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nelson LR, Bulun SE |title=Estrogen production and action |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=45 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=S116–24 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11511861 |doi= 10.1067/mjd.2001.117432[/tpl]
In females, synthesis of estrogens starts in theca interna cells in the ovary, by the synthesis of androstenedione from cholesterol. Androstenedione is a substance of weak androgenic activity which serves predominantly as a precursor for more potent androgens such as testosterone as well as estrogen. This compound crosses the basal membrane into the surrounding granulosa cells, where it is converted either immediately into estrone, or into testosterone and then estradiol in an additional step. The conversion of androstenedione to testosterone is catalyzed by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD), whereas the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone into estrone and estradiol, respectively is catalyzed by aromatase, enzymes which are both expressed in granulosa cells. In contrast, granulosa cells lack 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, whereas theca cells express these enzymes and 17β-HSD but lack aromatase. Hence, both granulosa and theca cells are essential for the production of estrogen in the ovaries.
Estrogen levels vary through the menstrual cycle, with levels highest near the end of the follicular phase just before ovulation.

==Function==

The actions of estrogen are mediated by the estrogen receptor (ER), a dimeric nuclear protein that binds to DNA and controls gene expression. Like other steroid hormones, estrogen enters passively into the cell where it binds to and activates the estrogen receptor. The estrogen:ER complex binds to specific DNA sequences called a hormone response element to activate the transcription of target genes (in a study using an estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell line as model, 89 such genes were identified).[tpl]cite journal | author = Lin CY, Ström A, Vega VB, Kong SL, Yeo AL, Thomsen JS, Chan WC, Doray B, Bangarusamy DK, Ramasamy A, Vergara LA, Tang S, Chong A, Bajic VB, Miller LD, Gustafsson JA, Liu ET | title = Discovery of estrogen receptor alpha target genes and response elements in breast tumor cells | journal = Genome Biol. | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = R66 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15345050 | pmc = 522873 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2004-5-9-r66 [/tpl] Since estrogen enters all cells, its actions are dependent on the presence of the ER in the cell. The ER is expressed in specific tissues including the ovary, uterus and breast.
While estrogens are present in both men and women, they are usually present at significantly higher levels in women of reproductive age. They promote the development of female secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts, and are also involved in the thickening of the endometrium and other aspects of regulating the menstrual cycle. In males, estrogen regulates certain functions of the reproductive system important to the maturation of sperm[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc97/12_6_97/fob1.htm | title = Science News Online (12/6/97): Estrogen's Emerging Manly Alter Ego | accessdate = 2008-03-04 | author = J.

===Fetal development===

In rodents, estrogens (which are locally aromatized from androgens in the brain) play an important role in psychosexual differentiation, for example, by masculinizing territorial behavior;[tpl]cite journal | author = Wu MV, Manoli DS, Fraser EJ, Coats JK, Tollkuhn J, Honda S, Harada N, Shah NM | title = Estrogen masculinizes neural pathways and sex-specific behaviors | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–72 |date=October 2009 | pmid = 19804754 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.036 | url = | pmc = 2851224 [/tpl] the same is not true in humans.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rochira V, Carani C | title = Aromatase deficiency in men: a clinical perspective | journal = Nature Reviews Endocrinology  | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = 559–68 |date=October 2009 | pmid = 19707181 | doi = 10.1038/nrendo.2009.176 | url =  [/tpl] In humans, the masculinizing effects of prenatal androgens on behavior (and other tissues, with the possible exception of effects on bone) appear to act exclusively through the androgen receptor.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wilson JD | title = Androgens, androgen receptors, and male gender role behavior | journal = Horm Behav | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 358–66 |date=September 2001 | pmid = 11534997 | doi = 10.1006/hbeh.2001.1684 | url =  [/tpl]  Consequently, the utility of rodent models for studying human psychosexual differentiation has been questioned.[tpl]cite journal | author = Baum MJ | title = Mammalian animal models of psychosexual differentiation: when is 'translation' to the human situation possible? | journal = Horm Behav | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 579–88 |date=November 2006 | pmid = 16876166 | doi = 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.06.003 | url =  [/tpl]

===Estrogen and heart disease===

Women suffer less from heart disease due to vasculo-protective action  
of oestrogen which helps in preventing atherosclerosis.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rosano GM, Panina G | title = Oestrogens and the heart | journal = Therapie | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 381–5 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10500455 | doi =  [/tpl] It also helps in maintaining the delicate balance between fighting infections and protecting arteries from damage thus lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease.[tpl]cite journal | author = Nadkarni S, Cooper D, Brancaleone V, Bena S, Perretti M | title = Activation of the annexin A1 pathway underlies the protective effects exerted by estrogen in polymorphonuclear leukocytes | journal = Arterioscler.

===Immunological role===

Oestrogen has anti-inflammatory properties and helps in mobilization of polymorphonuclear white blood cells or neutrophils.

===Mental health===

Estrogen is considered to play a significant role in women’s mental health.  Sudden estrogen withdrawal, fluctuating estrogen, and periods of sustained estrogen low levels correlate with significant mood lowering.  Clinical recovery from postpartum, perimenopause, and postmenopause depression has been shown to be effective after levels of estrogen were stabilized and/or restored.[tpl]cite journal | author = Douma SL, Husband C, O'Donnell ME, Barwin BN, Woodend AK | title = Estrogen-related mood disorders: reproductive life cycle factors | journal = Advances in Nursing Science | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 364–75 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16292022 | doi =10.1097/00012272-200510000-00008 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Lasiuk GC, Hegadoren KM | title = The effects of estradiol on central serotonergic systems and its relationship to mood in women | journal = Biol Res Nurs | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–60 |date=October 2007 | pmid = 17909167 | doi = 10.1177/1099800407305600 [/tpl]
Compulsions in male lab mice, such as those in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), may be caused by low estrogen levels. When estrogen levels were raised through the increased activity of the enzyme aromatase in male lab mice, OCD rituals were dramatically decreased. Hypothalamic protein levels in the gene COMT are enhanced by increasing estrogen levels which is believed to return mice that displayed OCD rituals to normal activity. Aromatase deficiency is ultimately suspected which is involved in the synthesis of estrogen in humans and has therapeutic implications in humans having obsessive-compulsive disorder.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hill RA, McInnes KJ, Gong EC, Jones ME, Simpson ER, Boon WC | title = Estrogen deficient male mice develop compulsive behavior | journal = Biol.

Local application of estrogen in the rat hippocampus has been shown to inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin. Contrarily, local application of estrogen has been shown to block the ability of fluvoxamine to slow serotonin clearance, suggesting that the same pathways which are involved in SSRI efficacy may also be affected by components of local estrogen signaling pathways.[tpl]cite journal | author = Benmansour S, Weaver RS, Barton AK, Adeniji OS, Frazer A | title = Comparison of the effects of estradiol and progesterone on serotonergic function | journal = Biol.

==Medical applications==

===Oral contraceptives===

Since estrogen circulating in the blood can negatively feed-back to reduce circulating levels of FSH and LH, most oral contraceptives contain a synthetic estrogen, along with a synthetic progestin.  Even in men, the major hormone involved in LH feedback is estradiol, not testosterone.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]

===Hormone replacement therapy===

Estrogen and other hormones are given to postmenopausal women in order to prevent osteoporosis as well as treat the symptoms of menopause such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness, urinary stress incontinence, chilly sensations, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, and sweating.  Fractures of the spine, wrist, and hips decrease by 50–70% and spinal bone density increases by ~5% in those women treated with estrogen within 3 years of the onset of menopause and for 5–10 years thereafter.
Before the specific dangers of conjugated equine estrogens were well understood, standard therapy was 0.625 mg/day of conjugated equine estrogens (such as Premarin). There are, however, risks associated with conjugated equine estrogen therapy.  Among the older postmenopausal women studied as part of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), an orally administered conjugated equine estrogen supplement was found to be associated with an increased risk of dangerous blood clotting. The WHI studies used one type of estrogen supplement, a high oral dose of conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin alone and with medroxyprogesterone acetate as PremPro).[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nih.gov/PHTindex.htm | title = NIH – Menopausal Hormone Therapy Information | accessdate = 2008-03-04 | date = August 27, 2007 | publisher = National Institutes of Health | quote = [/tpl]
In a study by the NIH, esterified estrogens were not proven to pose the same risks to health as conjugated equine estrogens.  Hormone replacement therapy has favorable effects on serum cholesterol levels, and when initiated immediately upon menopause may reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease, although this hypothesis has yet to be tested in randomized trials. Estrogen appears to have a protector effect on atherosclerosis: it lowers LDL and triglycerides, it raises HDL levels and has endothelial vasodilatation properties plus an anti-inflammatory component.
Research is underway to determine if risks of estrogen supplement use are the same for all methods of delivery. In particular, estrogen applied topically may have a different spectrum of side-effects than when administered orally,[tpl]cite journal | author = Menon DV, Vongpatanasin W | title = Effects of transdermal estrogen replacement therapy on cardiovascular risk factors | journal = Treat Endocrinol | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–51 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16396517| doi = 10.2165/00024677-200605010-00005  [/tpl] and transdermal estrogens do not affect clotting as they are absorbed directly into the systemic circulation, avoiding first-pass metabolism in the liver. This route of administration is thus preferred in women with a history of thrombo-embolic disease.
Estrogen is also used in the therapy of vaginal atrophy, hypoestrogenism (as a result of hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure), amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and oligomenorrhea.  Estrogens can also be used to suppress lactation after child birth.

===Breast cancer===

About 80% of breast cancers, once established, rely on supplies of the hormone estrogen to grow: they are known as hormone-sensitive or hormone-receptor-positive cancers. Suppression of production of estrogen in the body is a treatment for these cancers.
Recently researchers have discovered that the common table mushroom has anti-aromatase properties and therefore possible anti-estrogen activity.  Clinical trials have begun in the United States looking into whether the table mushroom can prevent breast cancer in people.[tpl]cite journal |title=A salad fixin' with medical benefits? |first=Alicia |last=Di Rado |publisher=City of Hope National Medical Center |journal=EHope |date=July 2008 |volume=7 |issue=7[/tpl]  A recent study has highlighted the importance of this research.  In 2009, a case-control study of the eating habits of 2,018 women revealed that women  who consumed mushrooms had an approximately 50% lower incidence of breast cancer.  It has been found that Chinese women who consumed mushrooms and green tea had a 90% lower incidence of breast cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Zhang M, Huang J, Xie X, Holman CD | title = Dietary intakes of mushrooms and green tea combine to reduce the risk of breast cancer in Chinese women | journal = Int.

The labeling of estrogen-only products in the U.S. includes a boxed warning that unopposed estrogen (without progestogen) therapy increases the risk of endometrial cancer. Based on a review of data from the WHI, on January 8, 2003 the FDA changed the labeling of all estrogen and estrogen with progestin products for use by postmenopausal women to include a new boxed warning about cardiovascular and other risks.

==Cosmetics==

Some hair shampoos on the market include estrogens and placental extracts; others contain phytoestrogens. There are case reports of young children developing breasts after exposure to these shampoos.[tpl]Cite news  | author = Sanghavi DM  | title=Preschool Puberty, and a Search for the Causes  | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 2006-10-17  | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/science/17puberty.html |accessdate=2008-06-04 [/tpl]
On September 9, 1993, the FDA determined that not all topically applied hormone-containing drug products for OTC human use are generally recognized as safe and effective and are misbranded. An accompanying proposed rule deals with cosmetics, concluding that any use of natural estrogens in a cosmetic product makes the product an unapproved new drug and that any cosmetic using the term "hormone" in the text of its labeling or in its ingredient statement makes an implied drug claim, subjecting such a product to regulatory action.[tpl]cite web |author=FDA | date=February 1995 |title=Products containing estrogenic hormones, placental extract or vitamins |work=Guide to Inspections of Cosmetic Product Manufacturers |url=http://www.fda.gov/ora/inspect_ref/igs/cosmet.html  |accessdate=2006-10-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014014542/http://www.fda.gov/ora/inspect_ref/igs/cosmet.html |archivedate = October 14, 2007[/tpl]
In addition to being considered misbranded drugs, products claiming to contain placental extract may also be deemed to be misbranded cosmetics if the extract has been prepared from placentas from which the hormones and other biologically active substances have been removed and the extracted substance consists principally of protein. The FDA recommends that this substance be identified by a name other than "placental extract" and describing its composition more accurately because consumers associate the name "placental extract" with a therapeutic use of some biological activity.

==History==

In 1929 Adolf Butenandt and Edward Adelbert Doisy independently isolated and determined the structure of estrogen.[tpl]cite journal | author = Tata JR | title = One hundred years of hormones | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 490–6 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15940278 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400444 | pmc = 1369102 [/tpl] Thereafter, the market for hormonal drug research opened up.
The "first orally effective estrogen", Emmenin, derived from the late-pregnancy urine of Canadian women, was introduced in 1930 by Collip and Ayerst Laboratories.  Estrogens are not water-soluble and cannot be given orally, but the urine was found to contain estriol glucuronide which is water soluble and becomes active in the body after hydrolysis.
Scientists continued to search for new sources of estrogen because of concerns associated with the practicality of introducing the drug into the market. At the same time, a German pharmaceutical drug company, formulated a similar product as Emmenin that was introduced to German women to treat menopausal symptoms.
In 1938, British scientists obtained a patent on a newly formulated nonsteroidal estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES), that was cheaper and more powerful than the previously manufactured estrogens. Soon after, concerns over the side effects of DES were raised in scientific journals while the drug manufacturers came together to lobby for governmental approval of DES. It was only until 1941 when estrogen therapy was finally approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of menopausal symptoms.[tpl]cite web | author=Rothenberg, Carla J. | title= The Rise and Fall of Estrogen Therapy: The History of HRT |date=April 25, 2005 | url= http://leda.law.harvard.edu/leda/data/711/Rothenberg05.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2006-10-27 [/tpl]

==Environmental effects==

Estrogens are among the wide range of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) because they have high estrogenic potency. When this specific EDC makes its way into the environment it may cause male reproductive dysfunction to wildlife.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wang S, Huang W, Fang G, Zhang Y, Qiao H | title=Analysis of steroidal estrogen residues in food and environmental samples | journal = International Journal of Environmental Analytical Chemistry | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–25 | doi =10.1080/03067310701597293 | year = 2008 [/tpl] The estrogen excreted from farm animals makes its way into fresh water systems.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wise A, O'Brien K, Woodruff T | title = Are Oral Contraceptives a Significant Contributor to the Estrogenicity of Drinking Water? | journal = Environ Sci Technol | volume = 45| issue = 1 | pages = 51–60 |date=October 2011 | pmid = 20977246 | doi = 10.1021/es1014482 | laysummary = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/88/i44/8844news4.html | laysource =  Chemical & Engineering News [/tpl] During the germination period of reproduction the fish are exposed to low levels  of estrogen which may cause reproductive dysfunction to male fish.[tpl]cite journal | author = Liney KE, Jobling S, Shears JA, Simpson P, Tyler CR | title = Assessing the sensitivity of different life stages for sexual disruption in roach (Rutilus rutilus) exposed to effluents from wastewater treatment works | journal = Environ.
