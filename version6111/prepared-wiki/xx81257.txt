[tpl]nihongo|Slippy Toad|スリッピー・トード|Surippī Tōdo|lead=yes[/tpl] is a player character in the Star Fox series of video games published by Nintendo. He was created by Shigeru Miyamoto along with Takaya Imamura, who also designed the character, and was based on the assistant director of the original Star Fox game. Slippy acts as the inventor and mechanic of Star Fox Team as well as the sidekick to Fox McCloud and Falco Lombardi.
Slippy first appeared in the 1993 game Star Fox. Since then, he has appeared in multiple Star Fox games. Reception to the character has been generally negative, with video game reviewers criticizing mainly his voice and appearance, which led Slippy to be included in several lists of the most annoying video game characters. On other hand, he was praised for being a "cute character".

==Creation and design==

The name "Slippy" in his name is a colloquial name to "Slippery" that was chose by Dylan Cuthbert in order to represente his "clumsy nature".[tpl]cite journal|title=スターフォックス64 3D 開発スタッフインタビュー Fox 64 3D development staff interview|journal=Nintendo Dream|issue=209|date=September 2011|page=12-19|publisher=Tokuma Shoten[/tpl] The original four members of the Star Fox Team are based on the staff for the first game. Slippy in particular is based on the assistant director, Yamada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=154567&site=ngm|title=Star Fox Command interview|last=Cuthbert|first=Dylan|coauthors=NGamer staff|date=January 11, 2007|work=NGamer|publisher=Future plc|accessdate=July 30, 2013[/tpl]

==Appearances==

Slippy's debut was in the 1993 Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) action game Star Fox. After antagonist Andross launches an attack against the planet Corneria, the Star Fox team resolves to stop him. Slippy's design is that of an anthropomorphic green frog (despite his name). He is a member of the Star Fox team of mercenaries. However, as Slippy is relatively unskilled at flying, he is instead serving as the "brains" of the team, developing weapons,[tpl]cite web|title=Slippy Toad Profile|url=http://stars.ign.com/objects/960/960451.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=May 12, 2010[/tpl] and performing mechanic work. Slippy serves as a sidekick to skilled teammates Fox McCloud and Falco Lombardi.[tpl]cite web|title=Slippy Toad Biography|url=http://stars.ign.com/objects/960/960451_biography.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=May 12, 2010[/tpl] He designed the "blaster" and "reflector" weapons that they use.
Slippy makes a cameo in the Gamecube fighting game Super Smash Bros. Melee and in the 2008 Wii fighting game Super Smash Bros. Brawl in the "Shadow Moses Island" stage, conversing with Solid Snake about Falco if that character is selected.[tpl]cite video game|title=Super Smash Bros.

Just thought I'd hop on the wireless and give you a holler. Don't get mad! / Snake: Hacked right into my channel, huh... / Slippy: But I'm not there to mess nothin' up. Don't worry. / Snake: (groans) ... / Slippy: Just so ya know, Falco uses a Blaster and Reflector that I designed, just like Fox does. But Falco will kick his Reflector and send it flyin' around. Just showin' off, if you ask me. / Snake: No reason a weapon can't have more than one use. In fact, I'd say it's versatility shows how well you designed it. / Slippy: Hey, maybe so! I feel all fuzzy now! Thanks, Snake! /Snake: Maybe next time we meet, you can design me a weapon...[/tpl] He also appears on the Lylat Cruise stage conversing with Star Fox and Star Wolf.

==Reception==

Critical opinion of Slippy has been generally negative; criticism has been leveled primarily at his voice. An article from IGN calls Slippy "an annoying croaking pest", also noting his "high-pitched cries for help". In an April Fools article IGN's Levi Buchanan epithetized his voice as "the sound of the earth cracking open just as the four horsemen visit plague and pestilence on humankind."[tpl]cite web|title=Bottom 10 SNES Games|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/863/863612p1.html|publisher=IGN|date=April 1, 2008|last=Buchanan|first=Levi|accessdate=May 12, 2010[/tpl] GameSpot writer Glenn Rubenstein noted the excessive use of voice acting in Star Fox 64, highlighting Slippy's voice as androgynous.[tpl]cite web|title=Star Fox 64 Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/n64/action/starfox64/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary%3Bread-review|last=Rubenstein|first=Glenn|publisher=GameSpot|date=May 1, 1997|accessdate=May 12, 2010[/tpl] GameDaily also listed him as a character that make people want to mute their games, commenting that "until Star Fix 64 sic arrived, we liked amphibians."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/characters-that-make-you-hit-mute/?page=7 | title=Characters that Make You Hit Mute | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090510064300/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/characters-that-make-you-hit-mute/?page=7 | archivedate=May 10, 2009 | publisher=GameDaily | accessdate=July 27, 2013[/tpl] 
Slippy has also been criticized for his inadequacy as a pilot; IGN stated that "he can never seem to help himself out of any kind of tight situation." The IGN team and Colin Moriarty ranked him third on their list of ten video game characters who should die, rationalizing that "we can't decide what makes him more annoying: his inadequacy in the cockpit or his ear-splitting voice."[tpl]cite web|title=Wednesday 10: Videogame Characters That Should Die|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/955/955086p1.html|publisher=IGN|author=IGN PlayStation Team; Moriarty, Colin|accessdate=May 12, 2010[/tpl] Slippy was ranked as the sixth video game sidekicks that GamesRadar's staff most hated, while 1UP.com placed him second in a similar list, criticizing the fact that he doesn't bring any special quality to the Star Fox's cast.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gamesradar.com/top-7-video-game-sidekicks-we-hated/ | title=The Top 7… Video game sidekicks we hated | date=April 15, 2013 | publisher=GamesRadar | accessdate=July 27, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/features/top-5-worst-videogame-sidekicks | title=Top 5 Worst Videogame Sidekicks | author=Mackey, Bob | publisher=1UP.com | accessdate=July 29, 2013[/tpl] Cheat Code Central included in their "Top 10 Lamest Video Game Characters".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cheatcc.com/extra/toptenlamestvideogamecharacters.html | title=Top 10 Lamest Video Game Characters | author=M.
