</ref> This practice is denounced by some critics, who argue that users should be able to study and change the software they use, for example, to remove secret or malicious features, or look for security vulnerabilities. Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, says that proprietary software commonly contains "malicious features, such as spying on the users, restricting the users, back doors, and imposed upgrades."<ref>[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html Why Open Source Misses the Point of Free Software - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation].

While most proprietary software is closed-source, some vendors distribute the source code or otherwise make it available to customers. For example, users who have purchased a license for the Internet forum software vBulletin can modify the source for his or her own site but cannot redistribute it. This is true for many web applications, which must be in source code form when being run by a web server. The source code is covered by a non-disclosure agreement or a license that allows, for example, study and modification, but not redistribution.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] The text-based email client Pine and certain implementations of Secure Shell are distributed with proprietary licenses that make the source code available.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
Some governments fear that proprietary software may include defects or malicious features which would compromise sensitive information. In 2003 Microsoft established a Government Security Program (GSP) to allow governments to view source code and Microsoft security documentation, of which the Chinese government was an early participant.[tpl]cite web|last=Shankland|first=Stephen|title=Governments to see Windows code|url=http://news.cnet.com/Governments-to-see-Windows-code/2100-1006_3-980666.html|publisher=CNET[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Gao|first=Ken|title=China to view Windows code|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1007-990526.html|publisher=CNET[/tpl] The program is part of Microsoft's broader Shared Source Initiative which provides source code access for some products. The Reference Source License (Ms-RSL) and Limited Public License (Ms-LPL) are proprietary software licenses where the source code is made available.
Governments have also been accused of adding such malware to software themselves. According to documents released by Edward Snowden, the NSA has used covert partnerships with software companies to make commercial encryption software exploitable to eavesdropping, or to insert backdoors.[tpl]cite news | title=US and UK spy agencies defeat privacy and security on the internet | author=James Ball, Julian Borger and Glenn Greenwald | date=2013-09-06 | publisher=The Guardian | url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title=How to remain secure against NSA surveillance | author=Bruce Schneier | date=2013-09-06 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-how-to-remain-secure-surveillance | publisher=The Guardian[/tpl]
Software vendors sometimes use obfuscated code to impede users who would reverse engineer the software.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] This is particularly common with certain programming languages.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] For example, the bytecode for programs written in Java can be easily decompiled to somewhat usable code,[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] and the source code for programs written in scripting languages such as PHP or JavaScript is available at run time.[ref]

===Redistribution===

Proprietary software vendors can prohibit users from sharing the software with others. Another unique license is required for another party to use the software.
In the case of proprietary software with source code available, the vendor may also prohibit customers from distributing their modifications to the source code.
Shareware is closed-source software whose owner encourages redistribution at no cost, but which the user sometimes must pay to use after a trial period. The fee usually allows use by a single user or computer. In some cases, software features are restricted during or after the trial period, a practice sometimes called crippleware.

==Interoperability with software and hardware==

===Proprietary file formats and protocols===

Proprietary software often[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] stores some of its data in file formats which are incompatible with other software, and may also communicate using protocols which are incompatible. Such formats and protocols may be restricted as trade secrets or subject to patents.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]

===Proprietary APIs===

A proprietary application programming interface (API) is a software library interface "specific to one device or, more likely to a number of devices within a particular manufacturer's product range."APIs: What they are, and what they're for - Feature - Techworld.com. Features.techworld.com. Retrieved on 2013-06-16.  The motivation for using a proprietary API can be vendor lock-in or because standard APIs do not support the device's functionality.

Early versions of the iPhone SDK were covered by a non-disclosure agreement. The agreement forbade independent developers from discussing the content of the interfaces. Apple discontinued the NDA in October 2008.

===Vendor lock-in===

A dependency on the future versions and upgrades for a proprietary software package can create vendor lock-in, entrenching a monopoly position.[ref]
</ref>

===Software limited to certain hardware configurations===

Proprietary software may also have licensing terms that limit the usage of that software to a specific set of hardware. Apple has such a licensing model for Mac OS X, an operating system which is limited to Apple hardware, both by licensing and various design decisions. This licensing model has been affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals.[ref]
</ref>

==Abandonment by owners==

Proprietary software which is no longer marketed by its owner and is used without permission by users is called abandonware and may include source code.  Some abandonware have the source code released to the public domain either by its author or copyright holder and is therefore free software, and no longer proprietary software.
If the proprietor of a software package should cease to exist, or decide to cease or limit production or support for a proprietary software package, recipients and users of the package may have no recourse if problems are found with the software.  Proprietors can fail to improve and support software because of business problems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/32277|title=What happens when a proprietary software company dies?|date=October 2003|publisher=NewsForge|accessdate=2007-03-05[/tpl]  When no other vendor can provide support for the software, the ending of support for older or existing versions of a software package may be done to force users to upgrade and pay for newer versions; or migrate to either competing systems with longer support life cycles or to FOSS-based systems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=GL4O5EZFOXYJGQSNDLPSKH0CJUNN2JVN?articleID=196700071|title=Microsoft Turns Up The Heat On Windows 2000 Users|date=December 2006|publisher=InformationWeek|accessdate=2008-09-16[/tpl]

==Pricing and economics==
