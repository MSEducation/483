[[Full-spectrum dominance]]

CATEGORIES: United States Department of Defense doctrine

Full-spectrum dominance is a military entity's achievement of control over all dimensions of the battlespace, effectively possessing an overwhelming diversity of resources in such areas as terrestrial, aerial, maritime, subterranean, extraterrestrial, psychological, and bio- or cyber-technological warfare. 
Full spectrum dominance includes the physical battlespace; air, surface and sub-surface as well as the electromagnetic spectrum and information space.  Control implies that freedom of opposition force assets to exploit the battlespace is wholly constrained.

==US military doctrine==

Officially known as full-spectrum superiority and defined by the U.S. military as:
The United States military's doctrine has espoused a strategic intent to be capable of achieving this state in a conflict, either alone or with alliesJoint Vision 2020, U.S. Department of Defense by defeating any adversary and controlling any situation across the range of military operations.
The stated intent implies significant investment in a range of capabilities; dominant maneuver, precision engagement, focused logistics, and full-dimensional protection.

==Criticism==

As early as 2005, the credibility of full-spectrum dominance as a practical strategic doctrine was dismissed by Professor Philip Taylor of the University of Leeds[tpl]ite web | title=Government Executive Magazine: | url=http://www.govexec.com/features/1205-01/1205-01s5.htm[/tpl] an expert consultant to the US and UK governments on psychological operations, propaganda and diplomacy.
 "It's true, though rarely recognized in the control-freakery world of the military, that full spectrum dominance is impossible in the global information environment."
