Matthew Boyce (born 13 August 1985 in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire) is an English cricketer. He is currently playing for Leicestershire, primarily as an opening batsman. Like his near contemporary, Stuart Broad, he was educated at Oakham School.

==Cricket career==

Boyce achieved a unique feat on 23 June 2010 by winning a man of the match award, despite only appearing as a substitute. Will Jefferson had batted for the Leicestershire Foxes in their Friends Provident t20 North Group match against the Warwickshire Bears at Edgbaston, but suffered an Achilles problem resulting in Boyce taking to the field, instead. Neil Carter, Jim Troughton and Tim Ambrose were all ran out by Boyce, as he helped the Foxes to win by 32 runs. After the match, Boyce was named man of the match, and he took part in the presentation ceremony with Paul Allott.http://www.leicestershireccc.co.uk/lc/News/Brilliant-Boyce-grabs-unique-treble
He was also instrumental with his fielding in the 2011 Twenty20 Final at Edgbaston against Somerset, where on as a substitute he took 4 catches on the midwicket boundary of the bowling of Josh Cobb.
He has acted as captain for Leicestershire.

==Charity work==

After the 2012 season finished, Boyce set out on a walk from John o' Groats to Land's End (the length of Great Britain) to raise money and promote awareness for Mind, the mental health charity. He was inspired to raise awareness of depression after the suicides of sportsmen Gary Speed and Peter Roebuck and, although not suffering himself, he was frustrated by the lack of understanding people have of how depression can impact on people from all walks of life. He completed the walk in early December and raised just over Â£18,000.[tpl]Citation  | title = Matt Boyce Walks for Mind  | work = Matt Boyce Blog Site  | url = http://www.mattboycecharitywalk.co.uk/#  | accessdate =27 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]Citation  | title = Matthew Boyce's fundraising page  | work = Virgin Money Giving  | url = http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-web/fundraiser/showFundraiserProfilePage.action?userUrl=MatthewBoyce1  | accessdate =27 June 2013[/tpl]
