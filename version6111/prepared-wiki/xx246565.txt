==Song content==

The song talks of a wife who grows tired of her husband's barhopping (and spending his entire paycheck doing so).
But instead of ending the marriage, she comes up with a unique plan â€“ she decides to redecorate their house into a bar, and play the part of bartender/waitress as an inducement to get her husband to stay at home (and possibly bring his friends along with him, so they can spend their paychecks).  While he recovers from his hangover the following morning, she will deposit the proceeds in their bank account.
