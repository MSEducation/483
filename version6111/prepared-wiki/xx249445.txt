==History==

Sri Lankan Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad competition was initiated in 2007, in-order to prepare students for the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics. The Institute of Physics Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Department of Physics, University of Colombo and Ministry of Education made arrangements to hold national competitions, related to international events annually. It is coordinated by Dr. K.P.S. Chandana Jayaratne of the University of Colombo. So far, three competitions have been held.

==Influence==

It was only in the mid 1990s, Astronomy became popular among Sri Lankan high school students. There was a rapid increase of formation of Astronomy clubs in Sri Lankan schools at that time. Astronomical Society of Dharmaraja College, Anandian Astronomical Association, Nalanda College Astronomical Association, Astronomical Society of Mahamaya Girls' College are few of the major high school astronomical societies formed by then. This led to organize various quiz competitions and observation competitions among schools, regarding astronomy. But until Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad competition initiated in 2007, there was no government involvement in the field. Thus, Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad competition influenced many high school students in Sri Lanka to engage in the study of Astronomy.

==Achievements==

Sri Lankan students have won 5 honourable mentions and one prize for the Most Creative Solution in Theory in 3 International Olympiads on Astronomy and Astrophysics so far.1st International Olympiad on Astronomy & Astrophysics 30 November-9 December 2007-Thailand2nd International Olympiad on Astronomy & Astrophysics 19 August-28 August 2008-IndonesiaPrize Announcement  of 1st IOAAParticipation at 2nd IOAATeam Sri Lanka
