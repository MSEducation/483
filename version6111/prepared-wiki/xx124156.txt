Once lined with residential houses on either side, 100 feet road has, over the last few years, turned into one of the most commercially important streets in Bangalore. Numerous retail stores, restaurants, cafes, pubs and bars have sprung up in recent years. While Bangalore has always been known as the 'Pub City' of India, this was largely due to the number of pubs around M. G. Road. Indiranagar and more specifically 100 feet road is slowly wresting this importance away.[tpl]cite web|title=100 Feet Road Bangalore Distance|url=http://www.distancesbetween.com/distance-between/distance-from-100-feet-road-to-bangalore/3318397/r3/|publisher=Distances Between|accessdate=2 September 2013[/tpl]
