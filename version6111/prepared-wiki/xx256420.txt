During the 18th century, the Griquas ("Abatwas") used to hide in the mountain in the area because they were accused of stealing livestock from the farmers who decided to fight them in order to protect their livestock. The Griquas used war spears, and this conflict was called "an outside war", i.e. Impiyasendle or Impiendle.South African Languages - Place names
