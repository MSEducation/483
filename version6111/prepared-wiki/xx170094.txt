The Byron Shire Echo is a free weekly independent tabloid newspaper which is published in the Byron Shire, New South Wales, Australia.
The Brunswick Valley Echo, as the newspaper was first known, was founded in 1986 as a result of marijuana raids by the NSW Police in the valleys behind Mullumbimby. Despite reports that the police acted aggressively and illegally, news media refused to cover the story, so local resident Nicholas Shand founded the paper as a civil rights watchdog.Fiona Martin & Rhonda Ellis Dropping in, not out: the evolution of the alternative press in Byron Shire 1970-2001 http://www.transformationsjournal.org/journal/issue_02/pdf/MartinEllis.pdf Co-founder David Lovejoy has continued that policy since Shandâ€™s death in 1996.David Lovejoy Between Dark and Dark: a Memoir (2005) http://www.worldcat.org/title/between-dark-and-dark-a-memoir/oclc/224469870&referer=brief_
Over the last 25 years The Echo has grown steadily and currently distributes 23,200 copies every Tuesday.Circulation Audit Bureau http://auditbureau.org.au
In 1991 Shand, Lovejoy and photographer Jeff Dawson ventured south of Byron Shire to create the Lismore Echo. This paper was subsequently sold to its employees and renamed the Northern Rivers Echo. It was purchased by Australian Provincial Newspapers in December, 2008.Northern Rivers Echo http://www.echonews.com.au/news/24480-apn-buys-echo/686190/
The Echo launched another publication, this time to the north, in August, 2008. The Tweed Shire Echo, similar in format and outlook to its sister paper, did not attract enough income and was closed early in 2012.
However, August 2011 saw the launch of an online newspaper, Echonetdaily, which is a weekday news service, edited by Chris Dobney, covering the northern rivers region. The video editor is Sharon Shostak,Echonet's video library: http://www.youtube.com/user/echonetvideo who has also directed a documentary about The Echo.The Echo Doco - Born to be Trouble http://www.sharonshostak.com/the-echo-doco.html The successful digital publication was suggested by Eric Beecher, owner of Private Media crikey.com.au, who since 2004 has been a minor shareholder in the company.
