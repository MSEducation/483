==Lyrics==

===Davina Okorie's lyric===

The current text was chosen some time after the 1966 coup in Ghana. Mr. Philip Gbeho’s text which was discarded at that time started with:

Lord God our Father we pray thee,
Be thou our guide in all our ways,
May we united together, proclaim the dawn of our new day!
Children of Ghana arise and uphold your cause
And blaze the trail of freedom far and wide,
O God our Father harken to our call 
and bring us peace here in our father land.

===Current lyric===

The current lyric which has been in use since the 1970s was written by a student Michael Kwame Gbordzoe within the framework of a national competition, and is accompanied by Ghana's National Pledge.
Thus, the lyric of Ghana’s National Anthem is as follows:
Thus, although Mr. Philip Gbeho’s composition is still being used, the current lyric "God Bless our Homeland Ghana", etc. does not originate from him. 
Michael Kwame Gbordzoe, who became a scientist by profession, has drawn the attention of the Ghana Government to the fact that although his lyric has been adopted for the country’s national anthem since the 1970s, there has so far been no official Ghana Government recognition for his work, this  may be attributed to the abrupt changes in regimes in Ghana in the past.
Messages were sent to various Ghanaian government agencies, and was also discussed on air at the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC), Uniiq Fm programme ‘PTGlive,’ on 9 March 2008.

==National Pledge Of Ghana==

The National Pledge Of Ghana is the National Pledge (Oath of allegiance) to the Republic of Ghana, and is recited immediately after God Bless Our Homeland Ghana.
