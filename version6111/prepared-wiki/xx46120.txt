[[Electrical element]]

CATEGORIES: Electronics, Electrical systems

Electrical elements are conceptual abstractions representing idealized electrical components, such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors, used in the analysis of electrical networks. Any electrical network can be analysed as multiple, interconnected electrical elements in a schematic diagram or circuit diagram, each of which affects the voltage in the network or current through the network. These ideal electrical elements represent real, physical electrical or electronic components but they do not exist physically and they are assumed to have ideal properties according to a lumped element model, while components are objects with less than ideal properties, a degree of uncertainty in their values and some degree of nonlinearity, each of which may require a combination of multiple electrical elements in order to approximate its function.
Circuit analysis using electric elements is useful for understanding many practical electrical networks using components. By analyzing the way a network is affected by its individual elements it is possible to estimate how a real network will behave.

===Non-linear elements===

In reality, all circuit components are non-linear and can only be approximated to linear over a certain range.  To more exactly describe the passive elements, their constitutive relation is used instead of simple proportionality.  From any two of the circuit variables there are six constitutive relations that can be formed.  From this it is supposed that there is a theoretical fourth passive element since there are only five elements in total (not including the various dependent sources) found in linear network analysis.  This additional element is called memristor.  It only has any meaning as a time-dependent non-linear element; as a time-independent linear element it reduces to a regular resistor.  The constitutive relations of the passive elements are given by;Ljiljana Trajković, "Nonlinear circuits", The Electrical Engineering Handbook (Ed: Wai-Kai Chen), pp.75–77, Academic Press, 2005 ISBN 0-12-170960-4
The fourth passive element, the memristor, was proposed by Leon Chua in a 1971 paper, but a physical component demonstrating memristance was not created until thirty-seven years later. It was reported on April 30, 2008, that a working memristor had been developed by a team at HP Labs led by scientist R. Stanley Williams.[tpl]citation|last=Strukov|first=Dmitri B|last2=Snider|first2=Gregory S|last3=Stewart|first3=Duncan R|last4=Williams|first4=Stanley R|title=The missing memristor found|journal=Nature|volume=453|pages=80–83|year=2008|doi=10.1038/nature06932|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7191/full/nature06932.html|pmid=18451858|issue=7191|bibcode=2008Natur.453...80S[/tpl]EETimes, 30 April 2008, 'Missing link' memristor created, EETimes, 30 April 2008Engineers find 'missing link' of electronics – 30 April 2008Researchers Prove Existence of New Basic Element for Electronic Circuits – 'Memristor' – 30 April 2008  With the advent of the memristor, each pairing of the four variables can now be related. Because memristors are time-variant by definition, they are not included in linear time-invariant (LTI) circuit models.[tpl]cn|reason=they are not included because they are not linear surely. It is perfectly feasible to have a time invariant memristor as a theoretical ideal element|date=May 2013[/tpl]
There are also two special non-linear elements which are sometimes used in analysis but which are not the ideal counterpart of any real component:
These are sometimes used in models of components with more than two terminals: transistors for instance.

==Two-port elements==

All the above are two-terminal, or one-port, elements with the exception of the dependent sources.  There are two lossless, passive, linear two-port elements that are normally introduced into network analysis.  Their constitutive relations in matrix notation are;
The transformer maps a voltage at one port to a voltage at the other in a ratio of n.  The current between the same two port is mapped by 1/n.  The gyrator, on the other hand, maps a voltage at one port to a current at the other.  Likewise, currents are mapped to voltages.  The quantity r in the matrix is in units of resistance.  The gyrator is a necessary element in analysis because it is not reciprocal.  Networks built from the basic linear elements only are obliged to be reciprocal and so cannot be used by themselves to represent a non-reciprocal system.  It is not essential, however, to have both the transformer and gyrator.  Two gyrators in cascade are equivalent to a transformer but the transformer is usually retained for convenience.  Introduction of the gyrator also makes either capacitance or inductance non-essential since a gyrator terminated with one of these at port 2 will be equivalent to the other at port 1.  However, transformer, capacitance and inductance are normally retained in analysis because they are the ideal properties of the basic physical components transformer, inductor and capacitor whereas a practical gyrator must be constructed as an active circuit.Wadhwa, C.L., Network analysis and synthesis, pp.17–22, New Age International, ISBN 81-224-1753-1.Herbert J.
