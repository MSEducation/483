David's reckless pursuit of Layla sets off an unveiling of the similarities and contrasts of their ancient cultures.  His lust grows into love as he discovers in stunning Layla a sensitive, intelligent war survivor with a rich culture that echoes his own.  But their families are dead set against their unlikely romance. Faced with deportation, Layla must choose: David or Dr. Ahmad?
