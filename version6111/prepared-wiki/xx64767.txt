==Biography==

Stock was born in Margate, Kent, England in 1951. He was self- taught in playing the piano and guitar and began writing songs at the age of seven.[tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ilikemusic.com/interview/Stock_Aitken_and_Waterman |title=Interview #39: Mike Stock | I Like Music - Online Music Magazine and Music Service Provider |publisher=I Like Music |date=2004-10-12 |accessdate=2011-12-31[/tpl] Inspired by The Beatles he soon became fixated with pop music and put together his first band at age 13, playing bass guitar and singing.[tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=16[/tpl] Fascinated by the popular songwriting styles of Rodgers and Hammerstein, and writers such as Irving Berlin and the energy and freshness of The Beatles, he established a deep love of pop music.[tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=17[/tpl] Stock signed a publishing contract when he was nineteen after earning a reputation as a budding songwriter, although no one had suggested a full-time career in the music world was a possibility.[tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=14[/tpl]
In 1970 Stock earned a placement at the University of Hull to study Drama and Theology and formed a band with a fellow student, the later acclaimed Oscar-winning director, Anthony Minghella.[tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=16[/tpl] Whilst at Hull, Stock met his wife Bobbie and left university when she graduated to concentrate his efforts in making it in music.[tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=15[/tpl] In 1975 they married and soon after, sold their house in Bury, Lancashire to move back south [tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=18[/tpl] Stock played his first paid, solo gig at Aveley Working Men’s Club in Essex in 1976, earning twenty five pounds.[tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=19[/tpl] By the late 1970s Stock, now living in Blackheath, South London, was performing up and down the country. Performing solo, in a duo or with bands ‘Mirage’ and 'Nightwork', Stock gained a good reputation for his live performances and was regularly booked for venues like the Hilton Hotel, Grosvenor House and the Dorchester in Mayfair.[tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=21[/tpl] Throughout 1979 to 1981 Stock was gigging every night of the week in various bands embracing; pop, dance, old standards, rock or funk.[tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=24[/tpl]
Stock’s band had gone through several guitar players before he was alerted to Matt Aitken; a guitarist who had been spotted by another member of his band working on a cruise ship.[tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=25[/tpl] Stock contacted Aitken to offer him a role in the band. Playing on cruise ships and in various bands of his own, Aitken was an accomplished guitarist whose style could adapt to any type of music. [tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=26[/tpl] In 1982 Stock moved to Abbey Wood, South London where, along with Matt Aitken he acquired a recording desk and tape machine and formed his first record label.[tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=27[/tpl] During the break of one of ‘Mirage’s’ sets on New Year’s Eve 1983, Stock informed the band he would be leaving and was going into the studio to pursue his career as a songwriter and producer. Matt Aitken agreed to join him and from January 1984 onwards the pair worked exclusively in recording studios.[tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=mike stock |url=http://stockaitkenlovethis.itgo.com/interviewma.html |title=Matt Aitken Interview 1996 |publisher=Stockaitkenlovethis.itgo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31[/tpl]

==Stock Aitken and Waterman==

In 1983 Stock had been approached by Andy Paul, a Greek Cypriot, to write a song for Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest. ‘Anna Maria Elena’ was voted by the Cypriot public to represent their country in the competition and the re-recorded version would be Stock and Aitken’s second collaboration with Waterman. The team were then asked to produce a song for Divine and they recorded ‘You Think You’re a Man’ at the Marquee Studio which was released by Proto Records in July 1984 reaching number 16 in the UK charts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/1984-08-04/ |title=1984-08-04 Top 40 Official UK Singles Archive |publisher=Official Charts |date=1984-08-04 |accessdate=2011-12-31[/tpl] Soon after, the team recorded Hazell Dean’s ‘Whatever I Do, (Wherever I Go)’.

===The Hit Factory: Bananarama, Mel and Kim, Princess (1985-86)===

In 1985 the trio built a new studio at ‘The Vineyard’ recording studio complex, The Borough that would later be dubbed 'The Hit Factory'. Whilst working with the band Brilliant, Stock wrote a song for their backing singer Desiree Heslop called ‘Say I’m Your Number One’, which became a hit in the UK under her stage name ‘Princess’. Towards the end of 1985 the group Bananarama approached SAW to record a cover of ‘Shocking Blue’s’ Venus.

===Rick Astley, Ferry Aid (1987)===

In 1987 Rick Astley recorded what would be one of the team’s biggest hits-Never Gonna Give You Up, though initially Stock and Aitken were unsure of its appeal with Astley’s unorthodox but strong voice.[tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=43[/tpl] When it was released by RCA, Never Gonna Give You Up went straight to #1 in 17 different countries including America and the UK where it became the biggest selling record of 1987.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb09/articles/classictracks_0209.htm |title=Classic Tracks: Rick Astley Never Gonna Give You Up |publisher=Soundonsound.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=UK TOP TEN BEST SELLING SINGLES OF 1987 |url=http://www.popreport.co.uk/chart_history/87_main.php |title=Top Ten Best Selling UK Singles of 1987 |publisher=Popreport.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31[/tpl] Astley's fourth single, Together Forever also topped the Billboard Hot 100.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=rick astley|chart=all[/tpl] |title=Rick Astley Music News & Info |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31[/tpl] That year SAW produced Let It Be in aid of the victims involved in the Zeebrugge Ferry disaster, and Stock got the chance to work with his musical inspiration Paul McCartney whose original recordings of The Beatles classic were sent to the production team by producer George Martin.[tpl]sfn|Stock|2004|p=48[/tpl]  ‘Let It Be’ went straight to #1 where it stayed for three weeks knocking Stock’s own ‘Respectable’ by Mel and Kim off the top spot.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/1987-04-04/ |title=1987-04-04 Top 40 Official UK Singles Archive |publisher=Official Charts |date=1987-04-04 |accessdate=2011-12-31[/tpl] Two years later Stock would again collaborate with McCartney on the Gerry and the Pacemakers hit-Ferry Cross the Mersey, recorded to raise funds for the victims and their families of the Hillsborough Disaster in 1989 which also went straight to #1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=16434 |title=Gerry Marsden, Paul McCartney, Holly Johnson And The Christians - Ferry Cross The Mersey |publisher=Chart Stats |date=1989-05-20 |accessdate=2011-12-31[/tpl]
