The Rishon LeZion Moshe Dayan Railway Station is an Israel Railways station in Rishon LeZion. The station is located adjacent to the Moshe Dayan Interchange on the Ayalon Highway. As of September 2011 it serves as the terminus of a new suburban passenger line serving the cities of Holon, Bat Yam, and Rishon LeZion in southern Gush Dan. Current travel time from the station to Tel Aviv HaHagana Railway Station is about 18 minutes.

==Future service==

The railway line south of the station was extended to the new Yavne West Railway Station in 2012 and will eventually connect with the existing Lodâ€“Ashkelon railway in 2013, thereby offering improved and more direct train service from Tel Aviv to the cities of Yavne, Ashdod, and Ashkelon. When this occurs, Moshe Dayan will also serve as a stop on new inter-city services to those cities. From Ashkelon a new railway line is also being built to Beersheva and the station will evenutally serve trains headed there as well. A few hundred meters south of the station there is an unused railway tunnel passing under the Ayalon Highway which may some day serve a rail line connecting Moshe Dayan station with the Rishon LeZion HaRishonim Railway Station, from which there is existing service to Lod and a future rail line that is planned to reach Jerusalem and Modiin.
It is anticipated that an extension to the Red Line LRT which is currently under construction, will make Moshe Dayan Station the southern terminus of the Red Line LRT. The future planned Green and Brown LRT lines of the Tel Aviv Light Rail will also terminate at the station (though these are not planned for operation before 2020).
