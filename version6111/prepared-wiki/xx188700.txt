Sarasota Coastal Credit Union (now Achieva Credit Union), was a state chartered credit union and was regulated under the authority of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). On November 1, 2009, Sarasota Coastal Credit Union merged with Achieva Credit Union, which is headquartered in Clearwater, Florida.  The merger created a credit union with more than $800 million in assets and more than 90,000 members in seven counties.  Before the merger, Achieva had members throughout Pinellas, Pasco, Hernando and Hillsborough counties while Sarasota Coastal Credit Union served members throughout Manatee, Sarasota, and Charlotte counties.[tpl]cite web|title=Achieva Credit Union Press release|url=http://www.achievacu.org/personal/about-us/pressreleases/09-10-28/Achieva_and_Sarasota_Coastal_Credit_Unions_To_Merge.aspx|accessdate=November 3, 2009[/tpl]

==History==

On December 12, 1953, seven school teachers came together and signed a Certificate of Organization to form the credit union.  The original amount of $130 used to organize the credit union was deposited by those seven individuals.  The name of the credit union started as The Sarasota County Teacher’s Credit Union.  In the years that followed, Sarasota Coastal adopted its current name in response to mergers with other credit unions, the inclusion of Sarasota County employees, and other select employer groups.
Like Sarasota Coastal, Achieva Credit Union was started as a teacher’s credit union in 1937 in Pinellas County.  Throughout the years, their field of membership and number of counties served has expanded.  The merger is seen as an excellent fit between the two credit unions, as the membership base is similar and the combined field of membership now encompasses counties from Hernando to Charlotte on the West Coast of Florida.
Sarasota Coastal Credit Union members voted their approval of the merger in a Special Member meeting, held in Sarasota on Oct. 26, 2009.[tpl]cite web|title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20091029/ARTICLE/910291050|accessdate=December 8, 2009[/tpl] "We are pleased that the members of Sarasota Coastal Credit Union have voted in favor of merging, and we look forward to working with them throughout the entire consolidation process," said Gary Regoli, President and CEO of Achieva. "The combined strengths of the two credit unions will provide even greater benefits to all of our members." Harrington, Jeff.

==Services==

Sarasota Coastal (now Achieva) offers savings accounts, checking accounts, IRA accounts, and certificates of deposit, as well as consumer loans, credit cards, mortgages, home equity loans and HELOCs.
