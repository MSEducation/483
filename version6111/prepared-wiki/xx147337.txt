==Background and production==

"Breakdown", as it appears on Daughtry, is actually a rewrite and combination of two songs previously, "Conviction" and "Break Down", performed by Chris Daughtry's former hard rock/alternative metal band "Absent Element". These two songs appeared on the album Uprooted.

==Promotion and release==

The first single released from the album is "It's Not Over", and fellow Idol contestant  Ace Young, producer Gregg Wattenberg, and Course of Nature frontman Mark Wilkerson are credited as co-writers. On December 25, 2008, the song was nominated for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.
In 2007, wrestling promotion, WWE, used "There and Back Again" as the theme song for their April pay-per-view Backlash. In the same year, the song "Feels Like Tonight" was used by the WWE' for their annual Tribute to the Troops special in 2007.
The album was released on November 21, 2006 by RCA Records and 19 Recordings Limited.
Three years after the album's release, it continues to maintain a spot in the top 100 best selling albums. It is still being promoted, along with the band's second studio album Leave This Town. In 2009, ESPN's NASCAR telecasts used "Feels Like Tonight" and "Home" for promotions.

==Reception==

===Critical===

Critical response to Daughtry was mixed; while many critics felt that the album was generally pleasing and the first real "rock" album from American Idol alumni, others felt it was unoriginal and too commercial.  While Ken Barnes of USA Today conceded that Chris Daughtry has "strong pipes and palpable angst", overall he found the band "generic", calling them "FuelNickelStaindback".[tpl]cref|b[/tpl]Barnes, Ken (November 20, 2006). "This week's reviews: Beatles, Snoop, Daughtry, RS Supernova, 2Pac, more" USAToday.com. Retrieved September 23, 2007 People magazine found the album "a solid if not spectacular effort that at the very least proves that Chris Daughtry is not just another Idol also-ran."Arnold, Chuck (December 4, 2006), "Chris Daughtry". People. 66 (23):45  Christian Hoard (with Rolling Stone) said that "Chris Daughtry gets points for not courting soccer moms, but just because he can howl like a mother fucker doesn't mean he's not a cheeseball."Hoard, Christian (December 14, 2006), "Daughtry". Rolling Stone. (1015):127  In a truly mixed review, Billboard said the album "is music tailor-made for ill-conceived radio formatting, music for consumers whose taste has already been well-established if not preprogrammed," then added, "But Chris Daughtry sure does sing his butt off."O., W. (November 25, 2006), "Daughtry". Billboard. 118 (47):51  Allmusic broke from the pack, so to speak, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine calling the album a "a debut that's not only a lot more credible than any American Idol-affiliated rock album should be, but it's a lot easier to digest than most of its post-grunge ilk."Erlewine, Stephen Thomas (2006). "Review" AllMusic.com. Retrieved September 13, 2007  In a humorous review, comedian Stephen Colbert found Chris Daughtry's success further proof of the impending "cultural Armageddon."  He remarked, "It's bad enough this guy sounds like Creed...but Daughtry's success sets a dangerous precedent of rewarding losers...America elected Taylor Hicks as its Idol, and we owe him our loyalty."Gundersen, Edna (March 21, 2007), "It's just beginning for Chris Daughtry".

The album won an American Music Awards in 2007 for Favorite Pop-Rock Album.
