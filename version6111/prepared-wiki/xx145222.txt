Paolo Gorini (January 18, 1813 - February 2, 1881) was an Italian scientist.

==Biography==

Born in Pavia, he moved to Lodi in 1834 as physics lecturer in the local Lyceum. Here he achieved noteworthy discoveries about organic substances.
After the Five Days of Milan, he had to flee to Switzerland, where he continued his studies in geology. Back in Lodi, in 1871 he published Sull'origine del vulcani ("On the Origin of Volcanoes") and in 1872 he became famous for the embalming of the bodies of Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Rovani. 
In 1878, Professor Gorini was commissioned by the Cremation Society of Great Britain to construct the cremator at Woking Crematorium in England.
A monument and a museum are dedicated to him in Lodi.
