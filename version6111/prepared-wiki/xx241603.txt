Eintracht Baunatal is a German association football club from the city of Baunatal, Hesse. The club was established in 1907 as Deutsche Turngemeinde Großenritter. On 14 September 1933, TG merged with Sportverein Eintracht Großenritter to become Turn- und Sport 1907 Großenritter. Following World War II on 1 July 1945 the memberships of TuS and the worker's clubs Arbeiter Turn- und Sportverein 1919 Großenritter and Radsportverein Solidarität Großenritter – both banned by the Nazis as politically unacceptable to the regime in 1933 – were joined to form Sportgemeinde Großenritter. The following year the club was renamed Turn- und Sportverein Eintracht Großenritter.Grüne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag ISBN 3-89784-147-9
