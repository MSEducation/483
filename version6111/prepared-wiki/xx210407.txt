[[Exit (economics)]]

CATEGORIES: Economics terminology

Exit, in economics, means opting out of future transactions.http://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/ajecsc/v61y2002i1p123-158.html

==Overview==

A firm can secure its ability to exit, for instance, by only agreeing to contracts that contain a clause that allows for termination on terms it feels would be acceptable. In constitutional economics, it implies a right of secession. However, a citizen seeking simply to avoid paying income taxes can also exit by emigrating to a country with more favorable laws, assuming such a country exists and allows their immigration.
