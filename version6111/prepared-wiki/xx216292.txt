==Background==

Initially, Bautista refused to create a whole revival album, saying "I (Bautista) didn’t want to seem to be jumping on the bandwagon ... it was time for me to offer something new at this point (for his fans)".[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/02/04/ENTR2007020486265.html|title= Christian Bautista woos CD buyers back with ‘Love Song’|accessdate=2008-08-22 |author= Jojo P.

Critically, the album received favorable reviews. Resty Odon of Titik Pilipino gave the album four out of five stars, stating "In this live recording, he works on romantic tunes and tries earnestly to tug at the memory's heartstrings". However, he disliked the fourth song, "Beautiful in My Eyes", and thought it was out of Bautista's upper register range. The review ended up with Odon, saying " All in all, though, this is a memorable recording for this artist and especially his fans.Resty Odon, Album review, "Just a Love Song...
