==History==

The Swan Italian Club United Soccer Club was formed in 1984 by members of the Italian community in the Swan Valley. The club was founded after the Swan Italian Club, headed by John Steffanelli, decided to start a semi-professional team in the Swan Valley. A committee was then formed in late 1984 composed of Frank Arvino (President), Chris Godfrey (Secretary), Neil Aloi (Treasurer), Tony Scali, John Muriale and Tony Bottega. 
In 1985 the club played its first season in amateur ranks in 1985. After finishing third in their inaugural season they were accepted in the state fourth division for the 1986 season.
After playing the first two seasons at Jack Mann Oval in 1987 the club moved to new facilities at the Swan Italian Club.
The club first made the Premier League in 1996 and have been in the top tier every year since 2000. They won their first major trophy in 2003 when they won the Association Cup, beating Perth SC 2-1. They successfully defended the title in 2004, with a Gary Marocchi-led team beating Fremantle City 3-1.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Clubs/S/SwanICDH.html |title=Swan IC Divisional History|accessdate=2009-02-17 |work= |publisher=OzFootball.net |date= [/tpl]
