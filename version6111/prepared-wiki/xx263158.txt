The Linsly School, formerly known as the Linsly Military Institute, is a boarding and day school located in Wheeling, West Virginia. It was founded in 1814 by Noah Linsly and chartered by the State of Virginia in the same year. The school is the oldest preparatory school west of the Alleghenies. It was originally known as the Lancastrian Academy.
In 1861, the school adopted the dress and discipline of an all-boys military school. In 1978 the board of trustees voted to change the military structure and adopt the philosophy of a traditional boys preparatory school.
In 1988, Linsly became a co-ed school.http://www.linsly.org/podium/default.aspx?t=49897
In 2007, Linsly ranged from 5th to 12th grade with a student body of about 420. Linsly boasts a 100% college acceptance rate for its graduating seniors [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl].  In the 2013-2014 school year, the Linsly School has about 440 students in grades 5-12. As a both day and boarding school, Linsly is home to students from many countries, including China, Finland, Canada, North Korea, and Japan.
In celebration of Linsly's 200th academic year, a campaign is underway to raise $10,000,000 for an addition to Banes Hall, the main academic building, renovations to many other on-campus facilities, and to enrich Linsly's instructing capability. "Forward and No Retreat," is the school theme for the 2013-2014 school year, the same motto in which the school was founded under in 1814.
