==History==

Sedan was founded in 1424.  In the sixteenth century Sedan was an asylum for Protestant refugees from the Wars of Religion.
Until 1651, the Principality of Sedan belonged to the La Tour d'Auvergne family.  It was at that time a sovereign principality.  Their most illustrious representative, Marshal Turenne, was born at Sedan on 11 September 1611.  With help from the Holy Roman Empire, it managed to defeat France at the Battle of La Marfée, though immediately afterwards it was besieged and its prince, Frédéric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne, duc de Bouillon, submitted to France.  Only a year after that submission, it was annexed to France in return for sparing his life after he became involved in a conspiracy against France.
During the Franco-Prussian War, on 2 September 1870 the French emperor Napoleon III was taken prisoner with 100,000 of his soldiers at the First Battle of Sedan. Due to this major victory, which also made the unification of Germany possible, 2 September was declared "Sedan Day" (Sedantag) and a national German holiday in 1871. It remained a holiday until 1919.
Sedan was occupied by the Germans for four years during World War I.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wir-rheinlaender.lvr.de/engl_version/firstworldwar/sedanasasymbol.htm |title=First World War |publisher=Wir-rheinlaender.lvr.de |date= |accessdate=2012-12-13[/tpl]
During World War II  the German troops first invaded neutral Belgium and crossed the Meuse River by winning the Second Battle of Sedan that lasted from 12 to 15 May 1940. This battle allowed them to win the whole Battle of France as they not only bypassed the French fortification system, the Maginot Line, but it also enabled them to entrap the Allied Forces that were advancing east into Belgium, as part of the Allied Dyle Plan strategy.
