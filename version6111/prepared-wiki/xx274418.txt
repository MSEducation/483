In the late eighties and early nineties Fortis wrote poetry which was published in two books, Tributo giapponese (1988) and Dentro il giardino (1994), both of which were edited by Giovanni Tranchida.[tpl]cite web|author=IT-News staff|date=8 February 1992|title=La Scimmia di Tranchida|publisher=IT-News |url=http://www.it-news.it/1992/02/08/cultura-editoria/la-scimmia-di-tranchida/[/tpl] [tpl]it icon[/tpl]
Much in vogue in the eighties, Fortis has had a lull in his career, however, he returned to prominence in 2006 with the participation of the third edition of the reality show Music Farm hosted by Simona Ventura (a show similar to the Hit Me, Baby, One More Time format) on Rai Due.[tpl]cite web|author=MF staff|date=25 May 2006|title=Alberto Fortis - RAI - Music Farm|publisher=Music Farm|url=http://www.musicfarm.rai.it/R2_popup_articolofoglia/0,,238%5E8026,00.html[/tpl] [tpl]it icon[/tpl]
