The Greatest Hits is the first compilation album by Cheap Trick. It contains many of Cheap Trick's popular songs, as well as a previously unreleased cover version of The Beatles' "Magical Mystery Tour, which according to the liner notes, was an outtake from the Lap of Luxury album. Though it peaked at only #174 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, it remained a steady seller, and was certified platinum for one million U.S. shipments seven years after its release.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Cheap_Trick&title=Greatest%20Hits&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50|title= RIAA — Gold & Platinum — Searchable Database|accessdate= February 27, 2010[/tpl]
Rendered obsolete by succeeding compilations that contain almost all of the songs in this album, it was nonetheless re-released in 2003, in a re-mastered edition with the addition of "Clock Strikes Ten".
