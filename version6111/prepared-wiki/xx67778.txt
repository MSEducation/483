[[Nianfo]]

CATEGORIES: Buddhist mantras, Pure Land Buddhism

Nianfo (Chinese: 念佛, pinyin: niànfó; Japanese: 念仏 nembutsu; Korean: 염불 yeombul; Vietnamese: niệm Phật), is a term commonly seen in the Pure Land school of Mahāyāna Buddhism. It derives from the Sanskrit term [tpl]IAST|buddhānusmṛti[/tpl], which means "mindfulness of the Buddha." In the context of Pure Land practice, it generally refers to the repetition of the name of Amitābha Buddha.

==Indian Sanskrit Nianfo==

Although the Sanskrit phrase used in India is not mentioned originally in the bodies of the two main Pure Land sutras, it appears in the opening of the extant Sanskrit Infinite Life Sutra as the following:[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.uwest.edu/sanskritcanon/dp/index.php?q=node%2F35&textID=1b3c12777d122eb311| title = Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon: Sukhāvatīvyūhaḥ (Vistaramātṛkā)| accessdate = 2009-12-31| publisher =University of the West[/tpl]
The apostrophe and omission of the first "A" in "Amitābha" comes from normal Sanskrit sandhi transformation, and implies that the first "A" is implied and spoken more quickly. A more accessible rendering might be:
The phrase literally means "Homage to Infinite Light". The Sanskrit pronunciation is the following:

==Nianfo in Various forms==

As the practice of nianfo spread from India to various other regions, the original pronunciation changed to fit various native languages.
In China, the practice of nianfo was codified with the establishment of the separate Pure Land school of Buddhism. The most common form of this is the six syllable mantra;單純念佛，最殊勝！[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] some shorten it into Āmítuó Fó.淨業持名四十八法

==Purpose of Nianfo==

Regarding Pure Land practice in Indian Buddhism, Hajime Nakamura writes that as described in the Pure Land sūtras from India, Mindfulness of the Buddha (Skt. buddhānusmṛti, Ch. nianfo) is the essential practice.Nakamura, Hajime. Indian Buddhism: A Survey with Bibliographical Notes. 1999. p. 205 These forms of mindfulness are essentially methods of meditating upon Amitābha Buddha.
In the Śūraṅgama Sūtra, Mahāsthāmaprāpta Bodhisattva tells of how he gained enlightenment through the practice of nianfo, or continuous pure mindfulness of Amitābha, to obtain samādhi.
In Chinese Buddhism, the nianfo is specifically taken to be a type of mantra used in meditation, and it is often practiced while counting with Buddhist prayer beads.Wei-an Cheng (2000). Taming the monkey mind: a guide to pure land practice, translation with commentary by Elder Master Suddhisukha; New York: Sutra Translation Committee of the U.S. and Canada, pp. 18-19 In China there is also the combined practice of Pure Land and Chán. As taught by Venerable Nan Huai-Chin, the nianfo is chanted slowly, and the mind is emptied out after each repetition. When idle thoughts arise, the nianfo is repeated again to clear them. With constant practice, the mind progressively empties and the meditator attains samādhi.Yuan, Margaret. Grass Mountain: A Seven Day Intensive in Ch'an Training with Master Nan Huai-Chin. York Beach: Samuel Weiser, 1986
In most Pure Land traditions, mindfully chanting of the name of Amitābha Buddha is viewed as allowing one to obtain birth in Amitābha's western pure land called Sukhāvatī (skt. "Realm of Bliss"). It is felt that this act would help to negate vast stores of negative karma that might hinder one's pursuit of buddhahood. Sukhāvatī is a place of refuge where one can become enlightened without being distracted by the sufferings of our existence.
Various Pure Land schools in Japan have different interpretations of the nianfo, often based on faith in Amitābha rather than on meditation. In the Jodo Shinshu Buddhist tradition, the nianfo is reinterpreted as an expression of gratitude to Amitābha Buddha. The idea behind this is that rebirth into Sukhāvatī is assured the moment one first has faith in Amitābha.

==Origins of the Nianfo==

Andrew Skilton looks an intermingling of Mahāyāna teachings with Buddhist meditation schools in Kashmir for the rise of Mahāyāna practices related to buddhānusmṛti, mindfulness of the Buddha:Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 162
The earliest dated sutra describing the nianfo is the Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra (first century BCE), which is thought to have originated in ancient kingdom of Gandhāra. This sutra does not enumerate any vows of Amitābha or the qualities of Sukhāvatī, but rather briefly describes the repetition of the name of Amitābha as a means to enter his realm through meditation.
Both the Immeasurable Life Sūtra (Larger Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra) and the Amitābha Sūtra (Smaller Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra) subsequently included instructions for practicing nianfo in this manner. However, it has not been determined which sūtra was composed first, and to what degree the practice of this form of nianfo had already been popularized in India. Nianfo directed at other buddhas and bodhisattvas is also advocated in sūtras from this period, for figures such as Akṣobhya Buddha and Avalokitasvara Bodhisattva.
The practice of nianfo for Amitābha Buddha became very popular in India. With translations of the aforementioned sūtras as well as instruction from Indian monks, the practice rapidly spread to East Asia.

==Nembutsu-ban==

The term nembutsu-ban is applied to the event in Kyoto, Japan in 1207 where Hōnen and his followers were banned from the city and forced into exile. This occurred when the leaders of older schools of Buddhism persuaded the civil authorities to prohibit the newer practices including the recitation of Namu Amida Butsu.[tpl]cite book|title=Popular Buddhism in Japan: Shin Buddhist religion & culture|author=Esben Andreasen|year=1998|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, Hawai'i[/tpl] The ban was lifted in 1211.

==Nianfo in Modern History==

Thích Quảng Đức, a Vietnamese Mahāyāna monk who famously burned himself to death in an act of protest, said the nianfo as his last words immediately before death. He sat in the lotus position, rotated a string of wooden prayer beads, and recited the words "Nam Mô A Di Đà Phật" before striking the match and dropping it on himself.
