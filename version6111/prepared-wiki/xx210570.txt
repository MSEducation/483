Kfar Aza ([tpl]lang-he-n|כְּפַר עַזַּה[/tpl], lit. Gaza Village) is a kibbutz in southern Israel. Located between Netivot and Sderot around three kilometres east of Gaza, it falls under the jurisdiction of Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 760.
The village was established in August 1951 by immigrants from Egypt and the Moroccan city of Tangiers who had received training in Ein Harod, Ayelet HaShahar and later Afikim. It was initially named Yagav, but was renamed Kfar Aza in 1953; at the time the residents could freely visit nearby Gaza. 
The kibbutz was temporarily abandoned in 1955, and in January 1957 members of the Mita'arim gar'in moved in.
