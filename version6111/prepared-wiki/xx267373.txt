==History==

The history of the site can be traced to the Old Kingdom period of Egyptian history. A granite pillar of the Fifth dynasty pharaoh, Userkaf, is the oldest object found at El-Tod. It was this same pharaoh who ordered that the temple to Monthu be enlarged.[tpl]cite book|author1=Nicolás Grimal|author2=Nicolas-Christophe Grimal|title=A history of ancient Egypt|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GzTiXt49I0YC&pg=PA76|accessdate=17 December 2011|date=11 July 1994|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-19396-8|page=76[/tpl] Evidence of Eleventh dynasty building is shown in the discovery of blocks bearing the names of Mentuhotep II and Mentuhotep III. Under Senusret I, these buildings were replaced with a new temple. Further additions to this temple were made under Ptolemy VIII.

Aside from Monthu, to whom a temple was dedicated, the Egyptian goddess Junit was of local importance.[tpl]cite book|last=Lurker|first=Manfred|title=The Routledge dictionary of gods and goddesses, devils and demons|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hKOsJYdCr20C&pg=PA95|accessdate=17 December 2011|date=20 August 2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-34018-2|page=95[/tpl] According to Flinders Petrie, the god of Tuphium was Hemen.[tpl]cite book|author=Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie|authorlink=Flinders Petrie|title=The making of Egypt|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1hePAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=17 December 2011|year=1939|publisher=Sheldon Press|page=68[/tpl] As part of the Thebaid, the area also saw the worship of Sebak (Sobek), the Egyptian crocodile god.[tpl]cite book |title=History of the Egyptian religion |last=Tiele |first=Cornelis Petrus |authorlink=Cornelis Tiele |year=1882 |publisher=Trübner and Co. |location=London |isbn= |page=135 |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/historyofegyptia00tiel#page/134/mode/2up |accessdate=16 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=The gods of the Egyptians, or studies in Egyptian mythology |author=Budge |first=E.

==Remains==

[tpl]quote|text=On the 7th of March we visited the ruins of the ancient Tuphium, now Taoud situated on the right bank of the river but in the vicinity of the Arabic chain and very near to Hermonthis which is on the opposite bank. Here there are two or three little apartments of a temple,inhabited by fellahs and their cattle. In the largest there are still some bas-reliefs, which informed me that the triad worshipped in the temple consisted of Mandou, the goddess Ritho, and their son Harphré, the same as in the temple of Hermonthis, the capital of the nome (district) to which Tuphium belonged.|sign=Jean-François Champollion|source=[tpl]cite news|title=The London literary gazette and journal of belles lettres, arts, sciences, etc|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pYxHAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA634|accessdate=17 December 2011|year=1829|publisher=H.

===Tod Treasure===

Archaeologists during 1936 digging at the temple location found in the support structures under the ruined building a number of metallic and lapis lazuli artifacts. The objects made largely of silver were for some authorities (at some time) of unknown origin, are at least known as not being of Egyptian origin--the style of the vessels nevertheless resembling objects found in Knossos of c. 1900–1700 BC.According to P-B Geneviève of the Louvre museum Yet at Knossos such objects were made of clay, possibly imitating metal.
The initial discovery of four chests (inscribed with the name of a pharaoh called Amenemhat II ) made of copper and containing the objects had been made by F. Bisson de la Roque.Pierrat-Bonnefois Geneviève, Louvre Museum website. Musée du Louvre, Multimedia Division, Cultural Production, Department 75058, Paris, Cedex 01,France 2011-12-13. Also see at the Louvre Museum website Some sources posit that the treasure is of Asiatic origin and that some of it, in fact, was manufactured in Iran (the latter as claimed by Roger Moorey).Peter Roger Stuart Moorey[tpl]cite book | url = books.google.co.uk| title = Ancient mesopotamian materials and industries: the archaeological evidence (415 pages) | publisher =  Eisenbrauns, 1999 ISBN 1-57506-042-6 | accessdate = 2011-12-13[/tpl] cf. E. Porada, (1982)  “Remarks on the Tod Treasure in Egypt,” Some gold artifacts are also part of the Treasure, and they may have originated from Anatolia. A similar conclusion is drawn on the origin of the silverware based on evidence obtained from relative analysis of the  metallic constituents.Paul T.

Objects that were found as part of the Treasure seem to have originated from various parts of the world, indicating trade contacts of Egypt at that time.
The total weight of all gold items was 6.98 kg, and of the silver items 8.87 kg.Ancient Egypt and Archaeology Web Site After discovery, the Treasure was divided between the Louvre Museum and the Egyptian Museum.
