===Authorship===

====Description====

Eugenio’s works were described as volumes that are thorough and professional in presentation and as being valuable resources for scholars studying the
Philippines and comparative folklore.  Written in the English-language, her Philippine Folk Literature: The Myths (1993) served as a compendium that promotes "national and international access to Filipino folklore," were gathered from written sources rather than collected oral variants, and was intended to foster interest in the subject matter.  In this work, Eugenio also presented the collected narratives in a proper scholarly context that also justified the inclusion of the legends of saints, as opposed to being a pure collection of myths.  This particular volume was also described as a recommended work for "any individual interested
in issues of Filipino worldviews and value systems, to any scholar investigating myths across cultures, and to anyone who enjoys the insights that a culture's narratives provide."
