The Buffalo Creek Reservation was a tract of land surrounding Buffalo Creek in the central portion of Erie County, New York.Holland Land Company map - circa. 1821[tpl]cite book|author=Buffalo Historical Society|title=Publications, Volume 24|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fY4MAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110|accessdate=13 July 2012|year=1920|publisher=Buffalo Historical Society|pages=109â€“116[/tpl] It contained approximately [tpl]convert|49920|acre|km2[/tpl] of land and was set aside for the Native Americans of the region. The Seneca Nation owned the land, however, in 1838 the Treaty of Buffalo Creek dictated that the people of the Seneca Nation leave the tract (and all others in Western New York) and head for Wisconsin and Oklahoma within five years; after the land sale that required the treaty fell through, a new treaty was passed in 1842, and the Buffalo Creek reservation was the only reservation to be dissolved; the Cattaraugus, Oil Springs, Allegany and Tonawanda reservations would remain intact.
The modern Buffalo Creek Reservation consists only of nine-acre plot of land, which was part of the original reservation, upon which the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino is located. Until the Senecas repurchased the land for the casino, it was owned by Carl Paladino, who continues to own much of the surrounding land.Carl Paladino: The accidental candidate | Crain's New York Business
