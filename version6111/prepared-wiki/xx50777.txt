[[Inverse Laplace transform]]

CATEGORIES: Transforms, Complex analysis, Integral transforms

In mathematics, the inverse Laplace transform of a function F(s) is the function f(t) which has the property
The Laplace transform and the inverse Laplace transform together have a number of properties that make them useful for analysing linear dynamic systems.

==Mellin's inverse formula==

An integral formula for the inverse Laplace transform, called the Bromwich integral, the Fourierâ€“Mellin integral, and Mellin's inverse formula, is given by the line integral:
In practice, computing the complex integral can be done by using the Cauchy residue theorem.
It is named after Hjalmar Mellin, Joseph Fourier and Thomas John I'Anson Bromwich.
If F(s) is the Laplace transform of the function f(t),then f(t) is called the inverse Laplace transform of F(s).
