Trouble House Halt was a small station on the Tetbury branch line between Kemble and [tpl]stnlnk|Tetbury[/tpl].

==History==

Diesel railbus services were introduced by British Railways Western Region on the Tetbury branch line on 2 February 1959, and on the same day two halts were opened on that line, at Church's Hill and at Trouble House.[tpl]cite journal |last=Whetmath |first=C.F.D. |editor-first=B.W.C. |editor-last=Cooke |date=July 1964 |title=Letters: Kemble branch closures |journal=Railway Magazine |volume=110 |issue=759 |page=589 |publisher=Tothill Press |location=Westminster [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Butt |first=R.V.J. |title=The Directory of Railway Stations |year=1995 |publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd |location=Yeovil |isbn=1-85260-508-1 |id=R508 |page=234 [/tpl] It was built to serve the Trouble House Public house, and was the only station in England built specifically to serve a pub. (Although Berney Arms station in Norfolk has much the same function). The landlord of the Troublehouse Inn used to supply a beer crate to enable passengers to step up into the coaches. 
The line and station closed on 6 April 1964, but the station was immortalised in that year in the song "Slow Train" by Flanders and Swann.
On 4 April 1964, the last day of operation, when the last passenger train from [tpl]stnlnk|Tetbury[/tpl] arrived at Trouble House Halt, a coffin was loaded onto the train by bowler-hatted mourners. It had been made by the landlord of the pub together with his brother, covered with inscriptions and filled with empty whisky bottles. On arrival at [tpl]stnlnk|Kemble[/tpl], the coffin was transferred to a train for [tpl]stnlnk|Paddington[/tpl], addressed to Dr. Beeching. The last passenger train to Tetbury found its approach to Trouble House Halt blocked by burning hay bales.[tpl]cite journal |editor-first=B.W.C. |editor-last=Cooke |date=June 1964 |title=Notes and News: West Country closures |journal=Railway Magazine |volume=110 |issue=758 |page=527 |publisher=Tothill Press |location=Westminster [/tpl]
