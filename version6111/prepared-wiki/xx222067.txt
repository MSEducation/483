[[Follicular B Helper T cells]]

CATEGORIES: T cells

Follicular B helper T cells (also known as just Follicular helper T cells or TFH), are antigen-experienced CD4+ T cells found in the B cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes, spleens and Peyer's patches, and are identified by their constitutive expression of the B cell follicle homing receptor CXCR5.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fazilleau et al. |title=Follicular helper T cells: lineage and location |journal=Immunity |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=324–35 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19303387 |doi=10.1016/j.immuni.2009.03.003 |last2=Mark |first2=L |last3=McHeyzer-Williams |first3=LJ |last4=McHeyzer-Williams |first4=MG |pmc=2731675[/tpl]  TFH cells are found within B cell follicles and mediate antigen specific naïve or memory B cell activation, which triggers germinal center formation, probably through the expression of CD40L and the secretion of IL-21[tpl]cite journal |author=Seo et al. |title=IL-21 ensures TGF-beta 1-induced IgA isotype expression in mouse Peyer's patches |journal=J Leukoc Biol |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=744–50 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19168593 |doi=10.1189/jlb.0708450 |last2=Youn |first2=J |last3=Kim |first3=PH[/tpl] and IL-4.[tpl]cite journal |author=Zaretsky et al. |title=T follicular helper cells differentiate from Th2 cells in response to helminth antigens |journal=J Exp Med |volume=206 |issue=5 |pages=991–9 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19380637 |doi=10.1084/jem.20090303 |last2=Taylor |first2=JJ |last3=King |first3=IL |last4=Marshall |first4=FA |last5=Mohrs |first5=M |last6=Pearce |first6=EJ |pmc=2715032[/tpl] It is possible that TFH cells might arise as branches in the Th1 and Th2 differentiation pathways but their precise lineage relationship to the other effector CD4+ T cell subsets is still uncertain.  Recent studies have however shown that TFH have distinct gene expression profiles, supporting the theory that TFH are a subset of CD4+ T cells distinct from Th-1, Th-2, Th-17 or Tregs.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chtanova et al. |title=T follicular helper cells express a distinctive transcriptional profile, reflecting their role as non-Th1/Th2 effector cells that provide help for B cells |journal=J Immunol |volume=173 |issue=1 |pages=68–78 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15210760 |last2=Tangye |first2=SG |last3=Newton |first3=R |last4=Frank |first4=N |last5=Hodge |first5=MR |last6=Rolph |first6=MS |last7=MacKay |first7=CR[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Nurieve et al. |title=Generation of T follicular helper cells is mediated by interleukin-21 but independent of T helper 1, 2, or 17 cell lineages |journal=Immunity |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=138–49 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18599325 |doi=10.1016/j.immuni.2008.05.009 |last2=Chung |first2=Y |last3=Hwang |first3=D |last4=Yang |first4=XO |last5=Kang |first5=HS |last6=Ma |first6=L |last7=Wang |first7=YH |last8=Watowich |first8=SS |last9=Jetten |first9=AM |last10=Tian |first10=Qiang |last11=Dong |first11=Chen |pmc=2556461|display-authors=8 [/tpl]

==Role of ICOS==

The Inducible T-cell co-stimulator (CD278 or ICOS) has proven to provide a particularly critical signal for TFH cells since mice deficient in ICOS are unable to develop any TFH,[tpl]cite journal |author=Akiba |title=The role of ICOS in the CXCR5+ follicular B helper T cell maintenance in vivo |journal=J Immunol |volume=175 |issue=4 |pages=2340–8 |date=Aug 2005 |pmid=16081804 |last2=Takeda |first2=K |last3=Kojima |first3=Y |last4=Usui |first4=Y |last5=Harada |first5=N |last6=Yamazaki |first6=T |last7=Ma |first7=J |last8=Tezuka |first8=K |last9=Yagita |first9=H|last10=Okumura |first10=K |display-authors=8 [/tpl] although the exact mechanisms involved are still unknown.[tpl]cite journal |author=Vinuesa et al. |title=A RING-type ubiquitin ligase family member required to repress follicular helper T cells and autoimmunity |journal=Nature |volume=435 |issue=7041 |pages=452–8 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15917799 |doi=10.1038/nature03555 |last2=Cook |first2=MC |last3=Angelucci |first3=C |last4=Athanasopoulos |first4=V |last5=Rui |first5=L |last6=Hill |first6=KM |last7=Yu |first7=D |last8=Domaschenz |first8=H |last9=Whittle |first9=B|last10=Lambe |first10=Teresa |last11=Roberts |first11=Ian S. |last12=Copley |first12=Richard R. |last13=Bell |first13=John I. |last14=Cornall |first14=Richard J. |last15=Goodnow |first15=Christopher C. |display-authors=8 [/tpl] However, it was shown that ICOS induces the secretion of IL-21 by activated CD4+ T cells and that IL-21 plays a crucial role in the development of TFH.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bauquet |title=The costimulatory molecule ICOS regulates the expression of c-Maf and IL-21 in the development of follicular T helper cells and TH-17 cells |journal=Nat Immunol |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=167–75 |date=Feb 2009 |pmid=19098919 |doi=10.1038/ni.1690 |last2=Jin |first2=H |last3=Paterson |first3=AM |last4=Mitsdoerffer |first4=M |last5=Ho |first5=IC |last6=Sharpe |first6=AH |last7=Kuchroo |first7=VK |pmc=2742982[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Vogelzang |title=A fundamental role for interleukin-21 in the generation of T follicular helper cells |journal=Immunity |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=127–37 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18602282 |doi=10.1016/j.immuni.2008.06.001 |last2=McGuire |first2=HM |last3=Yu |first3=D |last4=Sprent |first4=J |last5=MacKay |first5=CR |last6=King |first6=C[/tpl]  Also Bcl-6 is a transcription factor identified in TFH cells, but it may have roles that extend beyond this subset, because it has been implicated in memory CD8+ T cell development.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ichii et al. |title=Role for Bcl-6 in the generation and maintenance of memory CD8+ T cells |journal=Nat Immunol |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=558–63 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12021781 |doi=10.1038/ni802 |last2=Sakamoto |first2=A |last3=Hatano |first3=M |last4=Okada |first4=S |last5=Toyama |first5=H |last6=Taki |first6=S |last7=Arima |first7=M |last8=Kuroda |first8=Y |last9=Tokuhisa |first9=T|display-authors=9 [/tpl]

==Role of CD40L==

In germinal centers, antigen-experienced TFH cells rapidly upregulate the expression of CD40L, which binds with B cell surface protein CD40 in B cell-T cell zone vicinity.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kim|first=JR|coauthors=Lim, HW; Kang, SG; Hillsamer, P; Kim, CH|title=Human CD57+ germinal center-T cells are the major helpers for GC-B cells and induce class switch recombination.|journal=BMC immunology|date=Feb 4, 2005|volume=6|pages=3|pmid=15694005|doi=10.1186/1471-2172-6-3|pmc=548684[/tpl] The TFH cell CD40L and B cell CD40 crosstalk modulates the intracellular receptor and gene expression inside the B cell, including induction of AID (activation-induced (cytidine) deaminase).[tpl]cite journal|last=McHeyzer-Williams|first=M|coauthors=Okitsu, S; Wang, N; McHeyzer-Williams, L|title=Molecular programming of B cell memory.|journal=Nature reviews. Immunology|date=Dec 9, 2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=24–34|pmid=22158414|doi=10.1038/nri3128[/tpl] AID (AICDA) expression causes B cell antibodies to class switch from IgM/IgD to other antibody isotypes and drives somatic hypermutation during clonal proliferation. The switched antibodies acquire better effector functions, and hypermutated antibody shows greater affinity for antigen. The exact mechanism of AID-mediated B cell maturation is not clear.

==TFH and Cholera==

Vibrio cholerae infected patients and healthy human volunteers administered with existing cholera vaccine are recently studied in Bangladeshi population by Dr. Firdausi Qadri and her group. They have shown that the Memory TFH response is cholera antigen specific and has correlation with further antibody production by B cells.[tpl]cite journal|last=Arifuzzaman|first=M|coauthors=Rashu, R; Leung, DT; Hosen, MI; Bhuiyan, TR; Bhuiyan, MS; Rahman, MA; Khanam, F; Saha, A; Charles, RC; LaRocque, RC; Weil, AA; Clements, JD; Holmes, RK; Calderwood, SB; Harris, JB; Ryan, ET; Qadri, F|title=Antigen-specific memory T cell responses after vaccination with an oral killed cholera vaccine in Bangladeshi children and comparison to responses in patients with naturally acquired cholera.|journal=Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI|date=August 2012|volume=19|issue=8|pages=1304–11|pmid=22739692|doi=10.1128/CVI.00196-12|pmc=3416086[/tpl]

==Autoimmunity==

Finally, it has been shown that dysregulated TFH cells can cause systemic autoimmunity and auto-antibody production or contribute to T cell–mediated organ-specific autoimmunity.
