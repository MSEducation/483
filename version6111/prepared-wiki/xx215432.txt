==Regular season==

The club went undefeated through the season, but because the Montreal Shamrocks lost a Stanley Cup challenge to the Winnipeg Victorias, Ottawa did not win the Cup as a result of league play. At first, Ottawa was intending to challenge Winnipeg for the Cup, but on February 27, 1901 announced that they would not do so that winter.[tpl]Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=February 28, 1901 |title=Ottawa will not challenge |pages=10[/tpl] According to Coleman(1966), Ottawa did not issue a challenge due to the "lateness of the season."[tpl]cite book|title=The Trail of the Stanley Cup, Vol. 1, 1893–1926, inc.|last=Coleman|first=Charles|pages=62|year=1966[/tpl] The Ottawa Journal as reported in The Globe suggested that the Ottawa club was wise in their decision, as they were in "racked condition in which they are, as a result of the immensely hard exertions put forth by them in all their games this season".[tpl]Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=March 2, 1901 |pages=25 |title=Sound reasons for waiting[/tpl] The Ottawa Hockey Club did not challenge the following season, either.
