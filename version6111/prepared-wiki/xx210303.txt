The men's BMX cycling at the 2008 Summer Olympics took place on August 20–22 at the Laoshan BMX Field, the first to be officially featured in the Olympic cycling program.
Latvia's Māris Štrombergs powered his lead over the eight-strong final squad from the start to grab his nation's first ever gold medal at the Games. He stormed home on a sprint run to a spectacular finish in 36.190, leaving the American duo Mike Day and Donny Robinson far behind at 36.606 and 36.972 only for the silver and bronze medals respectively.[tpl]cite news|last=Thompson|first=Katherine|title=US Grabs BMX Silver, Bronze|url=http://www.newser.com/story/35521/us-grabs-bmx-silver-bronze.html|publisher=Newser|date=22 August 2008|accessdate=17 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Strombergs of Latvia wins first-ever Olympic men's BMX gold|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/olympics/2008-08/22/content_6961367.htm|work=Xinhua|publisher=China Daily|date=22 August 2008|accessdate=17 October 2013[/tpl]

==Qualification==

Thirty-two riders representing twenty countries are qualified for the event. Qualification was based on UCI ranking by nations, 2008 UCI BMX World Championships results and wild-cards reserved to a Tripartite Commission (IOC, ANOC, UCI).http://uci.ch/includes/asp/getTarget.asp?type=FILE&id=MzU5MTI

==Competition format==

Each of the 32 men competing performed two runs of the course in individual time trials to determine seeding for the knockout rounds. Then, they were grouped into 4 quarterfinal groups based on that seeding. Each quarterfinal consisted of three runs of the course, using a point-for-place system. The top four cyclists in each quarterfinal (for a total of 16) moved on to the semifinals. The semifinals also used a three-race point-for-place system to determine which cyclists advanced, with the top four in each of the two semifinals moving on to the final. Unlike the previous two rounds, the final consisted of a single race with the first to the finish line claiming the gold medal.[tpl]cite web|title=BMX Competition Format|url=http://www.2008.nbcolympics.com/cycling/insidethissport/format/newsid=104659.html#bmx+competition+format|work=Beijing 2008|publisher=NBC Olympics|accessdate=20 October 2013[/tpl]
