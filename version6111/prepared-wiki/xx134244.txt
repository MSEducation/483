Fraser Health Authority is one of six publicly funded health care Regions into which the Canadian province of British Columbia is divided.

==History==

Fraser Health was created in December 2001 as part of a province-wide restructuring of health authorities by the new government of Premier Gordon Campbell. It merged three former health regions: Simon Fraser Health Region (SFHR), South Fraser Health Region and the Fraser Valley Health Region (FVHR).
SFHR had been formed in 1996 by the merger of The Fraser-Burrard Hospital Society (Royal Columbian Hospital, Eagle Ridge Hospital and Ridge Meadows Hospital) with the Burnaby Health Region (Burnaby Hospital) and the extended care facilities operated by the Pacific Health Care Society (Queen's Park Care Centre and Fellburn Care Centre).  
It is governed by the provincial Health Authorities Act.

==Demographics==

It has 22,000 employees and serves the region from Boston Bar in the Fraser Canyon all the way down the Fraser River Valley to the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby. It is the largest health authority by population in British Columbia.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

==Governance==

The Board of Directors functions as Fraser Health's governing body, and oversees the conduct of the organization's business through the Executive Team, which is responsible for the day to day operations. Board members are appointed by the Minister of Health through the provincial Board Resourcing and Development Office. Prior to the 2001 regionalization, communities elected board representatives.
