===Laths stiffening the grip===

A new bow type, in which bone reinforcements cover the handle of the bow as well as the tips, may have developed in Central Asia during the 3rd to 2nd century BCE,Vadim V. Gorbunov, Aleksei A. Tishkin. “Weapons of the Gorny Altai Nomads in the Hunnu Age.” Archaeology, Ethnology & Anthropology of Eurasia 4/28 (2006): 79–85.

Such bows with reinforcement of both grip and siyahs have been called “Hun,” “Hunnic” or “Hsiung-nu” composite bows.Andrew Hall. “The development of the bone reinforced composite.” Journal of the Society of Archer-Antiquaries 49 (2006): 65–77."New Evidence about Composite Bows and Their Arrows in Inner Asia" Michaela R Reisinger in The Silk Road 8 (2010) 42-62. http://www.silkroadfoundation.org/newsletter/vol8/ Huns did use such bows, but so did many other peoples; Rausing termed this type the 'Qum-Darya Bow' from the Han Chinese type-site at the frontier post of Loulan, at the mouth of the Qum Darya river, dated by analogy between c. 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE.
With the arrival of the Huns, this tradition of bows with stiffened grips arrived in Europe. "Alanic graves in the Volga region dating to the 3rd to 4th century CE signal the adoption of the Qum-Darya type by Sarmatian peoples from Hunnic groups advancing from the East. In general, Hunnic/Qum-Darya bows had two pairs of ear laths identical in every respect to those found on Roman limes sites. The ear laths show only a greater proportion of longer laths (like those of Roman examples from Bar Hill and London). More distinctively, the grip of the bow was stiffened by three laths. On the sides were glued a pair of trapezoidal laths with their longest edges towards the back. On the belly was glued a third lath, varying in shape but often narrow with parallel sides and splayed ends. Therefore, each bow possessed seven grip and ear laths, compared with none on the Scythian and Sarmatian bows and four (ear) laths on the Yrzi bow."
Such bows were often asymmetric, with lower limbs shorter than the upper.Roman Military Equipment from the Punic Wars to the Fall of Rome (Paperback). M.C. Bishop, J.C. Coulston. Oxbow Books 2005. ISBN 978-1-84217-159-2[ref]

The Huns and their successors greatly impressed their neighbours with their archery. Germanic tribes transmitted their respect orally for a millennium; in the Scandinavian Hervarar saga, the Geatish king Gizur taunts the Huns and says, "Eigi gera Húnar oss felmtraða né hornbogar yðrir." (We fear neither the Huns nor their hornbows.) The Romans, as described in the Strategikon, Procopius's histories, and other works, changed the entire emphasis of their army, from heavy infantry to cavalry, many of them armed with bows. Maurikios's Strategikon describes the Byzantine cavalry as bow-armed cursores and lance-armed defensores.[tpl]cite journal |first=Charles C. |last=Petersen |title=The Strategikon: A Forgotten Military Classic |work=Military Review |date=August 1992 |url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/strategikon/strategikon.htm |accessdate=7 June 2011[/tpl]

===Additional stiffening laths===

The Qum-Darya bow was superseded in the modern area of Hungary by an 'Avar' type, with more and differently-shaped laths. The grip laths stayed essentially the same except that a fourth piece was sometimes glued to the back of the handle enclosing it with bone on all four faces. The belly lath was often parallel-sided with splayed ends. The siyah laths became much wider in profile above the nock and less rounded, giving a bulbous aspect. The nock was often further away from the upper end of the siyah than on Qum-Darya type examples. Additional laths were usually added to the belly and back of the siyah thus enclosing both ends of the stave on four faces. This made a total of up to 12 laths on an asymmetrical bow with stiff, set back handle. Examples measured in situ suggest bow lengths of 120–140 cm. When unstrung the siyahs reversed sharply forward at an angle of 50-60 degrees.

==Post-classical development==

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, armies of the Byzantine Empire maintained their tradition of horse archery for centuries. Byzantium finally fell to the Turks before the decline of military archery in favour of guns. Turkish armies included archers until about 1591 (they played a major role in the Battle of Lepanto (1571),[tpl]cite book |title=A History of Warfare |last=Keegan |first=John | authorlink=John Keegan |year=2004 |publisher=Pimlico |isbn=978-1-84413-749-7[/tpl] and flight archery remained a popular sport in Istanbul until the early 19th century.[tpl]cite book |title=Turkish Archery and the Composite Bow |edition=second |last=Klopsteg |first=Paul |publisher=author |location=2424 Lincolnwood Drive, Evanston, IL |isbn=[/tpl] Most surviving documentation of the use and construction of composite bows comes from China and the Middle East; until reforms early in the 20th century, skill with the composite bow was an essential part of the qualification for officers in the Chinese Imperial army. thumb|right|140px| A Saracen pirate holding a bow of the then-popular short Kipchak (Mameluk) design.
The composite bow was adopted throughout the Arab world, even though some Bedu tribesmen in the Hijaz retained the use of simple self bows. Persian designs were used after the conquest of the Sassanid Empire, and Turkish-type bows were widely used after the Turkic expansions. Roughly speaking, Arabs favoured slightly shorter siyahs and broader limbs than the Indo-Persian designs. Sometimes the protective cover on the back was painted with Arab calligraphy or geometric patterns. No design was standardized over the vast area of the Arab conquests. It was said that the best Arab composite bows were manufactured in Damascus, Syria. The first surviving treatise on composite bow construction and archery was written in Arabic under Mamluk rule about 1368.[tpl]cite book |title=Kitab ghunyat at-tullab fi marifat ramy an-mushshab |last= l-Ashrafi l-Maklamishi l-Yunani |first=Taybugha |year=1368 |language=Arabic |trans_title=Saracen Archery.

===Integral wooden siyahs===

Later developments in the composite bow included siyahs made of separate pieces of wood, attached with a V-splicehttp://www.atarn.org/chinese/Yanghai/Scythian_bow_ATARN.pdf. SCYTHIAN BOW FROM XINJANG. Adam Karpowicz and Stephen Selby. (first published in the Journal of the Society of Archer-Antiquaries, vol 53, 2010) Of a bow from the Yanghai Cemetery (1000-400BCE): "The splices were all scarf joints, not the common (or perhaps later) V-splice, often found in the composite bows. Since the V-splice requires a hand saw to cut the female part of the V, one can speculate the saws of sufficient quality were either unknown or not yet common in Central Asia at the time." to the wooden core of the bow, rather than strengthened by external reinforcement. Mediaeval and modern bows generally have integral wooden siyahs and lack stiffening laths.

===String bridges===

A string "bridge" or "run" is an attachment of horn or wood, used to hold the string a little further apart from the bow's limbs at the base of the siyahs, as well as allowing the siyah to rest at an angle forward of the string. This attachment may add weight, but might give a small increase in the speed of the arrow by increasing the initial string angle and therefore the force of the draw in its early stages. Large string bridges are characteristic of Manchu (Qing dynasty, 1644–1911) bows and late Mongolian bows, while small string bridges are characteristic of Korean, Crimean Tatar, and some Ming dynasty (1368–1644) bows.Archery Traditions of Asia.

==Modern living traditions of composite bows==

All Eurasian composite bows derive from the same nomad origins, but every culture that used them has made its own adaptations to the basic design. The Turkish, Mongolian, and Korean bows were standardized when archery lost its military function and became a popular sport.[tpl]cite book |title=Korean Traditional Archery |last=Duvernay |first=TA |authorlink= |coauthors=Duvernay NY |year=2007 |publisher=Handong Global University[/tpl] Recent Turkish bows are optimized for flight shooting.

===Turkish bow===

This is the Ottoman development of the composite bow, presumably brought from the steppes. Turkish bows evolved, after the decline of military archery, into probably the best traditional flight bows. Their decoration often included delicate and beautiful multicoloured designs with gold.

===Chinese bow===

For millennia, archery has played a pivotal role in Chinese history.[tpl]cite book |title=Chinese Archery |last=Selby |first=Stephen |year=2000 |publisher=Hong Kong University |isbn=978-962-209-501-4[/tpl] Because the cultures associated with Chinese society spanned a wide geography and time range, the techniques and equipment associated with Chinese archery are diverse. Historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest that a variety of bow designs existed throughout Chinese history.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Selby |first1=Stephen |last2= |first2= |year=2010 |title=The Bows of China |journal=Journal of Chinese Martial Studies |volume=Winter |issue=2 |pages= |publisher=Three-In-One Press[/tpl] For much of the 20th century, only one Chinese traditional bow and arrow making workshop was active.History of Ju Yuan Hao However, in the beginning of the 21st century, there has been revival in interest among craftsmen looking to construct bows and arrows in the traditional Chinese style.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chinaarchery.org/archives/94 |title=2009 Chinese Traditional Archery Seminar |author=Sherman |date=1 November 2009 |publisher=Folk Archery Federation of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=16 June 2011[/tpl]

===Mongol bow===

The Mongolian tradition of archery is attested by an inscription on a stone stele that was found near Nerchinsk in Siberia: "While Genghis Khan was holding an assembly of Mongolian dignitaries, after his conquest of Sartaul (Khwarezm), Yesüngge (the son of Genghis Khan's brother) shot a target at 335 alds (536 m)." The Mongol bowmaking tradition was lost under the Manchus, who forbade archery; the present bowmaking tradition emerged after independence in 1921 and is based on Manchu types of bow.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.atarn.org/mongolian/mn_nat_arch/mn_nat_arch.htm |title=Mongolian National Archery |author=Munkhtsetseg |date=18 July 2000 |work=INSTINCTIVE ARCHER MAGAZINE |publisher= |accessdate=16 June 2011[/tpl] Mounted archery had fallen into disuse and has been revived only in the 21st century.
Archery with composite bows is part of the annual festival of the three virile sports (Wrestling, Horseriding, Archery), called "Naadam".

===Hungarian bow===

The Hungarian bow is a fairly long, approximately symmetrical, composite reflex bow with bone stiffeners. Its shape is known from two graves in which the position of the bone plates could be reconstructed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.atarn.org/magyar/magyar_2/bow.htm |title=Hungarian Traditional Archery |author=Csikos Balint |date=1 May 2000 |publisher=ATARN.org |accessdate=15 June 2011[/tpl] Modern Hungarians have attempted to reconstruct the composite bows of their ancestors and have revived mounted archery as a competitive sport.

===Korean bow===

A traditional modern Korean bow, or gakgung, is a small but very efficient horn-bamboo-sinew composite bow. Korean archers normally practice at a range of approximately 145 metres.

===Perso-Parthian bow===

The Perso-Parthian bow is a symmetric recurve under high tension when strung. The "arms" of the bow are supposed to reflex far enough to cross each other when the bow is unstrung. The finished bow is covered by bark, fine leather, or in some cases shark skin to keep out moisture.
Perso-Parthian bows were in use as late as the 1820s in Persia (ancient Iran). They were then replaced by muskets.

==Analogous New World bows, modern replicas, alternative materials==

===American sinew-backed bows===

When Europeans first contacted Native Americans, some bows, especially in the area that became California, already had sinew backing. After the reintroduction of horses, newly mounted groups rapidly developed shorter bows, which were often given sinew backing. The full three-layer composite bow with horn, wood, and sinew does not seem to be recorded in the Americas, and horn bows with sinew backing are not recorded before European contact.[tpl]cite book |title=American Indian Archery |last=Laubin |first=Reginald |coauthors=Gladys Laubin |year=1980 |publisher=University of Oklahoma |isbn=978-0-8061-1467-5 |accessdate=[/tpl]

===Replicas made with modern materials===

Modern replicas of traditional composite bows are commercially available; they are usually made with fibreglass on both belly and back, easier to mass-produce and easier to take care of than traditional composite bows.
Other less satisfactory materials than horn have been used for the belly of the bow (the part facing the archer when shooting), including bone, antler, or compression-resistant woods such as osage orange, hornbeam, or yew. Materials that are strong under tension, such as silk, or tough wood, like hickory, have been used on the back of the bow (the part facing away from the archer when shooting).
