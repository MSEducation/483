Charles Auguste Émile Durand, known as Carolus-Duran (4 July 1837 – 17 February 1917), was a French painter and art instructor. He is noted for his stylish depictions of members of high society in Third Republic France.

==Biography==

Carolus-Duran was born in Lille.  He studied at the Lille Academy and then at the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 1861, he traveled to Italy and Spain for further study, especially devoting himself to the pictures of Velázquez. His dramatic painting Murdered, or The Assassination (1866), was one of his first successes, and is now in the Lille museum.
Carolus-Duran became best known as a portrait painter, and, as the head of one of the principal ateliers in Paris, a teacher of some of the most brilliant artists of the next generation who were his pupils. His painting Lady with the Glove (1869), a portrait of his wife, was bought for the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris.
In 1889, he was made a commander of the Legion of Honour. In 1890, he participated in the creation of the National Society of French Art (Société Nationale des Beaux Arts). He became a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1904, and in the next year, was appointed director of the French Academy in Rome to succeed Eugène Guillaume. He died in Paris.
