The bonus disc was accompanied by a separate booklet titled "22 Reasons Why A Band Shouldn't Put An Album Out In Its First Few Years." The booklet was written by the band and provided critical analysis for each track.
Guitarist Phil Leonard later said of the album, "I think we took a few too many dark alleys on Drive Through Charisma."[tpl]cite journal | author = Dino Scatena| title = Random Notes| journal = Australian Rolling Stone | issue = August 1994|pages = pg10| publisher = Tilmond Pty Ltd | location = Sydney, NSW [/tpl]
