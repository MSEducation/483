Tŷ Siamas is the 'National Centre for Folk music' in Wales, and is situated in Dolgellau.
Tŷ Siamas opened its doors to the public in Easter 2007 following extensive renovation and development of the old Neuadd Idris, which was formerly the market hall for the town of Dolgellau.
The centre houses an interactive exhibition which will allow visitors to experience Welsh music.  
Tŷ Siamas is the brain child of Dyfrig Siencyn, Emyr Lloyd, Huw Dylan Owen, Dan Moris, and Ywain Myfyr (chairman and an establisher of Sesiwn Fawr Dolgellau), and managed by Mabon ap Gwynfor.
The dream of establishing a National Centre for Folk Music in Wales was realised after Siamas Cyf, the company created by local volunteers to oversee the project, managed to secure £1.2 of public funding from Gwynedd County Council via their Local Regeneration Fund, (a fund of money awarded to local authorities by the Welsh Assembly); European Objective 1 regional aid; the old Welsh Development Agency now part of the Welsh Assembly Government's Department of Enterprise, Innovation and Networks; Cronfa Arbrofol Eryri, provided by Snowdonia National Park; and Cist Gwynedd, provided by the Economy and Regeneration Service of Gwynedd County Council.
The vision was to create a national centre for the folk music of Wales which would contribute to the understanding of Welsh heritage and the revival of Welsh culture, traditions and customs.
Tŷ Siamas are currently conducting a pilot project in local schools (Brithdir, Rhydymain and Dinas Mawddwy) with the poet Twm Morys on three old Welsh musical customs associated with the winter - Mari Lwyd, Calennig, and the Plygain.
