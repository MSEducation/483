[[SMC4]]

Structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 4 (SMC-4) also known as chromosome-associated polypeptide C (CAP-C) or XCAP-C homolog is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SMC4 gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Schmiesing JA, Ball AR Jr, Gregson HC, Alderton JM, Zhou S, Yokomori K | title = Identification of two distinct human SMC protein complexes involved in mitotic chromosome dynamics | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 95 | issue = 22 | pages = 12906–11 |date=Nov 1998 | pmid = 9789013 | pmc = 23650 | doi =10.1073/pnas.95.22.12906  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Nishiwaki T, Daigo Y, Kawasoe T, Nagasawa Y, Ishiguro H, Fujita M, Furukawa Y, Nakamura Y | title = Isolation and characterization of a human cDNA homologous to the Xenopus laevis XCAP-C gene belonging to the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family | journal = J Hum Genet | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 197–202 |date=Jun 1999 | pmid = 10319587 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s100380050142 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: SMC4 structural maintenance of chromosomes 4| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=10051| accessdate = [/tpl] SMC-4 is a  core subunit of condensin I and II, large protein complexes involved in chromosome condensation
