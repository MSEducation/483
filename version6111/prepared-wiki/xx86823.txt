</ref>  In nonconductors, the [[electron]]s are bound to [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s and are not free to move about the object as in conductors; however they can move a little within the molecules.  
If a positive charge is brought near a nonconductive object, the electrons in each molecule are attracted toward it, and move to the side of the molecule facing the charge, while the positive nuclei are repelled and move slightly to the opposite side of the molecule.  Since the negative charges are now closer to the external charge than the positive charges, their attraction is greater than the repulsion of the positive charges, resulting in a small net attraction of the molecule toward the charge.   This is called polarization, and the polarized molecules are called dipoles.  This effect is microscopic, but since there are so many molecules, it adds up to enough force to move a light object like Styrofoam.  This is the principle of operation of a pith-ball electroscope.[ref]
