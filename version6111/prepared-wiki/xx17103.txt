Welding is a fabrication or sculptural process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing coalescence. This is often done by melting the workpieces and adding a filler material to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to become a strong joint, with pressure sometimes used in conjunction with heat, or by itself, to produce the weld. This is in contrast with soldering and brazing, which involve melting a lower-melting-point material between the workpieces to form a bond between them, without melting the work pieces.
There are several different ways to weld, such as: Shielded Metal Arc Welding, Gas Tungsten Arc Welding, Tungsten Inert Gas and Metallic Inert Gas. MIG or Metallic Inert Gas involves a wire fed "gun" that feeds wire at an adjustable speed and sprays a shielding gas (generally pure Argon or a mix of Argon and CO2) over the weld puddle to protect it from the outside world. TIG or Tungsten Inert Gas involves a much smaller hand-held gun that has a tungsten rod inside of it. With most, you use a pedal to adjust your amount of heat and hold a filler metal with your other hand and slowly feed it. Stick welding or Shielded Metal Arc Welding has an electrode that has flux, the protectant for the puddle, around it. The electrode holder holds the electrode as it slowly melts away. Slag protects the weld puddle from the outside world. Flux-Core is almost identical to stick welding except once again you have a wire feeding gun, the wire has a thin flux coating around it that protects the weld puddle. 
Many different energy sources can be used for welding, including a gas flame, an electric arc, a laser, an electron beam, friction, and ultrasound. While often an industrial process, welding may be performed in many different environments, including open air, under water and in outer space. Welding is a potentially hazardous undertaking and precautions are required to avoid burns, electric shock, vision damage, inhalation of poisonous gases and fumes, and exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation.
Until the end of the 19th century, the only welding process was forge welding, which blacksmiths had used for centuries to join iron and steel by heating and hammering. Arc welding and oxyfuel welding were among the first processes to develop late in the century, and electric resistance welding followed soon after. Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as World War I and World War II drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods. Following the wars, several modern welding techniques were developed, including manual methods like shielded metal arc welding, now one of the most popular welding methods, as well as semi-automatic and automatic processes such as gas metal arc welding, submerged arc welding, flux-cored arc welding and electroslag welding. Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding, electron beam welding, electromagnetic pulse welding and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century. Today, the science continues to advance. Robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings, and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain greater understanding of weld quality.

==History==

The history of joining metals goes back several millennia. Called forge welding, the earliest examples come from the Bronze and Iron Ages in Europe and the Middle East. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus states in The Histories of the 5th century BC that Glaucus of Chios "was the man who single-handedly invented iron-welding".Herodotus. The Histories. Trans. R. Waterfield. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Book One, 25. Welding was used in the construction of the iron pillar in Delhi, India, erected about 310 AD and weighing 5.4 metric tons.[tpl]harvnb|Cary|Helzer|2005|p=4[/tpl]
The Middle Ages brought advances in forge welding, in which blacksmiths pounded heated metal repeatedly until bonding occurred. In 1540, Vannoccio Biringuccio published De la pirotechnia, which includes descriptions of the forging operation.Lincoln Electric, p. 1.1-1 Renaissance craftsmen were skilled in the process, and the industry continued to grow during the following centuries. 
In 1801, Sir Humphrey Davy discovered the electrical arc.Lincoln Electric, The Procedure Handbook Of Arc Welding 14th ed., page 1.1-1 In 1802, Russian scientist Vasily Petrov also discovered the electric arc[tpl]Citation | last = Lazarev | first = P.P. | title = Historical essay on the 200 years of the development of natural sciences in Russia | journal = Physics-Uspekhi | volume = 42 | issue = 1247 | pages = 1351–1361 |date = December 1999| url = http://ufn.ru/ufn99/ufn99_12/Russian/r9912h.pdf | format = Russian | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5lmBpznUV | archivedate = 2009-12-04 | doi = 10.1070/PU1999v042n12ABEH000750 | postscript =.[/tpl] and subsequently[tpl]when|date=November 2013[/tpl] proposed possible practical applications such as welding. In 1881–82, a Russian inventor Nikolai Benardos and Polish Stanisław OlszewskiNikołaj Benardos, Stanisław Olszewski, "Process of and apparatus for working metals by the direct application of the electric current" patent nr 363 320, Washington, United States Patent Office, 17 may 1887. created the first electric arc welding method known as carbon arc welding; they used carbon electrodes. The advances in arc welding continued with the invention of metal electrodes in the late 1800s by a Russian, Nikolai Slavyanov (1888), and an American, C. L. Coffin (1890). Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger released a coated metal electrode in Britain, which gave a more stable arc. In 1905, Russian scientist Vladimir Mitkevich proposed using a three-phase electric arc for welding. In 1919, alternating current welding was invented by C. J. Holslag but did not become popular for another decade.[tpl]harvnb|Cary|Helzer|2005|pp=5–6[/tpl]
Resistance welding was also developed during the final decades of the 19th century, with the first patents going to Elihu Thomson in 1885, who produced further advances over the next 15 years. Thermite welding was invented in 1893, and around that time another process, oxyfuel welding, became well established. Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy, but its use was not practical in welding until about 1900, when a suitable torch was developed.[tpl]harvnb|Cary|Helzer|2005|p=6[/tpl] At first, oxyfuel welding was one of the more popular welding methods due to its portability and relatively low cost. As the 20th century progressed, however, it fell out of favor for industrial applications. It was largely replaced with arc welding, as metal coverings (known as flux) for the electrode that stabilize the arc and shield the base material from impurities continued to be developed.Weman, p. 26
World War I caused a major surge in the use of welding processes, with the various military powers attempting to determine which of the several new welding processes would be best. The British primarily used arc welding, even constructing a ship, the Fulagar, with an entirely welded hull. Arc welding was first applied to aircraft during the war as well, as some German airplane fuselages were constructed using the process.Lincoln Electric, p. 1.1–5 Also noteworthy is the first welded road bridge in the world, the Maurzyce Bridge designed by Stefan Bryła of the Lwów University of Technology in 1927, and built across the river Słudwia near Łowicz, Poland in 1928.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weldinghistory.org/whistoryfolder/welding/wh_1900-1950.html|title=Welding Timeline 1900–1950|last=Sapp|first=Mark E.|date=February 22, 2008|publisher=WeldingHistory.org|accessdate=2008-04-29[/tpl]
During the 1920s, major advances were made in welding technology, including the introduction of automatic welding in 1920, in which electrode wire was fed continuously. Shielding gas became a subject receiving much attention, as scientists attempted to protect welds from the effects of oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. Porosity and brittleness were the primary problems, and the solutions that developed included the use of hydrogen, argon, and helium as welding atmospheres.[tpl]harvnb|Cary|Helzer|2005|p=7[/tpl] During the following decade, further advances allowed for the welding of reactive metals like aluminum and magnesium. This in conjunction with developments in automatic welding, alternating current, and fluxes fed a major expansion of arc welding during the 1930s and then during World War II.Lincoln Electric, p. 1.1–6
During the middle of the century, many new welding methods were invented. 1930 saw the release of stud welding, which soon became popular in shipbuilding and construction. Submerged arc welding was invented the same year and continues to be popular today. In 1932 a Russian, Konstantin Khrenov successfully implemented the first underwater electric arc welding. Gas tungsten arc welding, after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941, and gas metal arc welding followed in 1948, allowing for fast welding of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases. Shielded metal arc welding was developed during the 1950s, using a flux-coated consumable electrode, and it quickly became the most popular metal arc welding process. In 1957, the flux-cored arc welding process debuted, in which the self-shielded wire electrode could be used with automatic equipment, resulting in greatly increased welding speeds, and that same year, plasma arc welding was invented. Electroslag welding was introduced in 1958, and it was followed by its cousin, electrogas welding, in 1961.[tpl]harvnb|Cary|Helzer|2005|p=9[/tpl] In 1953 the Soviet scientist N. F. Kazakov proposed the diffusion bonding method.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2005/Amir/bond.html|title=Diffusion Bonding of Materials|last= Kazakov |first= N.F|year=1985|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=2011-01-13[/tpl]
Other recent developments in welding include the 1958 breakthrough of electron beam welding, making deep and narrow welding possible through the concentrated heat source. Following the invention of the laser in 1960, laser beam welding debuted several decades later, and has proved to be especially useful in high-speed, automated welding. Electromagnetic pulse welding is industrially used since 1967. Friction stir welding was invented in 1991 by Wayne Thomas at The Welding Institute (TWI, UK) and found high-quality applications all over the world.[tpl]cite book|author=Mel Schwartz|title=Innovations in Materials Manufacturing, Fabrication, and Environmental Safety|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rpCs0AoQOBoC&pg=PA300|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=2011|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-8215-9|pages=300–[/tpl] All of these four new processes continue to be quite expensive due the high cost of the necessary equipment, and this has limited their applications.Lincoln Electric, pp. 1.1–10

==Processes==

===Arc===

These processes use a welding power supply to create and maintain an electric arc between an electrode and the base material to melt metals at the welding point. They can use either direct (DC) or alternating (AC) current, and consumable or non-consumable electrodes. The welding region is sometimes protected by some type of inert or semi-inert gas, known as a shielding gas, and filler material is sometimes used as well.

====Power supplies====

To supply the electrical power necessary for arc welding processes, a variety of different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc is directly related to the voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.[tpl]harvnb|Cary|Helzer|2005|pp=246–249[/tpl]
The type of current used also plays an important role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode has an impact on weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds.Kalpakjian and Schmid, p. 780 Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds.Lincoln Electric, p. 5.4–5 Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.Weman, p. 16

====Processes====

One of the most common types of arc welding is shielded metal arc welding (SMAW);Weman, p. 63 it is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMA) or stick welding. Electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and consumable electrode rod, which is made of filler material (typically steel) and is covered with a flux that protects the weld area from oxidation and contamination by producing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas during the welding process. The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary.
The process is versatile and can be performed with relatively inexpensive equipment, making it well suited to shop jobs and field work.[tpl]harvnb|Cary|Helzer|2005|p=103[/tpl] An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve mastery with experience. Weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though special electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron, nickel, aluminum, copper, and other metals.
