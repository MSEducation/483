The following article lists  stadiums used presently or in the past for rugby union in Australia.

==Overview==

While these stadiums are occasionally used by rugby union, none except Ballymore could be described as "rugby union grounds" per se. All are used principally for rugby league and/or Australian rules football. Several of these stadiums, primarily those with rectangular fields, are also used for soccer.
Stadiums used by the defunct Australian Rugby Championship and the 2003 Rugby World Cup are included for posterity.

===Present Grounds===

===Former Grounds===

These grounds have been used in the past, but don't host club or international fixtures (used less frequently than once a year).
