The park was part of Goongarrie Station that was purchased by the state government in 1995. The area also includes the abandoned townsite of Goongarrie. The name comes from nearby Lake Gongarrie which is Indigenous Australian in origin and of unknown meaning.
Infrastructure in the park was upgraded in 2007 after it received $70,000 in funding from the government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/content/view/2446/1560/|title=Department of Environment - $180,000 for Goldfields Park Facilities|year=2006|accessdate=5 June 2010[/tpl]
The park is dominated by arid zone woodlands and is situated along the mulga-eucalypt line. Species of acacia and eucalypt make up the bulk of the vegetation. The southern end of Lake Marmion can be found at the northern end of the park along with many smaller salt lakes and clay pans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kalgoorlietourism.com/NR/exeres/32995C68-6E56-4DF8-802E-FA41A6ED58D1.htm|title=Kalgoorlie Visitor Centre - Parks and Nature Reserves|year=2009|accessdate=5 June 2010[/tpl]
