[tpl]Unicode|ǃGãǃne[/tpl] (!Gã!nge) is an extinct language of the ǃKwi family, once spoken near Tsolo and in Umtata District in South Africa, south of Lesotho. The only material on the language is 140 words collected from two semi-speakers (rememberers) in 1931.Anthony Traill, "The Khoisan Languages of South Africa", in Rajend Mesthrie, ed., 1995, Language and Social History: Studies in South African Sociolinguistics
Like [tpl]Unicode|ǁXegwi[/tpl], [tpl]Unicode|ǃGãǃne[/tpl] is considered an "outlier" among the !Kwi languages by Güldemann (2005, 2011).  Ethnologue counts it as a dialect of Seroa,[tpl]e17|kqu|Seroa[/tpl] though the two have no demonstrable connection apart from being in the !Kwi family.
