Agorius is a genus of the spider family Salticidae (jumping spiders).
Undescribed species have been found in Malaysia and Sabah.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 303 No new species were described for about one hundred years, with two new species found in the early 2000s.
The genera Agorius and Synagelides (and perhaps Pseudosynagelides) are sometimes separated as a genus group, called subfamily Agoriinae Simon, 1901.Sz≈±ts, 2003 Several more species have been found but not yet described.J. Proszynski: Provisional notes on genus Agorius

==Description==

Both sexes are about six to eight mm long. Agorius is similar to Myrmarachne another good ant mimic, but can be distinguished from it by having no large, forward-pointing chelicerae, and is not found on vegetation above the ground, but only in rain forest leaf litter.
A. borneensis, A. formicinus and A. semirufus are only known from male specimens, A. cinctus and A. gracilipes only from a female.Platnick 2007
