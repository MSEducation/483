The Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) are a group of 13 public, autonomous institutes of management education and research in India. The establishment of IIMs was initiated by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, based on the recommendation of the Planning Commission.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |title=Report of IIM Review Committee |author=RC Bhargava, Ajit Balakrishnan, Anusua Basu, Ram S.

===Proposed IIM Bill===

Since IIMs are not full-fledged universities, they do not give degrees. But the post graduate diplomas and fellowships granted by IIMs are considered as equivalent to Master's degrees and Doctorates, respectively. However, the Government of India is considering a legislative proposal to give IIMs the legal authority to grant degrees. Kapil Sibal, the Union Minister of Human Resource Development of India, has asked officials to prepare an Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Bill that empowers IIMs to give degrees.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-04/india/33581224_1_three-iims-institutes-of-management-bill-bangalore-and-kolkata|title=IIMs may get legislative cover, award degrees |author=Akshaya Mukul |accessdate=4 September 2012 |publisher=The times of India |date=4 September 2012 [/tpl]http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/the-iim-bill-will-makeiims-more-holistic-debashis-chatterjee/496168/[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/education/college-and-university/making-iims-inclusive/article4184192.ece | location=Chennai, India | deadurl=yes | work=The Hindu | first=G. | last=Krishnakumar | title=Making IIMs inclusive | date=10 December 2012[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-07/news/36971344_1_iim-a-management-ahmedabad-award-degrees | work=The Times Of India | title=IIM-A opposes bringing IIMs under umbrella body | date=7 February 2013[/tpl]http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/GUJ-AHD-new-iim-bill-limits-state-govt---s-role-in-decision-making-process-4173526-NOR.html[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-07/news/36971309_1_iim-a-society-iim-a-campus-vijaya-sherry-chand | work=The Times Of India | title=Industry, IIM alumni against govtâ€™s control plan[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-07/news/36971267_1_iim-a-society-iim-a-brand-chairman-of-iim-a-board | work=The Times Of India | title=Spare IIM-Ahmedabad from bill: A M Naik[/tpl] The Bill plans expansion of the powers of the IIM Council as a coordinating body for the IIMs. However, the IIM Council will not have power to impose its decisions on Indian Institutes of Management, according to the human resource development ministry, allaying fears that a new law will erode the autonomy of the country's premier B-schools.[tpl]cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/IIM-Council-will-not-have-powers-to-override-institutes-unlike-the-IIT-Council/articleshow/18493882.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=IIM Council will not have powers to override institutes, unlike the IIT Council - The Times of India[/tpl] A final decision on this matter will be taken in Monsoon Session of Indian Parliament in July / August of 2013. http://www.livemint.com/Politics/DiPHFq1bvTJY9XeLLLKcnJ/Council-will-not-endanger-autonomy-of-IIMs-Govt.htmlhttp://www.deccanherald.com/content/312005/iim-council-not-affect-autonomy.htmlhttp://dailypioneer.com/nation/127590-raju-to-persuade-iim-a-into-backing-degree-legislation.html

==History==

After India became independent in 1947, the Planning Commission was entrusted to oversee and direct the development of the nation. India grew rapidly in the 1950s, and in the late 1950s the Commission started facing difficulties in finding suitable managers for the large number of public sector enterprises that were being established in India as a part of its industrial policy. To solve this problem, the Planning Commission in 1959 invited Professor George Robbins of the University of California to help in setting up an All India Institute of Management Studies. Based on his recommendations, the Indian government decided to set up two elite management institutes, named Indian Institutes of Management. Calcutta (now Kolkata) and Ahmedabad were chosen as the locations for the two new institutes.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |title=Report of IIM Review Committee |author=RC Bhargava, Ajit Balakrishnan, Anusua Basu, Ram S Tarneja, Ashok Thakur |accessdate=19 March 2010 |publisher=GOVERNMENT OF INDIA: MINISTRY OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT |date=25 September 2008[/tpl]
The institute at Calcutta was established first, on 13 November 1961,[tpl]cite news| title = Q&A: Shekhar Chaudhury, Director, IIM Calcutta| author = Swati Garg| url= http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/qa-shekhar-chaudhury-director-iim-calcutta/435269/ |publisher=Business Standard |location=Kolkata |date=12 May 2011[/tpl] and was named Indian Institute of Management Calcutta or IIM Calcutta. It was set up in collaboration with the MIT Sloan School of Management, the government of West Bengal, the Ford Foundation and the Indian industry.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.iimcal.ac.in/about-iimc |title=About IIMC |author= |accessdate=23 February 2012 |publisher=Indian Institute of Management Calcutta |date=[/tpl] The institute at Ahmedabad was established in the following month and was named Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad. Like MIT Sloan in the case of IIM Calcutta, Harvard Business School played an important role in the initial stages of IIM Ahmedabad.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/institute/about.html |title=About IIMA |author= |accessdate=23 February 2012 |publisher=Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad |date=[/tpl]
In 1972, a committee headed by Ravi J. Matthai took note of the success of two established IIMs and recommended the setting up of two more IIMs. Based on the committee's recommendation, a new IIM was established in Bangalore (IIM Bangalore) the next year,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iimb.ernet.in/about-iimb/history |title=History | Indian Institute of Management Bangalore |work=iimb.ernet.in |accessdate=18 August 2011[/tpl] and was originally intended to cater exclusively to the needs of public sector enterprises. In 1981, the first IIM Review Committee was convened to examine the progress of the three existing IIMs and to make recommendations. The committee noted that the three IIMs were producing around 400 PGP graduates every year and that they had reached their optimum capacity. It proposed the opening of two more IIMs to meet the rising demand of management professionals. It also recommended expanding the Fellowship programmes to meet the growing demand of faculty in management schools in India. The fourth IIM (IIM Lucknow) was established in 1984 based on the committee's recommendation.
Two more IIMs were established in Kozhikode (IIM Kozhikode) and Indore (IIM Indore) in 1996. Since 2007, seven new IIMs have been set up, taking the total number of IIMs to 13.

==Academics==

The IIMs mainly offer postgraduate, doctoral and executive education programmes. Some of the programmes offered by all IIMs are similar; however, some IIMs offer unique programmes for specialised purposes.

===Postgraduate education===

All IIMs offer a two-year full-time Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGP). This programme is considered the flagship programme of IIMs, and awards the Post Graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) to successful candidates. This diploma is equivalent to the Master of Business Administration (MBA) postgraduate degree. This programme usually starts in June and runs till April of the second year. The PGP is a general, fully integrated management programme with no specialisation, and typically includes courses in Accounting, Behavioural sciences, Finance, Economics, Human Resource Management (HRM), Management Sciences and Information Technology, Marketing, Business operations, Business Mathematics, Public Policy, Statistics and Decision Analysis, Strategy and General Management. It is usually structured into six trimesters spread across two years. The first year coursework generally consists of core courses in various management disciplines, while in the second year students are allowed to select courses from an exhaustive list of electives.
Since 2006, some IIMs have started offering flagship one-year full-time post graduate diploma programmes for professionals having approx. 5 years of experience or more. This program was necessitated because the normal 2 year program is primarily aimed at fresh graduates or graduates with less than 4-5 years of work experience. These 1 years programmes are general, fully integrated management programmes with no specialization, and typically includes courses in Accounting, Behavioural sciences, Finance, Economics, Human Resource Management (HRM), Management Sciences and Information Technology, Marketing, Business operations, Business Mathematics, Public Policy, Statistics and Decision Analysis, Strategy and General Management like a typical 2 year MBA program. These intensive programmes typically require 75 credits or around 750 hours of class room teaching along with projects and other course work as in a normal global 2 year MBA program.http://www.business-standard.com/article/management/rigour-of-a-global-2-year-mba-in-one-year-113011600095_1.html Business Standard| 18 August 2011
Designed as a regular MBA programme which focuses on using the prior experience of the class, the one year MBA is named differently by different IIMs. It's called the Post Graduate Program for Executives by IIM Calcutta (PGPEX in short), IIM Ahmedabad (PGPX) and IIM Ranchi (PGEXP), Executive Post Graduate Programme (EPGP) by IIM Bangalore and IIM Indore,  International Programme in Management for Executives (IPMX) by IIM Lucknow and . The exact structure, admission criteria and other details vary for these programmes. However, all these programmes admit only candidates with approx. 5 or more years of professional experience and usually use a combination of GMAT score, essays and personal interviews as the entry criteria similar to other globally reputed MBA programmes. The median GMAT score of the batches at IIM Bangalore is usually around 710. http://www.iimb.ernet.in/postgraduate/epgp/admission/information | 18 August 2011
IIM Calcutta offers a Post Graduate Diploma in Computer aided Management (PGDCM) programme. This course, which was started in 1994, is similar to the regular PGDM programme, but with a special emphasis on Information technology and its business applications. It is aimed at creating business professionals who know how to apply Information and communication technology (ICTs) in business management. Most of the PGDCM coursework is integrated with the regular PGDM framework, and both PGDM & PGDCM are considered as part of the PGP programme. IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Lucknow offer a two-year Post Graduate Programme in Agribusiness Management (PGP-ABM) programme. This is essentially a MBA programme with a specialisation in Agribusiness. IIM Ranchi offers a post graduate programme specialized in Human Resources, called the Post Graduate Diploma in Human Resource Management (PGDHRM). http://www.iimranchi.ac.in/?page_id=1014 
Since July 2005, IIM Lucknow is also offering the Three Year Post-Graduate Programme in Management for Working Executives (also known as Working Managers Programme) from its Noida Campus. It aims at developing strong conceptual fundamentals and skills required to manage businesses of the future. The WMP aims to help to inculcate leadership and teamwork amongst participants, and foster the development of change agents to take leadership roles in the global area.http://www.iiml.ac.in/post_graduate_program_wmp.html  Indian Institute of Management Lucknow | 18 August 2011
IIM Calcutta offers a specialised executive MBA programme called the Post Graduate Programme for Executives for Visionary Leadership in Manufacturing (PGPEX-VLM) jointly with IIT Kanpur and IIT Madras. It is a one-year, rigorous programme with a heavy focus on the manufacturing sector.

===Doctoral education===

The Fellow Programme in Management (FPM) of IIMs is a full-time Doctoral level programme in management. This programme is aimed at preparing students for careers in teaching or research in different disciplines of management, as well as for careers outside academics that demand a high degree of research and analytical abilities. A student who completes this programme at any IIM, where (s)he is registered as a doctoral scholar, is awarded the title of Fellow of that institute (e.g. Fellow of the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta). This Fellow Program is equivalent to the Doctor of Philosophy degree.

===Reservation policy===

IIMs also follow the affirmative action policy as per the provisions of the Indian constitution. As per the provisions, 15% of the seats are reserved for students of Scheduled Castes, and 7.5% seats for Scheduled Tribes. The Other Backward Classes have also been given 27% reservation since 2008 after the Supreme Court of India upheld the validity of government regulation. It is being implemented in a phased manner due to resource constraints. All aspirants have to appear for Common Admission Test which consists of an Objective type Exam, Group Discussion and Personal Interviews, though the requirements for reserved category candidates can be lower than the general cut-off standard. Once admitted to the course, a reserved category student also has to meet all the criteria for completing the course as a General category student. Regular counselling sessions, extra-classes and tutorials from senior students for needy students are a regular feature of IIMs.http://www.mbauniverse.com/article.php?id=3613[tpl]cite web|title=IIM USA|url=http://www.iimusa.org/|work=iimusa.org|accessdate=17 February 2012[/tpl] IIMs also provide financial support to the needy and deserving students in the form of scholarships.[tpl]cite web|title=IIM Society|url=https://sites.google.com/a/iim-alumni.org/www/home|work=iim-alumni.org|accessdate=17 February 2012[/tpl]
