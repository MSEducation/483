</ref> Due to the high electricity demand, California imports more electricity than any other state, primarily hydroelectric power from states in the Pacific Northwest (via [[Path 15]] and [[Path 66]]) and coal- and natural gas-fired production from the desert Southwest via [[Path 46]].<ref>[tpl]cite web|url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=CA |title=California â€“ U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) |publisher=Tonto.eia.doe.gov |date=October 20, 2011 |accessdate=October 28, 2011[/tpl]</ref>
As a result of the state's strong environmental movement, California has some of the most aggressive renewable energy goals in the United States, with a target for California to obtain a third of its electricity from renewables by 2020.California OKs new transmission for renewables Reuters, December 17, 2009. Currently, several solar power plants such as the Solar Energy Generating Systems facility are located in the Mojave Desert. California's wind farms include Altamont Pass, San Gorgonio Pass, and Tehachapi Pass. Several dams across the state provide hydro-electric power.
The state's crude oil and natural gas deposits are located in the Central Valley and along the coast, including the large Midway-Sunset Oil Field. Natural gas-fired power plants typically account for more than one-half of State electricity generation.
California is also home to two major nuclear power plants: Diablo Canyon and San Onofre. However, voters banned the approval of new nuclear power plants since the late 1970s because of concerns over radioactive waste disposal.[ref]
