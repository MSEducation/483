==Function==

This gene encodes a PDZ domain-containing protein. PDZ motifs are modular protein-protein interaction domains consisting of 80-120 amino acid residues. PDZ domain-containing proteins interact with each other in cytoskeletal assembly or with other proteins involved in targeting and clustering of membrane proteins. The protein encoded by this gene interacts with alpha-actinin-2 through its N-terminal PDZ domain and with protein kinase C via its C-terminal LIM domains. The LIM domain is a cysteine-rich motif defined by 50-60 amino acids containing two zinc-binding modules. This protein also interacts with all three members of the myozenin family. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified; all isoforms have N-terminal PDZ domains while only longer isoforms (1 and 2) have C-terminal LIM domains.

==Clinical significance==
