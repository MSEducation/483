McKinnon returned to politics after meeting then Governor George W. Bush at a dinner at the governor’s mansion.  Following this encounter, McKinnon and Bush developed a personal relationship. According to Karl Rove, "Bush and McKinnon clicked from moment one.  In a bow to McKinnon's cool image, Bush dubbed him "M-Kat."Rove, K: Courage and Consequence, page 119. Threshold Editions, 2010.  Of his relationship with Bush, McKinnon said,  “We had a personal relationship before we had a professional relationship.  And when Texas’ Democratic lieutenant governor Bob Bullock endorsed Bush over the Democratic gubernatorial nominee — his own god-son — well that’s when I crossed the bridge.  But it was not an easy decision.”Bush Consultant Mark McKinnon: Obama hasn't gotten all ideological"/> In his autobiography, Karl Rove says that Bob Bullock actually recommended McKinnon to handle Bush's advertising.Rove, K: Courage and Consequence, page 118. Threshold Editions, 2010.  During a Frontline interview describing the former president’s ascendance into the national political arena, McKinnon said, “this Governor Bush was doing some things that really got my attention. He was talking about education reform. He was talking about immigration reform. He was talking about issues that had typically been Democratic issues. He was talking about them in a really compassionate way.’’[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/architect/interviews/mckinnon.html |title=The Architect – Karl Rove – Interview with Mark McKinnon |publisher=pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-25[/tpl] McKinnon said that he was particularly “impressed with how he’d gotten ahead of the Republican Party.”
Shortly after this initial meeting, McKinnon joined President Bush’s first presidential campaign as the chief media advisor, directing the advertising effort in 2000, a role he would reprise in the 2004 elections. President Bush appointed McKinnon to serve as a member of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the independent, autonomous entity responsible for all U.S. government sponsored, non-military, international broadcasting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/guest/view/2707 |title=Mark McKinnon Interview on Charlie Rose |publisher=charlierose.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-01[/tpl]  McKinnon began serving as the principal media advisor for Senator McCain’s presidential bid for the Republican primaries in January, 2007, but decided to leave the campaign on May 21, 2008.  Regarding his decision, McKinnon stated that he preferred not to campaign against Illinois Senator Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic Party nominee for president because Obama's election "would send a great message to the country and the world."[tpl]cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/05/mccain.html |title=Mark McKinnon, true to vow, exits McCain team rather than fight Obama |publisher=latimesblogs.latimes.com |date= 2008-05-20|accessdate=2010-04-08[/tpl] In leaving his advising role, McKinnon said he preferred to be a “fan, friend, and cheerleader” for McCain’s campaign,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rory-oconnor/nbc-wrong-on-mccainmckinn_b_121555.html |title=NBC Wrong on McCain/McKinnon Claim |publisher=huffingtonpost.com |date= 2008-09-27|accessdate=2010-02-21 |first=Rory |last=Oconnor[/tpl] but preferred not to be the “tip of the spear in attacking him (Obama)”.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-07-04/how-her-mind-works/ |title=How Her Mind Works |publisher=huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23[/tpl]
On August 27, 2008, the Dallas Morning News reported that McKinnon helped Cindy McCain in her preparation for her GOP convention speech.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/politics/national/stories/0826dnpol-mckinnon.1642d2cb.html |title="Texas consultant Mark McKinnon, who quit McCain campaign, lends Cindy McCain a hand", Dallas Morning News, August 27, 2008 |publisher=Dallasnews.com |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2009-07-01[/tpl] At this time McKinnon clarified that he was not in fact  "returning" to his role as media advisor to the McCain campaign, but that he was instead helping the McCains out of his "friendship" to them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/politics/national/stories/0826dnpol-mckinnon.1642d2cb.html |title="Texas consultant Mark McKinnon, who quit McCain campaign, lends Cindy McCain a hand", Dallas Morning News, August 27, 2008 |publisher=Dallasnews.com |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2010-04-20[/tpl]  Rory O'Connor from the Huffington Post reported NBC had actually reported incorrectly on McKinnon's role in the McCain campaign.  According to O'Connor McKinnon felt that he was keeping true to his pledge in not attacking Obama by only "acting as a facilitator to help with Cindy's speech. That means helping to identify speechwriters, Mari Will and Lionel Chetwynd, and working with them and Cindy on the speech." O'Connor also noted that McKinnon stated that he was not helping the McCain campaign with advertising.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rory-oconnor/nbc-wrong-on-mccainmckinn_b_121555.html |title="NBC Wrong on McKinnon/McCain Campaign", Huffington Post, August 27, 2008 |publisher=huffingtonpost.com |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2010-04-20 |first=Rory |last=Oconnor[/tpl]
Although it was also reported by Vanity Fair that McKinnon had returned to the McCain campaign to prep Sarah Palin for the United States vice-presidential debate, 2008,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/08/sarah-palin200908?currentPage=2 |title="It Came From Wasilla" Vanity Fair, August, 2009 |publisher=vanityfair.com |accessdate=2009-07-09[/tpl] in their recent reportorial book Game Change, journalists John Heilemann and Mark Halperin suggest that McKinnon was extremely reluctant to help coach Palin for the debate.  According to these political journalists, "(Rick) Davis had pleaded with Mark McKinnon, who had decided to sit out the general election because he wanted no part of flaying Obama, to ride to their rescue; he agreed, but just for that one night."  Heileman, J. and Halperin, M.: Game Change, page 404. Harper Collins, 2010.  In Game Change it is reported that McKinnon was not impressed with Palin's performance during the run-through before the debate.  When one of McCain's campaign advisors asked him what he thought about Palin's practice runs, McKinnon replied "Oh.My.God." On September 27, 2008, the Sunday Telegraph and UPI both cited McKinnon's defense of the McCain team's hiring multiple former Bush staffers as advisors to Sarah Palin: "There aren't a lot of experienced, skilled political operatives around who can work at the presidential level.... And of those that are available on the Republican side, almost all of them worked for George Bush. It would be very hard to put together a presidential team on the Republican side without hiring former Bush hands."[tpl]cite news|last=Sherwell |first=Philip |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/presidentialdebates/3091724/Vice-presidential-debate-Sarah-Palin-relies-on-Bush-veterans-for-her-big-day.html |title=Sunday Telegraph (September 27, 2008) "Vice-presidential debate: Sarah Palin relies on Bush veterans for her big day" |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2008-09-27 |accessdate=2009-07-01 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/09/27/Report_Bush_veterans_prep_Palin/UPI-13751222536498/ |title=(September 27, 2008) "Report: Bush veterans prep Palin" |publisher=UPI.com |date=2008-09-27 |accessdate=2009-07-01[/tpl]
