Staf De Clercq (16 September 1884 â€“ 22 October 1942) was a Flemish nationalist collaborator, co-founder and leader of the Flemish nationalist Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond (Flemish National League, or VNV).

==Biography==

He was born as Jeroom Gustaaf De Clercq in Everbeek, East Flanders on 16 September 1884. He was a member of the moderate Frontpartij, became party leader in 1932, and moved them to the right, converting them into VNV the following year.John T. Ishiyama & Marijke Breuning, Ethnopolitics in the New Europe, Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1998, p. 112-3 In 1936 his new party gained 13.6% of the votes in Flanders, and 14.7% in 1939.
Welcoming of the Nazi German occupation, De Clercq believed it to constitute a chance for the creation of a Diets state, an unprecedented (apart from the medieval Burgundian personal union) Dutch language-based community uniting Flanders, the Netherlands and even the part of northern France with Flemish dialects (corresponding to French Flanders). Aside from this unlikely project, he was a violent anti-semite, and his organization supported the German occupiers in the identification and round-up of Jews for deportation.
He died in Ghent and was succeeded by Hendrik Elias. In 1978 the Vlaamse Militanten Orde, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group, had his body transferred to the cemetery in Asse.
