The Mount Lyell Remediation and Research and Demonstration Program was a joint program between the Supervising Scientist Australia and the  Department of Environment and Land Management, Tasmania to clean up the King River, Queen River and Macquarie Harbour following 100 years of mine waste and town waste from Queenstown  being emptied into the rivers.
It was conducted after the closing of the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company in 1994, and most reports were produced by 1996. At the time of the final report it was claimed that the program was
