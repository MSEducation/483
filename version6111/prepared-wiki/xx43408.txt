Euxenite or euxenite-(Y) (a correct mineralogical name) is a brownish black mineral with a metallic luster. 

==Chemistry==

It contains calcium, niobium, tantalum, cerium, titanium, yttrium, and typically uranium and thorium, with some other metals. The chemical formula is: (Y,Ca,Ce,U,Th)(Nb,Ta,Ti)2O6. It is commonly partially amorphous due to radiation damage.
Euxenite forms a continuous series with the titanium rich polycrase-(Y) having the following formula: (Y,Ca,Ce,U,Th)(Ti,Nb,Ta)2O6

==Name and discovery==

It was first described in 1870 and named for from the Greek (εύξεινος), hospitable or friendly to strangers, in allusion to the many rare elements that it contains.

==Occurrence==

It occurs in granite pegmatites and detrital black sands. 
It is found in many locations worldwide, notably its type locality in  	Jølster, Sunnfjord, Norway. Other locations include the Ural Mountains of Russia; Sweden; Minas Gerais, Brazil; Ampangabe, Madagascar; Ontario, Canada; and in Arizona, Wyoming and Colorado in the U. S. A. http://www.galleries.com/minerals/oxides/euxenite/euxenite.htm Mineral Galleries
