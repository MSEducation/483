==Razor Sharp Records==

Razor Sharp Records is a recording label which was believed to also be run by RZA. The label was founded in the early 1990s around the time that RZA produced Method Man's Tical, Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx..., Ol' Dirty Bastard's Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version, The GZA's Liquid Swords and Ghostface Killah's Ironman. Although the label received returning profits and precedes on every album made by each clan member, very few acts were seen on the label, most notably Cappadonna who has long close ties with the group, and was often believed to be an unofficial member, until his official induction prior to 8 Diagrams. The current situation of the label is unknown, although is it possible that the label dissolved or possibly became one of the more recent Wu labels.Wu-Tang Corp. - Home of the Wu-Tang Clan and Killa Beez It was distributed by Epic/SME Records.
