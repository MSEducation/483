In probability theory, the Borel–Cantelli lemma is a theorem about sequences of events. In general, it is a result in measure theory.  It is named after Émile Borel and Francesco Paolo Cantelli, who gave statement to the lemma in the first decades of the 20th century.E. Borel, "Les probabilités dénombrables et leurs applications arithmetiques" Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo (2) 27 (1909) pp. 247–271.F.P. Cantelli, "Sulla probabilità come limite della frequenza", Atti Accad. Naz. Lincei 26:1 (1917) pp.39–45.  A related result, sometimes called the second Borel–Cantelli lemma, is a partial converse of the first Borel–Cantelli lemma.  The lemma states that, under certain conditions, an event will occur with probability zero or with probability one.  As such, it is the best-known of a class of similar theorems, known as zero-one laws. Other examples include the Kolmogorov 0-1 law and the Hewitt–Savage zero-one law.

==Statement of lemma for probability spaces==

Let (En) be a sequence of events in some probability space.
The Borel–Cantelli lemma states:Achim Klenke, Probability Theory, (2006) Springer-Verlag ISBN 978-1-848000-047-6 doi:10.1007/978-1-848000-048-3
Here, "lim sup" denotes limit superior of the sequence of events, and each event is a set of outcomes. That is, lim sup En is the set of outcomes that occur infinitely many times within the infinite sequence of events (En).  Explicitly,
The theorem therefore asserts that if the sum of the probabilities of the events En is finite, then the set of all outcomes that are "repeated" infinitely many times must occur with probability zero. Note that no assumption of independence is required.

===Example===

Suppose (Xn) is a sequence of random variables with Pr(Xn = 0) = 1/n2 for each n. The probability that Xn = 0 occurs for infinitely many n is equivalent to the probability of the intersection of infinitely many = 0 events. The intersection of infinitely many such events is a set of outcomes common to all of them. However, the sum ∑Pr(Xn = 0) converges to π2/6 ≈ 1.645 n = 0 occurring for infinitely many n is 0. Almost surely (i.e., with probability 1), Xn is nonzero for all but finitely many n.

==Proof [tpl]cite web|title=Romik, Dan. Probability Theory Lecture Notes, Fall 2009, UC Davis.|url=http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~romik/teaching/lectures.pdf[/tpl]==

Let (En) be a sequence of events in some probability space and suppose that the sum of the probabilities of the En is finite. That is suppose:
Note that the convergence of this sum implies:
Therefore it follows that

==General measure spaces==

For general measure spaces, the Borel–Cantelli lemma takes the following form:

==Converse result==

A related result, sometimes called the second Borel–Cantelli lemma, is a partial converse of the first Borel–Cantelli lemma. The lemma states: If the events En are independent and the sum of the probabilities of the En diverges to infinity, then the probability that infinitely many of them occur is 1. That is:
The assumption of independence can be weakened to pairwise independence, but in that case the proof is more difficult.

===Example===

The infinite monkey theorem is a special case of this lemma.
The lemma can be applied to give a covering theorem in Rn.  Specifically [tpl]harv|Stein|1993|loc=Lemma X.2.1[/tpl], if Ej is a collection of Lebesgue measurable subsets of a compact set in Rn such that
then there is a sequence Fj of translates
such that
