David Haydn Raven (born 10 March 1985 in West Kirby, Wirral) is an English football player currently playing for Inverness Caledonian Thistle. He can play as a right sided or central defender.

==Career==

===Liverpool===

He initially started playing in Tranmere Rovers's academy while attending Calday Grange Grammar School before joining Liverpool.
Raven made his first team debut with a man of the match display during the League Cup quarter-final win against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane in December 2004 and went on to play in two further games: disappointing defeats to Burnley in the FA Cup Third Round and Southampton in the Barclays Premiership. He had also played in the pre-season match against Wrexham in August 2004.
He played a number of games at centre half for the reserves throughout 2004 but Rafael Ben√≠tez, having been impressed with the youngster since his arrival in the summer, saw his best position as a right back. He was a regular captain of Liverpool's reserve team, and spent the latter part of the 2005/06 season on loan at Tranmere.

===Carlisle United===

Raven then moved to Carlisle United F.C. from Liverpool F.C. on a free transfer but his debut was a disaster lasting only half an hour before he was substituted because of injury.
After an injury-plagued first season at Carlisle, the 2007/08 season became a different story for Raven, who established himself as Carlisle's first choice right back, and also won the club's Most Improved Player of the Year award. During this season he also scored his first goal for Carlisle against Leyton Orient. Raven signed for Shrewsbury Town on 9 July 2010 on a 1 year contract.

===Shrewsbury Town===

Having been released from Carlisle United, new Shrewsbury Town manager Graham Turner announced Raven as being his second permanent signing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/shrewsbury/8805724.stm|title=Shrewsbury Town sign defender David Raven |date=9 July 2010|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=6 March 2011[/tpl] After another injury plagued, yet consistent season when playing, Raven was released by the club on 23 May 2011.

===Tranmere Rovers===

In summer 2011 he returned to former loan club Tranmere Rovers on trial, playing in a pre-season tie against Colwyn Bay. He signed for the club but was subsequently released at the end of the 2011-12 season.[tpl]cite web |title=Moore Rebuilding Squad|url=http://www.tranmererovers.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10365~2762894,00.html |work=Tranmere Rovers FC |date=8 May 2012 |accessdate=8 May 2012 [/tpl]
