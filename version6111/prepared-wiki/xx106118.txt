Vojo Stanić (Serbian:  Vojo Stanić/Војо Станић, born 1924) is a Montenegrin painter and sculptor. 
Vojo Stanić was born in 1924 in Podgorica. He completed Academy of Sculpture in Belgrade, after that he moved Herceg Novi.
In time he turned to painting, enabling him to better express his spirit - peace-loving, Mediterranean spirit and interest in people. His paintings are small drama stories from every day life, full of spirit. They bring back to life the spirit of Renaissance comedies, presenting human weaknesses and at the same time he shows understanding for them. Topics from cafes, sea or home are often a mixture of surreal details or imaginative relationship of characters and objects.
He is one of the most important modern Montenegrin painters, and is a member of the Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts. He had several individual exhibits. The most important exhibit of his was at Venice Biennale in 1997.[ref]
