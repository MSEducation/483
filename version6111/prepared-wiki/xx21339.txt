==Early life and education==

Bernard Baruch was born in Camden, South Carolina on August 19, 1870 to Belle and Simon Baruch, a physician.[tpl]cite news |author= |title=Bernard Baruch's Father Dies In N.

In 1881 the family moved from Camden to New York City, where Bernard and his brothers attended local schools. He studied at and graduated from the City College of New York.

==Career==

Baruch became a broker and then a partner in A.A. Housman & Company. With his earnings and commissions, he bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange for $18,000 ($434,000 in today's dollars). There he amassed a fortune before the age of 30 via speculation in the sugar market. By 1903 Baruch had his own brokerage firm and gained the reputation of "The Lone Wolf of Wall Street" because of his refusal to join any financial house. By 1910, he had become one of Wall Street's best-known financiers.
In 1925 he endowed the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) Mrs. Simon Baruch University Award in memory of his mother, to support scholars who have written unpublished monographs for full-length books on Confederate history.  His mother had been an early member of the organization and supported their activities.

==Presidential adviser: First World War==

In 1916, Baruch left Wall Street to advise President Woodrow Wilson on national defense and terms of peace.  He served on the Advisory Commission to the Council of National Defense and, in 1918, became the chairman of the new War Industries Board.  With his leadership, this body successfully managed the US's economic mobilization during World War I.  In 1919, Wilson asked Baruch to serve as a staff member at the Paris Peace Conference.  Baruch did not approve of the reparations France and Britain demanded of Germany, and supported Wilson's view that there needed to be new forms of cooperation, and supporting the creation of the League of Nations.Leab, Daniel et al., ed.  "The Great Depression and the New Deal: A Thematic Encyclopedia." ABC-CLIO LLC., 2010, p. 11.
In the 1920s and 30s, Baruch expressed his concern that the United States needed to be prepared for the possibility of another world war.  He wanted a more powerful version of the War Industries Board, which he saw as the only way to ensure maximum coordination between civilian business and military needs.Leab, Daniel et al., ed. The Great Depression and the New Deal: A Thematic Encyclopedia ABC-CLIO Inc., 2010, p. 11. Baruch remained a prominent government adviser during this time, and supported Franklin D. Roosevelt's domestic and foreign policy initiatives after his election.
During President Roosevelt's "New Deal" program, Baruch was a member of the "Brain Trust"  and helped form the National Recovery Administration (NRA). He was also a major contributor to Eleanor Roosevelt's controversial initiative to build a resettlement community for unemployed mining families in Arthurdale, West Virginia.[tpl]cite book |title=Eleanor Roosevelt, Vol. 2: 1933–1938 |last=Cook |first=Blanche Wiesen |authorlink=Blanche Wiesen Cook |year=1999 |publisher=Viking |isbn=0-670-80486-X |url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Eleanor_Roosevelt.html?id=ecrtAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=November 26, 2012|pages=136–141[/tpl]

==Presidential adviser: Second World War==

When the United States entered World War II, President Roosevelt appointed Baruch a special adviser to the director of the Office of War Mobilization.  He supported what was known as a "work or fight" bill. Baruch advocated the creation of a permanent superagency similar to his old Industries Board. His theory enhanced the role of civilian businessmen and industrialists in determining what was needed and who would produce it.Baruch, The Public Years, 321–28; Kerry E. Irish, "Apt Pupil: Dwight Eisenhower and the 1930 Industrial Mobilization Plan", The Journal of Military History 70.1 (2006) 31–61. Baruch's ideas were largely adopted, with James Byrnes appointed to carry them out. During World War II Baruch remained a trusted adviser and confidant of President Roosevelt, who in 1944 spent a month as a guest at Baruch's South Carolina estate, Hobcaw Barony.
In February 1943, Roosevelt invited Baruch to replace the widely criticized War Production Board head Donald M. Nelson. Baruch had long coveted the job, and responded that he only needed to ask his doctor if he were healthy enough for the post. During the delay, however, presidential advisor Harry Hopkins persuaded Roosevelt that firing Nelson at the army's demands would make him look weak, and when Roosevelt and Baruch met the at the White House, Roosevelt declined to discuss the job offer further.[tpl]cite book |title=No Ordinary Time |last=Goodwin |first=Doris Kearns |year=1994 |publisher=Simon & Schuster|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wQcMDdFC1QEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=doris+goodwin+eleanor&hl=en&sa=X&ei=X6auUMHwNO-_2QXCx4Bo&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=doris%20goodwin%20eleanor&f=false|isbn=9780684804484|pages=411–12[/tpl]
In 1946 President Harry S. Truman appointed Baruch as the United States representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC). On Friday, June 14, 1946, Baruch presented his Baruch Plan, a modified version of the Acheson–Lilienthal plan, to the UNAEC, which proposed international control of then-new atomic energy.  The Soviet Union rejected Baruch's proposal as unfair given the fact that the U.S. already had nuclear weapons; it proposed that the U.S. eliminate its nuclear weapons before a system of controls and inspections was implemented. A stalemate ensued.
Baruch resigned from the commission in 1947.  His influence began to diminish, as he grew further out of step with the views of the Truman administration.Leab, Daniel et al., ed. The Great Depression and the New Deal: A Thematic Encyclopedia ABC-CLIO LLC., 2010, p. 12.

==Park bench statesman==

Baruch was well-known, and often walked or sat in Washington, D.C's Lafayette Park and in New York City's Central Park. It was not uncommon for him to discuss government affairs with other people while sitting on a park bench: he became known for this.
In 1960, on his ninetieth birthday, a commemorative park bench in Lafayette Park across from the White House was dedicated to him[tpl]cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/1771725/Baruch-Bench-of-Inspiration |title=Baruch Bench of Inspiration |publisher=Wikimapia.org |date=August 16, 1960 |accessdate=April 16, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/whho/planyourvisit/explore-the-northern-trail.htm#CP_JUMP_100770 |title=President's Park (White House) – Explore the Northern Trail (U.S. National Park Service) |publisher=Nps.gov |accessdate=April 16, 2011[/tpl] by the Boy Scouts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/DC-Decoder/2010/0522/Secret-Washington-Where-to-go-to-get-away-from-the-crowds |title=Secret Washington: Where to go to get away from the crowds |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=May 22, 2010 |accessdate=April 16, 2011[/tpl]
He continued to advise on international affairs until his death on June 20, 1965, in New York City, at the age of 94.[tpl]cite news |author= |title=Bernard Baruch Dies  |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7PdRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=E3QDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6713,21330&dq=bernard+baruch+dies&hl=en |quote= |newspaper=New York Times |date=June 21, 1965 |accessdate=November 19, 2012 [/tpl]  His funeral at Temple Shaaray Tefila, the family synagogue, was attended by 700 people.[tpl]cite news|last=Phillips |first=Mccandlish |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0715FB345415738DDDAD0A94DE405B858AF1D3 |title=700 Attend Baruch Funeral at Family Synagogue – Family Joined by Dignitaries at 15-Minute Rites Here for Financier |publisher=The New York Times |date=June 24, 1965 |accessdate=January 7, 2013[/tpl]   His grave is at Flushing Cemetery, Flushing, Queens, New York City.

==Thoroughbred racing==

Bernard Baruch owned a string of Thoroughbred racehorses and raced under the name "Kershaw Stable". In 1927 his horse, Happy Argo, won the Carter Handicap.

==Legacy and honors==

==Purchase of Hobcaw Barony==

Between 1905 and 1907, Bernard Baruch systematically purchased a total of approximately 15,560 acres (63 square kilometers) of the former 18th century Hobcaw Barony, also known as Bellefield Plantation, located on a peninsula called Waccamaw Neck between the Winyah Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, in Georgetown County, South Carolina. Baruch subsequently developed sections of the property as a winter hunting resort. He later transferred the property to his eldest child, Belle W. Baruch. Upon her death in 1964, the property was transferred to The Belle W. Baruch Foundation as the Hobcaw Barony nature and research preserve. The property also includes more than forty historic buildings representing the 18th and 19th century rice cultivation industry, and early-mid 20th century winter resorts. The entire property was named to the National Register of Historic Places on November 2, 1994.http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/georgetown/S10817722036/S10817722036.pdf
The Trustees of The Belle W. Baruch Foundation subsequently selected the University of South Carolina and Clemson University as educational institutions with a mandate to preserve and study the Hobcaw Barony, including the estate's coastal ecosystems. The University of South Carolina established the Belle W. Baruch Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences, and Clemson University established the Belle W. Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology & Forest Science. Both universities have also formed partnerships with other schools in South Carolina that carry out research and educational programs which contribute to knowledge of coastal ecosystems.
The Belle W. Baruch Foundation and the North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve jointly operate the Hobcaw Barony Discovery Center and provide tours and special programs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hobcawbarony.org/ |title=The Belle W.
