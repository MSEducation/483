The Amadori rearrangement is an organic reaction describing the acid or base catalyzed isomerization or rearrangement reaction of the N-glycoside of an aldose or the glycosylamine to the corresponding 1-amino-1-deoxy-ketose.M.

The reaction mechanism is demonstrated starting from the reaction of D-mannose in its closed (1) and open-form (2) with ammonia to produce the 1,1-amino-alcohol (3), which is unstable and loses water to the glycosylamine (again the open imine (5) and the closed form hemiaminal (4)), which is the starting point for the actual Amadori rearrangement.Mutarotation, Hydrolysis, and Rearrangement Reactions of Glycosylamines HORACE S.

By treatment of the glycosylamine with pyridine and acetic anhydride, the imine group rearranges and the intermediate enol, in turn, rearranges to the ketone. In this particular reaction, all the alcohol and amino groups are acylated as well.
The reaction is associated with the Maillard reaction in which the reagents are naturally occurring sugars and amino acids.

==Amadori product==

An Amadori product is an intermediate in the production of an advanced glycation end-product (AGE) as a result of glycation.
The formation of an advanced glycation end-product involves the following steps:
The first two steps in this reaction are both reversible, but the last step is irreversible.
