The Stanley Cup ([tpl]lang-fr|La Coupe Stanley[/tpl]) is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff winner after the conclusion of the Stanley Cup Finals. Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, the trophy is named for Lord Stanley of Preston, then–Governor General of Canada, who awarded it to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club, which the entire Stanley family supported, with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game.http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=b194502&type=Builder&page=bio&list=ByName The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC. In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other for the Stanley Cup. After a series of league mergers and folds, the Stanley "Presentation Cup" was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947.  
There are actually three Stanley Cups: the original bowl of the "Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup", the authenticated "Presentation Cup", and the "Replica Cup" at the Hall of Fame. The NHL has maintained effective control over both the trophy itself and its associated trademarks.  Nevertheless, the NHL does not actually own the trophy, but instead uses it by agreement with the two Trustees of the Cup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2012/09/19/stanley-cup-will-stay-put-even-if-nhl-season-is-cancelled |title=Stanley Cup will stay put, even if NHL season is cancelled | NHL | Sports | National Post |publisher=Sports.nationalpost.com |accessdate=2012-09-20[/tpl] The NHL has registered trademarks associated with the name and likeness of the Stanley Cup, although the league's right to outright own trademarks associated with a trophy it does not own has been disputed by some legal experts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/if-the-nhl-won-t-use-it-can-canada-have-the-stanley-cup-back-1.962189 |title=If the NHL won't use it, can Canada have the Stanley Cup back? |publisher=Ctvnews.ca |date=2012-09-14 |accessdate=2012-09-20[/tpl]
Unlike the trophies awarded by the other three major professional sports leagues of North America, a new Stanley Cup is not made each year; winners keep it until a new champion is crowned. It is unusual among trophies, in that it has the names of all of the winning players, coaches, management, and club staff engraved on its chalice. Initially, a new band added each year caused the trophy to grow in size, earning the nickname "Stovepipe Cup". In 1958 the modern one-piece Cup was designed with a five-band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band. To prevent the Stanley Cup from growing, when the bottom band is full, the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band added to the bottom. It has been referred to as The Cup, Lord Stanley's Cup, The Holy Grail, or facetiously (chiefly by sportswriters) as Lord Stanley's Mug.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2007/29/c8159.html|title=The Stanley Cup coming soon to a living room near you?|publisher=CNW Group|year=2007|accessdate=April 8, 2007[/tpl] The Stanley Cup is surrounded by numerous legends and traditions, the oldest of which is the celebratory drinking of champagne out of the cup by the winning team. 
The original bowl was made of silver and is 18.5 centimetres (7.28 inches) in height and 29 centimetres (11.42 inches) in diameter. The current Stanley Cup, topped with a copy of the original bowl, is made of a silver and nickel alloy; it has a height of 89.54 centimetres (35.25 inches) and weighs 15.5 kilograms (34.5 lb / 2 st 6½ lb).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/silver_stFFFs.htm | title=Stanley Cup Engraving Facts, Firsts, and Faux Pas | publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame | accessdate=May 25, 2008[/tpl]
Since the 1914–15 season, the Cup has been won a combined 95 times by 18 active NHL teams and five defunct teams. Prior to that, the challenge cup was held by nine different teams. The Montreal Canadiens have won the Cup a record 24 times and are currently the last Canadian-based team in the NHL to win the cup after winning it in 1993. The Stanley Cup was not awarded in 1919 because of a Spanish flu epidemic, and in 2005, as a consequence of the NHL lockout.

==History==

===Origins===

After the Lord Stanley of Preston was appointed by Queen Victoria as Governor General of Canada on June 11, 1888, he and his family became highly enthusiastic about ice hockey.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=3[/tpl] Stanley was first exposed to the game at Montreal's 1889 Winter Carnival, where he saw the Montreal Victorias play the Montreal Hockey Club.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hhof.com/html/exSCJ07_01.shtml |title=Hockey Hall of Fame: Stanley Cup Journals 01 |accessdate=May 13, 2008[/tpl] The Montreal Gazette reported that he "expressed his great delight with the game of hockey and the expertise of the players".[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=3[/tpl] During that time, organized ice hockey in Canada was still in its infancy and only Montreal and Ottawa had anything resembling leagues.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=3[/tpl]
Stanley's entire family became active in ice hockey. Two of his sons, Arthur and Algernon, formed a new team called the Ottawa Rideau Hall Rebels.[tpl]sfn|Diamond|1992|p=10[/tpl] Arthur also played a key role in the formation of what later became known as the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA), and would go on to be the founder of ice hockey in Great Britain., p. 11 Arthur and Algernon persuaded their father to donate a trophy to be "an outward and visible sign of the hockey championship".[tpl]sfn|Diamond|1992|p=10[/tpl] Stanley sent the following message to the victory celebration held on March 18, 1892, at Ottawa's Russell Hotel for the three-time champion Ottawa Hockey Club:[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=3[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.ca/hockey/024002-119.01-e.php?&hockey_id_nbr=6&&PHPSESSID=rq9jcm5ucr4uim576lt6808ik4 |title=Ottawa Journal article of dinner at Backcheck'' web site|publisher=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=November 3, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/cup/cup.html | title=NHL.com — The Stanley Cup | accessdate=July 11, 2006|publisher=NHL[/tpl]
 
 I have for some time been thinking that it would be a good thing if there were a challenge cup which should be held from year to year by the champion hockey team in the Dominion (of Canada).
There does not appear to be any such outward sign of a championship at present, and considering the general interest which matches now elicit, and the importance of having the game played fairly and under rules generally recognized, I am willing to give a cup which shall be held from year to year by the winning team.
I am not quite certain that the present regulations governing the arrangement of matches give entire satisfaction, and it would be worth considering whether they could not be arranged so that each team would play once at home and once at the place where their opponents hail from.

Soon afterwards, Stanley purchased a decorative punch bowl, made in Sheffield, England, and sold by London silversmith G. R. Collis and Company (now Boodle and Dunthorne Jewellers), for ten guineas, equal to ten and a half pounds sterling, US$ 48.67, which is equal to $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|48.67|1893[/tpl][/tpl] today.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=3[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/cup/cupearly.html | title=NHL.com — Unraveling the mystery of Stanley | accessdate=July 11, 2006|publisher=NHL[/tpl] He had the words "Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup" engraved on one side of the outside rim, and "From Stanley of Preston" on the other side.[tpl]sfn|Zweig|2012|p=15[/tpl]
Originally, Stanley intended that the Cup should be awarded to the top amateur hockey team in Canada, to be decided by the acceptance of a challenge from another team. He made five preliminary regulations:[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=3[/tpl] 
 Stanley appointed Sheriff John Sweetland and Philip D. Ross (who would serve in his post an unsurpassed 56 years) as trustees of the Cup. Sweetland and Ross first presented the trophy in 1893 to the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association on behalf of the affiliated Montreal Hockey Club, the champions of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC), since they "defeated all comers during the late season, including the champions of the Ontario Association" (Ottawa).[tpl]sfn |Diamond |1992 |p=14[/tpl] Sweetland and Ross also believed that the AHAC was the top league, and as first place finishers in the AHAC, Montreal was the best team in Canada.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=4[/tpl] Naturally, the Ottawas were upset by the decision because there had been no challenge games scheduled and because the trustees failed to convey the rules on how the Cup was to be awarded prior to the start of the season.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=4[/tpl]
As a result, the Cup trustees issued more specific rules on how the trophy should be defended and awarded:, pp. 17–18[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=5[/tpl] 
 Stanley never saw a Stanley Cup championship game, nor did he ever present the Cup. Although his term as governor general ended in September 1893, he was forced to return to England on July 15. In April of that year, his elder brother Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby died, and Stanley succeeded him as the 16th Earl of Derby.

===Challenge Cup era===

During the challenge cup period, none of the leagues that played for the trophy had a formal playoff system to decide their respective champions; whichever team finished in first place after the regular season won the league title. However, in 1894, four teams out of the five-team AHAC tied for the championship with records of 5–3–0. The AHAC had no tie-breaking system. After extensive negotiations and Quebec's withdrawal from the championship competition, it was decided that a three-team tournament would take place in Montreal, with the Ottawa team receiving a bye to the Final because they were the only road team. On March 17, in the first ever Stanley Cup playoff game, the Montreal Hockey Club (Montreal HC) defeated the Montreal Victorias, 3–2. Five days later, in the first Stanley Cup Final game, Montreal HC beat the Ottawa Hockey Club, 3–1.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=20[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&year=1893-94 | title=Stanley Cup Winners: Montreal AAA 1893–94|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame | accessdate=July 11, 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930080711/http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&year=1893-94 |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
In 1895, Queen's University was the first official challenger for the Cup, although it was controversial. The Montreal Victorias had won the league title and thus the Stanley Cup, but the challenge match was between the previous year's champion, Montreal HC, and the university squad. The trustees decided that if the Montreal HC won the challenge match, the Victorias would become the Stanley Cup champions. The Montreal HC won the match 5–1 and their cross-town rivals were crowned the champions.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&year=1894-95 | title=Stanley Cup Winners: Montreal Victorias 1894–95|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame | accessdate=July 11, 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080307224825/http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&year=1894-95 |archivedate = March 7, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The first successful challenge to the Cup came the next year by the Winnipeg Victorias, the champions of the Manitoba Hockey League. On February 14, 1896, the Winnipeg squad defeated the champions 2–0 and became the first team outside the AHAC to win the Cup.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&year=1895-96Feb | title=Stanley Cup Winners: Winnipeg Victorias 1895–96Feb|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame | accessdate=July 11, 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930080341/http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&year=1895-96Feb |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
As the prestige of winning the Cup grew, so did the need to attract top players. Only nine months after winning the Cup, in March 1906, the Montreal Wanderers pushed through a resolution at the annual meeting of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) that would allow professional players to play alongside amateurs. Because the ECAHA was the top hockey league in Canada at the time, the Cup trustees agreed to open the challenges to professional teams., p. 19 The first professional competition came one month later during the Wanderers' two-game, total goals challenge series, which they won 17 goals to 5.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=37[/tpl]
The smallest municipality to produce a Stanley Cup champion team is Kenora, Ontario; the town had a population of about 4,000 when the Kenora Thistles captured the Cup in January 1907.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&year=1906-07Jan|title=Stanley Cup Winners: Kenora Thistles 1906–07Jan|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=July 24, 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051123215217/http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&year=1906-07Jan |archivedate = November 23, 2005|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Aided by future Hall of Famers Art Ross and "Bad" Joe Hall, the Thistles defeated the Montreal Wanderers in a two-game, total goals challenge series. The Thistles successfully defended the Cup once, against a team from Brandon, Manitoba. In March 1907, the Wanderers challenged the Thistles to a rematch. Despite an improved lineup, the Thistles lost the Cup to Montreal.
In 1908, the Allan Cup was introduced as the trophy for Canada's amateurs, and the Stanley Cup started to become a symbol of professional hockey supremacy. In that same year, the first all-professional team, the Toronto Trolley Leaguers from the newly created Ontario Professional Hockey League (OPHL), competed for the Cup.[tpl]sfn |Diamond |1992 |p=38[/tpl] One year later, the Montreal HC and the Montreal Victorias, the two remaining amateur teams, left the ECAHA, and the ECAHA dropped "Amateur" from their name to become a professional league. In 1910, the National Hockey Association (NHA) was formed. The NHA soon proved it was the best in Canada, as it kept the Cup for the next four years., p. 24
Prior to 1912, challenges could take place at any time, given the appropriate rink conditions, and it was common for teams to defend the Cup numerous times during the year. In 1912, Cup trustees declared that it was only to be defended at the end of the champion team's regular season.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&year=1911-12 | title=Stanley Cup Winners: Quebec Bulldogs 1911–12 | publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame | accessdate=July 11, 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080610202322/http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&year=1911-12 |archivedate = June 10, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

===Organized interleague competition===

In 1914, the Victoria Aristocrats from the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) challenged the NHA and Cup champion Toronto Blueshirts. A controversy erupted when a letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees.[ref]
</ref> However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because he had expected Emmett Quinn of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the Victoria challenge was accepted.<ref>[tpl]cite news |work=Montreal Daily Mail |date=March 19, 1914 |title=A Tempest In a Teapot |page=9[/tpl]</ref><ref>[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Globe and Mail |title=Stanley Cup Muddle Cleared Up |date=March 19, 1914 [/tpl]</ref>
Several days later, trustee William Foran wrote to NHA president Emmett Quinn that the trustees are "perfectly satisfied to allow the representatives of the three pro leagues (NHA, PCHA, and Maritime) to make all arrangements each season as to the series of matches to be played for the Cup."[ref]
