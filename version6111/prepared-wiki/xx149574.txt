===Other Projects===

====High Plains Comedy Festival====

In 2013, Cayton-Holland partnered with Denver comedian/producer Andy Juett to launch the High Plains Comedy Festival. In its inaugural year, the Festival ran three days in venues throughout Denver, and featured both local and national talent—including headliner Reggie Watts, Matt Braunger, and Kyle Kinane.[tpl]cite news|last=Wenzel|first=John|title=Why So Serious, Adam Cayton-Holland and Andy Juett?|url=http://www.heyreverb.com/blog/2013/08/23/why-so-serious-adam-cayton-holland-andy-juett/75806/|accessdate=April 22, 2014|newspaper=Reverb|date=August 23, 2013[/tpl] High Plains is set to return to Denver in the summer of 2014.

====Podcast====

Cayton-Holland produces a biweekly podcast called My Dining Room Table that he began in spring 2013. The central concept to the podcast is Cayton-Holland's loyalty to and love of Denver and his home (hence, the majority of the recordings happening at his literal dining room table), and his subsequent decision to stay in the city rather than move to LA or New York. He interviews local and national comics and musicians about a variety of topics, but often returns to the core ideas of "home" and "success" while promoting the burgeoning Denver cultural scene.[tpl]cite news|last=Hesse|first=Josiah M.|title=Comedian Adam Cayton-Holland debuts new podcast with Ben Roy interview|url=http://blogs.westword.com/showandtell/2013/03/adam_cayton-holland_debuts_new.php|accessdate=April 22, 2014|newspaper=Westword|date=March 18, 2013[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Cayton-Holland grew up in the neighborhood of Park Hill, Denver. He attended East High School (Denver) and Wesleyan University where he majored in film. His "twin obsessions" are birdwatching and the Colorado Rockies baseball team. His father has held Rockies season tickets since the team was formed. Before the start of the 2014 season, Cayton-Holland campaigned to throw out the ceremonious first pitch at a Rockies' game. He  created a buzz on Twitter with the hashtag #ACHFirstPitch, and took the plea national when he talked about it on The Pete Holmes Show.[tpl]cite news|last=Hochman|first=Benjamin|title=Give Cayton-Holland chance to throw out Rockies' first pitch|url=http://www.denverpost.com/hochman/ci_25305095/hochman-give-cayton-holland-chance-throw-out-rockies|accessdate=April 22, 2014|newspaper=The Denver Post|date=March 9, 2014[/tpl] On April 7, 2014, Cayton-Holland got his wish when he threw out the first pitch at a Rockies vs. White Sox game at Coors Field.[tpl]cite news|last=Bergstrom|first=Richard|title=Interview – Adam Cayton-Holland’s First Pitch|url=http://www.rockieszingers.com/2014/04/18/interview-adam-cayton-hollands-first-pitch/|accessdate=April 22, 2014|newspaper=Rockies Zingers|date=April 18, 2014[/tpl]
