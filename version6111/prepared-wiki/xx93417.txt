==History==

Sierra Semiconductor was originally founded in 1984 in San Jose, California by James Diller.[tpl]Cite news |title= Pulling the plug |author= Robert Ristelhueber |date= September 1, 1998 |work= Electronics Design News |url= http://www.edn.com/electronics-news/4356418/Pulling-the-plug |accessdate= October 28, 2013  [/tpl]   It received funding on January 11, 1984 from Sequoia Capital, and went public in 1991.
Pacific Microelectronics Centre in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, was spun off from Microtel Pacific Research (the research arm of BC TEL at the time) to develop Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and later SONET integrated circuits (chips).  With investment from Sierra Semiconductor, PMC was established in 1992 as a private company focused on providing networking semiconductors, and became a wholly owned, independently operated subsidiary of Sierra Semiconductor in 1994. Microtel is a part of Verizon Communications.
In August 1996, Sierra Semiconductor announced its decision to exit the personal computer modem chipset business, to restructure its other non-networking products and focus on its networking products.  In late 1996, it acquired Bipolar Integrated Technology in Beaverton, Oregon, for about $10 million to enter the Ethernet business. The headquarters was moved to Burnaby, and in 1997, the company changed its name to PMC-Sierra.
It acquired Integrated Telecom Technology Inc., San Jose, for $55 million in cash and stock in 1998.
In May 2006, PMC-Sierra acquired Passave, Inc., a developer of system-on-chip semiconductors for the fiber to the home access market in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at approximately $300 million. Passave was headquartered in Boston and had a development center in Tel Aviv, Israel.[tpl]cite news |title= PMC-Sierra to buy Passave for $300M|url= http://www.marketwatch.com/story/pmc-sierra-makes-300m-deal-for-passave |work= MarketWatch|date= April 4, 2006 |accessdate= October 28, 2013 [/tpl]
On October 22, 2010 PMC-Sierra acquired Wintegra Inc. for $240 million. Wintegra had 165 employees with the majority of its development team located in Raanana, Israel, and Austin, Texas.[tpl]cite news |title= PMC-Sierra buys Wintegra: The acquisition of Wintegra expands PMC-Sierraâ€™s presence in Israel, where its FTTH business is based. |url= http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000596010 |newspaper= Globes: Israel's Business Arena |date= October 24, 2010 |accessdate= October 28, 2013 [/tpl]
