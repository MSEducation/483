==Governors==

Kentucky was initially Kentucky County in Virginia. It achieved statehood and was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1792; see the list of governors of Virginia for the period before statehood. There have been 57 governors, serving 61 distinct terms.
An unelected group proclaimed Kentucky's secession from the Union on November 20, 1861, and it was annexed by the Confederate States of America on December 10, 1861. The Confederate government elected two governors (listed separately), but it never held much control over the state, and the main line of governors was preserved.
The original 1792 Kentucky Constitution had the governor chosen by an electoral college for a term of four years.1799 Kentucky Constitution article II, § 2–3 The second constitution in 1799 changed this to a popular vote, and prevented governors from succeeding themselves within seven years of their terms.1799 Kentucky Constitution article III, § 3–4 The third constitution in 1850 reduced the succession limitation to four years.1850 Kentucky Constitution article III, § 3 A 1992 amendment to the constitution allowed governors to have a second term before being prevented from succeeding themselves for four years.Kentucky Constitution article 71

==Confederate governors==

During the Civil War, a group of Confederate sympathizers met at the Russellville, Kentucky to form a Confederate government for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. While this government never successfully displaced the government in Frankfort, two men were elected governor of the Confederate government: George W. Johnson, who served from November 20, 1861 to his death on April 8, 1862 at the Battle of Shiloh, and, on Johnson's death, Richard Hawes, who served until the Confederate surrender on April 9, 1865. The Confederate government disbanded shortly after the end of the war in 1865.[ref]
