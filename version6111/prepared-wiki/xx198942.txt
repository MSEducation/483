==History==

In the Webfoots first year of competition, it was reported that they had trouble keeping attendance up at their home field.[tpl]cite news |title=Merry fight on over baseball |author= |newspaper=The Deseret News |date=December 12, 1902 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Xt4oAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LkoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1099,3742661&dq=pacific+northwest+league+portland&hl=en |accessdate=January 10, 2010 [/tpl] This began a debate over whether or not Portland should hold a team in the [tpl]by|1902[/tpl] league expansion with the California League into the Pacific Coast League, something that the Webfoots President Jack Marshal opposed. Some newspapers claimed that Marshal's opposition was due in large part to his personal dislike of Pacific Northwest League President William Henry Lucas. 
This led to a long debate over the inclusion of the Portland team in the Pacific Coast League.[tpl]cite news |title=Bolters given pretty hard jolt |author= |newspaper=The Deseret News |date=January 6, 1903 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cd4oAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LkoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4336,6439982&dq=pacific+northwest+league+portland&hl=en |accessdate=January 10, 2010 [/tpl] Both the Portland and Seattle clubs first wanted to create a rival league to the Pacific Coast League.[tpl]cite news |title=Magnates talk baseball merge |author= |newspaper=The Deseret News |date= February 19, 1903 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GZcwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SUoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3764,3218406&dq=pacific+northwest+league+portland&hl=en |accessdate=January 10, 2010 [/tpl] The Portland team was accepted into the Pacific Coast League but not before a lawsuit filed by the Portland team against the Pacific Northwest League that said the league harassed the Portland team into throwing the league pennant to the Butte, Montana baseball team.[tpl]cite news |title=Carried into court |author= |newspaper=The Deseret News |date=March 10, 1903 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JpcwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SUoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4491,4805122&dq=pacific+northwest+league+portland&hl=en |accessdate=January 10, 2010 [/tpl]
