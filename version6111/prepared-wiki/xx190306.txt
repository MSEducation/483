==History==

The first European to sight the island was William Edward Parry in 1819. It is named after a relative of Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale (who visited Lowther Island himself), that worked for the Hudson's Bay Company.
In August 1852, ÉMile-Frédéric de Bray, searching for Sir John Franklin, spent a week at Lowther Island and close-by Griffith Island.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6N0oYtQDxS0C&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=%22Lowther+Island%22 |pages=48–50 |last=Bray |first=E.
