Robert Phelan Langlands (born October 6, 1936) is a Canadian mathematician best known as the founder of the Langlands program, a vast web of conjectures and results connecting representation theory and automorphic forms to the study of Galois groups in number theory.  He is an emeritus professor at the Institute for Advanced Study.

==Career==

Langlands received an undergraduate degree from the University of British Columbia in 1957, and continued on there to receive an M. Sc. in 1958. He then went to Yale University where he received a Ph.D. in 1960. His academic positions since then include the years 1960-67 at Princeton University, ending up as Associate Professor, and the years 1967-72 at Yale University. He was appointed Hermann Weyl Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1972, becoming Professor Emeritus in January 2007.

==Research==

His Ph.D. thesis was on the analytical theory of semi-groups, but he soon moved into representation theory, adapting the methods of Harish-Chandra to the theory of automorphic forms. His first accomplishment in this field was a formula for the dimension of certain spaces of automorphic forms, in which particular types of Harish-Chandra's discrete series appeared.
The functoriality conjecture is far from proved, but a special case (the octahedral Artin conjecture, proved by Langlands and Tunnell) was the starting point of Andrew Wiles' attack on the Taniyamaâ€“Shimura conjecture and Fermat's last theorem.
In the mid-1980s Langlands turned his attention to physics, particularly the problems of percolation and conformal invariance.
In recent years he has turned his attention back to automorphic forms, working in particular on a theme he calls `beyond endoscopy'.

==Awards and honors==

Langlands has received the 1996 Wolf Prize (which he shared with Andrew Wiles),AMS Notices the 2005 AMS Steele Prize, the 1980 Jeffery-Williams Prize, the 1988 NAS Award in Mathematics from the National Academy of Sciences,[tpl]cite web|title=NAS Award in Mathematics|url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_mathematics|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=13 February 2011[/tpl] the 2006 Nemmers Prize in Mathematics, and the 2007 Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences (with Richard Taylor) for his work on automorphic forms.
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1981. In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-01-27.

==Personal life==

Langlands spent a year in Turkey in 1967/68, where his office at the Middle East Technical University was next to that of Cahit Arf's.
