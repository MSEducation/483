[[Mount K2]]

CATEGORIES: Mountains of Alberta, Winston Churchill Range

Mount K2 is a mountain located in the upper Athabasca River Valley of Jasper National Park, 1Â½ km east of Mount Kitchener. The mountain was named in 1938 by Rex Gibson (former Alpine Club of Canada president), apparently to signify this as a secondary peak of Mount Kitchener, and not K2.
