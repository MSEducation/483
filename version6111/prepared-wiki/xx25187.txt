[[Versatackle knot]]

CATEGORIES: Knots

A versatackle is a way of simulating a block and tackle without actual pulleys or deadeyes. It consists of two loops with the rope passed back and forth between them. It is functionally similar to the trucker's hitch, however, unlike the trucker's hitch, the versatackle is self-locking under tension.
The pressure, friction, and heat that may be generated by the running end moving through the loops can accelerate wear at the loops.
