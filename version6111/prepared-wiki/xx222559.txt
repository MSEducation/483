Juan Nepomuceno Guerra (July 18, 1915 – July 12, 2001) was a Mexican drug lord and smuggler who co-founded the Gulf Cartel with his nephew Juan García Ábrego. He is often considered the "godfather" of U.S-Mexico border cartels.
During the 1930s he began smuggling whisky across the Mexico-United States border through south Texas. Through shrewd political connections he had fostered, Nepomucena Guerra was able to control all the contraband moving across the Rio Grande. http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DEFDF1539F93AA35751C0A960958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all In the 1970s, his nephew Juan García Abrego began utilizing those connections and developed the organization into a drug cartel primarily dedicated to the more lucrative business of smuggling cocaine.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news|last=Castillo García|first=Gustavo|title=La historia del cártel del Golfo|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2003/03/15/046n1soc.php?origen=soc-jus.html|accessdate=16 September 2012|newspaper=La Jornada|date=15 March 2003|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AjKkM38p|archivedate=16 September 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl]
According to news sources, despite allegedly founding one of the largest drug cartels in Mexico, Juan Nepomuceno Guerra never spent more than "a few hours in jail" for his crimes.[tpl]cite news|last=Dillon|first=Sam|title=Matamoros Journal; Canaries Sing in Mexico, but Uncle Juan Will Not|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/09/world/matamoros-journal-canaries-sing-in-mexico-but-uncle-juan-will-not.html|accessdate=11 September 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=9 February 1996|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Abo0XCOd|archivedate=11 September 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl]
