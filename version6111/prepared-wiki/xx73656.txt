rightThe SWORD Project is the CrossWire Bible Society's free Bible software project. Its purpose is to create cross-platform open source tools—covered by the GNU General Public License—that allow programmers and Bible societies to write new Bible software more quickly and easily.

==Overview==

The core of The SWORD Project is a cross-platform library written in C++, providing access, search functions and other utilities to a growing collection of over 200 texts in over 50 languages.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115254414.html|title=Religion Meets Computer Revolution|accessdate=2008-03-17|date=2004-04-11|author=Al Fasoldt|work=The Post-Standard (Syracuse, New York)[/tpl] Any software based on their API can use this collection.
JSword is a separate implementation, written in Java, which reproduces most of the API features of the C++ API and supports most SWORD data content.
The project is one of the primary implementers of and contributors to the Open Scripture Information Standard (OSIS), a standardized XML language for the encoding of scripture. The software is also capable of utilizing certain resources encoded in using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) format and maintains deprecated support for Theological Markup Language (ThML) and General Bible Format (GBF).
