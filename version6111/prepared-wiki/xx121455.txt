4-Chloro-''o''-toluidine (4-COT, 4-chloro-2-methylaniline) is a carcinogenic monocyclic amine.

==Production and use==

Production of 4-chloro-o-toluidine began in Germany in 1924 and was first reported in the USA in 1939. In Switzerland, 4-COT and its salts were produced between 1956 and 1976. It was widely used as an intermediate for the manufacture of dyestuffs, pigments and the pesticide chlordimeform. Production and distribution ceased in 1979 in the USA and in 1986 in Germany.
In nature, 4-COT is found in plants and animals as a metabolic product of chlordimeform.IARC Monograph Vol. 48, p-Chloro-o-Toluidine and its strong salts

==Experimental carcinogenicity and toxic effects in man==

In chronic feeding studies (mice of both sexes), 4-COT induces hemangiosarcomas and hemangioendotheliomas.Weisburger E.K. et al., Testing of twenty-one environ. aromatic amines or derivatives for long-term toxicity or carcinogenicity, J. Environ. Pathol. Toxicol., 1987, 2, 326-356
4-COT becomes covalently bound to DNA of rats and mice livers.Bentley P. et al., Species differences in the toxicity of p-chloro-o-toluidine to rats and mice. Covalent binding to hepatic macromolecules and hepatic non-parenchymal cell DNA, Chem.-biol. Interact., 1986, 57, 27-40
Inhalation or skin contact with 4-COT produces acute toxic effects, initially appearing as macroscopic or microscopic haematuria. Further symptoms include dysuria, reduced bladder capacity and pain the lower abdomen. Haemorrhagic cystitis is the main symptom of acute toxicity, with methaemoglobinaemia was observed in 50% of poisoning cases.Stasik M.J., Urinary bladder cancer after 4-chloro-o-toluidine. Dtsch. med. Wschr., 1991, 116, 1444-1447 (in German)

==Epidemiological studies of cancer==

No urinary bladder cancer was found in two of the earlier epidemiological reports of workers exposed to 4-COT in Switzerland and in the USA.Uebelin F., Pletscher A., Aetiology and prophylaxis of industrial tumors in the dye industry, Schweiz. med. Wschr., 1954, 84, 917-928 (in German)Ott M.G., Langner R.R., A mortality survey of men engaged in the manufacture of organic dyes, J. Occupational Medicine, 1983, 225, 763-768
Stasik et al. obtained similar results in their previous mortality study carried out on a cohort of 335 male employees exposed to 4-COT at plants in Frankfurt.Stasik M.J. et al., A historic cohort study of 4-chloro-2-methylaniline workers, Proceedings of the MEDICHEM Meeting, Bahia, Brazil, 1985, London, ICI plc, 2-11
A subcohort of 116 subjects in the 4-COT cohort, engaged in the synthesis of 4-COT at the old production plant with presumably higher level of exposure to this monocyclic arylamine, was separated from the Frankfurt cohort of 335 men, for further research.
Stasik then conducted a retrospective study of the incidence of bladder cancer among workers restricted to this subcohort. His investigation revealed eight subjects in whom bladder carcinomas were diagnosed between 1967 and 1985. Two of them had already died. The standardized incidence rate for bladder carcinomas in the 4-COT subcohort was 73 times higher than expected.
Histologically, all tumor cases were urothelial carcinomas.Stasik M.J., Carcinomas of the urinary bladder in a 4-chloro-o-toluidine cohort, Int. Arch. Occup. Environ. Health, 1988, 60, 21-24

==Evaluation of carcinogenic risk to man==

The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Council) defined 4-COT as a human carcinogen (III A1). Besides Germany, 4-COT is listed as a carcinogen in Finland and Switzerland.DFG Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Council), Commission for the Investigation of Health Hazards of Chemical Compounds in the Work Area, 1987
Further in 1990 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified 4-COT as a probable human carcinogen (2A).
Both assessments were based on the results of the subcohort incidence study.

==Further studies of cancer==

Also in China an increased incidence of bladder cancer among farm workers exposed to chlordimeform has been reported in 1990.Xue S. et al., The risk assessment of occupational exposure to chlordimeform, 23rd Intern. Congress on Occupational Health, 1990, Montreal
In 1992 Popp, Norpoth et al. found seven persons suffering from bladder cancer among 49 workers involved in the synthesis of chlordimeform from 4-COT in another German plant.Popp W. et al., Incidence of bladder cancer in cohort of workers exposed to 4-chloro-o-toluidine while synthesizing chlordimeform, Br. J. Ind. Med., 1992, 49, 529-531
Ten years later Stasik carried out a follow-up study of the same 4-COT subcohort studied by him previously. His re-investigations revealed a cluster of four new cases of bladder tumors in this group. So the total evidence of bladder cancer in the 4-COT subcohort increased to 12 cases, which makes 10% of all members of this particular group.Stasik M.J., Current studies of 4-chloro-o-toluidine and chlordimeform carcinogenicity, 26th Intern. Congress on Occupational Health, 2000, Singapore
