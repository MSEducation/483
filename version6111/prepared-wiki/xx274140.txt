Freycinet Island is one component of the Quoin Bluff and Freycinet Island Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because it holds an important nesting colony of Pied Cormorants.  Together with a similar colony on Quoin Bluff some 80Â km to the north-west, it supports between 5000 and 10,000 birds - over 1% of the world population of the species.  Small numbers of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters and Silver Gulls also nest on the island, and Rock Parrots have been recorded there.BirdLife International. (2011).
