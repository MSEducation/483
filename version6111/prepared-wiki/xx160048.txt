USS ''LST-853 was an [tpl]sclass|LST-542|tank landing ship[/tpl] in the United States Navy during World War II. Later in her U.S. Navy career she was renamed Kane County'' (LST-853)—after counties in Illinois and Utah—but never saw active service under that name.
LST-853 was laid down on 30 August 1944 at Seneca, Illinois, by the Chicago Bridge & Iron Co.; launched on 17 November 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Ellen Scott De-Coursey; and commissioned on 11 December 1944, Lt. Charles B. Salsbury in command.
After shakedown off Florida, LST-853 departed New Orleans for the Pacific 19 January 1945. She loaded troops and equipment on the west coast before steaming from Seattle 10 March. Sailing via Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, and Guam, she arrived at Saipan 25 April. The landing ship embarked units of the 1878th Engineer Aviation Battalion, then sailed on the 27th for Okinawa. Arriving 6 days later in the midst of enemy air raids, LST-853 discharged men and equipment on this strategic base which lay at the gateway to Japan.
She returned to Saipan 24 May and, during the remaining months of the war, shuttled troops and equipment among the Marianas, Philippines and Okinawa staging areas for the planned invasion of Japan. The enemy's acceptance of Allied peace terms obviated an invasion, so LST-853 then operated in the Far East, transporting occupation forces until early December.
Arriving Saipan 13 December 1945, she embarked veterans of the Pacific fighting in the Marianas and sailed for the United States in January 1946. After arrival on the West Coast, LST-853 then sailed to Astoria, Oregon; and decommissioned at Vancouver, Washington, 24 July 1946. While berthed in the Columbia River with the Pacific Reserve Fleet, she was named Kane County 1 July 1955.
Under provisions of the Military Assistance Program, she was transferred to the Republic of Korea 22 December 1958, and served the ROK navy as Su Yong (LST-813).
LST-853 earned one battle star for World War II service.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/l26/lst-853.htm|date=2008-11-14|work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships|title=LST-853|publisher=Naval Historical Center[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/k1/kane_county.htm|date=2008-11-14|work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships|title=USS Kane County (LST-853)|publisher=Naval Historical Center[/tpl]
