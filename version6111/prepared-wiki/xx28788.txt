[[Candela per square metre]]

CATEGORIES: Units of luminance, Photometry, SI derived units

The candela per square metre (cd/m2) is the derived SI unit of luminance. The unit is based on the candela, the SI unit of luminous intensity, and the square metre, the SI unit of area. 
As a measure of light emitted per unit area, this unit is frequently used to specify the brightness of a display device.  Most consumer desktop liquid crystal displays have luminances of 200 to 300 cd/m2;[tpl]cite web | title = PC Perspective | url = http://www.pcper.com/article.php?aid=907&type=expert&pid=3[/tpl] the sRGB spec for monitors targets 80 cd/m2.[tpl]cite web | id = IEC 61966-2-1 | year = 1999 | title = Multimedia systems and equipment – Colour measurement and management – Part 2-1: Colour management – Default RGB colour space – sRGB | publisher = International Electrotechnical Commission | url = http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/025408 [/tpl] High-definition televisions range from 450 to about 1000 cd/m2. Typically, calibrated monitors should have a brightness of 120 cd/m2.
Nit (nt) is a  obsolescent non-SI name also used for this unit (1 nit = 1 cd/m2).[tpl]cite book | title = Vision | first1 = Pierre | last1 = Buser | first2 = Michel | last2 = Imbert | publisher = MIT Press | year = 1992 | isbn = 978-0-262-02336-8 | page = 53 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=NSZvt8Ld2-8C&pg=PA53&dq=nit+luminance[/tpl]  The term Nit is believed to come from the Latin word nitere, to shine.[tpl]cite book | title = Astronomical Photometry | editor-first = RLF | editor-last = Boyd | publisher = Springer | year = 1992 | isbn = 978-0-7923-1653-4 | page = 9 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ojzepXhy9DIC&pg=PA9&dq=nitere+nit+luminance[/tpl]
