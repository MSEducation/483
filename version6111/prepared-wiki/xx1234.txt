==Geography==

The city is made up of the mountains to the west, the Palmer Divide to the north, high plains further east, and desert land to the south when leaving Fountain and approaching Pueblo.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|482.1|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip[/tpl], of which [tpl]convert|481.1|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|1.0|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip[/tpl] (0.21%) is water.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

===Metropolitan area===

Colorado Springs has many features of a modern urban area, such as parks, bike trails, and urban open-area spaces. However, it is not exempt from problems that typically plague cities that experience tremendous growth, such as overcrowded roads and highways, crime, sprawl, and government budget issues. Many of the problems are indirectly or directly caused by the city's difficulty in coping with the large population growth experienced in the last twenty years, and the annexation of the Banning Lewis Ranch area to accommodate further population growth of 175,000 future residents.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

===Climate===

Colorado Springs has a semi-arid climate (Köppen BSk), and its location just east of the Southern Rocky Mountains affords it the rapid warming influence from chinook winds during winter but also subjects it to drastic day-to-day variability in weather conditions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://climate.colostate.edu/climateofcolorado.php |title=Colorado Climate Center - Climate of Colorado |publisher=Climate.colostate.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13[/tpl]  The city has abundant sunshine throughout the year, averaging over 300 days of sun per year, and receives approximately [tpl]convert|16.5|in|mm|0[/tpl] of annual precipitation. Due to unusually low precipitation for several years after flooding in 1999, Colorado Springs enacted lawn water restrictions in 2002. These were lifted in 2005.[tpl]cite web| date = November 3, 2010 | url = http://www.springsgov.com/Page.aspx?NavID=1188 | title=City of Colorado Springs – Drought[/tpl]
Colorado Springs is also one of the most active lightning strike areas in the United States. This natural phenomenon led Nikola Tesla to select Colorado Springs as the preferred location to build his lab and study electricity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_colspr.html |title=Tesla, Life and Legacy |publisher=pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-10[/tpl]

====Seasonal climate====

Winters range from mild to moderately cold, with December, the coldest month, averaging [tpl]convert|30.8|°F|1[/tpl]; historically January has been the coldest month, but, in recent years, December has had both lower daily maxima and minima.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.climate-zone.com/climate/united-states/colorado/colorado-springs/ |title=Colorado Springs |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Climate-zone.com |accessdate=September 15, 2010[/tpl] Typically, there are 5.2 nights with sub-[tpl]convert|0|°F|0[/tpl] lows and 23.6 days where the high does not rise above freezing, and extended sub-zero (°F) cold is rare. Snowfall is usually moderate and remains on the ground briefly because of direct sun, with the city receiving [tpl]convert|38|in|cm|0[/tpl] per season, although the mountains to the west often receive in excess of triple that amount; March is the snowiest month in the region, both by total accumulation and number of days with measurable snowfall. In addition, 8 of the top 10 heaviest 24-hour snowfalls have occurred from March to May. Summers are warm, with July, the warmest month, averaging [tpl]convert|70.9|°F|1[/tpl], and 18 days of [tpl]convert|90|°F|0[/tpl]+ highs annually. Due to the high elevation and aridity, nights are usually relatively cool and rarely does the low remain above [tpl]convert|70|°F|0[/tpl]. Dry weather generally prevails, but brief afternoon thunderstorms are common, especially in July and August when the city receives the majority of its annual rainfall, due to the North American Monsoon.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
The first freeze in the autumn and the last freeze in the spring on average occur on October 2 and May 6, respectively; the average window for measurable snowfall (≥[tpl]convert|0.1|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) is October 21 thru April 25. Extreme temperatures range from [tpl]convert|101|°F|0[/tpl] on June 26, 2012 down to [tpl]convert|−27|°F|0[/tpl] on February 1, 1951 and December 9, 1919.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

====NORAD and Cheyenne Mountain Air Station====

The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), a component of America's missile defense system, is located in Cheyenne Mountain Air Station. When it was built at the height of the Cold War, NORAD caused some anxiety for the residents in and around Colorado Springs, who believed the installation would be a primary target during a nuclear attack. Although NORAD still operates today, it is primarily tasked with the tracking of ICBMs, and the military has recently decided to place Cheyenne Mountain's NORAD/NORTHCOM operations on warm standby and move operations to nearby Peterson Air Force Base.{{Cite news|url = http://www.denverpost.com/nationworld/ci_4103478 |title = Military to put Cheyenne Mountain on standby – The Denver Post |publisher = The Denver Post

==Transportation==

Colorado Springs is served by a bus system called Mountain Metro (short for Mountain Metropolitan Transit).  Although the transit system serves much of the city and its nearest suburbs (Manitou Springs and Security/Widefield), it lacks service to many important areas (Powers Blvd, Northgate, the Airport) and has only limited hours of operation.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Colorado Springs is served by the Colorado Springs Municipal Airport. In the state of Colorado, only Denver International has more passenger traffic. The airport has experienced a higher recovery rate in the post-9/11 era than the rest of the country[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.springsgov.com/AirportPage.asp?PageID=4704 |title=Colorado Springs Airport – News Releases |publisher=Springsgov.com |date= |accessdate=October 5, 2009[/tpl] and is in the process of expanding its maintenance facilities, taxiways, and runways to accommodate future growth. In 2005 it served approximately two million passengers.
Colorado Springs is part of a consortium of cities trying to build the Front Range Commuter Rail.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

===Major highways and roads===

====Interstate highways====

Colorado Springs is primarily served by two interstate highways. I-25 runs north and south through Colorado, and is in the city for nearly 18 miles, entering the city south of Circle Drive and exiting north of North Gate Blvd. In El Paso County it is known as Ronald Reagan Highway.
 US 24 runs across the central mountains, through the city, and onto the plains. From west to east in Colorado Springs, US 24 follows the western portion of Cimarron Street and the Midland Expressway, a 2-mile concurrent section with I-25/US 87 between exits 139 and 141, part of Fountain Blvd, an expressway called the Martin Luther King Bypass, part of South Powers Blvd (where it is concurrent with Colorado 21), and the easternmost portion of Platte Avenue out of the city.

====State highways====

A number of state highways serve the city.  State Highway 21 is a major east side semi-expressway from Black Forest to Fountain. It is widely known as Powers Boulevard. State Highway 83 runs north-south from Denver to northern Colorado Springs. State Highway 94 runs east-west from western Cheyenne County to eastern Colorado Springs. State Highway 115 begins in Cañon City and runs up Nevada Avenue. US 85 and SH 115 are concurrent between Lake Avenue and I-25. US 85 enters the city at Fountain and was signed at Venetucci Blvd, Lake Avenue, and Nevada Avenue.[tpl]#tag:ref|In addition, there were plans to develop a "Front Range Toll Road", a privately owned turnpike, which would begin south of Pueblo and end around Fort Collins. This toll road would allow rail and truck traffic to avoid the more highly traveled parts of I-25 along the Front Range. Initially, the project had support but has since been highly contested because of the need to condemn the land of many private citizens, through the use of eminent domain, to make room for the corridor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nosuperslab.org/crap/how_to.html |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= [/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=October 2009[/tpl]|group="nb"[/tpl]

====County and city roads====

In 2004, the voters of Colorado Springs and El Paso County established the Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pprta.com |title=PPRTA Homepage |publisher=Pprta.com |date=September 28, 2009 |accessdate=October 5, 2009[/tpl] and adopted a 1% sales tax dedicated to improving the region's transportation infrastructure. Together with state funding for the Colorado Springs Metro Interstate Expansion (COSMIX) (2007 completion) and the I-25 interchange with Highway 16 (2008 completion), significant progress has been made since 2003 in addressing the transportation needs of the area. Currently the City is trying to overcome a $23.3 million budget gap created by falling sales taxes and rising expenses.[tpl]cite web|last=Zubeck |first=Pam |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/million_39774___article.html/council_city.htmlCouncil: |title=Cut, don't raise taxes or fees August 25, 2008 |publisher=Gazette.com |date=August 16, 2008 |accessdate=October 5, 2009[/tpl]
Several suggestions have been made to create a loop around the city though none have been implemented.[tpl]#tag:ref|The original plan to convert Powers Boulevard (now Colorado 21) into a bypass for I-25 was abandoned, although some of its interchanges are overpasses and roads further east are being looked at.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20061224/ai_n17109195 |title=Powers freeway debate restarts | Gazette, The (Colorado Springs) |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=December 24, 2006 |accessdate=October 5, 2009 | first=Ed | last=Sealover[/tpl] Easier access to the airport has recently been completed- in late 2011, the conversion of 2 lane Drennan Road to 4 lane expressway Milton Proby Parkway from the airport to S Academy Blvd.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.springsgov.com/page.aspx?navid=415 |title=City of Colorado Springs – Proby Parkway, Phase 1 |publisher=Springsgov.com |date=May 18, 2010 |accessdate=January 19, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.buildproby.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Build Proby |date=October 17, 2011 |accessdate=January 19, 2013[/tpl] Overall the new thoroughfares would include one (or two) loop freeways, a spur into the city connecting the main freeway and the loop, east-west expressway upgrades, and easier access to the Colorado Springs Airport.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]|group="nb"[/tpl] To manage congestion, the city implemented two graded separated intersections at Powers and Woodmen and at Austin Bluffs and Union.

==Notable residents==

==Sister cities==

Sister cities of Colorado Springs include:
Colorado Springs' sister city organization began when Colorado Springs became partners with Fujiyoshida. The torii gate erected to commemorate the relationship stands at the corner of Bijou Street and Nevada Avenue, and is one of the city's most recognizable landmarks. The torii gate, crisscrossed bridge and shrine, located in the median between Platte and Bijou Streets in downtown Colorado Springs, were a gift to Colorado Springs, erected in 1966 by the Rotary Club of Colorado Springs to celebrate the friendship between the two communities. A plaque near the torii gate states that "the purpose of the sister city relationship is to promote understanding between the people of our two countries and cities". The Fujiyoshida Student exchange program has become an annual event.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
To strengthen relations between the two cities, the Colorado Springs Youth Symphony regularly invites the Taiko drummers from the city to participate in a joint concert in the Pikes Peak Center. The orchestra played in Bankstown, Australia, in 2002 and again in June 2006 as part of their tours to Australia and New Zealand.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Also, in 2006 and 2010, the Bankstown TAP (Talent Advancement Program), performed with the Youth Symphony, and the Colorado Springs Children's Chorale, as a part of the annual "In Harmony" program.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
A notable similarity between Colorado Springs and its sister cities are their geographic positions:  three of the seven cities are also located near the base of a major mountain or mountain range.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.springsgov.com/Page.asp?NavID=1923 |title = City of Colorado Springs – Topic Pages |publisher = Springsgov.com |date = July 6, 2007 |accessdate = October 5, 2009[/tpl]
