"Koval" Ковал), literally translates as “forge”, and was commonly used to describe a blacksmith (Blacksmith is direct translation of the name from the Ukrainian.) The suffix “-chuk” (or -chuck or -czyk) denoted either the son of, or an apprentice to the blacksmith. It is somewhat similar in commonality to English surname Smith.
