The Battle at Borodino Field was a part of the Battle of Moscow, on the Eastern Front of World War II. While referring to the battle in Russian, the Borodino Field is actually more commonly applied rather than just Borodino, cf. Georgy Zhukov ("...this division 32nd was forced to cross the arms with the enemy on the Borodino Field...").[tpl]ru icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.borodino.ru/41_45.shtml|title=Бородино в годы Великой Отечественной Войны. 1941-42 гг.|publisher=Borodino.ru |accessdate=1 May 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080405172338/http://www.borodino.ru/41_45.shtml  |archivedate = 5 April 2008[/tpl]
