[[Shock wave]]

CATEGORIES: Shock waves

A shock wave is a type of propagating disturbance.  Like an ordinary wave, it carries energy and can propagate through a medium (solid, liquid, gas or plasma) or in some cases in the absence of a material medium, through a field such as the electromagnetic field. Shock waves are characterized by an abrupt, nearly discontinuous change in the characteristics of the medium.[ref]
