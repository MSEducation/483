[[Eighth Martin Ministry]]

CATEGORIES: Northern Territory ministries

The Eighth Martin Ministry was the 49th ministry to come from the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in Australia's Northern Territory. It came into existence on 7 August 2007 after a reshuffle sparked by the repercussions from the federal government's Northern Territory National Emergency Response. This resulted in a number of changes, including the taking on of the difficult police portfolio by then-Chief Minister Clare Martin, the return of the family and community services portfolio to indigenous MLA Marion Scrymgour and the creation of a separate alcohol policy portfolio for Health Minister Chris Burns. It lasted until 25 November 2007, when Paul Henderson was sworn in as Chief Minister in the wake of the sudden resignations of Martin and her deputy, Syd Stirling.
