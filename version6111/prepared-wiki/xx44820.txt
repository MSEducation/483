CATEGORIES: Jilin, Provinces of China

Jilin (Chinese: [tpl]lang|zh|[tpl]linktext|吉林[/tpl][/tpl], p Jílín, w Chi2-lin2), formerly romanized as Kirin, is a province of the People's Republic of China located in Manchuria, the northeastern part of the country. Jilin borders North Korea and Russia to the east, Heilongjiang to the north, Liaoning to the south, and Inner Mongolia to the west.

==Name==

The name "Jilin" {–} literally, "Auspicious Forest" {–} probably originates from girin ula [tpl]MongolUnicode|ᡤᡳᡵᡳᠨ ᡠᠯᠠ[/tpl], a Manchu phrase meaning "along the river"; this would have been transcribed into jilin wula (t [tpl]lang|zh|吉林烏拉[/tpl], s [tpl]lang|zh|吉林乌拉[/tpl]) in Chinese, then shortened to "Jilin".[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] Origin of the Names of China's Provinces, People's Daily Online.

==History==

In ancient times, Jilin was inhabited by various peoples, notably the Xianbei, Koreans, the Mohe and the Wùjí ([tpl]lang|zh-Hani|勿吉[/tpl]).前言 Various Korean kingdoms, including the Buyeo, Goguryeo and Balhae, were  established in this area.
The region then fell successively under the domination of the Xiongnu, Xianbei state, Khitan Liao Dynasty, the Jurchen Jin Dynasty, and the Mongol Yuan Dynasty.History of Mongolia, Volume II, 2003 During the Qing Dynasty, much of the area was under the control of the General of Jilin, whose area of control extended to the Sea of Japan to encompass much of what is Russia's Primorsky Krai today. Immigration of Han Chinese was strictly controlled.[tpl]When|date=November 2011[/tpl]
After the Primorsky Krai area was ceded to Russia in 1860, the Qing government began to open the area up to Han Chinese migrants, most of whom came from Shandong. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Han Chinese had become the dominant ethnic group of the region. In 1932, the area was incorporated into Manchukuo, a puppet state set up by Japan.  Changchun (then called Hsinking), capital of Jilin today, was made the capital of Manchukuo. After the defeat of Japan in 1945, the region, together with the rest of northeastern China, was ceded to the Communists by the Soviet Union. Manchuria was the staging ground from which the communists eventually conquered the rest of China in the Chinese Civil War.
In 1949, Jilin province was smaller, encompassing only the environs of Changchun and Jilin City, and the capital was at Jilin City, while Changchun was a municipality independent from the province. In the 1950s, Jilin was expanded to its present borders. During the Cultural Revolution, Jilin was expanded again to include a part of Inner Mongolia, giving it a border with the independent state of Mongolia, though this was later reversed. In recent times Jilin has, together with the rest of heavy industry-based Northeast China, been facing economic difficulties with privatization. This has prompted the central government to undertake a campaign called “Revitalize the Northeast”.
