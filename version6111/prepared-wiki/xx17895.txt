Giulio (Yoel) Racah ([tpl]lang-he|ג'וליו (יואל) רקח[/tpl]; February 9, 1909 – August 28, 1965) was an Italian–Israeli physicist and mathematician.[tpl]cite journal|title=Giulio Racah|journal=Physics Today|volume=18|issue=10|pages=118|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v18/i10/p118_s1?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.3046917[/tpl]

==Biography==

Born in Florence, Italy,http://www-personal.umich.edu/~szwetch/Stamps.of.Israel/62.html he took his degree from the University there in 1930, and later studied in Rome with Enrico Fermi. In 1937 he was appointed Professor of Physics at the University of Pisa. In 1939, due to application of Anti-Jewish laws in Italy, Racah immigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine, and was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he was later Dean of the Faculty of Sciences, and finally Rector and acting President. The physics institute at the Hebrew University is named "The Racah Institute of Physics".
In the Israeli War of Independence, Racah served as deputy commander of the Israeli forces defending Mount Scopus.Jewish Virtual Library,  sourced from Encyclopaedia Judaica
Racah's research was mainly in the fields of quantum physics and atomic spectroscopy. He first devised a systematic general procedure for classifying the energy levels of open shell atoms, which remains to this day the accepted technique for practical calculations of atomic structure.  This formalism was described in a monograph coauthored by his cousin: Ugo Fano (Irreducible Tensorial Sets, 1959).
Racah died at the age of 56, apparently asphyxiated by gas from a faulty heater.[tpl]cite journal|title=Giulio Racah|journal=Physics Today|volume=18|issue=10|pages=118|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v18/i10/p118_s1?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.3046917[/tpl]

==Awards==

In 1958, Racah was awarded the Israel Prize in exact sciences.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.webcitation.org/5mqejxurH |title=Israel Prize recipients in 1958 (in Hebrew)|publisher=Israel Prize Official Site |archiveurl=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyah |archivedate=17 January 2010[/tpl]
