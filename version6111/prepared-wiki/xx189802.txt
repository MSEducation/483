CATEGORIES: Lists of oldest buildings and structures in Canada

This is a list of the oldest surviving buildings and structures of significance in each province and territory of Canada.

==Alberta==

First Nations peoples in Alberta were generally nomadic and did not create permanent structures, however they did often occupy the same site annually for many generations, and created permanent markers in the form of tipi rings and medicine wheels.
The first Europeans to build in Alberta were the fur traders of the North West Company who constructed the first trading posts in Alberta at Fort Chipewyan and Fort Vermilion in 1788.  The oldest building in Alberta still on its original foundations is the clerk's quarters at Fort Victoria, which dates from 1865.Real Estate Weekly  Few buildings from the fur trade era remain.  Most buildings considered "historic" in Alberta are from the post-railway era (e.g. after 1885 in Calgary, after 1891 in Edmonton, etc.)

==British Columbia==

==Manitoba==

==New Brunswick==

Before 1784, New Brunswick was part of the colony of Nova Scotia and the majority of the population was aborigional. The native populations of the land that is now New Brunswick were a nomadic peoples and thus there are few remains of their settlements. However, in 1784 New Brunswick became its own colony due to an increasingly non-aboriginal population. Mostly forest until United Empire Loyalists started to arrive, the amount of European-style buildings were not constructed for the most part until after their arrival. Many Acadian homes and settlements were destroyed by the British during the expulsion of the Acadians known as the Great Expulsion from 1755 to 1763. The Acadians were a people of French descent that lived in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia for over a century before the British took over the lands that were New France.

==Newfoundland and Labrador==

==Northwest Territories==

==Nova Scotia==

==Ontario==

==Quebec==

The native inhabitants in Quebec were generally nomadic and did not create any permanent structures. The first Europeans were settlers from France, who founded Quebec City in 1608 and erected there the first foundations such as the Habitation made of wood and set up by Samuel de Champlain. Despite the founding of other significant settlements in New France in the 17th century, notably Trois-Rivi√®res in 1634 and Montreal in 1642, there are only a few 17th century buildings that still survive outside the Capitale-Nationale region. Therefore, the oldest buildings that still remain standing in Quebec are found heavily in and around Quebec City. All such buildings date from the French regime and are protected as historical monuments under the law enforced by the Ministry of Culture and Communication of Quebec.http://www.patrimoine-culturel.gouv.qc.ca/RPCQ/recherche.do?methode=afficher
