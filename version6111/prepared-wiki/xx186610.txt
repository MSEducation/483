According to Cotton Incorporated "Neil Diamond might have been right when he named his 1979 #1 hit “Forever in Blue Jeans”: 81% of women are planning their next jeans purchase to be some shade of blue." There's nothing as American as apple pie. And pop songs about blue jeans The song has been used to promote the sale of blue jeans, most notably Will Ferrell, impersonating Neil Diamond singing, for The Gap. Coincidentally, Diamond himself did radio ads for H.I.S. brand jeans in the 1960s, more than a decade before he sang this song. 
Jason Castro covered this song on American Idol (season 7).
The song was referenced on an episode ("Parent Trapped") of The King Of Queens, in which Doug Heffernan incorrectly refers to it as "Reverend Blue Jeans" thinking it was a song about a hip reverend that wore jeans.
