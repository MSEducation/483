Qutb-ud-din, at the age of 18, was originally appointed regent to his younger six-year old brother, the king. Within two months, Qutb-ud-din blinded his brother and ascended the throne. He began his rule by releasing thousands of prisoners and abolishing all taxes and penalties imposed by his father. Qutb-ud-din was the weakest ruler of the dynasty.
Qutb-ud-din was murdered by Khusro Khan in 1320, which ended the Khilji dynasty. Khusro Khan was a former Hindu slave of the Bawariya Hindu caste in Gujarat.
