Jefferson R. Burdick (1900 â€“ 1963) was a trading and baseball card collector and cataloguer.  He cataloged trading and baseball cards in The American Card Catalog, otherwise known as the ACC, which is still used today by collectors and dealers.  The famed T206 baseball card set received its popularized name from the set's designation in the ACC.  Many other baseball card sets are popularly known by their ACC designation, including: T206, E93, M116 and R313.
Burdick's collection is housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.  A small part of his collection is on display at the museum on the first floor of the American Wing.
