[tpl]nihongo| Kawarada Station|河原田駅|Kawarada-eki[/tpl] is a railway station in Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture, Japan, jointly operated by JR Central and the Ise Railway. The station is 44.1 rail kilometers from the terminus of the Kansai Main Line at Nagoya Station, and is officially the terminus of the Ise Railway, although most trains continue through to Yokkaichi Station.

==History==

Kawarada Station opened on December 20, 1895 as a station on the Kansai Railway. The line was nationalized on October 1, 1907, becoming part of the Japanese Government Railways (JGR) system. The station building was rebuilt in December 1915. The JGR became the Japan National Railways (JNR) after World War II. The JNR Ise Line began operations on September 1, 1973. The Ise Line was privatized on March 27, 1987, four days before the dissolution of the JNR on April 1, 1987. The present station building was completed in March 2003.
