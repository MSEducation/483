[[The Diminisher]]

CATEGORIES: 1976 births, Living people

"The Diminisher" is the alter-ego of Chicago musician David McDonnell (born  1976), who was a founding member of the trio Bablicon, bass player Griffin Rodriguez informally assigned the moniker in reference to McDonnell's liberal use of the so-called diminished chord in Bablicon songs. When Bablicon informally dissolved in 2001, he began or joined a number of experimental jazz/rock projects, such as Michael Columbia and Icy Demons, and continued composing in Chicago.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.jivemagazine.com/article.php?pid=5427|title=The Diminisher: Imaginary Volcano|date=October 9, 2006|publisher=JIVE Magazine|accessdate=2 December 2009[/tpl]
In 2006, McDonnell released a solo album on the label Unsound Records, titled Imaginary Volcano, under the name of The Diminisher.
Now, The Diminisher teaches quietly at a Midwestern musical conservatory.
