Dethcentrik is an avant-garde extreme metal project from Colorado, formed in the summer of 2009 by vocalist Stefan "Død Beverte" Klein, and guitarists Justin Torres and Michael Glass. As the band was joined by Rose Sinclair, they began to work on music, releasing their first recording, a demo version of Society's Whores on their MySpace shortly after.  The band played live for the first time on 17 April 2010.  Dethcentrik has had frequent lineup shifts since conception, and for their sound was coined "black horrormetal" by Terrorizer Magazine in the summer of 2010[ref][tpl]cite journal|title=Terrorizer|issue=200|page=3|issn=1350-6978[/tpl]
