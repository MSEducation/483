The APG II system places it alone in family Sphenostemonaceae, which is in turn left unplaced as to order in the euasterids II clade (campanulids).[tpl]cite journal |last = The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group |title = An update of the Angiosperm classification for the orders of flowering plants: APG II |journal = Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume = 141 |pages = 399â€“436 |publisher = Linnean Society of London |year = 2003 |url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1046/j.1095-8339.2003.t01-1-00158.x/pdf |accessdate = 2007-08-03 |doi = 10.1046/j.1095-8339.2003.t01-1-00158.x |issue = 4[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Since the release of the APG II system, new research has suggested a relationship between Sphenostemon and Paracryphia. As a result, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website recommends it be placed in Paracryphiaceae. This is in turn placed alone in order Paracryphiales.[tpl]cite web|last = Stevens|first = P|title = Angiosperm Phylogeny Website|publisher = Missouri Botanical Garden|date = 2001 onwards|url = http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/APweb/welcome.html|accessdate = 2007-08-03[/tpl]
