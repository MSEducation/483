"Best Maid has deep Texas roots". Mansfield News-Mirror. Mayonnaise and sandwich spread were the company's staple items until it began packing pickles in the mid-1930s. The company survived and prospered through the Great Depression and World War II and incorporated in 1952 when it moved to a newly constructed packing location in one of Fort Worth's south side neighborhoods.  
Over the years, the company slowly expanded, and now produces up to 50 million pickles each year.CADWALLER, ROBERT AND BAHARI, SARAH (March 17, 2012).

Maid, Del-Dixi, and Chef Supreme brand names. The dressing segment offers sauces and dressings under the Best Maid brand name. Best Maid operates its own fleet of trucks, and has distribution across the south-central United States.
