==Velir chiefs==

Athiyamān Nedumān Añci and his son Ezhini, were Adigaman chieftains, based in Tagadur. They were contemporaries of Auvaiyar. The Sangam poem "Thagadur yathirai", now lost, was written about his battle with the Chera king. Another Velir was Irunkōvēl who ruled from Koval (modern day Tirukovilur) on the banks of the Pennai, (the present Ponnaiyar River) which presently discharges into the sea at Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu.  It is likely that the course of the river has changed to the south over many centuries. Other Velir chiefs of repute include Alumbil Vel, Alandur Vel and Nangur Vel[tpl]cite book |editor1-last=van Bakel |editor1-first=Martin |editor2-first=Renée |editor2-last=Hagesteijn |editor3-first=Piet |editor3-last=van de Velde |first=Sudharshan |last=Seneviratne |chapter=The Twilight of the Perumakan: South Indian Polity Restructured and Incorporated |title=Pivot Politics: Changing Cultural Identities in Early State Formation Processes |year=1994 |publisher=Het Spinhuis |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-90-5589-007-1 |page=172 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TXOc1WJVpoQC[/tpl]
