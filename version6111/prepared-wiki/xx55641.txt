[[Bus station]]

CATEGORIES: Bus stations

A bus station is a structure where city or intercity buses stop to pick up and drop off passengers. It is larger than a bus stop, which is usually simply a place on the roadside, where buses can stop. It may be intended as a terminal station for a number of routes, or as a transfer station where the routes continue.
Bus station platforms may be assigned to fixed bus lines, or variable in combination with a dynamic passenger information system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vialis.nl/bin/ibp.jsp?ibpDispWhat=object&ibpPage=S13_FocusPage&ibpDispWho=STNI_ITEMS^l4429&ibpVersion=0&ibpZone=S13_Nieuwsarchief&ibpDisplay=view&|title=New hightech bus station in Amstelveen opened|date=2009-10-13|publisher=Vialis|accessdate=2010-02-07[/tpl] The latter requires fewer platforms, but does not supply the passenger the comfort of knowing the platform well in advance and waiting there.
