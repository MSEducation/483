==Plot summary==

Griffin Moss is an artist living in London who makes postcards for a living.  He is unhappy and lonely, though he is unaware of these feelings.  His life is changed forever when he receives a cryptic postcard from Sabine Strohem, a woman he has never met.  Like Griffin, she is an artist (she illustrates postage stamps) and comes from a fictional group of small islands in the South Pacific known as the Sicmon Islands (Arbah, Katie, Katin, Ta Fin, Quepol and Typ).Bantock, Nick (1991). Griffin and Sabine: An Extraordinary Correspondence. San Francisco: Chronicle Books.  The two begin to correspond regularly.
Griffin comes to realize that he is in love with Sabine, who reciprocates his feelings, and that they are soulmates.  However, his growing uncertainty as to Sabine's true nature and the changes her presence has caused in his life develop into fear and he ends up rejecting her offer for him to come see her in person.  He comes to the conclusion that Sabine is a figment of his imagination, created from his own loneliness.  It appears to be true until another postcard arrives from Sabine with an ominous promise that if he will not come to her, she will go to him:
In the second volume Sabine moves to Griffin's house in London while he wanders through Europe, North Africa, and Asia, backwards through layers of ancient civilizations â€” and of himself. 
In the final volume, the mystery of the two artists deepens and their questions grow more urgent. New obstacles (including a sinister intruder) test the tenacity of their passion, and in each letter or postcard, painting and prose are even more richly intertwined.
