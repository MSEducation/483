==MLB At Bat – streaming media==

MLBAM CEO Robert Bowman had this to say about MLBAM in an article entitled "What did you learn in 2012 that you will carry forth with you into 2013?":
 "The toughest thing to do in a poker hand and in this business is stand pat. This year we decided to make our At Bat app universal between the iPad and iPhone, which we knew going in would cost us 100,000 subscribers. We threw in At Bat for free with an MLB.tv subscription, which would also cost us revenue. And we added up a monthly At Bat subscription to get people to test the product out. We gave customers more options and a better deal, and we had a record year in paid content. We learned we're at an inflection point. Customers now understand and appreciate the nuance of content economics. You'll see more of that value pricing from us going forward."http://www.fastcompany.com/3003078/mlb-advanced-media-ceo-bob-bowman-users-adopting-and-adapting

==MLBAM Intellectual Property Problems==

===MLBAM vs. CDM Legal Case===

MLBAM signed a five-year, $50 million interactive rights deal with the MLB Players Association in 2005 to acquire most of the players' online rights, including fantasy sports. The deal exacerbated tension between fantasy sports companies and professional leagues and players associations over the rights to player profiles and statistics. The players associations of the major sports leagues believed that fantasy games using player names were subject to licensing due to the right of publicity of the players involved. During the 1980s and 1990s many companies signed licensing deals with the player associations, but many companies did not. The issue came to a head when MLBAM denied a fantasy baseball licensing agreement to St. Louis-based CBC Distribution and Marketing Inc., the parent company of CDM Sports. CBC filed suit as a result.
CBC argued that intellectual property laws and so-called "right of publicity" laws don't apply to the statistics used in fantasy sports.[tpl]cite news|title=Fantasy leagues permitted to use MLB names, stats|date=2006-08-08|url =http://sports.espn.go.co/mlb/news/story?id=2543720|work=ESPN|accessdate=2007-07-28[/tpl] The FSTA filed a friend of the court brief in support of CBC which argued that MLBAM's step to deny CBC a license was the first step to limit the number of companies in the market, that could result in MLBAM having a monopoly.
CBC won the lawsuit as U.S. District Court Judge Mary Ann Medler ruled that statistics are part of the public domain and can be used at no cost by fantasy companies. "The names and playing records of major-league baseball players as used in CBC's fantasy games are not copyrightable," Medler wrote. "Therefore, federal copyright law does not pre-empt the players' claimed right of publicity."
The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision in October 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.svmedialaw.com/Fantasy%20Baseball%20opinion.pdf |title=svmedialaw.com |publisher=svmedialaw.com |accessdate=2012-10-14[/tpl] "It would be a strange law that a person would not have a First Amendment right to use information that is available to everyone," a three-judge panel said in its ruling.[tpl]cite news|first=Bob|last=Van Voris|coauthors=Jeff St. Onge|title=Fantasy Sports Win Right to Player Names, Statistics|date=October 16, 2007|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601079&sid=aVMAY0beLSoA&refer=home|work=Bloomerberg|accessdate=2007-07-28[/tpl]
