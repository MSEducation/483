==Etymology==

Nazareth is not mentioned in pre-Christian texts and appears in many different Greek forms in the New Testament. There is no consensus regarding the origin of the name.[tpl]cite book|title=Q 4:1-13,16: the temptations of Jesus : Nazara|first1=Shawn|last1=Carruth|first2=James McConkey|last2=Robinson|first3=Christoph|last3=Heil|publisher=Peeters Publishers|year=1996|ISBN=90-6831-880-2|page=415[/tpl] One conjecture holds that "Nazareth" is derived from oneThe other is zemach. of the Hebrew words  for 'branch', namely ne·ṣer, נֵ֫צֶר, and alludes to the prophetic, messianic words in Book of Isaiah 11:1, 'from (Jesse's) roots a Branch (netzer) will bear fruit.'  One view suggests this toponym might be an example of a tribal name used by resettling groups on their return from exile.Bargil Pixner, cited in Paul Barnett,Jesus & the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times,InterVarsity Press, 2002 p.89,n.80. Alternatively, the name may derive from the verb na·ṣar, נָצַר, "watch, guard, keep,""...if the word Nazareth is be derived from Hebrew at all, it must come from this root נָצַר, naṣar, to watch" (Merrill, Selah, (1881) Galilee in the Time of Christ, p. 116. Francis Brown, S. R. Driver, Charles A. Briggs, The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon (1906/2003), p. 665.  and understood either in the sense of "watchtower" or "guard place", implying the early town was perched on or near the brow of the hill, or, in the passive sense as 'preserved, protected' in reference to its secluded position.R.H.Mounce, 'Nazareth,' in Geoffrey W. Bromiley (ed.) The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Vol.3 Eerdmans Publishing 1986, pp.500-501. The negative references to Nazareth in the Gospel of John suggest that ancient Jews did not connect the town's name to prophecy.Bauckham, Jude, Jude, Relatives of Jesus in the Early Church, pp. 64-65. See [tpl]bibleverse||John|1:46|NKJV[/tpl] and [tpl]bibleverse||John|7:41-42|NKJV[/tpl].
Another theory holds that the Greek form Nazara, used in Matthew and Luke, may derive from an earlier Aramaic form of the name, or from another Semitic language form.Carruth, 1996, p. 417. If there were a tsade (צ) in the original Semitic form, as in the later Hebrew forms, it would normally have been transcribed in Greek with a sigma instead of a zeta. This has led some scholars to question whether "Nazareth" and its cognates in the New Testament actually refer to the settlement we know traditionally as Nazareth in Lower Galilee.T. Cheyne, "Nazareth," in Encyclopaedia Biblica, 1899, col. 3358 f. For a review of the question see H. Schaeder,Nazarenos, Nazoraios, in Kittel, "Theological Dictionary of the New Testament," IV:874 f. Such linguistic discrepancies may be explained, however, by "a peculiarity of the 'Palestinian' Aramaic dialect wherein a sade (ṣ) between two voiced (sonant) consonants tended to be partially assimilated by taking on a zayin (z) sound."

===Arabic name, an-Nāṣira===

The Arabic name for Nazareth is an-Nāṣira, and Jesus ([tpl]lang-ar|يَسُوع[/tpl], Yasū` or [tpl]lang-ar|عِيسَى[/tpl], `Īsā) is also called an-Nāṣirī, reflecting the Arab tradition of according people a nisba, a name denoting from whence a person comes in either geographical or tribal terms. In the Qur'an, Christians are referred to as naṣārā, meaning "followers of an-Nāṣirī," or "those who follow Jesus."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=9cn1gwQXfgkC&pg=PA50&dq=nasira+nazareth#v=onepage&q=nasira%20nazareth&f=false|title=Syria: society, culture, and polity|first1=Richard T.|last1=Antoun|first2=Donald|last2=Quataert|editors=Richard T. Antoun|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1991|ISBN=9780791407134[/tpl] Similarly, in Maltese a Christian male is called Nisrani, whilst someone from Nazareth is called Nazzarenu. Whereas Nisrani is of direct Semitic origin, it is very likely that Nazzarenu was adopted via the Italian Nazzareno (from Latin, Nazarenus, meaning Nazarene.)

==New Testament references==

In English translations of the New Testament, the phrase "Jesus of Nazareth" appears seventeen times whereas the Greek has the form "Jesus the Nazarēnos" or "Jesus the Nazōraios. "Ναζαρηνός ("Nazarene") and its permutations are at Mk. 1:24; 10:47; 14:67; 16:6; Lk 4:34 and 24:19. Ναζωραῖος ("Nazōraean") and its permutations are at Mt 2:23; 26:71; Lk 18:37; Jn 18:5, 7; 19:19; and six times in the Acts of the Apostles. One plausible view is that Nazōraean (Ναζωραῖος) is a normal Greek adaptation of a reconstructed, hypothetical term in Jewish Aramaic for the word later used in Rabbinical sources to refer to Jesus.G.F.Moore, ‘Nazarene and Nazareth,’ in The Beginnings of Christianity 1/1, 1920 pp.426-432, according to which Hebrew Nôṣri the gentilic used of Jesus from the Tannaitic period onwards, would have corresponded to a hypothetical Jewish Aramaic *Nōṣrāyā, which would have in turn produced  *Neṣōrāyā. A normal adaptation of this in Greek would yield Nazoraios. In Carruth p.404  "Nazaréth"  is named  twelve times in surviving Greek manuscript versions of the New Testament, 10 times as Nazaréth or Nazarét,Textual evidence suggests this form is an emendation made during the secondary process of synoptic standardization.Shawn Carruth,James McConkey Robinson,Christoph Heil,Q 4:1-13,16: The Temptations of Jesus : Nazara,p.395 and twice as Nazará. The former two may retain the 'feminine' endings common in Galilean toponyms. The minor variants, Nazarat and Nazarath are also attested.Nazarat/Nazarath  are attested in a few Greek manuscripts, while the Syriac versions read Nazarath. Q 4:1-13,16: The Temptations of Jesus : Nazara, p.402. Nazara (Ναζαρά) might be the earliest form of the name in Greek, going back to the putative Q document.  It is found in [tpl]Bibleref2|Matthew|4:13[/tpl] and [tpl]Bibleref2|Luke|4:16[/tpl]. [tpl]dubious|date=January 2013[/tpl] However, the Textus Receptus clearly translates all passages as Nazara leaving little room for debate there.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G3478&t=KJV|title=Blue Letter Bible:  Lexicon[/tpl]
Many scholars have questioned a link between "Nazareth" and the terms "Nazarene" and "Nazoraean" on linguistic grounds,Cheyne in 1899 Ency. Biblica, "Nazareth"; Lidzbarski p. 878; Kennard 65:2,134 ff.; Berger Test. 38:4,323, et multi. while some affirm the possibility of etymological relation "given the idiosyncrasies of Galilean Aramaic."S. Chepey, "Nazirites in Late Second Temple Judaism" (2005), p 152, referring to W. Albright, G. Moore, and H. Schaeder.

===Extrabiblical references===

The form Nazara is also found in the earliest non-scriptural reference to the town, a citation by Sextus Julius Africanus dated about 221 CEEusebius Ecclesiastical History, 1,vii,14, cited in Carruth, ibid. p.415. (see "Middle Roman to Byzantine Periods" below). The Church Father Origen (c. 185 to 254 AD) knows the forms Nazará and Nazarét.Comment. In Joan. Tomus X (Migne, Patrologia Graeca 80:308–309. Later, Eusebius in his Onomasticon (translated by St. Jerome) also refers to the settlement as Nazara.Nazareth. The Catholic Encyclopedia, 1911. The 'nașirutha' of the scriptures of the Mandeans refers to 'priestly craft' not to Nazareth, which they identified with Qom.E. S. Drower, The Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran, Oxford University Press, 1937 reprint Gorgias Press, 2002 p.6
The first non-Christian reference to Nazareth is an inscription on a marble fragment from a synagogue found in Caesarea Maritima in 1962.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Avi-Yonah | first1 = M. | year = 1962 | title = A List of Priestly Courses from Caesarea | url = | journal = Israel Exploration Journal | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 137–139 [/tpl] This fragment gives the town's name in Hebrew as "נצרת" (n-ṣ-r-t). The inscription dates to c. AD 300 and chronicles the assignment of priests that took place at some time after the Bar Kokhba revolt, AD 132-35.R. Horsley, Archaeology, History and Society in Galilee. Trinity Press International, 1996, p. 110. (See "Middle Roman to Byzantine Periods" below.) An 8th-century AD Hebrew inscription, which was the earliest known Hebrew reference to Nazareth prior to the discovery of the inscription above, uses the same form.

===Nazarenes, Nasranis, Notzrim, Christians===

Around 331 Eusebius records that from the name Nazareth Christ was called a Nazoraean, and that in earlier centuries Christians, were once called Nazarenes.Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies: Volume 65, Issue 1 University of London. School of Oriental and African Studies - 2002 "... around 331, Eusebius says of the place name Nazareth that ' from this name the Christ was called a Nazoraean, and in ancient times we, who are now called Christians, were once called Nazarenes ';6 thus he attributes this designation ..." Tertullian (Against Marcion 4:8) records that "for this reason the Jews call us 'Nazarenes'. In the New Testament Christians are called "Christians" three times by Paul in Romans, and "Nazarenes" once by Tertullus, a Jewish lawyer. The Rabbinic and modern Hebrew name for Christians, notzrim, is also thought to derive from Nazareth, and be connected with Tertullus' charge against Paul of being a member of the sect of the Nazarenes, Nazoraioi, "men of Nazareth" in Acts. Against this some medieval Jewish polemical texts connect notzrim with the netsarim "watchmen" of Ephraim in Jeremiah 31:6. In Syrian Aramaic Natsarat (ܢܨܪܬ) is used for Nazareth, while "Nazarenes" (Acts 24:5) and "of Nazareth" are both nasraya (ܕܢܨܪܝܐ) an adjectival form.Bruce Manning Metzger The early versions of the New Testament p86 - 1977 "Peshitta Matt, and Luke ... nasraya, 'of Nazareth'."William Jennings Lexicon to the Syriac New Testament 1926 p143Robert Payne Smith Compendious Syriac Dictionary 1903 p349 Saint Thomas Christians, an ancient community of Jewish Christians in India who trace their origins to evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century, are known by the name Nasranis even today.Županov, Ines G.

==History==

===Ancient times===

Archaeological research has revealed that a funerary and cult center at Kfar HaHoresh, about two miles ([tpl]convert|2|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only[/tpl]) from current Nazareth, dates back roughly 9000 years to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B era.[ref]

[/ref] The remains of some 65 individuals were found, buried under huge horizontal headstone structures, some of which consisted of up to 3 tons of locally produced white plaster. Decorated human skulls uncovered there have led archaeologists to identify Kfar HaHoresh as a major cult centre in that era.[tpl]cite web |title=Pre-Christian Rituals at Nazareth |date=November–December 2003 |publisher=Archaeology: A Publication of the Archaeological Institute of America |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0311/newsbriefs/nazareth.html[/tpl]
In 1620 the Catholic Church purchased an area in the Nazareth basin measuring approximately [tpl]convert|100|x|150|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out[/tpl] on the side of the hill known as the Nebi Sa'in. The Franciscan priest Bellarmino Bagatti, "Director of Christian Archaeology", carried out extensive excavation of this "Venerated Area" from 1955 to 1965. Fr. Bagatti uncovered pottery dating from the Middle Bronze Age (2200 to 1500 BC) and ceramics, silos and grinding mills from the Iron Age (1500 to 586 BC) which indicated substantial settlement in the Nazareth basin at that time. However, lack of archaeological evidence for Nazareth from Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Hellenistic or Early Roman times, at least in the major excavations between 1955 and 1990, shows that the settlement apparently came to an abrupt end about 720 BC, when the Assyrians destroyed many towns in the area.

===Early Christian era===

According to the religious text Gospel of Luke, Nazareth was the home village of Mary and also the site of the Annunciation (when Mary was told by the Angel Gabriel that she would have Jesus as her son). In the Gospel of Matthew, Joseph and Mary resettled in Nazareth after returning from the flight from Bethlehem to Egypt.  The differences and possible contradictions between these two accounts of the nativity of Jesus are part of the Synoptic Problem. According to the Bible, Nazareth was also where Jesus grew up from some point in his childhood. However, some modern scholars argue that Nazareth was also the birthplace of Jesus.John P. Meier, A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus: The Roots of the Problem and the Person,Vol. 1,  Doubleday 1991, p.216; Bart D. Ehrman, Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium, Oxford University Press, 1999, p.97; E. P. Sanders, The Historical Figure of Jesus, Penguin 1993, p.85.
James F. Strange, an American archaeologist, notes: “Nazareth is not mentioned in ancient Jewish sources earlier than the third century AD. This likely reflects its lack of prominence both in Galilee and in Judaea.”Article "Nazareth" in the Anchor Bible Dictionary. New York: Doubleday, 1992. Strange originally calculated the population of Nazareth at the time of Christ to be "roughly 1,600 to 2,000 people" but, in a subsequent publication, revised this figure down to “a maximum of about 480.”E. Meyers & J. Strange, Archaeology, the Rabbis, & Early Christianity Nashville: Abingdon, 1981; Article “Nazareth” in the Anchor Bible Dictionary. New York: Doubleday, 1992. In 2009 Israeli archaeologist Yardenna Alexandre excavated archaeological remains in Nazareth that might date to the time of Jesus in the early Roman period. Alexandre told reporters, "The discovery is of the utmost importance since it reveals for the very first time a house from the Jewish village of Nazareth."House from Jesus' time excavated (December 23, 2009) in Israel 21c Innovation News Service Retrieved 2010-01-05
From the following 'It is difficult to know exactly what Luke meant in that Nazareth is built on a slope and no clear "brow" or cliff is nearby. He may have been less concerned here with the topography than with a desire to allude specifically to the martyrdom of Stephen (Acts 7:28) and possibly James (cf. Eusebius, Eccl. Hist. 2.23.11-18. Robert A. Stein, Luke, (New American Commentary, Vol. 24) B&H Publishing Group, 1993 p. 159 verse in the Gospel of Luke: 
 they led Jesus to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.[tpl]Bibleref2c|Lk.|4:29[/tpl] 
The Gospel of Luke suggests that ancient Nazareth was built on the hillside. Historic Nazareth was essentially constructed in the valley; the windy hilltops in the vicinity have only been occupied since the construction of Nazareth Illit in 1957. From the ninth century CE tradition associated Christ's evasion of the attempt on his life to the 'Hill of the Leap' (Jabal al-Qafza) overlooking the Jezreel Plain, some [tpl]convert|3|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] south of Nazareth.Denys Pringle, The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, vol.11,L-Z Cambridge University Press, 1998 p.45. Luke's account is repeated, with added details, in the Diatessaron. See Petersen, 'The Diatessaron and the Fourfold Gospel,' in Charles Horton (ed.)The Earliest Gospels: The Origins and Transmission of the Earliest Christian Gospels, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004 pp.50-68, 65-66.
[tpl]Bibleref2|Matthew|2:19-23[/tpl] reads:  After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead." So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: "He will be called a Nazarene." 
In the Gospel of John, Nathaniel asks, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"[tpl]Bibleref2c-nb|Jn|1:46[/tpl] The meaning of this cryptic question is debated. Some commentators and scholars suggest that it means Nazareth was very small and unimportant, but the question does not speak of Nazareth’s size but of its goodness. In fact, Nazareth was described negatively by the evangelists; the Gospel of Mark argues that Nazareth did not believe in Jesus and therefore he could "do no mighty work there";[tpl]Bibleref2c|Mk|6:5[/tpl] in the Gospel of Luke, the Nazarenes are portrayed as attempting to kill Jesus by throwing him off a cliff;[tpl]Bibleref2c|Lk|4:29[/tpl] in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas, and in all four canonical gospels, we read the famous saying that "a prophet is not without honor except in his own country.The Greek word patrís(πατρίς) (country) can also mean 'native town' as here. D.E.Nineham, Saint Mark, 1963, Penguin Books, p.165. "Gospel of Thomas, 31; [tpl]Bibleref2|Mark|6:4[/tpl]; [tpl]Bibleref2|Matthew|13:57[/tpl]; [tpl]Bibleref2|Luke|4:24[/tpl]; [tpl]Bibleref2|John|4:44[/tpl]
Many scholars since William Wrede (in 1901)William Wrede, Das Messiasgeheimnis in der Evangelien(1901), English translation, The Messianic Secret, Cambridge: J. Clarke, 1971. have remarked on the so-called Messianic secret in the Gospel of Mark, whereby Jesus' true nature and/or mission is portrayed as unseen by many, including by his inner circle of disciples[tpl]Bibleref2c|Mk|8:27-33[/tpl].Compare the Gospel of John's references to those to whom only the Father reveals Jesus will be saved).[tpl]Bibleref2|John|6:65[/tpl]; [tpl]Bibleref2-nb|John|17:6[/tpl]; [tpl]Bibleref2-nb|John|17:9[/tpl] Nazareth, being the home of those near and dear to Jesus, apparently suffered negatively in relation to this doctrine. Thus, Nathanael’s question, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” is consistent with a negative view of Nazareth in the canonical gospels, and with the Johannine proclamation that even his brothers did not believe in him.[tpl]Bibleref2c|Jn|7:5[/tpl]
A tablet at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, dating to 50 AD, was sent from Nazareth to Paris in 1878. It contains an inscription known as the "Ordinance of Caesar" that outlines the penalty of death for those who violate tombs or graves. However, it is suspected that this inscription came to Nazareth from somewhere else (possibly Sepphoris). Bagatti writes: “we are not certain that it was found in Nazareth, even though it came from Nazareth to Paris. At Nazareth there lived various vendors of antiquities who got ancient material from several places.”Bagatti, B. Excavations in Nazareth, vol. 1 (1969), p. 249. C. Kopp is more definite: "It must be accepted with certainty that Ordinance of Caesar… was brought to the Nazareth market by outside merchants."C. Kopp, “Beiträge zur Geschichte Nazareths.” Journal of the Palestine Oriental Society, vol. 18 (1938), p. 206, n.1. Princeton University archaeologist Jack Finnegan describes additional archaeological evidence related to settlement in the Nazareth basin during the Bronze and Iron Ages, and states that "Nazareth was a strongly Jewish settlement in the Roman period.".Jack Finnegan, The Archaeology of the New Testament, Princeton University Press: Princeton, 1992, pp. 44-46.
Epiphanius in his Panarion (c. 375 AD) numbers Nazareth among the cities devoid of a non-Jewish population.Epiphanius, Panárion 30.11.10, cited Andrew S. Jacobs,Remains of the Jews: The Holy Land and Christian Empire in Late Antiquity, Stanford University Press, p.50 n.124, p.127. Epiphanius, writing of Joseph of Tiberias, a wealthy Roman Jew who converted to Christianity in the time of Constantine, says he claimed to have received an imperial rescript to build Christian churches in Jewish towns and villages where no gentiles or Samaritans dwell, naming Tiberias, Diocaesarea, Sepphoris, Nazareth and Capernaum.Frank Williams,The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis, Book I (Sects 1-46) E. J. BRILL (1897), rev.ed. 2009, p.140. From this scarce notice, it has been concluded that a small church which encompassed a cave complex might have been located in Nazareth in the early 4th century,"Taylor, J. Christians and the Holy Places''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993, p. 265. although the town was Jewish until the 7th century AD.Taylor 229, 266; Kopp 1938:215.
Although mentioned in the New Testament gospels, there are no extant non-biblical references to Nazareth until around 200 AD, when Sextus Julius Africanus, cited by Eusebius (Church History 1.7.14), speaks of “Nazara” as a village in "Judea" and locates it near an as-yet unidentified “Cochaba.”"A few of the careful, however, having obtained private records of their own, either by remembering the names or by getting them in some other way from the registers, pride themselves on preserving the memory of their noble extraction. Among these are those already mentioned, called Desposyni, on account of their connection with the family of the Saviour. Coming from Nazara and Cochaba, villages of Judea, into other parts of the world, they drew the aforesaid genealogy from memory and from the book of daily records as faithfully as possible." (Eusebius Pamphili, Church History, Book I, Chapter VII,§ 14) In the same passage Africanus writes of desposunoi - relatives of Jesus - who he claims kept the records of their descent with great care. A few authors have argued that the absence of 1st and 2nd century AD textual references to Nazareth suggest the town may not have been inhabited in Jesus' day.[ref]T. Cheyne, “Nazareth.” Encyclopedia Biblica. London: Adam and Charles Black, 1899, Col. 3360.

===Middle Roman to Byzantine periods===

A Hebrew inscription found in Caesarea dating to the late 3rd or early 4th century mentions Nazareth as the home of the priestly Hapizzez family after the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-135 AD).The family is thought to have moved to Nazareth after the First Jewish Revolt (70 AD), although some speculate that the relocation may have been "well into the second (or even the third) century AD."  History and Society in Galilee, 1996, p. 110. In 131 AD, the Roman Emperor Hadrian forbade Jews to reside in Jerusalem, forcing Jewish residents to move elsewhere. From the three fragments that have been found, the inscription seems to be a list of the twenty-four priestly courses (cf. 1 Chronicles 24:7-19; Nehemiah 11;12), with each course (or family) assigned its proper order and the name of each town or village in Galilee where it settled. Nazareth is not spelled with the "z" sound but with the Hebrew tsade (thus "Nasareth" or "Natsareth").[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Avi-Yonah | first1 = M. | year = 1962 | title = A List of Priestly Courses from Caesarea | url = | journal = Israel Exploration Journal | volume = 12 | issue = | page = 138 [/tpl] Eleazar Kalir (a Hebrew Galilean poet variously dated from the 6th to 10th century) mentions a locality clearly in the Nazareth region bearing the name Nazareth נצרת (in this case vocalized "Nitzrat"), which was home to the descendants of the 18th Kohen family Happitzetz (הפצץ), for at least several centuries after the Bar Kochva revolt.
In the 6th century, religious narrations from local Christians about the Virgin Mary began to spark interest in the site among pilgrims, who founded the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation at the site of a freshwater spring, today known as Mary's Well. Around 570, the Anonymous of Piacenza reports travelling from Sepphoris to Nazareth. There he records seeing at the Jewish synagogue the books where Jesus learnt his letters, and a bench where he sat. According to him, Christians could lift it, but Jews could not, since it disallowed them from dragging it outside.Andrew S. Jacobs, Remains of the Jews,p.127. Writing of the beauty of the Hebrew women there, he records them saying St. Mary was a relative of theirs, and notes that, "The house of St. Mary is a basilica."P. Geyer, Itinera Hierosolymitana saeculi, Lipsiae: G. Freytag, 1898: page 161.
The Catholic writer Jerome, writing in the 5th century, says Nazareth was a viculus or mere village. The Jewish town profited from the Christian pilgrim trade which began in the 4th century, but latent anti-Christian hostility broke out in 614 AD when the Persians invaded Palestine. The Christian Byzantine author Eutychius claimed that the Jews of Nazareth helped the Persians carry out their slaughter of the Christians.C. Kopp, “Beiträge zur Geschichte Nazareths.” Journal of the Palestine Oriental Society, vol. 18 (1938), p. 215. Kopp is citing the Byzantine writer Eutychius (Eutychii Annales in Migne's Patrologia Graeca vol. 111 p. 1083). When the Byzantine or Eastern Roman emperor Heraclius ejected the Persians in 630 AD, he expelled the city's Jews.

===Islamic era===

In 1099, the Crusader Tancred captured Galilee and established his capital in Nazareth. The ancient diocese of Scythopolis was also relocated under the Archbishop of Nazareth, one of the four archdioceses in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The town returned to Muslim control in 1187 following the victory of Saladin in the Battle of Hattin. The remaining Crusaders and European clergy were forced to leave town.Dumper, p. 273. Frederick II managed to negotiate safe passage for pilgrims from Acre in 1229, and in 1251, Louis IX, the king of France, attended mass in the grotto, accompanied by his wife.
In 1263, Baybars, the Mamluk Sultan, destroyed the Christian buildings in Nazareth and declared the site off-limits to Latin clergy, as part of his bid to drive out the remaining Crusaders from Palestine. While Arab Christian families continued to live in Nazareth, its status was reduced to that of a poor village. Pilgrims who visited the site in 1294 reported only a small church protecting the grotto.
In the 14th century, Franciscan monks were permitted to return and live within the ruins of the Basilica, but they were evicted again in 1584. In 1620, Fakhr-al-Din II, a Druze emir who controlled this part of Ottoman Syria rule, permitted them to build a small church at the Grotto of the Annunciation. Pilgrimage tours to surrounding sacred sites were organized by the Franciscans, but the monks suffered harassment from surrounding Bedouin tribes who often kidnapped them for ransom. Stability returned with the rule of Daher el-Omar, a powerful Bedouin sheikh who ruled over much of the Galilee and who authorized the Franciscans to build a church in 1730. That structure stood until 1955, when it was demolished to make way for a larger building completed in 1967.
Nazareth was captured by the troops of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799, during his Syrian campaign. Napoleon visited the holy sites and considered appointing his general Junot as the duke of Nazareth. During the rule of Ibrahim Pasha (1830–1840), the Egyptian general, over much of Ottoman Syria, Nazareth was open to European missionaries and traders. After the Ottomans regained control, European money continued to flow into Nazareth and new institutions were established. The Christians of Nazareth were protected during the pogroms of 1860s by Aghil Agha, the Bedouin leader who exercised control over the Galilee between 1845 and 1870.
Kaloost Vartan, an Armenian from Istanbul, arrived in 1864 and established the first medical missionary in Nazareth, the Scottish "hospital on the hill", or the Nazareth Hospital as it is known today, with sponsorship from the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society. The Ottoman Sultan, who favored the French, allowed them to establish an orphanage, the Society of Saint Francis de Sale. By the late 19th century, Nazareth was a town with a strong Arab Christian presence and a growing European community, where a number of communal projects were undertaken and new religious buildings were erected. In 1871 Christ Church, the city's only Anglican church, was completed under the leadership of the Rev John Zeller and consecrated by Bp Samuel Gobat.[tpl]cite journal|last=Miller|first=Duane Alexander|title=Christ Church (Anglican) in Nazareth: a brief history with photographs|journal=St Francis Magazine|date=October 2012|volume=8|issue=5|pages=696–703|url=http://www.stfrancismagazine.info/ja/images/stories/DuaneMiller-oct2012.pdf[/tpl]

===State of Israel===

Nazareth was in the territory allotted to the Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. The town was not a field of battle during 1948 Arab-Israeli War before the first truce on 11 June, although some of the villagers had joined the loosely organized peasant military and paramilitary forces, and troops from the Arab Liberation Army had entered Nazareth. During the ten days of fighting which occurred between the first and second truce, Nazareth capitulated to Israeli troops during Operation Dekel on 16 July, after little more than token resistance. The surrender was formalized in a written agreement, where the town leaders agreed to cease hostilities in return for promises from the Israeli officers, including brigade commander Ben Dunkelman (the leader of the operation), that no harm would come to the civilians of the town.
The town remained under Martial Law until 1966.
The Israeli government has designated a Nazareth metropolitan area that includes the local councils of Yafa an-Naseriyye to the south, Reineh, Mashhad and Kafr Kanna to the north, Iksal and Nazareth Illit to the east and Migdal HaEmek to the west.
Preparations for the Pope's visit to Nazareth in 2000 triggered highly publicized tensions related to the Basilica of the Annunciation. In 1997, permission was granted to construct a paved plaza to handle the thousands of Christian pilgrims expected to arrive. The Muslims protested and occupied the site, where a nephew of Saladin is believed to be buried. A school, al-Harbyeh, had been built on the site by the Ottomans, and the Shihab-Eddin shrine, along with several shops owned by the waqf, were located there. Government approval of plans for a large mosque on the property triggered protests from Christian leaders around the world. In 2002, a special government commission permanently halted construction of the mosque.[tpl]cite web |title=Final Bar on Controversial Nazareth Mosque |date=March 4, 2002 |publisher=Catholic World News |url=http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=17590[/tpl]

==Geography==

Two locations for Nazareth are cited in ancient texts: the Galilean (northern) location in the Christian gospels and a southern (Judean) location mentioned in several early noncanonical texts.(a) The Protevangelium of James(c. 150 AD. See New Testament Apocrypha, ed. W. Schneemelcher, Westminster/John Knox Press, 1991, vol. 1, p. 421 ff.) was an immensely popular text in the early Christian centuries. In it, Jesus' family lives in Bethlehem of Judea (PrJ 8.3; 17:1) and all events take place in and around the southern town. PrJ does not once mention Galilee, nor "Nazareth." (b) The earliest reference to Nazareth outside the Christian gospels, by Sextus Julius Africanus (c. 200 AD), speaks of “Nazara” as a village in "Judea" and locates it near an as-yet unidentified “Cochaba.” (c) A fourth century work known as the History of Joseph the Carpenter knows a southern location for Nazareth. It locates "Nazareth," the home of Joseph, within walking distance of the Jerusalem Temple.
Modern-day Nazareth is nestled in a natural bowl which reaches from 1,050 feet (320 m) above sea level to the crest of the hills about 1,600 feet (490 m).Map Survey of Palestine, 1946. 1:5,000 OCLC: 17193107.

==Demography==

Nazareth is the largest Arab city in Israel.[tpl]cite web|author=Yurit Naffe|publisher=State of Israel Central Bureau of Statistics|title=Statistilite 15: Population|date=October 2001[/tpl] Until the beginning of the British Mandate in Palestine (1922–1948), the population was predominantly Arab Christian (majority Orthodox Christians), with an Arab Muslim minority. Nazareth today still has a significant Christian population, made up of Maronites, Orthodox Christians, Roman Catholic, Melkite Catholics, Anglicans, Baptists, Evangelicals and Copts, among others. The Muslim population has grown, for a number of historical factors, that include the city having served as administrative center under British rule, and the influx of internally displaced Palestinians absorbed into the city from neighbouring towns during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.
In 2009, the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics reported that Nazareth's population was 69% Muslim and 30.9% Christian.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/publications11/local_authorities09/pdf/254_7300.pdf|title= Nazareth Census 2009|publisher=Cbs.gov.il|accessdate=2012-11-16[/tpl] The current mayor is a Christian. The greater Nazareth metropolis area had a population of 210,000, including 125,000 (59%) Israeli Arabs and 85,000 Jews (41%). It is the only urban area with over 50,000 residents in Israel where the majority of the population is Arab.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/population/new_2007/table3.pdf|title= Israeli localities with populations 1000+|publisher=Cbs.gov.il|accessdate=2012-11-16[/tpl]

==Economy==

In 2011, Nazareth had over 20 Arab high-tech companies, mostly in the field of software development. According to Haaretz newspaper the city has been called the "Silicon Valley of the Arab community" in view of its potential in this sphere.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl]

==Archaeology==

According to the Israel Antiquities Authority, "The artifacts recovered from inside the building were few and mostly included fragments of pottery vessels from the Early Roman period (the first and second centuries AD)... Another hewn pit, whose entrance was apparently camouflaged, was excavated and a few pottery sherds from the Early Roman period were found inside it." Alexandre adds that "based on other excavations that I conducted in other villages in the region, this pit was probably hewn as part of the preparations by the Jews to protect themselves during the Great Revolt against the Romans in 67 AD".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early+History+-+Archaeology/Residential_building_time_Jesus_Nazareth_21-Dec-2009.htm |title=Residential building from the time of Jesus exposed in Nazareth 21-Dec-2009 |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |date=2009-12-21 |accessdate=2012-11-16[/tpl]
Noteworthy is that all the post-Iron Age tombs in the Nazareth basin (approximately two dozen) are of the kokh (plural kokhim) or later types; this type probably first appeared in Galilee in the middle of the 1st century AD.H.P. Kuhnen, "Palaestina in Griechisch-Roemischer Zeit," (Muenchen, C. Beck, 1990, pp. 254-55). Kokh tombs in the Nazareth area have been excavated by B. Bagatti, N. Feig, Z. Yavor, and noted by Z. Gal.Gal, Z. Lower Galilee During the Iron Age (American Schools of Oriental Research, Eisenbrauns, 1992) p. 15; Yavor, Z. 1998 "Nazareth", ESI 18. pp. 32 (English), 48; Feig, N. 1990 "Burial Caves at Nazareth", 'Atiqot 10 (Hebrew series). pp. 67-79.
Excavations conducted prior to 1931 in the Franciscan venerated area revealed no trace of a Greek or Roman settlement there,R. Tonneau, Revue Biblique XL (1931), p. 556. Reaffirmed by C. Kopp (op. cit.,1938, p. 188). Fr. Bagatti, who acted as the principal archaeologist for the venerated sites in Nazareth, unearthed quantities of later Roman and Byzantine artifacts,B. Bagatti, Excavations in Nazareth, vol. 1 (1969), pp. 272-310. attesting to unambiguous human presence there from the 2nd century AD onward. John Dominic Crossan, a noted New Testament scholar, remarked that Bagatti's archaeological drawings indicate just how small the village actually was, suggesting that it was little more than an insignificant hamlet.John Dominic Crossan, The Historical Jesus : The Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant, 1992, p. 18
