Alum [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|əm[/tpl] is both a specific chemical compound and a class of chemical compounds. The specific compound is the hydrated potassium aluminium sulfate (potassium alum) with the formula KAl([tpl]chem|link=sulfate|SO|4[/tpl])2·12[tpl]chem|link=water|H|2|O[/tpl]. More widely, alums are double sulfate salts, with the formula [tpl]chem|AM(SO|4|)|2|·12H|2|O[/tpl], where A is a monovalent cation such as potassium or ammonium and M is a trivalent metal ion such as aluminium or chromium(III).[tpl]cite book|last=Austin|first=George T.|title=Shreve's Chemical process industries.|year=1984|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780070571471|pages=357|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=12ahTF69BAEC&pg=PA357&lpg=PA357&dq=alums|edition=5th ed.[/tpl]

==Chemical properties==

Alums are useful for a range of industrial processes. They are soluble in water; have a sweetish taste; react acid to litmus; and crystallize in regular octahedra. When heated they liquefy; and if the heating is continued, the water of crystallization is driven off, the salt froths and swells, and at last an amorphous powder remains. They are astringent and acidic.

===Industrial uses===

Potassium alum is the common alum of commerce, although soda alum, ferric alum, and ammonium alum are manufactured.
Alum has been used at least since Roman times for purification of drinking water[tpl]cite book|title=Chemistry of water treatment|year=1999|publisher=Ann Arbor Press|location=Chelsea, MI|isbn=9781575040110|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ivLiNH-NjOcC&pg=PA217&lpg=PA217&dq=alum+flocculation|author=Samuel D.

==History==

===In antiquity===

The word 'alumen' occurs in Pliny's Natural History. In the 52nd chapter of his 35th book, he gives a detailed description. By comparing this with the account of 'stupteria' given by Dioscorides in the 123rd chapter of his 5th book, it is obvious the two are identical. Pliny informs us that 'alumen' was found naturally in the earth. He calls it 'salsugoterrae'. Different substances were distinguished by the name of 'alumen', but they were all characterised by a certain degree of astringency, and were all employed in dyeing and medicine, the light-colored alumen being useful in brilliant dyes, the dark-colored only in dyeing black or very dark colors. One species was a liquid, which was apt to be adulterated; but when pure it had the property of blackening when added to pomegranate juice. This property seems to characterize a solution of iron sulfate in water; a solution of ordinary (potassium) alum would possess no such property. Pliny says that there is another kind of alum that the Greeks call 'schiston', and which "splits into filaments of a whitish colour", From the name 'schiston' and the mode of formation, it appears that this species was the salt that forms spontaneously on certain salty minerals, as alum slate and bituminous shale, and consists chiefly of sulfates of iron and aluminium.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] In some places the iron sulfate may have been lacking, so the salt would be white and would answer, as Pliny says it did, for dyeing bright colors. Pliny describes several other species of alumen but it is not clear as to what these minerals are.
The alumen of the ancients then, was not always the same as the alum of the moderns. They knew how to produce alum from alunite, as this process is archaeologically attested on the island Lesbos.A. Archontidou 2005, "Un atelier de preparation de l'alun a partir de l'alunite dans l'isle de Lesbos" in L'alun de Mediterranée. ed P. Borgard et al. This site was abandoned in the 7th century but dates back at least to the 2nd century CE. Native alumen from Melos appears to have been a mixture mainly of alunogen ([tpl]chem|Al|2|(SO|4|)|3|·17H|2|O[/tpl]) with alum and other minor sulfates.A. J. Hall & E. Photos-Jones "The nature of Melian alumen and its potential for exploitation in Antiquity" in Bogard The western desert of Egypt was a major source of alum substitutes in antiquity. These evaporites were mainly [tpl]chem|FeAl|2|(SO|4|)|4|·22H|2|O[/tpl], [tpl]chem|MgAl|2|(SO|4|)|4|·22H|2|O[/tpl], [tpl]chem|NaAl(SO|4|)|2|·6H|2|O[/tpl], [tpl]chem|MgSO|4|·7H|2|O[/tpl] and [tpl]chem|Al|2|(SO|4|)|3|·17H|2|O[/tpl].M.Picon et al. 2005, "L'alun des oasis occidentales d'Egypte: researches sur terrain et recherches en laboratoire" in Bogard Contamination with iron sulfate was greatly disliked as this darkened and dulled dye colours. They were acquainted with a variety of substances of varying degrees of purity by the names of misy, sory, and chalcanthum. As alum and green vitriol were applied to a variety of substances in common, and as both are distinguished by a sweetish and astringent taste, writers, even after the discovery of alum, do not seem to have discriminated the two salts accurately from each other. In the writings of the alchemists we find the words misy, sory, chalcanthum applied to alum as well as to iron sulfate; and the name atramentum sutorium, which one might expect to belong exclusively to green vitriol, applied indifferently to both. Various minerals are employed in the manufacture of alum, the most important being alunite, alum schist, bauxite and cryolite.

===Alchemical and later discoveries and uses===

In the 18th century, J. H. Pott and Andreas Sigismund Marggraf demonstrated that alumina was a constituent. Pott in his Lithogeognosia showed that the precipitate obtained when an alkali is poured into a solution of alum is quite different from lime and chalk, with which it had been confounded by G.E. Stahl. Marggraf showed that alumina is one of the constituents of alum, but that this earth possesses peculiar properties, and is one of the ingredients in common clay. He also showed that crystals of alum can be obtained by dissolving alumina in sulfuric acid and evaporating the solutions, and when a solution of potash or ammonia is dropped into this liquid, it immediately deposits perfect crystals of alum.
Torbern Bergman also observed that the addition of potash or ammonia made the solution of alumina in sulfuric acid crystallize, but that the same effect was not produced by the addition of soda or of lime, and that potassium sulfate is frequently found in alum.
After M.H. Klaproth had discovered the presence of potassium in leucite and lepidolite, it occurred to L. N. Vauquelin that it was probably an ingredient likewise in many other minerals. Knowing that alum cannot be obtained in crystals without the addition of potash, he began to suspect that this alkali constituted an essential ingredient in the salt, and in 1797 he published a dissertation demonstrating that alum is a double salt, composed of sulfuric acid, alumina, and potash. Soon after, J.A. Chaptal published the analysis of four different kinds of alum, namely, Roman alum, Levant alum, British alum and alum manufactured by himself. This analysis led to the same result as Vauquelin.

===Early uses in industry===

Egyptians reportedly used the coagulant alum as early as 1500 BC to reduce the visible cloudiness (turbidity) in the water. Alum was imported into England mainly from the Middle East, and, from the late 15th century onwards, the Papal States for hundreds of years. Its use there was as a dye-fixer (mordant) for wool (which was one of England's primary industries, the value of which increased significantly if dyed). These sources were unreliable, however, and there was a push to develop a source in England especially as imports from the Papal States were ceased following the excommunication of Henry VIII. With state financing, attempts were made throughout the 16th century, but without success until early on in the 17th century. An industry was founded in Yorkshire to process the shale, which contained the key ingredient, aluminium sulfate, and made an important contribution to the Industrial Revolution. One of the oldest historic sites for the production of alum from shale and human urine are the Peak alum works in Ravenscar, North Yorkshire.
Alum (known as turti/sphatika in local languages) was also used for water treatment by Indians for thousands of years.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] Ayurveda describes sphatika as an astringent, haemostatic, antiseptic. It has anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic and antibiotic properties. Sphatika’s use in treating tonsillitis has been referred in ancient Ayurvedic texts. Sphatika is used internally as well as externally.

==Production==

===From alunite===

In order to obtain alum from alunite, it is calcined and then exposed to the action of air for a considerable time. During this exposure it is kept continually moistened with water, so that it ultimately falls to a very fine powder. This powder is then lixiviated with hot water and sulfuric acid, the liquor decanted, and the alum allowed to crystallize. The alum schists employed in the manufacture of alum are mixtures of iron pyrite, aluminium silicate and various bituminous substances, and are found in upper Bavaria, Bohemia, Belgium, and Scotland. These are either roasted or exposed to the weathering action of the air. In the roasting process, sulfuric acid is formed and acts on the clay to form aluminium sulfate, a similar condition of affairs being produced during weathering. The mass is now systematically extracted with water, and a solution of aluminium sulfate of specific gravity 1.16 is prepared. This solution is allowed to stand for some time (in order that any calcium sulfate and basic ferric sulfate may separate), and is then evaporated until ferrous sulfate crystallizes on cooling; it is then drawn off and evaporated until it attains a specific gravity of 1.40. It is now allowed to stand for some time, decanted from any sediment, and finally mixed with the calculated quantity of potassium sulfate, well agitated, and the alum is thrown down as a finely divided precipitate of alum meal. If much iron should be present in the shale then it is preferable to use potassium chloride in place of potassium sulfate.

===From clays or bauxite===

In the preparation of alum from clays or from bauxite, the material is gently calcined, then mixed with sulfuric acid and heated gradually to boiling; it is allowed to stand for some time, the clear solution drawn off and mixed with acid potassium sulfate and allowed to crystallize. When cryolite is used for the preparation of alum, it is mixed with calcium carbonate and heated. By this means, sodium aluminate is formed; it is then extracted with water and precipitated either by sodium bicarbonate or by passing a current of carbon dioxide through the solution. The precipitate is then dissolved in sulfuric acid, the requisite amount of potassium sulfate added and the solution allowed to crystallize.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]

==Types==

Many trivalent metals are capable of forming alums. The general form of an alum is AMIII(SO4)2·nH2O, where A is an alkali metal or ammonium, MIII is a trivalent metal, and n often is 12. In general, alums are easier formed when the alkali metal atom is larger. This rule was first stated by Locke in 1902:[tpl]cite journal |author = J. Locke |year = 1902 |title = On some double sulphates of thallic thallium and caesium |journal = American Chemical journal |volume = 27 | pages = 281 [/tpl]
Double sulfates with the general formula [tpl]chem|A|2|SO|4|·B|2|(SO|4|)|3|·24H|2|O[/tpl], are known where A is a monovalent cation such as sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, or thallium(I), or a compound cation such as ammonium ([tpl]chem|NH|4|+[/tpl]), methylammonium ([tpl]chem|CH|3|NH|3|+[/tpl]), hydroxylammonium ([tpl]chem|HONH|3|+[/tpl]) or hydrazinium ([tpl]chem|N|2|H|5|+[/tpl]), B is a trivalent metal ion, such as aluminium, chromium, titanium, manganese, vanadium, iron(III), cobalt(III), gallium, molybdenum, indium, ruthenium, rhodium, or iridium.Greenwood, N. N.; & Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. ISBN 0-7506-3365-4. Analogous selenates also occur. The specific combinations of univalent cation, trivalent cation, and anion depends on the sizes of the ions. For example, unlike the other alkali metals the smallest one, lithium, does not form alums, and there is only one known sodium alum. In some cases, solid solutions of alums occur.
Alums crystallize in one of three different crystal structures. These classes are called α-, β- and γ-alums.

===Potash alum===

Aluminum potassium sulfate, potash alum, [tpl]chem|KAl(SO|4|)|2|·12H|2|O[/tpl] is used as an astringent and antisepsis in various food preparation processes such as pickling and fermentation and as a flocculant for water purification, among other things. A common method of producing potash alum is leaching of alumina from bauxite, which is then reacted with potassium sulfate. As a naturally occurring mineral, potash alum is known as alum-(K). Other potassium aluminium sulfate minerals are alunite ([tpl]chem|KAl(SO|4|)|2|·2Al(OH)|3[/tpl]) and kalinite ([tpl]chem|KAl(SO|4|)|2|·11H|2|O[/tpl]).

===Soda alum===

Soda alum, [tpl]chem|NaAl(SO|4|)|2|·12H|2|O[/tpl], mainly occurs in nature as the mineral mendozite. It is very soluble in water, and is extremely difficult to purify. In the preparation of this salt, it is preferable to mix the component solutions in the cold, and to evaporate them at a temperature not exceeding 60 °C. 100 parts of water dissolve 110 parts of sodium alum at 0 °C, and 51 parts at 16 °C. Soda alum is used in the acidulent of food as well as in the manufacture of baking powder.

===Ammonium alum===

Ammonium alum, [tpl]chem|NH|4|Al(SO|4|)|2|·12H|2|O[/tpl], a white crystalline double sulfate of aluminium, is used in water purification, in vegetable glues, in porcelain cements, in deodorants (though potassium alum is more commonly used), in tanning, dyeing and in fireproofing textiles.

===Chrome alum===

Chrome alum, [tpl]chem|KCr(SO|4|)|2|·12H|2|O[/tpl], a dark violet crystalline double sulfate of chromium and potassium, was used in tanning.

===Selenate-containing alums===

Alums are also known that contain selenium in place of sulfur in the sulfate anion, making selenate ([tpl]chem|SeO|4|2-[/tpl]) instead. They are called selenium- or selenate-alums. They are strong oxidizing agents.

===Aluminium sulfate===

Aluminium sulfate is referred to as papermaker's alum. Although reference to this compound as alum is quite common in industrial communication, it is not regarded as technically correct. Its properties are quite different from those of the set of alums described above. Most industrial flocculation done with alum is actually aluminum sulfate.

==Solubility==

The solubility of the various alums in water varies greatly, sodium alum being readily soluble in water, while caesium and rubidium alums are only sparingly soluble. The various solubilities are shown in the following table.

==Related compounds==

In addition to the alums, which are dodecahydrates, double sulfates and selenates of univalent and trivalent cations occur with other degrees of hydration. These materials may also be referred to as alums, including the undecahydrates such as mendozite and kalinite, hexahydrates such as guanidinium ([tpl]chem|CH|6|N|3|+[/tpl]) and dimethylammonium ([tpl]chem|(CH|3|)|2|NH|2|+[/tpl]) "alums", tetrahydrates such as goldichite, monohydrates such as thallium plutonium sulfate and anhydrous alums (yavapaiites). These classes include differing, but overlapping, combinations of ions.
A pseudo alum is a double sulfate of the typical formula [tpl]chem|ASO|4|·B|2|(SO|4|)|3|·22H|2|O[/tpl], where A is a divalent metal ion, such as cobalt (wupatkiite), manganese (apjohnite), magnesium (pickingerite) or iron (halotrichite or feather alum), and B is a trivalent metal ion.
A Tutton salt is a double sulfate of the typical formula [tpl]chem|A|2|SO|4|·BSO|4|·6H|2|O[/tpl], where A is a univalent cation, and B a divalent metal ion.
Double sulfates of the composition [tpl]chem|A|2|SO|4|·2BSO|4[/tpl], where A is a univalent cation and B is a divalent metal ion are referred to as langbeinites, after the prototypical potassium magnesium sulfate.
