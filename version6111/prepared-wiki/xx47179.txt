The Holy Roman Empire was a highly decentralized state for most of its history, composed of hundreds of smaller states, most of which operated with some degree of independent sovereignty.  Although in the earlier part of the Middle Ages, under the Salian and Hohenstaufen emperors, it was relatively centralized, as time went on the Emperor lost more and more power to the Princes.  The membership of the Imperial Diet in 1792, late in the Empire's history but before the beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars, gives some insight as to the composition of the Holy Roman Empire at that time.

==Structure of the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire in 1792==

The year 1792 was just before the vast changes inspired by the French Revolutionary incursions into Germany.  The empire was, at that time, divided into several thousand  immediate  (unmittelbar) territories, but only about three hundred of these had Landeshoheit (the special sort of sovereignty enjoyed by the states of the Empire), and had representation in the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire (German Reichstag). The Imperial Diet was divided into three so-called collegia — the Council of Electors, the Council of Princes, and the Council of Cities.  As those who received votes had gradually changed over the centuries, many princes held more than one vote.  Certain territories which had once held votes in the Diet, as for instance the County of Waldeck or the Duchy of Jülich-Kleve-Berg, no longer retained them, due to the extinction of a dynasty or other causes.

===The Council of Electors===

The council included the following eight members:

===The Council of Princes===

This is ordered based on the official order of voting in the Diet:

====The Ecclesiastical Bench====

====The Secular Bench====

===The Council of Cities===

The Council of Imperial Free Cities was not actually equal to the others — its vote was only advisory.  In 1792, there were 51 Free Cities, divided amongst two benches.

====Rhenish Bench====

====Swabian Bench====

===Membership of single-vote colleges===

The two benches of the Council of Princes each contained single-vote colleges. The membership of each of these was as follows:

====The Prelates of Swabia====

====The Prelates of the Rhine====

====The Counts of the Wetterau====

====The Counts of Swabia====

====The Counts of Franconia====

====The Counts of Westphalia====
