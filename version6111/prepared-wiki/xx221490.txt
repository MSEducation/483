Agenda 2000 was an action programme of the European Union whose main objectives were to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and Regional policy, and establish a new financial framework for the years 2000â€“06 with a view to the then upcoming Eastern Enlargement of the European Union.
Its stated goals were:
1. "to update the European Model of Agriculture"
2. "to narrow the gaps in wealth and economic prospects between regions "
3. "to honour priorities while enjoying only very modest increases in budget
income until 2006"
The reforms were first outlined in the documents with the title "Agenda 2000" published by the Commission in July 1997. Reforms were finally agreed by the 15 EU countries at the European Council meeting in Berlin in March 1999. Detailed legislation was later drafted and agreed to by all of the EU institutions.
