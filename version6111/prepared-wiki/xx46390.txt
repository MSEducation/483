St. Vith was an important marketplace for the region by the 12th century and received town rights in 1350. The town was burnt in 1543, 1602, and 1689. It was part of Luxembourg until the defeat of Napoleon.
As a result of the Congress of Vienna it was given to Prussia.

An important road and railway junction, St. Vith was fought over in the 1944 Battle of the Bulge during World War II. The United States Army defended the town against German assault for a few days, delaying the German attack plan, before eventually retreating.
