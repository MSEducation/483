The September Six were six members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who were excommunicated or disfellowshipped by the LDS Church (whose members are known as the Mormons) in September 1993, allegedly for publishing scholarly work against Mormon doctrine or criticizing Church doctrine or leadership. The term "September Six" was coined by The Salt Lake Tribune and the term was used in the media and subsequent discussion. The LDS Church's action was referred to by some as evidence of an anti-intellectual posture on the part of LDS leadership.One Nation Under Gods,  Richard Abanes, p.417-419

==Church measures against the September Six==

Except for Lynne Kanavel Whitesides, all of the September Six were excommunicated;  Whitesides was disfellowshipped, a lesser sanction that does not formally expel one from church membership. To date, three of the September Six have retained or regained church membership:  Avraham GileadiFidel, Steve. "Scholar Rebaptized Into LDS Church." Salt Lake City and Utah Breaking News. Deseret News, 8 Mar. 1996. Web. 09 Nov. 2012. and Maxine Hanks,Stack, Peggy Fletcher. "Excommunicated Mormon to Tell How She Came Back to the Faith." Utah Local News - Salt Lake City News, Sports, Archive. The Salt Lake Tribune, 26 July 2012. Web. 09 Nov. 2012. who were rebaptized, and Lynne Whitesides, who is still disfellowshipped.[tpl]citation needed | date = February 2011[/tpl]
While the LDS Church sometimes announces when a prominent member has been excommunicated, LDS leaders' policy is to refuse to publicly discuss details about the reasons for any excommunication, even if details of the proceedings are made public by that person. Such disciplinary proceedings are typically undertaken locally, initiated by leaders at the ward or stake level, but at least one of the September Six has suggested his excommunication was orchestrated by higher-ranking LDS Church leaders.[tpl]cite web|last=Haglund|first=David|title=The Case of the Mormon Historian|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/faithbased/2012/11/d_michael_quinn_and_mormon_excommunication_the_complicated_life_of_a_mormon.single.html|accessdate=28 November 2012[/tpl]  Procedures pertaining to the organization of these disciplinary councils is found in the sacred LDS text Doctrine and Covenants, Section 102, as well as in the Church's administrative Handbook of Instructions; when a member is brought into these councils they are notified beforehand by the local leaders of the Church in that area.
Other than the summons sent to each of the six (specifying them as "contrary to the laws and order of the church"), the LDS Church's point of view is missing as to why each of the September Six was excommunicated. Based on their own comments and other sources, the following brief bios offer some perspective regarding the six individuals' discipline and their current relationship to Mormonism.

==Short biographies of the six individuals==

===Lynne Kanavel Whitesides===

Lynne Kanavel Whitesides is a feminist noted for speaking on the Mother in Heaven. Whitesides was the first of the group to experience church discipline. She was disfellowshipped September 14, 1993. Though technically still a member, Whitesides claims that she "burst" out of the Church and her marriage in 1993, and now considers herself a practitioner of Native American philosophies.Whitesides, Lynne.

===Avraham Gileadi===

Avraham Gileadi is a Hebrew scholar and literary analyst who is considered theologically conservative. He authored two books, one about Isaiah and one about the last days,  which were published by LDS-owned Deseret Book. The second book, which took a more limited interpretation of its subject than Mormon theology generally accepts, was later pulled from the shelves.[tpl]cite web |url=http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=4&num=1&id=86 |title=The Book of Isaiah: A New Translation with Interpretive Keys from the Book of Mormon |accessdate=2011-07-10 |last=Porter |first=Bruce |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher= Maxwell Institute [/tpl] The reasons for his excommunication on September 15 are unclear. According to Margaret Toscano (whose husband was among the September Six and who would also later be excommunicated), Gileadi's "books interpreting Mormon scripture challenged the exclusive right of leaders to define doctrine",[tpl]citation |url= http://www.thelizlibrary.org/undelete/library/library012.html |contribution= What other judgment can I judge by but my own? |work= The Liz Library |first= Margaret Merrill |last= Toscano |date= nd |publisher= Irene Stuber at undelete.org, reprinted by The Liz Library [/tpl][tpl]rs|date=April 2014[/tpl] a characterization that Gileadi himself disputes. The church afterwards reversed its disciplinary action against him and expunged it from the church's records, as if it never happened.[tpl]citation |url= http://avrahamgileaditestimony.blogspot.com |title= Avraham Gileadi Testimony |accessdate= 2012-06-12 |date= 14 June 2012 |work= Judeo-Mormon Perspectives |publisher= Blogger [/tpl] Gileadi is currently an active member of the church.[tpl]cite web |url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=840 |title=Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism |accessdate=2012-08-19 |last=Hanks |first=Maxine |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Signature Books[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mail-archive.com/zion@topica.com/msg04375.html |title=The September Six Today |accessdate=2009-02-14 |last=Redelfs |first=John W. |coauthors= |date=2003-08-09 |work= |publisher=The Mail Archive[/tpl] He has since written works on Isaiah, including The Literary Message of Isaiah (2002) and Isaiah Decoded: Ascending the Ladder to Heaven (2002).

===Paul Toscano===

Paul ToscanoSee, www.paultoscano.com is a Salt Lake City attorney who co-authored with Margaret Merrill Toscano a controversial book, Strangers in Paradox: Explorations in Mormon Theology (1990), and, in 1992, co-founded The Mormon Alliance; he later wrote the book  The Sanctity of Dissent (1994) and its sequel  The Sacrament of Doubt (2007).
He was excommunicated from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on September 19, 1993; the reasons for his excommunication, as reportedly given by church leaders, were apostasy and false teaching. According to Toscano, the actual reason was insubordination in refusing to curb his sharp criticism of LDS Church leaders' preference for legalism, ecclesiastical tyranny, white-washed Mormon history, and hierarchical authoritarianism that privilege the image of the corporate LDS Church above its commitment to its members, to the teachings and revelations of Joseph Smith its founding Prophet, and to the gospel of Jesus Christ.[tpl]cite book |last=Toscano |first= Paul |chapter="The Sanctity of Dissent" |title= Dissent and the Failure of Leadership |editor= Stephen Banks (ed.), series ed.

In 2007, Toscano wrote that he lost his faith "like losing your eyesight after an accident" and that he regrets that LDS Church leaders have disregarded his criticisms of what he considers the Church's growing anti-intellectualism, homophobia, misogyny, and elitism.[tpl]cite book|last=Toscano|first=Paul|title=The Sacrament of Doubt|publisher=Signature Books|year=2007|isbn=1-56085-146-5|pages=147–156[/tpl]
His wife MargaretSee, www.margarettoscano.com faced her own ecclesiastical tribunal for her doctrinal and feminist views and was excommunicated on the 30th of November 2000.  Technically, she was part of the September Six (or "seven") summoned in 1993, but ecclesiastical focus shifted to her husband so Margaret's discipline was delayed until 2000.''Tidying Up Loose Ends?: The November 2000 Excommunication of Margaret Toscano, 2001 Salt Lake Sunstone Symposium, Sunstone Magazine.
