Phillip Calvin "Phil" McGraw (born September 1, 1950), known as Dr. Phil, is an American television personality, author, psychologist, and the host of the television show Dr. Phil, which debuted in 2002.

==Early life==

McGraw was born in Vinita, Oklahoma, the son of Anne Geraldine "Jerry" (née Stevens) and Joseph J. "Joe" McGraw, Jr.http://www.timesrecordnews.com/news/2011/jun/19/geraldine-jerrie-mcgraw/ He grew up with two older sisters, Deana and Donna, and younger sister Brenda[tpl]cite web | author=|url=http://drphil.com/shows/show/64 | title=Birth Order: Dr. Phil's Sisters Talk |year=2002|publisher=Peteski Productions, Inc.| accessdate=January 14, 2008[/tpl] in the oilfields of North Texas where his father was an equipment supplier. During McGraw's childhood, his family moved so his father could pursue and obtain a lifelong goal of becoming a psychologist.
McGraw attended Shawnee Mission North High School in  Overland Park, Kansas. In 1968, he was awarded a football scholarship to the University of Tulsa, where he played middle linebacker under Coach Glenn Dobbs. On November 23 of that year, McGraw's team lost to the University of Houston 100–6, which is one of the most lopsided games in college football history.[tpl]cite web | author=University of Tulsa|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/tuls/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2007FBrecords.pdf | title=2007 Golden Hurricane Football Media Guide |publisher=University of Tulsa| accessdate=January 7, 2008|format=PDF[/tpl] Coach Dobbs retired after that season and McGraw transferred to Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas.

==Education and career==

McGraw graduated in 1975 from Midwestern State University with a B.A. degree in psychology. He went on to earn a M.A. degree in experimental psychology in 1976, and a Ph.D. degree in clinical psychology in 1979 at the University of North Texas,[tpl]cite web | author=|url=http://www.unt.edu/northtexan/archives/s06/alumniawards.htm | title=University of North Texas North Texan Online Summer 2006: Honored Alumni |publisher=University of North Texas| accessdate=January 7, 2008[/tpl] where his dissertation was titled "Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Psychological Intervention"."Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Psychological Intervention" Scholar.Google.com McGraw was guided through the doctoral program by Frank Lawlis, who later became the primary contributing psychologist for the Dr. Phil television show.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.franklawlis.com/bio.htm|title=Frank Lawlis BIO|accessdate=January 22, 2009|publisher=Dr. Frank Lawlis|year=2009|author=Anon[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]
After obtaining his doctorate, McGraw joined his father, Joe McGraw, in Wichita Falls, Texas, where the elder McGraw had established his private psychology practice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/65557|title=Paging Doctor Phil|accessdate=January 13, 2008|publisher=Newsweek|year=2002|author=Marc Peyser[/tpl]
In 1983, McGraw and his father joined Thelma Box, a successful Texas businesswoman, in presenting "Pathways" seminars, "experience-based training which allows individuals to achieve and create their own results."[tpl]cite web|url=http://gopathways.org/about_pathways.htm|title=About Pathways|accessdate=September 29, 2008|publisher=Pathways Core Training|year=2007|author=Pathways Core Training[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]  Critics claim that many of the "phrases and the terminology and the quaint sayings" used by McGraw on the Oprah and Dr. Phil shows were coined by Box and presented by McGraw in this seminar. McGraw admits that some of the material from Life Strategies, his first best-seller, is taken directly from the Pathways seminar. However, he has never mentioned Box or her contributions to his success in any of his books or TV shows.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2000-04-13/news/analyze-this/full|title=Analyze This|accessdate=January 13, 2008|publisher=Dallas Observer|year=2000|author=Mark Donald[/tpl]  Eight years after joining Box, McGraw signed an agreement for the sale of his Pathways seminar stock for $325,000 without notifying either his father or Box of the impending sale. Box founded her own seminars entitled "Choices."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.choicesseminars.com/About.php|title=About Thelma Box|accessdate=January 13, 2008|publisher=Choices Seminars|year=2007|author=Choices Seminars[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists===

On October 21, 1988, the Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists determined that McGraw had hired a former patient for "part-time temporary employment".[tpl]cite web|url=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3496/3743288391_cfa3a1c50b_b.jpg|title=The Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists Finding of Facts, page 2[/tpl] Specifically, the board cited "a possible failure to provide proper separation between termination of therapy and the initiation of employment,"[tpl]cite web|url=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2469/3744083552_38d45c8043_b.jpg|title=The Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists Finding of Facts, page 1[/tpl] issued a letter of reprimand and imposed administrative penalties.[tpl]cite web|url=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2454/3744080578_26c0e60fae_b.jpg|title=The Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists Conclusions of Law, page 3[/tpl] The board also investigated claims made by the patient of inappropriate contact initiated by McGraw, but the "Findings of Fact" document issued by the board on October 21, 1988, at the end of its investigation includes no reference to any physical contact of any kind. It specifically identified "the therapeutic and business relationships" as constituting McGraw's sole issue with the board. McGraw fulfilled all terms of the board's requirements, and the board closed its complaint file in June 1990.[tpl]cite web|url=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3516/3743291121_f47f5434f6_b.jpg|title=The Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists Letter, page 1[/tpl]
In 1990, McGraw joined lawyer Gary Dobbs in co-founding Courtroom Sciences, Inc. (CSI), a trial consulting firm through which McGraw later came into contact with Oprah Winfrey.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ecpa.cpa.state.tx.us/coa/servlet/cpa.app.coa.CoaGetTp?Pg=tpid&Search_Nm=Courtroom%20Sciences%20&Button=search&Search_ID=17523143273|title=Franchise Tax Certification of Account Status|accessdate=January 7, 2008|publisher=Texas Comptroller|year=2008|author=Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080213215546/http://ecpa.cpa.state.tx.us/coa/servlet/cpa.app.coa.CoaGetTp?Pg=tpid&Search_Nm=Courtroom+Sciences+&Button=search&Search_ID=17523143273  |archivedate = February 13, 2008[/tpl] Eventually, CSI became a profitable enterprise, advising Fortune 500 companies and injured plaintiffs in achieving settlements. McGraw is no longer an officer or director of the company.
After starting CSI, McGraw ceased the practice of psychology. He kept his license current and in good standing until he elected to retire it 15 years later in 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3468/3750482552_6024990f7b_b.jpg|title=Dr. Phil's License Status|author=Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists[/tpl] Appearing on the Today Show in January 2008, McGraw said that he has made it "very clear" that his current work does not involve the practice of psychology. He also said that he had "retired from psychology".Today Show interview "Dr. Phil defends intentions with Britney Spears". Retrieved February 5, 2009. According to the Today Show, the California Board of Psychology determined in 2002 that he did not require a license because his show involves "entertainment" rather than psychology. McGraw's license is currently listed by the Texas State Board of Psychology as "retired" and he holds no other active licenses to practice in any other state.Texas State Board of Psychologists website

===Oprah Winfrey and the Dr. Phil show===

In 1995, Oprah Winfrey hired McGraw's legal consulting firm CSI to prepare her for the Amarillo Texas beef trial. Winfrey was so impressed with McGraw that she thanked him for her victory in that case, which ended in 1998. Soon after, she invited him to appear on her show. His appearance proved so successful that he began appearing weekly as a relationship and life strategy expert on Tuesdays starting in April 1998.
The next year, McGraw published his first best-selling book, Life Strategies. In the next four years, McGraw published three additional best-selling relationship books, along with workbooks to complement them.
As of September 2002, McGraw formed Peteski Productions[tpl]cite web|url=http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C2468059|title=Peteski Productions, Inc.|accessdate=January 17, 2008|publisher=State of California|year=2008|author=Secretary of State[/tpl] and launched his own syndicated daily television show, Dr. Phil, produced by Winfrey's Harpo Studios. The format is an advice show, where he tackles a different topic on each show, offering advice for his guests' troubles.

===Weight loss products===

In 2003, McGraw entered the weight-loss business, selling shakes, energy bars, and supplements. These products were promoted on his show with his sisters Deana and Brenda and nephew Tony among the featured testimonials on the show.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drphil.com/shows/show/267|title= Weight Loss Challenge: Dr. Phil's Family|accessdate=January 17, 2008|publisher=Peteski Productions, Inc.|year=2004|author=Anon[/tpl]  These products' labels, which carried the brand name "Shape It Up, Woo, Woo!", stated: "These products contain scientifically researched levels of ingredients that can help you change your behavior to take control of your weight." This met with swift criticism from various sources, accusing McGraw (a clinical psychologist, and not a physician) of lacking the expertise to recommend weight-loss products. Facing a Federal Trade Commission investigation into Shape Up's claims, McGraw pulled his supplements off the market in March 2004, and the FTC dropped its probe. In October 2005, several people who used McGraw's products declared an intent to file a class-action lawsuit against him, claiming that although the supplements cost $120 per month they did not stimulate weight loss.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051007/drphil_classaction_051007/20051007/|title=Class-action status sought in Dr. Phil diet suit|accessdate=October 21, 2007|publisher=CTV Globe Media|year=2005|author=CTV.ca News Staff[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]

On April 13, 2008, a producer for the Dr. Phil show secured $30,000 bail for the ringleader of a group of eight teenage girls who viciously beat another girl and videotaped the attack.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theweekdaily.com/arts_leisure/people_gossip/39033/did_dr_phil_go_too_far.html | title=Did Dr. Phil go too far? | date=April 14, 2008 | accessdate=April 14, 2008 | publisher=The Week [/tpl]  The teen had been booked at the Polk County, Florida, jail on charges that included kidnapping and assault. Producers of the Dr. Phil show had made plans to tape a one-hour show devoted to the incident and had sent a production assistant to Orlando to help book guests for the show. However, when news broke that the Dr. Phil show producer had posted bail for the teen, the outcry caused the show to cancel their plans. "In this case certain staffers went beyond our guidelines," said Theresa Corigliano, spokesperson for the Dr. Phil show. "We have decided not to go forward with the story as our guidelines have been compromised."[tpl]cite web | url=http://newsfeedresearcher.com/data/articles_e16/ide2008.04.15.01.35.12.html#hdng0 | title=Dr. Phil Staffers Bail on Show Guidelines | date=April 15, 2008 | accessdate=April 16, 2008 | publisher=NewsFeed Researcher[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]Citation broken|date=August 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]
