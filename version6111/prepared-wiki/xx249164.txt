==Synopsis==

The Whizbanger That Emmental Built tells the story of Emmental Baker, a bright but shy girl. Emmental's mother has recently died and her father, infamous writer and recluse Niall Baker, has relocated the family to the imaginary town of Dropsham in the hopes of curing his writer's block.
Emme struggles to fit in her new surroundings, persecuted by her teacher Mrs. Hanlin and bullied by class brute Rory Blunt. With her father despondent and detached, Emme finds friendship with her neighbor, bizarre inventor Chaida Manning. As Emme's friendship with Manning grows, she learns to accept her creativity and individualism, gaining self-confidence.

==Themes==

Typical children's literary themes are expressed in Whizbanger. The main character, Emmental Baker, is vulnerable, and oppressed by society (her school teacher Mrs. Hanlon and classmate Rory Blunt). This theme is consistent throughout children's literature, from the fairytales of the Cinderella genre to J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter.

==Characters==

===Emmental Baker===

Emmental, or "Emme" is the protagonist of the story. She is shy and gentle, yet creative and bright. Suffering the death of her mother and the neglect of her author father, she finds strength in her own imagination.

===Niall Baker===

Emme's father, Niall is the author of eleven acclaimed novels and three not-so-acclaimed ones; he struggles from writer's block. His wife, Emme's mother, is recently deceased.

===Chaida Manning===

Chaida Manning is the bizarre inventor of atrocities, such as the Wooshraker and Pitchaptchapitcha. Ultimately Chaida is Emme's salvation, teaching her to trust her imagination.

===Rory Blunt===

Rory Blunt is the violent antagonist and Emme's classmate. Typical of a bully, he picks on defenseless Emme. He is also prone to bouts of violence and paranoia. Rory takes pleasure is bashing things, at times returning home to retrieve his best bashing boots.
