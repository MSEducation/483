The Satire of the Trades, also called The Instruction of Dua-Kheti, is a work of didactic ancient Egyptian literature.Katheryn A. Bard, Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, Routledge 1999, p.886 It takes the form of an Instruction, composed by a scribe from Sile named Dua-Kheti for his son Pepi. The author is thought by some to have composed the Instructions of Amenemhat as well.I. E. S. Edwards, N. G. L. Hammond, C. J. Gadd, The Cambridge Ancient History, Cambridge University Press 1975,  p.527 It describes  a number of trades in an exaggeratedly negative light, extolling the advantages of the profession of scribe. It is generally considered to be a satire, though Helck thought it reflected the true attitude of the scribal class towards manual labourers.W. Helck, Die Lehre des DwA-xtjj, Wiesbaden, 1970
It was written during the middle Kingdom, between 2025 and 1700 BC. Encyclopedia of Disability
The text has survived in its entirety, but extremely corrupted, in the Sallier II Papyrus written during the Nineteenth Dynasty, which is kept at the British Museum. A number of fragments are kept at the British Museum, the Louvre, the Pierpont Morgan Library, and other institutions.Lichtheim, op.cit., pp.184f. It was one of the texts most frequently copied by students during the Ramesside Period.
