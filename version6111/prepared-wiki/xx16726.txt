[[Muggle]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional human races, Harry Potter universe

In the Harry Potter book series, a muggle is a person who lacks any sort of magical ability and was not born into the magical world. Muggles also do not have any magical blood. It differs from the term Squib, which refers to a person with one or more magical parents yet without any magical ability, and from the term Muggle-born (or the derogatory and offensive mudblood), which refers to a person with magical abilities but without magical parents.

==Usage in Harry Potter==

The term muggle is sometimes used in a pejorative manner in the books. Since muggle refers to a person who is a member of the non-magical community, Muggles are simply ordinary human beings rather than witches and wizards. According to Rowling, a quarter of the annual Hogwarts intake have two nonmagical parents;[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] there have also been some children known to have been born to one magical and one non-magical parent. Children of this mixed parentage are called half-bloods (strictly speaking, they are 'Literal Half-bloods'); children with recent Muggle ancestry on the one side or the other are also called half-bloods. The most prominent Muggle-born in the Harry Potter series is Hermione Granger, who had two Muggles of unspecified names as parents. A witch or wizard with all magical heritage is called a pure-blood.
In the Harry Potter books, non-magical people are often portrayed as foolish, sometimes befuddled characters who are completely ignorant of the Wizarding world that exists in their midst. If, by unfortunate means, non-magical people do happen to observe the working of magic, the Ministry of Magic sends Obliviators to cast Memory Charms upon themâ€”causing them to forget the event.
Some Muggles, however, know of the wizarding world. These include Muggle parents of magical children, such as Hermione Granger's parents, the Muggle Prime Minister (and his predecessors), the Dursley family (Harry Potter's non-magical and only living relatives), and the non-magical spouses of some witches and wizards.
Rowling has said she created the word "Muggle" from "mug", an English term for someone who is easily fooled. She added the "-gle" to make it sound less demeaning and more "cuddly".http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0304-wbd.htm JK Rowling's World Book Day Chat, 4 March 2004
A 'muggle' is, according to Abbott Walter Bower, the author of the Scotichronicon, "an Englishman's tail". In Alistair Moffat's book, A History of the Borders from Early Times it is stated that there was a widely held 13th century belief amongst Scots that Englishmen had tails.Alistair Moffat, The Borders: a history of the Borders from earliest times, 2002, Deerpark Press, ISBN 9780954197902, pp.211-212
Rowling herself was sued for using the word "muggle" in the Harry Potter books.http://www.cesnur.org/recens/potter_019.htm

===Muggles in the series===

==Other usages==

The word muggle, or muggles is now used in various contexts in which its meaning is similar to the sense in which it appears in the Harry Potter book series. Generally speaking, it is used by members of a group to describe those outside the group, comparable to civilian as used by military personnel. Whereas, in the books, muggle is consistently capitalised, in other uses it is often all lower case.
