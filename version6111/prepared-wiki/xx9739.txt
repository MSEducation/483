[[Phone (phonetics)]]

CATEGORIES: Phonetics, Phonology

In phonetics and linguistics a phone is a unit of speech sound [tpl]harv|Crystal|1971|p=178[/tpl].
The word phone may refer to any speech sound or gesture considered as a physical event without regard to its place in the phonology of a language: an unanalyzed sound of a language [tpl]harv|Loos et al.|1997[/tpl].
In contrast, a phoneme is a set of phones or a set of sound features that are thought of as the same element within the phonology of a particular language [tpl]harv|Crystal|1971|p=180[/tpl].
A phone is a speech segment that possesses distinct physical or perceptual properties, and serves as the basic unit of phonetic speech analysis.
A phonetic transcription is enclosed within square brackets (), rather than the slashes (/ /) of a phonemic transcription.
