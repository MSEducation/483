==Early life==

Ilona was born in Budapest, Hungary. Her father, László Staller,"Cicciolina: I enjoyed it my first time at 14", interview in Bors, 29 June 2009 (in Hungarian) left the family when she was young. She was raised by her mother, who was a midwife, and her stepfather who was an official in the Hungarian Ministry of the Interior.
In 1964, she began working as a model for the Hungarian news agency, M.T.I. In her memoirs and in a 1999 TV interview, she claimed that she had provided the Hungarian authorities with information on American diplomats staying at a Budapest luxury hotel where she worked as a maid the 1960s.Ex-porn star La Cicciolina and the divorce from hell.

==Pornography and show business==

Naturalized by marriage and settled in Italy, Staller met pornographer Riccardo Schicchi in the early 1970s, and, beginning in 1973, achieved fame with a radio show called Voulez-vous coucher avec moi? on Radio Luna. For that program she adopted the name Cicciolina. She referred to her male fanbase, and later the male members of the Italian parliament, as "cicciolini", translating loosely as "little tubby boys".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imow.org/wpp/stories/viewStory?storyId=1205 |title=Cicciolina's Sexual Politics |publisher=International Museum of Women [/tpl] Although she appeared in several films from 1970, she made her debut under her own name in 1975 with La liceale (aka The Teasers) playing a lesbian classmate of Gloria Guida.
In 1978, on the RAI show C'era due Volte, her breasts were the first to be bared live on Italian TV. Staller appeared in her first hardcore pornographic film, Telefono rosso (Red telephone) in 1983. She produced the film together with Schicchi's company Diva Futura. Her memoirs were published as Confessioni erotiche di Cicciolina (Erotic confessions of Cicciolina) by Olympia Press of Milan in 1987. That same year she appeared in [tpl]ill|it|Carne bollente[/tpl], called The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empress in the United States, co-starring John Holmes. The film would later create a furor when it was revealed that Holmes had tested positive for HIV prior to appearing in it.[tpl]cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=940CE0DF1F3AF931A25752C0A9679C8B63|title=WADD: The Life and Times of John C.

==Political life==

In 1979, Staller was presented as a candidate to the Italian parliament by the Lista del Sole, Italy's first Green party. In 1985, she switched to the Partito Radicale, campaigning on a libertarian platform against nuclear energy and NATO membership, as well as for human rights. She was elected to the Italian parliament in 1987, with approximately 20,000 votes. While in office, and before the outset of the Gulf War, she offered to have sex with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in return for peace in the region."Pop Artist Says Marriage To Ex-porn Queen Is Over", Orlando Sentinel, 28 February 1992 She was not re-elected at the end of her term in 1991.[tpl]fact|date=October 2013[/tpl]
In 1991, Staller was among the founders of another Italian political movement, called Partito dell'Amore ("Party of Love"), which was spearheaded by friend and fellow porn star Moana Pozzi. In January 2002, she began exploring the possibility of campaigning in Hungary, her country of birth, to represent Budapest's industrial Kőbánya district in the Hungarian parliament. However, she failed to collect enough petition signatures for a non-partisan candidacy. In the same year, she ran in local elections in Monza, Italy, promising to convert a prominent building into a gambling casino, but she attracted few votes. In 2004, she announced plans to run for mayor of Milan with a similar promise. She renewed her offer to have sex with Saddam Hussein in October 2002, when Iraq was resisting international pressure to allow inspections for weapons of mass destruction, and in April 2006, she made the same offer to Osama bin Laden.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for last part of sentence|date=August 2012[/tpl]
In September 2011, it was revealed that Staller was eligible for and would be receiving a yearly pension of 39,000 euros from the Italian state as a result of her five years in the country's parliament."Protest over Italian pornstar MP Cicciolina’s pension" The Week magazine, 20 September 2011 Reacting to the controversy raised by the news, the former porn star, who started receiving the pension in November 2011, when she turned 60, stated: "I earned it and I'm proud of it.""Italy row over ex-porn star's pension rights", The Guardian, 19 September 2011
In 2012, Staller founded the Democracy, Nature and Love Party (DNA) with her partner Luca di Carlo, a criminal defense lawyer. Its objectives included: the legalization of same-sex marriage; the reopening of former brothels ("closed houses"); a guaranteed minimum wage for young people; a properly functioning judicial system for every Italian; and the elimination of the privileges of the rich political "caste".
The party is ready to stand for the upcoming elections on 24 February 2013.[tpl]update inline|date=April 2014[/tpl]"Ex actriz porno Cicciolina vuelve al ruedo de la política italiana", 12 November 2012. Retrieved on 16 March 2013. [tpl]es icon[/tpl]

==Musical career==

Staller has recorded several songs, mostly from live performances, with explicit lyrics being sung to a children's melody. Her most famous song is "[tpl]ill|it|Muscolo rosso[/tpl]", a song entirely dedicated to il cazzo, which means "the dick" in Italian. Because of its extensive use of swear words, the song could not be released in Italy, but became a hit in other countries, especially in France, where the listeners did not grasp the meaning of the lyrics. The song gained considerable popularity in the internet era, when many Italian speakers were able to hear it for the first time.
Several unreleased songs were recorded during her RCA period and the Diva Futura agency period. Some of these unreleased songs were subsequently used during her TV shows, live performances or as soundtracks in her porn movies.

Staller married American artist Jeff Koons in 1991. Koons produced a series of sculptures and photographs of them having sex in many positions, settings and costumes, which were exhibited under the title "Made In Heaven."[tpl]cite news |url=http://u.tv/News/Not-just-the-king-of-kitsch/57aca175-4791-43dc-a925-104cdd01fd7b |title=Not just the king of kitsch |date=30 June 2009 |first=Jonathan |last=Jones [/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] The marriage broke up in 1992, and their son Ludwig Maximillian was born shortly afterwards.
