Larry Wall ([tpl]IPAc-en|w|ɔː|l[/tpl]; born September 27, 1954) is a computer programmer and author, most widely known as the creator of the Perl programming language.

==Education==

Wall grew up in south Los Angeles and then Bremerton, Washington, before starting higher education at Seattle Pacific University in 1976, majoring in chemistry and music and later Pre-med with a hiatus of several years working in the university's computing center before being graduated with a self-styled bachelor's degree in Natural and Artificial Languages.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3394 |author=Marjorie Richardson |title= Larry Wall, the Guru of Perl |publisher= Linux Journal |date= May 1, 1999 |accessdate= January 12, 2012[/tpl]
While in graduate school at University of California, Berkeley, Wall and his wife were studying linguistics with the intention afterwards of finding an unwritten language, perhaps in Africa, and creating a writing system for it. They would then use this new writing system to translate various texts into the language, among them the Bible. Due to health reasons these plans were cancelled, and they remained in the United States, where Larry instead joined the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory after he finished graduate school.

==Accomplishments==

Wall is the author of the rn Usenet client and the nearly universally used patch program. He has won the International Obfuscated C Code Contest twice and was the recipient of the first Free Software Foundation Award for the Advancement of Free Software in 1998.
Beyond his technical skills, Wall has a reputation for his wit and for his often sarcastic sense of humour,[tpl]Citation| first=Larry | last=Wall| title =Perl, the first postmodern computer language| quote=The following is the text of Larry Wall's talk at Linux World on Wednesday, March 3. He explains why Perl is a fitting language for the postmodern era. As a member of the audience commented: "Another mindbender from Larry." | publisher= O’Reilly Media | place= San Jose Convention Center, San Jose, CA, USA | date = March 3, 1999 | url=http://www.perl.com/pub/a/1999/03/pm.html | accessdate=November 19, 2007[/tpl] which he displays in the comments to his source code or on Usenet. For example: "We all agree on the necessity of compromise. We just can't agree on when it's necessary to compromise" and:
Wall developed the Perl interpreter and language while working for System Development Corporation, which later became part of Unisys.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/148 |title=Larry Wall |publisher= O’Reilly net |accessdate= January 12, 2012[/tpl] He is the co-author of Programming Perl (often referred to as the Camel Book and published by O'Reilly), which is the definitive resource for Perl programmers; and edited the Perl Cookbook. He then became employed full-time by O'Reilly Media to further develop Perl and write books on the subject.
Wall's training as a linguist is apparent in his books, interviews, and lectures. He often compares Perl to a natural language and explains his decisions in Perl's design with linguistic rationale. He also often uses linguistic terms for Perl language constructs, so instead of traditional terms such as "variable", "function", and "accessor" he sometimes says "noun", "verb", and "topicalizer".
Wall's Christian faith has influenced some of the terminology of Perl, such as the name itself, a biblical reference to the "pearl of great price" (Matthew 13:46).[tpl]Citation|last=Silberman|first=Steve|title= Scripting on the Lido Deck| journal = Wired (magazine)|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.10/cruise.html?pg=3|year= 2000|volume= 8.10[/tpl] Similar references are the function name bless, and the organization of Perl 6 design documents with categories such as apocalypse and exegesis. Wall has also alluded to his faith when he has spoken at conferences, including a rather straightforward statement of his beliefs at the August 1997 Perl Conference and a discussion of Pilgrim's Progress at the YAPC (Yet Another Perl Conference) in June 2000.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
Wall continues to oversee further development of Perl and serves as the Benevolent Dictator for Life of the Perl project. His role in Perl is best conveyed by the so-called 2 Rules, taken from the official Perl documentation:
