==Description==

Carlton Draught is a pale lager which is sold on tap in its home state of Victoria as well as in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia, and is one of Australia's most popular selling tap beers.http://www.cheapdrinks.com.au/pag_Carlton-Draught-Beer.pub CheapDrinks.com.au - Carlton Draught Review  It is also sold pre-packaged, Carlton Draught comes in 375ml "stubbie" and 750ml "longneck" bottles and 375ml cans.
The formulation of Carlton Draught was changed slightly in 2003 to reduce the alcohol content from 5.0% to 4.6% in response to an increase in alcohol taxes by the Federal government. The logo was also changed, and a new advertising campaign was introduced to target a wider market. Featuring quirky, comical advertisements and billboards; the beer was promoted as simply being "made from beer". Carlton Draught, like most Australian Lagers, is made using a wortstream brewing process, and uses a portion of cane sugar to thin out the body of the beer, apparently due to drinkers preferences.

==Advertising==

The Carlton Draught: Big Ad used viral marketing techniques before being released on television. 
A second comical viral campaign was initiated in September 2006 entitled Flash Beer.  It is focused on a character named Kevin Kavendish (played by Aaron Bertram) applying for a job as a brewer in Carlton Draught. At first, he is rejected then copies a dance sequence in the movie Flashdance to the song Flashdance... What a Feeling and is accepted.
