The Portland Institute for Contemporary Art (PICA) is a contemporary performance and visual arts organization in Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. It sponsors the annual Time-Based Art Festival (TBA Festival) each September.

==History==

PICA was founded in 1996 by Kristy Edmunds, formerly the Director of the Portland Art Museum's "Art on the Edge" program.  Edmunds left PICA in 2005 to become art director for the Melbourne International Arts Festival. The gallery was housed at Boora Architects from its founding until about 2001, and then moved to the headquarters of Wieden + Kennedy in Northwest Portland.[tpl]cite news|last=Row|first=D.K.|title=Portland Institute for Contemporary Art's risky move to stay nimble and on the edge|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/art/index.ssf/2012/04/portland_institute_for_contemp_3.html|accessdate=9 April 2012|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=April 7, 2012[/tpl] PICA remained at Wieden + Kennedy, where they received discounted rent, until 2012 when they moved to Downtown Portland on Tenth Avenue.
