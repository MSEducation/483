"Hello, I Love You" is a song by the classic rock band The Doors from their 1968 album Waiting for the Sun. It was released as a single that same year, reaching number one in the United States and selling over a million copies in the U.S. alone. In Canada, it hit number one as well."Top Singles - Volume 9, No. 23_24, August 19 1968". Collections Canada. Retrieved January 17, 2012. The single also became the band's first big UK hit, peaking at number fifteen on the chart.
This was one of the six songs performed by The Doors on the demo for Aura Records in 1965.
Sometimes the title is listed as "Hello, I Love You (Won't You Tell Me Your Name?)" or "Hello, I Love You, Won't You Tell Me Your Name?" The title that is printed depends on how early of a pressing the record is.

==Allegations of plagiarism==

In the liner notes to The Doors Box set, Robby Krieger has denied the allegations that the song's musical structure was stolen from Ray Davies, where a riff similar to it is featured in the Kinks "All Day and All of the Night".  Instead, he said the song's vibe was taken from Cream's song "Sunshine of Your Love".  According to the Doors biography No One Here Gets Out Alive, courts in the UK determined in favor of Davies and any royalties for the song are paid to him.

==Real life influences==

The last verse was written by Jim Morrison three years prior to the album recordings, reportedly about an African-American girl whom he dreamed about while living on Venice Beach.  
 "Sidewalk crouches at her feet

Like a dog that begs for something sweet.

Do you hope to make her see you, fool?

Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?"

==Cover versions==

The song has been covered by Oleander, Buddy Rich, Missing Persons, The Cure (on the compilation Rubáiyát, 1990), Eurythmics,  Simple Minds, Anal Cunt, Neil Young, Adam Ant, Adam Freeland, Siouxsie Sioux, Kiyoharu, Missing Persons, the Lithuanian postmodernist rock band Antis, and the Persian alternative singer Mohsen Namjoo.
It is also referenced in The Dresden Dolls' song "The Perfect Fit" and Pulp's "Dogs Are Everywhere". Hip Hop artist Necro mixed and released this tune as "You Ho".
Cory Monteith performs a cover of the song in an episode of the hit American TV series Glee.

==Chart performance (U.S.)==

The song not only spent two weeks at #1 (see below), but was also in the Top 5 at the same time as Jose Feliciano's version of "Light My Fire". This put two of The Doors' tunes simultaneously in the Top 5.
