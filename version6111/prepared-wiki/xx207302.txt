Zoopla (also Zoopla.co.uk) is a property website covering the British residential property market.
The site also enables users to access information such as sold house prices, area trends and statistics, and current value estimates for domestic properties in the UK.

==Product features==

The Zoopla site is a searchable directory of UK residential properties, created using Royal Mail's database, the UK HM Land Registry's data on property transactions, Google maps, Microsoft maps' "bird's eye view", and other data sources.  The data is then presented in a read-write format, so that user-generated content can "fill in the gaps".Previous name of the company was ZOOPLA LTD, http://www.companieslist.co.uk/06074771-zoopla-property-group-limited
Based on this data, Zoopla has developed an automated valuation model or algorithm that allows the site to provide an instant valuation estimate for any property in the UK, similar to competitors Mouseprice and Hometrack. The AVM is based on user-added information such as property attributes, transactions from the Land Registry, and analysis of historical price trends. The site also allows users to claim their home or set a TemptMe price (a price at which they could be tempted to sell).
The site also provides listings of around 500,000[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] properties for sale or to rent from residential estate agents along with pictures, descriptions, maps, statistics and local information.
In July 2010, Zoopla also made a similar new service as an iPhone application including GPS-based property searches and augmented reality camera view.
