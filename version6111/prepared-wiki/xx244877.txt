CATEGORIES: Members of Queensland parliaments by term

This is a list of members of the 19th Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1912 to 1915, as elected at the 1912 state election held on 27 April 1912.[tpl]cite web|title=Queensland General Election Dates 1860-1929|url=http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/documents/explore/parliamentaryrecord/sections/Part%202.24.pdf|publisher=Queensland Parliament|accessdate=16 December 2013[/tpl]
Apart from the 1904–1907 term, when Labor had held two seats short of a majority, the parliament had been dominated by non-Labor forces since the separation of Queensland from New South Wales in 1860 — this was the last such parliament until 1957, apart from the 1929–1932 term led by the Moore Ministry.
