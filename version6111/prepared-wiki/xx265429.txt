==History==

FM 122 was originally designated in 1945, as a much longer northâ€“south route that replaced SH 207 from Ralls southward to Caprock. The designation was extended further south, to Post, in 1949. In 1958, a spur was designated in Ralls. This spur is currently what remains of FM 122; the portion from Ralls to Post was redesignated as part of SH 207 as a part of that route's lengthening in 1967.[tpl]TxDOT|SH|207|accessdate=2011-01-03[/tpl]
