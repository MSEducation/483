The park is part of the 366 km2 Gibraltar Range Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because it is a block of highland forest that supports one of only five remaining populations of the vulnerable Rufous Scrub-bird, as well as significant populations of Green Catbirds, Australian Logrunners, Paradise Riflebirds and Pale-yellow Robins.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Gibraltar Range |accessdate=2011-06-24 |work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= [/tpl]
