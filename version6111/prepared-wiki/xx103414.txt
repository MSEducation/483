==History==

On November 24, 2000, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced the licensees of the new, much-sought after, category 1 digital services. Craig Media, in partnership with TD Capital Group Ltd, was granted a licence for a youth lifestyle service known as Connect.CRTC Decision 2000-462 One of the licence's conditions was that the channel could not devote more than 10 per cent of its schedule to the airing of music videos and music programming, in order to avoid direct competition with, at the time, CHUM Limited's MuchMusic.
Nonetheless, in August 2001, Craig Media announced that it had reached an agreement with MTV Networks to license programming and the MTV brand in Canada for the channel,TV Land, MTV and Craig Broadcast Systems to Launch New Canadian Services in September; PR Newswire; 2001-08-21 prompting a pre-launch name change to MTV Canada. Prior to the channel's launch, Craig purchased TD Capital Group's interest in the channel and it was launched on October 18, 2001.Channel Introduction: MTV Canada Channel Canada 2002-06-30 Shortly after, Craig sold a minority interest in the service to MTV Networks. MTV Canada aired a mix of Canadian made programs, including Pepsi Breakout and MTV Select, as well as American MTV shows such as TRL and The Real World.
CHUM soon filed complaints with the CRTC, arguing that MTV Canada was violating its conditions of licence, exceeding its limit of 10 per cent music videos, becoming a direct competitor to MuchMusic.Chum complaint "an exercise in turf protection" Mediacaster Magazine 2002-02-01 Craig was later forced to make changes to reduce its percentage of music video and music-related programming.
However, these changes were soon rendered moot as Craig was acquired by CHUM Limited on December 1, 2004,CHUM completes $265 million purchase of Craig Media and financing Fasken Martineau prompting MTV Networks to exercise its right, due to a clause in its contract, to terminate the licensing agreement with Craig if a change in control were to happen.[tpl]cite web| title=CHUM to launch interactive, automated music video station|publisher=The Globe and Mail|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/article889243.ece|date=2007-06-29[/tpl] CHUM was required to pay $10 million CAD in licensing fees to MTV Networks for the time remaining in their contract. The contract termination also meant that MTV Networks was no longer able to retain interest the channels (except for TV Land Canada, indicating that Viacom's sale of their stake since the purchase could also be because of the company's strained relationships with CHUM Limited concerning the MTV-branded music channels because CHUM (with Cablevision's Rainbow Media) launched MuchUSA to compete against MTV).

On June 9, 2005 CHUM announced it would rebrand the channel as Razer, a change that took effect on June 30 of that year.
