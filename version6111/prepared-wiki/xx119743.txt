It is near the larger villages of Acton Burnell, about three miles to the north-west, and Harley, about two miles to the east.
The name is probably formed from the Old English personal name Cenna with -ley, meaning a clearing in a wood.Raven, M. A Guide to Shropshire, 2005, p.102
To the west are the hamlets of Ruckley and Langley, which form a separate civil parish.
The historian Archibald Alison and statistician William Farr were born in Kenley.
