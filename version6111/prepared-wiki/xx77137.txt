Life's Too Good, released in April 1988, was the first album by the Icelandic alternative rock-pop band The Sugarcubes, which brought fame to lead vocalist Björk. Through the first single, "Birthday", the Sugarcubes received attention in Europe and the United States.

"Ammæli", afterwards released in English as "Birthday", entered the charts outside Iceland, leading the band to put Icelandic music on the world map. "Birthday" was chosen as "single of the week" by both NME and Melody Maker in August 1987 and was also selected Number 1 in John Peel's Festive Fifty for 1987. The album has been chosen as one of the 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.
