He was then elected to the State Duma, thereby obtaining parliamentary immunity. Mavrodi declared MMM bankrupt on December 22, 1997, then disappeared, and was on the run until his arrest in 2003.
In 1998 Mavrodi created Stock Generation,MMM Corporation by Peter Symes"Money For Nothing", by  Dan Brekke,Wired Magazine, Issue 8.09, Sep 2000 allegedly a classic pyramid scheme presented as a "virtual stock market game". The website ran from 1998 to early 2000. The Massachusetts district court initially found that U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was unable to cite Stock Generation's founders and owners  for securities violations. However the United States Court of Appeals reversed this decision in 2001 concluding that SEC alleged sufficient facts to state a triable claim.Appeal of SEC vs. Stock Generation, United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit In 2003 the SEC obtained permanent injunctions against SG Ltd. and relief defendants SG Perfect and SG Trading, which profited from the disbursement of funds fraudulently gained by SG Ltd.SG Ltd.

In January 2011, Mavrodi launched another pyramid scheme called MMM-2011, asking investors to buy so-called Mavro currency units. He frankly described it as a pyramid, adding "It is a naked scheme, nothing more ... People interact with each other and give each other money. For no reason!"

MMM-2011 was able to function openly as ponzi schemes and financial pyramids are not illegal under Russian law.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/NC20Ag01.html|title=Mavrodi's Ponzi comeback  seeks financial apocalypse|last=Bigg|first=Claire|date=March 20, 2012|work=Asia Times|accessdate=7 September 2012[/tpl] In May 2012 he froze the operation and announced there would be no more payouts.[tpl]cite news|url=http://rt.com/news/mmm-mavrodi-ponzi-scheme-715/|title=Fool me twice, shame on me: Russians fall once again for notorious Ponzi scheme|date=June 2, 2012|work=RT|accessdate=7 September 2012[/tpl]
