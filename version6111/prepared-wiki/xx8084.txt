==Career==

===Television===

====Early appearances====

At the age of 17, Moore aspired to be a dancer. She started her career as "Happy Hotpoint", a tiny elf dancing on Hotpoint appliances in TV commercials during the 1950s series Ozzie and Harriet. She appeared in 39 TV commercials in five days, ultimately earning about $6,000 from her first job.[tpl]cite book|title=The TV Guide TV Book: 40 Years of the All-Time Greatest Television Facts, Fads, Hits, and History|last=Weiner|first=Ed|coauthors=Editors of TV Guide|year=1992|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-096914-8|page=100[/tpl] Her time as "Happy Hotpoint" ended when it became difficult to conceal her pregnancy in the dancing elf costume.After All (1995 autobiography of Mary Tyler Moore). Putnam, ISBN 0-399-14091-3, pp. 61–65 Moore modeled anonymously on the covers of a number of record albums and auditioned for the role of the older daughter of Danny Thomas for his long-running TV show, but was turned down. Much later, Thomas explained that "no daughter of mine could have that little nose." 
Moore's first regular television role was as a mysterious and glamorous telephone receptionist on Richard Diamond, Private Detective. To add to the mystique, her voice is heard, but only her shapely legs appear on camera.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/tyler-moore-dick-36447.aspx|title=Mary Tyler Moore's Big Break |publisher=Tvguide.com|date=2004-05-06 |accessdate=2010-08-14[/tpl] About this time, she guest-starred on John Cassavetes's NBC detective series Johnny Staccato.  In 1960, she guest starred in two episodes, "The O'Mara Ladies" and "All The O'Mara Horses", of the William Bendix-Doug McClure NBC western series, Overland Trail. Several months later, she appeared in the first episode, entitled "One Blonde Too Many", of NBC's one-season The Tab Hunter Show, a sitcom starring the former teen idol as a bachelor cartoonist. In 1961, Moore appeared in several big parts in movies and on television, including Bourbon Street Beat, 77 Sunset Strip, Surfside Six, Wanted: Dead or Alive, Steve Canyon, Hawaiian Eye, Thriller and Lock-Up.

====The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961-1966)====

In 1961, Carl Reiner cast Moore in The Dick Van Dyke Show, an acclaimed weekly series based on Reiner's own life and career as a writer for Sid Caesar's television variety show, telling the cast from the outset that it would run no more than five years. The show was produced by Danny Thomas's company, and Thomas himself recommended her. He remembered Mary as "the girl with three names" whom he had turned down earlier.Profile the Paley Center for Media. Retrieved April 3, 2009. Moore's energetic comic performances as Van Dyke's character's wife, begun at age 24 (eleven years Van Dyke's junior), made both the actress and her signature tight capri pants extremely popular, and she became internationally famous. When she won an EmmyAfter All, p. 114 award for her portrayal of Laura Petrie, she said, "I know this will never happen again." Mary Tyler Moore later stated that she was actually 23 years old when she first starred on the Dick Van Dyke Show,During an appearance on the on The Rachael Ray Show.[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] but had told producers that she was 25 because she heard that Dick Van Dyke had said she might be too young for the part.

====The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970-1977)====

In 1970, after having appeared earlier in a pivotal one-hour musical special called "Dick Van Dyke and the Other Woman", Moore and husband Grant Tinker successfully pitched a sitcom centered on Moore to CBS. The Mary Tyler Moore Show was a half-hour newsroom sitcom featuring Ed Asner as her gruff boss Lou Grant, a character that would later be spun off into an hour-long dramatic series. Moore's show proved so popular that two other regular characters, Valerie Harper as Rhoda Morgenstern and Cloris Leachman as Phyllis Lindstrom, were also spun off into their own successful series.  The premise of the single working woman's life, alternating during the program between work and home, became a television staple.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9413674|title=Mary Tyler Moore Biography|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=2010-08-14[/tpl] After six years of ratings in the top 20,"The Mary Tyler Moore Show" museum.tv. Retrieved April 3, 2009. the show slipped to number #39 during its seventh season. Producers argued for its cancellation because of its falling ratings, afraid that the show's legacy might be damaged if it were renewed for another season. To the surprise of the entire cast including Mary Tyler Moore herself, it was announced that they would soon be filming their final episode. After the announcement, the series finished strongly and the final show was the most watched show during the week it aired. The 1977 season would go on to win an Emmy AwardMary Tyler Moore Emmy Winner for Outstanding Comedy Series, to add to the awards it had won in 1975 and 1976. The series had become a touchpoint of the Women's Movement because it was one of the first to show, in a serious way, an independent working woman.

====Later projects====

After a brief respite, Moore threw herself into a completely different genre. She attempted two unsuccessful series in a row: Mary, which featured David Letterman, Michael Keaton, Swoosie Kurtz and Dick Shawn in the supporting cast and lasted three episodes, which was re-tooled as The Mary Tyler Moore Hour, a backstage show within a show, with Mary portraying a TV star putting on a variety show. To arouse curiosity and nostalgic feelings, Dick Van Dyke appeared as her guest, but the program was canceled within three months. About this time, she also made a one-off musical/variety special for CBS, titled Mary's Incredible Dream,After All, pp. 190–192 which featured John Ritter, among others. It did poorly in the ratings and, according to Moore, was never repeated and will likely never be aired again because of legal problems surrounding the show. [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
In the 1985–86 season, she returned to CBS in a series titled Mary, which suffered from poor reviews, sagging ratings, and internal strife within the production crew. According to Moore, she asked CBS to pull the show, as she was unhappy with the direction of the program and the producers.After All, pp. 266–267 She also starred in the short-lived Annie McGuire in 1988.After All, pp. 271–272 In the mid-1990s, she had a cameo and a guest starring role as herself on two episodes of Ellen. She subsequently also guest starred on Ellen DeGeneres's next TV show, The Ellen Show, in 2001. In 2004, Moore reunited with her Dick Van Dyke Show castmates for a reunion "episode" called The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited.[tpl]cite web|author=Reviewed by Ken Tucker|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,634109,00.html|title=Review:The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited|publisher=Ew.com|date=2004-05-14|accessdate=2010-08-14[/tpl] 
In August 2005, Moore guest-starred as Christine St. George, a high-strung host of a fictional TV show on three episodes of Fox sitcom That '70s Show. Moore's scenes were shot on the same soundstage where The Mary Tyler Moore Show was filmed in the 1970s. Moore made a guest appearance on the season 2 premiere of Hot in Cleveland, which stars her old co-star Betty White.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Mary-Tyler-Moore-1024989.aspx|title=Mary Tyler Moore to Guest-Star on Hot in Cleveland Season Premiere|publisher=TVGuide.com|accessdate=November 2, 2010[/tpl] This marked the first time that White and Moore had worked together since The Mary Tyler Moore Show ended in 1977."Mary Tyler Moore to guest star on 'Hot in Cleveland'", November 1, 2010 Moore will reprise her role on Hot in Cleveland in an upcoming season four episode which will not only reunite Moore and White, but former MTM cast members Cloris Leachman, Valerie Harper and Georgia Engel.
