The Carson City Civic Auditorium, at 813 N. Carson St. in Carson City, Nevada, was designed by architect Lehman A. Ferris and was built during 1938-39.  It was funded by a municipal bond and by the Public Works Administration.  Also known simply as Municipal Auditorium, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
It was deemed significant as a depression era works project and also "as a rare example of a monumentally-scaled Romanesque Revival-styled building in Nevada".[tpl]cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/90000912.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Carson City Civic Auditorium / Municipal Auditorium |author=Richard A.
