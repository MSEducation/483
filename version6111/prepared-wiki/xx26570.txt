The Tasman Sea (Māori: Te Tai-o-Rehua.Rāwiri Taonui. Tapa whenua – naming places – Events, maps and European influences, Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, Ministry for Culture and Heritage. ISBN 978-0-478-18451-8. Updated 1 March 2009. Retrieved 24 February 2011) is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures approximately [tpl]convert|2000|km|mi[/tpl] across, and extends 2,800 km (approx.) from north to south.  The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/583911/Tasman-Sea|title=Tasman Sea|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=19 September 2013[/tpl]
The Tasman Sea is informally referred to in both Australian and New Zealand English as The Ditch; for example, crossing the ditch means travelling to Australia from New Zealand, or vice versa. The diminutive term "The Ditch" used for the Tasman Sea is comparable to referring to the North Atlantic Ocean as "The Pond".

==Geography==

===Extent===

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Tasman Sea as follows:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010[/tpl]

===Ridge===

The Tasman Sea's mid-ocean ridge developed between 85 and 55 million years ago as Australia and Zealandia broke apart during the breakup of supercontinent Gondwana. It lies roughly midway between the continental margins of Australia and Zealandia. Much of Zealandia is submerged, so the ridge runs much closer to the Australian coast than New Zealand's.

===Islands===

The Tasman Sea features a number of mid-sea island groups, quite apart from coastal islands located near the Australian and New Zealand mainlands:

==History==

Moncrieff and Hood were the first to attempt to a Trans-Tasman crossing by plane in 1928. The first successful flight over the sea was accomplished by Charles Kingsford Smith later that year. The first person to row solo across the sea was Colin Quincey in 1977. The next successful solo crossing was completed by his son, Shaun Quincey in 2010.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article7061393.ece |title=Kiwi becomes second person to row across the Tasman Sea |author=Anne Barrowclough |accessdate=22 May 2011 |date=14 March 2010 |newspaper=Times Online |publisher=Times Newspapers [/tpl]
