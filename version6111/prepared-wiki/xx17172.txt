He has also worked with the weekly magazines L'espresso and Panorama, and with the satirical  Cuore and Tango, the monthly magazines Il Mago (where he began and published in installments part of Bar Sport) and Linus, and the newspapers La Repubblica and il manifesto.
He also wrote television sketches for Beppe Grillo at the beginning of Grillo's career, and one of these sketches – called "Pietro Longo=P2" – caused the Psdi to ask the RAI commission to remove Grillo from RAI TV; their request was denied.

His novels contain, within imaginary worlds and situations, a strong satire of Italian society over the last few decades.  His writing style includes many puns, neologisms and parodies of other literary styles.  
In 2009 he acted in the film Sleepless, directed by Maddalena De Panfilis.
In January and February 2010, he presented the event Bennac, a meeting between himself and the French writer Daniel Pennac.
