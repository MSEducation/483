[[Ethyl group]]

CATEGORIES: Alkyl groups

In chemistry, an ethyl group is an alkyl substituent derived from ethane (C2H6).  It has the formula –C2H5 and is very often abbreviated Et.  Ethyl is used in the IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry for a saturated two-carbon moiety in a molecule, whilst the prefix "eth-" is used to indicate the presence of two carbon atoms in the molecule. 

==Ethylation==

Ethylation is the formation of a compound by introduction of the ethyl group.  The most widely practiced example of this reaction is the ethylation of benzene.  The ethylating agent is ethylene.
