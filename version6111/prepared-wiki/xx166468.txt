Dusit Zoo ([tpl]lang-th|สวนสัตว์ดุสิต[/tpl]) at Khao Din Park is a city zoo in Bangkok, Thailand. Located at Khao Din Park in Bangkok's Dusit District next to the Parliament House and Dusit Palace, it is the oldest zoo of Thailand, built by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) as his private garden adjacent to the royal palace. After the king's death, the garden was left unattended for years. 
In 1938, the revolutionary government asked King Rama VIII's regency to give this park to Bangkok City Municipality to be open as a public zoo. The King donated deer and a number of other animals from the palace for public exhibition. The City of Bangkok operated the zoo until 1954. Since then it has been transferred to the state Zoological Park Organization, which also operates Khao Khiao Open Zoo, Chiang Mai Zoo, Songkhla Zoo and Nakhon Ratchasima Zoo.ZPO Dusit Zoo or "Khao Din", spans a total area of 188, 800 square meters,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bangkok.com/attraction/dusit-zoo.htm[/tpl] and is regarded as the most popular zoo in Thailand, attracting approximately 2.5 million visitors annually.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zoothailand.org/index.php/en/the-zoological-park-organization/zoo/dusit-zoo[/tpl]
