Norman Clyde still guided parties into the Sierra into the 1960s, when he was in his seventies.  In the 1950s and 1960s, he lived by himself at the old Baker ranch-house on Baker Creek near Big Pine. Because he was trained in the classics, Norman Clyde loved to read books in Latin and Greek.  At the Baker ranch-house, Clyde had thousands of rare classical books.  At age 80, he was still sleeping outside the ranch-house on a mattress and sleeping bag, as long as it was fair weather.  In the spring of 1968, he transferred to a skilled nursing facility in Bishop where he could receive adequate care.  In 1969, his cancerous left eye was removed.  He died in Bishop on December 23, 1972 at age 87, surrounded by the high peaks of the Sierra Nevada that he loved so much.  The cause of death was "metastatic melanoma - primary in eye."

Norman Clyde received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from his alma mater, Geneva College, in 1939.  He received the college's Distinguished Service Award in 1962.
In 1947, the Sierra Club Handbook praised Clyde's mountaineering accomplishments: "Outstanding among members who have helped others gain mountain experience is Norman Clyde, whose amazing achievements in scaling practically all the peaks in the High Sierra are well known to mountaineers.  More than one climber has exulted in a supposedly first ascent, only to find later that Clyde went up that 'unclimbed peak' in the winter of, say, 1920!  There are many seasoned climbers who can look back on their early days as novices in the mountains and remember with gratitude what they learned from Clyde".[tpl]cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Harriet|coauthors=David A.

Jointly with Allen Steck, he was the first recipient of the Sierra Club's Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award in 1970.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/awards/downloads/award_sr.pdf|work=Sierra Club Awards|title=List by Award|accessdate=2011-06-02[/tpl]
Clyde Minaret, Clyde's Ledge, Clyde's Meadow along the Mountaineer's Route on Mt. Whitney, and Norman Clyde Peak bear his name. His ashes were scattered from Norman Clyde Peak by Smoke Blanchard, his son Bob Blanchard and a party that included Jules Eichorn.
The Eastern California Museum in Independence has an extensive collection of memorabilia, documents and photos pertaining to Clyde's life on display. Wall Street Journal extreme sports correspondent Michael J. Ybarra described this exhibit as "absorbing".[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203863204574345003001544422.html|title=A Solitary, Singular Life|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|first=Michael J.|last=Ybarra|date=September 10, 2009|accessdate=September 16, 2009[/tpl]
