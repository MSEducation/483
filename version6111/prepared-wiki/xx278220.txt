Andrew Dodge's screenplay for Bad Words first caught attention after making The Black List in 2011.[tpl]cite web|last=Finke|first=Nikki|title=The Black List 2011: Screenplay Roster|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/12/the-black-list-2011-screenplay-roster/|work=Deadline.com|publisher=PMC (company)[tpl]![/tpl]Penske Media Corporation|accessdate=November 4, 2013|date=December 12, 2011[/tpl] Around this time, Jason Bateman's agent sent him screenplays for possible directorial work. "I said to my lit agent, 'Please don’t wait for me to have an opening in my acting schedule to pursue the directing stuff. Understand that I'm only acting to create the kind of relevance or capital necessary to get a directing job,'" explained Bateman. "It's really the only reason I've been acting for the last 20 years of this career."[tpl]cite web|last=Siegel|first=Tatiana|title=Toronto: Jason Bateman on His Directorial Debut, 'Bad Words,' and Why He Cast Himself (Q&A)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/toronto-bad-words-jason-bateman-622520|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|accessdate=November 4, 2013|date=September 5, 2013[/tpl]
