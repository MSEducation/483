[[Electric boat]]

CATEGORIES: Electric boats, Marine propulsion, Russian inventions

While a significant majority of water vessels are powered by diesel engines, with sail power and gasoline engines also remaining popular, boats powered by electricity have been used for over 120 years.  Electric boats were very popular from the 1880s until the 1920s, when the internal combustion engine took dominance. Since the energy crises of the 1970s, interest in this quiet and potentially renewable marine energy source has been increasing steadily again, especially as solar cells became available, for the first time making possible motorboats with an infinite range like sailboats. The first practical solar boat was probably constructed in 1975 in England.Electrical Review Vol 201 No 7 12 August 1977

==History==

The first electric boat was developed by Moritz von Jacobi in 1839 in St Petersburg, Russia - a [tpl]convert|24|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] boat which carried 14 passengers at 3 mph. It was successfully demonstrated to Emperor Nicholas I of Russia on the Neva River.
It took more than 30 years of battery and motor development before they began to be deployed in any numbers. In 1886 an electric boat engineered (and driven) by Anthony Reckenzaun crossed the English Channel both ways in 8 hours. By 1889 Magnus Volk had helped establish Immisch & Co's first hire fleet, with 6 electric launches ready for charter service on the River Thames. In the 1893 Chicago World Fair 55 launches developed from Anthony Reckenzaun's work carried more than a million passengers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sunboat.com/history/history.html|title=The story of solar powered boats|accessdate=31 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=History of our Classic Motor Yachts|url=http://www.elcomotoryachts.com/history.shtml|publisher=Elco|accessdate=21 February 2011[/tpl]
Electric boats had an early period of popularity between around 1890 and 1920, before the emergence of the internal combustion engine drove them out of most applications. For example, an 1893 pleasure map of the Thames shows 8 "charging stations for electric launches" between Kew (Strand-on-the-Green) and Reading (Caversham).[tpl]cite book|title=The Oarsman's and Angler's Map of the River Thames from its source to London Bridge|publisher=James Reynolds & Son, London|year=1893|edition=1991. Old House Books, Devon[/tpl]
Most of the electric boats of this era were small passenger boats on non-tidal waters at a time when the only power alternative was steam. One of the largest in Britain, and the only surviving example, is the Mary Gordon[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marygordon.org.uk/marygordon.htm|title=Mary Gordon Electric River Boat|accessdate=31 May 2010[/tpl] which was built on the Thames for Leeds City Council for use on the Roundhay Park Lake. It was [tpl]convert|52|ft[/tpl] long and could take 75 passengers, and is now being restored.
In a few situations, the use of electric boats has persisted from the early 20th century to the present day. One of these is on the Königssee lake, near Berchtesgaden in south-eastern Germany. Here the lake is considered so environmentally sensitive that steam and motor boats have been prohibited since 1909. Instead the Bayerische Seenschifffahrt company and its predecessors have operated a fleet of electric launches to provide a public passenger service on the lake.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.behoerdenwegweiser.bayern.de/dokumente/aufgabenbeschreibung/76666130115 | title = Bayerische Seenschifffahrt GmbH | language = German | trans_title = Bavarian Lakes Maritime Ltd. | publisher = Bavarian State Ministry of the Interior | accessdate = 11 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.seenschifffahrt.de/de/unternehmen/geschichte.asp | title = Geschichtliche Hintergründe | language = German | trans_title = Historical Background | publisher = Bayerische Seenschifffahrt | accessdate = 11 July 2011[/tpl]
In the US, the Electric Boat Company was founded in 1899 and built the first submarine purchased by the U.S. Navy in 1900.[tpl]Citation|journal=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=General Dynamics Corporation|year=1993|edition=15th[/tpl]  Since then, electric power has been used almost exclusively for powering submarines underwater, although diesel was used for powering them on the surface until the development of diesel-electric transmission by the US Navy in 1928. The Electric Boat Company eventually became General Dynamics Corporation in 1952.
The use of combined fuel and electric propulsion has gradually been extended over the years to the extent that some modern liners such as the Queen Mary 2 use only electric motors, powered by diesel and gas turbine engines. The advantages include being able to run the fuel engines at an optimal speed at all times and being able to mount the electric motor in a pod which may be rotated by 360° for increased manoeuvrability.
The use of electricity alone to power boats stagnated apart from their outboard use as trolling motors until the Duffy Electric Boat Company of California started mass-producing small electric craft in 1968. Duffy Boats has produced over 10,000 electric powered boats to date and is producing well over 300 per year today. It wasn't until the 1980s that the Electric Boat Association was formed and solar powered boats started to emerge.

==Components==

The main components of the drive system of any electrically powered boat are similar in all cases, and similar to the options available for any electric vehicle.

===Charger===

Electric energy has to be obtained for the battery bank from some source.
In all cases, a charge regulator is needed. This ensures that the batteries are charged at the maximum rate that they safely can stand when the power is available. It also ensures that they are not overcharged when nearing full charge and not overheated when a large charge current becomes available.

===Battery bank===

There have been significant technical advances in battery technology in recent years, and more are to be expected in the future.
The size of the battery bank determines the range of the boat under electric power alone. The speed that the boat is motored at also affects this - a lower speed can make a big difference to the energy required to move a hull. Other factors that affect range include sea-state, windage and any charge that can be reclaimed while under way, for example by solar panels in full sun. A wind turbine in a good following wind will help, and motor-sailing in any wind could do so even more.

===Speed controller===

To make the boat usable and maneuverable, a simple-to-operate forward/stop/backwards speed controller is needed. This must be efficient—i.e. it must not get hot and waste energy at any speed—and it must be able to stand the full current that could conceivably flow under any full-load condition. One of the most common types of speed controllers uses pulse-width modulation (PWM). PWM controllers send high frequency pulses of power to the motor(s). As more power is needed the pulses become longer in duration.

===Electric motor===

A wide variety of electric motor technologies are in use. Traditional field-wound DC motors were and still are used. Today many boats use lightweight permanent magnet DC motors. The advantage of both types is that while the speed can be controlled electronically, this is not a requirement. Some boats use AC motors or permanent magnet brushless motors. The advantages of these are the lack of commutators which can wear out or fail and the often lower currents allowing thinner cables; the disadvantages are the total reliance on the required electronic controllers and the usually high voltages which require a high standard of insulation.

===Drive train===

Traditional boats use an inboard motor powering a propeller though a propeller shaft complete with bearings and seals. Often a gear reduction is incorporated in order to be able to use a larger more efficient propeller. This can be a traditional gear box, coaxial planetary gears or a transmission with belts or chains. Because of the inevitable loss associated with gearing, many drives eliminate it by using slow high-torque motors. The electric motor can be encapsulated into a pod with the propeller and fixed outside the hull (saildrive) or on an outboard fixture (outboard motor).

==Types==

There are as many types of electric boat as there are boats with any other method of propulsion, but some types are significant for various reasons.

===Wired electric boats===

A special category of electric boats are the vessels receiving their electrical power by wire. One or two wires are fixed over the water and the boat can make contact with them to draw electrical current. In case of a single wire the electrical circuit has to be closed by the water itself, giving rise to a larger resistance and corrosion of the electrodes. In case of two wires no electrical current has to be sent through the water, but the twin wires, which cause a short-circuit whenever they come into contact with each other, complicate the construction.
Naturally the boat has to stay close to the wire and therefore it is limited in its manoeuvrability. For ferries and on narrow canals this is no problem. The Straussee Ferry in Strausberg, Germany is an example. It crosses a lake along a 370 m trajectory. It is powered by 170 V from a single overhead wire. In the [tpl]ill|fr|Mauvages tunnel|Tunnel de Mauvages[/tpl] on the Marne-Rhine Canal a bipolar overhead line provides 600 V DC to an electrical tug, pulling itself and several ships through the 4877 m tunnel along a submerged chain. This prevents the buildup of diesel exhaust fumes in the tunnel. Another example was the experimental [tpl]ill|de|electrical tug Teltow|Teltow (Schiff)[/tpl] on the Kleinmachnower See, 17 km south-west of Berlin. It was used from 1903 till 1910 and had current collection poles based on those used on trolley buses.

==Pollution and embodied energy==

All the component parts of any boat have to be manufactured and will eventually have to be disposed of. Some pollution and use of other energy sources are inevitable during these stages of the boat's life and electric boats are no exception. The benefits to the global environment that are achieved by the use of electric propulsion are manifested during the working life of the boat, which can be many years. These benefits are also most directly felt in the sensitive and very beautiful environments in which such a boat is used.
The May 2010 edition of Classic Boat magazine carried a pro and con article entitled Electric debate.[tpl]cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Jamie|coauthors=Kevin Desmond, Ian Rutter|date=May 2010|title=Electric debate|journal=Classic Boat|publisher=IPC Media|location=Croydon, England|issue=263|pages=48–49|issn=0950 3315|url=http://www.classicboat.co.uk|accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl] Jamie Campbell argued against electric boating on four main counts, which were rebuffed by Kevin Desmond and Ian Rutter of the Electric Boat Association. Jamie Campbell asserted that electric propulsion can no more be justified afloat than a Seagull outboard motor, proposing wooden sailing boats and rowing dinghies as "by far the most environmentally sensitive and renewable options for recreational boating".
The article mentions 25% and 30% discounts being offered to electric boaters by the UK Environment Agency and the Broads Authority and that battery powered vehicles have [tpl]frac|3|5[/tpl] the carbon footprint of their petrol equivalents. It is claimed that a typical recharge after a day's cruising costs £1.50, without the use of solar or wind power.

==Solar ships==

In 2010, the Tûranor PlanetSolar, a 35 metre long, 26 metre wide catamaran yacht powered by 537 square metres of solar panels, was unveiled. On 4 May 2012 it completed a [tpl]convert|60023|km|mi[/tpl] circumnavigation of the Earth in Monaco after 585 days and visiting 28 different countries, without using any fossil fuel. It is so far the largest solar-powered boat ever built.[ref]Raphael Domjan the swiss ecoexplorer was the founder and the expedition leader of the project PlanetSolar.
