Following the departure of Capello, he was confirmed beside new head coach Didier Deschamps for the Serie B debut season for the bianconeri.

In his first press conference, he introduced himself as a "little Mourinho" because of the fact he worked for and learnt from several top-rated football managers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/may30p.html|title=New Juve boss 'a mini-Mourinho'|date=30 May 2007|accessdate=2007-06-24|author=Football Italia |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070601180625/http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/may30p.html  |archivedate = 1 June 2007[/tpl] In his tenure as Juventus caretaker, Corradini did not manage to achieve a single point, with Juventus losing to relegation-battling sides Bari and Spezia.
