Eskaton is a defunct vanity record label created by Coil, exclusively for albums put out by the group and their friends. Its brother labels are Threshold House and Chalice.
The record label is often associated with the symbol of the "Chaos Cross" and the "Twisted Chaos Cross", symbols which have appeared on several Eskaton releases, such as Gold Is The Metal with the Broadest Shoulders.
