A recent survey by the US-based organization "Terror Free Tomorrow" with error is +/- 3.1 percent margin and uniform sampling based on provincial populations mentions the breakdown as following:http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/upimagestft/TFT%20Iran%20Survey%20Report%200609.pdf
Note that the "Terror Free Tomorrow" organization is vehemently anti-Iranian and its statistics haven't been taken inside Iran or by any recognized organization or specialist.

==Ethnologue list of languages in Iran==

The following list details the languages spoken in Iran and lists the total number of speakers for each language (data from Ethnologue).Ethnologue report for languages of Iran Note that these numbers add up to only 45 million, which is less than Iran's current population of 75 million.
The sum of the above figures is almost 5 million more than the population despite the fact that the numbers of people who speak certain languages are still "unknown" according to this list.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] There is wide variations in the use of verbs with similar meanings in the languages and dialects of Iran even in the same subdivisions which sometimes make understanding difficult or impossible between the far or even near regions speaking linguistically the same language or dialect e.g. between northern and southern Kurdish, Talysh, etc. On the other hand, there are similarities between the languages of far places which are completely different from the standard Persian.
