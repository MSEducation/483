[[Ductus arteriosus]]

CATEGORIES: Embryology of cardiovascular system

In the developing fetus, the ductus arteriosus (DA), also called the ductus Botalli, is a blood vessel connecting the pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta. It allows most of the blood from the right ventricle to bypass the fetus's fluid-filled non-functioning lungs. Upon closure at birth, it becomes the ligamentum arteriosum.  There are two other fetal shunts, the ductus venosus and the foramen ovale.

==Clinical significance==

===Patent ductus arteriosus===

Failure of a child's DA to close after birth results in a condition called patent ductus arteriosus and the generation of a left-to-right shunt. If left uncorrected, patency leads to pulmonary hypertension and possibly congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Prostaglandins are responsible for maintaining the ductus arteriosus by dilation of the vascular smooth muscles.
The E series of prostaglandins are responsible for maintaining the patency of ductus arterisus (DA) throughout the fetal period.[tpl]cite web|title=Prostaglandins and the ductus arteriosus|url=http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/pdf/01406736/v308i7990/837_patda.xml.|publisher=The Lancet[/tpl] Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), produced by both the placenta and the DA itself, is by far the most potent of the E prostaglandins, but prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) also has a role in keeping the ductus arteriosus open.[tpl]cite journal|last=Olley|first=P.M.|coauthors=Conceani F.|journal=Annual Review of Medicine|year=1981|volume=32|issue=1|pages=375–385|url=http://journals1.scholarsportal.info.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/pdf/00664219/v32i0001/375_patda.xml[/tpl]  PGE1 and PGE2 keep the ductus open by increasing the concentration of intracellular cAMP, and by using specific receptors such as EP2 or EP4 which are sensitive to PGE2.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bouayad|first=D.R.|coauthors=Kajini W., Waleh N., Fouron J.

Increased cAMP inhibits myosin light chain kinase, preventing the phosphorylation of myosin light chain,  leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle surrounding the DA.[tpl]cite journal|last=Zelis|first=R|title=Mechanisms of Vasodilation|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|date=27 June 1983|volume=74|issue=6|pages=3–12|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/science/article/pii/0002934383908483[/tpl] Throughout pregnancy the DA of the fetus remains open, due  prostaglandins, but immediately after birth the levels of both PGE2 and the EP4 receptors will reduce significantly.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gruzdeva|first=A.|coauthors=Nguyena, M., Kovarovob, M., Koller, B.|title=PGE2 through the EP4 receptor controls smooth muscle gene expression patterns in the ductus arteriosus critical for remodeling at birth.|journal=Prostaglandins and other Lipid Mediators|date=March 2012|volume=94|issue=3|pages=109–119|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/science/article/pii/S109888231200024X[/tpl] This allows the ductus arteriosus to close, so that the normal post-natal circulation of the heart can commence. 
If the child has certain congenital heart defects such as Transposition of the great arteries, they may have prostaglandins administered to them to maintain the patency of the ductus arteriosus until surgery can be performed.[tpl]cite web|title=Congenital heart defects: Prostaglandins and prostaglandin inhibitors.|url=https://myhealth.alberta.ca/health/pages/conditions.aspx?hwid=hw255991&|work=Healthwise|publisher=My Health Alberta[/tpl] This is necessary, so that the blood can continue to circulate and become oxygenated, until the congenital defect can be corrected.
Closure may be induced with NSAIDs because these drugs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis.
The ductus arterisous may remain patent after birth. In this case non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will be used to close the DA.[tpl]cite journal|last=Olley|first=P.M.|coauthors=COnceani F.|title=Prostaglandins and the ductus arteriosus|journal=Annual Review of Medicine|year=1981|volume=32|issue=1|pages=375–385|url=http://journals1.scholarsportal.info.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/pdf/00664219/v32i0001/375_patda.xml[/tpl] Prostaglandins are formed when arachadonic acid is cleaved from the phospholipid membrane of a cell and broken down.[tpl]cite journal|last=Robinson|first=D.R.|title=Prostaglandins and the mechanism of action of anti-inflammatory drugs|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|date=31 October 1983|volume=75|issue=4|pages=26–31|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/science/article/pii/000293438390325X[/tpl] The enzyme that is responsible for the breakdown of arachodonic acid is cyclooxygenase.[tpl]cite journal|last=Robinson|first=D.R.|title=Prostaglandins and the mechanism of action of anti-inflammatory drugs.|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|date=31 October 1983|volume=75|issue=4|pages=26–31|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/science/article/pii/000293438390325X[/tpl] NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis by acting directly on cyclooxygenase, preventing the breakdown of arachadonic acid to prostaglandins.[tpl]cite journal|last=Robinson|first=D.R|title=Prostaglandins and the mechanism of action of anti-inflammatory drugs.|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|date=31 October 1983|volume=74|issue=4|pages=26–31|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/science/article/pii/000293438390325X[/tpl] The most common NSAID that is used to force DA closure is Indomethacin, which can be administered after birth.[tpl]cite journal|last=Olley|first=P.M|coauthors=Conceani F.|title=Prostaglandins and the ductus arteriosus|journal=Review of Medicine|year=1981|volume=32|issue=1|pages=375–385|url=http://journals1.scholarsportal.info.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/pdf/00664219/v32i0001/375_patda.xml[/tpl] By inhibiting the formation of PGE2, the ability to activate EP4 receptors and therefore the ability to increase the concentration of cAMP will be decreased,  and normal circulation can begin. NSAIDs taken late in a pregnancy can cross the placenta and lead to premature closure of the DA in the fetus.[tpl]cite journal|last=Anonucci|first=R|coauthors=Zaffanello, M., Puxeddu, E., Porcella, A., Cuzzolin, L., Pilloni, M., Fanos, V.|title=Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in pregnancy:impact on the fetus and newborn|journal=Current Drug Metabolism|year=2012|volume=13|issue=4|pages=474–490[/tpl] If this were to happen, exogenous PDE2 can be administered to reverse the effects of the NSAIDs and maintain the patency of the DA for the remainder of the pregnancy.[tpl]cite journal|last=Olley|first=P.M|coauthors=Conceani F.|title=Prostaglandins and the ductus arteriosus|journal=Annual Review of Medicine|year=1981|volume=32|issue=1|pages=375–385|url=http://journals1.scholarsportal.info.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/pdf/00664219/v32i0001/375_patda.xml[/tpl]
A patent ductus arteriosus affects around 4% of infants with Down syndrome (DS). A failure to thrive is a very common sign of this condition.Pritchard & Korf. "Medical Genetics at a Glance". Blackwell Publishing. 2010. p63.
