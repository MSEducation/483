Wellington [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɛ|l|ɪ|ŋ|t|ən[/tpl] is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with [tpl]NZ population data||y[/tpl] residents. It comprises four cities: Wellington city, on the peninsula between Cook Strait and Wellington Harbour, contains the central business district and about half the population; Porirua on Porirua Harbour to the north is notable for its large Māori and Pacific Island communities; Lower Hutt and Upper Hutt are largely suburban areas to the northeast, together known as the Hutt Valley. 
Wellington is at the southwestern tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. It is the major population centre of the southern North Island, and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. Wellington is the world's southernmost capital city of a country.
The 2014 Mercer Quality of Living Survey ranked Wellington 12th in the world.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mercer.com/qualityoflivingpr#city-rankings |title=2014 Quality of Living Worldwide City Rankings - Mercer Survey |publisher=www.mercer.com |date=19 February 2014  |accessdate=11 April 2014  [/tpl] In 2011 Lonely Planet Best in Travel 2011 named Wellington as fourth in its Top 10 Cities to Visit in 2011, referring to it as the "coolest little capital in the world".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/press-centre/press-release.cfm?press_release_id=503 |title=Lonely Planet Names Wellington One of 2011's Top 10 Cities |publisher=www.lonelyplanet.com |date=1 November 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010 [/tpl]

==Etymology==

Wellington takes its name from Arthur Wellesley (1769-1852), the first Duke of Wellington and victor of the Battle of Waterloo (1815): his title comes from  the town of Wellington in the English county of Somerset. It was named in November 1840 by the original settlers of the New Zealand Company on the suggestion of the directors of the same, in recognition of the Duke's strong support for the company's principles of colonisation and his "strenuous and successful defence against its enemies of the measure for colonising South Australia". One of the founders of the settlement, Edward Jerningham Wakefield, reported that the settlers "took up the views of the directors with great cordiality and the new name was at once adopted".Edward Jerningham Wakefield, "Adventure in New Zealand", Vol. 1, pub. John Murray, 1845.
In Māori, Wellington has three names. Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara refers to Wellington Harbour and means "the great harbour of Tara";[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/te-ati-awa-of-wellington|title=Story: Te Āti Awa of Wellington|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand[/tpl], orthographic conventions sourced from [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tetaurawhiri.govt.nz/english/pub_e/conventions2.shtml|title=Māori Language Commission[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
[/ref] Pōneke is a transliteration of Port Nick, short for Port Nicholson (the city's central marae, the community supporting it and its kapa haka have the pseudo-tribal name of Ngāti Pōneke);[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/placeprofilesummary.aspx?id=35015|title=Poneke|publisher=New Zealand Department of Conservation[/tpl] Te Upoko-o-te-Ika-a-Māui, meaning 'The Head of the Fish of Māui' (often shortened to Te Upoko-o-te-Ika), a traditional name for the southernmost part of the North Island, deriving from the legend of the fishing up of the island by the demi-god Māui.
In New Zealand Sign Language, the name is signed by raising the index, middle and ring fingers of one hand, palm forward, to form a "W", and shaking it slightly from side to side twice while mouthing "Wellington".[tpl]cite web |url= http://nzsl.vuw.ac.nz/signs/4738 |title= Wellington – New Zealand Sign Language Online |publisher= Deaf Studies Research Unit, Victoria University of Wellington |accessdate= 11 November 2013[/tpl]

==History==

===Settlement===

Legends recount that Kupe discovered and explored the district in about the 10th century. The earliest date with hard evidence for Maori living  in New Zealand is about 1280.
European settlement began with the arrival of an advance party of the New Zealand Company on the ship Tory on 20 September 1839, followed by 150 settlers on the Aurora on 22 January 1840. The settlers constructed their first homes at Petone (which they called Britannia for a time) on the flat area at the mouth of the Hutt River. When that proved swampy and flood prone they transplanted the plans, which had been drawn without regard for the hilly terrain.

===New Zealand's capital===

In 1865, Wellington became the capital city in place of Auckland, which William Hobson had made the capital in 1841. The Parliament of New Zealand had first met in Wellington on 7 July 1862, on a temporary basis; in November 1863, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Alfred Domett, placed a resolution before Parliament in Auckland that "... it has become necessary that the seat of government ... should be transferred to some suitable locality in Cook Strait region." Apparently there had been some concerns that the more populous South Island (where the goldfields were located) would choose to form a separate colony in the British Empire. Several Commissioners invited from Australia, chosen for their neutral status, declared that Wellington was a suitable location because of its central location in New Zealand and good harbour. Parliament officially met in Wellington for the first time on 26 July 1865. At that time, the population of Wellington was just 4,900.[tpl]cite book |last=Temple|first=Philip |year=1980 |title=Wellington Yesterday |isbn=0-86868-012-5 |publisher=John McIndoe |authorlink=Philip Temple[/tpl] Wellington's status as capital is by constitutional convention rather than statute.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Levine |first=Stephen |year=2012 |title=Capital city - Wellington, capital city |encyclopedia=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/capital-city/page-4 [/tpl]
Wellington is the location of the highest court, the Supreme Court of New Zealand, and the historic former High Court building has been enlarged and restored for its use. Government House, the official residence of the Governor-General, is in Newtown, opposite the Basin Reserve. Premier House, the official residence of the Prime Minister, is in Thorndon on Tinakori Road.

===Importance===

Wellington is New Zealand's political centre, housing Parliament, the head offices of all Government Ministries and Departments and the bulk of the foreign diplomatic missions. It is an important centre of the film and theatre industry, and second to Auckland in terms of numbers of screen industry businesses.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl][/ref] Te Papa Tongarewa (the Museum of New Zealand), the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, the Royal New Zealand Ballet, Museum of Wellington City & Sea and the biennial New Zealand International Arts Festival are all sited there.
Wellington had the 12th best quality of living in the world in 2014, a ranking up from 13th place in 2012, according to a 2014 study by consulting company Mercer. Of cities with English as the primary language, it ranked fourth in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mercer.com/referencecontent.jhtml?idContent=1128060 |title=Mercer 2007 World-wide quality of living survey |publisher=Mercer.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16[/tpl] Of cities in the Asia Pacific region, it ranked third (2014) behind Auckland and Sydney. It became much more affordable in terms of cost of living relative to cities worldwide, with its ranking moving from 93rd (more expensive) to 139th (less expensive) in 2009, probably as a result of currency fluctuations during the global economic downturn from March 2008 to March 2009.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.mercer.co.nz/homepage.htm?siteLanguage=100 |title= Worldwide Cost of Living survey 2009–City ranking released–Mercer survey|accessdate=27 July 2009[/tpl] "Foreigners get more bang for their buck in Wellington, which is among the cheapest cities in the world to live", according to a 2009 article, which reported that currency fluctuations make New Zealand cities affordable for multi-national firms to do business: "New Zealand cities were now more affordable for expatriates and were competitive places for overseas companies to develop business links and send employees".
Lonely Planet named Wellington 'the coolest little capital in the world' in its 'Best In Travel 2011' guide book. It is home to Weta Workshop, associated with Peter Jackson, behind critically acclaimed films like The Lord of the Rings (film series), King Kong (2005 film) and Avatar (2009 film).

==Geography==

Wellington is at the south-western tip of the North Island on Cook Strait, separating the North and South Islands. On a clear day the snowcapped Kaikoura Ranges are visible to the south across the strait. To the north stretch the golden beaches of the Kapiti Coast. On the east the Rimutaka Range divides Wellington from the broad plains of the Wairarapa, a wine region of national notability. With a latitude of 41° 17' South, Wellington is the southernmost capital city in the world.[tpl]cite book |title= Guinness World Records 2009|coauthors= |year= 2008 |publisher=Guinness World Records Ltd|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-1-904994-36-7 |page= 277 |url= [/tpl] It is also the most remote capital city, the farthest away from any other capital. It is more densely populated than most other cities in New Zealand due to the restricted amount of land that is available between its harbour and the surrounding hills. It has very few open areas in which to expand, and this has brought about the development of the suburban towns. Because of its location in the Roaring Forties and its exposure to the winds blowing through Cook Strait, Wellington is known as "Windy Wellington".
Wellington's scenic natural harbour and green hillsides adorned with tiered suburbs of colonial villas are popular with tourists. The CBD is close to Lambton Harbour, an arm of Wellington Harbour, which lies along an active geological fault, clearly evident on its straight western shore. The land to the west of this rises abruptly, meaning that many suburbs sit high above the centre of the city. There is a network of bush walks and reserves maintained by the Wellington City Council and local volunteers. These include Otari-Wilton's Bush, dedicated to the protection and propagation of native plants. The Wellington region has [tpl]convert|500|km2|sqmi|-1[/tpl] of regional parks and forests. In the east is the Miramar Peninsula, connected to the rest of the city by a low-lying isthmus at Rongotai, the site of Wellington International Airport.
The narrow entrance to the harbour is to the east of the Miramar Peninsula, and contains the dangerous shallows of Barrett Reef, where many ships have been wrecked (most famously the inter-island ferry [tpl]ship|TEV|Wahine[/tpl] in 1968).[tpl]cite web |url= http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/kids/nzdisasters/wahine.asp |title=New Zealand Disasters – Wahine Shipwreck |publisher=Christchurch City Libraries |date= 10 April 1968 |accessdate=28 July 2009[/tpl] The harbour has three islands: Matiu/Somes Island, Makaro/Ward Island and Mokopuna Island. Only Matiu/Somes Island is large enough for habitation. It has been used as a quarantine station for people and animals, and was an internment camp during World War I and World War II. It is a conservation island, providing refuge for endangered species, much like Kapiti Island farther up the coast. There is access during daylight hours by the Dominion Post Ferry.
Wellington is primarily surrounded by water, but some of near-by locations are listed below. 

===Wellington's suburbs===

The urban area stretches across the areas administered by the city councils of Wellington, Hutt (covering Lower Hutt), Upper Hutt and Porirua.

===Population===

The four cities have a total population of [tpl]formatnum:[tpl]#expr: [tpl]formatnum:[tpl]NZ population data|Porirua City|y[/tpl]|R[/tpl] + [tpl]formatnum:[tpl]NZ population data|Upper Hutt City|y[/tpl]|R[/tpl] + [tpl]formatnum:[tpl]NZ population data|Lower Hutt City|y[/tpl]|R[/tpl] + [tpl]formatnum:[tpl]NZ population data|Wellington City|y[/tpl]|R[/tpl] [/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]NZ population data|||y|y|(|),[/tpl] and the urban area contains 99% of that population. The remaining areas are largely mountainous and sparsely farmed or parkland and are outside the urban area boundary. More than most cities, life is dominated by its central business district (CBD). Approximately 62,000 people work in the CBD, only 4,000 fewer than work in Auckland's CBD, despite that city having three times the population.
Another major population area is the Kapiti Coast, north of Porirua and including the towns of Paraparaumu, Waikanae and Otaki.  The population is [tpl]formatnum:[tpl]NZ population data|Kapiti Coast District|y[/tpl]|R[/tpl].  The beach and garden zones of these townships attract life-stylers and retired people: 24.6% are aged 65+ as at June 2011 estimates: See Waikanae River and Otaki Beach.''
Counts from the 2013 census gave totals by area, sex, and age. Wellington had the largest population of the four cities with 197,019 people, followed by Lower Hutt, Porirua and Upper Hutt. Women outnumber men in all four areas, according to data from Statistics New Zealand, particularly in Wellington city.[tpl]cite web|title= Regional Summary Tables – 2006 Census of Population and Dwellings – Regional Summary Tables by territorial authority (spreadsheet) |publisher=Statistics New Zealand|accessdate=30 July 2009|url = http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2006-census-data/2006-census-reports/regional-summary-tables.aspx[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] The 2011 Census was cancelled as it was due to take place just after the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl].

===Age distribution===

Age distributions for the four cities are given (see table below). The age structure closely matches the national distribution.
The relative lack of older people in Wellington is less marked when Kapiti Coast District is included - nearly 7% of Kapiti Coast residents are over 80.

===Climate===

The city averages 2025 hours (or about 169 days) of sunshine per year.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl][/ref] The climate is a temperate marine one, (Köppen: Cfb ) is generally moderate all year round, and rarely sees temperatures above [tpl]convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] or below [tpl]convert|4|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The hottest recorded temperature is [tpl]convert|31.1|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl], while [tpl]convert|-1.9|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] is the coldest. The city is notorious for its southerly blasts in winter, which may make the temperature feel much colder. It is generally very windy all year round with high rainfall; average annual rainfall is [tpl]convert|1249|mm|0|abbr=on[/tpl], June and July being the wettest months. Frosts are quite common in the hill suburbs and the Hutt Valley between May and September. Snow is very rare at low altitudes, although snow fell on the city and many other parts of the Wellington region during separate events in  July and August 2011.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/5333010/Snow-surge-forecast-for-lower-North-Island |title=Snow spotted in central Wellington |work=The Dominion Post |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=1 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/5442969/Snow-falls-in-downtown-Wellington |title=Snow falls in downtown Wellington  |work=The Dominion Post |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2011[/tpl]

===Earthquakes===

Wellington suffered serious damage in a series of earthquakes in 1848[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/NaturalHazardsAndDisasters/HistoricEarthquakes/2/en |title=The 1848 Marlborough earthquake – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=30 March 2005 |accessdate=6 February 2009[/tpl] and from another earthquake in 1855. The 1855 Wairarapa earthquake occurred on the Wairarapa Fault to the north and east of Wellington. It was probably the most powerful earthquake in recorded New Zealand history,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/NaturalHazardsAndDisasters/HistoricEarthquakes/3/en |title=The 1855 Wairarapa earthquake – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=21 September 2007 |accessdate=6 February 2009[/tpl] with an estimated magnitude of at least 8.2 on the Moment magnitude scale. It caused vertical movements of two to three metres over a large area, including raising land out of the harbour and turning it into a tidal swamp. Much of this land was subsequently reclaimed and is now part of the central business district. For this reason the street named Lambton Quay is 100 to 200 metres (325 to 650 ft) from the harbour – plaques set into the footpath mark the shoreline in 1840, indicating the extent of reclamation.
The area has high seismic activity even by New Zealand standards, with a major fault line running through the centre of the city, and several others nearby. Several hundred minor fault lines have been identified within the urban area. Inhabitants, particularly in high-rise buildings, typically notice several earthquakes every year. For many years after the 1855 earthquake, the majority of buildings were made entirely from wood. The 1996-restored Government Buildings[tpl]NZHPT|37|Government Buildings|2009-02-06[/tpl] near Parliament is the largest wooden building in the Southern Hemisphere. While masonry and structural steel have subsequently been used in building construction, especially for office buildings, timber framing remains the primary structural component of almost all residential construction. Residents place their confidence in good building regulations, which became more stringent in the 20th century.
Since the Canterbury earthquakes of 2010 and 2011, earthquake readiness has become even more of an issue, with buildings declared by Wellington City Council to be earthquake-prone,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/4761054/Shuddering-in-Wellington|title=Shuddering in Wellington|author=Dave Burgess|publisher=Fairfax NZ|date=14 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/business/commercial-property/7031111/How-safe-are-the-capitals-office-buildings|title=How safe are the capital's office buildings?|author=Hank Schouten|publisher=Dominion Post|date=2 June 2012[/tpl] and the costs of meeting new standards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington-central/7822064/Councillors-question-quake-costs|title=Councillors question quake costs|author=Kate Chapman|publisher=The Dominion Post|date=16 October 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/5714033/Quake-shakes-capital-insurance-market|title=Quake shakes capital insurance market|author=Dave Burgess & Hank Schouten|publisher=The Dominion Post|date=1 October 2011[/tpl]

==Architecture==

Wellington showcases a variety of architectural styles from the past 150 years – 19th-century wooden cottages, such as the Italianate Katherine Mansfield Birthplace in Thorndon; streamlined Art Deco structures such as the old Wellington Free Ambulance headquarters, the Central Fire Station, Fountain Court Apartments, the City Gallery, and the former Post and Telegraph Building; and the curves and vibrant colours of post-modern architecture in the CBD.
The oldest building is the 1858 Colonial Cottage in Mount Cook.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.colonialcottagemuseum.org.nz |title=Colonial Cottage |publisher=Colonialcottagemuseum.co.nz |accessdate=6 February 2009[/tpl] The tallest building is the Majestic Centre on Willis Street at 116 metres high,SkyScraper City archive (Retrieved 22 September 2006) the second tallest being the structural expressionist State Insurance Building at 103 metres.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=stateinsurancetower-wellington-newzealand |title=Emporis.com |publisher=Emporis.com |date=11 November 2006 |accessdate=6 February 2009[/tpl]
For a full list see: List of tallest buildings in Wellington.
Futuna Chapel in Karori was the first bicultural building in New Zealand, and is considered one of the most significant New Zealand buildings of the 20th century.
Old St Paul's is an example of 19th-century Gothic Revival architecture adapted to colonial conditions and materials, as is St Mary of the Angels. The Museum of Wellington City & Sea in the Bond Store is in the Second French Empire style, and the Wellington Harbour Board Wharf Office Building is in a late English Classical style. There are several restored theatre buildings: the St James Theatre, the Opera House and the Embassy Theatre.
Civic Square is surrounded by the Town Hall and council offices, the Michael Fowler Centre, the Wellington Central Library, Capital E (home of the National Theatre for Children), the City-to-Sea Bridge, and the City Gallery.
As the capital city, there are many notable government buildings. The conical Executive Wing of New Zealand Parliament Buildings, on the corner of Lambton Quay and Molesworth Street, was constructed between 1969 and 1981 and is commonly referred to as the Beehive. Across the road is the largest wooden building in the Southern Hemisphere,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/historic/by-region/wellington-kapiti/wellington/government-buildings/ |title=Department of Conservation |publisher=Doc.govt.nz |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=6 February 2009[/tpl] part of the old Government Buildings which now houses part of Victoria University of Wellington's Law Faculty.
The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa is on the waterfront.
Other notable buildings include Wellington Town Hall, Wellington Railway Station, Dominion Museum (now Massey University), State Insurance Building, Westpac Stadium, and Wellington Airport at Rongotai. Leading architects include Frederick Thatcher, Frederick de Jersey Clere, W. Gray Young, Bill Alington, Ian Athfield, Roger Walker and Pynenburg and Collins.
Wellington contains many iconic sculptures and structures, such as the Bucket Fountain in Cuba Street and Invisible City by Anton Parsons on Lambton Quay. Kinetic sculptures have been commissioned, such as the Zephyrometer.[tpl]cite web |url= http://texture.co.nz/blogs/reviews/archive/2008/09/23/kinetic-sculpture-by-tony-nicholls-enjoy-public-art-gallery.aspx|title= Kinetic Sculpture by Tony Nicholls – Enjoy Public Art Gallery |accessdate=28 July 2009 |publisher=Texture – Wellington, New Zealand|date=23 September 2008 [/tpl] This 26-metre orange spike built for movement by artist Phil Price has been described as "tall, soaring and elegantly simple", which "reflects the swaying of the yacht masts in the Evans Bay Marina behind it" and "moves like the needle on the dial of a nautical instrument, measuring the speed of the sea or wind or vessel."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.sculpture.org.nz/engine/SID/10018/AID/1105.htm|title= Zephyrometer – The second of the Meridian Energy wind sculptures |accessdate=28 July 2009 |author=Phil Price (kinetic sculptor) |publisher=Wellington Sculpture Trust |year=2003 [/tpl]

==Housing and real estate==

Wellington experienced a real estate boom in the early 2000s and the effects of the international property bust at the start of 2007. In 2005, the market was described as "robust".[tpl]cite news|author=Anne Gibson|title= Robust market sprouts apartments|work=The New Zealand Herald|date = 3 August 2005|accessdate=29 July 2009|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10338845[/tpl] By 2008, property values had declined by about 9.3% over a 12-month period, according to one estimate.

A Wellington City Council survey conducted in March 2009 found the typical central city apartment dweller was a New Zealand native aged 24 to 35 with a professional job in the downtown area, with household income higher than surrounding areas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wellington.govt.nz/~/media/services/environment-and-waste/urban-development/files/apartment-survey-report.pdf|title=Central City Apartment Dwellers Survey - a summary of results|date=March 2009|work=Wellington Government|accessdate=11 January 2014[/tpl] Three quarters (73%) walked to work or university, 13% travelled by car, 6% by bus, 2% bicycled (although 31% own bicycles), and did not travel very far since 73% worked or studied in the central city. The large majority (88%) did not have children in their apartments; 39% were couples without children; 32% were single-person households; 15% were groups of people flatting together. Most (56%) owned their apartment; 42% rented (of renters, 16% paid NZ$351 to NZ$450 per week, 13% paid less and 15% paid more – only 3% paid more than NZ$651 per week). The report continued: "The four most important reasons for living in an apartment were given as lifestyle and city living (23%), close to work (20%), close to shops and cafes (11%) and low maintenance (11%) ... City noise and noise from neighbours were the main turnoffs for apartment dwellers (27%), followed by a lack of outdoor space (17%), living close to neighbours (9%) and apartment size and a lack of storage space (8%)."[tpl]cite news|title= It's a great life downtown ... except for the noise|work=The New Zealand Herald|date = 14 April 2009|accessdate=29 July 2009|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/wellington-city-council/news/article.cfm?o_id=240&objectid=10566448[/tpl]
Households are primarily one-family, making up 67% of households, followed by single-person households (25%); there were fewer multiperson households and even fewer households containing two or more families. These counts are from the 2006 census for the Wellington region (which includes the surrounding area in addition to the four cities).[tpl]NZ Quickstats|1000009|Wellington Region[/tpl]

==Economy==

The Government sector has long been a mainstay of the economy, which has typically risen and fallen with it. Traditionally, its central location meant it was the location of many head offices of various sectors – particularly finance, technology and heavy industry – many of which have since relocated to Auckland following economic deregulation and privatisation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wellington-region/page-11 |title=The Encyclopedia of NZ - Economic fall and rise: 1976–2006 |publisher=Te Ara |date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2013-09-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/comment/7327389/Wellington-businesses-are-fighting-back|title=Wellington businesses are fighting back|author=Terry Hall|publisher=The Dominion Post|date=23 July 2012[/tpl]

Filmmakers Sir Peter Jackson, Sir Richard Taylor and a growing team of creative professionals have turned the eastern suburb of Miramar into a film-making, post-production and special effects infrastructure centre, giving rise to the moniker 'Wellywood'. Jackson's companies include Weta Workshop, Weta Digital, Camperdown Studios, post-production house Park Road Post, and Stone Street Studios near Wellington Airport. Recent films shot partly or wholly in Wellington include the Lord of The Rings trilogy, King Kong and Avatar. Jackson described Wellington: "Well, it's windy. But it's actually a lovely place, where you're pretty much surrounded by water and the bay. The city itself is quite small, but the surrounding areas are very reminiscent of the hills up in northern California, like Marin County near San Francisco and the Bay Area climate and some of the architecture. Kind of a cross between that and Hawaii."
Sometime Wellington directors Jane Campion and Geoff Murphy have reached the world's screens with their independent spirit. Emerging Kiwi film-makers, like Robert Sarkies, Taika Waititi, Costa Botes and Jennifer Bush-Daumec, are extending the Wellington-based lineage and cinematic scope.

==Transport==

Wellington is served by State Highway 1 in the west and State Highway 2 in the east, meeting at the Ngauranga Interchange north of the city centre, where SH 1 runs through the city to the airport. Road access into the capital is lower in grade than most other cities in New Zealand – between Wellington and the Kapiti Coast, SH 1 travels along the Centennial Highway, a narrow section of road, and between Wellington and Wairarapa SH 2 transverses the Rimutaka Ranges on a similar narrow accident-prone road. Wellington has two short motorways, both part of SH 1: the Johnsonville–Porirua Motorway and the Wellington Urban Motorway, which in combination with a small non-motorway section in the Ngauranga Gorge connect Porirua with Wellington city.
