The time required to make SWNT forests of the height of 2.5&nbsp;mm by this method was 10 minutes in 2004. Those SWNT forests can be easily separated from the catalyst, yielding clean SWNT material (purity >99.98%) without further purification. For comparison, the as-grown HiPco CNTs contain about 5–35%<ref>[tpl]cite web|title=Unidym product sheet SWNT|url=http://www.unidym.com/files/Unidym_Product_Sheet_SWNT.pdf[/tpl]</ref> of metal impurities; it is therefore purified through dispersion and centrifugation that damages the nanotubes. Super-growth avoids this problem. Patterned highly organized single-walled nanotube structures were successfully fabricated using the super-growth technique.
The mass density of super-growth CNTs is about 0.037 g/cm3.[tpl]cite web|title=Characteristic of Carbon nanotubes by super-growth method|language=japanese|url=http://www.nanocarbon.jp/sg/002.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=K.Hata|title=From Highly Efficient Impurity-Free CNT Synthesis to DWNT forests, CNTsolids and Super-Capacitors|url=http://www.nanocarbon.jp/english/research/image/review.pdf[/tpl] It is much lower than that of conventional CNT powders (~1.34 g/cm3), probably because the latter contain metals and amorphous carbon.
The super-growth method is basically a variation of CVD. Therefore, it is possible to grow material containing SWNT, DWNTs and MWNTs, and to alter their ratios by tuning the growth conditions.[ref]

The vertically aligned nanotube forests originate from a "zipping effect" when they are immersed in a solvent and dried. The zipping effect is caused by the surface tension of the solvent and the van der Waals forces between the carbon nanotubes. It aligns the nanotubes into a dense material, which can be formed in various shapes, such as sheets and bars, by applying weak compression during the process. Densification increases the Vickers hardness by about 70 times and density is 0.55 g/cm3. The packed carbon nanotubes are more than 1 mm long and have a carbon purity of 99.9% or higher; they also retain the desirable alignment properties of the nanotubes forest.[ref]

===Application-related issues===

Many electronic applications of carbon nanotubes crucially rely on techniques of selectively producing either semiconducting or metallic CNTs, preferably of a certain chirality. Several methods of separating semiconducting and metallic CNTs are known, but most of them are not yet suitable for large-scale technological processes. The most efficient method relies on density-gradient ultracentrifugation, which separates surfactant-wrapped nanotubes by the minute difference in their density. This density difference often translates into difference in the nanotube diameter and (semi)conducting properties. Another method of separation uses a sequence of freezing, thawing, and compression of SWNTs embedded in agarose gel. This process results in a solution containing 70% metallic SWNTs and leaves a gel containing 95% semiconducting SWNTs. The diluted solutions separated by this method show various colors.[tpl]cite journal |title=Simple and Scalable Gel-Based Separation of Metallic and Semiconducting Carbon Nanotubes|journal=Nano Letters|volume=9|pages=1497–1500|year=2009|doi=10.1021/nl8034866 |pmid=19243112 |issue=4 |last1=Tanaka |first1=Takeshi |last2=Jin |first2=Hehua |last3=Miyata |first3=Yasumitsu |last4=Fujii |first4=Shunjiro |last5=Suga |first5=Hiroshi |last6=Naitoh |first6=Yasuhisa |last7=Minari |first7=Takeo |last8=Miyadera |first8=Tetsuhiko |last9=Tsukagoshi |first9=Kazuhito|last10=Kataura|first10=Hiromichi|bibcode = 2009NanoL...9.1497T |display-authors=8[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=T.Tanaka|title=New, Simple Method for Separation of Metallic and Semiconducting Carbon Nanotubes|url=http://www.aist.go.jp/aist_e/latest_research/2009/20090406/20090406.html[/tpl] The separated carbon nanotubes using this method have been applied to electrodes, e.g. electric double-layer capacitor.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.carbon.2011.09.062[/tpl] Moreover, SWNTs can be separated by the column chromatography method.

==Current applications==

Current use and application of nanotubes has mostly been limited to the use of bulk nanotubes, which is a mass of rather unorganized fragments of nanotubes. Bulk nanotube materials may never achieve a tensile strength similar to that of individual tubes, but such composites may, nevertheless, yield strengths sufficient for many applications. Bulk carbon nanotubes have already been used as composite fibers in polymers to improve the mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of the bulk product.

==Potential applications==

The strength and flexibility of carbon nanotubes makes them of potential use in controlling other nanoscale structures, which suggests they will have an important role in nanotechnology engineering. The highest tensile strength of an individual multi-walled carbon nanotube has been tested to be is 63 GPa. Carbon nanotubes were found in Damascus steel from the 17th century, possibly helping to account for the legendary strength of the swords made of it.[tpl]cite journal| author=K.

Because of the carbon nanotube's superior mechanical properties, many structures have been proposed ranging from everyday items like clothes and sports gear to combat jackets and space elevators.[tpl]Cite book|title=The Space Elevator|first=Brad C.|last=Edwards|publisher=BC Edwards|year=2003|isbn=0-9746517-1-0[/tpl] However, the space elevator will require further efforts in refining carbon nanotube technology, as the practical tensile strength of carbon nanotubes must be greatly improved.

Carbon nanotubes are also a promising material as building blocks in bio-mimetic hierarchical composite materials given their exceptional mechanical properties (~1 TPa in modulus, and ~100 GPa in strength). Initial attempts to incorporate CNTs into hierarchical structures led to mechanical properties that were significantly lower than these achievable limits.

===Electrical circuits===

Nanotube-based transistors, also known as carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs), have been made that operate at room temperature and that are capable of digital switching using a single electron.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Postma|first=Henk W.

In 2001 IBM researchers demonstrated how metallic nanotubes can be destroyed, leaving semiconducting ones behind for use as transistors. Their process is called "constructive destruction," which includes the automatic destruction of defective nanotubes on the wafer.[tpl]Cite journal|first=Philip G.|last=Collins|title=Engineering Carbon Nanotubes and Nanotube Circuits Using Electrical Breakdown|journal=Science|volume=292|year=2001|pages=706–709|doi=10.1126/science.1058782|pmid=11326094|last2=Arnold|first2=MS|last3=Avouris|first3=P|issue=5517|bibcode = 2001Sci...292..706C [/tpl] This process, however, only gives control over the electrical properties on a statistical scale.
The potential of carbon nanotubes was demonstrated in 2003 when room-temperature ballistic transistors with ohmic metal contacts and high-k gate dielectric were reported, showing 20–30x higher ON current than state-of-the-art Si MOSFETs. This presented an important advance in the field as CNT was shown to potentially outperform Si. At the time, a major challenge was ohmic metal contact formation.

Large structures of carbon nanotubes can be used for thermal management of electronic circuits.

===Electrical cables and wires===

Wires for carrying electrical current may be fabricated from pure nanotubes and nanotube-polymer composites. It has already been demonstrated that carbon nanotube wires can successfully be used for power or data transmission.[tpl]Cite journal |title=Iodine monochloride as a powerful enhancer of electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube wires|date =February 22, 2014|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2014.02.058 |last1=Janas |first1=Dawid |last2=Herman |first2=Artur P. |last3=Boncel |first3=Slawomir |last4=Koziol |first4=Krzysztof K. |journal=Carbon|volume=73|pages =225–233[/tpl] Recently small wires have been fabricated with specific conductivity exceeding copper and aluminum;[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJw6JmZmdqE|title=Nanocables light way to the future|publisher=YouTube|date =September 9, 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |title=Iodine doped carbon nanotube cables exceeding specific electrical conductivity of metals|date =September 6, 2011|doi=10.1038/srep00083 |last1=Zhao |first1=Yao |last2=Wei |first2=Jinquan |last3=Vajtai |first3=Robert |last4=Ajayan |first4=Pulickel M. |last5=Barrera |first5=Enrique V. |journal=Scientific Reports (Nature)|volume=1|pages =83|bibcode = 2011NatSR...1E..83Z [/tpl] these cables are the highest conductivity carbon nanotube and also highest conductivity non-metal cables. 
Recently, composite of carbon nanotube and copper have been shown to exhibit nearly one hundred times higher current-carrying-capacity than pure copper or gold.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/ncomms3202[/tpl] Significantly, the electrical conductivity of such a composite is similar to pure Cu. Thus, this Carbon nanotube-copper (CNT-Cu) composite possesses the highest observed current-carrying capacity among electrical conductors. Thus for a given cross-section of electrical conductor, the CNT-Cu composite can withstand and transport one hundred times higher current compared to metals such as copper and gold.

===Actuators===

The exceptional electrical and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes have made them alternatives to the traditional electrical actuators for both microscopic and macroscopic applications. Carbon nanotubes are very good conductors of both electricity and heat, and they are also very strong and elastic molecules in certain directions.

===Paper batteries===

A paper battery is a battery engineered to use a paper-thin sheet of cellulose (which is the major constituent of regular paper, among other things) infused with aligned carbon nanotubes.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-08/rpi-bbs080907.php|title=Beyond Batteries: Storing Power in a Sheet of Paper|publisher=Eurekalert.org|date =August 13, 2007[/tpl] The nanotubes act as electrodes; allowing the storage devices to conduct electricity. The battery, which functions as both a lithium-ion battery and a supercapacitor, can provide a long, steady power output comparable to a conventional battery, as well as a supercapacitor’s quick burst of high power—and while a conventional battery contains a number of separate components, the paper battery integrates all of the battery components in a single structure, making it more energy efficient.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]

===Solar cells===

One of the promising applications of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is their use in solar panels, due to their strong UV/Vis-NIR absorption characteristics. Research has shown that they can provide a sizeable increase in efficiency, even at their current unoptimized state. Solar cells developed at the New Jersey Institute of Technology use a carbon nanotube complex, formed by a mixture of carbon nanotubes and carbon buckyballs (known as fullerenes) to form snake-like structures. Buckyballs trap electrons, but they can't make electrons flow. Add sunlight to excite the polymers, and the buckyballs will grab the electrons. Nanotubes, behaving like copper wires, will then be able to make the electrons or current flow.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070719011151.htm|title=New Flexible Plastic Solar Panels Are Inexpensive And Easy To Make|publisher=ScienceDaily|date=July 19, 2007[/tpl]
Additional research has been conducted on creating SWNT hybrid solar panels to increase the efficiency further. These hybrids are created by combining SWNT's with photexcitable electron donors to increase the number of electrons generated. It has been found that the interaction between the photoexcited porphyrin and SWNT generates electro-hole pairs at the SWNT surfaces. This phenomenon has been observed experimentally, and contributes practically to an increase in efficiency up to 8.5%.[tpl]cite journal|author=Guldi, Dirk M., G.M.A. Rahman, Maurizio Prato, Norbert Jux, Shubui Qin, and Warren Ford|title=Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes as Integrative Building Blocks for Solar-Energy Conversion|journal=Angewandte Chemie|pmid=15724261|volume= 117 |year=2005|pages=2051–2054|doi=10.1002/ange.200462416|issue=13[/tpl]

===Hydrogen storage===

In addition to being able to store electrical energy, there has been some research in using carbon nanotubes to store hydrogen to be used as a fuel source. By taking advantage of the capillary effects of the small carbon nanotubes, it is possible to condense gases in high density inside single-walled nanotubes. This allows for gases, most notably hydrogen (H2), to be stored at high densities without being condensed into a liquid. Potentially, this storage method could be used on vehicles in place of gas fuel tanks for a hydrogen-powered car. A current issue regarding hydrogen-powered vehicles is the onboard storage of the fuel. Current storage methods involve cooling and condensing the H2 gas to a liquid state for storage which causes a loss of potential energy (25–45%) when compared to the energy associated with the gaseous state. Storage using SWNTs would allow one to keep the H2 in its gaseous state, thereby increasing the storage effciency. This method allows for a volume to energy ratio slightly smaller to that of current gas powered vehicles, allowing for a slightly lower but comparable range.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/386377a0[/tpl]
An area of controversy and frequent experimentation regarding the storage of hydrogen by adsorption in carbon nanotubes is the efficiency by which this process occurs. The effectiveness of hydrogen storage is integral to its use as a primary fuel source since hydrogen only contains about one fourth the energy per unit volume as gasoline.

====Experimental capacity====

One experiment[tpl]cite journal|author=Safa, S., Mojtahedzadeh Larijani, M., Fathollahi, V., Kakuee, O. R.|title=Investigating Hydrogen Storage Behavior of Carbon Nanotubes at Ambient Temperature and Above by Ion Beam Analysis|journal=NANO|doi=10.1142/S1793292010002256|volume= 5|issue=6|year=2010|pages=341–347[/tpl] sought to determine the amount of hydrogen stored in CNTs by utilizing elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA). CNTs (primarily SWNTs) were synthesized via chemical vapor disposition (CVD) and subjected to a two-stage purification process including air oxidation and acid treatment, then formed into flat, uniform discs and exposed to pure, pressurized hydrogen at various temperatures. When the data was analyzed, it was found that the ability of CNTs to store hydrogen decreased as temperature increased. Moreover, the highest hydrogen concentration measured was ~0.18%; significantly lower than commercially viable hydrogen storage needs to be. A separate experimental work performed by using a gravimetric method also revealed the maximum hydrogen uptake capacity of CNTs to be as low as 0.2%.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.10.163[/tpl]
In another experiment,[tpl]cite journal|author=Yuca, N., Karatepe, N.|title=Hydrogen Storage in Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Purified by Microwave Digestion Method|journal=World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology|volume= 79|year=2011|pages=605–610[/tpl] CNTs were synthesized via CVD and their structure was characterized using Raman spectroscopy. Utilizing microwave digestion, the samples were exposed to different acid concentrations and different temperatures for various amounts of time in an attempt to find the optimum purification method for SWNTs of the diameter determined earlier. The purified samples were then exposed to hydrogen gas at various high pressures, and their adsorption by weight percent was plotted. The data showed that hydrogen adsorption levels of up to 3.7% are possible with a very pure sample and under the proper conditions. It is thought that microwave digestion helps improve the hydrogen adsorption capacity of the CNTs by opening up the ends, allowing access to the inner cavities of the nanotubes.

====Limitations on efficient hydrogen adsorption====

The biggest obstacle to efficient hydrogen storage using CNTs is the purity of the nanotubes. To achieve maximum hydrogen adsorption, there must be minimum graphene, amorphous carbon, and metallic deposits in the nanotube sample. Current methods of CNT synthesis require a purification step. However, even with pure nanotubes, the adsorption capacity is only maximized under high pressures, which are undesirable in commercial fuel tanks.

===Supercapacitor===

MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics uses nanotubes to improve supercapacitors. The activated charcoal used in conventional ultracapacitors has many small hollow spaces of various size, which create together a large surface to store electric charge. But as charge is quantized into elementary charges, i.e. electrons, and each such elementary charge needs a minimum space, a significant fraction of the electrode surface is not available for storage because the hollow spaces are not compatible with the charge's requirements. With a nanotube electrode the spaces may be tailored to size—few too large or too small—and consequently the capacity should be increased considerably.Halber, Deborah. MIT LEES on Batteries. Lees.mit.edu.

===Radar absorption===

Radars work in the microwave frequency range, which can be absorbed by MWNTs. Applying the MWNTs to the aircraft would cause the radar to be absorbed and therefore seem to have a smaller signature. One such application could be to paint the nanotubes onto the plane. Recently there has been some work done at the University of Michigan regarding carbon nanotubes usefulness as stealth technology on aircraft. It has been found that in addition to the radar absorbing properties, the nanotubes neither reflect nor scatter visible light, making it essentially invisible at night, much like painting current stealth aircraft black except much more effective. Current limitations in manufacturing, however, mean that current production of nanotube-coated aircraft is not possible. One theory to overcome these current limitations is to cover small particles with the nanotubes and suspend the nanotube-covered particles in a medium such as paint, which can then be applied to a surface, like a stealth aircraft.Bourzac, Katherine. "Nano Paint Could Make Airplanes Invisible to Radar." Technology Review. MIT, 5 December 2011.

Various methods have been employed for modifying fabrics using CNTs. Shim et al. produced intelligent e-textiles for Human Biomonitoring using a polyelectrolyte-based coating with CNTs.[tpl]cite doi|10.1021/nl801495p[/tpl] Additionally, Panhuis et al. dyed textile material by immersion in either a poly (2-methoxy aniline-5-sulfonic acid) PMAS polymer solution or PMAS-SWNT dispersion with enhanced conductivity and capacitance with a durable behavior.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.synthmet.2007.04.010[/tpl] In another study, Hu and coworkers coated single-walled carbon nanotubes with a simple “dipping and drying” process for wearable electronics and energy storage applications.[tpl]cite doi|10.1021/nl903949m[/tpl] CNTs have an aligned nanotube structure and a negative surface charge. Therefore, they have similar structures to direct dyes, so the exhaustion method is applied for coating and absorbing CNTs on the fiber surface for preparing multifunctional fabric including antibacterial, electric conductive, flame retardant and electromagnetic absorbance properties.F.

===Optical power detectors===

A spray-on mixture of carbon nanotubes and ceramic demonstrates unprecedented ability to resist damage while absorbing laser light. Such coatings that absorb as the energy of high-powered lasers without breaking down are essential for optical power detectors that measure the output of such lasers. These are used, for example, in military equipment for defusing unexploded mines. The composite consists of multiwall carbon nanotubes and a ceramic made of silicon, carbon and nitrogen. Including boron boosts the breakdown temperature. The nanotubes and graphene-like carbon transmit heat well, while the oxidation-resistant ceramic boosts damage resistance.
Creating the coating involves dispersing he nanotubes in toluene, to which a clear liquid polymer containing boron was added. The mixture was heated to [tpl]convert|1100| C|F[/tpl]. The result is crushed into a fine powder, dispersed again in toluene and sprayed in a thin coat on a copper surface.
The coating absorbed 97.5 percent of the light from a far-infrared laser and tolerated 15 kilowatts per square centimeter for 10 seconds. Damage tolerance is about 50 percent higher than for similar coatings, e.g., nanotubes alone and carbon paint.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/super-nanotubes-remarkable-spray-on-coating-combines-carbon-nanotubes-with-ceramic?utm_source=KurzweilAI+Daily+Newsletter&utm_campaign=055a5d11ed-UA-946742-1&utm_medium=email |title=Super-nanotubes: ‘remarkable’ spray-on coating combines carbon nanotubes with ceramic |publisher=KurzweilAI [/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1021/am302755x[/tpl]

===Loud speaker and earphone===

Carbon nanotubes have also been applied in the acoustics(such as loudspeaker and earphone). In 2008 it was shown that a sheet of nanotubes can operate as a loudspeaker if an alternating current is applied. The sound is not produced through vibration but thermoacoustically.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lin Xiao|coauthors=Zhuo Chen, Chen Feng, Liang Liu, Zai-Qiao Bai, Yang Wang, Li Qian, Yuying Zhang, Qunqing Li, Kaili Jiang and Shoushan Fan|title=Flexible, Stretchable, Transparent Carbon Nanotube Thin Film Loudspeakers|journal=Nano Letters|year=2008|volume=8|issue=12|pages=4539–4545|doi=10.1021/nl802750z|pmid=19367976|first1=Lin[/tpl]Hot nanotube sheets produce music on demand, New Scientists News, 31 October 2008

===Environmental remediation===

A CNT nano-structured sponge (nanosponge) containing sulfur and iron is more effective at soaking up water contaminants such as oil, fertilizers, pesticides and pharmaceuticals. Their magnetic properties make them easier to retrieve once the clean-up job is done. The sulfur and iron increases sponge size to around [tpl]convert|2|cm[/tpl]. It also increases porosity due to beneficial defects, creating buoyancy and reusability. Iron, in the form of ferrocene makes the structure easier to control and enables recovery using magnets. Such nanosponges increase the absorption of the toxic organic solvent dichlorobenzene from water by 3.5 times. The sponges can vegetable oil up to 150 times their initial weight and can absorb engine oil as well.http://www.gizmag.com/carbon-nanotube-sponges/30511[tpl]cite doi|10.1088/0957-4484/25/6/065701[/tpl]
Earlier, a magnetic boron-doped MWNT nanosponge that could absorb oil from water. The sponge was grown as a forest on a substrate via chemical vapor disposition. Boron puts kinks and elbows into the tubes as they grow and promotes the formation of covalent bonds. The nanosponges retain their elastic property after 10,000 compressions in the lab. The sponges are both superhydrophobic, forcing them to remain at the water's surface and oleophilic, drawing oil to them.Quick, Darren (17 April 2012) Reusable oil-absorbing nanosponges could soak up oil spills.

===Other applications===

Carbon nanotubes have been implemented in nanoelectromechanical systems, including mechanical memory elements (NRAM being developed by Nantero Inc.) and nanoscale electric motors (see Nanomotor or Nanotube nanomotor).
In May 2005, Nanomix Inc. placed on the market a hydrogen sensor that integrated carbon nanotubes on a silicon platform. Since then, Nanomix has been patenting many such sensor applications, such as in the field of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, glucose, DNA detection, etc.
Eikos Inc of Franklin, Massachusetts and Unidym Inc. of Silicon Valley, California are developing transparent, electrically conductive films of carbon nanotubes to replace indium tin oxide (ITO).

A flywheel made of carbon nanotubes could be spun at extremely high velocity on a floating magnetic axis in a vacuum, and potentially store energy at a density approaching that of conventional fossil fuels. Since energy can be added to and removed from flywheels very efficiently in the form of electricity, this might offer a way of storing electricity, making the electrical grid more efficient and variable power suppliers (like wind turbines) more useful in meeting energy needs. The practicality of this depends heavily upon the cost of making massive, unbroken nanotube structures, and their failure rate under stress.

==Discovery==

A 2006 editorial written by Marc Monthioux and Vladimir Kuznetsov in the journal Carbon described the interesting and often-misstated origin of the carbon nanotube. A large percentage of academic and popular literature attributes the discovery of hollow, nanometer-size tubes composed of graphitic carbon to Sumio Iijima of NEC in 1991.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Who should be given the credit for the discovery of carbon nanotubes?|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2006.03.019|first=Marc|last=Monthioux|journal=Carbon|volume=44|year=2006|url=http://www.cemes.fr/fichpdf/GuestEditorial.pdf |format=PDF|page=1621|last2=Kuznetsov|first2=V|issue=9[/tpl]
In 1952 L. V. Radushkevich and V. M. Lukyanovich published clear images of 50 nanometer diameter tubes made of carbon in the Soviet Journal of Physical Chemistry. This discovery was largely unnoticed, as the article was published in the Russian language, and Western scientists' access to Soviet press was limited during the Cold War. It is likely that carbon nanotubes were produced before this date, but the invention of the transmission electron microscope (TEM) allowed direct visualization of these structures.
Carbon nanotubes have been produced and observed under a variety of conditions prior to 1991. A paper by Oberlin, Endo, and Koyama published in 1976 clearly showed hollow carbon fibers with nanometer-scale diameters using a vapor-growth technique.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Filamentous growth of carbon through benzene decomposition|doi=10.1016/0022-0248(76)90115-9|first=A.|last=Oberlin|year=1976|volume=32|pages=335–349|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|issue=3|last2=Endo|first2=M.|last3=Koyama|first3=T.|bibcode = 1976JCrGr..32..335O [/tpl] Additionally, the authors show a TEM image of a nanotube consisting of a single wall of graphene.

In 1979, John Abrahamson presented evidence of carbon nanotubes at the 14th Biennial Conference of Carbon at Pennsylvania State University. The conference paper described carbon nanotubes as carbon fibers that were produced on carbon anodes during arc discharge. A characterization of these fibers was given as well as hypotheses for their growth in a nitrogen atmosphere at low pressures.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Structure of Carbon Fibers Found on Carbon Arc Anodes|journal=Carbon|volume=37|year=1999|page=1873|last=Abrahamson|first=John|last2=Wiles|first2=Peter G.|last3=Rhoades|first3=Brian L.|doi=10.1016/S0008-6223(99)00199-2|issue=11[/tpl]
In 1981, a group of Soviet scientists published the results of chemical and structural characterization of carbon nanoparticles produced by a thermocatalytical disproportionation of carbon monoxide. Using TEM images and XRD patterns, the authors suggested that their “carbon multi-layer tubular crystals” were formed by rolling graphene layers into cylinders. They speculated that by rolling graphene layers into a cylinder, many different arrangements of graphene hexagonal nets are possible. They suggested two possibilities of such arrangements: circular arrangement (armchair nanotube) and a spiral, helical arrangement (chiral tube).Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR, Metals. 1982, #3, pp.12–17 (in Russian)
In 1987, Howard G. Tennett of Hyperion Catalysis was issued a U.S. patent for the production of "cylindrical discrete carbon fibrils" with a "constant diameter between about 3.5 and about 70 nanometers..., length 102 times the diameter, and an outer region of multiple essentially continuous layers of ordered carbon atoms and a distinct inner core...."[tpl]Ref patent|country=US|number=4663230|title=Carbon fibrils, method for producing same and compositions containing same|gdate=1987-05-05|fdate=1984-12-06|invent1=Tennent, Howard G.[/tpl]

The arc discharge technique was well-known to produce the famed Buckminster fullerene on a preparative scale,[tpl]Cite journal|first=W.|last=Krätschmer|year=1990|title=Solid C60: a new form of carbon|journal=Nature|volume=347|pages=354–358|doi=10.1038/347354a0|last2=Lamb|first2=Lowell D.|last3=Fostiropoulos|first3=K.|last4=Huffman|first4=Donald R.|issue=6291|bibcode = 1990Natur.347..354K [/tpl] and these results appeared to extend the run of accidental discoveries relating to fullerenes. The original observation of fullerenes in mass spectrometry was not anticipated,[tpl]Cite journal|first=H.

The discovery of nanotubes remains a contentious issue. Many believe that Iijima's report in 1991 is of particular importance because it brought carbon nanotubes into the awareness of the scientific community as a whole.
