The London VeloPark (officially the Lee Valley VeloPark) is a cycling centre in Leyton in east London.
Lee Valley VeloPark will be owned and managed by Lee Valley Regional Park Authority. It will open to the public in early 2014.
It was one of the permanent venues for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
Lee Valley VeloPark is at the northern end of Olympic Park. It has a velodrome and BMX racing track, which have been used for the Games, as well as a one-mile (1.6 km) road course and a mountain bike track.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leevalleypark.org.uk/en/content/cms/olympics/velopark/velopark.aspx |title=Lee Valley Regional Park Authority – VeloPark |publisher=Leevalleypark.org.uk |date=12 June 2007 |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl] The park replaces the Eastway Cycle Circuit demolished to make way for it. The facilities built for the Olympics were constructed between 2009 and  2011. The first event in the Velopark was the London round of the 2011 UCI BMX Supercross World Cup series.

==London 2012 Games time==

During the London 2012 Games the Olympic and Paralympic track cycling competition was held in the Velodrome with the adjoining BMX track hosting the Olympic BMX competition. Team GB dominated the track cycling competition winning seven out of a possible ten gold medals plus one silver and one bronze.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnUqd1Fh2Gk The GB Paralympic track cycling team won a total of 15 medals, comprising five golds, seven silver and three bronze.

==Planning==

In February 2005 plans were announced for a £22 million VeloPark. Sport England would invest £10.5 million, Lee Valley Regional Park Authority £6 million and the Mayor of London and Transport for London would invest £3 million and £2.5 million respectively. The site was to be 34 hectares on the northern end of the proposed Olympic Park, next to the A12. The park would include a velodrome seating 1,500, which could be increased to 6,000 if London's bid for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games were successful. The site would also have an international competition BMX circuit, a BMX freestyle park, cyclo-cross/cross-country course mountain bike course and an outdoor cycle speedway track. The facilities would be used by internationals as well as those learning to ride. It was estimated that the park would attract 88,000 users a year, replacing the Eastway Cycle Circuit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press_releases_mayoral/plans-new-london-velopark-announced |title=Plans for new London VeloPark announced | Greater London Authority |publisher=London.gov.uk |date=16 February 2005 |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl]Report of the IOC Evaluation Commission on the London bid[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/cycling/4268623.stm |title= GB cycling gets new £22m complex |publisher= BBC Sport  |date=15 February 2005 |accessdate= 24 August 2012[/tpl] Eastway Cycle Circuit opened in 1975, it was the first purpose built road cycling venue in Britain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britishcycling.org.uk/50th-anni/article/bc-50-Years-Of-British-Cycling-News-The-70s |title=50 Years Of British Cycling – The Seventies |publisher=Britishcycling.org.uk |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl] The facility closed in September 2006 to make way for London's VeloPark.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lda.gov.uk/news-and-events/media-centre/press-releases/2006/hog-hill-proposed-for-new-eastway-cycle-circuit-location.aspx |title=Hog Hill proposed for new Eastway Cycle Circuit location – London Development Agency |publisher=Lda.gov.uk |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl] The velodrome is the third [tpl]convert|250|m|yd|abbr=on[/tpl] covered track in Great Britain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lcc.org.uk/articles/velodrome-and-velo-park-funding-confirmed |title=London Cycling Campaign |publisher=Lcc.org.uk |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl] In September 2008 plans for the VeloPark were revealed,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7603640.stm |title= Plans for 2012 VeloPark unveiled |publisher= BBC News |date=8 September 2008 |accessdate= 24 August 2012[/tpl] which were chosen with help from Chris Hoy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/6590669.stm |title= Hoy to help with Velopark design |publisher= BBC Sport  |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate= 24 August 2012[/tpl] However by March 2007, the VeloPark was revealed to be only a third of its original size, rescaled from 34 to 10 hectares.[tpl]cite web| author = Saini, Angela | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/03/07/eastway_cycle_feature.shtml |title= Shrinking Olympic legacy for cyclists |publisher= BBC  |accessdate= 24 August 2012[/tpl] The decrease in the size of the site led to users of the Eastway cycle circuit to protest to the Mayor of London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/03/19/eastway_cityhall_feature.shtml |title= Eastway Cycle group rides to City Hall |publisher= BBC  |date=19 March 2007 |accessdate= 24 August 2012[/tpl]
