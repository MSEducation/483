==Synopsis==

The story is set in the island of Ty Kern (which is, in real life, Belle-Île-en-Mer), an island off the coast of Brittany. Marie Kermeur, a young police lieutenant, returns to her home island to marry her childhood love, Christian Bréhat. In Ty Kern, four families are connected by ancient rivalries and secrets: the Kersaint, the Le Bihan, the Pérec and the Kermeur. But on the day before the wedding of Marie and Christian, strange events begin to happen. The bloody corpse of a seagull is brought in by the tide, Marie is assaulted by strange nightmares during the night, her brother Gildas is found dead, and the town's menhirs begin to bleed.
Aided by an inspector from the mainland, Lucas Fersen, Marie decides to clarify these strange phenomena. It is now that a series of deaths begin.
