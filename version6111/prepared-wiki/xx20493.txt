Star Destroyers are capital ships in the fictional Star Wars universe.  The Imperial Star Destroyer, which first appears in the first seconds of Star Wars (1977), is "the signature vessel of the Imperial fleet".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/technology/imperialstardestroyer|title=Star Wars: Databank: Imperial Star Destroyer|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=2011-12-22[/tpl] The term "Star Destroyer" also refers to other vessels in the Star Wars universe. Star Destroyers appear in the original three Star Wars movies and in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In addition to their movie appearances, Star Destroyers appear throughout the Star Wars Expanded Universe in books, comics, and games. Numerous Star Destroyer models and toys have been released.

==Imperial class==

The Star Destroyer first appears in the original Star Wars trilogy. In the 1977 film Star Wars, Han Solo refers to them as "Imperial cruisers".Star Wars: A New Hope script The term "Star Destroyer" is not used in dialogue until The Empire Strikes Back (1980).
In the original draft scripts of the movie that would become Star Wars, the term "Stardestroyer" refers to two-man fighters flown by what would become the Galactic Empire in later drafts. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) built a [tpl]convert|91|cm|adj=on|sp=us[/tpl] shooting model of the ship for A New Hope.

===Depiction===

An Imperial Star Destroyer first appears in the opening scene of A New Hope, chasing a Rebel ship. This appearance shows the Imperial ship's massive size in comparison to the Tantive IV.
Imperial-class Star Destroyers are constructed by Kuat Drive Yards and hold a distinguished place in the Imperial Navy, symbolizing the Empire's military might with a peak number of more than 25,000 vessels, though thousands were lost/destroyed to warlordism following Palpatine's death. The Imperial-class Star Destroyer is also informally referred to as an Imperial cruiser. Like the Victory- and Venator-class ships that precede it, the Imperial Star Destroyer is most notable for its massive size and overwhelming firepower; a single Imperial-class ship is capable of overwhelming most starships or devastating a hostile planet, and its mere presence is often enough to deter rebellion. At [tpl]convert|1600|m|sp=us[/tpl] long, Imperial-class Star Destroyers are armed with turbolasers, ion cannons and tractor beam projectors. They carry 72 TIE fighters, numerous ground forces (including stormtroopers, 20 AT-ATs and 30 AT-STs), a prefabricated base for rapid deployment to planetary surfaces and a variety of support and landing craft.
Following the climactic Battle of Endor, the Rebel Alliance captured several Imperial-class ships and added them to their own fleet. As the Rebel Alliance transitioned into the New Republic and gradually took large portions of the galaxy from the remnants of the Empire, it was able to procure more of the powerful ships as well as the vital shipyards and facilities with which to operate them.[tpl]cite book|title=The New Jedi Order Sourcebook|last=Wiker|first=J.D.|coauthors=Steve Miller|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|isbn=0-7869-2777-1[/tpl] Although the New Republic eventually upgrades its starfleet with newer ship types, the Imperial-class Star Destroyer remains in service well into the New Jedi Order era and fights during the Yuuzhan Vong war.

==Super Star Destroyer==

Super Star Destroyers ("SSD" or "Super-class Star Destroyers") are gargantuan vessels that dwarf even the standard Imperial-class Star Destroyers.Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/superstardestroyer/index.html|title=Star Wars: Databank: Super Star Destroyer|accessdate=2008-11-05|publisher=Lucasfilm[/tpl] The shooting model for the Super Star Destroyer Executor in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi was [tpl]convert|282|cm|sp=us[/tpl] long.

Kevin J. Anderson's novel Darksaber describes a Super Star Destroyer as being "worth twenty Imperial Star Destroyers".[tpl]cite book|author=Anderson, Kevin J.|authorlink=Kevin J. Anderson|year=1996|title=Darksaber|publisher=Bantam Spectra|isbn=0-553-57611-9|pages=155â€“156[/tpl] The Executor is Darth Vader's (David Prowse, James Earl Jones) flagship in The Empire Strikes Back and is the Imperial command ship at the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi. Admiral Ozzel (Michael Sheard) commands the Executor at the beginning of The Empire Strikes Back, with command shifting to Admiral Piett (Kenneth Colley) later in the movie and persisting through Return of the Jedi. During the Battle of Endor, a crippled A-wing piloted by Arvel Crynyd (Hilton McRae) crashes into the ship's bridge, causing the Executor to crash into the second Death Star and explode.
Roleplaying material identifies the Executor as the first of the Executor class, while starwars.com identifies it as the first of the Super class.[tpl]cite book | last=Gorden | first=Greg |title=Star Wars Imperial Sourcebook |edition=2nd edition | publisher=West End Games| year=1993 | isbn=0-87431-210-8[/tpl] Wizards of the Coast explains that the "Super class" label was used to hide the ship's "true nature from the Imperial Senate"; this bureaucratic fiction became the source of the type's nickname.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=starwars/article/SBPreview1|title=Starship Battles Preview 1|date=2006-10-19|accessdate=2007-07-12|publisher=Wizards of the Coast[/tpl] Originally described in A Guide to the Star Wars Universe in 1984 as being [tpl]convert|8|km|sp=us[/tpl] long, Executor-class ships were later described as being [tpl]convert|19|km|sp=us[/tpl] long.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20060309jc84|title=Jedi Counseling 84|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|accessdate=2007-07-15|first=Gary M.|last=Sarli|authorlink=Gary M.

==Other types==

Venator-class Star Destroyers, also known as "Republic attack cruisers", appear in Revenge of the Sith and in the Expanded Universe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/republicattackcruiser/index.html|title=Star Wars: Databank: Republic attack cruiser|accessdate=2008-11-05|publisher=Lucasfilm[/tpl] The ship's design is meant to bridge the appearance of the Acclamator-class transports in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and the Imperial class in the original trilogy. While the ships first appear with a red and grey Republic color scheme, the Venator at the movie's end is gray and white; this lack of color signifies the Empire's rise to power.
Victory-class Star Destroyers appear as early as Brian Daley's 1979 book Han Solo's Revenge, and since then have appeared in Expanded Universe books and games.[tpl]cite book|title=Han Solo's Revenge|series=Han Solo Adventures|last=Daley|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Daley|date=1979-10-12|isbn=0-345-28475-5|publisher=Del Rey[/tpl] Designed by Rendili StarDrive in the Star Wars universe, the Victory-class is [tpl]convert|900|m|sp=us[/tpl] long and features fewer weapons and less cargo space than an Imperial Star Destroyer.

The ship is destroyed when Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa Solo combine Force abilities to cause Palpatine's Force Storms to go out of control and destroy the vessel. The Eclipse II serves as Palpatine's flagship until it is destroyed in Empire's End. A scaled-down version of the Eclipse, the Sovereign class, is featured in Expanded Universe material from the same time period.

The Super Star Destroyer has also been merchandised. Kenner wanted to use a less ominous name than Executor for the toy playset of Darth Vader's meditation chamber. An advertisement agency's list of 153 alternatives included Starbase Malevolent, Black Coven, Haphaestus VII, and Cosmocurse; ultimately, the toy was labeled "Darth Vader's Star Destroyer". In 2006, Wizards of the Coast created an Executor miniature as part of its Star Wars Miniatures Starship Battles game. An electronic Super Star Destroyer toy released by Hasbro "is the rarest among Hasbro's Collector Fleet".[tpl]cite web|url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/11709|title=Star Wars: Cargo Bay â€“ Electronic Super Star Destroyer|accessdate=2007-07-15|publisher=Lucasfilm[/tpl]
