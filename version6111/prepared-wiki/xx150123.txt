The HMS Bands have received numerous awards for University Interscholastic League, DC State Festival, Choice Music Events, and have had high amounts of students admitted into the Region 26 Band and Orchestra. In addition, the Honors Band was invited to perform at the Western International Band Clinic in the 2008-2009 year. That same year, they submitted a recording to the Texas Music Educators Association, where they were selected to perform as the TMEA Class CCC Honor Band. Inspired by their successes, the band submitted a recording to the Midwest Clinic, where they were one of three middle schools; all were selected from the Austin area along with Kealing Middle School, and West Ridge Middle School. They performed their concert on December 17, 2010 in Chicago. Minutes after, the band was informed that they had been awarded the The Sudler Silver Cup, a prestigious award based on the demonstration of high excellence and skill over a period of seven years. The level of excellence demanded is so high that in past years no school was deemed suitable. The Sudler Cup concert took place on June 1, 2011. In a speech after the concert, the mayor of Cedar Park declared June 1 "Henry Middle School Band Day", in honor of the spectacular band program.  In December 2012, the Henry Middle School Trombone Ensemble was invited to perform at the 66th annual Midwest Band & Orchestra Clinic.  The HMS Band Program is under the direction of Robert Herrings, Ryan Straten, Rachel Lynn, Hector Gil and former directors Cara Vernon and Steven Hopkins.  For the year 2013-14, the Honors Band was again invited to the Western International Band Clinic (WIBC) in Seattle, Washington in November 2013, as well as to San Antonio for their second TMEA Class CCC Honors Band title in February 2014.
