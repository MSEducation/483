[[Acorn Archimedes]]

CATEGORIES: ARM-based home computers, Home computers, Personal computers, ARM architecture

The Acorn Archimedes was Acorn Computers' first general purpose home computer to be based on their own ARM architecture.
Using a RISC design with a 32-bit CPU (26-bit addressing), at its launch in June 1987, the Archimedes was stated as running at 4 MIPS, with a claim of 18 MIPS during tests.[tpl]cite news | first = Ray | last = Hammond | title = 'Fastest' micro in the world | date = 1987-06-18 | work = New Scientist | page = 41[/tpl]
The name is commonly used to describe any of Acorn's contemporary designs based on the same architecture, even where Acorn did not include Archimedes in the official name.

==Description and history==

===Early models[tpl]anchor|A300|A310[/tpl]===

The first models were released in June 1987, as the 300 and 400 series. The 400 series included 4 expansion slots (although a two slot backplane could be added to the 300 series as an official upgrade, and third parties produced their own 4 slot backplanes) and an ST506 controller for an internal hard drive. Both models included the Arthur operating system operating system (later replaced by RISC OS as a paid-for upgrade), BBC BASIC programming language and an emulator for Acorn's earlier BBC Micro, and were mounted in two-part cases with a small central unit, monitor on top, and a separate keyboard and three-button mouse.  All models featured onboard 8 channel stereo sound and were capable of displaying 256 colours on screen.Acorn Archimedes Promotion from 1987
Four models were initially released with different amounts of memory, the A305, A310, A410 and A440. The 540 was unveiled in September 1990, and included higher speed SCSI and provision for connecting Genlock devices.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.apdl.co.uk/riscworld/volume9/issue2/blast20/index.htm | title = The RISC OS Time Machine — A £3000 computer | accessdate = 2011-06-08 | last = Williams | first = Mike |author2= Wrigley, Alan | date = November 1990 | work = RISC User | publisher = RISC User| quote = ... further differences, one of major importance. This is the SCSI connector on the rear of the SCSI interface card ... Internally, provision has also been made for Genlock and similar video digitiser boards to be connected directly into the Archimedes. [/tpl] The 300 and 400 were followed by a number of machines with minor changes and upgrades:

===A3000 and A5000===

Work began on a successor to the Arthur operating system. Initially named Arthur 2, it was renamed to RISC OS 2.  New computers were shipped with it pre-installed. A number of new machines were introduced along with RISC OS 2 and in May 1989, the 300 series was phased out in favour of the new Acorn A3000 (the 400 series was kept in production).  Earlier models which shipped with Arthur could be upgraded to RISC OS 2 by replacing the ROM chips containing the operating system.
The A3000 used an 8 MHz ARM2 and was supplied with [tpl]nowrap|1 MB[/tpl] of RAM.  Unlike the previous models, the A3000 came in a single-part case similar to the BBC Micro, Amiga 500 and Atari ST computers, with the keyboard integrated in the base unit. This kind of housing consumes a lot of desktop space, a problem that Acorn tried to overcome by offering a monitor stand that attached to the base unit.Fred Harris Introduces the Acorn Archimedes BBC A3000 Part 1 The new model sported only a single internal expansion slot, which was physically different from that of the earlier models, although electronically similar. An external connector could interface to existing expansion cards, although they really needed to be housed in an external case joined to the main unit.
A300 series, A400 series, R140 and A3000 machines had the VIDC1a video chip, which provided a wide variety of screen resolutions:
The palette range was 4096 colours (12-bit) and the VIDC1a had 16 hardware palette registers. This meant that in screen modes with sixteen colours or fewer, the colours could be mapped to any of the 4096 available. However, in 256 colour modes, 4 bits of the colour data were hardware derived and could not be adjusted. The net result was 256 colours, but only 16 of them could be assigned as desired, covering a range of the 4096 available colours.Riscos : Specifications of Legacy RISC OS machines It also had no Horizontal sync interrupt, meaning that it was difficult to display additional colours by changing the palette for each scan line, but not impossible, thanks to the 2 MHz IOC timer 1.IOC Timer / IRQs - comp.sys.acorn.programmer | Google Groups Many demos managed to display 4096 colour on screen or more with dithering ftp://arcade.demon.co.uk/flist.txt It had also one hardware sprite, with 32 pixels width and unlimited height, where each pixel is coded on 2 bits: value 0 is for transparency, and the 3 others are freely chosen from the 4096 colour palette.Retro Treasures: Acorn Archimedes A3000RISC OS News, Software and Information
In 1991, the A5000 was launched. It featured the new 25 MHz ARM3 processor, 2 or 4 MB of RAM, either a 40 MB or an 80 MB hard drive and a more conventional 2U rack pizza box-style two-part case (HxWxD: 100 x 430 x 340 mm [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.classicacorn.freeuk.com/32bit_machine_spec/a5000_spec/a5000_spec.html |title=A5000 Spec's |publisher=Classicacorn.freeuk.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13[/tpl]). Its enhanced video capabilities allowed the A5000 to comfortably display VGA resolutions of up to 800×600 pixels. It was the first Archimedes to feature a High Density capable floppy disc drive as standard. This natively supported various formats including DOS and Atari discs. A later version of the A5000 featured a 33 MHz ARM3, 4 or 8 MB of RAM, an 80 or 120 MB hard drive.
The A5000 initially ran the new 3.0 version of RISC OS, although several bugs were identified; most were shipped with RISC OS 3.10 or 3.11. As before, earlier machines were capable of being upgraded to the new RISC OS 3, though some needed an additional daughterboard installing,[tpl]cite web|url=http://acorn.chriswhy.co.uk/32bit_Upgrades/Simtec_ROS3_ROMCarrier.html |title=Chris's Acorns: 32bit Upgrades & Expansions by company |publisher=Acorn.chriswhy.co.uk |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2011-06-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110718090744/http://acorn.chriswhy.co.uk/32bit_Upgrades/Simtec_ROS3_ROMCarrier.html| archivedate= 18 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] as well as the ARM3 CPU.[tpl]cite web|url=http://acorn.chriswhy.co.uk/32bit_Upgrades/Simtec_ARM3FPA.html |title=Chris's Acorns: 32bit Upgrades & Expansions by company |publisher=Acorn.chriswhy.co.uk |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2011-06-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110718090816/http://acorn.chriswhy.co.uk/32bit_Upgrades/Simtec_ARM3FPA.html| archivedate= 18 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Earlier models could also benefit from the video performance of the A5000 via a third party upgrade.[tpl]cite web|url=http://acorn.chriswhy.co.uk/32bit_Upgrades/CC_ColourcardGold.html |title=Chris's Acorns: 32bit Upgrades & Expansions by company |publisher=Acorn.chriswhy.co.uk |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2011-06-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110718090905/http://acorn.chriswhy.co.uk/32bit_Upgrades/CC_ColourcardGold.html| archivedate= 18 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===New range and a laptop===

In 1992, a new range was produced, the first ARM macrocell: the ARM250 microprocessor, a single-chip design including an ARM3 chip without cache, and the IOC1 (Input Output Controller), VIDC1a (VIDeo and sound Controller) and MEMC1 (MEMory Controller) chips all integrated into one chip. The increase in clock frequency, from 8 MHz to 12 MHz, gave a performance of 7 MIPS. They run RISC OS 3.10.  The A30x0 series had a one-piece design, similar to the A3000 but far smaller, while the A4000 looked like a slightly slimmer A5000. The A3010 model was intended to be a home computing machine, featuring a TV modulator and joystick ports, while the A3020 targeted the home office and educational markets, featuring a built-in 2.5" hard drive and a dedicated network interface socket. Technically, the A4000 was almost identical to the A3020, only differing in hard disk size (3.5-inch in the A4000), though it sported a different appearance. All three ARM250-based machines could be upgraded to 4 MB with plug-in chips (though the A3010 was designed for 2 MB, third party upgrades overcame this) and one "mini-podule" slot as used for internal expansion in the A3000.
Also in 1992, Acorn introduced a laptop computer called A4 that featured an ARM3 processor like the A5000, even though it had a slightly lower clock speed, and a LCD screen capable of displaying a maximum resolution of [tpl]nowrap|640 × 480 pixels[/tpl] in 15 levels of grey. However, it did feature a monitor port which offered the same display capabilities as an A5000. A notable omission from the machine was a built-in pointing device, requiring users to navigate with the cursor keys or attach a conventional Acorn three-button mouse.Announcing Acorn's A4 Portable - "... a quart in a pint pot"
The A7000, despite its name being reminiscent of the Archimedes naming conventions, was actually more similar to the Risc PC, the line of RISC OS computers that succeeded the Archimedes in 1994.  It lacked, however, the DEBI expansion slots and multi-slice case that characterized the RiscPC (though by removing the CDROM, a backplane with one slot could be fitted).

==Significance and impact==

The Archimedes was one of the most powerful home computers available during the late 1980s and early 1990s; its main CPU was faster than the Motorola 68000 microprocessors found in the more popular Commodore Amiga and Atari ST machines.  An [tpl]nowrap|8 MHz[/tpl] 68000 had an average performance of roughly [tpl]nowrap|1 MIPS[/tpl] for 16-bit workloads and [tpl]nowrap|0.5 MIPS[/tpl] for 32-bit workloads, with peak performance of [tpl]nowrap|2 MIPS[/tpl] for simpler 16-bit instructions. The [tpl]nowrap|8 MHz[/tpl] ARM2 yielded [tpl]nowrap|4.5 - 4.8 MIPS[/tpl] for 32-bit workloads in repeatable benchmark tests.[tpl]cite web|url=http://acorn.chriswhy.co.uk/Performance.html |title=Chris's Acorns - RISC OS Performance Page |publisher=Acorn.chriswhy.co.uk |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2011-06-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110718091050/http://acorn.chriswhy.co.uk/Performance.html| archivedate= 18 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The computer was exhibited at the 1987 Personal Computer World Show, along with Amigas, Atari STs and video game consoles. Commenting on the show, Crash magazine reported that "despite whiz-bang demos of Acorn’s Archimedes" the 8-bit machines were not dead.[tpl]cite news | title = News from the PCW Show| date = November 1987 | publisher = Newsfield Publications | url = http://www.crashonline.org.uk/46/pcw_software.htm | work = Crash | accessdate = 2011-07-12 | quote = Despite the number of STs and Amigas demonstrating titles at the show, despite whiz-bang demos of Acorn’s Archimedes, and despite the undeniable interest shown in the games machines, The PCW Show indicated to me that it’s a bit early to announce the death of the 8-bit machines.| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110606124655/http://www.crashonline.org.uk/46/pcw_software.htm| archivedate= 6 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The Archimedes won significant market share in the education markets of the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand; the success of the Archimedes in British schools was due partly to its predecessor the BBC Micro and later to the Computers for Schools scheme organised by the Tesco supermarket chain in association with Acorn, and most students and pupils in these countries in the early 90s were exposed to an Archimedes or A-series computer. The Archimedes range was available in the US and Canada via Olivetti Canada.[tpl]Cite newsgroup | title = Acorn Micros? | author = Roger Wilson | date = April 10, 1990 | newsgroup = comp.misc | id = 5357@ucrmath.UCR.EDU | url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.misc/msg/98372d46016a52b8 | accessdate = June 14, 2011[/tpl]
By the early 1990s, the UK educational market began to turn away from the Archimedes. Apple Macintosh computers or IBM compatible PCs eclipsed the Archimedes in their multimedia capabilities, which led to an erosion of the Archimedes market share. The Tesco Computers for Schools scheme later changed partnership from Acorn to RM plc and many other computer-related suppliers, which also led to the decrease of the Archimedes' educational market share.
