International CES, more commonly known as the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), is an internationally renowned electronics and technology trade show, attracting major companies and industry professionals worldwide. The annual show is held each January at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.  Not open to the public, the Consumer Electronics Association-sponsored show typically hosts previews of products and new product announcements.  CES rose to prominence after a rival show, COMDEX, was canceled.

==History==

The first CES was held in June 1967 in New York City. It was a spinoff from the Chicago Music Show, which until then had served as the main event for exhibiting consumer electronics.  The event had 17,500 attendees and over 100 exhibitors; the kickoff speaker was Motorola chairman Bob Galvin.First CES Goes Broadway in June 1967, Bob Gerson, TWICE, August 28, 2006 From 1978 to 1994, CES was held twice each year: once in January in Las Vegas known as Winter Consumer Electronics Show (WCES) and once in June in Chicago, known as Summer Consumer Electronics Show (SCES).
The winter show was successfully held in Las Vegas in 1995 as planned.  However, since the summer Chicago shows were beginning to lose popularity, the organizers decided to experiment by having the show travel around to different cities starting in 1995 with a planned show in Philadelphia at the Pennsylvania Convention Center.  However, the inaugural E3 gaming show was scheduled to be held on the West Coast that same weekend and many exhibitors protested, causing the Philly Summer CES show to be cancelled.  The 1996 Winter show was again held in Las Vegas in January, followed by a Summer show this time in Orlando, Florida, however only a fraction of the traditional exhibitors participated.  Again, the 1997 Winter show in Las Vegas was very successful.  The next "Summer" show was scheduled to be held in conjunction with Spring COMDEX in Atlanta, however when only two dozen-or-so exhibitors signed on, the CES portion of the show was cancelled.
In 1998, the show changed to a once-a-year format with Las Vegas as the location.  In Las Vegas, the show is one of the largest (the other being CONEXPO-CON/AGG), taking up to 18 days to set up, run and break down."Grandest Gadgets", Las Vegas Review-Journal, Page A1, January 6, 2007.

===2007===

In a break from recent tradition, the 2007 CES event did not begin on a Thursday, nor span a weekend.  It ran from Monday January 8 to Thursday January 11, 2007. The venues also changed slightly, with the high-performance audio and home theater expo moving from the Alexis Park venue to The Venetian. The remaining venues were the same as previous years: the Las Vegas Convention Center was the center of events, with the adjacent Las Vegas Hilton, and the Sands Expo and Convention Center hosting satellite exhibitions.
The location for the main keynotes was the other major change for 2007.  Previously held at the Las Vegas Hilton's Main Theater, they staged for the first time at The Palazzo Ballroom in The Venetian. Bill Gates gave his ninth pre-show keynote address on the Sunday evening. The opening keynote was presented by Gary Shapiro (President/CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, which hosts the event), with Ed Zander, Chairman/CEO of Motorola. Other keynote speakers scheduled included Robert Iger from The Walt Disney Company, Michael Dell, founder of Dell Inc., and Leslie Moonves of CBS.
Finally, Industry Insider presentations moved to the Las Vegas Hilton, with contributions from Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, CEO of Nokia and John Chambers, CEO of Cisco.
In the gaming section for Windows Vista and DirectX 10, there were two games shown: Age of Conan and Crysis.

===2008===

The 2008 exhibition was from January 7 through January 10, 2008 in Las Vegas with 141,150 attendees. Bill Gates gave the keynote speech, in which he formally announced his retirement from his day-to-day duties at Microsoft. Along with the announcement, he presented a lengthy comedy skit on what his last day with Microsoft would be like, complete with cameos from celebrities including Jay-Z, Steven Spielberg, Barack Obama, Hillary Rodham Clinton and many others. Industry names such as Consumer Priority Service also made an appearance among others in the retail sector.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22578289/ |title=Attention, CES: Your stuff breaks  |publisher=msnbc.msn.com[/tpl]

Laser diodes were unveiled at the CES Show that are going to be used for high beam headlights in Audi vehicles. The high beams will be lasers, though the low beams will be light-emitting diodes. The car maker says that their high beams have a 500-meter range, which is roughly twice the distance of LED high beams. Lasers are expensive though. Lasers are smaller, brighter and more energy efficient than LED headlamps. Their laser headlamps use less than half the energy of LEDs. Laser diodes can emit 170 lumens per watt, while LEDs generate only 100 lumens. Lasers are sensitive to heat but that has not stopped their production for vehicles. Laser technology is not as advanced compared with LEDs, which have been around for decades.BMW, Audi will introduce laser headlamps this year, Automotive News Europe, 7 January 2014, David Sedgwick

=="Booth babes" controversy==

Part of the press, like the BBC and The Verge, ran stories (in 2012–2014) about the alleged unsuitable presence of "booth babes" (scantily dressed glamor models) at the show.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20957848 |title=BBC News - CES 2013: Booth babe debate returns |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-01-09 |accessdate=2014-01-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author= Adrianne Jeffries |url=http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/10/5294440/why-cant-ces-quit-booth-babes |title=Why can't CES quit booth babes? |publisher=The Verge |date=2013-09-30 |accessdate=2014-01-13[/tpl] Other publications, like PC Magazine, although aware of the controversy relished however in publishing galleries of booth babes without negative commentary.[tpl]cite web|last=Colon |first=Alex |url=http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/306862/our-favorite-booth-babes-at-ces-2013 |title=Our Favorite Booth Babes at CES 2013 - Slideshow from |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2013-01-10 |accessdate=2014-01-13[/tpl]http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2429419,00.asp In 2013, CES organizers released statements in which they claimed that enforcing business casual attire for the exhibitor personnel would be impractical and would detract CES staff on the ground from their main focus of providing security.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2242820/ces-keeps-the-booth-babe |title=CES keeps the booth babe |publisher=The Inquirer |date=2013-02-11 |accessdate=2014-01-13[/tpl]
In a background story in The Wire, Rebecca Greenfield wrote that "booth babes" were initially called "CES Guides" and they "date back to the beginning of the Consumer Electronics Show" (1967) and that "they've been the subject of controversy and nerd fantasy alike". According to Greenfield's research, the first use of the term "booth babe" appeared in a Toronto Star article covering the 1986 CES. She also writes that the "scantily clad" attire "became norm" at CES in the 1970-1980 decade, in synchrony with similar developments in the auto show industry. Greenfield also remarks that complaints about booth babes at CES are not entirely new; she points out for example that Network World "wrote a few separate times that it was flat-out tired of booth babes — not because of the sexism so much as the predictability." For example, in 1999, Network World's Dave Breuger criticized the practice of employing spokesmodels, "most of whom wouldn't know an ATM module if it bit them on their overexposed games." Greenfield notes that other electronics shows like E3 have adopted a similar practice of encouraging "booth babes" in the late 1990s, but abandoned it in 2006 after outcry, with E3 organizers later threatening to fine any exhibitor for "nudity, partial nudity, and bathing-suit bottoms".http://www.thewire.com/technology/2013/01/ces-booth-babes-history/60619/
