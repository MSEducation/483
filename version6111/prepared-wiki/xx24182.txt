==History==

===Inspiration===

The inspiration for the comic strip came from Dennis Ketcham, the real life son of Hank Ketcham,[tpl]cite news | last = Weinraub| first = Judith| title = Dennis's' Dear Old Dad| publisher = The Washington Post| date = May 5, 1990| url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72586949.html?dids=72586949:72586949&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=MAY+05%2C+1990&author=Judith+Weinraub&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=Dennis's'+Dear+Old+Dad%3BCartoonist+Hank+Ketcham%2C+In+a+World+Without+Menace&pqatl=google[/tpl] who was only four years old when he refused to take a nap and somehow messed up his whole room. Hank tried many possible names for the character, and translated them into rough pencil sketches. But when his studio door flew open and his then-wife Alice, in utter exasperation, exclaimed, "Your son is a menace!",[tpl]cite news | last = Van Gelder| first = Lawrence| title = Hank Ketcham, Father of Dennis the Menace, Dies at 81| publisher = The New York Times| date = June 2, 2001| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9B01E4D8163FF931A35755C0A9679C8B63&n=Top/News/Business/Companies/Google%20Inc.| accessdate = 2007-09-17[/tpl] the "Dennis the Menace" name stuck. The character of Henry Mitchell bore a striking resemblance to Ketcham. The Mitchell family of Dennis, Hank/Henry and Alice were all named after the Ketchams.

===Visuals===

Ketcham's line work has been highly praised over the years. A review on comicbookbin.com states:
"...a growing legion of cartoonists, scholars, aficionados, etc. have come to appreciate the artistry of Dennis’s creator, Hank Ketcham.  Ketcham’s beautiful artwork defines cartooning elegance.  The design, the composition, and the line:  it’s all too, too beautiful."[tpl]cite news | last = Douresseaux| first = Leroy| title = Hank Ketcham's Complete Dennis the Menace: 1953–1954 (review)| publisher = comicbookbin.com| date = August 20, 2007| url = http://www.comicbookbin.com/completedennisthemenace002.html| accessdate = 2008-12-21[/tpl] AV Club reviewer Noel Murray wrote: "Ketcham also experimented with his line a little early on, tightening and thickening without losing the looseness and spontaneity that remains the strip's best aspect even now."[tpl]cite news | last = Murray| first = Noel| title = Hank Ketcham's Complete Dennis The Menace 1951–1952 (review)| publisher = The Onion's avlub.com | date = September 28, 2005| url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/41135| accessdate = 2008-12-21[/tpl]
In 2005, Dennis appeared as a guest for Blondie and Dagwood's 75th anniversary party in the comic strip Blondie.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chron.com/apps/comics/showComick.mpl?week=1&date=20050904&name=Blondie |title=Comics and cartoons | Chron.com – Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date=September 4, 2005 |accessdate=2010-04-30[/tpl]

===UK Dennis the Menace===

Coincidentally, another cartoon strip titled Dennis the Menace was published in the British comic The Beano (dated March 17 – the "off sale" date) in 1951. The comic went on sale several days in advance of the cover date (actually being published up to ten days previously), and therefore predates the debut of Ketcham's version.http://www.cracked.com/article_18788_the-5-most-mind-blowing-coincidences-all-time.html The UK Dennis is quite different in appearance and character, characterized by his red-and-black striped jersey, his dog Gnasher, and his gang of friends. Like the American character, the UK one remains popular to this day and has made the transition to television cartoons. Ketcham's comic strip was dubbed Just Dennis or The Pickle there to avoid confusion with the native UK version of Dennis the Menace.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] The television version screened in the UK simply as Dennis. The UK comic strip was briefly renamed Dennis and Gnasher but has returned to being called Dennis the Menace and Gnasher.

===Ketcham retires===

Hank Ketcham retired from the comic strip in 1994, turning the production of the strip over to his assistants Ron Ferdinand and Marcus Hamilton. They continued it as a "zombie strip" after Ketcham's death in 2001, and they still produce it to this day.

==Advertising==

Dennis the Menace appeared in A&W Restaurants advertising in the 1960s, then Dairy Queen marketing from 1971 until 2001, when he was dropped because Dairy Queen felt children could no longer relate to him. Dennis also appeared in the Sears Roebuck Wish Book Christmas catalog in the 1970s.

==Comic books==

Dennis the Menace has been published in comic books and comic digests from the 1950s through the 1980s by a variety of publishers, including Standard/Pines (1953–58), Fawcett Comics (1958–80, during their only return to comics after losing the Captain Marvel lawsuit), and Marvel Comics (1981–82). These included both newspaper strip reprints and original Dennis the Menace comic book stories, produced by others besides Ketcham. Al Wiseman, one of Ketcham's assistants in the 1950s and 60s, worked on many of them. Ron Ferdinand, Ketcham's Sunday page artist, drew several of the Dennis stories in the Marvel books, including the cover for issue No. 11.

===Giant series===

The main comic book series (simply named Dennis the Menace) ran in tandem with the "Giant" series. The Dennis the Menace Giant Vacation Special[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=11130 |title=The Grand Comics Database (GCD) |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-30[/tpl] and Dennis the Menace Christmas Issue[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=11248 |title=The Grand Comics Database (GCD) |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-30[/tpl] were published by Standard in 1955. Those issues inaugurated the Giants series, which was published by Pines for issues 2–6,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=11131 |title=The Grand Comics Database (GCD) |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-30[/tpl] and continued by Hallden/Fawcett for issues 6–75.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=11132 |title=The Grand Comics Database (GCD) |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-30[/tpl] The Giant series was later renamed the Dennis the Menace Bonus Magazine Series, which started with issue No. 76 in 1970.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=11133 |title=The Grand Comics Database (GCD) |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-30[/tpl] CBS and Hallden later retitled the series as The Dennis the Menace Big Bonus Series, which it ran through issue #194 in October 1979.

===Other series===

By October 1979, Fawcett began publishing a separate series of 36 issues entitled Dennis the Menace and Mr. Wilson. By the second issue, the Dennis and Mr. Wilson series was re-christened Dennis the Menace and His Friends which now involved Dennis, Mr. Wilson and friends, Joey, Margaret and dog, Ruff. Because of this, the Mr. Wilson stories were alternated with the three characters as Ruff, Joey and Margaret who each shared a No. 1 issue with Dennis.
There were also other series of Dennis the Menace comic books published in 1961, first there was Dennis the Menace and His Dog, Ruff and Dennis the Menace and His Pal, Joey published the summer and the last but not least was Dennis the Menace and Margaret published in the winter of 1969.
In 1972, as part of a bonus magazine series Fawcett published a "Short Stuff Special" where Dennis visited Children's Fairyland in Oakland, California.

===Bible kids series===

In 1977, Word Books, Inc. commissioned Hank Ketcham Enterprises, Inc. to produce a series of ten comic books under the title Dennis and the Bible Kids, with the usual cast of characters reading (and sometimes partly acting out) the stories of Joseph, Moses, David, Esther, Jesus, and other Biblical characters. These were sold through Christian bookstores and related outlets. Each issue contained several inspirational renderings by Hank Ketcham himself.

===Marvel series===

The Dennis the Menace Fun Fest and the Dennis the Menace Big Bonus Series were revived for a short issue run in 1980:
After this revival series, the Hallden and CBS comics run came to an end in 1980. Ketcham had half of the comic book rights purchased by Stan Lee and Marvel Comics, so they were able to produce a new series of Dennis the Menace comic books. The new Marvel series started in December 1981 and ended in November 1982. The smaller Dennis the Menace comic digests were published continually by Fawcett and Hallden between 1969 and 1980, and they were briefly resurrected in reprints by Marvel in 1982 for a run of three issues.

===="Spider-Kid"====

The seventh issue featured a Spider-Man spoof called “Spider-Kid”. The story featured Dennis arriving at Margaret's Valentine's Day party dressed as a pint-sized Spider-Man when asked to come to the party dressed as a "Romantic Hero".This description comes from a copy of this comic that this editor personally owns in his collection. The cover showed Dennis as Spider-Kid jumping from a cloud and unmasking himself.
