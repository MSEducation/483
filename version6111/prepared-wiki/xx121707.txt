The first and only single from the EP was "Final Frontier". The single contains sample from "Crossfire" by The Crusaders, "Flash Light" by Parliament, "The Bridge Is Over" by Boogie Down Productions and "The Dayz of Wayback" by N.W.A. It was released on September 14, 1992 and was produced by Bobby "Bobcat" Ervin. Though the song was only a minor success, making it to 80 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and 17 on the Hot Rap Singles, it has arguably become MC Ren's most well known song.

==Release and reception==

Kizz My Black Azz charted without the support of a lead single or video, although the track Final Frontier would later be released as a single and get a music video. The EP peaked number twelve on Billboard 200, with first week sales of 342,000 copies. With very limited promotion, and almost no airplay, the EP was certified Platinum only two months after it's release.
