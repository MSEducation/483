North Dakota [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-North Dakota.ogg|ˌ|n|ɔr|θ|_|d|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ|t|ə[/tpl] is the 39th state of the United States, having been admitted to the union on November 2, 1889.
It is located in the Upper Midwestern region of the United States, bordered by the Canadian provinces  of Saskatchewan and Manitoba to the north, the states of Minnesota to the east, South Dakota to the south, and Montana to the west.Geography of North Dakota – netstate.com. Retrieved July 21, 2011. The state capitol is located in Bismarck and the largest city is Fargo.  Currently, North Dakota is the 19th most extensive but the 3rd least populous and the 4th least densely populated of the 50 United States.
The primary public universities are located in Grand Forks and Fargo. The U.S. Air Force operates air bases near Minot and Grand Forks.
North Dakota has weathered the Great Recession with a boom in natural resources, particularly a boom in oil extraction from the Bakken formation, which lies beneath the western part of the state.[tpl]cite news |first= Brian |last= Shactman |url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/story/2011-08-27/Unemployed-Go-to-North-Dakota/50136572/1 |title = Unemployed?

==Geography==

North Dakota is located in the U.S. region known as the Great Plains. The state shares the Red River of the North with Minnesota on the east; South Dakota is to the south, Montana is to the west, and the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba are north.  North Dakota is situated near the middle of North America with a stone marker in Rugby, North Dakota marking the "Geographic Center of the North American Continent".

The western half of the state consists of the hilly Great Plains, and the northern part of the Badlands to the west of the Missouri River. The state's high point, White Butte at [tpl]convert|3506|ft|m|0|sp=us[/tpl], and Theodore Roosevelt National Park[tpl]cite web| title = Theodore Roosevelt National Park Virtual Tour| publisher=The Real North Dakota Project| year = 2007| url = http://www.realnd.com/badlandsindex.htm | accessdate = August 17, 2007[/tpl] are located in the Badlands. The region is abundant in fossil fuels including natural gas, crude oil and lignite coal. The Missouri River forms Lake Sakakawea, the third largest man-made lake in the United States, behind the Garrison Dam.[tpl]cite web| title = History of Lake Sakakawea State Park| publisher=North Dakota Parks & Recreation Department| year = 2003| url = http://www.ndparks.com/Parks/Sakakawea/history.htm | accessdate = August 17, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928061913/http://www.ndparks.com/Parks/Sakakawea/history.htm  |archivedate = September 28, 2007[/tpl]
The central region of the state is divided into the Drift Prairie and the Missouri Plateau.  The eastern part of the state consists of the flat Red River Valley, the bottom of glacial Lake Agassiz. Its fertile soil, drained by the meandering Red River flowing northward into Lake Winnipeg, supports a large agriculture industry.[tpl]cite web| title = A Glacier, A Lake, A Valley and Soil for the Future| publisher=University of Minnesota| year = 1979| url = http://mbbnet.umn.edu/hoff/hoff_agassiz.html | accessdate = August 17, 2007[/tpl] Devils Lake, the largest natural lake in the state, is also found in the east.[tpl]cite web| title = North Dakota Facts and Trivia| publisher=50States.com| year = 2007| url = http://www.50states.com/facts/ndakota.htm | accessdate = August 17, 2007[/tpl]
Eastern North Dakota is overall flat, however, there are significant hills and buttes in western North Dakota. Most of the state is covered in grassland; crops cover most of eastern North Dakota but become increasingly sparse in the center and farther west. Natural trees in North Dakota are found usually where there is good drainage such as the ravines and valley near the Pembina Gorge and Killdeer Mountains, the Turtle Mountains, the hills around Devil's Lake, in the dunes area of McHenry County in central North Dakota, and along the Sheyenne Valley slopes and the Sheyenne delta. This diverse terrain supports nearly 2,000 species of plants.Shipunov, A. Flora of North Dakota: Checklist. 2012.

==History==

Prior to European contact, Native Americans inhabited North Dakota for thousands of years. The first European to reach the area was the French-Canadian trader La Vérendrye, who led an exploration party to Mandan villages in 1738.[tpl]cite web| title = Audio Transcript of Pierre Gaultier de La Vérendrye 1738| publisher=The Atlas of Canada| year = 2003| url = http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/exploration/1738_verendrye.mov/view | accessdate = August 19, 2007[/tpl]
Dakota Territory was settled sparsely until the late 19th century, when the railroads entered the region and vigorously marketed the land. An omnibus bill for statehood for North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington titled the Enabling Act of 1889 was passed on February 22, 1889 during the administration of Grover Cleveland, but it was left to his successor, Benjamin Harrison, to sign proclamations formally admitting North Dakota and South Dakota to the Union on November 2, 1889.[tpl]cite web| title = Enabling Act| publisher=Washington State Legislature| url =http://www.leg.wa.gov/History/State/enabling.htm | accessdate = August 19, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070919230052/http://www.leg.wa.gov/History/State/enabling.htm  |archivedate = September 19, 2007[/tpl]
The rivalry between the two new states presented a dilemma of which was to be admitted first. Harrison directed Secretary of State James G. Blaine to shuffle the papers and obscure from him which he was signing first and the actual order went unrecorded, thus no one knows which of the Dakotas was admitted first.[tpl]cite web| title = Coin of the Month| publisher=The United States Mint| url =http://www.usmint.gov/kids/coinNews/coinOfTheMonth/2006/09.cfm | accessdate = August 19, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title = North Dakota's Boundaries| publisher=North Dakota Geological Survey| year = 2002| url =https://www.dmr.nd.gov/ndgs//ndnotes/Boundaries/Boundaries.asp | accessdate = August 19, 2007[/tpl] However, since North Dakota alphabetically appears before South Dakota, its proclamation was published first in the Statutes At Large. Since that day, it has become common to list the Dakotas alphabetically and thus North Dakota is usually listed as the 39th state.[tpl]citation needed|date = November 2013[/tpl]
Unrest among wheat farmers, especially among Norwegian immigrants, led to a radical political movement after World War I centered in the Non Partisan League ("NPL"). The NPL, which eventually merged into the Democratic Party, attempted to insulate North Dakota from the power of out-of-state banks and corporations. In addition to founding the state-owned Bank of North Dakota and North Dakota Mill and Elevator (both still in existence), the NPL established a state-owned railroad line (later sold to the Soo Line Railroad). Anti-corporate laws were passed that virtually prohibited a corporation or bank from owning title to land zoned as farmland. These laws, still in force today, after having been upheld by both state and federal courts, make it almost impossible to foreclose on farmland, as even after foreclosure, the property title cannot be held by a bank or mortgage company.[tpl]citation needed|date = November 2013[/tpl]

In recent years the state has had a strong economy, with unemployment lower than the national average and strong job and population growth. Much of the growth has been based on development of the Bakken oil fields in the western part of the state. Estimates as to the remaining amount of oil vary, with some estimating over 100 years worth of oil remaining in the area.[tpl]cite web |first=Mark |last=Perry |url =http://www.aei-ideas.org/2013/01/bakken-oil-boom-in-north-dakota-might-last-for-100-years/ |title =Bakken oil boom in North Dakota might last for 100 years |publisher =American Enterprise Institute |date =January 31, 2013 |accessdate=February 7, 2013 [/tpl]

From fewer than 2,000 people in 1870, North Dakota's population grew to near 680,000 by 1930. Growth then slowed, and the population has fluctuated slightly over the past seven decades, hitting a low of 617,761 in the 1970 census, with a total of 642,200 in the 2000 census.[tpl]cite web| title = North Dakota Historical Population | publisher=North Dakota State University | url = http://www.ndsu.nodak.edu/instruct/sainieid/north-dakota-historical-population.html| accessdate = August 19, 2007[/tpl] The United States Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2008, estimated North Dakota's population at 641,481,[tpl]cite web| title = Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2008 | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate = January 31, 2009 | url = http://www.census.gov/popest/states/tables/NST-EST2008-01.csv[/tpl] which represents a decrease of 714, or 0.1%, since the last census in 2000.[tpl]cite web|title=Cumulative Estimates of the Components of Population Change for the United States, Regions and States: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2008 (NST-EST2008-04) |url=http://www.census.gov/popest/states/tables/NST-EST2008-04.csv |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |date=December 15, 2008 |accessdate=January 16, 2009 |format=CSV[/tpl] This includes a natural increase since the last census of 20,460 people (that is 67,788 births minus 47,328 deaths) and a decrease due to net migration of 17,787 people out of the state.
Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 3,323 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 21,110 people.

====Migration====

Throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century, North Dakota, along with most of the midwest, experienced a mass influx of newcomers both from the eastern United States and new arrivals from Europe. North Dakota was a known popular destination for immigrant farmers and general laborers and their families, mostly from Norway, Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom. Much of this settlement gravitated throughout the western side of the Red River Valley, as was similarly seen in South Dakota and in a parallel manner in Minnesota. This area is well known for its fertile lands, and by the outbreak of the First World War was among the richest farming regions in North America.
From the 1930s until the end of the 20th century, North Dakota's population experienced a gradual decline, interrupted by a couple of brief increases. Young adults with university degrees were particularly likely to leave the state.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] With the advancing process of mechanization of agricultural practices, subsistence farming proved to be too risky for families, and many people moved to urban areas for jobs.[tpl]cite web| title = Leading Population Trends in North Dakota | publisher=North Dakota State University | year = 2007| url = http://www.ndsu.edu/sdc/data/populationtrends.htm | accessdate = August 19, 2007[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl] One of the major causes of migration from North Dakota is the lack of skilled jobs for college graduates.  Some propose the expansion of economic development programs to create skilled and high-tech jobs, but the effectiveness of such programs has been open to debate.[tpl]cite web| title = Agenda 2003 – Saving North Dakota | publisher=The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead | year = 2002| url = http://www.in-forum.com/specials/savingnd/index2.cfm?page=articles_inside&id=27390 | accessdate = August 19, 2007[/tpl] During the first decade of the 21st century, the population increased in large part because of jobs in the oil industry related to development of shale-oil fields.Oil boom turbocharges North Dakota population growth.

===Languages===

In 2010, 94.86% (584,496) of North Dakotans over 5 years old spoke English as their primary language. 5.14% (31,684) of North Dakotans spoke a language other than English. 1.39% (8,593) spoke German, 1.37% (8,432) spoke Spanish, and 0.30% (1,847) spoke Norwegian.

===Religion===

North Dakota has the most churches per capita of any state.
A 2001 survey indicated that 35% of North Dakota's population was Lutheran, and 30% was Catholic. Other religious groups represented were Methodists (7%), Baptists (6%), the Assemblies of God (3%), and Jehovah's Witnesses (1%). Christians with unstated or other denominational affiliations, including other Protestants and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormonism), totaled 3%, bringing the total Christian population to 86%. Other religions, such as Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism, together represented 4% of the population. There were an estimated 920 Muslims and 730 Jews in the state in 2000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/states/North-Dakota-Religions.html |title=North Dakota – Religions |publisher=City-data.com |date= |accessdate=September 13, 2013[/tpl]  Three percent of respondents answered "no religion" on the survey, and 6% declined to answer.

==Culture==

===American Indian presence===

North Dakota has a great number of Native Americans, and in fact the word "Dakota" is a corruption of a Sioux word meaning "allies" or "friends". The primary tribal groups originating in or around North Dakota, consist of the Lakota and the Dakotah (often lumped together as "Sioux"), the Blackfoot, the Cheyenne, the Chippewa, and the Mandan (now extinct). Social gatherings known as "powwows" (or pow-wows) are an important aspect of Native American culture, and occur regularly throughout the State. Throughout Native American history, powwows were held, usually in the spring, to rejoice on the beginning of new life and the end of the winter cold. These events brought Native American tribes together for singing and dancing and allowed them to meet up with old friends and acquaintances, as well as to make new ones. Many powwows also held religious significance for some tribes. Today, powwows are still a part of the Native American culture, and are attended by Native and non-Natives alike. In North Dakota, the United Tribes International Powwow, held each September in Bismarck, is one of the largest powwows in the United States.
A pow wow is complete with parades and dancers in regalia, with many dancing styles presented. It is traditional for male dancers to wear regalia decorated with beads, quills and eagle feathers; male grass dancers wear colorful fringe regalia; and male fancy dancers wear brightly colored feathers. Female dancers dance much more subtly than the male dancers. Fancy female dancers wear cloth, beaded moccasins and jewelry, while the jingle dress dancer wears a dress made of metal cones. There are inter-tribal dances throughout the pow wow, where everyone (even spectators) can take part in the dancing.

===Norwegian and Icelandic influence===

Around 1870 many European immigrants from Norway settled in North Dakota's northeastern corner, especially near the Red River. Icelanders also arrived from Canada.William Charles Sherman, Playford V. Thorson, Warren A. Henke,  Plains Folk: North Dakota's ethnic history (North Dakota Institute for Regional Studies, 1986) pp 189, 242, 256 Pembina housed many Norwegians when it was founded; they worked on family farms. They started Lutheran churches and schools and they greatly outnumbered other denominations in the area. This group has unique foods such as lefse and lutefisk. The continent's largest Scandinavian event, Norsk Høstfest, is celebrated each September in Minot. The Icelandic State Park in Pembina County and an annual Icelandic festival reflect immigrants from that country.
Old world folk customs have persisted for decades, with revival of techniques in weaving, silver crafting, and wood carving. Traditional turf-roof houses are displayed in parks; this style originated in Iceland. A stave church is a landmark in Minot. Ethnic Norwegians constitute nearly one-third or 32.3% of Minot's total population and 30.8% of North Dakota's total population.

===Germans from Russia===

Ethnic Germans who had settled in Russia for several generations grew dissatisfied in the nineteenth century. About 100,000 immigrated to the U.S. by 1900, settling primarily in North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas and Nebraska. The south-central part of North Dakota became known as "the German-Russian triangle". By 1910, about 60,000 ethnic Germans from Russia lived in Central North Dakota. They were Lutherans and Roman Catholics who had kept many German customs of the time when their ancestors emigrated to Russia.  They were committed to agriculture. Traditional iron cemetery grave markers are a famous art form practiced by ethnic Germans.Elwyn B. Robinson, History of North Dakota (1966) pp. 285–87, 557[tpl]cite web|url=http://library.ndsu.edu/grhc/articles/newspapers/news/gilmour3.html |title=Germans from Russia Heritage Collection |publisher=Library.ndsu.edu |date=September 1, 2002 |accessdate=September 13, 2013[/tpl]

===Fine and performing arts===

North Dakota's major fine art museums and venues include the Chester Fritz Auditorium, Empire Arts Center, the Fargo Theatre, North Dakota Museum of Art, and the Plains Art Museum. The Bismarck-Mandan Symphony Orchestra, Fargo-Moorhead Symphony Orchestra, Greater Grand Forks Symphony Orchestra, Minot Symphony Orchestra and Great Plains Harmony Chorus are full-time professional and semi-professional musical ensembles that perform concerts and offer educational programs to the community.

===Entertainment===

North Dakotan musicians of many genres include blues guitarist Jonny Lang, country music singer Lynn Anderson, jazz and traditional pop singer and songwriter Peggy Lee, big band leader Lawrence Welk, and pop singer Bobby Vee.  The state is also home to two groups of the Indie rock genre that have become known on a national scale: GodheadSilo (originally from Fargo, but later relocated to Olympia, Washington and became signed to the Kill Rock Stars label) and June Panic (also of Fargo, signed to Secretly Canadian).
Ed Schultz is known around the country as the host of progressive talk radio show The Ed Schultz Show, and The Ed Show on MSNBC. Shadoe Stevens hosted American Top 40 from 1988 to 1995.
