The castor oil plant (Ricinus communis) is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It belongs to a monotypic genus, Ricinus, and subtribe, Ricininae. The evolution of castor and its relation to other species are currently being studied using modern genetic tools.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.igs.umaryland.edu/?q=content/euphorbiaceae-spurge-genomics |title=Euphorbiaceae (spurge) genomics |work=Institute for Genome Sciences |publisher=University of Maryland Medical School |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl]
Its seed is the castor bean, which, despite its name, is not a true bean. Castor is indigenous to the southeastern Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Africa, and India, but is widespread throughout tropical regions (and widely grown elsewhere as an ornamental plant).
Castor seed is the source of castor oil, which has a wide variety of uses. The seeds contain between 40% and 60% oil that is rich in triglycerides, mainly ricinolein. The seed contains ricin, a toxin, which is also present in lower concentrations throughout the plant.
An unrelated plant species, Fatsia japonica, is similar in appearance and known as the false castor oil plant.

==Description==

The castor oil plant can vary greatly in its growth habit and appearance. The variability has been increased by breeders who have selected a range of cultivars for leaf and flower colours, and for oil production. It is a fast-growing, suckering perennial shrub that can reach the size of a small tree (around [tpl]convert|12|m|ft|disp=or[/tpl]), but it is not cold hardy.
The glossy leaves are [tpl]convert|15|–|45|cm|in[/tpl] long, long-stalked, alternate and palmate with 5–12 deep lobes with coarsely toothed segments. In some varieties they start off dark reddish purple or bronze when young, gradually changing to a dark green, sometimes with a reddish tinge, as they mature. The leaves of some other varieties are green practically from the start, whereas in yet others a pigment masks the green colour of all the chlorophyll-bearing parts, leaves, stems and young fruit, so that they remain a dramatic purple-to-reddish-brown throughout the life of the plant. Plants with the dark leaves can be found growing next to those with green leaves, so there is most likely only a single gene controlling the production of the pigment in some varieties.e.g. http://database.prota.org/publishedspeciesEn.htm The stems (and the spherical, spiny seed capsules) also vary in pigmentation. The fruit capsules of some varieties are more showy than the flowers.
The flowers are borne in terminal panicle-like inflorescences of green or, in some varieties, shades of red monoecious flowers without petals. The male flowers are yellowish-green with prominent creamy stamens and are carried in ovoid spikes up to [tpl]convert|15|cm|in|[/tpl] long; the female flowers, borne at the tips of the spikes, have prominent red stigmas.[tpl]cite book |editor=Christopher Brickell |title=The Royal Horticultural Society A-Z Encyclopedia of Garden Plants |year=1996 |pages=884–885 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location=London |isbn=0-7513-0303-8[/tpl]
The fruit is a spiny, greenish (to reddish-purple) capsule containing large, oval, shiny, bean-like, highly poisonous seeds with variable brownish mottling. Castor seeds have a warty appendage called the caruncle, which is a type of elaiosome. The caruncle promotes the dispersal of the seed by ants (myrmecochory).

==Nomenclature==

The name Ricinus is a Latin word for tick; the seed is so named because it has markings and a bump at the end that resemble certain ticks. The common name "castor oil" probably comes from its use as a replacement for castoreum, a perfume base made from the dried perineal glands of the beaver (castor in Latin).[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.billcasselman.com/cwod_archive/beaver_castor_two.htm|title= The Complex Case of Castor’s Etymology[/tpl] It has another common name, palm of Christ, or Palma Christi, that derives from castor oil's reputed ability to heal wounds and cure ailments.

==Medicinal uses==

Castor oil has many uses in medicine and other applications.

The Bodo tribals of Bodoland, Assam (India), use the leaves of this plant to feed and rear the larvae of muga and endi silkworms.
Castor oil is an effective motor lubricant and has been used in internal combustion engines, including those of World War I airplanes, some racing cars and some model airplanes. It does not mix with petroleum products. It has been largely replaced by synthetic oils that are more stable and less toxic.

==Habitat, growth and horticultural uses==

Although castor is indigenous to the southeastern Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Africa, and India, today it is widespread throughout tropical regions. In areas with a suitable climate, castor establishes itself easily where it can become an invasive plant and can often be found on wasteland.
It is also used extensively as a decorative plant in parks and other public areas, particularly as a "dot plant" in traditional bedding schemes. If sown early, under glass, and kept at a temperature of around [tpl]convert|20|°C|°F[/tpl] until planted out, the castor oil plant can reach a height of [tpl]convert|2|–|3|m|ft[/tpl] in a year. In areas prone to frost it is usually shorter, and grown as if it were an annual.[tpl]cite book |first1=Roger |last1=Phillips |first2=Martyn |last2=Rix |year=1999 |title=Annuals and Biennials |page=106 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |isbn=0-333-74889-1[/tpl] However, it can grow well outdoors in cooler climates, at least in southern England, and the leaves do not appear to suffer frost damage in sheltered spots, where it remains evergreen.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] It was used in Edwardian times in the parks of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Although not cultivated there, the plant grows wild in Southern California, notably Griffith Park in Los Angeles. Toronto Star, 9 June 1906, p. 17 

===Cultivars===

Selections have been made by breeders for use as ornamental plants (heights refer to plants grown as annuals) and for commercial production of castor oil.
Ornamental varieties:

==Plant-animal interactions==

Ricinus communis is the host plant of the Common Castor Butterfly (Ariadne merione), the Eri silkmoth (Samia cynthia ricini), and the Castor Semi-Looper Moth (Achaea janata). It is also used as a food plant by the larvae of some other species of Lepidoptera, including Hypercompe hambletoni and the Nutmeg (Discestra trifolii).

==Toxicity==

The toxicity of raw castor beans is due to the presence of ricin. Although the lethal dose in adults is considered to be four to eight seeds, reports of actual poisoning are relatively rare.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wedin GP, Neal JS, Everson GW, Krenzelok EP |title=Castor bean poisoning |journal=Am J Emerg Med |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=259–61 |date=May 1986 |pmid=3964368 |doi=10.1016/0735-6757(86)90080-X[/tpl] According to the 2007 edition of Guinness World Records, this plant is the most poisonous in the world. Despite this, suicides involving ingestion of castor beans are unheard of in countries like India where castor grows abundantly on the roadsides. The aversion to the use of the beans in suicide could be due to the painful and unpleasant symptoms of overdosing on ricin, which can include nausea, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypotension and seizures persisting for up to a week. However, the poison can be extracted from castor by concentrating it with a fairly complicated process similar to that used for extracting cyanide from almonds.
If ricin is ingested, symptoms may be delayed by up to 36 hours but commonly begin within 2–4 hours. These include a burning sensation in mouth and throat, abdominal pain, purging and bloody diarrhea. Within several days there is severe dehydration, a drop in blood pressure and a decrease in urine. Unless treated, death can be expected to occur within 3–5 days, however in most cases a full recovery can be made.[tpl]cite journal |author=Soto-Blanco B, Sinhorini IL, Gorniak SL, Schumaher-Henrique B |title=Ricinus communis cake poisoning in a dog |journal=Vet Hum Toxicol |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=155–6 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12046967 [/tpl]Ricinus communis (Castor bean)—Cornell University 2008. http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/castorbean.html
Poisoning occurs when animals, including humans, ingest broken seeds or break the seed by chewing: intact seeds may pass through the digestive tract without releasing the toxin. Toxicity varies among animal species: four seeds will kill a rabbit, five a sheep, six an ox or horse, seven a pig, and eleven a dog. Ducks have shown far more resistance to the seeds: it takes an average of 80 to kill them.Union County College: Biology: Plant of the Week: Castor Bean Plant The toxin provides the castor oil plant with some degree of natural protection from insect pests such as aphids. Ricin has been investigated for its potential use as an insecticide. The castor oil plant is also the source for undecylenic acid, a natural fungicide.
Commercially available cold-pressed castor oil is not toxic to humans in normal doses, either internal or externally.[tpl]cite journal |author=Irwin R |title=NTP technical report on the toxicity studies of Castor Oil (CAS No. 8001-79-4) In F344/N Rats And B6C3F1 Mice (Dosed Feed Studies) |journal=Toxic Rep Ser |volume=12 |issue= |pages=1–B5 |date=March 1982 |pmid=12209174 [/tpl]

==Chemistry==

Three terpenoids and a tocopherol-related compound have been found in the aerial parts of Ricinus communis. Compounds named (3E,7Z,11E)-19-hydroxycasba-3,7,11-trien-5-one, 6α-hydroxy-10β-methoxy-7α,8α-epoxy-5-oxocasbane-20,10-olide, 15α-hydroxylup-20(29)-en-3-one, and (2R,4aR,8aR)-3,4,4a,8a-tetrahydro-4a-hydroxy-2,6,7,8a-tetramethyl-2-(4,8, 12-trimethyltridecyl)-2H-chromene-5,8-dione were isolated from the methanol extracts of Ricinus communis by chromatographic methods.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tan Q.-G., Cai X.-H., Dua Z.-Z., Luo X.-D. |title=Three terpenoids and a tocopherol-related compound from Ricinus communis |journal=Helvetica Chimica Acta |volume=92 |issue=12 |pages=2762–8 |year=2009  |doi=10.1002/hlca.200900105 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hlca.200900105/abstract[/tpl]

==Modern commercial usage==

Global castor seed production is around one million tons per year. Leading producing areas are India (with over three-quarters of the global yield), China and Brazil, and it is widely grown as a crop in Ethiopia. There are several active breeding programmes.
 

===Production===

===Other modern uses===

In Brazil, castor oil (locally known as mamona oil) is now being used to produce biodiesel. In rural areas, the abundant seeds are used by children for slingshot balls, as they have the right weight, size, and hardness.
The attractive castor seeds are used in jewelry, mainly necklaces and bracelets.
Castor oil was traditionally used on the skin to prevent dryness. This is now used as a base for many cosmetics.
Castor oil in a processed form, called Polyglycerol polyricinoleate—or PGPR, is currently being used in chocolate bar manufacturing as a less expensive substitute for cocoa butter.
Castor oil is often used in the USA to repel moles and voles for lawn care.
In Mexico this plant is known as Grilla (pronounced gr-ee-ya).

==Historical usage==

Castor seeds have been found in Egyptian tombs dating back to 4000 BC; the slow burning oil was used mostly to fuel lamps. Herodotus and other Greek travellers noted the use of castor seed oil for lighting, body ointments, and improving hair growth and texture. Cleopatra is reputed to have used it to brighten the whites of her eyes. The Ebers Papyrus is an ancient Egyptian medical treatise believed to date from 1552 BC. Translated in 1872, it describes castor oil as a laxative.Tunaru S, Althoff TF, Nusing RM, Diener M, Offermanns S. Castor Oil Induces Laxation and Uterus Contraction via Ricinoleic Acid Activating Prostaglandin EP3 Receptors. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 2012; 109(23)9179-9184.
The use of castor bean oil ("eranda") in India has been documented since 2000 BC in lamps and in local medicine as a laxative, purgative, and cathartic in Unani, Ayurvedic and other ethnomedical systems. Traditional Ayurvedic medicine considers castor oil the king of medicinals for curing arthritic diseases. It is regularly given to children orally, for de-worming.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Castor seed and its oil have also been used in China for centuries, mainly prescribed in local medicine for internal use or use in dressings.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Castor oil was used as an instrument of coercion by the paramilitary Blackshirts under the regime of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Dissidents and regime opponents were forced to ingest the oil in large amounts, triggering severe diarrhea and dehydration, which could ultimately cause death. This punishment method was originally thought of by Gabriele D'Annunzio, the Italian poet and Fascist supporter, during the First World War. (See also: Castor oil's use as a means of intimidation in Fascist Italy.)[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
