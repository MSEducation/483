[[2011â€“12 United States network television schedule (Saturday morning)]]

CATEGORIES: 2011 in American television, 2012 in American television, United States Saturday morning network television schedules

This was the United States broadcast television schedule on the four commercial television networks airing entertainment programming on Saturday mornings for the season beginning in the fall of 2011 and ending in the spring of 2012. All times are Eastern and Pacific.
Fox's programming, not listed here, consists only of a two-hour block of infomercials, Weekend Marketplace, which Fox affiliates program at their own convenience.
Litton's Weekend Adventure, a live action block of teen-oriented programs with advertising targeted at adults, debuted in September 2011, coinciding with the end of ABC's children's block, ABC Kids, and the debut of Toonin' Saturdays on sister cable network Disney Channel. Also, when Litton's Weekend Adventure debuted, ABC discontinued televising animated programs, choosing instead to devote more airtime to live-action programming for children. The Weekend Adventure currently airs only on ABC affiliates, but separate from that network.
New series in bold.
