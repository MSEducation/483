Pope Romanus (died November 897) was Pope from August to November 897.
Romanus, whose personal name is unknown, was born in Gallese, Italy near Civita Castellana. He was elected to succeed the murdered Pope Stephen VI during a period when the papacy was fought over by various Italian factions. Like many popes of the era, Romanus annulled all the acts and decrees of his predecessor. His short rule was regarded as a virtuous one by contemporary historian Flodoard, but 15th-century historian Bartolomeo Platina scorned him for continuing the practice of annulment. An opposing faction deposed him later the same year and he ended his days as a monk.[tpl]ws|"Pope Romanus" in the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia[/tpl]  His date of death is unknown.
