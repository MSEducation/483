A foreign exchange certificate, sometimes abbreviated to FEC, is a type of currency. Foreign exchange certificates are sometimes used by governments as a surrogate for a national currency, where the national currency is usually subject to exchange controls or is not convertible.[tpl]cite web|title=Currency Certificate|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency_certificate.asp|publisher=investopedia|accessdate=19 April 2014[/tpl]  Most examples of foreign exchange certificate have an exchange rate higher than the national currency, being either pegged to a hard currency, or their exchange rate determined by the central bank.
