==Scholarly contributions==

The central theme in Martin's research is the dynamics of power, with special attention to strategies for challenging repression and exploitation. He has explored power dynamics through an interplay of theory and case studies, including nonviolent action, technological vulnerability, values in science, environmental politics, institutional roots of war, dissent and scientific controversies. His theory of 'blowback' explains the unforeseen adverse consequences of government actions, particularly covert operations.
Martin is the author of 13 booksBrian Martin: books and booklets (downloaded 27. November 2011) and over 200 major papers and chapters.
