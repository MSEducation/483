libvirt is an open source API, daemon and management tool for managing platform virtualization.[tpl] cite web | url=http://libvirt.org | title=libvirt home page description [/tpl]  It can be used to manage KVM, Xen, VMware ESX, QEMU and other virtualization technologies. These APIs are widely used in the orchestration layer of hypervisors in the development of a cloud-based solution.

==Internals==

libvirt itself is a C library, but it has bindings in other languages, notably in Python,[tpl] cite web | url=http://libvirt.org/python.html | title=Python bindings [/tpl] Perl,[tpl] cite web | url=https://metacpan.org/module/Sys::Virt | title=Perl bindings [/tpl] OCaml,[tpl] cite web | url=http://libvirt.org/ocaml/ | title=OCaml bindings [/tpl] Ruby,[tpl] cite web | url=http://libvirt.org/ruby/ | title=Ruby bindings [/tpl] Java,[tpl] cite web | url=http://www.libvirt.org/java.html | title=Java bindings [/tpl] and PHP.[tpl] cite web | url=http://libvirt.org/php/ | title=PHP bindings [/tpl] libvirt for these programming languages is composed of wrappers around another class/package called libvirtmod. libvirtmod's implementation is closely associated with its counterpart in C/C++ in syntax and functionality.
