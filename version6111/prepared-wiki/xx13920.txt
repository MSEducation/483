[[541]]

CATEGORIES: 541

Year 541 (DXLI) was a common year starting on Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Basilius without colleague (or, less frequently, year 1294 ''Ab urbe condita''). Basilius is the last person to be officially appointed Roman consul, since after this year, the office is merged with the office of Byzantine empire. Thus, from the next year forward, the consular year dating is abandoned. The denomination 541 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
