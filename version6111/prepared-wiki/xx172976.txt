==History==

The Municipality of Praia is one of the oldest administrative divisions in Cape Verde. It was created in the 18th century, when the town Praia de Santa Maria became a city, and became the new capital of Cape Verde. Through its history, the municipality has been successively reduced due to demographic increase.
By the end of the 19th century, the Municipality of Praia occupied the southern half of the island, while the northern half was the Municipality of Santa Catarina. In 1971, two northern parishes of the Municipality were split off to become the Municipality of Santa Cruz. In 1988, two more northern parishes of the Municipality were split off to become the Municipality of São Domingos. In 2005, two western parishes of the Municipality were split off to become the Municipality of Ribeira Grande de Santiago.
