==Reception and context==

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4Â½ stars and states "Altoist Cannonball Adderley and tenor saxophonist John Coltrane really push each other on these six selections... Coltrane's very serious sound is a striking contrast to the jubilant Adderley alto... With pianist Wynton Kelly, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Jimmy Cobb playing up to their usual level, this gem is highly recommended".Yanow, S. Allmusic Review accessed 19 October 2009 
The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded the album 3 stars asserting: "The session with Coltrane is really the Miles Davis band without Miles and it's a bit of good fun, both hornmen flexing their muscles on the blues and a ballad feature apiece".[tpl]cite book|last = Cook|first = Richard|authorlink = Richard Cook (journalist)|coauthors = Brian Morton|title = The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings|origyear = 1992|edition = 8th|series = The Penguin Guide to Jazz|year = 2006|publisher = Penguin|location = London|isbn = 978-0-141-02327-4|pages = 9[/tpl]
