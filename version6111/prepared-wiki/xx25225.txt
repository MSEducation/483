</ref> These two techniques are referred to as androgenesis, which refers to the development of [[pollen]]. Many plant species and [[cultivars]] within species, including triticale, are recalcitrant in that the success rate of achieving whole newly generated (diploid) plants is very low. Genotype by culture medium interaction is responsible for varying success rates, as is a high degree of microspore abortion during culturing.(Johansson ''et al.'' 2000)<ref name="GonzÃ¡lez2005">
