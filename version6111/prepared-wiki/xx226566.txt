==Professional career==

===Television===

Calderón, the year 2006 began her career as actress in the infantile miniseries of TVN called Karkú. The series was released on February 5, 2007, and lasted some months.
As almost all the infantile and pre-teen series on the Chilean television, Karkú also created a musical group, with the series' actors as members. The group was called Six Pack. Finally, they recorded a disc, that was released in 2007. In spite of the fact that the group did not have a main vocalist, Calderón made herself the main member attracting most attention, probably because she was relatively better known than the others. Six Pack, that debuted on stage on July 21, 2007, received mixed reviews.
Due to the group's success, Kel's recording company started preparing a solo career for her. She began taking singing and guitar classes with the Uruguayan singer and musician Gonzalo Yáñez.[tpl]cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121213151/http://www.tkg.cl/?a=15852|title=Quieren lanzar a Raquelita como solista|date=2007-09-29|accessdate=2011-08-06|work=Terra.cl|publisher=TKG.cl|language=Spanish[/tpl]
At the end of the year, her producing company My Friend obtained a contract with the television channel Canal 13 for a new juvenile teleseries called Antonia. The contract with a rival network displeased TVN.
On January 2, 2008, conflicts between Raquel, her father Hernán Calderón, and the My Friend Entertainment producing company resulted in an abrupt termination of her contract. Her participation in Karkú, Six Pack and Antonia was cancelled.

===Music===

But a little later, Calderón announced that she would begin a solo career as a singer under the stage name Kel, with Gonzalo Yáñez as her producer. On January 14, Kel filmed her first solo music video for her first solo single, "Tenerte Cerca", in a Santiago mall.[tpl]cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125180512/http://www.terra.cl/musica/contenido.cfm?id_cat=115&id_reg=907807|title=RAQUELITA GRABA VIDEO CLIP EN MALL|date=2011-01-14|accessdate=2011-08-06|language=Spanish|publisher=Terra.cl[/tpl] The video was directed by Esteban Vidal.

===Punks incident===

At the release of her first disc No Molestar!, Chilean punks gathered outside the record shop in Santiago where Kel was going to release the album. The punks gathered to protest and express their disapproval of Kel's song "Me Creo Punky" ("I believe I'm a punk"), a pop song whose music video features Kel and other people dressed and behaving like punk stereotypes. The punks throwed objects from the street into the music store and police had to be called to the place. Despite the police action, the release event had to be cancelled. Kel later declared she was not scared by the punks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.terra.cl/musica/index.cfm?id_cat=115&id_reg=994970|title=KEL Y LA ENEMISTAD DE LOS PUNKIES: "HAY COSAS MÁS IMPORTANTES POR LAS QUE SALIR A MANIFESTARSE"|date=2008-07-04|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=Terra.cl|language=Spanish[/tpl]
