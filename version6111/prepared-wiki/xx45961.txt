[[Techno-thriller]]

CATEGORIES: Techno-thrillers

Techno-thrillers (or technothrillers) are a hybrid genre, drawing subject matter generally from science fiction, thrillers, spy, action, and war. They include a disproportionate amount (relative to other genres) of technical details on its subject matter (typically military technology); only science fiction tends towards a comparable level of supporting detail on the technical side. The inner workings of technology and the mechanics of various disciplines (espionage, martial arts, politics) are thoroughly explored, and the plot often turns on the particulars of that exploration.

==History==

Michael Crichton and Tom Clancy are considered to be the fathers of the "modern techno-thriller";http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1993-04-11/features/9302050353_1_tom-clancy-clancy-novel-fiction Crichton's book The Andromeda Strain and Clancy's book The Hunt for Red October set out the type example which defined the genre, although many authors had been writing similar material earlier, such as Craig Thomas, whom BBC News also credits as an early innovator.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-13012763|title=Techno thriller writer Craig Thomas dies|author=|work=BBC News|date=2011-04-08|accessdate=2014-04-15[/tpl]

==Style==

Techno-thrillers focus strongly on details, especially on the technology, which is frequently of military origin.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-10-02/entertainment/bs-md-clancy-appreciation-20131002_1_tom-clancy-cold-war-red-october|title=Clancy invented 'techno-thriller,' reflected Cold War fears|last=Kaltenbach|first=Chris|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=2013-10-02|accessdate=2014-04-15[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/10/02/tom-clancy-appreciation/2908305/|title=Appreciation: Tom Clancy mastered the techno-thriller|last=Minzesheimer|first=Bob|work=USA Today|date=2013-10-03|accessdate=2014-04-15[/tpl] Techno-thrillers tend to have a broad scope in the narrative, and can often be regarded as contemporary speculative fiction; world wars are a common topic. Techno-thrillers often overlap, as far as the genre goes, with near-future science fiction. To the extent that technology is now a dominant aspect of modern global culture, most modern thrillers are "techno-thrillers", and the genre is somewhat diffuse. Techno-thrillers blur smoothly into the category of hard science fiction; the defining characteristics of techno-thriller are an emphasis on real-world or plausible near-future technology. There is often a focus on military or military-political action. Techno-thrillers also overlap with conspiracy fiction and apocalyptic fiction.
