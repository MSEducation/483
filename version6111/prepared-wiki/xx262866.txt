The Mexican expedition was undertaken in 1862 on order of emperor Napoleon III following a financial dispute with the Republic of Mexico and his personal desire to create a Catholic empire on the continent to counterbalance U.S. influence.  On 7 January 1862, approximately 3,000 French soldiers landed at Vera Cruz.  Small British and Spanish contingents that were originally part of the adventure preferred to withdraw quickly leaving only the French forces assisted by small numbers of Austrian, Belgian and Turkish troops.[tpl]cite web  | authorlink = Marc Champenois | title = France Phaléristique web site | publisher = Marc Champenois | date = 2004-01-01 | url = http://www.france-phaleristique.com/accueil.htm| language = French | accessdate =2013-10-29 [/tpl]
These forces, whose numbers would later rise to approximately 38,000 men, were successively placed under the command of generals Charles de Lorencez,  Élie Frédéric Forey and finally François Achille Bazaine.  The campaign was the scene of some of the most notable battles in French military history, such as the glorious struggle for the village of Camaron where, on 30 April 1863, sixty two legionnaires resisted bravely for nine hours against over two thousand Mexicans, allowing for the capture of the city of Puebla on 17 May 1863 thus paving the way to Mexico.  In the capital, an assembly of notables recognized Archduke Maximilian of Habsburg, brother of Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria, as Emperor of Mexico.
However, even with the support of 20,000 Mexicans who embraced the new emperor, Maximilian's forces were harassed in their work of pacification by the troops of President Benito Juárez who had the support of the United States.  In February 1867, Emperor Napoleon III ordered the repatriation of all remaining French troops from Mexico, the last elements left the port of Vera Cruz on 12 March 1867. An abandoned Emperor Maximilian, defeated and captured near the city of Querétaro, was executed in June of that year.

==Award description==

The Commemorative medal of the Mexico Expedition was a 30mm in diameter circular silver medal.  Its obverse bore the left profile of Emperor Napoleon III crowned with a laurel wreath surrounded by the relief inscription "NAPOLEON III" "EMPEREUR" ([tpl]lang-en|"NAPOLEON III EMPEROR"[/tpl]).  A 4mm wide relief laurel wreath ran along the entire circumference of both the obverse and reverse of the medal.
On the reverse, within the laurel wreath, the circular relief inscription " * EXPEDITION DU MEXIQUE * 1862•1863" ([tpl]lang-en|"MEXICAN EXPEDITION 1862•1863"[/tpl]), two small five pointed stars separating the text from the dates.  At the center, the relief inscription on five lines of the campaign's major battles "CUMBRES" "CERRO-BORREGO" "SAN-LORENZO" "PUEBLA" "MEXICO".
The medal hung from a 36mm wide white silk moiré ribbon bearing 5mm red and green stripes arranged at a 45 degree angle forming a cross, over which was superimposed a black eagle, its wings spread and holding a green snake in its beak and talons, a design inspired by the coat of arms of Mexico.
