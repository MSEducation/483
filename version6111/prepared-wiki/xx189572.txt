The approach to preserving the cemetery grave stones was the subject of a paper by M. Riegerta and A. Turkington.  The paper published in Building and Environment discusses the "scientific knowledge of decay processes with conservation theory and the needs of stakeholders".Building Stone Decay: Observations, Experiments and Modeling
