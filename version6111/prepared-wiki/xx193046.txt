The World Chess Championship 2012 was a chess match between the defending world champion Viswanathan Anand of India and Boris Gelfand of Israel, winner of the 2011 Candidates Tournament.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=7249 |title=FIDE Candidates Finals: Gelfand wins right to challenge Anand in 2012! |date=25 May 2011 |publisher=chessbase.com[/tpl] After sixteen games, including four rapid games, Anand retained his title.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gHZAchZ_60AZX5rlieGS-NfxXC-A?docId=CNG.79918e18ca747992019a7cdb296dc2ba.351 |title=India's Anand keeps world chess title after shootout |first=Stuart |last=Williams |date=30 May 2012[/tpl] The match, held under the auspices of the World Chess Federation FIDE, took place between 10 and 30 May 2012 in the Engineering Building of the State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, Russia.[tpl]cite web |url=http://rt.com/sport/anand-gelfand-tretyakov-moscow-chess-fide-753/ |title=Tretyakov Gallery to host chess crown battle |publisher=RT.com |date=20 February 2012 |accessdate=29 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=7936 |title=FIDE to receive 10–12 million Euros for upcoming cycles |publisher=chessbase.com |date=22 February 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2012[/tpl] The prize fund was US$2.55 million.[tpl]cite web |url=http://whychess.org/en/node/1279 |title=Moscow wins bid to host 2012 World Championship |publisher=WhyChess |date=8 August 2011 |accessdate=21 December 2011[/tpl]
Anand was the defending champion, having gained the title in 2007 and defended it in 2008 (against Vladimir Kramnik) and in 2010 (against Veselin Topalov). Boris Gelfand became the challenger in 2012 after winning the eight-player 2011 Candidates Tournament. Anand's subsequent victory, therefore, was his third consecutive title defence.[tpl]cite news|author=Stephen Moss |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/may/30/viswanathan-anand-crowned-chess-champion?newsfeed=true |title=Anand remains king of world chess as Gelfand's time runs out | Sport |publisher=The Guardian |date= 30 May 2012|accessdate=31 May 2012 |location=London[/tpl]
The match conditions called for twelve games to be played with classical time control. If a player scored at least 6½ points, he would be declared the winner and the match ended. By the end of the twelve games, however, the match was tied at 6 points each, so four rapid games were played in order to produce a result. Anand won the rapid-game playoff with a win in the second game and draws in the other three games.

==Candidates Tournament==

The process for selecting the challenger has undergone a number of changes. A major change was announced on 25 November 2008, when it was announced that a two-player Challenger Match would be replaced with an eight-player Candidates Tournament. The change was criticised by a number of players and commentators, as well as by the Association of Chess Professionals. In June 2009, FIDE indicated that the format would be in the form of matches.FIDE Regulations, released on FIDE web site on 22 June 2009 http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/4050-regulations-for-the-candidates-matches-2010
Originally, the intended venue for the candidate matches was Baku, but Levon Aronian announced that he would not play in Azerbaijan and matches involving him were to be held in a different country.FIDE Candidates Tournament split between two venues, Chessbase, 18 October 2009 The venue was changed to Kazan, Russia in July 2010, but the Azerbaijan nominee Shakhriyar Mamedyarov still remained in the tournament despite the tournament not being held in Azerbaijan.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2011[/tpl]
In November 2010, then world No. 2 Magnus Carlsen withdrew from the Candidates' Tournament citing the selection process as not sufficiently modern and fair.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/home/TabId/211/PostId/4006789|title=Chess News – Magnus Carlsen drops out of World Championship cycle|publisher=ChessBase.com|date=5 November 2010|accessdate=25 May 2013[/tpl] He was replaced by Alexander Grischuk.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/home/TabId/211/PostId/4006799|title=Grischuk to replace Carlsen in the Candidates|publisher=ChessBase.com |date=10 November 2010|accessdate=25 May 2013[/tpl]

==Venue==

The 2012 FIDE World Chess Championship was held in Moscow, Russia.
The Executive Board gave during its congress in fall 2009 in Halkidiki an option to London, United Kingdom to organise the World Chess Championship for 2012. They had until 15 February 2010 to exercise the option which had to include the offer of a prize fund similar to that for the World Chess Championship 2010 match.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.chessmix.com/chess-news/London-given-option-for-World-Championship-2012.html |title=London given option for World Championship 2012 |publisher=News.chessmix.com |accessdate=21 December 2011[/tpl]
The London Chess Classic organising body "Chess Promotions Limited" confirmed that London were in negotiations to hold the World Chess Championships in 2012.[tpl]cite web |author=Mark Crowther – Tuesday 20 April 2010 |url=http://www.chess.co.uk/twic/chessnews/general/londons-option-for-wcc-2012-confirmed |title=London's option for WCC 2012 confirmed | The Week in Chess |publisher=Chess.co.uk |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=21 December 2011[/tpl]  However, after FIDE failed to agree to the terms of the contract within the time frame agreed upon, the option expired on 28 January 2011, and Chess Promotions Limited withdrew their bid to organise the event in London, citing the lack of time left to successfully organise the event.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/london-withdraws-bid-to-organize-2012-world-championship |title=London withdraws bid to organize 2012 World Championship |publisher=ChessVibes |accessdate=21 December 2011[/tpl]
As a result FIDE opened an application procedure for the hosting of the World Chess Championship match to be played from 10 April 2012 to 31 May 2012. Organisations interested in bidding to host the event had until 31 July 2011, 13:00 GMT to submit their documents including a bid fee.http://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2011/fide_news/World_Chmp_Match_2012/bid_procedure.pdf
On 28 June 2011, it was announced that Moscow had submitted a bid to host the 2012 World Chess Championship.[tpl]cite web|author=By mishanp on 28 June 2011 |url=http://www.chessintranslation.com/2011/06/moscow-bids-for-anand-gelfand-match |title=Moscow Bids for Anand-Gelfand match |publisher=Chessintranslation.com |date=28 June 2011 |accessdate=21 December 2011[/tpl]
On 13 July, the Tamil Nadu state government announced a bid of Rs 20 crore (Approx. $4.5 million) for the match to be held in Chennai, India. Chennai is the home city of the World Champion Viswanathan Anand.[tpl]cite web|title=Breaking news: World Championship 2012 in Chennai|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=7361|publisher=Chessbase|accessdate=14 July 2011|date=13 July 2011[/tpl] It was reported on 14 July that Minsk, Belarus was also interested in hosting this event.[tpl]cite web|title=Moscow, London, Minsk and Chennai appeal to hold Anand-Gelfand match|url=http://news.am/eng/news/67903.html|publisher=news.am|accessdate=26 July 2011|date=14 July 2011[/tpl]
In an interview with the Russian newspaper "Kommersant", dated 29 July, Boris Gelfand expressed his concern about the offer made by Chennai. Gelfand said the offer from Moscow was the only transparent one, he was not sure of the existence of financial guarantees by the Indian side. The Chennai offer was in Tamil language and he claimed it had not been translated in English. In the past, matches, including those of Kasparov against Ponomaryov and against Kasimdzanov were cancelled due to lack of financial guarantees.[tpl]cite web|author=Фото: Коммерсантъ |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1686965 |title=Ъ-Газета – "О том, что матч может пройти в Индии, я узнал из газет" |publisher=Kommersant.ru |accessdate=21 December 2011[/tpl]
On 2 August, FIDE announced that it received bids from the Russian chess federation (Moscow) and a second one from the All India chess federation (Chennai). Both were well above the minimum required prize fund. FIDE announced they would contact the bidders and players, and declare the winner of the bid by 10 August 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=World Championship Match 2012|url=http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/5442-world-championship-match-2012.html|publisher=FIDE|accessdate=2 August 2011|date=2 August 2011[/tpl]
Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, FIDE's president, told the Russian newspaper "Sport Express" that the financial offer was not the only criterion. Other factors, including the possibility of the propagation of the "chess in school" programme, and popularisation of chess in a particular region will also be considered. He would also take into account the views of the champion and the challenger.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.sport-express.ru/2011-08-03/453788/ |title=Новости. Шахматы.

==Games==

===Regular schedule===

====Game 1, Anand-Gelfand, ½–½====

====Game 2, Gelfand-Anand, ½–½====

Gelfand started his first game with White in the match by playing 1.d4 and the game went on to Slav Defence. The position in the game followed the game played between Kasparov and Gelfand in Linares in 1991 where Gelfand lost, but in this game the challenger opted a different line. Anand played several accurate moves to set up a good position for neutralising White's active pieces. After 19 moves were played Gelfand decided to exchange his knight for a bishop by 20.Nxf5 to avoid a presence of opposite coloured bishops, but the position afterwards appeared to be with no weaknesses and a well placed knight for Black. The game saw no progress on both sides and Gelfand offered a draw. At the press-conference he described the line he chose as "a slight symbolic edge".World Chess Championship tied at 1–1, The Week in Chess, 15 May 2012
Semi-Slav Defence, D45

====Game 3, Anand-Gelfand, ½–½====

The game opened with a Grünfeld Defence (as in the game 1), but Anand deviated very early by playing 3.f3 instead of 3.Nc3. Following the opening moves White gained an edge and was pawn up, but Anand ran into time trouble, having to play 7 moves per minute to reach the time control at move 40 and having missed the winning continuation in the double-rook ending.Anand-Gelfand Game 3 the liveliest so far, The Week in Chess, 16 May 2012
At move 20 White chose to capture correctly with 20.Nxf6, rather than 20.Rxd2 after which the continuation 20...Nxe4 21.fxe4 Bxd4 22.Rxd4 Rf2 23.e5 Bb5 gives Black strong counterplay.  In the next moves the game continued with 20...Rxf6! 21.Rxd2 Rf5 22.Bxg7 Kxg7 23.d6 (see diagram) and then 23 ...Rfc5?!. At the press-conference Gelfand said: "I understood the position was dangerous. I underestimated a few moves. I thought that 23...Rfc5 could win back the pawn, but I underestimated 24.Rd1 and here I had to fight for the draw. I was quite on edge for some time during the game." The game was drawn after 37 moves, as White could not find a line to play for a win. After the game Anand concisely said: "I came closer today."
Grünfeld Defence, D70

====Game 4, Gelfand-Anand, ½–½====

Semi-Slav Defence, D45

====Game 5, Anand-Gelfand, ½–½====

Anand started the game by switching the opening move to 1.e4 perhaps to sharpen the play, but Gelfand continued with Sicilian Sveshnikov instead of Sicilian Najdorf or Petroff Defence and the position arriving left the World Champion unprepared. The game reached a standard position after the theoretical moves in the opening, with a bind in the centre for White and a backward d6 pawn and weak d6 square for Black that is compensated with his activity. In the next moves Gelfand successfully equalised the position and left his opponent with minor chances. The game ended in a draw after 27 moves were played.Anand-Gelfand World Championship Game 5 another draw, The Week in Chess, 19 May 2012

====Game 6, Gelfand-Anand, ½–½====

Semi-Slav Defence, D45

====Game 7, Gelfand-Anand, 1–0====

Gelfand scored the first win of the match. Commentators considered 23...g5? to be the critical mistake, allowing Gelfand to get a winning position with 24 Qc7 Qxc7 25 Rxc7. Anand sacrificed his bishop for counterplay but it was not enough. In the final position, black can queen his pawn but cannot stop the threat of Ng6+ followed by Rg7 mate.World Championship G7 – Gelfand draws first blood and leads, Chessbase, 20 May 2012
Semi-Slav Defence, D45

====Game 8, Anand-Gelfand, 1–0====

Anand started the game with the same play as in the third game, but Gelfand early deviated by playing 3 ...c5 instead of 3 ...d5, which was seen in the game 3. The game was followed with 4.d5 d6 5.e4 Bg7 6.Ne2 0-0 7.Nec3 Nh5. Gelfand tried to provoke g4 by playing 7 ...Nh5, but Anand did not opt for that line. But after few moves the Black bishop occupied the f5 square and let White the opportunity to play 12.g4 with a fork on the Black's bishop and knight. The game continued with 12 ...Re8+ 13.Kd1 Bxb1 14.Rxb1.Sergey Shipov’s commentary on Anand-Gelfand, Game 8, Sergei Shipov, 22 May 2012 Gelfand made a serious error on move 14, overlooking Anand's 17 Qf2, which trapped Gelfand's queen. This idea was also missed by grandmaster commentators Peter Leko and Ian Nepomniachtchi, who preferred Black's position until Anand played 17 Qf2.World Championship G8 – Anand strikes back, wins in 17 moves!, Chessbase, 21 May 2012 Gelfand could have saved his queen by sacrificing his knight with 17...Nc6, but his position was still lost.
At only 17 moves, this was the shortest decisive game in World Championship history.Video commentary and impressions from Moscow, Chessbase, 23 May 2012
King's Indian Defence, E60

====Game 9, Gelfand-Anand, ½–½====

For the first time in the match Nimzo-Indian Defence was played. Gelfand obtained a slight edge in the opening by having a position with a bishop pair and hanging central pawns against two knights and a healthy pawn structure on the opposite side. Gelfand chose a concrete line in the middlegame that was criticized by several Grandmasters and exchanged a rook, bishop and pawn for the Anand's queen. However, Anand found a way to make a fortress and defended the game that was drawn after 49 moves as the longest game since the start of the match.Gelfand-Anand G9, a Nimzo-Indian, drawn after 49 moves (VIDEO), ChessVibes, 23 May 2012
Black played 15 ...Bxf3, which was evaluated to be a strange and unnecessary move, according to Peter Svidler. In the following moves White got a better position with a bishop pair and a mobile center. But, Black played 18 ...Qd6!? and provoked White to play 19.c5?!. The move was criticised in the press room and moves like 19.a3, proposed by Smirin or 19.h3, proposed by Grischuk and Shipov were probably better. The game entered an endgame with a queen for White and a rook, knight and a pawn for black. White was trying to play on the a7 pawn and to attack on the kingside, but Black appeared to have found the right evaluation in the end. He played 40 ...Ne4! before the time control, and the game was drawn after move 49.
Nimzo-Indian Defence, E54

====Game 10, Anand-Gelfand, ½–½====

Sicilian Defence, Rossolimo Attack, B30

====Game 11, Gelfand-Anand, ½–½====

The game started in a Nimzo-Indian Defence as in the game 9. First surprise of the game was at move 8, when Anand played 8 ...Bd7, a developing move with idea to bring the knight on the c6 square in the future. The instigator of this move was David Bronstein, but it was popular and played mostly during the middle of the 20th century.Sergey Shipov’s commentary on Anand-Gelfand, Game 11, Sergei Shipov, 27 May 2012
At move 17 (see diagram), Gelfand decided not to take a risk by playing 17.Ne5 instead of the more ambitious 17.Nd2 followed with 17 ...e5! and some complications. The position that arrived after the exchange of queens was slightly better for White, but with a huge safety for Black. Both players agreed to a draw after 24 moves were played.

Sicilian Defence, Rossolimo Attack, B30

===Tiebreak===

Anand retained the world title by defeating Gelfand in the rapid round. He was able to put time pressure on Gelfand in all four games. In the second game with white, Anand played his moves so fast that Gelfand was forced to make moves with very few seconds to spare.[tpl]cite web|url=http://susanpolgar.blogspot.in/2012/05/anand-gelfand-wc-playoff-game-2.html |title=Susan Polgar Chess Daily News and Information: Anand - Gelfand WC playoff game 2 |publisher=Susanpolgar.blogspot.in |date=9 April 2012 |accessdate=31 May 2012[/tpl]

The procedures for choosing the challenger and host underwent a number of changes and controversies. A timeline is shown below:
