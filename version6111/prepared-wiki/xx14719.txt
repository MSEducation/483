==Writings on computer security and general security==

In 1994, Schneier published Applied Cryptography, which details the design, use, and implementation of cryptographic algorithms. In 2010 he published Cryptography Engineering, which is focused more on how to use cryptography in real systems and less on its internal design. He has also written books on security for a broader audience. In 2000, Schneier published Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World, and in 2003, Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World. In 2012 Schneier published Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust that Society Needs to Thrive.
Schneier writes a freely available monthly Internet newsletter on computer and other security issues, Crypto-Gram, as well as a security weblog, Schneier on Security.schneier.com The weblog started out as a way to publish essays before they appeared in Crypto-Gram, making it possible for others to comment on them while the stories were still current, but over time the newsletter became a monthly email version of the blog, re-edited and re-organized.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.rebeccablood.net/bloggerson/bruceschneier.html |title= Bruce Schneier |accessdate= April 19, 2007 |last= Blood |first= Rebecca |date= January 2007 |work= Bloggers on Blogging[/tpl][tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] 
Schneier is frequently quoted in the press on computer and other security issues, pointing out flaws in security and cryptographic implementations ranging from biometrics to airline security after the September 11 attacks. He also writes "Security Matters", a regular column for Wired Magazine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/commentary/securitymatters | title=Security Matters | accessdate=March 10, 2008 | last=Schneier | first=Bruce | work=Wired Magazine[/tpl]
Schneier revealed on his blog that in the December 2004 issue of the SIGCSE Bulletin, three Pakistani academics, Khawaja Amer Hayat, Umar Waqar Anis, and S. Tauseef-ur-Rehman, from the International Islamic University in Islamabad, Pakistan, plagiarized an article written by Schneier and got it published.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/08/plagiarism_and.html |title=Schneier on Security: Plagiarism and Academia: Personal Experience |publisher=Schneier.com |date= |accessdate=June 9, 2009[/tpl] The same academics subsequently plagiarized another article by Ville Hallivuori on "Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) security" as well. Schneier complained to the editors of the periodical, which generated a minor controversy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlinenews.com.pk/details.php?id=85519 |title=ONLINE – International News Network |publisher=Onlinenews.com.pk |date=June 9, 2007 |accessdate=June 9, 2009[/tpl] The editor of the SIGCSE Bulletin removed the paper from their website and demanded official letters of admission and apology. Schneier noted on his blog that International Islamic University personnel had requested him "to close comments in this blog entry"; Schneier refused to close comments on the blog, but he did delete posts which he deemed "incoherent or hostile".

==Viewpoints==

===Cryptography===

To Schneier, peer review and expert analysis are important for the security of cryptographic systems.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.schneier.com/essay-037.html |title=Why Cryptography Is Harder Than It Looks |year=1997 |author=Schneier, Bruce |accessdate=2011-04-08[/tpl] Mathematical cryptography is usually not the weakest link in a security chain; effective security requires that cryptography be combined with other things.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.schneier.com/book-practical-preface.html |title=Practical Cryptography: Preface |author=Ferguson, Niels; Schneier, Bruce |accessdate=2011-04-08[/tpl]
The term Schneier's law was coined by Cory Doctorow in his speech about Digital Rights Management for Microsoft Research,[tpl]cite web |author=Cory Doctorow |date=2004-06-17 |title=Microsoft Research DRM talk |url=http://www.dashes.com/anil/stuff/doctorow-drm-ms.html |accessdate=2006-12-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061202192720/http://www.dashes.com/anil/stuff/doctorow-drm-ms.html  |archivedate = 2006-12-02[/tpl] which is included in his 2008 book Content: Selected Essays on Technology, Creativity, Copyright, and the Future of the Future. The law is phrased as:
He attributes this to Bruce Schneier, presumably making reference to his book Applied Cryptography, although the principle predates its publication. In The Codebreakers, David Kahn states:
Similarly, in A Few Words On Secret Writing in Graham's Magazine (July 1841), Edgar Allan Poe stated

===DRM===

Schneier is critical of digital rights management (DRM) and has said that it allows a vendor to increase lock-in.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.schneier.com/essay-204.html |title=With iPhone, 'Security' Is Code for 'Control' |date=2008-02-07 |author=Schneier, Bruce |accessdate=2011-04-08[/tpl] Proper implementation of control-based security for the user via trusted computing is very difficult, and security is not the same thing as control.

===Homeland security===

Schneier has said that homeland security money should be spent on intelligence, investigation, and emergency response.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2005/09/68789 |title=Terrorists Don't Do Movie Plots |date=2005-09-08 |publisher=Wired News |author=Schneier, Bruce[/tpl] Defending against the broad threat of terrorism is generally better than focusing on specific potential terrorist plots. According to Schneier, analysis of intelligence data is difficult but is one of the better ways to deal with global terrorism.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.schneier.com/essay-032.html |title=Homeland Insecurity |date=2004-01-09 |author=Schneier, Bruce |accessdate=2011-04-08[/tpl] Human intelligence has advantages over automated and computerized analysis, and increasing the amount of intelligence data that is gathered does not help to improve the analysis process. Agencies that were designed around fighting the Cold War may have a culture that inhibits the sharing of information; the practice of sharing information is more important and less of a security threat in itself when dealing with more decentralized and poorly funded adversaries such as al Qaeda.[tpl]cite web |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-01-15/bay-area/17828460_1_intelligence-homeland-security-organizations |author=Schneier, Bruce |publisher=SFGate |date=2010-01-15 |accessdate=2011-04-08 |title=Fixing intelligence failures – SFGate[/tpl]
Regarding PETN—the explosive that has become terrorists' weapon of choice—Schneier has written that only swabs and dogs can detect it. He also believes that changes to airport security since 11 September 2001 have done more harm than good and he defeated Kip Hawley, former head of the Transportation Security Administration, in an Economist online debate by 87% to 13% regarding the issue."International terrorism: AQAP tries again: Good intelligence work still leaves questions over airport security", The Economist, dated 12 May 2012.
As a Fellow of Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, Schneier is exploring the intersection of security, technology, and people, with an emphasis on power.[tpl]cite web | url=https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/newsroom/2013_2014_community | title=Berkman Center Announces 2013–2014 Community | publisher=Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University | date=July 8, 2013 | accessdate=8 July 2013[/tpl]

===System design===

Schneier has criticized security approaches that try to prevent any malicious incursion, instead arguing that designing systems to fail well is more important.Homeland Insecurity, Atlantic Monthly, September 2002 The designer of a system should not underestimate the capabilities of an attacker; technology may make it possible in the future to do things that are not possible at the present. Under Kerckhoffs's Principle, the need for one or more parts of a cryptographic system to remain secret increases the fragility of the system; whether details about a system should be obscured depends upon the availability of persons who can make use of the information for beneficial uses versus the potential for attackers to misuse the information.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0205.html |title=Crypto-Gram: May 15, 2002 |date=2002-05-15 |author=Schneier, Bruce |accessdate=2011-04-08[/tpl]

===Full disclosure===

Schneier is a proponent of full disclosure, i.e. making security issues public.
