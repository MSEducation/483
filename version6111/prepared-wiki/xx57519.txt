==History==

===Amateur era (1891–1931)===

Club Atlético Peñarol was founded on 28 September 1891 by employees of the English-owned Central Uruguay Railway Company of Montevideo (CUR), which had operated in Uruguay since 1878. Of the company's 118 employees 72 were English, 45 were Uruguayan and one was German.[tpl]cite web |author= Emilio Tacconi |year = 2009 |url = http://www.raicesuruguay.com/2012_02/barrio_penarol.html |title= Historia del barrio "Peñarol" |editor = Revista Raíces |accessdate = 9 October 2011|language=spanish[/tpl] The club was known as CURCC or Peñarol—the latter from the Peñarol neighbourhood, about [tpl]convert|10|km[/tpl] from Montevideo, whose name in turn derived from an Italian city. The club's first president Frank Henderson, who remained in that position until 1899.[tpl]cite web |author= |year = 2001 |url = http://www.correo.com.uy/index.asp?codpag=detProd&smen=filatelia&idp=648&s=1 |title= 110 Años del Club Atlético Peñarol |editor = Administración Nacional de Correos |accessdate = 27 January 2010|language=spanish[/tpl]
In 1892, the CURCC shifted its focus from cricket and rugby to football.[tpl]cite web|title=... Y llegó a los 120|url=http://www.urugol.com/todas-las-noticias/35-primera-division/16284-y-llego-a-los-120|editor=urugol.com|date=28 September 2011|accessdate=4 March 2012|language=spanish[/tpl] The football club's first game was against a team of students from the English high school and ended with a 2–0 victory. In 1895, Uruguayan footballer Julio Negrón was chosen as the team's first non-English captain.
In 1900 the CURCC was one of four charter members of the Uruguay Association Football League,[tpl]cite web |author= Edgardo de Léon; Walter Zunino |year = 2008 |url = http://iffhs.de/?42a06fe3803e23c0ba7615caf2c17e33e10f72017f7370eff3702bb0a35bb6d28fb3c0ce52d00e07 |title= Uruguay – 1900 season |editor = IFFHS |accessdate = 25 January 2010[/tpl] making its debut in official competition on 10 June against Albion Football Club and winning 2–1.[tpl]cite web |author= Juan Carlos Luzuriaga |year = 2008 |url = http://www.efdeportes.com/efd120/albion-football-club-profetas-del-sport-en-uruguay.htm |title= Albion Football Club: profetas del sport en Uruguay |editor = EFE deportes Revista Digital – Buenos Aires – Año 13 – N° 120 |accessdate = 25 January 2010|language=spanish[/tpl] The club won its first Uruguayan championship that year, repeating in 1901, 1905 and 1907. In 1906 Charles W. Bayne took over the railroad, and refused to sponsor the football team due to financial and work issues. Conflict between the company and the football club led to the severance of their relationship in 1913.[tpl]cite web |author= Ana Ribeiro; Raúl Cheda; Silvia Sosa; José Carlos Tuñas; Alejandra Carnejo; Malte Fernández; Leonardo Haberkom |year = 2008 |url = http://www.montevideo.com.uy/barriopenarol/Barrio_Penarol_Patrimonio_Industrial_cap3-6.pdf |title= Barrio Peñarol – Patrimonio industrial ferroviario |editor = Intendencia Municipal de Montevideo |accessdate = 25 January 2010|language=spanish[/tpl]
In 1908, the club left the Uruguayan league after the league rejected their request to replay a game with F.C. Dublín. CURCC had lost 2–3 on the road, and believed their poor showing was due to refereeing mistakes caused by pressure from rabid home fans. Back in competition the following year, relations between the CUR and the club became frostier after fans burned a train car used for rival teams.
A year after the club's 1911 Uruguayan championship, the club attempted reforms to its policies. Proposals included greater participation by non-CUR players and a name change to "CURCC Peñarol". In June 1913, the proposals were rejected; the company wanted to distance itself from the club's local reputation. The CURCC approved a November sale of the football club, and on 13 December 1913 the club separated completely from the company (but kept the name "CURCC Peñarol").[tpl]cite book|last= Álvarez|first= Luciano|title= Historia de Peñarol|accessdate=16 October 2010|year= 2010|publisher= Aguilar|location= Montevideo|page= 965|language=spanish[/tpl]

CURCC Peñarol is the official continuation of the club founded in 1891, a version accepted by FIFA, UEFA and Conmebol. The club was congratulated on its 120th anniversary in September 2011 by presidents Joseph Blatter, Michel Platini[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.ultimasnoticias.com.uy/Edicion-UN/articulos/prints-2011set26/dep08.html|title= Jugar con Torres me da otro aire y facilita muchas cosas|editor= Unoticias.com.uy|date= 26 September 2011|accessdate= 26 September 2011|language=spanish[/tpl] and Nicolás Leoz.[tpl]cite web|title= La Conmebol congratula a Peñarol en su 120º aniversario|url= http://www.conmebol.com/futbolmasculino/La-Conmebol-congratula-a-Pearol-en-su-120-aniversario-20110927-0002.html|editor= Conmebol.com|date= 28 September 2011|accessdate= 21 November 2011|language=spanish[/tpl] However, Nacional fans contend that CURCC Peñarol was distinct from the older club.
On 12 March 1914 CURCC changed its name to Club Atlético Peñarol, a change submitted to the Uruguayan Football League two days later and approved the following day. During its first years under the new name Peñarol was not successful, although a new stadium (Las Acacias) opened on 19 May 1916.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.lr21.com.uy/deportes/272501-un-estadio-que-lleva-su-nombre|title= Un estadio que lleva su nombre|editor= La República|date= 26 August 2007|accessdate= 16 July 2009|language=spanish[/tpl] The club won its first two league titles under the new name in 1918 and 1920.
In November 1922 the Asociación Uruguaya de Fútbol (AUF) disqualified Peñarol because the club played an exhibition game with the Racing Club de Avellaneda, a club affiliated with the Asociación Amateurs de Football in Argentina and not the Asociación Argentina de Football.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.futbolea.com/squad.php?tid=2 |title= Club Atlético Peñarol: Historial del Club|editor = Futbolea.com |accessdate = 14 February 2011|language=spanish[/tpl] Peñarol and other clubs then organised a new league, the Federación Uruguaya de Football, and the club won the 1924 championship. The league was short-lived; Peñarol won the 1926 Copa del Consejo Provisorio, triggering a merger between the AUF and the FUF.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.lr21.com.uy/deportes/116656-tres-equipos-amateurs-ganaron-todos-los-puntos|title= Tres equipos amateurs ganaron todos los puntos|editor= La República|date= 11 June 2003|accessdate= 16 July 2009|language=spanish[/tpl]
After its first European tour in 1927, Peñarol won the Uruguayan championship in 1928 and 1929; the following year, the club defeated Olimpia 1–0 in its first game at the Centenario Stadium in Montevideo.
 

===Professional era (1932–present)===

In 1932, Peñarol and River Plate played the first game of the professional era.

In 1970 the club again reached the Libertadores final again, losing to Estudiantes de La Plata. The club set a tournament record for greatest goal difference, defeating Valencia of Venezuela 11–2. With Fernando Morena as the team's star, the club won the Uruguayan championship for three consecutive years, from 1973–1975. After placing second in 1976 and 1977, Peñarol won again in 1978.

With Pablo Bengoechea and the young Antonio Pacheco on the team and Gregorio Pérez behind the bench, Peñarol again won the Uruguayan championship five straight times (1993–1997). The club also reached the Copa Conmebol final in 1994 and 1995, rounding out the century with a national championship in 1999 (defeating Nacional 2–1 in the final, despite Julio Ribas on the bench).
The next year, Peñarol lost the Uruguayan championship final against Nacional; many of the team's players were jailed after a tournament fight.[tpl]cite web|url= http://elpais.com/diario/2000/12/02/deportes/975711620_850215.html|title= Del césped a la cárcel|editor= ElPais.com|date= 12 December 2000|accessdate= 29 January 2011|language=spanish[/tpl] Peñarol won the national championship again in 2003 for Diego Aguirre, defeating Nacional in the final.

==Crest and colors==

===Badge===

Throughout the club's history minor changes have been made to its symbols, but it has kept its original colors. The shield and flag were designed by architect Constante Facello and consist of five black stripes, four yellow stripes and eleven yellow stars on a black background (representing the eleven players).[tpl]cite web|title= Peñarol – Historia|url= http://www.futboldeaca.com/equipos.php?equipo=28&option=historia|editor= futboldeaca.com|accessdate= 29 February 2012|language=spanish[/tpl]

====Badge evolution====

===Uniform===

Since its founding, Peñarol's colors have been yellow and black. They were inspired by the Rocket locomotive designed by George Stephenson, which won an award in 1829.
The first jersey was a plain shirt, divided into four square sections which alternated black and yellow.[tpl]cite web|title=La noche inolvidable de Peñarol|url=http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/210191/la-noche-inolvidable-de-penarol/|editor=elobservador.com.uy|date=28 September 2011|accessdate=3 March 2012|language=spanish[/tpl] A variant had two vertical halves (black on the right and black-and-yellow stripes on the left), with black shorts and socks. Peñarol's official jersey (black and yellow stripes) dates back to 1911[tpl]cite web|editor=Girasolweb.com|url=http://girasolweb.tripod.com/camiseta.htm |title=Camisetas |accessdate=10 April 2011|language=spanish[/tpl] and has been worn almost continuously, with only slight variations.[tpl]cite web|url= http://todosobrecamisetas.blogspot.com/2010/01/penarol-presenta-sus-nuevas-camisetas.html|title= Peñarol Presenta sus Nuevas Camisetas Puma para el 2010|accessdate=21 February 2011|date= 21 January 2010|author= todosobrecamisetas.net|language=spanish[/tpl]
The first alternate uniform is believed to have been a squared jersey, similar to the club's first main shirt but with orange instead of yellow. In 1984 a jersey with horizontal stripes (instead of vertical) was worn, and 1987 featured a yellow jersey with black shorts. Other alternate uniforms (used recently) have been completely black, grey or yellow. Special jerseys have been worn for international friendlies, especially during the 1960s. The CURCC's main uniform (with two halves, one plain and one striped) is used as a third uniform. On 4 February 2013 all-black and all-yellow alternate uniforms were introduced.[tpl]cite web|title= El aurinegro presentó sus pilchas nuevas|url= http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/242930/el-aurinegro-presento-sus-pilchas-nuevas/|editor= ElObservador.com.uy|date= 5 February 2013|accessdate= 5 February 2013|language=spanish[/tpl]

==Supporters==

In Uruguayan football, loyalty to Peñarol or Nacional divides the country. The clubs are evenly matched, and have a large fan base. Many surveys of public opinion have been conducted, but none have been conclusive. In 1993 the Factum consulting firm reported that Peñarol was the favorite team of 41 percent of football fans, while 38 percent supported Nacional.[tpl]cite web |author= Juan Carlos Luzuriaga |year = 2005 |url = http://www.efdeportes.com/efd88/uruguay.htm |title= La forja de la rivalidad clásica: Nacional-Peñarol en el Montevideo del 900 |editor = EFE deportes Revista Digital – Buenos Aires – Año 10 – N° 88 |accessdate = 16 July 2009|language=spanish[/tpl] Factum conducted another survey in 2006, confirming its previous results: Peñarol with 45 percent and Nacional with 35 percent.[tpl]cite web |author= |year = 2006 |url = http://www2.factum.edu.uy/encuesoc/futsport/2006/fut06001.html |title= Peñarol no es la mitad más uno |editor = El Observador |accessdate = 16 July 2009|language=spanish[/tpl]

===Fan club===

In 2010 the club attempted to increase its fan base to improve its sustainability. During Clausura 2010 promotions were offered, marketing managers hired and the peñas (local fan clubs) encouraged.

===Rivalries===

The Uruguayan Derby between Peñarol and Nacional goes back to 1900, the oldest football rivalry outside the British Islands.[tpl]cite web |author= |year = 2009 |url = http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/stories/classicderby/news/newsid=1060659.html |title= Peñarol – Nacional, una rivalidad única |editor = FIFA|accessdate = 29 July 2009|language=spanish[/tpl] The first game ever played was on 15 July 1900 and ended 2–0 in favor of CURCC. Peñarol was ahead at first, but Nacional caught up during the late 1910s. This rivalry continued; Nacional took the lead by fourteen games in 1948, and would not surrender it until the late 1970s (except briefly in 1968). Since then, Peñarol has been the leader; its longest lead was 26 games in January 2004.[tpl]cite web |author= Martín Tabeira |year = 2008 |url = http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/uru-derbies.html |title= Uruguayan Derby – Peñarol vs. Nacional |editor = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation (RSSSF) |accessdate = 2007[/tpl] Including the amateur and professional eras, league and friendly games, the teams have met 511 times in the past with 182 victories to Peñarol, 166 to Nacional and 163 ties.
A notable game for Peñarol fans is occurred on 9 October 1949 in the Uruguayan Cup first round, and is known as the Clásico de la fuga (the "escape derby"). At the end of the first half Peñarol was leading 2–0, but at halftime Nacional decided not to return. While Peñarol fans believe that Nacional did not want to be defeated by a Peñarol team known as the Máquina del 49 ("Machine of 49"), Nacional supporters claim it was a protest against poor officiating.[tpl]cite web|url= http://elobservador.com.uy/noticia/236640/el-dia-que-nacional-se-retiro/|title= El día que Nacional se retiró|accessdate= 21 February 2011|editor= ElObservador.com.uy|language=spanish[/tpl]
On 23 April 1987 Peñarol and Nacional were tied 1–1 with 22 minutes remaining when three Peñarol players (José Perdomo, José Herrera and Ricardo Viera) were ejected after a foul and subsequent protests. Peñarol then had to face a full Nacional team with only eight players on the pitch. With eight minutes remaining Diego Aguirre set up Jorge Cabrera, who scored the winning goal. This win by the aurinegro was known as the Clásico de los 8 contra 11 (the "8 against 11 derby").[tpl]cite web|title= Una fecha especial|url= http://www.ovaciondigital.com.uy/110423/futnac-561802/futbolnacional/una-fecha-especial/|author= ovaciondigital.com.uy|date= 23 April 2011|accessdate= 20 August 2011|language=spanish[/tpl]
Peñarol and Nacional have faced each other in the final game of the Uruguayan Championship twelve times, with Peñarol winning eight. The most recent was in May 2010, when Peñarol won the championship 2–1.

==Administration==

During a meeting presided over by Roland Moor on 28 September 1891, it was stipulated that responsibility for the Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club would belong to the principal administrator of the Central Uruguay Railway Company of Montevideo. The first president of the club was Frank Henderson, who remained in that office until 1899.
After Henderson CUR administrators remained as chairmen of the sports club until 1906, when Charles W. Bayne took over the CUR. Bayne refused to sponsor the CURCC because of vandalism by fans and absenteeism by workers. He was replaced by CUR employee Roland Moor.
Conflicts remained between the company and the sports club, which resulted in the separation of CURCC's football section from the company and a name change to Club Atlético Peñarol. Jorge Clulow, an Englishman with Uruguayan nationality, was chosen chairman of the club; he remained in office from 1914 to 1915.[tpl]cite book|last= Morales|first= Franklin|title= El libro de oro del centenario de Peñarol|accessdate=16 October 2010|year= 1991|publisher= Aguilar|location= Montevideo|page= 11|language=spanish[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Mantrana Garlín|title=Por la verdad|location=Montevideo|page= 11|language=spanish[/tpl]
