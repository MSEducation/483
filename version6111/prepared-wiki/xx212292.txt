[tpl]Nihongo|Masahiko Kimura|木村 正彦|Kimura Masahiko|1940-  [/tpl] was born in Ōmiya-ku, Saitama, Japan on March 31, 1940 and is a widely recognized bonsai master. He is not related to the judo practitioner also named Masahiko Kimura.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webecoist.com/2009/06/09/tree-art-6-amazingly-creative-bonsai-artists/  |title= Tree Art: 6 Amazingly Creative Bonsai Artists |publisher=WebEcoist |date= |accessdate=2009-11-18[/tpl]  
His father died when Masahiko was 11. By the wishes of his mother, at age 15 he started spending his time as an apprentice under the bonsai master Motosuke Hamano of Toju-en Bonsai Garden. This was for eleven years until about 1966.  (Kimura would later say that during his teens he really wanted to be a rock and roll musician.)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.artofbonsai.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=942 |title= Art of Bonsai Profile: Masahiko Kimura |publisher=The Art of Bonsai Project |date= |accessdate=2009-11-18[/tpl][ref]

He went on to become known as the "Magical Technician of Kindai Shuppan."[tpl]cite journal | author=Urbanski, Kay | title=The World of Masahiko Kimura |journal=ABS Bonsai Journal |year=1991| volume=25 | pages=12–14 | issue=4[/tpl]  (Kimura has said that he personally doesn't really care for the title of "Magician.")[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.artofbonsai.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=942 |title= Art of Bonsai Profile: Masahiko Kimura |publisher=The Art of Bonsai Project |accessdate=2009-11-18[/tpl]  His breathtaking sculpting and styling of trees on behalf of that Kyoto bonsai magazine publisher was done using hand and power tools of his own design. His skill with carving deadwood quickly made him well known in the bonsai community.  While his work was at first highly controversial, his energy and vision soon became as respected as his art. A characteristic of his trees is a defined interplay of artistically sculptured deadwood with a smaller amount of more traditionally appearing live wood snaking up from the soil to foliage apex. Many of his trees have a more elaborate starkness than is ordinarily found in the wild, innovatively creative without historic model.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bonsaipots.net/index.php?page=art-and-kimura |title=Bonsai, Art and Kimura by Gunter Lind |publisher=bonsaipots.net|accessdate=2009-11-18[/tpl]
Because of Kimura's willingness to break with convention, many in Japan refused to take him seriously, at least in the early years. Nowadays, no one disputes Kimura's genius or his pioneering position in the bonsai world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bonsaitrees.com/detail.php?id=710 |title=The Magician: The Bonsai Art of Kimura 2 |publisher=DaSu Bonsai Studios |accessdate=2009-11-18[/tpl] The sometimes controversial author and videotape producer has traveled in many countries, doing presentations and demonstrations.  He first demonstrated and conducted a workshop outside of Japan at the 1987 Golden State Federation Bonsai Convention in Anaheim, California. Kimura has demonstrated at these other major conventions, among others: Golden State Bonsai Federation (1990 Burlingame and 2006 Sacramento); World Bonsai Friendship Federation (1989 Omiya, Japan and 1997 Seoul, Korea); European Bonsai Association (1990 Turin, Italy and 1992 Luxembourg); Bonsai Clubs International (1992 Memphis, Tennessee, 1996 Washington, D.C. and 2006 Foshan City, China); American Bonsai Society Symposium (2000 Detroit, Michigan); Asia-Pacific Bonsai and Suiseki Exhibition and Convention (2003 Manila, Philippines and 2011 Takamatsu, Japan); Federatión Latino Americana de Bonsai (2003 Caracas, Venezuela); and Association of Australian Clubs (2005 Sydney).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phoenixbonsai.com/Conventions.html |title=Bonsai Conventions & Symposia |publisher=Phoenixbonsai.com |accessdate=2009-11-18[/tpl]
