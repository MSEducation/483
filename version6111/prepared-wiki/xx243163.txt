==Response==

Tim Walker, the Sunday Telegraph critic, gave it five stars, drawing parallels with the plot to that of King Lear. "While it isn't done any more to say this in the financial pages, I say it here with conviction: Enron is a strong buy," he wrote.[ref]

Review of reviews, 'Enron'
In The New York Times review of the Broadway production, Ben Brantley wrote, contrary to some other critics, "even with a well-drilled cast that includes bright Broadway headliners like Norbert Leo Butz and Marin Mazzie, the realization sets in early that this British-born exploration of smoke-and-mirror financial practices isn’t much more than smoke and mirrors itself. Enron is fast-paced, flamboyant and, despite the head-clogging intricacy of its business mathematics, lucid to the point of simple-mindedness. But as was true of the company of this play's title, the energy generated here often feels factitious, all show (or show and tell) and little substance."Brantley, Ben."Theater Review | 'Enron':Titans of Tangled Finances Kick Up Their Heels Again"The New York Times, 28 April 2010
Michael Billington, critic for The Guardian, dubbed Brantley's comments an "obtuse and hostile review",[tpl]cite web|author= Michael Billington |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2010/may/05/enron-broadway-close-early |title= Enron's failure shows Broadway's flaws |publisher=The Guardian |date= 5 May 2008 |accessdate= 2 August 2010[/tpl] stating that "Enron[tpl]'[/tpl]s fate was sealed the moment Brantley's review appeared ... As a fellow critic, I respect Brantley's right to his opinion; what is dismaying is his failure to see what Prebble and Goold were up to ... But no serious play on Broadway can survive a withering attack from The New York Times, which carries the force of a papal indictment".
