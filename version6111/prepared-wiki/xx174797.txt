The serial focused on a law firm that was dealing with a high profile murder case throughout its 127-episode run.
Some of the show's stars were Conard Fowkes, Louise Shaffer, Tony Lo Bianco, Stephen Joyce, Rita Gam,and a very young Linda Blair.

==Broadcast history==

Hidden Faces replaced Let's Make a Deal at 1:30 PM (12:30 Central) after disputes between NBC and Deal packagers Stefan Hatos and Monty Hall caused Deal to move to ABC. Facing the ABC Deal and CBS' As the World Turns, Hidden performed poorly and, unusual for daytime serials in that era, was pulled after only six months in favor of the Bill Leyden-hosted game You're Putting Me On.
Hidden Faces was the first of eight programs that NBC put in Deal's timeslot between its departure and the expansion of Days of our Lives to an hour on April 21, 1975. Of those eight shows, only Three on a Match lasted longer than a year.
