Juan Alberto Andreu Alvarado, aka Melli ([tpl]IPA-es|ˈmeʎi[/tpl]; born 6 June 1984), is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for FC Sheriff Tiraspol in Moldova. A versatile defender, he can appear as either a right or a central defender.

==Club career==

Born in Barbate, Cádiz, Melli joined Real Betis as a 14-year-old, and made his way up through the ranks until he reached the reserve team in 2001. He served a small loan stint at Andalusia neighbours Polideportivo Ejido in the late stages of the 2001–02 season, with two appearances in the second division.
Melli scored his first career goal through a header from a Joaquín corner kick, against CA Osasuna on 18 September 2004 (2–3 away loss). He also appeared in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup during the 2005–06 campaign: in the latter he netted an essential goal at AZ Alkmaar, which allowed Betis to progress into the next round –Melli swoops to revive Betisthis came just one week after having scored two unfortunate own goals against FC Barcelona in a La Liga match at the Camp Nou.Blistering Barça back in the groove
Melli won his first medal for Betis during the 2005 final of the Copa del Rey against Osasuna at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, on 11 June 2005, playing the full 90 minutes plus extra time in an eventual 2–1 win. He continued to be a defensive presence in the following seasons for the Verdiblancos, playing an average of 25 league games and suffering relegation in 2008–09.
In late August 2011, after another relegation, now with CD Tenerife (in the second division) whom he joined in the 2010 summer – a second consecutive for the Canary Islands club – Melli moved abroad for the first time and signed a two-year contract for K.A.A. Gent in Belgium, joining compatriot César Arzo.
