Combat side stroke or CSS is a variation of the side stroke that was developed by and taught to the United States Navy SEALs.
The Combat Swimmer Stroke is a relaxing and very efficient swim stroke that is an updated version of the traditional sidestroke. The CSS is a mix of sidestroke, freestyle and breaststroke. The combat side stroke allows the swimmer to swim more efficiently and reduce the body's profile in the water in order to be less likely to be seen during combat operations if surface swimming is required. The concept of CSS has been that it can be used with or without wearing swim fins (flippers), the only difference being that when wearing swim fins the swimmer's legs will always be kicking in the regular flutter kick motion without the scissor kick. This stroke is one of the strokes that can be used for prospective SEAL candidates in the SEAL Physical Screening Test (PST), which includes a 500 yard swim in 12 minutes 30 seconds to determine if the candidate is suitable to go to the Basic Underwater Demolitions/SEAL school.

==Basics==

The combat side stroke utilizes the three main fundamentals of swimming:

==Side stroke variants==

There are two forms to the combat side stroke: the full combat side stroke and the combat sprinter side stroke. The sprinter side stroke allows the swimmer to move faster in the water compared to the full side stroke.[tpl]cn|date=October 2013[/tpl][tpl]OR|date=October 2013[/tpl]

===Full side stroke===

The swimmer starts with the body flat and arms in a fully extended position in the water, facing downward, legs flutter kicking. One arm then pulls down in the water to the side of the body, at the same time the body rotates and the head takes a breath to the side. The second arm then pulls down with the arm to the side of the body, and the head moves back facing the bottom of the pool, enabling the body to stay horizontal in the water. The hands move forward fully extended in front of the head while simultaneously performing a scissor kicking motion cork-screwing the body back to being flat in the water.

===Sprinter side stroke===

The only difference between the full side stroke and sprinter side stroke is instead of bringing the second lead arm fully down to the side of the body the arm will only half stroke; the arm moves halfway towards the body and is then brought back to the fully extended position.
