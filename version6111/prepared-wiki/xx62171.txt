NRG Astrodome, also known as the Houston Astrodome or simply the Astrodome, is the world's first multi-purpose, domed sports stadium, located in Houston, Texas, USA. The stadium is part of the Reliant Park complex. It opened in 1965 as Harris County Domed Stadium and was nicknamed the "Eighth Wonder of the World".Barks, Joseph V. "Powering the (new and improved) 'Eighth Wonder of the World' ", Electrical Apparatus, November 2001. Retrieved January 16, 2007. In 2001, it hosted WWE (then known as WWF) WrestleMania X-Seven, which set an all-time record attendance for the Reliant Astrodome of 67,925. Parts of it were demolished in 2013, after several years of disuse. In 2014 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

===Conception===

Major League Baseball expanded to Houston in 1960 when the National League agreed to add two teams. The Colt .45s (renamed the Houston Astros in 1965) were to begin play in 1962, along with their expansion brethren New York Mets. Roy Hofheinz, a former mayor of Houston, and his group were granted the franchise after they promised to build a covered stadium. It was thought a covered stadium was a must for a major league team to be viable in Houston due to the area's subtropical climate and hot summers. Game-time temperatures are usually above [tpl]Convert|97|F|C|0[/tpl] in July and August, with high humidity and a likelihood of rain. Hofheinz claimed inspiration for what became the Astrodome when he was on a tour of Rome, where he learned that the builders of the ancient Colosseum installed giant velaria to shield spectators from the Roman sun.
The Astrodome was conceived by Hofheinz as early as 1952, when he and his daughter Dene were rained out once too often at Buffalo Stadium, home of Houston's minor league baseball team, the Houston Buffs. Hofheinz abandoned his interest in the world's first air-conditioned shopping mall, The Galleria, and set his sights on bringing major league baseball to Houston.
The Astrodome was later designed by architects Hermon Lloyd & W. B. Morgan, and Wilson, Morris, Crain and Anderson. Structural engineering and structural design was performed by Walter P Moore Engineers and Consultants of Houston. It was constructed by H. A. Lott, Inc. for Harris County, Texas. It stands 18 stories tall, covering [tpl]Convert|9.5|acre[/tpl]. The dome is [tpl]Convert|710|ft[/tpl] in diameter and the ceiling is [tpl]Convert|208|ft[/tpl] above the playing surface, which itself sits [tpl]Convert|25|ft[/tpl] below street level.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-statistics.com/Ballparks/Hou/Astrodome.htm |title=Houston Astros - Stadium |publisher=Baseball-statistics.com |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013[/tpl]
The Dome was completed in November 1964, six months ahead of schedule.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Prominent-Houstonians-ideas-on-what-to-do-with-1683126.php |title=Prominent Houstonians' ideas on what to do with Dome - Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date=April 4, 2011 |accessdate=April 2, 2013[/tpl] Many engineering changes were required during construction, including the modest flattening of the supposed "hemispherical roof" to cope with environmentally-induced structural deformation and the use of a new paving process called "lime stabilization" to cope with changes in the chemistry of the soil. The air conditioning system was designed by Houston mechanical engineers Israel A. Naman and Jack Boyd Buckley of I. A. Naman + Associates.
The multi-purpose stadium, designed to facilitate both football and baseball, is nearly circular and uses movable lower seating areas. It also ushered in the era of other fully domed stadiums, such as the Pontiac Silverdome near Detroit and the the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, as well as the the now-demolished Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Kingdome in Seattle, and RCA Dome in Indianapolis.
To test what effect the enclosed air-conditioned environment might have on the delivery of breaking balls, Satchel Paige, in full Astros uniform, threw the first pitches at the Astrodome on February 7, 1965.[tpl]cite news |title=Dome is Hurlers' Heaven |publisher=The San Bernardino Sun |date=April 11, 1965 |page=69[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=No Real Difference: Baseball Won't Change Indoors |author=Tagliabue, Emil |publisher=Corpus Christi Caller-Times |date=February 11, 1965 |page=24[/tpl] He later concluded that it was a "pitcher's paradise," as the lack of wind allowed for sensitive pitches to maneuver more easily.
Hofheinz had an opulent apartment in the Dome, which was removed when the facility was remodeled in 1988.Conniff, Richard  Farewell To An Odd Dome Home Judge Hofheinz's private Astrodome quarters will soon be just a gaudy memory. Sports Illustrated March 14, 1988, Retrieved November 11, 2009.

===Seating capacity===

The seating capacity for baseball has been as follows:
The seating capacity for football has been as follows:

====Initial opening====

On Opening Day, April 9, 1965, a sold-out crowd of 47,879 watched an exhibition game between the Houston Astros and the New York Yankees. President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird were in attendance, as well as Texas Governor John Connally and Houston Mayor Louie Welch. Governor Connally tossed out the first ball for the first game ever played indoors. Dick "Turk" Farrell of the Astros threw the first pitch. Mickey Mantle had both the first hit (a single) and the first home run in the Astrodome. The Astros beat the Yankees that night, 2-1.
President Johnson arrived to pay his respects to baseball and Astros President Roy Hofheinz, a campaign manager for Johnson in the 1940s, just as the second inning got underway; the President stopping at the Astrodome that evening en route to his home in Johnson City. He and Lady Bird watched the opening night game from behind the glass in Judge Hofheinz' private box high in right field just to the right of the giant scoreboard. LBJ ate hors d'ouerves and chicken and ice cream while watching the game. "Roy, I want to congratulate you; it shows so much imagination," he was heard to say. Later, he called the stadium "massive" and "beautiful." Although the President's visit overshadowed all others, dignitaries swarmed through the "Eighth Wonder of the World" during the three days of the exhibition series and for opening night against the Phillies."Bob Hulsey (April 9, 1965). [tpl]cite web |url = http://www.astrosdaily.com/history/19650409/|title = First Game In The Astrodome: The Indoor Era Begins[/tpl]AstrosDaily.John Wilson (April 24, 1965).

The first artist to play the Astrodome was Judy Garland on December 17, 1965, where she was paid $43,000 for the one show. The Supremes were her opening act and tickets were priced $1.00 to $7.50. The dome seated 48,000, with another 12,000 seats added for this show. Garland appeared on stage at 10 p.m. and sang for 40 minutes, with her set of songs including: "He's Got The Whole World In His Hands"; "Just In Time"; "My Kind Of Town, Houston Is"/"Houston"; "As Long As He Needs Me"; "Joey, Joey, Joey"; "Do It Again"; "What Now My Love?"; "By Myself"; "Rock-A-Bye Your Baby"; "San Francisco"; "Chicago"; and "Over The Rainbow." Mort Lindsey conducted.[tpl]cite book|author=Scott Schechter|title=Judy Garland: The Day-by-Day Chronicle of a Legend|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GMtT0rOMyS4C|accessdate=April 9, 2013|date=August 25, 2006|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|isbn=978-1-4616-3555-0|page=310[/tpl]

====Fielding surface====

Originally, the stadium's surface was a Tifway 419 Bermuda grass playing surface specifically bred for indoor use. The dome's ceiling contained numerous semitransparent panes made of Lucite. Players quickly complained that glare coming off of the panes made it hard for them to track fly balls. To solve the problem, two sections of panes were painted white.  However, within a few months, the grass died from lack of sunlight.[tpl]cite book|last=Lowry|first=Phillip|title=Green Cathedrals|year=2005|publisher=Walker & Company|location=New York City|isbn=0-8027-1562-1[/tpl] For most of the 1965 season, the Astros played on green-painted dirt and dead grass. The clear panels also added a problem when combined with the natural grass. The grass tended to hold, then release moisture, often resulting in rain within the structure, causing games to be delayed while the grounds crews cleaned up the playing surface.
The solution was to install a new type of artificial grass on the field, ChemGrass, which became known as AstroTurf. Because the supply of AstroTurf was still low, only a limited amount was available at the start of the season. There was not enough for the entire outfield, so the first phase covered only the traditional grass portion of the infield and foul territory,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uPwrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=y8cEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6321,1673684|newspaper=Florence (AL) Times|title=Astroturf planned for Houston field|agency=Associated Press|date=March 13, 1966|page=18[/tpl] at a cost of $2 per square foot.

The team was sent on an extended road trip before the break, and on July 19, 1966, the installation of the outfield portion of AstroTurf was completed for a game with the Phillies.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e7IhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IpwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2932,2223710|newspaper=Reading (PA) Eagle|agency=Associated Press|title=Phils, Astros plan tonight on artificial grass |date=July 19, 1966|page=23[/tpl] Groundskeepers dressed as astronauts kept the turf clean with vacuum cleaners between innings. The infield dirt remained in the traditional design, with a large dirt arc, similar to natural grass fields.
In 1971, the Astros installed an all-AstroTurf infield, except for dirt cutouts around the bases. This "sliding pit" configuration was first introduced by Cincinnati with the opening of Riverfront Stadium on June 30, 1970. It was then installed in the new stadiums in Philadelphia in 1971, and Kansas City in 1973. The artificial turf fields of Pittsburgh and St. Louis were traditionally configured like the Astrodome, and also changed to sliding pits in the 1970s.
Throughout its history, the Astrodome was known as a pitcher's park. The power alleys were never shorter than [tpl]Convert|370|ft|0[/tpl] from the plate; on at least two occasions they were as far as [tpl]Convert|390|ft|0[/tpl]. Over time, it gave up fewer home runs than any other park in the National League.[tpl]cite book |last=Smith |first=Curt |authorlink=Curt Smith (author)|title=Storied Stadiums |year=2001 |publisher=Carroll & Graf |location=New York City |isbn=0-7867-1187-6[/tpl] The Astrodome's reputation as a pitcher's park continued even in the mid-1980s, when the fences were moved in closer than the Metrodome, which was long reckoned as a hitter's park.

===June 15, 1976 "The Rainout"===

Ironically, the Astrodome suffered a rainout on June 15, 1976. The Astros' scheduled game against the Pittsburgh Pirates was called when massive flooding in the Houston area prevented all but a few fans from reaching the stadium. Both teams had arrived early for practice, but the umpires were several hours late. At 5pm that day, with only a handful of fans on-hand and already several hours behind, the umpires and teams agreed to call the game off. Tables were brought onto the field and the teams ate dinner together.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/hoffman/6485163.html |title=Hoffman: Astros made history with a rainout - Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date=June 17, 2009 |accessdate=April 2, 2013[/tpl] Although the Astros still had a home series with Pittsburgh in August, this game was made up in Pittsburgh in July.

===Scoreboard===

The Astrodome was well-renowned for a four-story scoreboard called the "Astrolite", composed of thousands of light bulbs that featured numerous animations. After every Astros home run, the scoreboard featured a minute-long animated celebration of pistols, bulls, and fireworks. The scoreboard remained intact until 1988 when Houston Oilers (now Tennessee Titans) owner Bud Adams suggested the removal of the scoreboard to accommodate increased capacity demands for football, baseball and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. Harris County spent $67 million of public funds on renovations.[tpl]cite book |last=Fowler |first=Ed |title=Loser Takes All – Bud Adams, Bad Football, & Big Business |publisher=Longview Press |page=8 |year=1997 |isbn=1-56352-432-5[/tpl] Approximately 15,000 new seats resembling the 1970s rainbow uniform pattern were installed to bring seating capacity to almost 60,000 for football. On September 5, 1988, a final celebration commemorating the scoreboard occurred prior to expansion renovations.

===Recent history===

In 1989, four cylindrical pedestrian ramp columns were constructed outside the Dome for accessibility. This enabled the Astrodome to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
The 1992 Republican National Convention was held at the Astrodome in August of that year. The Astros accommodated the convention by taking a month-long road trip.
On August 19, 1995, a scheduled preseason game between the Oilers and the San Diego Chargers had to be canceled due to the dilapidated condition of the playing field. Oilers owner Adams demanded a new stadium, but the city of Houston refused to fund it. After years of threats, Adams moved the team to Tennessee in 1996.[tpl]cite web|last=Holeywell |first=Ryan |url=http://www.governing.com/topics/economic-dev/when-team-leaves-its-stadium-what-do-you-do.html |title=When Teams Leave, What Do You Do With the Stadium? |publisher=Governing.com |date=November 30, 2011 |accessdate=April 2, 2013[/tpl] Around that time the Astros also threatened to leave the city unless a new ballpark was built. The retractable-roofed Enron Field (now known as Minute Maid Park) opened for the 2000 season in downtown Houston.
One of the largest crowds in the Astrodome's history, more than 66,746 fans, came on Sunday, February 26, 1995, to see Tejano superstar Selena and her band Los Dinos perform for a sell-out crowd during the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tejanomusicvideos.com/play.php?vid=2249 |title=Mazz - Cuando Tu Te Vayas.wmv |publisher=Tejanomusicvideos.com |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013[/tpl] Selena y Los Dinos performed two consecutive times before at the Astrodome, breaking previous attendance records each time. This was Selena's last televised concert before she was fatally shot in March 1995.
The Astrodome was joined by a new neighbor in 2002, the retractable-roofed Reliant Stadium, which was built to house Houston's new NFL franchise, the Houston Texans. The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo moved to the new venue in 2003, leaving the Astrodome without any major tenants.

==Hurricane Katrina==

On August 31, 2005, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the Harris County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management and the State of Louisiana came to an agreement to allow at least 25,000 evacuees from New Orleans, especially those that were sheltered in the Louisiana Superdome, to move to the Astrodome until they could return home. The evacuation began on September 1, 2005. All scheduled events for the final four months of 2005 at the Astrodome were cancelled.ESPN – Superdome evacuation disrupted after shots fired – ESPN. Overflow refugees were held in the surrounding Reliant Park complex. There was a full field hospital inside the Reliant Arena, which cared for the entire Katrina evacuee community.
The entire Reliant Park complex was scheduled to be emptied of hurricane evacuees by September 17, 2005. Originally, the Astrodome was planned to be used to house evacuees until December. However, the surrounding parking lots were needed for the first Houston Texans home game. Arrangements were made to help Katrina evacuees find apartments both in Houston and elsewhere in the United States. By September 16, 2005, the last of the hurricane evacuees living in the Astrodome had been moved out either to the neighboring Reliant Arena or to permanent housing north of Houston.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-08-31-astrodome_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Thomas | last1=Frank | title=Astrodome to take refugees | date=September 1, 2005[/tpl] As of September 20, 2005, the remaining Katrina evacuees were relocated to Arkansas due to Hurricane Rita.[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/21/nation/na-rita21/3 | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=John-Thor | last1=Dahlburg | first2=Scott | last2=Gold | first3=Maria L. | last3=La Ganga | title=Hurricane Rita Rattles Coast | date=September 21, 2005[/tpl]
