[[Post-rock]]

CATEGORIES: Alternative rock genres, Post-rock

Post-rock is a subgenre of rock music characterized by the influence and use of instruments commonly associated with rock, but using rhythms and "guitars as facilitators of timbre and textures" not traditionally found in rock. Post-rock bands are often without vocals.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d2682|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Post-Rock/Experimental|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2008-07-08[/tpl]
Don Caballero and Tortoise were among the more prominent bands described as post-rock in the 1990s, but their styles are very different, despite being instrumental bands centered on guitars and drums. As such, the term has been the subject of backlash from listeners and artists alike.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/Issue%201/Interviews/Mogwai/mogwai.html|title=A Conversation with Mogwai's Dominic Aitchison|first=Mark|last=Redfern|publisher=Under the Radar|year=2001|accessdate=2006-11-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061112174506/http://www.undertheradarmag.com/Issue+1/Interviews/Mogwai/mogwai.html |archivedate = November 12, 2006[/tpl]
Although firmly rooted in the indie or underground scene of the 1980s and early '90s, post-rock's style often bears little resemblance musically to that of contemporary indie rock.

==Origin of the term==

The term "post-rock" is believed to have been coined by critic Simon Reynolds in his review of Bark Psychosis' album Hex, published in the March 1994 issue of Mojo magazine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=5803|title=Bark Psychosis: Hex|first=Simon|last=Reynolds|date=March 1994|accessdate=2008-07-08|publisher=Mojo[/tpl] Reynolds expanded upon the idea later in the May 1994 issue of The Wire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/out/1297_4.htm |title=S. T.|publisher=The Wire|first=Simon|last=Reynolds|date=May 1994|accessdate=2007-07-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20011202075606/http://www.thewire.co.uk/out/1297_4.htm |archivedate = 2001-12-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/about/history.html |title=The Wire 20|date=November 2002|accessdate=2008-07-08|publisher=The Wire |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040817143035/http://www.thewire.co.uk/about/history.html |archivedate = 2004-08-17[/tpl]
He used the term to describe music "using rock instrumentation for non-rock purposes, using guitars as facilitators of timbre and textures rather than riffs and power chords". He further expounded on the term, [tpl]cquote|Perhaps the really provocative area for future development lies... in cyborg rock; not the wholehearted embrace of Techno's methodology, but some kind of interface between real time, hands-on playing and the use of digital effects and enhancement.[/tpl]
Reynolds, in a July 2005 entry in his blog, claimed he had used the term "post-rock" before using it in Mojo, previously using it in music newspaper Melody Maker.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blissout.blogspot.com/2005_07_01_blissout_archive.html#112140209965630241|title=S. T.|first=Simon|last=Reynolds|date=2005-07-14|accessdate=2006-11-28|publisher=blissblog[/tpl] He also said he later found the term not to be of his own creation, saying in his blog, "although I genuinely believed I was coining the term, I discovered many years later it had been floating around for over a decade." The term was used by American journalist James Wolcott in a 1975 article about musician Todd Rundgren, although with a different meaning.[tpl]cite web|url=http://toddstuff.home.comcast.net/articles/TR-creem-exile.html|title=Todd Rundgren – Street Punk in Self-Imposed Exile|first=James|last=Wolcott|date=July 1975|accessdate=2008-07-08|publisher=Creem[/tpl] It was also used in the Rolling Stone Album Guide to name a style roughly corresponding to "avant-rock" or "out-rock".
Another pre-1994 example of the term in use can be found in an April 1992 review of '90s noise-pop band The Earthmen by Steven Walker in Melbourne music publication Juke, where he describes a "post-rock noisefest".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.suburbia.com.au/~snf/records/summersh/staceys.html|title=S.

==Historical development==

===Early precedents===

Post-rock appears to take a heavy influence from late 1960s U.S. group The Velvet Underground and their "dronology" — "a term that loosely describes fifty percent of today's post rock activity".[tpl]cite book| isbn=0-8264-1615-2|editor=Cox, Cristoph and Daniel Warner|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|publisher=Continuum International|page=359|title=Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music| year=2007[/tpl]
British group Public Image Ltd (PiL) were also pioneers, described by the NME[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/public-image-ltd/641|title=NME Reviews: Plastic Box|date=1999-01-11|accessdate=2008-07-08|publisher=NME[/tpl] as "arguably the first post-rock group". Their second album Metal Box (1979) almost completely abandoned traditional rock and roll structures in favor of dense, repetitive dub and krautrock inspired soundscapes and John Lydon's cryptic, stream-of-consciousness lyrics. The year before Metal Box was released, PiL bassist Jah Wobble declared, "rock is obsolete".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/heavy_metal/|title=Heavy Metal|publisher=Frieze Magazine|first=Simon|last=Reynolds|date=November 2007|accessdate=2008-01-15[/tpl] The Flowers of Romance (1981), their third album, was an even more radical departure, emphasizing rattling percussion and abstract tape music.

===1990s post-rock===

Bands from the early 1990s, such as Slint or, earlier, Talk Talk, were later recognized as influential on post-rock. Slint's Spiderland and Talk Talk's 1988 Spirit of Eden[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?reviewid=6911|publisher=Sputnik Music|title=Talk Talk — It's My Life review|first=Chris|last=Jackson|date=2006-05-15|accessdate=2007-03-29[/tpl] are credited as giving birth to post-rock. Despite the fact that the two bands are highly different from one another, Talk Talk emerging from art rock and new wave and Slint emerging from post-hardcore and math rock, they both have had a driving influence on the way post-rock progressed throughout the 1990s.

Groups such as Cul de Sac, Tortoise, Labradford, Bowery Electric and Stars of the Lid are cited as founders of a distinctly American post-rock movement.[tpl]Cite journal | last = Reynolds | first = Simon | title = Back to the Future | journal = The Wire | volume = 141 | pages = 26–30 | date = November 1995 | postscript =  [/tpl] The second Tortoise  LP  Millions Now Living Will Never Die, made the band a post-rock icon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.splendidezine.com/review.html?reviewid=1081734856339505|title=Tortoise — It's All Around You|first=Phillip|last=Buchan|publisher=Splendid Magazine|date=2004-04-13|accessdate=2007-03-29[/tpl]  Many bands (e.g., Do Make Say Think) began to record music inspired by the "Tortoise-sound".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.textura.org/archives/d/domakeandyetreview.htm|title=Do Make Say Think — And Yet review|publisher=Textura|date=February 2003|accessdate=2007-03-29[/tpl]
In the late 1990s, Chicago was the home base for a variety of post-rock associated performers. Both John McEntire of Tortoise and Jim O'Rourke of Brise-Glace and Gastr del Sol were important producers for many of the groups.P. Buckley, The Rough Guide to Rock, (Rough Guides, 1999), ISBN 1858284570, P. 913 One of the most eminent post-rock locales is Montreal, where Godspeed You!

===2000s post-rock===

In the early 2000s, the term had started to fall out of favor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/tortoise/a-lazarus-taxon.htm|title=Review of Tortoise's A Lazarus Taxon|first=Todd|last=Hutlock|publisher=Stylus Magazine|accessdate=2006-11-28|date=2006-09-01[/tpl] It became increasingly controversial as more critics outwardly condemned its use. Some of the bands for whom the term was most frequently assigned, including Cul de Sac,[tpl]cite web|title=Cul de Sac Interview|url=http://people.bu.edu/nsmith/interview.htm|accessdate=2006-11-29[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Interview with Cul de Sac's Glenn Jones|url=http://www.furious.com/PERFECT/culdesac.html|publisher=Perfect Sound Forever|accessdate=2006-11-29|date=March 1998|first=Dave|last=Lang[/tpl] Tortoise, and Mogwai, rejected the label.  The wide range of styles covered by the term, they and others have claimed, rob it of its usefulness.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/gate/archive/2005/05/12/derk.DTL|title=Hear & Now|date=2005-05-12|accessdate=2007-03-29|publisher=San Francisco Gate|first=Derk|last=Richardson[/tpl]
Today, despite criticism of the term, post-rock has maintained its prominence. Sigur Rós, with the release of Ágætis byrjun in 1999, has become among the most well known post-rock bands of the 2000s. In part this has been due to the use of many of their tracks, particularly their 2005 single "Hoppípolla", in TV soundtracks and film trailers, including the BBC's Planet Earth. Their popularity can at least somewhat be attributed to a move towards a more rock oriented sound with simpler song structures and increasing utilization of pop hooks.Allmusic review: Sigur Rós – Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust Explosions in the Sky, This Will Destroy You, Do Make Say Think, and Mono are some of the more popular post-rock bands of the 2000s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/contents.asp?contentid=29326&p=2|title=Bang On: Explosions in the Sky|first=Laura|last=Babbili|date=2007-03-15|accessdate=2007-03-09|publisher=Gigwise[/tpl] With a few exceptions, most notably Sigur Rós and Mogwai, the post-rock of the 21st century has generally eliminated vocals from its repertoire.

==Musical characteristics==

The post-rock sound incorporates characteristics from a variety of musical genres, including ambient, jazz, electronica, and experimental. Early post-rock groups also often exhibited strong influence from the krautrock of the '70s, particularly borrowing elements of "motorik", the characteristic krautrock rhythm.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aural-innovations.com/issues/issue16/postrok1.html|title=What Exactly Comes After Post-rock?|last=Henderson|first=Keith|publisher=Aural Innovations|date=June 2001|accessdate=2007-09-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.birdhouse.org/words/scot/post_rock.html|title=The Post-Rock Phenomenon|accessdate=2007-03-29|publisher=Utne Reader|first=Scot|last=Hacker|date=July 1996[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenetnet.com/reviews/newelec.html|title=What You Need to Know About Electronica|accessdate=2007-09-28|publisher=The Net Net|first=Chris|last=Tweney|date=May 1997 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070211080739/http://www.thenetnet.com/reviews/newelec.html |archivedate = February 11, 2007[/tpl]
Post-rock compositions often make use of repetition of musical motifs and subtle changes with an extremely wide range of dynamics. In some respects, this is similar to the music of Steve Reich, Philip Glass and Brian Eno, pioneers of minimalism. Typically, post-rock pieces are lengthy and instrumental, containing repetitive build-ups of timbre, dynamics and texture.
Vocals are often omitted from post-rock; however, this does not necessarily mean they are absent entirely. When vocals are included, the use is typically non-traditional: some post-rock bands employ vocals as purely instrumental efforts and incidental to the sound, rather than a more traditional use where "clean", easily-interpretable vocals are important for poetic and lyrical meaning. When present, post-rock vocals are often soft or droning and are typically infrequent or present in irregular intervals. Sigur Rós, a band known for their distinctive vocals, fabricated a language that critics call "Hopelandic" ("Vonlenska" in Icelandic, a term even used by the band), which has been described by the band as "a form of gibberish vocals that fits to the music and acts as another instrument."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/band/faq.php#07|title=Sigur Ros frequently asked questions|accessdate=2006-11-28|publisher=Eighteen Seconds Before Sunrise[/tpl]
In lieu of typical rock structures like the verse-chorus form, post-rock groups generally make greater use of soundscapes. As Simon Reynolds states in his "Post-Rock" from Audio Culture, "A band's journey through rock to post-rock usually involves a trajectory from narrative lyrics to stream-of-consciousness to voice-as-texture to purely instrumental music".[tpl]Cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|author-link=Simon Reynolds|editor-last=Cox|editor-first=Christoph|editor2-last=Warner|editor2-first=Daniel|year=2004|title=Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music|isbn=978-0-8264-1615-5|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|postscript=[/tpl] Reynolds' conclusion defines the sporadic progression from rock, with its field of sound and lyrics to post-rock, where samples are stretched and looped.
Wider experimentation and blending of other genres have recently taken hold in the post-rock scene. Cult of Luna, Isis, Russian Circles, Palms, Deftones, and Pelican have fused metal with post-rock styles. The resulting sound has been termed post-metal. More recently, sludge metal has grown and evolved to include (and in some cases fuse completely with) some elements of post-rock. This second wave of sludge metal has been pioneered by bands such as Giant Squid and Battle of Mice. This new sound is often seen on the label of Neurot Recordings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/09/19/features/heavy.php|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=2005-09-20|first=Jon|last=Caramanica|accessdate=2007-09-28|title=The Alchemy of Art-World Heavy Metal[/tpl] Similarly, bands such as Altar of Plagues, Lantlôs and Agalloch blend between post-rock and black metal, incorporating elements of the former while primarily using the latter.[tpl]cite web | url=http://decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=295657 | title=Altar of Plagues | publisher=Red Flag Media | work=Decibel Magazine | accessdate=10 March 2014 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100206120525/http://decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=295657 | archivedate=6 February 2010 | deadurl=yes | subscription=yes | first=Zena | last=Tsarfin[/tpl] In some cases, this sort of experimentation and blending has gone beyond the fusion of post-rock with a single genre, as in the case of post-metal, in favor of an even wider embrace of disparate musical influences.
