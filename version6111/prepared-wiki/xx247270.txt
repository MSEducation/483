There were several changes from the previous season, with the addition of the Greater Manchester Open, the Uniroyal International and the Lancome Trophy, and the Benson & Hedges Festival being retitled as the Benson and Hedges International Open.

==Order of Merit==

The PGA European Tour's money list was known as the "Order of Merit". It was based on a points system, which meant that some players could finish lower than others despite accumulating more prize money.
