==Biography==

Slonczewski did his undergraduate education at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1950 and completed his PhD from the Rutgers University in 1955. He then joined the IBM Research center in Yorktown, New York as a staff researcher, where he stayed till his retirement in 2002. Slonczewski is known for his extensive theoretical study of magnetic system, in particular his applications of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ)s. 
Slonczewski, along with Luc Berger was awarded the 2013 Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize "for predicting spin-transfer torque and opening the field of current-induced control over magnetic nanostructures."
