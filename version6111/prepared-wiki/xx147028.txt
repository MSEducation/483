Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013  The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent).
In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=2157&&PageID=401659&mode=2 |title=Pennsylvania Parent Guide to Special Education Services |author=Pennsylvania Bureau of Special Education |year=2008[/tpl] To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pinerichland.org/Page/523 |title=Screening Evaluation and Placement Procedures |author=Pine-Richland School District |year=2014[/tpl] When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation.

In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/education_budget/8699/proposed_special_education_funding_-/539261 |title=Pennsylvania Special Education Funding |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education[/tpl]  The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district’s students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student’s needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth.

==Wellness policy==

Pine-Richland School Board established a district wellness policy in 2010.Pine-Richland School Board Policy Manual, Student Wellness Policy 246, November 22, 2010 The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 – 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) "shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006."  Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=18755322 |title=Statewide assessment of local wellness policies in Pennsylvania public school districts. |author=Probart C, McDonnell E, Weirich JE, Schilling L, Fekete V. |date=September 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.jada.2008.06.429 |volume=108 |issue=9 |journal=J Am Diet Assoc |pages=1497–502[/tpl]
The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/school_nutrition_incentive_program/7489  |title=Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education – Division of Food and Nutrition |date=July 2008[/tpl] The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval.

====Act 1 Adjusted Index====

The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above their annual Act 1 Index unless they either: allow Districts voters to approve the increase through a vote by referendum or they receive an exception from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The base index for the school year is published by the PDE in the fall of each year. Each individual school district’s Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as local property values and the personal income of district residents. Originally, Act 1 of 2006 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines |year=2010[/tpl]
