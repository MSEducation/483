Bigfoot Bonkers is an 2-player (only) maze arcade game released by Meadows Games in 1976. Players move their blocks across the screen to create walls to try to surround their opponents and force them to crash into the walls or any block or obstacle like a 'foot'. This type of game appeared in many variants on many computers and consoles over the years, and was popular on mobile phones like Nokia many years later as one of the default games called "Snake".
