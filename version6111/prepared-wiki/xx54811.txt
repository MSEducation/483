The University is a member-school of Thurgood Marshall College Fund.

==History==

The school was founded in 1897 and was known as the Oklahoma Colored Agricultural and Normal University. Langston University was created as a result of the second Morrill Act in 1890. The law required states with land-grant colleges (such as Oklahoma State University, then Oklahoma A&M) to either admit African-Americans, or provide an alternative school for them to attend as a condition of receiving federal funds.http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/L/LA021.html Langston University is named for John Mercer Langston (1829–1897), civil rights pioneer, first African American member of Congress from Virginia, founder of the Howard University Law School, and American consul-general to Haiti.  It was renamed Langston University in 1941.
Through the years Langston University has developed slowly but surely. Some of the most serious problems have been political influences, financial stress, and lack of adequate space and equipment. During the 1960s the campus underwent a complete makeover. New buildings appeared, and additions were made to the library and auditorium. Thus, despite the problems, Langston has braved the storms and produced outstanding graduates. Langston alumni are scattered  throughout the nation and are serving humanity with pride.
Poet Melvin B. Tolson taught at Langston from 1947 until 1964.  Tolson was portrayed by Denzel Washington in the film The Great Debaters.
