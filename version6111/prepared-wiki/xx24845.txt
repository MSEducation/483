==History==

The name of Babadag is connected with 13th century dervish Baba Sari Saltik, who is said to have led a number of Turcomans to Dobruja and to have settled them in this area. The town was first mentioned by Ibn Battuta under the name Baba Saltuk, as the furthermost outpost of the Turks.Stănciugel et al., p.44-46
The town was conquered by Bayezid I, a Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, in his Danubian campaign of 1393. The construction of a fortress was begun here during the reign of Murad IV, but by 1650 only the fortress' foundation walls and towers were standing. In the 17th century, it occasionally served as the winter headquarters for the Grand Vizier of the Turks during their wars with Russia. The town's location near to the Black Sea made it a target for the Russian navy, the town was bombed by the Russians in 1854 during the Crimean War.[tpl]Cite EB1911|wstitle=Babadag[/tpl] Following the war between the Ottoman and Russian empires (1877–1878) Babadag became part of an independent Romania.
