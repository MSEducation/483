"Lijepa naša domovino" (Our Beautiful Homeland) is the national anthem of Croatia. It is often referred to as just "Lijepa naša" ("Our Beautiful") in Croatia, which is also a phrase widely used as a metonym for the country.
The original lyrics were written by Antun Mihanović and first published under the title Horvatska domovina (Croatian homeland) in 1835. The author of music has not been indisputably determined although the late 19th century tradition suggests that it might have been the music amateur Josip Runjanin (1821–1878). It has not been known what was the original form of the melody because the first copy has not been recovered to this day.
The complete song was reportedly scored and harmonized by Vatroslav Lichtenegger in 1861 and based on the singing of his students, trainee teachers. It was first performed as the Croatian anthem in the same year, under the title Lijepa naša. The original anthem has 15 verses. Since then it has come to be known under the slightly longer present title and a few minor adjustments have been made to the lyrics.
The song was not immediately adopted by the Croatian Parliament as the national anthem. In 1907, the Association of Croatian Singing Clubs requested the parliament to do so but received no response, even though the song was used as the anthem in unofficial capacity at ceremonies, including the 29 October 1918 session of the parliament when Croatia formally dissolved its ties with Austria-Hungary.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (Croatia)|url=http://www.mvep.hr/en/about-croatia/state-emblems/national-anthem/|title=State emblems[/tpl]
Between 1918 and 1941, segments of the Croatian national anthem were part of the national anthem of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and it was unofficial hymn of Croats. During the World War II, in the Independent State of Croatia it was also used as state anthem, albeit with some modifications to the lyrics. Croatian partisans were also using it, for example during ZAVNOH sessions. 
The song became the official anthem of Croatia through amendments of the Constitution of Croatia adopted by the parliament of the SR Croatia on 29 February 1972. The anthem was confirmed by constitutions of 1974 and 1990, when its lyrics were slightly modified, and by the Coat of Arms, the Flag and the National Anthem of the Republic of Croatia Act.
