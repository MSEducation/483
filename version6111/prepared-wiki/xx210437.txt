[[Water table (architecture)]]

CATEGORIES: Architectural elements, Architectural design

A water table is a masonry architectural feature that consists of a projecting course that deflects water running down the face of a building away from lower courses or the foundation. A water table may be found near the base of a wall or at a transition between materials, such as from stone to brick.
A water table is a projection of lower masonry on the outside of the wall slightly above the ground. Often a damp
course is placed at the level of the water table to prevent upward penetration of ground water.Technical Notes 2 - Glossary of Terms Relating to Brick Masonry
