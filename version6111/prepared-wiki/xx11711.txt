[[Antisemitism and the New Testament]]

CATEGORIES: Christianity and antisemitism, Early Christianity and Judaism, New Testament

It has been argued that the New Testament contributed toward subsequent antisemitism in the Christian community.J.G.Dunn. The Question of Anti-Semitism in the New Testament Writings of the Period. Jews and Christians: the parting of the ways, CE 70 to 135. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999. Page 179. 'The challenge thus posed to Christian NT scholars in particular cannot therefore be ducked... The question we must face, then, is whether such attitudes are already inseparable from the scriptures on which they were based. ... in terms of the present inquiry, Does the attitude to Jews in the post-70 NT documents indicate that the final breach, the decisive parting of the ways between Christianity and (rabbinic) Judaism, has already happened?' A. Roy Eckardt has asserted that the foundation of antisemitism and responsibility for the Holocaust lies ultimately in the New Testament.[tpl]cite book |last=Eckardt |first=A.

==The New Testament and Christian antisemitism==

A. Roy Eckardt, a pioneer in the field of Jewish-Christian relations,In Memoriam: Professor A. Roy Eckardt Holocaust and Genocide Studies 1998 12(3):519 asserted that the foundation of antisemitism and responsibility for the Holocaust lies ultimately in the New Testament. Eckardt insisted that Christian repentance must include a reexamination of basic theological attitudes toward Jews and the New Testament in order to deal effectively with antisemitism.[tpl]cite book |last=Eckardt |first=A.

According to Rabbi Michael J. Cook, Professor of Intertestamental and Early Christian Literature at the Hebrew Union College, there are ten themes in the New Testament that are the greatest sources of anxiety for Jews concerning Christian antisemitism.
Cook believes that both contemporary Jews and contemporary Christians need to reexamine the history of early Christianity, and the transformation of Christianity from a Jewish sect consisting of followers of a Jewish Jesus, to a separate religion often dependent on the tolerance of Rome while proselytizing among Gentiles loyal to the Roman empire, to understand how the story of Jesus came to be recast in an anti-Jewish form as the Gospels took their final form.Michael Cook 2008 Modern Jews Engage the New Testament
Some scholars assert that critical verses in the New Testament have been used to incite prejudice and violence against Jewish people. Professor Lillian C. Freudmann, author of Antisemitism in the New Testament (University Press of America, 1994) has published a study of such verses and the effects that they have had in the Christian community throughout history.[tpl]Request quotation|date=July 2010[/tpl] Similar studies have been made by both Christian and Jewish scholars, including, Professors Clark Williamsom[tpl]Request quotation|date=July 2010[/tpl] (Christian Theological Seminary), Hyam Maccoby[tpl]Request quotation|date=July 2010[/tpl] (The Leo Baeck Institute), Norman A.

==Jewish-Christian conflict in the New Testament==

There are some verses in the New Testament that describe Jews in a positive way, attributing to them salvation[tpl]bibleref2c|John|4:22|NIV[/tpl] or divine love.[tpl]bibleref2c|Romans|11:28|NIV[/tpl] In the story of the crucifixion, meanwhile, Jews prompt Jesus' execution and say "His blood be on us, and on our children", [tpl]bibleref2c|Matthew|27:25|NIV[/tpl] referred to as the blood curse. In the Book of John, Jesus calls certain Pharisees "children of the devil".[tpl]bibleref2c|John|8:44|NIV[/tpl]
According to the New Testament Gospels, Jesus, on his fateful entry into Jerusalem before Passover, was received by a great crowd of people. Jesus was arrested and tried by the Sanhedrin. After the trial, Jesus was handed over to Pontius Pilate, who duly tried him again and, at the urging of the people, had him crucified.
The New Testament records that Jesus' disciple Judas Iscariot,[tpl]bibleref2c|Mark|14:43-46|NIV[/tpl] the Roman governor Pontius Pilate along with Roman forces[tpl]bibleref2c|John|19:11|NIV[/tpl][tpl]bibleref2c|Acts|4:27|NIV[/tpl] and the leaders and people of Jerusalem were (to varying degrees) responsible for the death of Jesus.[tpl]bibleref2c|Acts|13:27-28|NIV[/tpl]

===Gospel of Mark===

According to the Gospel of Mark, Jesus' crucifixion was authorized by Roman authorities at the insistence of leading Jews (Judeans) from the Sanhedrin.[tpl]bibleref2c|Mark|15:1-15|NIV[/tpl]

===Gospel of Matthew===

As Matthew's narrative marches toward the passion, the anti-Jewish rhetoric increases. In chapter 21, the parable of the vineyard is followed by the great "stone" text, an early Christological interpretation of [tpl]bibleref2|Psalm|118:22-23|NIV[/tpl]: "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone".[tpl]bibleref2c|Matt|21:42|NIV[/tpl] Then, in chapters 23 and 24, three successive hostile pericopes are recorded. First, a series of "woes" are pronounced against the Pharisees:
[tpl]quote|"you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets...You snakes, you brood of vipers! How can you escape being sentenced to hell?"|[tpl]bibleref2|Matthew|23:31-33|NIV[/tpl][/tpl]
Then, Jesus laments over the capital: "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it...See, your house is left to you, desolate" ([tpl]bibleref2|Matthew|23:37-38[/tpl]). And finally, Jesus predicts the demise of the Temple: "Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down" ([tpl]bibleref2|24:2b[/tpl]).
The culmination of this rhetoric, and arguably the one verse that has caused more Jewish suffering than any other second Testament passage, is the uniquely Matthean attribution to the Jewish people: "His Jesus's blood be on us and on our children!" ([tpl]bibleref2|Matthew|27:25[/tpl]). This so-called "blood guilt" text has been interpreted to mean that all Jews, of Jesus' time and forever afterward, accept responsibility for the death of Jesus.
Shelly Matthews writes:
[tpl]quote|"In Matthew, as in many books of the New Testament, the idea that Christ followers are persecuted is pervasive. Blessings are pronounced on those who are persecuted for righteousness sake in the Sermon on the Mount; the woes against the Pharisees in Matthew 23 culminate in predictions that they will "kill and crucify, flog in synagogues, and pursue from town to town;" the parable of the banquet in Matthew 22 implies that servants of the king will be killed by those to whom they are sent."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.class.uidaho.edu/jcanders/Matthew/shelly_matthews.htm |title=Violence in Matthew: The Question of Text and Reality |author=Shelly Matthews |accessdate=2007-06-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070609095914/http://www.class.uidaho.edu/jcanders/Matthew/shelly_matthews.htm| archivedate= 9 June 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl][/tpl]
Douglas Hare noted that the Gospel of Matthew avoids sociological explanations for persecution:[tpl]cite book |author=Douglas Hare. |title=The Theme of Jewish Persecution of Christians in the Gospel According to St. Matthew |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1967 |pages=145[/tpl]
The term "Jews" in the Gospel of Matthew is applied to those who deny the resurrection of Jesus and believe that the disciples stole Jesus's corpse.[tpl]bibleref2c|Matthew|28:13-15|NIV[/tpl]

===Gospel of John===

The Gospel of John collectively describes the enemies of Jesus as "the Jews". In none of the other gospels do "the Jews" demand, en masse, the death of Jesus; instead, the plot to put him to death is always presented as coming from a small group of priests and rulers, the Sadducees. John's gospel is thus the primary source of the image of "the Jews" acting collectively as the enemy of Jesus, which later became fixed in the Christian mind.Is John's Gospel antisemitic?
For example, in [tpl]bibleref2|John|7:1-9[/tpl] Jesus moves around in Galilee but avoids Judea, because "the Jews" were looking for a chance to kill him. In [tpl]bibleverse-nb||John|7:12-13[/tpl] some said "he is a good man" whereas others said he deceives the people, but these were all "whispers", no one would speak publicly for "fear of the Jews". Jewish rejection is also recorded in [tpl]bibleverse-nb||John|7:45-52[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse-nb||John|8:39-59[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse-nb||John|10:22-42[/tpl], and [tpl]bibleverse-nb||John|12:36-43[/tpl]. [tpl]bibleref2|John|12:42[/tpl] says many did believe, but they kept it private, for fear the Pharisees would exclude them from the Synagogue. After the crucifixion, [tpl]bibleverse-nb||John|20:19[/tpl] has the disciples hiding behind locked doors, "for fear of the Jews".
In several places John's gospel also associates "the Jews" with darkness and with the devil. In John 8:37-39;[tpl]bibleverse||John|8:37-39|NIV[/tpl] 44-47,[tpl]bibleverse||John|8:44-47|NIV[/tpl] Jesus says, speaking to a group of Pharisees:
John's use of the term 'Jews' is a complex and debated area of biblical scholarship. Some scholars argue that the author most likely considered himself Jewish and was probably speaking to a largely Jewish community.D. Moody Smith: Anti-Semitism and the Gospel of John  New Testament scholar J.G. Dunn writes:
Because of this controversy some modern English translations, such as Today's New International Version, remove the term "Jews" and replace it with more specific terms to avoid anti-Semitic connotations. For example, the Jesus Seminar translates this as "Judeans", i.e. residents of Judea, in contrast to residents of Galilee. Most critics of these translations, while conceding this point, argue that the context (since it is obvious that Jesus, John himself, and the other disciples were all Jews) makes John's true meaning sufficiently clear, and that a literal translation is preferred.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]
Paul Jones writes:
[tpl]quote|"The Gospel of John has the dubious distinction of being both the most popular Gospel (considered the most "spiritual" of the canonical Gospels) and the most anti-Jewish. The term "the Jews" (Ioudaios) in the Gospel functions as a "hostile collective stereotype" and is identified with "evil" and the "devil." Yet the Gospel of John is intimately connected with Judaism. Jesus is thoroughly Jewish in this Gospel. His life revolves around the Jewish festivals, and his identity as the Messiah is confirmed by the Jewish scriptures. According to John 20:31, the book was written so "that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God." Christology, therefore, is the key to understanding both the theology of the Gospel and its strained relationship with the larger Pharisaic Jewish tradition."[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl][/tpl]

====Later commentary====

Successive generations of Christians read in the Gospel of John the collective guilt of Jews, universally and in all generations, in the death of Christ. John's use of the collective expression "the Jews" is likely explained by the historical circumstances in which and audience for which he wrote. After the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD, the Jewish priesthood, and thus the class of the Sadducees, no longer existed. As John wrote his Gospel after these events, for a gentile audience, he spoke generically of Jews, rather than specifying a group within Judaism that no longer existed and that would have been unfamiliar to his readers.Is the Gospel of John Anti-Semitic?

==Christian responses==

The Catholic Church has denounced antisemitic views held by Christians in the past with a series of statements beginning in 1937 (cf. Mit Brennender Sorge of Pope Pius XI). In the decree Nostra Aetate, Pope Paul VI in Council declared that:
Norman Beck, professor of theology and classical languages at Texas Lutheran University, has proposed that Christian lectionaries remove what he calls "… the specific texts identified as most problematic …".[tpl]cite web |first=Norman |last=Beck |title=Removing Anti-Jewish Polemic from our Christian Lectionaries: A Proposal by Prof. Norman A. Beck |url=http://www.jcrelations.net/en/displayItem.php?id=737 |accessdate=2007-07-18[/tpl] Beck identifies what he deems to be offensive passages in the New Testament and indicates the instances in which these texts or portions thereof are included in major lectionary series.
Daniel Goldhagen, former Associate Professor of Political Science at Harvard University, also suggested in his book A Moral Reckoning that the Roman Catholic Church should change its doctrine and the accepted Biblical canon to excise statements he labels as antisemitic, to indicate that "The Jews' way to God is as legitimate as the Christian way".[tpl]Cite journal | last =Riebling | first =Mark | title =Jesus, Jews, and the Shoah | journal =National Review | volume = | issue = | pages = | date =January 27, 2003 | url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_1_55/ai_96403717 | doi = | id = | format = |accessdate=January 5, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070208063622/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_1_55/ai_96403717 |archivedate = February 8, 2007[/tpl]
