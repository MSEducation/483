The RL10 is a liquid-fuel cryogenic rocket engine used on the Centaur, S-IV and DCSS upper stages. Built in the United States by Aerojet Rocketdyne (formerly by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne), the RL10 burns cryogenic liquid hydrogen & liquid oxygen propellants, with each engine producing [tpl]Convert|64.7|to(-)|110|kN|sigfig=5|abbr=on[/tpl] of thrust in vacuum depending on the version in use. The RL10 was the first liquid hydrogen rocket engine to be built in the United States, and development of the engine by Marshall Space Flight Center and Pratt & Whitney began in the 1950s, with the first flight occurring in 1961. Several versions of the engine have been flown, with two, the RL10A-4-2 and the RL10B-2, still being produced and flown on the Atlas V and Delta IV.
The engine produces a specific impulse (Isp) of [tpl]convert|373|to(-)|470|isp|abbr=on[/tpl] in a vacuum and has a mass ranging from [tpl]Convert|131|to(-)|317|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] (depending on version). Six RL10A-3 engines were used in the S-IV second stage of the Saturn I rocket, one or two RL10 engines are used in the Centaur upper stages of Atlas and Titan rockets and one RL10B-2 is used in the upper stage of Delta IV rockets.

==History==

The RL10 was first tested on the ground in 1959, at Pratt and Whitney's Florida Research and Development Center in West Palm Beach, Florida.Connors, p 319 It was first flown in 1962 in an unsuccessful suborbital test;[tpl]cite web|title=Centaur|publisher=Gunter's Space Pages|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_stage/centaur.htm[/tpl] the first successful flight took place on November 27, 1963.[tpl]cite book |last=Sutton|first=George|title=History of liquid propellant rocket engines|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|year=2005|isbn=1-56347-649-5[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pratt-whitney.com/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=cabbe002c2f3c010VgnVCM1000000881000aRCRD&vgnextchannel=7dfc34890cb06110VgnVCM1000004601000aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default |title=Renowned Rocket Engine Celebrates 40 Years of Flight |date=November 24, 2003 |publisher=Pratt & Whitney[/tpl] For that launch, two RL10A-3 engines powered the Centaur upper stage of an Atlas launch vehicle. The launch was used to conduct a heavily instrumented performance and structural integrity test of the vehicle.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1963-047A |title=Atlas Centaur 2 |publisher=NASA NSSDC[/tpl]

===Improvements===

The RL10 has been upgraded over the years. One current model, the RL10B-2, powers the Delta IV second stage, as well as the Delta III second stage.  It has been significantly modified from the original RL10 to improve performance. Some of the enhancements include an extendable nozzle and electro-mechanical gimbaling for reduced weight and increased reliability.  Current specific impulse is [tpl]convert|464|isp[/tpl].

===Current design===

A flaw in the brazing of an RL10B-2 combustion chamber was identified as the cause of failure for the May 4, 1999, Delta III launch carrying the Orion-3 communications satellite.[ref]

The other current model, the RL10A-4-2, is the engine used on Centaur upper stage for Atlas V.

==Other rockets using RL10==

Four modified RL10A-5 engines, all of them with the ability to be throttled, were used in the McDonnell Douglas DC-X.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
The DIRECT version 3.0 proposal to replace Ares I and Ares V with a family of rockets sharing a common core stage, recommends the RL10 for the second stage of their proposed J-246 and J-247 launch vehicles.[ref]
