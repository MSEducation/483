"Sincerely" is a popular song written by Harvey Fuqua and Alan Freed and published in 1954.
It was originally recorded by The Moonglows, who scored a #1 one single on the Billboard R&B Juke Box chart and #20 on the Billboard Top 100 charts.[tpl]cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=411[/tpl] The best-selling version was a pop cover recorded by The McGuire Sisters, entering the charts in 1954 and reaching number one the next year. Many R&B collectors decry the cover version by the McGuire Sisters which kept the Moonglows off the Pop charts, but the Moonglows' version stole lyrics from a 1951 Dominoes tune, "That's What You're Doing To Me". The bridge in both songs is almost identical: "Lord, won't you tell me/ Why I love that woman so?/ She doesn't want me/ But I'll never let her go". In 1988 the country quartet Forester Sisters reached #8 on the Billboard Hot Country chart with their remake of the song.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
