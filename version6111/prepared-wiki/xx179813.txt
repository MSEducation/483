==Biography==

Sensō Sōshitsu was the youngest son of Sen Sōtan; and he was a great-grandson of Sen Rikyū. Before becoming the head of the Urasenke line of the Sen family, he studied under a physician of Kyoto named Noma Gentaku, aiming to become a physician. Due to the death of Noma, however, he returned to live with his father and concentrate on making a life of carrying on the chadō tradition of the Sen family, founded by his great-grandfather, Sen Rikyū. Through his father's hard work and connections, he landed a position as majistrate in charge of chadō matters for the head of the wealthy Kaga domain.Genshoku Chadō Daijiten, entry for Urasenke, Sensō Sōshitsu. Tankosha Publishing Co., 1985, 10th printing (Japanese) At first he served under Lord Maeda Toshitsune, and after Toshitsune's death, Lord Maeda Tsunatoshi, who was a great patron of the arts and provided Sensō with comfortable quarters in the town of Kanazawa. He spent a great deal of his life in Kanazawa, and his first son, who succeeded him as the fifth head of the Urasenke line of the Sen family, Fukyūsai Jōsō, was born in Kanazawa. Sensō finally retired from his position with Tsunatoshi and returned to Kyoto when he was sixty-six years old, though he continued to make visits to Kanazawa on occasion, and that is where he died on the 23rd day of the 1st month of 1697, at the age of seventy-five.Section on the biography of the Fourth-Generation Grand Master, Sensō Sōshitsu, in Chanoyu: The Urasenke Tradition of Tea.
