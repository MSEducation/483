Luxembourg ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Luxembourg.ogg|ˈ|l|ʌ|k|s|əm|b|ɜr|ɡ[/tpl] [tpl]respell|LUKS|əm-burg[/tpl]), officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ([tpl]lang-lb|Groussherzogtum Lëtzebuerg[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fr|Grand-Duché de Luxembourg[/tpl], [tpl]lang-de|Großherzogtum Luxemburg[/tpl]), is a landlocked country in Western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. It comprises two principal regions: the Oesling in the north as part of the Ardennes massif, and the Gutland ("good country") in the south.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gouvernement.lu/publications/luxembourg/tout_savoir/Tout_savoir_EN_2010.pdf |title= Everything you need to know about the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg[/tpl] Luxembourg has a population of 524,853 (as of October 2012)"The first results of the population census", Statistics Portal, Luxembourg.

As a representative democracy with a constitutional monarch, it is headed by a grand duke and is the world's only remaining grand duchy. Luxembourg is a developed country, with an advanced economy and the world's second highest GDP (PPP) per capita (after Qatar), according to the World Bank. Its central location has historically made it of great strategic importance to numerous powers, dating back to its founding as a Roman fortress, its hosting of a vital Frankish castle during the Early Middle Ages, and its role as a bastion for the Spanish Road between 16th and 17th centuries.
Luxembourg is a member of the European Union, NATO, OECD, the United Nations, and Benelux, reflecting its political consensus in favour of economic, political, and military integration. The city of Luxembourg, which is the capital and largest city, is the seat of several institutions and agencies of the EU. On 18 October 2012, Luxembourg was elected to a temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council for the first time in its history. The country will serve on the Security Council from 1 January 2013 until 31 December 2014.
Reflecting its geographic position, Luxembourg's culture is a fusion of Romanic and Germanic Europe, integrating customs of each. Accordingly, Luxembourg is a trilingual country: Luxembourgish, French and German are official languages. Although a secular state, Luxembourg is predominantly Roman Catholic.

==History==

The recorded history of Luxembourg begins with the acquisition of LucilinburhucKreins (2003), p. 20 (today Luxembourg Castle) situated on the Bock rock by Siegfried, Count of Ardennes, in 963 through an exchange act with St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gouvernement.lu/publications/luxembourg/apropos_histoire/ap_histoire_2008_EN.pdf |title=History of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg |format=PDF[/tpl] Around this fort, a town gradually developed, which became the centre of a state of great strategic value. In the 14th and early 15th centuries, three members of the House of Luxembourg reigned as Holy Roman Emperors. In 1437, the House of Luxembourg suffered a succession crisis, precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne, which led to the territories being sold by Duchess Elisabeth to Philip the Good of Burgundy.Kreins (2003), p. 39
In the following centuries, Luxembourg's fortress was steadily enlarged and strengthened by its successive occupants, the Bourbons, Habsburgs, Hohenzollerns and the French. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Luxembourg was disputed between Prussia and the Netherlands. The Congress of Vienna formed Luxembourg as a Grand Duchy within the German Confederation in personal union with the Netherlands, being at the same time a part of the Netherlands and ruled as one of its provinces, with a Confederate fortress manned by Prussian troops.Kreins (2003), p. 70 This situation was revised by the 1839 First Treaty of London, from which date Luxembourg's full independence is reckoned.Thewes, Guy (2006) (PDF).

The Belgian Revolution of 1830–1839 reduced Luxembourg's territory by more than half, as the predominantly francophone western part of the country was transferred to Belgium. Luxembourg's full independence was established by the 1839 First Treaty of London. In the same year, Luxembourg joined the Zollverein.Kreins (2003), p. 76 Luxembourg's independence and neutrality were again affirmed by the 1867 Second Treaty of London, after the Luxembourg Crisis nearly led to war between Prussia and France.Kreins (2003), pp. 80–81 After the latter conflict, the Confederate fortress was dismantled.Kreins (2003), p. 81
The King of the Netherlands remained Head of State as Grand Duke of Luxembourg, maintaining personal union between the two countries until 1890. At the death of William III, the Dutch throne passed to his daughter Wilhelmina, while Luxembourg (at that time restricted to male heirs by the Nassau Family Pact) passed to Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg.Kreins (2003), p. 84
During World War I, Luxembourg was invaded and occupied by Germany, but was allowed to maintain its independence and political mechanisms.
During World War II, Luxembourg was unable to maintain its policy of neutrality when in 1940 Nazi Germany invaded and occupied the country, due to its strategic location on the invasion route into France. In contrast to the First World War experience, Luxembourg was treated as a Germanic territory and informally annexed to an adjacent province of the Third Reich in 1940. A government in exile based in London fought alongside the Allies, sending a small group of volunteers who participated in the Normandy invasion. Luxembourg was liberated in September 1944. It became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945, and of NATO in 1949.
In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the European Economic Community (later the European Union), and, in 1999, it joined the euro currency area. In 2005, a referendum on the EU treaty establishing a constitution for Europe was held in Luxembourg.Timeline: Luxembourg – A chronology of key events BBC News Online, 9 September 2006.

==Politics==

Luxembourg is a parliamentary democracy headed by a constitutional monarch. Under the constitution of 1868, executive power is exercised by the Grand Duke and the cabinet, which consists of several other ministers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gouvernement.lu/publications/gouvernement/gouvernements_depuis_1848/Les_gouvernements_depuis_1848.pdf |title= The Luxembourgish government since 1848 (in French)[/tpl] The Grand Duke has the power to dissolve the legislature, in which case new elections must be held within three months. However, since 1919, sovereignty has resided with the Nation, exercised by the Grand Duke in accordance with the Constitution and the law.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/textescoordonnes/recueils/constitution_droits_de_lhomme/CONST1.pdf |title=Constitution of Luxembourg |accessdate=23 July 2006 |year=2005 |format=PDF |publisher=Service central de législation[/tpl]
Legislative power is vested in the Chamber of Deputies, a unicameral legislature of sixty members, who are directly elected to five-year terms from four constituencies. A second body, the Council of State (Conseil d'État), composed of twenty-one ordinary citizens appointed by the Grand Duke, advises the Chamber of Deputies in the drafting of legislation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ce.etat.lu/structure.htm |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20060619171336/http://www.ce.etat.lu/structure.htm |archivedate=19 June 2006 |title=Structure of the Conseil d'Etat |accessdate=23 July 2006 |publisher=Conseil d'Etat[/tpl]
The Grand Duchy has three lower tribunals (justices de paix; in Esch-sur-Alzette, the city of Luxembourg, and Diekirch), two district tribunals (Luxembourg and Diekirch) and a Superior Court of Justice (Luxembourg), which includes the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation. There is also an Administrative Tribunal and an Administrative Court, as well as a Constitutional Court, all of which are located in the capital.

===Administrative divisions===

Luxembourg is divided into 3 districts, which are further divided into 12 cantons and then 106 communes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/fr/tourisme/cartes/communes/index.html |title=Carte des communes - Luxembourg.lu - Cartes du Luxembourg |publisher=Luxembourg.public.lu |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl] Twelve of the communes have city status, of which the city of Luxembourg is the largest.
The districts are Diekirch, Grevenmacher, and Luxembourg.

===Foreign relations===

Luxembourg has long been a prominent supporter of European political and economic integration. In efforts foreshadowing European integration, Luxembourg and Belgium in 1921 formed the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) to create an inter-exchangeable currency and a common customs regime. Luxembourg is a member of the Benelux Economic Union and was one of the founding members of the European Economic Community (now the European Union). It also participates in the Schengen Group (named after the Luxembourg village of Schengen where the agreements were signed), whose goal is the free movement of citizens among member states. At the same time, the majority of Luxembourgers have consistently believed that European unity makes sense only in the context of a dynamic transatlantic relationship, and thus have traditionally pursued a pro-NATO, pro-US foreign policy.
Luxembourg is the site of the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Auditors, the Statistical Office of the European Communities ("Eurostat") and other vital EU organs. The Secretariat of the European Parliament is located in Luxembourg, but the Parliament usually meets in nearby Strasbourg.

===Military===

The contribution Luxembourg makes to its defense and to NATO consists of a small army (currently consisting of around 900 people). As a landlocked country, it has no navy.
Luxembourg also lacks an air force, though the 17 NATO AWACS aeroplanes are for convenience registered as aircraft of Luxembourg.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/lux/luxaf1.htm |title=Luxembourg |accessdate=23 July 2006 |date=8 September 2005 |publisher=Aeroflight.co.uk[/tpl] In accordance with a joint agreement with Belgium, both countries have put forth funding for one A400M military cargo plane."A400M Loadmaster, Future Large Aircraft - FLA, Avion de Transport Futur - ATF", GlobalSecurity.org.

==Geography==

Luxembourg is one of the smallest countries in Europe, and ranked 179th in size of all the 194 independent countries of the world; the country is about [tpl]convert|2,586|km2|sqmi[/tpl] in size, and measures [tpl]convert|82|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|57|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] wide. It lies between latitudes 49° and 51° N, and longitudes 5° and 7° E.
To the east, Luxembourg borders the German Bundesland of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, and, to the south, it borders the French région of Lorraine. The Grand Duchy borders the Belgian Walloon Region, in particular the latter's provinces of Luxembourg and Liège, part of which comprises the German-speaking Community of Belgium, to the west and to the north respectively.
The northern third of the country is known as the 'Oesling', and forms part of the Ardennes. It is dominated by hills and low mountains, including the Kneiff near Wilwerdange,[tpl]Wayback |date=20070610225858 |url=http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/publications/horizontales/recueil_communes/recueil_pdf.pdf |title=Mountains in Luxembourg [/tpl], recueil de statistiques par commune. statistiques.public.lu (2003) p. 20 which is the highest point, at 560 metres (1,837 ft). Other mountains are the 'Buurgplaaz' at 559 metres near Huldange and the 'Napoléonsgaard' at 554 metres near Rambrouch. The region is sparsely populated, with only one town (Wiltz) with a population of more than four thousand people.
The southern two-thirds of the country is called the "Gutland", and is more densely populated than the Oesling. It is also more diverse, and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions. The Luxembourg plateau, in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, sandstone formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. Little Switzerland, in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The Moselle valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the southeastern border. The Red Lands, in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns.
The border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three rivers: the Moselle, the Sauer, and the Our. Other major rivers are the Alzette, the Attert, the Clerve, and the Wiltz. The valleys of the mid-Sauer and Attert form the border between the Gutland and the Oesling.
According to the 2012 Environmental Performance Index, Luxembourg is one of the world's best performers in environmental protection, ranking 4th out of 132 assessed countriesEnvironmental Performance Index 2012. Retrieved 21 July 2012.

===Climate===

Luxembourg has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), marked by high precipitation, particularly in late summer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stadtklima.de/webklima/CITIES/Europe/Lx/luxembourg/luxembourg.htm |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070928000326/http://www.stadtklima.de/webklima/CITIES/Europe/Lx/luxembourg/luxembourg.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |title=Luxembourg |accessdate=19 April 2007|publisher=Stadtklima (Urban Climate)[/tpl]

==Economy==

Luxembourg's stable and high-income market economy features moderate growth, low inflation, and a high level of innovation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalinnovationindex.org/gii/main/fullreport/files/Global%20Innovation%20Index%202012.pdf |title=The Global Innovation Index 2012 |accessdate=22 July 2012 |publisher=INSEAD[/tpl] Unemployment is traditionally low, although it had risen to 6.1% by May 2012, due largely to the effect of the 2008 global financial crisis."Statistics Portal, Luxembourg".

The industrial sector, which was dominated by steel until the 1960s, has since diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other products. During the past decades, growth in the financial sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel production. Services, especially banking and finance, account for the majority of economic output. Luxembourg is the world's second largest investment fund centre (after the United States), the most important private banking centre in the eurozone and Europe's leading centre for reinsurance companies. Moreover, the Luxembourg government has aimed to attract internet start-ups, with Skype and Amazon being two of the many internet companies that have shifted their regional headquarters to Luxembourg.
In April 2009, concern about Luxembourg's banking secrecy laws, as well as its reputation as a tax haven, led to its being added to a "grey list" of nations with questionable banking arrangements by the G20. In response, the country soon after adopted OECD standards on exchange of information and was subsequently added into the category of "jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standard".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/51/0,3746,en_2649_33767_43281075_1_1_1_1,00.html|title=Luxembourg makes progress in OECD standards on tax information exchange |date=08/07/2009 |publisher=OECD|date=8 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fidomes.com/newsletter/Report-OECD.pdf |title=A progress report on the jurisdictions surveyed by the OECD Global Forum |format=PDF |date=July 2009 |publisher=OECD[/tpl] In March 2010, the Sunday Telegraph reported that most of Kim Jong-Il's $4bn in secret accounts is in Luxembourg banks.Arlow, Oliver, "Kim Jong-il keeps $4bn 'emergency fund' in European banks", Sunday Telegraph, 14 March 2010.

Agriculture is based on small, family-owned farms.
Luxembourg has especially close trade and financial ties to Belgium and the Netherlands (see Benelux), and as a member of the EU it enjoys the advantages of the open European market.

===Transport===

Luxembourg has efficient road, rail and air transport facilities and services. The road network has been significantly modernised in recent years with [tpl]convert|147|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's railway station while a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport has opened some years ago. There are plans to introduce trams in the capital and light-rail lines in adjacent areas within the next few years.
The number of cars per 1000 persons amount to 680.1 in Luxembourg — lower than just two states, namely the Principality of Monaco and the British overseas territory of Gibraltar.Top Ten: Die Länder mit der höchsten Pkw-Dichte [tpl]de icon[/tpl], Manager Magazin, 2 April 2010.

==Demographics==

===Ethnicity===

The people of Luxembourg are called Luxembourgers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eu2005.lu/en/savoir_lux/societe_tradition/lux_type/index.php |title=Luxembourg Presidency – Being a Luxembourger |publisher=Eu2005.lu |date=29 December 2004 |accessdate=25 April 2010[/tpl] The immigrant population increased in the 20th century due to the arrival of immigrants from Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, and Portugal, with the majority coming from Portugal: in 2013 there were about 88,000 inhabitants with Portuguese nationality.[tpl]cite web|title=Population par sexe et par nationalité (x 1 000) 1981, 1991, 2001 - 2013|url=http://www.statistiques.public.lu/stat/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=384&IF_Language=fra&MainTheme=2&FldrName=1|publisher=Le portail des Statistiques|accessdate=2014-04-09[/tpl] 
Since the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, Luxembourg has seen many immigrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia. Annually, over 10,000 new immigrants arrive in Luxembourg, mostly from the EU states, as well as Eastern Europe. As of 2000, there were 162,000 immigrants in Luxembourg, accounting for 37% of the total population. There were an estimated 5,000 undocumented migrants in Luxembourg as of 1999.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/publications/papers/Country%20Case%20Luxembourg.pdf |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20060902031630/http://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/publications/papers/Country+Case+Luxembourg.pdf |archivedate=2 September 2006 |title=The Regularisation of Unauthorised Migrants: Literature Survey and Country Case Studies – Regularisation programmes in Luxembourg |accessdate=2 September 2006 |format=PDF |author=Amanda Levinson |publisher=Centre on Migration, Policy and Society, University of Oxford[/tpl]

===Language===

Three languages are recognised as official in Luxembourg: French, German, and Luxembourgish, a Franconian language of the Moselle region that is also spoken in neighbouring parts of Belgium, France and Germany. Though Luxembourgish is part of the West Central German group of High German languages, more than 5,000 words in the language are of French origin.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sprooch.com/sproochbe/conferences/conference1/Les%20origines%20et%20l%27histoire%20de%20la%20langue%20luxembourgeoise.doc |title=Origins of Luxembourgish (in French)|publisher=Migration Information Source[/tpl]Lëtzebuergesch léieren (in French) Migration Information Source The first printed sentences in Luxembourgish appeared in a weekly journal, the 'Luxemburger Wochenblatt', in the second edition of 14 April 1821.
Apart from being one of the three official languages, Luxembourgish is also considered the national language of the Grand Duchy; it is the mother tongue or "language of the heart" for nearly all Luxembourgers.[tpl]cite web|title=Europeans and Their Languages|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=European Commission|year=2006|accessdate=5 November 2009|page=7[/tpl]
Each of the three languages is used as the primary language in certain spheres. Luxembourgish is the language that Luxembourgers generally use to speak to each other, but it is not often used as the written language. Since the 1980s, an increasing number of novels have however been written in Luxembourgish. Most official (written) business is carried out in French. German is usually the first language taught in school and is the language of much of the media and of the church.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eu2005.lu/fr/savoir_lux/lux_publications/a_propos_langues/a_propos_langues.pdf |title=À propos des langues |accessdate=1 August 2006 |format=PDF |pages=3–4 |publisher=Service Information et Presse[/tpl]
Luxembourg's education system is trilingual: the first years of primary school are in Luxembourgish, before changing to German, while in secondary school, the language of instruction changes to French.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unavarra.es/tel2l/eng/luxembourg.htm |title=The Trilingual Education system in Luxembourg |accessdate=9 June 2007|publisher=Tel2l – Teacher Education by Learning through two languages, University of Navarra[/tpl] Proficiency in all three languages is required for graduation from secondary school, but half the students leave school without a certified qualification, with the children of immigrants being particularly disadvantaged.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=587 |title=Immigration in Luxembourg: New Challenges for an Old Country|accessdate=9 June 2007 |publisher=Migration Information Source[/tpl]
In addition to the three official languages, English is taught in the compulsory schooling and much of the population of Luxembourg can speak English, especially in Luxembourg City. Portuguese, the language of the largest immigrant community, is also spoken by large parts of the population, but by relatively few from outside their community.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/language/apprendrelu_fr.htm |title=Parlement européen – Lëtzebuergesch léieren (FR) |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=14 December 2000 |accessdate=9 May 2010[/tpl]
French is the preferred language of the government. Official legislation must be conducted in French.

===Religion===

Luxembourg is a secular state, but the state recognises certain religions as officially mandated religions. This gives the state a hand in religious administration and appointment of clergy, in exchange for which the state pays certain running costs and wages. Currently, religions covered by such arrangements are Roman Catholicism, Judaism, Greek Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, Russian Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, Mennonitism and Islam.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wort.lu/articles/5957651.html |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080522103349/http://www.wort.lu/articles/5957651.html |archivedate=22 May 2008 |title=D'Wort article (German) |accessdate=24 July 2007 |publisher=www.wort.lu[/tpl]
Since 1980 it has been illegal for the government to collect statistics on religious beliefs or practices.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1979/0291104/0291104.pdf#page=2 |title=Mémorial A, 1979, No. 29 |accessdate=1 August 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=Service central de législation[/tpl] An estimation by the CIA Factbook for the year 2000 is that 87% of Luxembourgers are Catholic, including the royal family, the remaining 13% being made up of Muslims, Protestants, Orthodox Christians, Jews, and those of other or no religion.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/lu.html |title=World Factbook – Luxembourg |accessdate=13 January 2007 |date=19 December 2006 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency[/tpl] According to a 2010 Pew Research Center study 70.4% are Christian, 2.3% Muslim, 26.8% unaffiliated and 0.5% other religionsGlobal Religious Landscape Pew Research Center 2010
According to a 2005 Eurobarometer poll,Eurobarometer on Social Values, Science and technology 2005 – page 11 44% of Luxembourg citizens responded that "they believe there is a God", whereas 28% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 22% that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force".

===Education===

The University of Luxembourg is the only university in the country.

===Health===

Luxembourg sells the most alcohol in Europe per capita.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.finfacts.ie/Private/bestprice/alcoholdrinkconsumptionpriceseurope.htm |title= World/Global Alcohol/Drink Consumption 2009 [/tpl] However, the large proportion of alcohol purchased by customers from neighbouring countries contributes to the statistically high level of alcohol sales per capita; this level of alcohol sales is thus not representative of the actual alcohol consumption of the Luxembourg population.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/esp2007-obj-01.pdf |title= Consommation annuelle moyenne d’alcool par habitant, Catholic Ministry of Health|work=sante.gouv.fr|year=2007[/tpl]

==Culture==

Luxembourg has been overshadowed by the culture of its neighbours, although, having been for much of its history a profoundly rural country, it retains a number of folk traditions. There are several notable museums, mostly located in the capital; these include the National Museum of History and Art (MNHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, and the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam). The National Museum of Military History (MNHM) in Diekirch is especially known for its representations of the Battle of the Bulge. The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications.[tpl]cite web |url=http://shanghai.mae.lu/en/The-Grandy-Duchy-of-Luxembourg/Culture |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110722155017/http://shanghai.mae.lu/en/The-Grandy-Duchy-of-Luxembourg/Culture |archivedate=22 July 2011 |title= Culture|work=Ministère des Affaires Etrangères, Luxembourg[/tpl]
The country has produced some internationally known artists, including the painters Théo Kerg, Joseph Kutter and Michel Majerus, as well as the photographer Edward Steichen. Steichen's The Family of Man exhibition is now permanently housed in Clervaux, and it has been placed on UNESCO's Memory of the World register. Movie star Loretta Young was of Luxembourgish descent.
Luxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, the European Capital of Culture[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mcesr.public.lu/presse/annee_culturelle_2007/portail_luxembourg_2007/Rapport_final_anglais.pdf |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110503184358/http://www.mcesr.public.lu/presse/annee_culturelle_2007/portail_luxembourg_2007/Rapport_final_anglais.pdf |archivedate=3 May 2011 |title= Luxembourg and Greater Region, European Capital of Culture 2007|date=June 2008[/tpl] was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders in all areas, physical, psychological, artistic and emotional.
Luxembourg was represented at the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China from 1 May to 31 October 2010 with its own pavilion.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sepb.gov.cn/english/downloads/Expo2010.pdf |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110721012004/http://www.sepb.gov.cn/english/downloads/Expo2010.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |title= Environmental Report for Expo 2010 Shanghai China|date= June 2009| page =85 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.luxembourgforbusiness.lu/sites/default/files/file/Programme%20Luxembourg%20Commercial%20Week%20at%20Expo%202010.pdf |title= Luxembourg pavilion at the World Expo 2010 Shanghai[/tpl] The pavilion was based on the transliteration of the word Luxembourg into Chinese, "Lu Sen Bao", which means "Forest and Fortress". It represented Luxembourg as the "Green Heart in Europe".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.2010shanghai.eu/images/stories/eu-pavilions/luxembourg-pavilion/luxembourg.pdf |format=PDF |title=Luxembourg pavilion displays green heart of Europe |publisher=Shanghai Daily |date=12 November 2007 |accessdate= 24 December 2011[/tpl]

===Sport===

Unlike in most countries in Europe, sport in Luxembourg is not concentrated upon a particular national sport, but encompasses a number of sports, both team and individual. Despite the lack of a central sporting focus, over 100,000 people in Luxembourg, which has a total population of only 512,353, are licensed members of one sports federation or another.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/cultural_co-operation/Sport/Monitoring_fulfillment/Anti-Doping_Convention/4.Luxembourg.asp |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20040623101906/http://www.coe.int/T/E/cultural_co-operation/Sport/Monitoring_fulfillment/Anti-Doping_Convention/4.Luxembourg.asp |archivedate=23 June 2004 |title=Luxembourg |accessdate=25 November 2006 |year=2003 |publisher=Council of Europe [/tpl] The largest sports venue in the country is d'Coque, an indoor arena and Olympic swimming pool in Kirchberg, north-eastern Luxembourg City, which has a capacity of 8,300. The arena is used for basketball, handball, gymnastics, and volleyball, including the final of the 2007 Women's European Volleyball Championship. The largest, and national, stadium is the Stade Josy Barthel, in western Luxembourg City; named after the country's only official Olympic gold medallist, the stadium has a capacity of 8,054.
Famous sportspeople include Marc Girardelli, former alpine ski racer and five-time World Cup overall champion, Gilles Müller and Mandy Minella, both professional tennis players, and Andy Schleck and Fränk Schleck, both professional cyclists for RadioShack-Nissan-Trek who are best known as climbers who excel in the mountain stages of Grand Tours like the Tour de France.

===Cuisine===

Luxembourg cuisine reflects Luxembourg's position on the border between the Latin and Germanic worlds, being heavily influenced by the cuisines of neighboring France and Germany. More recently, it has been influenced by its many Italian and Portuguese immigrants.
Most native Luxembourg dishes, consumed as the traditional daily fare, share roots in the country's peasantry, as in Germany and in marked contrast to the more sophisticated[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] French.

===Media===

Luxembourg is known in Europe for its radio and television stations (Radio Luxembourg, RTL Group). It is also the uplink home of SES, carrier of major European satellite services for Germany and Britain. An English language news service is also available from the Luxemburger Wort."Luxembourg Newspapers", OnlineNewspapers.com. Retrieved 27 June 2012.
Due to the audiovisual law of 1988, which established a special tax regime for audiovisual investment, the film and co-production in Luxembourg has grown steadily.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eu2005.lu/en/savoir_lux/culture/pays_cine/index.php |title=Luxembourg, a film country |publisher=Eu2005.lu |date=29 December 2004 |accessdate=25 April 2010[/tpl] There are some 30 registered production companies in Luxembourg.[ref]The Film Fund of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg

As a result of this policy, Luxembourg has won an Oscar in 2014  in the category "Animated Short Films" with "Mr.Hublot".
