==Fairport Convention years==

Rowland's involvement with Fairport Convention began in 1972, a particularly turbulent year for them, during which they had three drummers.[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r37063|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=allmusic ((( The Manor Album [Not Released > Overview ))) |publisher=www.allmusic.com |accessdate=2010-01-09 [/tpl] His contributions later appeared on the unreleased, but much bootlegged "The Manor Album".[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r37063/credits|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=allmusic ((( The Manor Album [Not Released > Credits ))) |publisher=www.allmusic.com |accessdate=2010-01-09 [/tpl]
The arrangement became more formal during the recording of Rising for the Moon (1975), when Dave Mattacks left the band during the recording sessions, due to differences between himself and producer Glyn Johns.[tpl]cite book |last=Humphries |first=Patrick |title=Meet on the Ledge: A History of Fairport Convention |year=1982 |publisher=Eel Pie Publishing |location=London |isbn=0-906008-46-8 |page=87 [/tpl] Following a tour, during which roadie Paul Warren played the drums, Johns suggested Bruce Rowland as a permanent replacement for Mattacks. By the following album, Gottle O'Geer, Rowland had become a full member of the band and his contributions extended beyond drums to keyboards and backing vocals, and this continued with the two succeeding studio albums The Bonny Bunch of Roses and Tipplers Tales, and the 1979 live album Farewell Farewell. Fairport took a break apart from playing concerts between 1979 and 1985 and during this period Rowland (sometimes at the same time as Mattacks) provided drums for these performances;[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.musikfolk.co.uk/expletive-delighted/rollcall.htm |title=Fairport Convention Fansite " Expletive-Delighted!" - Various Lineups |publisher=www.musikfolk.co.uk |accessdate=2010-01-10 [/tpl] he appears on the live album of the 1981 reunion, Moat on the Ledge. Rowland later quit the music business and moved to Denmark.[tpl]cite book |last1=Redwood |first1=Fred |last2=Woodward |first2=Martin |title=The Woodworm Era: The story of today's Fairport Convention |year=1995 |publisher=Jeneva Publishing |location=Thatcham |isbn=0-9525860-0-2 |page=18 [/tpl]
