Mahavidyas (Great Wisdoms) or Dasha-Mahavidyas are a group of ten aspects of the Divine Mother Durga or Kali herself or Devi in Hinduism. The 10 Mahavidyas are Wisdom Goddesses, who represent a spectrum of feminine divinity, from horrific goddesses at one end, to the gentle at the other.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.in/books/about/Hindu_Goddesses.html?id=hgTOZEyrVtIC|title=Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition|last=Kinsley|first=David R|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publication|year=1987|pages=161–165|isbn=9788120803947[/tpl]
The development of Mahavidyas represents an important turning point in the history of Shaktism as it marks the rise of Bhakti aspect in Shaktism, which reached its zenith in 1700 CE. First sprung forth in the post-Puranic age, around 6th century C.E., it was a new theistic movement in which the supreme being was envisioned as female. A fact epitomized by texts like Devi-Bhagavata Purana, especially its last nine chapters (31-40) of the seventh skandha, which are known as the Devi Gita, and soon became central texts of Shaktism.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OxayHczql9EC|title=The Devī Gītā: The Song of the Goddess|last=Brown|first=Charles Mackenzie|year=1998|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791439401|page=23[/tpl]

The Mahabhagavata Purana and Brhaddharma Purana however, list Shodashi (Sodasi) as Tripura Sundari, her another name. The Guhyatiguyha-tantra associates the Mahavidyas with the ten Avatars of Vishnu, and states that the Mahavidyas are the source from which the avatars of Vishnu arose. All ten forms of the Goddess, whether gentle or terrifying, are worshiped as the universal Mother.
