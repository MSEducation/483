South Elmsall pronounced "south em-sull" is a small town and civil parish to the east of Hemsworth in the City of Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England. It is on the B6422 and B6474 (which leads to North Elmsall and Upton).
It neighbours South Kirkby, and they are often grouped together as one town because the towns are joined together which can make it difficult to know where one stops and the other begins. The town is close to the southern boundary of West Yorkshire, and is [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl] from the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster in South Yorkshire. The A638 Doncaster to Wakefield road runs close to the north of the town, which leads to junction 38 of the A1(M) [tpl]convert|3|mi|km[/tpl] to the south-east. It now has its own bypass which links the A1 to the Hemsworth Bypass providing excellent transport links towards Barnsley and South Yorkshire.  The town has a population of 6,107.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/viewFullDataset.do?instanceSelection=03070&productId=779&$ph=60_61&datasetInstanceId=3070&startColumn=1&numberOfColumns=8&containerAreaId=790273 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |title=Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Wakefield|accessdate=11 September 2009[/tpl]

==Coal mining==

The town is most famous for its coal-mining past; it was the site of Frickley Colliery, which was one of the largest in the whole country and a key source of union radicalism. The colliery is named after the nearby village of Frickley in South Yorkshire which continues to be the home of the Warde-Aldham family who owned the coal reserves exploited by the pit. During the UK Miners' Strike (1984-1985), there were numerous disturbances in the area. It was one of the last pits to return to work after the strike, seeing as it was picketed by a group of hardliners from Kent who continued to picket Frickley after the NUM had called off the strike.  The Frickley miners refused to cross the hardliners' picket.Wakefield Express The Miners' Strike 25th anniversary special edition, p. 3, Friday 6 March 2009
The colliery was closed on 26 November 1993 following closures of nearby pits like Ferrymoor-Riddings (1985), Kinsley (1986), South Kirkby (1988) and Grimethorpe (1992). The area around Hemsworth was long one of the most depressed areas of the whole European Union, although fortunes have improved recently.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
The town hosts a number of key landmarks that have a place in the wider history of the labour movement in the UK. In addition to the coal mine, the Miner's Institute served as a nerve centre during the strikes of the 1970s and 1980s.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] The Moorthorpe Empire WMC played a key role in the exchange of ideas, the maintenance of morale and the harnessing of community spirit during 1984.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] During this period, the Empire became a place for the celebration of unshackled unionism, internationalism, feminism, and even a sympathy for non-violent Irish republicanism.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
Several clubs in the area still bear the colliery's name.  There is Frickley Colliery Brass Band, a famous football team named Frickley Athletic and a cricket club named "Frickley".  Frickley Athletic F.C. now play in the Northern Premier League Premier Division and nearly gained promotion in 2006.

==Frickley Country Park==

Wakefield MDC in conjunction with local town councils have organized the landscaping of the former Frickley Colliery site into a country park. A large amount of money from the National Coalfield Programme has enabled this work to go ahead. This park officially opened in September 2009, however changes had to be made to many of the entrances since the builders measured the gates wrong which meant a cyclist was not able to fit their cycle through, which was a bit of a let down after so much money had been ploughed into the scheme. The site will offer walks and play areas for local inhabitants as well as space for new housing developments when the current economic downturn begins to lift.

==Local economy==

The market is a central feature of the village; it is currently undergoing renovations. The market plays host to approximately 105 trading stalls which is remarkable for a provincial market.

Also present on the Dale Lane industrial estate are 4 Next Distribution warehouses (Stadium Way One, Stadium Way Two, Elmsall Way and Elmsall Drive), Superdrug, Del Monte and Finlays.
