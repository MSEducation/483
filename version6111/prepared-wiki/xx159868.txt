Black-goggled Tanager (Trichothraupis melanops) is a species of bird in the family, Thraupidae. It is the only member of the genus  Trichothraupis. It is found at low levels in forest and woodland in a large part of eastern and southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and far north-eastern Argentina, with a disjunct population along the East Andean slope in Peru, Bolivia and far north-western Argentina. While generally common and widespread, and consequenly considered to be of least concern by BirdLife International and IUCN, the population associated with the Andes is relatively local and uncommon.
The underparts are tawny, the back and head are dull brownish-olive, and the tail and wings are contrastingly black (the latter with a white speculum that is difficult to see when perched, but conspicuous in flight). The male has a yellow crown patch and a large black patch around the eyes (the black "goggles" for which the species is named).
