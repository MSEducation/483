The oldest surviving Hebrew Bible manuscripts including the Dead Sea Scrolls date to about the 2nd century BCE (fragmentary) and some are stored at the Shrine of the Book in Jerusalem. The oldest record of the complete text survives in a Greek translation called the Septuagint, dating to the 4th century CE (Codex Sinaiticus). The oldest extant manuscripts of the vocalized Masoretic text, which modern editions are based upon, date to the 9th century CE.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] With the exception of a few biblical sections in the Prophets, virtually no biblical text is contemporaneous with the events it describes[tpl]harvnb|Bernstein|1996|p=134[/tpl]
From the internal testimony of the texts, the individual books of the 27-book New Testament canon are likely dated to the 1st century CE. The first book written was probably 1 Thessalonians, written at around 50 CE.Raymond E. Brown, An Introduction to the New Testament, Anchor Bible, 1997. pp. 456-466. The last book of the canon is the Book of Revelation said to be written by John of Patmos during the reign of Domitian (81-96).Robert Mounce. The Book of Revelation, pg. 15-16. Cambridge: Eerdman's.

Since the original writing of the scriptures, huge volumes of copies have been made of the originals, which are no longer extant, and copies have been made of those copies, resulting in several text types. Archaeologists have recovered about 5,500 New Testament manuscripts, being fragments or complete books.Robert Stewart, The Reliability of the New Testament: Bart Ehrman and Daniel Wallace in Dialogue p17 The earliest extant fragment of the New Testament is the Rylands Library Papyrus P52, a piece of the Gospel of John dated to the first half of the 2nd century. Dating the composition of the texts relies primarily on internal evidence, including direct references to historical events, as resorting to textual criticism, philological and linguistic evidence is very subjective.

==The Hebrew Bible==

===Torah===

The first five books of the bible in Judaism are called the Torah, meaning "instruction" (it was translated to nomos/law in the Septuagint), and are regarded as the most important section of the Scriptures, traditionally thought to have been written between the 16th century and the 12th century BCE by Moses himself. Followers of the Copenhagen School place its origins in 5th century Yehud Medinata.Ska, Jean-Louis, "Introduction to reading the Pentateuch" (Eisenbrauns, 2006) pp.217 ff.[tpl]request quotation|date=December 2012[/tpl]
Deuteronomy is treated separately from Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers. The process of its formation probably took several hundred years, from the 8th century to the 6th BCE.Miller, Patrick D., "Deuteronomy" (John Knox Press, 1990) pp.2â€“3 It began as no more than the set of religious laws which today make up the bulk of the book; later it was extended in order to be used as the introduction to the comprehensive history of Israel written in the early part of the 6th century; and later still it was detached from the history, extended yet again, and used to conclude the story told in Genesis-Exodus-Leviticus-Numbers.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=T-Vi9eK_vS0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Pentateuch+Social+Science+Commentary#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Van Seters, John, "The Pentateuch: a social-science commentary" T&T Clark, 2004) p.93 |publisher=Google Books |date= 23 August 2004|accessdate=3 October 2010|isbn=978-0-567-08088-2[/tpl]
