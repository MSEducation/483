==History==

On October 10, 1857, the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church created a college to supply ministers for Norwegian congregations in the Upper Midwest. Until the college was established in 1861, students studied at Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. On October 14, 1859, the Rev. Peter Laurentius Larsen was appointed professor to the Norwegian students at Concordia by the NELC.
Upon the closing of the seminary in April 1861, at the start of the Civil War, the NELC decided to open its own college that fall in a former parsonage at Halfway Creek, Wisconsin, just north of La Crosse, Wisconsin and close to present day Holmen, Wisconsin. On September 1, 1861, classes officially began with an enrollment of 16. The following year classes moved to Decorah, Iowa, with NELC Pastor Ulrik Vilhelm Koren successfully arranging the college's relocation and permanent settlement.
In 1866, a group of students signed a "bill of rights" criticizing the rigid schedule, the rules about going downtown, the lack of windows in some of the sleeping rooms, and the wood cutting and shoe shining chores, concluding that "there was not enough freedom".[tpl]cite book|last=Nelson|first=David Theodore|title=Luther College, 1861-1961 |url= |accessdate= |year=1961 |publisher=Luther College Press |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=76–77[/tpl] The leader, 18 year old Rasmus Anderson was expelled. This event was viewed as a rebellion and "the worse of sins" by the pastors assembled in a pastoral conference shortly after.
In 1905, Dr. Carlo A. Sperati, an 1888 graduate of Luther, became the music director of the college and developed the Luther College Concert Band, founded in 1878, on the model of the wind ensemble pioneered by John Philip Sousa. Under Sperati, the band undertook several tours of Europe, their first in 1914, earning international acclaim for their musical talent. Sperati remained on the faculty until his death in 1945.
In 1932, Luther College dropped its mandatory study of the classics and embraced the modern concept of the liberal arts education. Due to financial constraints associated with the Great Depression, the college decided to admit women to the student body in 1936. During the 1960s Luther constructed several new campus buildings and adopted a 4-1-4 semester schedule.
In 1964, Luther's museum collection became separate from the college and was established as the Norwegian-American Museum. Now known as Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum, it is the largest and most comprehensive museum in the United States devoted to a single immigrant group. Nordic Fest, started in 1967, grew from Luther College Women’s Club annual celebration of Norwegian Constitution Day.

==Music==

Luther has a number of music organizations that tour and sell recordings internationally. The Nordic Choir, Concert Band, Symphony Orchestra and Jazz Orchestra are the college's four internationally touring ensembles, which have performed in many of the major concert halls and music centers of Europe, as well as Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, and the Caribbean.https://www.luther.edu/music/tours/ About 40 percent of the student body participates in at least one of the college's seven choirs, three concert bands, three string orchestras, and two jazz ensembles.https://www.luther.edu/admissions/information/profile/ "Christmas at Luther," Luther's annual Christmas concert, is broadcast nationwide each year."PBS" The sound-only concert broadcast is updated annually, with the professionally-produced televised version updated every four years.
Much of Luther's musical heritage can be largely attributed to the influence of two long-serving individuals. The 40-year tenure of Dr. Carlo A. Sperati, Class of 1888, fostered the college's Lutheran musical tradition beginning in 1905 and developed the Luther College Concert Band into one a nationally touring music ensemble. Sperati's Concert Band quickly achieved national acclaim, and famed bandmaster John Philip Sousa canceled a performance of his own touring ensemble just so that he could attend a performance of the Luther College Concert Band, which was scheduled to appear in a nearby city.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
Sperati's foundation was built upon by Weston Noble '43, himself a student of Sperati. Following three years of U.S. Army enlistment in World War II, Noble returned to his alma mater to conduct the Concert Band and the Nordic Choir, direct Christmastime performances of George Frederic Handel's Messiah, and teach in the Music Department. Noble's bands (which he conducted until 1973) and choirs completed coast-to-coast tours and international appearances. Ensembles under his direction performed solo concerts at such venues as Lincoln Center and Town Hall in New York; the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC; the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City; Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles; Orchestra Hall at Symphony Center in Chicago; Orchestra Hall and the State Theatre in Minneapolis; and the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts in Saint Paul. Under Noble's direction, Luther ensembles also appeared at historic cathedrals and concert halls throughout Europe, Russia, and Scandinavia, as well as on the programs of many national conventions of the American Bandmasters Association, the American Choral Directors Association, and the Music Educators National Conference.
The Nordic Choir was featured in the film "The Joy of Bach," and in four weekly international broadcasts of "The Hour of Power" from the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California. Weston Noble retired from the faculty at the close of the academic year in 2005, having served continuously for 57 years, from 1948 to 2005.
The Nordic Choir, which tours internationally, is one of the seven choral ensembles at Luther. Collegiate Chorale is a mixed choir composed of juniors and seniors. Cathedral Choir is a mixed choir that draws exclusively from the sophomore class. Aurora (formerly known as Pike Kor, which is Norwegian for "young women's choir") and Norsemen are gendered choirs composed entirely of first-year students. Cantorei is a women's choir drawing membership from all classes, primarily sophomore through senior. Collegium Musicum is an Early Music ensemble specializing in the music of the Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque periods. The ensemble is open to singers of all years at Luther. In addition to the seven choirs, the Vocal Jazz Ensemble is open to first through fourth year students and often performs jointly with Luther's instrumental jazz ensembles.https://www.luther.edu/music/ensembles/
Symphony Orchestra, Jazz Orchestra, and Concert Band also tour internationally. Symphony Orchestra establishes residency in Vienna every four years, and Jazz Orchestra has toured in the Caribbean and Brazil. Concert Band travels to Japan and China following spring semester every four years. Other instrumental ensembles include Chamber Orchestra, Philharmonia, Jazz Band, Varsity Band, Brass Ensemble, and Wind & Percussion Ensemble.https://www.luther.edu/music/tours/
Currently, Joan deAlbuquerque conducts the Concert Band, and Allen Hightower has succeeded Craig Arnold (who succeeded Weston Noble) as Director of Choral Activities and conductor of Nordic Choir. Daniel Baldwin conducts the Luther College Symphony Orchestra, and Juan-Tony Guzmán directs Jazz Orchestra.
Luther students also participate in faculty-coached student chamber ensembles ranging from piano trios to a full flute choir.  Some of these ensembles include the Luther Ringers student handbell choir; the 40+ member Trombone Choir; five student-led, small-group a cappella ensembles; the Luther College Balalaika ensemble; and the student-led Luther Gospel Choir.
In 1996, musician Dave Matthews appeared in concert with Tim Reynolds at Luther College in the Center for Faith and Life, the site of their 1999 album Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds Live at Luther College.
In 2002, the Empire Brass, with college organist William Kuhlman, appeared in concert and recorded an album,  Baroque Music for Brass and Organ, in the Center for Faith and Life.
In 2008, musician Ben Folds appeared for his second time in concert at Luther College in the Center for Faith and Life. During the concert, crowd tracks were recorded to be incorporated into his most recently released album.
