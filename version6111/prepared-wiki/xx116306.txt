==History==

===Erie Railroad & Erie-Lackawanna Railroad===

The Mountain View station was one of two stations in Wayne built on the New York and Greenwood Lake Railway, run by the Erie Railroad. The line ran from the Erie's Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City to Sterling Forest station on the New Jersey / New York state line. There was a second station constructed in Wayne, north of Mountain View at the Ryerson Avenue crossing.[tpl]cite map|title=Map of Erie Railroad Stations|year=1920|publisher=Erie Railroad|cartography=Erie Railroad[/tpl] In 1935, train service was cutback to Wanaque-Midvale station in Wanaque, New Jersey. After the Erie Railroad and Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad merged in October 1960, plans started in 1963 to abandon the former Lackawanna Boonton Branch, a freight railroad built in 1869. This line also had a second Mountain View station. That year, the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad tied the Boonton Line and Greenwood Lake lines together at Mountain View Junction. The portion of the Boonton Branch east of the junction was abandoned and the Greenwood Lake was reduced to shuttle service north of Mountain View.
At that time, the wooden station depot at Mountain View built by the Erie was demolished and replaced by an Armco metal building on the platform, which boasted two tracks. One track served as the new Boonton Line, which turned westward to Lincoln Park. The other track served as the transfer for the now Wanaque-Midvale shuttle, serving the old Greenwood Lake north of Mountain View, including the Ryerson Avenue station. The shuttle service was discontinued in October 1966, along with the Ryerson Avenue station.[tpl]cite book|last=Yanosey|first=Robert J.|title=Erie Railroad Facilities (In Color)|publisher=Morning Sun Books Inc.|location=Scotch Plains, New Jersey|year=2006|volume=Volume 1: New Jersey|pages=76|isbn=1-58248-183-0[/tpl] The track was torn up south of Pequannock and as a result, the station shelter and canopy resides on the old shuttle track. The track redirected onto the Boonton Branch is still in use and is the lone track through Mountain View.

==Lackawanna Railroad station==

A second Mountain View station, this one on the Lackawanna line from Hoboken on the Boonton Branch, once stood near the Parish Drive bridge, behind the PAL facility.  Evidence of the freight house platforms, stairways, track dividers, etc. are still visible.[tpl]google maps|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Mountain+View+NJ&sll=37.09024,-112.5&sspn=40.681389,112.5&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Mountain+View,+Passaic,+New+Jersey&ll=40.913675,-74.260453&spn=0.000594,0.001717&t=h&z=20|title=Aerial of Parish Drive over former Lackawanna Railroad tracks|accessdate=16 November 2010[/tpl] This station had passenger rail service until the 1963 realignment project. The Morris Canal passed through the western most bridge pier of the Parish Drive overpass.
