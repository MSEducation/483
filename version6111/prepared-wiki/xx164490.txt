==Spiritual Life== 
Fontbonne’s culture is strongly tied to its Catholic tradition. At school Masses, students and faculty sing the hymn, “The Servant Song,” to express a spirit of service to other members of the Fontbonne family and to the larger community.

==Culture==

Fontbonne maintains the small school environment through competitive enrollment and small class size. Maximum enrollment for each of the four years is about 120 young women. Students are assigned to a faculty advisor or FA and the homeroom led by the FA for four years. The faculty advisor develops a relationship with each student and works to actively discuss the student’s problems, achievements, interests and goals.[tpl]cite web|title=School Handbook 2013-2014|url=http://www.fontbonne.org/files/_sbCma_/4e03ef8d368e65c93745a49013852ec4/CALENDAR_2013-2014_Handbook.pdf|work=Fontbonne Hall Academy[/tpl]

During the Open House and at assemblies throughout the school year, the 1980s sitcom Cheers’ theme song, “Where Everybody Knows Your Name,” is played to emphasize the close-knit academic environment.

==Traditions==

===Activities===

Due to the small class size for each year, the school fosters strong relationships among the student body. Each year, incoming freshmen are paired with senior students or “Senior Sisters,” who mentor new students during the first year of high school. 
There is an annual competition among the four years called "Sports Night." Each year selects a theme, which shapes a series of athletic and performative components, including gymnastics, dance, a skit and an original song, that are scored by a panel of judges to win the overall competition. The tradition is nearly 50 years old with nearly 80 percent of all students participating in at least one aspect of Sports Night.[tpl]cite web|title=March Parent Newsletter|url=http://www.fontbonne.org/files/_yfLUW_/18200907a30c1d993745a49013852ec4/March_Parent_Newsletter.pdf|work=Fontbonne Hall Academy[/tpl]
