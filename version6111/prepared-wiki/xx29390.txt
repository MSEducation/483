==Resolution==

The separation of a racemate into its components, the pure enantiomers, is called a chiral resolution. There are various methods, including crystallization, chromatography, and the use of enzymes. The first successful resolution of a racemate was performed by Louis Pasteur, who manually separated the crystals of a conglomerate.

==Synthesis==

Without a chiral influence (for example a chiral catalyst, solvent or starting material), a chemical reaction that makes a chiral product will always yield a racemate. That can make the synthesis of a racemate cheaper and easier than making the pure enantiomer, because it does not require special conditions. This fact also leads to the question of how biological homochirality evolved on what is presumed to be a racemic primordial earth. 
The reagents of, and the reactions that produce, racemic mixtures are said to be "not stereospecific" or "not stereoselective," for their indecision in a particular stereoisomerism.

==Racemic pharmaceuticals==

Some drug molecules are chiral, and the enantiomers have different effects on biological entities. They can be sold as one enantiomer or as a racemic mixture. Examples include thalidomide, ibuprofen, and salbutamol. Adderall is an unequal mixture of both amphetamine enantiomers.  A single amphetamine dose combines the neutral sulfate salts of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine, with the dextro isomer of amphetamine saccharate and D/L-amphetamine aspartate monohydrate.  The prescription analgesic tramadol is also a racemate.
In some cases (e.g., ibuprofen and thalidomide), the enantiomers interconvert or racemize in vivo. This means that preparing a pure enantiomer for medication is largely pointless. However, sometimes samples containing pure enantiomers may be made and sold at a higher cost in cases where the use requires specifically one isomer (e.g., for a stereospecific reagent); compare omeprazole and esomeprazole.
While often only one enantiomer of the drug may be active, in cases like salbutamol(R)-Albuterol for Asthma: Pro, Bill T. Ameredes and William J. Calhoun and thalidomide, the other enantiomer may be harmful.  The (R) enantiomer of thalidomide is effective against morning sickness, while the (S) enantiomer is teratogenic, causing birth defects. Since the drug racemizes, the drug cannot be considered safe for use by women of child-bearing age,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/lep/research/thalidomide/en/index.html |title=Use of thalidomide in leprosy |work=WHO:leprosy elimination |publisher=WHO |accessdate=22 April 2010[/tpl] and its use is tightly controlled when used for treating other illness.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/17/us/thalidomide-approved-to-treat-leprosy-with-other-uses-seen.html|title=Thalidomide Approved to Treat Leprosy, With Other Uses Seen|newspaper=New York Times|author=Sheryl Gay Stolberg|accessdate=8 January 2012|date=17 July 1998[/tpl]
Methamphetamine is available by prescription under the brand name Desoxyn. The active component of Desoxyn is dextromethamphetamine hydrochloride. This is the right-hand isomer of methamphetamine. The left-handed isomer of methamphetamine, levomethamphetamine, is an OTC drug that is less centrally-acting and more peripherally-acting.
In the development of manufacturing chemical process for a chiral drug, some intermediates and the final active have to be purified by crystallization. Only compounds which crystallized as conglomerates must be selected for crystallization to get enantiomeric quality (see for more complete explanation: Impact Racemate and Conglomerate on purification)

==Wallach's rule==

Wallach's rule (first proposed by Otto Wallach) states that racemic crystals tend to be denser than their chiral counterparts.(Wallach, O. (1895). Liebigs Ann. Chem. 286, 90-143.)  This rule  has been substantiated by crystallographic database analysis [ref]
