==History==

Chamber pots were used in ancient Greece at least since the 6th century BC and were known under different names: ἀμίς (amis),ἀμίς, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus οὐράνη (ouranē)οὐράνη, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus and οὐρητρίς (ourētris,οὐρητρίς, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus from οὖρον - ouron, "urine"οὖρον,  Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus), σκωραμίς / (skōramis), χερνίβιον (chernibion).χερνίβιον, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus
The introduction of indoor toilets started to displace chamber pots in the 19th century but such pots were in common use until the mid-20th century.
Chamber pots continue in use [tpl]As of|2008|alt=today[/tpl] in countries lacking indoor plumbing such as rural areas of China, and have been redesigned as the bedpan for use with the very ill.
In North America and the UK, the term "potty" is often used when discussing the toilet with small children, such as during potty training. It is also usually used to refer to the small, toilet-shaped devices made especially for potty training, which are similar to chamber pots. These "potties" are generally a large plastic bowl with an ergonomically-designed back and front to protect against splashes. They may have a built-in handle or grasp at the back to allow emptying and a non-slip bottom to prevent the child from sliding while in use. Some are given bright colours such as pink, red, blue and purple (generally depending on the child's gender), and some sort of cartoon. In many cases they are used since it is difficult for children to get up onto the normal toilet; in addition the larger opening in the regular toilet is much too large for a child to sit over comfortably and not fall in without some type of aid. Their size means they can be packed away in a bag for days out or camping with young children, and can be placed near or under beds for sufferers of nocturia or some other form of incontinence.
In the Philippines, chamber pots are used as urinals and are commonly called Arinola in most Philippine languages, such as Tagalog and Cebuano[tpl]cite news|last=Ocampo|first=Ambeth|title=‘Mambo Magsaysay’ and Quirino’s golden ‘orinola|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20100309-257665/Mambo-Magsaysay-and-Quirinos-golden-orinola|accessdate=26 September 2013|newspaper=Inquirer|date=9 March 2010[/tpl]
In Korea, chamber pots are referred to as yogang (요강).  They were commonly used by people who did not have indoor plumbing to avoid the cold elements during the winter months and are commonly used in North Korea to this day.
