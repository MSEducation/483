CATEGORIES: Formula One designers, 1940 births, Living people

Tony Southgate (born 25 May 1940, Coventry, England) is a British engineer and former racing car designer. He designed many successful cars, including Jaguar's Le Mans-winning XJR-9, and cars for almost every type of circuit racing. He was responsible for the chassis design of Ford's RS200 Group B rally car. Southgate was employed as chief designer or technical director for many Formula One teams for over twenty years. These teams included BRM, Shadow and Arrows. Southgate retired after producing the Audi R8C, which was a major influence in the Bentley Speed 8, which won Le Mans in 2003. He continues to be a regular visitor to current and historic race meetings.

==Early career at Lola and Eagle==

Tony Southgate became interested in motorsport during his engineering apprenticeship and, like many aspiring racing designers in the late 1950s, was a member of the 750 Motor Club.[tpl]cite web|title=Famous Members|url=http://www.750mc.co.uk/about-famous-members.php|work=750 Motor Club|accessdate=29 September 2011[/tpl] The 750MC was a training ground for motorsport luminaries such as Colin Chapman, Eric Broadley and Brian Hart. In 1962 Broadley gave Southgate his first job, as a draughtsman for Lola Cars.[tpl]cite book|last=Southgate|first=Tony|title=From Drawing Board to Chequered Flag|year=2010|publisher=Motor Racing Publications|location=Croydon, UK|isbn=978-1-899870-82-0[/tpl] Southgate gained a broad grounding in many areas of motorsport design while at Lola. He was involved in projects as wide-ranging as the lithe, 1.5 litre Lola Mk4A Formula One car and the 5.0 litre Lola T70[tpl]cite news|last=Dron|first=Tony|title=Lola|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/2738933/Lola.html|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=3 October 2011|location=London|date=17 December 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Owen|first=Richard|title=1967-1969 Lola T70 Mk3 Coupé|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/4977.html|work=Supercars.net|publisher=Supercars.net Publishing|accessdate=4 October 2011[/tpl] sports car. He also assisted with designs for IndyCar chassis,[tpl]cite book|last=Wagstaff|first=Ian|title=The British at Indianapolis|year=2010|publisher=Veloce Publishing|location=Dorchester, England|isbn=978-1-84584-246-8|pages=92–95[/tpl] one of which evolved into the Honda RA300 Hondola Formula One race-winner.
It was his experience with single-seater and IndyCar designs which prompted Dan Gurney to hire Southgate for his All American Racers team, based in California, to design some of the second generation of Gurney-Eagle USAC racers. The highlight of Southgate's time with AAR was when Bobby Unser won the 1968 Indianapolis 500 race in one of Southgate's Eagle cars. The Southgate-designed Eagle Formula 5000 car also found some success.[tpl]cite web|last=Brown|first=Allen|title=Eagle 68/69 'Mk 5'|url=http://www.oldracingcars.com/eagle/68-69/|work=oldracingcars.com|publisher=Allen Brown|accessdate=4 October 2011[/tpl]

==Promotion with BRM==

In 1969 Tony Southgate moved back to the UK and took a job as Chief Designer for the BRM Formula One team. Southgate's first BRM car, the BRM P153,[tpl]cite web|last=Jiggle|first=Mike|title=Interview:Tony Southgate, the BRM years|url=http://www.vintageracecar.com/pages/thismonth.cgi?magid=66&magiid=253|work=Vintage Racecar Journal, July 2011|publisher=Parabolica Publishing LLC|accessdate=29 September 2011[/tpl] appeared in time for the first race of the [tpl]F1|1970[/tpl] season in South Africa. BRM enjoyed a renaissance with the P153 and its successor the BRM P160. The P160, in particular, was highly competitive during the [tpl]F1|1971[/tpl] season; drivers Pedro Rodríguez and Jo Siffert often ran near the front of the field, only for poor reliability to let them down before the finish. Continued development work reaped vast improvements. In the latter half of the season Siffert and Peter Gethin (who had replaced Rodríguez following the latter's death) won back-to-back victories in the Austrian and Italian Grands Prix. Gethin's victory at Monza was taken at an average speed of over 150 mph (240 kph) and stood as the fastest ever Grand Prix win for over 30 years.
Although the BRM team finished second in the Constructors' Championship standings the end of the season, the achievement was marred by Siffert's death in a non-Championship race at Brands Hatch. Unfortunately for BRM and Tony Southgate his [tpl]F1|1972[/tpl] design, the BRM P180, was not as competitive as the previous model. Siffert's replacement Jean-Pierre Beltoise managed to win a rain-hit Monaco Grand Prix in the older P160, and with it take BRM's final Formula One victory. During the 1972 season BRM and Tony Southgate parted company. BRM finished the season in seventh place.

==CanAm and Formula One with Shadow==

At the end of 1972 Shadow Racing Cars founder Don Nichols approached Southgate to design a Formula One car for his team to enter in the 1973 World Championship. Shadow had already been involved in the CanAm sportscar series for nearly two years, and with UOP sponsorship Nichols was planning an entrance into Formula One. Southgate designed and built the first Shadow Formula One prototype, the Shadow DN1, in his own garage in Lincolnshire,[tpl]cite web|title=People: Tony Southgate|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/cref-souton.html|work=GP Encyclopedia|publisher=Inside F1, Inc.|accessdate=29 September 2011[/tpl] where he had moved to be closer to the BRM factory in Bourne. However, production was soon shifted to the USA, to where Southgate once again relocated.
Drivers George Follmer and Jackie Oliver were immediately competitive in the DN1. In 1974 the Southgate-designed Shadow DN4 earned first and second in the CanAm championship. In the same year Peter Revson died whilst testing the Shadow DN3 at Kyalami.
Tony Southgate designed the Shadow DN5 for the 1975 Formula One season. The car proved very fast, with Jean-Pierre Jarier and Tom Pryce both winning pole positions during the year, however it had poor reliability, often retiring when in a points scoring position.

==Lotus==

At the end of 1975 the withdrawal of Shadow's main sponsor UOP prompted Southgate to move to Lotus, where he worked alongside Peter Wright on the Lotus 77 and Lotus 78 until the middle of 1977.

==Arrows==

After Lotus Southgate returned to Shadow, but left the team again at the end of 1977 together with Franco Ambrosio, Alan Rees, Jackie Oliver and Dave Wass to form Arrows.
Arrows' first car, the FA1, was almost identical to the Shadow DN9, which Southgate had designed while at Shadow. The FA1 was comfortably leading its second race, the South African Grand Prix, at the hands of Riccardo Patrese, when its engine blew, forcing it to retire. The Shadow team successfully sued Arrows for infringement of its copyrights and the Arrows FA1 was declared illegal in a UK court judgement on 31 July.[tpl]cite web|title=Nichols Advanced Vehicle Systems Inc & Ors v Rees, Oliver & Ors|url=http://www.5rb.com/casereports/caseProfile.asp?case=Nichols-Advanced-Vehicle-Systems-Inc--Ors-v-Rees,-Oliver--Ors|work=5rb Case Reports|accessdate=16 February 2012[/tpl] Southgate had anticipated this and had completed an alternative design dubbed Arrows A1 which was swiftly produced without Arrows missing a race.
Southgate also designed the Arrows A2 and A3, before leaving the team to work as a freelance engineering consultant.

==Theodore and Osella==

Southgate returned to Formula 1 towards the end of 1980 to design Theodore Racing's TY01 to race in the 1981 season.
In 1983 Southgate designed his last Formula 1 car, the Osella FA1E. The design was severely constrained  as Osella Squadra Corse did not have sufficient finances to build an entirely new chassis, forcing Southgate to adapt a three year old design to fit an engine from Alfa Romeo. The Osella FA1E only finished three races and was described by fellow designer Gustav Brunner as the year's worst car.Motorsport aktuell, Issue 29/1984
When Theodore was merged into Ensign at the end of 1982,  Southgate and John Thompson founded a design consultancy named Auto Racing Technology, that worked for Ford on two major projects, including development of the Ford RS200.[tpl]cite web|last=Morris|first=Gareth|title=RS200 History|url=http://www.preromanbritain.com/gwem/martbean/rs200/history.htm|work=The Gareth Morris Web Experience|accessdate=2 October 2011[/tpl]

==Sports cars==

In 1984 Southgate moved to Tom Walkinshaw Racing, where he headed the design of the Jaguar XJR-9[tpl]cite web|title=1988 Jaguar XJR-9LM|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/891.html|work=1988 Jaguar XJR-9LM|publisher=Supercars.net Publishing|accessdate=2 October 2011[/tpl]  and XJR-12. These won the World Sportscar Championship three times and the Le Mans 24 hour race twice. The XJR-9 also raced in the North America in the IMSA GT Championship. It won on its debut at the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1988, and in the final race of the season at Del Mar.[tpl]cite web|last=Cracknell|first=Malcolm|title=History – XJR-12 Chassis 1090|url=http://archive.dailysportscar.com/free/tour/history.htm|work=dailysportscar archive tour|publisher=dailysportscar.com|accessdate=3 October 2011[/tpl]
He remained at TWR until 1991. Southgate subsequently worked on sports cars for Toyota (Toyota TS010),[tpl]cite web|last=Melissen|first=Wouter|title=Toyota TS010|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/3792/Toyota-TS010.html|work=Ultimatecarpage.com|publisher=Ultimatecarpage.com|accessdate=2 October 2011[/tpl] Ferrari (Ferrari 333 SP),[tpl]cite web|title=Ferrari 333 SP|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/ferrari-333-sp.htm|work=HowStuffWorks|publisher=HowStuffWorks Inc|accessdate=30 September 2011[/tpl] Lister, Nissan (Nissan R390 GT1)[tpl]cite web|first=Zaheer|title=Nissan R390 GT1|url=http://www.japaneserides.com/nissan-r390-gt1|work=Japanese Rides|publisher=japaneserides.com|accessdate=3 October 2011[/tpl] and Audi (Audi R8R and R8C).
