[[Timeline of PlayStation 3 SKUs]]

CATEGORIES: PlayStation 3

The PlayStation 3 was originally launched in Japan on November 11, 2006 and in North America on November 17, 2006 with two SKUs: a 20 GB version and a 60 GB version. Both of these models included hardware backwards compatibility for PlayStation 2 games. In January 2007, Sony announced that Europe's 60 GB version would exclude hardware backwards compatibility for PS2 titles and instead would provide compatibility through software emulation of the PS2's hardware. During the course of 2007, Sony announced several new PlayStation 3 SKUs and discontinued others. The new 40 GB, 80 GB and 160 GB PlayStation 3 models do not feature software emulation of PlayStation 2 hardware.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.playstation.com/help-support/ps3/games/detail/item82567/Playable-Software-for-PLAYSTATION-3|title=Playable Software for PLAYSTATION 3[/tpl] In August 2009, all previous models were discontinued, as the new PS3 Slims were released, in 120GB and 250GB editions, priced at $299 and $349, respectively. One year later, in August 2010, the 120GB version went out of production, to be replaced by a 160GB counterpart, which was also priced at $299.
