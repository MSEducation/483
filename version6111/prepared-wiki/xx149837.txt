Airing each weekday from 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. Eastern, Morning Express with Robin Meade on HLN features an ensemble that includes anchor Robin Meade, meteorologist Bob Van Dillen & money correspondent Jennifer Westhoven. "Morning Express" gives you your daily dose of news, weather, sports, entertainment, finance and travel. The group of anchors appear friendly, at an upbeat pace, described by Stephen King as "his morning people" in his Entertainment Weekly column. The show is reportedly popular among young males 18-34 unlike most news programming which tend to have an older and more female viewership.  
Between October 2008 and April 2009, the show was accompanied by the "Morning Express Challenge" Trivia game.

Robin and the other correspondents often took part in the chat room and mentioned game players on the air.

==Robin and Company era==

From 1982 to 2005, HLN (then known as CNN Headline News) did not have a predominant morning program, but the network decided in 2005 to build a program around Robin Meade based on her growing ratings and popularity among viewers. The program was originally called Robin & Company.
Effective November 5, 2007, the program was renamed to Morning Express with Robin Meade.  The renamed program bills itself as the "fastest morning news show on television".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnn/headline_news_morning_show_name_game_69546.asp |title=TVNewser |publisher=mediabistro.com |date=2007-10-22 |accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl]
