Babell is a hamlet in Flintshire, Wales. It is part of the community of Ysgeifiog.
The hamlet takes its name from the Babell Methodist chapel, built in 1836, but the surrounding area was formerly known as Gelliloveday or Gellilyfdy (a township of Ysgeifiog parish). The name Gellilyfdy was recorded in the Domesday book, and possibly means "wych elm wood" (from Welsh gelli, "wood", and llwyv, llwyfanen, "wych elm").John Gwenogryn Evans, Facsimile & text of the Book of Taliesin, v1, 1910, xxiii
