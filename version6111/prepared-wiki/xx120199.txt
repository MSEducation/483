The Morrow Plots is an experimental corn field at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  It is the oldest such field in the United StatesHistorical markers on the site and the second oldest in the world. It was established in 1876 as the first experimental corn field at an American college and continues to be used today, although with three plots instead of the original ten.Illinois Farm Bureau "An Urbana Legend" Partners magazine (Spring 2009) 
The results of the experiments which were carried out at the Morrow Plots showed that "soil quality is a vital component of agricultural productivity", and that the "use of science and technology ... increased crop productivity over four-fold."
The site was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 23, 1968.National Park Service, National Historic Landmark Program. Morrow Plots, University of Illinois. May 1, 2007.
It is popularly believed that the University constructed its Undergraduate Library to the west of the Plots with three stories underground, so that the library would not block the sun from the Morrow Plots. However, the University master plan at the time called for a large open plaza on that end of campus, which was an equally important reason the library was built underground."Morrow Plots" at UIHistories Project.
