[[Fraction of inspired oxygen]]

CATEGORIES: Pulmonology, Mechanical ventilation

Fraction of inspired oxygen (''Fi''O2) is the fraction or percentage of oxygen in the space being measured. Medical patients experiencing difficulty breathing are provided with oxygen-enriched air, which means a higher-than-atmospheric FiO2. Natural air includes 20.9% oxygen, which is equivalent to FiO2 of 0.21. Oxygen-enriched air has a higher FiO2 than 0.21, up to 1.00, which means 100% oxygen.http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070307165629AAxDALx FiO2 is typically maintained below 0.5 even with mechanical ventilation, to avoid oxygen toxicity.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2688103/
Often used in medicine the FiO2 is used to represent the percentage of oxygen participating in gas-exchange.  If the barometric pressure changes, the FiO2 may remain constant while the partial pressure of oxygen changes with the change in barometric pressure.

==Equations==

PAO2, PEO2, and PiO2 are the partial pressures of oxygen in alveolar, expired, and inspired gas, respectively, and VD/VT is the ratio of physiologic dead space over tidal volume.

==Medicine==

In medicine the FiO2 is the assumed percentage of oxygen concentration participating in gas exchange in the alveoli.[tpl]cite journal| author=Allardet-Servent J, Forel JM, Roch A, Guervilly C, Chiche L, Castanier M et al.| title=FIO2 and acute respiratory distress syndrome definition during lung protective ventilation. | journal=Crit Care Med | year= 2009 | volume= 37 | issue= 1 | pages= 202–7, e4-6 | pmid=19050631 | doi=10.1097/CCM.0b013e31819261db | pmc= | url= [/tpl]

==Uses==

The ratio between partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) and FiO2 is used as an indicator of hypoxemia per the American-European Consensus Conference on lung injury.  A high FiO2 has been shown to alter the ratio of PaO2/FiO2.

==PaO2/FiO2 ratio==

The ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen, sometimes called the Carrico index, is a comparison between the oxygen level in the blood and the oxygen concentration that is breathed.  This helps to determine the degree of any problems with how the lungs transfer oxygen to the blood.[tpl]cite journal| author=Toy P, Popovsky MA, Abraham E, Ambruso DR, Holness LG, Kopko PM et al.| title=Transfusion-related acute lung injury: definition and review. | journal=Crit Care Med | year= 2005 | volume= 33 | issue= 4 | pages= 721–6 | pmid=15818095 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=15818095  [/tpl] A sample of arterial blood is collected for this test.Tietz NW (Ed): Clinical Guide to Laboratory Tests, 3rd ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA, 1995. A PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than or equal to 200 mmHg is necessary for the diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome by the AECC criteria. Mason, R. Murray and Nadel's Textbook of Respiratory Medicine, 5th ed. Philadelphia, PA 2010 The more recent Berlin criteria defines mild ARDS at a ratio of A PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than or equal to 250 mmHg is one of the minor criteria for severe community acquired pneumonia (i.e., possible indication for inpatient treatment).
A PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than or equal to 333 mmHg is one of the variables in the SMART-COP risk score for intensive respiratory or vasopressor support in community-acquired pneumonia.
