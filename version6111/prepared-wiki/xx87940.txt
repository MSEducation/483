[[Affirming a disjunct]]

CATEGORIES: Propositional fallacies, Syllogistic fallacies

The formal fallacy of affirming a disjunct also known as the fallacy of the alternative disjunct or a false exclusionary disjunct occurs when a deductive argument takes the following logical form:
Or in logical operators:

==Explanation==

The fallacy lies in concluding that one disjunct must be false because the other disjunct is true; in fact they may both be true because "or" is defined inclusively rather than exclusively. It is a fallacy of equivocation between the operations OR and XOR.
Affirming the disjunct should not be confused with the valid argument known as the disjunctive syllogism.

==Example==

The following argument indicates the invalidity of affirming a disjunct:
This inference is invalid. If Max is a cat then Max is also a mammal. (Remember "or" is defined in an inclusive sense not an exclusive sense.)
The above example of an argument also demonstrates the fallacy.
