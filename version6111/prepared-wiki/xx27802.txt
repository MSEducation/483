</ref> According to the then Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], Robson "epitomised everything that is great about football in this country."<ref name=Tributes/> His friend, the broadcaster [[Michael Parkinson]], said: "Robson will be remembered long after the present lot are old bones. By his decency, his humour, his love of the game's traditions and origins and confusion at what it had become, he made present day football look what it is â€“ shabby by comparison. I can think of no more fitting epitaph."<ref>[tpl]cite book | url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FBwONvAToksC&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&dq=shabby+by+comparison.+I+can+think+of+no+more+fitting+epitaph&source=bl&ots=Bezs8Sod8C&sig=bvtm0sikJ9AImtv8zarl_g7odUo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QfIPUevZHuyZ0QWXxICIBg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=shabby%20by%20comparison.%20I%20can%20think%20of%20no%20more%20fitting%20epitaph&f=false | title = FC Barcelona-Barca: Futbol Club Barcelona.
