Teemu Ilmari Selänne ([tpl]IPA-fi|ˈteːmu ˈilmɑri ˈselænːe[/tpl]) nicknamed "The Finnish Flash" (born July 3, 1970) is a Finnish professional ice hockey winger for the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He formerly played with Jokerit of the SM-liiga and began his NHL career with the Winnipeg Jets who selected him in the first round, 10th overall, at the 1988 NHL Entry Draft. Selänne has also played for the San Jose Sharks and Colorado Avalanche during a professional career that has spanned 25 years.
After leading the SM-liiga in scoring in 1991–92, Selänne broke into the NHL by scoring 76 goals in 1992–93. It remains the league record for most goals by a rookie and earned him the Calder Memorial Trophy as the top first-year player in the NHL. He has scored 50 goals in a season three times and topped 100 points on four occasions. Selänne is one of the highest scoring players in NHL history with nearly 700 goals and over 1,400 points during his career.  He has played in 10 NHL All-Star Games, has been named to four post-season All-Star Teams and won the inaugural Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy in 1998–99 as the league's leading goal scorer.  He won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy in 2005–06 for perseverance and dedication to the game and was a member of the Ducks' 2007 Stanley Cup championship team.
Internationally, Selänne has been a long-time member of the Finnish National Team. He has played in five World Championships, winning a silver and bronze medal, and in three Canada Cup/World Cup of Hockey tournaments. Selänne is a six-time Olympian, and helped Finland win three bronze medals and, in 2006, a silver medal.  He is the all-time leader in scoring at the Olympic ice hockey tournament with 43 points in his career. A national star in his native country, Selänne is the subject of a top grossing biographical documentary in Finland.

==Early life==

Selänne was born on July 3, 1970, in Helsinki, Finland.[tpl]cite book |last=Podnieks |first=Andrew |title=Players: The ultimate A–Z guide of everyone who has ever played in the NHL |publisher=Doubleday Canada |year=2003 |location=Toronto |pages=774–775 |isbn=0-385-25999-9[/tpl] He has a twin brother, Paavo and another brother, Panu.[tpl]cite book |editor-last=Hoem |editor-first=Steve |title=2012–13 Anaheim Ducks Media Guide |publisher=Anaheim Ducks Hockey Club |year=2012 |pages=86–89[/tpl] He was raised by his mother Liisa Viitanen and step-father Ilmari Selänne until they divorced in the late 1980s; his biological father is unknown. The family lived for a time in Rauma before settling in Espoo around the time Teemu was 10 years old.
He played three sports as a youth: hockey, bandy and association football. Teemu played hockey and football with and against Paavo, though his brother ultimately gave up on both sports in favour of field hockey, where he was a member of numerous Finnish and European championship teams.[tpl]cite web |last=Amber |first=David |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=amber_david&id=2631420 |title=Selanne teaches us a lesson |publisher=ESPN |date=2006-10-25 |accessdate=2013-08-31[/tpl] Teemu was small as a youth, creating in him a competitive spirit and drive to improve his skills.  Focusing on hockey, he eventually joined the junior squad of Jokerit in Helsinki.
As a young adult, Selänne attended business school for two years and served a mandatory one-year stint with the Finnish Defence Forces.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/events/1998/nagano/athletes/118.htm |title=Athlete profile: Teemu Selänne |publisher=CNN/Sports Illustrated |date=1998-02-03 |accessdate=2013-08-31[/tpl] During his tenure with Jokerit, he also spent three years as a kindergarten teacher. His experiences visiting kids at Helsinki's children's hospital led to him co-founding the Godfather's Foundation, an organization that raises money for sick kids.[tpl]cite journal |last=Howard |first=Johnette |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1142705/1/index.htm |title=Top Dog |work=Sports Illustrated |date=1997-01-27 |accessdate=2013-08-31[/tpl]

==Playing career==

===Jokerit===

Selänne played three years of junior hockey in Jokerit's development program, culminating in 1987–88 with a 43 goal, 66 point season in 33 games and a Finnish Junior A championship.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eliteprospects.com/player.php?player=2683 |title=Teemu Selanne player card |publisher=Elite Hockey Prospects |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl] His performance prompted the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Winnipeg Jets to select him with their first round pick, 10th overall, at the 1988 NHL Entry Draft.[tpl]cite web |last=Kimelman |first=Adam |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=674365 |title=Best pick at No. 10: Teemu Selanne, Jets |publisher=National Hockey League |date=2013-06-21 |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl] Selänne attended training camp with the Jets, but returned to Finland owing to his military service.[tpl]cite book |last=Brophy |first=Mike |title=My First Goal: 50 players and the goal that marked the beginning of their NHL careers |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |year=2011 |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-7710-1682-0 |pages=247–250[/tpl]
After graduating from junior hockey, Selänne joined Jokerit's senior team in the 1. Divisioona in 1988–89 and scored 69 points in 35 games. Jokerit moved up to the SM-liiga in 1989–90, and while Selänne missed the majority of the season due to a leg injury, he scored 12 points in 11 games played.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/players/s/selante01.html |title=Teemu Selanne statistics |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl] Playing a full season in 1990–91, Selänne scored 33 goals and 58 points in 42 games.

===Winnipeg Jets===

The Jets' organizational philosophy at the time was to allow their European draft picks to develop in their native countries, but by 1991, the franchise was working to bring him to Winnipeg.[tpl]cite web |last=Pinchevsky |first=Tal |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=658119 |title=Selanne arrived with flashy 76-goal rookie season |publisher=National Hockey League |date=2013-03-02 |accessdate=2013-09-03[/tpl] As Selänne had not yet signed a contract when he chose to play in North America for the 1992–93 NHL season, he was considered a restricted free agent.[tpl]cite news |last=Sell |first=Dave |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-936476.html |title=Selanne's a shoo-in for Calder Trophy |work=The Washington Post |date=1993-03-11 |accessdate=2013-09-03[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] The Calgary Flames signed him to an offer sheet on a three-year contract worth $2.7 million – $1.5 million above what the Jets had been offering. Though concerned about paying such a high salary, Winnipeg exercised its right to match the offer. Selänne made his NHL debut on October 6, 1992, and recorded two assists in a 4–1 Jets victory over the Detroit Red Wings.  He scored his first NHL goal two nights later against goaltender Jeff Hackett of the San Jose Sharks.
Selänne scored his first career hat trick in his fifth contest and had 11 goals in his first 12 NHL games. He finished the season with 16 multi-goal games, including four hat tricks and a four-goal game, en route to breaking the NHL record for goals by a rookie. He surpassed Mike Bossy's record of 53 goals on March 2, 1993, against the Quebec Nordiques and on March 23, scored his 110th point, against the Toronto Maple Leafs, to break Peter Stastny's rookie points record. Selänne finished the season tied for fifth in scoring with 132 points, and his 76 goals tied with Alexander Mogilny for the league lead.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1993.html |title=1992-93 NHL Season Summary |publisher=Sports Reference LLC. |accessdate=2013-09-05[/tpl] His offensive exploits helped pull the Jets into the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs, where they lost a first-round matchup to the Vancouver Canucks. In recognition of his season, Selänne was voted the recipient of the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year, was named to the First All-Star Team and played in his first of ten career NHL All-Star Games.
Unable to maintain a similar pace in 1993–94, Selänne's offensive production declined by 30 percent midway through the season.[tpl]cite news |last=Dupont |first=Kevin Paul |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8260890.html |title=Pronounced effect on Jets No matter how you say his name, Teemu Selanne has shown he can have a... |work=Boston Globe |date=1994-01-05 |accessdate=2013-09-05[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] He scored his 100th career goal on January 12, 1994, against the Buffalo Sabres.  He reached the milestone in his 130th game, the second fastest in NHL history and only one game later than Bossy. Selänne finished the season with 54 points in 51 games, but missed the final 33 games of the season after suffering a severed Achilles tendon in a January 26 game against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The 1994–95 NHL lockout resulted in Selänne splitting the season between Jokerit and the Jets. While playing in Finland, Selänne was named to the tournament all-star team as Jokerit won the 1995 European Cup.
Selänne's career in Winnipeg came to an end midway through the 1995–96 season.  He was leading the Jets with 72 points when, on February 6, 1996, he was traded to Anaheim.  The Mighty Ducks sent first-round draft picks Chad Kilger and Oleg Tverdovsky, along with a third round selection at the 1996 NHL Entry Draft, in exchange for Selänne, Marc Chouinard and a fourth round draft pick.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-22822637.html |title=Ducks acquire Selänne from Jets |work=The Buffalo News |date=1996-02-07 |accessdate=2013-09-05[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] Selänne was upset when notified of the deal during practice and left the Winnipeg Arena without speaking to anyone.[tpl]cite news |last=Crouse |first=Karen |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83904031.html |title=All-Star Selänne traded to Ducks |work=Daily News |location=Los Angeles, CA |date=1996-02-08 |accessdate=2013-09-09[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl]

===Anaheim, San Jose, and Colorado===

Following a period of adjustment, Selänne gained an appreciation for his new team; he quickly came to call the deal the best thing that ever happened to him.[tpl]cite news |last=Gordon |first=Jeff |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL |title=Team Teemu: Ducks soaring after getting Selänne |work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |date=1996-03-27 |accessdate=2013-09-09[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Newsbank[/tpl] He was paired with Paul Kariya, whom he met at the 1996 NHL All-Star Game, and the duo were counted on to lead the young franchise to a post-season berth for the first time. Selänne scored 36 points in 28 games with the Ducks, and combined with his Jets totals, finished the 1995–96 season with 108 points.  He followed it up with a third 100-point season in 1996–97, finishing with 109, including 51 goals. He was named to the First All-Star Team for a second time, while he and Kariya led the Mighty Ducks into the franchise's first playoff appearance in 1997.[tpl]cite news |last=Modesti |first=Kevin |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83864479.html |title=Kariya flies through test |work=Daily News |location=Los Angeles, CA |date=1997-04-17 |accessdate=2013-09-09[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] Despite being criticized as being a "one-line team", Anaheim defeated the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round before being eliminated by the Detroit Red Wings.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83865990.html |title=From the field: Kariya, Selänne will need help |work=Daily News |location=Los Angeles, CA |date=1997-05-02 |accessdate=2013-09-09[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl][tpl]cite book |editor-last=Hoem |editor-first=Steve |title=2012–13 Anaheim Ducks Media Guide |publisher=Anaheim Ducks Hockey Club |year=2012 |page=287[/tpl]
The 1997 All-Star Game was his fifth, and after scoring a hat trick, Selänne became the first European player to be named most valuable player in the game's 46-year history.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83808362.html |title=Selanne provides world stars wonderful Finnish: N. America 8, World 7 |work=Daily News |location=Los Angeles, CA |date=1998-01-19 |accessdate=2013-09-09[/tpl][tpl]subscription|via=Highbeam[/tpl] He finished the 1997–98 season with his third career 50-goal season; his total of 52 tied Peter Bondra for the league lead, and he scored his 500th career point on January 12, 1998, with an assist against the Los Angeles Kings. He was a finalist for both the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player (finishing third) and the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for gentlemanly conduct (as the runner-up), and was named to the Second All-Star Team. The NHL created the Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy in 1998–99 to be presented to the league's leading goal scorer. Selänne became its inaugural winner following a 47-goal season.
An 85-point season followed in 1999–2000, and he was the Mighty Ducks' leading scorer with 59 points through 61 games in 2000–01.  However, Anaheim sat in last place in the Western Conference, and on March 5, 2001, chose to make a trade. Selänne was sent to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Jeff Friesen, Steve Shields, and a second-round selection in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-42529473.html |title=San Jose acquires scorer Selänne |publisher=Associated Press |date=2001-03-05 |accessdate=2013-09-09[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] Selänne's debut with the Sharks was delayed by two weeks as he underwent minor surgery to remove loose cartilage in his knee the following day.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4588449.html |title=Selänne needs surgery |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=2001-03-07 |accessdate=2013-10-24[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] After finishing the season with 13 points in 12 games with San Jose, Selänne led the Sharks with 29 goals in 2001–02. He also led the team in both goals (28; tied) and points (64) in 2002–03. As the Sharks fell out of the playoff race, they looked to make changes; the New Jersey Devils sought to acquire Selänne,[tpl]cite news |last=Gulitti |first=Tom |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-72434947.html |title=If Lamoriello can pull it off, Selänne would be perfect fit |work=The Record |location=Bergen County, NJ |date=2003-03-09 |accessdate=2013-10-24[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] but he exercised a no trade clause in his contract and blocked the deal.[tpl]cite news |last=Gulitti |first=Tom |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-73176744.html |title=Devils take offense to the questions |work=The Record |location=Bergen County, NJ |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2013-10-24[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl]
Selänne then declined an option in his contract that would have paid $6.5 million in 2003–04 and instead opted to sign a one-year, $5.8 million contract with the Colorado Avalanche, where he was joined by former Anaheim teammate Paul Kariya.  The pair chose to sign with the Avalanche together in the belief it was their best chance at winning the Stanley Cup.[tpl]cite news |last=Mossman |first=Jeff |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-75066388.html |title=Avalanche sign both Kariya and Selanne |publisher=Associated Press |date=2003-07-04 |accessdate=2013-10-24[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] Their hope failed to materialize, as Selänne endured a disastrous season in which he scored only 16 goals and 32 points – the lowest totals of his career to that date – and was ultimately relegated to Colorado's fourth line, but was also held out of the lineup as a healthy scratch during a playoff game.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-93802261.html |title=Colorado scratches healthy Selanne for playoff game |publisher=Associated Press |date=2004-04-24 |accessdate=2013-10-24[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] He struggled throughout the year with knee problems that ultimately required surgery, his third such procedure, and with the 2004–05 season canceled by a labour dispute, took the time off to recover.[tpl]cite news |last=Perez |first=A.

===Return to Anaheim===

A free agent when the NHL resumed play in 2005–06, Selänne returned to Anaheim by signing a one-year, $1 million contract with the Mighty Ducks. During a resurgent season, he scored his 1,000th career point on January 30, 2006, with a goal in a 4–3 victory over the Los Angeles Kings.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-117992307.html |title=Selanne resurgence nets him 1,000th point |publisher=Associated Press |date=2006-02-01 |accessdate=2013-10-27[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] Selänne completed the season with 40 goals and 90 points, both of which led the Mighty Ducks, and he was named the recipient of the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for dedication and perseverance.
After reaching the Western Conference final in the 2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the newly renamed Anaheim Ducks entered the 2006–07 season with high expectations; the team brought Selänne back with a one-year, $3.75 million contract.[tpl]cite news |last=Stephens |first=Eric |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/14/sports/sp-ducks14 |title=Selanne Re-Signs With Ducks for $3.75 Million |work=Los Angeles Times |date=2006-06-14 |accessdate=2013-10-27[/tpl] He reached several milestones during the season: Selänne became the 36th player in NHL history, and second Finn after Jari Kurri, to score 500 goals, on November 22, 2006, against the Colorado Avalanche.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1166972541.html |title=Teemu pots 500th goal |work=Winnipeg Free Press |date=2006-11-23 |accessdate=2013-10-27[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] On December 31, he played his 1,000th NHL game.[tpl]cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=261231030 |title=Ducks' Pronger breaks foot; Parrish's goal lifts Wild |publisher=ESPN |date=2006-12-31 |accessdate=2013-10-27[/tpl] As part of a season in which he again led Anaheim in goals (48) and points (94), Selänne played in his 10th All-Star Game in 2007, and scored his first hat trick in six years (the 19th of his career) on January 12, 2007. It was the same day he spoke with a friend in Finland with terminal cancer and whom asked to be sent the game puck if Selänne had a three-goal game.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/12/AR2007011200724_pf.html |title=Selanne makes hat trick for sick friend |work=Washington Post |date=2007-01-12 |accessdate=2013-10-27[/tpl] Finally, he scored his 301st goal as a Duck on February 18, 2007, to break Paul Kariya's franchise record.
Early in the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Selänne became Anaheim's all-time leading playoff scorer when he recorded his 30th point as a Duck with an assist on April 13 against the Minnesota Wild. The Ducks defeated the Wild, Vancouver Canucks and Detroit Red Wings to reach the 2007 Stanley Cup Final; it was the first time in Selänne's career that he played in the NHL's championship series. As the sentimental favourite to win the Stanley Cup, his teammates motivated themselves to win the title for his benefit: Teammate and goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère noted: "we don't have any better teammate. He's a guy who always has fun. He deserves this and if we can help him along the way, that would be great. I'd just love to see Teemu win this thing."[tpl]cite news |last=Teaford |first=Elliott |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-164284819.html |title=Teemu effort; Ducks want to win NHL title for veteran Selanne |work=Daily news |location=Los Angeles, CA |date=2007-05-28 |accessdate=2013-10-27[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] He finished the playoffs with 15 points in 21 games, and after 14 NHL seasons, the 36-year-old Selänne raised the Stanley Cup with his teammates after defeating the Ottawa Senators in five games.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1Y1-107180276.html |title=Anaheim Ducks win Stanley Cup |publisher=Associated Press |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2013-10-27[/tpl]
