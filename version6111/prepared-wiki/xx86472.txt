==Advertising==

As of 2009, the Monte Carlo print advertising campaign features humorously misspelled French words ("tray sheek") coupled with glamorous images. The campaign's tagline is "Unpretentiously luxurious".[tpl]cite news |title=Monte Carlo Resort Pokes Fun at the Pretentious |author=Lindsay Gordon |magazine=BrandWeek |date=12 June 2009 |url=http://www.brandweek.com/bw/content_display/esearch/e3idff59d66183db868a59ad5444251f02d [/tpl]

==History==

===Construction and opening===

Ground was broken for the hotel in March 1995. It was originally known as the "Grand Victoria". The palatial style was a reminiscent of the Belle Epoque, which is how the French refer to the architecture of the Victorian era in England. After much criticism by MGM Grand officials, it was shortened to "Victoria" and then changed to "Monte Carlo".[tpl]cite web |title=Desert Rose Motel |author= |work=Las Vegas Strip History |date=|url=[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Elegant Resort to Join Others on Strip |author=Michelle Dearmond |work=The Associated Press |date=25 July 1995 |url= [/tpl]
