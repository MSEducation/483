Stanford Talisman is a coed group of singers from Stanford University in California, dedicated to sharing stories through music. Their roots are in music from South Africa and the African diaspora, but they have since broadened their horizons to include music from all over the world. Although an a cappella group, they sometimes incorporate drums and dancing into their music. They can be seen performing throughout the greater San Francisco Bay Area, the United States, and the world. Their most recent tour was to South Africa in the spring of 2013. The group also traveled to New Orleans and Atlanta in 2009 and in 2012.  Founded in October 1989 by Joseph Pigato, the group won the 1997 ICCA competition  and notable performances include the 1996 Olympic Games, the White House, with 10-time Grammy award winner Bobby McFerrin in 2005, and with Seal in 2009.
Their musical repertoire includes "One by One," "Lift E'vry Voice" (the Black national anthem), "Baba Yetu" (featured on the video game Civilization IV), Sweet Honey in the Rock's "Wanting Memories," a powerful Native American chant "Wahjeeleh-Yihm," and the traditional spiritual "Amazing Grace."
Talisman has released eight full-length albums as well as a 10-year anniversary compilation entitled "Shine," and a 20-year compilation, "Twenty."  The group was featured on the 1997 Best of Collegiate A Cappella compilation, and has received recognition from CARA, most recently in 2004, winning "Mixed-Group Album of the Year" for Watch Me Fly.
