==History==

Droog was founded in 1993 by product designer Gijs Bakker and design historian Renny Ramakers. During the Milan Furniture Fair in 1993, the duo presented a selection of sober designs made of industrial materials and found objects. The presentation was titled 'Droog Design', because of the simplicity and dry humor of the objects.http://www.kunstbus.nl/design/droog-design.html 
They continued by putting together design presentations reflecting a clear spirit of the times. In 1996, they extended their sphere of activities by initiating experimental projects. In the following year, Droog received its first commission from a company. In 2003 Droog B.V. was set up alongside the Droog Foundation, for the production and distribution of the Droog product collection. Since the end of 2004, the Droog headquarters has been situated in Amsterdam, combining a store, an exhibition room, a library and a kitchen.
In 1999 an exhibition on Droog was held at Fundación Joan Miró in Barcelona, followed by a retrospective exhibition in 2006/2007 at the Museum of Arts & Design in New York City entitled Simply Droog: 10 + 3 years of creating innovation and discussion. In 2004 a book was published on Droog, entitled Simply Droog: 10 + 1 years of creating innovation and discussion. In 2009, Droog opened a store in New York City's SoHo District.
