Erró (born Guðmundur Guðmundsson in 1932 in Ólafsvík, Iceland) is a postmodern artist. He studied art in Norway and in Italy, and has resided in Paris, Thailand and on the island of Formentera for most of his life. In 1989 he donated a large collection of his works to the Reykjavik Arts Museum, which has put part of it on permanent display and opened a website where the whole collection can be visited.
In 2010 he was accused of plagiarism by Brian Bolland for copying his work uncredited and selling it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2010/05/20/brian-bolland-takes-on-erro-and-wins/ |title=Brian Bolland Takes On Erró...
