Elektron is the registered trademark of a wide range of magnesium alloys manufactured by a British company, Magnesium Elektron Limited.
There are about 100 different alloys in the Elektron range, containing 0% - 9.5% of some of the following elements in varying proportions: aluminium (  |title=Woldman's Engineering Alloys

Varying amounts of alloying elements (up to 9.5%) added to the magnesium result in changes to mechanical properties such as increased tensile strength, creep resistance, thermal stability or corrosion resistance.  Elektron is unusually light and has a specific gravity of about 1.8 compared with the 2.8 of aluminium alloy.[ref]
