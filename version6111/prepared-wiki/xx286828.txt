John William Tristram (7 October 1870 - 19 August 1938) was an Australian watercolour artist. He commonly signed his paintings as J. W. Tristram.

==Biography==

Born at Gillingham, Kent, England, Tristram  was the first of eight children to his parents Samuel Herbert Tristram and Hannah Thompson. His father was a gunnery instructor in the British Army and accepted a posting in Australia which resulted in the family's emigration. John was 13 when they arrived in Sydney on 21 December 1883.
Tristram's artistic abilities were utilised in seeking employment. By April 1885 he had been accepted as a junior draftsman in the Architectâ€™s Branch of the Department of Public Instruction (which became the Department of Education in 1915).[tpl]cite news|title=THE CIVIL SERVICE LIST|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald (Sydney)|date=4 April 1885|page=9[/tpl] He was to remain in this career until he retired around 1930.
On 14 October 1891 he married Maude Face at Woollahra, in Sydney's eastern suburbs. In 1899 John, Maude and their two surviving children moved north of Sydney Harbour to Mosman which, from its earliest days, had strong connections with the creative arts in Sydney. He remained a resident of Mosman until his death in 1938.
During his life Tristram was an active participant on the committees of three art societies: Art Society of New South Wales (which became the Royal Art Society of New South Wales when its Royal charter was granted in 1903),[tpl]cite news|title=DEATH OF SYDNEY ARTIST|newspaper=The Courier-Mail (Brisbane)|date=20 August 1938|page=2[/tpl] Australian Watercolour Institute and Australian Art Society.
