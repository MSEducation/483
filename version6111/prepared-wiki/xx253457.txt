During World War II, Whitehair served in the United States Navy Reserve. In 1943, he became attorney general of American Samoa.
In 1950, President of the United States Harry S. Truman appointed Whitehair as General Counsel of the Economic Stabilization Agency.Francis P. Whitehair Papers at the Harry S. Truman Library & Museum  
The next year, President Truman nominated Whitehair as Under Secretary of the Navy and Whitehair served in that office from August 7, 1951 to January 29, 1953.List of Under Secretaries of the Navy on Navy Website (archived)  Having received the appointment on the recommendation of Truman aide Donald Dawson, Whitehair was seen as a political appointment and was unpopular with the admirals of the United States Navy."Behind the Scenes: The Disappearing Letter," Time, Feb. 2, 1953.  His unpopularity grew when he appointed William E. Willett, another friend of Dawson whose appointment as Director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation had recently been rejected by the United States Senate, to a plum $11,800-a-year job as a "specialist".  He was also criticized for spending more time positioning himself for another campaign to become Governor of Florida than with discharging his duties as Under Secretary.  It was reported that United States Secretary of the Navy Dan A. Kimball wanted to resign in 1952, but did not do so because he was afraid that Truman would elevate Whitehair to Secretary of the Navy.
Upon the election of Dwight D. Eisenhower as president, United States Secretary of Defense Robert A. Lovett decided that the Truman appointee who should remain in office until the new Secretary of the Navy, Robert B. Anderson, could learn the job was Assistant Secretary of the Navy (AIR) John F. Floberg.  However, Whitehair initially refused to offer his letter of resignation, doing so only when ordered to do so by Secretary Kimball.  However, this letter appeared to get lost in the mail, and, with Kimball's resignation having been accepted effective January 20, 1953, Whitehair briefly became Acting Secretary of the Navy.
Shortly after undergoing lung surgery, Whitehair died of heart failure on March 20, 1977 at the Emory University Medical Center in Atlanta.  He was 76 years old.
