"The People" is a song by American rapper Common, released as the lead single of his seventh studio album Finding Forever. It made its first appearance on Kanye West's Can't Tell Me Nothing mixtape. The song features production by West and contains background vocals provided by soul singer Dwele. The original version of the song had Common singing the hook by himself, but this was later replaced with Dwele singing the hook. It contains samples of "We Almost Lost Detroit" by Gil Scott-Heron as well as vocal samples of "Long Red" by Mountain (the latter of which was sampled on Wouldn't Get Far featuring West). This action was part of West's intention to pay tribute to J Dilla through the production style expressed within the album.[tpl]cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.thefader.com/blog/articles/2007/04/26/track-by-track-commons-finding-forever | title =  Track by Track: Common's Finding Forever from Fader Magazine | format =  | work = | publisher = | accessdate = June 11, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Rodriguez | first = Jayson | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1556781/20070410/common.jhtml | title = Kanye West, Lily Allen Finding Something In Common | work =MTV | publisher =MTV Networks |date=2007-04-11 | accessdate = June 13, 2007[/tpl]
