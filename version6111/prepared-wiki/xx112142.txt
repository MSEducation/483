Foreign Objects is an American experimental metal band that formed in West Chester, Pennsylvania in 1994 and was active until 1996. Its members were Deron Miller and Jess Margera, best known as members of the band CKY. The band released two EPs, The Undiscovered Numbers & Colors during the two years they were active, and one compilation, Universal Culture Shock/Undiscovered Numbers & Colors, which included an album of previously unreleased material, was later released in 2003. Deron reactivated the project with promise of a new album in 2014.
==History== 
The band's roots can be traced back to 1992, when vocalist and guitarist Deron Miller and drummer Jess Margera met at West Chester East High School in their hometown of West Chester, Pennsylvania.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ckyalliance.com/band/index.cfm |title=CKY - Then and Now |publisher=CKY |accessdate=April 5, 2010 [/tpl] The two became friends and began performing music together soon after, forming their band, Foreign Objects. They roughly recorded an EP titled My Favorite Cat, but only gave the tape to close friends. In 1995, the following year, the band released the EP, The Undiscovered Numbers & Colors.
The band was working on a follow-up album to The Undiscovered Numbers & Colors called Universal Culture Shock, but Foreign Objects was put aside in 1996, when they changed their musical approach and renamed themselves Oil, the band that would later become CKY, and the album was not finished.[tpl]cite web |url=http://inhifi.com/wiki/index.php/Universal_Culture_Shock/Undiscovered_Numbers_%26_Colors |title=CKY: In Hi-Fi - Universal Culture Shock/Undiscovered Numbers & Colors |publisher=CKY: In Hi-Fi |accessdate=April 9, 2010 [/tpl] Although this was effectively the end of the band, recordings under the name Foreign Objects have continued in years since.
Two of the five tracks that comprised Oil's first EP, Lifeline, were Foreign Objects songs from the unreleased Universal Culture Shock album.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.inhifi.com/wiki/index.php/Lifeline_EP |title=CKY: In Hi-Fi - Lifeline EP |publisher=CKY: In Hi-Fi |accessdate=January 2, 2011 [/tpl] These two songs, "Planetary" and "Genesis 12a", have also appeared on various releases of the CKY compilation, Volume 2, first released in 1999.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.inhifi.com/wiki/index.php/Volume_2 |title=CKY: In Hi-Fi - Volume 2 |publisher=CKY: In Hi-Fi |accessdate=January 2, 2011 [/tpl]
Additionally, in 2003, although Foreign Objects had since evolved into the band CKY, Deron and Jess began re-recording the songs from their unreleased album, Universal Culture Shock, with help from guest guitarist James Murphy. The album was released on October 31, 2004 as the first disc in a two-disc set called Universal Culture Shock/Undiscovered Numbers & Colors. The second disc was a remastered version of their original EP, The Undiscovered Numbers & Colors.
"Test it Out", one of the songs from the Universal Culture Shock album, was released as a single on April 17, 2009.
Universal Culture Shock and The Undiscovered Numbers & Colors were also re-released on November 1, 2009 on the Distant Recordings compilation 15 years as a single disc through the website CD Baby, with support from the band. The package also featured two other discs: a reissue of the rare EP by CKY, Disengage the Simulator, and a reissue of the album Reverb on the Click by Rudy + Blitz, a band that included member Chad I Ginsburg, who would later join the band CKY.
On July 16, 2013, World of Rock Records announced a limited edition "Test It Out" 7-inch vinyl single, with a newly recorded acoustic rendition of "Victory Over Neptune" serving as the B-side. It was released November 15, 2013.http://worldofrockrecords.tumblr.com/post/55621362050/foreign-objects-pre-cky-test-it-out-vinyl
On March 7, 2014, it was reviled by Miller that a new Foreign Objects album entitled "Galactic Prey" was currently in development.  On March 26 2014, the first single "Galactic Prey" was released by Miller on Sound Cloud.
