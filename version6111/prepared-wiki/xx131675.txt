Gabriel Enrique Gómez Girón (born 29 May 1984 in Panama City) is a Panamanian footballer who plays for Junior de Barranquilla in Colombia, as a defensive midfielder.

==Club career==

In his early career, Gómez – nicknamed Gavilán – rarely settled with a club, playing in both his country and Colombia. In 2007 he moved to Portugal and signed a three-year contract with C.F. Os Belenenses, who paid €300.000 to Independiente de Santa Fe.
Gómez made his Portuguese first division debut on 20 August 2007 in a 1–1 draw at Associação Naval 1º de Maio, being relatively used during his three-year stint, with the Lisbon side being relegated at the end of the 2009–10 season. In the very last minutes of the following summer transfer window, he moved to Cyprus and signed with Ermis Aradippou, reuniting with former Belenenses teammate Wender.
Gómez signed with Major League Soccer club Philadelphia Union on 21 December 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiaunion.com/news/2011/12/union-acquire-panamanian-gomez|title=Union acquire Panamanian Gomez|publisher=Philadelphia Union|date=21 December 2011|accessdate=21 December 2011[/tpl] He scored his first league goal in the season opener against the Portland Timbers.

==International career==

Gómez made his debut for Panama in 2003, against El Salvador. He went on to gain nearly 100 caps for his country, representing it in five CONCACAF Gold Cup tournaments.
