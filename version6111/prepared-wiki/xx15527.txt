West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic arbovirus belonging to the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. This flavivirus is found in temperate and tropical regions of the world. It was first identified in the West Nile subregion in the East African nation of Uganda in 1937. Prior to the mid-1990s, WNV disease occurred only sporadically and was considered a minor risk for humans, until an outbreak in Algeria in 1994, with cases of WNV-caused encephalitis, and the first large outbreak in Romania in 1996, with a high number of cases with neuroinvasive disease. WNV has now spread globally, with the first case in the Western Hemisphere being identified in New York City in 1999;[tpl]cite journal |author=Nash D, Mostashari F, Fine A, et al. |title=The outbreak of West Nile virus infection in the New York City area in 1999 |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=344 |issue=24 |pages=1807–14 |date=June 2001 |pmid=11407341 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200106143442401[/tpl] over the next 5 years, the virus spread across the continental United States, north into Canada, and southward into the Caribbean Islands and Latin America. WNV also spread to Europe, beyond the Mediterranean Basin, and a new strain of the virus was identified in Italy in 2012. WNV is now considered to be an endemic pathogen in Africa, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, Europe and in the United States, which in 2012 has experienced one of its worst epidemics. In 2012, WNV killed 286 people in the United States, with the state of Texas being hard hit by this virus, making the year the deadliest on record for the United States.[tpl]cite news|title=2012 was deadliest year for West Nile in US, CDC says|author=Fox, M.|url=http://vitals.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/13/18232095-2012-was-deadliest-year-for-west-nile-in-us-cdc-says|newspaper=NBC News|date=May 13, 2013|accessdate=May 13, 2013[/tpl]
The main mode of WNV transmission is via various species of mosquitoes, which are the prime vector, with birds being the most commonly infected animal and serving as the prime reservoir host—especially  passerines, which are of the largest order of birds, Passeriformes. WNV has been found in various species of ticks, but current research suggests they are not important vectors of the virus. WNV also infects various mammal species, including  humans, and has been identified in reptilian species, including alligators and crocodiles, and also in amphibians. Not all animal species that are susceptible to WNV infection, including humans, and not all bird species develop sufficient viral levels to transmit the disease to uninfected mosquitoes, and are thus not considered major factors in WNV transmission.[tpl]Cite pmid|12899140[/tpl][tpl]Cite pmid| 15663852[/tpl]
Approximately 80% of West Nile virus infections in humans are subclinical, which cause no symptoms.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.CDC.gov/ncidod/Dvbid/westnile/WNV_factsheet.htm |title=West Nile Virus: What You Need to Know CDC Fact Sheet  |publisher=www.CDC.gov |accessdate=2012-04-09 [/tpl] In the cases where symptoms do occur—termed West Nile fever in cases without neurological disease—the time from infection to the appearance of symptoms (incubation period) is typically between 2 and 15 days. Symptoms may include fever, headaches, fatigue, muscle pain or aches, malaise, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, myalgias and rash. Less than 1% of the cases are severe and result in neurological disease when the central nervous system is affected. People of advanced age, the very young, or those with immunosuppression, either medically induced, such as those taking immunosupressive drugs, or due to a pre-existing medical condition such as HIV infection, are most susceptible. The specific neurological diseases that may occur are West Nile encephalitis, which causes inflammation of the brain, West Nile meningitis, which causes inflammation of the meninges, which are the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord, West Nile meningoencephalitis, which causes inflammation of the brain and also the meninges surrounding it, and West Nile poliomyelitis—spinal cord inflammation, which results in a syndrome similar to polio, which may cause acute flaccid paralysis.
Currently, no vaccine against WNV infection is available. The best method to reduce the rates of WNV infection is mosquito control on the part of municipalities, businesses and individual citizens to reduce breeding populations of mosquitoes in public, commercial and private areas via various means including eliminating standing pools of water where mosquitoes breed, such as in old tires, buckets, unused swimming pools, etc. On an individual basis, the use of personal protective measures to avoid being bitten by an infected mosquito, via the use of mosquito repellent, window screens, avoiding areas where mosquitoes are more prone to congregate, such as near marshes, areas with heavy vegetation etc., and being more vigilant from dusk to dawn when mosquitoes are most active offers the best defense. In the event of being bitten by an infected mosquito, familiarity of the symptoms of WNV on the part of laypersons, physicians and allied health professionals affords the best chance of receiving timely medical treatment, which may aid in reducing associated possible complications and also appropriate palliative care.

==Signs and symptoms==

The incubation period for WNV—the amount of time from infection to symptom onset—is typically from between 2 and 15 days.  Headache can be a prominent symptom of WNV fever, meningitis, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and it may or may not be present in poliomyelytis-like syndrome.  Thus, headache is not a useful indicator of neuroinvasive disease.(CDC)

==Virology==

WNV is one of the Japanese encephalitis antigenic serocomplex of viruses.
Image reconstructions and cryoelectron microscopy reveal a 45–50 nm virion covered with a relatively smooth protein surface. This structure is similar to the dengue fever virus; both belong to the genus Flavivirus within the family Flaviviridae. The genetic material of WNV is a positive-sense, single strand of RNA, which is between 11,000 and 12,000 nucleotides long; these genes encode seven nonstructural proteins and three structural proteins. The RNA strand is held within a nucleocapsid formed from 12-kDa protein blocks; the capsid is contained within a host-derived membrane altered by two viral glycoproteins.

===Phylogeny===

Studies of phylogenetic lineages determined WNV emerged as a distinct virus around 1000 years ago.[tpl]cite journal |author=Galli M, Bernini F, Zehender G |title=Alexander the Great and West Nile virus encephalitis |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=1330–2; author reply 1332–3 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15338540 |doi=10.3201/eid1007.040396 [/tpl] This initial virus developed into two distinct lineages, lineage 1 and its multiple profiles is the source of the epidemic transmission in Africa and throughout the world. Lineage 2 was considered an Africa zoonosis. However, in 2008, lineage 2, previously only seen in horses in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, began to appear in horses in Europe, where the first known outbreak affected 18 animals in Hungary in 2008.[tpl]cite journal| url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=15779|title=Different West Nile Virus Genetic Lineage Evolving?|author=West, Christy|publisher=The Horse, online edition |date = 2010-02-08 |nopp= from statements by Orsolya Kutasi, DVM, of the Szent Istvan University, Hungary at the 2009 American Association of Equine Practitioners Convention, December 5–9, 2009|accessdate=2010-02-10[/tpl]  Lineage 1 West Nile virus was detected in South Africa in 2010 in a mare and her aborted fetus; previously, only lineage 2 West Nile virus had been detected in horses and humans in South Africa.[tpl]cite journal |author=Venter M, Human S, van Niekerk S, Williams J, van Eeden C, Freeman F |title=Fatal neurologic disease and abortion in mare infected with lineage 1 West Nile virus, South Africa |journal=Emerging Infect.

The US virus was very closely related to a lineage 1 strain found in Israel in 1998. Since the first North American cases in 1999, the virus has been reported throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America. There have been human cases and equine cases, and many birds are infected. The Barbary macaque, Macaca sylvanus, was the first nonhuman primate to contract WNV.Hogan, C. Michael (2008). Barbary Macaque: Macaca sylvanus, GlobalTwitcher.com Both the US and Israeli strains are marked by high mortality rates in infected avian populations; the presence of dead birds—especially Corvidae—can be an early indicator of the arrival of the virus.

===Transmission===

The West Nile virus (WNV) is transmitted through female mosquitoes, which are the prime vectors of the virus. Only females feed on blood, and different species have evolved to take a blood meal  on preferred types of vertebrate hosts. The infected mosquito species vary according to geographical area; in the US, Culex pipiens (Eastern US), Culex tarsalis (Midwest and West), and Culex quinquefasciatus (Southeast) are the main sources.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hayes EB, Komar N, Nasci RS, Montgomery SP, O'Leary DR, Campbell GL|title=Epidemiology and transmission dynamics of West Nile virus disease |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=11|issue=8|pages=1167–73 |year=2005 |pmid=16102302 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no08/05-0289a.htm |doi=10.3201/eid1108.050289a |pmc=3320478[/tpl]
The various species that transmit the WNV prefer birds of the Passeriformes order, the largest order of birds. Within that order there is further selectivity with various mosquito species exhibiting preference for different species. In the United States WNV mosquito vectors have shown definitive preference for members of the Corvidae and Thrush family of birds. Amongst the preferred species within these families are the American Crow, a corvid, and the American Robin (Turdus migratorius), a thrush.
The birds develop sufficient viral levels after being infected, to transmit the infection to other biting mosquitoes that in turn go on to infect other birds. In crows and robins, the infection is fatal in 4–5 days. This epizootic viral amplification cycle has been shown to peak 15–16 days before humans become ill. This may be due to the high mortality, and thus depletion of the preferred hosts, i.e., the specific bird species. The mosquitoes become less selective and begin feeding more readily on other animal types such as humans and horses which are considered incidental hosts.[tpl]cite web |title=First Evidence of West Nile Virus Amplification and relationship to Human Infection |format=PDF |publisher= |url=http://www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu/~carsi/INDEX/PUBLICATIONS/wnv_ijgis.pdf[/tpl]
In mammals, the virus does not multiply as readily (i.e., does not develop high viremia during infection), and mosquitoes biting infected mammals are not believed to ingest sufficient virus to become infected,[tpl]cite journal |author=Taylor RM, Hurlbut HS, Dressler HR, Spangler EW, Thrasher D |title=Isolation of West Nile virus from Culex mosquitoes |journal=J Egypt Med Assoc |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=199–208 |year=1953 |pmid=13084817 [/tpl] making mammals so-called dead-end hosts.

====Vertical transmission====

Vertical transmission, the transmission of a viral or bacterial disease from the female of the species to her offspring, has been observed in various West Nile virus studies, amongst different species of mosquitoes in both the laboratory and in nature.[tpl]cite journal | first = LM | last = Bugbee | coauthors = Forte LR |date=September 2004 | title = The discovery of West Nile virus in overwintering Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|journal = Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 326–7 | pmid = 15532939[/tpl] Mosquito progeny infected vertically in autumn, may potentially serve as a mechanism for WNV to overwinter and initiate enzootic horizontal transmission the following spring.[tpl]cite journal |author=Goddard LB, Roth AE, Reisen WK, Scott TW |title=Vertical transmission of West Nile Virus by three California Culex (Diptera: Culicidae) species |journal=J.

===Risk factors===

Risk factors independently associated with developing a clinical infection with WNV include a suppressed immune system and a patient history of organ transplantation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kumar D, Drebot MA, Wong SJ, et al. |title=A seroprevalence study of West Nile virus infection in solid organ transplant recipients |journal=Am. J. Transplant. |volume=4|issue=11 |pages=1883–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15476490 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-6143.2004.00592.x [/tpl]   For neuroinvasive disease the additional risk factors include older age (>50+), male sex, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.[tpl]cite journal |author=Jean CM, Honarmand S, Louie JK, Glaser CA |title=Risk factors for West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease, California, 2005 |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=1918–20 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18258047 |pmc=2876738 |doi=10.3201/eid1312.061265 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Kumar D, Drebot MA, Wong SJ, et al. |title=A seroprevalence study of west nile virus infection in solid organ transplant recipients |journal=Am.

A genetic factor also appears to increase susceptibility to West Nile disease. A mutation of the gene CCR5 gives some protection against HIV but leads to more serious complications of WNV infection. Carriers of two mutated copies of CCR5 made up 4.0 to 4.5% of a sample of West Nile disease sufferers, while the incidence of the gene in the general population is only 1.0%.[tpl]cite journal | first = WG | last = Glass | coauthors = Lim JK, Cholera R, Pletnev AG, Gao JL, Murphy PM | date = October 17, 2005 | title = Chemokine receptor CCR5 promotes leukocyte trafficking to the brain and survival in West Nile virus infection | journal = Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 202 | issue = 8 | pages = 1087–98 | pmid = 16230476 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20042530 | pmc = 2213214[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | first = WG | last = Glass | coauthors = McDermott DH, Lim JK, Lekhong S, Yu SF, Frank WA, Pape J, Cheshier RC, Murphy PM | date = January 23, 2006 | title = CCR5 deficiency increases risk of symptomatic West Nile virus infection | journal = Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 203 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–40 | pmid = 16418398 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20051970 | pmc = 2118086[/tpl]

==Diagnosis==

Preliminary diagnosis is often based on the patient's clinical symptoms, places and dates of travel (if patient is from a non-endemic country or area), activities, and epidemiologic history of the location where infection occurred. A recent history of mosquito bites and an acute febrile illness associated with neurologic signs and symptoms should cause clinical suspicion of WNV.
Diagnosis of West Nile Virus infections is generally accomplished by serologic testing of blood serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is obtained via a lumbar puncture.
Typical findings of WNV infection include lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein level, reference glucose and lactic acid levels, and no erythrocytes.
Definitive diagnosis of WNV is obtained through detection of virus-specific antibody Immunoglobulin M, (IgM) and neutralizing antibodies. Cases of West Nile virus meningitis and encephalitis that have been serologically confirmed produce similar degrees of CSF pleocytosis and are often associated with substantial CSF neutrophilia.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tyler KL, Pape J, Goody RJ, Corkill M, Kleinschmidt-DeMasters BK |title=CSF findings in 250 patients with serologically confirmed West Nile virus meningitis and encephalitis |journal=Neurology |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=361–5 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16382032 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000195890.70898.1f [/tpl]
Specimens collected within 8 days following onset of illness may not test positive for West Nile IgM, and testing should be repeated.   A positive test for West Nile IgG in the absence of a positive West Nile IgM is indicative of a previous flavavirus infection and is not by itself evidence of an acute West Nile virus infection.[tpl]cite web |title=2012 DOHMH Advisory  #8: West Nile Virus |format=PDF |publisher=NYC |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/cd/2012/12md08.pdf[/tpl]
If cases of suspected West Nile virus infection, sera should be collected on both the acute and
convalescent phase of the illness.  Convalescent specimens should be collected 2–3 weeks after acute specimens.
It is common in serologic testing for cross-reactions to occur among flaviviruses such as Dengue virus (DENV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus, this necessitates caution when evaluating serologic results of flaviviral infections.[tpl]cite journal |author=Papa A, Karabaxoglou D, Kansouzidou A |title=Acute West Nile virus neuroinvasive infections: cross-reactivity with dengue virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus |journal=J. Med. Virol. |volume=83 |issue=10 |pages=1861–5 |date=October 2011 |pmid=21837806 |doi=10.1002/jmv.22180 [/tpl]
Four FDA-cleared WNV IgM ELISA kits are commercially available from different manufacturers in the U.S., each of these kits is indicated for use on serum to aid in the presumptive laboratory diagnosis of WNV infection in patients with clinical symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis. Positive WNV test kits obtained via use of these kits should be confirmed by additional testing at a state health department laboratory or CDC.
In fatal cases, nucleic acid amplification, histopathology with immunohistochemistry and virus culture of autopsy tissues can also be useful. Only a few state laboratories or other specialized laboratories, including those at CDC, are capable of doing this specialized testing

===Differential diagnosis===

A number of various diseases may present with symptoms similar to those caused by a clinical West Nile virus infection. Those causing neuroinvasive disease symptoms include the enterovirus infection and bacterial meningitis. Accounting for differential diagnoses is a crucial step in the definitive diagnosis of WNV infection. Consideration of a differential diagnosis is required when a patient presents with unexplained febrile illness, extreme headache, encephalitis or meningitis. Diagnostic and serologic laboratory testing utilizing PCR testing and viral culture of CSF to identify the specific pathogen causing the symptoms, is the only currently available means of differentiating between causes of encephalitis and meningitis.

==Prevention==

Personal protective measures can be taken to greatly reduce the risk of being bitten by an infected mosquito:

===Monitoring and control===

West Nile virus can be sampled from the environment by the pooling of trapped mosquitoes via ovitraps, carbon dioxide-baited light traps, and gravid traps, testing blood samples drawn from wild birds, dogs and sentinel monkeys, as well as testing brains of dead birds found by various animal control agencies and the public.
Testing of the mosquito samples requires the use of RT-PCR to directly amplify and show the presence of virus in the submitted samples. When using the blood sera of wild birds and sentinel chickens, samples must be tested for the presence of WNV antibodies by use of immunohistochemistry (IHC)[tpl]cite journal | first = M | last = Jozan | coauthors = Evans R, McLean R, Hall R, Tangredi B, Reed L, Scott J |date=Fall 2003 | title = Detection of West Nile virus infection in birds in the United States by blocking ELISA and immunohistochemistry | journal = Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases |volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 99–110 | pmid = 14511579 | doi = 10.1089/153036603768395799[/tpl] or Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).[tpl]cite journal | first = RA | last = Hall | coauthors = Broom AK, Hartnett AC, Howard MJ, Mackenzie JS |date=February 1995 | title = Immunodominant epitopes on the NS1 protein of MVE and KUN viruses serve as targets for a blocking ELISA to detect virus-specific antibodies in sentinel animal serum | journal = Journal of Virological Methods | volume = 51 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 201–10 | pmid = 7738140 | doi = 10.1016/0166-0934(94)00105-P[/tpl]
Dead birds, after necropsy, have their various tissues tested for virus by either RT-PCR or IHC, where virus shows up as brown-stained tissue because of a substrate-enzyme reaction.
West Nile control is achieved through mosquito control, by elimination of mosquito breeding sites such as abandoned pools, applying larvacide to active breeding areas and targeting the adult population via lethal ovitraps, aerial spraying of pesticides.
Environmentalists have condemned attempts to control the transmitting mosquitoes by spraying pesticide, saying the detrimental health effects of spraying outweigh the relatively few lives that may be saved, and more environmentally friendly ways of controlling mosquitoes are available. They also question the effectiveness of insecticide spraying, as they believe mosquitoes that are resting or flying above the level of spraying will not be killed; the most common vector in the northeastern US, Culex pipiens, is a canopy feeder.

File:Used tires.jpg|Used tires often hold stagnant water and are a breeding ground for many species of mosquitoes. Some species such as the Asian Tiger mosquito prefer manmade containers; such as tires, to lay their eggs in. The rapid spread of this aggressive daytime feeding species beyond their native range has been attributed to the used tire trade.[tpl]cite web |author=Rios L, Maruniak JE |title=Asian Tiger Mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Insecta: Diptera: Culicidae) |date=October 2011 |publisher=Department of Entomology and Nematology, University of Florida |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/in594 |id=EENY-319[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Benedict MQ, Levine RS, Hawley WA, Lounibos LP |title=Spread of the tiger: global risk of invasion by the mosquito Aedes albopictus |journal=Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=76–85 |year=2007 |pmid=17417960 |pmc=2212601 |doi=10.1089/vbz.2006.0562 [/tpl]

==Treatment==

No specific treatment is available for WNV infection. In severe cases treatment consists of supportive care that often involves hospitalization, intravenous fluids, respiratory support, and prevention of secondary infections.

==Prognosis==

While the general prognosis is favorable, current studies indicate that West Nile Fever can often be more severe than previously recognized, with studies of various recent outbreaks indicating that it may take as long as 60–90 days to recover.[tpl]cite journal |author=Watson JT, Pertel PE, Jones RC, et al. |title=Clinical characteristics and functional outcomes of West Nile Fever |journal=Ann.

==Epidemiology==

WNV was first isolated from a feverish 37-year-old woman at Omogo in the West Nile District of Uganda in 1937 during research on yellow fever virus.[tpl]cite journal |author=Smithburn KC, Hughes TP, Burke AW, Paul JH |title=A Neurotropic Virus Isolated from the Blood of a Native of Uganda |journal=Am. J. Trop. Med. |volume=20 |issue=1|pages=471–92 |date=June 1940[/tpl]  A series of serosurveys in 1939 in central Africa found anti-WNV positive results ranging from 1.4% (Congo) to 46.4% (White Nile region, Sudan). It was subsequently identified in Egypt (1942) and India (1953), a 1950 serosurvey in Egypt found 90% of those over 40 years in age had WNV antibodies. The ecology was characterized in 1953 with studies in Egypt[tpl]cite journal |author=Work TH, Hurlbut HS, Taylor RM |title=Isolation of West Nile virus from hooded crow and rock pigeon in the Nile delta |journal=Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. |volume=84 |issue=3|pages=719–22 |year=1953 |pmid=13134268 |doi=10.3181/00379727-84-20764 [/tpl] and Israel.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bernkopf H, Levine S, Nerson R |title=Isolation of West Nile virus in Israel |journal=J.

Dis. |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=207–18 |year=1953|pmid=13109233 |doi=10.1093/infdis/93.3.207 [/tpl] The virus became recognized as a cause of severe human meningoencephalitis in elderly patients during an outbreak in Israel in 1957. The disease was first noted in horses in Egypt and France in the early 1960s and found to be widespread in southern Europe, southwest Asia and Australia.
The first appearance of WNV in the Western Hemisphere was in 1999  with encephalitis reported in humans, dogs, cats, and horses, and the subsequent spread in the United States may be an important milestone in the evolving history of this virus. The American outbreak began in College Point, Queens in New York City and was later spread to the neighboring states of New Jersey and Connecticut. The virus is believed to have entered in an infected bird or mosquito, although there is no clear evidence.[tpl]cite journal |author=Calisher CH |title=West Nile virus in the New World: appearance, persistence, and adaptation to a new econiche—an opportunity taken |journal=Viral Immunol.|volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=411–4 |year=2000 |pmid=11192287 |doi=10.1089/vim.2000.13.411 [/tpl]
West Nile virus is now endemic in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, west and central Asia, Oceania (subtype Kunjin), and most recently, North America and is spreading into Central and South America.
Recent outbreaks of West Nile virus encephalitis in humans have occurred in Algeria (1994), Romania (1996 to 1997), the Czech Republic (1997), Congo (1998), Russia (1999), the United States (1999 to 2009), Canada (1999–2007), Israel (2000) and Greece (2010).
Epizootics of disease in horses occurred in Morocco (1996), Italy (1998), the United States (1999 to 2001), and France (2000), Mexico (2003) and Sardinia (2011).

==Research==

A vaccine for horses (ATCvet code: [tpl]ATCvet|I05|AA10[/tpl]) based on killed viruses exists; some zoos have given this vaccine to their birds, although its effectiveness is unknown. Dogs and cats show few if any signs of infection. There have been no known cases of direct canine-human or feline-human transmission; although these pets can become infected, it is unlikely they are, in turn, capable of infecting native mosquitoes and thus continuing the disease cycle.[tpl]cite web |title=Vertebrate Ecology |date=30 April 2009 |work=West Nile Virus |publisher=Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, CDC |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/birds&mammals.htm[/tpl]
