==Transport==

Formerly part of the A406, Woodford Avenue has now been renumbered as the A1400 and a new section of the A406 has been built through Redbridge and Ilford to Barking and Beckton.   The A12 runs east-west, and the A123, Cranbrook Road, runs north-south, through Gants Hill roundabout, which is also the endpoint of the A1400.  All these roads have several bus routes along them  (see map).  A minor road, Clarence Avenue, also comes off the roundabout.
Gants Hill tube station on the Central Line of the London Underground is underneath the roundabout.  There are several entrances to the station, and the pedestrian tunnels to the station also form an underpass for people wishing to cross the busy roads near the roundabout.
