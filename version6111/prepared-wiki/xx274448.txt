Spravedlnost, ([tpl]lang-de|Iricht[/tpl], more rarely Irigt) is a hill, shrouded in legend, in the extreme east of Bohemian Switzerland. The 533 m high volcanic cone is the local mountain of the village of Doubice (German: Daubitz).
The basalt peak rises south of the village of Nová Doubice (Neudaubitz) on the old road to Chřibská (Kreibitz). On the southern slopes of the hill lie the houses of Liščí Bělidlo (Irichtbleiche) that belong to the municipality of Chřibská.
