==History==

The Mornington Road District was first created on 6 November 1860, and became a shire on 24 November 1871. On 31 May 1893, it was renamed the Shire of Frankston and Hastings, and lost its western riding to the New Mornington Shire, which itself was later renamed the Shire of Mornington. The two shires were almost reunited in a major local government reform programme in 1915.Victoria Government Gazette, 28 April 1915, p.1915:1530.
On 19 October 1960, the Central and Eastern Ridings of the shire were severed and, with parts of the Eastern Riding of the Shire of Flinders, was incorporated as the Shire of Hastings. The remainder was renamed the Shire of Frankston, and after a petition was received by the Government on 4 May 1966, Frankston was proclaimed as a city, on 24 August 1966.[tpl]cite book|title=Victorian Municipal Directory|year=1992|publisher=Arnall & Jackson|location=Brunswick|pages=377â€“378, 695[/tpl] Accessed at State Library of Victoria, La Trobe Reading Room.
On 15 December 1994, the City of Frankston was abolished, and, along with parts of the Cities of Cranbourne and Springvale, was merged into the new City of Frankston. Parts of Mount Eliza were transferred to the newly created Shire of Mornington Peninsula.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/76E601D6DB55E88ACA25722500049195/$File/12570_1994-95.pdf|title=Victorian local government amalgamations 1994-1995: Changes to the Australian Standard Geographical Classification|author=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=1 August 1995|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|page=10|isbn=0-642-23117-6|accessdate=2007-12-16[/tpl]
Some changes occurred between the release of the Local Government Board report in July 1994 and the actual amalgamation; the original plan was to merge Frankston with the City of Chelsea, and take Braeside and Carrum Downs, from the City of Springvale. However, Frankston City Council submitted that it should expand eastwards instead, as well as taking Mount Eliza and Baxter.[tpl]cite news|title=Crunch time for councils in south and south-east|last=Neales|first=Sue|date=27 July 1994|page=8|work=The Age[/tpl] By October, the present boundaries had been agreed upon, but the new entity was to be known as the City of Nepean. This appeared in the Board's final report in November 1994.[tpl]cite news|title=The councils shake-up|date=22 October 1994|page=10|work=The Age[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Report outlines new council boundaries|last=Gettler|first=Leon|date=19 November 1994|page=10|work=The Age[/tpl] However, the State Government ultimately decided to use the old name for the new entity, departing from the Board's recommendation.[tpl]cite news|title=Most council elections in 1996|last=Gettler|first=Leon|date=16 December 1994|page=6|work=The Age[/tpl]
