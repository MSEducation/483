The East River is not a river but a tidal strait, in New York City.  It connects Upper New York Bay on its south end to Long Island Sound on its north end. It separates Long Island (including the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn) from the island of Manhattan and the Bronx on the North American mainland.  In reference to its connection to Long Island Sound, it was once also known as the Sound River.Montr√©sor, John (1766). A plan of the city of New-York & its environs. London. The tidal strait changes its flow direction frequently.

==Formation==

The strait was formed approximately 11,000 years ago at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation.[tpl]cite news|title=The East River Flows From Prehistoric Times To Today |url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2005-07-20/features/049.html |newspaper=The Queens Gazette |date=July 20, 2005 |accessdate=2010-07-31[/tpl] The distinct change in the shape of the strait between the lower and upper portions is evidence of this glacial activity.  The upper portion (from Long Island Sound to Hell Gate), running largely perpendicular to the glacial motion, is wide, meandering, and has deep narrow bays on both banks, scoured out by the glacier's movement.  The lower portion (from Hell Gate to New York Bay) runs north-south, parallel to the glacial motion.  It is much narrower, with straight banks.  The bays that exist (or existed before being filled in by human activity), are largely wide and shallow.

==The channel==

Due to heavy pollution, the East River is dangerous to people who fall in or attempt to swim in it, although as of mid-2007 the water was cleaner than it had been in decades. Anyone in the channel would find there are few places from which to climb out. According to the marine sciences section of the city Department of Environmental Protection, the channel is swift, with water moving as fast as four knots (just as it does in the Hudson River on the other side of Manhattan). That speed can push casual swimmers out to sea. A few people drown in the waters around New York City each year.[tpl]cite news |title=Welcome, Students.

Historically, the lower portion of the strait (separating Manhattan from Brooklyn) was one of the busiest and most important channels in the world, particularly during the first three centuries of New York City's history. The Brooklyn Bridge, opened in 1883, was the first bridge to span the strait, replacing frequent ferry service. Some passenger ferry service remains between Queens and Manhattan.
The Bronx River drains into the East River in the northern section of the strait.
North of Randalls Island, it is joined by the Bronx Kill. Along the east of Wards Island, at approximately the strait's midpoint, it narrows into a channel called Hell Gate, which is spanned by both the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge (formerly the Triborough), and the Hell Gate Bridge. On the south side of Wards Island, it is joined by the Harlem River.
Newtown Creek on Long Island drains into the East River, forming part of the boundary between Queens and Brooklyn.
The East River contains a number of islands, including:
