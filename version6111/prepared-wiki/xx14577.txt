[[10 yottametres]]

CATEGORIES: Orders of magnitude (length)

To help compare different orders of magnitude, this page lists distances starting at 10 Ym (1025 m or 1.1 gigalight-years).  At this scale, expansion of the universe becomes significant. Distance of these objects are derived from their measured redshifts, which depends on the cosmological models used.
Distances shorter than 10 Ym
Distances longer than 100 Ym
