==Professional career==

===Pittsburgh Steelers===

He was drafted with the sixth pick of the second round of the 2004 NFL Draft out of Tusculum College. He is perhaps best known for his momentum-shifting muffed punt in week three of the 2006 season.  With the Steelers up 17 to 14 against the Cincinnati Bengals, Colclough was back for a punt with roughly eight minutes remaining.  He attempted to field the punt by raising his hands above his head, then dropping the punt.  He and teammate free safety Tyrone Carter both had a chance to recover, but both failed.  One play after the miscue, Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer hit wide receiver T.J. Houshmandzadeh for a score.  The Steelers ended up losing the game, 28-20.
Colclough was put on the injured reserve list in early October of the 2006 NFL season. On October 30, 2007, Colclough was released by the Steelers after appearing in three games.
