The shooting competitions at the 2000 Summer Olympics were carried out at the Sydney International Shooting Centre in Liverpool, New South Wales, Australia during the first week of the Games, from Saturday 16 September 2000 to Saturday 23 September 2000.
While the rifle, pistol and running target rules were largely unchanged from the Atlanta Games, two new shotgun events were added (women's trap and women's skeet), raising the number of individual Olympic shooting events to an all-time high of seventeen.
