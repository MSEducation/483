A Man Called Sarge is a 1990 American parody film, written and directed by Stuart Gillard, starring Gary Kroeger, Marc Singer, Gretchen German and introducing a young Natasha Lyonne. Set during the World War II North African Western Desert Campaign, it follows a misadventurous squad of French Foreign Legion deserters, led by their charismatic Sarge, who set out across the Sahara desert to strike a blow on the Nazi-occupied city of Tobruk.
The humour is built on slapstick and verbal puns, in the fashion of comedy filmmaking trio Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker, spoofing a variety of classic war movies – notably Casablanca[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100100/movieconnections|title=A Man Called Sarge|work=Movie connections|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2010-06-18[/tpl] – and the stereotypes of the genre. Sarge (Gary Kroeger), the anti-hero protagonist, is a patriot with an over-the-top John Wayne persona. The antagonist, General Von Kraut (Marc Singer), is a derogatory portrayal of a Nazi commander – extremely evil, perverted and a poor decision maker – emphasized by his name, as kraut is often used as a pejorative term for German soldiers. Furthermore, Sarge's group of misfit soldiers include a Native American, a New York Jew, a hillbilly and a French officer in the style of Maurice Chevalier.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.movieguide.org/archive/32/7381/&Itemid=44|title=A Man Called Sarge|work=Christian Movie Review|publisher=Movieguide|accessdate=2010-05-20[/tpl]
A memorable moment in the movie is when Miss Sadie (Gretchen German), a naïve mission school teacher, sings a song called "Jesus was a Black Dude", with a full gospel choir, to the Arab children in her class.
The film was shot on location in Israel.
