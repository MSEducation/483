The 2011 Chile blackout was a major power outage that occurred on 24 September 2011, approximately between 20:30 and 21:45 local time (23:30 and 00:45 UTC respectively), although the time of reinstatement varied geographically.  It mainly affected the regions from Coquimbo to Maule, where the blackout was total, but it also reportedly partially affected the Atacama and Bío Bío regions.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/nacional/2011/09/680-394865-9-corte-de-luz-afecta-desde-la-tercera-a-la-octava-region.shtml |title=Corte de luz afecta desde la Tercera a la Octava Región |accessdate=25 September 2011 |author=La Tercera |date=24 September 2011 |publisher=COPESA[/tpl]  The blackout affected approximately nine million Chileans.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.cdec-sic.cl/imagenes/contenidos/File/noticias/2011/sep11/Comunicado%20CDEC-SIC.pdf |title=Comunicado del CDEC SIC "Apagón del SIC" |accessdate=24 September 2011 |author=Ricke Muñoz, Eduardo |date=24 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Widespread power blackout darkens much of Chile; subway riders evacuated in capital |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/widespread-power-blackout-darkens-much-of-chile-subway-riders-evacuated-in-capital/2011/09/24/gIQAtl7fuK_story.html |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=25 September 2011 |archiveurl= |archivedate=[/tpl]
The cause of the blackout, which started at 20:30 local time (UTC−03:00), was later determined to be equipment failure at an electrical substation. Rodrigo Álvarez Zenteno, Minister of Energy, noted a computer system malfunction and "oscillation problems" affecting two power lines.

The outage affected operations at a number of copper mines, of which Chile is the world's top producer.[tpl]cite news |title=UPDATE 4-Power blackout hits Chile, halts copper mines |first=Moises |last=Avila |first2=Simon |last2=Gardner |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/25/chile-blackout-idUSS1E78N0CX20110925 |agency=Reuters |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=25 September 2011 |archiveurl= |archivedate=[/tpl]  The Los Bronces mine, operated by Anglo American, halted production temporarily and later, with power from generators, resumed at one-third capacity.  CODELCO, Chile's state-owned copper mining company, reported that its Andina division and the El Teniente mine had lost power but continued operations using generators until power was restored.

==Blackout Investigation==

On 6 December 2011, the Chile regulatory authority Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels  (SEC) determined that the cause of the blackout was an electrical short circuit in a 220 Kilovolt capacitor bank at the Ancoa electrical substation which is located in Linares, Chile, and the subsequent malfunction of the associated protective relay equipment that should have prevented the cascading failure. SEC also determined that the time needed to restore power was prolonged by both procedural and equipment issues.
As a result of the investigation, SEC has assessed charges against the following four power companies; Transelec, Endesa (Chile), Colbún S.A., and Chilectra.
The Superintendent of the SEC, Luis Avila Bravo, said "we are making charges for not maintaining the equipment in good condition, which ultimately represents a threat to the power system security as well as for problems in applying the procedures used to restore the supply of power ".
Avila added that companies now have 15 days to respond to the charges, after which the SEC may determine sanctions, and possible fines of up to 10,000 AWU (approx. $9M US) although the final amount will depend on the merits of each investigation.[tpl]cite news |title=SEC formula cargos contra TRANSELEC, ENDESA, COLBÚN y CHILECTRA por el blackout del "24S" |url=http://www.sec.cl/portal/page?_pageid=33,4559637&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |date=6 December 2011 |archiveurl= |archivedate=[/tpl]
