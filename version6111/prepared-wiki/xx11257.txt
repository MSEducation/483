In metallurgy, stainless steel, also known as inox steel or inox from French "inoxydable", is a steel alloy with a minimum of 10.5%[tpl]cite web | title = The Stainless Steel Family | url = http://www.worldstainless.org/Files/issf/non-image-files/PDF/TheStainlessSteelFamily.pdf | accessdate = 8 December 2012 [/tpl] chromium content by mass.
Stainless steel does not readily corrode, rust or stain with water as ordinary steel does, but despite the name it is not fully stain-proof, most notably under low-oxygen, high-salinity, or poor-circulation environments.[tpl]cite web| title = Why is Stainless Steel Stainless?|url = http://www.stainless-steel-blog.com/2013/09/06/why-is-stainless-steel-stainless/|accessdate = 6 September 2013[/tpl]  There are different grades and surface finishes of stainless steel to suit the environment the alloy must endure. Stainless steel is used where both the properties of steel and resistance to corrosion are required.
Stainless steel differs from carbon steel by the amount of chromium present. Unprotected carbon steel rusts readily when exposed to air and moisture. This iron oxide film (the rust) is active and accelerates corrosion by forming more iron oxide, and due to the greater volume of the iron oxide this tends to flake and fall away. Stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to form a passive film of chromium oxide, which prevents further surface corrosion by blocking oxygen diffusion to the steel surface and blocks corrosion from spreading into the metal's internal structure, and due to the similar size of the steel and oxide ions they bond very strongly and remain attached to the surface.Stainless Steels and Alloys: Why They Resist Corrosion and How They Fail".

Passivation only occurs if the proportion of chromium is high enough and oxygen is present.

==History==

A few corrosion-resistant iron artifacts survive from antiquity. A famous example is the Iron Pillar of Delhi, erected by order of Kumara Gupta I around AD 400. Unlike stainless steel, however, these artifacts owe their durability not to chromium but to their high phosphorus content, which, together with favorable local weather conditions, promotes the formation of a solid protective passivation layer of iron oxides and phosphates, rather than the non-protective cracked rust layer that develops on most ironwork.
The corrosion resistance of iron-chromium alloys was first recognized in 1821 by French metallurgist Pierre Berthier, who noted their resistance against attack by some acids and suggested their use in cutlery. Metallurgists of the 19th century were unable to produce the combination of low carbon and high chromium found in most modern stainless steels, and the high-chromium alloys they could produce were too brittle to be practical.
In the late 1890s Hans Goldschmidt of Germany developed an aluminothermic (thermite) process for producing carbon-free chromium. Between 1904 and 1911 several researchers, particularly Leon Guillet of France, prepared alloys that would today be considered stainless steel.
Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft built the 366-ton sailing yacht Germania featuring a chrome-nickel steel hull in Germany in 1908.[tpl]cite web |url=http://dhr.dos.state.fl.us/archaeology/underwater/preserves/HM_Prop3.pdf |title=A Proposal to Establish the Shipwreck Half Moon as a State Underwater Archaeological Preserve |date=May 2000 |publisher=Bureau of Archaeological Research, Division of Historical Resources, Florida Department of State[/tpl] In 1911, Philip Monnartz reported on the relationship between chromium content and corrosion resistance. On 17 October 1912, Krupp engineers Benno Strauss and Eduard Maurer patented austenitic stainless steel as ThyssenKrupp Nirosta.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nirosta.de/History.22.0.html?&L=1 |title=ThyssenKrupp Nirosta: History |accessdate=13 August 2007[/tpl]
Similar developments were taking place contemporaneously in the United States, where Christian Dantsizen and Frederick Becket were industrializing ferritic stainless steel. In 1912, Elwood Haynes applied for a US patent on a martensitic stainless steel alloy, which was not granted until 1919.Carlisle, Rodney P. (2004) Scientific American Inventions and Discoveries, p. 380, John Wiley and Sons, ISBN 0-471-24410-4
Also in 1912, Harry Brearley of the Brown-Firth research laboratory in Sheffield, England, while seeking a corrosion-resistant alloy for gun barrels, discovered and subsequently industrialized a martensitic stainless steel alloy. The discovery was announced two years later in a January 1915 newspaper article in The New York Times. The metal was later marketed under the 'Staybrite' brand by Firth Vickers in England and was used for the new entrance canopy for the Savoy Hotel in London in 1929.Howse, Geoffrey (2011) A Photographic History of Sheffield Steel, History Press, ISBN 0752459856 Brearley applied for a US patent during 1915 only to find that Haynes had already registered a patent. Brearley and Haynes pooled their funding and with a group of investors formed the American Stainless Steel Corporation, with headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[tpl]cite book |last= Cobb |first= Harold M. |title=The History of Stainless Steel |publisher=ASM International|year=2010 |isbn = 1-61503-010-7 |page = 360[/tpl]
In the beginning stainless steel was sold in the US under different brand names like 'Allegheny metal' and 'Nirosta steel'. Even within the metallurgy industry the eventual name remained unsettled; in 1921 one trade journal was calling it "unstainable steel".[tpl]cite news|last=Moneypenny|first=J.H.G.|title=Unstainable Steel|url=http://archive.org/details/miningscientific122sanfuoft|accessdate=17 February 2013|newspaper=Mining and Scientific Press|date=2 April 1921[/tpl] In 1929, before the Great Depression hit, over 25,000 tons of stainless steel were manufactured and sold in the US.[tpl]cite book|author=Bonnier Corporation |title=Popular Science |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sygDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA31|year=1930 |publisher=Bonnier Corporation |pages=31– |issn=01617370[/tpl]

==Properties==

===Oxidation===

High oxidation resistance in air at ambient temperature is normally achieved with additions of a minimum of 13% (by weight) chromium, and up to 26% is used for harsh environments.[tpl]cite book |last=Ashby |first=Michael F. |authorlink=M. F. Ashby|coauthors=& David R. H. Jones |title=Engineering Materials 2 |origyear=1986 |edition=with corrections |year=1992 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-08-032532-7 |page=119 |chapter=Chapter 12 [/tpl] The chromium forms a passivation layer of chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3) when exposed to oxygen. The layer is too thin to be visible, and the metal remains lustrous and smooth. The layer is impervious to water and air, protecting the metal beneath, and this layer quickly reforms when the surface is scratched. This phenomenon is called passivation and is seen in other metals, such as aluminium and titanium. Corrosion resistance can be adversely affected if the component is used in a non-oxygenated environment, a typical example being underwater keel bolts buried in timber.
When stainless steel parts such as nuts and bolts are forced together, the oxide layer can be scraped off, allowing the parts to weld together. When forcibly disassembled, the welded material may be torn and pitted, an effect known as galling. This destructive galling can be avoided by the use of dissimilar materials for the parts forced together, for example bronze and stainless steel, or even different types of stainless steels (martensitic against austenitic). However, two different alloys electrically connected in a humid environment may act as Voltaic pile and corrode faster. Nitronic alloys made by selective alloying with manganese and nitrogen may have a reduced tendency to gall. Additionally, threaded joints may be lubricated to prevent galling.

===Acids===

Stainless steel is generally highly resistant to attack from acids, but this quality depends on the kind and concentration of the acid, the surrounding temperature, and the type of steel.  Type 304 is resistant to sulfuric acid at room temperature, even in high concentrations, but type 316 and 317 are only resistant at low concentrations. All types of stainless steel resist attack from phosphoric acid, 316 and 317 more so than 304; and Types 304L and 430 have been successfully used with nitric acid. Hydrochloric acid will damage any kind of stainless steel, and should be avoided.[tpl]citation|author=Davis|title=Stainless Steels, Joseph R. |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OrlG98AHdoAC&pg=PA118|date=1994|publisher=ASM International|isbn=978-0-87170-503-7|page=118[/tpl]

===Bases===

The 300 series of stainless steel grades is unaffected by any of the weak bases such as ammonium hydroxide, even in high concentrations and at high temperatures.  The same grades of stainless exposed to stronger bases such as sodium hydroxide at high concentrations and high temperatures will likely experience some etching and cracking, especially with solutions containing chlorides.

===Organics===

Types 316 and 317 are both useful for storing and handling acetic acid, especially in solutions where it is combined with formic acid and when aeration is not present (oxygen helps protect stainless steel under such conditions), though 317 provides the greatest level of resistance to corrosion.  Type 304 is also commonly used with formic acid though it will tend to discolor the solution. All grades resist damage from aldehydes and amines, though in the latter case grade 316 is preferable to 304; cellulose acetate will damage 304 unless the temperature is kept low. Fats and fatty acids only affect grade 304 at temperatures above [tpl]convert|150|C|F[/tpl], and grade 316 above [tpl]convert|260|C|F[/tpl], while 317 is unaffected at all temperatures. Type 316L is required for processing of urea.

===Electricity and magnetism===

Similarly to steel, stainless steel is a relatively poor conductor of electricity, with a few percent of the electrical conductivity of copper.
Ferritic and martensitic stainless steels are magnetic. Austenitic stainless steels are non-magnetic.

==Applications==

Stainless steel’s resistance to corrosion and staining, low maintenance and familiar lustre make it an ideal material for many applications. There are over 150 grades of stainless steel, of which fifteen are most commonly used. The alloy is milled into coils, sheets, plates, bars, wire, and tubing to be used in cookware, cutlery, household hardware, surgical instruments, major appliances, industrial equipment (for example, in sugar refineries) and as an automotive and aerospace structural alloy and construction material in large buildings. Storage tanks and tankers used to transport orange juice and other food are often made of stainless steel, because of its corrosion resistance. This also influences its use in commercial kitchens and food processing plants, as it can be steam-cleaned and sterilized and does not need paint or other surface finishes.
Stainless steel is used for jewelry and watches with 316L being the type commonly used for such applications. It can be re-finished by any jeweler and will not oxidize or turn black.
Some firearms incorporate stainless steel components as an alternative to blued or parkerized steel. Some handgun models, such as the Smith & Wesson Model 60 and the Colt M1911 pistol, can be made entirely from stainless steel. This gives a high-luster finish similar in appearance to nickel plating. Unlike plating, the finish is not subject to flaking, peeling, wear-off from rubbing (as when repeatedly removed from a holster), or rust when scratched.
Some automotive manufacturers use stainless steel as decorative highlights in their vehicles.

===Architecture===

Stainless steel is used for buildings for both practical and aesthetic reasons. Stainless steel was in vogue during the art deco period. The most famous example of this is the upper portion of the Chrysler Building (pictured). Some diners and fast-food restaurants use large ornamental panels and stainless fixtures and furniture. Because of the durability of the material, many of these buildings retain their original appearance.
Type 316 stainless is used on the exterior of both the Petronas Twin Towers and the Jin Mao Building, two of the world's tallest skyscrapers.What is Stainless Steel? nickelinstitute.org

===Other===

The Allegheny Ludlum Corporation worked with Ford on various concept cars with stainless steel bodies from the 1930s through the 1970s, as demonstrations of the material's potential. The 1957 and 1958 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham had a stainless steel roof. In 1981 and 1982, the DeLorean DMC-12 production automobile used stainless steel body panels over a glass-reinforced plastic monocoque. Intercity buses made by Motor Coach Industries are partially made of stainless steel.  The aft body panel of the Porsche Cayman model (2-door coupe hatchback) is made of stainless steel.  It was discovered during early body prototyping that conventional steel could not be formed without cracking (due to the many curves and angles in that automobile).  Thus, Porsche was forced to use stainless steel on the Cayman. 
Rail cars have commonly been manufactured using corrugated stainless steel panels (for additional structural strength). This was particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s, but has since declined. One notable example was the early Pioneer Zephyr. Notable former manufacturers of stainless steel rolling stock included the Budd Company (USA), which has been licensed to Japan's Tokyu Car Corporation, and the Portuguese company Sorefame. Many railcars in the United States are still manufactured with stainless steel, unlike other countries who have shifted away.
Budd also built an airplane, the Budd BB-1 Pioneer, of stainless steel tube and sheet, which is on display at the Franklin Institute.
The American Fleetwings Sea Bird amphibious aircraft of 1936 was also built using a spot-welded stainless steel hull.
The Bristol Aeroplane Company built the all-stainless steel Bristol 188 high-speed research aircraft, which first flew in 1963.

==Maintenance of stainless steel==

If treated or stored incorrectly, all grades of stainless steel may discolor or stain. In order to maintain optimum appearance, the surface of stainless steel must be cared for regularly.

===Maintenance during installation===

The quality of installation affects the durability and life-time of stainless steel. Therefore it is important to make sure stainless steel is in good condition before installation. Normally, a quick cleaning is enough for installation in most cases. However, if surface contamination is present, more attention is required. In addition, an extremely high standard of cleanliness may be required for stainless steel applied used in the fields of aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and food handling.

===Routine maintenance===

Maintenance is required to maintain the quality of steel. Depending on the environment, it is carried out between one and ten times per year. A proper maintenance routine significantly prolongs the life-time of stainless steel.

===Tools used for maintenance===

==Recycling and reuse==

Stainless steel is 100% recyclable. An average stainless steel object is composed of about 60% recycled material of which approximately 40% originates from end-of-life products and about 60% comes from manufacturing processes. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the per capita stock of stainless steel in use in society is 80–180 kg in more developed countries and 15 kg in less-developed countries.
There is a secondary market that recycles usable scrap for many stainless steel markets. The product is mostly coil, sheet and blanks. This material is purchased at a less-than-prime price and sold to commercial quality stampers and sheet metal houses. The material may have scratches, pits and dents but is made to the current specifications.

==Types of stainless steel==

There are different types of stainless steels: when nickel is added, for instance, the austenite structure of iron is stabilized. This crystal structure makes such steels virtually non-magnetic and less brittle at low temperatures. For greater hardness and strength, more carbon is added. With proper heat treatment, these steels are used for such products as razor blades, cutlery, and tools.
Significant quantities of manganese have been used in many stainless steel compositions. Manganese preserves an austenitic structure in the steel, similar to nickel, but at a lower cost.
Stainless steels are also classified by their crystalline structure:

===Stainless steel grades===

There are a number of different systems for grading stainless and other steels. The article on US SAE steel grades details a large number of grades with their properties.

==Stainless steel finishes==

Standard mill finishes can be applied to flat rolled stainless steel directly by the rollers and by mechanical abrasives. Steel is first rolled to size and thickness and then annealed to change the properties of the final material. Any oxidation that forms on the surface (mill scale) is removed by pickling, and a passivation layer is created on the surface. A final finish can then be applied to achieve the desired aesthetic appearance.
