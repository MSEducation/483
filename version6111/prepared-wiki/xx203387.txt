==Family==

Born in East Stonehouse, Devon, 19 December 1847, eldest daughter of Charles Langton Massingberd of Gunby Hall and Harriet Anne Langford she married her second-cousin, Edmund Langton, in 1867 but he was to die just 12 years later. Her four children were to give the Gunby Hall estate to the National Trust. She was mother-in-law to Field Marshal Montgomery-Massingberd and to his brother General Hugh M. de Fellenberg Montgomery and was great-grandmother to Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd
It is singular that in the history of her family Mrs Massingberd was the third only daughter upon whom the estates had devolved.

==The advancement of women==

After marriage in 1867 their home was the Red House in Knyveton Road, Bournemouth. Her husband died in 1875 aged in his early 30s leaving her with a son and three daughters and Massingberd turned to temperance work with the British Women's Temperance Association. When her father died in 1887 she succeeded to Gunby Hall and resumed her maiden name by royal licence. For the next four years she managed the estate herself then moved to London.Mark Clement, ‘Massingberd, Emily Caroline Langton (1847–1897)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography , Oxford University Press, 2004
In London she involved herself in the temperance, anti-vivisectionist and women's movements. She was an enthusiastic supporter of women's suffrage, she had made her first speech in favour of it at Westminster Town Hall in 1882. Becoming a vice president of the United Kingdom Alliance, a Manchester based temperance movement, she was also honorary treasurer to  Lady Henry Somerset's Cottage Homes for Inebriates, a farm colony for women at Duxhurst, just south of Reigate.

==The Pioneer Club==

Massingberd founded this club in 1892 to provide middle-class women, in particular unmarried women, with a place to socialise outside their homes, "a place where women gathered to meet each other, to help each other and to discuss the leading questions and principal progressive work of the day". It was to remain active until 1939.
It was the only British club to be affiliated to the General Federation of Women's Clubs.
By 1895 it had more than 300 members (by 1899 more than 600), stressed the unimportance of social position, provided members and their guests with meals and on Thursday evenings organised lectures, debates and discussion on social political and literary themes. Speakers included Bernard Shaw, Millicent Fawcett, Mrs Pearsall Smith, Lady Henry Somerset and Frances Willard. Men might be invited by members on Wednesday evenings.David Doughan, ‘Pioneer Club (act. 1892–1939)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press
She underwent a serious operation at Llandudno but a few weeks later died on 28 January 1897 a month into her 50th year.
Her birth surname was Massingberd, her married surname Langton. She re-assumed the surname Massingberd by royal licence 20 May 1887.
