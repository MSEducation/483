==Football career==

Born in Ourém, Santarém, Laranjeiro started his career at União Desportiva de Leiria in 2001–02, becoming a first-team regular two seasons later, with the team always in the first division.
In the 2007–08 campaign he scored two goals from the penalty spot in the UEFA Intertoto Cup match against FK Hajduk Kula, as his side made it to the UEFA Cup on a 4–2 aggregate (1–0 defeat, 4–1 home win).
In August 2008, upon Leiria's relegation, Laranjeiro joined another top flight struggler, Matosinhos' Leixões SC, starting most of his debut season as the club finished sixth. After only eight second level games in 2010–11, he left the club and signed for C.D. Fátima in division three.
