==Plot==

Donald "Sully" Sullivan is something of an oddball in the peaceful and snowy New York village of North Bath. He free-lances in the construction business, usually with his dim-witted young friend Rub by his side, and is often at odds with Carl Roebuck, a local businessman, flirting with Carl's wife Toby openly at every opportunity.
Sully is a tenant in the home of Miss Beryl, whose banker son strongly urges her to kick the boarder out. Family complications of his own develop for Sully with a visit from Peter, his estranged son. While they reconstruct their relationship, Sully strikes up a new one with his young grandson Will.
Jailed for punching a police officer named Raymer who has been persecuting him, Sully's luck seems to be all bad. But in turn his son and grandson warm up to him, his fortune takes a turn for the better and even the lovely Toby expresses a willingness to leave Carl and run away with him. At the end of the film, Sully is pretty much back where he began, boarding at Miss Beryl's, but this time the picture of contentment.
