==History==

Prior to the construction of Green Oak Village Place, the only shopping mall in Brighton was Brighton Mall, a 20-store complex originally anchored by A&P and Grant City, which was demolished in 1996 for big box stores, including Marshalls and Best Buy.
Following the construction of several new homes in the area, as well as increase in traffic along US-23 and Interstate 96,[tpl]cite news |title=Mall rises in Green Oak Twp. |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=2005-10-06 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DTNB&s_site=detnews&f_site=detnews&f_sitename=Detroit+News%2C+The+%28MI%29&p_multi=DTNB&p_theme=gannett&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10D1A5BDCCA02D80&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM[/tpl] plans were made in 2004 to build a new lifestyle center called Green Oak Village Place at the interchange of U.S. 23 and Lee Road southeast of town. A small shopping center featuring Costco and Kohl's had already been built at the southwestern quadrant of this interchange.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-29776139_ITM|title=Brendel Hightower column|last=Hightower|first=Brendel|date=2007-01-27|work=The Detroit Free Press|accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl] In December 2004, a preliminary approval was granted to build the center, which was developed by Lormax Stern in association with REDICO and Quadrants, Inc. The city's officials formed a task force to determine the impact that the mall would have on the city's downtown business district. Construction began in June 2005, ahead of schedule.[tpl]cite news |title=New Green Oak mall is ahead of schedule |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=2005-07-20 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DTNB&s_site=detnews&f_site=detnews&f_sitename=Detroit+News%2C+The+%28MI%29&p_multi=DTNB&p_theme=gannett&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10B7EF3FB524EB60&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM[/tpl] At the same time, the Lee Road interchange with U.S. 23 was rebuilt to include three roundabouts,[tpl]cite news |title=Major Shopping Center Project Begins |work=Alacra Store |date=2005-08-20 |url=http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/rbi/MCB082005_5[/tpl] leading one local resident to create a board game based on the roundabouts.[tpl]cite news |title=Roundabouts weren't quite fun enough: Frustrated motorists can now play game at home |author=Valerie Olander |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=2007-04-16 |quote=Tom Breningstall heard so many stories of exasperation since the roundabouts opened last fall near the newly opened Green Oak Village Place mall, he designed a board game, which he says is equally frustrating. |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DTNB&s_site=detnews&f_site=detnews&f_sitename=Detroit+News%2C+The+%28MI%29&p_multi=DTNB&p_theme=gannett&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=11892C5ED88DF320&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM[/tpl]
