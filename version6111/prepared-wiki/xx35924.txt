==Early history==

The abbey was founded in 1147 when the stone buildingsOne of the most valuable assets of Roche Abbey was the extraordinary quarry controlled by the Abbey itself. The stone quarried there was so sought-after that it was used in the "groined roof of King's College chapel, Cambridge," according to Samuel Lewis in his 1848 A Topographical Dictionary of England.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=51130 were raised on the north side of the beck. The co-founders of Roche were Richard de Busli, likely the great-nephewMiscellanea Genealogica Et Heraldica: Fourth Series, W.

[/ref] When the monks first arrived in South Yorkshire from Newminster Abbey in Northumberland, they chose the most suitable side of the stream that runs through the valley, on which to build their new Cistercian monastery.  Twenty-five years later, at the end of the century, the Norman Gothic great church had been finished, as well as most of the other buildings.  The control of the abbey was vested in the de Vesci family, lords of Rotherham, who in turn subfeuded the land to Richard FitzTurgis, lord of Wickersley (and who took Wickersley as his surname).Family of FitzTurgis, later Wickersley, Rotherhamgov.uk
From the start, the Abbey of Roche, built for the so-called White Monks, as the Cistercians were known, had an almost otherworldly air. It was, after all, built at the northern end of an area once covered by Sherwood Forest, and it was said that Robin Hood went to Mass here.

Eventually, on co-founder FitzTurgis'One of the earliest appearances of the FitzTurgis name is on a York charter of 1194 which refers to "Turgis, son of Turgis.' http://books.google.com/books?id=ZwUwAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA362&dq=fitzturgis&ei=LIYeSeqzFZWEkAT77fHEDw#PPA362,M1 The name Turgis is Norman and its origin is the Old Norse Þórgísl (Thorgisl "hostage of Thor"). The name FitzTurgis means, when translated, son of (fils de in French) Turgis (still common as a Norman surname nowadays Turgis http://www.geopatronyme.com/cgi-bin/carte/nomcarte.cgi?numero=0054263&periode=1 and Tourgis http://www.geopatronyme.com/cgi-bin/carte/nomcarte.cgi?numero=0255691&periode=1, and in place-names such as Tourgéville (Calvados). Both FitzTurgis and de Busli have been described by one historian as 'two members of the lesser baronage'. The name FitzTurgis was later Anglicised to Sturgis / Sturges and its variants. death, control of the abbey passed to his son Roger, now 'de Wickersley,'de Wickersley of Broomhall and Wickersley, wickersleyweb.co.uk and then eventually to a granddaughter Constantia, who married William de Livet (Levett), a family of Norman origin who were lords of the nearby village of Hooton Levitt (or Levett).[ref]
