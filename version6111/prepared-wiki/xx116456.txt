CATEGORIES: Beaches of Greece, Zakynthos

Navagio Beach (Greek: Ναυάγιο), or the Shipwreck, is an exposed cove, often referred to as 'Smugglers Cove', on the coast of Zakynthos, in the Ionian Islands of Greece and is the location of the wreck of the alleged smuggler ship Panagiotis. It derives the name "Shipwreck" from a boat that wrecked in 1983 in the cove while transporting cigarettes.[tpl]cite web|title=Navagio or Shipwreck beach|url=http://www.greeka.com/ionian/zakynthos/zakynthos-beaches/zakynthos-navagio_or_shipwreck.htm|work=Navagio or Shipwreck beach|publisher=Greek.com|accessdate=28 March 2014[/tpl] 

==Location & Tourism==

Navagio is located on the north-west shore of the Ionian island of Zakynthos (Zante), in the Municipality of Elation. The area is defined by its sheer limestone cliffs, white sand beaches, and clear blue water, which attract thousands of tourists yearly. The strip of beach is accessed only by boat, from Porto Vromi to the south, and from the Harbor of Saint Nikolas in Volimes to the north-east. More typically, boats arrive from the harbor of Zakynthos, the capital city, with cruises and tours anchoring hourly at Navagio.
