==Life and career==

===Early years and education===

Born Billy Don Moyers in Hugo in Choctaw County in southeastern Oklahoma, he was the son of John Henry Moyers, a laborer, and Ruby Johnson Moyers. Moyers was reared in Texas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/moyesrbill/moyersbill.htm|title=Bill Moyers|accessdate=May 15, 2008|publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080517085456/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/moyesrbill/moyersbill.htm|archivedate=May 17, 2008 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
He began his journalism career at sixteen as a cub reporter at the Marshall News Messenger in Marshall in East Texas. In college, he studied journalism at the North Texas State College in Denton, Texas. In 1954, then-U.S. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson employed him as a summer intern and eventually promoted him to manage Johnson's personal mail. Soon after, Moyers transferred to the University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, where he wrote for The Daily Texan newspaper. In 1956, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism. While in Austin, Moyers served as assistant news editor for KTBC radio and television stations—owned by Lady Bird Johnson, wife of then-Senator Johnson. During the academic year 1956–1957, he studied issues of church and state at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland as a Rotary International Fellow. In 1959, he completed a Master of Divinity degree at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. Moyers served as Director of Information while attending SWBTS. He was also a Baptist pastor in Weir in Williamson County near Austin.
Moyers was ordained in 1954. Moyers planned to enter a Doctor of Philosophy program in American Studies at the University of Texas. During Senator Johnson's unsuccessful bid for the 1960 Democratic U.S. presidential nomination, Moyers served as a top aide, and in the general campaign he acted as liaison between Democratic vice-presidential candidate Johnson and the Democratic presidential nominee, U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy.[tpl]cite web|title=Bill Moyers Biographical Note|publisher=LBJ Library and Museum|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/holdings/Findingaids/Aides/Moyers/MoyersBio.asp|accessdate=June 7, 2007[/tpl]

===Kennedy and Johnson administrations===

During the Kennedy Administration, Moyers was first appointed as associate director of public affairs for the newly created Peace Corps in 1961. He served as Deputy Director from 1962 to 1963.  When Lyndon B. Johnson took office after the Kennedy assassination, Moyers became a special assistant to Johnson, serving from 1963 to 1967. He played a key role in organizing and supervising the 1964 Great Society legislative task forces and was a principal architect of Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign. Moyers acted as the President's informal chief of staff from October 1964 until 1966. From July 1965 to February 1967, he also served as White House press secretary.
After the resignation of White House Chief of Staff Walter Jenkins because of a sexual misdemeanor in the run up to the 1964 election, President Lyndon B. Johnson, alarmed that the opposition was framing the issue as a security breach,[tpl]cite book|title=The Lavender Scare|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gbfOrkS5ziAC&pg=PA19 7|last=Johnson|first=David K.|year=2004|pages=197pp|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-40481-1[/tpl] ordered Moyers to request FBI name checks on 15 members of Goldwater's staff to find "derogatory" material on their personal lives.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/vol6/html/ChurchV6_0275a.htm|title=US Dept Justice FBI Investigation 1975|accessdate=May 10, 2008|publisher=USDOJ|year=1975[/tpl]Hoover's men ran name checks on 15 of them, producing derogatory information on two (a traffic violation on one and a love affair on another) "Hoover's Political Spying for Presidents, TIME, 1975" Goldwater himself only referred to the Jenkins incident off the record.[tpl]cite book|title=Lyndon B.

""Hoover's Institution," The Wall Street Journal, 2005" Moyers responded that Silberman's account of the conversation was at odds with his. "Removing J.

Journalist Morley Safer in his 1990 book "Flashbacks" wrote that Moyers and President Johnson met with and "harangued" Safer's boss, CBS president Frank Stanton, about Safer's coverage of the Marines torching Cam Ne village in the Vietnam War.[tpl]cite book|title=The U.S. Government and the Vietnam War: Executive and Legislative Roles and Relationships|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W3fy6AABBXsC&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69|last=Gibbons|first=William Conrad|year=1995|pages=69pp|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-00635-0[/tpl]
During the meeting, Safer alleges, Johnson threatened to expose Safer's "communist ties". This was a bluff, according to Safer. Safer says that Moyers was "if not a key player, certainly a key bystander" in the incident.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/12151-1/Morley+Safer.aspx|title=Booknotes: Flashbacks On Returning to Vietnam|publisher=booknotes.org|accessdate=February 28, 2009|quote=And Moyers was present during some of this showdown stuff about me being a Communist, clearly knew it was a bluff.

In The New York Times on April 3, 1966, Moyers offered this insight on his stint as press secretary to President Johnson: "I work for him despite his faults and he lets me work for him despite my deficiencies."[tpl]cite news|last=Anderson|first=Patrick|title=No. 2 Texan in the White House|pages=SM1|work=The New York Times|date=April 3, 1966|url=http://select.nytimes.com /gst/abstract.html?res=F10F16FE3A5411708DDDAA0894DC405B868AF1D3 [/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Simpson|first=James B.|title=Simpson's Contemporary Quotations, No. 848|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1988|url=http://www.bartleby.com/63/48/848.html|isbn=0-395-43085-2 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] On October 17, 1967, he told an audience in Cambridge that Johnson saw the war in Vietnam as his major legacy and, as a result, was insisting on victory at all costs, even in the face of public opposition. Moyers felt such a continuation of the conflict would tear the country apart. "I never thought the situation could arise when I would wish for the defeat of LBJ, and that makes my current state of mind all the more painful to me," he told them. "I would have to say now: It would depend on who his opponent is."Daniel Ellsberg, Secrets, 197f

Among their first productions was the popular PBS 1988 documentary series Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth, consisting of six one-hour interviews between Moyers and mythologist Joseph Campbell. The documentary covers Campbell's exploration of the monomyth and the hero cycle, or the story of the hero, as it manifests itself in various cultures. Campbell's influence is clearly seen in the work of George Lucas's Star Wars saga. In the first interview, filmed at George Lucas' "Skywalker Ranch",[tpl]cite web|title=The Hero's Adventure|publisher=TV.com|url=http://www.tv.com/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth/the-heros-adventure/episode/432756/summary.html|accessdate=June 7, 2007 [/tpl] Moyers and Campbell discuss the relationship between Campbell's theories and Lucas's creative work.

It considered U.S. foreign policy and militarism historically and recently, centering on the Iran–Contra affair. It was harshly rebuked by conservatives and continuing into the 1990s was used by Republicans as a reason to threaten the funding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and PBS.

====In Search of the Constitution====

Also in 1987 Moyers produced a 11-part mini-series documentary celebrating the bicentennial of the signing of the U.S. Constitution and critically analyzing the state of affairs of the present and the intervening 200 years. Four episodes of In Search of the Constitution were interviews of sitting Supreme Court justices and the remainder contained discussions with prominent scholars.

====A World of Ideas====

In 1988, Moyers produced an interview series, featuring writers, artists, philosophers, scientists, and historians, whom he had become acquainted with. The series broke new ground for national television by bringing thoughtful, intelligent, provocative, and noteworthy people to the screen, most of whom had little prior exposure in the mass media.Reviews/Television; Bill Moyers Examines Public Issues The series was revived in 1990.A World of Ideas (1988, 1990) Moyers published companion books for both the first series [tpl]Cite isbn | 0385262787 [/tpl] and the second.[tpl]Cite isbn | 0385416652 [/tpl]

==Commentary==

===Regarding the U.S. media===

====On the media and class warfare====

In a 2003 interview with BuzzFlash.com,[tpl]cite news|title=Bill Moyers is Insightful, Erudite, Impassioned, Brilliant and the Host of PBS' "NOW"|url=http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/03/10/int03281.html|work=interview|publisher=BuzzFlash.com|date=October 28, 2003|accessdate=December 18, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061206125054/http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/03/10/int03281.html|archivedate=December 6, 2006 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
Moyers said, "The corporate right and the political right declared class warfare on working people a quarter of a century ago and they've won." He noted, "The rich are getting richer, which arguably wouldn't matter if the rising tide lifted all boats." Instead, however, "the inequality gap is the widest it's been since 1929; the middle class is besieged and the working poor are barely keeping their heads above water." He added that as "the corporate and governing elites are helping themselves to the spoils of victory," access to political power has become "who gets what and who pays for it."
Meanwhile, the public has failed to react because it is, in his words, "distracted by the media circus and news has been neutered or politicized for partisan purposes." In support of this, he referred to "the paradox of Rush Limbaugh, ensconced in a Palm Beach mansion massaging the resentments across the country of white-knuckled wage earners, who are barely making ends meet in no small part because of the corporate and ideological forces for whom Rush has been a hero. ... As Eric Alterman reports in his recent book—a book that I'm proud to have helped make happen—part of the red meat strategy is to attack mainstream media relentlessly, knowing that if the press is effectively intimidated, either by the accusation of liberal bias or by a reporter's own mistaken belief in the charge's validity, the institutions that conservatives revere—corporate America, the military, organized religion, and their own ideological bastions of influence—will be able to escape scrutiny and increase their influence over American public life with relatively no challenge."

====On media bias====

When he retired in December 2004, the AP News Service quoted Moyers as saying, "I'm going out telling the story that I think is the biggest story of our time: how the right-wing media has become a partisan propaganda arm of the Republican National Committee. We have an ideological press that's interested in the election of Republicans, and a mainstream press that's interested in the bottom line. Therefore, we don't have a vigilant, independent press whose interest is the American people."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.commondreams.org/cgi-bin/print.cgi?file=/headlines04/1210-11.htm|title=Bill Moyers Retiring From TV Journalism|accessdate=July 25, 2007|agency=Associated Press|year=2004|author=Frazier Moore|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070612003856/http://www.commondreams.org/cgi-bin/print.cgi?file=/headlines04/1210-11.htm|archivedate=June 12, 2007 |deadurl=no[/tpl]

===On Karl Rove and U.S. politics===

On June 4, 2003, Moyers gave a speech at the "Take Back America" conference. In it, Moyers defined what he considered  Karl Rove's influence on George W. Bush's administration. Moyers asserted that, from his reading of Rove, the mid-to-late 19th century was to Rove a "cherished period of American history." He further stated, "From his own public comments and my reading of the record, it is apparent that Karl Rove has modeled the Bush presidency on that of William McKinley ... and modeled himself on Mark Hanna, the man who virtually manufactured McKinley",[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tdnF1xuMfAIC&pg=PA17|title=Everyday politics: reconnecting citizens and the public life|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|accessdate=February 15, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0610-11.htm|title=This is Your Story – The Progressive Story of America.

Furthermore, Moyers indicated that Hanna gathered support for McKinley's presidential campaign from "the corporate interests of the day" and was responsible for Ohio and Washington coming under the rule of "bankers, railroads and public utility corporations." He submitted that political opponents of this transfer of power were "smeared as disturbers of the peace, socialists, anarchists, or worse."
Moyers also referred to what historian Clinton Rossiter called the period of "the great train robbery of American intellectual history," when "conservatives—or better, pro-corporate apologists" began using terms such as progress, opportunity, and individualism to make "...the plunder of America sound like divine right." He added that Charles Darwin's theory of evolution was also used by conservative politicians, judges, and publicists to justify the idea of a "natural order of things" as well as "the notion that progress resulted from the elimination of the weak and the 'survival of the fittest.'"[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5244/is_200306/ai_n20785379/|title=Moyers' accusation – Washington Times|publisher=findarticles.com|accessdate=February 15, 2010 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
He concludes, "This 'degenerate and unlovely age', as one historian calls it, exists in the mind of Karl Rove, the reputed brain of George W. Bush, as the seminal age of inspiration for the politics and governance of America today."

==Allegations of bias==

Bush-appointee Corporation for Public Broadcasting chairman Kenneth Tomlinson was a regular critic of Moyers; in 2003, he wrote to Pat Mitchell, the president of PBS, that "with Bill Moyers does not contain anything approaching the balance the law requires for public broadcasting."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/media/jan-june05/cpb_6-21.html|title=Public Broadcasting Under Fire|date=June 21, 2005|work=NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|publisher=PBS|accessdate=February 14, 2010[/tpl] In 2005, Tomlinson commissioned a study of the show, without informing or getting authorization from the CPB board.Stephen Labaton, New York Times, "Ex-Chairman of Public Broadcasting Violated Laws, Inquiry Suggests", November 16, 2005. Tomlinson said that the study supported what he characterized as "the image of the left-wing bias of NOW".[tpl]cite web|last=Bode|first=Ken A.|title=CPB Ombudsmen Reports: The Question Of "Balance"|date=September 1, 2005|url=http://www.cpb.org/ombudsmen/display.php?id=6|accessdate=June 17, 2010 [/tpl] George Neumayr, the executive editor of The American Spectator, a conservative magazine, told the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'' that "PBS looks like a liberal monopoly to me, and Bill Moyers is Exhibit A of that very strident left-wing bias... Moyers uses his show as a platform from which to attack conservatives and Republicans."
Moyers, who left the show in 2004 before returning in 2007, replied to this by saying that his journalism showed "the actual experience of regular people is the missing link in a nation wired for everything but the truth." Moyers characterized Tomlinson as "an ally of Karl Rove and the right-wing monopoly's point man to keep tabs on public broadcasting." Tomlinson, he said, "found kindred spirits at the right-wing editorial board of The Wall Street Journal where the 'animal spirits of business' are routinely celebrated." Moyers also responded to these accusations in a speech given to The National Conference for Media Reform, saying that he had repeatedly invited Tomlinson to debate him on the subject but had repeatedly been ignored.[tpl]cite web|last=Moyers|first=Bill|title=Bill Moyers' speech to the National Conference for Media Reform|publisher=FreePress.net|date=May 15, 2005|url=http://www.freepress.net/news/8120|accessdate=June 9, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070704160613/http://www.freepress.net/news/8120|archivedate=July 4, 2007 |deadurl=no[/tpl] He spoke about this again a few months later in a speech called "Democracy, Secrecy and Ideology" upon the 20th anniversary of the National Security Archive.[tpl]cite web|last=Moyers|first=Bill|title=Bill Moyers' speech on the National Security Archive|date=December 9, 2005|url=http://billmoyers.com/2005/12/09/democracy-secrecy-and-ideology-december-9-2005/|accessdate=August 11, 2012[/tpl]

Moyers married Judith Suzanne Davidson (a producer) on December 18, 1954. They have three children and five grandchildren. His son William Cope Moyers (CNN producer, Hazelden Foundation spokesman) struggled to overcome alcoholism as detailed in the book Broken: My Story of Addiction and Redemption. He includes letters from Bill Moyers in his book, which he says are "a testament to a father's love for his son, a father's confusion with his son, and ultimately, a father's satisfaction with his son."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hazelden.org/web/public/ade60904.page|title=Moyers's memoir serves as a voice for recovery|accessdate=May 15, 2008[/tpl] His other son, John Moyers, assisted in the foundation of TomPaine.com, "an online public affairs journal of progressive analysis and commentary."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tompaine.com/about/|title=TomPaine.common sense: About Us|accessdate=July 15, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100710130118/http://www.tompaine.com/about/|archivedate=July 10, 2010 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
