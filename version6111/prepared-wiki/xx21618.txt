The United States Secret Service (USSS) is an American federal law enforcement agency that is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/RL34603.pdf|title=The U.S. Secret Service: An Examination and Analysis of Its Evolving Missions|last=Resse|first=Shawn|date=2012-04-16|accessdate=2012-04-18|publisher=Congressional Research Service[/tpl] The sworn members are divided among the Special Agents and the Uniformed Division. Until March 1, 2003, the Service was part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/history.shtml|title=Secret Service History|accessdate=2008-03-09|publisher=United States Secret Service[/tpl]
The U.S. Secret Service has two distinct areas of responsibility:
The Secret Service's initial responsibility was to investigate counterfeiting of U.S. currency, which was rampant following the U.S. Civil War. The agency then evolved into the United States' first domestic intelligence and counterintelligence agency. Many of the agency's missions were later taken over by subsequent agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

==Dual Mission==

The Secret Service has  two primary missions, investigation of financial crimes and physical protection of designated protectees.  Today the agency's primary investigative mission is to safeguard the payment and financial systems of the United States. These include crimes that involve financial institution fraud, computer and telecommunications fraud, false identification documents, access device fraud, advance fee fraud, electronic funds transfers and money laundering as it relates to the agency's core violations. After the 1901 assassination of President William McKinley, Congress also directed the Secret Service to protect the President of the United States. Protection remains the other key mission of the United States Secret Service.
Today, the Secret Service is authorized by law to protect:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00003056----000-.html|title=United States Code: Title 18, Section 3056[/tpl]
Any of these individuals may decline Secret Service protection, except the President, the Vice President (or other officer next in the order of succession to the Office of President), the President-elect, and the Vice President–elect.
When Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State in 2009, the Secret Service continued to protect her at home; however the Diplomatic Security Service protected her while she was performing her duties as the Secretary of State, including foreign travel.
The Secret Service investigates thousands of incidents a year of individuals threatening the President of the United States.
The Director of Secret Service is appointed by the President of the United States.

==History==

===Early years===

With a reported one third of the currency in circulation being counterfeit at the time,[tpl]cite web|url=http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/kids/inside/html/spring98-2.html|title=The United States Secret Service|publisher=Clinton2.nara.gov|date=1922-07-01|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl] the Secret Service was created on July 5, 1865 in Washington, D.C., to suppress counterfeit currency. Chief William P. Wood was sworn in by Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch. It was commissioned in Washington, D.C. as the "Secret Service Division" of the Department of the Treasury with the mission of suppressing counterfeiting. The legislation creating the agency was on Abraham Lincoln's desk the night he was assassinated.[tpl]cite book|last=Petro|first=Joeseph|author2=Jeffrey Robinson|title=Standing Next to History, An Agent's Life Inside the Secret Service|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|year=2005|page=16|isbn=978-0-312-33221-1[/tpl] At the time, the only other federal law enforcement agencies were the United States Park Police, the U.S. Post Office Department's Office of Instructions and Mail Depredations (now known as the United States Postal Inspection Service), and the U.S. Marshals Service. The Marshals did not have the manpower to investigate all crime under federal jurisdiction, so the Secret Service began to investigate everything from murder to bank robbery to illegal gambling. After the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901, Congress informally requested that the Secret Service provide presidential protection. A year later, the Secret Service assumed full-time responsibility for presidential protection. In 1902, William Craig became the first Secret Service agent to die while serving, in a road accident while riding in the presidential carriage.
The Secret Service was the first U.S. domestic intelligence and counterintelligence agency. Domestic intelligence collection and counterintelligence responsibilities were vested in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) after the FBI's creation in 1908. The Secret Service assisted in arresting Japanese American leaders and in the Japanese American internment during World War II.11 Asian L.J. 147 (2004), Foreword: Sixty Years after the Internment: Civil Rights, Identity Politics, and Racial Profiling; Tamaki, Donald K. The U.S. Secret Service is not an official part of the U.S. Intelligence Community.Intelligence.gov

===Truman assassination attempt===

In 1950, President Harry S. Truman was residing in Blair House while the White House, across the street, was undergoing renovations. On November 1, 1950, two Puerto Rican nationalists, Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola, approached Blair House with the intent to assassinate President Truman. Collazo and Torresola opened fire on Private Leslie Coffelt and other White House Police officers. Though mortally wounded by three shots from a 9 mm Walther P38 to his chest and abdomen, Private Coffelt returned fire, killing Torresola with a single shot to his head. [tpl]As of|2012[/tpl], Coffelt is the only member of the Secret Service to be killed while protecting a US president against an assassination attempt (Special Agent Tim McCarthy stepped in front of President Ronald Reagan during the assassination attempt of March 30, 1981, and took a bullet to the abdomen but made a full recovery). Collazo was also shot, but survived his injuries and served 29 years in prison before returning to Puerto Rico in late 1979.

===1960s===

In 1968, as a result of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination, Congress authorized protection of major presidential and vice presidential candidates and nominees.[tpl]USPL|90|331[/tpl] In 1965 and 1968, Congress also authorized lifetime protection of the spouses of deceased presidents unless they remarry and of the children of former presidents until age 16.

===1980s and 90s===

The Secret Service Presidential Protective Division safeguards the President of the United States and his immediate family. They work with other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies and the military to safeguard the President when he travels in Air Force One, Marine One, and by limousine in motorcades.
Although the most visible role of the Secret Service today, personal protection is an anomaly in the responsibilities of an agency focused on fraud and counterfeiting.
In 1984 the US Congress passed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, which extended the Secret Service's jurisdiction over credit card fraud and computer fraud.
In 1990 the Secret Service initiated Operation Sundevil, originally intended to be a sting against malicious hackers, allegedly responsible for disrupting telephone services across all the USA. The operation, which was later described by Bruce Sterling in his book The Hacker Crackdown, affected a great number of people unrelated to hacking, and led to no convictions. The Secret Service, however, was sued and required to pay damages.
In 1994 and 1995, it ran an undercover sting called Operation Cybersnare.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ctia.org/media/press/body.cfm/prid/1|title=Wireless Industry Salutes U.S. Secret Service|publisher=Ctia.org|date=1995-09-11|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl]
The Secret Service investigates forgery of government checks, forgery of currency equivalents (such as travelers' or cashiers' checks), and certain instances of wire fraud (such as the so-called Nigerian scam) and credit card fraud. The reason for this combination of duties is that when the need for presidential protection became apparent in the early 20th century, few federal services had the necessary abilities and resources. The FBI, IRS, ATF, ICE, and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) did not yet exist. The United States Marshals Service was the only other logical choice, providing protection for the President on a number of occasions.
The Secret Service has concurrent jurisdiction with the FBI over certain violations of federal computer crime laws. They have created 24 Electronic Crimes Task Forces (ECTFs) across the United States. These task forces are partnerships between the Service, federal/state and local law enforcement, the private sector and academia aimed at combating technology-based crimes.
In 1998, President Bill Clinton signed Presidential Decision Directive 62, which established National Special Security Events (NSSE). That directive made the Secret Service responsible for security at designated events.

===September 11, 2001, attacks===

The New York City Field office was located at 7 World Trade Center. Immediately after the September 11 attacks, Special Agents and other New York Field office employees were among the first to respond with first aid. Sixty-seven Special Agents in New York City, at and near the New York Field Office, helped to set up triage areas and evacuate the towers. One Secret Service employee, Master Special Officer Craig Miller,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/15843-master-special-officer-craig-j-miller |title=Master Special Officer Craig J. Miller |website=ODMP.org |publisher=The Officer Down Memorial Page, Inc. |accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] died during the rescue efforts. On August 20, 2002, Director Brian L. Stafford awarded the Director's Valor Award to employees who assisted in the rescue attempts.[tpl]cite book|title=In the President's Secret Service: Behind the Scenes with Agents in the Line of Fire and the Presidents They Protect|last=Kessler|first=Ronald|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Q2fhPjTJutgC[/tpl]
Effective March 1, 2003, the Secret Service transferred from the Treasury to the newly established Department of Homeland Security.

===Domestic Expansion===

The USA Patriot Act, signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001, mandated the U.S. Secret Service to establish a nationwide network of Electronic Crimes Task Forces (ECTFs) to investigate and prevent attacks on financial and critical infrastructures in the United States. As such, this mandate expanded on the agency's first ECTF—the New York Electronic Crimes Task Force, formed in 1995—which brought together federal, state and local law enforcement, prosecutors, private-industry companies, and academia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/ectf.shtml|title=United States Secret Service: Electronic Crimes Task Forces and Working Groups|publisher=Secretservice.gov|date=2001-10-26|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/ectf_about.shtml|title=About the U.S. Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Forces|publisher=Secretservice.gov|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl]
The network prioritizes investigations that meet the following criteria:
Currently, the network includes ECTFs in the following 28 U.S. cities:

===International Expansion===

On July 6, 2009, the U.S. Secret Service expanded its fight on cyber-crime by creating the first European Electronic Crimes Task Force, based on the successful U.S. domestic model, through a memorandum of understanding with Italian police and postal officials. Over a year later, on August 9, 2010, the agency expanded its European involvement by creating its second overseas ECTF in the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/press/GPA05-09_EuropeanECTF.pdf|title=United States Secret Service Signs Partnership Agreement With Italian Officials Establishing the First European Electronic Crimes Task Force|format=PDF|date=July 6, 2009|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl][tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/press/GPA06-10_LondonECTF.pdf|title=United States Secret Service Signs Partnership Agreement With United Kingdom Officials Establishing the Second European Electronic Crimes Task Force|format=PDF|date=August 9, 2010|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl]
Both task forces are said to concentrate on a wide range of "computer-based criminal activity," including:
Currently, the overseas network includes ECTFs in the following European cities:

===Today===

As of 2010, the Service has over 6,500 employees: 3,200 Special Agents, 1,300 Uniformed Division Officers, and 2,000 technical and administrative employees.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/faq.shtml#faq8|title=United States Secret Service: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=SecretService.gov|date=1997-01-01|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl] Special agents serve on protective details, special teams or sometimes investigate certain financial and homeland security-related crimes.

==Uniformed Division==

The Uniformed Division is similar to the United States Capitol Police and is in charge of protecting the physical White House grounds and foreign diplomatic missions in the Washington, D.C. area. Established in 1922 as the White House Police, this organization was fully integrated into the Secret Service in 1930.  In 1970, the role of the force, then called the Executive Protective Service, was expanded. The name United States Secret Service Uniformed Division was adopted in 1977.
With more than 1,300 officers as of 2010, the Uniformed Division is responsible for security at the White House Complex; the vice president's residence; the Department of the Treasury (as part of the White House Complex); and foreign diplomatic missions in the Washington, D.C., area. Uniformed Division officers carry out their protective responsibilities through a network of fixed security posts, foot, bicycle, vehicular and motorcycle patrols
The Uniformed Division has three branches: the White House Branch, the Foreign Missions Branch, and the Naval Observatory Branch. Together they provide protection for the following: the president, vice president, and their immediate families; presidential candidates; the White House Complex; the Vice President's Residence; the main Treasury Department building and its annex facility; and foreign diplomatic missions in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/whoweare_ud.shtml|title=Uniformed Division|publisher=US Secret Service|accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl]
Officers are responsible for providing additional support to the Secret Service's protective mission through the following special support groups:
The Counter Sniper Team CS): Created in 1971, the CS's purpose is to provide specialized protective support to defend against long-range threats to Secret Service protectees.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/whoweare_ud.shtml|title=United States Secret Service: Uniformed Division|publisher=Secretservice.gov|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl]
The Canine Explosives Detection Unit (K-9): Created in 1976, the mission of the K-9 unit is to provide skilled and specialized explosives detection support to protective efforts involving Secret Service protectees.
The Emergency Response Team (ERT): Formed in 1992, ERT's primary mission is to provide tactical response to unlawful intrusions and other protective challenges related to the White House and its grounds. ERT personnel receive specialized, advanced training and must maintain a high level of physical and operational proficiency.
Officers assigned to CS, ERT, and K9, are designated "Technicians" to recognize their advanced training. Today these units are part of the agency's Special Operations Division.
The Magnetometer Support Unit: Formed to ensure that all persons entering secure areas occupied by Secret Service protectees are unarmed, the Secret Service began relying on magnetometer (metal detector) support by Uniformed Division officers to augment its protective efforts away from the White House following the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan.

==Attacks on Presidents==

Since the 1960s, Presidents John F. Kennedy (killed), Gerald Ford (twice attacked, but uninjured) and Ronald Reagan (seriously wounded) have been attacked while appearing in public.[tpl]cite web|author=Elaine Quijano|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/cWORLD/europe/05/10/bush.georgia/|title=Secret Service told grenade landed near Bush|publisher=CNN.com|date=2005-05-10|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Chilcote|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/01/11/georgia.grenade/index.html|title=Bush grenade attacker gets life|work=CNN|date=2006-01-11|accessdate=2007-01-03[/tpl] Agents on scene though not injured during attacks on Presidents include William Greer, and Roy Kellerman. One of the agents was Robert DeProspero, the Special Agent In Charge (SAIC) of Reagan's Presidential Protective Division (PPD) from January 1982 to April 1985. DeProspero was deputy to Jerry Parr, the SAIC of PPD during the Reagan assassination attempt on March 30, 1981.[tpl]cite book|last=Petro|first=Joeseph|author2=Jeffrey Robinson|title=Standing Next to History, An Agent's Life Inside the Secret Service|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|year=2005|pages=140–141 & 202–204|isbn=978-0-312-33221-1[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://alumni.wvu.edu/awards/academy/1995/robert_deprospero/ |title=Robert L.

The Kennedy assassination spotlighted the bravery of two Secret Service agents. First, an agent protecting Mrs. Kennedy, Clint Hill, was riding in the car directly behind the presidential limousine only when the attack began. While the shooting continued, Hill leapt from the running board of the car he was riding on and jumped onto the back of the President's moving car and guided Mrs. Kennedy from the trunk back into the rear seat of the car. He then shielded the President and the First Lady with his body until the car arrived at the hospital.
Rufus Youngblood was riding in the vice-presidential car. When the shots were fired, he vaulted over the front seat and threw his body over Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. That evening, Johnson called Secret Service Chief James J. Rowley and cited Youngblood's bravery.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,875362-2,00.html|title=The Transfer of Power|journal=Time|date=November 29, 1963[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Associated Press|title=Johnson Says Agent in Dallas Screened Him With His Body|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 27, 1963|page=21[/tpl] Youngblood would later recall some of this in his memoir, Twenty Years in the Secret Service.
The period following the Kennedy assassination was the most difficult in the modern history of the agency. Press reports indicated that morale among the agents was "low" for months following the assassination.[tpl]cite book|title=Twenty Years in the Secret Service|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|year=1973|first=Rufus|last=Youngblood|pages=147–149[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.assassinationresearch.com/v4n1.html|title=Survivor's Guilt: The Secret Service and the Failure to Protect the President[/tpl] The agency overhauled its procedures in the wake of the Kennedy killing. Training, which until that time had been confined largely to "on-the-job" efforts, was systematized and regularized.
The Reagan assassination attempt also highlighted the bravery of several Secret Service agents, particularly agent Tim McCarthy, who spread his stance to protect Reagan as six bullets were being fired by the would-be assassin, John Hinckley, Jr.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/06/11/earlyshow/main622527.shtml|title=He Took A Bullet For Reagan|quote='In the Secret Service,' McCarthy continued, 'we're trained to cover and evacuate the president. And to cover the president, you have to get as large as you can, rather than hitting the deck.'|date=June 11, 2004|work=CBS News[/tpl] McCarthy survived a .22-caliber round in the abdomen. For his bravery, McCarthy received the NCAA Award of Valor in 1982.[ref]
By means of the NCAA Award of Valor, the National Collegiate Athletic Association recognizes "courageous action or noteworthy bravery" by persons involved with intercollegiate athletics. McCarthy had played NCAA football at the University of Illinois.[/ref] Jerry Parr, the agent who pushed President Reagan into the limousine, and made the critical decision to divert the presidential motorcade to George Washington University Hospital instead of returning to the White House, was also honored with U.S. Congress commendations for his actions that day.Wilber, Del Quentin (2011). Rawhide Down: The Near Assassination of Ronald Reagan. Macmillan. ISBN 0-8050-9346-X. After the near-successful assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan, it was clear that the Secret Service needed to increase its efficiency to protect the President.

==Significant Investigations==

Arrest and indictment of Max Ray Butler, co-founder of the Carders Market carding website, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after his September 5, 2007 arrest, on wire fraud and identity theft charges. According to the indictment, Butler hacked over the Internet into computers at financial institutions and credit card processing centers and sold the tens of thousands of credit card numbers that he acquired in the process.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/press/GPA11-07_PITIndictment.pdf|title=Secret Service Investigation Disrupts Identity Theft Ring|format=PDF|date=September 13, 2007|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl]
Operation Firewall: In October 2004, 28 suspects—located across eight U.S. states and six countries—were arrested on charges of identity theft, computer fraud, credit-card fraud, and conspiracy. Nearly 30 national and foreign field offices of the U.S. Secret Service, including the newly established national ECTFs, and countless local enforcement agencies from around the globe, were involved in this operation. Collectively, the arrested suspects trafficked in at least 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers, which amounted to $4.3 million of losses to financial institutions. However, authorities estimated prevented loss to the industry to be in hundreds of millions of dollars. This over year-long operation, which started in July 2003, led investigators to identify three cyber-criminal groups: Shadowcrew, Carderplanet, and Darkprofits.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/press/pub2304.pdf|title=U.S. Secret Service's Operation Firewall Nets 28 Arrests|format=PDF|date=October 28, 2004|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl]
Arrest and indictment of Albert "Segvec" Gonzalez and 11 individuals—three U.S. citizens, one from Estonia, three from Ukraine, two from the People's Republic of China, one from Belarus, and one known only by an online alias—were arrested for the theft and sale of more than 40 million credit and debit card numbers from major U.S. retailers, including TJX Companies, BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21, and DSW. Gonzalez, the main organizer of the scheme, was charged with computer fraud, wire fraud, access device fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy for his leading role in the crime.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/press/GPA15-08_CyberIndictments_Final.pdf|title=Additional Indictments Announced in Ongoing Secret Service Network Intrusion Investigation|format=PDF|date=August 5, 2008|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl]

==Training and Career Progression==

At a minimum, a prospective agent must be a U.S. citizen, possess a current valid driver's license, possess visual acuity no worse than 20/60 uncorrected, correctable to 20/20 in each eye, and be between the ages of 21 and 37 at the time of appointment. However, preference eligible veterans may apply after age 37. In 2009, the Office of Personnel Management issued implementation guidance on the Isabella v. Department of State court decision: OPM Letter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chcoc.gov/Transmittals/TransmittalDetails.aspx?TransmittalID=2484|title=CHCOC.gov|publisher=CHCOC.gov|date=August 26, 2009|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl]
Special Agents receive basic training in two locations. The first phase, the Criminal Investigator Training Program (CITP) is conducted at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) at Glynco, GA. The second phase, the Special Agent Training Course (SATC) is conducted at the James J. Rowley Training Center, located in Beltsville, MD.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
A Secret Service agent's career consists of three phases.  During phase one Secret Service special agents spend their first 6 to 8 years on-the-job assigned to a field office. After their field experience, agents are usually transferred to a protective detail where they will stay for 4 to 7 years, during what is known as phase two or the protection phase. Following their protective assignment, many agents return to the field, transfer to a headquarters office, a training office, or other Washington, D.C.,-based assignment for phase three of their career. Promotions will affect the typical career path. An agent's working hours depend upon the assignment. Generally, an agent can expect to travel a lot and do a significant amount of shift work, especially during phase two. Throughout their career agents continue their training.

==Weapons and Equipment==

Since the agency's inception, a variety of weapons have been carried by its agents.

===Previous firearms===

Initially the firearms were privately procured and there was little if any standardization. In the 1930s, the USSS issued the Colt M1911A1 pistol in .45 ACP caliber. In the 1950s and 1960s, Special Agents carried the Smith & Wesson Model 36 and Colt Detective Special 38 Special revolvers.
Following President Kennedy's assassination, USSS Special Agents were authorized to carry the .357 Magnum Smith & Wesson Model 19 revolver.
Between 1981 and 1991, the Secret Service issued the Smith & Wesson Model 19 and the Smith & Wesson Model 66 .357 Magnum revolvers, with 2.5-inch barrels all the way up to the 4-inch-barreled models, loaded with hollow-point rounds.
By 1992, the standard issue weapon became the SIG Sauer P228 9mm pistol. This weapon stayed in service through 1999.
The Thompson sub-machinegun was replaced by the Uzi sub-machinegun in the 1970s. Uzi's utilized by the Secret Service have the common characteristic of slightly shorter than standard barrels. This was due to the fact that the weapons had to be modified to fit inside standard size Samsonite briefcases used to conceal them. The Uzi was phased out in the mid 1990s and replaced by the H&K MP-5. The Secret Service was the last Federal agency to use the Uzi.
The M4 carbine was utilized by agents of the Counter Assault Team from the early 1990s until 2006 when it was replaced by the SR-16.

===Current Weapons===

The current sidearm for USSS agents is the Sig Sauer P229 chambered in .357 SIG, which entered service in 1999, and also the FN Five-seven pistol.Jones, Richard D. Jane's Infantry Weapons 2009/2010. Jane's Information Group; 35th edition (January 27, 2009). ISBN 978-0-7106-2869-5. A variety of off duty, back up, and undercover weapons are also authorized.
Agents and officers are trained on standard shoulder weapons that include the FN P90 submachine gun, the 9mm Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun, and the 12 gauge Remington 870 shotgun. The continued use of the MP5 remains a source of controversy as many other federal agencies have moved away from sub-machine guns altogether and replaced them with assault rifles. Despite this, the agency has no current plans to replace this weapon.
As a less-than-lethal option, Special Agents and Uniformed Division Officers are armed with the ASP baton and officers carry OC pepper spray.
Units assigned to the Special Operations Division carry a variety of non-standard weapons.
The Counter Assault Team (CAT) and the Emergency Response Team (ERT) are both issued the 5.56mm Knight's Armament Company SR-16 CQB assault rifle. CAT also uses 12 gauge Remington 870 MCS breaching shotguns.
Uniform Division technicians assigned to the Counter Sniper (CS) team use custom built .300 Winchester Magnum bolt-action rifles referred to as JARs ("Just Another Rifle"). These rifles use Remington 700 actions in Accuracy International stocks with Schmidt & Bender optics. CS technicians also use the 7.62mm KAC SR-25/Mk11 Mod 0 semi-automatic sniper rifle with a Trijicon 5.5x ACOG optic.
The Department of Homeland Security has made numerous attempts to bring the Secret Service's weapons procurement in line with the rest of the department. The agency has resisted these inroads and currently maintains an independent acquisition process. A program to identify a replacement for the P229 is in its formative stages.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]

===Communications===

The agency uses Motorola XTS radios and surveillance kits in order to maintain communication and are known to use DES encryption keys. When operationally required military grade radios that utilize Type 1 encryption algorithms are fielded.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/sstsd-eyeball.htm|title=Eyeballing the US Secret Service Technical Security Division|publisher=Cryptome.org|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl]

===Vehicles===

When transporting the President in a motorcade, the Secret Service uses a fleet of custom built armored Cadillac Parade Limousines, the newest and largest version of which is known as "The Beast".  Armored Chevrolet Suburbans are also used when logistics require such a vehicle or when a more low profile appearance is required.  For official movement the limousine is affixed with US and presidential flags and the Presidential seal on the rear doors.  For unofficial events the vehicles are left sterile and unadorned.

===Attire===

Special Agents of the Secret Service wear attire that is appropriate for their surroundings. In most circumstances, the attire of a close protection shift is a conservative suit, but  it can range from a tuxedo to a casual clothing as required by the environment. Stereotypically Secret Service agents are often portrayed wearing reflective sunglasses and a communication earpiece. Often their attire is customized to conceal the wide array of equipment they wear while working  protection assignments.  Agents wear a distinctive lapel pin that identifies them to other agents.
The attire for Uniformed Division Officers includes standard police uniforms or utility uniforms and ballistic/identification vests for members of the countersniper team, Emergency Response Team (ERT), and canine officers. The shoulder patch of the Uniformed Division consists of the presidential seal on white or black depending on the garment to which it is attached or a lapel pin. Also, the shoulder patch is embroidered with "U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division Police" around the emblem.[tpl]cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/presidency/2b4_b.html|title=The American Presidency|publisher=Americanhistory.si.edu|date=2012-03-14|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl]
