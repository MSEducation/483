==Life==

Etel Adnan was born in 1925 in Beirut, Lebanon. "Etel Adnan: About" Retrieved 10 April 2014. Adnan's mother was a Christian Greek from Smyrna and her father was Muslim Syrian and a petty officer. Though she grew up speaking Greek and Turkish in a primarily Arabic-speaking society, she was educated at French convent schools and French became the language in which her early work was first written. "Etel Adnan: Biography" Retrieved 10 April 2014. She also studied English in her youth, and most of her later work has been first written in this language.
At twenty-four Adnan traveled to Paris where she received a degree in philosophy from the Sorbonne. She then traveled to America where she continued graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley and at Harvard University.  From 1952 to 1978, she taught philosophy of art at the Dominican University of California in San Rafael. She has also lectured at many universities throughout the United States. 
Adnan returned from America to Lebanon and worked as a journalist and cultural editor for Al-Safa, a French-language newspaper in Beirut, Lebanon. In addition, she also helped build the cultural section of the newspaper, occasionally contributing cartoons and illustrations. Her tenure at Al-Safa was most notable for her front-page editorials, commenting on the important political issues of the day.[tpl]cite book|editor1-last=Myers|editor1-first=Julian|editor2-last=Rabben|editor2-first=Heidi|title=The Ninth Page: Etel Adnan's Journalism 1972-74|publisher=CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-9849609-3-4|pages=6-8[/tpl]
Caught between languages, in her youth Adnan first found her voice through painting rather than writing. MELUS calls Adnan's life "a study in displacement and alienation." In 1996 she recalled, "Abstract art was the equivalent of poetic expression; I didn't need to use words, but colors and lines. I didn't need to belong to a language-oriented culture but to an open form of expression." She has said, "As for any serious writer, the audience of an Arab–American cannot be confined to his or her fellow Arabs. Books have a life of their own and no one can determine their fate. The only thing we can strive for consciously is to be aware of the existence of a growing body of Arab–American literature, try to know it and make it known."
