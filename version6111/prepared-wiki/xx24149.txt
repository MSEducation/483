==Career==

===Early work in New York City===

For a while, Spacek sang and played guitar in many of the Greenwich Village coffeehouses, eventually landing some paying work singing commercial jingles. In late 1968, under the pseudonym "Rainbo", Spacek recorded a novelty song titled "John, You Went Too Far This Time"; the song proclaimed her disillusionment and shock over John Lennon, who on the cover of his newest album Two Virgins (1968) appeared in full-frontal nudity with his then-girlfriend Yoko Ono, shocking many fans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9542445 |website=Biography.com| title=Biography of Sissy Spacek[/tpl] The single did not appear on the record charts and failed to sell well, so the record company dropped her.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]

===1970s and beginning of acting career===

While singing, Spacek also worked for a time as photographic model and as an extra at Andy Warhol's Factory. She appeared in a non-credited role in his film Trash (1970). With the help of Rip Torn, she enrolled in Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio and then the Lee Strasberg Institute in New York. Her first credited role was in the cult classic Prime Cut (1972), in which she played Poppy, a girl sold into sexual slavery. The role led to television work, which included a guest role in The Waltons, which she played twice in 1973. Spacek received international attention after starring in Terrence Malick's Badlands (1973), in which she played Holly, the film's narrator and a 15-year old girlfriend of mass-murderer Kit (Martin Sheen). Spacek has described Badlands as the "most incredible" experience of her career.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/entertainment/2002/oscars_2002/1802501.stm |title=Sissy Spacek's shy career|website= BBC.co.uk | date=7 February 2002[/tpl] On the set of Badlands, Spacek met art director Jack Fisk, whom she married.[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl]
Spacek's iconic and career-defining role came in Brian De Palma's film Carrie (1976), in which she played Carietta "Carrie" White, a shy, troubled high school senior with telekinetic powers. Spacek had to work hard to persuade director de Palma to engage her for the role. After rubbing Vaseline into her hair and donning an old sailor dress her mother made for her as a child, Spacek turned up at the audition with the odds against her, but won the part.Brian De Palma.net; accessed 27 May 2007 She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her work in the film. Spacek had previously been the set dresser for DePalma's film Phantom of the Paradise (1974).
After Carrie, Spacek played the small role of housekeeper Linda Murray in Alan Rudolph's ensemble piece Welcome to LA (1976) and cemented her reputation in independent cinema with her performance as Pinky Rose in Robert Altman's classic 3 Women (1977). Altman was deeply impressed by her performance, having stated: "She's remarkable, one of the top actresses I've ever worked with. Her resources are like a deep well." Brian de Palma added: "is a phantom. She has this mysterious way of slipping into a part, letting it take over her. She's got a wider range than any young actress I know."[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911902-1,00.html | work=Time | title=Show Business: Basic Spacek: Keeping Life Tidy | date=1976-12-06 | accessdate=2010-05-23[/tpl] Spacek also helped finance then-brother-in-law David Lynch's directorial debut,  Eraserhead (1976) and is thanked in the credits of the film.

===1980s and Oscar win===

Spacek began the 1980s with an Oscar in 1980 for Coal Miner's Daughter (1980), in which she played country music star Loretta Lynn, who selected her for the role. In the film, both she and Beverly D'Angelo, who played Patsy Cline, performed their own singing. Film critic Roger Ebert has credited the movie's success "to the performance by Sissy Spacek as Loretta Lynn. With the same sort of magical chemistry she's shown before, when she played the high school kid in Carrie, Spacek at 29 has the ability to appear to be almost any age on screen. Here, she ages from about 14 to somewhere in her 30s, always looks the age, and never seems to be wearing makeup."[tpl]Cite news| author = Roger Ebert | title = Coal Miner's Daughter| date = 1980-01-01 |url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19800101/REVIEWS/1010310/1023 | accessdate= 2008-06-18 | work=Chicago Sun-Times[/tpl] Spacek also was nominated for a Grammy Award for her singing on the film's soundtrack album. She followed this with her own country album, Hangin' Up My Heart (1983); the album spawned one hit single, "Lonely But Only For You", a song written by K. T. Oslin, which reached No. 15 on the Billboard Country chart.[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl]
In the film Heart Beat (1980), Spacek played Carolyn Cassady, who slipped (under the influence of John Heard's Jack Kerouac and Nick Nolte's Neal Cassady) into a combination of drudgery and debauchery.[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl]
Also in the 1980s, Spacek starred alongside Jack Lemmon in Constantin Costa-Gavras's political thriller Missing (1982, based on the book The Execution of Charles Horman) and appeared with Mel Gibson in the rural drama The River (1984), and with Diane Keaton and Jessica Lange in 1986's Crimes of the Heart (1986). She was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar for all of these roles. Other performances of the decade included star turns in husband Jack Fisk's directorial debut Raggedy Man (1981) and alongside Anne Bancroft in the suicide-themed drama 'night, Mother (1986). Spacek also showed her lighter side by voicing the brain in the Steve Martin comedy The Man with Two Brains (1983).

===1990s–2000s===

The 1990s saw Spacek slowly come back to Hollywood after her self-imposed hiatus.[tpl]cn|date February 2014|date=February 2014[/tpl] She had a supporting role as the wife of Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) in Oliver Stone's JFK (1991) and made a number of comedies, TV movies, and the occasional film. Most notable of her appearances during these years was her turn as the evil Verena Talbo in the ensemble piece The Grass Harp (1995), which reunited her with both Laurie and Lemmon, as well as a supporting performance, again alongside Nick Nolte, as the waitress Margie Fogg in Paul Schrader's father-son psychodrama Affliction (1997). She also played Rose Straight in David Lynch's The Straight Story (1999). 
In 2001, she was again nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, for her work in Todd Field's In the Bedroom (2001). The New York Times film critic Stephen Holden said of her work in the film: "Ms. Spacek's performance is as devastating as it is unflashy. With the slight tightening of her neck muscles and a downward twitch of her mouth, she conveys her character's relentlessness, then balances it with enough sweetness to make Ruth seem entirely human. It is one of Ms. Spacek's greatest performances."[tpl]cite news|author=Holden, Stephen| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9401EED8143AF930A15752C1A9679C8B63 |title=When Grief Becomes A Member of the Family|work=The New York Times|date= November 23, 2001[/tpl] Her performance as Ruth Fowler, a grieving mother consumed by revenge, won extraordinary praise and garnered the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress[tpl]cite news|last=King|first=Susan|title='Bedroom' Is Top Pick of L.A.
