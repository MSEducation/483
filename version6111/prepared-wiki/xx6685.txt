The Levant ([tpl]IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|v|æ|n|t[/tpl]), also known as the Eastern Mediterranean, is a geographic and cultural region consisting of the "eastern Mediterranean littoral between Anatolia and Egypt".Harris, William W. The Levant: a Fractured Mosaic The Levant today consists of the island of Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and part of southern Turkey (the former Aleppo Vilayet).
Precise definitions have varied over time, and the term originally had a broader and less well-defined usage.The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, Volume 1, p247, "Levant" The Levant has been described as the "crossroads of western Asia, the eastern Mediterranean and northeast Africa".

==Etymology==

The term Levant, which first appeared in English in 1497, originally meant the East in general or "Mediterranean lands east of Italy".[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/levant| title=Levant | work=Dictionary.com| author=Douglas Harper, Online Etymology Dictionary| accessdate=2012-07-27 [/tpl] It is borrowed from the French levant 'rising', that is, the point where the sun rises,Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition ultimately from Latin levare 'lift, raise'. Similar etymologies are found in Greek Ἀνατολή (Anatolē, cf. Anatolia), in Germanic Morgenland (which means, literally, "morning land"), in Italian (as in "Riviera di Levante", the portion of the Liguria coast east of Genoa), in the Hungarian Kelet, Spanish "Levante" and Catalan "Llevant" (the place of rising). Most notably, "Orient" and its Latin source oriens meaning "east", is literally "rising", deriving from Latin orior "rise".
The notion of the Levant has undergone a dynamic process of historical evolution in usage, meaning, and understanding. While the term "Levantine" originally referred to the European residents of the eastern Mediterranean region, it later came to refer to regional "native" and "minority" groups.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.levantine-journal.org/AboutJLS.aspx|title=Journal of Levantine Studies|publisher=The Van Leer Jerusalem Institute|accessdate=30 January 2014[/tpl]

===Early European usage===

The term became current in English in the 16th century, along with the first English merchant adventurers in the region; English ships appeared in the Mediterranean in the 1570s, and the English merchant company signed its agreement ("capitulations") with the Grand Turk in 1579 (Braudel). The English Levant Company was founded in 1581 to trade with the Ottoman Empire, and in 1670 the French Compagnie du Levant was founded for the same purpose. At this time, the Far East was known as the "Upper Levant".
In 19th-century travel writing, the term incorporated eastern regions under then current or recent governance of the Ottoman empire, such as Greece. In 19th-century archaeology, it referred to overlapping cultures in this region during and after prehistoric times, intending to reference the place instead of any one culture.

===Since World War I===

The French mandates of Syria and Lebanon (1920–1946) were called the Levant states.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]

===Since World War II===

Today "Levant" is typically used by archaeologists and historians with reference to the prehistory and the ancient and medieval history of the region, as when discussing the Crusades. The term is also occasionally employed to refer to modern events, peoples, states or parts of states in the same region, namely Cyprus, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria (compare with Near East, Middle East, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia). Several researchers include the island of Cyprus in Levantine studies, including the Council for British Research in the Levant,[tpl]cite web|author=Sandra Rosendahl |url=http://www.cbrl.org.uk/ |title=Council for British Research in the Levant homepage |publisher=Cbrl.org.uk |date=2006-11-28 |accessdate=2010-07-05[/tpl] the UCLA Near Eastern Languages and Cultures department,Biblical and Levantine studies, UCLA Journal of Levantine Studies[tpl]cite journal|title=About JLS|journal=Journal of Levantine Studies|url=http://www.levantine-journal.org/AboutJLS.aspx[/tpl] and the UCL Institute of Archaeology,The Ancient Levant, UCL Institute of Archaeology, May 2008 the last of which has dated the connection between Cyprus and mainland Levant to the early Iron Age. Currently, a dialect of Levantine Arabic, Cypriot Maronite Arabic, is the most-spoken minority language in Cyprus. Archaeologists seeking a neutral orientation that is neither biblical nor national have used terms such as Syro-Palestinian archaeology and archaeology of the southern Levant.Dever, William G. "Syro-Palestinian and Biblical Archaeology", pp. 1244-1253.Sharon, Ilan "Biblical archaeology" in Encyclopedia of Archaeology Elsevier.
While the usage of the term "Levant" in academia has been relegated to the fields of archeology and literature, there is a recent attempt to reclaim the notion of the Levant as a category of analysis in political and social sciences. Two academic journals were recently launched: Journal of Levantine Studies, published by The Van Leer Jerusalem Institute and The Levantine Review, published by Boston College.
