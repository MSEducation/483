Bettendorf Transit is the operator of public transportation in Scott County, Iowa. Bus service began in the city in 1974, with the municipality contracted with Moline for the creation of one intercity line. In 1980, fixed route service began, and today four local and one intercity routes are provided, using 6 standard and two smaller buses. Standard fares are 60 cents; while all buses are wheelchair accessible, paratransit is not a function of this agency, but instead is a function of River Bend Transit.
