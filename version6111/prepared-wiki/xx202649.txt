==Content==

"Holler Back" is an up-tempo in which the narrator describes his feeling out of place in an urban setting. In the first verse, he mentions a friend who tells him to "holler back when gets back home", although the narrator says that the only "holler back" that he knows is "that holler back in the woods". This line refers to the Southern American English word "holler", a slang term for a hollow or valley. In the second verse, he describes a woman named Mary Jo who lives in the hollow.

==Reception==

Jim Malec of The 9513 gave the song a "thumbs down" rating, as he thought that it "poked fun" at Gwen Stefani's "Hollaback Girl", but since "Holler Back" was released three years after Stefani's song, he called it "an opportunity lost to very poor timing".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.the9513.com/the-lost-trailers-holler-back/ |title=The Lost Trailers - "Holler Back" |accessdate=2008-08-13 |last=Malec |first=Jim |date=2008-03-21 |work=The 9513[/tpl] He also called "Holler Back" "an incredibly tight track with a John Rich-worthy hook…which showcases guitarist Stokes Nielson's spot-on…under-appreciated songwriting talent."
