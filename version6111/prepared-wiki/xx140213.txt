==History==

The station went on the air in June 1987 as WQMI with a middle of the road format. In 1989, it became WCQL-FM as "Cool 95.3" with an oldies format. That was dropped in August 1996 in favor of a contemporary hit radio format, WXHT ("Heat 95.3"), which placed a heavy emphasis on 1980s New Wave hits. That lasted until May 1998, when it went modern rock as "95-3 The Heat" via Radio One Networks.
In March 1999, the station changed to a country format, becoming WUBB ("B95.3"). However, WUBB was faced with strong competition from country leader 97.5 WOKQ, which also had a much stronger signal. WUBB also had a limited local presence when compared to WOKQ. As a result, WUBB never became a big ratings success.
On January 10, 2008, it was noted that the station had dropped country and was simulcasting sister station WQSO 96.7 (oldies) with WUBB's website stating "Coming Soon! Sports Radio" with a link to MSN's Fox Sports page, implying that the new format would be Fox Sports Radio, seeing as the station is owned by Clear Channel Communications, which, in turn, owns Fox Sports Radio. However, this never happened, and this was thought to be put on the website only to throw people off.
Then, on January 11, WUBB switched to a stunt format of TV theme songs; in between the songs, there was a message saying "We are building a new station just for you," promoting an unnamed new format that would be announced at 6 a.m. on January 14, 2008. At the announced time, the station relaunched as "Kiss 95.3", simulcasting WXKS-FM from Boston. Soon after, the call letters changed to current WSKX. As of August 2009, WSKX was no longer simulcasting WXKS-FM, but was still airing a Top 40 format.
In October 2012, sister station WERZ flipped to WSKX's top 40 format, branded as "Z107".  The station then began stunting with ocean waves and occasional bells.  A male voice and a website redirect listeners to the new sound of WERZ.  It also states for listeners to tune in next Tuesday for "a new station just for you", in a stunt similar to 2008's.
On October 9, 2012, the station flipped to "95.3 The Coast--We Play Everything", launching with Journey's Don't Stop Believin'.
In November 2013, The Coast flipped to Christmas music during the holidays, letting listeners choose the music played by choosing online.
