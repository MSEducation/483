[[Deva Soye]]

CATEGORIES: Calendars

Deva Soye is an Indian calendar period during which the beginning of auspicious works are prohibited. According to Indian philosophy during this period all the gods (Deva) are sleeping (Soye) and so they can not bless the beginning of any work. This period generally starts at the end of July and ends by the 3rd week of November. There is a way out for the people who don't strictly follow Deva Soye. According to another belief during 'Navratri', a festival of Durga, for 9 days doors of the heaven are open and so even if the gods are sleeping all the pending works can be completed. Navratri is traditionally an auspicious time for starting new ventures. 'Deva Soye' is a largely followed philosophy in the north India and considered a taboo by the intelligentsia.
