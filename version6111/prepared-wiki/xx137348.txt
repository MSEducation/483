Kythrea ([tpl]lang-el|Κυθραία, Κυθρεα[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-tr|Değirmenlik[/tpl]) is a small town on the island of Cyprus. It is under the de facto control of the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", an entity recognized only by Turkey.
Displaced inhabitants of Kythrea, now located at Nicosia and other locations in and outside Cyprus, maintain a refugee municipality though it has no control of the city itself. It shares premises with the similarly displaced municipality of Lapithos at 37 Ammochostou Street, Nicosia.

==History==

Kythrea, a small town 10 km northeast of the capital Nicosia, is situated near the ancient kingdom of Chytroi which was founded by Chytros, grandson of the Athenian King Akamas. Chytroi was one of the ten city-kingdoms of Cyprus in antiquity. According to one tradition the name Kythrea came from Chytroi (Χυτροι-Χυτρεα-Κυθρεα). According to another tradition the name Kythrea is derived from the name of the Greek Ionian island Kythera from where millstones were transferred to Kythrea's watermills. The small town was watered for millennia by the Kefalovrysos spring. However, shortly after the Turkish intervention of Cyprus the water stopped flowing.
With the spread of Christianity in Cyprus, Chytroi became the official seat of a bishop. The most glorious bishop of Chytroi was Demetrianos. Kythrea is undoubtedly a remarkable archaeological areas. One outstanding statue discovered in the area is the magnificent bronze statue of Roman Emperor Sepimius Severus, exhibited in the archaeological museum of Nicosia.The Kythrea Municipality was founded in 1915.
