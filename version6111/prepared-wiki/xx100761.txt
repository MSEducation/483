==Recording==

The liner notes tells an interesting story about the recording of "Something's Always Wrong" that appears on this EP.
 It's a good thing we decided to record acoustically because the day before the session our rehearsal space had been broken into and all our gear was stolen. So with borrowed guitars and shakers, and a lot of help from our friend, Bruce Winter, we proceeded. The recording was punctuated by the filling out of police reports and dusting for fingerprints, all of which added an ironic element in light of the song's lyrical content.[tpl]Full citation|date=April 2014[/tpl] 
The additional tracks were recorded before a small private audience. It is rumored that the album as a whole was produced to make up for an in-store appearance in Schaumburg, Illinois that was canceled by the city's mayor.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
