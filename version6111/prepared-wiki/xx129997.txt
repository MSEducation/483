Also known as Lady Mihri and Mihri Khatun (died 1506 AD) (مهری خاتون) was a female Ottoman poet. She was the daughter of a kadi (an Ottoman judge) and according to sources she spent most of her life in and near Amasya, in Anatolia. (Havlioglu, 2). Documentation places her as a member of the literary circle of Prince Ahmed, the son of Sultan Bayezid II. (Lewis, 207).
The myth that has grown up around her states that she “fell in love many times but insists that all these loves were chaste and innocent, and that she led a life of unremitting virtue.” (Lewis, 207) Lewis notes that though described as both “beautiful and ardent, she remained unmarried.” (Lewis, 207)

==Poetry==

Lady Mihri's poems reveal an artist grounded in both Persian Literature, writing in such forms as the Gazel, as well as the recipient of a deep literary education. (Havlioglu, 2) Modern critics, such as Bernard Lewis describe her style as “retaining remarkable freshness and simplicity.” (Lewis, 207)
One of her more popular lines goes as follows: “ At one glance/ I love you/ With a thousand hearts ... Let the zealots think/ Loving is sinful/ Never mind/ Let me burn in the hellfire/ Of that sin.” (Halman, 35)
Another is: “My heart burns in flames of sorrow/ Sparks and smoke rise turning to the sky/ Within Me the heart has taken fire like a candle/ My body, whirling, is a lighthouse illuminated by your image.” (Damrosch, 786)
