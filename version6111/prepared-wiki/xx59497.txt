During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, it was captured by Israel's Oded Brigade on October 31, 1948 during Operation Hiram.
The Israeli settlement of Goren, founded 1950, close to village land, is south of the village site. Adamit was founded in 1958 on village land, to the west of the village site.Khalidi, 1992, p.17-18 The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village site in 1992: "The site is covered with the debris of houses. It also has a number of wells and caves. The remains of animal shelters are located about [tpl]convert|1|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] away, and about [tpl]convert|4|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to the east is the rubble of houses used by the Arab al-Qulaytat."Khalidi, 1992, p.18
Petersen inspected the place in 1991, and found that the remains of the village consisted of several widely spaced rectangular houses, one storey high. Most houses were made of rough field stones laid dry, but with traces of older coursed masonry in places. The roofs were flat, made of earth on top of short branches, resting on transverse arches.Petersen, 2002, p. 155
