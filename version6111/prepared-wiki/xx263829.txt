The Alexander Smith Carpet Mills Historic District is a national historic district located at Yonkers, Westchester County, New York. It includes 85 contributing buildings.  It encompasses 19 stylistically varied mill buildings and six rows of workers' housing. They were developed between 1871 and 1930 along the banks of the Saw Mill River.  The main mill building was originally built in 1871 and expanded between 1876 and 1883. It is a three story, rectangular building, 52 bays wide and five bays deep in the Second Empire style.  It features a four story tower and a five story tower.  The workers' housing, known as Moquette Row, North and South, was built between 1881 and 1886.  The carpet works were developed by Alexander Smith (1818-1878).  The company closed the Yonkers mills and relocated to Greenville, Mississippi in 1954.  It was later absorbed into Mohawk Carpet, later Mohasco Corporation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10827|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration:Alexander Smith Carpet Mills Historic District|date=April 1983|accessdate=2011-01-01 |author=Karen Morey Kennedy and Austin N.
