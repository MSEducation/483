"Lateralus" is a song by American rock band Tool. The song is the third single and title track of their third studio album Lateralus.

==Overview and background==

The song is known for its distinct time signatures and corresponding lyrical patterns. The time signatures of the chorus of the song change from 9/8 to 8/8 to 7/8; as drummer Danny Carey says, "It was originally titled 9-8-7. For the time signatures. Then it turned out that 987 was the 16th number of the Fibonacci sequence. So that was cool."[tpl]cite web | author=Norris, Chris| year=2001| title=Hammer Of The Gods | url=http://toolshed.down.net/articles/text/spinmag.jun.2001.html | accessdate=2007-04-25[/tpl] It is also apparent that the lyrics are arranged in ascending then descending order of the Fibonacci sequence, which is 1,1,2,3,5,8, based on their syllables. For instance, the first line is "Black. Then. White are. All I see. In my infancy. Red and Yellow then came to be. Reaching out to me. Lets me see."[tpl]cite web | author=Toolshed| title=Lyrics to "Lateralis" | url=http://toolshed.down.net/lyrics/lateraluslyrics.php | accessdate=2011-05-06[/tpl] and further examples below.

==Interpretation==

In a 2001 interview, singer Maynard James Keenan commented on the lyric mentioning black, white, red and yellow: "I use the archetype stories of North American aboriginals and the themes or colours which appear over and over again in the oral stories handed down through generations. Black, white, red, and yellow play very heavily in aboriginal stories of creation."
The song could also be about the order of colors seen while under the influence of LSD. Alex Grey (the visionary artist who did the album artwork for Lateralus) stated that when he closed his eyes on an LSD trip, he saw a black and white spiral, and when he tried it a few more times it became a red and yellow spiral.[tpl]cite web | author=Maititab |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/t/tool/lateralus_ver6_tab.htm| title=Lateralus Tab | accessdate=2010-01-06[/tpl]
The line "As below so above and beyond, I imagine" is a quote from one of the Seven Aphorisms of Summum and is also a direct reference to Hermeticism and the Emerald Tablet.
An interesting side note, in alchemy "The Great Work" begins with the Nigredo (black), then moves to the Albedo (white), then the Citrinitas (yellow), then the Rubedo (Red).

==Mathematical significance==

Counting between pauses, the syllables in Maynard James Keenan's vocals during the verses form the first few Fibonacci numbers, ascending and descending:[tpl]cite web | author=diCarlo, Christopher| year=2001| title=Interview with Maynard James Keenan | url=http://www.cdicarlo.com/paper_04maynard.htm | accessdate=2007-04-22[/tpl]
