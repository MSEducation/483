Gleerup |page=137 [/tpl]|group=note[/tpl] and Scula (Old Norse: Skúli) were early 10th century Viking chieftains, notable for receiving lands through successful campaigning in what is now northern England. Onlafbald is also said to have been killed by the spirit of the 7th-century English saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne, after he profaned the long-dead saint. Scula's memory is preserved in a place-name in County Durham, near the lands he received from Ragnall.
Following the battle at Corbridge in about 918,[tpl]#tag:ref|See First Battle of Corbridge and Second Battle of Corbridge.|group=note[/tpl] the victorious Hiberno-Norse king Ragnall occupied lands between the River Tyne and the River Tees. Some of these lands had formerly been in the possession of an English noble named Ælfed, son of Brihtulf, who had received them from Cutheard, Bishop of Lindisfarne after he had fled Viking devastations in the west, to resettle on the eastern coast.[tpl]cite journal |editor=Harper-Bill, Christopher |title= |journal=Anglo-Norman studies: Proceedings of the Battle Conference |volume=19 |issue= |edition=Illustrated |pages= |isbn=978-0-85115-707-8 |date=1996 |publisher=Boydell & Brewer Ltd. |page=76 [/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|Hudson gives Alfred's name as "Alfred, son of Birihtulfinc"; Harper-Bill gives it as "Ælfed, son of Brihtulf".|group=note[/tpl] Ragnall divided these new acquisitions between two of his followers—Scula and Onlafbald. Scula received a massive tract of land which comprised the estates from Castle Eden to Billingham; and Onlafbald received a similarly large tract, which included the rest from Eden to the River Wear.[tpl]cite book |title=The Vikings in Britain |author=Loyn, H.

Onlafbald is said to have uttered profane blasphemies against the English saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne (d.687); after which the spirit of the saint miraculously tortured the pagan chieftain until he acknowledged the power of the Christian god and died on the spot.[tpl]cite book |title=The History and Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham |last=Surtees |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Surtees (antiquarian) |year=1908 |publisher=Hills and Co |location=Sunderland |volume=3 |page=52 |url=http://www.archive.org/details/historyantiquiti03surt [/tpl] In some accounts he is said to have invoked the power of his own gods—namely Thor and Odin.
The legacy of Scula is preserved in the place name of School Aycliffe, which is derived from his name (Old Norse: Skúli).[tpl]cite book |title=The Place-names of Northumberland and Durham |author=Mawer, Allen |year=1920 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=131–133 |isbn=978-0-19-820207-3[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Libellus de exordio atque procursu istius, hoc est Dunhelmensis, ecclesie |author=Simeon of Durham |editor=Rollason, David W. |year=1908 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=131–133 |isbn=978-0-19-820207-3[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/ONMensNames.shtml |title=Old Norse Men's Names |accessdate=7 January 2010 |work=www.vikinganswerlady.com[/tpl]
