Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), also called thyrotropin-releasing factor (TRF), thyroliberin or protirelin, is a tropic, tripeptidal hormone that stimulates the release of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and prolactin from the anterior pituitary. TRH has been used clinically for the treatment of spinocerebellar degeneration and disturbance of consciousness in humans.[tpl]cite journal |author=Zhang J, Watanabe Y, Yamada S, Urayama A, Kimura R |title=Neuroprotective effect and brain receptor binding of taltirelin, a novel thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) analogue, in transient forebrain ischemia of C57BL/6J mice |journal=Life Sci. |volume=72 |issue=4–5 |pages=601–7 |year=2002 |pmid=12467901 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3205(02)02268-3[/tpl]

==Synthesis==

TRH is produced by the hypothalamus in medial neurons of the paraventricular nucleus.[tpl]cite journal | author = Taylor T, Wondisford FE, Blaine T, Weintraub BD | title = The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus has a major role in thyroid hormone feedback regulation of thyrotropin synthesis and secretion | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 126 | issue = 1 | pages = 317–24 |date=January 1990 | pmid = 2104587 | doi = 10.1210/endo-126-1-317| url = | issn = [/tpl] At the beginning, it is synthesized as a 242-amino acid precursor polypeptide that contains 6 copies of the sequence -Gln-His-Pro-Gly-, flanked by Lys-Arg or Arg-Arg sequences. To produce the mature form, a series of enzymes are required. First, a protease cleaves to the C-terminal side of the flanking Lys-Arg or Arg-Arg. Second, a carboxypeptidase removes the Lys/Arg residues leaving Gly as the C-terminal residue. Then, this Gly is converted into an amide residue by a series of enzymes collectively known as peptidylglycine-alpha-amidating monooxygenase. Concurrently with these processing steps, the N-terminal Gln (glutamine) is converted into pyroglutamate (a cyclic residue). These multiple steps produce 6 copies of the mature TRH molecule per precursor molecule for human TRH (5 for mouse TRH).
Following secretion, TRH travels across the median eminence to the anterior pituitary gland via the hypophyseal portal system where it stimulates the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone from cells called thyrotropes[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/hypopit/tsh.html | title = Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone | author = Bowen R | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 1998-09-20 | work = Pathophysiology of the Endocrine System | publisher = Colorado State University | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-03-04[/tpl] and excess levels inhibit dopamine which will then stimulate the release of prolactin which in turn decreases GnRH.
TRH can also be detected in other areas of the body including the gastrointestinal system and pancreatic islets, as well as in the brain.

==History==

The sequence of TRH was first determined, and the hormone synthesized, by Roger Guillemin and Andrew V. Schally in 1969.[tpl]cite journal | author = Boler J, Enzmann F, Folkers K, Bowers CY, Schally AV | title = The identity of chemical and hormonal properties of the thyrotropin releasing hormone and pyroglutamyl-histidyl-proline amide | journal = Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 705–10 |date=November 1969 | pmid = 4982117 | doi = 10.1016/0006-291X(69)90868-7| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0006-291X(69)90868-7 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Burgus R, Dunn TF, Desiderio D, Guillemin R | title = structure of the hypothalamic hypophysiotropic TRF factor of ovine origin: mass spectrometry demonstration of the PCA-His-Pro-NH2 sequence | language = French | journal = C.R. Hebd. Seances Acad. Sci., Ser. D, Sci. Nat. | volume = 269 | issue = 19 | pages = 1870–3 |date=November 1969 | pmid = 4983502 | doi = | url = | issn = [/tpl] Both parties insisted their labs determined the sequence first: Schally first suggested the possibility in 1966, but abandoned it after Guillemin proposed TRH was not actually a peptide. Guillemin's chemist began concurring with these results in 1969, as NIH threatened to cut off funding for the project, leading both parties to return to work on synthesis.[tpl]cite book | author = Woolgar, Steve; Latour, Bruno | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Laboratory life: the social construction of scientific facts | edition = | language = | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks | year = 1979 | origyear = | pages = | chapter = Chapter 3: The Case of TRF(H) | quote = | isbn = 0-8039-0993-4 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = [/tpl]
Schally and Guillemin shared the 1977 Nobel Prize in Medicine  "for their discoveries concerning the peptide hormone production of the brain."[tpl]cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1977/index.html | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1977 | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | work = | publisher = NobelPrize.org | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-03-04[/tpl] News accounts of their work often focused on their "fierce competition" and use of a very large amount of sheep and pig brains to locate the hormone.

==Clinical significance==

TRH is used clinically by intravenous injection (brand name Relefact TRH) to test the response of the anterior pituitary gland; this procedure is known as a TRH test. This is done as diagnostic test of thyroid disorders such as secondary hypothyroidism and in acromegaly.
TRH has anti-depressant and anti-suicidal properties, and in 2012 the U.S. Army awarded a research grant to develop a TRH nasal spray in order to prevent suicide amongst its ranks.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.armytimes.com/news/2012/07/ap-anti-suicide-nasal-spray-research-072512/ | title = Scientist developing anti-suicide nasal spray | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 25 July 2012| work = | publisher = ArmyTimes.com | accessdate = 2012-07-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://communications.medicine.iu.edu/newsroom/stories/2012/army-anti-suicide-initiative-brings-3-million-to-iu-school-of-me/ | date = July 24, 2012 | title = Army anti-suicide initiative brings $3 million to IU School of Medicine scientist’s research | publisher = Indiana University School of Medicine[/tpl]
TRH has been shown in mice to be an anti-aging agent with a broad spectrum of activities that, because of their actions, suggest that TRH has a fundamental role in the regulation of metabolic and hormonal functions.[ref]Pierpaoli W.
