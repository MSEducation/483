Kanaloa kahoolawensis, the Ka palupalu o Kanaloa or kohe malama malama o kanaloa,USFWS. Kanaloa kahoolawensis Species Profile is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae, subfamily Mimosoideae, tribe Mimoseae, and is endemic to Hawaii. Kanaloa is a monotypic genus with the only species Kanaloa kahoolawensis.

==History==

Kanaloa was discovered in 1992 by the botanists Ken Wood and Steve Perlman of the National Tropical Botanical Garden on Kaho[tpl]Okina[/tpl]olawe, a small island that was formerly used as a bombing range.  Kaho[tpl]Okina[/tpl]olawe was a penal colony for the Hawaiian monarchy from 1826 to 1853, after which it was leased for ranching.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lorence|first=D.H|coauthors=Wood, K.R.|title=Kanaloa, a New Genus of Fabaceae (Mimosoideae) From Hawaii|journal=Novon|year=1994|volume=4|issue=2|pages=137–145|doi=10.2307/3391582[/tpl] Dry weather and ranching have devastated the island's vegetation.

==Habitat and range==

Only two plants have ever been found in the wild.[tpl]cite journal[/tpl] The single remaining plant grows on the cliffs of Ale[tpl]okina[/tpl]ale Pu[tpl]okina[/tpl]uloae on a sea stack off the coast of the Kaho[tpl]okina[/tpl]olawe.[tpl]cite web[/tpl] Soils are oxisols derived from basaltic lavas at an elevation of 45–60 m. It is possible that the range of this species previously included other Hawaiian islands; fossilized pollen from plants likely to be in the same genus has been found in core samples taken from sinkholes in O[tpl]Okina[/tpl]ahu's [tpl]okina[/tpl]Ewa Plain,[tpl]cite news |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/Aug/07/ln/hawaii708070352.html |first=Jan |last= TenBruggencate |title=Oahu sinkholes yield extinct birds |work=Honolulu Advertiser |date=2007-08-07[/tpl] Maui, and Kaua[tpl]Okina[/tpl]i's Makauwahi Cave.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/malamalama/2002/01/LostWorld.html |first=Cheryl |last=Ernst |title=Discovering Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i’s Real ‘Lost World’ |journal=Mālamalama |publisher=University of Hawaii |month=January |year=2002 |volume=27 |issue=1[/tpl] Whether the pollen grains in the samples belong to K. kahoolawensis cannot be determined. As Kaho[tpl]Okina[/tpl]olawe was united with Maui and other islands prehistorically (see also Maui Nui), it is entirely possible that the pollen belongs to K. kahoolawensis. On the other hand, it may also be that the O[tpl]Okina[/tpl]ahu population remains represent another, extinct, species - possibly an ancestor of K. kahoolawensis -, judging from the biogeography of Hawaiian land plants.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.state.hi.us/dlnr/dofaw/cwcs/files/Flora%20fact%20sheets/Kan_kah%20plant%20NTBG_W.pdf |format=PDF |title=Kanaloa |publisher=State of Hawai[tpl]Okina[/tpl]i |accessdate=2008-03-26[/tpl]Athens, J.

==Description==

K. kahoolawensis is an unarmed shrub reaching 0.75–1 m in height. Branches are dense, decumbent and measure 0.75-1.5 m long. New growth is densely brown hirtellous-villosulous with straight and curly, white and brown simple trichomes 0.1-0.3 mm long. Stipules free, paired, ovate, villosulous, 1.5–2 mm x 1.2-1.5 mm. Leaves alternate, bipinnately compound with one pair of pinnae, each pinna bears 3 leaflets, a terminal pair and a single proximal leaflet on the abaxial side, leaflets nearly sessile, pulvinus 
==Phylogeny==

Based on molecular phylogenetic studies, Kanaloa is closely related to Schleinitzia and Desmanthus.  Shared features include: lack of spines or prickles, presence of sessile petiolar glands, petals free to the base, and inflorescence a capitulum. Kanaloa differs from Schleinitzia in lacking glands at the apex of the anthers and having simple rather than compound pollen grains.  Fruits are dehiscent along the sutures in Kanaloa; in Schleinitzia the sutural ribs separate from the valves forming a craspedium similar to that in Mimosa. Kanaloa is most closely related to Desmanthus, sharing peltate floral bracts and inertly dehiscent fruits.  Kanaloa differs from Desmanthus in having 3 leaflets per pinna and cordiform seeds.[tpl]cite journal[/tpl]

==Conservation==

Other than preserving the wild plants, efforts have been put into establishing ex-situ stocks (in a nursery or arboretum), and increasing plant populations with a minimum of 25 individuals.[tpl]cite web[/tpl] Fences have been built to protect the single wild plant from grazing and trampling by introduced mammals. The plants are inspected regularly for insect damage and disease.[tpl]cite web[/tpl] Another plant that was grown from seed is currently kept in the National Tropical Botanical Garden’s McBryde Garden on Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, Hawaii.[tpl]cite web[/tpl]
