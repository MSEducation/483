==Transport==

Prior to December 1968 the eastern side of the suburb was served by frequent tram services along Bowen Bridge Road, with routes converging from Chermside, Kalinga (until 1962), Stafford, and  Grange.  These services combined to provide the suburb with an off-peak service of a tram every 2Â½ minutes along Bowen Bridge Road in the late 1950s.  The western side of the suburb was served by trams which ran along Kelvin Grove Road.  This service also ceased in December 1968.
Between 1953 and November 1968, the suburb was also served by Brisbane City Council trolley-buses which connected the suburb with Fortitude Valley and ran through to Stanley Bridge in East Brisbane.  The trolley-buses ran along Herston Road and Butterfield Street, past Ballymore football ground, terminating near the intersection of Prospect Terrace and Kelvin Grove Road.
Brisbane City Council diesel buses continue to serve the suburb.  The Inner-Northern Busway runs through the south of the suburb, having been built to divert buses off congested major roads.

==History==

Herston was first settled by Europeans in the 1850s. Sir Robert Herbert, Queensland's first premier, built a farm in the area, and lived in the farmhouse with his then Attorney-General, John Bramston. The pair named their house Herston, a combination of their surnames, which eventually became the name of the suburb.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23128452 |title=LINKS WITH THE LONG AGO. |newspaper=The Queenslander (Brisbane, Qld. : 1866 - 1939) |location=Brisbane, Qld. |date=11 September 1930 |accessdate=25 January 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Aldrich |first=Robert |coauthors=Wotherspoon, Garry |title=Who's Who in Contemporary Gay and Lesbian History: From World War II to the Present Day |year=2001 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=giM73n_lca4C&pg=PA207&vq=%22Robert+Herbert%22&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1_1&sig=mQg0smpWw1sDLsEImVb-JoQtCs4 |accessdate=1 March 2008 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-15982-2 |page=207 [/tpl]
