Mainframe computers (colloquially referred to as "big iron"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/20/ibm_mainframe_refresh/|title=IBM preps big iron fiesta|publisher=The Register|date=July 20, 2005[/tpl]) are computers used primarily by corporate and governmental organizations for critical applications, bulk data processing such as census, industry and consumer statistics, enterprise resource planning and transaction processing.
The term originally referred to the large cabinets called "main frames" that housed the central processing unit and main memory of early computers.[ref]
</ref> Later, the term was used to distinguish high-end commercial machines from less powerful units.<ref>[tpl]cite web|last=Beach|first=Thomas E.|title=Computer Concepts and Terminology: Types of Computers|url=http://www.unm.edu/~tbeach/terms/types.html|accessdate=November 17, 2012[/tpl]</ref>  Most large-scale computer system architectures were established in the 1960s, but continue to evolve.

==Description==

Modern mainframe design is generally less defined by single-task computational speed (typically defined as MIPS rate  or FLOPS in the case of floating point calculations), and more by:
Their high stability and reliability enables these machines to run uninterrupted for decades.
Software upgrades usually require setting up the operating system or portions thereof, and are non-disruptive only when using virtualizing facilities such as IBM′s z/OS and Parallel Sysplex, or Unisys′ XPCL, which support workload sharing so that one system can take over another's application while it is being refreshed. Mainframes are defined by high availability, one of the main reasons for their longevity, since they are typically used in applications where downtime would be costly or catastrophic. The term reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) is a defining characteristic of mainframe computers. Proper planning and implementation is required to exploit these features, and if improperly implemented, may serve to inhibit the benefits provided.  In addition, mainframes are more secure than other computer types: the NIST vulnerabilities database, US-CERT, rates traditional mainframes such as IBM zSeries, Unisys Dorado and Unisys Libra as among the most secure with vulnerabilities in the low single digits as compared with thousands for Windows, Unix, and Linux.[tpl]cite web |title=National Vulnerability Database|accessdate=September 20, 2011 |url=http://nvd.nist.gov/home.cfm[/tpl]
In the late 1950s, most mainframes had no explicitly interactive interface. They accepted sets of punched cards, paper tape, or magnetic tape to transfer data and programs. They operated in batch mode to support back office functions, such as customer billing, and supported interactive terminals almost exclusively for applications rather than program development. Typewriter and Teletype devices were also common control consoles for system operators through the 1970s, although ultimately supplanted by keyboard/display devices. By the early 1970s, many mainframes acquired interactive user interfacesIn some cases the interfaces were introduced in the 1960s but their deployment became more common in the 1970s and operated as timesharing computers, supporting hundreds of users simultaneously along with batch processing. Users gained access through specialized terminals or, later, from personal computers equipped with terminal emulation software. By the 1980s, many mainframes supported graphical terminals, and terminal emulation, but not graphical user interfaces. This format of end-user computing reached mainstream obsolescence in the 1990s due to the advent of personal computers provided with GUIs. After 2000, most modern mainframes have partially or entirely phased out classic "green screen" terminal access for end-users in favour of Web-style user interfaces.
The infrastructure requirements were drastically reduced during the mid-1990s when CMOS mainframe designs replaced the older bipolar technology. IBM claimed that its newer mainframes could reduce data center energy costs for power and cooling, and that they could reduce physical space requirements compared to server farms.[tpl]cite web |title=Get the facts on IBM vs the Competition- The facts about IBM System z "mainframe" |publisher=IBM |accessdate=December 28, 2009 |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/migratetoibm/getthefacts/mainframe.html#4[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

Modern mainframes can run multiple different instances of operating systems at the same time. This technique of virtual machines allows applications to run as if they were on physically distinct computers. In this role, a single mainframe can replace higher-functioning hardware services available to conventional servers. While mainframes pioneered this capability, virtualization is now available on most families of computer systems, though not always to the same degree or level of sophistication.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
Mainframes can add or hot swap system capacity without disrupting system function, with specificity and granularity to a level of sophistication not usually available with most server solutions.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] Modern mainframes, notably the IBM zSeries, System z9 and System z10 servers, offer two levels of virtualization: logical partitions (LPARs, via the PR/SM facility) and virtual machines (via the z/VM operating system). Many mainframe customers run two machines: one in their primary data center, and one in their backup data center—fully active, partially active, or on standby—in case there is a catastrophe affecting the first building. Test, development, training, and production workload for applications and databases can run on a single machine, except for extremely large demands where the capacity of one machine might be limiting. Such a two-mainframe installation can support continuous business service, avoiding both planned and unplanned outages. In practice many customers use multiple mainframes linked either by Parallel Sysplex and shared DASD (in IBM's case),[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] or with shared, geographically dispersed storage provided by EMC or Hitachi.
Mainframes are designed to handle very high volume input and output (I/O) and emphasize throughput computing. Since the late-1950s,E.g., the IBM 709 had channels in 1958 mainframe designs have included subsidiary hardwaresometimes computers, sometimes more limited (called channels or peripheral processors) which manage the I/O devices, leaving the CPU free to deal only with high-speed memory. It is common in mainframe shops to deal with massive databases and files. Gigabyte to terabyte-size record files are not unusual.[ref]
