[[1911 Michigan Wolverines football team]]

CATEGORIES: 1911 NCAA football season, Michigan Wolverines football seasons, 1911 in Michigan

The 1911 Michigan Wolverines football team represented the University of Michigan in the 1911 college football season. The team's head coach was Fielding H. Yost in his 11th season at Michigan. The Wolverines compiled a record of 5–1–2 and outscored their opponents 90 to 38.
After beginning the season with four consecutive wins, the team was stricken with multiple injuries and won only one of its final four games, an 11–9 victory over Penn in the annual rivalry game with the Quakers.  The team's sole loss was to Cornell in a game in which halfback Jimmy Craig, quarterback Shorty McMillan, and lineman Miller Pontius were all sidelined with injuries. As the injuries mounted, the Detroit Free Press quipped in late November 1911 that Michigan could claim the world championship of injuries, having had more injuries in 1911 than ever before in the program's history.
Only one Michigan player received All-American honors in 1911.  Stanfield Wells, who played three games at right end and three at right halfback, was selected as a first-team All-American by the The New York Globe and Henry L. Williams.  Two other players on the 1911 team, Pontius and Craig received All-American honors in 1912 or 1913.
Four Michigan players were recognized as first-team All-Western players.  They were Wells, team captain Frederick L. Conklin, fullback and punter George "Bottles" Thomson, and Craig.  Thomson was also the team's high scorer with seven touchdowns in seven games for a total of 35 points.

===Pre-season===

The 1911 team featured several players who had been starters on the undefeated 1910 Michigan Wolverines football team, including team captain Frederick L. Conklin, Thomas A. Bogle, Jr., Stanfield Wells, Shorty McMillan, and George C. Thomson.  The team also included a promising group of sophomores who had played on the freshman team in 1910, including Jimmy Craig, Miller Pontius, and George C. Paterson.[tpl]cite news|title=Football Prospects for 1911|newspaper=The Michigan Alumnus, Volume 18|date=October 1911|page=30|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8U1YAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]  However, with games against Ohio State, Vanderbilt, Cornell, Penn, and Nebraska, the team faced "one of the hardest schedules ever arranged for the Wolverines."[tpl]cite news|author=Jack Proctor|title=Yost Sees Hard Year Ahead: Wolverine Coach Pleased with Prospective Eleven: Team Heavier Than 1910; Five Veterans as Nucleus of Squad Which Faces Tough Schedule|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=August 25, 1911|url=[/tpl]

===Case===

On October 7, 1911, Michigan opened its season at Ferry Field with a 24–0 victory over the team from Cleveland's Case Scientific School.  The game was the 15th meeting between the two programs, and Michigan had won 13 of the 14 prior games.  The teams had played to a tie in 1910.[tpl]cite web|title=Michigan vs Case Institute of Technology (OH)|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/bigten/michigan/opponents_records.php?teamid=582[/tpl]
Michigan scored four touchdowns (valued at five points under 1911 rules) and kicked four extra points in the game.  Fullback George C. "Bottles" Thomson scored all four touchdowns for Michigan, including two touchdowns in the fourth quarter on runs of three and 25 yards.  Team captain and left tackle Frederick L. Conklin kicked all four extra points.  On defense, Michigan held Case to one first down.  Sophomore Jimmy Craig appeared in his first game and started at the quarterback position.  The Detroit Free Press called a 20-yard punt return by Craig "the prettiest play of the game" and opined that Craig "showed real ability at the art of dodging and straight-arming eluding no less than five would-be tacklers before anyone could down him."  No serious injuries were sustained in the Case game, and the Free Press noted that the team was showing "remarkable early season speed."[tpl]cite news|title=Michigan Bids Fair to Fulfill Promises: With Two Exceptions, the First Squad Players Have Mastered Signals and Are Showing Remarkable Early Season Speed--Yost Demands That Every Man Be in the Right Place at the Right Time--All-Fresh Squad Has Right Look|newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=October 8, 1911|page=21|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1765139102.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+8%2C+1911&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=21&desc=MICHIGAN+BIDS+FAIR+TO+FULFILL+PROMISES[/tpl]

===at Michigan Agricultural===

In the second week of the season, Michigan defeated [tpl]cfb link|year=1911|team=Michigan State Spartans|title=Michigan Agricultural College[/tpl] by a 15–3 score in front of 5,000 spectators at College Field in East Lansing, Michigan. It was the sixth game in the Michigan - Michigan State football rivalry, and Michigan had a record of 4-0-1 in the five prior meetings, outscoring the Aggies by a combined total of 210 to 0.[tpl]cite web|title=Michigan vs Michigan State |publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/bigten/michigan/opponents_records.php?teamid=1988[/tpl]  The 1911 game was the first loss by M.A.C. on their home field.
Michigan threatened to score in the first quarter, but one drive was stopped when the Aggies' intercepted a pass at their own 10-yard line.  On the next drive, Michigan took the ball to the Aggies' 15-yard line, but a field goal attempt by Frederick L. Conklin was unsuccessful.  In the second quarter, another Michigan drive took the ball to the M.A.C. three-yard line, but Michigan was unable to score, and the Aggies took over on downs.  Walter Eckersall was the umpire and also covered the game for the Chicago Daily Tribune.  Eckersall wrote: "That Michigan met a Tartar in a team which held Yost's eleven to a 0 to 0 score in the first two periods and was the first to register a score . . . cannot be questioned.  Time after time the Wolverines carried the ball inside the local's fifteen yard line only to be checked by a slow defense."[tpl]cite news|title=Aggies Surprise Yost's Men: Michigan, Win, 15 to 3, but Has to Fight for Verdict; Wolverines Look Strong; Championship Timber at Ann Arbor, Says Eckersall|author=Walter H.

In the third quarter, the Aggies took the lead when their left halfback Hill kicked a field goal from the 35-yard line.  Shortly thereafter, a 30-yard gain by Otto Carpell helped set the stage for a field goal by Conklin from the 20-yard line.  In the fourth quarter, Michigan scored two touchdowns.  The first came on a 63-yard drive that included a 30-yard gain on a pass from fullback George C. Thomson to Stanfield Wells.  Wells finished the drive with a five-yard touchdown run, and Frederick L. Conklin kicked the extra point.  After the touchdown, Thomson returned M.A.C.'s kickoff 55 yards to the Aggies' 48-yard line.  Thomson then gained 35 yards on a running play for Michigan's second touchdown.  Conklin kicked the extra point.  Thomson also handled punting for Michigan, and one of his punts went 70 yards.
After the game, Walter Eckersall concluded: "Michigan has a team which is going to be mighty hard to beat as soon as Yost perfects the team play.  The Michigan mentor has the weight, speed, and cleverness for the development of another strong team."
The game was played in ten-minute quarters.  Michigan's lineup against the Aggies was Garrels (left end), Conklin (left tackle), Bogle (left guard), Paterson (center), Allmendinger and Quinn (right guard), Pontius (right tackle), Wells (right end), Craig and McMillan (quarterback), Torbet, Herrington and Craig (left halfback), Carpell (right halfback), and Thomson (fullback).

===Ohio State===

In the third week of the 1911 season, Michigan defeated  [tpl]cfb link|year=1911|team=Ohio State Buckeyes|title=Ohio State[/tpl] by a 19–0 score at Ferry Field.  The game was the 13th meeting in the Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry, with Michigan having won 10 of the prior meetings and tied twice.[tpl]cite web|title=Michigan vs Ohio St.|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/bigten/michigan/opponents_records.php?teamid=2380[/tpl]
After a scoreless first quarter, Stanfield Wells scored a touchdown from the six-yard line early in the second quarter. The extra point attempt by Frederick L. Conklin was unsuccessful.  As the game wore on, Michigan's conditioning was in evidence.  The Detroit Free Press wrote: "The pace that the Wolverines set was too fast for the men from Ohio and Coach Vaughn was forced to send in a substitute back field."  Early in the third quarter, Thomas A. Bogle, Jr. kicked a field goal from the 36-yard line.  Later in the third quarter, Michigan blocked a punt by Ohio State's Wright from behind his goal line.  Conklin recovered the ball for a touchdown and also kicked the extra point.   Michigan led 14–0 at the end of the third quarter.  Fullback George C. Thomson scored Michigan's final touchdown on a one-yard run in the fourth quarter.  Conklin's kick for extra point was unsuccessful.  The game ended with Michigan in possession of the ball at Ohio State's six-inch line.
After the game, the Detroit Free Press called Bogle, Wells and Conklin the "brightest stars of the day," though it noted that Conklin was "not up to snuff on kicking goals or at least was not today."  The Free Press also praised the work of Thomson: "Thomson seems to have the habit of taking a big share of the limelight and he lived up to his reputation today.  He was not punting far but his kicks were hard to handle and the way he hit the line and bumped off tackle for big gains was a feature."
With three impressive victories to open the season, the Free Press opined that the 1911 team had few weaknesses and called the backfield the "speediest Yost ever has had."[tpl]cite news|title=New Lineup Makes for Formidable Team: Michigan's Three Decisive Victories Show That Wolverine 1911 Machine Is Better Team Than Last Year's Outfit--Backfield Is Speediest Yost Ever Has Had--Few Weaknesses on Team|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=October 22, 1911|page=16|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1765171492.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+22%2C+1911&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=16&desc=NEW+LINEUP+MAKES+FOR+MORE+FORMIDABLE+TEAM[/tpl]

===Vanderbilt===

On October 28, 1911, Michigan defeated [tpl]cfb link|year=1911|team=Vanderbilt Commodores|title=Vanderbilt[/tpl] at Ferry Field by a score of 9 to 8.  The game matched Michigan head coach Fielding H. Yost against his former player and brother-in-law, Dan McGugin.  Because of the relationship between Yost and McGugin, the two teams played nine times between 1905 and 1923, with Michigan winning eight games and tying one.[tpl]cite web|title=Michigan vs Vanderbilt  |publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/bigten/michigan/opponents_records.php?teamid=3363[/tpl]
Before the game, Coach Yost reminded reporters that Vanderbilt's 1911 team included the same veteran line that had held Yale scoreless in 1910.  Yost predicted a hard game.[tpl]cite news|title=Yost Looking For Hard Game With Vanderbilt Today: Coach McGugin's Team Is Made Up of Veterans of Tried and True Line That Held Yale Scoreless Last Year--Wolverine Leader, However, Believes His Charges Can Swing the Verdict to Michigan's Banner Again|newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=October 28, 1911|page=9|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1767431592.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+28%2C+1911&author=Sepical+to+The+Free+Press&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=9&desc=YOST+LOOKING+FOR+HARD+GAME+WTH+VANDERBILT+TODAY[/tpl]
Thomas A. Bogle, Jr. of Michigan attempted two field goals in the first half, but both kicks were blocked.  After a scoreless first half, each team kicked a field goal in the third quarter.  Vanderbilt kicked its field goal after Shorty McMillan fumbled a punt, and Vanderbilt recovered the ball at Michigan's 27-yard line.  Later in the quarter, McMillan carried the ball 33 yards to the Vanderbilt 10-yard line on a quarterback run.  Frederick L. Conklin then place-kicked a field goal from the 19-yard line.  In the fourth quarter, Stanfield Wells ran five yards for a touchdown, and Conklin kicked the extra point to give Michigan a 9-3 lead.  Vanderbilt responded with its own touchdown, but the extra point failed due to a high kickout.
In the Detroit Free Press, E. A. Batchelor wrote: "Vanderbilt's failure to execute properly one of the simplest plays in the football catalogue was all that saved Michigan from the humilation of a tie score with Dan McGugin's peppery Dixie lads this afternoon." Batchelor opined that, with the exception of halfback Jimmy Craig and center "Bubbles" Paterson, the Wolverines "played their worst game of the season."  He described a 75-yard run by Craig in the fourth quarter as "the most spectacular play of the day."
Walter Eckersall served as the umpire and covered the game for the Chicago Daily Tribune.  Eckersall wrote that Michigan's offense suffered from "an air of overconfidence," its tackling was poor, and the team was completely fooled on forward passes.  He opined that the game was a reversal for Michigan, which would need "vast improvement" to defeat Penn and Cornell.
The game was played in 15-minute quarters.

===Penn===

In the final home game of the 1911 season, Michigan defeated Penn, 11–9, in an icy blizzard before a crowd of 17,000 persons at Ferry Field.  Since leaving the Big Ten Conference, Michigan had played annual rivalry games against Penn at or near the end of the season.  Penn was one of the dominant football programs of the era, winning seven national championships between 1894 and 1912.[tpl]cite web| url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2011/FBS.pdf  | title=2011 NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records | pages=70–75 | publisher=The National Collegiate Athletic Association | date=August 2011 | location=Indianapolis, IN | accessdate=March 18, 2012[/tpl]  The 1911 game was the seventh meeting between the schools.

Despite the seemingly hopeless odds, the old Michigan spirit was there, was in every practice under the electric lights, in every sharp cry of the quarterback, in every weary run to the gym, and was a factor more potent than ever before."1912 Michiganensian, p. 220. 
The New York Times credited the win to the "craftiness of Coach Yost and the speed of 'Jimmy' Craig."  Stanfield Wells scored a touchdown in the second quarter, and Frederick L. Conklin missed the extra point.  Penn took the lead in the third quarter on a 50-yard touchdown run by Captain Mercer and an extra point by Minds.  In the fourth quarter, Penn extended its lead to 9–5 on a drop-kicked field goal by Marshall from the 25-yard line.  Michigan scored the winning touchdown in the fourth quarter on a double pass to Craig who ran 23 yards for the score.  Conklin kicked the extra point, and Michigan led, 11–9.  The New York Times described the play that resulted in the winning touchdown as a "trick play" in which the Michigan blockers started to the right with Penn's defense following.  The ball was the tossed to Craig far to the left side of the field.  The Times called Craig Michigan's "offensive and defensive hero" in a "clean, snappy, spectacular, thrilling" game.
Walter Eckersall was the field judge and covered the game for the Chicago Daily Tribune.  He also called Craig the hero of the game and wrote that Michigan gave "a remarkable exhibition," played "hard and aggressive football" and "executed cleverly and faultlessly" an intricate formation.  He called it "a decided triumph for western football" and "a great game, the sort that makes football history."[tpl]cite news|author=Walter H.

Nebraska responded on the next drive with two long end runs that took the ball to Michigan's eight-yard line.  From there, Nebraska halfback Purdy ran for the touchdown.
The New York Times called the game "the hardest contest ever witnessed on Nebraska Field."  The 1912 Michiganensian opined that a mistake had been made in scheduling another game after the annual rivalry match with Penn: "Then came the anti-climax, the Nebraska game.  Frankly this game, the scheduling of it, the playing of it, was a mistake from the first.  Every football season has but one legitimate finish, the big game.  The team is practiced for it, the men are trained for it.  To have another contest follow, inevitably means a slump, not only in form, but in condition."1912 Michiganensian, p. 225.
Michigan's lineup against Nebraska was Conklin (left end), Quinn (left tackle), Kayner (left guard), Paterson (center), Garrels and Allmendinger (right guard), Bogle (right tackle), Herrington and Carpell (right end), McMillan (quarterback), Craig (left halfback), Herschel Smith (right halfback), and Thomson (fullback).[tpl]cite news|title=Michigan in Tie Game: Wolverines Outplayed by Nebraska -- Both Score After Fumble|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 26, 1911|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C0CE0DC1E31E233A25755C2A9679D946096D6CF[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Michigan, 6; Nebraska, 6|publisher=The Michigan Alumnus|date=December 1911|page=107|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8U1YAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=E.

===Post-season===

The 1912 Michiganensian summarized the 1911 football season as follows: "It was rather a checkered season, the football year of 1911, marred by defeat, spoiled by tie games, dismal in spots, brilliant in others, and darkened by an unceasing list of injuries and misfortunes. . . .  It is a hard season to compute as to its success, and yet a thorough summing up must show it as a success, a fight against odds, and a glorious culmination."1912 Michiganensian, p. 224.
