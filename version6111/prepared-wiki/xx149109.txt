Thiago Quirino da Silva or simply Quirino (born 4 January 1985 in Belo Horizonte) is a Brazilian football striker, who plays for Japanese side Shonan Bellmare.

==Career==

From 2003 to 2005, he played for Atlético Mineiro. On signing for Djurgårdens IF before the 2006 season, the club made it clear to media and competing clubs that they had found themselves their very own "golden boy". However, Thiago's impact at Stockholms Stadion was far from impressive and during the 2006 season, he scored only one goal and was regularly used as a substitute, if at all being part of the match squad. While this may be true, it is clear to see that the transfer from the Brazilian way of futbol to the Swedish football way took its toll on his game. Quirino did score in the derby against AIK on 24 September, making it 1–0 to his side.
On 21 November 2008 it was revealed that Quirino had officially been transferred to the newly relegated J. League team Consadole Sapporo.[ref]
