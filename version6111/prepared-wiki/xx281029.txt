Clarence Chesterfield Howerton (February 9, 1913 – November 18, 1975), also known as Major Mite, was an American circus performer who starred in the sideshow for over 25 years, 20 of which were with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. He was [tpl]height|ft=2|in=4[/tpl] tall and performed with  several groups from the early 1920s through the late 1940s, billed as the smallest man in the world. His small physique was often contrasted alongside larger circus sideshow acts, such as the juvenile obese and the excessively tall.
Regarded as a "highly successful sideshow novelty"[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/history/exhibition_culture/side.html | title=National Fairground Archive | work=The University of Sheffield | accessdate=2 November 2013 | author=Toulmin, Vanessa[/tpl] and celebrity, Howerton visited the White House and represented recruitment efforts of the United States Marine Corps. He was featured in multiple films, including a role as a Munchkin in 1939's The Wizard of Oz. He retired in 1949.

==Early life==

Clarence Chesterfield Howerton was born on February 9, 1913, in Salem, Oregon, to Frank and Helen Howerton.Census entry for Helen Crawford and Clarence Howerton. Clarence, age 27, born in Oregon.

However, Howerton grew to a height of only [tpl]height|ft=2|in=4[/tpl]. An expert said that he might have a "deranged ductless gland".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.mortythedog.com/2011/08/major-mite.html | title=Major Mite | work=The White Tops | date=Sep–Oct 1992 | accessdate=9 November 2013 | pages=11–14[/tpl] Howerton's mother was just over [tpl]height|ft=4[/tpl] tall, which led some to wonder if his small stature was inherited.
At age six, Howerton was living in McCleary, Washington, with his parents and five brothers, Albert, Ernest, Forrest, LeRoy, and Charles. His father was employed at the time as a factory mechanic. Howerton never attended school, likely due to his physical size and associated emotional consequences.[tpl]cite book|author=Marc Hartzman|title=American Sideshow: An Encyclopedia of History's Most Wondrous and Curiously Strange Performers|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_ruXJxuyNfgC&pg=PA191|date=21 September 2006|publisher=Penguin Group USA|isbn=978-1-58542-530-3|pages=191–[/tpl]
In January 1926, Frank Howerton shot himself, having been in poor health previously.  His mother subsequently remarried to Robert Crawford. At the time of the 1930 United States Census, Howerton was living with Crawford and his mother in Manhattan. According to the Census listing, Crawford was a "showman" while Howerton and his mother were identified as performers.Census entry for Robert Crawford, Helen Crawford, and Clarence Howerton.

==Career==

Howerton's career began at a young age, when his father entered him into a local vaudeville show. In 1923, at the age of ten, Howerton joined the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, where he starred as a major attraction.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ripleys.com/weird/inside-ripleys-world/major-mite/ | title=Major Mite | work=Ripley's Believe It or Not! | date=September 13, 2011 | accessdate=August 15, 2013[/tpl] The circus was the largest of the kind, with 800 performers and over 1000 animals. Although he was only ten years old, the circus sought to exaggerate his diminutive size by claiming that he was 18 years old. He was billed as the smallest man in the world, exhibited and known to the public under the name, "Major Mite". The "Major Mite" moniker had previously been used by a 19th-century circus performer, William E. Jackson, who died in 1901,[tpl]cite web | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=NZH19010226.2.52&l=mi&e=-------10--1----0-- | title=PERSONAL NOTES FROM LONDON.

Accompanied by his mother, Howerton spent 20 years with Ringling Bothers and also worked with the Cole Brothers Circus, the Coney Island Dreamland Side Show, and the World Circus Sideshow.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.westland.net/coneyisland/articles/freaks.htm | title=Coney Island - Freaks | work=Westland | accessdate=August 15, 2013[/tpl]
In December 1922, Howerton received national press coverage when he visited U.S. President Warren G. Harding at the White House and billed as "the world's smallest man."[tpl]cite news | title=Mite Visits Harding | date=December 1922 | accessdate=17 August 2013 | newspaper=San Antonio Light[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://ghostsofdc.org/2012/05/24/major-mite-white-house-1922/ | title=Wizard of Oz Munchkin Major Mite Visits the White House | work=Ghosts of DC | date=24 May 2013 | accessdate=August 15, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/azcentral/doc/814600858.html?FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Dec%2016,%201922&author=&pub=Arizona%20Republican%20(1890-1922)&edition=&startpage=&desc=Visits%20Harding | title=Visits Harding | date=December 16, 1922 | accessdate=17 August 2013 | newspaper=Arizona Republican[/tpl]  One newspaper noted at the time: "The smallest midget and the smallest Shriner in the world, known as Major Mite, caused more excitement when he called at the White House recently than many a notable has done."[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dWZcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mFYNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2654,4815903&dq=major-mite&hl=en | title=Smallest Shriner | date=January 8, 1923 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | newspaper=Aurora Daily Star[/tpl]
In 1927, Howerton drew the attention of The New York Times when he led a "strange cavalcade" through the streets of Manhattan to the Hospital for Crippled and Ruptured Children. Howerton led the parade in the original coach that had previously been used by General Tom Thumb. The coach was drawn by two Shetland ponies, and Howerton was accompanied by "Tiny Doll", described as "the Major's sweetheart" and other circus performers.[tpl]cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70F12FF3D5812738DDDAD0A94DC405B878EF1D3 | title=Circus in Hospital Delights Children: Major Mite Leads Cavalcade From Garden to Cheer Little Patients in East 42nd Street | date=April 24, 1927 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | newspaper=The New York Times[/tpl]  He also drew the attention of the Chicago Tribune when he visited Chicago in 1928.[tpl]cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/doc/180897196.html?FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Apr%204,%201928&author=&pub=Chicago%20Tribune&edition=&startpage=&desc=Maj.%20Mite,%20the%2024%20Inch,%2020%20Pound%20Mite,%20Visits%20Here | title=Maj.

In 1928, Howerton was paired with an extraordinarily large circus sideshow performer known as "Tom Ton" and billed as the "Human Atom" and "Big Baby Elephant."[tpl]cite news | title=Smallest Human Atom and Big Baby Elephant | date=June 25, 1928 | accessdate=17 August 2013 | newspaper=Syracuse Herald[/tpl] Howerton is said to have performed with numerous human oddities, also working with Ruth Pontico, a woman weighing [tpl]convert|700|lbs|kg[/tpl], in his career.[tpl]cite book | title=Strikingly True! | publisher=Random House | author=Tibballs, Geoff | year=2011 | pages=116–117 | isbn=9781847946706[/tpl]
In advertising and film, Howerton found success beyond the sideshow. During the 1930s, he was used as a mascot for the recruitment side of the United States Marine Corps.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/american-midget-actor-major-mite-is-held-aloft-by-sergeant-news-photo/78660804 | title=Major Mite | work=Getty Images | accessdate=28 December 2013[/tpl] His biggest role in acting was with 1939's The Wizard of Oz, in which he played the part of a trumpet-playing Munchkin, Herald #3, who announced the arrival of the mayor.

Howerton was often seen with other human oddities, for example, in 1924, he was photographed with Martin Feig, a four-year-old boy who weighed 104 pounds. Feig reportedly said to Howerton, "Aw, you're nothing but a germ-weight midget."[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lnVhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fv4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5589,2113934&dq=major-mite&hl=en | title=Age Doesn't Mean a Thing | date=April 10, 1924 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | newspaper=Toledo Blade[/tpl] One newspaper referred to Howerton, who was in reality only 13 years old at the time, as "the Beau Brummel of the side shows", noting that the Doll sisters (two female small persons working with Ringling Brothers) declared him "a regular sheik".[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7WVXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=g0QNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3391,655679&dq=major-mite&hl=en | title=Big and Little Fellows Will Be In Toledo With Circus | date=July 6, 1926 | accessdate=17 August 2013 | newspaper=The Toledo News-Bee[/tpl]
In contrast to his public persona, Howerton reportedly enjoyed cigars and beer, "often yelled obscenities," and was known to "run the length of a bar, kicking anything in his way", sometimes whilst dressed in children's clothes. While working with Ringling Brothers, Howerton befriended Jack Earle who was [tpl]height|ft=7|in=7+1/2[/tpl] tall,[tpl]cite book|author=Joe Nickell|title=Secrets of the Sideshows|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=40UzA984S4wC&pg=PA90|date=9 September 2005|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-7179-2|pages=90–[/tpl] but at the time was advertised as being [tpl]height|ft=8|in=7[/tpl].[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1787&dat=19320926&id=IUscAAAAIBAJ&sjid=M2QEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4324,934315 | title=Circus Midget Beats Giant At Penny-Ante | work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune | date=26 September 1932 | accessdate=2 November 2013 | pages=2[/tpl] The two were often photographed together in promotional materials for Ringling Brothers,[tpl]cite web|title=Outline of the Life of Jacob Erlich|publisher=Sideshow World|url=http://www.sideshowworld.com/41-GG/103-Jack/CG-Earle.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gettyimages.ie/detail/news-photo/major-mite-with-jack-earle-circus-performers-news-photo/97287420 | title=Major Mite with Jack Earle | publisher=Getty Images (from New York Daily News Archive) | accessdate=16 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://pastperfect-online.tumblr.com/post/45343218830/this-week-we-feature-two-people-for-our-bio | title=Photograph of Jack Erlich and Major Mite playing card | publisher=PastPerfect | accessdate=16 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/orig-34-texas-giant-jack-earle-major-mite-midget | title=Orig '34 Texas Giant Jack Earle Major Mite Midget Photo | publisher=Worth Point | accessdate=16 August 2013[/tpl] with it being said that "it is penny-ante poker which has made pals of Jack and the major".
