[[Hypothalamus]]

CATEGORIES: Endocrine system, Limbic system, Hypothalamus, Neuroendocrinology

The hypothalamus (from Greek ὑπό = under and θάλαμος = room, chamber) is a portion of the brain that contains a number of small nuclei with a variety of functions. One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the  pituitary gland (hypophysis).
The hypothalamus is located below the thalamus, just above the brainstem.  In the terminology of neuroanatomy, it forms the ventral part of the diencephalon.  All vertebrate brains contain a hypothalamus. In humans, it is roughly the size of an almond.
The hypothalamus is responsible for certain metabolic processes and other activities of the autonomic nervous system. It synthesizes and secretes certain neurohormones, often called releasing hormones or hypothalamic hormones, and these in turn stimulate or inhibit the secretion of pituitary hormones.
The hypothalamus controls body temperature, hunger, important aspects of parenting and attachment behaviors, thirst,Definition of hypothalamus - NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms fatigue, sleep, and circadian rhythms.

==Structure and inputs==

The hypothalamus is a brain structure made up of distinct nuclei as well as less anatomically distinct areas. It is found in all vertebrate nervous systems. In mammals, the axons of magnocellular neurosecretory cells in the paraventricular nucleus and the supraoptic nucleus (both located in the hypothalamus) contain oxytocin and vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), and project into the posterior pituitary[tpl]Citation Needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]. Much smaller parvocellular neurosecretory cells, neurons of the paraventricular nucleus, release corticotropin-releasing hormone and other hormones into the hypophyseal portal system, where these hormones diffuse to the anterior pituitary.
The hypothalamus coordinates many hormonal and behavioural circadian rhythms, complex patterns of neuroendocrine outputs, complex homeostatic mechanisms, and important behaviours. The hypothalamus must, therefore, respond to many different signals, some of which generated externally and some internally. Delta wave signalling arising either in the thalamus or in the cortex influences the secretion of releasing hormones; GHRH and prolactin are stimulated whilst TRH is inhibited. Thus, the hypothalamus is highly interconnected with other parts of the central nervous system, in particular the brainstem and its reticular formation. As part of the limbic system, it has connections to other limbic structures including the amygdala and septum, and is also connected with areas of the autonomous nervous system.
The hypothalamus is responsive to:

===Olfactory stimuli===

Olfactory stimuli are important for sex and neuroendocrine function in many species. For instance if a pregnant mouse is exposed to the urine of a 'strange' male during a critical period after coitus then the pregnancy fails (the Bruce effect). Thus, during coitus, a female mouse forms a precise 'olfactory memory' of her partner that persists for several days.
Pheromonal cues aid synchronisation of oestrus in many species; in women, synchronised menstruation may also arise from pheromonal cues, although the role of pheromones in humans is doubted by many.[tpl]Who|date=September 2011[/tpl]

===Blood-borne stimuli===

Peptide hormones have important influences upon the hypothalamus, and to do so they must pass through the blood–brain barrier. The hypothalamus is bounded in part by specialized brain regions that lack an effective blood–brain barrier; the capillary endothelium at these sites is fenestrated to allow free passage of even large proteins and other molecules.  Some of these sites are the sites of neurosecretion - the neurohypophysis and the median eminence. However, others are sites at which the brain samples the composition of the blood. Two of these sites, the SFO (subfornical organ) and the OVLT (organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis) are so-called circumventricular organs, where neurons are in intimate contact with both blood and CSF. These structures are densely vascularized, and contain osmoreceptive and sodium-receptive neurons that control drinking, vasopressin release, sodium excretion, and sodium appetite. They also contain neurons with receptors for angiotensin, atrial natriuretic factor, endothelin and relaxin, each of which important in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance. Neurons in the OVLT and SFO project to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, and also to preoptic hypothalamic areas. The circumventricular organs may also be the site of action of interleukins to elicit both fever and ACTH secretion, via effects on paraventricular neurons.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
It is not clear how all peptides that influence hypothalamic activity gain the necessary access. In the case of prolactin and leptin, there is evidence of active uptake at the choroid plexus from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Some pituitary hormones have a negative feedback influence upon hypothalamic secretion; for example, growth hormone feeds back on the hypothalamus, but how it enters the brain is not clear. There is also evidence for central actions of prolactin.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Findings have suggested that thyroid hormone (T4) is taken up by the hypothalamic glial cells in the infundibular nucleus/ median eminence, and that it is here converted into T3 by the type 2 deiodinase (D2). Subsequent to this, T3 is transported into the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus. Thyroid hormone receptors have been found in these neurons, indicating that they are indeed sensitive to T3 stimuli. In addition, these neurons expressed MCT8, a thyroid hormone transporter, supporting the theory that T3 is transported into them. T3 could then bind to the thyroid hormone receptor in these neurons and affect the production of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, thereby regulating thyroid hormone production.[tpl]cite journal|last=Fliers|first=Eric|coauthors=Unmehopa, Alkemade|title=Functional neuroanatomy of thyroid hormone feedback in the human hypothalamus and pituitary gland|journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology|date=7 June 2006|volume=251|issue=1–2|pages=1–8|accessdate=7 July 2011|doi=10.1016/j.mce.2006.03.042|pmid=16707210[/tpl]
The hypothalamus functions as a type of thermostat for the body.  It sets a desired body temperature, and stimulates either heat production and retention to raise the blood temperature to a higher setting or sweating and vasodilation to cool the blood to a lower temperature.  All fevers result from a raised setting in the hypothalamus; elevated body temperatures due to any other cause are classified as hyperthermia.  Rarely, direct damage to the hypothalamus, such as from a stroke, will cause a fever; this is sometimes called a hypothalamic fever. However, it is more common for such damage to cause abnormally low body temperatures.

===Steroids===

The hypothalamus contains neurons that react strongly to steroids and glucocorticoids – (the steroid hormones of the adrenal gland, released in response to ACTH). It also contains specialized glucose-sensitive neurons (in the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamus), which are important for appetite. The preoptic area contains thermosensitive neurons; these are important for TRH secretion.

===Neural inputs===

The hypothalamus receives many inputs from the brainstem, the most notable from the nucleus of the solitary tract, the locus coeruleus, and the ventrolateral medulla.
Oxytocin secretion in response to suckling or vagino-cervical stimulation is mediated by some of these pathways; vasopressin secretion in response to cardiovascular stimuli arising from chemoreceptors in the carotid body and aortic arch, and from low-pressure atrial volume receptors, is mediated by others. In the rat, stimulation of the vagina also causes prolactin secretion, and this results in pseudo-pregnancy following an infertile mating. In the rabbit, coitus elicits reflex ovulation. In the sheep, cervical stimulation in the presence of high levels of estrogen can induce maternal behavior in a virgin ewe. These effects are all mediated by the hypothalamus, and the information is carried mainly by spinal pathways that relay in the brainstem. Stimulation of the nipples stimulates release of oxytocin and prolactin and suppresses the release of LH and FSH.
Cardiovascular stimuli are carried by the vagus nerve, but the vagus also conveys a variety of visceral information, including for instance signals arising from gastric distension to suppress feeding. Again this information reaches the hypothalamus via relays in the brainstem.
In addition hypothalamic function is responsive to—and regulated by—levels of all three classical monoamine neurotransmitters, i.e. noradrenaline, dopamine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), in those tracts from which it receives innervation. For example noradrenergic inputs arising from the locus coeruleus have important regulatory effects upon CRH levels.

==Outputs==

The outputs of the hypothalamus can be divided into two categories: neural projections, and endocrine hormones.Hypothalamus and ANS

===Neural projections===

Most fiber systems of the hypothalamus run in two ways (bidirectional).

===Endocrine hormones===

The hypothalamus has a central neuroendocrine function, most notably by its control of the anterior pituitary, which in turn regulates various endocrine glands and organs. Releasing hormones (also called releasing factors), are produced in hypothalamic nuclei then transported along axons to either the median eminence or the posterior pituitary, where they are stored and released as needed.Overview of Hypothalamic and Pituitary Hormones
In the hypothalamic-adenohypophyseal axis, releasing hormones, also known as hypophysiotropic or hypothalamic hormones, are released from the median eminence, (itself a prolongation of the hypothalamus), into the hypophyseal portal system, which carries them to the anterior pituitary where they exert their regulatory functions on the secretion of adenohypopyseal hormones.[tpl]cite book |author=Melmed S, Jameson JL |editor=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, et al. |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-139140-1 |pages=2076–97 |chapter=Disorders of the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus[/tpl]
Other hormones secreted from the median eminence include vasopressin, oxytocin, neurotensin, and orexin.[tpl]cite journal|last=Horn|first=A. M.|coauthors=Robinson, I. C. A.

In the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal axis, neurohypophysial hormones are released from the posterior pituitary, which is actually a prolongation of the hypothalamus, into the circulation.
It is also known that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) hormones are related to certain skin diseases and skin homeostasis. There is evidence linking hyperactivity of HPA hormones to stress-related skin diseases and skin tumors.[tpl]cite web|title=Expression of Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis in Common Skin Diseases: Evidence of its Association with Stress-related Disease Activity|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=8239d5d4-8cd4-48b0-b25c-e1218229f462%40sessionmgr115&vid=11&hid=122|publisher=National Research Foundation of Korea|accessdate=4 March 2014|author=Jung Eun Kim, Baik Kee Cho, Dae Ho Cho, and Hyun Jeong Park|year=2013[/tpl]

==Control of food intake==

The extreme lateral part of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus is responsible for the control of food intake. Stimulation of this area causes increased food intake. Bilateral lesion of this area causes complete cessation of food intake. Medial parts of the nucleus have a controlling effect on the lateral part. Bilateral lesion of the medial part of the ventromedial nucleus causes hyperphagia and obesity of the animal. Further lesion of the lateral part of the ventromedial nucleus in the same animal produces complete cessation of food intake.
There are different hypotheses related to this regulation:[tpl]cite journal|author=Theologides A|title=Anorexia-producing intermediary metabolites|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|volume=29|issue=5|pages=552–8 |year=1976 |pmid=178168[/tpl]

==Sexual dimorphism==

Several hypothalamic nuclei are sexually dimorphic; i.e., there are clear differences in both structure and function between males and females.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Some differences are apparent even in gross neuroanatomy: most notable is the sexually dimorphic nucleus within the preoptic area. However most of the differences are subtle changes in the connectivity and chemical sensitivity of particular sets of neurons.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
The importance of these changes can be recognised by functional differences between males and females. For instance, males of most species prefer the odor and appearance of females over males, which is instrumental in stimulating male sexual behavior.  If the sexually dimorphic nucleus is lesioned, this preference for females by males diminishes.  Also, the pattern of secretion of growth hormone is sexually dimorphic, and this is one reason why in many species, adult males are much larger than females.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

===Responses to ovarian steroids===

Other striking functional dimorphisms are in the behavioral responses to ovarian steroids of the adult. Males and females respond to ovarian steroids in different ways, partly because the expression of estrogen-sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus is sexually dimorphic; i.e., estrogen receptors are expressed in different sets of neurons.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Estrogen and progesterone can influence gene expression in particular neurons or induce changes in cell membrane potential and kinase activation, leading to diverse non-genomic cellular functions.  Estrogen and progesterone bind to their cognate nuclear hormone receptors, which translocate to the cell nucleus and interact with regions of DNA known as hormone response elements (HREs) or get tethered to another transcription factor's binding site.  Estrogen receptor (ER) has been shown to transactivate other transcription factors in this manner, despite the absence of an estrogen response element (ERE) in the proximal promoter region of the gene.  In general, ERs and progesterone receptors (PRs) are gene activators, with increased mRNA and subsequent protein synthesis following hormone exposure.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Male and female brains differ in the distribution of estrogen receptors, and this difference is an irreversible consequence of neonatal steroid exposure. Estrogen receptors (and progesterone receptors) are found mainly in neurons in the anterior and mediobasal hypothalamus, notably:[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

===Gonadal steroids in neonatal life of rats===

In neonatal life, gonadal steroids influence the development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. For instance, they determine the ability of females to exhibit a normal reproductive cycle, and of males and females to display appropriate reproductive behaviors in adult life.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

===Androgens in primates===

In primates, the developmental influence of androgens is less clear, and the consequences are less understood. Within the brain, testosterone is aromatized to (estradiol), which is the principal active hormone for developmental influences. The human testis secretes high levels of testosterone from about week 8 of fetal life until 5–6 months after birth (a similar perinatal surge in testosterone is observed in many species), a process that appears to underlie the male phenotype. Estrogen from the maternal circulation is relatively ineffective, partly because of the high circulating levels of steroid-binding proteins in pregnancy.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

===Human sexual orientation and the hypothalamus===

According to D. F. Swaab, writing in a July 2008 paper, "Neurobiological research related to sexual orientation in humans is only just gathering momentum, but the evidence already shows that humans have a vast array of brain differences, not only in relation to gender, but also in relation to sexual orientation."[tpl]cite journal |author=Swaab DF |title=Sexual orientation and its basis in brain structure and function |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/30/10273.full |journal=PNAS |volume=105 |issue=30 |pages=10273–10274 |year=2008 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0805542105 |pmid=18653758 |pmc=2492513[/tpl]
Swaab first reported on the relationship between sexual orientation in males and the hypothalamus's "clock", the  suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In 1990, Swaab and Hofman[tpl]cite journal |author=Swaab DF, Hofman MA |title=An enlarged suprachiasmatic nucleus in homosexual men |journal=Brain Res. |volume=537 |issue=1–2 |pages=141–8 |year=1990 |pmid=2085769 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(90)90350-K[/tpl] reported that the suprachiasmatic nucleus in homosexual men was significantly larger than in heterosexual men. Then in 1995, Swaab et al.[tpl]cite journal |author=Swaab DF, Slob AK, Houtsmuller EJ, Brand T, Zhou JN |title=Increased number of vasopressin neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of 'bisexual' adult male rats following perinatal treatment with the aromatase blocker ATD |journal=Developmental Brain Research |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=273–279 |year=1995 |doi=10.1016/0165-3806(94)00218-O |pmid=7600674[/tpl] linked brain development to sexual orientation by treating male rats both pre- and postnatally with ATD, an aromatase blocker in the brain. This produced an enlarged SCN and bisexual behavior in the adult male rats. In 1991, LeVay showed that part of the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) known as the 3rd interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH 3), is nearly twice as large (in terms of volume) in heterosexual men than in homosexual men and heterosexual women.
In 2004 and 2006, two studies by Berglund, Lindström, and Savic[tpl]cite journal |author=Savic I, Berglund H, Lindström P |title=Brain response to putative pheromones in homosexual men |journal=PNAS |volume=102 |issue=20 |pages=7356–7361 |year=2005 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0407998102 |pmid=15883379 |pmc=1129091[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Savic I, Berglund H, Lindström P |title=Brain response to putative pheromones in lesbian women |journal=PNAS |volume=103 |issue=21 |pages=8269–8274 |year=2006 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0600331103 |pmid=16705035 |pmc=1570103[/tpl] used positron emission tomography (PET) to observe how the hypothalamus responds to smelling common odors, the scent of testosterone found in male sweat, and the scent of estrogen found in female urine. These studies showed that the hypothalamus of heterosexual men and homosexual women both respond to estrogen. Also, the hypothalamus of homosexual men and heterosexual women both respond to testosterone. The hypothalamus of all four groups did not respond to the common odors, which produced a normal olfactory response in the brain.

===Other influences upon hypothalamic development===

Sex steroids are not the only important influences upon hypothalamic development; in particular, pre-pubertal stress in early life (of rats) determines the capacity of the adult hypothalamus to respond to an acute stressor.[tpl]cite journal | last = Romeo | first = Russell D | coauthors = Rudy Bellani, Ilia N. Karatsoreos, Nara Chhua, Mary Vernov, Cheryl D. Conrad and Bruce S.

==Fear processing==

The medial zone of hypothalamus is part of a circuitry that controls motivated behaviors, like defensive behaviors.[tpl]cite journal| author=Swanson, L.W.|title= Cerebral Hemisphere Regulation of Motivated Behavior|journal=Brain Research|volume=886|pages=113–164|year=2000|doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(00)02905-X[/tpl] Analyses of Fos-labeling showed that a series of nuclei in the "behavioral control column" is important in regulating the expression of innate and conditioned defensive behaviors.[tpl]cite journal|author=Canteras, N.S.| title=The medial hypothalamic defensive system:Hodological organization and functional implications| journal=Pharmacology, Biochemistry & Behavior|volume=71|pages=481–491|year=2002|doi=10.1016/S0091-3057(01)00685-2[/tpl]

===Antipredatory defensive behavior===

Exposure to a predator (such as a cat) elicits defensive behaviors in laboratory rodents, even when the animal has never been exposed to a cat.[tpl]cite journal|author=Ribeiro-Barbosa, E.R.; et al|title=An alternative experimental procedure for studying predator-related defensive responses.|journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=29|issue=8|pages=1255–1263|year=2005|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2005.04.006[/tpl] In the hypothalamus, this exposure causes an increase in Fos-labeled cells in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial nucleus, and in the ventrolateral part of the premammillary nucleus (PMDvl).[tpl]cite journal|author=Cezário, A.F.|title=Hypothalamic sites responding to predator threats--the role of the dorsal premammillary nucleus in unconditioned and conditioned antipredatory defensive behavior.|journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|volume=28|issue=5|pages=1003–1015|year=2008|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06392.x[/tpl] The premammillary nucleus has an important role in expression of defensive behaviors towards a predator, since lesions in this nucleus abolish defensive behaviors, like freezing and flight. The PMD does not modulate defensive behavior in other situations, as lesions of this nucleus had minimal effects on post-shock freezing scores.[tpl]cite journal|author=Blanchard, D.C.|title=Dorsal premammillary nucleus differentially modulates defensive behaviors induced by different threat stimuli in rats|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=345|issue=3|pages=145–148|year=2003|doi=10.1016/S0304-3940(03)00415-4[/tpl] The PMD has important connections to the dorsal periaqueductal gray, an important structure in fear expression.[tpl]cite journal|author=Canteras, N.S.; Swanson, L.W.|title=The dorsal premammillary nucleus: an unusual component of the mammillary body.|journal=PNAS|volume=89|issue=21|pages=10089–10093|year=1992|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/89/21/10089.long|doi=10.1073/pnas.89.21.10089[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Behbehani, M.M.|title=Functional characteristics of the midbrain periaqueductal gray.|journal=Progress in Neurobiology|volume=46|issue=6|pages=575–605|year=1995|doi=10.1016/0301-0082(95)00009-K[/tpl]
In addition, animals display risk assessment behaviors to the environment previously associated with the cat. Fos-labeled cell analysis showed that the PMDvl is the most activated structure in the hypothalamus, and inactivation with muscimol prior to exposure to the context abolishes the defensive behavior. Therefore, the hypothalamus, mainly the PMDvl, has an important role in expression of innate and conditioned defensive behaviors to a predator.

===Social defeat===

Likewise, the hypothalamus has a role in social defeat: Nuclei in medial zone are also mobilized during an encounter with an aggressive conspecific. The defeated animal has an increase in Fos levels in sexually dimorphic structures, such as the medial pre-optic nucleus, the ventrolateral part of ventromedial nucleus, and the ventral premammilary nucleus.[tpl]cite journal|author=Motta, S.C.; et al|title=Dissecting the brain's fear system reveals the hypothalamus is critical for responding in subordinate conspecific intruders.|journal=PNAS|volume=106|issue=12|pages=4870–4875|year=2009|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/12/4870.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1073/pnas.0900939106[/tpl] Such structures are important in other social behaviors, such as sexual and aggressive behaviors. Moreover, the premammillary nucleus also is mobilized, the dorsomedial part but not the ventrolateral part. Lesions in this nucleus abolish passive defensive behavior, like freezing and the "on-the-back" posture.
