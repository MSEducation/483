Daniel Haas (born on 1 August 1983 in Erlenbach am Main, West Germany) is a German footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for 1. FC Union Berlin.

==Hoffenheim==

In Hoffenheim, Haas was one of the only two players who had been with Hoffenheim since their promotion to the 2. Bundesliga and then to the Bundesliga, the German top-flight. Although Hoffenheim's number 1, he never played over 25 games a season. 
Along with Ramazan Özcan or Thorsten Kirschbaum contending for the role of netminder, Haas enjoyed a rather good playing time, with 23 starts in 2006—07 and 17 the next season. After Timo Hildebrand's arrival to the club of the Rhein Neckar Arena early in 2009, he had seen his appearances becomings less frequent as his last game came on 11 April, ending with a send off in the 61st minute of play.
Haas had recovered his starting position during the first half of the 2010–11 season, but was named second choice after the arrival of Tom Starke.
