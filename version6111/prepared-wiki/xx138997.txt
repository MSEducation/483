In the second encounter, Piyusti and his auxiliary troops were defeated at the town of Šalampa. Later, Anitta was able to storm the city of Hattusa at night after its defenders were weakened by famine. Anitta utterly destroyed and cursed the Hatti capital. The later Hittite kings had to completely rebuild the city.Reign of AnittaHistorical Dictionary of the Hittites by Charles Allen Burney
