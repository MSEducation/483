[[Law of averages]]

The law of averages is a layman's term used to express a belief that outcomes of a random event will "even out" within a small sample.
As invoked in everyday life, the "law" usually reflects bad statistics or wishful thinking rather than any mathematical principle. While there is a real theorem that a random variable will reflect its underlying probability over a very large sample, the law of averages typically assumes that unnatural short-term "balance" must occur.Rees, D.G. (2001) Essential Statistics, 4th edition, Chapman & Hall/CRC.  ISBN 1-58488-007-4 (p.48) Typical applications of the law also generally assume no bias in the underlying probability distribution, which is frequently at odds with the empirical evidence.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
