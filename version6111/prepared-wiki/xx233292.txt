The Leonard W. Stanley House is a historic house at 23â€“25 Taylor Street in Waltham, Massachusetts.  The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built in 1855-56 by Leonard Stanley, a policeman.  It is one of the oldest houses on the South Side of Waltham, which the city purchased from Newton in 1849, and is an unusual local example of transitional Federal/Italianate styling.  Its basic massing is somewhat typically Federalist, with a five bay facade and side gable roof.  However, it has deep eaves and segmented-arch attic windows, typical Italianate features.  The main block was extended with ells in the 1870s and 1880s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=WLT.650|title=NRHP nomination for Leonard W.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.
