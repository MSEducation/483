Skin cancer result in 80,000 deaths a year as of 2010; 49,000 of which are due to melanoma and 31,000 of which are due to non-melanoma skin cancers.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0[/tpl] This is up from 51,000 in 1990.
More than 3.5 million cases of skin cancer are diagnosed annually in the United States, which makes it the most common form of cancer in that country. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, one in five Americans will develop skin cancer at some point of their lives. The first most common form of skin cancer is basal cell carcinoma, followed by the squamous cell carcinoma. Although the incidence of many cancers in the United States is falling, the incidence of melanoma keeps growing,  with approximately 68,729 melanomas diagnosed in 2004 according to reports of the National Cancer Institute.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.skincancer.org/Skin-Cancer-Facts/| title=Skin Cancer Facts|accessdate= 2010-07-02[/tpl]
The survival rate for patients with melanoma depends upon when they start treatment. The cure rate is very high when melanoma is detected in early stages,  when it can easily be removed surgically.  The prognosis is less favorable if the melanoma has spread to other parts of the body.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.skincancerjournal.com/melanoma/| title=Malignant Melanoma Cancer|accessdate= 2010-07-02[/tpl]
In the UK, 84,500 non-melanoma skin cancers were registered in 2007 although a study estimated that at least 100,000 cases are diagnosed each year. Most NMSCs were basal cell carcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. In 2007, 10,672 cases of malignant melanoma were diagnosed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/skin/incidence/index.htm| title=Skin Cancer – UK Incidence Statistics|accessdate= 2010-07-02[/tpl]
Australia and New Zealand exhibit one of the highest rates of skin cancer incidence in the world, almost four times the rates registered in the United States, the UK and Canada. Around 434,000 people receive treatment for non-melanoma skin cancers and 10,300 are treated for melanoma. Melanoma is the most common type of cancer in people between 15–44 years in both countries. The incidence of skin cancer has been increasing.
The incidence of melanoma among Auckland residents of European descent in 1995 was 77.7 cases per 100,000 people per year, and was predicted to increase in the 21st century because of "the effect of local stratospheric ozone depletion and the time lag from sun exposure to melanoma development."[ref]
