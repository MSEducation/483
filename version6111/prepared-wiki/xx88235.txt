Bergenia [tpl]IPAc-en|b|ər|ˈ|ɡ|ɛ|n|i|ə[/tpl]Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606–607 (elephant-eared saxifrage, elephant's ears) is a genus of ten species of flowering plants in the family Saxifragaceae, native to central Asia, from Afghanistan to China and the Himalayan region.

==Description==

They are clump-forming, rhizomatous, evergreen perennials with a spirally arranged rosette of leaves 6–35 cm long and 4–15 cm broad, and pink flowers produced in a cyme.[tpl]cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1405332964|pages=1136[/tpl] The leaves are large, leathery, ovate or cordate, and often have wavy or saw-toothed edges. For most of the year, the leaves have a glossy green colour, but in cooler climates, they turn red or bronze in the fall.  The flowers grow on a stem similar in colour to a rhubarb stalk and most varieties have cone-shaped flowers in varying shades of pink.  These can range from almost white to ruby red and purple.[tpl]cite web | title=Guide to Growing Bergenia Plants | url=http://www.thegardenhelper.com/bergenia.html | date= | work= | publisher=The Garden Helper |accessdate=2009-06-30[/tpl]
The common names for Bergenia are pigsqueak (due to the sound produced when two leaves are rubbed together), elephant's ears (due to the shape of the leaves) and large rockfoil.
Bergenia is closely related to Mukdenia, Oresitrophe Astilboides and Rodgersia.
The creator of the taxonomic genus name, Conrad Moench, honoured the German botanist and physician Karl August von Bergen by coining the name Bergenia in 1794.

==Species==

==Cultivation==

Bergenia are hardy plants that can grow in climates with extreme temperature ranges from about [tpl]convert|-35|F|C|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|115|F|C|abbr=on[/tpl].  They prefer sun but will grow in shady areas as well.  Plants can grow to about [tpl]convert|24|in|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] tall and [tpl]convert|24|in|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] wide.  They do well in most soils, but moist, humus-rich soil is preferable.  Exposure and dry soils tend to stunt growth, but can enhance the winter leaf colours. In areas with cold, strong winter winds, protection from the wind may be required. They are propagated by division or rooted rhizome sections.
Bergenia crassifolia, Bergenia cordifolia, and various hybrids are often grown in gardens, with several cultivars selected.

==Pests and diseases==

Bergenia are robust plants and generally free of problems, although vine weevil adults readily eat the edges of the leaves, resulting in an indented, 'notched' outline which can detract from the appearance of the plant.

==Uses==

Bergenin, C-glycoside of 4-O-methyl gallic acid, and its O-demethylated derivative norbergenin, are chemical compounds and drugs of Ayurveda, commonly known as Paashaanbhed.
