==History==

The festival began in 1987 as the Rose City Blues Festival, sponsored by the Cascade Blues Association, to benefit the Burnside Community Council's projects for the homeless. The FM community radio station KBOO has broadcast performances from the event, throughout the festival's history. The following year, Oregon Food Share (predecessor of the Oregon Food Bank) becomes the beneficiary of the Rose City Blues Festival, making the event Oregon's first annual blues festival to benefit the hungry. In 1991, the name was changed to the Waterfront Blues Festival. 
The festival celebrated its twentieth anniversary in 2007, earning the Rose City Award from the Portland Oregon Visitors Association and an official U.S. Post Office postmark commemorating the festival. Sponsors of the festival have included Miller Genuine Draft, Albertsons, and Safeway. Throughout its history, the festival has raised millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands pounds of food.
