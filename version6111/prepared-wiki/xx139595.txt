CATEGORIES: Public-key encryption schemes

==Scheme definition==

===Key generation===

A public/private key pair is generated as follows:
The public key is then (n, g, h) and the private key is the factors (p, q).

===Message encryption===

===Message decryption===

==How the system works==

The group
By the uniqueness of H, we must have
We have
So to recover m we just need to take the logarithm with base gp−1, which is accomplished by
