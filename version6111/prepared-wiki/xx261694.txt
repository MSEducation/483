The Blériot 118 was a 1920s French amphibian flying-boat fighter designed by Léon Kirste, only one was built and it was not ordered into production.

==Design and development==

The 118 was developed by Kirste from his earlier Blériot 101 project to meet a French naval requirement for a two-seat fighter.  The 118 was an amphibian flying-boat powered by two Hispano-Suiza 8Ab piston engines.  First flown on 23 January 1925 it was tested by the Navy in competition with other designs but was rejected for being unstable in flight.
