==History==

On 25 May 1870 Alexander Binning Walker, a rural lock-up keeper, chased, confronted and killed the infamous bushranger Fred Ward, alias Captain Thunderbolt, at Kentucky Creek, Uralla.
The rail line from Sydney, as part of the Main North Line, was opened on 2 August 1882, but has been closed for quite a few years now. 
The area was a former soldier settlement region with many orchards and other agricultural properties.  The development of the Kentucky Returned Soldiers Settlement along the  railway between Kentucky and Wollun commenced in July 1918. This settlement covered [tpl]convert|7319|acre|km2[/tpl], mostly of a light sandy granite type soil. The area was divided into eighty holdings of  40 to [tpl]convert|250|acre|km2[/tpl] each depending on the location of the farm. The total orchard area which was planted with apples, pears, prunes, plums and cherries was [tpl]convert|1200|acre|km2[/tpl].Back to Uralla Souvenir, 1925 
The district now has several well-known Merino sheep studs and produces some top super fine wool, as well as quality beef cattle. Apples, cherries, pears and other stone fruit are available from the orchards during the season. The Kentucky Tree Nursery produces many low cost trees and shrubs for farm planting.
Kentucky has two churches, a community hall, general store and a progressive public school. Some of the country gardens are opened to the public through the open gardens scheme and community fund raising schemes. The current population is about 60 persons.
The Kentucky Memorial Hall, in 2008, installed a memorial plaque at the Noalimba Avenue of Honour dedicated to the original soldier settlers and those servicemen and women from the district who enlisted in subsequent conflicts.
About 4Â km to the south of Kentucky is Kentucky South which was a rail siding that opened on 18 October 1926 and closed on 20 February 1975.  Some of the old rail sheds remain there along with several houses.
