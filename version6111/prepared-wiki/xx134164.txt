"Ain't Nobody" is a 1983 hit single by Rufus & Chaka Khan. It was released as a studio bonus track on the band's live album Stompin' at the Savoy. It reached number one on the U.S. R&B chart and 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[tpl]cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=505[/tpl] It has become one of Khan's signature songs.
Rufus keyboardist David "Hawk" Wolinski wrote the song around a repeating synthesizer loop backed by a Linn LM-1 Drum Computer. However, drummer John J.R. Robinson played real drums for the recording session. Legendary producer Quincy Jones (who had previously worked with Rufus) wanted Wolinski to give "Ain't Nobody" to Michael Jackson for the album that would become the blockbuster Thriller, but Wolinski had already promised it to producer Russ Titelman, who ultimately had the band record it as a vocal showcase for Khan.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl]
