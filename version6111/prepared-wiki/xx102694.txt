During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Planet X was a US Army mechanized raid conducted on a village near Ad Dawr and Al Dur, [tpl]convert|11|mi|km[/tpl] north of Tikrit on the night of 15 May 2003 by elements of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, U.S. 4th Infantry Division and Task Force Ironhorse in search of Ba'ath party members and militants. The name of the operation may have been inspired by the cartoon Duck Dodgers in the 24Â½th Century. As a result of this effort a key member of the former regime, Gen. Mahdi Al-Duri Al-Tikrit Adil Abdallah was captured along with 260 other prisoners, his bodyguards and members of his family.
US fighting forces involved roughly 500 soldiers, 18 M2A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, 12 artillery pieces, 30 HMMWVs, and 6 patrol boats.
