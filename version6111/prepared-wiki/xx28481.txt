The Tandy Center Subway operated in Fort Worth, Texas (USA) from February 15, 1963[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/LL/dhlef.html|title=Handbook of Texas Online - Leonard Brothers|accessdate=30 December 2008|date=18 January 2008[/tpl] to August 30, 2002.[tpl]cite web|url=http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~unclejoe/tx/subway.html|title=Preserving Texas History: Tandy Subway|accessdate=30 December 2008|date=31 August 2002[/tpl] It ran a distance of [tpl]convert|0.7|mi|km|1[/tpl] and was, during the period of its operation, the only privately owned subway in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://world.nycsubway.org/us/fortworth/|title=Fort Worth, Texas|accessdate=30 December 2008|year=2005[/tpl]
The subway was originally built by Leonard's Department Store in 1963, connecting the store to its large parking lots on the edge of downtown. Originally known as the Leonard's M&O Subway, it consisted of one underground station beneath the store and four stations in the parking lots.  The Tandy Corporation purchased the department store, its parking lots, and the subway in 1967.  The corporation built its headquarters, the Tandy Center, on the site in 1974.  Although it demolished the original store, Tandy retained the subway.
The small subway primarily served patrons visiting the mall at the base of the Tandy Center, which also linked to the Fort Worth Central Library. However, the anchor tenant moved out in 1995 and the mall declined. The Tandy Center Subway ceased operation on August 30, 2002.
There is at least one car still in operation[tpl]citeweb|url=http://www.mata.org/143specs.htm|title=Car 143: Winnie|accessdate=1 January 2009|date= 11 August 2008[/tpl] that was converted from subway use to street car use that actively services the McKinney Avenue Transit Authority trolley route.
In April 1982 the first PCC streetcar to run the line in 1963, "Leonard's Number 1", was saved from the cutting torch by a Tandy computer programmer and stored on a farm south of Fort Worth where it remained for over 25 years. It was donated to the Leonard's MuseumLeonard's Department Store Museum in 2007.  On February 2, 2008, it was moved to a restoration location near Benbrook, Texas.  After restoration it will be returned to the Leonard's Museum for public display in Fort Worth, Texas.
