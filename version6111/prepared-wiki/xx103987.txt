Infrared observations of this star showed an excess level of radiation equal to about 0.5 magnitudes. This emission is probably from a gaseous disk created by radiation-driven mass loss and rapid rotation of the star. These disks are created by an ejection of material roughly every ten years, which then settles into the equatorial plane about the star. However, the bright nebulosity that surrounds this star makes the observation uncertain.[ref]

Electra is periodically occulted by the Moon and occasionally by other planets in our solar system. The last planetary occultation took place on May 9, 1841, when it was occulted by Venus.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
