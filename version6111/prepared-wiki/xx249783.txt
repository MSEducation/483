With the introduction of the UK Government’s PPG 16 (Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and Planning) in 1990,UK Department of Communities and Local Government the opportunities for amateur societies to undertake invasive archaeology, such as excavations, reduced greatlyUK Government All Party Parliamentary Archaeology Group, APPAG Report, page 15 http://www.appag.org.uk/documents/appag_report.pdf and so the Society has developed its use of non-invasive techniques such as ground resistivity analysis, and expanded its activities towards its other stated goal, that of education.

==Educational activities==

A training programme was created in 2003 in association with Birkbeck College, University of London, in the area of post-excavation analysis. The first instance of this was run under the title “Post-Excavation: Analysis of materials from the Ted Sammes archive”,The Daily Echo and resulted in a book published in 2006 in association with Birkbeck College and the Museum of London entitled “The Last Hendon Farm: The archaeology and history of Church End Farm” (ISBN 0 9503050). This book won a commendation at the British Archaeology Awards (BAA) in 2006 in the section for the Pitt-Rivers Award for the best project by a volunteer organisation.British Archaeology Awards The latest course in this series is entitled “Looking at Finds – A Practical Course in Post-Excavation Studies”, and is tutored by Jacqui Pearce BA, FSA, MlfA, of the Museum of London Archaeological Service (MoLAS).Birkbeck College, University of London Under the UK Government's Equivalent or Lower Qualification regulations (ELQ) the cost of providing this course through Birkbeck College would have increased significantly and it is now provided independently by HADAS."Current Archaeology", Issue 239, February 2010, page 48 In April 2011 HADAS and Jacqui Pearce were jointly awarded the Ralph Merrifield Award for London Archaeology for this course by LAMAS (London and Middlesex Archaeological Society).
Training excavations are performed for local schools, such as Hendon School and St Mary’s CoE High School, Hendon,”The London Archaeologist”, “London Fieldwork and Publication Roundup 2007”, p.2 with the aim of introducing archaeological concepts and skills to young people.“Barnet Times”“Barnet Press”“The Archer”Church Farmhouse Museum These excavations are operated in conjunction with the Widening Participation Initiative of University College London, University of London (UCL), and took place either in the school’s own grounds or in those of the Church Farmhouse Museum in Hendon, a facility that has now closed. Barnet Council voted to withdraw funding from Church Farmhouse Museum, as well as Barnet Museum, from April 2011. The Council’s cabinet met on 13 December 2010 and approved the budget for 2010/2011 which included this proposal. There was a period of public consultation up to 17 January 2011, followed by a final recommendation by the Cabinet in February, as a result of which the museum closed on 31 March 2011.
A programme of monthly lectures on archaeological topics is open to the public.London Borough of Barnet Given by external subject-matter specialists, these take place at Avenue House, Finchley, London N3.
