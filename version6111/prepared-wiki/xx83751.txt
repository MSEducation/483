Fang [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɒ|ŋ[/tpl] is the dominant Bantu language of Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. It is related to the Bulu and Ewondo languages of southern Cameroon. Fang is spoken in northern Gabon, southern Cameroon, and throughout Equatorial Guinea. This language is used in the song Zangalewa which Shakira sampled in her song, "Waka Waka (This Time For Africa)" as a tribute to African music.
