CATEGORIES: Scientology-related controversies, Abuse of the legal system, Criticism of Scientology

Since its inception in 1954, the Church of Scientology has been involved in a number of controversies. When mainstream media outlets have reported alleged abuses, representatives of the church have tended to deny such allegations.[tpl]cite news |first=Joel |last=Sappell |title=On the Offensive Against an Array of Suspected Foes |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientology062990x,0,5646473.story |publisher=Los Aangeles Times |date=June 29, 1990 |accessdate=June 26, 2009[/tpl] Many critics have called into question several of the practices and policies that the Scientology organization has in place in regard to its dealings with its critics and detractors.[tpl]citation |last= Branch |first= Craig |year= 1998 |title= Church of Scientology: A Religious Mafia? |url= http://www.watchman.org/Sci/scientologymafia.htm |work= The Watchmen Expositor |publisher= Watchman Fellowship ministry |volume= 15 |issue= 1 [/tpl]

==Copyright and trademark laws==

The church maintains strict control over the use of its symbols, names and religious texts.[tpl]cite book|title=Teaching New Religious Movements|last=Bromley|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|page=295|isbn=0-19-517729-0[/tpl] It holds copyright and trademark ownership over its cross and has taken legal action against individuals and organizations that have quoted short paragraphs of Scientology texts in print or on web sites. Individuals or groups who practice Scientology without affiliation with the church have been sued for violation of copyright and trademark law.
Although U.S. intellectual property law allows for "fair use" of material for commentary, parody, educational purposes, etc., critics of the church such as Gerry Armstrong have argued that the church unfairly and illegally uses the legal system to suppress "fair" uses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gerryarmstrong.org/50grand/disclaimer.html |title=Gerry Armstrong-Everything Scientology Shysters Need to Know |publisher=Gerryarmstrong.org |date=2002-03-28 |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl]
One example cited by critics is a 1995 lawsuit against the Washington Post newspaper et al. The Religious Technology Center (RTC), the corporation that controls L. Ron Hubbard's copyrighted materials, sued to prevent a Post reporter from describing church teachings at the center of another lawsuit, claiming copyright infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and that the circulation of their "advanced technology" teachings would cause "devastating, cataclysmic spiritual harm" to those not prepared.[tpl]cite book|title=Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age|last=Godwin|first=Mike|publisher=MIT Press|year=2003|page=218|isbn=0-8129-2834-2[/tpl] In her judgment in favor of the Post, Judge Leonie Brinkema noted:

=="Attack the Attacker" policy==

Scientology has a reputation for hostile action toward anyone who criticizes it in a public forum; executives within the organization have proclaimed that Scientology is "not a turn-the-other-cheek religion".[ref]

Many of Scientology's critics have also reported they were subject to threats and harassment in their private lives.[ref][tpl]cite news | first = Richard | last = Behar | authorlink = Richard Behar | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972886,00.html | title = The Scientologists and Me | work = Time | date = 1991-05-06[/tpl]

The organization's actions reflect a formal policy for dealing with criticism instituted by L. Ron Hubbard, called "attack the attacker". Hubbard codified this policy in the latter half of the 1960s in response to government investigations into the organization. In 1966, Hubbard wrote a criticism of the organization's behavior and noted the "correct procedure" for attacking enemies of Scientology:

===Scientology and Me===

In 2007 a BBC documentary on Scientology by reporter John Sweeney came under scrutiny by Scientologists. Sweeney alleged that "While making our BBC Panorama film Scientology and Me I have been shouted at, spied on, had my hotel invaded at midnight, denounced as a 'bigot' by star Scientologists, brain-washed—that is how it felt to me—in a mock up of a Nazi-style torture chamber and chased round the streets of Los Angeles by sinister strangers". This resulted in a video being distributed by Scientologists of a shouting match between Sweeney and Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis.[tpl]cite news | last = Sweeney | first = John| title = Row over Scientology video| publisher = BBC News| date = 14 May 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6650545.stm| accessdate = 2008-11-03[/tpl] The church has reportedly released a DVD that accuses the BBC of organising a demonstration outside a Scientology office in London, during which "terrorist death threats" were made against Scientologists. The BBC described the allegations as "clearly laughable and utter nonsense". Sandy Smith, the BBC programme's producer, commented that the church of Scientology has "no way of dealing with any kind of criticism at all".

===Fair Game===

Hubbard detailed his rules for attacking critics in a number of policy letters, including one often quoted by critics as "the Fair Game policy". This allowed that those who had been declared enemies of the Church, called "suppressive persons" (SPs), "May be deprived of property or injured by any means...May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed". (taken from HCOPL Oct. 18, 1967 Issue IV, Penalties for Lower Conditions )
The aforementioned policy was canceled and replaced by HCOPL July 21, 1968, Penalties for Lower Conditions. The wordings "May be deprived of property or injured by any means...May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed", are not found in this reference.Enquiry into the Practice and Effects of Scientology: Report by Sir John Foster, K.B.E., Q.C., M.P. - Published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, December 1971, Chapter 7 (also referred to as the Foster Report) Scientology critics argue that only the term but not the practice was removed. To support this contention, they refer to "HCO Policy Letter of October 21, 1968" which says, "The practice of declaring people FAIR GAME will cease. FAIR GAME may not appear on any Ethics Order. It causes bad public relations. This P/L does not cancel any policy on the treatment or handling of a SP."[tpl]cite news|first=Tony |last=Ortega |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-12-23/news/double-crossed|title=Double Crossed |work=Phoenix New Times|publisher=New Times Media |date= 1999-12-23|accessdate=2006-06-05 [/tpl]
According to a book by Omar Garrison, HCOPL March 7, 1969, was created under pressure by the government of New Zealand. Garrison quotes from the HCOPL, "We are going in the direction of mild ethics and involvement with the Society". Garrison then states, "It was partly on the basis of these policy reforms that the New Zealand Commission of Inquiry recommended that no legislative action be taken against Scientology".Garrison, Omar PLAYING DIRTY The Secret War Against Beliefs Ralton-Pilot, Los Angeles, 1980 pg 172-173 ISBN 0-931116-04-X The source of Omar Garrison for this is most likely the Dumbleton-Powles Report, additional data and quotations are found in this report.The Commission of Inquiry Into the Hubbard Scientology Organisation in New Zealand; Chairman: Sir Guy Richardson Powles, K.B.E., C.M.G.; Member: E. V. Dumbleton, Esquire, June 1969, page 26
In 1977, top officials of Scientology's "Guardian's Office", an internal security force run by Hubbard's wife, Mary Sue Hubbard, admitted that fair game was policy in the GO. (U.S. v. Kember, Budlong Sentencing Memorandum - Undated, 1981).
In separate cases in 1979 and 1984, attorneys for Scientology argued that the Fair Game policy was in fact a core belief of Scientology and as such deserved protection as religious expression.Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology of California, Court of Appeal of the State of California, civ.no.B023193, 18 July 1989, (courtesy link)

==="Dead agenting"===

In the 1970s, Hubbard continued to codify the policy of "attacking the attacker" and assigned a term to it that is used frequently within Scientology: "dead agenting". Used as a verb, "dead agenting" is described by Hubbard as a technique for countering negative accusations against Scientology by diverting the critical statements and making counter-accusations against the accuser. In other words, "attack the attacker". Hubbard defined the PR (public relations) policy on "dead agenting" in a 1974 bulletin:
The phrase comes from a misunderstanding of the chapter on espionage in The Art of War. The Scientology-sponsored website, religiousfreedomwatch.org, features depictions of so-called "anti-religious extremists", most of them critics of Scientology.[ref]
