==Career==

De Marchi started his career with the Como youth system, and was successively sold to Serie C2 club Ospitaletto, where he made his professional debut. In 1987 he followed his head coach Luigi Maifredi at Serie B fallen giants Bologna, being protagonist of the team's promotion to the top flight and the successive campaign that led the rossoblu back into European football.
In 1990 he followed Maifredi once again, joining Juventus. After an unimpressive debut season, he was successively loaned out to AS Roma for the 1991â€“92 season. After six months back at Juventus from June to December 1992, De Marchi successively agreed for a comeback to Bologna on January 1993, becoming also the team captain and playing there for four more seasons, his last ones as a footballer in Italy. In 1997 he agreed for a move abroad to Eredivisie side Vitesse, and in 2000 he went to Dundee with little success before to retire from active football in 2002.
