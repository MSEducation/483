Bad Girls Club (BGC) is an American reality television series created by Jonathan Murray[tpl]cite web|last=Ho|first=Rodney|title=Interview with Jonathan Murray, creator of "Bad Girls Club Atlantaâ€™ on Oxygen Jan. 15|url=http://blogs.ajc.com/radio-tv-talk/2013/01/15/interview-with-jonathan-murray-creator-of-bad-girls-club-atlanta-on-oxygen-jan-15/|work=Access Atlanta|accessdate=October 30, 2013|date=January 15, 2013[/tpl] for the Oxygen network in the United States.[tpl]cite news|title=MTV Greenlights Additional Seasons of THE CHALLENGE, THE REAL WORLD|url=http://tv.broadwayworld.com/article/MTV-Greenlights-Additional-Seasons-of-THE-CHALLENGE-THE-REAL-WORLD-20120330|accessdate=April 4, 2012|newspaper=MTV News, Broadway World|date=April 1, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Ng|first=Philiana|title=Bunim/Murray Promotes Development Team Behind 'Bad Girls Club'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bunimmurray-promotes-development-team-bad-193966|accessdate=April 4, 2012|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 1, 2011[/tpl] The show focuses on the altercations and physical confrontations of seven highly aggressive, quarrelsome, and unruly women. Each of the women tend to have psychological and behavioral problems. Mischievously sexual and rascally moments are also captured among the women. All seven women have different backgrounds and personalities. They are introduced to the show based off their capacity to be a "charismatic, tough chick." The cast, deemed "bad girls", enjoy a luxurious lifestyle in a fine mansion for three months, during which they must obey specified rules. Their lives inside and outside of the house are chronicled and recorded by the production team.
Bad Girls Club airs in three nations besides the United States; MTV Australia, RTL 5 in The Netherlands, and TV11 in Sweden, and as of December 2013 has not been licensed to a broadcaster in another nation for a local version of the series. The program has been negatively reviewed by critics for the effect it may have on teenagers, and the negative attitudes and remarks of the cast members have caused outrage to some viewers.
The format of the show has changed from early seasons. If a "Bad" Girl breaks a rule, she is evicted from the show and, if it is early in the season, replaced by a new "Bad Girl". The fourth season is considered the series' "breakthrough season", becoming Oxygen's first series ever to average over one million viewers per episode.[tpl]cite web|title=Oxygen's Hit Series "Bad Girls Club" Returns for Fourth Season Premiering Tuesday, December 1 at 10pm ET/PT|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2009/10/13/oxygens-hit-series-bad-girls-club-returns-for-fourth-season-premiering-tuesday-december-1-at-10pm-et-pt-33045/20091013oxygen01/|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=October 30, 2013|date=October 13, 2009[/tpl]
There have been four spin-offs of the Bad Girls Club. Bad Girls Road Trip, Tanisha Gets Married, Love Games: Bad Girls Need Love Too - where past cast members seek true love, and Bad Girls All-Star Battle.
Of all the contestants, Kerry Harvick (of season one) was a successful country singer before the show.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p684674/biography |title=Kerry Harvick's biography |author=Steve Leggett |date=September 22, 2011 |work=Allmusic |publisher=Rovi Corporation [/tpl] Tanisha Thomas (of season two) later hosted Oxygen's OxygenLive! and the subsequent seasons of Love Games: Bad Girls Need Love Too.

As of Season 8, she's also been the host of the Bad Girls Club  and Bad Girls All-Star Battle reunion specials.

==Format==

A central goal of the show has become who can last until the final day. Lasting until the final day without ever being kicked out or leaving for another reason is treated as an impressive feat on the series due to the level of violence and hostility. If the cast members engage in violence towards each other or break other rules, they may or may not be evicted under the show's policy, which is whimsically and fickly enforced by the producers. Security guards apparently live in the house behind the scenes as they jump into camera shot to break up the many violent altercations that break out on the series. Beyond the common occurrence of violence and combat, other reasons for the premature exits of cast members have been fatigue from bullying, ostracism and alienation from the rest of the housemates, problems at home, court proceedings, or their own narcissism. On some occasions, multiple "bad girls" may wish to leave the show; this has happened in all seasons. If a girl departs early in the season, a "replacement Bad Girl" is introduced within one or two episodes. The replacement housemate is commonly hazed, aggressed at, and treated with prejudice.
All or most of the girls typically form cliques between each other; create havoc and antagonize each other; book parties in night clubs; and engage in sexual antics and other mischief, all awhile attempting to maintain their personal lives. Bullying and outnumbering gang attacks (where multiple cast members intimidate one cast member or some other fewer number of cast members) are among regular occurrences on the program. The girls, deemed "bad girls", come from different backgrounds and all different walks of life.[tpl]cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Mike|title=Oxygen Orders Third Season Of 'Bad Girls'|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/134039-Oxygen_Orders_Third_Season_Of_Bad_Girls_.php|work=multichannel|accessdate=September 28, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Hwang|first=Kellie|title=Bad Girls Club casting for season 8|url=http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/bars/articles/2011/05/19/20110519bad-girls-club-love-games-casting-tempe-hooters.html|work=The Arizona Republic|accessdate=September 28, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title=The Bad Girls Club|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932242?refCatId=32|work=Variety|accessdate=November 15, 2011|date=December 4, 2006[/tpl] Earlier on in the series, they'd often try to cope with one another and change their rebellious behavior to become role models for young women.

Throughout the show, the "Bad Girls" must adapt to the frequent mood and behavior changes of their housemates.[tpl]cite book|last=Oppliger|first=Patrice A.|title=Girls gone skank: the sexualization of girls in American culture|year=2008|publisher=McFarland & Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=0-7864-3522-4|page=258[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title=First season of 'The Bad Girls Club'|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932242?refCatId=32|work=Variety|accessdate=September 28, 2011|date=December 4, 2006[/tpl] The girls must undergo interviews in reality TV confessionals. They are allowed to contact their families and friends using landline telephones and a computer connected to a large-screen television; however, the cast is prohibited from watching nationally and locally televised programming and using mobile phones.
The Bad Girls Club creed, introduced in season three, is:

===Seasons 1 and 2===

The format for the first season of Bad Girls Club was different from that of subsequent seasons.[tpl]cite journal|last=Fernandez|first=Julio|title=Bad Girls? Or Bad Wast??|journal=Pierce County Herald|date=April 16, 2011|accessdate=September 28, 2011[/tpl] The age range for season one was from 21 to 31. The use of nicknames was not introduced until the third season. Season one was the first in which multiple "replacement Bad Girls" entered the show.
Although there were differences in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one was the way the show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of who is going to be the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.
In the second season, the format of the show changed drastically. The maximum age dropped from 31 to 27. The cast of season two were given mandatory non-profit jobs to help them build a work ethic and to experience the stabilizing effect of being interdependent with others, for example in teamwork and commitment, to equip them for success in later life.[tpl]cite journal|last=Williams|first=James|title=Ratings Success for Oxygen's Bad Girls Club|journal=The Cheney Free Press|date=October 18, 2009|accessdate=September 28, 2011[/tpl] Quitting the job or failure to attend resulted in mandatory removal from the show. The girls were given the jobs of planning, decision making, and building cooperation. Season two was the first and only season of the Bad Girls Club to do this, and was also the last to air 30-minute episodes.

===Live shows===

On August 3, 2010, during the OxygenLive TV recap episode, the show combined Facebook and Twitter with a live broadcast. Fans submitted opinions and comments about the show and its cast, which were aired during the 10Â pm hour.[tpl]cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/08/04/oxygens-bad-girls-club-miami-is-1-program-on-cable-with-women-18-34/59143 |title=Oxygen's "Bad Girls Club Miami" is #1 program on cable with Women 18-34 |author=|date=August 3, 2010 |work=|publisher=TVbythenumbers |accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl]
In January 2011, Oxygen released OxygenLive!, an online talk show hosted by Tanisha Thomas, one of the "bad girls" of season two. It was broadcast after season six debuted on Oxygen, and focused on the cast of season six, occasionally bringing in "Bad Girls" from earlier seasons. Thomas asked the girls several questions to prompt rumors and confessions.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oxygenlive.com/ |title=OxygenLive.com |date= |work=|publisher=Oxygen.com |accessdate=February 6, 2011[/tpl]

'" She also commented that the show gives a "distorted picture" of how to live the good life, calling the cast "wannabes" who are "sleeping in a mansion they can't pay for". Mitchell believes that most people know the cast are living "a bogus lifestyle", and assesses the message of the Bad Girls Club as "disturbing".

Brian Lowry of Variety thought that the producers made the "wrong decision" when they created the show. He believed that the cast of Bad Girls Club auditioned for the show for their "15 minutes of fame". He said that Bad Girls Club "arrived a little late in this game, on a channel lacking the kind of exposure or public footprint to qualify the show even as the stuff guilty pleasures are made of". Lowry believed that the show "loses" and that Oxygen attracts viewers who generally get drunk at bars and make a scene. He also suggested that "maybe it's time to "BAG" these bad-attitude girls and beat a hasty retreat back to the real world".
Anita Gates of The New York Times referred to Bad Girls Club as "a great argument for bringing back programming with actors". She believed that the "average emotional age" appeared to be 15, in contrast to the girls' real ages. She stated that the "unpleasant villains cancel one another out and actually make badness uninteresting", commenting that their behavior might not be "bad enough". Gates concluded by suggesting that Bad Girls Club is the on-location equivalent of The Jerry Springer Show.[tpl]cite news|last=Gates|first=Anita|title=Graduating From Bad to Worse as an Adventure in Self-Help|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/arts/television/05gate.html|accessdate=November 15, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 5, 2006[/tpl] Kelly West of Cinemablend stated that Bad Girls Club is "so much fun to watch".[tpl]cite web|last=West|first=Kelly|title=TV Review: The Bad Girls ClubÂ â€” Season 2 Premiere|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/TV-Review-The-Bad-Girls-Club-Season-2-Premiere-7612.html|work=Cinemablend|accessdate=November 15, 2011[/tpl]

==Controversies==

===Season 4===

During "Off The Wall", the first episode of the fourth season, Natalie Nunn told Annie Andersen that Chris Brown was at a night club that she wanted to attend, and asked Anderson if she was a fan. Anderson said not, because of the domestic violence case that Brown was involved in. Nunn defended Brown, saying "Who cares, Rihanna was a punk bitch, and she got her ass beat for a reason".[tpl]cite web|title=PP2G gossip;Say What: Mr. Steal Yo Girl Trey Songz gespot met Amber Rose in #Ghana, #WWW Waar was Wiz|url=http://www.pp2g. com/News/12479/PP2G-gossipSay-What-Mr-Steal-Yo-Girl-Trey-Songz-gespot-met-Amber-Rose-in-Ghana-WWW-Waar-was-Wiz|work=PP2G|accessdate=September 27, 2011|language=Ductch[/tpl] Nunn called Rihanna a "crazy bitch" and claimed to know her, unlike Anderson.

===Season 5===

During the episode "The Wicked Witch Of Key West", a stranger at a bar offered to buy drinks for Kristen Guinane and Christina Marie Hopkins. He spiked the drinks with PCP hallucinogenic pills, and Guinane became intoxicated. She claimed to have suffered bruises on her body when the man grabbed her and handled her roughly. Guinane reported that the producers of the show did not want to identify the man on television for fear of a lawsuit. She blamed the drug for her hitting cast-member, Lea Beaulieu, in the face, leading to a fight.
While Hopkins was intoxicated, one of her friends recorded her making racial slurs about an African American woman who had threatened her. The video surfaced on the Internet and outraged many people.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tmz.com/2011/05/13/bad-girls-club-oxygen-network-christina-hopkins-racist-rant-mexican-food/ |title=Oxygen Network BANS 'Bad Girls Club' Star |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=September 22, 2011 |work= |publisher=TMZ.com[/tpl] Oxygen told TMZ.com that Hopkins would never appear on their channel again.

===Season 6===

During season six production, residents of Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, complained that noise levels and swearing were unbearable and inappropriate for them and their children to listen to during the night.[tpl]cite news |title='Bad Girls Club' Experience May Hinder Local Production Push |author=Doug Kriegel |url=http://shermanoaks.patch.com/articles/bad-girls-club-experience-may-hinder-local-production-push#video-3837952 |newspaper=Sherman Oaks Patch |date=December 28, 2010 |accessdate=April 23, 2011[/tpl] The residents called local law enforcement agencies four or five times to deal with the late-night disturbances. Clarissa Keller, a Sherman Oaks resident, complained that she had a six-year-old son and didn't want him to listen to the swearing. She set up a petition calling for a ban on all production companies in the Sherman Oaks hills. Location managers and production crew declined to discuss the neighbors' complaints.
The Bad Girls Club permit required the entire production to abide by a "minimum outdoor activity and noise" rule, but local residents claimed that the show did not keep noise levels down. The house for season six was rented for $20,000 a month. The owner said that he would not allow this type of production to rent his home in the future.

===Season 7===

On March 13, 2011, TMZ.com reported that the cast was banned from at least eight clubs that "didn't want to be associated with the show's bad image", and that they were excluded from Pierre Thomas's Mardi Gras party at The Metropolitan Night Club.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tmz.com/2011/03/13/bad-girls-club-new-orleans-trashy-night-club-banned-bad-reputation-bars-metropolitan-pierre-thomas/|title=â€˜Bad Girls Clubâ€™ -- Too â€˜Trashyâ€™ for New Orleans|work=TMZ.com|publisher=Time Warner|date=March 13, 2011|accessdate=May 28, 2011[/tpl]
On April 12, 2011, cast member Tasha Malek complained to an on-duty police officer outside the Bad Girls house about the conduct of fellow cast member Nastasia Townsend.
