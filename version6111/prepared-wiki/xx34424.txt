The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle is the second album by Bruce Springsteen and the as-yet-unnamed E Street Band, and is described by Allmusic as "one of the greatest albums in the history of rock & roll." It was released in 1973. The album includes the song "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", the band's most-used set-closing song for the first 10 years of its career.
As with Springsteen's first album, it was well-received critically but had little commercial success at the time. However, once Springsteen achieved popularity with Born to Run, several selections from this album became popular FM radio airplay and concert favorites.
In 2003, the album was ranked number 132 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[tpl]cite book |chapter=132 | The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle - Bruce Springsteen |chapterurl=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/the-wild-the-innocent-and-the-e-street-shuffle-bruce-springsteen-19691231 |accessdate=[tpl]date|2006-04-14[/tpl] |last=Levy |first=Joe |coauthors=Steven Van Zandt |title=Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time |origyear=2005 |edition=3rd |year=2006 |publisher=Turnaround |location=London |isbn=1-932958-61-4 |oclc=70672814 |ref=RS500[/tpl]  On November 7, 2009, Springsteen and the E Street Band played the album in its entirety for the first time ever in a concert at Madison Square Garden.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2009/11/bruce_springsteen_to_perform_e.html|publisher=nj.com|title=Bruce Springsteen to perform entire albums at Madison Square Garden shows|accessdate=11 April 2012|date=3 November 2009[/tpl]

==Background==

The E Street Band is known to have taken its name from David Sancious' home in Belmar, New Jersey.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/insidejersey/index.ssf/2009/05/bruce_rocked_here.html|publisher=nj.com|title=Bruce Springsteen Rocked Here|last=Goldstein|first=Stan|date=15 May 2009|accessdate=13 April 2012[/tpl] The back photo on the album has the six band members standing in a doorway.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goldminemag.com/tag/david-sancious|title=E Street should lead directly to the Rock Hall of Fame|publisher=Goldmine|date=19 May 2011|accessdate=15 April 2012[/tpl] The picture was of an antique store on Sairs Ave in the West End section of Long Branch, New Jersey. The building was down the street from West End Elementary School, and for years was Tommy Reeds bicycle repair shop and penny candy store; it has since been demolished and its former location is occupied by a parking lot.

==Reception==

When released, the album was greeted with critical acclaim and has been referred to in The Rolling Stone Album Guide as Springsteen's "first triumph" but sales were slow. Allmusic rated the album with 5 stars pointing to the second side of the album as a "flawless piece of music" and of the album as a whole as "one of the greatest albums in the history of rock & roll". Ken Emerson with Rolling Stone  noted that even with an "occasional weak spot or an awkward transition" the album "works spectacularly". Robert Christgau rated it an A- and called the music "a funky, vivacious rock and roll that's too eager and zany ever to be labeled tight..." Sputnikmusic gave it a 4.5 star rating and described it as "a grand fusion of nostalgic Rock 'n' Roll and soulful R&B".
