==Early life==

Miller attended John Muir High School in Pasadena, California, where he was a track standout, competing in the 400-meter, long jump and relay events.  He joined the football team at the urging of Coach Jim Brownfield, but played only one year, catching 13 passes for 230 yards and 2 touchdowns.  While he initially accepted a track scholarship from San Diego State, he transferred to Pasadena City College when SDSU coaches refused to allow him to play football in addition to running track.Chris Baker, "It Doesn't Take Long for Anthony Miller to Kick In," Los Angeles Time, 13 November 1989. Retrieved: 25 July 2013.
Miller's break-out year at Pasadena City came in 1985, when he caught 47 passes for 881 yards and 9 touchdowns, rushed once for 63 yards and a touchdown, and returned 25 kickoffs for 786 yards.  His 1,728 all-purpose yards led all California junior college players, and he was named to the junior college All-American team."1987 Tennessee Squad," 1987 Tennessee Volunteers Football Guide (University of Tennessee, 1987), p. 84.

Miller played at Tennessee during an era when the school garnered its reputation as "Wide Receiver U," with receivers such Anthony Hancock, Willie Gault and Tim McGee preceding Miller as 1st-round NFL draft picks.  Three of Miller's teammates in the Vol receiving corps— Joey Clinkscales, Alvin Harper and Anthony Morgan— would also become NFL draftees.  Despite consistent competition for playing time, Miller amassed 765 yards and 5 touchdowns on 47 catches in just 17 games for the Vols, and returned 25 kickoffs for 547 yards.Tennessee Career Football Statistics, UTSports.com.

Splitting time with the veteran Clinkscales during the 1986 season, Miller caught 36 passes for a team-leading 667 yards and 5 touchdowns, and returned 24 kickoffs for 522 yards.  In his debut against New Mexico, he caught 5 passes for 80 yards, and caught 5 passes for 66 yards in his SEC debut against Mississippi State.  In Tennessee's loss to Auburn, Miller provided the Vols' lone touchdown, catching a screen pass from Randy Sanders and racing 60 yards to the end zone."Dismal Day on the Plains," 1987 Tennessee Volunteers Football Guide (University of Tennessee, 1987), p. 100.  Miller caught a 70-yard touchdown pass and returned 6 kickoffs for a school-record 126 yards in Tennessee's loss to Alabama.

He caught 6 passes for 72 yards in Tennessee's 21-14 win over Minnesota in the 1986 Liberty Bowl.
During the 1987 season, Miller injured his knee in the opener against Iowa, and struggled with injuries throughout the season.Mike Strange, "Tennessee Scouting Report: The Passing Game," 1988 Peach Bowl Program, p. 9.  Playing sparingly in just six games, he finished the regular season with 11 catches for 98 yards, and returned only one kickoff for 25 yards.
