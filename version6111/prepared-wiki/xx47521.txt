Trowbridge [tpl]IPAc-en|'|t|r|oʊ|b|r|ɪ|dʒ[/tpl] is the county town of Wiltshire, England on the Biss in the west of the county, [tpl]convert|8|mi[/tpl] south east of Bath, Somerset, from which is it separated by the Mendip Hills which rise [tpl]convert|3|mi[/tpl] to the west.
Trowbridge has a railway station on the Wessex Main Line.  On 5 September 1848, the first train steamed through as the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway was established. Long a market town, the Kennet and Avon canal runs to the north of Trowbridge and played an instrumental part in the town's development as it enabled coal to be transported from the Somerset Coalfield and so marked the advent of steam-powered manufacturing in woollen cloth mills. The town was foremost producer of this mainstay of contemporary clothing and blankets in south west England in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by which time it held the nickname "The Manchester of the West".[tpl]cite web |url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcom.php?id=228 |title=Wiltshire Council – Wiltshire Community History Get Community Information |publisher=history.wiltshire.gov.uk |accessdate=4 March 2011 [/tpl]

==History==

===Toponymy===

The origin of the name Trowbridge is uncertain; one source claims derivation from treow-brycg, meaning "Tree Bridge", referring to the first bridge over the Biss,Town Official Guide, Trowbridge Town Council, 2008Origins of the name Trowbridge: Strum.co.uk website. Retrieved on 25 January 2008. while another states that the true meaning is the bridge by Trowle, the name of a hamlet and a common to the west of the town. On John Speed's map of Wiltshire (1611), the name is spelt Trubridge.

==Ancient history and the Domesday Book==

There is evidence that the land on which Trowbridge is built was being farmed  more than 3,000 years ago.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] In the 10th century written records and architectural ruins begin marking Trowbridge's existence as a village.  In the Domesday Book the village of Straburg, as Trowbridge was then known, was recorded as having 24 households, very well endowed with land, particularly arable ploughlands, and rendering 8 pounds sterling to its feudal lord a year.Domesday Map

===Castle===

The first mention of Trowbridge Castle was in 1139 while it was besieged.First mention of Trowbridge Castle: Local Authority Publishing website. Retrieved on 25 January 2008.

===Woollen cloth industry===

Trowbridge developed as a centre for woollen cloth production from the 14th century.
Thus before the start of the reign of the first Tudor monarch, Henry VII of England, the towns of south-west Wiltshire stood out from the rest of the county with all the signs of increasing wealth and prosperity during the period of trade recovery led by exports begun under Yorkist Edward IV and, still more, during expansion under Henry, when England's annual woollen exports increased from some 60,000 to some 80,000 cloths of assize.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=102811 |title=The woollen industry before 1550 |author=Elizabeth Crittall (editor) |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1959 |work=A History of the County of Wiltshire: Volume 4 |accessdate=27 September 2013 [/tpl]
As the 17th century progressed the process became increasingly industrialised. However, mechanisation was resisted by workers in traditional trades and there were riots in 1785, 1792 and in the era of luddism owing to the introduction of the flying shuttle.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/llt/55/horn.html | title = Machine-breaking in England and France during the Age of Revolution | accessdate = 16 March 2008[/tpl] Thomas Helliker, a shearman's apprentice, became one of the martyrs of the Industrial Revolution in 1803 when he was hanged at Fisherton Jail Salisbury. Nevertheless at one point in 1820 Trowbridge's scale of production was such that it resulted in it being described as the "Manchester of the West". It had over 20 woollen cloth producing factories, making it comparable to Northern industrial towns such as Rochdale.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.trowbridge.gov.uk/business.asp?id=222 | title = Economic History | accessdate = 16 March 2008[/tpl] The woollen cloth industry declined in the late 19th century with the advent of ring-spinning and this decline continued throughout the 20th century. However, Trowbridge's West of England cloth maintained a reputation for excellent quality until the end. The last mill, Salter's Home Mill, closed in 1982 and is now the home of Boswell's Cafe' and Trowbridge Museum and Art Gallery,The Trowbridge Woollen Industry as Illustrated by the Stock Books of John and Thomas Clark, 1804–1824, John Clark & Thomas Clark & R. P. Beckinsale, Wiltshire Record Society/Biddles Ltd, 1973. integrated into The Shires Shopping Centre.The Museum portrays the history of woollen cloth production in the town and displays include an extremely rare Spinning Jenny one of only 5 remaining worldwide. There are also working looms on display.  Clark's Mill is now home to offices and the County Court; straddling the nearby River Biss is "The Handle House", formerly used for drying and storage of teazles used to raise the nap of cloth. This is one of very few such buildings still known to exist in the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web | url = http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getfaq.php?id=507 | title = Wiltshire History Questions Search Results | date = 26 April 2007 | accessdate = 8 November 2010[/tpl]; although another example can be found at Bowlish near Shepton Mallet.

===1800s to present===

In its place a bedding industry developed, initially using wool cast off from the mills – the company now known as Airsprung Furniture Group PLC was started in the town in the 1870s. Food production also developed in the town when Abraham Bowyer started his business in 1805 which eventually, as Pork Farms Bowyers, became one of the largest employers in the town until closure in April 2008 when production moved to the Shaftesbury and Nottingham factories.
The town became the county town of Wiltshire in 1889 when Wiltshire County Council was formed and needed a place where representatives from Swindon and Salisbury, among others, could reach and return home in one day. Trowbridge fulfilled this criterion by dint of its railway connections and thus evolved as the county town, further reinforced by the construction of the county hall in 1939.Wiltshire Council - Wiltshire Community History Get Wiltshire History Question Information
The brewing company Ushers of Trowbridge opened in 1824, and developed the brewery in the town – this was finally shut in 2000 following several changes of ownership. Food production continues in the town through companies such as frozen food processor Apetito. The largest employers in the town are Wiltshire Council, and Apetito.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]

==Demography==

The first official census of 1801 showed Trowbridge having 5,799 inhabitants, which rose very rapidly to 9,545 in 1821.  The population rose by less than 50% in the 130 years to 1951, compared to a considerably larger increase in the population of the country as a whole.  No census was taken in 1941 due to World War II. From 1951 to 2011, the population increased by 133%.  Coinciding with this increase a considerable conversion of arable fields and some riverside meadows to residential estates took place.Population from 1801 until 1961 from Vision of Britain Retrieved 2013-10-02.
While the proportion of people in 2011 who identified themselves as within an ethnic minority is lower than the average for England, at 11.7% (compared with 20.2%), approximately 1% of the population (0.93%) described themselves to be in the mixed/multiple ethnic group: white and black Caribbean, with the next largest minority being of black caribbean ethnicity and descent. In order of percentage, the next largest minority are people of ethnicity which is 'other Asian' which does not refer to India, China, Pakistan or Bangladesh but to other Asian countries, outside of the Arab ethnicity area, which in turn falls one place behind this classification.  Although this fourth group accounted in 2011 for less than 0.4% of the population, Trowbridge has one of the highest demographics of Moroccan birth or ancestry in the United Kingdom outside of London.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/1203593.pdf | format= PDF | title= Understanding Muslim Ethnic Communities – The Moroccan Muslim Community in England | work=Change Institute |date=April 2009 | publisher=Communities and Local Government[/tpl]
