==Acting==

===Soap opera and serial roles===

Chappell's first daytime appearance was as a day player on All My Children in 1989. In a July 2006 interview in industry magazine Soap Opera Digest, Chappell recalled actor Maurice Benard helping her through her first scenes.
After a brief run on Santa Barbara in 1990, (she played a classmate of Eden's who died of an ice overdose), Chappell was cast as Dr. Carly Manning Alamain (Katerina von Leuschner) on Days of Our Lives. She portrayed the role from June 1990 to October 1993. Chappell and future husband Michael Sabatino met on Days of our Lives, where he played villain Lawrence Alamain. Chappell was front-burner for most of her time on the show, first when her character Carly was featured in a romance with lead character Bo Brady (Peter Reckell, Robert Kelker-Kelly), and then in a complex, Byzantine storyline that featured her heretofore unknown secret identity as a European blueblood. The story culminated in a controversial plot that had Carly buried alive by Lawrence's aunt Vivian (Louise Sorel). Chappell left after difficult contract negotiations and differences with head writer James E. Reilly.
Chappell's next role was as Maggie Carpenter on One Life to Live from October 1995 through September 1997. The character of Maggie was created for Chappell, and she was again paired with a romantic lead on the show, Max Holden (James DePaiva). Her main storyline revolved around the tension between her burgeoning romantic relationship and her plans to profess vows as a nun. The character was eventually written out.
From July 2, 1999 to September 18, 2009, she played complex villainess/anti-heroine Olivia Spencer on Guiding Light. The role of Olivia was initially only intended to be a short-term role, but Chappell's portrayal was so popular she was signed to a contract.
She won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Daytime Drama for her work as Olivia in 2002 and was nominated again in the same category in 2005 and 2006. In 2007, she earned her first nomination in the Outstanding Lead Actress category.
In 2009, her character Olivia Spencer and Jessica Leccia's character Natalia Rivera were involved in the hugely popular same sex pairing, Otalia, which saw two presumably heterosexual women move from sworn enemies to a close friendship, to eventually, after a long period of dramatic angst, admitting their feelings towards each other and becoming a couple. The coupling of Otalia was embraced by fans and critics alike, and named a 'super-couple' by Nelson Branco, of TV Guide Canada and writes "In an age of contrived and soulless couples, Olivia and Natalia’s burgeoning romance felt natural, innocent, and most importantly, real." The final episodes of Guiding Light saw Natalia and Olivia move in and start a family together.
Chappell returned to her role on Days of Our Lives in September 2009 and begin airing in October.http://tvguidemagazine.com/soaps/exclusive-guiding-lights-crystal-chappell-returns--1403.html  In May 2011, her contract was not renewed and her character ended its run in late summer.
Following the phenomenal success of the pairing Otalia on Guiding Light, Chappell is currently producing the third season of her 2011 Emmy winning webseries, Venice: the Series, along with her friend and writing partner Kim Turrisi, which centers around the life of Gina (Chappell), a gay interior designer living in Venice Beach, California. Chappell stars alongside ex Guiding Light castmates Jessica Leccia as Ani, Gina's ex; Jordan Clarke as The Colonel, Gina's homophobic father; Galen Gering as Owen, Gina's brother; and Gina Tognoni as Sami, Owen's love interest. The show began airing in December 2009 and won the first Emmy for an online format in 2011.  A third season of Venice was released at the end of November 2011 and is available for view via a small subscription fee at venicetheseries.com.
Chappell is currently working on creating a new soap webseries called 'The Grove,' with her husband, Michael Sabatino, which is slated to air in early 2012.  She is also working on an autobiography of her experiences as a daytime soap opera actress. Chappell was announced to be joining the cast of The Bold and the Beautiful as Danielle, who will be featured in the first gay storyline for the show.[tpl]cite web |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/04/11/lesbian-storyline-coming-to-bold-and-the-beautiful-exclusive/ |title=Lesbian Storyline Coming to Bold and the Beautiful |author=InsideTV.EW.com |accessdate=April 11, 2011 |date=2012-04-11[/tpl]

===Contract controversy===

In 2005, Chappell was ambivalent about re-signing to Guiding Light, as her storyline had ebbed considerably. Shortly after re-signing her contract, she was offered the front-burner role of Paige on One Life to Live. Since Guiding Light had recently cut a number of its actors from the cast roster, Chappell met with the producers to see if she could be released from her contract with Guiding Light.
The show ultimately refused. In a July 2006 interview with Soap Opera Digest, Chappell indicated that, while there are no hard feelings, she wasn't sure why the show was so eager to keep Olivia as a character, since the character had not been used much, particularly since the pairing of Olivia and Phillip ended.

===Other roles===

Chappell has also made appearances in the prime time shows Poltergeist: The Legacy, Silk Stalkings, Pensacola: Wings of Gold, and Burke's Law.

==Personal life==

Chappell was born in Silver Spring, Maryland, and attended Arundel High School. She subsequently attended the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. She was married to Scott Fanjoy from 1988 to 1991. She has been married to actor Michael Sabatino since January 6, 1997. They have two children, Jacob Walker (born May 11, 2000) and Dylan Michael (born September 2, 2003).
