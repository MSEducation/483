Elected as a Democrat to the Sixty-third, Sixty-fourth, and Sixty-fifth Congresses (March 4, 1913 – March 3, 1919).[tpl]sfn|Biographical|p=1362[/tpl] In the Sixty-fifth Congress, Keating was chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Post Office Department. He was unsuccessful in his bid for reelection in 1918.
In 1916, along with Robert Owen, sponsored a bill called the Keating-Owen Act,which barred the interstate commerce of goods produced by children. Shortly after the act went into effect it was declared unconstitutional; nevertheless it is regarded as an historic landmark in the story of the regulation of child labor in the United States.  Several states already had child labot laws but these varied widely.  Although bills regulating child labor had been introduced in previous congressional sessions they didn't pass.  The Keating-Owen bill was the first to become a law and thus became the first federal intervention in the tackling of the child labor problem. (Later many of the provisions of the Keating-Owen Act were incorportated into other labor legislation which was upheld by the Supreme Court.) 	
In 1919 introduced the Keating War Powers Bill to regulate child labor in certain industries.
