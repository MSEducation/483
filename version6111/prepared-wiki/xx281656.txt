==Remodeling of the station building==

A neo-baroque entrance building with two storeys was built in 1914. It is now a monument on the Märkische Straße Technischer Kulturdenkmäler (“Märkische technical heritage road”). Since July 2011, the station has been extensively renovated by the Werdohl municipality. The renovation is expected to cost a total of around €2.3 million. In addition, the main entrance is currently being modified to provide barrier-free access.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.derwesten.de/staedte/werdohl/Startschuss-fuer-Sanierung-id4867901.html |newspaper= Westfälischen Rundschau |date=13 July 2011 |title=Eingerüstet - Startschuss für Sanierung|accessdate=10 August 2013  |language=German[/tpl]
