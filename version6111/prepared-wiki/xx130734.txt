Snowboarding is a sport that has been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/disciplines_uk.asp?DiscCode=SB|title=Snowboarding|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=2009-06-21[/tpl] Snowboarding was one of five new sports or disciplines added to the Winter Olympic programme between 1992 and 2002, and was the only one not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event. In 1998, four events, two for men and two for women, were held in two specialities: the giant slalom, a downhill event similar to giant slalom skiing; and the half-pipe, in which competitors perform tricks while going from one side of a semi-circular ditch to the other.[tpl]Cite web|title=Snowboarding History|url=http://www.fieldday.com/cbc/olympics/sports/snowboarding/history/index.html|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2009-06-21[/tpl] Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the men's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/09/sports/xviii-winter-games-snowboarding-young-hip-sport-zigzags-into-olympic-mainstream.html|title=Young, Hip Sport Zigzags Into the Olympic Mainstream|author=Berkow, Ira|date=1998-02-09|accessdate=2009-06-21|work=The New York Times[/tpl] Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after testing positive for marijuana.
