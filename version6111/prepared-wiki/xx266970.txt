The United States Navy Reserve Midshipmen's School, known as the Navy College Training Program, V-7, was announced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on June 26, 1940, to recruit 36,000 naval reserve officers to command the vastly-expanding fleet in preparation for the war effort. The majority of the junior officers who graduated from the schools were dedicated to operations in the Far East, known as the Pacific Theater during World War II. 
During the years 1940 to 1945, graduates of the V-12 Navy College Training Program; whose purpose was to grant bachelor's degrees to future officers, as well as "increased numbers" of enlisted men from the naval fleet, attended the new officer training midshipmen's schools which were located on several college campuses around the country. The apprentice seamen attended the program for 90-days after successful completion of a 30-day indoctrination course. Graduates of the schools were commissioned as ensigns in the U.S. Naval Reserve and the majority entered into active duty with the U.S. fleet.[tpl]cite news |title=Ohio Has 14 Among Navy Reserve Grads |newspaper=Steubenville Herald Star |location=Steubenville, Ohio |first= |last=|date=December 12, 1940| accessdate=September 19, 2011[/tpl]

==History==

This program of voluntary training was announced on June 26, 1940, by the President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Applicants were between the age of 19 and 27 and were required to meet the same "rigid physical requirements" as midshipmen in the United States Naval Academy. The candidates were listed as apprentice seamen in the Naval Reserve of the United States in a class designated as V-7. Midshipmen were required to have either a college degree, or the equivalent in practical experience, or to have successfully completed the Navy V-12 college curriculum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ref/Seamanship/Seamanship-2.html |title = Naval Organization |accessdate=September 19, 2011 |work=|publisher=ibiblio, 2011[/tpl]
The goal of the program was to train 36,000 young officers quickly in order to meet the demands of the expanding naval fleet in preparation for World War II. By March 1941, the Navy had only 18,000 officer personnel. Most of the officers who were commissioned were dedicated to operations in the Far East where the navy was "forced to bear the full burden in the event of war."
The first class in the program was graduated from the reserve midshipmen's school in the battleship USS Illinois (BB-7) in New York City and 232 of the 264 commissioned junior officers reported for active duty. During December 1940, the second class to be commissioned in the midshipmen program graduated from Northwestern University as did the third and fourth classes in 1941. The fifth class was graduated from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

===V-7 program===

In 1940, the V-7 program "was offered to any college junior or senior." Candidates were required to enlist in the Naval Reserve and following a one-month indoctrination course as apprentice seaman, they attended a three-month course in the midshipmen's school. Upon completion of the program, candidates were awarded an ensign's commission and placed in active status. Instruction was provided in ordnance and gunnery, seamanship, navigation and engineering.  
During 1941, admission requirements were changed and applicants were required to have attained a college degree as well as one course in plane trigonometry and one additional year of mathematics. The final deadline for college juniors, seniors and graduates who were single and under age 28 to sign up was May 1, 1942. After that day, only applicants between 17 and 20 where eligible for the program and they were enlisted in Class V-1 to complete their college courses.[tpl]cite news |title=V-7 Navy Program Plan Deadline Set |newspaper=Port Arthur News |location=Port Arthur, Texas |first= |last= |date=April 10, 1942| accessdate=September 22, 2011[/tpl]
The Navy announced on August 25, 1945, that no more students would be permitted to enter the naval reserve midshipmen (V-7) program. At that time, 5,000 midshipmen were in training and were permitted to complete their courses at Columbia University, University of Notre Dame, Cornell University and at Fort Schuyler in New York State, as well as the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland.[tpl]cite news |title=Enlistments Ended in Navy V-7 Program |newspaper=San Mateo Times |location=San Mateo, California |first= |last= |date=August 25, 1945| accessdate=September 22, 2011[/tpl]

====Northwestern University====

The U.S. Naval Reserves Midshipmen's School at Northwestern University was established in September 1940, and was in operation until 1945.
