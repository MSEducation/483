==Career==

Filippos Pliatsikas was born in Athens and has been involved in music from the age of 12.

His solo career since 2004 has been equally impressive and his albums continue to reach gold and platinum sales. Songs like “Ti Den Emathe O Theos”, “Taxidevontas Me Allo Ixo- recorded from the live performance from Athens Concert Hall “Megaron” with the ERT classical orchestra of Contemporary Music, “Ena Vrohero Taxi”, the album “Omnia” which included tracks like “Poios Exei Logo Stin Agapi”, “An Tha Mporousa To Kosmo Na Allaza”, “Poli Hioni” and more.

Filippos has appeared in many concerts both in Greece and abroad and continues to do so.
In 2005 & 2006 he collaborated with Lavrentis Mahairitsas and Dionusis Tsaknis in shows all over Greece. This two-year collaboration ended with a big show called “25 years – Our Rock” with guests from all the most important singers in the industry. In the summer of 2006, Filippos took part in a road festival called “Oneiro Electricis Nihtas” travelled all over Greece with Manolis Famellos, ONAR, Theodoris Kontakos (Kos K) 
In the spring of 2007, Filippos releases one of his most successful albums to date in his personal career called “Omnia”. This platinum album put Filippos in a higher league in terms of his live performances. This was seen in his three sold out concerts with the Contemporary Orchestra of ERT in Greece’s renowned Lycabettus theatre where 22.000 fans justify his journey and choice. In the winter of 2008, he toured all over Greece and Cyprus with Vasilis Kazoulis where more than 100.000 fans attend these successful shows. 
In 2009 he releases his next album “Ballerinas Epitreponte” and he tours in 10 European cities: London, Leicester, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Munich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Nicosia and Lemesos. In the same year he kicked off his summer tour in the Karaiskaki Stadium with Sinead O'Connor and guest starring: Maraveyal Illegal, Gordon Gano (Violent Femmes) and MC Yinka. At the end of 2010, he released his album “Tin Alitheia Na Po” which was distributed for free via the internet, something done for the first time in the Greek music industry. This album included 15 tracks which portrayed his truth, his reality. He experimented with various sounds and by using a Gospel choir from San Diego mixed with musicians from Ipirus he managed to make his songs a journey once again. In light of the album he performed shows in December 2010 to the spring of 2011. In 2011, Pyx Lax reunited. These old friends reunited on stage for a series of shows. This was considered the music event of the year. They travelled to the biggest cities in Greece and presented a show unlike one ever performed in Greece before. This was the case as it broke the record of the most ticket sales ever sold by Greek artists. The highlights of the tour were in the Olympic Stadium in Athens which had an audience of 80.000 people and in the Kaftatsogleio Stadium in Thesaloniki with an audience of 50.000 people. The Pix Lax tour came to an end with three shows in America (New York, Chicago, Boston) and one in Canada (Toronto) which were performed in historic venues (Terminal 5 and House of Blues). In March 2012, Filippos released his new album titled “Prosoxi sto Keno”and the song “Pou na pame” has already started its own journey. Filippos is currently getting ready for his summer tour which starts on 30 May and Eleonora Zouganeli will also be performing with him.
