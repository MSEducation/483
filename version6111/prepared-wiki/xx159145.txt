Whitney High School is a public magnet school located in the southern Placer County city of Rocklin, California, a settlement in the northern Sacramento metropolitan area. Whitney is one of two high schools in Rocklin Unified School District; its counterpart is Rocklin High School. The school is the district's newest educational facility, having opened in 2005 to freshmen and sophomores; Whitney's first freshmen graduated at the end of the 2008–09 school year. That same school year, Whitney was recognized as a California Distinguished School.
The school educates its students using a modified block schedule program that alternates four periods every two days. Students are subject to eight different periods in total. Students at the school are also taught through a standard-based essential skills program, where students must demonstrate mastery of all skills deemed necessary in a class before credits can be earned; additionally, students must achieve a grade higher than C by the year's end, as scores lower than C equate to a "No mark", and the course must be retaken. As of the end of the 2009–10 school year, the high school fielded twenty-three clubs, including an award-winning school yearbook (known as Details), a school newspaper (known as the Roar), and a broadcast program (known as Unleashed). Whitney also ran twenty-three sports teams as of the 2008–09 school year; the football and girls' soccer teams were champions at the 2009 Sac-Joaquin Section Championships for the respective sports.

==History==

Whitney's name was a significant subject of debate, as the school's first two proposed names were associated too closely with other schools in the area.[tpl]cite news |first=Kim |last=Minugh |title=Whitney High – 3rd time a charm – Rocklin trustees drop Liberty to go with a historic name. |work=Sacramento Bee |page=N1 |date=February 20, 2005 |accessdate=July 6, 2009 |quote= |url=[/tpl] The school was initially designated Granite Ridge High School, which was deemed too similar to RUSD's Granite Oaks Middle School. It was then designated as Liberty High School, but the name was associated with the rival Lincoln High School.
