El Paso International Airport [tpl]Airport codes|ELP|KELP|ELP[/tpl] is a public airport four miles (6 km) northeast of downtown El Paso, in El Paso County, Texas, USA.

==History==

The city of El Paso built the first El Paso Municipal Airport near the east side of the Franklin Mountains in 1928.  The airport was closed by 1945 and in more recent times has been home to the Jobe Concrete Products "Planeport" cement factory.
The El Paso Municipal Airport construction was inspired by a visit from Charles Lindbergh.
What became El Paso International Airport was built as Standard Airport by Standard Airlines in 1929 for transcontinental air mail service.  Standard Airlines became a division of American Airlines in the 1930s.  In 1936, American Airlines "swapped" airports with the city of El Paso and El Paso International Airport was born.
In 1934, Varney Speed Lines (now Continental Airlines) operated at the old El Paso Municipal Airport (now closed). In 1937, the airline moved to Denver, Colorado when Robert Six took over the airline.
During World War II, the airport was a United States Army Air Forces training base.  Units which trained at El Paso Army Airfield were:
At the end of the war the airfield was deemed excess by the military and returned to the local government for civil use. The April 1952 C&GS diagram shows runways 4, 8, 12 and 17, each 7001 to 7062 ft long.
El Paso was the last stop of the first hijacking of a jetliner, a Boeing 707 owned by Continental Airlines.  Before deregulation in the USA, El Paso was a focus city for Continental but was soon demoted to a standard station in a hub-and-spoke system under Frank Lorenzo.
The passenger concourses were built in 1971 as part of an expansion that tripled the size of the airport.[tpl]cite news |title=Airport Passenger Numbers 3 Times E.P.
