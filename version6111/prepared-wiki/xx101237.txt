Farranfore ([tpl]Irish place name|An Fearann Fuar|the cold land[/tpl]) is a village in County Kerry, Ireland. It lies on the N22 road approximately midway between Tralee (17 km) and Killarney (15 km) and on the railway line connecting those two towns. 
Farranfore came into existence as a turnpike; a gate at the cross-roads in the village marked the boundary of the lands of the Earls of Kenmare.
