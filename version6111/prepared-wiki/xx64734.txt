The PEN/Faulkner Foundation is an outgrowth of William Faulkner's generosity in using his 1949 Nobel Prize winnings to create the William Faulkner Foundation; among the charitable goals of the foundation was "to establish a fund to support and encourage new fiction writers." The foundation's first award for a "notable first novel," called the William Faulkner Foundation Award, was granted to John Knowles's A Separate Peace in 1961. The foundation was dissolved after 1970.
Mary Lee Settle was one of the founders of the PEN/Faulkner award after controversy at the 1979 National Book Award, when PEN voted a boycott on the ground that they were too commercial.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/28/AR2005092802519.html?nav=rss_metro/obituaries| title=Novelist Mary Lee Settle; Founded PEN/Faulkner Award| author=Matt Schudel| work=Washington Post | date=September 29, 2005 [/tpl] It is affiliated with the writers' organization International PEN.
