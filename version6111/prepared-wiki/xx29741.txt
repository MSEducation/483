The provinces and territories of Canada combine to make up the world's second-largest country by area. Originally three provinces of British North America, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which would become Ontario and Quebec) united to form the new nation. Since then, Canada's external borders have changed several  times, and  has grown from four initial provinces to ten provinces and three territories as of 1999. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon.
The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces are jurisdictions that receive their power and authority directly from the Constitution Act, 1867 (formerly called the British North America Act, 1867), whereas territories derive their mandates and powers from the federal government. In modern Canadian constitutional theory, the provinces are considered to be co-sovereign divisions, and each province has its own "Crown" represented by the lieutenant governor, whereas the territories are not sovereign, but simply parts of the federal realm, and have a commissioner.

==Territories==

There are three territories in Canada. Unlike the provinces, the territories of Canada have no inherent jurisdiction and have only those powers delegated to them by the federal government.[tpl]cite web | url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-27/index.html | title=Northwest Territories Act | year=1985 | publisher=Department of Justice Canada | accessdate=March 25, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/Y-2.01/FullText.html | title=Yukon Act | year=2002 | publisher=Department of Justice Canada | accessdate=March 25, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url= http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/N-28.6/index.html|title=Nunavut Act |year=1993|author=Department of Justice Canada|authorlink=|accessdate=January 27, 2007[/tpl] They include all of mainland Canada north of latitude 60° north and west of Hudson Bay, as well as all islands north of the Canadian mainland (from those in James Bay to the Canadian Arctic islands). The following table lists the territories in order of precedence (each province has precedence over all the territories, regardless of the date each territory was created).
