[[Dochmiac]]

CATEGORIES: Poetic rhythm, Ancient Greek theatre

Dochmiac ([tpl]lang-grc|δοχμιακός[/tpl], from δόχμιος 'pertaining to a δοχμή or hand's-breath'Oxford English Dictionary.) is a poetic meter that is characteristically used in Greek tragedy, expressing extreme agitation or distress.  There are examples in satyric drama and Aristophanes, but these are often paratragic in tone and impassioned.  The base metrical scheme is: u — — u —, although any of the long syllables may be resolved and either of the two shorts may be replaced by a long (drag-in where the first is replaced, drag-out where the second is replaced, and double drag where both are replaced).
