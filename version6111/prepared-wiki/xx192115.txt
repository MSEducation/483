==Plot==

She’s got a killer secret! In one of the most outrageous and taboo-smashing Shaw Brothers classics, sweet young Ainu (Lily Ho, Water Margin) is abducted and sold off to the popular Four Seasons brothel run by lusty madam (Betty Pei Ti, Clans of Intrigue), who falls for her nubile charge and entrusts her with a number of martial arts secrets like “Ghost Hands,” which allows a fighter to plunge into an opponent’s chest. Soon murder erupts within the brothel, and a policeman must race against time to prevent a vicious revenge plot from reaching its blood-spattered conclusion.
