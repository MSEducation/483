==History==

The European history of Freshwater is a long and proud one, dating back to 1877. Chinese market gardeners moved into the area, after exhausting their chances on the Hodgkinson Goldfields, leased small plots from the landowners, successfully growing rice, bananas, pineapples and other tropical crops.
A rice mill was established on the Lower Freshwater Creek and was being successfully operated by local man, Joseph Kipling in 1891. Chinese farmers grew rice in the adjacent fields.[tpl]Citation | author1=Benfer, John | author2=Benfer, Val | title=A history of Freshwater | publication-date=1995 | publisher=The author | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/38696556 | accessdate=3 February 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39441830 |title=Enterprise in Cairns. |newspaper=Cairns Post (Qld. : 1884 - 1893) |location=Qld. |date=18 May 1892 |accessdate=3 February 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
