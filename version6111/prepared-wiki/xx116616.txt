Feenie's was a bistro on West Broadway in the Kitsilano neighbourhood of Vancouver, Canada. It was the casual-dining sister-restaurant to Lumière, which was located next-door. Feenie's was founded by celebrity chef Rob Feenie, the first Canadian to win on Iron Chef America. Feenie was co-owner and executive chef until 2007, when he left the restaurant after a falling out with his business partners.[tpl]cite news |title= ‘Alive for your own funeral’: Doors closing at high-end restaurants Lumiere, db Bistro Moderne |author= Mia Stainsby |publisher=Vancouver Sun |date=2011-02-28 |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Doors+closing+high+restaurants+Lumiere+Bistro+Moderne/4362503/story.html |accessdate=2011-03-01[/tpl] After entering into a partnership with chef Daniel Boulud, the majority owners renamed the restaurant "db Bistro Moderne".
