==Reception==

Writing for Allmusic, music critic Bruce Eder called the album "his most affecting folk-style record, with unexpectedly warm vocals matched to the quiet virtuosity of his playing... This album was a great showcase for Watson's voice — vaguely similar to but rougher-hewn than Burl Ives — which is often overlooked in the aura of his playing."
