Although the word jackal has often been used historically to refer to many small- to medium-sized species of the wolf genus of mammals, Canis, today it most properly[tpl]Clarify|reason= What is the definition of a proper jackal? It's not phylogenic. |date=February 2014[/tpl] and commonly refers to three species: the black-backed jackal, the side-striped jackal of sub-Saharan Africa, and the golden jackal of northern Africa and south-central Eurasia.  The black-backed and side-striped jackals are more closely related to each other than they are to the golden jackal, which is closer to wolves, dogs, and coyotes.
Jackals and coyotes (sometimes called the "American jackal"Coyote (2004) by E.M. Gese & M. Bekoff) are opportunistic omnivores, predators of small- to medium-sized animals and proficient scavengers.  Their long legs and curved canine teeth are adapted for hunting small mammals, birds, and reptiles, and their large feet and fused leg bones give them a physique well-suited for long-distance running, capable of maintaining speeds of [tpl]Convert|16|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl] for extended periods of time. Jackals are crepuscular, most active at dawn and dusk.
Their most common social unit is that of a monogamous pair which defends its territory from other pairs by vigorously chasing intruding rivals and marking landmarks around the territory with their urine and feces. The territory may be large enough to hold some young adults which stay with their parents until they establish their own territories. Jackals may occasionally assemble in small packs, for example, to scavenge a carcass, but they normally hunt either alone or in pairs.

==Etymology==

The English word "jackal" derives from Turkish çakal,Online Etymology Dictionary via Persian [tpl]Lang|fa|شغال[/tpl] [tpl]transl|fa|shaghāl[/tpl].American Heritage Dictionary - Jackal entry[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]Online Etymology Dictionary - Jackal entry

==Taxonomy and relationships==

The taxonomy of the jackals has evolved with scientific understanding about how they are related on the canid family tree.
Similarities between jackals and coyotes led Lorenz Oken, in 1816, in the third volume of his Lehrbuch der Naturgeschichte, to place these species into a new separate genus, Thos, after the classical Greek word [tpl]lang|grc|θώς[/tpl] "jackal", but his theory had little immediate impact on taxonomy at the time. Angel Cabrera in his 1932 monograph on the mammals of Morocco, questioned whether or not the presence of a cingulum on the upper molars of the jackals and its corresponding absence in the rest of Canis could justify a subdivision of the genus Canis. In practice, Cabrera chose the undivided-genus alternative and referred to the jackals as Canis instead of Thos.
Oken's Thos theory was revived in 1914 by Edmund Heller, who embraced the separate genus theory. Heller's names and the designations he gave to various jackal species and subspecies live on in current taxonomy, although the genus has been changed from Thos to Canis.Thos vs Canis
Modern research has clarified the relationships among the "jackal" species. Despite their similarities, jackals do not all stem from the same branch on the canid family tree. The side-striped jackal and black-backed jackal belong to a branch of canids that includes the dhole and African wild dog, while the golden jackal, on the other hand, belongs to a branch which includes the Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), the coyote, and Canis lupus, the grey wolf/domestic dog.[tpl]cite journal |last=Lindblad-Toh |last2=et al. |year=2005 |title=Genome sequence, comparative analysis and haplotype structure of the domestic dog |journal=Nature |volume=438 |issue=7069 |pages=803–819 |doi=10.1038/nature04338 |pmid=16341006[/tpl]
The intermediate size and shape of the Ethiopian wolf has at times led it to be regarded as a jackal, thus it has been called the "red jackal" or the "Simian jackal", but it has more often been considered and called a "wolf".

==Interbreeding with dogs==

Experiments in Germany with breeding poodles and golden jackals have produced hybrids. The results showed that, unlike wolf–dog hybrids, jackal–dog hybrids show a decrease in fertility, significant communication problems, and an increase of genetic disorders after three generations of interbreeding, much like coydogs.[tpl]cite book |first=Dorit |last=Feddersen-Petersen |title=Hundepsychologie |edition=4th |year=2004 |publisher=Franck-Kosmos-Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=3-440-09780-3 [/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl]
In Russia, golden jackals are one of the founder breeds of the Sulimov dog, a  working dog owned exclusively by Aeroflot and used for bomb detection in airport security.
