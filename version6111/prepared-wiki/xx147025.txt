"Leavin' On Your Mind" is a famous Country/Pop song written by Wayne Walker and Webb Pierce was popularized by Patsy Cline in 1963.
In 1963, Patsy Cline was at the height of her career. In the meantime, she was looking for her next single to release for the upcoming year. Wayne Walker and Webb Pierce wrote the song for her called "Leavin' On Your Mind". Cline released the song in January 1963 and it became a top ten Country hit for Cline. Unlike her earlier hits "Crazy" and "I Fall to Pieces", "Leavin' On Your Mind" was an unfortunate failure on the pop chart, where it stalled at #83. However, the song today remains a classic in Country music. Initially, Cline was going to release the single on her next upcoming, fourth album called Faded Love, along with two other singles that year.
However, the album was never released due to the tragic event that ended her life, which was a plane crash that March. The album was to be released at the end of March. Instead, the album was released on a double compilation album called The Patsy Cline Story. This album featured all of Cline's big hits, starting for her first in 1957 to 1963. The album was a huge hit and is still being sold today.

==Chart performance==

If You've Got Leavin' On Your Mind written by Wayne Walker and Webb Pierce was first recorded by Joyce Smith in September 1961 and was released in March 1962. She had just signed with Decca Records. 
Joyce found herself in Nashville's famed Columbia Studios working with the Legendary Owen Bradley, The Jordanaires, and session players the likes of Pete Drake, Buddy Harmon, Harold Bradley, Billy Grammer and Bobby Moore. The week she recorded Leavin' On Your Mind in Nashville at the old Columbia Studios, Patsy Cline came into Owen Bradley's office and he played Joyce's record for her, she immediately loved the tune and wanted to record it but Owen said no, we'll wait and see what this Canadian girl does with it.
Joyce Smith was one of only a handful to have her early records sell in excess of 100,000 copies in the U.S. which Decca said was a major hit for a first record. Joyce recorded several singles for Decca in the 60's. Her many years of superb performances at rodeos, on TV, and live concerts around the world, and her many industry awards and accolades truly set her apart as a Country Music Legend and a first class lady.
Joyce was inducted into the National Taditional Country Music Hall of Fame in the U.S in 2007 and in 2010 was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame. Joyce makes her home in Edmonton, Alberta Canada and still performs regularly with the Canadian Country Music Legends Show.
