==Health==

On March 22, 2005, López held a press conference in San Juan announcing she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Her then-boyfriend, Luis Fonsi, announced at the same press conference that he was cancelling his 2005 international tour to be by her side. She was expected to recover, as her cancer was caught at "stage 1," which is a very early stage, and it had not spread to other areas of her body.
She underwent cancer surgery.  In 2006, it was reported that she is in remission. Since being diagnosed, she has campaigned for breast cancer awareness.http://thehotspotorlando.com/2012/09/11/yoplait-kicks-off-its-fifth-annual-hispanic-lids-for-life-tour-with-actress-and-breast-cancer-survivor-adamari-lopez/
