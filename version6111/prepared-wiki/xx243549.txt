Left Bank (May 9, 1997 - October 7, 2002) was an American Champion Thoroughbred racehorse.

==Background==

Out of the mare, Marshesseaux, he was sired by Jerome Handicap winner, French Deputy, a son of Deputy Minister who was the 1981 Canadian Horse of the Year and two-time Leading sire in North America.
English horseman Michael Tabor purchased Left Bank as a two-year-old for $600,000 at a February 1999 Fasig-Tipton sale at Calder Race Course. Tabor turned him over to trainer Todd Pletcher to race in the United States. However, the colt suffered from colic that necessitated surgery which resulted in the removal of twelve feet of small intestine.

==Racing career==

===2000: Three-year-old season===

Recovered, Left Bank was able to race the following year notably winning the 2000 Discovery Handicap at New York's Aqueduct Racetrack.

===2001: Four-year-old season===

At age four in 2001, Left Bank got off to a slow start but in the fall won two Grade 1 races. He first beat the betting favorite Squirtle Squirt to capture the September 22  Vosburgh Stakes at Belmont Park, clocking the second-fastest time in the race's 62 year history. Then, on November 24 at Aqueduct Racetrack, Left Bank won the Cigar Mile Handicap by defeating top-rated challengers, Graeme Hall and Red Bullet. http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/25/sports/horse-racing-a-big-farewell-afternoon-for-velazquez-and-pletcher.html

After his win in the Whitney, Left Bank was being prepared to run in the Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park but suffered another attack of colic. On August 10, 2002 the horse was rushed to the equine hospital at Tufts University near Boston, Massachusetts where he underwent emergency surgery. Following his surgery, Left Bank was sent to recover at Ashford Stud in Versailles, Kentucky but had to undergo further operations from which he was unable to recover and died on October 7, 2002.

==Assessment==

Left Bank posthumously earned the Eclipse Award when he was voted the 2002 American Champion Older Male Horse. It marked the first Eclipse Award for trainer, Todd Pletcher. http://horseracing.about.com/library/weekly/aa012703a.htm
