==Biography==

Neumann was Jewish,http://books.google.com/books?id=tGcPDXOjxMoC&pg=PA237&dq=%22Jews+and+the+Olympic+Games%22+neumann&hl=en&ei=TBmfTo_NCOTd0QGh1JGnCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false and born in Vienna.  He competed in the 500 and 1,200 metres freestyle events.  He won the 500 with a time of 8:12.6, benefitting from the withdrawal of Alfréd Hajós from the event.  Hajós had just won the 100 metres, and skipped the 500 in order to prepare for the 1,200.  Neumann had no opportunity to rest between the 500 and the 1,200.  As a result, he was unable to finish the longer race.
In 1897, he set world records at 2, 3, 4, and 5 miles.http://books.google.com/books?id=tGcPDXOjxMoC&pg=PA237&dq=%22Jews+and+the+Olympic+Games%22+neumann&hl=en&ei=TBmfTo_NCOTd0QGh1JGnCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false
He immigrated to the U.S. after the 1896 Olympic Games.  There, he became a physician, and earned a Ph.D. in philosophy.http://books.google.com/books?id=tGcPDXOjxMoC&pg=PA237&dq=%22Jews+and+the+Olympic+Games%22+neumann&hl=en&ei=TBmfTo_NCOTd0QGh1JGnCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false
