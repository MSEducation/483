[[Master of the Gerona Martyrology]]

CATEGORIES: Czech painters, Manuscript illuminators, Anonymous artists, 14th-century painters

The Master of the Gerona Martyrology was a Bohemian painter active at the end of the fourteenth century.  His output is fairly poorly known; some historians have conflated him with either the Master of Ambrass or the Master of the Rajhrad Altarpiece.  This view is not universally accepted, and a number of museums have work believed to be by members of his studio, including pieces of illuminated manuscripts.
