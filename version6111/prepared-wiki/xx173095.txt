==Features==

There is a village hall in Chapel Lawn for the local rural community, called the Redlake Valley Village Hall. It was built in 1952.Redlake Valley Village Hall
Many public footpaths cross the Redlake Valley enabling walkers to see the features above and an information board at the Village Hall car park, next to the church, displays a map together with local information. Walkers are free to leave their cars at this car park whilst enjoying the local sights. Numerous sheep and cattle graze on the higher fields and walkers are asked to obey the countryside code, closing gates after themselves and keeping dogs under control. A local conservation spot, Hodre Pond, lies along the road to Obley, some 1.5Â km from the village centre and dates back some 400 years. The pond boasts many aquatic species of flora and fauna well worthy of viewing.

==Church==

St Mary's Church in the centre of Chapel Lawn was designed by Edward Haycock Snr in the lancet style and erected in 1844. It was planned to provide 232 sittings, of which 162 were declared free and unappropriated forever. Originally a Chapel of Ease of Clun parish, without an adjoining vicarage and resident priest, it was built to save parishioners the long walk to Clun. Built of stone in the style of the period, it displays the typical plain lancets, flat buttresses, and western bell gable with a wide queen post roof. The polygonal apse, which forms the chancel, is unusual. The churchyard contains one war grave of a soldier of the Royal Horse Artillery of World War I.http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/393495/BEDWELL,%20ERNEST%20JOHN CWGC Casualty Record.
The church became a parish church in its own right in 1991, part of the benefice of Bucknell and morning services are held on the first and third Sunday of each month.
