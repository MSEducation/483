The Photographer's Wife is a 3 track EP by Swedish singer-songwriter Stina Nordenstam collaborating with American drummer & composer Anton Fier and several other musicians. 
It was released in 1996 as a CD and 10" vinyl single. Both formats featured the same three tracks. All tracks are credited as being remixes. The original versions have not been commercially released.

==Track listing==

All songs written by Stina Nordenstam and Anton Fier.
Track 1 remixed by Microman. 

Tracks 2 and 3 remixed by Descendence.

=="Music From The Original Soundtrack"?==

The E.P. is packaged as "Music From The Original Soundtrack" but the film which inspired its content does not appear to have ever been released. There is an entry for a 1991 Canadian short film called The Photographer's Wife at the imdb but this would seem to be coincidental.
