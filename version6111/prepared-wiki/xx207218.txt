Fujairah power and desalination plant is a hybrid plant at Qidfa', Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates.  It is located next to the Qidfa Power Station [tpl]convert|5|km|mi[/tpl] south of Khor Fakkan and [tpl]convert|20|km|mi[/tpl] north of the city of Fujairah.  When constructed, the Fujairah plant was the first hybrid plant in the Middle East, and the largest desalination hybrid plant in the world.

==History==

A construction contract was awarded to Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction Company in June 2001 and the contract was signed in June 2002. In August 2001, a contract for the transmission systems was awarded to a joint venture of Al Jaber Energy Services and Technip. The first few liters of potable water were produced in April 2004. Total construction costs of the project were US$1.2 billion

==Technical description==

The Fujairah plant has an installed power capacity of 760 MW and it produces [tpl]convert|455000|m3/d|sp=us[/tpl] of water. It is a natural gas-fired plant supplied from  the Dolphin Gas Project through the Al Ain-Fujairah pipeline. Its annual consumption is [tpl]convert|1.4|e9m3|abbr=off[/tpl] of natural gas.   Its power generating side consists of four gas turbines, two heat recovery steam generators and two steam turbines in a combined cycle configuration. 120 MW of capacity is used for the water desalination process and 36 MW accounted for the transmission lost, leaving 500 MW of capacity for supplies to the grid through a [tpl]convert|68|km|mi[/tpl] long double circuit 400 kV transmission line.
For the water desalination, the Fujairah plant uses a combination of two different desalination technologies. [tpl]convert|284000|m3/d|sp=us[/tpl] of water is produced using multi-stage flash distillation (MSF) technology and [tpl]convert|171000|m3/d|sp=us[/tpl] of water is produced using reverse osmosis technology (RO). The water production system consists of five MSF units producing [tpl]convert|57000|m3/d|sp=us[/tpl] of water each and one RO unit. Potable water is stored in five tanks, [tpl]convert|91000|m3|cuft|sp=us[/tpl] each. The water output is pumped to Sweihan through a [tpl]convert|179|km|mi[/tpl] dual pipeline with an [tpl]convert|18|km|mi[/tpl] spur to Al Dhaid in Sharjah.

==Operating company==

The plant was originally owned by the Union Water and Electricity Company (UWEC), established in June 2001 as a government owned company through the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority (ADWEA). The plant was operated and maintained by Sogex Oman under agreement with UWEC.  In 2006, 40% stake in UWEC was sold to Singapore-based Sembcorp Utilities and SembCorp took over the plant's operating activities.  After privatization the company was renamed Emirates SembCorp Water and Power Company.

==Future expansion==

According to the privatization agreement, the power capacity of the Fujairah plant would be expanded by 225 MW and water production would be expanded by [tpl]convert|136500|m3|cuft|sp=us[/tpl] of water per day.
