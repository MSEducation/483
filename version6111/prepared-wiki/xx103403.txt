The Calico M960 is a 9x19mm (Luger/Parabellum) caliber semi-automatic carbine (fully automatic versions are available only to authorized law enforcement and military), manufactured by Calico Light Weapons Systems. Its unique features include its high-capacity, cylindrical, helical-feed magazine and retractable stock. This method allows magazine capacities of 50 and 100 rounds in a relatively small space, making it ideal for law enforcement and special operations units. One of the most interesting aspects of the carbine is that the rear sight is mounted as part of the plastic magazine shell.
