Though sometimes referred to simply as megestrol, it is important to clarify that megestrol acetate is not the same as megestrol, which is a closely related but different compound.[tpl]cite book | title = Index Nominum 2000: International Drug Directory | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=5GpcTQD_L2oC&pg=PA641 | accessdate = 28 May 2012 | year = 2000 | publisher = Taylor & Francis US | isbn = 978-3-88763-075-1 | page = 641[/tpl]

==Uses==

Megestrol acetate is used mainly as an appetite stimulant in a variety of conditions and as an antineoplastic agent in the treatment of breast, endometrial, and prostate cancers.[tpl]cite book | author = Kenneth L. Becker | title = Principles and Practice of Endocrinology and Metabolism | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=FVfzRvaucq8C&pg=PA1195 | accessdate = 27 May 2012 | date = 24 April 2001 | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | isbn = 978-0-7817-1750-2 | page = 1195[/tpl] When given in relatively high doses, it can substantially increase appetite in most individuals, even those with advanced cancer, and is often used to boost appetite and induce weight gain in patients with cancer or HIV/AIDS-associated cachexia. It is also used as a contraceptive in combination with an estrogen at relatively low doses.
In addition to its use in humans, megestrol acetate has been used extensively in veterinary medicine in the treatment of medical conditions in cats and dogs.

==Dosage==

Megestrol acetate is available as 5 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg tablets and in oral suspensions of 125 mg/ml and 40 mg/ml. It is used at a dose of 5 mg in combination with an estrogen for contraception. Appetite stimulation is achieved with doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg a day.  Doses used to treat cancer usually range from 40 mg to 320 mg.

==Pharmacology==

Megestrol acetate acts predominantly as a potent agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR) to exert its effects.[tpl]cite journal | author = Teulings FA, van Gilse HA, Henkelman MS, Portengen H, Alexieva-Figusch J | title = Estrogen, androgen, glucocorticoid, and progesterone receptors in progestin-induced regression of human breast cancer | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 40 | issue = 7 | pages = 2557–61 |date=July 1980 | pmid = 6248208 | doi = | url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6248208[/tpl]
Megestrol acetate has powerful antiandrogenic and antiestrogenic effects in humans at sufficient doses, capable of decreasing circulating androgen and estrogen concentrations to castrate levels in both sexes and significantly lowering the expression of the androgen receptor (AR) and the estrogen receptor (ER) in the body;[tpl]cite journal | author = Geller J, Albert J, Yen SS, Geller S, Loza D | title = Medical castration of males with megestrol acetate and small doses of diethylstilbestrol | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 576–80 |date=March 1981 | pmid = 6161942 | doi = | url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6161942[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Venner PM | title = Therapeutic options in treatment of advanced carcinoma of the prostate | journal = Seminars in Oncology | volume = 17 | issue = 6 Suppl 9 | pages = 73–7 |date=December 1990 | pmid = 2259929 | doi = | url = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Lundgren S, Lønning PE, Utaaker E, Aakvaag A, Kvinnsland S | title = Influence of progestins on serum hormone levels in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer--I.

These actions are likely the result of a strong activation of the PR, which suppresses the secretion of the gonadotropins—peptide hormones responsible for signaling the body to produce not only progesterone but also the androgens and the estrogens—from the pituitary gland as a form of negative feedback inhibition, and hence downregulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, resulting in decreased levels of the sex hormones and their associated enzymes, carriers (e.g., sex hormone-binding globulin), and receptors.[tpl]cite journal | author = Alexieva-Figusch J, Blankenstein MA, de Jong FH, Lamberts SW | title = Endocrine effects of the combination of megestrol acetate and tamoxifen in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer | journal = European Journal of Cancer & Clinical Oncology | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 135–40 |date=September 1984 | pmid = 6434315 | doi = | url = [/tpl] It is the antiandrogenic and antiestrogenic effects of megestrol acetate mediated by suppression of the HPG axis that are believed to be largely responsible for its beneficial effects against androgen and estrogen-sensitive cancers, respectively.[tpl]cite journal | author = Schacter L, Rozencweig M, Canetta R, Kelley S, Nicaise C, Smaldone L | title = Megestrol acetate: clinical experience | journal = Cancer Treatment Reviews | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–63 |date=March 1989 | pmid = 2471590 | doi = | url = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Sedlacek SM | title = An overview of megestrol acetate for the treatment of advanced breast cancer | journal = Seminars in Oncology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 Suppl 1 | pages = 3–13 |date=April 1988 | pmid = 3285483 | doi = | url = [/tpl]
Megestrol acetate is a high-affinity, weak partial agonist/antagonist of the AR,[tpl]cite journal | author = Eil C, Edelson SK | title = The use of human skin fibroblasts to obtain potency estimates of drug binding to androgen receptors | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–5 |date=July 1984 | pmid = 6725525 | doi = | url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6725525[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Luthy IA, Begin DJ, Labrie F | title = Androgenic activity of synthetic progestins and spironolactone in androgen-sensitive mouse mammary carcinoma (Shionogi) cells in culture | journal = Journal of Steroid Biochemistry | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 845–52 |date=November 1988 | pmid = 2462135 | doi = | url = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Poyet P, Labrie F | title = Comparison of the antiandrogenic/androgenic activities of flutamide, cyproterone acetate and megestrol acetate | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 283–8 |date=October 1985 | pmid = 3930312 | doi = | url = [/tpl] where it binds with very similar but slightly less affinity relative to the PR (about 75% of the affinity according to one assay). However, at clinical doses in humans, it appears to behave, for all intents and purposes, purely as an antiandrogen. No androgenic side effects have been observed with the use of megestrol acetate in patients of either sex at doses up to as high as 1,600 mg per day (which is the highest that has been used).[tpl]cite journal | author = Farrar DJ | title = Megestrol acetate: promises and pitfalls | journal = AIDS Patient Care and STDs | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 149–52 |date=March 1999 | pmid = 10375262 | doi = | url = [/tpl] Furthermore, it produces detectable androgenic effects in animals only at a dose that is the equivalent of approximately 200 times that typically used for the treatment of prostate cancer in men.[tpl]cite journal | author = Tisell LE, Salander H | title = Androgenic properties and adrenal depressant activity of megestrol acetate observed in castrated male rats | journal = Acta Endocrinologica | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 316–24 |date=February 1975 | pmid = 1172901 | doi = | url = [/tpl]
Unlike the case of the AR, megestrol acetate has no significant affinity for the ER. As such, it does not possess the capacity to directly activate the ER. Furthermore, unlike conventional antiandrogens like cyproterone and flutamide, there is relatively little risk of indirectly-mediated estrogenic side effects (e.g., gynecomastia) with megestrol acetate.[tpl]cite book | author = Kenneth A. Foon | title = Biological and Hormonal Therapies of Cancer | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=8KnTy0eCQ9AC&pg=PA73 | accessdate = 2 June 2012 | year = 1998 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-0-7923-9997-1 | page = 73[/tpl] This is because conventional antiandrogens only suppress androgen activity (which, because androgen and estrogen activities are typically inversely proportional, results in heightened estrogen levels), whereas megestrol acetate suppresses both androgen and estrogen levels at the same time.
Megestrol acetate is an agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor, with similar but less affinity in comparison to the PR and the AR (about 37% and 50% of the affinity, respectively, according to one assay). One study found that, in the dose range tested, it possesses about 50% of the eosinopenic and hyperglycemic activity (markers of glucocorticoid activity) of an equal amount of medroxyprogesterone acetate, and about 25% that of cortisol.[tpl]cite journal | author = Briggs MH, Briggs M | title = Glucocorticoid properties of progestogens | journal = Steroids | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 555–9 |date=October 1973 | pmid = 4747450 | doi = | url = [/tpl] Accordingly, manifestations of its glucocorticoid properties, including symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, steroid diabetes, and adrenal insufficiency, have been reported with the use of megestrol acetate in the medical literature, albeit sporadically.[tpl]cite journal | author = Mann M, Koller E, Murgo A, Malozowski S, Bacsanyi J, Leinung M | title = Glucocorticoidlike activity of megestrol.

Megestrol acetate is frequently used as an appetite stimulant. The direct mechanism of appetite enhancement is unclear, but it is known that megestrol acetate induces a variety of downstream changes to cause the effect, including stimulation of the release of neuropeptide Y in the hypothalamus, modulation of calcium channels in the ventromedial hypothalamus, and inhibition of the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, all of which have been implicated in facilitation of appetite.[tpl]cite book | author1 = Ann M.

==Side effects==

The most common side effect of megestrol acetate is weight gain. Other side effects may include nausea, vomiting, impotence, edema, breakthrough bleeding, and shortness of breath. Rare and more severe side effects may include thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism. It may also cause glucocorticoid-related adverse effects such as adrenal insufficiency in some individuals and/or cases (especially if the medication is suddenly discontinued following prolonged use).[tpl]cite journal | author = Chidakel AR, Zweig SB, Schlosser JR, Homel P, Schappert JW, Fleckman AM | title = High prevalence of adrenal suppression during acute illness in hospitalized patients receiving megestrol acetate | journal = Journal of Endocrinological Investigation | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 136–40 |date=February 2006 | pmid = 16610239 | doi = | url = http://www.jendocrinolinvest.it/jei/en/abstract.cfm?articolo_id=1175[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Bulchandani D, Nachnani J, Amin A, May J | title = Megestrol acetate-associated adrenal insufficiency | journal = The American Journal of Geriatric Pharmacotherapy | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 167–72 |date=August 2008 | pmid = 18775392 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2008.08.004 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1543-5946(08)00043-3[/tpl]
