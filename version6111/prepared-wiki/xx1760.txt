[[Candidiasis]]

CATEGORIES: Mycosis-related cutaneous conditions, Fungal diseases

Candidiasis or thrush is a fungal infection (mycosis) of any species from the genus Candida (one genus of yeasts). Candida albicans is the most common agent of Candidiasis in humans.[tpl]cite book | author = Walsh TJ, Dixon DM | chapter=Deep Mycoses |title=Baron's Medical Microbiology |editor=Baron S et al. eds.| edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 |isbn=0-9631172-1-1 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.4006 [/tpl][tpl]MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|001511|Vaginal yeast infection[/tpl] Also commonly referred to as a yeast infection, candidiasis is also technically known as candidosis, moniliasis, and oidiomycosis.[tpl]cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier|pages=308–311|year=2006 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0[/tpl]
Candidiasis encompasses infections that range from superficial, such as oral thrush and vaginitis, to systemic and potentially life-threatening diseases. Candida infections of the latter category are also referred to as candidemia or invasive candidiasis, and are usually confined to severely immunocompromised persons, such as cancer, transplant, and AIDS patients, as well as nontrauma emergency surgery patients.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kourkoumpetis T, Manolakaki D, Velmahos G, et al. |title=Candida infection and colonization among non-trauma emergency surgery patients |journal=Virulence |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=359–66 |year=2010 |pmid=21178471 |doi=10.4161/viru.1.5.12795 |url=http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/viru/abstract.php?id=12795[/tpl]
Superficial infections of skin and mucosal membranes by Candida causing local inflammation and discomfort are common in many human populations.[tpl]cite journal|author=Fidel PL|year= 2002|title=Immunity to Candida|journal=Oral Dis. |volume=8 |pages=69–75 |pmid=12164664 |doi=10.1034/j.1601-0825.2002.00015.x[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Pappas PG |title=Invasive candidiasis |journal=Infect.

==Classification==

Candidiasis may be divided into the following types:
Antibiotic candidiasis  (iatrogenic candidiasis)

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms of candidiasis vary depending on the area affected. Most candidial infections result in minimal complications such as redness, itching and discomfort, though complications may be severe or even fatal if left untreated in certain populations. In immunocompetent persons, candidiasis is usually a very localized infection of the skin or mucosal membranes, including  the oral cavity (thrush), the pharynx or esophagus, the gastrointestinal tract,  the urinary bladder, the fingernails or toenails (onychomycosis), and the genitalia (vagina, penis).
Candidiasis is a very common cause of vaginal irritation, or vaginitis, and can also occur on the male genitals. In immunocompromised patients, Candida infections can affect the esophagus with the potential of becoming systemic, causing a much more serious condition, a fungemia called candidemia.
Thrush is commonly seen in infants. It is not considered abnormal in infants unless it lasts longer than a few weeks.[tpl]cite web|title = Thrush| url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001650/ |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-04-08[/tpl]
Infection of the vagina or vulva may cause severe itching, burning, soreness, irritation, and a whitish or whitish-gray cottage cheese-like discharge, often with a curd-like appearance. These symptoms are also present in the more common bacterial vaginosis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://women.webmd.com/features/is-it-yeast-infection |author=Terri Warren, RN |title=Is It a Yeast Infection? |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-02-23[/tpl] In a 2002 study published in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, only 33% of women who were self-treating for a yeast infection actually had a such an infection, while most had either bacterial vaginosis or a mixed-type infection.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0029-7844(01)01759-8 |author=Ferris DG; Nyirjesy P; Sobel JD; Soper D; Pavletic A; Litaker MS |date=March 2002 |title=Over-the-counter antifungal drug misuse associated with patient-diagnosed vulvovaginal candidiasis |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=419–425 |pmid=11864668 [/tpl] Symptoms of infection of the male genitalia (balanitis thrush) include red skin around the head of the penis, swelling, irritation, itchiness and soreness of the head of the penis, thick, lumpy discharge under the foreskin, unpleasant odour, difficulty retracting the foreskin (phimosis), and pain when passing urine
or during sex.NHS: Symptoms of thrush in men (balanitis thrush)
Perianal candidiasis can cause pruritis ani. The lesion can be erythematous, papular or ulcerative in appearance, and it is not considered to be a sexually transmissible disease.[tpl]cite book|editors=Bruce G.

Esophageal candidiasis can cause dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), or less commonly odynophagia (painful swallowing).

==Causes==

Candida yeasts are generally present in healthy humans, particularly on the skin, but their growth is normally limited by the human immune system, by competition of other microorganisms, such as bacteria occupying the same locations in the human body,[tpl]cite book |author=Mulley, A. G.; Goroll, A. H.|title=Primary Care Medicine: office evaluation and management of the adult patient |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health |location=Philadelphia |year=2006 |pages=802–3 |isbn=0-7817-7456-X |url=http://books.google.com/?id=aWQhTbwoM9EC&pg=RA1-PA802&lpg=RA1-PA802 |accessdate=2008-11-23[/tpl] and in the case of skin, by the relative dryness of the skin, as Candida requires moisture for growth.[tpl]cite book|last=Goehring|first=Richard V.|title=Mims' medical microbiology.|year=2008|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0-323-04475-2|page=656|edition=4th ed.[/tpl]
C. albicans was isolated from the vaginas of 19% of apparently healthy women, i.e., those who experienced few or no symptoms of infection.  External use of detergents or douches or internal  disturbances (hormonal or physiological) can perturb the normal vaginal flora, consisting of lactic acid bacteria, such as lactobacilli, and result in an overgrowth of Candida cells, causing symptoms of infection, such as local inflammation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mårdh P A, Novikova N, Stukalova E |title=Colonisation of extragenital sites by Candida in women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidosis |journal=BJOG |volume=110 |issue=10 |pages=934–7 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14550364 |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1470-0328&date=2003&volume=110&issue=10&spage=934 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2003.01445.x[/tpl] Pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptives have been reported as risk factors.[tpl]cite journal |author=Schiefer HG |title=Mycoses of the urogenital tract |journal=Mycoses |volume=40 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=33–6 |year=1997 |pmid=9476502 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0507.1997.tb00561.x [/tpl] Diabetes mellitus and the use of antibacterial antibiotics are also linked to an increased incidence of yeast infections. Diets high in simple carbohydrates have been found to affect rates of oral candidiases,[tpl]cite journal|last=Akpan|first=A|coauthors=Morgan, R|title=Oral candidiasis|journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal|date=August 2002|volume=78|issue=922|pages=455–9|pmid=12185216|doi=10.1136/pmj.78.922.455|pmc=1742467[/tpl] and hormone replacement therapy and infertility treatments may also be predisposing factors.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nwokolo N C, Boag F C |title=Chronic vaginal candidiasis.

of time is also believed to be a risk factor.
A weakened or undeveloped immune system or metabolic illnesses such as diabetes are significant predisposing factors of candidiasis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Odds FC |title=Candida infections: an overview |journal=Crit. Rev. Microbiol. |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |year=1987 |pmid=3319417 |doi=10.3109/10408418709104444[/tpl] Diseases or conditions linked to candidiasis include HIV/AIDS, mononucleosis, cancer treatments, steroids, stress, and nutrient deficiency. Almost 15% of people with weakened immune systems develop a systemic illness caused by Candida species.[tpl]cite journal |author=Choo Z.W., Chakravarthi S., Wong S.F., Nagaraja H.S., Thanikachalam P.M., Mak J.W., Radhakrishnan A., Tay A. |title=A comparative histopathological study of systemic candidiasis in association with experimentally induced breast cancer |journal=Oncology Letters |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=215–222 |year=2010 |doi=10.3892/ol_00000039 |url=http://www.spandidos-publications.com/ol/1/1/215 |issn=1792-1082 |pmid=22966285 |pmc=3436220[/tpl] In extreme cases, these superficial infections of the skin or mucous membranes may enter into the bloodstream and cause systemic Candida infections.
In penile candidiasis, the causes include sexual intercourse with an infected individual, low immunity, antibiotics, and diabetes. Male genital yeast infections are less common, and incidences of infection are only a fraction of those in women; however, yeast infection on the penis from direct contact via sexual intercourse with an infected partner is not uncommon.[tpl]cite journal |author=David LM, Walzman M, Rajamanoharan S |title=Genital colonisation and infection with candida in heterosexual and homosexual males |journal=Genitourin Med |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=394–6 |date=October 1997 |pmid=9534752 |pmc=1195901 |doi=10.1136/sti.73.5.394[/tpl]
Candida species are frequently part of the human body's normal oral and intestinal flora. Treatment with antibiotics can lead to eliminating the yeast's natural competitors for resources, and increase the severity of the condition.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Bassetti|first1=M|last2=Mikulska|first2=M|last3=Viscoli|first3=C |title=Bench-to-bedside review: therapeutic management of invasive candidiasis in the intensive care unit.|journal=Critical Care |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=244 |date=December 2010 |pmid=21144007 |doi=10.1186/cc9239[/tpl] In the Western Hemisphere, about 75% of females are affected at some time in their lives.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis of a yeast infection is done either via microscopic examination or culturing.
For identification by light microscopy, a scraping or swab of the affected area is placed on a microscope slide. A single drop of 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution is then added to the specimen. The KOH dissolves the skin cells, but leaves the Candida cells intact, permitting visualization of pseudohyphae and budding yeast cells typical of many Candida species.
For the culturing method, a sterile swab is rubbed on the infected skin surface. The swab is then streaked on a culture medium. The culture is incubated at 37 °C for several days, to allow development of yeast or bacterial colonies. The characteristics (such as morphology and colour) of the colonies may allow initial diagnosis of the organism causing disease symptoms.[tpl]cite journal |author=Srikumar Chakravarthi, Nagaraja HS |title=A comprehensive review of the occurrence and management of systemic candidiasis as an opportunistic infection |journal=Microbiology Journal |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=1–5 |year=2010 |url=http://scialert.net/abstract/?doi=mj.2011.1.7|issn=2153-0696[/tpl]

==Treatment==

Candidiasis is commonly treated with antimycotics; these antifungal drugs include topical clotrimazole, topical nystatin, fluconazole, and topical ketoconazole.

===Localized infection===

A one-time dose of fluconazole is 90% effective in treating a vaginal yeast infection.[tpl]cite journal |author=Moosa MY, Sobel JD, Elhalis H, Du W, Akins RA |title=Fungicidal Activity of Fluconazole against Candida albicans in a Synthetic Vagina-Simulative Medium |journal=Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=161–7 |year=2004 |pmid=14693534 |doi=10.1128/AAC.48.1.161-167.2004 |pmc=310176[/tpl] Local treatment may include vaginal suppositories or medicated douches. Other types of yeast infections require different dosing. Gentian violet can be used for thrush in breastfeeding babies, but when used in large quantities, it can cause mouth and throat ulcerations, and has been linked to mouth cancer in humans and to cancer in the digestive tract of other animals.[tpl]cite journal |author=Craigmill A|title=Gentian Violet Policy Withdrawn |journal=Cooperative Extension University of California -- Environmental Toxicology Newsletter |volume=11 |issue=5 |date=December 1991 |url=http://extoxnet.orst.edu/newsletters/n115_91.htm[/tpl] C. albicans can develop resistance to fluconazole, this being more of an issue in those with HIV/AIDS who are often treated with multiple courses of fluconazole for recurrent oral infections.[tpl]cite journal|last=Morschhäuser|first=J|title=The genetic basis of fluconazole resistance development in Candida albicans.|journal=Biochimica et biophysica acta|date=Jul 18, 2002|volume=1587|issue=2-3|pages=240–8|pmid=12084466|doi=10.1016/s0925-4439(02)00087-x[/tpl]
For vaginal yeast infection in pregnancy, topical imidazole or triazole antifungal is considered the therapy of choice owing to available safety data. Systemic absorption of these topical formulations is minimal, posing little risk of transplacental transfer. In vaginal yeast infection in pregnancy, treatment with topical azole antifungals is recommended for 7 days instead of a shorter duration.[tpl]cite journal|last=Soong|first=D|coauthors=Einarson, A|title=Vaginal yeast infections during pregnancy.|journal=Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien|date=Mar 2009|volume=55|issue=3|pages=255–6|pmid=19282531[/tpl]

===Blood infection===

In candidial infections of the blood intravenous fluconazole or an echinocandin such as caspofungin may be used.[tpl]cite journal|last=Pappas|first=PG|coauthors=Kauffman, CA; Andes, D; Benjamin DK, Jr; Calandra, TF; Edwards JE, Jr; Filler, SG; Fisher, JF; Kullberg, BJ; Ostrosky-Zeichner, L; Reboli, AC; Rex, JH; Walsh, TJ; Sobel, JD; Infectious Diseases Society of, America|title=Clinical practice guidelines for the management of candidiasis: 2009 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.|journal=Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America|date=Mar 1, 2009|volume=48|issue=5|pages=503–35|pmid=19191635[/tpl] Amphotericin B is another option.

==Prognosis==

Among individuals being treated in intensive care units, there is a mortality rate of about 30-50% when systemic candidiasis develops.[tpl]cite journal|last=Williams|first=D|coauthors=Lewis, M|title=Pathogenesis and treatment of oral candidosis.|journal=Journal of oral microbiology|date=Jan 28, 2011|volume=3|pmid=21547018|pmc=3087208[/tpl]

==History==

Descriptions of what sounds like oral thrush go back to the time of Hippocrates circa 460 - 370 BC.[tpl]cite book|last=Dolin|first=by Gerald L. Mandell, John E. Bennett, Raphael|title=Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's principles and practice of infectious diseases|year=2010|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0-443-06839-3|pages=Chapter 250|edition=7th[/tpl]
Vulvovaginal candidiasis was first described in 1849 by Wilkinson. In 1875 Haussmann demonstrated that the causative organism in both vulvovaginal candidiasis and oral candidiasis was the same.
The incidence of candidiasis increased following World War II, with the advent of antibiotics, and then decreased again with the development of nystatin, introduced by Elizabeth Hazen and Rachel Brown.[tpl]cite journal|last=Obladen|first=M|title=Thrush - nightmare of the foundling hospitals.|journal=Neonatology|year=2012|volume=101|issue=3|pages=159–65|pmid=22024688|doi=10.1159/000329879[/tpl]
The colloquial term "thrush" refers to the resemblance of the white flecks present in some forms of candidiasis (e.g. pseudomembranous candidiasis), with the breast of the bird of the same name.[tpl]cite web|last=Scully|first=Crispian|title=Mucosal Candidiasis (Medscape)|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1075227-overview|publisher=WebMD LLC|accessdate=8 September 2013[/tpl] The term candidosis is largely used in British English, and candidiasis in American English.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lynch|first=DP|title=Oral candidiasis. History, classification, and clinical presentation.|journal=Oral surgery, oral medicine, and oral pathology|date=August 1994|volume=78|issue=2|pages=189–93|pmid=7936588|doi=10.1016/0030-4220(94)90146-5[/tpl] Candida is also pronounced differently, in American English, the stress is on the "i", whereas in British English there is no stress on the "i".
The genus Candida and species C. albicans were described by botanist Christine Marie Berkhout in her doctoral thesis at the University of Utrecht in 1923. Over the years, the classification of the genera and species has evolved. Obsolete names for this genus include Mycotorula and Torulopsis. The species has also been known in the past as Monilia albicans and Oidium albicans. The current classification is nomen conservandum, which means the name is authorized for use by the International Botanical Congress (IBC).[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.bgbm.org/iapt/nomenclature/code/SaintLouis/0000St.Luistitle.htm |title=International Code of Botanical Nomenclature |year=2000 |isbn=3-904144-22-7 |location =Königstein | accessdate=2008-11-23[/tpl]
The genus Candida includes about 150 different species; however, only a few are known to cause human infections. C. albicans is the most significant pathogenic species. Other species pathogenic in humans include C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. dubliniensis, and C. lusitaniae.
The name Candida was proposed by Berkhout. It is from the Latin word toga candida, referring to the white toga (robe) that was worn by candidates for the Senate of the ancient Roman republic. Albicans also comes from Latin, albicare meaning "to whiten." These names refer to the generally white appearance of Candida species when cultured.

==Alternative medicine==

Some practitioners of alternative medicine have promoted a fictitious condition called "candidiasis hypersensitivity" and sold dietary supplements as a supposed cure; a number of them have been prosecuted.[tpl]cite web |author=Barrett S |title=Dubious "Yeast Allergies" |url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/candida.html |date=2005-10-08 |publisher=QuackWatch |accessdate=2008-02-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ncahf.org/articles/c-d/candida.html |title=Candidiasis Hypersensitivity |accessdate=January 2014 |publisher=National Council Against Health Fraud |author=Jarvis WT[/tpl]
In 1990, alternative health vendor Nature's Way signed an FTC consent agreement not to misrepresent in advertising any self-diagnostic test concerning yeast conditions or to make any unsubstantiated representation concerning any food or supplement's ability to control yeast conditions, with a fine of $30,000 payable to the National Institutes of Health for research in genuine candidiasis.
