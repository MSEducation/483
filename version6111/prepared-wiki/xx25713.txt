The Yeti or Abominable Snowman (Nepali: हिममानव, lit. "mountain man") is an ape-like cryptid taller than an average human that is said to inhabit the Himalayan region of Nepal and Tibet.[tpl]Cite book | last = Eberhart| first = George| title = Mysterious Creatures: A Guide to Cryptozoology| publisher = ABC-CLIO| year = 2002| page = 613| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=z9gMsCUtCZUC&pg=PA613| isbn = 978-1-57607-283-7[/tpl] The names Yeti and Meh-Teh are commonly used by the people indigenous to the region, and are part of their history and mythology. Stories of the Yeti first emerged as a facet of Western popular culture in the 19th century.
The scientific community generally regards the Yeti as a legend, given the lack of conclusive evidence,[tpl]cite book |title=Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality |author=Napier, John  |year= 2005 |isbn=0-525-06658-6 |publisher=N. Abbot |location=London[/tpl] but it remains one of the most famous creatures of cryptozoology. Analysis of samples associated with claimed yetis found a sequence of mitochondrial DNA that matched a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone found in Norway, that dates back to between 40,000 and 120,000 years ago.

==Etymology and alternate names==

The word Yeti is derived from [tpl]bo|t=གཡའ་དྲེད་|w=g.ya' dred|z=Yachê[/tpl]), a compound of the words [tpl]bo|t=གཡའ་|w=g.ya'|z=ya[/tpl] "rocky", "rocky place" and ([tpl]bo|t=དྲེད་|w=dred|z=chê[/tpl]) "bear".[tpl]cite journal |author=Pranavananda, Swami |title=The Abominable Snowman | journal=Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society | volume= 54|year=1957[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Stonor, Charles|date=30 January 1954|journal=The Statesman in Calcutta[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Swan, Lawrence W.|title=Abominable Snowman|date=18 April 1958|journal=Science |pages=882–884|volume=127| issue = 3303|pmid=17733822 |doi=10.1126/science.127.3303.882-b[/tpl]Izzard, Ch. 2, pp. 21–22.[tpl]cite book |author= Heuvelmans, Bernard | title=On the Track of Unknown Animals| page=164|publisher= Rupert Hart-Davis | year=1958[/tpl] Pranavananda states that the words "ti", "te" and "teh" are derived from the spoken word 'tre' (spelled "dred"), Tibetan for bear, with the 'r' so softly pronounced as to be almost inaudible, thus making it "te" or "teh".Izzard, Ch. 2, p. 199.[tpl]cite book |title=The Sherpa and the Snowman|author=Stonor, Charles |year=1955 Daily Mail |publisher=Hollis and Carter[/tpl]
Other terms used by Himalayan peoples do not translate exactly the same, but refer to legendary and indigenous wildlife:

===The "Abominable Snowman"===

The appellation "Abominable Snowman" was coined in 1921, the same year Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Howard-Bury led the joint Alpine Club and Royal Geographical Society "Everest Reconnaissance Expedition"[tpl]cite journal |author= Howard-Bury, Charles |date=February 1921|title=Some Observations on the Approaches to Mount Everest | journal=The Geographical Journal|volume= 57|pages=121–124|doi=10.2307/1781561|issue= 2 |jstor= 1781561 |publisher= The Geographical Journal, Vol. 57, No. 2 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author= Yourghusband, Francis; Collie, H.

He adds that his Sherpa guides "at once volunteered that the tracks must be that of 'The Wild Man of the Snows', to which they gave the name 'metoh-kangmi'". "Metoh" translates as "man-bear" and "Kang-mi" translates as "snowman".Izzard, Ch. 2, p. 21.
Confusion exists between Howard-Bury's recitation of the term "metoh-kangmi" and the term used in Bill Tilman's book Mount Everest, 1938Tilman, pp. 127–137 where Tilman had used the words "metch", which does not exist in the Tibetan language,Izzard, Ch. 2, p. 24. and "kangmi" when relating the coining of the term "Abominable Snowman".[tpl]cite journal |author=Straus, William L., Jr., |journal=Science|volume= 123|title=Abominable Snowman|date=8 June 1956|pages= 1024–1025| issue= 3206|doi=10.1126/science.123.3206.1024 [/tpl] Further evidence of "metch" being a misnomer is provided by Tibetan language authority Professor David Snellgrove from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London (ca. 1956), who dismissed the word "metch" as impossible, because the consonants "t-c-h" cannot be conjoined in the Tibetan language." Documentation suggests that the term "metch-kangmi" is derived from one source (from the year 1921). It has been suggested that "metch" is simply a misspelling of "metoh".
The use of "Abominable Snowman" began when Henry Newman, a longtime contributor to The Statesman in Calcutta, writing under the pen name "Kim", interviewed the porters of the "Everest Reconnaissance expedition" on their return to Darjeeling.[tpl]cite journal |author= Kirtley, Bacil F. | title=Unknown Hominids and New World legends | pages=77–90|journal=Western Folklore | volume=23|date=April 1964| doi=10.2307/1498256 | issue= 1304 |jstor= 1498256[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author= Masters, John | title=The Abominable Snowman | page=31|publisher= Harpers | volume=CCXVIII|date=January 1959 | issue= 1304[/tpl][tpl]cite book |author= Heuvelmans, Bernard  | title=On the Track of Unknown Animals| page=129 |publisher= Rupert Hart-Davis | year=1958[/tpl] Newman mistranslated the word "metoh" as "filthy", substituting the term "abominable", perhaps out of artistic license.Izzard, Ch. 2, p. 23. As author Bill Tilman recounts, "Newman wrote long after in a letter to The Times: The whole story seemed such a joyous creation I sent it to one or two newspapers'".

==History==

===Pre-19th century===

According to H. Siiger, the Yeti was a part of the pre-Buddhist beliefs of several Himalayan people. He was told that the Lepcha people worshipped a "Glacier Being" as a God of the Hunt. He also reported that followers of the Bön religion once believed the blood of the "mi rgod" or "wild man" had use in certain mystical ceremonies. The being was depicted as an apelike creature who carries a large stone as a weapon and makes a whistling swoosh sound.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=B0C-IhEKrSEC&pg=PA423|chapter=The Abominable Snowman |author=Siiger, H. |title=Himalayan anthropology: the Indo-Tibetan interface |editor =Fisher, James F. |page=423|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=9789027977007|year=1978[/tpl]

===19th century===

In 1832, James Prinsep's Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal published trekker B. H. Hodgson's account of his experiences in northern Nepal. His local guides spotted a tall, bipedal creature covered with long dark hair, which seemed to flee in fear. Hodgson concluded it was an orangutan.
An early record of reported footprints appeared in 1899 in Laurence Waddell's Among the Himalayas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cryptozoology.com/cryptids/yeti.php |title=Yeh-Teh: "That Thing There" |publisher=Cryptozoology.com |accessdate=27 January 2012[/tpl] Waddell reported his guide's description of a large apelike creature that left the prints, which Waddell thought were made by a bear. Waddell heard stories of bipedal, apelike creatures but wrote that "none, however, of the many Tibetans I have interrogated on this subject could ever give me an authentic case. On the most superficial investigation it always resolved into something that somebody heard tell of."[tpl]cite book |author=Waddell, Laurence Austine |title=Among the Himalayas |year=1899 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PueCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA223 |page=223 |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co.[/tpl]

===20th century===

The frequency of reports increased during the early 20th century, when Westerners began making determined attempts to scale the many mountains in the area and occasionally reported seeing odd creatures or strange tracks.
In 1925, N. A. Tombazi, a photographer and member of the Royal Geographical Society, writes that he saw a creature at about [tpl]convert|15000|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] near Zemu Glacier. Tombazi later wrote that he observed the creature from about [tpl]convert|200|to|300|yd|abbr=on[/tpl], for about a minute. "Unquestionably, the figure in outline was exactly like a human being, walking upright and stopping occasionally to pull at some dwarf rhododendron bushes. It showed up dark against the snow, and as far as I could make out, wore no clothes." About two hours later, Tombazi and his companions descended the mountain and saw the creature's prints, described as "similar in shape to those of a man, but only six to seven inches long by four inches wide...[tpl]convert|6|to|7|in|abbr=on[/tpl], [tpl]convert|4|in|abbr=on[/tpl] The prints were undoubtedly those of a biped."Abell, George Ogden and Singer, Barry (1981) Science and The Paranormal: Probing the Existence of The Supernatural, Scribner, p. 32. ISBN 0-684-16655-0.
Western interest in the Yeti peaked dramatically in the 1950s. While attempting to scale Mount Everest in 1951, Eric Shipton took photographs of a number of large prints in the snow, at about [tpl]convert|6000|m|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level. These photos have been subject to intense scrutiny and debate. Some argue they are the best evidence of Yeti's existence, while others contend the prints are those of a mundane creature that have been distorted by the melting snow.Wells, C. (2008). Who's Who in British Climbing, The Climbing Company, ISBN 0955660106.
Peter Byrne reported finding a yeti footprint in 1948, in northern Sikkim, India near the Zemu Glacier, while on holiday from a Royal Air Force assignment in India.[tpl]Cite book | last = McLeod| first = Michael| title = Anatomy of a beast: obsession and myth on the trail of Bigfoot| publisher = University of California Press| year = 2009| page = 54| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=_6FmjJYd13wC&pg=PA54| isbn = 978-0-520-25571-5[/tpl]
In 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reported seeing large footprints while scaling Mount Everest. Hillary would later discount Yeti reports as unreliable. In his first autobiography Tenzing said that he believed the Yeti was a large ape, and although he had never seen it himself his father had seen one twice, but in his second autobiography he said he had become much more skeptical about its existence.[tpl]cite book |title=Man of Everest — The Autobiography of Tenzing|author=Tenzing Norgay (told to and written by James Ramsey Ullman) |year=1955 |publisher=George Harrap & Co, Ltd[/tpl]
During the Daily Mail Snowman Expedition of 1954,[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070310233806/http://www.cabernet.demon.co.uk/JAJ/snowman1954/1954-snowman-team.html |title=Daily Mail Team Will Seek Snowman |publisher=Cabernet.demon.co.uk |accessdate=27 January 2012[/tpl] the mountaineering leader John Angelo Jackson made the first trek from Everest to Kanchenjunga in the course of which he photographed symbolic paintings of the Yeti at Tengboche gompa.[tpl]cite book |title=Adventure Travels in the Himalaya (pp135-152)|author=Jackson, John Angelo |page=136|year= 2005|chapter=Chapter 17|isbn=81-7387-175-2 |publisher=Indus Pub. Co. |location=New Delhi[/tpl] Jackson tracked and photographed many footprints in the snow, most of which were identifiable. However, there were many large footprints which could not be identified. These flattened footprint-like indentations were attributed to erosion and subsequent widening of the original footprint by wind and particles.
On 19 March 1954, the Daily Mail printed an article which described expedition teams obtaining hair specimens from what was alleged to be a Yeti scalp found in the Pangboche monastery. The hairs were black to dark brown in colour in dim light, and fox red in sunlight. The hair was analysed by Professor Frederic Wood Jones,[tpl]cite journal|author=Dobson, Jessie | title= Obituary: 79, Frederic Wood-Jones, F.R.S.: 1879–1954 |journal=Man | volume=56 |date=June 1956 |pages=82–83[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author= Wilfred E. le Gros Clark| title= Frederic Wood-Jones, 1879–1954 |journal=Biographical memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society | volume= 1 |date=November 1955 | pages=118–134| doi= 10.1098/rsbm.1955.0009[/tpl] an expert in human and comparative anatomy. During the study, the hairs were bleached, cut into sections and analysed microscopically. The research consisted of taking microphotographs of the hairs and comparing them with hairs from known animals such as bears and orangutans. Jones concluded that the hairs were not actually from a scalp. He contended that while some animals do have a ridge of hair extending from the pate to the back, no animals have a ridge (as in the Pangboche "scalp") running from the base of the forehead across the pate and ending at the nape of the neck. Jones was unable to pinpoint exactly the animal from which the Pangboche hairs were taken. He was, however, convinced that the hairs were not of a bear or anthropoid ape. He suggested that the hairs were from the shoulder of a coarse-haired hoofed animal.Izzard
Sławomir Rawicz claimed in his book The Long Walk, published in 1956, that as he and some others were crossing the Himalayas in the winter of 1940, their path was blocked for hours by two bipedal animals that were doing seemingly nothing but shuffling around in the snow.
Beginning in 1957, a very wealthy American oilman Tom Slick funded a few missions to investigate Yeti reports. In 1959, supposed Yeti feces were collected by one of Slick's expeditions; fecal analysis found a parasite which could not be classified. Cryptozoologist Bernard Heuvelmans wrote, "Since each animal has its own parasites, this indicated that the host animal is equally an unknown animal."Coleman, Loren (1989) Tom Slick and the Search for Yeti, Faber & Faber, ISBN 0-571-12900-5Coleman, Loren (2002) Tom Slick: True Life Encounters in Cryptozoology, Fresno, California: Linden Press, ISBN 0-941936-74-0. The United States government thought that finding the Yeti was likely enough to create three rules for American expeditions searching for it: obtain a Nepalese permit, do not harm the Yeti except in self-defense, and let the Nepalese government approve any news reporting on the animal's discovery.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2011/09/02/documents-show-feds-believed-in-yeti?google_editors_picks=true | title=Documents Show Feds Believed in the Yeti | work=US News and World Report | date=2 September 2011 | accessdate=2 September 2011 | author=Bedard, Paul; Fox, Lauren[/tpl]
In 1959, actor James Stewart, while visiting India, reportedly smuggled remains of a supposed Yeti, the so-called Pangboche Hand, by concealing it in his luggage when he flew from India to London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.anomalist.com/milestones/stewart.html |title=Milestones – Jimmy Stewart |publisher=Anomalist.com |date=2 July 1997 |accessdate=27 January 2012[/tpl]
In 1960, Hillary mounted an expedition to collect and analyze physical evidence of the Yeti. He sent a supposed Yeti "scalp" from the Khumjung monastery to the West for testing, whose results indicated the scalp was manufactured from the skin of a serow, a goat-like Himalayan antelope.
Up to the 1960s, belief in the yeti was relatively common in Bhutan and in 1966 a Bhutanese stamp was made to honor the creature.[tpl]cite news |title=New Bhutan Stamp Shows 'Abomidable Snowman' |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QrhIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UQENAAAAIBAJ&pg=5041,5654462 |newspaper=Associated Press via The Morning Record |date=10 10 December 1966 |author=Kronish, Syd [/tpl] However, in the twenty-first century belief in the being has declined.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-08-17/news/17125008_1_bhutan-yeti-abominable-snowman |author=Sullivan, Tim  |agency=Associated Press |date=17 August 2008 |title=Yeti myth dying out as Bhutan modernizes[/tpl]
In 1970, British mountaineer Don Whillans claimed to have witnessed a creature when scaling Annapurna.Perrin, Jim (2005) The villain: the life of Don Whillans, The Mountaineers Books, pp. 261–2, ISBN 0099416727. According to Whillans, while scouting for a campsite, he heard some odd cries which his Sherpa guide attributed to a Yeti's call. That night, he saw a dark shape moving near his camp. The next day, he observed a few human-like footprints in the snow, and that evening, viewed with binoculars a bipedal, ape-like creature for 20 minutes as it apparently searched for food not far from his camp.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
In 1983, Himalayan conservationist Daniel C. Taylor and Himalayan natural historian Robert L. Fleming Jr. led a yeti expedition into Nepal’s Barun Valley (suggested by discovery in the Barun in 1972 of footprints alleged to be yeti by Cronin & McNeely Cronin, Edward W. (1979) The Arun: A Natural History of the World's Deepest Valley, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, p.153, ISBN 0395262992.). The Taylor-Fleming expedition also discovered similar yeti-like footprints (hominoid appearing with both a hallux and bipedal gait), intriguing large nests in trees, and vivid reports from local villagers of two bears, rukh balu ('tree bear', small, reclusive, weighing about 150 pounds) and bhui balu ('ground bear,' aggressive, weighing up to 400 pounds). Further interviews across Nepal gave evidence of local belief in two different bears. Skulls were collected, these were compared to known skulls at the Smithsonian Institution, American Museum of Natural History, and British Museum, and confirmed identification of a single species, the Asiatic Black Bear, showing no morphological difference between 'tree bear' and 'ground bear.' Taylor, pp. 106–120. (This despite an intriguing skull in the British Museum of a 'tree bear' collected in 1869 by Oldham and discussed in the Annals of the Royal Zoological Society .).
There is a famous Yeti hoax, known as the Snow Walker Film. The footage was created for Paramount's UPN show, Paranormal Borderland, ostensibly by the show's producers. The show ran from 12 March to 6 August 1996. Fox purchased and used the footage in their later program on The World's Greatest Hoaxes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bigfootencounters.com/films/snowwalker.htm |title=Snow Walker Film |publisher=Bigfootencounters.com |date=6 August 1996 |accessdate=27 January 2012[/tpl]

In 2004, Henry Gee, editor of the journal Nature, mentioned the Yeti as an example of a legend deserving further study, writing, "The discovery that Homo floresiensis survived until so very recently, in geological terms, makes it more likely that stories of other mythical, human-like creatures such as Yetis are founded on grains of truth ... Now, cryptozoology, the study of such fabulous creatures, can come in from the cold."[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1038/news041025-2|title=Flores, God and Cryptozoology|year=2004|last1=Gee|first1=Henry|journal=News@nature[/tpl]

On 25 July 2008, the BBC reported that hairs collected in the remote Garo Hills area of North-East India by Dipu Marak had been analyzed at Oxford Brookes University in the UK by primatologist Anna Nekaris and microscopy expert Jon Wells. These initial tests were inconclusive, and ape conservation expert Ian Redmond told the BBC that there was similarity between the cuticle pattern of these hairs and specimens collected by Edmund Hillary during Himalayan expeditions in the 1950s and donated to the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, and announced planned DNA analysis.[tpl]cite news|last=Lawson|first=Alastair|title='Yeti hair' to get DNA analysis|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7525060.stm|publisher=BBC|date=25 July 2008[/tpl] This analysis has since revealed that the hair came from the Himalayan Goral.'Yeti hairs' belong to a goat By Alastair Lawson — BBC News  – 11:20 GMT, Monday, 13 October 2008

A well publicised expedition to Bhutan reported that a hair sample had been obtained which by DNA analysis by Professor Bryan Sykes could not be matched to any known animal.Mystery Primate. The Statesmen Analysis completed after the media release, however, clearly showed the samples were from a Brown bear (Ursus arctos) and an Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus).[tpl]cite book |author=Chandler, H.C.|year=2003|title= Using Ancient DNA to Link Culture and Biology in Human Populations | publisher=Unpublished D.

In 1986, South Tyrolean mountaineer Reinhold Messner claimed to have a face-to-face encounter with a Yeti. He wrote a book, My Quest for the Yeti, and claims to have killed one. According to Messner, the Yeti is actually the endangered Himalayan brown bear, Ursus arctos isabellinus, or Tibetan blue bear, U. a. pruinosus, which can walk both upright or on all fours.Trull, D.

The 1983 Barun Valley discoveries prompted three years of research on the 'tree bear' possibility by Taylor, Fleming, John Craighead and Tirtha Shrestha. From that research the conclusion was that the Asiatic Black Bear, when about two years old, spends much time in trees to avoid attack by larger male bears on the ground ('ground bears'). During this tree period that may last two years, young bears train their inner claw outward, allowing an opposable grip. The imprint in the snow of a hind paw coming over the front paw that appears to have a hallux, especially when the bear is going slightly uphill so the hind paw print extends the overprint backward makes a hominoid-appearing track, both in that it is elongated like a human foot but with a “thumb” and in that a four-footed animal’s gait now appears bipedal.Covey, Jacob (2006) Beasts: Traditional Hidden Creatures, Seattle, Washington, Fantagraphic Books/WW Norton, pp. 191–93.  This “yeti discovery”, in the words of National Geographic Magazine editor Bill Garrett,  “by on-site research sweeps away much of the ‘smoke and mirrors’ and gives us a believable yeti”.Taylor, back cover.
This fieldwork in Nepal’s Barun Valley led directly to initiating in 1984 Makalu-Barun National Park that protected over half a million acres in 1991, and across the border with China the Qomolangma national nature preserve in the Tibet Autonomous Region that protected over six million acres. In the words of Honorary President of the American Alpine Club, Robert H. Bates, this yeti discovery "has apparently solved the mystery of the yeti, or at least part of it, and in so doing added to the world’s great wildlife preserves"[tpl]cite book|author=Davis, Wade |title=The Clouded Leopard: A Book of Travels|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YLIdAQAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|isbn=978-1-84511-453-4[/tpl] such that the shy animal that lives in trees (and not the high snows), and mysteries and myths of the Himalayas that it represents, can continue within a protected area nearly the size of Switzerland.
In 2003, Japanese researcher and mountaineer Dr. Makoto Nebuka published the results of his twelve-year linguistic study, postulating that the word "Yeti" is a corruption of the word "meti", a regional dialect term for a "bear". Nebuka claims that ethnic Tibetans fear and worship the bear as a supernatural being.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/Tib.htm |title=Tibet: Mystic Trivia |publisher=Iras.ucalgary.ca |date=26 September 1998 |accessdate=27 January 2012[/tpl] Nebuka's claims were subject to almost immediate criticism, and he was accused of linguistic carelessness. Dr. Raj Kumar Pandey, who has researched both Yetis and mountain languages, said "it is not enough to blame tales of the mysterious beast of the Himalayas on words that rhyme but mean different things."[tpl]cite news|author=Lak, Daniel |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3143020.stm |title= Yeti's 'non-existence' hard to bear |publisher=BBC News |date=26 September 2003 |accessdate=27 January 2012[/tpl]
Some speculate these reported creatures could be present-day specimens of the extinct giant ape Gigantopithecus.Gilman, Laura Anne (2002) Yeti, The Abominable Snowman, The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc., ISBN 0-8239-3565-5Schmalzer, Sigrid (2008) The People's Peking Man: Popular Science and Human Identity in Twentieth-century China, The University of Chicago Press, p. 220, ISBN 978-0-226-73859-8Shrestha, Tej Kumar  (1997) Mammals of Nepal, Nepal: R.

In 2013 a call was put out by scientists from the universities of Oxford and Lausanne for people claiming to have samples from these sorts of creatures. A mitochondrial DNA analysis of the 12S RNA gene was undertaken on samples of hair from an unidentified animal from Ladakh in northern India on the west of the Himalayas, and one from Bhutan. These samples were compared with those in GenBank, the international repository of gene sequences, and matched a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone found in Svalbard, Norway, that dates back to between 40,000 and 120,000 years ago.[tpl]cite web|title=British scientist 'solves' mystery of Himalayan yetis|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24564487|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 October 2013[/tpl]  The result suggests that, barring hoaxes of planted samples or contamination, bears in these regions may have been taken to be yeti.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/17/yeti-dna-ancient-polar-bear-scientists |title=Has DNA really solved the mystery of the yeti? |author=Alok Jha |work=Guardian |date= 17 October 2013 [/tpl] Professor of evolutionary genetics at the University of Cambridge Bill Amos doubted the samples were of polar bears in the Himalayas, but was "90% convinced that there is a bear in these regions that has been mistaken for a yeti". Professor Brian Sykes whose team carried out the analysis of the samples at Oxford university has his own theory. He believes that the samples may have come from a hybrid species of bear produced from a mating between a brown bear and a polar bear. Sykes told the BBC:
[tpl]cquote|I think this bear, which nobody has seen alive, may still be there and may have quite a lot of polar bear in it. It may be some sort of hybrid and if its behaviour is different from normal bears, which is what eyewitnesses report, then I think that may well be the source of the mystery and the source of the legend.|author=Dr. Bryan Sykes|source=BBC News (17 October 2013)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24564487|title=British scientist 'solves' mystery of Himalayan yetis|author=Staff|date=17 October 2013 |work=BBC News|accessdate=22 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Lawless |first=Jill |title=DNA Links Mysterious Yeti To Ancient Polar Bear |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20131017/DA9G5VB01.html |date=17 October 2013 |work=AP News |accessdate=22 October 2013 [/tpl][/tpl]

==In popular culture==

The Yeti has regularly been depicted in films, literature, music and video games.

==Art==

Artist Stanisław Szukalski's works all involve the Yeti; this involved painting, sculpture, and 2 books full of his artistic works: Inner Portraits (1980) and A Trough Full of Pearls / Behold! The Protong (1982). Szukalski also developed a philosophy known as Zermatism in which the Yeti play a central role, along with the Sons of Yeti ("Yetinsyny"), the half-breed offspring of Yetis and humans.

===Films===

Significant film appearances include The Snow Creature (1954), Half Human (1955), The Abominable Snowman (1957), Snowbeast (1977), Yeti: A Love Story (2006), Chill Out, Scooby-Doo! (2007), The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008), Yeti: Curse of the Snow Demon (2008), and Rage of the Yeti (2011).

===Television===

The Yeti plays significant roles in some television shows including:

===Video games===

Several video games feature yeti-like creatures in prominent roles. For example:

===Literature===

In literature the Yeti has appeared prominently in many works, including Tintin in Tibet by Hergé, in Martin Mystère by Alfredo Castelli, in The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena by R. L. Stine and a gamebook in the Choose Your Own Adventure series.
The Abominable Snowman is a superhero character in the Marvel Comics publications and the Snowman is a similar character in DC Comics.

===Music===

American heavy metal band High On Fire included their song "The Yeti" on their second album Surrounded by Thieves. Rock band Clutch have a track entitled "The Yeti" on their third album The Elephant Riders. A psychedelic trance collaboration called The Mystery of the Yeti, featuring many prominent names of the genre, was released on two albums between the years 1996 to 1999.
