The Visovac  Monastery ([tpl]lang-hr|Samostan Visovac[/tpl]) is a Catholic (Roman Rite) monastery on the island of Visovac in the Krka National Park, Croatia. Visovac was settled by Augustinian monks, who established a small monastery and church dedicated to the Apostle Paul in the 14th century. In 1445 the Augustinian monastery was enlarged and adapted by the Franciscans who settled here having withdrawn from parts of Bosnia with other, ordinary people, when the Turks had taken over there. A new monastery was built in the 18th century. The rich monastery library includes particularly rare incunabula of Aesop's fables (Brescia 1487) printed by the Lastovo printer Dobrić Dobričević (s. Lastovo), a collection of documents (the sultan's edicts) and a sabre belonging to Vuk Mandušić, one of the best-loved heroes of Serbian epic poetry.Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pg. 208, Zagreb (1999), ISBN 953-178-097-8
It is part of the Franciscan Province of the Most Holy Redeemer based in Split.
