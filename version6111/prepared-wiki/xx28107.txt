[[Thyine wood]]

CATEGORIES: Wood, History of furniture

Thyine wood is a 15th-century English name for a wood from the tree known botanically as Tetraclinis articulata (syn. Callitris quadrivalvis, Thuja articulata). The name is derived from the Greek word thuon, "fragrant wood," or possibly thuein, “to sacrifice”, and it was so called because it was burnt in sacrifices, on account of its fragrance.
At Rome, wood from this tree was called citrum, "citrus wood". It was reckoned very valuable, and was used for making articles of furniture by the Greeks and Romans. Craftsmen who worked in citrus wood and ivory had their own guild (collegium).Eborarii and citriarii: Koenraad Verboven, "The Associative Order: Status and Ethos among Roman Businessmen in Late Republic and Early Empire," Athenaeum 95 (2007), preprint p. 21.
Thyine wood is mentioned in the King James Version of the Bible at Rev. 18:12 as being among the articles which would cease to be purchased when Babylon fell.  The New International Version translates the passage "citron wood"; the Amplified Bible translates it as "scented wood".
The resin is used as the basis for euparal, a mounting medium used in microscopy.
