[[Berlage (crater)]]

CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Berlage is an old lunar crater that lies in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. The smaller crater Bellinsgauzen is attached to its northern rim, and Cabannes is less than one crater diameter to the northwest. To the east-northeast of Berlage is Lema√Ætre.
This formation is unusual for the high density of small impact craters that lie across the interior and along the rim, especially in the northern half. The crater is heavily eroded, and the original features have been worn down with the passage of time. A combination of three small craters lie across the northern rim, at the eastern edge of the rim where Berlage is joined to Bellinsgauzen.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Berlage.
