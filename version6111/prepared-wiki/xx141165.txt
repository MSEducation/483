Columbia Yachts is a US manufacturer of sailboats, with offices and production facilities in Southern California.

==History==

Richard “Dick” Valdes  and Maurice V. Threinen founded Glas Laminates, a fiberglass contract company, in 1958.  Among the early products were camper shells and producing canoes for Sears.  The company eventually focused its development expertise on sailboats and became Glass Marine Industries (GMI), marketing their boats under the Columbia nameplate. Early models included the Columbia 24 and Columbia 29 (Sparkman & Stephens design). By 1964 company sales passed $2.5 Million.
In 1965, GMI changed its name to Columbia, and  introduced the Columbia 50, at the time the world's largest fiberglass production sailboat. The classic beauty, exceptional comfort, and race performance made this design a success.  During the mid sixties Columbia produced a few motor yachts.
By the late 1960s,the company was the world's largest fiberglass sailboat manufacturer with manufacturing plants throughout the world.  Valdes and Threinen sold the company to Whittaker (listed on the NYSE), but Valdes continued as president of the subsidiary Columbia Yacht Corporation, and helped to develop Whittaker Marine Group, which ultimately included Bertram Yachts, Trojan Yachts, Riva, Desco Marine, Kettenburg, Balboa Marine, and Coronado Yachts. Total sales of the Whittaker Marine Group reached between $250 and $350 Million in the early 70's during Valdes' tenure.  A side note is that Frank Butler, the owner of Coronado Yachts came into Whittaker with the merger, but left about a year later to form Catalina Yachts.
Following Dick Valdes' departure from Columbia Yachts in 1972, the company offices and plant were relocated to Virginia, and eventually sold to Hughes Boat Works based in Huron Park, Ontario Canada in 1979, and later to Aura Yachts also based in Huron Park, Ontario in 1982. In the mid-80's Canadian boat designer Howard Hughes regained control of the company. Eventually, the Columbia Yachts brand faded into history.
