Ashmont is surrounded by numerous lakes, such as Upper Mann Lake, Batty Lake, Lottie Lake, Floatingstone Lake and Garner Lake. Many provincial recreation areas are established on the shores of these lakes. 
Ashmont began as a farming community in the early part of the 20th century.  At its peak in the 1960s it boasted a grain elevator, four general stores, a pool hall, Legion Hall, two gas stations and a school.  As is typical of many small rural communities it has fallen on hard times.  Only one store remains, kept alive by the local lake communities and a relatively large school (K to 12).
