Prostate cancer is a form of cancer that develops in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Most prostate cancers are slow growing;[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article5710450.ece |title=Urine test could speed treatment of prostate cancer |author=Sam Lister |date=February 11, 2009 |work= |publisher=The Sunday Times |accessdate=9 August 2010 |location=London[/tpl] however, there are cases of aggressive prostate cancers."ACS :: What Is Prostate Cancer?"

Prostate cancer may cause pain, difficulty in urinating, problems during sexual intercourse, erectile dysfunction, or death. Other symptoms can potentially develop during later stages of the disease.
Rates of detection of prostate cancers vary widely across the world, with South and East Asia detecting less frequently than in Europe, and especially the United States.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.jncicancerspectrum.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/statContent/cspectfstat;99  | title=IARC Worldwide Cancer Incidence Statistics—Prostate | publisher=Oxford University Press | work=JNCI Cancer Spectrum | date=December 19, 2001 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060205235509/http://www.jncicancerspectrum.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/statContent/cspectfstat;99 |archivedate = February 5, 2006[/tpl] Retrieved on 5 April 2007 through the Internet Archive Prostate cancer tends to develop in men over the age of fifty.

However, many men with prostate cancer never have symptoms, undergo no therapy, and eventually die of other unrelated causes. Many factors, including genetics and diet, have been implicated in the development of prostate cancer. Recently the prevalence of light pollution has been implicated in the development of prostate cancer.[tpl]cite book|last=Haim|first=Abraham|title=Light Pollution as new risk factor for human Breast and Prostate cancers|year=2013|isbn=978-94-007-6220-6[/tpl]
The presence of prostate cancer may be indicated by symptoms, physical examination, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), or biopsy. Prostate-specific antigen testing increases cancer detection but does not decrease mortality.  The United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2012 recommended against screening for prostate cancer using the PSA testing, due to the risk of over-diagnosis and over-treatment with most prostate cancer remaining asymptomatic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/prostatecancerscreening/prostatecancerscript.pdf |title=Talking With Your Patients About Screening for Prostate Cancer |format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-02[/tpl]  The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefit of testing does not outweigh the expected harms.
Management strategies for prostate cancer should be guided by the severity of the disease. Many low-risk tumors can be safely followed with active surveillance. Curative treatment generally involves  surgery, various forms of radiation therapy, proton therapy or, less commonly, cryosurgery; hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are generally reserved for cases of advanced disease (although hormonal therapy may be given with radiation in some cases). Several studies suggest that masturbation reduces the risk of prostate cancer, but the results are controversial.[tpl]cite journal|last=Leitzmann|first=MF|coauthors=Platz, EA; Stampfer, MJ; Willett, WC; Giovannucci, E|title=Ejaculation frequency and subsequent risk of prostate cancer.|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=Apr 7, 2004|volume=291|issue=13|pages=1578–86|pmid=15069045|doi=10.1001/jama.291.13.1578[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Giles|first=G.G.|coauthors=Severi, G.; English, D.R.; McCredie, M.R.E.; Borland, R.; Boyle, P.; Hopper, J.L.|title=Sexual factors and prostate cancer|journal=BJU International|date=23 July 2003|volume=92|issue=3|pages=211–216|doi=10.1046/j.1464-410X.2003.04319.x|pmid=12887469[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Dimitropoulou|first=P|coauthors=Lophatananon, A; Easton, D; Pocock, R; Dearnaley, DP; Guy, M; Edwards, S; O'Brien, L; Hall, A; Wilkinson, R; Eeles, R; Muir, KR; UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study, Collaborators; British Association of Urological Surgeons Section of, Oncology|title=Sexual activity and prostate cancer risk in men diagnosed at a younger age.|journal=BJU international|date=Jan 2009|volume=103|issue=2|pages=178–85|pmid=19016689|doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2008.08030.x[/tpl]
The age and underlying health of the man, the extent of metastasis, appearance under the microscope and response of the cancer to initial treatment are important in determining the outcome of the disease. The decision whether or not to treat localized prostate cancer (a tumor that is contained within the prostate) with curative intent is a patient trade-off between the expected beneficial and harmful effects in terms of patient survival and quality of life.

==Signs and symptoms==

Early prostate cancer usually causes no symptoms. Sometimes, however, prostate cancer does cause symptoms, often similar to those of diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. These include frequent urination, nocturia (increased urination at night), difficulty starting and maintaining a steady stream of urine, hematuria (blood in the urine), and dysuria (painful urination). About a third of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer have one or more such symptoms, while two thirds have no symptoms.
Prostate cancer is associated with urinary dysfunction as the prostate gland surrounds the prostatic urethra. Changes within the gland, therefore, directly affect urinary function. Because the vas deferens deposits seminal fluid into the prostatic urethra, and secretions from the prostate gland itself are included in semen content, prostate cancer may also cause problems with sexual function and performance, such as difficulty achieving erection or painful ejaculation.[tpl]cite journal |author = Miller DC, Hafez KS, Stewart A, Montie JE, Wei JT |title = Prostate carcinoma presentation, diagnosis, and staging: an update form the National Cancer Data Base |journal = Cancer |volume = 98 |issue = 6 | pages = 1169–78 |date=September 2003 |doi = 10.1002/cncr.11635 |pmid=12973840 [/tpl]
Advanced prostate cancer can spread to other parts of the body, possibly causing additional symptoms. The most common symptom is bone pain, often in the vertebrae (bones of the spine), pelvis, or ribs. Spread of cancer into other bones such as the femur is usually to the proximal part of the bone. Prostate cancer in the spine can also compress the spinal cord, causing leg weakness and urinary and fecal incontinence.[tpl]cite journal |author = van der Cruijsen-Koeter IW, Vis AN, Roobol MJ, Wildhagen MF, de Koning HJ, van der Kwast TH, Schroder FH |title = Comparison of screen detected and clinically diagnosed prostate cancer in the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer, section rotterdam | journal = Urol |volume = 174 |issue = 1 |pages = 121–5 |date=July 2005 |pmid = 15947595 |doi = 10.1097/01.ju.0000162061.40533.0f [/tpl]

==Risk factors==

A complete understanding of the causes of prostate cancer remains elusive.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hsing AW, Chokkalingam AP | title = Prostate cancer epidemiology | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience | volume = 11 | issue =  | pages = 1388–413 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16368524 | doi = 10.2741/1891 [/tpl]  The primary risk factors are obesity, age and family history. Prostate cancer is very uncommon in men younger than 45, but becomes more common with advancing age. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 70.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hankey BF, Feuer EJ, Clegg LX, Hayes RB, Legler JM, Prorok PC, Ries LA, Merrill RM, Kaplan RS | title = Cancer surveillance series: interpreting trends in prostate cancer—part I: Evidence of the effects of screening in recent prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and survival rates | journal = J Natl Cancer Inst | volume = 91 | issue = 12 | pages = 1017–24 | date = June 16, 1999 | pmid = 10379964 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/91.12.1017 [/tpl] However, many men never know they have prostate cancer. Autopsy studies of Chinese, German, Israeli, Jamaican, Swedish, and Ugandan men who died of other causes have found prostate cancer in 30% of men in their 50s, and in 80% of men in their 70s.[tpl]cite journal | author = Breslow N, Chan CW, Dhom G, Drury RA, Franks LM, Gellei B, Lee YS, Lundberg S, Sparke B, Sternby NH, Tulinius H. | title = Latent carcinoma of prostate at autopsy in seven areas.

In the United States in 2005, there were an estimated 230,000 new cases of prostate cancer and 30,000 deaths due to prostate cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Jemal A, Murray T, Ward E, Samuels A, Tiwari RC, Ghafoor A, Feuer EJ, Thun MJ | title = Cancer statistics, 2005 | journal = CA Cancer J Clin | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–30 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15661684 | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.55.1.10 [/tpl] Men with high blood pressure are more likely to develop prostate cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Martin RM, Vatten L, Gunnell D, Romundstad P | title = Blood pressure and risk of prostate cancer: cohort Norway (CONOR) | journal = Cancer Causes Control | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 463–72 |date=March 2010 | pmid = 19949849 | doi = 10.1007/s10552-009-9477-x [/tpl] There is a small increased risk of prostate cancer associated with lack of exercise.[tpl]cite journal | author = Friedenreich CM, Neilson, HK, Lynch, BM | title = State of the epidemiological evidence on physical activity and cancer prevention | journal = European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990) | volume = 46 | issue = 14 | pages = 2593–604 |date=Sep 2010 | pmid = 20843488 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejca.2010.07.028 [/tpl] A 2010 study found that prostate basal cells were the most common site of origin for prostate cancers.

===Genetic===

Genetic background may contribute to prostate cancer risk, as suggested by associations with race, family, and specific gene variants. Men who have a first-degree relative (father or brother) with prostate cancer have twice the risk of developing prostate cancer, and those with two first-degree relatives affected have a fivefold greater risk compared with men with no family history.[tpl]cite journal | author = Steinberg GD, Carter BS, Beaty TH, Childs B, Walsh PC | title = Family history and the risk of prostate cancer | journal = Prostate | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 337–47 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2251225 | doi = 10.1002/pros.2990170409 [/tpl] In the United States, prostate cancer more commonly affects black men than white or Hispanic men, and is also more deadly in black men.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gallagher RP, Fleshner N | title = Prostate cancer: 3.

Studies of twins in Scandinavia suggest that 40% of prostate cancer risk can be explained by inherited factors.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lichtenstein P, Holm NV, Verkasalo PK, Iliadou A, Kaprio J, Koskenvuo M, Pukkala E, Skytthe A, Hemminki K | title = Environmental and heritable factors in the causation of cancer--analyses of cohorts of twins from Sweden, Denmark, and Finland | journal = N.

No single gene is responsible for prostate cancer; many different genes have been implicated. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, important risk factors for ovarian cancer and breast cancer in women, have also been implicated in prostate cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Struewing JP, Hartge P, Wacholder S, Baker SM, Berlin M, McAdams M, Timmerman MM, Brody LC, Tucker MA | title = The risk of cancer associated with specific mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 among Ashkenazi Jews | journal = N.

Two large genome-wide association studies linking single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to prostate cancer were published in 2008.[tpl]cite journal|last=Eeles|first=RA|coauthors=Kote-Jarai, Z; Giles, GG; Olama, AA; Guy, M; Jugurnauth, SK; Mulholland, S; Leongamornlert, DA; Edwards, SM; Morrison, J; Field, HI; Southey, MC; Severi, G; Donovan, JL; Hamdy, FC; Dearnaley, DP; Muir, KR; Smith, C; Bagnato, M; Ardern-Jones, AT; Hall, AL; O'Brien, LT; Gehr-Swain, BN; Wilkinson, RA; Cox, A; Lewis, S; Brown, PM; Jhavar, SG; Tymrakiewicz, M; Lophatananon, A; Bryant, SL; UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study, Collaborators; British Association of Urological Surgeons' Section of, Oncology; UK ProtecT Study, Collaborators; Horwich, A; Huddart, RA; Khoo, VS; Parker, CC; Woodhouse, CJ; Thompson, A; Christmas, T; Ogden, C; Fisher, C; Jamieson, C; Cooper, CS; English, DR; Hopper, JL; Neal, DE; Easton, DF|title=Multiple newly identified loci associated with prostate cancer susceptibility|journal=Nature Genetics|date=March 2008|volume=40|issue=3|pages=316–21|pmid=18264097|doi=10.1038/ng.90[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Thomas|first=G|coauthors=Jacobs, KB; Yeager, M; Kraft, P; Wacholder, S; Orr, N; Yu, K; Chatterjee, N; Welch, R; Hutchinson, A; Crenshaw, A; Cancel-Tassin, G; Staats, BJ; Wang, Z; Gonzalez-Bosquet, J; Fang, J; Deng, X; Berndt, SI; Calle, EE; Feigelson, HS; Thun, MJ; Rodriguez, C; Albanes, D; Virtamo, J; Weinstein, S; Schumacher, FR; Giovannucci, E; Willett, WC; Cussenot, O; Valeri, A; Andriole, GL; Crawford, ED; Tucker, M; Gerhard, DS; Fraumeni JF, Jr; Hoover, R; Hayes, RB; Hunter, DJ; Chanock, SJ|title=Multiple loci identified in a genome-wide association study of prostate cancer|journal=Nature Genetics|date=March 2008|volume=40|issue=3|pages=310–5|pmid=18264096|doi=10.1038/ng.91[/tpl] These studies identified several SNPs which substantially affect the risk of prostate cancer. For example, individuals with TT allele pair at SNP rs10993994 were reported to be at 1.6 times higher risk of prostate cancer than those with the CC allele pair. This SNP explains part of the increased prostate cancer risk of African American men as compared to American men of European descent, since the C allele is much more prevalent in the latter; this SNP is located in the promoter region of the MSMB gene, thus affects the amount of MSMB protein synthesized and secreted by epithelial cells of the prostate.[tpl]cite journal|last=Whitaker|first=HC|coauthors=Kote-Jarai, Z; Ross-Adams, H; Warren, AY; Burge, J; George, A; Bancroft, E; Jhavar, S; Leongamornlert, D; Tymrakiewicz, M; Saunders, E; Page, E; Mitra, A; Mitchell, G; Lindeman, GJ; Evans, DG; Blanco, I; Mercer, C; Rubinstein, WS; Clowes, V; Douglas, F; Hodgson, S; Walker, L; Donaldson, A; Izatt, L; Dorkins, H; Male, A; Tucker, K; Stapleton, A; Lam, J; Kirk, J; Lilja, H; Easton, D; IMPACT Study Steering, Committee; IMPACT Study, Collaborators; UK GPCS, Collaborators; Cooper, C; Eeles, R; Neal, DE|title=The rs10993994 risk allele for prostate cancer results in clinically relevant changes in microseminoprotein-beta expression in tissue and urine|journal=PLoS ONE|date=Oct 13, 2010|volume=5|issue=10|pages=e13363|pmid=20967219|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013363|pmc=2954177|editor1-last=Vickers|editor1-first=Andrew[/tpl]

===Sexual factors===

Several case-control studies have shown that having many lifetime sexual partners or starting sexual activity early in life substantially increases the risk of prostate cancer.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dennis|first=LK|coauthors=Dawson, DV|title=Meta-analysis of measures of sexual activity and prostate cancer|journal=Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)|date=January 2002|volume=13|issue=1|pages=72–9|pmid=11805589|doi=10.1097/00001648-200201000-00012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Rosenblatt|first=KA|coauthors=Wicklund, KG; Stanford, JL|title=Sexual factors and the risk of prostate cancer|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=Jun 15, 2001|volume=153|issue=12|pages=1152–8|pmid=11415949|doi=10.1093/aje/153.12.1152[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Sarma|first=AV|coauthors=McLaughlin, JC; Wallner, LP; Dunn, RL; Cooney, KA; Schottenfeld, D; Montie, JE; Wei, JT|title=Sexual behavior, sexually transmitted diseases and prostatitis: the risk of prostate cancer in black men|journal=The Journal of Urology|date=September 2006|volume=176|issue=3|pages=1108–13|pmid=16890703|doi=10.1016/j.juro.2006.04.075[/tpl] This correlation suggests a sexually transmissible infection (STI) may cause some prostate cancer cases; however, many studies have unsuccessfully attempted to find such a link, especially when testing for STIs shortly before or after prostate cancer diagnosis.[tpl]cite journal|last=Strickler|first=HD|coauthors=Goedert, JJ|title=Sexual behavior and evidence for an infectious cause of prostate cancer|journal=Epidemiologic reviews|year=2001|volume=23|issue=1|pages=144–51|pmid=11588840|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.epirev.a000781[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Sutcliffe|first=S|coauthors=Platz, EA|title=Inflammation and prostate cancer: a focus on infections|journal=Current urology reports|date=May 2008|volume=9|issue=3|pages=243–9|pmid=18765120|doi=10.1007/s11934-008-0042-z[/tpl] Studies testing for STIs a decade or more prior to prostate cancer diagnosis find a significant link between prostate cancer and various STIs (HPV-16, HPV-18 and HSV-2).[tpl]cite journal|last=Hisada|first=M|coauthors=Rabkin, CS; Strickler, HD; Wright, WE; Christianson, RE; van den Berg, BJ|title=Human papillomavirus antibody and risk of prostate cancer|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=Jan 19, 2000|volume=283|issue=3|pages=340–1|pmid=10647795[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Dennis|first=LK|coauthors=Coughlin, JA; McKinnon, BC; Wells, TS; Gaydos, CA; Hamsikova, E; Gray, GC|title=Sexually transmitted infections and prostate cancer among men in the U.S. military|journal=Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology|date=October 2009|volume=18|issue=10|pages=2665–71|pmid=19755645|doi=10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-08-1167[/tpl] This evidence could be explained by a yet-to-be-identified sexually transmissible infection and a long latency period between onset of infection and prostate cancer.

==Pathophysiology==

The prostate is a part of the male reproductive system that helps make and store seminal fluid. In adult men, a typical prostate is about 3 centimeters long and weighs about 20 grams.[tpl]Cite book| last=Aumüller| first=G.| title=Prostate Gland and Seminal Vesicles| publisher=Springer-Verlag| location=Berlin-Heidelberg| year=1979[/tpl] It is located in the pelvis, under the urinary bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate surrounds part of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder during urination and semen during ejaculation.[tpl]Cite book| last=Moore| first=K.| coauthors=Dalley, A.| title=Clinically Oriented Anatomy| publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins| location=Baltimore, Maryland| year=1999| isbn=0-683-06132-1[/tpl] Because of its location, prostate diseases often affect urination, ejaculation, and rarely defecation. The prostate contains many small glands which make about 20 percent of the fluid constituting semen.[tpl]Cite book| last=Steive| first=H.| chapter=Männliche Genitalorgane| title=Handbuch der mikroskopischen Anatomie des Menschen. Vol. VII Part 2| pages=1–399| location=Berlin| publisher=Springer| year=1930[/tpl] In prostate cancer, the cells of these prostate glands mutate into cancer cells. The prostate glands require male hormones, known as androgens, to work properly. Androgens include testosterone, which is made in the testes; dehydroepiandrosterone, made in the adrenal glands; and dihydrotestosterone, which is converted from testosterone within the prostate itself. Androgens are also responsible for secondary sex characteristics such as facial hair and increased muscle mass.
Prostate cancer is classified as an adenocarcinoma, or glandular cancer, that begins when normal semen-secreting prostate gland cells mutate into cancer cells. The region of prostate gland where the adenocarcinoma is most common is the peripheral zone. Initially, small clumps of cancer cells remain confined to otherwise normal prostate glands, a condition known as carcinoma in situ or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Although there is no proof that PIN is a cancer precursor, it is closely associated with cancer. Over time, these cancer cells begin to multiply and spread to the surrounding prostate tissue (the stroma) forming a tumor. Eventually, the tumor may grow large enough to invade nearby organs such as the seminal vesicles or the rectum, or the tumor cells may develop the ability to travel in the bloodstream and lymphatic system. Prostate cancer is considered a malignant tumor because it is a mass of cells that can invade other parts of the body. This invasion of other organs is called metastasis. Prostate cancer most commonly metastasizes to the bones, lymph nodes, and may invade rectum, bladder and lower ureters after local progression. The route of metastasis to bone is thought to be venous as the prostatic venous plexus draining the prostate connects with the vertebral veins.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.med-ed.virginia.edu/courses/path/gu/prostate3.cfm | title = Male Genitals - Prostate Neoplasms | accessdate = 2011-04-28 | work = Pathology study images | publisher = University of Virginia School of Medicine | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yHQ19Rrp | archivedate = 2011-04-28 | quote = There are many connections between the prostatic venous plexus and the vertebral veins. The veins forming the prostatic plexus do not contain valves and it is thought that straining to urinate causes prostatic venous blood to flow in a reverse direction and enter the vertebral veins carrying malignant cells to the vertebral column.[/tpl]
The prostate is a zinc accumulating, citrate producing organ. The protein ZIP1 is responsible for the active transport of zinc into prostate cells. One of zinc's important roles is to change the metabolism of the cell in order to produce citrate, an important component of semen. The process of zinc accumulation, alteration of metabolism, and citrate production is energy inefficient, and prostate cells sacrifice enormous amounts of energy (ATP) in order to accomplish this task. Prostate cancer cells are generally devoid of zinc. This allows prostate cancer cells to save energy not making citrate, and utilize the new abundance of energy to grow and spread. The absence of zinc is thought to occur via a silencing of the gene that produces the transporter protein ZIP1. ZIP1 is now called a tumor suppressor gene product for the gene SLC39A1. The cause of the epigenetic silencing is unknown. Strategies which transport zinc into transformed prostate cells effectively eliminate these cells in animals. Zinc inhibits NF-κB pathways, is anti-proliferative, and induces apoptosis in abnormal cells.  Unfortunately, oral ingestion of zinc is ineffective since high concentrations of zinc into prostate cells is not possible without the active transporter, ZIP1.Journal-molecular cancer, review, 2006 5:17, [tpl]doi|10.1186/1476-4598-5-17[/tpl]
Loss of cancer suppressor genes, early in the prostatic carcinogenesis, have been localized to chromosomes 8p, 10q, 13q, and 16q. P53 mutations in the primary prostate cancer are relatively low and are more frequently seen in metastatic settings, hence, p53 mutations are late event in pathology of prostate cancer. Other tumor suppressor genes that are thought to play a role in prostate cancer include PTEN (gene) and KAI1. "Up to 70 percent of men with prostate cancer have lost one copy of the PTEN  gene at the time of diagnosis"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/59384.cfm |title=Scientists Discover Anti-Cancer Mechanism that Arrests Early Prostate Cancer |date=August 4, 2005 [/tpl]

==Diagnosis==

The American Cancer Society's position regarding early detection is "Research has not yet proven that the potential benefits of testing outweigh the harms of testing and treatment. The American Cancer Society believes that men should not be tested without learning about what we know and don’t know about the risks and possible benefits of testing and treatment.  Starting at age 50, (45 if African American or brother or father suffered from condition before age 65) talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of testing so you can decide if testing is the right choice for you."http://www.cancer.org/Healthy/FindCancerEarly/CancerScreeningGuidelines/american-cancer-society-guidelines-for-the-early-detection-of-cancer American Cancer Society American Cancer Society Guidelines for the early detection of cancer Cited: September 2011
The only test that can fully confirm the diagnosis of prostate cancer is a biopsy, the removal of small pieces of the prostate for microscopic examination. However, prior to a biopsy, less invasive testing can be conducted.
There are also several other tests that can be used to gather more information about the prostate and the urinary tract. Digital rectal examination (DRE) may allow a doctor to detect prostate abnormalities. Cystoscopy shows the urinary tract from inside the bladder, using a thin, flexible camera tube inserted down the urethra. Transrectal ultrasonography creates a picture of the prostate using sound waves from a probe in the rectum.

===Prostate imaging===

Ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the two main imaging methods used for prostate cancer detection. Urologists use transrectal ultrasound during prostate biopsy and can sometimes see a hypoechoic area (tissues or structures that reflect relatively less of the ultrasound waves directed at them). But US has poor tissue resolution and thus, is generally not clinically used.
Prostate MRI has better soft tissue resolution than ultrasound.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bonekamp D, Jacobs MA, El-Khouli R, Stoianovici D, Macura KJ | title = Advancements in MR Imaging of the Prostate: From Diagnosis to Interventions | journal = Radiographics | volume = 31 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 677–703 |date=May–June 2011 | pmid = 21571651 | pmc = 3093638 | doi = 10.1148/rg.313105139 [/tpl]
MRI in those who are at low risk might help people choose active surveillance, in those who are at intermediate risk it may help with determining the stage of disease, while in those who are at high risk it might help find bone disease.[tpl]cite journal|last=Barentsz|first=JO|coauthors=Richenberg, J; Clements, R; Choyke, P; Verma, S; Villeirs, G; Rouviere, O; Logager, V; Fütterer, JJ; European Society of Urogenital, Radiology|title=ESUR prostate MR guidelines 2012.|journal=European radiology|date=April 2012|volume=22|issue=4|pages=746–57|pmid=22322308|doi=10.1007/s00330-011-2377-y[/tpl]
Currently, MRI is used to identify targets for prostate biopsy using fusion MRI with ultrasound (US) or MRI-guidance alone. In men who are candidates for active surveillance, fusion MR/US guided prostate biopsy detected 33% of cancers compared to 7% with standard ultrasound guided biopsy.[tpl]cite journal | author = Natarajan S, Marks LS, Margolis DJ, Huang J, Macairan ML, Lieu P, Fenster A | title = Clinical application of a 3D ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy system | journal = Urol Oncol | volume = 29 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 334–42 |date=May 2011 | pmid = 21555104 | doi = 10.1016/j.urolonc.2011.02.014 | pmc = 3432280 [/tpl]
Prostate MRI is also used for surgical planning for men undergoing robotic prostatectomy. It has also shown to help surgeons decide whether to resect or spare the neurovascular bundle, determine return to urinary continence, and help assess surgical difficulty.[tpl]cite journal | author = Tan N, Margolis DJ, McClure TD, Thomas A, Finley DS, Reiter RE, Huang J, Raman SS | title = Radical prostatectomy: value of prostate MRI in surgical planning | journal = Abdominal Imaging | volume =  37| issue =  4| pages =  664–74|date=October 2011 | pmid = 21993567 | doi = 10.1007/s00261-011-9805-y [/tpl]

===Biopsy===

If cancer is suspected, a biopsy is offered expediently. During a biopsy a urologist or radiologist obtains tissue samples from the prostate via the rectum. A biopsy gun inserts and removes special hollow-core needles (usually three to six on each side of the prostate) in less than a second. Prostate biopsies are routinely done on an outpatient basis and rarely require hospitalization. Fifty-five percent of men report discomfort during prostate biopsy.[tpl]cite journal | author = Essink-Bot ML, de Koning HJ, Nijs HG, Kirkels WJ, van der Maas PJ, Schröder FH | title = Short-term effects of population-based screening for prostate cancer on health-related quality of life | journal = J.

====Gleason score====

The tissue samples are then examined under a microscope to determine whether cancer cells are present, and to evaluate the microscopic features (or Gleason score) of any cancer found. Prostate specific membrane antigen is a transmembrane carboxypeptidase and exhibits folate hydrolase activity.[tpl]cite journal | author = Figueiredo JC, Grau MV, Haile RW, Sandler RS, Summers RW, Bresalier RS, Burke CA, McKeown-Eyssen GE, Baron JA | title = Folic Acid and Risk of Prostate Cancer: Results From a Randomized Clinical Trial | journal = J.

===Tumor markers===

Tissue samples can be stained for the presence of PSA and other tumor markers in order to determine the origin of malignant cells that have metastasized.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chuang AY, DeMarzo AM, Veltri RW, Sharma RB, Bieberich CJ, Epstein JI | title = Immunohistochemical differentiation of high-grade prostate carcinoma from urothelial carcinoma | journal = Am.

Possible methods include chromatographic separation methods by mass spectrometry, or protein capturing by immunoassays or immunized antibodies.  The test method will involve quantifying the amount of the biomarker PCI, with reference to the Gleason Score. Not only is this test quick, it is also sensitive.  It can detect patients in the diagnostic grey zone, particularly those with a serum free to total Prostate Specific Antigen ratio of 10-20%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20090221672.pdf |title=Biomarker for Prostate Cancer |publisher=Freepatentsonline.com |accessdate=2011-08-29[/tpl]
The oncoprotein BCL-2, has been associated with the development of androgen-independent prostate cancer due to its high levels of expression in androgen-independent tumours in advanced stages of the pathology. The upregulation of BCL-2 after androgen ablation in prostate carcinoma cell lines and in a castrated-male rat model further established a connection between BCL-2 expression and prostate cancer progression.[tpl]cite journal | author = Catz SD, Johnson JL | title = BCL-2 in prostate cancer: a minireview | journal = Apoptosis | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–37 |date=January 2003 | pmid = 12510149 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021692801278 [/tpl]

ERK5 is a protein that may be used as a marker. ERK5 is present in abnormally high levels of prostate cancer, including invasive cancer which has spread to other parts of the body. It is also present in relapsed cancer following previous hormone therapy. Research shows that reducing the amount of ERK5 found in cancerous cells reduces their invasiveness.British Journal of Cancer - 15 Feb 2011

===Staging===

An important part of evaluating prostate cancer is determining the stage, or how far the cancer has spread. Knowing the stage helps define prognosis and is useful when selecting therapies. The most common system is the four-stage TNM system (abbreviated from Tumor/Nodes/Metastases). Its components include the size of the tumor, the number of involved lymph nodes, and the presence of any other metastases.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/besttreatments/prostate-cancer-how-far-has-your-cancer-spread-the-tnm-system |title= Prostate cancer: How far has your cancer spread? The TNM system|author=BMJ Group |date=8 December 2009 |work= |publisher=Guardian.co.uk |accessdate=9 August 2010 |location=London[/tpl]
The most important distinction made by any staging system is whether or not the cancer is still confined to the prostate. In the TNM system, clinical T1 and T2 cancers are found only in the prostate, while T3 and T4 cancers have spread elsewhere. Several tests can be used to look for evidence of spread. Medical specialty professional organizations recommend against the use of PET scans, CT scans, or bone scans when a physician stages early prostate cancer with low risk for metastasis.[tpl]Cite journal |author1 = American Society of Clinical Oncology |author1-link = American Society of Clinical Oncology |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Society of Clinical Oncology |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the ABIM Foundation |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf |accessdate = August 14, 2012 |postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl][ref]
After a prostate biopsy, a pathologist looks at the samples under a microscope. If cancer is present, the pathologist reports the grade of the tumor. The grade tells how much the tumor tissue differs from normal prostate tissue and suggests how fast the tumor is likely to grow. The Gleason system is used to grade prostate tumors from 2 to 10, where a Gleason score of 10 indicates the most abnormalities. The pathologist assigns a number from 1 to 5 for the most common pattern observed under the microscope, then does the same for the second-most-common pattern. The sum of these two numbers is the Gleason score. The Whitmore-Jewett stage is another method sometimes used.

==Prevention==

===Medications===

In those who are being regularly screened 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride and dutasteride) reduce the overall risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer however there is insufficient data to determine if they have an effect on the risk of death and may increase the chance of more serious cases.[tpl]cite journal |author = Wilt TJ, MacDonald R, Hagerty K, Schellhammer P, Kramer BS | title = Five-alpha-reductase Inhibitors for prostate cancer prevention | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 2 | pages = CD007091 | year = 2008| pmid = 18425978 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007091 | url = |editor1-last = Wilt |editor1-first = Timothy J [/tpl]

==Screening==

Prostate cancer screening is an attempt to find unsuspected cancers, and may lead to more invasive follow-up tests such as a biopsy, with cell samples taken for closer study. Options include the digital rectal exam (DRE) and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. Such screening is controversial and, in some people, may lead to unnecessary, possibly harmful, consequences.[tpl]cite news |last=Marcione |first=Marilyn|title=Prostate testing's dark side: Men who were harmed|url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20111012/D9QAUS2O0.html|publisher=Associated Press |date=12 October 2011|accessdate=2011-10-13 [/tpl] Routine screening with either a DRE or PSA is not supported by the evidence as there is no mortality benefit from screening.[tpl]cite journal | author = Djulbegovic M, Beyth RJ, Neuberger MM, Stoffs TL, Vieweg J, Djulbegovic B, Dahm P | title = Screening for prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials | journal = BMJ | volume = 341 | issue =  |pages = c4543 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20843937 | pmc = 2939952 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c4543 [/tpl]

==Management==

The first decision to be made in managing prostate cancer is whether treatment is needed. Prostate cancer, especially low-grade forms found in the elderly, often grows so slowly that no treatment is required.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/health/cancer-by-any-other-name-would-not-be-as-terrifying.html| title = ‘Cancer’ or ‘Weird Cells’: Which Sounds Deadlier?| author = Kolata, Gina| date = 21 November 2011| newspaper = The New York Times [/tpl] Treatment may also be inappropriate if a person has other serious health problems or is not expected to live long enough for symptoms to appear.
Which option is best depends on the stage of the disease, the Gleason score, and the PSA level. Other important factors are age, general health, and a person's views about potential treatments and their possible side effects. Because all treatments can have significant side effects, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, treatment discussions often focus on balancing the goals of therapy with the risks of lifestyle alterations. A combination of the treatment options is often recommended for managing prostate cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lu-Yao GL, Albertsen PC, Moore DF, Shih W, Lin Y, DiPaola RS, Barry MJ, Zietman A, O'Leary M, Walker-Corkery E, Yao SL | title = Outcomes of Localized Prostate Cancer Following Conservative Management | journal = The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 302 | issue = 11 | pages = 1202–09 |date=September 2009 | pmid = 19755699 | pmc = 2822438 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2009.1348 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Mongiat-Artus P, Peyromaure M, Richaud P, Droz JP, Rainfray M, Jeandel C, Rebillard X, Moreau JL, Davin JL, Salomon L, Soulié M | title = for the treatment of prostate cancer in the elderly man: A study by the oncology committee of the French association of urology | language = French | journal = Prog.

===Surveillance===

Many men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer are eligible for active surveillance. This term implies careful observation of the tumor over time, with the intention of treatment for cure if there are signs of cancer progression. Active surveillance is not synonymous with watchful waiting, an older term which implies no treatment or specific program of monitoring, with the assumption that palliative, not curative, treatment would be used if advanced, symptomatic disease develops.
Active surveillance involves monitoring the tumor for signs of growth or the appearance of symptoms.  The monitoring process may involve serial PSA, physical examination of the prostate, and/or repeated biopsies.  The goal of surveillance is to avoid overtreatment and the sometimes serious, permanent side effects of treatment for a slow-growing or self-limited tumor that would never cause any problems for the person.  This approach is not used for aggressive cancers, but it may cause anxiety for people who wrongly believe that all cancer is deadly or themselves to have a life-threatening cancer. For  50% to 75% of people with prostate cancer it will cause no harm before a person dies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/041911/page2 |title=Active Surveillance May Be Preferred Option in Some Men with Prostate Cancer |publisher=Cancer.gov |date=2011-04-19 |accessdate=2011-08-29[/tpl]

===Aggressive cancer===

Treatment of aggressive prostate cancers may involve surgery (i.e. radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy including brachytherapy (prostate brachytherapy) and external beam radiation therapy, High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), chemotherapy, oral chemotherapeutic drugs (Temozolomide/TMZ), cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, or some combination.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hong H, Zhang Y, Sun J, Cai W | title = Positron emission tomography imaging of prostate cancer | journal = Amino Acids | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–27 |date=November 2009 | pmid = 19946787 | pmc = 2883014 | doi = 10.1007/s00726-009-0394-9 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Peyromaure M, Valéri A, Rebillard X, Beuzeboc P, Richaud P, Soulié M, Salomon L | title = of prostate cancer in men less than 50-year-old | language = French | journal = Prog.

Although the widespread use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening in the USA has resulted in diagnosis at earlier age and cancer stage, the vast majority of cases are still diagnosed in men older than 65 years, and approximately 25% of cases are diagnosed in men older than 75 years.[tpl]cite journal | author = Fitzpatrick JM | title = Management of localized prostate cancer in senior adults: the crucial role of comorbidity | journal = BJU international | volume = 101 Suppl 2 | issue =  | pages = 16–22 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18307688 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.07487.x [/tpl] Though US National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend using life expectancy greater than or less than 10 years to help make treatment decisions, in practice, many elderly patients are not offered curative treatment options such as radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and are instead treated with hormonal therapy or watchful waiting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nccn.org/index.asp |title=Evidence-Based Cancer Guidelines, Oncology Drug Compendium, Oncology Continuing Medical Education |publisher=NCCN |accessdate=2011-08-29[/tpl] This pattern can be attributed to factors such as medical co-morbidity and patient preferences is regard to quality of life in addition to prostate cancer specific risk factors such as pretreatment PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage. As the average life expectancy increases due to advances in treatment of cardiovascular, pulmonary and other chronic disease, it is likely that more elderly patients will be living long enough to suffer the consequences of their prostate cancer. Therefore, there is currently much interest in the role of aggressive prostate cancer treatment modalities such as with surgery or radiation in the elderly population who have localized disease.
If the cancer has spread beyond the prostate, treatment options significantly change, so most doctors that treat prostate cancer use a variety of nomograms to predict the probability of spread. Treatment by watchful waiting/active surveillance, external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, cryosurgery, HIFU, and surgery are, in general, offered to men whose cancer remains within the prostate. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are often reserved for disease that has spread beyond the prostate. However, there are exceptions: radiation therapy may be used for some advanced tumors, and hormonal therapy is used for some early stage tumors. Cryotherapy (the process of freezing the tumor), hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy may also be offered if initial treatment fails and the cancer progresses.
Sipuleucel-T has been found result in a benefit ( a four month increase in survival ) for men with metastatic prostate cancer.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hammerstrom|first=AE|coauthors=Cauley, DH; Atkinson, BJ; Sharma, P|title=Cancer immunotherapy: sipuleucel-T and beyond|journal=Pharmacotherapy|date=August 2011|volume=31|issue=8|pages=813–28|pmid=21923608|doi=10.1592/phco.31.8.813[/tpl]

===[tpl]anchor|Castration-resistant prostate cancer[/tpl] Castration-resistant===

Most hormone dependent cancers become refractory after one to three years and resume growth despite hormone therapy.  Previously considered "hormone-refractory prostate cancer" or "androgen-independent prostate cancer", the term castration-resistant has replaced "hormone refractory" because while they are no longer responsive to castration treatment (reduction of available androgen/testosterone/DHT by chemical or surgical means), these cancers still show reliance upon hormones for androgen receptor activation.[tpl]cite journal | author = Seruga B, Ocana A, Tannock IF | title = Drug resistance in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer | journal = Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–23 |date=January 2011 | pmid = 20859283 | doi = 10.1038/nrclinonc.2010.136 [/tpl] Before 2004, all treatments for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) were considered[tpl]who|date=July 2011[/tpl] palliative and not shown to prolong survival.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] However, there are now several treatments available to treat CRPC that improve survival.

==Prognosis==

Prostate cancer rates are higher and prognoses are poorer in developed countries than in the rest of the world. Many of the risk factors for prostate cancer are more prevalent in the developed world, including longer life expectancy and diets high in red meat. (People who consume larger amounts of meat and dairy also tend to consume fewer portions of fruits and vegetables. It is not currently clear whether both of these factors, or just one of them, contribute to the occurrence of prostate cancer.ACS :: What Are The Risk Factors for Prostate Cancer?[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]) Also, where there is more access to screening programs, there is a higher detection rate. Prostate cancer is the ninth-most-common cancer in the world, but is the number-one non-skin cancer in men from the United States. Prostate cancer affected 18 percent of American men and caused death in three percent in 2005. In Japan, death from prostate cancer was one-fifth to one-half the rates in the United States and Europe in the 1990s.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wakai K | title = epidemiology of prostate cancer in Japan and Western countries | language = Japanese | journal = Nippon Rinsho | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pages = 207–12 |date=February 2005 | pmid = 15714967 | doi =  [/tpl] In India in the 1990s, half of the people with prostate cancer confined to the prostate died within ten years.[tpl]cite journal | author = Jaubert de Beaujeu M, Chavrier Y | title = of the anterior thoracic wall (author's transl) | language = French | journal = Ann Chir Thorac Cardiovasc | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 |date=January 1976 | pmid = 1259345 | doi =  [/tpl] African-American men have 50–60 times more prostate cancer and prostate cancer deaths than men in Shanghai, China.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hsing AW, Tsao L, Devesa SS | title = International trends and patterns of prostate cancer incidence and mortality | journal = Int.

In patients who undergo treatment, the most important clinical prognostic indicators of disease outcome are stage, pre-therapy PSA level, and Gleason score. In general, the higher the grade and the stage, the poorer the prognosis. Nomograms can be used to calculate the estimated risk of the individual patient. The predictions are based on the experience of large groups of patients suffering from cancers at various stages.[tpl]cite journal | author = Di Blasio CJ, Rhee AC, Cho D, Scardino PT, Kattan MW | title = Predicting clinical end points: treatment nomograms in prostate cancer | journal = Semin.

In 1941, Charles Huggins reported that androgen ablation therapy causes regression of primary and metastatic androgen-dependent prostate cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Huggins C, Steven RE, Hodges CV | title = Studies on prostatic cancer | journal = Arch. Surg. | volume = 43 | issue =  2| pages = 209–223 | year = 1941 | pmid =  | doi =10.1001/archsurg.1941.01210140043004  [/tpl] He was awarded the 1966 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for this discovery.  Androgen ablation therapy causes remission in 80-90% of patients undergoing therapy, resulting in a median progression-free survival of 12 to 33 months. After remission, an androgen-independent phenotype typically emerges, wherein the median overall survival is 23–37 months from the time of initiation of androgen ablation therapy.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hellerstedt BA, Pienta KJ | title = The current state of hormonal therapy for prostate cancer | journal = CA Cancer J Clin | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 154–79 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12018929 | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.52.3.154 [/tpl] It is not clear how the prostate cancer becomes androgen-independent or how it reestablishes progression, although a few possibilities (on how) have been proposed.[tpl]cite journal | author = Feldman BJ, Feldman D | title = The development of androgen-independent prostate cancer | journal = Nature Reviews Cancer | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–45 |date=October 2001 | pmid = 11900250 | doi = 10.1038/35094009 [/tpl] And the way the cancer changes, to overcome the lack of androgen, may vary between individual patients.

===Classification systems===

Many prostate cancers are not destined to be lethal, and most men will ultimately die from causes other than of the disease. Decisions about treatment type and timing may, therefore, be informed by an estimation of the risk that the tumor will ultimately recur after treatment and/or progress to metastases and mortality. Several tools are available to help predict outcomes, such as pathologic stage and recurrence after surgery or radiation therapy. Most combine stage, grade, and PSA level, and some also add the number or percent of biopsy cores positive, age, and/or other information.
