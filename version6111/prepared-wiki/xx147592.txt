Mario Gutiérrez Cotelo (born 10 February 1975) is a Spanish retired professional footballer who played as a right midfielder. 

==Football career==

Born in Langreo, Asturias, Cotelo began his career at local giants Sporting de Gijón, and played for its B-team during his first two seasons as a senior. During 1993–94 he appeared once for the main squad and, after a loan to Segunda División side CD Badajoz, would become an important player with the latter.
After four full seasons with Gijón, Mario returned to La Liga with Sevilla FC, but would only appear five times for the Andalusians during one 1/2 seasons, moving to UD Las Palmas in January 2003. In 2003–04 he was a key element in Getafe CF's first ever promotion to the top flight, and went on to appear in 93 league games in his first three seasons. 
Used sparingly throughout 2007–08, Mario also played in six incomplete UEFA Cup contests in the Madrid's side quarterfinal run. In the following campaign he featured even less (two matches, four minutes total), and was released at its closure.
Not being able to find a new club, Mario retired from the game in early 2010, at the age of 35. He played a total of 349 matches in the country's two major divisions.
