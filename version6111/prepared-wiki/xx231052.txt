[[Pennsylvania Typhoon]]

CATEGORIES: Professional Inline Hockey Association teams

The Pennsylvania Typhoon are a professional inline hockey team based in Lemoyne, Pennsylvania. They are members of the Mason Dixon Division of the Eastern Conference of the Professional Inline Hockey Association (PIHA). The Typhoon play their home games in Lemoyne at the Susquehanna Sports Center, which is also home of their I-83 rival, and the other "Original Two", the Harrisburg Lunatics. Previously, they played at The Blast, in York, Pennsylvania as the York Typhoon but changed their name during their move to Lemoyne.
Founded in 2002, as the York Typhoon, they were one of the founding franchises of the PIHA. The Typhoon and rival Lunatics are the only "Original Two" teams still remaining in PIHA. The team's championship season in 2004 still marks the last time that a Typhoon team won the Founders Cup. The Typhoon have won three Founders Cups (including their first in 2002 in the inaugural season of PIHA), more than any other team. On a percentage basis, as of 2008, the franchise has won 43% of all Founders Cup championships contested in the history of PIHA, making it the most successful franchise in league history.
