</ref> the ITU does not actually clearly specify minimum required rates, nor required average rates, nor what modes[tpl]clarify|date=September 2013[/tpl] of the interfaces qualify as 3G, so various[tpl]vague|date=September 2013[/tpl] data rates are sold as '3G' in the market.  Compare with [[3.5G]] and [[4G]].

===Security===

3G networks offer greater security than their 2G predecessors. By allowing the UE (User Equipment) to authenticate the network it is attaching to, the user can be sure the network is the intended one and not an impersonator. 3G networks use the KASUMI block cipher instead of the older A5/1 stream cipher. However, a number of serious weaknesses in the KASUMI cipher have been identified.[ref]

In addition to the 3G network infrastructure security, end-to-end security is offered when application frameworks such as IMS are accessed, although this is not strictly a 3G property.

===Applications of 3G===

The bandwidth and location information available to 3G devices gives rise to applications not previously available to mobile phone users. Some of the applications are:

==Evolution==

Both 3GPP and 3GPP2 are working on extensions to 3G standard that are based on an all-IP network infrastructure and using advanced wireless technologies such as MIMO. These specifications already display features characteristic for IMT-Advanced (4G), the successor of 3G. However, falling short of the bandwidth requirements for 4G (which is 1 Gbit/s for stationary and 100 Mbit/s for mobile operation), these standards are classified as 3.9G or Pre-4G.
3GPP plans to meet the 4G goals with LTE Advanced, whereas Qualcomm has halted development of UMB in favour of the LTE family.
On 14 December 2009, Telia Sonera announced in an official press release that "We are very proud to be the first operator in the world to offer our customers 4G services."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.teliasonera.com/News-and-Archive/Press-releases/2009/TeliaSonera-first-in-the-world-with-4G-services/ |title=first in the world with 4G services |publisher=TeliaSonera |date=14 December 2009 |accessdate=2010-09-06[/tpl] With the launch of their LTE network, initially they are offering pre-4G (or beyond 3G) services in Stockholm, Sweden and Oslo, Norway.
