[[Gyroelongated square bipyramid]]

CATEGORIES: Johnson solids, Deltahedra, Pyramids and bipyramids

In geometry, the gyroelongated square bipyramid is one of the Johnson solids (J17). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating an octahedron (square bipyramid) by inserting a square antiprism between its congruent halves. It is a deltahedron.

==Dual polyhedron==

The dual of the gyroelongated square bipyramid is a square truncated trapezohedron with 10 faces: 8 pentagons and 2 square.
