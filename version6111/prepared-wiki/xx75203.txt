Beginning in 2014, the NBCC has announced they will be presenting a special "first book" award across all 6 categories, named the John Leonard Award in honor of literary critic and NBCC founding member John Leonard, who died in 2008."NBCC to Add John Leonard Award to Honor First Books; Named After Founding Member".
