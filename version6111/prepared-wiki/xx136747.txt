Pikine is a city in the Pikine Department of the Dakar Region of Senegal.  Lying to the east of Dakar city centre, in 2005 it had a population of 834,246.  The department includes the villages of Yeumbeul, Thiaroye, Mbao, and Keur Massar Malika.  Until the mid-2000s, it also included Gu√©diawaye.
The city was founded in 1952 by the colonial government for former residents of Dakar who were relocated for new developments.  This original city is now known as "Old Pikine", while an informal community has grown up around it.
The Grande Niaye de Pikine, a green area known for market gardening, lies to the north west of Pikine.
