==History==

The first Hondurans came to United States in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, in the 1820s,  while the country, part of Central America, gained its independence from Spain and was founded as the republic of Honduras. All periods of conflict have led to minor waves of Honduran emigration to the United States. This was the case after the 1956 military coup.Honduran Americans by William Maxwell, Retrieved December 11, 2011, to 12:55pm.
Hondurans immigrated to the United States in the 1960s, primarily to Miami, New York City, and Los Angeles. The main reason for Hondurans to leave their country was to escape poverty and seek a better life in the United States.
Many Honduran-Americans are migrant farm laborers who first established themselves in the largest U.S. cities, in which they had support networks from the Honduran-American communities. In the late1980s and 1990s, most Honduran-Americans lived in New York City (33,000), Los Angeles (24,000), and Miami (18,000).
