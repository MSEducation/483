==History==

The Romans built a military camp, which they called Lousanna, at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where currently Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called 'Lausodunon' or 'Lousodunon' (The 'y' suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.).[tpl]HDS|12290|Lousonna[/tpl]  By the 2nd century AD it was known as vikanorum Lousonnensium and in 280 as lacu Lausonio.  By 400 it was civitas Lausanna and in 990 it was mentioned as Losanna.

After the fall of the Roman Empire, insecurity forced the transfer of Lausanne to its current centre, a hilly, easier to defend site. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Dukes of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne. Then it came under Bern from 1536 to 1798 and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the Cathedral, were permanently removed. Lausanne has made a number of requests to recover them.
After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729 a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750 ninety pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to four hundred. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812.[tpl]cite book |title= Le séminaire de Lausanne, 1726-1812 : instrument de la restauration du protestantisme français : étude historique fondée principalement sur les documents inédits|last= Lasserre |first= Claude|year= 1997|series= Bibliothèque historique vaudoise, no 112|publisher= Bibliothèque historique vaudoise|location= Lausanne|isbn= 978-2-88454-112-1|oclc= 39222660|language= French[/tpl] Also [tpl]OCLC|39228676[/tpl] During the Napoleonic Wars, the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton, Vaud under which it joined the Swiss Federation.[tpl]HDS|7576|Lausanne District 1313-2006[/tpl]

===Modern history===

In 1964 the city hosted the 'Swiss National Exhibition',[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.expo-archive.ch/eng/index.html?siteSect=1000|title= Lausanne 1964: Two ideas, one Expo|work= Swiss National Exhibitions - Expo-Archive|publisher= swissinfo/Swiss Radio International (SRI)|accessdate= 2009-09-27[/tpl] displaying its newly found confidence to host major international events.
From the 1950s to 1970s a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated, settling mostly in the industrial district of Renens and transforming the local diet.
The city has been traditionally quiet but in the late 1960s and early 1970s there were a series of mainly youth demonstrations confronted by the police. The next vigorous demonstrations took place to protest against the high cinema prices and since then the city returned to its old very sleepy self, until the protest against the G8 meetings in 2003.

==Geography==

The most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (Lac Léman in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the Swiss plateau, with a difference in elevation of about [tpl]convert|500|m|ft|0[/tpl] between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering Le Mont-sur-Lausanne and Épalinges. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Alps.
In addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present Rue Centrale, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, visitors should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street which they are trying to negotiate. The name Flon is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.
The municipality includes the villages of Vidy, Cour, Ouchy, Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-à-Gobet ([tpl]convert|871|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]) as well as the exclave of Vernand.
Lausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of Lavaux (to the east) and la Côte (to the west).
Lausanne has an area, [tpl]as of|2009|lc=on[/tpl], of [tpl]convert|41.38|-|41.33|km2|sqmi|sp=us[/tpl] (depending on calculation method).  Of this area, [tpl]convert|6.64|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] or 16.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while [tpl]convert|16.18|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] or 39.1% is forested.  Of the rest of the land, [tpl]convert|18.45|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] or 44.6% is settled (buildings or roads), [tpl]convert|0.05|km2|acre|abbr=on[/tpl] or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and [tpl]convert|0.01|km2|acre|abbr=on[/tpl] or 0.0% is unproductive land.Swiss Federal Statistical Office-Land Use Statistics 2009 data [tpl]de icon[/tpl] accessed 25 March 2010.
Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 21.6% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.5%.  Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.4% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.5%.  Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests.  Of the agricultural land, 11.1% is used for growing crops and 4.2% is pastures.  All the water in the municipality is in lakes.
The municipality was part of the old Lausanne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the capital of the new district of Lausanne.Nomenklaturen – Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz [tpl]de icon[/tpl] accessed 4 April 2011.
