</ref> ZZ Top's grueling [[Afterburner World Tour]] lasted well into 1987, which also saw the release of ''The ZZ Top Sixpack'', a three-disc collection of ZZ Top's albums from 1970 to 1981, with the exception of Degüello. The albums ''ZZ Top's First Album'', ''Rio Grande Mud'', ''Tres Hombres'', ''Fandango'' and ''Tejas'' were remixed with the result that the sound of the material from the first five albums was changed to sound like they had been recorded in the 1980s, with echo and drum machines, and very unlike their original album sound.<ref name="sixpack">[tpl]Cite book |author=Bob Merlis and Jim Bessman|title=ZZ on CD: Meeting The Digital Challenge Head On |location=ZZ Top Six Pack CD Booklet | publisher=Warner Bros Records|year=1987|page=2[/tpl]</ref> Many of the original mixes were used on the 2003-CD box set ''[[Chrome, Smoke & BBQ]]'', and its companion piece ''[[Rancho Texicano]]''. Also, remastered versions of ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' and ''[[Fandango!]]'' were eventually released on CD in 2006 with the original mixes intact. In 2013, [[Warner Brothers]] released [[The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990]], a 10-CD box set which contained the original mixes of ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'', ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'', and ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'' for the first time on CD.
Recycler, released in 1990, was ZZ Top's last studio album under contract with Warner Records. Recycler was also the last of a distinct sonic trilogy in the ZZ Top catalogue. The collection actually marked a return towards the earlier, simpler guitar-driven blues sound with less synthesizer and pop bounce of the previous two albums. This move did not entirely suit the fan base that Eliminator and Afterburner had built up, and while Recycler did achieve platinum status, it never matched the sales of Eliminator and Afterburner. The cartoonish and sexy-ZZ-girl videos continued in singles like "My Head's in Mississippi", "Give It Up", and "Burger Man".

In 1992, Warner released ZZ Top's Greatest Hits, along with a new Rolling Stones-style cut, "Gun Love", and an Elvis-inflected video, "Viva Las Vegas". In 1993, ZZ Top inducted a major influence, Cream, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
In 1994 the band signed to a $35 million deal with RCA Records,[ref]
