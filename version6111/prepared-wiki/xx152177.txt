[[1889 English cricket season]]

CATEGORIES: English cricket seasons from 1864 to 1889, 1889 in English sport, 1889 in cricket

The 1889 English cricket season saw the number of balls per over increased from four to five. The four-ball over had been used since time immemorial.
Earlier in the year, on 12 and 13 March, South Africa versus England at Port Elizabeth was the start of cricket in South Africa at both Test and first-class level.  Domestic first-class matches began at the end of the same year.  The England team, captained by future Hollywood actor C Aubrey Smith, played two Tests on the inaugural tour, at Port Elizabeth and Cape Town, winning both by comfortable margins.  Lancashire spinner Johnny Briggs had match figures of 15-28 at Cape Town.
