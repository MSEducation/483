Fland Dá Chongal or Flann Ua Congaile (flourished late 7th century) was a king of the Uí Failge, a Laigin people of County Offaly.
Fland is not mentioned in the annals of Ireland but appears in king lists and genealogies. The king lists in the Book of Leinster place his reign before Cillíne mac Forannáin (died 652), however the death obits of his sons would place his reign later. He was most likely a contemporary of Cellach Cualann (died 715), king of Leinster and the predecessor of Forbassach Ua Congaile (died 714).Mac Niocaill, pg.113 Forbasach ruled for three years according to the Book of Leinster and Fland for fourteen years which gives a possible reign of 697-711 for Fland.
Fland was the great great grandson of a brother of Áed Róin mac Cathail (died 604), a previous king.Mac Niocaill, pg.92 Fland had twelve children by at least three different wives:Rawlinson Genealogies, pg.58-59
Four of Fland's sons were slain at the Battle of Áth Senaig in 738 when the men of Leinster were crushed by the high king Áed Allán.Mac Niocaill. pg.125; Byrne, pg.147; Ó Cróinín, pg.200 fland's descendants were known as the Uí Flaind.
