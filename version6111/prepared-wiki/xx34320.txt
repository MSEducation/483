In Hinduism and Buddhism, the Sanskrit lexical item svāhā (Romanized Sanskrit transcription; Devanagari: स्वाहा, chi. 薩婆訶  sà pó hē, jp. sowaka, tib. སྭཱཧཱ་ soha) is an interjection, approximately "hail!" in mantras indicating the end of the mantra.  In the Tibetan language, "svaha" is translated as "so be it" and is often pronounced and orthographically represented as "soha". Whenever fire sacrifices are made, svāhā is chanted. Etymologically, the  term is probably from su "well" and the root ah "to call".[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
