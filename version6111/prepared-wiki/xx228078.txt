Yasca is an open source program which looks for security vulnerabilities, code-quality, performance, and conformance to best practices in program source code. It leverages external open source programs, such as FindBugs, PMD, JLint, JavaScript Lint, PHPLint, Cppcheck, ClamAV, Pixy, and RATS to scan specific file types,[tpl]cite book|last=Clarke|first=Justin|title=SQL Injection Attacks and Defense|year=2009|publisher=Syngress|isbn=978-1-59749-424-3|page=474|page=125[/tpl] and also contains many custom scanners developed for Yasca. It is a command-line tool that generates reports in HTML, CSV, XML, MySQL, SQLite, and other formats. It is listed as a tool at the well-known OWASP security project,[tpl]cite web|title=Category:OWASP Yasca Project|url=http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Yasca_Project|work=OWASP|accessdate=14 September 2010[/tpl] and also in a government software security tools review at the U.S Department of Homeland Security web site.[tpl]cite web|title=Software Security Assessment Tools Review|url=https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/swa/downloads/NAVSEA-Tools-Paper-2009-03-02.pdf|work=Homeland Security|accessdate=14 September 2010[/tpl]

==Languages Scanned==

Yasca has at least one scanner for each of the following file types:

==Yasca 2.2==

Version 2.2 was released in June 2010 and included a large number of minor updates over version 2.1, most notably, natively compiled plugins on Linux, reducing the need to use Wine. Version 2.2 contains some experimental modules, including a TCP packet logger and a rule to scan those logs for sensitive information. Additional rules for this are expected in the next update.
As with prior 2.x releases, Yasca comes packaged as a core bundle, plus separately downloadable plugins. No plugins are required, but best results occur when using all of the necessary plugins.
