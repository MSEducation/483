SS ''Dominator'', a Greek freighter, ran ashore on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in the South Bay area of California in 1961 due to a navigational error while lost in fog. Its remains can still be seen today, and serves as a point of interest for hikers and kayakers.

==Ship history==

The ship was originally the American Liberty ship Melville Jacoby, built during World War II at the Walsh-Kaiser Company shipyard in Providence, Rhode Island, and launched on 31 March 1944.[tpl]cite web |url= http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/kwalsh.htm |title=Walsh-Kaiser Shipbuilding  |work=shipbuildinghistory.com |year=2011 |accessdate=10 May 2012[/tpl] It was named after the journalist Melville Jacoby, who after reporting on the war in China, and narrowly escaping capture at Corregidor, was killed in an air crash in 1942.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2000/marapr/shelf_life/review.html |title=Getting to the Front |first=Harry  |last=Press |work=Stanford Magazine: Book Review |date=Marchâ€“April 2000 |accessdate=10 May 2012[/tpl]
During the war the ship was operated by the Wilmore Steamship Company of Boston, on behalf of the War Shipping Administration. In 1947 she was sold into commercial service, and flying the Panamanian flag, was renamed SS Victoria. She changed hands in 1950, and was renamed SS North Queen, then again in 1953 and became SS Dominator.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mariners-l.co.uk/LibShipsM.html |title=Liberty Ships (M) |work=mariners-l.co.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=10 May 2012[/tpl]

==The wreck==

On March 13, 1961, Dominator was en route to Los Angeles from Vancouver with a cargo of wheat and beef, when she ran aground off Palos Verdes, California.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cawreckdivers.org/Wrecks/Dominator.htm |title=Dominator |work=cawreckdivers.org |year=2007  |accessdate=10 May 2012[/tpl] For two days, the Coast Guard and tugboats attempted to refloat her, but heavy seas and high winds only forced her higher onto the rocks. After two days the crew abandoned ship. The stranded ship was then auctioned, and hull and cargo were sold separately, which led to some conflict between the salvors, as they attempted to gain what they could. Eventually, the ship slowly broke up under the pounding of the waves, and large pieces of wreckage are still scattered over the shore.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lakata.org/arch/dominator/ |title=Dominator Shipwreck |work=lakata.org |year=2005 |accessdate=10 May 2012[/tpl]

==Accessing the wreck==

The nearest access point is the park along the cove to the south. A different trailhead down to the beach leading to the site begins about 2 miles north along the coast on Paseo Del Mar between Via Horcada and Via Almar in Palos Verdes Estates, California.
