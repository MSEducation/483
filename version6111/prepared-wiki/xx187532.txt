Star Trek is an American science fiction entertainment franchise created by Gene Roddenberry and currently under the ownership of CBS and Paramount.For a more detailed history of the ownership of the franchise, see the corporate ownership section. Star Trek: The Original Series and its live action TV spin-off shows, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise as well as the Star Trek film series make up the main canon, while Star Trek: The Animated Series as well as the expansive library of Star Trek novels and comics are part of the franchise, but are generally considered non-canon.There has been debate as to whether The Animated Series should be part of the Star Trek canon.  See The Animated Series section for more details.
The first series, now referred to as "The Original Series", debuted in 1966 and ran for three seasons on NBC. It followed the interstellar adventures of James T. Kirk and the crew of the starship Enterprise, an exploration vessel of a 23rd-century interstellar "United Federation of Planets". In creating the first "Star Trek", Roddenberry was inspired by Westerns such as Wagon Train, along with the Horatio Hornblower novels and Gulliver's Travels. These adventures continued in the short-lived Star Trek: The Animated Series and six feature films. Four spin-off television series were eventually produced: Star Trek: The Next Generation, followed the crew of a new starship Enterprise set a century after the original series; Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager, set contemporaneously with The Next Generation; and Star Trek: Enterprise, set before the original series, in the early days of human interstellar travel. Four additional The Next Generation feature films were produced. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a relaunch with a prequel to the original series set in an alternate timeline titled simply Star Trek. This film featured a new cast portraying younger versions of the crew from the original Enterprise. A sequel to this film, Star Trek Into Darkness, premiered on May 16, 2013.
Star Trek has been a cult phenomenon for decades.[tpl]cite news | last =Italie| first =Hillel| title =Potter Reaches Cult Phenomenon Status| work =Seattle Times| agency =Associated Press| date =July 2, 2007| url =http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html| accessdate =October 19, 2011 [/tpl] In this article, the status of Star Trek as a cult phenomenon is repeatedly taken as read. Fans of the franchise are called Trekkies or Trekkers. The franchise spans a wide range of spin-offs including games, figurines, novels, toys, and comics. Star Trek had a themed attraction in Las Vegas which opened in 1998 and closed in September 2008. At least two museum exhibits of props travel the world. The series has its own full-fledged constructed language, Klingon. Several parodies have been made of Star Trek. Its fans, despite the end of Star Trek episodes on TV, have produced several fan productions to fill that void.
Star Trek is noted for its influence on the world outside of science fiction. It has been cited as an inspiration for several technological inventions such as the cell phone. Moreover, the show is noted for its progressive civil rights stances. The original series included one of television's first multiracial casts, and the first televised inter-racial kiss. Star Trek references can be found throughout popular culture from movies such as the submarine thriller Crimson Tide to the cartoon series South Park.

==Conception and setting==

As early as 1964, Gene Roddenberry drafted a proposal for the science fiction series that would become Star Trek. Although he publicly marketed it as a Western in outer space—a so-called "Wagon Train to the Stars" (like the popular Western TV series)[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=roddenberry | title=Gene Roddenberry | publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications | accessdate=October 19, 2011 | quote=Roddenberry described Star Trek as a 'Wagon Train to the stars' because, like that popular series, its stories focused on the 'individuals who traveled to promote the expansion of our horizons.'[/tpl]—he privately told friends that he was modeling it on Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, intending each episode to act on two levels: as a suspenseful adventure story and as a morality tale.See David Alexander, "Star Trek Creator. The Authorized Biography of Gene Roddenberry" and interview with Roddenberry in "Something about the Author" by Gale Research Company and chapter 11 of "Trash Culture: Popular Culture and the Great Tradition" by Richard Keller Simon
Most Star Trek stories depict the adventures of humans and aliens who serve in Starfleet, the space-borne humanitarian and peacekeeping armada of the United Federation of Planets. The protagonists have altruistic values, and must apply these ideals to difficult dilemmas. Many of the conflicts and political dimensions of Star Trek represent allegories of contemporary cultural realities. Star Trek: The Original Series addressed issues of the 1960s,[tpl]cite web| last =Snyder| first =J. William, Jr.| title =Star Trek: A Phenomenon and Social Statement on the 1960s| publisher =self-published| year =1995| url =http://www.ibiblio.org/jwsnyder/wisdom/trek.html| accessdate =October 19, 2011[/tpl] just as later spin-offs have reflected issues of their respective decades. Issues depicted in the various series include war and peace, the value of personal loyalty, authoritarianism, imperialism, class warfare, economics, racism, religion, human rights, sexism, feminism, and the role of technology.Johnson-Smith, p 57 Roddenberry stated: "creating a new world with new rules, I could make statements about sex, religion, Vietnam, politics, and intercontinental missiles. Indeed, we did make them on Star Trek: we were sending messages and fortunately they all got by the network."Johnson-Smith, pp 79–85
Roddenberry intended the show to have a highly progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this. He wanted Star Trek to show humanity what it might develop into, if only it would learn from the lessons of the past, most specifically by ending violence. An extreme example is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a very violent past but learned to control their emotions. Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations.[tpl]cite web|author=Woody Goulart |url=http://woodygoulart.com/wg/trekology/star-trek/gene-roddenberry/ |title=Gene Roddenberry — Woody Goulart |publisher=Woodygoulart.com |accessdate=October 19, 2011[/tpl] His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that the Enterprise have a racially diverse crew.[tpl]Cite book |last=Whitfield|first=Stephen PE |coauthors=Roddenberry, Gene |year=1968 |title=The Making of Star Trek|location=New York |publisher=Ballantine Books |oclc=23859 |isbn=0-345-31554-5[/tpl]

==History and production==

===Beginnings===

In 1964, Roddenberry proposed the original Star Trek TV series to Desilu Studios as "like Wagon Train, a Wagon Train to the stars."[tpl]cite journal | last = Roddenberry | first = Gene | title = Star Trek is | version = First Draft | date = March 11, 1964 | url = http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/misc/40_years/trek_pitch.pdf |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060924140423/http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/misc/40_years/trek_pitch.pdf |archivedate= September 24, 2006 | format = PDF | accessdate =June 26, 2009[/tpl] The network rejected the show's first pilot, "The Cage", starring Jeffrey Hunter as Enterprise Captain Christopher Pike; however, NBC executives, still impressed with the concept, made the unusual decision to commission a second pilot: "Where No Man Has Gone Before". The first regular episode ("The Man Trap") of Star Trek aired on Thursday, September 8, 1966."The numbers game, part one." Broadcasting. September 19, 1966: 58–60. While the show initially enjoyed high ratings, the average rating of the show at the end of its first season dropped to 52nd (out of 94 programs).
Unhappy with the show's ratings, NBC threatened to cancel the show during its second season.Herbert Solow and Robert H. Justman, Inside Star Trek: The Real Story, Pocket Books, 1996, pp.377–394 The show's fan base, led by Bjo Trimble, conducted an unprecedented letter-writing campaign, petitioning the network to keep the show on the air.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.startrek.com/article/bjo-trimble-the-woman-who-saved-star-trek-part-1 | title = Bjo Trimble: The Woman Who Saves Star Trek — Part 1 | last = StarTrek.com Staff | date = August 31, 2011 | work = StarTrek.com | publisher = CBS Entertainment | quote = For the record, when NBC seemed to be on the verge of axing Star Trek after a low-rated second season, the Trimbles devised a grassroots letter-writing campaign that saved the show and resulted in a third season.[/tpl]Solow & Justman, pp.377–386 NBC renewed the show, but moved it from primetime to the "Friday night death slot", and substantially reduced its budget.Shatner, Star Trek Memories, pp.290–291 In protest Roddenberry resigned as producer and reduced his direct involvement in Star Trek which led to Fred Freiberger becoming producer for the show's third and final season.Roddenberry did, however, co-author two scripts for the third season. Despite the protests of a renewed letter-writing campaign, NBC cancelled the series.

===Rebirth===

After the original series was cancelled, Paramount Studios, who had bought the series from Desilu, licensed the broadcast syndication rights to help recoup the production losses. Reruns began in the fall of 1969 and by the late 1970s the series aired in over 150 domestic and 60 international markets. This helped Star Trek develop a cult following greater than its popularity during its original run.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rx0eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gX4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6303,2206524&dq=cult-fans-reruns-give-star-trek-an-out-of-this-world-popularity&hl=en | title=Cult Fans, Reruns Give 'Star Trek' an Out of This World Popularity | accessdate=October 19, 2011 | date=July 3, 1972 | publisher=Milwaukee Journal[/tpl]
One sign of the series' growing popularity was the first Star Trek convention which occurred on January 21–23, 1972 in New York City. Although the original estimate of attendees was only a few hundred, several thousand fans turned up. Star Trek fans continue to attend similar conventions worldwide.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.startrek.com/article/celebrating-40-years-since-treks-1st-convention | title=Celebrating 40 Years since Trek's 1st Convention | publisher=startrek.com | date=20 January 2012 | accessdate=1 August 2013[/tpl]
The series' newfound success led to the idea of reviving the franchise.Sackett & Roddenberry, 15. Filmation with Paramount Television produced the first post original series show, Star Trek: The Animated Series. It ran on NBC for 22 half-hour episodes over two seasons on Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1974. Although short lived, typical for animated productions in that time slot during that period, the series garnered the franchise's only "Best Series" Emmy Award as opposed to the franchise's later technical ones. Paramount Pictures and Roddenberry began developing a new series, Star Trek: Phase II, in May 1975 in response to the franchise's newfound popularity. However, work on the series ended when the proposed Paramount Television Service folded.
Following the success of the science fiction movies Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Paramount adapted the planned pilot episode of Phase II into the feature film, Star Trek: The Motion Picture. The film opened in North America on December 7, 1979, with mixed reviews from critics. The film earned $139 million worldwide, below expectations but enough for Paramount to create a sequel. The studio forced Roddenberry to relinquish creative control of future sequels.
The success of the critically acclaimed sequel, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, reversed the fortunes of the franchise. While the sequel grossed less than the first movie, The Wrath of Khan's lower production costs made it net more profit. Paramount produced six Star Trek feature films between 1979 and 1991. In response to the popularity of Star Trek's feature films, the franchise returned to television with Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) in 1987. Paramount chose to distribute it as a first-run syndication show rather than a network show.[tpl]cite book| author = Alexander, David| title = Star Trek Creator: The Authorized Biography of Gene Roddenberry| url = http://books.google.com/?id=LJ-Eq73RPWgC| date = February 16, 1995| publisher = Roc| isbn = 0-451-45440-5 [/tpl]

===After Roddenberry===

Following Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Roddenberry's role was changed from producer to creative consultant with minimal input to the films while being heavily involved with the creation of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Roddenberry died on October 24, 1991, giving executive producer Rick Berman control of the franchise. Star Trek had become known to those within Paramount as "the franchise", because of its great success and recurring role as a tent pole for the studio when other projects failed.[tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1991-05-05/magazine/tm-2100_1_star-trek | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ybc7Wqbr | archivedate=May 11, 2011 | title=How Gene Roddenberry and his Brain Trust Have Boldly Taken 'Star Trek' Where No TV Series Has Gone Before : Trekking to the Top | work=Los Angeles Times | publisher=Tribune Company | date=May 5, 1991 | page = 16 | accessdate=October 19, 2011 | author=Teitelbaum, Sheldon[/tpl] TNG had the highest ratings of any Star Trek series and became the #1 syndicated show during the last years of its original seven-season run.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Contrib/SciFi/StarTrek/history.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101205052936/http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Contrib/SciFi/StarTrek/history.html |archivedate= December 5, 2010|title= Star Trek — A Short History|accessdate=August 21, 2006[/tpl] In response to TNG's success, Paramount released a spin-off series Deep Space Nine in 1993. While never as popular as TNG, the series had sufficient ratings for it to last seven seasons.
In January 1995, a few months after TNG ended, Paramount released a fourth TV series, Voyager. Star Trek saturation reached a peak in the mid-1990s with DS9 and Voyager airing concurrently and three of the four TNG-based feature films released in 1994, 1996, and 1998. By 1998, Star Trek was Paramount's most important property; the enormous profits of "the franchise" funded much of the rest of the studio's operations.[tpl]cite book| author = Poe, Stephen Edward| title = A Vision of the Future| url = http://books.google.com/?id=MiJTlrdSkpAC| date = April 1, 1998| publisher = Simon and Schuster| isbn = 0-671-53481-5 [/tpl][tpl]rp|49–50,54[/tpl] Voyager became the flagship show of the new United Paramount Network (UPN) and thus the first major network Star Trek series since the original.[tpl]cite news| last = Levesque| first = John| title = UPN in Search of Post-'Voyager' Flagship| publisher = Seattle PI| date = January 6, 2001| url = http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/upn06.shtml | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101205023950/http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/upn06.shtml |archivedate= December 3, 2010| accessdate =June 30, 2009[/tpl]
After Voyager ended, UPN produced Enterprise, a prequel TV series to the original show. Enterprise did not enjoy the high ratings of its predecessors and UPN threatened to cancel it after the series' third season. Fans launched a campaign reminiscent of the one that saved the third season of the Original Series. Paramount renewed Enterprise for a fourth season,[tpl]cite web | title = Fan Groups, Sites Rally on Behalf of Enterprise | publisher = startrek.com| date = May 28, 2004| url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/5500.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100117112055/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/5500.html |archivedate= January 17, 2010| accessdate =October 19, 2011[/tpl] but moved it to the Friday night death slot.[tpl]cite press release| title = UPN's 2004-2005 Schedule| publisher = UPN| date = May 20, 2004| url = http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/5500.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100117112055/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/5500.html |archivedate= January 17, 2010| accessdate =July 4, 2009| accessdate =October 19, 2011[/tpl] Like the Original Series, Enterprise ratings dropped during this time slot, and UPN cancelled Enterprise at the end of its fourth season.

Though the effort garnered considerable press, the fan drive failed to save the series. The cancellation of Enterprise ended an eighteen-year continuous production run of Star Trek programming on television. The poor box office performance in 2002 of the film Nemesis, cast an uncertain light upon the future of the franchise. Paramount relieved Berman, the franchise producer, of control of Star Trek.

===Reboot===

Paramount turned down several proposals in the mid-2000s to restart the franchise. These included pitches from film director Bryan Singer,[tpl]cite web|last=Fitzpatrick |first=Kevin |url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/bryan-singer-tv-star-trek |title=Bryan Singer's TV Star Trek Details Emerge! |publisher=Ugo.com |date=April 12, 2011 |accessdate=January 18, 2012[/tpl] Babylon 5 creator J.

Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and Lost producer, J. J. Abrams, had the freedom to reinvent the feel of Trek.
The team created the franchise's eleventh film, titled simply Star Trek, releasing it in May 2009. The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original Enterprise. Star Trek was a prequel of the original series set in an alternate timeline.  This gave the film and future sequels to it freedom from the need to conform to the franchise's canonical timeline. The eleventh Star Trek film's marketing campaign targeted non-fans, even stating in the film's advertisements that "this is not your father's Star Trek".[tpl]cite news | last = Adler| first = Margot| title = Some Older 'Star Trek' Fans May Skip This Voyage| publisher = NPR| date = May 6, 2009| url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103824300| accessdate =October 19, 2011[/tpl]

==Television series==

Six television series make up the bulk of the Star Trek mythos: The Original Series, The Animated Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise. All the different versions in total amount to 726 Star Trek episodes across the 30 seasons of the TV series.[ref]This episode count includes the animated series, and the original pilot, "The Cage". Two part episodes that were not originally aired at the same time are considered two separate episodes. Ten feature length episodes were originally aired as two-hour presentations and are sometimes considered single episodes, however in this count - the standard wikipedia count - they too are seen as two individual episodes.
The Star Trek wiki, Memory Alpha, differs from the count listed because it includes the feature films in its total and it uses the method that counts feature length episodes as single episodes.  This makes that wiki's total release count 728.

===The Original Series (1966–69)===

Star Trek: The Original Series or "TOS"Originally titled Star Trek, it has in recent years become known as Star Trek: The Original Series or as "Classic Star Trek"—retronyms that distinguish it from its sequels and the franchise as a whole. debuted in the United States on NBC on September 8, 1966.[tpl]cite news | last =Lee| first =Luaine| title ='Star Trek' turns 40| work =San Jose Mercury News| publisher =McClatchy News| date =August 18, 2006| url =http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/15305203.htm| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060901115942/http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/15305203.htm| archivedate = September 1, 2006| accessdate =December 15, 2008 [/tpl] The show tells the tale of the crew of the starship Enterprise and its five-year mission "to boldly go where no man has gone before." The original 1966–1969 television series featured William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk, Leonard Nimoy as Spock, DeForest Kelley as Dr. Leonard "Bones" McCoy, James Doohan as Montgomery "Scotty" Scott, Nichelle Nichols as Uhura, George Takei as Hikaru Sulu, and Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov. During the series' original run, it earned several nominations for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and won twice: for the two-parter "The Menagerie" and the Harlan Ellison-written episode "The City on the Edge of Forever".
After three seasons, NBC canceled the show, and the last original episode aired on June 3, 1969.[tpl]cite web| title =Star Trek: Summary| work =TV.com| url =http://www.tv.com/shows/star-trek/| accessdate =December 15, 2008[/tpl] However, the petition near the end of the second season to save the show signed by many Caltech students and its multiple Hugo nominations would indicate that despite low Nielsen ratings, it was highly popular with science fiction fans and engineering students. The series later became popular in reruns and found a cult following.

===The Animated Series (1973–74)===

Star Trek: The Animated Series, produced by Filmation, ran for two seasons from 1973 to 1974. Most of the original cast performed the voices of their characters from The Original Series, and many of the original series' writers, such as D. C. Fontana, David Gerrold and Paul Schneider, wrote for the series. While the animated format allowed the producers to create more exotic alien landscapes and life forms, animation errors and liberal reuse of shots and musical cues have tarnished the series' reputation.[tpl]cite web| last =Dursin| first =Andre| title =Filmation's Star Trek Beams Up: Andy Reviews The Animated Adventures| work =The Aisle Seat| date =November 14, 2006| url =http://www.andyfilm.com/11-14-06.html| accessdate =October 19, 2011[/tpl] Although it was originally sanctioned by Paramount, which owned the Star Trek franchise following its acquisition of Desilu in 1967, Gene Roddenberry often spoke of TAS as non canon.[tpl]cite book| author = Ayers, Jeff| title = Voyages of the Imagination: The Star Trek Fiction Companion| url = http://books.google.com/?id=avZlUJBIJDMC| date = November 14, 2006| publisher = Pocket Books| isbn = 1-4165-0349-8 [/tpl] Star Trek writers have used elements of the animated series in later live-action series and movies, and [tpl]As of|2007|June|lc=Y[/tpl], the Animated Series has references in the library section of the official Startrek.com web site.

===The Next Generation (1987–1994)===

Star Trek: The Next Generation, also known as "TNG", takes place about a century after The Original Series (2366-2369). It features a new starship, the Enterprise-D, and a new crew led by Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes). Some crewmembers represent new alien races, including Deanna Troi, a half-Betazoid counselor played by Marina Sirtis. Michael Dorn plays Worf, the first Klingon officer in Starfleet, alongside Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher, LeVar Burton as chief engineer Geordi La Forge, the android Data portrayed by Brent Spiner, and Dr. Crusher's son Wesley Crusher played by Wil Wheaton. The show premiered on September 28, 1987, and ran for seven seasons, ending on May 23, 1994.Star Trek: The Next Generation TV Show. Retrieved August 21, 2006. It had the highest ratings of any of the Star Trek series and became the #1 syndicated show during the last few years of its original run, allowing it to act as a springboard for ideas in other series. Many relationships and races introduced in TNG became the basis of episodes in Deep Space 9 and Voyager. During its run it earned several Emmy awards and nominations – including a nomination for Best Dramatic Series during its final season – two Hugo Awards, and a Peabody Award for Outstanding Television Programming for the episode "The Big Goodbye".BBC Online — Star Trek: The Next Generation.

===Deep Space Nine (1993–99)===

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, also known as "DS9", takes place during the last years and the immediate post-years of The Next Generation (2369–2375) and aired for seven seasons, debuting the week of January 3, 1993.Star Trek: Deep Space Nine TV Show. Retrieved August 21, 2006. Like Star Trek: The Next Generation, it aired in syndication in the United States and Canada. Unlike the other Star Trek series, DS9 takes place primarily on a space station rather than aboard a starship.
The show begins after the brutal Cardassian occupation of the planet Bajor. The liberated Bajoran people ask the United Federation of Planets to help run a Cardassian built space station, Deep Space Nine, outside of Bajor. After the Federation takes control of the station, the protagonists of the show discover a uniquely stable wormhole that provides immediate access to the distant Gamma Quadrant making Bajor and the station one of the most strategically important locations in the galaxy.STARTREK.COM: Emissary. Retrieved August 21, 2006. The show chronicles the events of the station's crew, led by Commander (later Captain) Benjamin Sisko, played by Avery Brooks, and Major (later Colonel) Kira Nerys, played by Nana Visitor. Recurring plot elements include the repercussions of the Cardassian occupation of Bajor, Sisko's spiritual role for the Bajorans as the Emissary of the Prophets, and in later seasons a war with the Dominion.
Deep Space Nine stands apart from earlier Trek series for its lengthy serialized storytelling, conflict within the crew, and religious themes—all elements that critics and audiences praised but Roddenberry forbade in the original series and The Next Generation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://scifi.about.com/blinterarma2.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030407175159/http://scifi.about.com/blinterarma2.htm |archivedate=April 7, 2003 |title=Review of "Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges" |accessdate=October 29, 2006 [/tpl] Nevertheless, he was informed before his death of DS9, making this the last Star Trek series connected to Gene Roddenberry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106145/trivia|title=Trivia for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=October 19, 2011[/tpl]

===Voyager (1995–2001)===

Star Trek: Voyager ran for seven seasons, airing from January 16, 1995, to May 23, 2001, launching a new Paramount-owned television network UPN. It features Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.html?id=131 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040116142328/http://revolutionsf.com/article.html?id=131 |archivedate= January 16, 2004|title= RevolutionSF — Star Trek: Voyager : Review|accessdate=August 24, 2006[/tpl] the first female commanding officer in a leading role of a Star Trek series, and Commander Chakotay, played by Robert Beltran. Voyager takes place at about the same time period as Deep Space Nine and the years following that show's end (2371–2378). The premiere episode has the USS Voyager and its crew pursue a Maquis (Federation rebels) ship. Both ships become stranded in the Delta Quadrant about 70,000 light years from Earth.http://www.fandango.com/startrek:voyager%255Btvseries%255D_v263074/plotsummary Star Trek: Voyager TV series] synopsis URL accessed April 4, 2007 Faced with a 75-year voyage to Earth, the crew must learn to work together to overcome challenges on their long and perilous journey home while also seeking ways to shorten the voyage. Like Deep Space Nine, early seasons of Voyager feature more conflict between its crewmembers than seen in later episodes. Such conflict often arises from friction between "by-the-book" Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together on Voyager. Eventually, though, they settle their differences, after which the overall tone becomes more reminiscent of The Original Series. The starship Voyager, isolated from its home, faces new cultures and dilemmas not possible in shows based in the Alpha Quadrant.  Later seasons, however, brought an influx of characters and cultures from prior shows, such as the Borg, Q, the Ferengi, Romulans, Klingons, Cardassians and cast members of The Next Generation.

===Enterprise (2001–05)===

Star Trek: Enterprise, originally titled Enterprise, is a prequel to the original Star Trek series. It aired from September 26, 2001 to May 13, 2005.Star Trek: Enterprise Summary. Retrieved August 24, 2006. Enterprise takes place in the 2150s, some 90 years after the events of Zefram Cochrane's first warp flight and about a decade before the founding of the Federation. The show centers on the voyages of Earth's first warp-five capable starship, the Enterprise, commanded by Captain Jonathan Archer (played by Scott Bakula), and the Vulcan Sub-Commander T'Pol (played by Jolene Blalock).
During the show's first two seasons, Enterprise featured self-contained episodes, like The Original Series, The Next Generation and Voyager. The third season consisted of one arc, "Xindi mission", which had the darker tone and serialized nature of Deep Space 9. Season 4 consisted of several two to three episode mini-arcs. The final season showed the origins of elements seen in earlier series, and it rectified and resolved some core continuity problems between the various Star Trek series. Ratings for Enterprise started strong but declined rapidly. Although critics received the fourth season very well, both fans and the cast reviled the series finale, partly because of the episode's focus on the guest appearance of members of The Next Generation cast.Jolene Blalock's negative reaction is discussed at [tpl]cite web|author=Lee, Patrick|date=May 14, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101153926/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1662.html|archivedate=January 1, 2007|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1662.html|title=Star Trek: Enterprise Series Finale|publisher=Sci Fi Weekly|accessdate=January 16, 2009[/tpl].

Paramount Pictures has produced twelve Star Trek feature films, the most recent being released in May 2013.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1408101/ The first six films continue the adventures of the cast of The Original Series; the seventh film, Generations was designed as a transition from that cast to The Next Generation television series; the next three films, 8–10, focused completely on the Next Generation cast.Film titles of the North American and UK releases of the films no longer contained the number of the film following the sixth film (the sixth was Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country but the seventh was Star Trek: Generations). However, European releases continued using numbers in the film titles until Nemesis.

===Magazines===

Star Trek has led directly or indirectly to the creation of a number of magazines which focus either on science fiction or specifically on Star Trek. Starlog was a magazine which was founded in the 1970s. Initially, its main focus was on Star Trek actors, but then it began to expand its scope.
In 2013, Star Trek Magazine was a significant publication from the UK which was sold at newsstands and also via subscription. Other magazines through the years included professional magazines as well as magazines produced by fans, referred to as "fanzines." Star Trek: The Magazine was a magazine published in the USA which ceased publication in 2003.

Beyond Star Trek's fictional innovations, its contributions to TV history included a multicultural and multiracial cast. While more common in subsequent years, in the 1960s it was controversial to feature an Enterprise crew that included a Japanese helmsman, a Russian navigator, a black female communications officer, and a Vulcan-Terran first officer. Captain Kirk's and Lt. Uhura's kiss, in the episode Plato's Stepchildren, was also daring, and is often mis-cited as being American television's first scripted, interracial kiss, even though several other interracial kisses predated this one.[tpl]cite video | people = Nancy Sinatra | title = Movin' with Nancy | medium = DVD Commentary Track | publisher = Image Intertainment | location = Chatsworth, CA |date = 2000 [/tpl]

==Awards and honors==

Of the various science fiction awards for drama, only the Hugo Award dates back as far as the original series.Although the Hugo Award is mainly given for print-media science fiction, its "best drama" award is usually given to film or television presentations. The Hugo does not give out awards for best actor, director, or other aspects of film production. Before 2002, films and television shows competed for the same Hugo, before the split of the drama award into short drama and long drama. In 1968, all five nominees for a Hugo Award were individual episodes of Star Trek, as were three of the five nominees in 1967.The other two films nominated for the Hugo award in 1967 were the films Fahrenheit 451 and Fantastic Voyage The only Star Trek series to not get even a Hugo nomination are the animated series and Voyager, though only the original series and Next Generation ever won the award. No Star Trek featured film has ever won a Hugo, though a few were nominated. In 2008, the fan made episode of Star Trek: New Voyages entitled "World Enough and Time" was nominated for the Hugo for Best Short Drama.Full lists of Hugo award winners are at http://dpsinfo.com/awardweb/hugos Nominations can be found at http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/HugoNomList.html
The two Star Trek series to win multiple Saturn awards during their run were The Next Generation (twice winning for best television series) and Voyager (twice winning for best actress - Kate Mulgrew and Jeri Ryan).The science fiction Saturn Awards did not exist during broadcasting of the original series. Unlike the Hugo, the Saturn Award gives out prizes for best actor, special effects and music, and also unlike the Hugo (until 2002) movies and television shows have never competed against each other for Saturns. The original series retroactively won a Saturn Award for best DVD release. Several Star Trek films have won Saturns including categories such as best actor, actress, director, costume design, and special effects. However, Star Trek has never won a Saturn for best make-up.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/SaturnNomList.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090512152954/http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/SaturnNomList.html |archivedate= May 12, 2009 |title=Saturn award winners and nominees can be found at |publisher=Locusmag.com |accessdate=May 23, 2010[/tpl]

==Corporate ownership==

At Star Trek[tpl]'[/tpl]s creation, Norway Productions, Roddenberry's production company, shared ownership with Desilu Productions and, after Gulf+Western acquired Desilu in 1967, with Paramount Pictures, the conglomerate's film studio.
