Needlework is a broad term for the handicrafts of decorative sewing and textile arts.  Anything that uses a needle for construction can be called needlework.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/needlework|title=Needlework|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-23[/tpl] The definition may expand to include related textile crafts such as a crochet hook or tatting shuttles.
Similar abilities often transfer well between different varieties of needlework, such as fine motor skill and a knowledge of textile fibers.  Some of the same tools may be used in several different varieties of needlework.  For instance, a needle threader is useful in nearly all needlecrafts.
