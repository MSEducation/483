The soundtrack album credits the tracks to Terry Tucker and Erika Eigen, respectively. The track "The Overture to the Sun" was also used by the American neofolk/martial-industrial band Blood Axis for their song "Lord of Ages".
"Lighthouse Keeper" was also featured in television series The Maxx.
One track from the album, "Magician in the Mountain", was remixed in Mix Master Mike's mixtape Terrorwrist Delivery Service.
