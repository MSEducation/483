Route 187 is a state highway in the state of New Jersey, in the United States. The route is only [tpl]convert|0.40|mi|km[/tpl] long, running along Brigantine Boulevard in Atlantic City. The route's southern terminus is at the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector (NJ 446X) off-ramp to U.S. Route 30 and terminates at its parent, New Jersey Route 87 (Huron Boulevard) nearby. Route 187 is not maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation, but instead the South Jersey Transportation Authority, which maintains the Brigantine Connector nearby.
Route 187 originates as an alignment of State Highway Route S-4-A, designated in the 1927 renumbering of highways. After Route S-4-A's extension from Ocean County was canceled, Route S-4-A along this alignment became State Highway Route S-56, as a spur of Route 56. Route S-56 became Route 87 in the renumbering, and by the 1980s, Route 87 was realigned off of Brigantine Boulevard and onto Huron Avenue. The route was later renumbered Route 187. During construction of the Brigantine Connector in 2001, Route 187 was severed from its former southern terminus at U.S. Route 30 and truncated back to its current alignment.

==Route description==

Route 187 begins at an intersection with an off-ramp for U.S. Route 30 from the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector (NJ 446X) in Atlantic City. The highway heads northward along Brigantine Boulevard, passing by fields along the Connector and to the west of local townhouses. Intersecting with North Carolina Avenue, a dead-end connector near MGM Casino and Resort, Route 187 continues along Brigantine Boulevard through Atlantic City, passing a large baseball field before intersecting with West Maryland Avenue. A short distance after West Maryland Avenue, Route 187 terminates at an intersection with New Jersey Route 87 (Huron Avenue) while Brigantine Boulevard continues a short distance, merging into the Connector soon after.[tpl]cite map|url=http://www.maps.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?v=2&FORM=LMLTCP&cp=qjw7878sxn65&style=b&lvl=1&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&phx=0&phy=0&phscl=1&scene=14913839&rtp=pos.39.3722044676542_-74.4323080033064_near%20Brigantine%20Blvd%2C%20Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey%2008401%2C%20United%20States__~pos.39.3777103722095_-74.4306148588657_near%20Brigantine%20Blvd%2C%20Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey%2008401%2C%20United%20States__&rtop=0~0~0&encType=1|title=Overview map of Route 187|publisher=Bing Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ Inc.|year=2009|accessdate=October 19, 2009[/tpl]

==History==

Route 187 originates as a former alignment of State Highway Route S-4-A dating back to the 1927 state highway renumbering. State Highway Route S-4-A was proposed to be an extension along Great Bay Boulevard from Tuckerton to Atlantic City.[tpl]cite book|title=ROUTE No. S-4-A. EXTENDING FROM ROUTE NO. 4 NEAR TUCKERTON TO LITTLE BEACH.|publisher=New Jersey State Legislature|location=Trenton, New Jersey|year=1927|chapter=319[/tpl] Route S-4-A was never constructed across the waterway and in 1945, the route was changed from State Highway Route S-4-A to Route S-56.[tpl]cite book|title=ROUTE NO. 56 S.

However, the southern terminus was truncated when the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector was constructed in 2001,[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DEEDC133DF93BA15754C0A9679C8B63|title=Atlantic City Car Tunnel Opens Briefly, for Pedestrians|first=Iver|last=Patterson|publisher=The New York Times|date=July 28, 2001|accessdate=2007-12-30[/tpl] which severed Route 187 from Route 30. Route 187 now ends at the off-ramp to U.S. Route 30.
