In 1995 two to three million people were estimated to be permanently disabled because of leprosy.[tpl]cite journal |author=WHO|title=Leprosy disabilities: magnitude of the problem |journal=Weekly Epidemiological Record |volume=70 |issue=38 |pages=269–75 |year=1995 |pmid=7577430[/tpl] India has the greatest number of cases, with Brazil second and Myanmar third. In 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed 91 countries in which leprosy is endemic. India, Burma, and Nepal contained 70% of cases. India reports over 50% of the world's leprosy cases.Surgery grants for leprosy sufferers in India. Times of India. February 2, 2009. In 2002, 763,917 new cases were detected worldwide, and in that year the WHO listed Brazil, Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Nepal as having 90% of leprosy cases. Although the number of cases worldwide continues to fall, pockets of high prevalence continue in certain areas such as Brazil, South Asia (India, Nepal), some parts of Africa (Tanzania, Madagascar, Mozambique), and the western Pacific.

===Disease burden===

Although the number of new leprosy cases occurring each year is important as a measure of transmission, it is difficult to measure due to leprosy's long incubation period, delays in diagnosis after onset of the disease, and the lack of laboratory tools to detect it in the very early stages. Instead, the registered prevalence is used. Registered prevalence is a useful proxy indicator of the disease burden, as it reflects the number of active leprosy cases diagnosed with the disease and receiving treatment with MDT at a given point in time. The prevalence rate is defined as the number of cases registered for MDT treatment among the population in which the cases have occurred, again at a given point in time.[tpl]cite journal |author= World Health Organization.|title=Epidemiology of leprosy in relation to control. Report of a WHO Study Group |journal=World Health Organ Tech Rep Ser |volume=716 |issue= |pages=1–60 |year=1985 |pmid=3925646 |isbn= 92-4-120716-7 |publisher= World Health Organization |location= Geneva |oclc= 12095109[/tpl]
New case detection is another indicator of the disease that is usually reported by countries on an annual basis. It includes cases diagnosed with onset of disease in the year in question (true incidence) and a large proportion of cases with onset in previous years (termed a backlog prevalence of undetected cases).
Endemic countries also report the number of new cases with established disabilities at the time of detection, as an indicator of the backlog prevalence. Determination of the time of onset of the disease is, in general, unreliable, is very labor-intensive, and is seldom done in recording these statistics.

The term leprosy is derived from either the Indo-European term lap, which means the removal of scales, or the Greek word for "scales", lepra.[tpl]cite book|first=O.

The causative agent of leprosy, Mycobacterium leprae, was discovered by G. H.

In the 1950s dapsone was introduced. The search for further effective anti-leprosy drugs led to the use of clofazimine and rifampicin in the 1960s and 1970s.[tpl]cite journal | author= Rees RJ, Pearson JM, Waters MF|title=Experimental and Clinical Studies on Rifampicin in Treatment of Leprosy | journal=Br Med J|year=1970 |pages=89–92 | volume= 688 | issue= 1 | pmid=4903972|doi= 10.1136/bmj.1.5688.89 | pmc= 1699176[/tpl] Later, Indian scientist Shantaram Yawalkar and his colleagues formulated a combined therapy using rifampicin and dapsone, intended to mitigate bacterial resistance.[tpl]cite journal | author=Yawalkar SJ, McDougall AC, Languillon J, Ghosh S, Hajra SK, Opromolla DV, Tonello CJ | title=Once-monthly rifampicin plus daily dapsone in initial treatment of lepromatous leprosy | journal=Lancet| year=1982 | pages=1199–1202 |volume= 8283 | issue= 1 |pmid = 6122970 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(82)92334-0[/tpl] Multidrug therapy (MDT) combining all three drugs was first recommended by the WHO in 1981. These three anti-leprosy drugs are still used in the standard MDT regimens.
Leprosy was once believed to be highly contagious and was treated with mercury—all of which applied to syphilis, which was first described in 1530. It is possible that many early cases thought to be leprosy could actually have been syphilis.Syphilis through history Encyclopædia Britannica Effective treatment first appeared in the late 1940s. Resistance has developed to initial treatment. It was not until the introduction of MDT in the early 1980s that the disease could be diagnosed and treated successfully within the community.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.searo.who.int/en/section10/section373_11716.htm| title=Communicable Diseases Department, Leprosy FAQ | publisher=World Health Organization| date=2006-05-25 | accessdate=2010-01-31[/tpl]

==Society and culture==

===Treatment cost===

Between 1995 and 1999, WHO, with the aid of the Nippon Foundation, supplied all endemic countries with free Multi-Drug Treatment(MDT) in blister packs, channelled through Ministries of Health. This free provision was extended in 2000 and again in 2005 with donations by the MDT manufacturer Novartis through WHO. In the latest agreement signed between the company and WHO in October 2010, the provision of free MDT by WHO to all endemic countries will now run until at least the end of 2015. At the national level, non-government organizations (NGOs) affiliated to the national programme will continue to be provided with an appropriate free supply of this WHO supplied MDT by the government.

===Stigma in India===

Leprosy patients in India, like many parts of the world, suffer under some of the worst conditions and stereotypes about their disease. Depending on the level of disfigurement, a leper could receive harsher stigma and ostracism. Leprosy sufferers are markedly disadvantaged with respect to income, with 16-44% of victims reporting a decrease in pay as a result of having leprosy. Women suffer greater restrictions and social stigma than men. Leprosy prevents mothers from getting too close to their children out of fear that they could infect them. In a report, 49% of women stopped breast-feeding their babies as a result of having leprosy. Doctors and other health care providers and NGOs are working hard to educate people about the disease. In one study when leprosy treatment and education were mixed in with the local healthcare program, the attitudes towards the disease were somewhat alleviated as people had a better understanding of it. Now the disease prevalence has been reduced to less than 1 per million population in most parts of the country.Rafferty, Joy. "Curing the Stigma of Leprosy." Leprosy Review. 76 (2005): 119-126.
