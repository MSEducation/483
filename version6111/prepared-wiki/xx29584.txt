[[Tumucumaque National Park]]

CATEGORIES: National parks of Brazil, Protected areas of Amapá

The Tumucumaque National Park ([tpl]lang-pt|Parque Nacional Montanhas do Tumucumaque[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-pt|tumukuˈmaki[/tpl]) is situated in northwestern Brazil inside the Amazon Rainforest state of Amapá. It is bordered to the north by French Guyana and Suriname.
It was declared a national park on August 23, 2002, by the Government of Brazil, after collaboration of the WWF.
It has an area of [tpl]convert|38874|km2|sqmi|-1[/tpl], making it the world's largest tropical forest national park and larger than Belgium. This area even reaches [tpl]convert|59174|km2|sqmi|-1[/tpl] when putting the Tumucumaque National Park together with the bordering Guiana Amazonian Park, a national park in French Guiana. This combination of protected areas is still smaller than the three national parks system in the Brazil-Venezuelan border, where the Parima-Tapirapeco, Serrania de la Neblina and Serra da Neblina national parks have a combined area of over [tpl]convert|73000|km2|sqmi|-1[/tpl]. But the latter is certainly smaller if the first (Montanhas do Tumucumaque, Brazil, and French Guiana Amazonian Park, France) is combined with the large neighbour protected areas in northern Pará, Brazil, such as Grão-Pará Ecological Station, Maicuru Biological Reserve and many others. The importance is in fact that all this together make the Guiana Shield one of the best protected and largest ecological corridor of tropical rainforests in the world. It is an uninhabited region and is of high ecological value: most of its animal species, mainly fish and aquatic birds, are not found in any other place in the world. It is a habitat for jaguars, primates, aquatic turtles, eagles and the rare agouti.
The highest point of the Brazilian state of Amapá is located there, reaching 701 meters.Portal Brasil
