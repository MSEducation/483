Market houses are a notable feature of many Northern Ireland towns with varying styles of architecture, size and ornamentation making for a most interesting feature of the streetscape.  Originally there were three, four or even five bays on the ground floor which were an open arcade.  An upper floor was often used as a court house or ballroom.   Ornamentation consisted of a cupola, a clock or sometimes a dome or tower. Today most of the market houses in Ireland have been put to use as cultural venues or business premises.  Some are still derelict.
