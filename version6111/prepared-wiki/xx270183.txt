==History==

The building which subsequently housed the theater was originally designed by architect Thomas W. Lamb for the Davenport stock company. Construction began in 1909, but financial issues stalled it soon after. Later on, architect Erwin Rossbach was hired by the Association of Bible Students to complete the structure. The organization intended it to serve for religious lectures and screening Biblical films. It was completed in 1914, and named the 63rd Street Music Hall. From 1919, it served as a children's cinema.
On 31 January 1921, the Cort 63rd Street Theatre was opened in the building. In 1922, the theater was renamed Daly's 63rd Street Theatre, in honor of Augustine Daly.Nicholas Van Hoogstraten‏.
