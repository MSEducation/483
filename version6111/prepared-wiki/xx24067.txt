She is widely regarded as the greatest living actress, as well as one of the greatest actresses of all time.[tpl]cite book |last=Santas |first=Constantine |title=Responding to Film |year=2002 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield‏|isbn=0-8304-1580-7 |page=187[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Hollinger |first=Karen |title=The Actress: Hollywood Acting and the Female Star |year=2006 |publisher=CRS Press |isbn=0-415-97792-4 |pages=94–95[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=The Middle East |year=2005 |publisher=Library Information and Research Service |page=204[/tpl]
Streep made her professional stage debut in The Playboy of Seville (1971), before her screen debut in the television movie The Deadliest Season (1977). In that same year, she made her film debut in Julia (1977). Both critical and commercial success came quickly with roles in The Deer Hunter (1978) and Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), the first of which brought her an Academy Award nomination, and the second, her first win, for Best Supporting Actress. She later won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her roles in Sophie's Choice (1982) and The Iron Lady (2011). With 18 Academy Award nominations in 35 years, Streep holds the record as being the most nominated actor (male or female) in film history.
Streep has also received 28 Golden Globe nominations, winning eight, more nominations and more competitive (non-honorary) wins than any other actress or actor.Ehbar, Ned (February 28, 2014). "Did you know?" Metro. New York City. p. 18. Her work has also earned her two Emmy Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Cannes Film Festival award, five New York Film Critics Circle Awards, two BAFTA awards, two Australian Film Institute awards, five Grammy Award nominations, and a Tony Award nomination, among several others. She was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2004 and the Kennedy Center Honor in 2011 for her contribution to American culture through performing arts, the youngest actor in each award's history. President Barack Obama awarded her the 2010 National Medal of Arts.
In 2003, the government of France made her a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters.

Streep's father was of German and Swiss-German ancestry. Her patrilineal line traces back to Loffenau, Germany, from where her second great-grandfather, Gottfried Streeb (sic), emigrated to the United States, and where one of her ancestors served as mayor. Another line of her father's family was from Giswil in the canton of  Obwalden, a small town in Switzerland. Her mother had English, German, and Irish ancestry. Some of Streep's maternal ancestors lived in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, and were descended from 17th century immigrants from England.[tpl]cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Meryl Streep|pages=|publisher=Faces of America|year=2010|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/facesofamerica/profiles/meryl-streep/70/|accessdate=2010-02-05[/tpl] Her eighth great-grandfather, Lawrence Wilkinson, was one of the first Europeans to settle Rhode Island. Streep is also a distant relative of William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, and records show that her family is among the first purchasers of land in the state. Streep's maternal great-grandparents, Manus McFadden (b. 1831) and Grace Strain (b. 1832), were natives of the Hook Head district of Dunfanaghy, County Donegal, Ireland.[tpl]cite news|last=McKenzie|first=Joi-Marie|coauthors=|title=Henry Louis Gates Says He Broke Meryl Streep's Heart|pages=|publisher=Niteside|date=2010-02-04|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/blogs/niteside/Henry-Louis-Gates-Explores-Immigrant-Origins-of-Famous-Americans-83509992.html|accessdate=2010-02-04[/tpl]"Faces of America: Meryl Streep", PBS, Faces of America series, with Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://donegalnews.com/2014/01/meryl-streeps-great-grandparents-from-dunfanaghy/ |title=Meryl Streep’s great grandparents from Dunfanaghy |publisher=Donegalnews.com |date=2014-01-15 |accessdate=2014-04-20[/tpl]

==Career==

===1970s===

Streep performed in several theater productions in New York and New Jersey after graduating from Yale School of Drama,[tpl]cite episode|title=Meryl Streep |series=Inside the Actors Studio |serieslink=Inside the Actors Studio |network=Bravo |airdate=1998-11-22 |season=5 |number=1 |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0611276/[/tpl] including the New York Shakespeare Festival productions of Henry V, The Taming of the Shrew with Raúl Juliá, and Measure for Measure opposite Sam Waterston and John Cazale. At this time she entered a relationship with Cazale, with whom she lived until his death three years later. She starred on Broadway in the Brecht/Weill musical Happy End, and won an Obie for her performance in the all-sung off-Broadway production of Alice at the Palace.
Streep began auditioning for film roles, and later recalled an unsuccessful audition for Dino De Laurentiis for the leading female role in King Kong.

For the former, she received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play. Her other early Broadway credits include Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard and the Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill musical Happy End in which she originally appeared off-Broadway at the Chelsea Theater Center. She received Drama Desk Award nominations for both productions.
Streep's first feature film role was Julia (1977), in which she played a small but pivotal role during a flashback scene. Streep was living in New York City with Cazale, who had been diagnosed with bone cancer.[tpl]cite news |first=Paul |last=Gray |title=Cinema: A Mother Finds Herself |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948649-3,00.html |work =Time |page=3 |date=December 3, 1979 |accessdate=February 16, 2011[/tpl] He was cast in The Deer Hunter (1978), and Streep was delighted to secure a small role because it allowed her to remain with Cazale for the duration of filming. She was not specifically interested in the part, commenting, "They needed a girl between the two guys and I was it."[tpl]cite web |title=Magazines Archive |publisher=SimplyStreep.com |url=http://www.simplystreep.com/site/magazines/197902msmagazine/|accessdate=2009-08-14[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] citing [tpl]cite journal |work=Ms. Magazine |date=February 1979 |title=Meryl Streep to the Rescue[/tpl]
She played a leading role in the television miniseries Holocaust (1978) as a German woman married to a Jewish artist in Nazi era Germany. She later explained that she had considered the material to be "unrelentingly noble", and had taken the role only because she had needed money.[tpl]cite web |title=Magazines Archive |publisher=SimplyStreep.com |url=http://www.www.simplystreep.com/magazines/197808horizon.htm |accessdate=2009-06-07[/tpl] citing [tpl]cite journal |work=Horizon Magazine |date=August 1978 |title=Star Treks[/tpl] Streep travelled to Germany and Austria for filming while Cazale remained in New York. Upon her return, Streep found that Cazale's illness had progressed, and she nursed him until his death on March 12, 1978. She spoke of her grief and her hope that work would provide a diversion; she accepted a role in The Seduction of Joe Tynan (1979) with Alan Alda, later commenting that she played it on "automatic pilot", and performed the role of Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew for Shakespeare in the Park.[tpl]cite web |title=Magazines Archive |publisher=SimplyStreep.com |url=http://www.simplystreep.com/site/career/stage/ |accessdate=2009-06-07[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] citing [tpl]cite journal |work=TV Guide |date=June 1978 |title=From Homecoming Queen to Holocaust[/tpl] With an estimated audience of 109 million, Holocaust brought a degree of public recognition to Streep, who was described in August 1978 as "on the verge of national visibility".

The Deer Hunter (1978) was released a month later, and Streep was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.
Streep played a supporting role in Manhattan (1979) for Woody Allen, later stating that she had not seen a complete script and was given only the six pages of her own scenes,[tpl]cite web |title=Magazines Archive |publisher=SimplyStreep.com |url=http://www.www.simplystreep.com/magazines/197903lookmagazine.htm |accessdate=2009-06-07[/tpl] citing [tpl]cite journal |work=Look Magazine |date=March 1979 |title=Streep Year[/tpl] and that she had not been permitted to improvise a word of her dialogue.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=89W0QMDjA7gC&pg=PA71&dq=Meryl+Streep#PPA76,M1 |title=The Actress: Hollywood Acting and the Female Star |first=Karen |last=Hollinger |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |isbn=0-415-97792-4 |page=76[/tpl] Asked to comment on the script for Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), in a meeting with the producer Stan Jaffee, director Robert Benton and star Dustin Hoffman, Streep insisted that the female character was not representative of many real women who faced marriage breakdown and child custody battles, and was written as "too evil". Jaffee, Benton and Hoffman agreed with Streep, and the script was revised. In preparing for the part, Streep spoke to her own mother about her life as a mother and housewife with a career,Hollinger, p. 75 and frequented the Upper East Side neighborhood in which the film was set. Benton allowed Streep to write her dialogue in two of her key scenes, despite some objection from Hoffman.Hollinger, p. 77 Jaffee and Hoffman later spoke of Streep's tirelessness, with Hoffman commenting, "She's extraordinarily hardworking, to the extent that she's obsessive. I think that she thinks about nothing else but what she's doing."[tpl]cite web |title=Magazines Archive |publisher=SimplyStreep.com |url=http://www.www.simplystreep.com/magazines/197911playgirl.htm |accessdate=2009-06-07[/tpl] citing [tpl]cite journal |work=Playgirl Magazine |date=November 1979 |title=The Freshest Face in Hollywood[/tpl]
Streep drew critical acclaim for her performance in each of her three films released in 1979: the romantic comedy Manhattan, the political drama The Seduction of Joe Tynan and the family drama, Kramer vs. Kramer. She was awarded the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress, National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress and National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress for her collective work in the three films. Among the awards won for Kramer vs. Kramer were the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.

===1980s===

After supporting roles in two of the 1970s' most successful films, the consecutive winners of the Academy Award for Best Picture, The Deer Hunter and Kramer vs. Kramer, and praise for her versatility in several supporting roles, Streep progressed to leading roles. Her first was The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981). A story within a story drama, the film paired Streep with Jeremy Irons as contemporary actors, telling their modern story as well as the Victorian era drama they were performing. A New York Magazine article commented that, while many female stars of the past had cultivated a singular identity in their films, Streep was a "chameleon", willing to play any type of role.[tpl]cite news |last=Denby |first=David |title=Meryl Streep is Madonna and siren in The French Lieutenant's Woman |work=New York Magazine |date=1981-09-21 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-OUCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=Meryl+Streep&lr=#PPA26,M1 |accessdate=2009-06-15|page=27[/tpl] Streep was awarded a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her work.
Her next film, the psychological thriller, Still of the Night (1982) reunited her with Robert Benton, the director of Kramer vs. Kramer, and co-starred Roy Scheider and Jessica Tandy. Vincent Canby, writing for The New York Times, noted that the film was an homage to the works of Alfred Hitchcock, but that one of its main weaknesses was a lack of chemistry between Streep and Scheider, concluding that Streep "is stunning, but she's not on screen anywhere near long enough".[tpl]cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title='Still of the Night', in Hitchcock Manner |work=The New York Times |date=1985-09-20 |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C02E2D8123BF93AA25752C1A964948260 |accessdate=2009-06-06[/tpl]
As the Polish holocaust survivor in Sophie's Choice (1982), Streep's emotional dramatic performance and her apparent mastery of a Polish accent drew praise. William Styron wrote the novel with Ursula Andress in mind for the part of Sophie, but Streep was very determined to get the role. After she obtained a pirated copy of the script, she went to Alan J. Pakula and threw herself on the ground begging him to give her the part.."[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] Streep filmed the "choice" scene in one take and refused to do it again, as she found shooting the scene extremely painful and emotionally exhausting.[tpl]cite news |title=What Makes Meryl Magic |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924815-8,00.html |accessdate=2009-06-15 |date=1981-09-07 |work=Time | first=John | last=Skow[/tpl] Among several notable acting awards, Streep won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. Roger Ebert said of her performance, "Streep plays the Brooklyn scenes with an enchanting Polish-American accent (she has the first accent I've ever wanted to hug), and she plays the flashbacks in subtitled German and Polish. There is hardly an emotion that Streep doesn't touch in this movie, and yet we're never aware of her straining. This is one of the most astonishing and yet one of the most unaffected and natural performances I can imagine."[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
She followed this success with a biographical film, Silkwood (1983), in which she played her first real-life character, the union activist Karen Silkwood. She discussed her preparation for the role in an interview with Roger Ebert and said that she had met with people close to Silkwood to learn more about her, and in doing so realized that each person saw a different aspect of Silkwood.[tpl]cite book |first=Roger|last=Ebert |coauthor=David Bordwell|title=Awake in the dark: the best of Roger Ebert: forty years of reviews, essays, and interviews |url=http://books.google.com/?id=YIU1jlgPjr8C&pg=PA64&dq=Meryl+Streep#PPA64,M1 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-226-18200-2 |page=64[/tpl] Streep concentrated on the events of Silkwood's life and concluded, "I didn't try to turn myself into Karen. I just tried to look at what she did. I put together every piece of information I could find about her... What I finally did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the inside."
Her next films were a romantic drama, Falling in Love (1984) opposite Robert De Niro, and a British drama, Plenty (1985). Roger Ebert said of Streep's performance in Plenty that she conveyed "great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic, self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm... Streep creates a whole character around a woman who could have simply been a catalogue of symptoms."[tpl]cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |title='Plenty' review |work=Chicago Sun Times |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19850920/REVIEWS/509200303/1023 |date=1982-11-19 |accessdate=2009-06-06[/tpl]
Out of Africa (1985) starred Streep as the Danish writer Karen Blixen and co-starred Robert Redford. A significant critical success, the film received a 63% "fresh" rating from Rotten Tomatoes.[tpl]cite web |title=Out of Africa (1985) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/out_of_africa/ |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2009-06-06[/tpl] Streep co-starred with Jack Nicholson in her next two films, the dramas Heartburn (1986) and Ironweed (1987), in which she sang onscreen for the first time since the television movie, Secret Service, in 1977. In A Cry in the Dark, aka Evil Angels (1988), she played the biographical role of Lindy Chamberlain, an Australian woman who had been convicted of the murder of her infant daughter despite Chamberlain claiming the baby had been taken by a dingo (a claim that was later vindicated). Filmed in Australia, Streep won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, a Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival, the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress and was nominated for several other awards for her portrayal of Chamberlain.
In She-Devil (1989), Streep played her first comedic film role, opposite Roseanne Barr. Richard Corliss, writing for Time, commented that Streep was the "one reason" to see the film and observed that it marked a departure from the type of role for which she had been known, saying, "Surprise! Inside the Greer Garson roles Streep usually plays, a vixenish Carole Lombard is screaming to be cut loose."[tpl]cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |title=Warty Worm, "She-Devil" review |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959340,00.html |work=Time magazine |date=1989-12-11 |accessdate=2009-06-07[/tpl]

===1990s===

In the 1990s, Streep continued to play a great variety of roles. From 1984 to 1990, she won six People's Choice Awards for Favorite Motion Picture Actress, and in 1990 was named World Favorite. Biographer Karen Hollinger described this period as a downturn in the popularity of Streep's films, attributing this partly to a critical perception that her comedies had been an attempt to convey a lighter image following several serious but commercially unsuccessful dramas, and more significantly to the lack of options available to an actress in her forties.p. 78 Streep commented that she had limited her options by her preference to work in Los Angeles, close to her family, a situation that she had anticipated in a 1981 interview when she commented, "By the time an actress hits her mid-forties, no one's interested in her anymore. And if you want to fit a couple of babies into that schedule as well, you've got to pick your parts with great care."
Streep played a drug-addicted movie actress in Postcards from the Edge, a screen adaptation of Carrie Fisher's novel of the same name, with Dennis Quaid and Shirley MacLaine. Streep and Goldie Hawn had established a friendship and were interested in making a film together. After considering various projects, they decided upon Thelma and Louise, until Streep's pregnancy coincided with the filming schedule, and the producers decided to proceed with Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis. They subsequently filmed the farcical black comedy, Death Becomes Her, with Bruce Willis as their co-star. Time's Richard Corliss wrote approvingly of Streep's "wicked-witch routine" but dismissed the film as "She-Devil with a make-over".[tpl]cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |title=Beverly Hills Corpse, "Death Becomes Her" review |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976129,00.html |work=Time magazine |date=1992-08-03 |accessdate=2009-06-07[/tpl]
In 1995, Streep played opposite Clint Eastwood in the love story The Bridges of Madison County (1995).thumb|250px|Hollywood Walk of Fame Based on a best-selling novel by Robert James Waller,McGilligan, p.492 it relates the story of Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), a photographer working for National Geographic, who has a love affair with a middle-aged Italian farm wife in Iowa named Francesca (Streep). Streep and Eastwood got along famously during production and such was their on-screen chemistry that a number of people believed that the two were having an affair off-camera, although this was denied by both.McGilligan, p.499 The film was a hit at the box office and grossed $70 million in the United States.McGilligan, p.503 The film, unlike the novel, surprised film critics and was warmly received. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that Clint had managed to create "a moving, elegiac love story at the heart of Mr. Waller's self-congratulatory overkill", while Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal described The Bridges of Madison County as "one of the most pleasurable films in recent memory".
In 1996, Streep starred as Lee in Marvin's Room, an adaptation of the play by Scott McPherson. Diane Keaton played her estranged sister Bessie, a woman battling leukemia, although Streep had initially been considered for the role. The film also starred a young Leonardo DiCaprio as Streep's rebellious son. Roger Ebert stated that "Streep and Keaton, in their different styles, find ways to make Lee and Bessie into much more than the expression of their problems."Roger Ebert. Review- Marvin's Room. January 10, 1997. Retrieved March 25, 2006. Although critically acclaimed, the film was not released on a wide scale. Streep, however, earned another Golden Globe nomination for the film.
In 1999, Streep portrayed Roberta Guaspari, a real-life New Yorker who found passion and enlightenment teaching violin to inner-city kids in East Harlem, in the music drama Music of the Heart. A departure from director Wes Craven’s previous work on films like A Nightmare on Elm Street and the Scream series, Streep replaced singer Madonna who left the project before filming began due to creative differences with Craven. Required to perform on the violin, Streep went through two months of intense training, four to six hours a day.http://www.lifewhile.com/news/136587/detail.html[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Accents and dialects==

Streep is well known for her ability to imitate a wide range of accents, from Danish in Out of Africa (1985) to English Received pronunciation in Plenty (also 1985), The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981) and The Iron Lady (2011); from Italian in The Bridges of Madison County (1995) to a Minnesota accent in A Prairie Home Companion (2006) and from Irish-American in Ironweed to a heavy Bronx accent in Doubt.  After A Cry in the Dark (1988), critics were impressed with Streep's ability to master an Australian accent with shades of New Zealand English.[tpl]cite news |title=Trial by fury |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/11/22/1100972318463.html | publisher = The Sydney Morning Herald | date=2004-11-23[/tpl]  For her role in the film Sophie's Choice (1982), she spoke both English and German with a Polish accent, as well as Polish itself. In The Iron Lady, she reproduced the vocal style of Margaret Thatcher from the time before she became Britain's Prime Minister, and after she had taken elocution lessons to change her pitch, pronunciation and delivery.
Despite the accolades accorded to her, Streep has emphasized that adopting accents is an element she simply considers an obvious part of creating a character. When asked whether accents helped her get into character, she responded, "I'm always baffled by this question... How could I play that part and talk like me?" When questioned in Belfast as to how she reproduces different accents, Streep replied, "I listen" - in a dead-on Ulster accent.Newsletter (20 August 2007) Oscar winner boosts new arts centre plan.

When asked if religion plays a part in her life, in an interview in 2009, Streep replied, "I follow no doctrine. I don't belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an ashram.""Movies, Marriage, and Turning Sixty'. The Independent. January 24, 2009. In an interview in December 2008 she also alluded to her inability to follow a religion when she said "So I've always been really, deeply interested, because I think I can understand the solace that's available in the whole construct of religion. But I really don't believe in the power of prayer, or things would have been avoided that have happened, that are awful. So it's a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can't go there." When asked from where she draws consolation in the face of aging and death, she responded, "Consolation? I'm not sure I have it. I have a belief, I guess, in the power of the aggregate human attempt – the best of ourselves. In love and hope and optimism – you know, the magic things that seem inexplicable. Why we are the way we are. I do have a sense of trying to make things better.
