James Richard "Jim" Leyland (born December 15, 1944) is a retired Major League Baseball manager.  He currently serves as a special assistant to the Detroit Tigers.
He led the Florida Marlins to a World Series championship in 1997, and previously won three straight division titles (1990, 1991, and 1992) with the Pittsburgh Pirates. With the Tigers' victory in the 2006 American League Championship Series, Leyland became the seventh manager in history to win pennants in both the National and American Leagues. He is a three-time Manager of the Year Award winner, twice in the National League (1990 and 1992), and once in the American League (2006). 

==Early career==

Leyland began his baseball career with the Tigers when they signed him as a catcher on September 21, 1963. He spent seven seasons as a minor leaguer in the Tigers organization (1964–1970), but mainly served as a coach with the Montgomery Rebels in 1970 while playing in just two games for the team. Leyland was a career .222 hitter in the minor leagues.
Leyland left the Tigers organization for the first time in 1982 when he became Tony La Russa's third base coach for four seasons (1982–85) with the Chicago White Sox, including the team's 1983 AL West division title, before being named the 33rd manager in Pittsburgh Pirates history on November 20, 1985.

==Pittsburgh Pirates==

Leyland was the manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1986 to 1996. He won two Manager of the Year trophies with the Pirates in 1990 and 1992, and finished as runner-up in 1988 and 1991.  Leyland helped develop such All-Stars as Barry Bonds, Jay Bell, Tim Wakefield, Andy Van Slyke and Bobby Bonilla in Pittsburgh before a fire sale in the mid-1990s soured him with new ownership. Under Leyland, the Pirates went to the National League Championship Series in three straight seasons (1990, 1991, and 1992). The Pirates lost all three of those NLCS, however, with the latter two going the full seven games against the Atlanta Braves. 
Although he has moved on in his career, Leyland still keeps his home in the Pittsburgh suburb of Mt. Lebanon[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04307/405338.stm |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Leyland awaiting Phillies' decision | first=Robert | last=Dvorchak | date=November 2, 2004[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/regionstate/20001002finale1.asp |title=Drama and nostalgia hold the front row seats at stadium exit |publisher=Old.post-gazette.com |date=2000-10-02 |accessdate=2013-07-07[/tpl] where he met his wife Katie http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=I-YhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eGQEAAAAIBAJ&dq=leyland%20introduced%20as%20pirates%20manager&pg=4472%2C241662][http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PN8cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IGQEAAAAIBAJ&dq=leyland%20introduced%20as%20pirates%20manager&pg=3890%2C6431632 and has raised two children, Pat and Kellie.

==Florida Marlins and Colorado Rockies==

In 1997, Leyland was hired by Wayne Huizenga to manage the Florida Marlins and promptly led them to the franchise's first championship. The Marlins, in only their fifth year of existence, became the fastest expansion franchise to win a World Series. The Arizona Diamondbacks surpassed the Marlins when they won the World Series in 2001, their fourth season.
In the offseason, Huizenga dismantled the team in what became known as "the fire sale." After Game 7, when asked about rumors that he might retire if Huizenga sold the franchise, Leyland quipped, "My wife doesn't like me that much. I can't retire."[tpl]cite news | title=Passionate man the last of a breed | date=October 27, 1997 | accessdate=June 26, 2008 | work=Denver Post | first=Mark | last=Kiszla | page=C-01[/tpl] Leyland indeed remained as the manager, but resigned after the [tpl]by|1998[/tpl] season, when the Marlins went 54-108. At his press conference, Leyland remarked that he thought his job was to win championships, but that apparently was not what Huizenga wanted.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl] Leyland was subsequently hired by the Colorado Rockies for the [tpl]by|1999[/tpl] season, walking away from the final two years of his contract.
When he left managing after the 1999 season, he became a Pittsburgh-based scout for the St. Louis Cardinals.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/01/sports/plus-baseball-st-louis-leyland-to-scout.html |title=PLUS: BASEBALL – ST.

==Detroit Tigers==

In 2005, Leyland returned to the franchise with which he spent the first 18 years of his professional baseball career, managing in the AL for the first time. Following the release of Alan Trammell as the manager of the Tigers on October 3, 2005, Leyland was immediately named a top contender to replace him for the 2006 season.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl] "It's well known that I interviewed with Philadelphia last winter, and I'd like to manage again," Leyland said in September 2005. He was announced as the new Tigers manager on October 4, 2005.[tpl]cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2180682 | title=Tigers pounce quickly, hire Leyland to manage | publisher=Associated Press | work=ESPN.com | date=October 4, 2005 | accessdate=October 16, 2013[/tpl]
In the 2006 regular season, Leyland guided the Tigers to a 95–67 record, the Tigers' best season since 1987. The Tigers entered the playoffs as a wild card, and went on to defeat the New York Yankees and sweep the Oakland Athletics to win the American League pennant.  Many people chose the Tigers to win the 2006 World Series[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl], although they ultimately lost to the St. Louis Cardinals. In leading the team to the AL pennant, he became the seventh manager to win pennants in both major leagues, joining Joe McCarthy, Yogi Berra, Alvin Dark, Sparky Anderson, Dick Williams, and Tony La Russa. After the 2006 season ended, Leyland was recognized with the Manager of the Year award for the third time in his career. He became the third person to win the award in both leagues, joining La Russa and Bobby Cox. Leyland also won The Sporting News Manager of the Year Award for the American League in 2006.
On October 2, 2007, the Tigers extended Leyland's contract through the 2009 season. Despite a disappointing 2008 season, Tigers general manager Dave Dombrowski announced on September 24, 2008, that Leyland would be back for the 2009 season.[tpl]cite web|author=By Jason Beck / MLB.com |url=http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071002&content_id=2245507&vkey=news_det&fext=.jsp&c_id=det |title=Tigers sign Leyland through 2009 |publisher=Detroit.tigers.mlb.com |date=September 26, 2011 |accessdate=October 7, 2011[/tpl]

In 2011, Leyland led the Tigers to another 95-67 regular season record, winning the American League Central Division. They went on to defeat the New York Yankees in the American League Division Series before losing to the Texas Rangers in the American League Championship Series. 
On May 1, 2012, Leyland gained his 1,600th victory as a major league manager, passing Tommy Lasorda on the all-time wins list.[tpl]cite web|title=Austin Jackson's 4 hits, Rick Porcello's pitching lead Tigers over Royals|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=320501106|publisher=espn.com|accessdate=3 May 2012[/tpl] In 2012, Leyland led the Tigers to an 88-74 regular season record, winning the American League Central Division.  On that team, Tiger third baseman Miguel Cabrera was the American League Triple Crown winner that season.  This was the first Triple Crown winner in Major League Baseball since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967. When the Tigers won the AL Central for the second consecutive season, Leyland became the only Tigers manager besides Hughie Jennings to lead Detroit to the postseason three times.
In the 2012 postseason, Detroit defeated the Athletics in a five-game ALDS. On October 18, 2012, Leyland led the Detroit Tigers to the World Series in a sweep of the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series. Detroit was swept in the 2012 World Series by the San Francisco Giants. They were shut out twice, the same number as in the entire 162-game regular season, and had a team batting average of .165.
On October 30, 2012, Leyland signed another one-year contract with the Tigers to manage for the 2013 season.[tpl]cite web|title=Tigers bringing back Jim Leyland, coaches for 2013|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20121030/SPORTS02/121030017/detroit-tigers-jim-leyland?odyssey=nav%7Chead|accessdate=October 30, 2012[/tpl]
On September 25, 2013, Leyland won his 700th game with the Tigers. With the 1-0 victory over the Minnesota Twins, the Tigers clinched their third consecutive American League Central Division title.
