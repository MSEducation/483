[[Leucoagaricus leucothites]]

CATEGORIES: Agaricaceae, Fungi of Europe, Fungi described in 1835

Leucoagaricus leucothites, or white Agaricus mushroom, is a fairly uncommon parasol mushroom. It looks more like a normal but almost pure white commercial mushroom albeit more slender and with a  longer stalk. It is distinguished by a smooth, white cap with a gently yellow center, a collar-like ring, white spores, and off-white gills in maturity.  Immature specimens have pure white gills. This is a choice edible, but care must be made to distinguish this from other members of the Lepiota tribe and also the far more deadly members of the Amanita tribe. The deadly white Amanitas have a volva (a sack like appendage surrounding the base of the stem) totally lacking in this species. This is not a mushroom recommended for consumption by those without good knowledge of fungi. This species is slowly extending its range northward, possibly as a result of global warming, and is locally common in Devon especially in Torbay (due to the exceptionally mild micro-climate), and other parts of south-west England. The species was originally described as Agaricus leucothites by Carlo Vittadini in 1835.
