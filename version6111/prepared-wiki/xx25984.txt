Alfalfa [tpl]IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|f|æ|l|f|ə[/tpl], Medicago sativa, also called lucerne, is a perennial flowering plant in the pea family Fabaceae cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world. The Spanish-Arabic (according to wiktionary and the DRAE) name alfalfa is widely used, particularly in North America and Australia. But in the UK,[tpl]cite web|title=Definition of lucerne in English|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/lucerne|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl] South Africa and New Zealand, the more commonly used name is lucerne. It superficially resembles clover, with clusters of small purple flowers followed by fruits spiralled in 2 to 3 turns containing 10-20 seeds. Alfalfa is native to a warmer temperate climate such as that of Iran (where it is thought to have originated). It has been cultivated as livestock fodder since at least the era of the ancient Greeks and Romans.

==Ecology==

Alfalfa is a perennial forage legume which normally lives four to eight years, but can live more than 20 years, depending on variety and climate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/14595/alfalfa |title=alfalfa (plant) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=29 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110607052509/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/14595/alfalfa| archivedate= 7 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The plant grows to a height of up to 1 m (3 ft), and has a deep root system, sometimes stretching more than 15 m (49 ft). This makes it very resilient, especially to droughts. It has a tetraploid genome.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/22014/1/IND23276500.pdf |title=CELL BIOLOGY & MOLECULAR GENETICS |publisher=Ddr.nal.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl]
Alfalfa is a small-seeded crop, and has a slowly growing seedling, but after several months of establishment, forms a tough 'crown' at the top of the root system. This crown contains many shoot buds that enables alfalfa to regrow many times after being grazed or harvested.
This plant exhibits autotoxicity, which means it is difficult for alfalfa seed to grow in existing stands of alfalfa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uwex.edu/ces/forage/wfc/proceedings2001/understanding_autotoxicity_in_alfalfa.htm |title=Understanding Autotoxicity in Alfalfa |publisher=Uwex.edu |accessdate=29 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110614112705/http://www.uwex.edu/ces/forage/wfc/proceedings2001/understanding_autotoxicity_in_alfalfa.htm| archivedate= 14 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Therefore, alfalfa fields are recommended to be rotated with other species (for example, corn or wheat) before reseeding.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kansasruralcenter.org/publications/alfalfa.pdf |title=SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE MANAGEMENT GUIDES |publisher=Kansas Rural Center |date= |accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl]

==Culture==

Alfalfa is widely grown throughout the world as forage for cattle, and is most often harvested as hay, but can also be made into silage, grazed, or fed as greenchop.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.caf.wvu.edu/~forage/library/forglvst/bulletins/salfalfa.pdf |title=Alfalfa in the South |publisher=Caf.wvu.edu |date= |accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl] Alfalfa usually has the highest feeding value of all common hay crops. It is used less frequently as pasture. When grown on soils where it is well-adapted, alfalfa is often the highest-yielding forage plant, but its primary benefit is the combination of high yield per hectare and high nutritional quality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uky.edu/Ag/AnimalSciences/pubs/id97.pdf |title=A |publisher=UKY |date= |accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl]
Its primary use is as feed for high-producing dairy cows, because of its high protein content and highly digestible fiber, and secondarily for beef cattle, horses, sheep, and goats.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uaex.edu/Other_Areas/publications/PDF/FSA-4000.pdf |title=Alfalfa for Dairy Cattle |publisher=Uaex.edu |date= |accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hayusa.net/alfalfa.html |title=HayUSA,INC.

In poultry diets, dehydrated alfalfa and alfalfa leaf concentrates are used for pigmenting eggs and meat, due to their high content in carotenoids, which are efficient for colouring egg yolk and body lipids.[tpl]cite web| last=Heuzé | first=V. | last2=Tran | first2=G. | last3=Boval | first3=M. | last4=Lebas | first4=F. | last5=Lessire | first5=M. | last6=Noblet | first6=J. | last7=Renaudeau | first7=D.| title=Alfalfa (Medicago sativa)| url=http://www.feedipedia.org/node/275 | publisher = Feedipedia.org.

Like other legumes, its root nodules contain bacteria, Sinorhizobium meliloti, with the ability to fix nitrogen, producing a high-protein feed regardless of available nitrogen in the soil.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cmgm.stanford.edu/~mbarnett/genome.htm |title=Sinorhizobium meliloti genome home |publisher=Cmgm.stanford.edu |accessdate=29 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110519030012/http://cmgm.stanford.edu/~mbarnett/genome.htm| archivedate= 19 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Its nitrogen-fixing ability (which increases soil nitrogen) and its use as an animal feed greatly improve agricultural efficiency.[tpl]cite web|url=https://portal.sciencesocieties.org/Downloads/pdf/B40724.pdf |title=Nitrogen Fixation in Crop Production |publisher=portal.sciencesocities.org |date= |accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://alfalfa.ucdavis.edu/-files/pdf/alfalfaFactSheet.pdf |title=Commodity Fact Sheet Alfalfa Information compiled by the California Alfalfa and Forage Association |publisher=Alfalfa.ucdavis.edu |date= |accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl]
