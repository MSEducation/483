The Tanzania Internet eXchange (TIX) is an Internet exchange point in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. It is a project of the Tanzania Internet Service Providers Association.
Established in late 2003, it is housed at Posta Building, Ghana Avenue in Dar es Salaam.
Currently (November 2005) 12 Internet service providers are connected and peering with each other. Internet traffic between them (and their customers) is routed through fast and cheap local links and does not need to cross slow and expensive international satellite circuits.
As of December 2010 aggregate traffic was at 10 Mbit/s.
