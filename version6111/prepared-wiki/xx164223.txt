Also, the benefits and wider implications of genetic research to societies at large are explored.
The Congress has been held in many major cities around the world, such as London, New York, Paris, Ithaca, Edinburgh, Stockholm, Bellagio, Montreal, The Hague, Tokyo, Berkeley, Moscow, New Delhi, Toronto, Birmingham, Beijing, Melbourne, and Berlin.
The last International Congress of Genetics took place in Berlin, Germany in 2008. In 2013, the 21st International Congress of Genetics will be held in Singapore.
