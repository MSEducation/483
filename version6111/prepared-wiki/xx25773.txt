Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels) of the heart's arteries and, hence, angina pectoris. Some people with chest pain have normal or minimal narrowing of heart arteries; in these patients, vasospasm is a more likely cause for the pain, sometimes in the context of Prinzmetal's angina and syndrome X.
Myocardial ischemia also can be the result of factors affecting blood composition, such as reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, as seen with severe anemia (low number of red blood cells), or long-term smoking.

==Pathophysiology==

Angina results when there is an imbalance between the heart's oxygen demand and supply. This imbalance can result from an increase in demand (e.g., during exercise) without a proportional increase in supply (e.g., due to obstruction or atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries).
However, the pathophysiology of angina in females varies significantly as compared to males.[tpl]cite journal|last=Vaccarino|first=V.|title=Ischemic Heart Disease in Women: Many Questions, Few Facts|journal=Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes|date=16 February 2010|volume=3|issue=2|pages=111–115|doi=10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.109.925313|pmid=20160161|pmc=3012351[/tpl] Non-obstructive coronary disease is more common in females.[tpl]cite journal|last=Shaw|first=LJ|coauthors=Merz, CN; Pepine, CJ; Reis, SE; Bittner, V; Kip, KE; Kelsey, SF; Olson, M; Johnson, BD; Mankad, S; Sharaf, BL; Rogers, WJ; Pohost, GM; Sopko, G; Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE), Investigators|title=The economic burden of angina in women with suspected ischemic heart disease: results from the National Institutes of Health--National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute--sponsored Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation|journal=Circulation|date=Aug 29, 2006|volume=114|issue=9|pages=894–904|pmid=16923752|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.609990[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Banks|first=Kamakki|author2=Lo, Monica|author3= Khera, Amit|title=Angina in Women without Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease|journal=Current Cardiology Reviews|date=1 February 2010|volume=6|issue=1|pages=71–81|doi=10.2174/157340310790231608|pmid=21286281|pmc=2845797[/tpl]

==Diagnosis==

Angina should be suspected in people presenting with tight, dull, or heavy chest discomfort that is:NHS Clinical Knowledge Summaries (2009) Angina - stable. http://www.cks.nhs.uk/angina Date site accessed: 04/01/2009
Some people present with atypical symptoms, including breathlessness, nausea, or epigastric discomfort or burping.
These atypical symptoms are particularly likely in older people, women, and those with diabetes.
Anginal pain is not usually sharp or stabbing or influenced by respiration. Antacids and simple analgesia do not usually relieve the pain. If chest discomfort (of whatever site) is precipitated by exertion, relieved by rest, and relieved by glyceryl trinitrate, the likelihood of angina is increased.
In angina patients momentarily not feeling any chest pain, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is typically normal, unless there have been other cardiac problems in the past. During periods of pain, depression, or elevation of the ST segment may be observed. To elicit these changes, an exercise ECG test ("treadmill test") may be performed, during which the patient exercises to his/her maximum ability before fatigue, breathlessness, or pain intervenes; if characteristic ECG changes are documented (typically more than 1 mm of flat or downsloping ST depression), the test is considered diagnostic for angina. Even constant monitoring of the blood pressure and the pulse rate can lead us to some conclusion regarding the angina. The exercise test is also useful in looking for other markers of myocardial ischaemia: blood pressure response (or lack thereof, in particular a drop in systolic pressure), dysrhythmia and chronotropic response. Other alternatives to a standard exercise test include a thallium scintigram or sestamibi scintigram (in patients unable to exercise enough for the purposes of the treadmill tests, e.g., due to asthma or arthritis or in whom the ECG is too abnormal at rest) or Stress Echocardiography.
In patients in whom such noninvasive testing is diagnostic, a coronary angiogram is typically performed to identify the nature of the coronary lesion, and whether this would be a candidate for angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), treatment only with medication, or other treatments. There has been research that concludes that a frequency is attained when there is increase in the blood pressure and the pulse rate. This frequency varies normally but the range is 45–50 kHz for the cardiac arrest or for the heart failure.[tpl]clarify|date=February 2012[/tpl] In patients in hospital with unstable angina (or the newer term of "high-risk acute coronary syndromes"), those with resting ischaemic ECG changes or those with raised cardiac enzymes such as troponin may undergo coronary angiography directly.

==Treatment==

The most specific medicine to treat angina is nitroglycerin.  It is a potent vasodilator that makes more oxygen available to the heart muscle.  Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers act to decrease the heart's workload, and thus its requirement for oxygen.  Nitroglycerin should not be given if certain inhibitors such as Sildenafil (Viagra), Tadalafil (Cialis), or Vardenafil (Levitra) have been taken within the previous 12 hours as the combination of the two could cause a serious drop in blood pressure. Treatments for angina are balloon angioplasty, in which the balloon is inserted at the end of a catheter and inflated to widen the arterial lumen.  Stents to maintain the arterial widening are often used at the same time.  Coronary bypass surgery involves bypassing constricted arteries with venous grafts.  This is much more invasive than angioplasty.
The main goals of treatment in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing progression of the disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death.  Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol) have a large body of evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina.[tpl]cite book |isbn=978-0-471-89980-8 |last1=Sneader |first1=Walter |title=Drug discovery: a history |year=2005[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides pure heart rate reduction[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2006.00817.x |title=Ivabradine - the first selective sinus node if channel inhibitor in the treatment of stable angina |year=2006 |last1=Sulfi |first1=S. |last2=Timmis |first2=A. D. |journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=222–8 |pmid=16451297 |pmc=1448693[/tpl] leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy.  ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]. Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was is part of standard treatment.  However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in haemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.c1805 |title=Don't use aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease |year=2010 |last1=Barnett |first1=H. |last2=Burrill |first2=P. |last3=Iheanacho |first3=I. |journal=BMJ |volume=340 |pages=c1805 |pmid=20410163[/tpl]
Exercise is also a very good long-term treatment for the angina (but only particular regimens - gentle and sustained exercise rather than intense short bursts),[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.88.2.572 |title=Exercise conditioning in older coronary patients.

M. |journal=Circulation |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=572–7 |pmid=8339420[/tpl] probably working by complex mechanisms such as improving blood pressure and promoting coronary artery collateralisation.
Identifying and treating risk factors for further coronary heart disease is a priority in patients with angina. This means testing for elevated cholesterol and other fats in the blood, diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure), and encouraging smoking cessation and weight optimisation.
The calcium channel blocker nifedipine prolongs cardiovascular event- and procedure-free survival in patients with coronary artery disease. New overt heart failures were reduced by 29% compared to placebo; however, the mortality rate difference between the two groups was statistically insignificant.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16980-8 |title=Effect of long-acting nifedipine on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with stable angina requiring treatment (ACTION trial): Randomised controlled trial |year=2004 |last1=Poole-Wilson |first1=Philip A |last2=Lubsen |first2=Jacobus |last3=Kirwan |first3=Bridget-Anne |last4=Van Dalen |first4=Fred J |last5=Wagener |first5=Gilbert |last6=Danchin |first6=Nicolas |last7=Just |first7=Hanjörg |last8=Fox |first8=Keith AA |last9=Pocock |first9=Stuart J |journal=The Lancet |volume=364 |issue=9437 |pages=849–57 |pmid=15351192 |last10=Clayton |first10=Tim C |last11=Motro |first11=Michael |last12=Parker |first12=John D |last13=Bourassa |first13=Martial G |last14=Dart |first14=Anthony M |last15=Hildebrandt |first15=Per |last16=Hjalmarson |first16=Åke |last17=Kragten |first17=Johannes A |last18=Molhoek |first18=G Peter |last19=Otterstad |first19=Jan-Erik |last20=Seabra-Gomes |first20=Ricardo |last21=Soler-Soler |first21=Jordi |last22=Weber |first22=Simon |author23=Coronary disease Trial Investigating Outcome with Nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system investigators[/tpl]

Men with angina were found to have an increased risk of subsequent acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease related death than women. Similar figures apply in the remainder of the Western world. All forms of coronary heart disease are much less-common in the Third World, as its risk factors are much more common in Western and Westernized countries; it could, therefore, be termed a disease of affluence. The adoption of a rich, Westernized diet and subsequent increase of smoking, obesity, and other risk factors has led to an increase in angina and related diseases in countries such as China.

==History==

The concept of Hritshoola—literally heart pain—was known to Sushruta (6th century BCE).  Dwivedi & Dwivedi (2007)—on the condition described by Sushruta—hold that: 'It embodies all the essential components of present day definition, i.e. site, nature, aggravating and relieving factors and referral. According to him angina is chest pain which is precordial, temporary, exertional, emotional, burning like and relieved by rest. He also linked this kind of pain to obesity (medoroga).'[tpl]cite journal |last1=Dwivedi |first1=Girish |last2=Dwivedi |first2=Shridhar |year=2007 |url=http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf |title=Sushruta – the Clinician – Teacher par Excellence |journal=The Indian Journal of Chest Diseases and Allied Sciences |volume=49 |pages=243–4[/tpl]
