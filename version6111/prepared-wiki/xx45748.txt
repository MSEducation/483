Pseudohistory is a pejorative term applied to a type of historical revisionism.  It purports to be history, and uses ostensibly-scholarly methods and techniques (which in fact depart from standard historiographical conventions), but is inconsistent with established facts or with common sense and often involves sensational claims whose acceptance would significantly require rewriting accepted history.  The term may apply to a theory or to a work or works based on that theory. Cryptohistory is a related term, sometimes applied to pseudo-historical publications based on occult notions.
The pejorative nature of the term arises from the implication of ignorance, deliberate misrepresentation, carelessness, gullibility or poor scholarship on the part of the (pseudo)historian.

==Definition and etymology==

The term pseudo-history was coined in the early 19th century, which makes it somewhat older than  pseudo-scholarship, and somewhat younger than  pseudo-science (although New Latin pseudo-historia had been in use since at least the 1650s). It is attested in 1823 as referring to an early example of a historical novel.[ref]
Monthly magazine and British register, Volume 55 (February 1823), p. 449,  in reference to John Galt, Ringan Gilhaize:  Or, The Covenanters, Oliver & Boyd, 1823.http://books.google.com/books?id=7VYJAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false[/ref] Similarly, in an 1815 attestation, it is used to refer to Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi, a fictional contest between two historical poets.C. A. Elton, Remains of Hesiod the Ascraean 1815, p. xix.
The current pejorative sense, referring to a flawed or disingenuous work of historiography, is found in another 1815 attestation.The Critical review: or, Annals of literature, Volume 1 ed. Tobias George Smollett, 1815, p. 152
Pseudohistory can be compared with pseudoscience in that both consist of a methodology, belief, or practice which purports to, but does not, adhere to the established standards of the discipline of which it claims to be a part, and which has limited or no supporting evidence or plausibility.Fritze, Ronald H,. (2009). Invented knowledge: false history, fake science and pseudo-religions. Reaktion Books. pp 7-18. ISBN 978-1-86189-430-4
The definition of pseudohistory can be extended to varying contexts.  Historian Douglas AllchinAllchin, D. 2004. Pseudohistory and pseudoscience Science & Education 13:179-195. contends that history in science education cannot only be false or anecdotal, but misleading ideologically, and that this constitutes pseudohistory.
According to writers Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman, pseudohistory is "the rewriting of the past for present personal or political purposes".Michael Shermer, Alex Grobman. Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?, University of California Press, 2009, ISBN 978-0-520-26098-6, p.2

==Characteristics==

Robert Todd Carroll suggests that a work which is pseudohistoric will meet at least one of the following criteria:
Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke prefers the term "cryptohistory", of which he identifies two necessary elements as: "A complete ignorance of the primary sources" and the repetition of "inaccuracies and wild claims".Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 224,225Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, The Occult Roots of Nazism, page 225 (Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2005 edition).

===Exceptions===

Not all controversial historical theories are pseudohistorical.  Specifically:

===Pseudohistory vs. Revisionism===

Pseudohistory is to be distinguished from historical revisionism.  The latters involves forming testable hypotheses about historical events and evaluating them using reputable scholarly techniques.  For example, it is legitimate to carry out historical research to clarify aspects of the Holocaust, which may lead to revision of our understanding of it.  But promoters of Holocaust denial typically call themselves revisionists, though their underlying hypothesis is contradicted by firm evidence and their purpose is not to enhance understanding but to justify their claims.  Holocaust denial is thus prima facie pseudohistorical.
