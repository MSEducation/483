Eleven of the thirteen awarded songs have also earned the Latin Grammy for Record of the Year, which unlike this category, is given to songs that were released on a promotional level, and the prize is given to the performer, producer and audio engineer. The exceptions to this were in 2000 and 2009, when "Corazón Espinado" by Santana featuring Maná and "No Hay Nadie Como Tú" by Calle 13 featuring Café Tacvba, respectively, received the award without a nomination for Song of the Year.
Alejandro Sanz is the most awarded songwriter in the category with four wins out of eight nominations. Sanz is followed by Juanes with two winning songs, "Es Por Ti" and "Me Enamora". Jorge Luis Piloto and Jorge Villamizar are the only lyricists to be nominated twice in the same year: Piloto in 2009 for songs performed by Andrés Cepeda and Luis Enrique, while Villamizar wrote songs for the band Bacilos. Claudia Brant, Angie Chirino, Joy Huerta (of the Mexican band Jesse & Joy), Shakira, and Mónica Vélez are the only female writers to be awarded. The current holders are  Andrés Castro and Carlos Vives for the song "Volví a Nacer".
