Graeme Dott (born 12 May 1977) is a Scottish professional snooker player from Larkhall. He turned professional in 1994 and first entered the top 16 in 2001. He has won two ranking titles, the 2006 World Snooker Championship and the 2007 China Open, and was runner-up in the World Championships of 2004 and 2010. He reached number 2 in the world rankings in 2007, but a subsequent episode of clinical depression seriously affected his form, causing him to drop to number 28 for the 2009/2010 season. He then recovered his form, regained his top-16 ranking, and reached a third World Championship final. In 2011, he published his autobiography, Frame of Mind: The Autobiography of the World Snooker Champion.

==Career==

===Early career===

After winning the UK Under-19 Championship in 1992 and Scottish Amateur Championship in 1993, Dott turned professional in 1994. He slowly climbed the rankings, reaching the top sixteen in 2001, where he remained until 2009. Early successes included reaching the quarter-final of the 1996 Welsh Open and qualifying for the World Championship for the first time in 1997. Dott was a runner-up in the 1999 Scottish Open, the 2001 British Open, the 2004 World Championship and the 2005 Malta Cup. He scored his only competitive 147 break in the 1999 British Open.

===2006 World Championship victory===

Dott started his campaign with an easy 10–3 victory over former champion John Parrott, before beating veteran Nigel Bond 13–9 in the second round. His quarter-final match was against Australia's Neil Robertson, and after leading 12–8, he was pegged back to 12–12, before edging through the deciding frame, winning the tie 13–12. In the semi-finals he faced former two-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan in a rematch of the 2004 final. At 8–8 after the second session of four sessions, O'Sullivan failed to win a single frame in the third session and Dott dominated play to win easily 17–11.
Dott faced Peter Ebdon in the final for the £200,000 prize. He began the last session of the match leading 15–7, but Ebdon won six successive frames to reduce his deficit to two frames. Dott eventually won by 18 frames to 14,[tpl]cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/4963744.stm| title = Dott breaks duck| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 2007-05-02| accessdate = 2008-04-12| location=London| first=Saj| last=Chowdhury[/tpl] after winning some vital frames with marvellous clearances. It was the longest final ever and was, at the time, the latest to finish (John Higgins's victory over Mark Selby the following year now holds the record). The previous record holder was the classic final frame last black ball finish 1985 final between Englishman Steve Davis and Northern Irishman Dennis Taylor, which finished at 12:19 a.m. (GMT). The Dott-Ebdon match finished half an hour later, this despite featuring three fewer frames, reflecting the slow overall pace of the match. The average frame length was such that both afternoon sessions only had six frames, instead of the usual eight. Moreover, at just over 74 minutes, the 27th frame was the then longest in the history of the World Championship (until 2009), even beating the 70 minute mark of the previous record set by Canadian Cliff Thorburn and Welshman Doug Mountjoy.
The victory over Ebdon took his ranking up to number 6 for 2006/07 season, a career high at the time.

===Post-title career===

Dott shone in the 2006 UK Championship as well, reaching the semi-finals, where he lost 7–9 to Stephen Hendry (who he had never beaten in a ranking tournament)[tpl]cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20061217/ai_n16898685/ | work=Sunday Mirror | title=Snooker: DOTT IN HENDRY HORROR | first=John | last=King | date=2006-12-17[/tpl] after having led 7–5. Dott briefly became the provisional world number one in the rankings system after overcoming Jamie Cope 9–5 to win the 2007 China Open, his second ranking tournament win.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.billiardpulse.com/2007/04/graeme-dott-takes-home-china-open.html| title = Graeme Dott claims China Open trophy| publisher = Billiard Pulse| date = 2007-04-02| accessdate = 2011-04-03[/tpl] Prior to this, he disliked going to China, not helped by a disastrous match in 2002.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/an-email-coversation-with-graeme-dott-we-need-an-abramovich-to-take-the-game-to-a-new-level-432207.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=An email coversation with Graeme Dott: 'We need an Abramovich to take the game to a new level' | first=Nick | last=Harris | date=2007-01-15 | accessdate=2010-05-04[/tpl] However, going into the 2007 World Championship as defending champion, he suffered a shock 7–10 defeat in the first round to Ian McCulloch[tpl]cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/6579661.stm| title = Champion Dott suffers shock exit | publisher = BBC Sport| date = 2007-04-21| accessdate = 2008-04-12| location=London[/tpl] in the opening match of the tournament, which dented his prospects of remaining no. 1. Newly crowned world champion John Higgins overtook him. The loss against McCulloch also maintained the "Crucible Curse", as Dott became the seventeenth consecutive first-time champion to lose his title the very next year.
The 2007/2008 season was more of a struggle for Dott,[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/2008/02/05/graeme-dott-looks-for-success-in-malta-cup-86908-20310149/| title = Graeme Dott Looks For Success In Malta Cup | publisher = Daily Record| date = 2008-02-05| accessdate = 2011-04-03[/tpl] who described his late-2007 form as "hopeless... nowhere near to playing a good enough standard".[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/sports-latest/2008/02/07/graeme-dott-i-m-hopeless-86908-20311737/| title = Graeme Dott: "I'm Hopeless" | publisher = Daily Record| date = 2008-02-07| accessdate = 2011-04-03[/tpl] His season started promisingly, as he reached the semi-finals of the season-opening 2007 Shanghai Masters, where he defeated Michael Holt 5–4, tournament favourite Ding Junhui 5–1 and Stephen Lee 5–4 before losing his semi-final against Ryan Day 2–6, to close the gap on World #1 John Higgins, who went out in the second round; however, Dott then won no further matches that season; a run of 12 consecutive defeats, including all 5 group matches in the 2007 Grand Prix, started from October 2007 onwards. In the 2007 UK Championship he was eliminated in the first round, 7–9, by unseeded Dave Harold, while in the Masters he lost 5–6 to eventual runner-up Stephen Lee for the third successive year.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/sports-latest/2008/01/17/higgins-and-dott-crash-out-86908-20288705/| title = Higgins And Dott Crash Out | publisher = Daily Record| date = 2008-01-17| accessdate = 2011-04-03[/tpl] Another first-round elimination followed in the 2008 Malta Cup, this time to Mark Williams. In the 2008 Welsh Open he lost his opening match against Michael Judge 4–5. In frame 7, when leading 4–2, he missed the pack completely with his break-off after miscuing, and also failed to hit the bunch on his next shot after being snookered. Dott announced that he could miss out on the 2008 World Championship, due to personal reasons, and according to his manager he had been suffering from depression.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] However, Dott did eventually participate in the tournament, but was eliminated in the first round for the second year in a row, losing 7–10 to Joe Perry,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article3803591.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Graeme Dott sees positive signs in defeat No 16 | first=Phil | last=Yates | date=2008-04-24 | accessdate=2010-05-04[/tpl] subsequently sliding to #13 in the new world rankings, and finishing the season outside the top 32 in the one-year rankings.
Things did not improve in the early part of 2008/2009, when a broken left arm sustained while playing football forced him to pull out of the 2008 Shanghai Masters[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.thenational.ae/sport/big-guns-bite-the-dust-as-dott-breaks-arm-playing-football | title = Big guns bite the dust as Dott breaks arm playing football | publisher = The National beta | date = 2008-10-01| accessdate = 2011-04-03[/tpl] and 2008 Grand Prix.
Dott did win the Berlin leg of the World Series of Snooker,[tpl]cite web|title=Hunger inspired Graeme Dott's World Series win |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/snooker/2008/07/15/hunger-inspired-graeme-dott-s-world-series-win-86908-20644211/|publisher=Daily Record|date=2008-07-15[/tpl] but withdrew from the Moscow event two days before it began, due to his wife preparing to give birth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://snookerscene.blogspot.com/2008/11/new-dad-dott-non-starter-in-moscow.html|title=New dad Dott a non-starter in Moscow |publisher=Snooker Scene Blog|date=2008-11-08|accessdate=2011-04-03[/tpl] He reached the second round of the 2009 World Championship for the first time since winning the title in 2006, but lost to Mark Selby 10–13, dropping him out of the top 16.
In the 2010 World Championship Dott produced an unlikely run to his third World final in six years. Dott had not had much success in the 2009/2010 season going into the World Championship, with only one ranking last 16 finish, in the 2010 Welsh Open; however, a newly inspired Dott convincingly knocked out Peter Ebdon in the first round 10–5. He then thrashed fellow Scot Stephen Maguire 13–6 in the second round and for the first time since winning the title in 2006 advanced to the quarter-finals where he recovered from 10–12 behind to see off Mark Allen 13–12. In his 17–14 defeat of Mark Selby in the semi-final he scored the second 146 clearance in the 83-year history of the World Championship (Mark Allen had hit the first days earlier in his match with Dott). Dott was eventually defeated in the final 13–18 by Neil Robertson, who had never beaten Dott previously – ironically after Dott had defeated Ebdon for the first time in winning his own title in 2006. Despite having to settle for runner-up spot, Dott's efforts were ultimately rewarded with a return to the Top 16 for 2010/2011.[tpl]cite news|first=Clive|last=Everton|authorlink=Clive Everton|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/may/04/neil-robertson-world-championship-graeme-dott|title=Neil Robertson grinds down Graeme Dott to take world crown|date=2010-05-04|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|accessdate=2010-05-04 | location=London[/tpl]

===2011/2012 season===

Dott missed the first ranking event of the 2011/2012 season, the Australian Goldfields Open due a neck injury.[tpl]cite web|title=Dott Withdraws From Australia Event|url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/page/NewsArticles/0,,13165~2390261,00.html|work=worldsnooker.com|publisher=World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association|accessdate=11 July 2011[/tpl] He took part in the remaining seven ranking tournaments, being knocked out in the first round in the Shanghai Masters and Welsh Open and losing in the last 16 of the UK Championship, German Masters and the China Open. Dott's best run of the season came at the World Open, where he beat Barry Hawkins and Marcus Campbell, before losing 1–5 to Stephen Lee in the quarter-finals.[tpl]cite web | url=http://snooker.org/res/index.asp?player=52&season=2011 | title=Graeme Dott 2011/2012 | publisher=Snooker.org | accessdate=23 May 2012[/tpl] He also reached the quarter-finals of the Masters, but was defeated by John Higgins 3–6.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/snooker/2012/01/20/masters-snooker-john-higgins-defeats-graeme-dott-to-book-semi-final-place-86908-23708908/ | title=Masters snooker: John Higgins defeats Graeme Dott to book semi-final place | publisher=Daily Record | date=20 January 2012 | accessdate=23 May 2012[/tpl]
Dott lost 2–4 to Ben Woollaston in the final of Event 3 of the minor-ranking Players Tour Championship, after earlier overcoming Ronnie O'Sullivan, Stephen Hendry and John Higgins.[tpl]cite web|title=Players Tour Championship 3 Round 4 to Final|url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/staticFiles/18/83/0,,13165~164632,00.pdf|work=worldsnooker.com|publisher=World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association|accessdate=23 May 2012[/tpl] He also reached three semi-finals, having played in 11 of the 12 events throughout the season. Those results meant that Dott finished 7th on the PTC Order of Merit and therefore qualified to the last 16 of the Finals, where he lost 2–4 to Joe Perry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://snooker.org/res/index.asp?template=10&season=2011|title=Order of Merit|publisher=Snooker.org|date=8 January 2012|accessdate=23 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Betfair Players Tour Championship Grand Finals (2012)|url=http://snooker.org/res/index.asp?event=103|publisher=Snooker.org|accessdate=23 May 2012[/tpl]
Dott played in the first ever professional snooker tournament to be staged in South America, the non-ranking Brazil Masters, and reached the final only to be whitewashed 0–5 by Shaun Murphy.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-2039042/Shaun-Murphy-beats-Graeme-Dott-claim-inaugural-Brazil-Masters-title.html | title=Marvellous Murphy destroys Dott to claim inaugural Brazil Masters title | publisher=Daily Mail | date=19 September 2011 | accessdate=30 April 2012 | location=London[/tpl] He also lost in the final of the Snooker Shoot-Out to Barry Hawkins, in a tournament where the winner of each round is decided by a 10 minute frame.[tpl]cite web | url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/29012012/58/hawkins-wins-snooker-shoot.html | title=Hawkins wins Snooker Shoot-Out | publisher=Eurosport | date=29 January 2012 | accessdate=30 April 2012[/tpl]
Dott's season came to an unceremonious end at the World Championship as he suffered his heaviest ever defeat at the event. He lost to Joe Perry 1–10, stating after the match that it was the worst he had played as a professional.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/snooker/2012/04/25/snooker-world-championship-graeme-dott-thrashed-10-1-by-joe-perry-86908-23837049/ | title=Snooker World Championship: Graeme Dott thrashed 10-1 by Joe Perry | publisher=Daily Record | accessdate=23 May 2012[/tpl] Nevertheless, he maintained his place in the elite top 16 by finishing the season ranked world number 13.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/staticFiles/1d/b0/0,,13165~176157,00.pdf | title=Official World Ranking List for the 2012/2013 Season | accessdate=23 May 2012[/tpl]

===2012/2013 season===

During the 2012/2013 season, Dott lost in the last 16 of the UK Championship (2–6 to Shaun Murphy), the German Masters (4–5 to Murphy), the Welsh Open (1–4 to Pankaj Advani), the World Open (0–5 to Neil Robertson), and the China Open (4–5 to Marcus Campbell). He reached the quarter-finals of the Wuxi Classic, where he lost 0–5 to Mark Davis, and the Shanghai Masters, where he lost 4–5 to Judd Trump.[tpl]cite web | url=http://snooker.org/res/index.asp?player=52&season=2012 | title=Graeme Dott 2012/2013 | publisher=Snooker.org | accessdate=10 May 2013[/tpl]
Dott's best performance of the season came in the 2013 Masters, where he defeated Stephen Maguire 6–5 and Trump 6–1 to reach the semi-finals. Despite taking a 4–1 lead in his semi-final match, Dott lost 5–6 to eventual tournament winner Mark Selby.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-2265229/Mark-Selby-beats-Graeme-Dott-reach-Masters-final.html | title=No 1 Selby secures Masters final place after overturning 4-1 deficit against Dott | publisher=Daily Mail | accessdate=10 May 2013 | location=London | first=William | last=Griffiths | date=2013-01-20[/tpl]
At the World Championship, Dott defeated Peter Ebdon 10–6 in a first-round match that lasted 7 hours 18 minutes, with an extra session added after the players failed to complete the match in the time allotted for the first two sessions. After the match, Dott criticised Ebdon's slow, deliberative style of play and called for a rule to limit the amount of time a player could spend over a shot.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/snooker/22268829 | title=World Snooker Championship 2013: Dott wants rule change | publisher=BBC Sport | date=22 April 2013 | accessdate=26 April 2013[/tpl]  Dott became the only Scottish player to reach the second round, after John Higgins, Stephen Maguire, Marcus Campbell, and Alan McManus all suffered first-round defeats. Facing Shaun Murphy in his second-round match, he trailed 2-6 after the first session. During the second session, he complained about receiving static shocks when he touched the table, and the players took their mid-session interval a frame early while the carpet was sprayed with water to address the problem.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/apr/26/graeme-dott-static-shock-crucible | title=Graeme Dott suffers static shocks in electrifying Crucible clash | publisher=The Guardian | date=26 April 2013 | accessdate=26 April 2013 | location=London[/tpl] Dott managed to level the match at 8–8 after the second session, but went on to lose 11–13.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/snooker/22307688 | title=World Snooker Championship 2013: Murphy into last eight | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=26 April 2013[/tpl] His defeat meant that, for the first time since 1988, no Scottish player competed in the World Championship quarter-finals.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/snooker/22321415 | title=World Snooker Championship 2013: Scots earn unwanted statistic | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=30 April 2013[/tpl]

===2013/2014 season===

Dott's 2013/2014 season did not get off to a good start, as he was whitewashed 0–5 by Jimmy Robertson in the last 64 of the season's first major ranking event, the 2013 Wuxi Classic.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hastingsobserver.co.uk/sport/jimmy-thrashes-ex-world-champ-1-5199379 | title=Jimmy thrashes ex-world champ | publisher=Hastings Observer | accessdate=18 June 2013[/tpl] More disappointing results followed, including losing 2–4 to Ratchayothin Yotharuck in the last 128 of the 2013 Indian Open, but Dott recovered to reach the semi-finals of the 2013 International Championship, where he lost 7–9 to eventual tournament winner Ding Junhui. He reached the last 16 of the 2013 UK Championship but lost 2–6 to Mark Selby.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cuetracker.net/pages/players.php?ID=27&season=2013/2014 | title=Graeme Dott - Season 2013/2014 | publisher=CueTracker | accessdate=10 January 2013[/tpl]On the 15th April 2014 he lost the qualification for the 2014 World Snooker Championship from Kyren Wilson 10-7 and will not play in it.

==Personal life==

In his 2011 autobiography Frame of Mind, Dott describes his childhood growing up in the run-down Easterhouse estate in Glasgow.[tpl]cite book |last=Dott |first=Graeme |authorlink= |title=Frame of Mind: The Autobiography of the World Snooker Champion |year=2011 |publisher=John Blake Publishing |location= |isbn=978-1843583462[/tpl] As a boy, he developed a strong relationship with Alex Lambie, a snooker club owner from Larkhall in Lanarkshire, who mentored Dott from the age of 12 and went on to manage his professional career. Dott has described Lambie as a "second father" to him.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/graeme-dott-ready-to-take-on-the-world-again-2268975.html | work=The Independent | title=Graeme Dott: Ready to take on the world again | first=Derek | last=Clements | date=17 April 2011 | location=London[/tpl] In 1997, Dott began a relationship with Lambie's 16-year-old daughter Elaine.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/wife-of-snooker-champion-graeme-dott-1058915 | work=The Daily Record | title=Wife of snooker champion Graeme Dott reveals the heartache behind his battle against depression | first=Annie | last=Brown | date=14 May 2010[/tpl] The couple married in 2003 and had their first child, a son named Lewis, in 2004.
In January 2006, Alex Lambie was diagnosed with terminal kidney cancer. Although he lived to see Dott win the World Championship in May of that year, he passed away on 16 December 2006, while Dott was playing in the 2006 UK Championship. Weeks afterward, Elaine, who was pregnant, had a cancer scare when doctors discovered potentially cancerous cysts on her ovaries. Although she turned out not to have cancer, she suffered a miscarriage while Dott was playing in the 2007 Masters.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/snooker/2007/04/19/dott-i-won-title-then-had-worst-year-of-my-life-86908-18925935/| title = Dott: I won title... and had worst year of my life | publisher = Daily Record| date = 2007-04-19| accessdate = 2011-04-03[/tpl] After these experiences, Dott entered a severe depression, which affected his commitment to practice and his performance in matches. He lost 15 professional matches in a row and slid down the rankings, dropping out of the top 16. Medication subsequently helped him recover his place in the top 16, although he expects his battle with depression to be lifelong. Dott and his wife had a second child, a daughter Lucy, born in November 2008.
