Altrincham ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-Altrincham.ogg|ˈ|ɒ|l|t|r|ɪ|ŋ|əm[/tpl] [tpl]respell|OL|tring-əm[/tpl]) is a market town within the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, in Greater Manchester, England. It lies south of the River Mersey about [tpl]convert|8|mi|km[/tpl] southwest of Manchester city centre, [tpl]convert|3|mi|km|0[/tpl] south-southwest of Sale and [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] east of Warrington. As of the 2001 UK census, it had a population of about 41,000.
Historically a part of Cheshire, Altrincham was established as a market town in 1290, a time when most communities were based around agriculture rather than trade, and there is still a market in the town today. Further socioeconomic development came with the extension of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 and the arrival of the railway in 1849, stimulating industrial activity in the town. Outlying villages were absorbed by Altrincham's subsequent growth, along with the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall, formerly the home of the Earl of Stamford, and now a tourist attraction with three Grade I listed buildings and a deer park.
Altrincham today is an affluent commuter town, partly because of its transport links. The town has a strong middle class presence; there has been a steady increase in Altrincham's middle classes since the 19th century. It is also home to Altrincham F.C. and two ice hockey clubs, Manchester Phoenix and Trafford Metros.

==History==

Local evidence of prehistoric human activity exists in the form of two Neolithic arrowheads found in Altrincham, and further afield, a concentration of artefacts around Dunham.Nevell (1997), p. 15. The remains of a Roman road, part of one of the major Roman roads in North West England connecting the legionary fortresses of Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum), run through the Broadheath area. As it shows signs of having been repaired, the road was in use for a considerable period of time.Nevell (1997), p. 18. The name Altrincham first appears as "Aldringeham", probably meaning "homestead of Aldhere's people".Dore (1972), p. 12. As recently as the 19th century it was spelt both Altrincham and Altringham.Nickson (1935), pp. 3–4.
Until the Normans invaded England, the manors surrounding Altrincham were owned by the Saxon thegn Alweard; after the invasion they became the property of Hamon de Massey,Nevell (1997), p. 27. though Altrincham is not mentioned in the Domesday Book. The earliest documented reference to the town is from 1290,Nevell (1997), p. 32. when it was granted its charter as a Free Borough by Baron Hamon de Massey V.Nevell (1997), pp. 39, 52. The charter allowed a weekly market to be held, and it is possible that de Massey established the town to generate income through taxes on trade and tolls. This suggests that Altrincham may have been a planned market town, unusual during the Middle Ages, when most communities were agricultural.Nevell (1997), p. 51. Altrincham was probably chosen as the site of the planned town rather than Dunham – which would have been protected by Dunham Castle – because its good access to roads was important for trade.Bayliss (1992), p. 18.
Altrincham Fair became St James's Fair or Samjam in 1319 and continued until 1895. Fair days had their own court of Pye Powder (a corruption of the French for "dusty feet"), presided over by the mayor and held to settle disputes arising from the day's dealings.[tpl]cite web |url= http://althistsoc.users.btopenworld.com/history.html |title=Altrincham History |publisher=Altrincham History Society | accessdate = 24 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] By 1348 the town had 120 burgage plots – ownership of land used as a measure of status and importance in an area – putting it on a par with the Cheshire town of Macclesfield and above Stockport and Knutsford.Nevell (1997), p. 52. The earliest known residence in Altrincham was The Knoll, on Stamford Street near the centre of the medieval town. An 1983 excavation on the demolished building, made by South Trafford Archaeological Group, discovered evidence that the house dated from the 13th or 14th century, and that it may have contained a drying kiln or malting floor.[tpl]cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/bryan.burtonbj/The%20Knoll%20Altrincham.htm |last=Faulkner |first=P |title=The Knoll, Altrincham |publisher=South Trafford Archaeological Group |year=2005 | accessdate = 11 September 2007[/tpl] During the English Civil War, men from Altrincham fought for the Parliamentarian Sir George Booth. During the war, armies camped on nearby Bowdon Downs on several occasions.
In 1754, a stretch of road south of Altrincham, along the Manchester to Chester route, was turnpiked. Turnpikes were toll roads which taxed passengers for the maintenance of the road. Further sections were turnpiked in 1765 from Timperley to Sale, and 1821 from Altrincham to Stockport. The maintenance of roads passed to local authorities in 1888, although by then most turnpike trusts had already declined.Nevell (1997), pp. 95–97. The connection of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 stimulated the development of market gardening, and for many years Altrincham was noted for its vegetables.McNeil & Nevell (2000), p. 61. By 1767, warehouses had been built alongside the canal at Broadheath, the first step in the development of Broadheath as an industrial area and the beginning of Altrincham's industrialisation. The canal was connected in 1776 to the River Mersey, providing the town not only with a water route to Manchester, but also to the Irish Sea.Nevell (1997), p. 92.
Moves to connect the town to the UK's railway network gained pace in 1845, when the Act of Parliament for the construction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJAR) was passed. The first train left Altrincham early on 20 July 1849, carrying 65 passengers. The MSJAR had two stations in the town: Altrincham, on Stockport Road, and Bowdon – though not actually in Bowdon – on Lloyd Street/Railway Street. Both were replaced in 1881 by Altrincham & Bowdon station on Stamford New Road. The London and North Western Railway's station at Broadheath, on the town's northern edge, was opened in 1854, while a further connection was created on 12 May 1862 by the Cheshire Midland Railway (later the Cheshire Lines Committee), who opened their line from Altrincham to Knutsford.Dixon (1994)
With its new railway links, Altrincham and the surrounding areas became desirable places for the middle classes and commuters to live.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_SOC&data_cube=N_SOC_redist&u_id=10106709&c_id=10001043&add=Y |author= |title=Altrincham social class |publisher=Vision of Britain | accessdate = 20 December 2007[/tpl] Professionals and industrialists moved to the town, commuting into Manchester. While some travelled daily by coach, the less well–to–do commuted by express or "flyer" barges from Broadheath.Bamford (1995) Between 1851 and 1881 the population increased from 4,488 to 11,250.Nevell (1997), p. 87. Broadheath's industrial area, covering about [tpl]convert|250|acre|km2[/tpl], was founded in 1885 by Harry Grey, 8th Earl of Stamford, to attract businesses. By 1900 Broadheath had its own docks, warehouses and electricity generating station. The site's proximity to rail, canal and road links proved attractive to companies making machine tools, cameras and grinding machines. The presence of companies like Tilghmans Sand Blast, and the Linotype and Machinery Company, established Broadheath as an industrial area of national standing. By 1914, 14 companies operated in Broadheath, employing thousands of workers. One of those was the Budenberg Gauge Company. Linotype also created 172 workers' homes near its factory, helping cater for the population boom created by Broadheath's industrialisation. Between 1891 and 1901 the population of Altrincham increased by 35 per cent, from 12,440 to 16,831.Nevell (1997), pp. 126–130.
From the turn of the 20th century to the start of the Second World War, there were few changes in Altrincham. Although the town was witness to some of the Luftwaffe's raids on the Manchester area, it emerged from the war relatively unscathed, and as with the rest of Britain, experienced an economic boom. This manifested itself in the construction of new housing and the 1960s rebuilding of the town centre. However, during the 1970s employment at Broadheath declined by nearly 40 per cent.Bamford (1991), pp. 78, 85.

==Governance==

Altrincham became a Free Borough, a self-governing township, when it was granted a charter in June 1290 by the Lord of the Manor, Hamon de Massey V. The charter allowed for the creation of a merchants' guild, run by the town's burgesses to tax people passing through the borough.Nickson (1935), p. 9. Burgesses were free men who lived in the town.Bayliss (1992), p. 14. The borough was ruled by a Court Leet and elected a mayor since at least 1452. Amongst the court's responsibilities were keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs.Nickson (1935), pp. 11–13.
The borough was not one of those reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, and continued to exist under the control of the Lord of the Manor and the Court Leet until its final abolition in 1886.Municipal Corporations Act 1883 (C.18) The Public Health Act of 1848 led to the creation of Altrincham's Local Board of Health in 1851 to address the unsanitary conditions created by the town's growing population – the first such board in Trafford.Nevell (1997), p. 95.
The local board was reconstituted as an urban district council in the administrative county of Cheshire under the Local Government Act 1894. Altrincham Urban District was expanded in 1920 when parts of Carrington and Dunham Massey Civil Parishes were added. A further expansion took place in 1936; Timperley Civil Parish was abolished and most of its area incorporated into Altrincham UD. At the same time, there was a minor exchange of areas with Hale Urban District; a minor addition from Bowdon Urban District; and a further substantial portion of Dunham Massey Civil Parish was added.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10041314 |title=Relationships and changes: Altrincham Ch/CP |publisher=Vision of Britain |accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl] In 1937 the urban district was granted a charter of incorporation and became a municipal borough.[tpl]cite news |title=A New Borough.

Trafford Council is responsible for the administration of local services, such as education, social services, town planning, waste collection and council housing. The area is divided into seven electoral wards: Altrincham, Bowdon, Broadheath, Hale Barns, Hale Central, Timperley, and Village. These wards have 21 out of the 63 seats on the Trafford Council; as of the 2012 local elections sixteen of these seats were held by the Conservative Party, four by the Liberal Democrats, and one by the Labour Party.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/content/elections/resultssummary.asp?year=2010 |title=Local election results 2010 |publisher=Trafford MBC |date=6 May 2010 | accessdate = 22 March 2012[/tpl] •[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/content/elections/resultssummary.asp?year=2011 |title=Local election results 2011 |publisher=Trafford MBC |date=5 May 2011 | accessdate = 22 March 2012[/tpl] •[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/content/elections/resultssummary.asp?year=2012 |title=Local election results 2012 |publisher=Trafford MBC |date=3 May 2008 | accessdate = 8 May 2012[/tpl] Altrincham was in the eponymous parliamentary constituency which was created in 1885. This lasted until 1945 when it was replaced by Altrincham and Sale. In 1997, this in turn became part of the newly created constituency of Altrincham and Sale West. Since its formation, Altrincham and Sale West has been represented in the House of Commons by the Conservative MP, Graham Brady.[tpl]cite news |title=Altrincham and Sale West |work=Guardian Unlimited |publisher=guardian.co.uk |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/constituency/671/altrincham-and-sale-west | accessdate = 14 March 2012[/tpl] This is one of only two Conservative seats in Greater Manchester.

==Geography==

At [tpl]coord|53|23|2|N|2|21|17|W|type:city[/tpl] (53.3838, −2.3547), Altrincham is on the southwestern edge of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, immediately south of the town of Sale, and [tpl]convert|8|mi|km|0[/tpl] southwest of Manchester city centre. It lies in the northwest corner of the Cheshire Plain, just south of the River Mersey. The Bridgewater Canal passes through the Broadheath area of the town. Altrincham's drinking water is supplied by United Utilities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unitedutilities.com/Trafford.aspx |title=Trafford |publisher=United Utilities | accessdate = 13 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl] The local bedrock consists mainly of Keuper Waterstone, a type of sandstone, and water retrieved from those rocks is very hard and often saline, making it undrinkable.Taylor, Price, & Trotter (1963), p. 58. The town's climate is generally temperate, with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean temperature is slightly above average for the United Kingdom; whereas both annual rainfall and average hours of sunshine are slightly below the average for the UK.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/areal/uk.html |author=Met Office |title=Annual UK weather averages |publisher=Met Office |year=2007 | accessdate =23 April 2007[/tpl]
Along with Sale, Stretford and Urmston, Altrincham is one of the four major urban areas in Trafford. The Altrincham area, as defined by Trafford Council, comprises the south of Trafford. In addition to the town of Altrincham, it includes the villages of Timperley, Bowdon, Hale and Hale Barns. The Broadheath area of the town was a light industrial centre until the 1970s and is now a retail park. The most densely populated part of the town is around the town centre, with the less populated areas and more green space further from the centre of town in villages such as Bowdon and Hale. The Oldfield Brow area lies on the outskirts of the town beside the Bridgewater Canal and close to Dunham Massey.[tpl]cite web |title=Timperley ward population density |publisher=Office for National Statistics |url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=5941508&c=Timperley&d=14&e=16&g=356629&i=1001x1003x1004&o=56&m=0&enc=1&dsFamilyId=789 | accessdate = 24 July 2007[/tpl] •[tpl]cite web |title=Altrincham ward population density |publisher=Office for National Statistics |url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=5941526&c=Altrincham&d=14&e=16&g=356022&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&enc=1&dsFamilyId=789 | accessdate = 24 July 2007[/tpl] •[tpl]cite web |title=Bowdon ward population density |publisher=Office for National Statistics |url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=5941525&c=Bowdon&d=14&e=16&g=356062&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&enc=1&dsFamilyId=789 | accessdate = 24 July 2007[/tpl] •[tpl]cite web |title=Broadheath ward population density |publisher=Office for National Statistics |url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=5941524&c=Broadheath&d=14&e=16&g=356100&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&enc=1&dsFamilyId=789 | accessdate = 24 July 2007[/tpl] •[tpl]cite web |title=Hale ward population density |publisher=Office for National Statistics |url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=5941517&c=Hale&d=14&e=16&g=356322&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&enc=1&dsFamilyId=789 | accessdate = 24 July 2007[/tpl] •[tpl]cite web |title=Village ward population density |publisher=Office for National Statistics |url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=5941506&c=Village&d=14&e=16&g=356699&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&enc=1&dsFamilyId=789 | accessdate = 24 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Bowdon ward profile |publisher=Trafford MBC |url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/dynamic/DocMan2Document.asp?document_id=A7B83889-E107-4DD9-B583-A399CB3C00EF | accessdate = 24 July 2007[/tpl] •[tpl]cite web |title=Hale Central ward profile |publisher=Trafford MBC |url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/dynamic/DocMan2Document.asp?document_id=063A1FEE-82E9-4B7D-B725-E0B6DEC381B7 | accessdate = 24 July 2007[/tpl] •[tpl]cite web |title=Hale Barns ward profile |publisher=Trafford MBC |url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/dynamic/DocMan2Document.asp?document_id=95CF5831-2634-4AB6-8E8F-8BA6047B6B62 | accessdate = 24 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]-[/tpl]

==Demography==

As of the 2001 UK census, the town of Altrincham had a total population of 40,695. Of its 27,900 households, 38.7 per cent were married couples living together. 30.4 per cent contained one person, 8.2 per cent co-habiting couples and 9.0 per cent lone parents.[tpl]cite web |title=Census 2001 Key Statistics – Urban area results by population size of urban area |publisher=Office for National Statistics |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-211152 |date=22 July 2004|work=ons.gov.uk|at=KS20 Household composition [tpl]XLSlink[/tpl]|accessdate=5 August 2008[/tpl]
The town's population density is [tpl]convert|10272|PD/sqmi|0[/tpl], with 94.8 males for every 100 females.[tpl]cite web |title=Census 2001 Key Statistics – Urban area results by population size of urban area |publisher=Office for National Statistics |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-211152 |date=22 July 2004|work=ons.gov.uk|at=KS01 Usual resident population [tpl]XLSlink[/tpl]|accessdate=30 December 2008[/tpl] Of those aged 16 to 74, 21.7 per cent had no academic qualifications, similar to the 21.3 per cent in all of Trafford, but lower than the 28.9 per cent in England.[tpl]cite web |title=Census 2001 Key Statistics – Urban area results by population size of urban area |publisher=Office for National Statistics |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-211152|date=22 July 2004|work=ons.gov.uk|at=KS13 Qualifications and students [tpl]XLSlink[/tpl]|accessdate=30 December 2008[/tpl] At 4.6 per cent, Altrincham has a low proportion of non-white people. Asians are the area's largest ethnic minority, at 1.3 per cent of the population.
In 1931, 14.6 per cent of Altrincham's population was middle class, slightly higher than the figure for England and Wales, which was 14 per cent. By 1971 this gap had increased to 28.8 per cent compared to 24 per cent nationally, while the town's working class population had declined, from 30.3 per cent in 1931 (36 per cent in England and Wales) to 18.6 per cent (26 per cent nationwide). The remainder comprised clerical and skilled manual workers. This change in social structure was similar to that seen across the nation – although biased towards the middle classes – making Altrincham the middle-class town it is today.

===Population change===

According the hearth tax returns from 1664, the township of Altrincham had a population of about 636, making it the largest of the local settlements;Nevell (1997), p. 59. this had increased to 1,692 in 1801. In the first half of the 19th century, the town's population increase by 165 per cent, higher than 89 per cent across England and 98 per cent in the Trafford area. The growth of the settlement was a result of the Industrial Revolution, and although Altrincham was one of the fastest growing townships in the Trafford area, but paled in comparison to new industrial areas such as Ashton-under-Lyne, Hyde, and Manchester. In the second half of the 19th century, Altrincham's population grew by 275 per cent, higher than the 235 per cent for Trafford and 69 per cent nationally in the same period. This was due to the late industrialisation of the area and the introduction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway in 1849.Nevell (1997), pp. 85–86. The table below details the population change since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census.

==Economy==

Historically, Altrincham was a market town and the two main areas of employment were agriculture and market trade. Although the town went into decline in the 15th century, it recovered and the annual fairs lasted until the mid-19th century and the market still continues.Bayliss (1992), p. 141. During the Industrial Revolution, Altrincham grew as an industrial town, particularly the Broadheath area, which was developed into an industrial estate. In 1801 there were four cotton mills in Altrincham, part of its textile industry, although they had closed by the 1851 census. The decline of the textile industry in Altrincham mirrored the decline of the industry in the Trafford area as a result of a lack of investment and the development of more established industrial areas such as Manchester, Ashton-under-Lyne, and Oldham.Nevell (1997), p. 86. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, heavier industries moved into Broadheath, providing local employment. The area steadily declined during the second half of the 20th century, with employment at Broadheath falling from 8,000 to 5,000 between 1960 and 1970.Nevell (1997), pp. 15, 18, 39, 87, 95, 100, 126–30. Despite the presence of retailers such as Tesco, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer in the town, and redevelopment schemes costing over £100 million,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.messengernewspapers.co.uk/homes/archive/2006/11/27/Latest+news+%28trafford_news%29/1043706.The_face_of_Altrincham_s_future/ |first=Lynsey|last=Roberts |title=The face of Altrincham's future |publisher=messengernewspapers.co.uk |date=27 November 2006 | accessdate = 14 March 2012[/tpl] Altrincham's 15.5 per cent level of employment in retail is below the national average of 16.9 per cent. Altrincham, with its neighbours Bowdon and Hale, is said to constitute a "stockbroker belt", with well-appointed dwellings in an area of sylvan opulence.Frangopulo (1977), p. 224.
The historic market town developed as a residential area in the 19th century although it retains its retail heritage in the Old Market Place (a conservation area) and a new pedestrianised shopping centre. The retail districts of the town have more recently fallen victim to decline due to competition from the nearby Trafford Centre and a regenerated Manchester city centre.[tpl]cite web |title=Altrincham |publisher=The Sale and Altrincham Pages |url=http://www.luso.u-net.com/altrinch.htm |date=24 January 2007 | accessdate = 19 July 2007[/tpl] •[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.messengernewspapers.co.uk/archive/1999/08/20/Trafford+Archive/7232179.Recipe_for_disaster___restaurant_owners_slams_town_decline/ |title=Recipe for disaster – restaurant owners slams town decline |publisher=messengernewspapers.co.uk |date=20 August 1999 | accessdate = 14 March 2012[/tpl] In 2006 Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council unveiled plans for a £1.5 million redevelopment for the town centre.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.messengernewspapers.co.uk/homes/archive/2006/11/13/Latest+news+%28trafford_news%29/1019324.Town_gets_a_facelift/|title=Town gets a facelift |publisher=messengernewspapers.co.uk |last=Roberts |first=Lynsey |date=13 November 2006 | accessdate = 14 March 2012[/tpl] The renovation will create [tpl]convert|146000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of new retail space and [tpl]convert|203000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of refurbished space, providing [tpl]convert|349000|sqft|m2[/tpl] in total.[tpl]cite news |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/s/189/189342_40m_renewal_plan.html |title=£40m renewal plan |work=Manchester Evening News |publisher= M.E.N. media|date=29 November 2005 | accessdate = 14 March 2012[/tpl] •[tpl]cite news |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/s/213818_40m_precinct_takes_shape |title=£40m precinct takes shape |work=Manchester Evening News|publisher = M.E.N. media |date=23 May 2006 | accessdate = 14 March 2012[/tpl]

===Landmarks and attractions===

The Old Market Place is thought to stand on the site of the original town settlement. Now a registered conservation area it consists of a series of part timber-framed buildings echoing the wattle and daub constructions of the original houses and burgage plots. The cobblestone paving was replaced in 1896. The Buttermarket which stood in the area near the Old Market Place from the 17th century until the late 19th century was also the site for dispensing early local justice. A courtroom, stocks and whipping post saw public floggings take place there until the early 19th century. The whipping post and stocks were restored as a tourist attraction by local traders in the 1990s. However the Buttermarket area was also a site of religious importance, since prospective brides and grooms are thought to have declared their intentions here.[tpl]cite web | url= http://althistsoc.users.btopenworld.com/tourp1.html | title=Tour of Altrincham: Old Market Place | publisher=Altrincham History Society | accessdate = 3 January 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] In 1814 Thomas de Quincey described the Old Market Place in his Confessions of an English Opium Eater while travelling from Manchester to Chester. He noted how little the place had changed since his visit 14 years earlier at the age of three, and that "fruits, such as can be had in July, and flowers were scattered about in profusion: even the stalls of the butchers, from their brilliant cleanliness, appeared attractive: and bonny young women of Altrincham were all tripping about in caps and aprons coquettishly disposed".De Quincey (1994), pp. 75–76. Another of Altrincham's attractions is the historic market, set up over 700 years ago when the town was first established.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/altrinchammarket/ |title=Welcome to Altrincham Market |publisher=Trafford MBC |accessdate = 22 March 2012[/tpl]

===Sports===

==Education==

As Altrincham was part of the Bowdon parish, children from the township may have gone to the 16th-century school established at Bowdon; before that point, the town had no formal education system. A salt merchant from Dunham Woodhouses founded a school at Oldfield House intended for 40 boys aged 8–11 from the surrounding area. Sunday schools were set up in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.Bayliss (1992), p. 71. Altrincham's increasing population prompted the founding of more schools during the early 19th century and by 1856 the town had 9 schools, 1 college, and 23 teachers.Bayliss (1992), p. 72. The introduction of compulsory education during the second half of the 19th century increased the demand for schools, and by 1886 Altrincham had 12 church schools and 8 private schools.Bayliss (1992), p. 73.
Responsibility for local education fell to Cheshire County Council in 1903. Loreto Convent, the County High School for Girls, and Altrincham County High School for Boys, were founded in 1909, 1910, and 1912 respectively. Although still open these schools have since changed their names to Altrincham Grammar School for Girls, Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, and Loreto Grammar School. Altrincham received evacuees during the Second World War, and it was in this period that St. Ambrose College was founded.Bayliss (1992), p. 74.
Altrincham now has eighteen primary schools, one special school and eight secondary schools, including five grammar schools; the Trafford district maintains a selective education system assessed by the Eleven Plus exam. Several of Altrincham's secondary schools have specialist status: Altrincham College of Arts (arts);[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/1703387/urn/106367.pdf |format=PDF |title=Altrincham College of Arts inspection report |publisher=ofsted.gov.uk |date=24 May 2011 | accessdate = 17 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl] Altrincham Grammar School for Boys (language);[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/881941/urn/106361.pdf |format=PDF |title=Altrincham Grammar School for Boys inspection report |publisher=ofsted.gov.uk |date=13 December 2007 | accessdate = 17 March 2012[/tpl] Altrincham Grammar School for Girls (language);[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/920061/urn/106362.pdf |format=PDF |title=Altrincham Grammar School for Girls inspection report |publisher=ofsted.gov.uk |date=9 October 2008 | accessdate = 17 March 2012[/tpl] Blessed Thomas Holford Catholic College (maths and computing);[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/881957/urn/106376.pdf |format=PDF |title=Blessed Thomas Holford Catholic College inspection report |publisher=ofsted.gov.uk |date=2 July 2008 | accessdate = 17 March 2012[/tpl] Loreto Grammar School (science and maths);[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/920089/urn/106378.pdf |title=Loreto Grammar School inspection report |publisher=Ofsted |date=11 November 2008 |format=PDF | accessdate = 17 March 2012[/tpl] and St. Ambrose College (maths and computing).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/920089/urn/106378.pdf |title=St Ambrose College inspection report |publisher=Ofsted |date=8 July 2009 |format=PDF | accessdate = 17 March 2012[/tpl] Altrincham College of Arts, Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, Altrincham Grammar School for Girls, Blessed Thomas Holford Catholic College, Loreto Grammar School, and St. Ambrose College were all rated as outstanding in their most recent Ofsted reports.

==Religion==

During the medieval and post-medieval periods the township of Altrincham was part of Bowdon parish. Low population density meant that the town did not have a church until the Anglican church established a chapel of ease in 1799. Nonconformists were also present in Altrincham; Methodists set up a chapel in 1790, and Baptists built one in the 1870s.Bayliss (1992), p. 58.Nevell (1997) pp. 106–107. Irish immigrants in the 1830s and 1840s also returned Roman Catholicism to the area, the first Roman Catholic church built in Altrincham being St Vincent's, in 1860.Nevell (1997) pp. 107–108.

==Transport==

Construction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway began in 1845. The line was opened in October 1849, with services from Manchester London RoadAwdry (1990), pp. 222–223. via Sale to Altrincham.Nevell (1997), p. 97. In 1931 it became one of Great Britain's first electrified railway lines, with a 1,500V DC overhead line. At the same time a new Altrincham station was opened on the same line, at Navigation Road, serving housing developments in the area. By 1937, 130 train services ran daily between Manchester and Altrincham. The line was renovated in the early 1990s to form part of the Manchester Metrolink light rail system.Nevell (1997), p. 100. Broadheath railway station served the northern part of Altrincham between 1853 and 1962, on the line from Manchester, via Lymm to Warrington.[tpl]cite web |title=Station name:Broadheath Altrincham |publisher=Disused stations.org |url=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/b/broadheath/index.shtml| accessdate = 22 March 2012[/tpl]
Altrincham Interchange remains the Metrolink's southernmost terminus. It connects the town to several locations in Greater Manchester, such as Sale and Bury.
