[[Fixed allele]]

CATEGORIES: Genetics

A fixed allele is an allele that is the only variant that exists for that gene in all the population. A fixed allele is homozygous for all members of the population.http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-F/fixed_allele.html
The term allele normally refers to one variant gene out of several possible for a particular locus in the DNA. When all but one allele go extinct and only one remains, that allele is said to be fixed.
