Poole won the league championship for the second year in a row. Bradford, at their new venue at Greenfields Stadium, returned to the league after missing the previous season due to delays building their new track. The league season proved to be disastrous for Bradford and the club folded at the end of the year. New team Neath joined the league and Leicester joined after dropping down from the National League. Neath, near Port Talboth in Wales, was not a successful venue and many of their fixtures were raced at St. Austell.
