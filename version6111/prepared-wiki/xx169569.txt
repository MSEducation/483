==History==

The road from SR-17 (now SR-82) in Tremonton northwest to Snowville became a state highway in 1912 as part of the Midland Trail (which continued to Nevada via present SR-30.Third Biennial Report of the State Road Commission, 1915, p. 65: "In May, 1912, a road to pass west from Snowville through Park Valley, Rosette and Lucin to the Utah-Nevada line was designated as a State Road. At the following session of the State Legislature, an appropriation of $15000 was made to help in the construction of this road. This appropriation was part of the "Midland Trail" building fund, the Midland Trail being a proposed highway entering the State through Grand County on the east, thence through Emery, Carbon, Utah, Salt Lake, Davis, Weber and thence west through Box Elder County around the north end of Great Salt Lake." The state highway was extended to Idaho in 1921,Utah Department of Transportation, State Route History, accessed July 2007 became part of US 30S in 1926,Bureau of Public Roads, United States System of Highways, November 11, 1926 and received the (unsigned) SR-42 designation in 1927.[tpl]cite UTSR law|year=1927|quote=42.

From Haws Corner on SR-41 northwesterly via Tremonton and Snowville to the Utah-Idaho state line near Strevell, Idaho.[/tpl] When SR-3 was assigned to proposed I-80N in 1962, SR-42 east of the Snowville junction (exit 7) became SR-3. (Later, the portion near Tremonton would be renumbered SR-102.) Finally, in 1969, SR-42 received its present termini, as SR-70 (now SR-30) was extended east over SR-42 to I-84 west of Snowville, and the roadway through Snowville was removed from the state highway system. The American Association of State Highway Officials approved the relocation of US-30S onto I-84 in 1970, after which the first SR-42 signs were placed on the route that had been so designated since 1927.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: [tpl]PDFlink|1=Route 30|2=5.31 MB[/tpl], updated October 2007, accessed May 2008
