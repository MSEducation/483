Northumberland County is covered by thick forests, whose products stimulate the economy. The highest peaks in the province, including Mount Carleton lie in the northwestern corner of the county.
The county is dominated by the Miramichi River, world famous for its salmon fishing.  The lower portion of the river is an estuary which widens into Miramichi Bay, a part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

Chatham was also home to an air force base, CFB Chatham, until 1996.  Renous, located along the Southwest Miramichi was also home to an army post - a federal maximum security penitentiary is now located on the site.
