==American cheese==

The best known processed cheese in the United States is marketed as American cheese by Kraft Foods, Borden, and other companies. It is orange, yellow, or off-white; and mild, with a medium consistency, and melts easily. It is typically made from a blend of cheeses, most often Colby and Cheddar.
Another type of processed cheese created in the United States is Provel pasteurized processed pizza cheese, which uses Cheddar, Swiss, and provolone cheeses as flavorants.[tpl]cite book |title=The Everything Pizza Cookbook: 300 Crowd-Pleasing Slices of Heaven |last=Hulin |first=Belinda |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=F+W Publications, Inc. |location= |isbn=1598692593 |page=7 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pZAv_kYu-9UC&pg=PA7&dq=provel |accessdate=September 30, 2012[/tpl] Provel cheese is commonly used in St. Louis-style pizza.
