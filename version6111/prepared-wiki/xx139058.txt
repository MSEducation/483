Hornnes is a village and a former municipality in Aust-Agder county, Norway. Hornnes is located in the present-day municipality of Evje og Hornnes in the traditional district of Setesdal. Hornnes was a municipality of its own from 1886 until 1960.

==Name==

The municipality (originally the parish) of Hornnes is named after an old Hornnes farm (Old Norse: Hornnes), since the first church was built there. The first element is horn which means "horn" and the last element is nes which means "headland".  So the meaning of Hornnes is "the headland shaped like a horn".[tpl]cite book|title=Norske gaardnavne: Nedenes amt|edition=8|authorlink=Oluf Rygh|last=Rygh|first=Oluf|publisher=W. C.

==History==

The municipality of Hornnes was created on 1 January 1886 when the municipality of Hornnes og Iveland was divided into two separate municipalities: Hornnes (population: 1,113) and Iveland (population: 1,103).
On 1 January 1960, Hornnes was merged with Evje to form a new municipality called Evje og Hornnes. Prior to the merger Hornnes had a population of 1,280. On 1 January 1986, the Lislevand farm area (population: 8) in the neighboring Birkenes municipality was transferred to the municipality of Evje og Hornnes.[tpl]cite paper|first=Dag|last=Jukvam|publisher=Statistisk sentralbyrå|title=Historisk oversikt over endringer i kommune- og fylkesinndelingen|date=1999|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf|language=Norwegian[/tpl]
