==History==

Kingfisher was founded in 1982 by the buyout of the British Woolworths chain by Paternoster Stores Ltd. which later changed its name to Woolworth Holdings plc.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.kingfisher.com/index.asp?pageid=17 |title=Kingfisher History |publisher=Kingfisher.com |date= |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl] The Company expanded through subsequent acquisitions of companies such as B&Q, Superdrug and Comet. It was led from 1984 (until his retirement in 2002) by Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, who became renowned for his taciturn public persona, lengthy decision-making and love of sailing. Largely through his influence, Kingfisher became the major sponsor of British sailor Dame Ellen MacArthur.[tpl]Cite web|author=Offshore Challenges Media/ISAF Secretariat |url=http://www.sailing.org/news/3707.php |title=Kingfisher continues sponsorship |publisher=Sailing.org |date=3 January 2002 |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl]
