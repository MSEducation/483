His mission was to propagate Gaudiya Vaishnavism, a school of Vaishnavite Hinduism that had been taught to him by his guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, throughout the world.[tpl]Harvnb|Klostermaier|2007|p=217[/tpl] Born Abhay Charan De in Calcutta, he was educated at the prestigious local Scottish Church College.[tpl]cite book|last=Jones|first=Constance|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-8160-5458-4|pages=77–78[/tpl] Before adopting the life of a pious renunciant (vanaprastha) in 1950,[tpl]Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol.1 Chapter 6[/tpl] he was married with children and owned a small pharmaceutical business.

In his later years, as a traveling Vaishnava monk, he became an influential communicator of Gaudiya Vaishnava theology to India and specifically to the West through his leadership of ISKCON, founded in 1966.[tpl]Harvnb|Ekstrand|Bryant|2004|p=23[/tpl] As the founder of ISKCON, he "emerged as a major figure of the Western counterculture, initiating thousands of young Americans."[tpl]Harvnb|Klostermaier|2007|p=309[/tpl] Despite attacks from anti-cult groups, he received a favorable welcome from many religious scholars, such as J. Stillson Judah, Harvey Cox, Larry Shinn and Thomas Hopkins, who praised Bhaktivedanta Swami's translations and defended the group against distorted media images and misinterpretations.[tpl]Harvnb|Vasan|Lewis|2005|p=129[/tpl] In respect to his achievements, religious leaders from other Gaudiya Vaishnava movements have also given him credit.
He has been described as a charismatic leader, in the sense used by sociologist Max Weber, as he was successful in acquiring followers in the United States, Europe, India and elsewhere."Unrecognized charisma?

==Biography==

===Early life===

Born on 1 September 1896, the day after Janmastami, one of the most important Vaishnava holidays, in a humble house in the Tollygunge suburb of Calcutta, he was named Abhay Charan, "one who is fearless, having taken shelter at Lord Krishna's feet." Since he was born on the day of Nandotsava ("the celebration of Nanda," Krishna's father, a traditional festival in honor of Krishna's birth) he was also called Nandulal. His parents, Sriman Gour Mohan De and Srimati Rajani De, were devout Vaishnavas (devotees of Vishnu). In accordance with Bengali tradition, his mother had gone to the home of her parents for the delivery, and only a few days later Abhay returned with parents to his home at 151 Harrison Road in Calcutta, where he was brought up and educated.
He received a European led education in the Scottish Church College. This school was well reputed among Bengalis; many Vaishnava families sent their sons there. The professors, most of whom were Europeans, were known as sober, moral men, and it is believed that the students received a good education. The college was located in north Calcutta, not far from Harrison Road where Abhay's family lived. During his years in the college, Abhay Charan De was a member of the English Society as well as that of the Sanskrit Society, and it has been suggested that his education provided him a foundation for his future leadership.[tpl]Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol.1 Chapter 2[/tpl] He graduated in 1920 with majors in English, philosophy and economics.[tpl]Harvnb|Vasan|Lewis|2005|p=128[/tpl] However he rejected his diploma in response to Gandhi's independence movement.Eggenberger, D. 1989. Encyclopedia of World Biography: A to F. His refusal to accept the diploma he had earned was in protest of the British. He also wore the homespun cotton cloth the followers of Gandhi wore in support of home industry and protest of British rule in India.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
At 22 years old Abhay married Radharani Devi, who was 11 years old, in a marriage arranged by their parents. At 14 years old Radharani gave birth to Abhay's first son.

===Religious career===

In 1922, when he first met his spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, he was requested to spread the message of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the English language.[tpl]Harvnb|Goswami|1984|loc=page xv[/tpl] In 1932 he became a formally initiated disciple of Bhaktisiddhanta. In 1944, (from his front room at Sita Kanta Banerjee, Calcutta), he started the publication called Back to Godhead,[tpl]Harvnb|Goswami|1984|loc=page xviii[/tpl] for which he acted as designer, publisher, editor, copy editor and distributor. He personally designed the logo, an effulgent figure of Caitanya Mahaprabhu in the upper left corner, with the motto: "Godhead is Light, Nescience is darkness" greeting the readers.[tpl]Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol.1 Chapter 5[/tpl] In his first magazine he wrote:
In 1947, the Gaudiya Vaishnava Society recognised his scholarship with the title Bhaktivedanta, ([tpl]IAST|bhakti-vedānta[/tpl]) meaning "one who has realised that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the end of all knowledge"[tpl]Harvnb|Bhaktivedanta|2003|loc=Ending Glossary[/tpl] (with the words Bhakti, indicating devotion and Vedanta indicating conclusive knowledge).
A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami (1998) The Secrets of Transcendental Love, ISBN 0-89213-273-6, p. 73:"The spiritual harmony of knowledge and devotion is well expressed in the phrase bhakti-vedānta"
His later well known name, [tpl]IAST|Prabhupāda[/tpl], is a Sanskrit title, literally meaning "he who has taken the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord" where [tpl]IAST|prabhu[/tpl] denotes "Lord", and [tpl]IAST|pāda[/tpl] means "taking shelter."[tpl]cite book |author=Dr Aparma |title=Pearls of Spiritual Wisdom |publisher=Pustak Mahal,India |location= |year=2004 |page=37 |isbn=81-223-0858-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl]  Also, "at whose feet masters sit".[tpl]Harvnb|Rhodes|2001|p=178[/tpl] This name was used as a respectful form of address by his disciples from late 1967 early 1968 onwards. Previous to this, as with his early disciples, followers used to call him "Swamiji".[tpl]Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol.1 Chapter Planting the Seed[/tpl]
From 1950 onwards, he lived at the medieval Radha-Damodar mandir in the holy town of Vrindavan, where he began his commentary and translation work of the Sanskrit work Bhagavata Purana.[tpl]cite book |author=Charles S. J. White |title=A Catalogue of Vaishnava Literature on Microfilms in the Adyar Library |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |location=Delhi |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=81-208-2067-3[/tpl] Of all notable Vrindavana's temples, the Radha-Damodara mandir had at the time the largest collection of various copies of the original writings of the Six Gosvamis and their followers – more than two thousand separate manuscripts, many of them three hundred, some even four hundred years old.[tpl]cite journal |author = Mukherjee, T.|author2=Wright, J.C. |year = 1979 |title=An Early Testamentary Document in Sanskrit |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |volume=42| issue = 2| pages = 297–320 |doi=10.1017/S0041977X00145859 |jstor=615020[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol.1 Chapter This Momentous Hour of Need[/tpl] His guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, had always encouraged him that "If you ever get money, print books",[tpl]Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol.1 Chapter 4[/tpl] "[tpl]IAST|Āmār icchā chila kichu bai karānā[/tpl]: "Standing by [tpl]IAST|Rādhā-kuṇḍa[/tpl] and beholding his spiritual master, Abhay felt the words deeply enter his own life – "If you ever get money, print books." referring to the need of literary presentation of the Vaishnava culture.[tpl]Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol.1 Chapter 4[/tpl]

===Renunciation===

Keshavaji Gaudiya Matha was the place where Bhaktivedanta used to live, he had written and studied in the library of this building, here he edited the [tpl]IAST|Gauḍīya Patrikā[/tpl] magazine and this is the place where he donated the murti of Lord Chaitanya who stands on the altar beside the Deities of Radha Krishna (named Śrī Śrī Rādhā Vinodavihārījī). During his visit in September 1959 he entered the doors of this matha dressed in white, as Abhoy Babu, but would be leaving dressed in saffron, a sannyasi.[tpl]Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol.1 Chapter 9[/tpl] He received the sannyasa name Swami (स्वामी Svāmi), not to be confused with the title Swami. In this matha, in Mathura Vrndavana, Abhoy Charan Bhaktivedanta took Vaishnava renunciate vows,sannyasa, from his friend and godbrother Bhakti Prajnana Keshava, and following this he single-handedly published the first three volumes covering seventeen chapters of the first book of Bhagavata Purana, filling three volumes of four hundred pages each with a detailed commentary. Introduction to the first volume was a biographical sketch of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He then left India, obtaining free passage on a freight ship called the Jaladuta, with the aim and a hope of fulfilling his spiritual master's instruction to spread the message of Caitanya Mahaprabhu around the world. In his possession were a suitcase, an umbrella, a supply of dry cereal, about eight dollars worth of Indian currency, and several boxes of books.[tpl]Harvnb|Knott|1997|loc="Bhaktivedanta Swami, by journeying to America, was attempting to fulfill the wish of his guru, possible only by the grace of his dear Lord Krishna."[/tpl]

===Mission to the West===

A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami sailed to USA in 1965. His trip to the United States was not sponsored by any religious organization, nor was he met upon arrival by a group of loyal followers. As he neared his destination on the ship, the Indian freighter Jaladuta, the enormity of his intended task weighed on him. On 13 September he wrote in his diary, "Today I have disclosed my mind to my companion, Lord Sri Krishna."[tpl]Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol 1. Ch 1[/tpl] On this occasion and on a number of others, he called on Krishna for help in his native Bengali. Examining these compositions, academics regard them as "intimate records of his prayerful preparation for what lay ahead" and a view on "how Bhaktivedanta Swami understood his own identity and mission."[tpl]Harvnb|Knott|1997|loc=Introduction[/tpl]
By journeying to USA, he was attempting to fulfill the wish of his guru, possible only by the grace of "his dear Lord Krishna". It is in July 1966 "global missionary Vaishnavism" was brought to the West by Bhaktivedanta Swami, "the soul agent", founding the International Society for Krishna Consciousness in New York City. Bhaktivedanta Swami spent much of the last decade of his life setting up the institution of ISKCON. Since he was the Society's leader, his personality and management were responsible for much of ISKCON's growth and the reach of his mission.
When it was suggested to him at the time of founding the ISKCON in 1966 that a broader term "God Consciousness" would be preferable to "Krishna Consciousness" in the title, he rejected this recommendation, suggesting that name Krishna includes all other forms and concepts of God.[tpl]Harvnb|Ekstrand|Bryant|2004|pp=120–122[/tpl]
After a group of devotees and a temple had been established in New York another center was started in San Francisco in 1967.[tpl]Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=22[/tpl] From there he traveled throughout America with his disciples, popularizing the movement through street chanting (sankirtana), book distribution and public speeches.
Once ISKCON was more established in the USA a small number of devotees from the San Francisco temple were sent to London, England. After a short time in London they came into contact with The Beatles, of whom George Harrison took the greatest interest, spending a significant time speaking with Bhaktivedanta Swami and producing a record with members of the later London Radha Krsna Temple.[tpl]Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=23[/tpl] Over the following years Bhaktivedanta Swami's continuing leadership role took him around the world some several times setting up temples and communities in all of the major continents. By the time of his death in Vrindavan in 1977, ISKCON had become an internationally known expression of Vaishnavism.
In the twelve years from his arrival in New York until his final days, he:

Through his mission, Bhaktivedanta Swami followed and communicated the teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and introduced bhakti yoga to an international audience. Within Gaudiya Vaishnavism this was viewed as the fulfillment of a long time mission to introduce Caitanya Mahaprabhu's teachings to the world.[tpl]Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=5[/tpl][ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vrindavan.org/English/Books/GM/GMII.html#BranchesGM| title=Branches of the Gaudiya Math |publisher=www.vrindavan.org| accessdate=2008-05-30 |last=Maharaja |first=Sridhar |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080704175744/http://www.vrindavan.org/English/Books/GM/GMII.html |archivedate=4 July 2008 |deadurl= no[/tpl]

In his discussion with a historian Arnold J. Toynbee in London, Bhaktivedanta Swami is quoted as saying: "I have started this Krishna Conscious Movement among the Indians and Americans and for the next ten thousand years it will increase."[ref]
 Ch. 6, p. 161[/ref]

==Books and publishing==

It is believed that Bhaktivedanta Swami's most significant contribution are his books.[tpl]Harvnb|Sharma|1981|p=971[/tpl]"I think the best feature of the Hare Krishna movement is that it is providing scholars with excellent translations of the rarest books on Krishna-bhakti of Krishna." – Dr.Larry Shinn, President of Berea College, Kentucky. Within the final twenty years of his life Bhaktivedanta Swami translated over sixty volumes of classic Vedic scriptures (such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Srimad Bhagavatam) into the English language. For their authority, depth, and clarity, his books have won praise from professors at colleges and universities like Harvard, Oxford, Cornell, Columbia, Syracuse, Oberlin, and Edinburgh, and his Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is was published by Macmillan Publishers, in 1968 and unabridged edition in 1972,Maheswar Neog Professor Maheswar Neog Felicitation Volume (1990)Bhaktivedanta Swami, A. C. (1968). The Bhagavad-gita As It Is, first edition. New York: Macmillan.  and is now available in over sixty languages around the world and some other books by Bhaktivedanta Swami are available in over eighty different languages.[tpl]Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=34[/tpl] In February 2014, ISKCON's news agency reported to have reached a milestone of distributing over half a billion books authored by Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, since 1965.
The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust was established in 1972 to publish his works, and it has also published his multi-volume biography, Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta, that according to Larry Shinn will "certainly be one of the most complete records of the life and work of any modern religious figure".[tpl]Harvnb|Goswami et al.|1983|p=986[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Shinn|Bromley|1989|p=53[/tpl] Prabhupada reminded his devotees before his death that he would live forever in his books, and through them would remain present as a spiritual master or guru.[ref][tpl]Harvnb|Knott|1997|loc=Prabhupada, Books and Publishing[/tpl]
[/ref] Bhaktivedanta Swami had instilled in his followers an understanding of the importance of writing and publishing not only with regard to his works, but also their own initiatives. His early disciples felt Prabhupada had given them Back To Godhead for their own writings from the very start.
A prominent Gaudiya Vaishnava figure, Shrivatsa Goswami, who as a young man had met Bhaktivedanta Swami in 1972, affirmed the significance of book publishing and distribution in spreading the message of Caitanya in an interview with Steven Gelberg:
[tpl]Cquote2|Making these Vaisnava texts available is one of Srila Prabhupada's greatest contributions. Apart from the masses, his books have also reached well into academic circles and have spurred academic interest in the Chaitanya tradition ... The significance of making these texts available is not merely academic or cultural; it is spiritual.[tpl]Harvnb|Cox et al.|1983|p=247[/tpl][/tpl]

==Views on other religious traditions==

Bhaktivedanta Swami considered Moses, Jesus, and Mohamed to be empowered representatives of God, describing them within his writings as pioneers of the same essential message of dedication to God with love and devotion.[tpl]cite book |author = Schmidt, Peter |year=2002 |title = Krishna meets Jesus : A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada's Interpretations and Conclusions about Christianity |publisher=Peter Schmidt |isbn=3-8311-3570-3 |oclc=313729431 [/tpl] p.146 (self published)
[tpl]Cquote2|"Actually, it doesn't matter – Krishna or Christ – the name is the same. The main point is to follow the injunctions of the Vedic scriptures that recommend chanting the name of God in this age." [tpl]Harvnb|Bhaktivedanta|2003|loc=[/tpl][/tpl]
Other typical expression presents a different perspective, where he would point out that "today I may be a Hindu, but tomorrow I may become a Christian or Muslim. In this way faiths can be changed, but dharma" is a natural sequence, a natural occupation or a connection and it can not be changed, because it is permanent, according to him. While the ISKCON theology of personal god is close to Christian theology, both personal and monotheistic, being a preacher of bhakti and a missionary he sometimes would add, that "already many Christians have tasted the nectar of divine love of the holy name and are dancing with karatalas (hand-cymbals) and mridangas (drums)."[tpl]Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=6[/tpl]
His approach to modern knowledge is also seen in sectarian Orthodox Judaism, where the skills and technical knowledge of modernity are encouraged, but the values rejected. Bhaktivedanta Swami stated "devotees should not be lazy, idle...we are not afraid to work. Whatever our engagement is, by offering the result to Krishna we become Krishna conscious".[ref]
 (self published)[/ref] Some of his representations are believed to affect women adversely and are male-centred, others are tender and celebratory. Bhaktivedanta Swami himself taught a dualism of body and soul and that of the genders. Similar to many traditional religions he considered sexuality and spirituality as conflicting opposites.[tpl]Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=224[/tpl] Among some liberal male followers there is a positive recognition of his example in applying the spirit of the law according to time, place, person and circumstance, rather than literal tracing of the tradition.[tpl]Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=223[/tpl]
In line with traditional Vaishnava theology, he was critical of the monist philosophies of Hinduism representing the Gaudiya Vaishnava point of view and often insulting the orthodox Vedanta adherents of monism with 'cruel words'. In the view of some, the Gaudiya-Vaishnava philosophy he followed is neither fully dualistic nor monist (this is known as Achintya Bheda Abheda). As a school of thought, Gaudiya Vaishnavism has much more in common with the Dvaita, as opposed to the Advaita schools.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]

==Within India==

Beginning his public preaching mission in India, he founded the League of Devotees in Jhansi in 1953.League of Devotees article prabhupadaconnect.com
Following the establishment of temples and centres in the United States and Europe, he returned to India in 1971, holding many public programs which were well attended. From 1971 onwards, the movement became increasingly popular and spread throughout India. He was particularly eager to see the progress at "the impressive temple project in" Mumbai which he and his disciples had fought very hard to establish,[tpl]Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=27[/tpl] with large temples in Mayapur and Vrindavan to follow in mid-1970s. To promote the vedic education system within the modern Indian education structure, he introduced a chain of Gurukul in various part of India. The Bhaktivedanta Gurukula and International School is one of the most successful schools in the list.
In 1996, the Government of India recognized his accomplishments by issuing a commemorative stamp in his honour as a part of Prabhupada Centennial celebrations.

Speaking at the inauguration of ISKCON's cultural center in New Delhi on 5 April on the occasion of Ramnavmi in 1998, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, then India's prime minister, said:

==Monuments==

A number of memorial samadhis or shrines to Bhaktivedanta Swami were constructed by the members of ISKCON in his remembrance, the largest of which are in Mayapur, Vrindavan and at the larger sized temples in America. Prabhupada's Palace of Gold was designed and constructed by devotees of the New Vrindavan community and dedicated on 2 September 1979. Back in 1972 it was intended to be simply a residence for Bhaktivedanta Swami, but over time the plans evolved into an ornate marble and gold palace which is now visited by thousands of Hindu pilgrims each year, visiting this centerpiece of the community strongly relying upon tourist trade.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.palaceofgold.com/| title=Prabhupada's Palace of Gold| publisher=www.palaceofgold.com| accessdate=2008-05-31| last=| first=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080614223037/http://palaceofgold.com/| archivedate= 14 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
