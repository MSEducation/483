 even in the non-German-language media. He is known as "the Red Baron", because of his red Ferrari and in reference to the German [[Manfred von Richthofen]], the famous [[flying ace]] of World War I. Schumacher's nicknames include "Schumi",<ref>

Schumacher is often credited with popularising Formula One in Germany, where it was formerly considered a fringe sport.[tpl]cite web | author=Sapa |title=The greatest driver of all time! |publisher=SuperWheels |date=11 September 2006 |url=http://www.superwheels.co.za/default.asp?id=4846&des=sportstalk |accessdate=24 October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927153411/http://www.superwheels.co.za/default.asp?id=4846&des=sportstalk  |archivedate=27 September 2006[/tpl] When Schumacher retired in 2006, three of the top ten drivers were German, more than any other nationality and more than have ever been present in Formula One history. Younger German drivers, such as Sebastian Vettel, felt Schumacher was key in their becoming Formula One drivers. In the latter part of his Formula One career, and as one of the senior drivers, Schumacher was the president of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association. In a 2006 FIA survey, Michael Schumacher was voted the most popular driver of the season among Formula One fans.[tpl]cite news |title=Schumacher tops F1 supporter poll |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 September 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/5384692.stm |accessdate=25 October 2006[/tpl]

===Debut with Jordan===

Schumacher made his Formula One debut with the Jordan-Ford team at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, driving car number 32 as a replacement for the imprisoned Bertrand Gachot. Schumacher, still a contracted Mercedes driver, was signed by Eddie Jordan after Mercedes paid Jordan $150,000 for his debut.
