==History==

===Founding and early years: 1998–2002===

Ilium were founded in Newcastle by former members of local power metal band, Oracle, with guitarist-songwriter Jason Hodges and vocalist Mark Snedden initially as Iliad in 1998.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/australia/newcastle/oracle | title = Artists :: Oracle | publisher = MusicMight (Rock Detector) | accessdate = 19 August 2013 [/tpl] Hodges and Snedden were school friends and had formed Oracle in 1990.[tpl]cite web | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030625195348/http://www.ilium-metal.com/bio_band.htm | url = http://www.ilium-metal.com/bio_band.htm | title = Ilium: The Band | publisher = Ilium Official Website | archivedate = 25 June 2003 | accessdate = 19 August 2013 [/tpl] Iliad also included later Oracle members: Kris Arendse on guitar and Michael Noonan on bass guitar; as well as session musician, David Pearson on drums. They recorded a six-track demo which the band's website described as "ill-fated from the start, with an inappropriate producer and the band's lack of studio experience, coupled with plaguing health problems, the results were truly horrible". Hodges listed the group's inspirations as "Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Helloween, Rage, Blind Guardian, Gamma Ray, Rush, Megadeth, Coroner, Scorpions, Rainbow, Ozzy Osbourne, and Dio".[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.heavymetalnation.com/2007/04/01/ilium-april-2007-interview-by-pharmerfour/ | title = Ilium – April 2007 Interview | last = Pharmerfour | publisher = Heavy Metal Nation | date = 1 April 2007 | accessdate = 20 August 2013 [/tpl]
Late in 1998 with the introduction of Adam Smith, also ex-Oracle, on guitar the group changed its name to Ilium. In 2002 they recorded a four-track eponymous extended play with Dungeon's vocalist and guitarist Lord Tim (aka Tim Grose) producing and adding backing vocals. Noonan left during recording sessions and Smith completed the bass guitar work. The EP included a cover version of Fleetwood Mac's "The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)" in the vogue of Judas Priest's 1979 version. The other tracks were "Half-Life", "Semblance" and "Antigone" – the first two were solely written by Hodges, while the latter was co-written with Smith and Sneddon.[tpl]MusicBrainz release|id=19a2da7d-4a8b-4336-a6cf-4f38caa64e32|name=Ilium EP | accessdate = 19 August 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | publisher = Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) | title = 'Half-Life' at APRA search engine | url = http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=Half%20Life | accessdate = 19 August 2013 [/tpl] Note: User may be required to click on 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title' or add Ilium at 'Performer'.

===Sirens of the Styx: 2003–2004===

On 18 December 2003 Ilium issued their debut album, Sirens of the Styx, with Lord Tim producing again and Steve Moore providing drums.[tpl]cite AV media notes | title = Sirens of the Styx | others = Ilium | year = 2003 |chapter= |url= |accessdate= |first= |last= |authorlink= |first2= |last2= |authorlink2= |page= |pages= |type= | publisher = Adrenaline / Steelheart Records | id =  0310 |location= |ref=[/tpl] It included three tracks from Ilium, as well as "Incipience: Beowulf Defeats Grendel", which is part one of a trilogy centred on the Beowulf and Grendel legends. Parts two and three appeared on their third release. "Incipience" was written by Hodges, Smith, Snedden and Noonan.[tpl]cite web | publisher = Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) | title = 'Incipience: Beowulf Defeats Grendel' at APRA search engine | url = http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=Incipience%20Beowulf%20Defeats%20Grendel | accessdate = 20 August 2013 [/tpl] Another track, "The Celestial Sphere", written by Hodges, Smith and Snedden,[tpl]cite web | publisher = Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) | title = 'The Celestial Sphere' at APRA search engine | url = http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=The%20Celestial%20Sphere | accessdate = 20 August 2013 [/tpl] became Ilium's first music video. Daniel Böhm from German metal magazine, Rock Hard, found the album "sounds wonderfully wrong-headed".[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.rockhard.de/megazine/reviewarchiv/review-anzeigen/16035-sirens-of-the-styx.html | title = Review Anzeigen: Sirens of the Styx | last = Böhm | first = Daniel | work = Rock Hard | language = German | publisher = Holger Stratmann | issue = 202 | accessdate = 19 August 2013 [/tpl] After recording the album, Peter Gilchrist joined on bass guitar, while drummer David Walmsley joined shortly thereafter.
Snedden left in July due to family and financial restraints, Lord Tim was recruited in his place, originally to complete the recording sessions but soon became a full-time member. Gilchrist and Walmsley both left Ilium at the end of 2003, Gilchrist was recorded on the demo tracks but bass guitar on the album was provided by Smith, with Walmsley completing his drum duties on the album before exiting. Tim's vocal style which was in tune with Smith and Hodges' vision, which helped Ilium garner international praise, whilst the production duties were taken over largely by Hodges and Smith. Late in 2004, Gilchrist and Walmsley rejoined Ilium, and Gilchrist's 15-year-old son Corey joined on keyboards, with his vocals providing extra body to their live performances. Corey Gilchrist auditioned to appear on the TV talent show, Australian Idol, and twice reached the top 100 but did not progress.

===Permian Dusk: 2005–2006===

Ilium's second album, Permian Dusk, was released on 25 November 2005. Walmsley left again as the album was being mastered and was replaced on drums by Dungeon's Tim Yatras. In October Corey was hit by a train and his foot was amputated, which forced both he and his father out of the band. Corey recovered and later appeared on Australian Idol getting into the semi-finals.
Permian Dusk received a positive review from Rock Hard, which gave it a score of 9.5/10 and led their reviewer, Wolfram Küper, to declare it as the best power metal album of the year.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.rockhard.de/megazine/reviewarchiv/review-anzeigen/18838-permian-dusk.html | title = Review Anzeigen: Permian Dusk | last = Küper | first = Wolfram | work = Rock Hard | language = German | publisher = Holger Stratmann | issue = 225 | accessdate = 20 August 2013 [/tpl] Allmusic's Stewart Mason felt it avoided the "more annoying aspects of modern metal", where Tim's vocals showed "oddly perfect diction and haughty delivery of an old-school metal singer" and the rest of the band "plays it fast and melodic, with clean-sounding chorused guitars riffing".[tpl]cite web | url = [tpl]Allmusic | pure_url=yes | class=album/credits | id=r864226 [/tpl] | title=Permian Dusk – Ilium | last = Mason | first = Stewart | publisher = Allmusic.

Rock Hard[tpl]'[/tpl]s Küper rated it at 8.0/10, he found it provided "a partly majestic, partly mystic atmosphere" with the sound of "melody, hardness and independence".[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.rockhard.de/megazine/reviewarchiv/review-anzeigen/22547-vespertilion.html | title = Review Anzeigen: Vespertlion | last = Küper | first = Wolfram | work = Rock Hard | language = German | publisher = Holger Stratmann | issue = 251 | accessdate = 20 August 2013 [/tpl] Paul Batteiger of The Metal Crypt website noted they "tend to write really long songs that are just a little bit proggy without straying out of pure metal territory — they don't overuse keys, they don't go nuts with the solos, they just write long songs filled with heavy riffs".[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.metalcrypt.com/pages/review.php?revid=4574 | title = Vespertilium Review | last = Batteiger | first = Paul | publisher = The Metal Crypt (Michel Renaud) | date = 11 February 2009 | accessdate = 20 August 2013 [/tpl]

Significant changes for the album Ageless Decay are the artwork by Dimitar Nikolov and the mixing and mastering by Tommy Hansen. The team of Hodges and Smith continue to gain attention to their songwriting abilities. Ageless Decay is distributed by Escape Music.
