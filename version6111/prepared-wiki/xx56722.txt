The title comes from graffiti in Kingston, Ontario, which read "The Hip live between us." This graffiti was penned by early band member Davis Manning,Copper Penny describing the impact that the band was having on his relationship with his girlfriend. The mural remained on the wall until the mid-2000s when it was painted over by the property owner.
