Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond (1430[tpl]contradiction-inline |reason=infobox says 1431|date=September 2013[/tpl] – 1 or 3 November 1456), also known as Edmund of Hadham (Welsh: Edmwnd Tudur), was the father of King Henry VII of England and a member of the Tudor family of Penmynydd, North Wales.

==Birth and early life==

Edmund Tudor was born either at Much Hadham Palace in Hertfordshire or at Hadham in Bedfordshire, an older son of Owen Tudor and Catherine of Valois (widow of King Henry V of England).  It is not known for certain whether he was born legitimately after his parents were secretly married.
In 1436, his mother retired to Bermondsey Abbey where she died in 1437. Therefore he and his brother Jasper were brought up in the care of Katherine de la Pole, abbess of Barking, with whom they remained till 1442. The abbess then brought them to Henry VI's notice, who in turn sent them over as the charges of certain priests to be educated.Edmund Tudor, Duke of Richmond, father of Henry VII, paternal grandfather of Arthur, Margaret, Henry, and Mary Tudor | Flickr – Condivisione di foto! When Edmund grew up, Henry kept him at his court. Edmund was knighted on 15 December 1449, summoned to parliament as Earl of Richmond on 30 January 1452, and created Earl of Richmond and premier earl on 6 March, acceding on 23 November, and Jasper was created Earl of Pembroke. In the parliament of 1453 Edmund was formally declared legitimate. Henry made him large grants, particularly in 1454.

==Lineage==

==Marriage to Margaret Beaufort==

In 1452 Lady Margaret Beaufort, the nine-year-old daughter of the Duke of Somerset was summoned to the court of her second cousin, King Henry and the following year Edmund was granted wardship. On 1 November 1455 at Bletsoe Castle, she was married to Edmund. By the end of the following November, he was dead, leaving his 13-year-old widow pregnant with the future King Henry VII.

==Capture, captivity and death==

The Wars of the Roses had begun and Edmund (a Lancastrian) was captured by Yorkist partisan William Herbert in mid-1456. Herbert imprisoned him at Carmarthen Castle in South Wales, where he died of the plague on 3 November 1456, and was buried at Carmarthen Grey Friars. His elegy was written by Lewys Glyn Cothi. His remains were, at the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539, removed to the choir of St David's Cathedral.
Edmund's only child, the future Henry VII, was born at Pembroke Castle, almost three months after his death.
