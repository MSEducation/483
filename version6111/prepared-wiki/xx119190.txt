Westwood Manor is a 15th-century manor house with 16th century additions and 17th century plaster-work situated near Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire, England. It is the former home of Edgar Lister, a diplomat at the Ottoman court in the early years of the 20th century. The home contains fine furniture, musical instruments, and tapestries collected by Edgar Lister between 1911 and 1956, when he died in a car crash.  He restored the house throughout and adorned the garden with topiary; he was also an expert in needlepoint and upholstered much of its furniture in Florentine work.  Westwood Manor has been in the ownership of the National Trust since 1956.
Westwood Manor is occupied by a tenant, who administers it on behalf of the National Trust, and is open to the public a few days of the week in the summer.
