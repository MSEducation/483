==Cricket development==

New Zealand Cricket has established High Performance Cricket training centre based at Lincoln University. It also operates a grassroots development programme for school children called 'MILO Kiwi Cricket'. John Wright, former NZ opening batsman, was appointed acting high performance manager for NZC in November 2007 before taking up the Head Coach position in December 2010.
Former Australian Coach John Buchanan was appointed as NZC Director of Cricket in May 2011 as the architect of our new high performance programme. He will perform a number of key duties including the establishment of clear and consistent national coaching philosophies, implement a talent identification programme and oversee the Selection Panel.
New Zealand has many private cricket academies. The Bracewell Cricket Academy based at Rathkeale College is one of the largest cricket academies, providing an Overseas Cricket Development Programme, a Pre-Season Coaching Camp and a Festival of Cricket.
There are over 100,000 registered cricketers in New Zealand. By way of comparison, Australia and the UK have around 500,000 each.how many cricket players are there throughout the UK[ref]Hot for it

According to Mark O'Neill, New Zealand's batting coach from 2007â€“09, the competition at club level in NZ is nowhere near as intense as in Australia.
 
 "In Sydney there are 20 first grade teams, each club has five grades. To get to first grade you've got to be a friggin' good player and once you get there the competition is very, very fierce. Unfortunately it's not the same standard NZ. Competition is everything and the only way the New Zealand guys are going to get that is to play the world's best players."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/black-caps/news/article.cfm?c_id=128&objectid=10487598 |title=Cricket: The Aussie with hard words for our top order |author=Barclay, Chris |date=19 January 2008 |agency=NZPA |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=30 October 2011[/tpl]

==Domestic competition==

===Teams===

New Zealand Cricket involves the following first-class teams:

==Funding==

New Zealand Cricket derives most of its revenue from the sale of two types of broadcasting rights.
Host nations pick up all the expenses of touring teams, but get sole access to all broadcast rights and gate receipts.
In November 2007 it was announced that NZC had made a 5-year deal for the broadcasting rights to home internationals for NZ$65.4m with Sony Entertainment Television. The previous four-year deal between NZC and ESPN-Star was for only NZ$14.4m. Part of the 5-fold increase in value is due to the Indian team's tour of NZ in 2009.
Immediately prior to the 2009 Indian tour of NZ the Sunday Star Times reported that "NZ Cricket hits $25m jackpot".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/1753399 |title=NZ Cricket hits $25m jackpot |author=Donaldson, Michael |date=21 February 2009 |work=The Sunday Star-Times |accessdate=30 October 2011[/tpl]
The article claimed that NZ Cricket will get $1 million for each of the 22 days the Indians take the field and that NZ Cricket had insured against loss of income for the sale of TV rights due to bad weather. NZC boss Justin Vaughan also said that a tour by India generates "many times" more income than tours by Australia, South Africa and England and that the Indian tour was worth more to NZC than the payout from the Cricket World Cup, which was around $20m.
The article also states that over the past two years, NZC's income has been around $30m, but this year (2009)[tpl]update after|2009|12|31[/tpl] Vaughan is hoping to get more than $40 million from broadcast rights, sponsorship and ticket sales.
In 2007, the ICC sold the rights to broadcast the World Cup, the Champions Trophy and the ICC World Twenty20 to ESPN Star Sports until 2015 for US$1 billion. NZC will receive a slice of that.

==Partnership with USA Cricket (2010)==

On 19 December 2010, after months of negotiations, New Zealand Cricket announced it had signed a business deal with USACA which would see New Zealand play a certain amount of games in the USA and also make its players available to participate in any Twenty20 leagues in the USA. A new company was created called Cricket Holdings America LLC. This new company will hold the rights to hold Twenty20 leagues within the United States. New Zealand Cricket chief Justin Vaughan said he was happy with the development because New Zealand was a small market and to exploit a USA market will allow New Zealand Cricket to secure its funding in the long-term and will also allow cricket to develop popularity as a game in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/usa/content/story/493372.html|title=USA Cricket News: USA and New Zealand sign deal to promote cricket|last=Penna|first=Peter Della|date=December 19, 2010|work=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=22 August 2013[/tpl]
