The rail crossing of the Connecticut River (United States) at this location originates from the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad. The V&MRR was chartered in 1844 and completed an extension between Millers Falls, Massachusetts and Brattleboro, Vermont by 1850. Alvah Crocker, a paper and railroad magnate and U.S. Representative, was the first president of the V&MRR.[tpl]cite book | last = Wheelwright | first = William Bond | title = Life and Times of Alvah Crocker | origyear = 1923 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=PEvLpHD1Zs0C | year = 1981 | publisher = Ayer Publishing | isbn = 0-405-13822-9[/tpl] Initially, the V&MRR was operated by Crocker's Fitchburg Railroad.
