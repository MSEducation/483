==History==

Kamimita Station was originally designed as a place for cars to stop, but with the gasoline rationing during World War II, the station was closed. After the war, the local citizens began a drive to reopen the station, and finally did so using privately raised funds. Because of this, the station is known for its story of "resurrection" through the efforts of the local residents.

==Station building and platforms==

Kamimita Station features one raised platform capable of handling one line. The station building is a small wooden structure located down a short hill from the platform.
