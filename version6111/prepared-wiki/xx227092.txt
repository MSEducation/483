Games in the New Play Control! series feature a number of enhancements, most notably the implementation of Wii controls with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk,[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/915/915529p1.html|title=First Look: Wii de Asobu Pikmin|author=John Tanaka|date=October 2, 2008|accessdate=October 5, 2008|publisher=IGN[/tpl] as well as the inclusion of widescreen support and enhanced graphics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/915/915548p2.html|title=Presenting the "Play it on Wii Selection"|author=Lucas M.

==Background==

Nintendo initially announced the Wii de Asobu Selection range of titles in a presentation on October 2, 2008, confirming Pikmin and Donkey Kong Jungle Beat would launch later in the year,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.n-europe.com/news.php?nid=12395|title=GameCube Titles Heading To Wii|author=Tom Phillips|date=October 2, 2008|accessdate=May 30, 2012|publisher=N-Europe[/tpl] whilst a spokesperson for Nintendo of Europe confirmed days later that the series would also launch in Europe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.n-europe.com/news.php?nid=12398|title=GameCube Remakes Also In Europe|author=Nathan Whincup|date=October 2, 2008|accessdate=May 30, 2012|publisher=N-Europe[/tpl] In Japan, Pikmin and Donkey Kong Jungle Beat launched in December 2008 and were followed throughout 2009 by Mario Tennis GC, Pikmin 2, Chibi-Robo! and Metroid Prime 2: Dark Echoes. In the same year, New Play Control! launched in Europe, North America and Australia, though not all games were made available worldwide: Pikmin 2 did not launch in North America until June 2012, when it was released as a Nintendo Selects title instead of a New Play Control! title;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com.au/index.php?action=catalogue&prodcat_id=43&prod_id=19399&pageID=4|title=NEW PLAY CONTROL! PIKMIN 2 - Nintendo Games|publisher=Nintendo.com.au[/tpl] Chibi-Robo! was never released outside Japan.

==Changes==

Pikmin and Pikmin 2 allow players to point and click with the Wii Remote to select and direct units. Mario Power Tennis draws on the swinging motions seen in Wii Sports to perform various swings, while it is also possible to move the character with the control stick if the Nunchuk is attached. Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes use the same control functions as first seen in Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. An early prototype of the control scheme had already been used with a technical demo version of Metroid Prime 2, first seen when the Wii Remote was initially announced.
Other changes have been made to the games other than the updated controls and improved graphics. Donkey Kong Jungle Beat features new levels and modified level design for existing levels to give the game a more traditional platforming feel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/929/929327p1.html|title=New Elements for Play it on Wii Selection Titles|date=November 12, 2008|accessdate=November 12, 2008|publisher=IGN[/tpl] Pikmin allows players to rollback their game saves to previous days, erasing only a recent part of the save file, though this did not carry over to Pikmin 2.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/937/937178p1.html|title=New Features for Wii Pikmin and Mario Tennis|date=December 10, 2008|accessdate=December 12, 2008|publisher=IGN[/tpl] Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes feature some of the features introduced in Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, including the achievements system, unlockable content and the ability to take screenshots.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2009/experience_samus_story_like_never_before_as_metroid_prime_trilogy_comes_to_wii_14125.html|title=Experience Samus’ story like never before as Metroid Prime Trilogy comes to Wii|date=July 9, 2009|publisher=Nintendo.co.uk[/tpl]

==Release==

Four of the games - Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, Mario Power Tennis, Pikmin and Pikmin 2 -  have been universally released as New Play Control! titles. The two Metroid Prime games were bundled with Metroid Prime 3: Corruption and released in the limited edition Metroid Prime: Trilogy compilation, which launched in 2009 and was given only one print run, being discontinued soon after release.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/metroid-prime-trilogy-discontinued-in-uk|title=Metroid Prime: Trilogy discontinued in UK|author=Robert Purchese|date=January 11, 2010|accessdate=May 30, 2012|publisher=Eurogamer[/tpl] Pikmin 2, which was released in Japan, Europe and Australia in 2009, was not released in North America until June 2012, when it and Mario Power Tennis were released as budget titles in the Nintendo Selects range; these versions of the games do not feature reversible cover art or the New Play Control! moniker, instead being marketed as classic Nintendo GameCube titles with enhanced Wii controls.
Each game in the New Play Control! series features a standard cover art, explaining the premise of the series, as well as each game's original Nintendo GameCube cover art. Each game's cover art is reversible; reversing the cover shows the original version of the cover art with no New Play Control! branding, except on the game's logo.
