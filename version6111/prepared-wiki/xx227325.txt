Stylish Century was a notable Australian thoroughbred racehorse.
A son of Double Century from the Forex mare Stylish he was foaled in 1986 and was trained by a number of trainers throughout his career including Bart Cummings for a short time.
Known for his bold, front-running style he won quality races like the 1989 AJC Spring Champion Stakes, VRC Victoria Derby and the 1991 AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes. As a 3-year old he also ran a close second to Almaarad in the 1989 MVRC W.S. Cox Plate.
He ran in the 1990 Japan Cup, won by David Hayes' Better Loosen Up.  
Stylish Century broke through the barrier and bolted prior to the race and was timed at a near world record pace for a 1000m before being vetted and declared fit to run.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] He ran a great race to lead them up well into the home straight and was by no means the last to cross the finish line.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
Retired to stud, he only had moderate success with his best performer being Buster Jones winner of the 1999 VATC Sandown Stakes.
He died in 2003 following a spider bite.
