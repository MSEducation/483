==Geography and territory==

Ruvo's territory is known for its vineyards, Olive groves and sowable fields, and is one of the largest in the province of Bari. Very interesting is its wooded area, with many downy oak trees (Quercus pubescens) and a considerable underwood. Ruvo's territory is comprised in the Italian Alta Murgia National Park and shows typical elements of the Apulian karst landscape: sinkholes, karst valleys also known as "lame", among which we mention the upper course of Lama Balice and various caves. Two important caves to mention are the "Grave della Ferratella" (the deepest cave in the Apulia region), and the nearby "Abisso di Notarvincenzo" (the deepest in Ruvo). They are located near the wide and green Ferratella "Lama" (valley) which has to be considered as the Gate of the National Park af Alta Murgia.

The most ancient archaeological findings from the area date to the 9th century BC. In the 3rd century BC it commerced with the Greater Greece, Etruria and Greece.
