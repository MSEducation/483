In previous periods, the Federal Reserve has used other debt instruments, such as debt securities issued by private corporations. During periods when the national debt of the United States has declined significantly (such as happened in fiscal years 1999 and 2000), monetary policy and financial markets experts have studied the practical implications of having "too little" government debt: both the Federal Reserve and financial markets use the price information, [[yield curve]] and the so-called [[risk free rate]] extensively.<ref>Thomas Palley, [http://www.thomaspalley.com/docs/articles/macro_policy/rethinking_surplusses.pdf "The Case Against Budget Surpluses]," Challenge, Nov. - Dec., 2001, 13 - 27: "...the interest rate payable on government debt establishes the pure risk free interest rate that provides a benchmark for the entire system."</ref> 
Experts are hopeful that other assets could take the place of National Debt as the base asset to back Federal Reserve notes, and Alan Greenspan, long the head of the Federal Reserve, has been quoted as saying, "I am confident that U.S. financial markets, which are the most innovative and efficient in the world, can readily adapt to a paydown of Treasury debt by creating private alternatives with many of the attributes that market participants value in Treasury securities."[ref]
</ref> In principle, the government could still issue debt securities in significant quantities while having no net debt, and significant quantities of government debt securities are also held by other government agencies.
Although the U.S. government receives income overall from seigniorage, there are costs associated with maintaining the money supply.Joseph H. Haslag, 1998. "Seigniorage revenue and monetary policy: some preliminary evidence," Economic and Financial Policy Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, issue Q III, pages 10-20. Ecological economist, Herman Daly, claims that "over 95% of our broad money supply the United States is created by the private banking system (demand deposits) and bears interest as a condition of its existence," a conclusion drawn from the Federal Reserve's ultimate dependence on increased activity in fractional reserve lending when it exercises open market operations.[ref]

Thus, use of expansionary open market operations typically generates more debt in the private sector of society (in the form of additional bank deposits).[tpl]Cite journal|first=Guillermo A   |last=Calvo   | first2 = Carmen M   | last2 = Reinhart   |title=When Capital Inflows Come to a Sudden Stop: Consequences and Policy Options   |publisher=International Monetary Fund   |page=20   |url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/econ/ciecpp6.pdf   |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-02-04   |postscript= [/tpl]  The private banking system charges interest to borrowers as a cost to borrow the money.[ref]
.[/ref] The interest costs are borne by those that have borrowed, and without this borrowing, open market operations would be unsuccessful in maintaining the broad money supply, though alternative implementations of monetary policy could be used. Depositors of funds in the banking system are paid interest on their savings (or provided other services, such as checking account privileges or physical security for their "cash"), as compensation for "lending" their funds to the bank.
Increases (or contractions) of the money supply corresponds to growth (or contraction) in interest-bearing debt in the country. The concepts involved in monetary policy may be widely misunderstood in the general public, as evidenced by the volume of literature on topics such as "Federal Reserve conspiracy" and "Federal Reserve fraud."[ref]

==Uncertainties==

A few of the uncertainties involved in monetary policy decision making are described by the federal reserve:[tpl]harvnb|BoG|2005|pp=18–21[/tpl]

==Opinions of the Federal Reserve==

The Federal Reserve is lauded by some economists, while being the target of scathing criticism by other economists, legislators, and sometimes members of the general public. The former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Ben Bernanke, is one of the leading academic critics of the Federal Reserve's policies during the Great Depression.Joseph Mason, Ali Anari, and James Kolari, "THE STOCK OF CLOSED BANK DEPOSITS, DURATION OF CREDIT CHANNEL EFFECTS, AND THE PERSISTENCE OF THE U.S. GREAT DEPRESSION": "Since Ben Bernanke's (1983) seminal paper entitled "Nonmonetary Effects of the Financial Crisis in the Propagation of the Great Depression"...

===Achievements===

One of the functions of a central bank is to facilitate the transfer of funds through the economy, and the Federal Reserve System is largely responsible for the efficiency in the banking sector.  There have also been specific instances which put the Federal Reserve in the spotlight of public attention.  For instance, after the stock market crash in 1987, the actions of the Fed are generally believed to have aided in recovery.  Also, the Federal Reserve is credited for easing tensions in the business sector with the reassurances given following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States.[ref]

===Criticisms===

The Federal Reserve has been the target of various criticisms, involving: accountability, effectiveness, opacity, inadequate banking regulation, and potential market distortion. Federal Reserve policy has also been criticized for directly and indirectly benefiting large banks instead of consumers. For example, regarding the Federal Reserve's response to the 2007-2010 financial crisis, Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz explained how the U.S. Federal Reserve was implementing another monetary policy —creating currency— as a method to combat the liquidity trap.[tpl]cite news|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph|title=New $600B Fed Stimulus Fuels Fears of US Currency War|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/11/5/new_600b_fed_stimulus_fuels_fears|accessdate=5 November 2010|newspaper=Democracy Now|date=5 November 2010[/tpl] 
By creating $600 billion and inserting this directly into banks the Federal Reserve intended to spur banks to finance more domestic loans and refinance mortgages.  However, banks instead were spending the money in more profitable areas by investing internationally in emerging markets. Banks were also investing in foreign currencies which Stiglitz and others point out may lead to currency wars while China redirects its currency holdings away from the United States.[tpl]cite news|last=Wheatley|first=Jonathan|title=Brazil in 'currency war' alert|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/33ff9624-ca48-11df-a860-00144feab49a.html|accessdate=5 November 2010|newspaper=Financial Times|date=5 November 2010|author2=Peter Garnham[/tpl]

====Auditing====

The Federal Reserve is subject to different requirements for transparency and audits than other government agencies, which its supporters claim is another element of the Fed's independence. Although the Federal Reserve has been required by law to publish independently audited financial statements since 1999, the Federal Reserve is not audited in the same way as other government agencies. Some confusion can arise because there are many types of audits, including: investigative or fraud audits; and financial audits, which are audits of accounting statements; there are also compliance, operational, and information system audits.
The Federal Reserve's annual financial statements are audited by an outside auditor. Similar to other government agencies, the Federal Reserve maintains an Office of the Inspector General, whose mandate includes conducting and supervising "independent and objective audits, investigations, inspections, evaluations, and other reviews of Board programs and operations."FRB: OIG - Mission  The Inspector General's audits and reviews are available on the Federal Reserve's website.FRB: OIG - Complete List of OIG Reports - 2007[ref]
</ref>
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has the power to conduct audits, subject to certain areas of operations that are excluded from GAO audits; other areas may be audited at specific Congressional request, and have included bank supervision, government securities activities, and payment system activities.http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat5/150187.pdf Charles Bowsher, "Federal Reserve System Audits: Restrictions on GAO's Access", Statement by Charles Bowsher, Comptroller General of the United States, October 27, 1993.[ref]
