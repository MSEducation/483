Glasgow Roller Derby is a roller derby league based in Glasgow, Scotland.  Founded in 2007, the league has four teams, and two combined teams which compete with other leagues.

==History==

The league was founded as the Glasgow Roller Girls in February 2007, by Teri Toxic and Mistress Malicious.  It was the first league in Scotland, and the fourth in the United Kingdom (after the London Rollergirls, London Rockin Rollers and Birmingham Blitz Dames).  After initially practising in Kelvingrove Park, the league gained a regular slot at Glasgow Caledonian University, which has been their main bouting venue ever since.Sister Grimm, "GRG – the story so far", Glasgow Roller Girls

It won the first Scottish tournament, "Highland Fling", and contributed several skaters to Team Scotland for the Roller Derby World Cup in 2011, including its head coach.
