==Military career==

Baudach joined the Luftwaffe in 1940, and after completing flight training in 1941 was posted to JG 2, then serving in France.  Flying the Me 109, his first aerial victory was a Halifax bomber shot down on 24 July 1941.  By early 1944, Baudach had scored 13 victories, but transferred to Ekdo 262.  This unit, later renamed Kommando Nowotny after its commander Walter Nowotny, operated the Me 262 jet fighter.
On 22 February 1945, Baudach was shot down near Schönwalde in Me 262 A-1a (W.Nr. 110 781). He bailed out, but struck his head on the tail unit and subsequently died of his injuries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.luftwaffe.cz/baudach.html|title=Heinz-Helmut Baudach|publisher=Aces of the Luftwaffe|accessdate=07-09-2011[/tpl]
