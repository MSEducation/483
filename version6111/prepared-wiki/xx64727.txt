Mark Herron (8 July 1928 – 13 January 1996) was an American actor best known as the fourth husband of singer and actress Judy Garland. They were married on 14 November 1965 in Las Vegas, but they separated after 5 months of marriage apparently due to his homosexuality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodsgoldenage.com/actors/garland.html|title=Judy Garland, The Greatest Entertainer (1922-1969)|publisher=Hollywood's Golden Age[/tpl], Retrieved 2013-05-29. Seventeen months later, Garland was granted a divorce after testifying that Herron had beaten her. He said he had "only hit her in self defense."  He appeared in films such as Federico Fellini's 8½ and Eye of the Cat.
Fans of the cable TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000 may recall his performance in the film Girl in Gold Boots, in which he portrayed the greasy nightclub owner Leo McCabe.
Gerald Clarke, in his biography of Garland, Get Happy (2000) and in an interview about the book, reported that Herron had an affair with Tallulah Bankhead prior to meeting Garland. Biographies of Garland by David Shipman and Garland's daughter Lorna Luft -- Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir (1998)

Aside from providing biographer Gerold Frank information for his biography titled Judy (1975), Herron remained silent on the topic of Garland.  He continued acting, often appearing in summer stock productions.
Herron died of cancer in 1996, aged 67.
