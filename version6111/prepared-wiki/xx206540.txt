Nagaswami, Virupaksheeswarar Temple Notice Board Kulothunga Chola I invited Brahmins from conquered lands to settle in the village and gave large gifts of land to them. The Virupaksheeswarar temple at Serugudi was constructed by Rajaraja Chola II in about 1160 AD. A 12th century inscription found on a wall adjoining the Dakshinamoorthi shrine in the temple complex records the grant and mentions the name of the village as "Thannaru" and the name of the deity as "Thannarudaya Nayanar". The stone and mortar temple was built upon an older brick shrine centred around a vilva tree.  Rajaraja Chola II is also credited with the founding of a nearby shrine dedicated to Sithala Devi. Serugudi was also alternatively known as "Virupakshipuram".
The Virupaksheeswarar Temple was renovated and consecrated by Chandrashekarendra Saraswati, the Shankaracharya of Kanchi matha in 1949. An Ayyanar temple was constructed through private subscription in 1934.
