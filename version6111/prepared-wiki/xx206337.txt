==Early life==

Bushell was born at Harrow, Middlesex, the son of the Rev. William Done Bushell who for fifty years was an assistant master and Honorary chaplain at Harrow School, and also lord of the manor of Caldey Island, Pembrokeshire.  
He was educated at Charterhouse School and King's College, Cambridge, graduating BA and MA.

==Career==

Bushell's first post was as an assistant master at Gresham's School, Holt, from 1907 to 1912, after which he was Head of the Modern Side and a housemaster at Rossall School from 1912 to 1914. He returned to Rossall for two more years after serving in the Herefordshire Regiment in France and Palestine during the Great War of 1914-1918. 
In 1920 Bushell was appointed headmaster of Solihull School, where he founded the Old Silhillians' Association for former pupils. The Association continues today in rude health. The concert hall at Solihull School bears his name. He remained at Solihull School until 1927. At Solihull, his foresight was critical to the school's expansion at its present large urban site of some sixty-five acres (260,000 m²). In the 1920s, Bushell bought much of the land himself when the school's governors refused to do so. On his retirement, Bushell sold the land to the school at the price he had paid.Combridge, J. T., Warin Foster Bushell (obituary) in The Mathematical Gazette 109 (June 1975)
Upon leaving Solihull School, he went out for three years to South Africa as Rector of Michaelhouse, Natal, remaining until 1930. Finally, he was headmaster of Birkenhead School from 1930 to 1946.
