Bordeaux Cathedral (Cathédrale Saint-André de Bordeaux) is a Roman Catholic cathedral, seat of the Archbishop of Bordeaux-Bazas, located in Bordeaux.
The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Urban II in 1096. Of the original Romanesque edifice, only a wall in the nave remains. The Royal Gate is from the early 13th century, while the rest of the construction is mostly from the 14th-15th centuries. The building is a national monument of France.
In this church in 1137 the 13-year-old Eleanor of Aquitaine married the future Louis VII, a few months before she became Queen.
A separate bell tower, the Tour Pey-Berland, is next to the cathedral.
The site is served by line A and line B of the tramway de Bordeaux at Station Hôtel de Ville.
