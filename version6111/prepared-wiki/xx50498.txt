[[EFQM Excellence Model]]

CATEGORIES: Production and manufacturing, Quality

The EFQM Excellence Model is a non-prescriptive framework for organizational management systems, promoted by EFQM (formerly known as the European Foundation for Quality Management) and designed for helping organizations in their drive towards being more competitive.  The Model is regularly reviewed and refined: the last update was published in 2013.
Regardless of sector, size, structure or maturity, organizations need to establish appropriate management systems in order to be successful. The EFQM Excellence Model is a practical tool to help organizations do this by measuring where they are on the path to excellence; helping them understand the gaps; and then stimulating solutions.
