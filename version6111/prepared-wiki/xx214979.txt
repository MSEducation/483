Newropeans is a European political party running for  European Parliament elections in all European Union member states simultaneously. It therefore claims to be the first truly pan-European political party. As opposed to other European parties such as the European People's Party or the Party of European Socialists, the Newropeans are not an alliance of pre-existing national political parties.

==History==

The party was founded by Franck Biancheri in June 2005 when the referendum on the constitution failed. Biancheri had previously founded the European Students' Forum (AEGEE) in 1985 and a thinktank called Leap2020 in 1998.

==Policies==

Newropeans call for increased democratisation of the EU. They want an elected Union government, the ratification of changes to EU treaties by referendum and a unified immigration policy. Its programme is also in favour of decentralisation and restructuring of the institutions which are mainly concentrated in Brussels, but also spread among Strasbourg and Luxembourg. The party wants to ground the European Union Budget on a direct tax instead of contributions by the treasuries of member states, and opposes the lifelong judicial immunity granted to EU officials. According to the official website, the party focuses mainly on reform of the EU system, and has currently little agenda beyond that.

==Pre-election activities==

Like all newly established political parties, Newropeans works to gain attention, money and members. As stated in their manifesto, Newropeans has to establish itself in all EU members before the election in 2009. A "Democracy Marathon" has been launched in 2007, holding meetings in cities of all the 27 countries.
In the summer 2008, the Newropeans Summer Beach Campaign took place, promoting Newropeans on European beaches (in Italy, France, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Bulgaria, ...).

==Structure==

As it is currently impossible for a pan-European party to participate in European Parliament elections,http://www.newropeans.eu/spip.php?article=1191&lang=en national subsidiary parties of Newropeans need to be created in order for the Newropeans to stand for election. Little is known about the number of national subsidiary parties of Newropeans currently registered. The following overview lists the subsidiary parties currently known.

===Germany===

Newropeans needed to collect at least 4,000 signatures to be able to stand for election in Germany.

Formal recognition that Newropeans is registered for the election in 2009 was given on 10 April.http://www.newropeans.eu/index.php?lang=de
