Sylvain Lazarus (born 1943) is a French sociologist, anthropologist and political theorist. He has also written under the pseudonym Paul Sandevince. Lazarus is a Professor at the Paris 8 University.

==Life and work==

Sylvain Lazarus worked out a theory of the social function of political categorizations (cf. The Anthropology of the Name, 1996), exploring in the anthropological field what his Lacanian friends Alain Badiou (Being and Event, 1988) and Jean-Claude Milner (The Indistinct Names, 1983) worked out, respectively, in the fields of philosophy, of linguistics and of psychoanalytic theory.
Lazarus's 1996 book 'Anthropologie du nom' (The Anthropology of the Name) has not yet been translated into English. It was discussed at length by Alain Badiou in his Abrégé de Métapolitique (1998), now translated into English as Metapolitics (2005).

===L'Organisation Politique===

Following the student uprisings of May 1968 in France, Lazarus was a founding member of the Union des communistes de France marxiste-léniniste (UCFml). To quote Badiou himself, the UCFml is "the Maoist organization established in late 1969 by Natacha Michel, Sylvain Lazarus, myself and a fair number of young people".[tpl]cite book |last=Badiou |first=Alain |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others=translated by David Macey and Steve Corcoran |title=The Communist Hypothesis |origdate= |year=2010 |month= |url= |type=pbk |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |publisher=Verso |location= |isbn=978-1-84467-600-2 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=58 |chapter=Part I: "We Are Still the Contemporaries of May '68"|chapterurl= |quote= [/tpl] Fifteen years later, Lazarus was a founding member (along with Badiou and Michel) of the militant French political organisation "L'Organisation Politique"The following was the organisation's website at http://www.orgapoli.net/. According to the (linked above)French Wikipedia page, this organization dissolved in 2007 which called itself a post-party organization concerned with direct popular intervention in a wide range of issues (including immigration, labor, and housing). In addition to numerous writings and interventions since the 1980s, L'Organisation Politique has stressed the importance of developing political prescriptions concerning undocumented migrants (in France referred to as les sans papiers) and stresses that they must be conceived primarily as workers and not immigrants.

===International Observatory on Suburbs and Outskirts===

Since the 1990s, Sylvain Lazarus focus his works on the French suburbs (the banlieues). With the French anthropologist Alain Bertho, he has founded in 2008 l'Observatoire international des banlieues et des périphéries (OIBP) and produces researches in France, Brazil and Senegal.
