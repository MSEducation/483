==Plot==

The story centers around the relationship between Rena and Tomoya. Rena is your not-so-typical high school student because she is also a popular manga artist, who while drawing love scenes, bumps into also popular Tomoya. She quickly runs away from him but forgets her draft in the process. But when her publisher mentions that she doesn't put enough feeling into her works, she decides that she wants to improve her manga artist career by getting some hands-on experience in love.  She goes back to find her work and discovers that Tomoya now knows she is a manga artist.  While there, she asks him to become her boyfriend to help her with her manga.  Tomoya agrees and a few days later a jealous girl tries to hurt Rena when Tomoya takes her out for a date.  He rescues her and takes her to his house.  Later on, Rena sees him with another girl and thinks Tomoya doesn't want to be her boyfriend anymore, not realizing that the girl is his older sister.  She starts avoiding him and soon Tomoya is becoming annoyed.  A few days later he demands to know what happened.  She then publicly professes her love to him.  A few weeks after that, one of Rena's manga has the opportunity to be a drama on television.  Her manager asks Rena to ask Tomoya about being an actor in the movie.  He agrees to have a look, and ends up securing the role. In the middle of the filming, Rena becomes upset that Tomoya is being intimate with another girl, even though it's only acting.  Tomoya assures her that he will never leave her.
A few months later, Rena and Tomoya go on a trip together.  Rena starts pressuring Tomoya about sex, but Tomoya refuses her pleads rather coldly.  Later he goes to her room and assures her that he will have sex with her one day in the future.  After a few weeks, Rena tries calling Tomoya, only to hear a girl on the phone saying she is going to take a shower with Tomoya.  Worried, Rena rushes over to Tomoya's house.  There she meets Shiori, a relative of Tomoya.  Shiori says that she will marry Tomoya in the future, which makes Rena extremely jealous.  When Rena brings up the subject of Tomoya and her next date, Tomoya agrees to Shiori's pleading to come along.  Rena objects to this loudly and then runs home.  The next day Tomoya and Rena go on their date as planned, but Shiori cries when she is ignored.  When Tomoya tries to calm her down, Shiori's father arrives and invites Shiori to go home with him.  After some persuading from Tomoya, Shiori leaves with her father.  A few days after that incident, Rena's parents get her a tutor who turns out to be Tomoya's ex-girlfriend.  Rena soon becomes jealous and when Tomoya tries to calm her down, she shoves him away and runs off.  Later Tomoya visits her and brings her to a chapel where he proposes to her.  Rena says yes and they get married in the chapel, bringing the story to an end.  There is also a chapter featuring them as adults with children.
