David James Bancroft (April 20, 1891 – October 9, 1972) was an American baseball shortstop and manager. Nicknamed "Beauty" for his penchant for calling good pitches "beauties", he played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1915 to 1930, for the Philadelphia Phillies, New York Giants, Boston Braves, and Brooklyn Robins.
Born in Sioux City, Iowa, Bancroft played in minor league baseball from 1909 through 1914, at which point he was bought by the Phillies. The Giants traded for Bancroft during the 1920 season. After playing for the Giants through the 1923 season, he became player-manager of the Braves, serving in that role for four years. After he was fired by the Braves, Bancroft played two seasons for the Robins and ended his playing career with the Giants the next season. He coached with the Giants, then managed in the minor leagues and the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.
Bancroft was part of the Giants' World Series championship teams in 1921 and 1922. He was also a part of the National League pennant-winning teams of 1915 and 1923. Considered an excellent defensive shortstop and a smart ball player, Bancroft was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1971. However, his election was not without controversy, as the Veterans Committee included former teammates of Bancroft, resulting in charges of cronyism against the Veterans Committee.

==Early life==

Bancroft was born in Sioux City, Iowa, the youngest of three children of Ella (née Gearhart) and Frank Bancroft. Frank worked as a news vendor on the Milwaukee Railroad.[tpl]cite web|first=Trey|last=Strecker |url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/8822919c |title=Dave Bancroft |publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=April 27, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/19540328/SPORTS11/50623012/Dave-Bancroft-Sioux-City-1954|title=Dave Bancroft, Sioux City|first=Bert|last=McGrane|newspaper=The Des Moines Register|date=March 28, 1954|accessdate=October 10, 2012[/tpl] Bancroft attended Hopkins Grade School and Sioux City High School.

==Career==

===Early career===

In the summer after his junior year of high school, at the age of 18, Bancroft began his professional career in 1909 with the Duluth White Sox of the Class-D Minnesota-Wisconsin League. Bancroft did not have immediate success, registering a .210 batting average and .917 fielding percentage in 111 games, but he developed a positive reputation in the league. The Superior Blues acquired Bancroft at midseason, and he remained there through the 1911 season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o0UxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zSEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5316,6443177&dq=dave-bancroft&hl=en|title=Dave Bancroft Leaves Giants|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|agency=Associated Press|page=2|date=June 4, 1932|accessdate=June 19, 2012[/tpl] Bancroft finished the 1911 season with a .273 batting average and 41 stolen bases, and the Blues won the league championship.
The Portland Beavers of the Class-AA Pacific Coast League (PCL) drafted Bancroft from Superior for the 1912 season. He struggled in 1912, batting .207, and was demoted to the Portland Colts of the Class-B Northwestern League in 1913. After batting .244 for the Colts, he was promoted back to the Beavers in 1914, where he batted .271 and drew comparisons to former Beavers star shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh as the team won the PCL championship. While with the Beavers, Bancroft earned the nickname "Beauty", for his habit of referring to pitches as "beauties" while he batted.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PMdOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EU0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6859,3059354&dq=dave-bancroft&hl=en|title=Dave Bancroft Acclaimed As Latest "Miracle Man"|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|page=9|date=September 23, 1925|accessdate=June 26, 2012[/tpl]

====Philadelphia Phillies====

Before the 1915 season, the Philadelphia Phillies purchased Bancroft from Portland for $5,000 ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|5000|1915[/tpl][/tpl] in current dollar terms).
