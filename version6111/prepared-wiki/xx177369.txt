==History==

Originally built in 1921-22 by H. L. Stevens & Company as the Ruskin Apartments, an annex facing Bellefield Avenue was added in 1925-26. The building has long seen usage by Pitt students, including use as the meeting place of the Omega Delta fraternity until the fall of 1926.http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittyearbooks;cc=pittyearbooks;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=ruskin%20apartments;rgn=full%20text;idno=1929e49702;didno=1929e49702;view=image;seq=0168   Pitt purchased the Ruskin Apartments in February 1958 for $2.24 million ($[tpl]formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|2240000|1958[/tpl][/tpl] in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] dollars[tpl]inflation-fn|US[/tpl]) as an investment, with the intention of using it eventually for faculty residences.  Following the purchase, Pitt Chancellor Edward Litchfield held a tea for the 189 remaining tenants, many of whom were elderly, well-to-do widows, to ensure them that their leases and the staff and management would be maintained as long as they wished to stay.  http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=ruskin%20apartments;rgn=full%20text;idno=00c50130m;didno=00c50130m;view=image;seq=0284
With time, the apartments were relinquished giving Pitt full control of the building. 
In 1966, Richard King Mellon donated $1,075,475 ($[tpl]formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|1075475|1966[/tpl][/tpl] in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] dollars[tpl]inflation-fn|US[/tpl]) to the University to refinance and retain possession of the Ruskin Apartments so they could be used for members of the house staffs of the University-affiliated hospitals and their families.http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=ruskin%20apartments;rgn=full%20text;idno=00c50130m;didno=00c50130m;view=image;seq=0364
Ruskin Hall has also served as the home for University offices including those of the University of Pittsburgh Press.http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&-format=d.html&-lay=a&-sortfield=issueid%3a%3aissuedate&-sortorder=descend&keywords=Ruskin%20Hall&-max=50&-recid=38414&-find=
Through 2007, Ruskin Hall served as the primary residence for medical students and PhD candidates in the basic sciences of medicine, although students of other medical-related schools (including dental, nursing, and pharmacy) could be wait-listed for apartments.http://www.pc.pitt.edu/housing/halls/ruskin.html Beginning in the summer of 2007, medical student housing was replaced by the Darragh Street Medical Student Housing complex, allowing for a $19.4 million renovation by Graves Design Group to convert Ruskin Hall into undergraduate apartment-style housing was completed for fall 2008.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06101/681145-53.stm | title=Pitt planning new residence halls | date=2006-04-11 | first=Bill | last=Schackner | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | location=Pittsburgh, PA | accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gravesdesigngroup.com/ruskin_hall.php | title=Ruskin Hall Dormitory Residential Building Design | publisher=Graves Design Group, LLC | accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl]
