[[Chenopodiaceae]]

CATEGORIES: Amaranthaceae, Plant taxonomy, Historically recognized angiosperm families

Chenopodiaceae were a family of flowering plants, also called the Goosefoot Family. Although widely recognized in most plant classifications (notably the Cronquist system), the more recent gene-based APG system (1998) and the APG II system (2003) have included these plants in the family Amaranthaceae on the basis of evidence from molecular phylogenies: they are a paraphyletic group, so that for a monophyletic taxon, merger with Amaranthaceae sensu stricto was needed.
For any further information, please see main article Amaranthaceae (sensu lato) and the subfamily articles (Betoideae, Camphorosmoideae, Chenopodioideae, Corispermoideae, Polycnemoideae, Salicornioideae, Salsoloideae, and Suaedoideae).
