CATEGORIES: Piperidines, Amides

''N''-Formylpiperidine is an organic compound with the formula C6H11NO. It is the amide of formic acid and piperidine. It can be used as a polar aprotic solvent, with better hydrocarbon solubility than other amide solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF).[tpl]cite book |title=Kirk‑Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology |chapter=Pyridine and Pyridine Derivatives |author=Eric F.
