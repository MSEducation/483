==Biography==

===Gods of Vermin (2007 - 2010)===

The band was founded in January 2007. Up to that point, Oliver Palotai, Daniel Schild and Luca Princiotta were still members of BLAZE, the band of Iron Maiden's former singer Blaze Bayley. Disagreeing with the methods of BLAZE's new management, the whole line-up decided to quit.
That was the perfect moment for Oliver Palotai to lay the foundations of his new project. He aimed at a line-up that consisted of great musicians, who would work as a team for many upcoming years. The first two members to join were Princiotta and Schild, in spring 2007. The following summer, bass player JÃ¼rgen Steinmetz joined the trio.
The biggest challenge during the initial songwriting process was to bring that special craft of metal, jazz and classical music together.
Later that summer, Tijs Vanneste joined as a singer. However, the bands' future touring plans didn't fit his tight working schedule, thus he left.
The new and final vocalist, Henning Basse, met with Oliver Palotai during Kamelot's tour in Japan. Palotai got in contact with Basse at the end of 2007 and introduced the song material. Basse immediately saw common musical ground and started adding his ideas to the material. The band aims at blending its own, special style, using symphonic and progressive metal elements. Luca Princiotta left the band in November 2008 following a meeting with Oliver Palotai where both parties agreed that it was in the best interest of all concerned that they'd part ways due to schedule problems. He was replaced by Pepe Pierez.
The band started touring in 2009 and released their debut album Gods of Vermin in the same year, and spent 2010 and 2011 touring with bands such as Kamelot and Rage.

===Magnisphyricon===

On January 22, 2011, the band announced on their MySpace and website that they were to release a new album on April 1. The new album is to be called Magnisphyricon, and is according to the band "not a mere continuation of the chosen path, but rather a bold step into unexplored musical territories". The album will feature a guest appearance Simone Simons (Epica), who also appeared on Gods of Vermin.MySpace - Sons of Seasons: New Album Details: Title, Tracklist, Cover Artwork and Release Date
