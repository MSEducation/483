[[United States Alien Terrorist Removal Court]]

CATEGORIES: United States federal courts, United States immigration law

The U.S. Alien Terrorist Removal Court is a special court consisting of five Article III judges, selected by the Chief Justice of the United States. Its job is to determine whether aliens (non-citizens) should be deported from the United States on the grounds that they are terrorists.
As of 1996, when it was formed, the original judges on the Court were Chief Judge Earl H. Carroll (D. Ariz.), and Judges Michael Anthony Telesca (W.D. N.Y.), David Dudley Dowd, Jr. (N.D. Ohio), William Clark O'Kelley (N.D. Ga.) and Alfred M. Wolin (D. N.J.).
According to Karen Redmond, a public information officer in the Administrative Offices of the U.S. Courts, as of February 10, 2014, the current members of the Court are: James C. Cacheris (VA-E), Chief Judge; Harold Albert Baker (IL-C); David D. Dowd (OH-N); William C. O'Kelley (GA-N); and Michael A. Telesca (NY-W).
The Court is modeled after the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and was created by [tpl]USPL|104|132[/tpl], the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, enacted as [tpl]USC|8|1531|1537[/tpl].
As of 2012, the Court had allegedly never been used.
