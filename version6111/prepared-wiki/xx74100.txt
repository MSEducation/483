[[Jesus in Christianity]]

CATEGORIES: Christology, Perspectives on Jesus

Christian views of Jesus are based on the teachings and beliefs outlined in the Canonical gospels, New Testament letters, and the Christian creeds. These outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life. The second sentence in the ICET version of the Nicene Creed states: "We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God...". In the New Testament Jesus indicates that he is the Son of God by calling God his heavenly father.[tpl]Bibleref2c|Mt.|6:9[/tpl] One teacher: Jesus' teaching role in Matthew's gospel by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 ISBN 3-11-018151-7 pages 240-241
Christians consider Jesus the Christ and believe that through his death and resurrection, humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life.Oxford Companion to the Bible p.649 These teachings emphasize that as the willing Lamb of God, Jesus chose to suffer on the cross at Calvary as a sign of his full obedience to the will of the Eternal Father, as an "agent and servant of God".The Christology of Anselm of Canterbury by Dániel Deme 2004 ISBN 0-7546-3779-4 pages 199-200The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959 ISBN 0-664-24351-7 page 79 The choice Jesus made thus counter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to Adam's disobedience.Systematic Theology, Volume 2 by Wolfhart Pannenberg 2004 0567084663 ISBN pages 297-303
Most Christians believe that Jesus was both human and divine—the Son of God. While there has been theological debate over the nature of Jesus, Trinitarian Christians believe that Jesus is the Logos, God incarnate, God the Son, and "true God and true man"—both fully divine and fully human. Jesus, having become fully human in all respects, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not sin. As fully God, he defeated death and rose to life again. According to the Bible, God raised him from the dead.[tpl]bibleref2|Acts|2:24|NIV[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Romans|10:9|NIV[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|1Cor|15:15|NIV[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Acts|2:31-32[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:15[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:26[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|4:10[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:30[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|10:40-41[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:30[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:34[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:37[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|17:30-31[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|1Cor|6:14[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|2Cor|4:14[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Gal|1:1[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Eph|1:20[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Col|2:12[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|1Thess|1:10[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Heb|13:20[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|1Pet|1:3[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|1Pet|1:21[/tpl] He ascended to heaven to sit at the "Right Hand of God,"[tpl]bibleref2|Mark|16:19[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Luke|22:69[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Acts|2:33[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:31[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|7:55-56[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Romans|8:34[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Eph|1:20[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Col|3:1[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Hebrews|1:3[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|1:13[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|10:12[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|12:2[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|1Peter|3:22[/tpl] and he will return to earth again for the Last Judgment and the establishment of the Kingdom of God in the World to Come.[tpl]bibleref2|Acts|1:9-11[/tpl]

==Overview==

Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is possible to summarize key elements of the shared beliefs among major denominations based on their catechetical or confessional texts.Jackson, Gregory Lee, Catholic, Lutheran, Protestant: a doctrinal comparison 1993 ISBN 978-0-615-16635-3 Part One: "Areas of Agreement", pages 11-17The Orthodox Church: An Introduction to Its History, Doctrine by John Anthony McGuckin 2010 pages 6-7Basic Christian doctrine by John H. Leith 1993 ISBN 0-664-25192-7 pages 1-2 Christian views of Jesus are derived from various biblical sources, particularly from the canonical Gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline Epistles. Christians predominantly hold that these works are historically true.Second Vatican Council, Dei Verbum (V.19); Thomas Aquinas, Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses?; c.f. Catechism of the Catholic Church, §116; R.C. Sproul, Knowing Scripture pp. 45–61; Greg Bahnsen, A Reformed Confession Regarding Hermeneutics (art. 6); Scott Foutz,  Martin Luther and Scripture

Christians not only attach theological significance to the works of Jesus, but also to his name. Devotions to the name of Jesus go back to the earliest days of Christianity.Hunter, Sylvester. Outlines of dogmatic theology, Volume 2. 2010 ISBN 1-146-98633-5 p. 443Houlden, Leslie. Jesus: the Complete Guide, 2006. ISBN 0-8264-8011-X p. 426 These exist today both in Eastern and Western Christianity—both Catholic and Protestant.
Christians predominantly profess that through Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, he restored humanity's communion with God with the blood of the New Covenant. His death on a cross is understood as a redemptive sacrifice: the source of humanity's salvation and the atonement for sinCatechism of the Catholic Church §606–618; Council of Trent (1547) in Denzinger-Schönmetzer, Enchiridion Symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum (1965) §1529; [tpl]bibleref2|John|14:2–3[/tpl] which had entered human history through the sin of Adam.Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England, article 9; Augsburg Confession, article 2; Second Helvetic Confession, chapter 8; [tpl]bibleref2|Romans|5:12–21[/tpl]; [tpl]bibleref2|1Cor.|15:21–22[/tpl].

==Christ, Logos and Son of God==

Most Christians generally consider Jesus to be the Christ, the long awaited Messiah, as well as the one and only Son of God. The opening words in the Gospel of Mark (1:1), "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God", provide Jesus with the two distinct attributions as Christ and as the Son of God. His divinity is again re-affirmed in Mark 1:11.Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity by Larry W. Hurtado 2005 ISBN 0-8028-3167-2 page 288  Matthew 1:1 which begins by calling Jesus the Christ and in verse 16 explains it again with the affirmation: "Jesus, who is called Christ".
In the Letters of Saint Paul, the word "Christ" is so closely associated with Jesus that apparently for the early Christians there was no need to claim that Jesus was Christ, for that was considered widely accepted among them. Hence Paul could use the term Christos with no confusion about who it referred to, and as in 1 Corinthians 4:15 and Romans 12:5 he could use expressions such as "in Christ" to refer to the followers of Jesus.Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity by Larry W. Hurtado 2005 ISBN 0-8028-3167-2 page 99
In the New Testament, the title "Son of God" is applied to Jesus on many occasions.Catholic Encyclopedia: Son of God It is often used to refer to his divinity, from the beginning in the Annunciation up to the Crucifixion. The declaration that Jesus is the Son of God is made by many individuals in the New Testament, and on two separate occasions by God the Father as a voice from Heaven, and is asserted by Jesus himself.Dwight Pentecost The words and works of Jesus Christ 2000 ISBN 0-310-30940-9 page 234The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1988 ISBN 0-8028-3785-9 page 571-572
In Christology, the concept that the Christ is the Logos (i.e., "The Word") has been important in establishing the doctrine of the divinity of Christ and his position as God the Son in the Trinity as set forth in the Chalcedonian Creed. This derives from the opening of the Gospel of John, commonly translated into English as: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." In the original Greek, Logos (λόγος) is used for "Word," and in theological discourse, this is often left in its English transliterated form, "Logos".
The pre-existence of Christ refers to the doctrine of the personal existence of Christ before his conception. One of the relevant Bible passages is John 1:1-18 where, in the Trinitarian view, Christ is identified with a pre-existent divine hypostasis called the Logos or Word. This doctrine is reiterated in John 17:5 when Jesus refers to the glory which he had with the Father "before the world was" during the Farewell discourse.Creation and Christology by Masanobu Endo 2002 ISBN 3-16-147789-8 page 233 [tpl]Bibleref2|John|17:24[/tpl] also refers to the Father loving Jesus "before the foundation of the world". Non-Trinitarian views doubt the aspect of personal pre-existence or the aspect of divinity, or both.
Following the Apostolic Age, from the 2nd century forward, several controversies developed about how the human and divine are related within the person of Jesus.[tpl]Citation| last = Editors | first =  Erwin Fahlbusch| year = 1999| title = The encyclopedia of Christianity| pages = 463| url = http://books.google.com/?id=z47zgZ75dqgC&pg=PA463&dq=Logos+as+God+in+the+early+church| isbn = 0-8028-2413-7| publisher = Brill| location = Leiden, Netherland[/tpl][tpl]Citation| last = Rausch | first =  Thomas P.| year = 2003| title = Who is Jesus? : an introduction to Christology| pages = 149| url = http://books.google.com/?id=8OJCa6euw5gC&pg=PA148&dq=Justin+Martyr+christology| isbn = 0-8146-5078-3| publisher = Liturgical Press| location = Collegeville, Minn.[/tpl][tpl]Citation| last = McGrath | first =  Alister E.| year = 2007| title = Christian theology : an introduction| pages = 282| url = http://books.google.com/?id=tHlY94UWi3UC&pg=PA282&dq=Justin+Martyr+christology| isbn = 1-4051-5360-1| publisher = Blackwell| location = Malden, Mass. [/tpl] Eventually in 451, the concept of a Hypostatic union was decreed, namely that Jesus is both fully divine and fully human.Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, Vol XIV p207, translated edition by H.R.

==Incarnation, Nativity and Second Adam==

thumb|180px|Nativity of Jesus, by Geertgen tot Sint Jans, c. 1490[tpl]cquote2|He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible. — Colossians 1:15-16[/tpl]
The above verse from Colossians regards the birth of Jesus as the model for all creation.Bromiley, Geoffrey W. The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, 1988. ISBN 0-8028-3785-9Espín, Orlando O. and James B. Nickoloff.An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies, 2007. ISBN 0-8146-5856-3, p. 238Mills, Watson E. and Roger Aubrey Bullard. Mercer dictionary of the Bible, 1998. ISBN 0-86554-373-9. p. 712Ryrie, Charles C. Basic Theology:, 1999. ISBN 0-8024-2734-0.  p. 275
Apostle Paul viewed the birth of Jesus as an event of cosmic significance which brought forth a "new man" who undid the damage caused by the fall of the first man, Adam. Just as the Johannine view of Jesus as the incarnate Logos proclaims the universal relevance of his birth, the Pauline perspective emphasizes the birth of a new man and a new world in the birth of Jesus. Paul's eschatological view of Jesus counter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to Adam. Unlike Adam, the new man born in Jesus obeys God and ushers in a world of morality and salvation.
In the Pauline view, Adam is positioned as the first man and Jesus as the second: Adam, having corrupted himself by his disobedience, also infected humanity and left it with a curse as its inheritance. The birth of Jesus counterbalanced the fall of Adam, bringing forth redemption and repairing the damage done by Adam.Daille, Jean. An exposition of the epistle of Saint Paul to the Philippians, 1995. ISBN 0-8028-2511-7. pp. 194-195
In the 2nd century Church Father Irenaeus writes:
 
 "When He became incarnate and was made man, He commenced afresh the long line of human beings, and furnished us, in a brief, comprehensive manner, with salvation; so that what we had lost in Adam—namely to be according to the image and likeness of God- that we might recover in Christ Jesus."Bethune-Baker, James Franklin. An introduction to the early history of Christian doctrine, 2005. ISBN 1-4021-5770-3. p. 334Walker, Williston. A History of the Christian Church, 2010. ISBN 1-4400-4446-5. pp. 65-66

In patristic theology, Paul's contrasting of Jesus as the new man versus Adam provided a framework for discussing the uniqueness of the birth of Jesus and the ensuing events of his life. The Nativity of Jesus thus began to serve as the starting point for "cosmic Christology" in which the birth, life and Resurrection of Jesus have universal implications.Grillmeier, John Bowden. Christ in Christian Tradition: From the Apostolic Age to Chalcedon. Aloys, 1975. ISBN 0-664-22301-X. pp. 15-19Helyer, Larry R.  The Witness of Jesus, Paul and John: An Exploration in Biblical Theology, 2008. ISBN 0-8308-2888-5 p. 282 The concept of Jesus as the "new man" repeats in the cycle of birth and rebirth of Jesus from his Nativity to his Resurrection: following his birth, through his morality and obedience to the Father, Jesus began a "new harmony" in the relationship between God the Father and man. The Nativity and Resurrection of Jesus thus created the author and exemplar of a new humanity.Rahner, Karl. Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi, 2004. ISBN 0-86012-006-6. pp. 474 and 1434 In this view, the birth, death and Resurrection of Jesus brought about salvation, undoing the damage of Adam.Burke, Raymond L.; et al. (2008).

==Ministry==

In the Canonical gospels, the Ministry of Jesus begins with his Baptism in the countryside of Judea, near the River Jordan and ends in Jerusalem, following the Last Supper.McGrath, Alister E. Christianity: an introduction, 2006 ISBN 978-1-4051-0901-7. pp. 16-22 The Gospel of Luke (3:23) states that Jesus was "about 30 years of age" at the start of his ministry.Köstenberger, Andreas J., L.

Harmony of the Gospels, 2007  ISBN 0-8054-9444-8. p. 155-170 The gospels provide more details about the final ministry than the other periods, devoting about one third of their text to the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem.Turner, David L. Matthew, 2008. ISBN 0-8010-2684-9. p.613

==Teachings, parables and miracles==

In the New Testament the teachings of Jesus are presented in terms of his "words and works". The words of Jesus include several sermons, in addition to parables that appear throughout the narrative of the Synoptic Gospels (the gospel of John includes no parables). thumb|left|120px|A Gospel of John, 1056The works include the miracles and other acts performed during his ministry.
Although the Canonical Gospels are the major source of the teachings of Jesus, the Pauline Epistles, which were likely written decades before the gospels, provide some of the earliest written accounts of the teachings of Jesus.Blomberg,Craig L. Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey. B & H Academic, 2009. ISBN 0-8054-4482-3. pp. 441-442
The New Testament does not present the teachings of Jesus as merely his own teachings, but equates the words of Jesus with divine revelation, with John the Baptist stating in John 3:34: "For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit." and Jesus stating in John 7:16: “My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me".Osborn, Eric Francis. The Emergence of Christian Theology. Cambridge University Press, 1993. ISBN 978-0521430784  p.98Köstenberger, Andreas J. The missions of Jesus and the disciples according to the Fourth Gospel. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1998. ISBN 0-8028-4255-0 pages 108-109 In Matthew 11:27 Jesus claims divine knowledge, stating: "No one knows the Son except the Father and no one knows the Father except the Son", asserting the mutual knowledge he has with the Father.Talbert, Charles H. Matthew. Baker Academic, 2010. ISBN 0-8010-3192-3 p. 149

===Discourses===

The gospels include several discourses by Jesus on specific occasions, such as the Farewell discourse delivered after the Last Supper, the night before his crucifixion.O'Day, Gail R. , Susan Hylen. John (Westminster Bible Companion)  Westminster John Knox Press, 2006. ISBN 978-0-664-25260-1, Chapter 15: The Farewell Discourse, pages 142-168 Although some of the teachings of Jesus are reported as taking place within the formal atmosphere of a synagogue (e.g., in [tpl]Bibleref2|Matthew|4:23[/tpl]) many  of the discourses are more like conversations than formal lectures.Howick, E. Keith. The Sermons of Jesus the Messiah. WindRiver Publishing, 2003. ISBN 978-1-886249-02-8 pp. 7-9
The Gospel of Matthew has a structured set of sermons, often grouped as the Five Discourses of Matthew which present many of the key teachings of Jesus.Köstenberger, Andreas J.L. Scott Kellum, Charles L. Quarles. The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament. B&H Academic, 2009. ISBN 978-0-8054-4365-3. pp. 194-196Keener, Craig S. The Gospel of Matthew. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2009. ISBN 978-0-8028-6498-7. pp. 37-38 Each of the five discourses has some parallel passages in the Gospel of Mark or the Gospel of Luke.France, R.T. The Gospel of Matthew (New International Commentary on the New Testament). Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 2007. ISBN 978-0-8028-2501-8. p.9 The five discourses in Matthew begin with the Sermon on the Mount, which encapsulates many of the moral teaching of Jesus and which is one of the best known and most quoted elements of the New Testament.Vaught, Carl G. The Sermon on the Mount: a Theological Investigation. Baylor University Press; 2nd edition, 2001.

===Parables===

The parables of Jesus represent a major component of his teachings in the gospels, the approximately thirty parables forming about one third of his recorded teachings.Lockyer, Herbert. All the Parables of the Bible. Zondervan, 1988. ISBN 978-0-310-28111-5. p.174Pentecost, J. Dwight. The parables of Jesus: Lessons in Life from the Master Teacher. Zondervan, 1998. ISBN 0-8254-3458-0. p.10 The parables may appear within longer sermons, as well as other places within the narrative. Jesus' parables are seemingly simple and memorable stories, often with imagery, and each conveys a teaching which usually relates the physical world to the spiritual world.Lisco, Friedrich Gustav, and Patrick Fairbairn. The parables of Jesus Explained and Illustrated Volume 29. Nabu Press, 2010. ISBN 978-1149508398. pp.9-11Oxenden, Ashton. The parables of our Lord. William Macintosh Publishers, London, 1864. ASIN: B008RW5N2S. p.6
In the 19th century, Lisco and Fairbairn stated that in the parables of Jesus, "the image borrowed from the visible world is accompanied by a truth from the invisible (spiritual) world" and that the parables of Jesus are not "mere similitudes which serve the purpose of illustration, but are internal analogies where nature becomes a witness for the spiritual world". Similarly, in the 20th century, calling a parable "an earthly story with a heavenly meaning", William Barclay states that the parables of Jesus use familiar examples to lead others' minds towards heavenly concepts. He suggests that Jesus did not form his parables merely as analogies but based on an "inward affinity between the natural and the spiritual order."Barclay, William. The Parables of Jesus. Westminster John Knox Press, 1999. ISBN 0-664-25828-X p.12.

===Miracles of Jesus===

In Christian teachings, the miracles of Jesus were as much a vehicle for his message as were his words. Many of the miracles emphasize the importance of faith, for instance in cleansing ten lepers,[tpl]Bibleref2c|Lk|17:19[/tpl] Jesus did not say: "My power has saved you" but says "Rise and go; your faith has saved you."[tpl]cite book |last1=Marthaler |first1=Berard L. |last2= |first2= |title=The creed: the apostolic faith in contemporary theology |url= |accessdate= |year= |publisher=Twenty-Third Publications; 3rd Revised edition |location= |isbn= 0-89622-537-2|page=220[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1= Lockyer|first1=Herbert |last2= |first2= |title= All the Parables of the Bible|url= |accessdate= |year=1988 |publisher= Zondervan|location= |isbn=978-0-310-28111-5 |page=235[/tpl] Similarly, in the Walking on Water miracle, Apostle Peter learns an important lesson about faith in that as his faith wavers, he begins to sink.[tpl]bibleref2c|Mt|14:34-36[/tpl] [tpl]cite book |last1=Perkins |first1=Pheme |last2= |first2= |title=Reading the New Testament: An Introduction |url= |accessdate= |year=1988 |publisher=Paulist Press |location= |isbn=0-8091-2939-6 |page=54[/tpl]
One characteristic shared among all miracles of Jesus in the Gospel accounts is that he delivered benefits freely and never requested or accepted any form of payment for his healing miracles, unlike some high priests of his time who charged those who were healed. In Matthew 10:8 he advised his disciples to heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, and drive out demons without payment and stated: "Freely you have received; freely give".[tpl]cite book |last1=Blomberg |first1=Craig L.  |last2= |first2= |title=Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey |url= |accessdate= |year=2009 |publisher=B & H Academic |location= |isbn=0-8054-4482-3 |page=197[/tpl]
Christians in general believe that Jesus' miracles were actual historical events and that his miraculous works were an important part of his life, attesting to his divinity and the Hypostatic union, i.e., the dual natures of Christ's humanity and divinity in one hypostasis.Catholic Encyclopedia on Miracles Christians believe that while Jesus' experiences of hunger, weariness, and death were evidences of his humanity, the miracles were evidences of his deity.Lockyer, Herbert. All the Parables of the Bible. Zondervan, 1988. ISBN 978-0-310-28111-5. p.25Brande, William Thomas, George William Cox. A dictionary of science, literature, & art.

Christian authors also view the miracles of Jesus not merely as acts of power and omnipotence, but as works of love and mercy: they were performed to show compassion for sinful and suffering humanity. Authors Ken and Jim Stocker state that "every single miracle Jesus performed was an act of love".Stocker, Ken. Jim Stocker.  Facts, Faith, and the FAQs. Xulon Press, 2006. ISBN 978-1600347535. p.139 And each miracle involves specific teachings.Maguire, Robert. The Miracles of Christ. Ulan Press, 2012. ASIN: B009QMIYOW. p.133Wiersbe, Warren W.

Since according to the Gospel of John[tpl]Bibleref2c-nb|Jn|20:30[/tpl] it was impossible to narrate all the miracles performed by Jesus, the Catholic Encyclopedia states that the miracles presented in the Gospels were selected for a twofold reason: first for the manifestation of God's glory, and then for their evidential value. Jesus referred to his "works" as evidences of his mission and his divinity, and in [tpl]Bibleref2|John|5:36[/tpl] he declared that his miracles have greater evidential value than the testimony of John the Baptist.

==Crucifixion and atonement==

The accounts of the crucifixion and subsequent resurrection of Jesus provide a rich background for Christological analysis, from the Canonical Gospels to the Pauline Epistles.Powell, Mark Allan (ed.) and David R. Bauer (ed.). Who do you say that I am? Essays on Christology. Westminster John Knox Press, 1999. ISBN 0-664-25752-6. p.106
Johannine "agency christology" combines the concept that Jesus is the Son of his Father with the idea that he has come into the world as his Father's agent, commissioned and sent by the Father to represent the Father and to accomplish his Father's work. Implied in each Synoptic portrayal of Jesus is the doctrine that the salvation Jesus gives is inseparable from Jesus himself and his divine identity. Sonship and agency come together in the Synoptic gospels only in the Parable of the Vineyard ([tpl]Bibleref2|Matthew|21:37[/tpl]; [tpl]Bibleref2|Mark|12:6[/tpl]; [tpl]Bibleref2|Luke|20:13[/tpl]).Bauckhman, Richard.

A central element in the Christology presented in the Acts of the Apostles is the affirmation of the belief that the death of Jesus by crucifixion happened "with the foreknowledge of God, according to a definite plan". In this view, as in Acts 2:23, the cross is not viewed as a scandal, for the crucifixion of Jesus "at the hands of the lawless" is viewed as the fulfilment of the plan of God.The speeches in Acts: their content, context, and concerns by Marion L. Soards 1994 ISBN 0-664-25221-4 page 34
Paul's Christology has a specific focus on the death and resurrection of Jesus. For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus is directly related to his resurrection and the term "the cross of Christ" used in Galatians 6:12 may be viewed as his abbreviation of the message of the gospels.[tpl]cite book |last1=Schwarz  |first1=Hans  |last2= |first2= |title=Christology |url= |accessdate= |year=1998  |publisher= |location= |isbn=0-8028-4463-4 |pages=132–134[/tpl] For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus was not an isolated event in history, but a cosmic event with significant eschatological consequences, as in 1 Corinthians 2:8. In the Pauline view, Jesus, obedient to the point of death (Philippians 2:8) died "at the right time" (Romans 4:25) based on the plan of God. For Paul the "power of the cross" is not separable from the Resurrection of Jesus.
John Calvin supported the "agent of God" Christology and argued that in his trial in Pilate's Court Jesus could have successfully argued for his innocence, but instead submitted to crucifixion in obedience to the Father.[tpl]cite book |last1=Edmondson  |first1=Edmondson  |last2= |first2= |title=Calvin's Christology |url= |accessdate= |year=2004  |publisher=Cambridge University Press  |location= |isbn=0-521-54154-9 |page=91[/tpl]The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures by Hughes Oliphant Old 2002 ISBN 0-8028-4775-7 page 125 This Christological theme continued into the 20th century, both in the Eastern and Western Churches. In the Eastern Church Sergei Bulgakov argued that the crucifixion of Jesus was "pre-eternally" determined by the Father before the creation of the world, to redeem humanity from the disgrace caused by the fall of Adam.[tpl]cite book |last1= Bulgakov |first1= Sergei |last2=Jakim |first2=Boris  |title=The Lamb of God |url= |accessdate= |year= 2008 |publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|location= |isbn=0-8028-2779-9  |page=129[/tpl] In the Western Church, Karl Rahner elaborated on the analogy that the blood of the Lamb of God (and the water from the side of Jesus) shed at the crucifixion had a cleansing nature, similar to baptismal water.

==Resurrection, Ascension and Second Coming==

The New Testament teaches that the resurrection of Jesus is a foundation of the Christian faith.[tpl]bibleref2c|1co|15:12-20||1 Cor 15:12-20[/tpl] [tpl]bibleref2c|1Peter|1:3|HCSB|1 Pet 1:3[/tpl] Christians, through faith in the working of God[tpl]bibleref2c|Colossians|2:12||Col 2:12[/tpl] are spiritually resurrected with Jesus, and are redeemed so that they may walk in a new way of life.[tpl]bibleref2c|Rom|6:4[/tpl]
In the teachings of the apostolic Church, the resurrection was seen as heralding a new era. Forming a theology of the resurrection fell to Apostle Paul. It was not enough for Paul to simply repeat elementary teachings, but as [tpl]bibleref2|Hebrews|6:1|NIV[/tpl] states, "go beyond the initial teachings about Christ and advance to maturity". Fundamental to Pauline theology is the connection between Christ's Resurrection and redemption.The creed: the apostolic faith in contemporary theology by Berard L. Marthaler 2007 ISBN 0-89622-537-2 page 361 Paul explained the importance of the resurrection of Jesus as the cause and basis of the hope of Christians to share a similar experience in [tpl]bibleref2|1co|15:20-22||1 Corinthians 15:20-22[/tpl]:
 
 But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.
If the cross stands at the center of Paul's theology, so does the Resurrection: unless the one died the death of all, the all would have little to celebrate in the resurrection of the one.Dunn, James D. G. Theology of Paul the Apostle. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2003. ISBN 978-0802844231. p. 235 Paul taught that, just as Christians share in Jesus' death in baptism, so they will share in his resurrection for Jesus was designated the Son of God by his resurrection.[tpl]bibleref2c|Rom.|1:4[/tpl] Ehrman, Bart. Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene: The Followers of Jesus in History and Legend. Oxford University Press, USA. 2006. ISBN 0-19-530013-0 Paul's views went against the thoughts of the Greek philosophers to whom a bodily resurrection meant a new imprisonment in a corporeal body, which was what they wanted to avoid, given that for them the corporeal and the material fettered the spirit.Reichelt, Karl Ludvig and Sverre Holth. Meditation and Piety in the Far East , 2004. ISBN 0-227-17235-3 p.30 At the same time, Paul believed that the newly resurrected body would be a heavenly body—immortal, glorified, powerful and pneumatic, in contrast to an earthly body which is mortal, dishonored, weak and psychic.[tpl]Bibleref2|1cor|15:42-49||1 Corinthians 15:42-49[/tpl]
Dale Martin contends that Paul's various disagreements with the Corinthians were the result of a fundamental conflict over the ideological construction of the human body (and hence the church as the body of Christ). According to Martin, most Corinthian Christians and Paul himself saw the body as an entity that could be permeated by different pollutions. Other members of the Corinthian church, however, viewed the body as hierarchical—as a microcosm of the universe—and were not particularly concerned about body boundaries. These differing views of the human body (and also of the church as the body of Christ) led to differing opinions on a variety of subjects—including the resurrection of the body.Martin, Dale B. The Corinthian Body, Yale University Press, 1999. ISBN 0-300-08172-3. p. 126 in particular. According to theologian Peter Carnley, the resurrection of Jesus was different from the Resurrection of Lazarus as: "In the case of Lazarus, the stone was rolled away so that he could walk out.... the raised Christ didn't have to have the stone rolled away, because he is transformed and can appear anywhere, at any time."National Interest - Archbishop Peter Carnley
The Apostolic Fathers, discussed the death and resurrection of Jesus, including Ignatius (50−115),Ignatius makes many passing references, but two extended discussions are found in the Letter to the Trallians and the Letter to the Smyrnaeans. Polycarp (69−155), and Justin Martyr (100−165). Following the conversion of Constantine and the liberating Edict of Milan in 313, the ecumenical councils of the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries, that focused on Christology helped shape the Christian understanding of the redemptive nature of Resurrection, and influenced both the development of its iconography, and its use within Liturgy.The Resurrection and the icon by Michel Quenot 1998 ISBN 0-88141-149-3 page 72
