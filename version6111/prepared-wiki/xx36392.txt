John Drinkwater (1 June 1882 – 25 March 1937) was an English poet and dramatist.  

==Life and career==

Drinkwater was born in Leytonstone, London, and worked as an insurance clerk. In the period immediately before the First World War he was one of the group of poets associated with the Gloucestershire village of Dymock, along with Rupert Brooke and others. 
In 1919 he had his first major success with his play Abraham Lincoln. He followed it with others in a similar vein, including Mary Stuart and Oliver Cromwell. In 1924, his Lincoln play was adapted for a two-reel short film made by Lee DeForest and J. Searle Dawley featuring Frank McGlynn Sr. as Lincoln, and made in DeForest's Phonofilm sound-on-film process.Lee de Forest and Phonofilm at Virtual Broadway website

He was married to Daisy Kennedy, the ex-wife of Benno Moiseiwitsch.
