588 Achilles is an asteroid discovered on February 22, 1906, by the German astronomer Max Wolf. It was the first of the trojan asteroids to be discovered, and is named after Achilles, the fictional hero from the Iliad. It orbits in the [tpl]L4[/tpl] Lagrangian point of the Sun-Jupiter system. After a few such asteroids were discovered, the rule was established that the [tpl]L4[/tpl] point was the "Greek camp", while the [tpl]L5[/tpl] point was the "Trojan camp", though not before each camp had acquired a "spy" (624 Hektor in the Greek camp and 617 Patroclus in the Trojan camp).
Based on IRAS data, Achilles is 135 km in diameter and is the 6th largest Jupiter Trojan.
Photometric observations of this asteroid during 1994 were used to build a light curve showing a rotation period of 7.32 ± 0.02 hours with a brightness variation of 0.31 ± 0.01 magnitude. This result is in good agreement with prior studies.
