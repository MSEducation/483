CATEGORIES: Middle-earth languages

Taliska is a constructed language devised by J. R. R. Tolkien. It is one of the many fictional languages set in his secondary world, often called Middle-earth. 
Taliska was based on the Gothic language.J.R.R. Tolkien, "The Comparative Tales", Parma Eldalamberon 19, p. 22 Gothic was an early interest of Tolkien. A grammar and a lexicon of Taliska are known to exist, but [tpl]As of|2012|lc=on[/tpl] they have not been published.
In Middle-earth, Taliska, when first devised, was the language spoken by Men of the houses of Bëor and Hador.
Adûnaic, the language of Númenor, later displaced Taliska.  During the writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien toyed with the idea of making Taliska the primordial tongue of the people of Rohan who spoke Old English in his translated setting of The Lord of the Rings.
