Reculver is a village and coastal resort about [tpl]convert|3|mi|km|0[/tpl] east of Herne Bay in south-east England, in a ward of the same name, in the City of Canterbury district of Kent. It is about [tpl]convert|30|mi|km|0[/tpl] east by north of the county town of Maidstone, and about [tpl]convert|58|mi|km|0[/tpl] east by south from London. Reculver once occupied a strategic location at the north-western end of the Wantsum Channel, a sea lane which separated the Isle of Thanet and the Kent mainland until the late Middle Ages. This led the Romans to build a small fort there at the time of their conquest of Britain in 43 AD, and, starting late in the 2nd century, they built a larger fort, or castrum, called Regulbium, which later was part of the chain of Saxon Shore forts. The military connection resumed in the Second World War, when Barnes Wallis's bouncing bombs were tested in the sea off Reculver.
After the Romans left Britain early in the 5th century, Reculver became a landed estate of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Kent. The site of the Roman fort was given over for the establishment of a monastery dedicated to St Mary in 669 AD, and King Eadberht II of Kent was buried there in the 760s. During the Middle Ages Reculver was a thriving township with a weekly market and a yearly fair, and it was a member of the Cinque Port of Sandwich. The twin spires of the church became a landmark for mariners known as the Twin Sisters, and the 19th-century facade of St John's Cathedral in Parramatta, a suburb of Sydney, Australia, is a copy of that at Reculver.
Reculver declined as the Wantsum Channel silted up, and coastal erosion claimed many buildings constructed on the soft sandy cliffs. The village was largely abandoned in the late 18th century, and most of the church was demolished in the early 19th century. Protecting the ruins and the rest of Reculver from erosion is an ongoing challenge.
The 20th century saw a revival as a tourism industry developed and there are now three caravan parks. The census of 2001 recorded 135 people in the Reculver area, nearly a quarter of whom were in caravans at the time. Reculver Country Park is a Special Protection Area, Site of Special Scientific Interest and Ramsar site, which has rare clifftop meadows and is important for migrating birds.

==History==

===Toponymy===

The earliest recorded form of the name, Regulbium, was Celtic in origin, meaning "at the promontory", or "great headland", and, in Old English, this became corrupted to Raculf, sometimes given as Raculfceastre, giving rise to the modern "Reculver".[tpl]harvnb|Ekwall|1960|page=383[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Mills|1998|page=285[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Glover|1976|page=155[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Jessup|1936|page=190[/tpl].[tpl]#tag:ref|"Many more Old English forms are on record."[tpl]sfn|Ekwall|1960|p=383[/tpl]|group="Fn"[/tpl] The form "Raculfceastre" includes the Old English place-name element "ceaster", which frequently relates to "a Roman city or walled town".[tpl]sfn|Ekwall|1960|pp=xxvii, 92[/tpl]

The fort was located at what was then the north-eastern extremity of mainland Kent, overlooking the sea lane later known as the Wantsum Channel, which lay between it and the Isle of Thanet: the fort's location thus lay at the "main point of contact in the system Saxon Shore forts",[tpl]sfn|Cotterill|1993|p=236[/tpl] and allowed observation from the fort on all sides.[tpl]sfn|Bagshaw|1847|p=224[/tpl] The entrance to the headquarters building, or principia, faced north, indicating that the fort's main gate was on its north side, facing the eponymous promontory and the sea.[tpl]sfn|Harris|2001|p=33[/tpl] The fort was connected to the network of Roman roads through a link to Canterbury, about [tpl]convert|8.5|mi|km|0[/tpl] to the south-west.[tpl]sfn|Philp|2005|p=3[/tpl] It must also have had a harbour nearby,[tpl]sfn|Philp|2005|p=3[/tpl] and, though this has not yet been found, it was probably near to the fort's southern or eastern side.[tpl]harvnb|Philp|2005|page=3[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Harris|2001|page=32[/tpl].[tpl]#tag:ref|"The evidence suggests that of the Saxon Shore forts were constructed c. 225-290, and this means that the system was conceived about sixty years before the historical records refer to Germanic raiding.

Towards the end of the 3rd century a Roman naval commander named Carausius was given the task of clearing pirates from the sea between the Roman provinces in Britain, or Britannia, and on the European mainland.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/history/ahead-of-his-time-carausius-was-a-pirate-a-rebel-and-the-first-ruler-of-a-unified-britain-2039008.html | title=Ahead of his time: Carausius was a pirate, a rebel and the first ruler of a unified Britain | author=Clayson, A. | publisher=The Independent | year=2010 | accessdate=19 April 2014[/tpl] In so doing he established a new chain of command, the British part of which was later to pass under the control of a Count of the Saxon Shore. The Notitia Dignitatum, a Roman administrative document of the early 5th century, shows that the fort at Reculver became part of this arrangement, but archaeological evidence indicates that it was abandoned in the 360s.[tpl]sfn|Cotterill|1993|pp=227–39 (esp. 235)[/tpl]

===Monastery and church===

After the Roman occupation of Britain ended in about 410, Reculver became a landed estate of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Kent, possibly with a royal toll-station or a "significant coastal trading settlement,"[tpl]sfn|Kelly|2008|p=73[/tpl] given the types and quantity of coins found there.[tpl]sfn|Kelly|2008|p=73[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|While "it must be certain that the Roman fort had a supporting harbour, probably a natural feature improved by quays and jetties",[tpl]sfn|Philp|2005|p=3[/tpl] "the quantity of seventh- and eighth-century coins picked up from Reculver and its vicinity is paralleled England only at Hamwic Southampton: finds include gold thrymsas and some 50 sceattas, with contemporary Merovingian coins and a small group of Northumbrian issues. ... Almost certainly there is some connection with Reculver's position on a major trading route".[tpl]sfn|Kelly|2008|p=73[/tpl]|group="Fn"[/tpl] Other early Anglo-Saxon items found at Reculver include a fragment of a gilt bronze brooch, or fibula, which was originally circular and set with coloured stones or glass,[tpl]harvnb|Roach Smith|1850|loc=pp. 213–4 & Plate 7, Fig. 18[/tpl]; [tpl]cite web | url=http://webapps.kent.gov.uk/ExploringKentsPast/SingleResult.aspx?uid=MKE6539 | title=Keystone garnet disc brooch from Reculver | author=Exploring Kent's Past | publisher=Kent County Council | year=2014 | accessdate=19 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|"Reculver fibula belongs to a class of ornaments ... remarkable for peculiarities which seem almost to restrict them to the early Kentish Saxons.

The monastery developed as the centre of a "large estate, a manor and a parish",[tpl]sfn|Gough|2001b|p=[/tpl] and, by the early 9th century, it had become "extremely wealthy",[tpl]sfn|Blair|2005|p=123[/tpl] but it then fell under the control of the archbishops of Canterbury.[tpl]sfn|Kelly|2008|p=80[/tpl] By the 10th century the church and the estate were in the hands of the kings of Wessex, though the church may have remained a monastery, despite the likelihood of Viking attacks.[tpl]harvnb|Kelly|2008|pages=81–2[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Brooks|1979|pp=1–20 (esp. 12)[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Brooks|1984|pages=203–4[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Kerr|1982|pages=192–94[/tpl]. The church and the estate were given back to the archbishops of Canterbury in 949 by King Eadred of England, at which time the estate centred on Reculver included Hoath, Herne and land in the west of the Isle of Thanet.[tpl]sfn|Kelly|2008|p=82[/tpl]
By 1066 the monastery had become a parish church.[tpl]sfn|Kelly|2008|p=82[/tpl] However, in 1086 Reculver was named in Domesday Book as a hundred, with the estate centred on Reculver valued at £42.7s.

However, tithings in Kent were known as "borghs", a word cognate with "borough", but derived from "borh", a "pledge".[tpl]sfn|Baker|1966|p=11(note)[/tpl]|group="Fn"[/tpl] The parish was broken up in 1310, when chapelries at Herne and, on the Isle of Thanet, St Nicholas-at-Wade and All Saints were converted into parishes, though Hoath was still a perpetual curacy belonging to Reculver parish in the 19th century.[tpl]harvnb|Gough|1992|pages=91–2[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Bagshaw|1847|p=217[/tpl]. Records for the poll tax of 1377 show that there were then 364 individuals of 14 years and above, not including "honest beggars", in the reduced parish of Reculver, who paid a total £6.1s.4d.

===Decline and loss to the sea===

The thriving township of medieval Reculver depended partly on its position on a maritime trade route through the Wantsum Channel, already present in Anglo-Saxon times and exemplified by Reculver's membership of the Cinque Port of Sandwich later in the Middle Ages.[tpl]harvnb|Kelly|2008|pp=73–5[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Clarke|2010|p=61[/tpl]. The importance of the Wantsum Channel was such that, when the River Thames froze in 1269, trade between Sandwich and London had to be carried out overland.[tpl]sfn|Perkins|2007|p=254[/tpl] Historical records for the channel are sparse after 1269, perhaps "because the route was so well known as to be taken for granted the Middle Ages, the whole waterway from London to Sandwich being occasionally spoken of as the 'Thames'".[tpl]harvnb|Perkins|2007|p=254[/tpl], citing [tpl]citation|last=Scott-Robertson|first=W.|title=Thanet’s Insulation|journal=Archaeologia Cantiana|volume=XII|year=1878|page=338|url=https://archive.org/stream/archaeologiacant12kent/archaeologiacant12kent_djvu.txt[/tpl]. But silting and inning had closed the channel to traffic by about 1460,[tpl]sfn|Perkins|2007|p=254[/tpl] and the first bridge was built over it at Sarre in 1485, since ferries could no longer operate across it.[tpl]sfn|Perkins|2007|p=258[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|"Even so it was stipulated that the arches had to be big enough for boats and lighters to pass, in the hope that ‘the water shall happen to increase’".[tpl]harvnb|Perkins|2007|p=258[/tpl], quoting [tpl]citation|last=Scott-Robertson|first=W.|title=Thanet’s Insulation|journal=Archaeologia Cantiana|volume=XII|year=1878|page=340|url=https://archive.org/stream/archaeologiacant12kent/archaeologiacant12kent_djvu.txt[/tpl]. A late-15th century note in the archives of Canterbury Cathedral states that "recently the channel has become so silted up that the ferry can no longer cross it, except for an hour during the high Spring tides."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=054-cadchant_8&cid=-1#-1|title=Dean and Chapter Archive|author=Access to Archives|publisher=The National Archives|year=2014|at=CCA-DCc-ChAnt/T/31|accessdate=23 April 2014[/tpl]|group="Fn"[/tpl]
Reculver was also diminished by coastal erosion. By 1540, when John Leland recorded a visit to Reculver, the coastline to the north had receded to within little more than a quarter of a mile (402 m) of the "Towne which at this tyme was but Village lyke".[tpl]harvnb|Hearne|1711|page=137[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Jessup|1936|page=187[/tpl]. Soon after, in 1576, William Lambarde described Reculver as "poore and simple".[tpl]sfn|Lambarde|1596|p=207[/tpl] In 1588 there were 165 communicants – people in Reculver parish taking part in services of holy communion at the church – and in 1640 there were 169,[tpl]sfn|Hasted|1800|pp=109–25[/tpl] but a map of about 1630 shows that the church then stood only about [tpl]convert|500|ft|m|0[/tpl] from the shore.[tpl]sfn|Jessup|1936|p=189[/tpl] In January 1658 the local justices of the peace were petitioned concerning "encroachments of the sea ... had since Michaelmas last 1657 encroached on the land near six rods [tpl]nowrap|[tpl]convert|99|ft|m|0[/tpl][/tpl], and will doubtless do more harm".[tpl]sfn|Gough|2002|p=204[/tpl] The village's failure to support two "beer shops" in the 1660s points clearly to a declining population,[tpl]sfn|Gough|2001b|p=[/tpl] and the village was mostly abandoned around the end of the 18th century, its residents moving to Hillborough, about [tpl]convert|1.25|mi|km|0[/tpl] south-west of Reculver but within Reculver parish.[tpl]harvnb|Kelly|2008|page=67[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Harris|2001|page=36[/tpl].

All were born in the United Kingdom except for three individuals from the Republic of Ireland and three from South Africa. Gender was given as 69 female and 66 male, and the age distribution was 12 individuals aged 0–5 years (8.8%), 16 aged 6–16 years (14%), 30 aged 17–35 years (22.2%), 14 aged 36–45 years (10.3%), 44 aged 46–64 years (32.5%) and 21 aged 65 years and over (15.5%). Half (67) of all the individuals recorded were described as economically active, with 58 of these having employers and nine being self-employed; none were recorded as full-time students or unemployed. Twenty-four people were described as retired (17.7%). Of those aged 16–74 years, 14 (12.8%) were placed at the highest level for education or qualification. Christianity was the only religion represented, by 99 individuals, with 22 recorded as having no religion and 14 whose religion was not stated. From April 2001 to March 2002 the average gross weekly income of households in the ward of Reculver, which includes Beltinge, Bishopstone, Hillborough and most of the eastern part of the town of Herne Bay, was estimated by the Office for National Statistics as £560, or £29,120 per year.

====Twin Sisters====

A byname for the towers of the ruined church is the "Twin Sisters", and an account of how this first arose was current about a hundred years after
its supposed happening in the late 15th century, but in its usual form, for example in a 19th-century travel guide,[tpl]sfn|Anon.|1865|p=103[/tpl] it is mostly an invention created around "pseudo-historical detail".[tpl]sfn|Jessup|1936|p=179–80[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|This byname is also found as "The Sisters" and the "Two Sisters", but the towers are also sometimes known as simply "The Reculvers".[tpl]harvnb|Jessup|1936|page=179[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Hasted|1800|pages=109–25[/tpl]. The usual form of this story concerns twin sisters named Frances and Isabella, orphaned daughters of Sir Geoffrey St Clare, late in the 15th century. Frances is said to have been a prioress of the Benedictine priory of Davington, near Faversham, while Isabella was a ward of "Abbot John of Canterbury", who was the sisters' uncle. Isabella became betrothed to Henry de Belville, but he is said to have died fighting for Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field, in 1485. Isabella then joined her sister and became a nun. Fourteen years later, Frances became ill. The sisters vowed that, if Frances recovered, they would go on pilgrimage to give thanks at the Shrine of Our Ladye Star of the Sea in Broadstairs. Frances recovered, so they sailed from Faversham for Broadstairs, but their ship was caught in a storm and ran aground on a sandbank near Reculver called "The Horse". Frances was soon rescued, but night fell and Isabella was left on the wreck until daylight. Though she too was then rescued, she died of exposure in her sister's arms. Frances completed the vow to make offerings to the shrine at Broadstairs, and then restored Reculver church, also dedicated to St Mary, adding spires to the towers, which were known thereafter as the "Twin Sisters".[tpl]harvnb|Anon.|1791|pp=97–104[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Anon.|1865|p=103[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Jessup|1936|pages=179–80[/tpl]. Mention of a sandbank near Reculver named "The Horse" may be a "pseudo-historical detail", and no such sandbank is marked in this location on modern charts; but it is in their nature to move over time, and it is shown in a chart from 1790.[tpl]cite web|url=http://collections.nmm.ac.uk/collections/objects/540251.html|title=Chart of the River Thames from London to the Nore, Margate and the Downs, North, Middle and South Channels, from a survey taken in 1789 and 90|author=Stanier, R.|publisher=National Maritime Museusm|year=not dated|accessdate=20 April 2014[/tpl] A "Horse Channel" is marked on modern charts in about the same location, approximately [tpl]convert|0.31|mi|m|0[/tpl] north-west of Reculver towers.|group="Fn"[/tpl] The Ingoldsby Legends includes a re-invention of the story in which two brothers, Robert and Richard de Birchington, are substituted for the two sisters.[tpl]sfn|Ingoldsby|1840|pp=455–65[/tpl]

The medieval towers of the ruined church of St Mary are Reculver's "most dominant features".[tpl]sfn|Harris|2001|p=26[/tpl] These towers were added in the late 12th century to an existing church, which was founded in 669, when King Ecgberht of Kent granted land at Reculver to Bassa the priest for the foundation of a monastery. It may be that King Ecgberht's intention in founding a monastery at Reculver was to create an ecclesiastical centre with a strong English element, to counterbalance domination of the Canterbury church by Archbishop Theodore, from Tarsus, now in Turkey, Abbot Hadrian of St Augustine's, from North Africa, probably Cyrenaica, and their equally "non-native followers."[tpl]harvnb|Kelly|2008|pp=72–3[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Lapidge|1999|p=225[/tpl].[tpl]#tag:ref|According to [tpl]harvnb|Hasted|1800|page=[/tpl], King Ecgberht gave Reculver for the establishment of a monastery "as an atonement for the murder of his two nephews of Eormenred of Kent",[tpl]sfn|Hasted|1800|pp=109–25[/tpl] but [tpl]harvnb|Kelly|2008|page=[/tpl] makes no mention of this, instead placing the monastery's establishment in the context of domination of the early Kentish church by "non-native" leaders and observing that "perhaps it is no coincidence that in the year of Theodore's arrival Rome King Ecgberht was involved in the establishment of a house of male religious Reculver in a strategic location outside Canterbury. ... It may be significant that the next archbishop after the death of Theodore in 690 was Berhtwald, abbot of Reculver by 679 and perhaps Bassa's immediate successor."[tpl]sfn|Kelly|2008|pp=72–3[/tpl] John Blair suggests that Reculver's foundation may have been prompted by Wilfrid.[tpl]sfn|Blair|2005|p=95[/tpl] [tpl]harvnb|Hussey|1852|p=135[/tpl], regards Bassa the priest, who founded the church at Reculver in 669, as identical with the Northumbrian warrior Bassus who, according to Bede, had accompanied Paulinus of York and Æthelburh of Kent to Kent after the death of her husband King Edwin of Northumbria 33 years earlier, in 633.[tpl]sfn|Bede|1968|p=139[/tpl]|group="Fn"[/tpl]
The foundation of this church, sited within the remains of the Roman fort of Regulbium, exemplifies the "widespread practice Anglo-Saxon England of re-using Roman walled places for major churches",[tpl]sfn|Blair|1999|p=386[/tpl] and the new church was built "almost completely from demolished Roman structures".[tpl]sfn|Philp|2005|p=204[/tpl] The original structure formed a nave measuring [tpl]convert|37.5|ft|m|0[/tpl] by [tpl]convert|24|ft|m|0[/tpl] and an apsidal chancel, which was externally polygonal but internally round, and was entered from the nave through a triple arch formed by two columns made of limestone from Marquise, in the Pas-de-Calais region of northern France.[tpl]harvnb|Fletcher|1965|page=24[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Harris|2001|page=34[/tpl].[tpl]#tag:ref|The columns were "Saxon rather than Roman."[tpl]sfn|Haverfield|Mortimer Wheeler|1932|p=21[/tpl] An English Heritage information plaque for visitors to the site of the church, headed "An Anglo-Saxon Church", shows a reconstruction of the original church of Reculver, with monks robed in black in the chancel;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxon-churches.co.uk/images/reculver.pdf|title=The church of St Mary, Reculver, Kent|author=Parsons, F.J.|publisher=Anglo-Saxon Churches in England|accessdate=21 April 2014[/tpl] a similar image is at [tpl]harvnb|Wilmott|2012|p=24[/tpl]. Triple arches also featured in near-contemporary churches at St Augustine's Abbey (Canterbury), Bradwell and Lyminge.[tpl]sfn|Cherry|1981|p=163[/tpl]|group="Fn"[/tpl] Around the inside of the apse was a stone bench, and two small rooms, or porticus, were built out from the north and south sides of the chancel, from which they could be accessed.[tpl]sfn|Fletcher|1965|p=26[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|The inclusion of porticus at Reculver in the 7th century was described in 1965 as being "without parallel in western Europe,"[tpl]sfn|Fletcher|1965|p=26[/tpl] except among contemporary churches in Kent and at Bradwell, in Essex,[tpl]sfn|Fletcher|1965|pp=26, 30[/tpl] but more recent analysis has shown that porticus were probably more common in early Anglo-Saxon churches.[tpl]sfn|Cherry|1981|p=163[/tpl]|group="Fn"[/tpl] The presence of a stone bench around the inside of the apse has been attributed to influence from the Syrian Church, at a time when its followers were being displaced.[tpl]sfn|Fletcher|1965|pp=24, 27–30[/tpl]
Ten years after the foundation of the monastery, in 679, King Hlothhere of Kent granted lands at Sturry, about [tpl]convert|6.2|mi|km|0[/tpl] south-west of Reculver, and at Sarre, in the western part of the Isle of Thanet, across the Wantsum Channel to the east, to Abbot Berhtwald and to the monastery.[tpl]harvnb|Sawyer|1968|loc=S 8[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Kelly|2008|page=74[/tpl]. The grant was made at Reculver, the charter in which it was recorded was probably written by a Reculver scribe, and the grant of Sarre in particular "must be regarded as a sign of enormous royal favour to the at Reculver".[tpl]sfn|Kelly|2008|pp=74–5[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|S 8 is the earliest genuine Anglo-Saxon charter known to have survived in its original form.[tpl]sfn|Campbell|1982|loc=p. 98, Fig. 96[/tpl] "Sarre was a highly strategic place, overlooking the confluence of the Wantsum and the Great Stour, directly linked to Canterbury ... In the early 760s it was the site of a toll-station, where the agents of the Kentish kings collected dues on trading ships using the Wantsum route ... but its importance goes back much earlier ... and it may be that the at Reculver received a share of the royal tolls levied at Sarre."[tpl]sfn|Kelly|2008|pp=74–5[/tpl]|group="Fn"[/tpl] In the original, 7th-century charter recording this grant, Reculver is referred to as a civitas, or city, but this is probably a reference to either its Roman origins or its monastic status, rather than a large population centre.[tpl]harvnb|Blair|2005|page=249[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Kelly|2008|page=74[/tpl]. In 692 Reculver's abbot Berhtwald, a former abbot of Glastonbury in Somerset, was elected archbishop of Canterbury.[tpl]sfn|Brooks|1984|pp=76–80[/tpl] Bede, writing no more than 40 years later, described him as having been well educated in the Bible and experienced in ecclesiastical and monastic affairs,[tpl]sfn|Bede|1968|p=282[/tpl] but in terms indicating that Berhtwald was not a scholar.[tpl]sfn|Kelly|2008|p=76[/tpl]
Further charters show that the monastery at Reculver continued to benefit from Kentish kings in the 8th century, under abbots Heahberht, Deneheah and Hwitred, acquiring lands in Higham Upshire and Sheldwich and exemption from the toll due on one ship at Fordwich,[tpl]harvnb|Sawyer|1968|loc=S 31, 1612, 38[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Page|1926|pp=141–2[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Kelly|2008|p=78[/tpl]. and King Eadberht II of Kent was buried there in the 760s.[tpl]sfn|Kelly|2008|pp=78–9[/tpl]

==Transport==

Reculver is at the end of an unclassified road, Reculver Lane, and is about [tpl]convert|2|mi|km|0[/tpl] by road from the nearest major junction of the A299, or "Thanet Way". From Roman times Reculver was connected to Canterbury by a road, the presence of which is reflected in parish boundaries for much of its length.[tpl]sfn|Jessup|1936|pp=190–1[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|"A road that is now hard to trace ran from Canterbury to Reculver; its course may have been via Fordwich (there is now a footpath from Fordwich to Canterbury that may represent it), where the Stour was crossed, Buckwell, Maypole the civil parish of Hoath, and Hillborough to Reculver. It would not have been impossible for the Romans to have constructed a road between Richborough and Reculver, but it would have been an enormous task and scarcely worth the trouble; the only practicable route would have been by way of Chislet, Upstreet, and Grove on the banks of the Wantsum Channel, and then at least three waterways would have had to be negotiated."[tpl]sfn|Jessup|1932|p=135[/tpl]|group="Fn"[/tpl] The Reculver end of this road has disappeared owing to coastal erosion, but it is marked as "The King’s highe Way" on an estate map of 1685.[tpl]sfn|Jessup|1936|pp=190–1[/tpl] Remains of a Roman road leading to the east gate of the fort have also been found, which were "substantial ... consisting of a sandstone platform (3–4 m) wide and at least (30 cm) deep."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=1861018&resourceID=304|title=Reculver (East of the Fort)|author=Heritage Gateway|publisher=English Heritage|year=2012|accessdate=21 April 2014[/tpl]
In 1817 the nearest coaching route to Reculver was that running between London, Canterbury and the Isle of Thanet, which passed through Upstreet, about [tpl]convert|4|mi|km|0[/tpl] south of Reculver, before entering Thanet.[tpl]sfn|Cary|1817|pp=258, 291[/tpl] In 1839 coaches and vans ran daily from Herne Bay to Canterbury and on to destinations on the southern and eastern coasts of Kent, with access to the English Channel, at Deal, Dover, Sandgate and Hythe.[tpl]sfn|Pigot|1839|p=75[/tpl] In 1865 transport between Herne Bay and Reculver was available by "fly" – a type of one-horse hackney carriage.[tpl]harvnb|Anon|1865|p=iv[/tpl]; [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webster-dictionary.org/definition/fly|title=Fly|author=Webster's 1913 Dictionary|publisher=webster-dictionary.org|year=not dated|at=n. 5|accessdate=21 April 2014[/tpl]

The nearest railway stations to Reculver are at Herne Bay, about [tpl]convert|3.75|mi|km|0[/tpl] to the west, and Birchington-on-Sea, about [tpl]convert|4.5|mi|km|0[/tpl] to the east. Both stations are on the Chatham Main Line, running between London's Victoria station and Ramsgate, on the south-eastern coast of the Isle of Thanet.[tpl]sfn|National Rail|2013|p=[/tpl] The railway first reached Herne Bay from the west in 1861, and was extended to Ramsgate Harbour railway station by 1863,[tpl]sfn|Knight|1986|p=18[/tpl] but no provision was made for direct access from Reculver. A short-lived goods station for Reculver was opened on the main line in 1864, and in 1884 the South Eastern Railway proposed a branch from its Ashford to Ramsgate line to serve Reculver and Herne Bay, but this was never built.[tpl]sfn|Gray|1984|pp=132–3[/tpl] Rudimentary houses were erected by the railway company on marshland near Reculver in 1858 for the navvies who constructed the line through the area; these had been taken over by enginemen of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway by October 1904, when they were replaced by cottages.[tpl]sfn|Gray|1998|p=202[/tpl]
There is no formal access to Reculver by sea. Passenger steamships called at Herne Bay pier on their route between London and destinations along the north coast of Kent from 1832, but this service ceased in 1862.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hernebaypiertrust.co.uk/history.htm|title=History of the pier|author=History|publisher=Herne Bay Pier Trust|year=not dated|accessdate=21 April 2014|postscript=;[/tpl] [tpl]harvnb|Bagshaw|1847|page=173[/tpl]. However, Reculver has had connections with the sea since the 1st century, when the Roman fort of Regulbium had a supporting harbour,[tpl]sfn|Philp|2005|p=3[/tpl] and the quantity and variety of coins found at Reculver dating from the 7th century to the 8th are almost certainly related to its location on a "major trading route".[tpl]sfn|Kelly|2008|p=73[/tpl] Anglo-Saxon Reculver probably had its own harbour, and the monastery at Reculver may well have operated a "fleet of ships and its own boatyard."[tpl]sfn|Kelly|2008|p=72[/tpl] Details in the 10th-century charter in which King Eadred gave Reculver to the archbishops of Canterbury suggest that there was then an island north of Reculver, with its own "mini-Wantsum which could have provided a sheltered channel for beaching and berthing ships";[tpl]harvnb|Gough|1992|page=94[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Kelly|2008|page=72[/tpl]. the present day Black Rock beyond the shoreline at Reculver may be a remnant of this island.[tpl]sfn|Gough|2003|pp=90–2[/tpl]
