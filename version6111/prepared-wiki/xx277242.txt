==Reception==

Lindsay Planer of Allmusic states, "the vast majority of the material is little more than ersatz-cool filler, bearing little distinction. From an historical perspective this seems almost criminal, especially in light of the inordinate talent corralled for the project".Planer, L. Allmusic Review accessed August 8, 2013
