Iaido is associated with the smooth, controlled movements of drawing the sword from its scabbard or saya, striking or cutting an opponent, removing blood from the blade, and then replacing the sword in the scabbard.John Nauright, Charles Parrish, edited (2012) Sports Around the World: History, Culture, and Practice.

Practitioners of iaido are often referred to as iaidoka.Pellman, Leonard and Masayuki Shimabukuro (2008, 2nd edition) Flashing Steel: Mastering Eishin-Ryu Swordsmanship. Blue Snake Books. Page 314-315. ISBN 978-1-58394-197-3

==Origins of the name==

The term 'iaido' appear in 1932 and consists of the kanji characters [tpl]Nihongo|居合道[/tpl].[ref]
.</ref><ref>Draeger, Donn F. (1974) Modern Bujutsu & Budo - The Martial Arts and Ways of Japan. (Vol. III). New York: Weatherhill. Page 55-58. ISBN 0-8348-0351-8</ref> The origin of the first two characters, [tpl]Nihongo|''iai''|居合[/tpl], is believed to come from saying [tpl]Nihongo|''Tsune ni ite, kyū ni awasu''|常に居て、急に合わす[/tpl], that can be roughly translated as “being constantly (prepared), match/meet (the opposition) immediately”.<ref>http://ejmas.com/tin/2010tin/tinart_thibedeau_1005.html</ref>  Thus the primary emphasis in 'iai' is on the psychological state of being present (居). The secondary emphasis is on drawing the sword and responding to the sudden attack as quickly as possible (合).
Last character, [tpl]Nihongo|道[/tpl] is generally translated into English as the way. The term 'iaido' approximately translates into English as "the way of mental presence and immediate reaction",Shaw, Scott (1999) Samurai Zen. Chapter 12. Weiser Books. ISBN 978-1-57863-104-9 and was popularized by Nakayama Hakudo.
The term emerged from the general trend to replace the suffix [tpl]Nihongo|-jutsu|術[/tpl] with [tpl]Nihongo|-dō|道[/tpl] in Japanese martial arts in order to emphasize a philosophical or spiritual aspects of practice.Draeger, Donn F. (1974) Modern bujutsu & Budo - The Martial Arts and Ways of Japan. (Vol. III). New York: Weatherhill. Page 55-58. ISBN 0-8348-0351-8

==Purpose of iaido==

Iaido emcompasses hundreds of styles of swordsmanship, all of which subscribe to non-combative aims and purposes. Iaido is an intrinsic form of Japanese modern budo.
Iaido is a reflection of the morals of the classical warrior and to build a spiritually harmonious person possessed of high intellect, sensitivity, and resolute will.[ref]

==Moral and religious influence on iaido==

The metaphysical aspects in iaido have been influenced by several philosophical and religious directions. Iaido is a blend of the ethics of Confucianism, methods of Zen, the philosophical Taoism and aspects from bushido.[ref]
.</ref>

==Seitei-gata techniques==

Because iaido is practiced with a weapon, it is almost entirely practiced using forms, or kata. Multiple person kata exist within some schools of iaido, when iaidoka  will usually use bokken for such kata practice. Iaido does include competition in form of kata but does not use sparring of any kind. Because of this non-fighting aspect, and iaido's emphasis on precise, controlled, fluid motion, it is sometimes referred to as "moving Zen."
Iaido forms (kata) are performed solitarily against one or more imaginary opponents. Some iaido schools, however, include kata performed in pairs. Most of the styles and schools do not practice tameshigiri, cutting techniques.
A part of iaido, is nukitsuke.Suino, Nicklaus (2007) Strategy in Japanese Swordsmanship. Weatherhill. Page 38. ISBN 978-1-59030-489-1 This is a quick draw of the sword, accomplished by simultaneously drawing the sword from the saya and also moving the saya back in saya-biki.Craig, Darrell (1981) IAI The Art of Drawing the Sword. Tuttle Publishing. Page 64. ISBN 0-8048-7023-3

==History==

After the collapse of the Japanese feudal system in 1868 the founders of the modern disciplines borrowed from the theory and the practice of classical disciplines as they had studied or practiced.Draeger Donn. F. (1974) Modern Bujutsu & Budo - The Martial Arts and Ways of Japan. New York/London: Weatherhill. Page 57. ISBN 0-8348-0351-8 The founding in 1895 of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (DNBK) 大日本武徳会 (lit. "Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society") in Kyoto, Japan.Dai Nippon Butoku Kai: Honbu, Kyoto, Japan (2012). Retrieved on November 13, 2013. was also an important contribution to the development of modern Japanese swordsmanship. In 1932 DNBK officially approved and recognized the Japanese discipline, iaido;Dai Nippon Butoku Kai: History and philosophy (2012). Retrieved on November 13, 2013. this year was the first time the term iaido appeared in Japan. After this initiative the modern forms of swordsmanship is organised in several iaido organisations.
On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked the US naval base at Pearl Harbor and declared war, bringing the US into World War II.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sankei.co.jp/seiron/koukoku/2005/0504/ronbun3-2.html |title=インドネシア独立運動と日本とスカルノ（２）|work=馬 樹禮 |publisher=産経新聞社 |date=April 2005 |accessdate=2 October 2009|language=Japanese[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1941/411208c.html |title=The Kingdom of the Netherlands Declares War with Japan |publisher=iBiblio |accessdate=2 October 2009[/tpl] After the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on 15 August.[tpl]cite journal|last=Pape|first=Robert A.|title=Why Japan Surrendered|journal=International Security|year=1993|volume=18|issue=2|pages=154–201|doi=10.2307/2539100[/tpl]
As a result, the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai and its affiliates were disbanded by the Allies of World War II in the period 1945-1950. In 1950 when the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai was reestablished and the practice of the Japanese martial disciplines took up their activities again, including iaido.Draeger Donn. F. (1974) Modern Bujutsu & Budo - The Martial Arts and Ways of Japan. New York/London: Weatherhill. Page 48-49. ISBN 0-8348-0351-8
In 1952, the [tpl]nihongo|Kokusai Budoin, International Martial Arts Federation|国際武道院・国際武道連盟|Kokusai Budoin Kokusai Budo Renmei[/tpl] (IMAF) was founded in Tokyo, Japan.International Martial Arts Federation FAQ IMAF is a Japanese organization promoting international Budō,Journal of Combat Sports and Martial Arts. MEDSPORTPRESS, 2011; 1(2); Vol. 2, page 50. and has seven divisions representing the various Japanese martial arts, including iaido.http://www.imaf.com/divisions.html International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF) - Divisions.The East: Volume 36; Volume 36, 2000.
In 1952, the All Japan Kendo Federation (ZNKR) was founded,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.kendo-fik.org/english-page/english-page2/brief-history-of-kendo.htm| title= The History of Kendo |publisher=All Japan Kendo Federation (AJKF)[/tpl] and the All Japan Iaido Federation (ZNIR) was founded in 1948.
Upon formation of various organizations overseeing martial arts, a problem of commonality appeared.  Since members of the organization were drawn from various backgrounds, and had experience practicing different schools of iaido, there arose a need for a common set of kata, that would be known by all members of organization, and that could be used for fair grading of practitioner's skill. Two of the largest Japanese organizations, All Japan Kendo Federation (ZNKR) and All Japan Iaido Federation (ZNIR), each created their own representative set of kata for this purpose.

==Kata under the respective iaido organizations==

===Seitei Iaido===

Seitei or Zen Nippon Kendo Renmei Iaido (制定) ("basis of the Iaido") are technical based on seitei-gata, or standard form of sword-drawing techniques, created by the Zen Nihon Kendo Remmei (All Japan Kendo Federation) and the Zen Nihon Iaido Remmei (All Japan Iaido Federation).[ref]
.</ref> This standard set of iaido kata was created in 1968 by a committee formed by the All Japan Kendo Federation (AJKF, ''Zen Nippon Kendo Renmei'' or ZNKR).<ref name="Zen Nippon Kendo Renmei Iai">
</ref>
The twelve Seitei iaido forms (seitei-gata) are standardised for the tuition, promotion and propagation of iaido at the iaido clubs, that are members of the regional Kendo federations.  All dojos, that are members of the regional Kendo federations teach this set. Since member federations of International Kendo Federation (FIK) uses seitei gata as a standard for their iaido exams and shiai, seitei iaido has  become the most widely practised form of iaido in Japan and the rest of the world.

===Tōhō Iaido===

The All Japan Iaido Federation (ZNIR, Zen Nihon Iaido Renmei, founded 1948) has a set of five iaido forms, Tōhō Iaido.  This is essentially the ZNIR equivalent of the Seitei Iaido set. These five forms are borrowed from the five different schools below.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

====Other organizations====

Single-style federations usually do not have a standardized "grading" set of kata, and use kata from their koryu curriculum for grading and demonstrations.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Iaido schools==

Many iaido organisations promote sword technique from the seiza (sitting position) and refer to their art as iaido. One of the popular versions of these is the Musō Shinden-ryū 夢想神伝流, a iaido system created by Nakayama Hakudō (1872-1958) in the 1932.[ref]
