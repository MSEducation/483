Leiser in 2008 said of his work, "I don't really want to make 'Christian film' necessarily, like the things you find in Christian bookstores. I prefer to explore experimental film techniques that still glorify God without being blatant or preachy. I do like to leave much of the symbolism to the audience's own interpretations."[tpl]cite web | last =Priebe | first= Ken | url = http://www.hollywoodjesus.com/dvdDetail.cfm?i=EA254F1D-0493-543A-AAC39DD7341F5190&ia=EA2AF652-ECE3-B01A-D92B29C01F2314F4&pageNumber=2 | title = Into the Eyes of a Child | publisher = HollywoodJesus.com | date = 2008, n.d. | accessdate = September 22, 2012 | archivedate =September 22, 2012 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AsKAakMQ |deadurl = no[/tpl] Jeffrey Leiser: "Eric and I are both Christians, but a lot of other Christians don't understand us."
