Indian rodeo is the rodeo subculture of Native American rodeo athletes and, in Canada, First Nations athletes.  In the United States there are a number of regional associations and at least two national Finals.  In Canada, Indian rodeos share a major role in small aboriginal communities and are also featured events in larger centres with aboriginal populations.  Some major rodeos in British Columbia such as the Williams Lake Stampede are, while not aboriginally-organized and unlike some Indian rodeos open to non-natives, are heavily "Indian" in character and in the ranks of competitors.
