"Wight Is Wight" is a French song by Michel Delpech. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Released in 1969, the hippy influenced song became a hit in France, and was recorded the following year in English by the British singer Sandie Shaw. Shaw's version was her second single of the 1970s but did not meet with commercial success.
