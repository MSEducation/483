Devenish College is a secondary school located in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. It lies within the Western Education and Library Board area. The College came about from the amalgamation of Enniskillen High School and Duke of Westminster High School and opened on a split campus in September 2004. In September 2006 the two schools amalgamated onto one campus.
In January 2005, it was announced that a [tpl]convert|28|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] site on the Tempo Road, Enniskillen, had been acquired for a Â£15m scheme to build a 700 pupil post primary school to replace school facilities in Kesh and Enniskillen. It was expected to be completed by September 2008 though realistically this is looking increasingly like 2016.
Devenish College is noted for being the only College Board SAT Test Center in Northern Ireland.
