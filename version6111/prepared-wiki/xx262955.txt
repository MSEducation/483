The Ant and the Aardvark is the first of the 17 cartoons in the series of the same name. It is also one of the last cartoons to be directed by Friz Freleng.

==Plot==

Charlie Ant (John Byner) spots a picnic and goes there to get some food, unaware that the picnic is that of the Aardvark (also Byner).

==Laugh track==

The Pink Panther Show contained a laugh track when the The Ant and the Aaradvark cartoons were broadcast on NBC-TV. When MGM released the complete series on DVD in 2007, the theatrical versions were, for the most part, utilized. However, three television prints made their way onto the DVD set, The Ant and the Aardvark being one of them.
