The Van de Kamp Bakery Building was built in 1930 in the Glassell Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. It served as the headquarters of the chain of bakeries and coffee shops known for their distinctive windmill architecture. The building was designed by New York architect J. Edward Hopkins to resemble a Dutch 16th century farmhouse.http://www.dmjmhn.aecom.com/NewsMedia/45/55/index.jsp Originally there was a Van de Kamp's store next to the building, which was one of the first Van de Kamp's stores ever made and had the famous Van de Kamp's windmill style design. The building remains the only example of an industrial plant in the Dutch Renaissance Revival style. The bakery closed in October 1990 after Van de Kamps filed for Chapter 11.http://www.laweekly.com/1999-10-28/news/history-in-the-baking/ The building is a designated Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, declared on May 12, 1992.
This building underwent a $72-million renovation by the Los Angeles Community College District with the intent of being a Los Angeles City College satellite campus. The site is instead leased to charter school and job training groups.[tpl]cite news | first = Bob | last = Pool | title = Neighbors of Van de Kamp's bakery want to throw book at community college district | date = 2010-10-12 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/12/local/la-me-bakery-school-20101012 | work = Los Angeles Times | accessdate = 2011-03-28[/tpl]
