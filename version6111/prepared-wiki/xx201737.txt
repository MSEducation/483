[[Euro starter kits]]

CATEGORIES: Euro coins

Euro starter kits are packs of euro coins of all the eight denominations sealed in a plastic bag. The scope of these kits is primarily to familiarise the citizens of that nation that is going to join the eurozone with the new currency, the euro. Another objective is to fill up cash registers well in advance of €-Day. Usually these kits are available from the local banks some weeks before the euro changeover.[tpl]Cite web|author=WebDNA Studio |url=http://eurocoinscollectionmalta.freehostia.com |title=Euro Coins Collection Malta |publisher=Eurocoinscollectionmalta.freehostia.com |date= |accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl]
Mainly there are two types of starter packs; business starter kits and kits for the general public. The difference is in the number of coins per pack. Business kits are intended for retailers, thereby they contain around 100 euro or more of coins and are normally contained in rolls, whereas, the mini-starter kits are intended for the general public and usually these kits have a small volume of coins.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://jore.neuf.fr/starter%20kit.html |title=La page n'existe plus |publisher=Jore.neuf.fr |date= |accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://euromuenzen.com/starterkits/ |title=Euro Starterkits |publisher=Euromuenzen.com |date= |accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://eurocollection.ning.com |title=The €uro Coins Collection Network |publisher=Eurocollection.ning.com |date= |accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl]

Forty thousand starter kits, worth €172 each, were available for businesses, but only 22.000 were sold.

Another 250,000 mini-kits, worth €17.09 (CYP 10) each, were available for the general public. Some 189,000 mini-kits were sold. According to the Eurobarometer survey, more than 70% of the citizens who had bought a mini-kit opened it and used the coins after the changeover while some 20% kept it untouched. As from the changeover, the unsold mini-kits have been exported to satisfy the demand of coin collectors abroad.
