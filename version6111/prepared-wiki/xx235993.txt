==Family Life==

Vicki Gunvalson has a family that includes her ex-husband, Donn, and the two children from her first marriage, Michael and Briana Wolfsmith. She has worked hard to achieve financial success as an independent insurance agent and expects her family to toe her party line. Gunvalson herself admits to having control issues but maintains it is this very characteristic that has brought about her success and desired lifestyle. By Season 3, Gunvalson and her husband are empty nesters and purchase a smaller home in Coto de Caza with the goal to downsize and simplify their lives. However, they still reside in their large residence and Gunvalson eventually sells the smaller home. Gunvalson appears to have expanded her business to include business associates in Bellevue, Washington and Atlanta, Georgia, with her son eventually joining her business. Her daughter Briana has a cancer scare, but is able to recover. 
In October 2010, it was reported that Vicki and Donn were divorcing. In April 2011, on the Bravo aftershow series Watch What Happens Live, Vicki confirmed that divorce proceedings were ongoing. She is the only original housewife from season 1. As a result, Andy Cohen has dubbed her " The OG from the OC".

==Personal Life==

Vicki is dating a new man, Brooks, a business man and father-of-four. Gunvalson's daughter, Brianna, gave birth to Gunvalson's first grandchild on September 28, 2012. Troy William Culberson is the son of Briana Wolfsmith and her husband Ryan Culberson.
