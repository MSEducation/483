==Plot summary==

Antonio Cano, 45 years old, is an important businessman who was severely injured in a car accident. Because of this, he is temporarily paralyzed and suffers memory loss. His family, friends and business associates all try to recreate scenes from his life in order to revive his memory which, little by little, does begin to return. Each day Antonio is placed in his beautiful garden where he relives many memories, both real and imagined.

==Cultural Significance==

All of the striking scene changes and radical imagery are metaphors for the suppression and suffering of Spanish people under the Franco regime, who could only speak out about their plight by means of allegorical films/stories such as El jardín de las delicias.
