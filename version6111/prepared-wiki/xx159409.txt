St Marylebone Grammar School (SMGS) was a grammar school located in the London borough of the City of Westminster, from 1792 to 1981.

==History==

===Philological School===

Founded as the Philological School by Thomas Collingwood, under the patronage of the Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, its object was to help "the heads of families, who by unexpected misfortune, have been reduced from a station of comfort and respectability." Originally founded in Mary Street (later renamed Stanhope Street, N.W. 1), it moved to Marylebone Road in 1827. Its fortunes then improved largely because of headmaster Edwin Abbott. After Abbott, the school's financial position deteriorated.

===Grammar school===

In 1908 it was accepted in trust by the London County Council and renamed St Marylebone Grammar School. After World War II it recovered and under headmaster Philip Wayne it developed artistic activities, acquired shared use of playing fields in Sudbury Hill (reached by rail from nearby Marylebone Station), and established a country base near Leith Hill.[tpl]cite book|editor=J.S.

After Philip Wayne, SMGS was led by Harry Llewellyn-Smith as headmaster until 1970. During his period a new and separate science block was built a short walk away from the school's main site. Roy Mansell led the science team and was for a short period the last headmaster after Patrick Hutton.

===Closure===

Soon after headmaster Patrick Hutton (formerly head of English[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2007/mar/19/obituaries.mainsection|newspaper=The Guardian | location=London | first=Gordon|last=Leach|date=2007-03-19[/tpl]  at  St Paul's School) arrived in 1970, the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) proposed to merge SMGS with the local secondary modern school, Rutherford School, later part of North Westminster School. ILEA itself came into conflict with the new Conservative government, whose secretary of state for education Margaret Thatcher took an interest in SMGS. By 1981, however, SMGS had closed.[tpl]cite news|title=Patrick Hutton|author=Gordon Leach|work=The Guardian|date=2007-03-19|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/otherlives/story/0,,2037002,00.html|accessdate=2007-06-01|location=London[/tpl]

==Current use of buildings==

The former science block continues in educational use as the Cosway Street Centre, part of City of Westminster College. The main school building consisted of the original school building on Marylebone Road and two later wings in Lisson Grove, which were demolished and replaced with an office block. The original building was listed and remains intact; it is now part of Abercorn School.
