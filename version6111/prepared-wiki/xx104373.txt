The Bowling Green Assembly Plant is a General Motors automobile factory in Bowling Green, Kentucky. It is a specialized plant assembling GM's Y-body sports cars, the Chevrolet Corvette and formerly the Cadillac XLR.

==History==

The first 300 corvettes were hand built in Flint, Michigan in 1953. They moved the next year to a facility in St. Louis, Missouri, and then finally ended up in 1981 at the Bowling Green Assembly Plant. The General Motors plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky opened their doors for production in June 1, 1981. Most of the 900 Corvette workers from St. Louis transferred to the new plant. What was once an abandoned Chrysler air-conditioning unit factory, is now a one million square foot facility that employes almost one thousand people. The Plant hosts tours through out the year Monday through Friday, three times a day.[tpl]cite web|title=Bowling Green|url=https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/company_info/facilities/assembly/bowlinggreen.html|publisher=GM News|accessdate=28 February 2014[/tpl]

==Investments==

Many large investments have been made in order to keep the plant as updated and cutting edge as possible. As the corvette changes and betters throughout the years, the technology to create it has to be revamped as well. 

===Performance Build Center===

The performance build center allows engine aficionados to build their own specialty engines. With the relocation of the performance build center from Michigan to Bowling Green it allows customers to be able to build and watch the production of their car all in now one location. The opening of this center in Bowling Green is adding 20 new or relocated jobs to the community as well.
The center is the source of all the hand assembled dry sump engines. These would be the 6.2L LS3 V8 engine of the grand sport coupe (manual transmission only), the 7.0L LS7 V8 Z06 engine, and the 6.2L supercharged LS9 engine for the ZR1.[tpl]cite web|title=GM Relocating Performance Build Center to Bowling Green|url=http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2013/Jan/0130_bowlinggreen.html|publisher=GM News|accessdate=28 February 2014[/tpl]

===Body Shop===

The new body shop now allows for the aluminum frame to finally be able to be produced in-house. The new shop also was designed to have the advancements to make the most complex frame design in Corvette's history.  This new frame is 99 pounds lighter and 40% stiffer than the C6 frame.[tpl]cite web|last=Mceachern|first=Sam|title=General Motors Re-Opens Overhauled Bowling Green Assembly Plant To The Public  |url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2013/10/general-motors-re-opens-overhauled-bowling-green-assembly-plant-to-the-public/|publisher=GM Authority|accessdate=28 February 2014[/tpl] With the chassis being so strong the C7 convertible will not need any additional structural reinforcements to the frame, which is very rare.
