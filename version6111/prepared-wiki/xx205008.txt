[[Millwall F.C.–West Ham United F.C. rivalry]]

CATEGORIES: London derbies, Millwall F.C., West Ham United F.C., England football derbies

The rivalry between Millwall and West Ham United is one of the longest-standing and most bitter in English football. The two teams, then known as Millwall Athletic and Thames Ironworks, both originated in the East End of London, and were located under three miles apart. Their supporters were predominantly dockers at shipyards on either side of the River Thames. Consequently, each set of fans worked for rival firms who were competing for the same business; this intensified the tension between the teams. They first played against each other in the 1899–1900 FA Cup. In 1910 Millwall moved south of the River Thames and the teams were no longer East London neighbours. Even so, the derbies retained their passion and both sets of supporters still consider the other club their main rival. Before the First World War the teams met 60 times in just 16 years, mostly in the Southern and Western Football Leagues. The teams have usually competed in different divisions since, spending only 12 seasons in the same tier of the Football League. They have played a total of 39 times in league and cup competitions since 1916.
The rivalry between the teams has been depicted in films that focused specifically on the animosity between the clubs' two hooligan firms, the Inter City Firm and the Millwall Bushwackers. Violence has occurred sporadically between the fans, once resulting in the death of a Millwall supporter in 1976. Most recently in the 2009 Upton Park riot, widespread disorder between supporters in and around West Ham's Upton Park ground led to numerous injuries and a Millwall fan being stabbed before the match began. In the last two games between the sides in the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure the games were trouble-free. As of the 2013–14 season, West Ham play in the Premier League and Millwall play in the Football League Championship, the tier below.

==History of the rivalry==

===Founding of the clubs: 1885–98===

Millwall Rovers Football Club was formed in 1885 by tinsmiths at JT Morton's canned food factory on the Isle of Dogs in the East End of London.Lindsay, p.8 Ten years later, Thames Ironworks Football Club was formed by Dave Taylor, a foreman at Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, London's last major shipbuilding firm. Arnold Hills, the company owner, decided to form a football team to improve the morale of his workforce. The two clubs were situated under three miles ([tpl]convert|3|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only[/tpl]) apart.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130610/memorial-grounds_2236884_3185247 | title=Memorial Grounds | publisher=West Ham United Football Club | date=10 June 2013 | accessdate=5 March 2014[/tpl] With each set of players and supporters working for opposing firms, competing for the same contracts, rivalries developed.[tpl]cite news|last=Brown |first=Oliver |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/west-ham/6105500/West-Ham-v-Millwall-a-history-of-how-the-rivalry-started.html|title=West Ham v Millwall: a history of how the rivalry started |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=28 August 2009 |accessdate=20 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1209028/Man-stabbed-West-Ham-Millwall-fans-brawl-outside-stadium.html |title=Man is stabbed as West Ham and Millwall fans brawl outside stadium |newspaper=Mail Online |location=London |date=26 August 2009|accessdate=31 July 2010 [/tpl] The earliest meetings between the clubs were reserve games: the first ended in a 6–0 home win for Millwall Athletic ReservesMillwall Rovers were renamed Millwall Athletic in 1889. on 14 December 1895 over a newly formed Thames Ironworks side.Lindsay, p. 9 On 23 September 1897, the two sides played a first-team friendly match at Millwall's Athletic Grounds, Millwall Athletic won 2–0 in front of a crowd of 1,200 spectators.Powles, p. 53Lindsay, p. 372

===Sixty meetings in sixteen years: 1899–1915===

On 9 December 1899 the two teams met for their first competitive fixture – a Fifth Round qualifying match in the FA Cup. Millwall Athletic won 2–1 at Thames Ironworks' Memorial Grounds; their goal scorers were Hugh Goldie and Bert Banks. Millwall reached the 1899–1900 semi-final and lost 3–0 to Southampton, but gained the nickname The Lions from a newspaper headline heralding them as "The Lions of the South" for their cup exploits.Lindsay, p. 13 The teams' second competitive meeting was a Southern League match that spanned two centuries. A fixture at the Memorial Grounds on 23 December 1899 was abandoned after 69 minutes owing to smog, with Millwall leading 2–0. Instead of replaying the game, the remaining 21 minutes were completed after the return fixture four months later, on 28 April 1900. After Ironworks won 1–0, the players took a short rest and played the rest of the abandoned game. With no further score, Millwall won the game 2–0.Lindsay and Tarrant, p. 262

The two sides met seven times in each of these seasons, the highest number of meetings in a season between the clubs.Lindsay and Tarrant, p. 268 During this period Millwall were unbeaten in 12 consecutive games against West Ham, with nine wins and three draws over two years. This included a 7–1 win in a Southern Professional Charity Cup semi-final on 2 April 1903, the largest winning margin between the teams. Ben Hulse scored four of the goals at the Memorial Grounds.Lindsay and Tarrant, p. 166 The run was finally broken on 1 September 1904, in a 3–0 victory at West Ham's first ever game at Upton Park, with two goals from Billy Bridgeman and one by Jack Flynn.
On 17 September 1906, in a Western League game, Millwall player Alf Dean was hurled against a metal advertising board by West Ham's Len Jarvis.[tpl]cite book| last = Glinert| first = Ed| title = The London Football Companion A Site-by-site Celebration of the Capital's Favourite Sport| url = http://books.google.com/?id=LXsSngEACAAJ&pg=PA56| accessdate = 10 September 2013| year = 2009| publisher = Bloomsbury| isbn = 978-0-7475-9516-8 [/tpl] Others were stretchered off following heavy tackles. The East Ham Echo reported: "From the very first kick of the ball it was seen likely to be some trouble, but the storm burst when Dean and Jarvis came into collision (Millwall had two players sent off during the match). This aroused considerable excitement among the spectators. The crowds on the bank having caught the fever, free fights were plentiful."Dunning, p. 68 In 1910 Millwall decided to drop Athletic from their name and move out of East London. With limited expansion space on the Isle of Dogs, the club wanted to boost support and attendances. It moved four miles to The Den, in New Cross, South London.Lindsay, pp. 16–17 The last East London derby between the teams was at Millwall's North Greenwich ground on 24 September 1910; West Ham won 2–0 with goals from Danny Shea and Fred Blackburn.Lindsay and Tarrant, p. 284 Four months later, Millwall travelled to Upton Park as a South London team for the first time. The game ended in a 2–2 draw. On 9 March 1912, 28,400 supporters saw West Ham's first visit to The Den. The Lions won the game 5–1, with their Welsh international striker Wally Davis scoring a hat-trick.

===Two World Wars and joining the Football League: 1915–45===

In total, 33 matches were played between the teams in Wartime Leagues.Lindsay, pp. 316–317 They both fielded severely depleted sides of juniors, reserves and non-professionals, playing 14 games in the London Combination between 1915 and 1919. West Ham won nine, Millwall three and two were drawn.Lindsay and Tarrant, pp. 294–300 After the First World War, the Football League was reintroduced in England by The Football Association and West Ham joined the Second Division for the 1919–20 season. Millwall joined the inaugural Third Division in the 1920–21 season, in the Football League expansion of 44 clubs to 66.Lindsay, p. 17 In 1926 a general strike was observed by workers around the Royal Docks, the majority of whom were West Ham supporters. An unsubstantiated story states that Millwall-supporting shipyard workers of the Isle of Dogs refused to lend their support, provoking outrage.
Between 1919 and 1930 the clubs played each other 12 times in the London Professional Footballers Association Charity Fund, London Challenge Cup and the FA Cup. On 15 February 1930, West Ham won the Fifth Round FA Cup game 4–1 at Upton Park; Vic Watson scored two goals, and Viv Gibbins and Tommy Yews one each. Harold Wadsworth replied for the Lions.Lindsay and Tarrant, p. 322 The teams met for the first time in the Football League in the 1932–33 season, after West Ham were relegated from the First Division.Lindsay and Tarrant, pp. 300–322 On 17 September 1932, West Ham beat Millwall 3–0 at Upton Park in the Second Division, two goals being scored by George Watson and one by Jackie Morton.
On 27 December 1938, 42,200 spectators at Upton Park saw a Second Division game between the sides end 0–0. [tpl]as of|2014[/tpl], this remains the record attendance for the fixture. Between 1939 and 1946 the two clubs played non-competitive fixtures in the League South (A) Division, South Regional League, London League, Football League South and the Football League War Cup.Lindsay and Tarrant, pp. 342–354 They played 19 games against each other during the Second World War: Millwall won 3, West Ham 12 and 4 were drawn. The Den was severely damaged by a German bomb in 1943, and for a brief time Millwall were invited by their neighbours Charlton Athletic, Crystal Palace and West Ham to play their games at The Valley, Selhurst Park and Upton Park. To offset the shortage of professional players during the Second World War, a guest player system was introduced. Players such as Sailor Brown, Louis Cardwell and Jimmy Jinks played for both clubs during this period.[tpl]cite book| last1 = Hogg| first1 = Tony| last2 = McDonald| first2 = Tony| title = West Ham United who's who| year = 1995| publisher = Independent UK Sports Publications| location = London| isbn = 1-899429-01-8| page = 223 [/tpl] West Ham lost 2–1 to Chelsea at White Hart Lane in the 1944–45 War Time Cup semi-final, with two Millwall guest-players in their team – both of whom went on to play for Millwall in the South Final, which they lost to Chelsea 2–0.Lindsay and Tarrant, p. 235

===Different leagues and hooliganism: 1946–87===

[tpl]Quote box|width=250px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=right|quote= "The volatility of the fixture reflected a warped social history. The rivalry had soured, mutated. It defied rational analysis of the fault lines between dockers and shipbuilders, founding fathers of each club. The heresy of scab labour, early in the last century, was given a murderous dimension in a subsequent generation by gangland wars involving the Krays and the Richardsons. The game was a tribal ritual, an end in itself."||source=—Michael Calvin, from his book Family: Life, Death and FootballCalvin, p. 6[/tpl]After the Second World War Millwall's form was poor and the club dropped into the Third and Fourth Division of the Football League.Lindsay and Tarrant, pp. 378–379 West Ham have never played below the Second Division in their history and often played a league or two above Millwall. The two sides did not play each other competitively between 13 October 1959 and 7 October 1978, making the 1960s the only decade the teams have not met. Despite the infrequency of their meetings, both sets of supporters still consider the other club their major rival. During these years, the Hammers enjoyed considerable success, winning the FA Cup in 1964, 1975 and 1980.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/2582091/1964-FA-Cup-final-colour-picture-special-West-Ham-3-Preston-2.html|title=1964 FA Cup final|newspaper=The Sun |location=London|accessdate=4 October 2013|first=Jim|last=Munro[/tpl] [tpl]subscription required[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Hammers nail Fulham|url=http://www.thefa.com/Competitions/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/historyofthefacup/1975westhamfulham|work=The FA|accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/8435400.stm | title=When the Hammers shocked Arsenal | publisher=BBC Sport | date=1 January 2010 | accessdate=26 January 2014 | author=Bevan, Chris[/tpl] They also won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/england-managers-how-roy-hodgsons-predecessors-fared-7703923.html?action=gallery&ino=4 | title=England managers: How Roy Hodgson's predecessors fared | newspaper=The Independent |location=London | accessdate=4 October 2013 | date=1 May 2012[/tpl] Over four decades the sides were only in the same tier of the Football League for three seasons, in 1946–47, 1947–48 and 1978–79.Lindsay and Tarrant, p. 256Lindsay and Tarrant, p. 258Lindsay and Tarrant, p. 420 They played two cup games against each other in the Southern Professional Floodlit Cup in 1959 and the Full Members Cup in 1987.Lindsay and Tarrant, p. 382Lindsay and Tarrant, p.438
Football hooliganism reached its height in the 1970s and 80s. West Ham's Inter City Firm and the Millwall Bushwackers firm were at the forefront of the trouble, not just against each other, but against the police and firms associated with other football teams.[tpl]cite book| author = Dunning, Eric| coauthors = Patrick J Murphy, John Williams| title = Football on Trial Spectator Violence and Development in the Football World| url = http://books.google.com/?id=u-aIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA91| date = 1 November 2002| publisher = Rouledge| isbn = 978-1-134-94294-7| page = 91 [/tpl][ref]
