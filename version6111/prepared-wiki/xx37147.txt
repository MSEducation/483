==History==

===City in the borders of...===

Throughout its history the city has been part of:

===Early and medieval===

The name of the town derived from the archaic Serbian word "kraguj", which is a name used for a particular species of hawk, thus the name means "hawk's nesting place".http://zastavanacionale.com/Default.aspx?lng=en-us&mode=heritage Kraguj meaning
Kragujevac experienced a lot of historical turbulence, not always without severe casualties. Over 200 archaeological sites in Šumadija confirm that the region's first human settlements occurred 40,000 years ago, during the Paleolithic era. In the Middle Ages, the area of modern Kragujevac was part of several Serbian states. Kragujevac was first mentioned in the medieval period as related to the public square built in a settlement, while the first written mention of the city was in the Ottoman Tapu-Defter in 1476.http://archive.org/details/TapuTahrirDefteri491 Tapu-DefterOttoman documents from the 15th century refer to it as a "village of Kragujevdza". The town itself gained prominence during the Ottoman period (1459–1804) as the central point in the Belgrade Pashaluk (Sanjak of Smederevo).http://terkepek.adatbank.transindex.ro/kepek/netre/51.gif Map of the Belgrade Pashaluk In 1718-1739 the town was controlled by the Habsburg Monarchy and was part of the Habsburg Kingdom of Serbia. In 1788, it was part of Kočina Krajina, an area controlled by the Serb rebels, while in 1789-1790 it was again controlled by the Habsburg Monarchy.

===Early modern period===

The city is located at crossroads. Given this location, the city has been devastated many times and has suffered great losses of life in a number of wars throughout history. It began to prosper after Serbia's liberation from Turkish rule in 1818, when Prince Miloš Obrenović proclaimed it the capital of the new Serbian State and built the Amidža Konak.http://members.virtualtourist.com/m/p/m/170468/b Amidza Konak The first Serbian constitution was proclaimed here in 1835 and the first idea of independent electoral democracy. The first law on the printing press was passed in Kragujevac in 1870. Kragujevac, the capital, was developing and cherishing modern, progressive, free ideas and resembled many European capitals of that time.http://voiceofserbia.org/serbia/node/152 Kragujevac, Once Serbian Capital
Apart from contemporary political influence, Kragujevac became the cultural and educational center of Serbia. Important institutions built during that time include Serbia's first secondary school (Gimnazija), first pharmacy, and first printing press.http://www.srpskoblago.org/history-of-serbian-culture/serbian-printing.html History of Serbian Printing Kragujevac gave rise to many international scholars, professors, academics, scientists, artists and statesmen.
The turning point in the overall development of Kragujevac was in 1851 when the Cannon Foundry began production, beginning a new era in the city’s economic development.http://www.zastava-kovacnica.co.rs/onama/istorija/istorijae.htm National Canno Foundry The main industry of the 19th and 20th century was military production. Kragujevac became one of Serbia’s largest exporters in 1886, when the main Belgrade – Niš railway connected through Kragujevac.
New centuries brought new wars. During World War I, Kragujevac again became the capital of Serbia (1914–1915), and the seat of many state institutions - even the Supreme Army Command was housed within the Court House building.http://en.europeonline-magazine.eu/kragujevac-stadt_44145.html Kragujevac Capital During the war, Kragujevac lost 15% of its population.

===Interbellum period===

The social aspect, especially theater life, in Kragujevac between the two wars was very vibrant. The first cultural event in liberated Kragujevac occurred in 1918. That was the establishment of the Theater Gundulic that worked only one season and moved to Belgrade.http://www.joakimvujic.com/english.php Theater Gundulic
Following the model of Academic Theater in Belgrade, the formation of the Kragujevac Scholars Academic Theater in 1924 was a theater that supported contemporary ideas, modern approach to stage, live word and repertoire, thus gaining the reputation of a serious art organization.http://www.hotel-lama.com/about_kragujevac.html Kragujevac Theaters There were many other cultural institutions in the city which began to grow into a large cultural and industrial hub of Central Serbia.

===WWII and the Kragujevac massacre===

Kragujevac underwent a number of ordeals, the worst probably having been the October massacre during World War II. The Kragujevac massacre was the slaughter of 2,300 to 5,000 civilians—mostly Serbs and Roma— by Nazi soldiers between 19–21 October 1941.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.antiwar.com/orig/savich3.html |title=German Occupation of Serbia and the Kragujevac Massacre | author = Carl K. Savich | publisher=Antiwar.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16[/tpl] Staniša Brkić, curator of The Museum of 21 October, published a book in 2007 where he listed names and personal data of 2,796 victims.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blic.co.rs/srbija.php?id=16913 |title=Blic Online | Srbija | "Engleska krvava bajka" u Kragujevcu |publisher=Blic.co.rs |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16[/tpl]
The killings went on from October 19 to October 21, 1941, in retaliation for a partisan attack on German soldiers. 50 people were killed if a German soldier was wounded, while 100 were slaughtered if a German soldier was killed. Among the killed was a whole generation of boys taken directly from schools. A monument for the executed pupils is a symbol of the city.http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295386-d600500-Reviews-Monument_to_the_executed_pupils-Kragujevac_Central_Serbia.html Monument to the executed pupils This atrocity has inspired a poem called "Krvava Bajka" ("Bloody Fairy Tale")
