Sigma Phi Beta is a college fraternity for gay, straight, bisexual, and transgender men in college. It was founded at Arizona State University (ASU) on September 28, 2003. It originated as the beta chapter of a now-defunct fraternity with similar values, Alpha Lambda Tau.[tpl]cite book | author=Choron, Harry and Sandra | title=College in a Can: What's In, Who's Out, Where To, Why Not, and Everything Else You Need to Know about Life on Campus| page=25 | year=2004 | isbn=0-618-40871-1 | accessdate=2009-07-29[/tpl] It disaffiliated from Alpha Lambda Tau on May 11, 2003.
According to its promoters, "The fraternity creates a unique social and educational environment for its members within the traditional Greek fraternity system, while providing all open-minded men in college with career and character building opportunities. By participating in recreational, scholastic, and community service programs, the members of Sigma Phi Beta are transforming into tomorrow's reliable leaders. Sigma Phi Beta values brotherhood, diversity, leadership, education, scholarship, fraternity life, and community service. We embrace tradition while promoting positive change that moves us forward."
It organized as a national body on July 17, 2005, adopting a constitution and bylaws and electing the first fraternity council.[tpl]citation |title=Gay fraternity creates national charter, hopes to expand |date=July 26, 2005 |url=http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid19117.asp |accessdate=2008-09-02 |periodical=The Advocate [/tpl]
