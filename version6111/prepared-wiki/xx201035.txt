==History==

The house was built in 1674 by the third Earl of LindseyPrivate Gardens of London – Lutyens Revisted Arabella Lennox-Boyd on the riverside site of Thomas More's garden and is thought to be the oldest house in Kensington and Chelsea. It was extensively remodelled in 1750 by Count Zinzendorf for the Moravian community in London.
The house was divided into four separate dwellings in 1775. Today, it occupies nos. 96 to 101 of Cheyne Walk, covering a number of separate frontages and outbuildings. Previous residents have included the historical painter John Martin, in one of the outbuildings at 4 Lindsey Row from 1849–53 and James McNeill Whistler between 1866–78 at 2 Lindsey Row (now 96 Cheyne Walk).Settlement and building: Artists and Chelsea, A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 12: Chelsea (2004), pp. 102-106 accessed: 22 May 2008. In 1808, engineer Marc Brunel lived in the middle section of the house (now no. 98), and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel grew up here.Lindsey House Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea archives accessed 22 May 2008 These residencies are commemorated by Blue plaques on the walls of the house.
The house was separated from the river by the construction of the Chelsea Embankment, completed in 1874, as a part of Joseph Bazalgette's grand scheme to create a modern sewage system. 
One part of the house features a garden designed by Edwin Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll in 1911. This is a small garden of [tpl]convert|50|ft|m|1[/tpl] by [tpl]convert|30|ft|m|1[/tpl], laid to grass, two broad paths with two narrow paths on the boundary run the length of the garden around an ancient mulberry tree and lily pond. This area is surrounded by statuary, a colonnade and a single flower border. The garden is said by Lennox-Boyd be "modest in its elements, quietly restful in its effect" and "to respect the simple formality of the house". In 2000, the garden was restored and a glazed garden room was added to the house by Marcus Beale Architects.Projects:Lindey House Marcus Beale architects accessed 24 May 2008
The National Trust house is open to the public during London Open House weekend and is Grade II* listed.
This house should not be confused with the eponymous 1640 house in Lincoln's Inn Fields. That house came to be known as Lindsey House for its occupation in the 18th century by later Earls of Lindsey.Lincoln's Inn Fields: Nos. 59 and 60 (Lindsey House), Survey of London: volume 3: St Giles-in-the-Fields, pt I: Lincoln's Inn Fields (1912), pp. 96-103] accessed: 22 May 2008.
