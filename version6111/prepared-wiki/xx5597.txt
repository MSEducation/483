Kent [tpl]IPAc-en|'|k|ɛ|n|t[/tpl] is a county in South East England, and one of the home counties. The ceremonial county boundaries of Kent include the shire county of Kent and the unitary borough of Medway. Kent has a nominal border with France halfway through the Channel Tunnel, as well as a defined boundary with Essex in the middle of the Thames Estuary. The county also borders Greater London to the North West near the towns of Swanley and Dartford, Surrey near Westerham and East Sussex near Tunbridge Wells. Maidstone is its county town and historically Rochester and Canterbury have been accorded city status, though only the latter still holds it.
Kent's location between London and continental Europe has led to it being in the front line of several conflicts, including the Battle of Britain during World War II. East Kent was known as Hell Fire Corner during the conflict. England has relied on the county's ports to provide warships through much of the past 800 years; the Cinque Ports in the 12th–14th centuries and Chatham Dockyard in the 16th–20th centuries were of particular importance to the country's security. France can be seen clearly in fine weather from Folkestone, and the iconic White Cliffs of Dover.
Because of its abundance of orchards and hop gardens, Kent is traditionally known as "The Garden of England" – a name often applied when marketing the county or its produce, although other regions have tried to lay claim to the title.Kent loses its Garden of England title to North Yorkshire. The Guardian 1 June 2006Garden of England title defended, BBC. 1 June 2006  Major industries in the north-west of Kent have included cement, papermaking, and aircraft construction, but these are now in decline. Large parts of Kent are within the London commuter belt. South and East Kent rely on tourism and agriculture. Coal mining has also played its part in Kent's industrial heritage.

==History==

The area has been occupied since the Palaeolithic era, as attested by finds from the quarries at Swanscombe. The Medway megaliths were built during the Neolithic era. There is a rich sequence of Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Roman era occupation, as indicated by finds and features such as the Ringlemere gold cup and the Roman villas of the Darent valley.[tpl]cite book | last=Ashbee|first=Paul|title = Kent in prehistoric times  | publisher=Tempus | year = 2005 [/tpl]
The modern name of Kent is derived from the Brythonic word Cantus meaning "rim" or "border". This describes the eastern part of the current county area as a border land or coastal district.  Julius Caesar had described the area as Cantium, or home of the Cantiaci in 51 BC.[tpl]cite book | last=Glover|first=J.|title = Place names of Kent [/tpl]
The extreme west of the modern county was occupied by Iron Age tribes, known as the Regnenses. It is possible that another ethnic group occupied what is now called The Weald and East Kent. East Kent became a kingdom of the Jutes during the 5th century[tpl]cite book | last=Witney|first=K. P.|title = The Kingdom of Kent | year=1982[/tpl] and was known as Cantia from about 730 and as Cent in 835. The early medieval inhabitants of the county were known as the Cantwara, or Kent people. These people regarded the city of Canterbury as their capital.[tpl]cite web | title = Victoria County History of Kent | publisher=KentArchaeology.org.uk | url = http://www.kentarchaeology.org.uk/Research/03/03/01C/064.htm|date=May 2006 | accessdate =20 April 2007 [/tpl]
In 597, Pope Gregory I appointed Augustine as the first Archbishop of Canterbury. In the previous year, Augustine successfully converted the pagan King Æthelberht of Kent to Christianity. The Diocese of Canterbury became Britain's first Episcopal See and has since remained Britain's centre of Christianity.[tpl]cite web | title = Archbishop of Canterbury | publisher=Spartacus.SchoolNet.co.uk | url = http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/NORarchcanterbury.htm | accessdate =19 June 2007 [/tpl]
In the 11th century, the people of Kent adopted the motto Invicta, meaning "undefeated". This naming followed the invasion of Britain by William of Normandy. The Kent people's continued resistance against the Normans led to Kent's designation as a semi-autonomous county palatine in 1067. Under the nominal rule of William's half-brother Odo of Bayeux, the county was granted similar powers to those granted in the areas bordering Wales and Scotland.[tpl]cite book|author=David Bates|title = The Character and Career of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux (1049/50-1097) |publisher=Speculum | year = 1975 [/tpl]
During the medieval and early modern period, Kent played a major role in several of England's most notable rebellions, including the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, led by Wat Tyler,[tpl]cite web | title = Peasants' Revolt | publisher=Britannia.com | url = http://www.britannia.com/history/articles/peasantsrevolt.html | accessdate =20 April 2007 [/tpl]

The Royal Navy first used the River Medway in 1547. By the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) a small dockyard had been established at Chatham. By 1618, storehouses, a ropewalk, a drydock, and houses for officials had been built downstream from Chatham.[tpl]cite book  | title = The Historic Dockyard Chatham — where legends were created  | publisher=Jarrold Publishing  |year = 2005 [/tpl]
By the 17th century, tensions between Britain and the powers of the Netherlands and France led to increasing military build-up in the county. Forts were built all along the coast following the raid on the Medway, a successful attack by the Dutch navy on the shipyards of the Medway towns in 1667.[tpl]cite web  | title = The Dutch In The Medway  | publisher=DeRuyter.org | url = http://www.deruyter.org/CHATHAM_Dutch_in_the_Medway.html  | accessdate =20 April 2007 [/tpl]
The 18th century was dominated by wars with France, during which the Medway became the primary base for a fleet that could act along the Dutch and French coasts. When the theatre of operation moved to the Atlantic, this role was assumed by Portsmouth and Plymouth, with Chatham concentrating on shipbuilding and ship repair.  As an indication of the area's military importance, the first Ordnance Survey map ever drawn was a one-inch map of Kent, published in 1801.[tpl]cite book |last= Oliver|first=Richard| title = Ordnance Survey maps: a concise guide for historians 2nd Ed | publisher=Ordnance Survey | year = 1995 |isbn=1-870598-24-5[/tpl] Many of the Georgian naval buildings still stand.
In the early 19th century, smugglers were very active on the Kent coastline. Gangs such as The Aldington Gang brought spirits, tobacco and salt to the county, and transported goods such as wool across the sea to France.[tpl]cite web  | title = South-East England  | publisher=Smuggler's Britain | url = http://www.smuggling.co.uk/gazetteer_se_14.html  | accessdate =20 April 2007 [/tpl]
In 1889, the County of London was created and the townships of Deptford, Greenwich, Woolwich, Lee, Eltham, Charlton, Kidbrooke and Lewisham were transferred out of Kent and in 1900 the area of Penge was gained. Some of Kent is contiguous with the Greater London sprawl, notably parts of Dartford.
During World War II, much of the Battle of Britain was fought in the skies over the county. Between June 1944 and March 1945, over 10,000 V1 flying bombs or "Doodlebugs", were fired toward London from bases in Northern France. Although many were destroyed by aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, and barrage balloons, both London and Kent were hit by around 2,500 of these bombs.
After the war, Kent's borders changed several more times. In 1965 the London boroughs of Bromley and Bexley were created from nine towns formerly in Kent.[tpl]cite book|last=Jessup|first=Frank W.|title =Kent History Illustrated |publisher=Kent County Council| year = 1966  [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Medway | publisher=Communities and Local Government | url = http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1170128 | accessdate =20 April 2007 [/tpl] In 1998, Rochester, Chatham, Gillingham, and Rainham left the administrative county of Kent to form the Unitary Authority of Medway. During this reorganisation, through an "apparent" administrative oversight, the city of Rochester lost its official city status.[tpl]cite news  | title = Error costs Rochester city status |publisher=BBC News  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/england/1991827.stm | date=16 May 2002 | accessdate =20 April 2007[/tpl]
For almost nine centuries a small part of present day East London (the North Woolwich, London E16 area), formed part of Kent. The most likely reason for this is that in 1086 Hamon, dapifer and Sheriff of Kent owned the manor and, perhaps illegally, annexed it to Kent. It ceased to be considered part of the county in 1965 upon creation of the London Borough of Newham.

==Climate==

Kent is one of the warmest parts of Britain. On 10 August 2003, in the hamlet of Brogdale near Faversham the temperature reached 38.5 °C (101.3 °F), the hottest temperature ever recorded in the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web | title = UK Records | publisher=BBC Weather | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/uk_records.shtml| accessdate =10 June 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Physical geography==

Kent is in the southeastern corner of England. It borders the River Thames and the North Sea to the north, and the Straits of Dover and the English Channel to the south. France is [tpl]convert|34|km|mi|0[/tpl] across the Strait.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title = English Channel | publisher=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007 | url = http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefArticle.aspx?refid=761564966 | accessdate =20 April 2007 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257036635752931|archivedate=1 November 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
The major geographical features of the county are determined by a series of ridges and valleys running east-west across the county. These are the results of erosion of the Wealden dome, a dome across Kent and Sussex created by alpine movements 10–20 million years ago. This dome consists of an upper layer of chalk above successive layers of Upper Greensand, Gault Clay, Lower Greensand, Weald Clay, and Wealden sandstone. The ridges and valleys formed when the exposed clay eroded faster than the exposed chalk, greensand, or sandstone.
Sevenoaks, Maidstone, Ashford, and Folkestone are built on greensand, while Ditton, Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells are built on sandstone. Dartford, Gravesend, the Medway towns, Sittingbourne, Faversham, Canterbury, Deal, and Dover are built on chalk.[tpl]cite book | title = Greensand Way in Kent | publisher=Kent Count Council | year = 1992|isbn=1-873010-23-0[/tpl]Britain's Structure and Scenery, L.Dudley Stamp, Pub September 1946, Collins New Naturalist Series. The easterly section of the Wealden dome has been eroded away by the sea, and cliffs such as the White Cliffs of Dover are present where a chalk ridge known as the North Downs meets the coast. Spanning Dover and Westerham is the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.[tpl]cite web | title = Kent Downs | publisher=KentDowns.org | url = http://www.kentdowns.org.uk/ | accessdate =20 April 2007 [/tpl]
The Wealden dome is a Mesozoic structure lying on a Palaeozoic foundation, which can often create the right conditions for coal formation. This is found in East Kent roughly between Deal, Canterbury, and Dover. The Coal Measures within the Westphalian Sandstone are deep about 250 m – 400 m (800 – 1300 ft) and subject to flooding. They occur in two major troughs, which extend under the English Channel where similar coalfields are located.[tpl]cite web | title = Geology of Kent and Boulonnais | publisher=The Geology Shop | url=http://www.geologyshop.co.uk/geolkb.htm | year=2000 | accessdate =8 August 2009 [/tpl]
Seismic activity has occasionally been recorded in Kent, though the epicentres were offshore. In 1382 and 1580 there were two earthquakes exceeding 6.0 on the Richter Scale. In 1776, 1950, and on 28 April 2007 there were earthquakes of around 4.3. The 2007 earthquake caused physical damage in Folkestone.[tpl]cite news | title = Quake causes Kent Families to flee Homes |work=The Guardian |location=UK | url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2068090,00.html | date=29 April 2007 | accessdate =28 April 2007  | first=Amelia | last=Hill[/tpl]
The coastline of Kent is continuously changing, due to tectonic uplift and coastal erosion. Until about 960, the Isle of Thanet was an island, separated by the Wantsum channel, formed around a deposit of chalk; over time, the channels silted up with alluvium. Similarly Romney Marsh and Dungeness have been formed by accumulation of alluvium.
Kent's principal river, the River Medway, rises near East Grinstead in Sussex and flows eastwards to Maidstone. Here it turns north and breaks through the North Downs at Rochester, then joins the estuary of the River Thames as its final tributary near Sheerness. The Medway is some [tpl]convert|112|km|mi|0[/tpl] long.Environmental Agency: River Medway The river is tidal as far as Allington lock, but in earlier times, cargo-carrying vessels reached as far upstream as Tonbridge.[tpl]cite book | last=Bowskill|first=Derek | title = Map Of The River Medway [/tpl] The Medway has captured the head waters of other rivers such as the River Darent. Other rivers of Kent include the River Stour in the east.

==Demographics==

As of the 2001 UK census, Kent, including Medway, had 1,329,718 residents and 646,308 households, of which 1,329,718 residents and 546,742 households were within the administrative boundaries. Of those households, 48.9% were married couples living together, 9.0% were co-habiting couples and 8.7% were lone parents; 28.0% of households consisted of individuals, 14.6% had someone of pensionable age living alone, and 30.4% included children aged under 16 or a person aged 16 to 18 who was in full-time education. For every 100 females, there were 93.9 males.
The 2011 census showed the ethnicity of Kent to be 89.1% White British, 4.6%  other White, 1.6% South Asian and 1.1% Black[tpl]cite web | title = 2011 Census, Key Statistics for Local Authorities in England and Wales - 2011 Census: KS201EW Ethnic group, local authorities in England and Wales | publisher=Office for National Statistics | url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262 | accessdate = 1 February 2013[/tpl]
Religion was recorded in 2001 as 74.6% Christian, 0.7% Sikh, 0.6% Muslim, 0.4% Hindu, 0.2% Buddhist and 0.1% Jewish, while 15.2% were recorded as having no religion, 0.3% had an alternative religion, and 7.8% did not state their religion.

==Government==

Kent County Council (KCC) and its 12 district councils administer most of the county (3352 km²), while the Medway Towns Council, a unitary authority and commonly called Medway Council, administers the more densely populated remainder (192 km²).Kent (Borough of Gillingham and City of Rochester upon Medway) (Structural Change) Order 1996 [tpl]cite web | title =  Kent (Borough of Gillingham and City of Rochester upon Medway) (Structural Change) Order 1996 | publisher=HMSO | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1876/contents/made| accessdate =17 March 2010 [/tpl] Together they have around 300 town and parish councils.

As of the 2009 county council elections, Kent County Council was controlled by the Conservatives, which won 74 of the Council's 84 seats, 7 were won by the Liberal Democrats, 2 by the Labour Party and 1 by the Swanscombe and Greenhithe Residents Association. As of the 2007 local elections, Medway Council was controlled by the Conservatives; 33 of the Council's 55 seats were held by the Conservatives, 13 by the Labour Party, 8 by the Liberal Democrats and 1 by an Independent.[tpl]cite web  | title = Democratically elected representatives in Medway  | publisher=Medway Council | url = http://www.medway.gov.uk/index/council/councillor.htm  | accessdate =13 May 2007  | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070512225213/http://www.medway.gov.uk/index/council/councillor.htm   | archivedate =12 May 2007 [/tpl] All of Kent's district councils are controlled by the Conservatives.
At the national level, Kent is represented in Parliament by 17 MPs, all of whom are Conservative.

==Economy==

As of the 2001 UK census,[tpl]cite web | title = Neighbourhood Statistics | publisher=Statistics.gov.uk | url = http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=3567663&c=Kent&d=180&e=13&g=456741&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1367781204136&enc=1&dsFamilyId=75  | accessdate =5 May 2013 [/tpl] employment statistics for the residents in Kent, including Medway, were as follows: 41.1% in full-time employment, 12.4% in part-time employment, 9.1% self-employed, 2.9% unemployed, 2.3% students with jobs, 3.7% students without jobs, 12.3% retired, 7.3% looking after home or family, 4.3% permanently sick or disabled, and 2.7% economically inactive for other reasons. Of residents aged 16–74, 16% had a higher education qualification or the equivalent, compared to 20% nationwide.
The average hours worked per week by residents of Kent were 43.1 for males and 30.9 for females. Their industry of employment was 17.3% retail, 12.4% manufacturing, 11.8% real estate, 10.3% health and social work, 8.9% construction, 8.2% transport and communications, 7.9% education, 6.0% public administration and defence, 5.6% finance, 4.8% other community and personal service activities, 4.1% hotels and restaurants, 1.6% agriculture, 0.8% energy and water supply, 0.2% mining, and 0.1% private households. This is higher than the whole of England for construction and transport/communications, and lower for manufacturing.
Kent is sometimes known as the "Garden of England" for its abundance of orchards and hop gardens. Distinctive hop-drying buildings called oasts are common in the countryside, although many have been converted into dwellings. Nearer to London, market gardens also flourish.
Kent is the main area for hazelnut production in the UK.[tpl]cite web | title = Hazelnut and walnut production | publisher=Calu | url = http://www.agmrc.org/media/cms/050402Cobnutsandwalnuts_5A03AFB4B3709.pdf|format=PDF | accessdate = 15 January 2013 [/tpl] However, in recent years, there has been a significant drop in agriculture, and industry and services are increasing their utilisation of the area. This is illustrated by the following table of economic indicator gross value added (GVA) between 1995 and 2000 (figures are in millions of British Pounds Sterling).[tpl]cite web | title = Regional Gross Value Added | publisher=Office for National Statistics | url = http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_economy/RegionalGVA.pdf|format=PDF | accessdate =3 April 2007 [/tpl]

North Kent is heavily industrialised with cement-making at Northfleet and Cuxton, brickmaking at Sittingbourne, shipbuilding on the Medway and Swale, engineering and aircraft design and construction at Rochester, chemicals at Dartford and papermaking at Swanley, and oil refining at Grain. A steel mini mill in Sheerness and a rolling mill in Queenborough.There are two nuclear power stations at Dungeness, although the older one, built in 1965, was closed at the end of 2006.[tpl]cite news | title = Closure of Dungeness Power Station |publisher=BBC News  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/6203953.stm |date=31 December 2006 | accessdate =3 April 2007 [/tpl]
Cement-making, papermaking, and coal-mining were important industries in Kent during the 19th and 20th century. Cement came to the fore in the 19th century when massive building projects were undertaken. The ready supply of chalk and huge pits between Stone and Gravesend bear testament to that industry. There were also other workings around Burham on the tidal Medway.[tpl]cite web | title = The Chatham News Index | publisher=Parret & Neves | url = http://www.gparrett.btinternet.co.uk/chatnews/cnidx_r2.pdf |format=PDF |year=1996 |accessdate =19 April 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061014102733/http://www.gparrett.btinternet.co.uk/chatnews/cnidx_r2.pdf|archivedate=14 October 2006[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot[/tpl]
Kent's original paper mills stood on streams like the River Darent, tributaries of the River Medway, and on the River Stour. Two 18th century mills were on the River Len and at Tovil on the River Loose. In the late 19th century huge modern mills were built at Dartford and Northfleet on the River Thames and at Kemsley on The Swale. In pre-industrial times, almost every village and town had its own windmill or watermill, with over 400 windmills known to have stood at some time. Twenty eight survive within the county today, plus two replica mills and a further two in that part of Kent now absorbed into London. All the major rivers in the county were used to power watermills.
From about 1900, several coal pits operated in East Kent. The Kent Coalfield was mined during the 20th century at several collieries,[tpl]cite web | title = Coal fields Heritage Initiative | publisher=Dover Museum | url = http://www.dover.gov.uk/kentcoal/intro.asp | accessdate =20 April 2007 [/tpl]
including Chislet, Tilmanstone, Betteshanger, and the Snowdown Colliery, which ran from 1908 to 1986.[tpl]cite web | title = Snowdown Colliery | publisher=FreeUK.com | url = http://home.freeuk.com/eastkent/mining/snowdown_colliery.htm | accessdate =19 April 2007 [/tpl]
The west of the county (including Maidstone, Tunbridge Wells & Sevenoaks) is generally more affluent than the east, especially when compared to the coastal regions of Folkestone, Dover & Thanet. This is partly due to the former's proximity to London, making it prime "commuter belt" and the latter's geographic extremities. The eagerly awaited CTRL 2009 rail service, using the high speed Channel Tunnel line to bring coastal areas' travel times to London down to around an hour, is hoped to further regeneration.

==Arts==

Kent has provided inspiration for several notable writers and artists. Canterbury's religious role gave rise to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, a key development in the English language. The father of novelist Charles Dickens worked at the Chatham Dockyard; in many of his books, the celebrated novelist featured the scenery of Chatham, Rochester, and the Cliffe marshes.[tpl]cite web | title = Charles Dickens | publisher=InfoBritain | url = http://www.infobritain.co.uk/Charles_Dickens.htm | accessdate =20 April 2007 [/tpl]

==Transport==

===Roads===

With the Roman invasion, a road network was constructed to connect London to the Channel ports of Dover, Lympne and Richborough. The London–Dover road was Watling Street. These roads are now approximately the A2, B2068, A257, and the A28. The A2 runs through Dartford (A207), Gravesend, Rochester, Canterbury and Dover; the A20 through Eltham, Wrotham, Maidstone, Charing, Ashford. Hythe, Folkestone and Dover; the A21 around Sevenoaks, Tonbridge, Tunbridge Wells and on to Hastings in East Sussex. In the 1960s, two motorways were built; the M2 from Medway to Faversham, and the M20 from Swanley to Folkestone. Part of the M25 runs through Kent, from Westerham to the Kent and Essex tunnel at Dartford. The Dartford tunnel has been joined by the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, together providing four lanes in each direction. The M26 motorway, built in 1980, provides a short link between the M25 at Sevenoaks and the M20 near Wrotham. Kent currently has more motorways by distance than any other county in the UK, with sections of the M2, M20, M25 and M26 totalling 173 km within the extents of the ceremonial county.

===Water===

The medieval Cinque Ports, except for Dover, have all now silted up. The Medway Estuary has been an important port and naval base for 500 years. The River Medway is tidal up to Allington and navigable up to Tonbridge. Kent's two canals are the Royal Military Canal between Hythe and Rye, which still exists, and the Thames and Medway Canal between Strood and Gravesend. Built in 1824, it was purchased in 1846 by the railways, which partially backfilled it. Container ports are located at Ramsgate and Thamesport.

===Railways===

The earliest locomotive-driven passenger-carrying railway in Britain was the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway which opened in 1830.[tpl]cite web | title = The lost railway |publisher=BBC | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/content/articles/2008/05/27/history_lost_railway_feature.shtml| accessdate =1 August 2008 [/tpl] This and the London and Greenwich Railway later merged into South Eastern Railway (SER).[tpl]cite web | title = History of the South Eastern & Chatham Railway| publisher=The South Eastern & Chatham Railway Society | url = http://www.southeasternandchathamrailway.org.uk/webpages/History.htm | accessdate =22 April 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061101091806/http://www.southeasternandchathamrailway.org.uk/webpages/History.htm |archivedate = 1 November 2006[/tpl]
By the 1850s, SER's networks had expanded to Ashford, Ramsgate, Canterbury, Tunbridge Wells, and the Medway towns. SER's major London termini were London Bridge, Charing Cross, and Cannon Street. Kent also had a second major railway, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR). Originally the East Kent Railway in 1858, it linked the northeast Kent coast with London terminals at Victoria and Blackfriars.
The two companies merged in 1899, forming the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), further amalgamated with other railways by the Railways Act 1921 to form the Southern Railway. Britain's railways were nationalised in 1948, forming British Rail. The railways were privatised in 1996 and most Kent passenger services were franchised to Connex South Eastern.[tpl]cite news | title = Failed rail franchise 'needed time'|publisher=BBC  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3268719.stm | date=13 November 2003 | accessdate =13 May 2007 [/tpl] Following financial difficulties, Connex lost the franchise and was replaced by South Eastern Trains and after Southeastern.[tpl]cite news|title = Rail workers vote to hold strikes |publisher=BBC  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4905966.stm|date=13 April 2006|accessdate =13 May 2007 [/tpl]
The Channel Tunnel was completed in 1994 and High Speed 1 in November 2007 with a London terminus at St Pancras. A new station, Ebbsfleet International, opened between Dartford and Gravesend, serving northern Kent.[tpl]cite news | title = New station means Eurostar change |publisher=BBC  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/5337586.stm | date=12 September 2006 | accessdate =22 April 2007 [/tpl] The high speed lines will be utilised to provide a faster train service to coastal towns like Ramsgate and Folkestone. This station is in addition to the existing station at Ashford International, which has suffered a massive cut in service as a result.
In addition to the "main line" railways, there are several light, heritage, and industrial railways in Kent. There are three heritage, standard gauge railways; Spa Valley Railway near Tunbridge Wells on the old Tunbridge Wells West branch, East Kent Railway on the old East Kent coalfield area and the Kent and East Sussex Railway on the Weald around Tenterden. In addition there is the [tpl]convert|15|in|mm|sing=on[/tpl] gauge, tourist-oriented Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway on the southeast Kent coast along the Dungeness peninsula. Finally, there is the [tpl]convert|2|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on[/tpl], industrial Sittingbourne & Kemsley Light Railway.

===Air===

A limited number of charter flights are provided by Kent's Kent International Airport at Manston, and London Ashford Airport at Lydd. However, most passengers across the South East use the larger Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton airports. In 2002, it was revealed that the government was considering building a new four-runway airport on the marshland near the village of Cliffe on the Hoo Peninsula.[tpl]cite news | title = Airport plan threatens Dickens' legacy |publisher=BBC  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2093415.stm | date=12 September 2006 | accessdate =20 June 2007 | first=Matthew | last=Davis[/tpl] This plan was dropped in 2003 following protests by cultural and environmental groups.[tpl]cite news | title = Saving nature |work=The Times |location=UK | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/related_features/love_nature/article3625154.ece | date=23 March 2008 | accessdate =6 September 2009  | first=Advertisement | last=Feature[/tpl]

The University for the Creative Arts (UCA) also has three of its five campuses in the county.

providing school places for over 289,000 pupils.

For the 2005–06 school year, KCC and Medway introduced a standardised school year, based on six terms, as recommended by the Local Government Association in its 2000 report, "The Rhythms of Schooling".[tpl]cite web | title = Kent County Council | publisher=Kent County Council | url = http://www.kent.gov.uk/ | accessdate =3 April 2007 [/tpl]
Kent County Council LEA maintains 96 secondary schools, of which 33 are selective schools and 63 are secondary modern schools.

===National Challenge schools===

Kent has the highest number of National Challenge schools in England, schools which are branded "failing" based on the British Government's floor targets that 30% of pupils achieve at least 5 GCSE grades A* to C.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7070190.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Brown threatens 'failing' schools | date=31 October 2007 | accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl] Of the 63 secondary modern schools, 33 achieved below this requirement meaning that 52% of Kent secondary modern schools (34% out of all 96 maintained secondary schools) are failing.http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/nationalchallenge/downloads/DataSheet.pdf

==Local media==

===Television===

Much of Kent is served by the BBC's South East region, which is based in Tunbridge Wells and provides local news for the county and East Sussex. Its commercial rival is ITV Meridian Ltd, which has a newsroom at The Maidstone Studios despite the main studio being based in Hampshire. Main transmitters providing these services are located at West Hougham, near Dover and Bluebell Hill, located between Chatham and Maidstone. Those parts of Kent closer to London such as Swanley, Dartford, Gravesend and parts of Sevenoaks lie within the ITV London and BBC London areas, taking their television signals from the Crystal Palace transmitter.
The county is also served by two internet-based TV channels, Kent TV (part-owned by Kent County Council) and YourKentTV which is owned by KOS Media.

===Radio===

Kent has three county-wide stations – BBC Radio Kent, based in Tunbridge Wells; and the commercial stations Heart and Gold, both based in Whitstable and London.
Most of the county is covered by local radio network KMFM, owned by the KM Group. Since March 2012,  programmes are the same across all seven stations in the network:
The county has eight community radio stations.
Dover Community Radio (DCR) offers a podcasting service for the people of Dover district on their website, hoping in the future to apply for a community radio licence to cover the town and its environs.

===Newspapers===

The KM Group, KOS Media and Kent Regional News and Media all provide local newspapers for most of the large towns and cities. County-wide papers include the Kent Messenger, Kent on Saturday, Kent on Sunday, and the Kent and Sussex Courier.
