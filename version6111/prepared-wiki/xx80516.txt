[[Yeongdong (region)]]

CATEGORIES: Regions of Korea

This article is about 'Yeongdong,' a region in eastern Korea.  For the county of the same name in North Chungcheong Province, South Korea, see Yeongdong County.
Yeongdong (literally "east of the passes") is the name of the region coinciding with eastern Gangwon Province in South Korea and eastern Kangw≈èn Province in North Korea.
Although Yeongseo describes the western half of the two provinces and Gwandong describes both halves together, "Yeongdong" is used much more frequently in South Korea than either of the other two names, and may be taken loosely to refer to the entire region.
The region's name lends itself to the Yeongdong Railway Line and Yeongdong Expressway, which are major transportation corridors connecting Seoul to Gangwon.
