Sheffield Collegiate School began in 1836 in new buildings on the corner of Ecclesall Road and Collegiate Crescent (now Grade II listed and part of Sheffield Hallam University[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=456645&mode=quick |title=Detailed Record |publisher=Imagesofengland.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24[/tpl]). The school enjoyed academic success but lacked sound finances and was taken over by Sheffield Grammar School in 1884, to become Sheffield Royal Grammar School (SRGS) in 1885.
In 1905 Sheffield City Council acquired both Wesley College and SRGS and they were merged on the site of the former to form King Edward VII School (KES), named after the reigning monarch.
