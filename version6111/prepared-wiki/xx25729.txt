Ellesmere Island (Inuit: Umingmak Nuna, meaning "land of Muskox")Lyle Dick. Muskox Land: Ellesmere Island in the age of contact. University of Calgary Press, 2001. is part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region of the Canadian territory of Nunavut. Lying within the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, it is considered part of the Queen Elizabeth Islands, with Cape Columbia being the most northerly point of land in Canada. It comprises an area of [tpl]convert|196235|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] and the total length of the island is [tpl]convert|830|km|mi[/tpl], making it the world's tenth largest island and Canada's third largest island. The Arctic Cordillera mountain system covers much of Ellesmere Island, making it the most mountainous in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The Arctic willow is the only woody species to grow on Ellesmere Island.[tpl]cite news |url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/local/researcher-study-of-poles-needed/article_a03b1dec-d2bf-512c-84f0-f6352b5e9e72.html |title=Researcher: Study of poles needed |author=Ed Kemmick |publisher=Billingsgazette.net |date=October 25, 2007 |accessdate=October 25, 2007[/tpl]

==History==

The first human inhabitants of Ellesmere Island were small bands drawn to the area for Peary caribou, muskox, and marine mammal hunting about 2000–1000 BC.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/archeo/oracles/eskimos/12.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080923232404/http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/archeo/oracles/eskimos/12.htm |archivedate=September 23, 2008 |author=Civilization.ca |title=Arctic History[/tpl]
As was the case for the Dorset (or Palaeoeskimo) hunters and the pioneering Neoeskimos, the Post-Ruin Island and Late Thule culture Inuit used the Bache Peninsula region extensively both summer and winter until environmental, ecological, and possibly social circumstances caused the area to be abandoned. It was the last region in the Canadian High Arctic to be depopulated during the Little Ice Age, attesting to its general economic importance as part of the Smith Sound culture sphere of which it was occasionally a part and sometimes the principal settlement component.[tpl]cite book|title=Late Thule culture developments on the central east coast of Ellesmere Island|last1=Schledermann|first1=P|last2=McCullough|first2=KM|location=Copenhagen, Denmark|publisher=Danish Polar Center|year=2003[/tpl]
Vikings from the Greenland colonies reached Ellesmere Island, Skraeling Island, and Ruin Island during hunting expeditions and trading with the Inuit groups. Unusual structures on Bache peninsula may be the remains of a late-period Dorset stone longhouse.[tpl]cite journal|first=Peter|last=Schledermann|title=Eskimo and Viking Finds in the High Arctic|journal=National Geographic Magazine|volume=159|date=May 1981|page=584|issue=5[/tpl]
The first European to sight the island after the height of the Little Ice Age was William Baffin in 1616. Ellesmere Island was named in 1852 by Edward Inglefield's expedition after Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/ellesmere-island|title=Ellesmere Island|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia Online|accessdate=April 23, 2009[/tpl] The US expedition led by Adolphus Greely in 1881 crossed the island from east to west,[tpl]cite book |last=Dick|first=Lyle |title=Muskox Land: Ellesmere Island in the age of contact |publisher=University of Calgary Press |year=2001 |page=631[/tpl] establishing Fort Conger in the northern part of the island. The Greely expedition found fossil forests on Ellesmere Island in the late 1880s.  Stenkul Fiord was first explored in 1902 by Per Schei, a member of Otto Sverdrup's 2nd Norwegian Polar Expedition.
The Ellesmere Ice Shelf was documented by the British Arctic Expedition of 1875–76, in which Lieutenant Pelham Aldrich's party went from Cape Sheridan ([tpl]coord|82|28|N|61|30|W|display=inline|type:landmark_scale:500000_region:CA-NU|name=Cape Sheridan (Ellesmere Island)[/tpl]) west to Cape Alert ([tpl]coord|82|16|N|85|33|W|display=inline|type:landmark_scale:600000_region:CA-NU|name=Cape Alert (Ellesmere Island)[/tpl]), including the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf. In 1906 Robert Peary led an expedition in northern Ellesmere Island, from Cape Sheridan along the coast to the western side of Nansen Sound (93°W). During Peary's expedition, the Ice Shelf was continuous; a modern estimate is that it covered [tpl]convert|8900|km2|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite journal|last=Jeffries|first=Martin O.|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic39-1-15.pdf|title=Ice Island Calvings and Ice Shelf Changes, Milne Ice Shelf and Ayles Ice Shelf, Ellesmere Island, N.W.T|journal=Arctic|volume=39|issue=1|date=March 1986[/tpl]
In 2011, Jon Turk and Erik Boomer completed the first known circumnavigation of Ellesmere Island.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/sports/arctic-adventure-a-1500-mile-trip-by-sea-kayak.html?_r=3&|title=Odd Couple’s Amazing Trek: 1,500 Arctic Miles by Kayak|date=2012-01-18 | work=The New York Times[/tpl]

==Geography==

Ellesmere Island is separated to the east by Nares Strait from Greenland, to the west by Eureka Sound and Nansen Sound from Axel Heiberg Island, and to the south by Jones Sound and Cardigan Strait from Devon Island.

===Protected areas===

More than one-fifth of the island is protected as Quttinirpaaq National Park (formerly Ellesmere Island National Park Reserve), which includes seven fjords and a variety of glaciers, as well as Lake Hazen, North America's largest lake north of the Arctic Circle. Barbeau Peak, the highest mountain in Nunavut ([tpl]convert|2616|m|abbr=on|disp=/[/tpl]) is located in the British Empire Range on Ellesmere Island. The most northern mountain range in the world, the Challenger Mountains, is located in the northeast region of the island. The northern lobe of the island is called Grant Land.
In July 2007, a study noted the disappearance of habitat for waterfowl, invertebrates, and algae on Ellesmere Island. According to John P. Smol of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, and Marianne S. V. Douglas of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, warming conditions and evaporation have caused low water levels and changes in the chemistry of ponds and wetlands in the area. The researchers noted that "In the 1980s they often needed to wear hip waders to make their way to the ponds...while by 2006 the same areas were dry enough to burn."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.enn.com/wildlife/article/6859|title=Northern Canada Ponds Drying Up|publisher=ENN|accessdate=2014-02-03[/tpl]

===Glaciers and ice caps===

Large portions of Ellesmere Island are covered with glaciers and ice, with Manson Icefield ([tpl]convert|6200|km2|mi2|abbr=on|disp=/[/tpl]) and Sydkap ([tpl]convert|3700|km2|mi2|abbr=on|disp=/[/tpl]) in the south; Prince of Wales Icefield ([tpl]convert|20700|km2|mi2|abbr=on|disp=/[/tpl]) and Agassiz Ice Cap ([tpl]convert|21500|km2|mi2|abbr=on|disp=/[/tpl]) along the central-east side of the island, and the Northern Ellesmere icefields ([tpl]convert|24400|km2|mi2|abbr=on|disp=/[/tpl]).[tpl]cite journal|last1=Wolken|first1=G.|last2=Sharp|first2=M.|last3=Wang|first3=L.|title=Snow and ice facies variability and ice layer formation on Canadian Arctic ice caps, 1999-2005|journal=Jrnl Geophysical Research|volume=114|pages=3011|year=2009|doi=10.1029/2008JF001173  |url=http://arctic.eas.ualberta.ca/downloads/Wolken%20et%20al_2009_Snow%20and%20ice%20facies%20variability%20and%20ice%20layer%20formation%20in%20the%20QEI%201999-2005.pdf|bibcode=2009JGRF..114.3011W[/tpl]
The northwest coast of Ellesmere Island was covered by a massive, [tpl]convert|500|km|abbr=on[/tpl] long ice shelf until the 20th century. The Ellesmere Ice Shelf shrank by 90 percent in the twentieth century due to climate change, leaving the separate Alfred Ernest, Ayles, Milne, Ward Hunt, and Markham Ice Shelves.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/30/science/earth/30ice.html?_r=3&|title=Arctic Ice Shelf Broke Off Canadian Island|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 30, 2006|first=Andrew C.|last=Revkin[/tpl] A 1986 survey of Canadian ice shelves found that [tpl]convert|48|km2|abbr=on|disp=/[/tpl]/[tpl]convert|3.3|km3|abbr=on|disp=/[/tpl] of ice calved from the Milne and Ayles ice shelves between 1959 and 1974.

In 2006, University of Chicago paleontologist Neil Shubin and Academy of Natural Sciences paleontologist Ted Daeschler reported the discovery of the fossil of a Paleozoic (ca. 375 Ma) fish, named Tiktaalik roseae, in the former stream beds of Ellesmere Island. The fossil exhibits many characteristics of fish, but also indicates a transitional creature that may be a predecessor of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, including humans.[tpl]cite news|title=Fossil Called Missing Link From Sea to Land Animals |work=The New York Times |date=April 6, 2006 |last=Wilford|first=John Noble |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/06/science/06fossil.html?_r=3&[/tpl]

===Insect ecology===

Ellesmere Island is noted as being the northernmost occurrence of eusocial insects; specifically, the bumblebee Bombus polaris. There is a second species of bumblebee occurring there, Bombus hyperboreus, which is a parasite in the nests of B. polaris.Milliron H.E., Oliver D.R. (1966) Bumblebees from northern Ellesmere Island, with observations on usurpation by Megabombus hyperboreus (Schönh.), Can. Entomol. 98:207–213

==Population==

In 2006, the population of Ellesmere Island was recorded as 146. There are three settlements on Ellesmere Island, Alert (pop. 5),Statistics Canada Eureka (permanent pop. 0, but home to a small temporary population), and Grise Fiord (pop. 141).2006 census Politically, it is part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region.
Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Alert is the northernmost settlement in the world. With the end of the Cold War and the advent of new technologies allowing for remote interpretation of data, the overwintering population has been reduced to 5.
Eureka, which is the second northernmost settlement in the world, consists of three areas, "Eureka Aerodrome" which includes "Fort Eureka" (the quarters for military personnel maintaining the island's communications equipment), the Environment Canada Weather Station, and the Polar Environmental Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL), formally the Arctic Stratospheric Ozone (AStrO) Observatory. Eureka has the lowest average annual temperature and least precipitation of any weather station in Canada.

==In popular culture==

In the 2013 American superhero film Man of Steel, Ellesmere Island was the site of a combined U.S.-Canadian scientific expedition to recover an ancient Kryptonian spaceship buried in the glacial ice pack.[tpl]cite book |title= Man of Steel: The Official Movie Novelization |last= Cox |first= Greg |authorlink= Greg Cox (writer) |year= 2013 |publisher= Titan Books |location= London |isbn= 978-1-78116-599-7 |pages= 92, 95, 96–114 |url= http://titanbooks.com/man-of-steel-the-official-movie-novelization-6856/ |accessdate=2012-11-29[/tpl]
