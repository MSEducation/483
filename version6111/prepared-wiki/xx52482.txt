A Hard Day's Night is a 1964 British black-and-white comedy film directed by Richard Lester and starring the Beatles—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr—during the height of Beatlemania. It was written by Alun Owen and originally released by United Artists. The film portrays a couple of days in the lives of the group. The film is considered to be one of the best and most influential musical films of all time. 
It was successful both financially and critically; it was rated by Time magazine as one of the all-time great 100 films.[tpl]cite news|first=Richard |last=Corliss|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1953094_1953144_1953634,00.html |title=ALL-TIME 100 MOVIES  |work=Time |date=12 February 2005|accessdate=7 July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100715183532/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1953094_1953144_1953634,00.html| archivedate= 15 July 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] British critic Leslie Halliwell described it as a "comic fantasia with music; an enormous commercial success with the director trying every cinematic gag in the book" and awarded it a full four stars.[tpl]Cite book| last = Halliwell | first = Leslie | title = Halliwell's Film & Video Guide | year = 1997 | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn = 0-00-638779-9[/tpl] The film is credited as being one of the most influential musical films of all time, inspiring numerous spy films, the Monkees' television show and pop music videos.

==Plot==

Halliwell encapsulates the plot as "harassed by their manager and Paul's grandfather, the Beatles embark from Liverpool by train for a London TV show."
Having escaped a horde of fans, once aboard the train and trying to relax, various interruptions begin to test their patience, after a dalliance with a female passenger, Paul's grandfather is confined to the goods van and the 4 boys join him there to keep him company. Paul, Ringo, George and John play a card game and sing to a schoolgirl before arriving at their destination. 
On arrival in London, the Beatles are driven to a hotel where they feel trapped. After a night out during which Paul's grandfather causes minor trouble at a casino, the group is taken to the theatre where their performance is to be filmed. The preparations are lengthy so Ringo decides to spend some time alone reading a book. Paul's grandfather, a "villain, a real mixer," convinces him that he should be outside experiencing life instead of reading books, so Ringo goes off by himself. He tries to have a quiet drink in a pub, walks alongside a canal and at one point rides a bicycle along a railway station platform.This scene was filmed at Crowcombe Heathfield Station on the West Somerset Railway [tpl]cite web| url = http://www.west-somerset-railway.co.uk/Crowcombe_Heathfield.html | title = Crowcombe Heathfield | accessdate =3 April 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080513171103/http://www.west-somerset-railway.co.uk/Crowcombe_Heathfield.html| archivedate= 13 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Meanwhile, the rest of the band frantically (and unsuccessfully) attempts to find Ringo. Finally, however, he returns, after being arrested by the police along with Paul's grandfather, and the concert goes ahead as planned.[tpl]cite web|url=http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~ms538596/ahdn.html |title=A Hard Day's Night Film Summary and comments from The Beatles |accessdate=27 February 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080308032657/http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~ms538596/ahdn.html| archivedate= 8 March 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Screenplay==

The screenplay was written by Alun Owen, who was chosen because the Beatles were familiar with his play No Trams to Lime Street, and he had shown an aptitude for Liverpudlian dialogue. McCartney commented, "Alun hung around with us and was careful to try and put words in our mouths that he might've heard us speak, so I thought he did a very good script." Owen spent several days with the group, who told him their lives were like "a train and a room and a car and a room and a room and a room"; the character of Paul's grandfather refers to this in the dialogue.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aellea.com/script/ahdn.htm |title=A Hard Day's Night Script |publisher=aella |accessdate=27 February 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080212052752/http://www.aellea.com/script/ahdn.htm| archivedate= 12 February 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Owen wrote the script from the viewpoint that the Beatles had become prisoners of their own fame, their schedule of performances and studio work having become punishing. The screenplay was nominated for an Oscar.
The script comments cheekily on the Beatles' fame. For instance, at one point a fan, played by Anna Quayle, apparently recognises John Lennon, though she does not actually mention Lennon's name, saying only "you are...". He demurs, saying his face is not quite right for "him", initiating a surreal dialogue ending with the fan agreeing that Lennon doesn't "look like him at all" and Lennon saying to himself that "she looks more like him than I do". Other dialogue is derived from actual interviews with the Beatles. When Ringo is asked if he's a Mod or a Rocker, he replies "Uh, no, I'm a mocker",[tpl]cite web|first=Chris |last=Wiegand |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/cinema/features/hard-days-night.shtml |title=Film and Drama: A Hard Day's Night |work=BBC Four Cinema |date=12 December 2005|accessdate=27 February 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080307040255/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/cinema/features/hard-days-night.shtml| archivedate= 7 March 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]  a line derived from a joke he made on the TV show Ready Steady Go!.Tony Barrow, John, Paul, George, Ringo & Me: The Real Beatles Story, Da Capo Press, 2006, p.61.John C.

The frequent reference to McCartney's grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell) as a "clean old man" sets up a contrast with the stock description of Brambell's character, Albert Steptoe in Steptoe and Son as a "dirty old man".[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/steptoe.htm | title = Television Heaven : Steptoe and Son | accessdate =4 April 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080422222828/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/steptoe.htm| archivedate= 22 April 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]  Despite the fact that the original working titles of the film were first "The Beatles" and then "Beatlemania," the name of the group is never spoken in the movie[tpl]cite web|last=Frebowitz|first=Jerry|title=A Hard Day’s Night: Ten Things To Know About The Movie|url=http://www.moviefanfare.com/talkin-the-oldies/a-hard-days-night-ten-things-to-know-about-the-movie/|work=Talkin' the Oldies|publisher=MovieFanFare|accessdate=9 September 2012[/tpl]—it is, however, visible on Ringo's drumkit, on the stage lighting, and on the helicopter in the final scene. The television performance scene also contains a visual pun on the group's name, with photos of "beetles" visible on the wall behind the dancers.

==Production==

The film was shot for United Artists (UA) using a cinéma vérité style in black-and-white and produced over a period of sixteen weeks. It had a low budget for its time of £200,000 ($500,000) and filming was finished in under seven weeks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:21522 |title=Plot Synopsis |work=allmovie |accessdate=27 February 2008[/tpl]  At first, the film itself was something of a secondary consideration to UA, whose primary interest was in being able to release the soundtrack album in the United States before Capitol Records (the American EMI affiliate who had first shot at releasing Beatles music in the States) got around to issuing their material in the US; in the words of Bud Ornstein, the European head of production for United Artists: "Our record division wants to get the soundtrack album to distribute in the States, and what we lose on the film we'll get back on this disc."  As film historian Stephen Glynn put it, A Hard Day's Night was intended as, "a low-budget exploitation movie to milk the latest brief musical craze for all it was worth."[tpl]cite book|last=Glynn|first=Stephen|title=A Hard Day's Night: The British Film Guide 10|year=2005|publisher=I.B.Tauris|location=London|isbn=1-85043-587-1|pages=9|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R4T3G48fcGYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] 
Unlike most productions, it was filmed in near sequential order, as stated by Lennon in 1964.The Beatles, The Beatles Anthology (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, LCC, 2000, ISBN 0-8118-2684-8), p. 267  Filming began on 2 March 1964 at Marylebone station in London (although the station used is often wrongly quoted as being Paddington).

From 23 to 30 March, filming moved to the Scala Theatre,[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Scala.htm | title = Scala Theatre, 58 Charlotte Street| accessdate =3 April 2008[/tpl] and on 31 March, concert footage was shot there, although the group mimed to backing tracks. The
"Can't Buy Me Love" segment, which featured creative camera work and the band running and jumping around in a field was shot on 23 April 1964 at Thornbury Playing Fields, Isleworth, Middlesex. The final scene was filmed the following day in West Ealing, London, where Ringo obligingly drops his coat over puddles for a lady to step on, only to discover that the final puddle is actually a large hole in the road.Mark Lewisohn, The Complete Beatles Chronicle (London: Pyramid Books, Hamlyn, 1992, ISBN 0-600-61001-2), p. 158
Before A Hard Day’s Night was released in America, a United Artists executive asked Lester to dub the voices of the group with mid-Atlantic accents. McCartney angrily replied, “Look, if we can understand a fuckin' cowboy talking Texan, they can understand us talking Liverpool.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/beatles/beatlesbrowser-four3.shtml |title=Beatles Browser Four (p3) |first=Bill |last=Harry |work=Mersey Beat |accessdate=4 July 2009[/tpl] Lester subsequently directed The Beatles' 1965 film, Help!.

===Cast===

Irish actor Wilfrid Brambell, who played Paul McCartney's fictional grandfather John McCartney, was already well-known to British audiences as co-star of the British sitcom Steptoe and Son. The recurring joke that he was so clean is because in the sitcom he was always referred to as a dirty old man. Norman Rossington played the Beatles' manager Norm, John Junkin was their road manager Shake, and Victor Spinetti was the television director. Brian Epstein, their real manager, had an uncredited bit part.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alexfilmsociety.org/newsletters/HDN%20VOT%20V12.1.WEB.pdf |title=Voice of the Theatre – Journal of the Alex Film Society Vol.12, No1, 6 May 2006 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-17[/tpl]
The supporting cast included Richard Vernon as the "city gent" on the train and Lionel Blair as a featured dancer. Cameos included Kenneth Haigh as an advertising executive who mistakes George for a "new phenomenon," David Langton, John Bluthal as a car thief and an uncredited Derek Nimmo as magician Leslie Jackson. David Janson played the small boy met by Ringo on his "walkabout". Rooney Massara, who went on to compete in the 1972 Munich Olympics, was the sculler in the river in the "walkabout" scene by the river at Kew (uncredited).
Mal Evans, one of the Beatles' road managers, also appears briefly in the film—moving an upright bass through a tight hallway as Lennon talks with the woman who mistakes him for someone else.
George Harrison met his wife-to-be, Patricia Boyd, on the set when she made a brief (uncredited) appearance as one of the schoolgirls on the train. His initial overtures to her were spurned because she had a boyfriend at the time but he persisted and they were married within 18 months.[tpl]cite news|first=Bosley |last=Crowther|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/21522/A-Hard-Day-s-Night/overview |title=A Hard Day's Night (1964)|work=New York Times |date=19 February 2007|accessdate=27 February 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080307051108/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/21522/A-Hard-Day-s-Night/overview| archivedate= 7 March 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The girl with Boyd in the dining car scene is Prudence Bury.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ouest-france.fr/actu/actuDet_-Dans-les-sixties-j-ai-swingue-avec-les-Beatles-_3639-526403_actu.Htm |title=Prudence Bury |language=[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] |publisher=Ouest-france.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-01-17[/tpl] Phil Collins appeared, uncredited as a boy in the concert audience, and would go on to become a very successful musician himself.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058182/fullcredits#cast |title=A Hard Day's Night (1964) – Full cast and crew |publisher=www.imdb.com |accessdate=2 September 2010 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100929125708/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058182/fullcredits| archivedate= 29 September 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther noted the film was a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves. The Beatles are portrayed as likeable young lads who are constantly amazed at the attention they receive and who want nothing more than a little peace and quiet; however, they have to deal with screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review&OQ=_rQ3D2Q26resQ3D990DE7DE1E30E033A25751C1A96E9C946591D6CFQ26orefQ3Dslogin&OP=6a936722Q2FQ25o3Q7BQ25Q2A.Z3DlhQ25KZQ51D__Q2AnQ25_42Z3KZ3lQ25h2Q7E.3Q2AQ2543Q7E.3o(_Q22_Q25h2Q7E.3Q2543Q7E.3o  | title = A Hard Day's Night | accessdate =4 April 2008 | work=The New York Times | first=Bosley | last=Crowther | date=12 August 1964[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] (requires free login)  In fact their biggest problem is McCartney's elderly, but "clean" grandfather, played by Wilfrid Brambell.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.aellea.com/script/ahdn.htm | title = A Hard Day's Night | accessdate =3 April 2008|quote=This is a running gag, in which various characters describe him as "clean".| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080402132306/http://www.aellea.com/script/ahdn.htm| archivedate= 2 April 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]  The New Yorker critic Brendan Gill wrote: "Though I don't pretend to understand what makes these four rather odd-looking boys so fascinating to so many scores of millions of people, I admit that I feel a certain mindless joy stealing over me as they caper about uttering sounds."[tpl]cite journal|last=Gill|first=Brendan|title="A Hard Day''s Night" – review|journal=New Yorker|date=22 August 1964[/tpl]
A Hard Day's Night was nominated for two Academy Awards: for Best Screenplay (Alun Owen), and Best Score (Adaptation) (George Martin).
By 1971 the film was estimated to have earned $11 million worldwide.

==Influence==

British critic Leslie Halliwell states the film's influence as "... it led directly to all the kaleidoscopic swinging London spy thrillers and comedies of the later sixties..." In particular, the visuals and storyline are credited with inspiring The Monkees' television series.[tpl]Cite book| last = Massingill | first = Randy | year = 2005 | publisher=FLEXQuarters | location = Las Vegas, NV | title = Total Control: The Monkees Michael Nesmith Story | isbn = 0-9658218-4-6[/tpl]
The "Can't Buy Me Love" segment borrowed stylistically from Richard Lester's earlier The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film and it is this segment, in particular using the contemporary technique of cutting the images to the beat of the music, which has been cited as a precursor of modern music videos.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/hard08.shtml | title = Beatles film 'A Hard Day's Night' still makes you feel all right | accessdate =3 April 2008 | deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url = http://www.musicvideomistakes.net/pages/history_page.htm | title = History of Music Video Mistakes | accessdate =3 April 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080224081725/http://musicvideomistakes.net/pages/history_page.htm| archivedate= 24 February 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url = http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A82541 | title = Blow Up Your Video | accessdate =3 April 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url = http://www.filmsite.org/premiere.html | title = 100 Most Daring Movies Ever Made | accessdate =3 April 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080411042146/http://www.filmsite.org/premiere.html| archivedate= 11 April 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Roger Ebert goes even further, crediting Lester for a more pervasive influence, even constructing "a new grammar": "he influenced many other films. Today when we watch TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we are looking at the children of A Hard Day's Night".

==Title==

The movie's strange title originated from something said by Ringo Starr, who described it this way in an interview with disc jockey Dave Hull in 1964: "We went to do a job, and we'd worked all day and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, 'It's been a hard day...' and I looked around and saw it was dark so I said, '...night!' So we came to A Hard Day's Night."[tpl]Cite book| first = Keith |last=Badman | title = The Beatles Off The Record | publisher=Music Sales Corporation | isbn = 978-0-7119-7985-7 | page = 93[/tpl]
According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with Playboy magazine: "I was going home in the car, and Dick Lester suggested the title, 'Hard Day's Night' from something Ringo had said. I had used it in In His Own Write, but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. You know, one of those malapropisms. A Ringo-ism, where he said it not to be funny... just said it. So Dick Lester said, 'We are going to use that title.'"cited in [tpl]Cite book| last = Dowlding | first = William J. | title = Beatlesongs | year = 1989 | isbn = 978-0-671-68229-3 | unused_data = |publisher=Fireside[/tpl]
In a 1994 interview for The Beatles Anthology, however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon's recollections, recalling that it was the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come up with the idea of using Starr's verbal misstep: "The title was Ringo's. We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical... they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong. And he said after a concert, 'Phew, it's been a hard day's night.'"[tpl]Cite book|first=Barry |last=Miles |authorlink=Barry Miles |title=Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now |year=1997 |page=164 |publisher=Henry Holt & Company |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-5249-6[/tpl]
Yet another version of events appeared in 1996; producer Walter Shenson said that Lennon had described to him some of Starr's funnier gaffes, including "a hard day's night", whereupon Shenson immediately decided that that was going to be the title of the film.[tpl]cite web|first=Mary |last=Campbell |url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/daily/07-96/07-01-96/c02ae072.htm |title=Restored 'Hard Day's Night,' 'Help!' part of AMC festival |work=South Coast Today |date=1 July 1996 | accessdate =4 April 2008[/tpl]
Regardless of which of these origin stories is the true one, the original tentative title for the film had been "Beatlemania" and when the new title was agreed upon, it became necessary to write and quickly record a new title song, which was completed on 16 April, just eight days before filming was finished.[tpl]cite web|last=Rybaczewski|first=Dave|title="A Hard Day's Night" Soundtrack History|url=http://www.beatlesebooks.com/hard-days-night-soundtrack|work=Beatles Music History|publisher=DKR Products|accessdate=9 September 2012[/tpl]  John Lennon wrote the song in one night, basing the lyrics on a birthday card sent to his young son Julian,[tpl]cite web|title=A Hard Day's Night|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/albums/a-hard-days-night/|publisher=The Beatles Bible|accessdate=9 September 2012[/tpl] and it went on to win a Grammy for Best Performance by a Vocal Group.[tpl]rp|p.xii[/tpl]

==Novelisation==

In 1964, Pan Books published a novelisation of the film by author John Burke, described as "based on the original screenplay by Alun Owen". The book was priced at two shillings and sixpence and contained an 8-page section of photographs from the movie. It is the first book in the English language to have the word 'grotty' in it.

==Songs==

The film's credits state that all songs are composed by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. However, a portion of "Don't Bother Me" is heard in the film; this song is, in fact, a George Harrison composition, and is identified as such on all album appearances.
