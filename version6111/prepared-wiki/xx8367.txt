</ref> When analyzed through the ''Nez Perce Language Dictionary,'' the term ''cúpnitpelu'' contains no reference to "Piercing with a pointed object," as described by D.E. Walker.  The prefix ''cú''- means "in single file." This prefix, combined with the verb ''-piní'', "to come out (e.g. of forest, bushes, ice)". Finally, with the suffix of ''-pelú'', meaning "people or inhabitants of".

Nez Perce is a misnomer given by the interpreter of the Lewis and Clark Expedition at the time they first encountered the Nez Perce in 1805.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] It was a French term meaning "pierced nose." This is an inaccurate description of the tribe. They did not practice nose piercing or wearing ornaments. The "pierced nose" tribe lived on and around the lower Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest and are commonly called the Chinook tribe by historians and anthropologists. The Chinook relied heavily upon salmon, as did the Nez Perce. The peoples shared fishing and trading sites but the Chinook were much more hierarchical in their social arrangements.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Traditional lands and culture==

The Nez Perce territory at the time of Lewis and Clark (1804-1806) was approximately [tpl]convert|17000000|acre|km2[/tpl]. It covered parts of present-day Washington, Oregon, Montana, and Idaho, in an area surrounding the Snake, Salmon and the Clearwater rivers. The tribal area extended from the Bitterroots in the east to the Blue Mountains in the west between latitudes 45°N and 47°N.
In 1800, the Nez Perce had more than 100 permanent villages, ranging from 50 to 600 individuals, depending on the season and social grouping. Archeologists have identified a total of about 300 related sites, mostly in the Salmon River Canyon, including both camps and villages. In 1805 the Nez Perce were the largest tribe on the Columbia River Plateau, with a population of about 12,000. By the beginning of the 20th century, the Nez Perce had declined to about 1,900 because of epidemics, conflicts with non-Indians, and other factors. A total of 3499 Nez Perce were counted in the 2010 Census.
Similar to many western Native American tribes, the Nez Perce were migratory and would travel in seasonal rounds, according to where the abundant food was to be found at a given time of year. This migration followed a predictable pattern from permanent winter villages through several temporary camps, nearly always returning to the same locations each year. They were known to go as far east as the Great Plains of Montana to hunt buffalo, and as far west as the west coast. Before construction of The Dalles Dam in 1957, which flooded this area, Celilo Falls was a respected and favored location to fish for salmon on the Columbia River. They relied heavily on q'emes or camas root as a food source; it was gathered in the region between the Salmon and Clearwater river drainages. 
The Nez Perce believed in spirits called weyekins (Wie-a-kins) which would, they thought, offer "a link to the invisible world of spiritual power".[tpl]Cite book|title=Lewis & Clark and the Indian Country: the Native American Perspective|year=2007|first1=Frederick E.|last1=Hoxie|first2=Jay T.|last2=Nelson|pages=66–67|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana, Illinois|isbn=0252074858|oclc=132681406[/tpl] The weyekin would protect one from harm and become a personal guardian spirit. To receive a weyekin, both girls or boys, aged 12 to 15, would go to the mountains alone on a vision quest. The person on quest would take a brew of dry peyote or other sacred plants, which the people believed held spiritual power. They did not eat and drank very little water. While on the quest, the individual would receive a vision of a spirit, which would take the form of a mammal or bird. This vision could appear physically or in a dream or trance. The weyekin was to bestow the animal's powers on its bearer—for example; a deer might give its bearer swiftness. A person's weyekin was very personal. It was rarely shared with anyone and was contemplated in private. The weyekin stayed with the person until death.
The Nez Perce National Historical Park, with headquarters in Spalding, Idaho, is managed overall by the National Park Service. The museum in Spalding includes a research center holding the park's historical archives and library collection. It is available for on-site use in the study and interpretation of Nez Perce history and culture.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Nez Perce National Historic Park|title= Research Center |url=http://www.nps.gov/nepe/historyculture/research-center.htm|accessdate=April 14, 2012[/tpl] The park includes 38 sites associated with the Nez Perce in the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington, many of which are managed by local and state agencies.

==History==

===European contact===

In 1805 William Clark was the first known Euro-American to meet any of the tribe.  While he, Meriwether Lewis and their men were crossing the Bitterroot Mountains, they ran low of food, and Clark took six hunters and hurried ahead to hunt. On September 20, 1805, near the western end of the Lolo Trail, he found a small camp at the edge of the camas-digging ground, which is now called Weippe Prairie. The explorers were favorably impressed by the Nez Perce whom they met. Preparing to make the remainder of their journey to the Pacific by boats on rivers, they entrusted the keeping of their horses until they returned to "2 brothers and one son of one of the Chiefs." One of these Indians was Walammottinin (meaning "Hair Bunched and tied," but more commonly known as Twisted Hair). He was the father of Chief Lawyer, who by 1877 was a prominent member of the "Treaty" faction of the tribe. The Nez Perce were generally, faithful to the trust; and the party recovered their horses without serious difficulty when they returned.Josephy, Alvin. "The Nez Perce Indians and the opening of the Northwest". Yale University Press, 1971.

===Flight of the Nez Perce===

Under pressure from the European Americans, in the late 19th century the Nez Perce split into two groups: one side accepted the coerced relocation to a reservation and the other refused to give up their fertile land in Idaho and Oregon. Those willing to go to a reservation made a treaty in 1877. The flight of the non-treaty Nez Perce began on June 15, 1877, with Chief Joseph, Looking Glass, White Bird, Ollokot, Lean Elk (Poker Joe) and Toohoolhoolzote leading 2,900 men, women and children in an attempt to reach a peaceful sanctuary. They intended to seek shelter with their allies the Crow but, upon the Crow's refusal to offer help, the Nez Perce tried to reach the camp in Canada of Lakota Chief Sitting Bull. He had migrated there after decisively defeating United States forces in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. 
The Nez Perce were pursued by over 2,000 soldiers of the U.S. Army on an epic flight to freedom of more than [tpl]convert|1170|mi|km|-1[/tpl] across four states and multiple mountain ranges. The 800 Nez Perce warriors defeated or held off the pursuing troops in 18 battles, skirmishes, and engagements. More than 300 US soldiers and 1,000 Nez Perce (including women and children) were killed in these conflicts.Josephy, Jr., Alvin M. The Nez Perce and the Opening of the Northwest. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1965, pp. 632–633.  
A majority of the surviving Nez Perce were finally forced to surrender on October 5, 1877, after the Battle of the Bear Paw Mountains in Montana, [tpl]convert|40|mi|km[/tpl] from the Canadian border. Chief Joseph surrendered to General Oliver O. Howard of the U.S. Cavalry.[tpl]cite web|publisher=US Forest Service|title=Letters and Quotations of the Nez Perce Flight |url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/npnht/learningcenter/?cid=fsbdev3_055704|accessdate=April 14, 2012[/tpl] During the surrender negotiations, Chief Joseph sent a message, usually described as a speech, to the US soldiers. It has become renowned as one of the greatest American speeches: "...Hear me, my chiefs, I am tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever."[tpl]cite web|publisher=Great Speeches|title=Chief Joseph Surrenders |url=http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/joseph.htm|accessdate=April 14, 2012[/tpl]

==Nez Perce horse breeding program==

In 1994 the Nez Perce tribe began a breeding program, based on crossbreeding the Appaloosa and a Central Asian breed called Akhal-Teke, to produce what they called the Nez Perce Horse.[tpl]cite web|title=Nez Perce horse culture resurrected through new breed|url=http://www.buffalogirlsproductions.com/idahonatives/nez/horse.html|publisher=Idaho Natives|accessdate=May 22, 2013[/tpl] They wanted to restore part of their traditional horse culture, where they had conducted selective breeding of their horses, long considered a marker of wealth and status, and trained their members in a high quality of horsemanship. Social disruption due to reservation life and assimilationist pressures by Americans and the government resulted in the destruction of their horse culture in the 19th century. The 20th-century breeding program was financed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Nez Perce tribe, and a nonprofit group called the First Nations Development Institute (based in Washington D.C.) It has promoted businesses in Native American country that reflect values and traditions of the peoples. The Nez Perce Horse breed is noted for its speed.

==Fishing==

Fishing is an important ceremonial, subsistence, and commercial activity for the Nez Perce tribe. Nez Perce fishers participate in tribal fisheries in the mainstream Columbia River between Bonneville and McNary dams. The Nez Perce also fish for spring and summer Chinook salmon and steelhead in the Snake River and its tributaries. The Nez Perce tribe runs the Nez Perce Tribal Hatchery on the Clearwater River, as well as several satellite hatchery programs.
Nez Perce people historically depended on fish for their food. Chinook salmon were eaten the most, but other species such as lampreys, whitefish, and chiselmouth.[tpl]cite book |last1=Landeen |first1=Dan |last2=Pinkham |first2=Allen |year=1999 |title=Salmon and His People: Fish & Fishing in Nez Perce Culture |location=Lewiston, Idaho |publisher=Confluence Press |page=1 |isbn=1881090329 |oclc=41433913[/tpl] Prior to contact with Europeans, the Nez Perce's traditional hunting and fishing areas spanned from the Cascade Range in the west to the Bitterroot Mountains in the east.Landeen (1999), Salmon and His People, p. 92

==Nez Perce Indian Reservation==

The current tribal lands consist of a reservation in north central Idaho at [tpl]Coord|46|18|N|116|24|W|scale:1000000|display=inline[/tpl], primarily in the Camas Prairie region south of the Clearwater River, in parts of four counties. In descending order of surface area, the counties are Nez Perce, Lewis, Idaho, and Clearwater. The total land area is about [tpl]convert|1195|sqmi|km2|-1[/tpl], and the reservation's population at the 2000 census was 17,959.[ref]
