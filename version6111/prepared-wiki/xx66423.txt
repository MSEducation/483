This is a list of cities of Malaysia. In Malaysia, there are populated areas which are granted city status by law (bandar raya). However, there are also highly urbanised and populated areas which does not have city status, but are sometimes colloquially also referred to as cities. City status is granted to a place within a local government area. Other populated areas which does not have city status are legally categorised as a municipality or town.

==Cities of Malaysia==

The following is a list of places in Malaysia in order by the date they were granted city status.

===Penang===

Penang became a city on 1 January 1957 by a royal charter granted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, becoming the first town in the Federation of Malaya to become a city (Singapore became a city in 1951). However, local government elections were abolished by the federal government in 1965, and the functions of the City Council were transferred to the Chief Minister of Penang in 1966. A Municipal Council for the whole of Penang island was set up in 1974-6.
Although the city status of Penang was never officially revoked, it is now questionable whether George Town exists as a corporate entity, let alone as a city. This is similar to the position of the former city of Rochester in England, the site of England's second-oldest cathedral, which had been a city from 1211 until 1998, when it was merged with a neighbouring borough. As the new council was not granted city status, and the city through oversight failed to appoint charter trustees to inherit the city charter, the city ceased to exist.
This view has been supported by both the state and federal governments, but is disagreed with by some local residents, who hold that as Penang's city status has never been revoked it remains a city to this day. As city status is a matter of law, the actual legal position will depend on an analysis of the City Council of Penang (Transfer of Functions) Order 1966 and the Local Government Act 1976.

===Subsequent cities===

Kuala Lumpur, Kuching, Kota Kinabalu, Shah Alam, Malacca City, Alor Setar and Miri's royal charters were from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, while Ipoh and Johor Bahru were granted by their respective state sultans. Malacca was declared a "historical city" prior to being granted city status in 2003.
Kuala Lumpur, the largest city, is the federal capital and a federal territory, but as of 2003, most government executive bodies are moving to the new administrative capital and federal territory of Putrajaya.

===Criteria===

Among the latest (2008) basic criteria for granting City status on a local government is that it has a minimum population of 500,000 and an annual income of not less than RM 100 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jkt.kpkt.gov.my/en/main.php?Content=vertsections&SubVertSectionID=65&VertSectionID=43&CurLocation=43&IID=&Page=1|title=Criteria Status for Local Authority|date=30 June 2011|publisher=Local Government Department|accessdate=24 April 2012[/tpl]

Kuala Lumpur is by far the largest urban area as well as the largest metropolitan area in Malaysia. Penang is the second largest city and urban area in Malaysia as well as second largest metropolitan in Malaysia while Johor Bahru is the third largest metropolitan in Malaysia.
