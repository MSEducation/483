==Works==

His book of poems, intriguingly titled A Poem to its Creator, was released in March 2009 by Hybun Publications International to high critical acclaim. "Okenyodo's poetic exploration can be described as eclectic as he uses poetry to make social comments, admonish and define poetry itself," a critic says of the collection. Another says: "Going through Okenyodo’s poetry, you are knocked into place."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.africanwriter.com/from-a-poem-to-its-creator-meeting-okenyodo/|title=From a Poem to its Creator… Meeting Okenyodo |last=Akunyili |first=Tochukwu  |date=19 June 2009 |website=africanwriter.com |accessdate=23 December 2013[/tpl]
