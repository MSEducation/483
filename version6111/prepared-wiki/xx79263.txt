The Quebec general election of 1973 was held on October 29, 1973 to elect members to National Assembly of Quebec, Canada.  The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Robert Bourassa, won re-election, defeating the Parti Québécois, led by René Lévesque, and the Union Nationale (UN).
The Liberals won a large majority of the seats (102 out of 110).  The Union Nationale, which had held power up until the previous 1970 general election, was wiped off the electoral map, winning no seats.  However, UN candidate Maurice Bellemare later won a seat in a 1974 by-election. The Parti Québécois held its own, dropping only one seat (from seven to six), and despite having fewer seats, became the official Opposition, although PQ leader René Lévesque failed to win a seat in the Assembly.
The popular vote was not as lopsided as the distribution of seats would indicate.  The Parti Québécois, for instance, won 30% of the popular vote, a significant improvement over their previous showing of 23% in the 1970 election.
