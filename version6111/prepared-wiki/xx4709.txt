The name of Iran (ایران) is the Modern Persian derivative from the Proto-Iranian term Aryānā, meaning "Land of the Aryans", first attested in Zoroastrianism's Avesta tradition.[tpl]cite web|author=V.Jayaram |url=http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/concepts/arya.asp |title=The Concepts of Hinduism – Arya |publisher=Hinduwebsite.com |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=18 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20060221034145/http://imp.lss.wisc.edu/~aoliai/languagepage/iranianlanguages.htm |title=Iranian Languages |pages=26–7 |publisher=LSS.wis.edu |date=2006-02-21 |accessdate=2013-06-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/persianempiremaps/qt/Iran.htm |title="Iran – The Ancient Name of Iran", N.S.

Historically Iran has been referred to as "Persia" or similar (La Perse, Persien, Perzië, etc.) by the Western world, mainly due to the writings of Greek historians who called Iran Persis (Περσίς), meaning land of the Persians. In 1935 Rezā Shāh requested that the international community refer to the country as Iran. Opposition to the name change led to the reversal of the decision, and in 1959 both names were to be used interchangeably.[tpl]cite web| title = Renaming Persia| work = persiansarenotarabs.com | year = 2007| url = http://www.persiansarenotarabs.com/renaming-persia/ | accessdate =26 April 2011[/tpl] Today both "Persia" and "Iran" are used interchangeably in cultural contexts; however, "Iran" is the name used officially in political contexts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.art-arena.com/history.html |title=Persia or Iran, a brief history |publisher=Art-arena.com |accessdate=2013-06-21[/tpl]

From the late 10th to late 7th centuries BCE, these Iranian peoples, together with the pre Iranian kingdoms, fell under the domination of the Assyrian Empire, based in northern Mesopotamia.Georges Roux – Ancient Iraq Under king Cyaxares, the Medes and Persians entered into an alliance with Nabopolassar of Babylon, as well as the Scythians, Cimmerians, and Arameans, and together they attacked the Assyrian Empire. The civil war ravaged Assyrian Empire between 616 BCE and 605 BCE, thus freeing their respective peoples from three centuries of Assyrian rule.
The unification of the Median tribes under a single ruler in 728 BCE led to the creation of a Median empire which, by 612 BCE, controlled the whole of Iran as well as eastern Anatolia.[tpl]cite web| title = Median Empire| publisher = Iran Chamber Society| year = 2001| url = http://www.iranchamber.com/history/median/median.php| accessdate =29 April 2011[/tpl]
In 550 BCE, Cyrus the Great from the state of Anshan took over the Median empire, and founded the Achaemenid empire by unifying other city states. The conquest of Media was a result of what is called the Persian revolt; the brouhaha was initially triggered by the actions of the Median ruler Astyages and quickly spread to other provinces as they allied with the Persians. Later conquests under Cyrus and his successors expanded the empire to include Lydia, Babylon, Egypt, and the lands to the west of the Indus and Oxus rivers. At its greatest extent, the empire included the modern territories of Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt as far west as Libya, Turkey, Thrace and Macedonia, much of the Black Sea coastal regions, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, much of Central Asia, Afghanistan, northern Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and parts of Oman and the UAE, making it the first world empire.http://www.livius.org/maa-mam/maka/maka.htmlhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_translation_of_the_Behistun_Inscription[tpl]circular-ref|date=April 2013[/tpl] Conflict on the western borders began with the famous Greco-Persian Wars which continued through the first half of the 5th century BCE and ended with the Persian withdrawal from all of their European territories.[tpl]cite web| title = Greco-Persian Wars| work = Encyclopedia Britannica| url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/244117/Greco-Persian-Wars| accessdate =29 April 2011[/tpl] The empire had a centralised, bureaucratic administration under the Emperor and a large professional army and civil services, inspiring similar developments in later empires.[tpl]cite encyclopaedia|last=Schmitt|first=Rüdiger|title=Achaemenid dynasty|url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v1f4/v1f4a109.html|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|volume=vol. 3|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl]
In 334 BCE, Alexander the Great invaded the Achaemenid Empire, defeating the last Achaemenid Emperor Darius III at the Battle of Issus in 333 BCE. Following the premature death of Alexander, Iran came under the control of Hellenistic Seleucid Empire. In the middle of the 2nd century BCE, the Parthian Empire rose to become the main power in Iran and continued as a feudal monarchy for nearly five centuries until 224 CE, when it was succeeded by the Sassanid Empire.[tpl]cite web| last = Jakobsson| first = Jens| title = Seleucid Empire| publisher = Iran Chamber Society| year = 2004| url = http://www.iranchamber.com/history/seleucids/seleucids.php| accessdate =29 April 2011[/tpl] The Sassanids established an empire roughly within the frontiers achieved by the Achaemenids, with the capital at Ctesiphon, and were alongside the Byzantines the two most dominant powers in the world for nearly four centuries.[tpl]cite web| title = Sassanid Empire| publisher = Iran Chamber Society| url = http://www.iranchamber.com/history/sassanids/sassanids.php| accessdate =29 April 2011[/tpl] Most of the period of the Parthian and Sassanid Empires were overshadowed by the Roman-Persian Wars, which raged on their western borders for over 700 years.

After the 10th century, Persian, alongside Arabic, was used for scientific, philosophical, historical, mathematical, musical, and medical works, as important Iranian writers such as Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Avicenna, Qotb al-Din Shirazi, Naser Khusraw and Biruni made contributions to Persian scientific writing.
The cultural revival that began in the Abbasid period led to a resurfacing of Iranian national identity, and so earlier attempts of Arabization never succeeded in Iran. The Iranian Shuubiyah movement became a catalyst for Iranians to regain their independence in their relations with the Arab invaders.[tpl]cite web|last=Bosworth|first=C.

Garthwaite|title=The Persians|date=2008-04-15|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-4051-4400-1[/tpl] Turkic tribesmen were first used in the Abbasid army as slave-warriors (Mamluks), replacing Persian and Arab elements within the army. As a result the Mamluks gained significant political power. In 999, Iran came under the rule of Ghaznavid dynasty, whose rulers were of Mamluk Turk origin, and later under the Turkish Seljuk and Khwarezmian Empires. These Turks had been Persianised and had adopted Persian models of administration and rulership. The result of the adoption and patronage of Persian culture by Turkish rulers was the development of a distinct Turko-Persian tradition.
In 1219–21 the Khwarezmian Empire suffered a devastating invasion by Genghis Khan's Mongol army. According to Steven R. Ward, "Mongol violence and depredations killed up to three-fourths of the population of the Iranian Plateau, possibly 10 to 15 million people. Some historians have estimated that Iran's population did not again reach its pre-Mongol levels until the mid-20th century."[tpl]cite book|author=Steven R.

===Dynasties (1501–1979)===

At the start of the 16th century, Shah Ismail I established the Safavid Dynasty in western Persia and Azerbaijan. He subsequently extended his authority over all of Persia, and established intermittent Persian hegemony over vast nearby regions wich would last for many centuries onwards. Ismail instigated a forced conversion from Sunni to Shi'a Islam.[tpl]cite web| title = Safavid Empire (1501–1722)| work = BBC Religion| publisher = BBC| date = 7 September 2009| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/safavidempire_1.shtml| accessdate =20 June 2011[/tpl] The rivalry between Safavid Persia and the Ottoman Empire led to several Ottoman–Persian Wars. The Safavid era peaked in the reign of the brilliant soldier, statesman and administrator Shah Abbas I (1587–1629).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/empires/safavid/abbas.html |title=The Islamic World to 1600 |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |accessdate=2013-06-21[/tpl] Following a slow decline in the late 17th and early 18th centuries by internal strife, royal intrigues and foreign interference (most notably by the Russians) the Safavid dynasty was ended by Pashtun rebels who besieged Isfahan and defeated Soltan Hosein in 1722.
In 1729, an Iranian Khorasan chieftain and military genius, Nader Shah, successfully drove out, then conquered the Pashtun invaders. During Nader Shah's reign, Iran reached it's greatests extent since the Sassanian Empire, reestablishing Persian hegemony over all of the Caucasus, other major parts of West Asia, Central Asia and parts of South Asia. In 1738-9 he invaded India and sacked Delhi, looting great wealth back to Persia. Following a brief period of civil war and turmoil, sparked by Nader Shah's assassination, Karim Khan came to power in 1750, bringing a period of relative peace and prosperity. Another civil war ensued after Karim Khan's death in 1779, out of which Aga Muhammad Khan emerged victorious, founding the Qajar Dynasty in 1794. In 1795, following the disobedience of their Georgian subjects and their alliance with the Russians, the Qajars sacked and ravaged Tblisi, and drove the Russians out of the entire Caucasus, reestablishing Persian suzerainity over the region. It indirectly sparked another series of Russo-Persian Wars led by subsequent Shah's and Tzar's, wich after the last one, Russia would eventually prevail. Apart from Agha Mohammad Khan, Qajar rule is characterised as a century of misrule. Around 1.5 million people, or 20–25% of Persia's population, died as a result of the Great Persian Famine of 1870–1871.[tpl]Cite book | last = Yeroushalmi | first = David | title = The Jews of Iran in the nineteenth century: aspects of history, community | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=XYlGS3s3zTQC&pg=PA327&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false | publisher = BRILL | year = 2009 | page = 327 | isbn = 90-04-15288-1[/tpl]
Whilst resisting efforts to be colonised, Iran suffered in the 19th century as a result of Russian and British empire-building, known as 'The Great Game', losing much of its territory in the Russo-Persian and the Anglo-Persian Wars. A series of protests took place in response to the sale of concessions to foreigners by Nasser al-Din Shah and Mozaffar ad-Din Shah between 1872 and 1905, the last of which resulted in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution and establishment of Iran's first national parliament (majles) in 1906, which was abolished in 1908. The struggle continued until 1911, when Mohammad Ali was defeated and forced to abdicate. On the pretext of restoring order, the Russians occupied northern Iran in 1911. During World War I, the British occupied much of western Iran, not fully withdrawing until 1921.
In 1921 Reza Khan, Prime Minister of Iran and former general of the Persian Cossack Brigade, overthrew the Qajar Dynasty and became Shah. In 1941 he was forced to abdicate in favour of his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, after Iran came under British and Russian occupation following the Anglo-Soviet invasion that established the Persian Corridor and would last until 1946.
In 1951 Mohammad Mosaddegh was elected prime minister. He became enormously popular in Iran after he nationalized Iran's petroleum industry and oil reserves. He was deposed in the 1953 Iranian coup d'état, an Anglo-American covert operation that marked the first time the US had overthrown a foreign government during the Cold War.[tpl]cite book|author=Stephen Kinzer|title=All the Shah's Men|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pNz-3o_GQwsC&pg=PT10|accessdate=2013-06-21|date=2011-06-01|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-14440-4|page=10[/tpl]
After the coup, the Shah became increasingly autocratic. Arbitrary arrests and torture by his secret police, SAVAK, were used to crush all forms of political opposition. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini became an active critic of the Shah's White Revolution and publicly denounced the government. Khomeini was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months. After his release in 1964, Khomeini publicly criticized the United States government. The Shah sent him into exile. He went first to Turkey, then to Iraq and finally to France. By the mid-1970s, there was growing unrest with the Shah's repressive regime.

He was in hospital in Texas at the time. Attempts by the Jimmy Carter administration to negotiate for their release or rescue them were unsuccessful. In January 1981 the hostages were finally set free according to the Algiers Accords.
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein decided to take advantage of the disorder in the wake of the Revolution by acquiring territories that Iraq had claimed earlier from Iran during the Shah's rule. On 22 September 1980 the Iraqi army invaded Iran at Khuzestan, precipitating the Iran–Iraq War. Although Saddam Hussein's forces made several early advances, by 1982 the Iranian forces successfully managed to drive the Iraqi army back into Iraq. Despite receiving large amounts of foreign financial and military aid (including chemical weapons), all of Saddam's subsequent offensives were thrown back.
In 1987, Iran tried to close the Persian Gulf to stop the flow of Iraqi, Kuwaiti and Saudi oil, as a way to strangle Iraq, with which it had been fighting a bloody war for almost seven years. On October 15 and 16, Iran attacked two Kuwaiti-owned but US flagged supertankers with Silkworm missiles.Black Monday (1987) American supertankers, the Sungari, and the MV Sea Isle City [tpl]better source|date=December 2013[/tpl]War With Iran Is Coming!

Following the Iran–Iraq War, President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his administration concentrated on a pragmatic pro-business policy of rebuilding and strengthening the economy without making any dramatic break with the ideology of the revolution.

==Geography==

Iran is the eighteenth largest country in the world, with an area of [tpl]convert|1648195|km2|mi2|abbr=on[/tpl]. Its area roughly equals that of the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Germany combined, or somewhat more than the US state of Alaska.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Asia-and-Oceania/Iran-LOCATION-SIZE-AND-EXTENT.html|title=Iran-Location, size, and extent|publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com|date=7 February 2011 |accessdate=18 June 2011[/tpl] Iran lies between latitudes 24° and 40° N, and longitudes 44° and 64° E.

Iran consists of the Iranian Plateau with the exception of the coasts of the Caspian Sea and Khuzestan Province. It is one of the world's most mountainous countries, its landscape dominated by rugged mountain ranges that separate various basins or plateaux from one another. The populous western part is the most mountainous, with ranges such as the Caucasus, Zagros and Alborz Mountains; the last contains Iran's highest point, Mount Damavand at [tpl]convert|5610|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl], which is also the highest mountain on the Eurasian landmass west of the Hindu Kush.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.surfwax.com/geography/files/Hindu_Kush_Mountains.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624014628/http://news.surfwax.com/geography/files/Hindu_Kush_Mountains.html|archivedate=2011-06-24|title=SurfWax: News, Reviews and Articles On Hindu Kush|publisher=News.surfwax.com| accessdate=18 June 2011[/tpl]
The northern part of Iran is covered by dense rain forests called Shomal or the Jungles of Iran. The eastern part consists mostly of desert basins such as the Dasht-e Kavir, Iran's largest desert, in the north-central portion of the country, and the Dasht-e Lut, in the east, as well as some salt lakes. This is because the mountain ranges are too high for rain clouds to reach these regions. The only large plains are found along the coast of the Caspian Sea and at the northern end of the Persian Gulf, where Iran borders the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab (or the Arvand Rūd) river. Smaller, discontinuous plains are found along the remaining coast of the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman.
