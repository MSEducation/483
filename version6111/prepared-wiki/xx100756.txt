Migros ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈmiɡro[/tpl]) is Switzerland's largest retail company, its largest supermarket chain and largest employer. It is also one of the forty largest retailers in the world. It co-founded Turkey's largest retailer, Migros Türk, which became independent of Migros Switzerland in 1975.
The name comes from the French "mi" for half or mid-way and "gros", which means wholesale. Thus the word connotes prices that are halfway between retail and wholesale.
The logo of the company is a large orange M, which some Swiss newspapers call "the orange giant" (German: oranger Riese, French: géant orange). The firm's loyalty card is the M-cumulus card (a play on the word accumulate and a type of cloud formation).

==History==

Migros was founded in 1925 in Zürich as a private enterprise by Gottlieb Duttweiler, who had the idea of selling just six basic foodstuffs at low prices to householders who, in those days, did not have ready access to markets of any kind. At first he sold only coffee, rice, sugar, noodles, coconut oil and soap from trucks that went from one village or hamlet to another. The strategy to cut the intermediate trade and their margins led to broad resistance of his competitors who goaded the producers on boycotting him. As a reaction to this threat, Migros started creating its own line of goods beginning with meat, milk and chocolate. Later he and his drivers expanded their inventory and in 1926 Duttweiler built his first market, also in Zürich. His second store, in Ticino, presaged the future because it was founded as a cooperative. By 1941 the energetic entrepreneur had built a number of markets but in that year he basically gave the business to his customers by transforming everything from his privately owned enterprises into regional cooperatives, headed by the Federation of Migros Cooperatives (FCM, German: Migros-Genossenschafts-Bund, MGB, French: Fédération des coopératives Migros, FCM).
As early as 1935, Duttweiler showed his zest for expansion by founding the Hotelplan travel agency. Later the Migros brand was applied to a weekly magazine, Wir Brückenbauer (now known as Migros Magazin) in 1942. Other ventures were restaurants in 1952, gasoline stations (Migrol) in 1954, language schools (Eurocentres) in 1956, a bank (Migros Bank, Banque Migros) in  1957 and an insurance company, 1959.
Migros opened its first foreign supermarket in the frontier region of France, in Thoiry, in 1993, and its first recreation park, Säntispark, at Abtwil in St. Gallen, in 1986.
In 1954 Migros entered the Turkish market, forming Migros Türk in partnership with the Istanbul City Council. This was sold to Turkish group Koç Holding in 1975 and is the largest retailer in Turkey.
In October 2012, Migros entered the German market by acquiring the Hessian food store chain Tegut. In the same year, Migros opened the first Swiss store of German organic supermarket chain Alnatura.Migros begins major offensive in organic market. Fresh Plaza, 13 September 2013

==Migros today==

To this day, Migros keeps the cooperative society as its form of organization. Nowadays, a large part of the Swiss population are members of the Migros cooperative – around 2 million of Switzerland's total population of 7.2 million,Article by Thomas Hammer in German newspaper Die Zeit (in German)Article by Constantin Seibt in Swiss newspaper WOZ (in German) thus making Migros a supermarket chain that is owned by its customers. More than 90% of the assortment of goods is produced by ninety subsidiaries of Migros.  
Reflecting the altruism of its founder, Migros operates a number of evening schools for working adults, featuring classes in cooking, languages and other subjects. It has obligated itself to spend one percent of its annual turnover for financing cultural projects in a broad sense; the sub-organization taking care of this is called Migros KulturprozentOfficial site of Migros Kulturprozent (in German, French, and Italian) ("cultural percent"). In 2011, an amount of 117 Million Swiss Francs was paid to finance this purpose. An example of the Kulturprozent's activity is its own record label Musiques Suisses often featuring little-known works from Swiss music history.
The supermarkets are categorized in the three size classes of M, MM and MMM.
Migros acquired some notoriety in 1977 when it fired its severest internal critic, Hans A. Pestalozzi.

===M-Budget and Migros Sélection===

In 1996, influenced by the budget ranges in supermarket chains in Australia,Produits M-Budget: l'histoire d'un succès, on the Migros website. Retrieved 16 August 2007. Migros made their budget range called M-Budget with seventy products aimed at those with low incomes and large families. Now it has grown to 330 products including mountain bikes, snowboards, mp3 players, milk chocolate, jeans, shoes and lighters. M-Budget products have a standardized packaging colour scheme, consisting of a grass green background with the Migros logo in small white text repeated over it.
Many of these products are produced in limited quantities rather than as an integral, permanent part of the Migros line. Whether they become permanent depends on their success. This, combined with the considerable brand recognition that Migros enjoys, conveys a certain amount of desirability to the rarer products. As a result, M-Budget items will sometimes be considered collectibles, as it is not always sure that they will ever be produced again.
To promote the range, in the early 2000s (decade), Migros developed M-Budget Party with tickets costing 9.90 CHF including free non-alcoholic drinks (cola, lemonade and orange juice) and snacks (crisps, chocolate and cakes).
In 2005, together with Swisscom, Migros launched M-Budget Mobile, a pay-as-you-go mobile phone company.
Also in 2005, Migros introduced a premium line called Migros sélection, featuring for the most part food products typically associated with higher budgets and prepared in different fashions than is available through general stock. Sélection products also have their distinctive packaging, with pearl white and gold color schemes.
In April 2006, Migros announced the M-Budget credit card, an initiative between FCM, GE Money Bank and MasterCard, originally with an annual rate of CHF 4.40, which is low compared to credit card annual rates of CHF 100 for a MigrosBank MasterCard Argent credit card. The card was ready by the autumn 2006. After Coop, the biggest competitor of Migros, announced a credit card without any annual rate, Migros scrapped its annual charge. Migros later announced the full details of the credit card, it will have an APR of 9.9% and the ability to gain cumulus points (1 point per 2 francs).

==Ethic==

Migros sells neither alcoholic beverages nor cigarettes in its flagship supermarkets, but some retailers acquired by Migros continue selling these products; this includes Globus, Migrol and Denner stores, as well as their online shopping service LeShop.ch. In addition, Migros does not stock pornographic magazines of any level of explicitness.

===M-Industry===

A large part of the products sell in the Migros supermarkets are produced by its own companies (M-Industry), mostly in Switzerland.M-Industry (page visited on 24 February 2014). In 2013, M-Industry comprises 20 companies, 17 of which are in Switzerland, and produce more than 20'000 products for the Migros supermarkets.

==Competitors==

The main competitor is Coop, Switzerland's second-largest supermarket chain, a cooperative like Migros, but with a more centralized organization.Article "Coop (Schweiz)" in German Wikipedia Amongst the smaller competitors are the Manor department store chain, and more recently Aldi. Although Aldi is a very large international supermarket group, it entered the Swiss market only recently (Aldi opened its first Swiss shops in 2005) and thus operates just a few branches at the present time. However, it is expected that Aldi will become one of the major competitors of both Migros and Coop, as it managed to set established supermarket chains in other countries under heavy pressure through an aggressive discount strategy. A further competitor is Lidl which established its first Swiss supermarkets in March 2009.[tpl]cite news |title=Lidl eröffnet ersten Laden in der Schweiz |author=Torsten Riecke |newspaper=Handelsblatt |date=18 March 2009 |accessdate=30 September 2009 |url=http://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/handel-dienstleister/lidl-eroeffnet-ersten-laden-in-der-schweiz;2206714 |language=German |trans_title=Lidl opens first shop in Switzerland [/tpl]
In January 2007, Migros acquired a majority stake in Denner, effectively merging the largest and third largest food retail chains in Switzerland. According to both companies, the move was effected in order for the Denner chain to better compete with increasing foreign competition.Switzerland's largest retailer, Migros, has purchased a majority stake in the country's third largest food chain, Denner. from Swissinfo

==Criticism==

Some critics like Sorgim, a Swiss non-profit organization (its name is Migros backwards), claim that Migros has lost touch with its founder's ideals. They say that the cooperative is not governed democratically by its members as it was once envisioned by Gottlieb Duttweiler. It is argued that instead, through various amendments to the by-laws, it is now the executive board that decides over all major business matters and policies.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]
