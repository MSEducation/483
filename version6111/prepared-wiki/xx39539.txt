Agape ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|ɡ|ə|p|iː[/tpl]Oxford English Dictionary or [tpl]IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|p|eɪ[/tpl]; Classical Greek: [tpl]lang|grc|ἀγάπη[/tpl], agápē; Modern Greek: [tpl]lang|el|αγάπη[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-el|aˈɣapi|IPA[/tpl]), often translated "unconditional love", is one of the Koine Greek words translated into English as love, one which became particularly appropriated in Christian theology as the love of God or Christ for humankind. In the New Testament, it refers to the covenant love of God for humans, as well as the human reciprocal love for God; the term necessarily extends to the love of one’s fellow man.[ref]"agape."

[/ref] Although the word does not have specific religious connotation, the word has been used by a variety of contemporary and ancient sources, including biblical authors and Christian authors. Greek philosophers at the time of Plato and other ancient authors have used forms of the word to denote love of a spouse or family, or affection for a particular activity, in contrast to philia (an affection that could denote friendship, brotherhood or generally non-sexual affection) and eros, an affection of a sexual nature. Thomas Jay Oord has defined agape as "an intentional response to promote well-being when responding to that which has generated ill-being."[ref]“ The love racket: Defining love and agape for the love-and-science research program,” Zygon, vol. 40, no. 4 (December 2005), pp. 919-938 Defining Love (PDF)

A journalist of Time Magazine has described John 3:16 as "one of the most famous and well-known Bible verses. It has been called the 'Gospel in a nutshell' because it is considered a summary of the central doctrines of Christianity."John 3:16 in Pop Culture. Time.com  Accessed: 22 May 2009 The verb translated "loved" in this verse is ἠγάπησεν (ēgapēsen), past tense of "agapaō".
Agape received a broader usage under later Christian writers as the word that specifically denoted "Christian" love or "charity" ([tpl]bibleverse|1|Corinthians|13:1–8|KJV[/tpl]), or even God himself ([tpl]bibleverse|1|John|4:8|KJV[/tpl], ὁ θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν, "God is Love").
The term agape is rarely used in ancient manuscripts, but was used by the early Christians to refer to the self-sacrificing love of God for humanity, which they were committed to reciprocating and practicing towards God and among one another (also see kenosis). When [tpl]Bibleref2|1john|4:8|9|1 John 4:8[/tpl] says "God is love," the Greek New Testament uses the word agape to describe God's love.
Agape has been expounded on by many Christian writers in a specifically Christian context. C. S. Lewis, in his book The Four Loves, used agape to describe what he believed was the highest level of love known to humanity – a selfless love, a love that was passionately committed to the well-being of the other.[ref]Kreeft, Peter. "Love" Accessed: May 22, 2009
The Christian usage of the term agape comes almost directly from the canonical Gospels' accounts of the teachings of Jesus. When asked what was the great commandment, "Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." ([tpl]bibleverse||Matthew|22:37-40|KJV[/tpl]) In Judaism, the first ("...love the [tpl]LORD[/tpl] thy God..."), is part of the Shema. 
In the King James Version of the New Testament, the word agape is translated "charity" some places which has a contemporary connotation of giving to meet needs of the less fortunate.
In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said:
Tertullian, in his 2nd century defense of Christians, remarks how Christian love attracted pagan notice: "What marks us in the eyes of our enemies is our loving kindness. 'Only look,' they say, 'look how they love one another' " (Apology 39).
Anglican theologian O.C. Quick cautions however that this agape within human experience is "a very partial and rudimentary realization," and that "in its pure form it is essentially divine." Quick suggests that,
In the New Testament the word agape is often used to describe God's love. However, other forms of the word agape (such as agapaō) are at times used in a negative sense. Such examples include:

===Meal===

The word agape in its plural form is used in the New Testament to describe a meal or feast eaten by early Christians, as in Jude [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Jude|1:12|KJV[/tpl], and 2nd Peter [tpl]bibleverse-nb|2|Peter|2:13|KJV[/tpl].
