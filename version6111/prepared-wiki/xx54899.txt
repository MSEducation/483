Lancia Automobiles S.p.A. ([tpl]IPA-it|ˈlantʃa[/tpl]) is an Italian automobile manufacturer founded in 1906 by Vincenzo Lancia which became part of the Fiat Group in 1969.
The company has a strong rally heritage and is noted for using letters of the Greek alphabet for its model names.

==History==

===Foundation and early years===

Lancia was founded on 29 November 1906 in Turin by Vincenzo Lancia and his friend Claudio Fogolin, both being Fiat racing drivers, as Lancia & C. The first Lancia automobile the "tipo 51" or 12 HP (later called Alfa) was made in 1907 and produced from 1908. This car had a small four cylinder engine with a power of 58 bhp.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.classicargarage.com/english/garages/history/lancia-histo.htm|title=Lancia history|accessdate=2008-05-01|author=Marc Vorgers|work=classicargarage.com[/tpl] In 1915 the Jota, Lancia's first truck, appeared and there followed a series of Jota trucks. In 1937 Vincenzo died of a heart attack, and his wife Adele Miglietti Lancia and his son Gianni Lancia took over the firm. They persuaded Vittorio Jano to join Lancia as an engineer. Jano had already made a name for himself by constructing the Alfa Romeo 1750 Sport Alfa Romeo 6C, 2300, 2900, P2 Alfa Romeo P2 and P3 Alfa Romeo P3, some of the most successful racers of its time.
Lancia is famous for many automotive innovations. These include the 1913 Theta, which was the first production car in Europe to feature a complete electrical system as standard equipment.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.lancia.com/#/history-and-design/history/innovation/|title=Innovation The First Models|accessdate=2012-06-09|work=lancia.com[/tpl] The first car with a monocoque-type body – the Lambda, produced from 1922 to 1931 also featured 'Sliding Pillar' independent front suspension that incorporated the spring and hydraulic damper into a single unit (and featured on most production Lancias until the Appia was replaced in 1963). 1948 saw the first 5 speed gearbox to be fitted to a production car (Series 3 Ardea). Lancia premiered the first full-production V6 engine, in the 1950 Aurelia,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www./Lancia/02_LanciaCC.htm|title=Lancia Coupés & Convertibles: the Aurelia B20 Gran Turismo|accessdate=2007-06-21|work=ritzsite.net[/tpl] after earlier industry-leading experiments with V8 and V12 engine configurations. It was also the first company to produce a V4 engine. Also, Lancia pioneered the use of independent suspension in production cars, in an era where live axles were common practice for both the front and rear axles of a car.  They also developed rear transaxles which were fitted to the Aurelia and Flaminia ranges. The innovativeness, constant quest for excellence, the fixation of quality, the complication of the construction processes and the antiqued machinery meant that all cars essentially had to be hand-made. With little commonality between the various models, the cost of production continued to increase extensively, while demand did not.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Gianni Lancia, a graduate engineer was president of Lancia from 1947 to 1955. In 1956 the Pesenti family took over control of Lancia with Carlo Pesenti (1907–1984) in charge.

===1969 to present===

Fiat launched a take-over bid in October 1969 which was accepted by Lancia as the company was losing significant sums of money, with losses in 1969 being [tpl]GBP[/tpl]20m.[tpl]cite news|title=Lancia loss was £20m|accessdate=20 February 2013|newspaper=The Times|date=30 April 1970|pages=24[/tpl]  This was not the end of the distinctive Lancia marque, and new models in the 1970s such as the Stratos, Gamma and Beta served to prove that Fiat wished to preserve the image of the brand it had acquired.
During the 1980s, the company cooperated with Saab Automobile, with the Lancia Delta being sold as the Saab 600 in Sweden. The 1985 Lancia Thema also shared a platform with the Saab 9000, Fiat Croma and the Alfa Romeo 164. During the 1990s, all models were closely related to other Fiat models.
In 2011, Lancia moved in a new direction and added new models manufactured by Chrysler and sold under the Lancia badge in many European markets. Conversely, some Lancia built models began to be sold in right-hand drive markets under the Chrysler badge.

===Logo===

The original Lancia logo was designed by Count Carlo Biscaretti di Ruffia. The logo shows a lance and shield with flag.   ("Lancia" means "lance" in Italian.)  The
Turin automobile museum is named after di Ruffia as Museo Nazionale dell'Automobile “Carlo Biscaretti di Ruffia”. The logo was redesigned in 2007.

===Past car models===

Lancia has a long tradition of passenger, fast touring, sports and racing cars. They have tended to emphasize quality, appearance and sophisticated design, somewhat at the expense of power and competitive pricing. Among the most beautiful, desirable and unusual models are various Lancia Zagato models.
The Lancia Aurelia introduced the front engine rear transmission configuration later used by Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Porsche, GM, and Maserati, as well as the V6 engine, which is now common. It also had inboard rear brakes, an important way of reducing un-sprung weight.
The Lancia Stratos was a successful rally car during the 1970s and helped the company to improve its sporting credentials.

===Concept cars===

Lancia has shown several concept cars to the public including the Flaminia Loratmo (1958), Stratos Zero (1970), the Megagamma by Italdesign Giugiaro and Sibilo by Bertone in 1978, Hit (1988) by Pininfarina, the Bertone Kayak (1995) and the Dialogos in 1998.

==Export markets==

January 2014, Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat, announced that Lancia won't export cars anymore, being Italy the only market where Lancia would be available.  

===United States===

While some models had been imported on a small scale in the 1950s and 1960s, Lancias were officially sold in the United States from 1975. Sales were comparatively slow and the range was withdrawn at the same time as Fiat in 1982.
In 2009, following Fiat's acquisition of a stake in United States-based Chrysler and part of Chrysler's restructuring plans, it was stated that Fiat plans for the Chrysler brand and Lancia to codevelop products, with some vehicles being shared. Olivier Francois, Lancia's CEO, took over as CEO of the Chrysler division in October 2009. Fiat has also stated that, depending on the market, some Chrysler cars will be sold as Lancias and vice versa. Francois plans to reestablish the Chrysler brand as an upscale brand, a position somewhat muddied after the Plymouth brand was discontinued.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/lancia-chrysler-to-share-products.html |title=Lancia, Chrysler to share products |publisher=Leftlanenews.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-29[/tpl] At the 2010 Detroit Auto Show, a Chrysler-badged Lancia Delta was on display,[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/car/10q1/chrysler_delta_concept-auto_shows|title=Chrysler Delta Concept - Auto Shows|author=Jared Gall|magazine=Car and Driver magazine|date=January 2010|accessdate=2010-01-11[/tpl] but this has not resulted in sales in the USA, with proposals to modify an Alfa Romeo being considered instead for sale by 2013.[tpl]cite web|title=Caught Testing: 2013 Chrysler 100 - Spy Shots|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/future-cars/spy-photos/caught-testing-2013-chrysler-100/|work=Road and Track|accessdate=27 July 2012|date=6 February 2012[/tpl]

===United Kingdom===

Lancia's reputation was significantly undermined in 1980, when defective Lancia Beta models, suffering from significant suspension sub-frame corrosion problems were purchased back from owners by the company in a highly publicised campaign. These cars were subsequently crushed.[tpl]cite news | first = Hugh | last = Hunston | title = Lancia buy back rust-hit Betas | date = 10 April 1980 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19800410&id=r8BAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2KUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5776,2238512 | work = The Glasgow Herald | accessdate = 26 August 2013[/tpl] The brand never recovered from the damage inflicted during the Beta recall, and combined with a range of related factors, including poor residual values which made their range uncompetitive, decided to withdraw from the RHD market.[tpl]cite news | first = Andrew | last = English | title = Chrysler Ypsilon review | date = 28 Jun 2011 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/car-manufacturers/chrysler/8582050/Chrysler-Ypsilon-review.html | work = The Daily Telegraph | accessdate = 26 August 2013[/tpl]
The last Lancia cars to be sold in the United Kingdom were the Y10, which went off sale in 1993, the Dedra and Thema followed in 1994, whilst the more popular Delta, boosted by its rallying reputation continued on-sale in the United Kingdom until 1995. There have been rumours suggesting Lancia's return to the United Kingdom almost continually, since 1995, these have always been credible; with Lancia models sharing common parts with Fiat and Alfa Romeo models, sold in the United Kingdom, and the existing Fiat or Alfa Romeo dealerships able to import, sell and maintain all Lancia models, there would be no major difficulty or expense in re-establishing the brand in the United Kingdom.
The success of Volkswagen's branding strategy with Audi, Škoda, SEAT and Volkswagen brands, covering different areas of the passenger car market, has been repeatedly asserted as a reason for Fiat, to consider introducing Lancia as a more luxurious brand, to compete with the "affordable" premium manufacturers, including SAAB and Volvo, who were the up market brands from General Motors and Ford, respectively.
Fiat cancelled Lancia's United Kingdom relaunch due to financial concerns in 2008, at the start of the global recession and the financial crisis.[tpl]cite web|title=Fiat cancels Lancia's UK return|url=http://www.whatcar.com/car-news/fiat-cancels-lancia-s-uk-return/236386/|work=What Car?|accessdate=27 July 2012|date=8 December 2008[/tpl] In 2011, Lancia Ypsilon and Delta models were eventually re–introduced to the United Kingdom, but were re–branded as Chrysler models. The Delta model was then dropped from Chrysler's line up in 2014.

===Japan===

A small number of Lancia models are sold in Japan. Models like the Lancia Fulvia, Lancia Delta, Lancia Stratos and the new models like the Lancia Delta, and the Lancia Ypsilon.

==Lancia in motorsport==

===Formula One===

After Vincenzo Lancia's son Gianni became director of the firm, it started to take part more frequently in motorsport, eventually deciding to build a Grand Prix car. Vittorio Jano was the new designer for Lancia and his Lancia D50 was entered into the 1954 Spanish Grand Prix, where Alberto Ascari took the pole position and drove the fastest lap. In the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix Ascari crashed into the harbour after missing a chicane. One week later Ascari was killed in an accident driving a Ferrari sports car at Monza. With Ascari's death and Lancia's financial problems the company withdrew from Grand Prix racing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/timeline/50s.html|title=Formula One timeline|accessdate=2007-06-27|work=atlasf1.autosport.com[/tpl] Altogether Lancia took two victories and ten podiums in Formula One.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.4mula1.ro/history/team/Lancia|title=Lancia Formula 1 Team|accessdate=2007-06-27|work=4mula1.ro[/tpl]
Remnants of the Lancia team were transferred to Scuderia Ferrari,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ddavid.com/formula1/lancia.htm|title=Lancia D50|accessdate=2007-06-27|work=ddavid.com[/tpl] where Juan Manuel Fangio won the 1956 championship with a Lancia-Ferrari car.

===Rallying===

Lancia has been very successful in motorsport over the years, and mostly in the arena of rallying. Prior to the forming of the World Rally Championship, Lancia took the final International Championship for Manufacturers title with the Fulvia in 1972. In the WRC, they remain the most statistically successful marque (despite having withdrawn at the end of the 1993 season), winning constructors' titles with the Stratos (1974, 1975 and 1976), the 037 (1983) and the Delta (six consecutive wins from 1987 to 1992). The Delta is also the most successful individual model designation ever to compete in rallying. All this gave Lancia a total of 11 Championships over the years.
Juha Kankkunen and Miki Biasion both won two drivers' titles with the Delta. Among other drivers to take several World Rally Championship wins with Lancia were Markku Alén, Didier Auriol, Sandro Munari, Bernard Darniche, Walter Röhrl, Björn Waldegård and Henri Toivonen. The history of the brand in rallying is also tainted with tragedy, with deaths of Italian driver Attilio Bettega at the 1985 Tour de Corse in a Lancia 037 and then Finnish championship favourite Toivonen in a Lancia Delta S4 at the same rally exactly a year later. These deaths would eventually lead to the end of Group B rallying.

===Sports car racing===

During Lancia's dominance of rallying, the company also expanded into sports cars in the late 1970s until the mid-1980s. Originally running the Stratos HF in Group 4, as well as a brief interlude with a rare Group 5 version, the car was replaced with the successful Beta Montecarlo Turbo winning the FIA's 1980 World Championship for Makes and 1981 World Endurance Championship for Makes and the 1980 Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft.
In 1982 the team moved up to Group 6 with the LC1 Spyder, followed by the Group C LC2 coupé which featured a Ferrari powerplant in 1983. The LC2 was a match for the standard-setting Porsche 956 in terms of raw speed, securing 13 pole positions over its lifetime, however its results were hampered by poor reliability and fuel economy and it only managed to win three European and World Endurance Championship races. The team's inability to compete against the dominant Porsche 956 and 962 sports cars led it to drop out of sportscar racing at the end of 1986 in order to concentrate on rallying, although private teams continued to enter LC2s with declining results until the early 1990s.

====Titles====

==Commercial vehicles==

Lancia produced a wide range of vans, trucks, buses and military vehicles from the beginning, forming Lancia Veicoli Industriali in 1912. Lancia slowly withdrew from the commercial sectors during the late 1960s and production of commercial vehicles ended in the early 1970s, shortly after Fiat's takeover of the company, with some models transferred to Iveco.

In 2009, the British motoring television show Top Gear suggested that Lancia had more 'great' models than any other car company.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/uk/videos/brand-new-clip-topgear-loves-lancia-part-1 |title=Top Gear Loves Lancia part 1 |publisher=Top Gear.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-26[/tpl] The presenters went on to test the Gamma Coupé, Fulvia Coupé, Aprilia, Montecarlo, Beta Coupé, HPE, Stratos, 037, Delta Integrale Evo II and Thema 8.32. They also stated during their review that Lancia made the best looking cars, even though they are unreliable.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
