The Somerset Region is a local government area located in the West Moreton region of South East Queensland, Australia, about [tpl]convert|100|km|mi|0[/tpl] northwest of Brisbane and centred on the town of Esk. It was created in 2008 from a merger of the Shire of Esk and the Shire of Kilcoy.  It is commonly known as the Brisbane Valley, due to the Brisbane River which courses through the region,[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.qt.com.au/story/2012/05/29/somerset-tourism-in-break-from-brisbane-ipswich/ |title=Individual marketing for Somerset |author=Geoff Egan |accessdate=22 June 2012 |date=29 May 2012 |newspaper=The Queensland Times [/tpl] although significant parts of the region lie outside the hydrological Brisbane Valley itself.
The Esk and Kilcoy Shires were amalgamated to consolidate the water catchments for the Wivenhoe and Somerset Dams. The Local Government Reform Commission identified that the long term future of Somerset would be as a major water catchment for the SEQ region with farming being the main economic activity within a water catchment management regime. The "planning strategy and land use policies" implemented by the Somerset Regional Council are therefore "directed this end".[tpl]cite web|url=http://mountgarnet.org.au/reportTRC.pdf|author=Local Government Reform Commission|title=Report of the Local Government Reform Commission Volume 1|date=July 2007|accessdate=23 June 2012|page=12[/tpl]
The Somerset Regional Council, which administers the region, has an estimated operating budget of [tpl]AUD[/tpl]50 million. (Council’s 2011/2012 budget adopted in June 2012 showed total operating revenue of [tpl]AUD[/tpl]50,049,250Somerset Regional Council Budget, 29 June 2012). The Somerset region comprises the primary water catchment for the Somerset and Wivenhoe Dams that form an essential part of the water supply grid for South East Queensland.South East Queensland Water Grid.

==History==

===Indigenous history===

The traditional owners of the Brisbane Valley district are the Jagera, Yuppera and Ugarapul people who occupied the region for thousands of years prior to European settlement.Lowood's Story: http://lowood.qld.au/history

===European exploration===

The Somerset region in South East Queensland was originally settled by European pastoralists in the 1840s after the New South Wales Government had opened up the land around the penal colony at Moreton Bay. The pioneers of this region sought land along the Brisbane and Stanley Rivers for raising sheep.  There were several exploration maps to guide them.  John Oxley discovered the Brisbane River in December 1823 with a castaway John Finnegan as his guide who had been shipwrecked on Moreton Island and cared for by the indigenous peoples there. Oxley’s recommendations lead to a penal colony being established at Redcliffe (1824) and Brisbane the following year.  Before this penal colony was closed in 1839 Botanist and explorer Alan Cunningham had discovered Spicers Gap (1827) and Cunninghams Gap (1828) through the Great Dividing Range that would link the Darling Downs with Ipswich and Brisbane.  He had also climbed Mount Esk, crossed Lockyer’s Plains (later Cressbrook), named a unique bend in the Brisbane River near Wivenhoe "Pedal Bight" and climbed Lister’s Peak situated two miles south east of Linville.  John Gray had explored to Fernvale; Edmund Lockyer had mapped the junction of the Stanley and Brisbane rivers and Mount Brisbane in 1826 and by 1830 Captain Patrick Logan, Commandant of the penal colony of Moreton Bay had discovered the Logan River (1829), the Bremer River (1827) and explored the Brisbane and Stanley rivers and possibly Kilcoy Creek (1830). He is thought to have been killed by indigenous tribesmen near Wivenhoe on the Brisbane River on 18 October 1830.J.G.Steele (1983). The Explorers of the Moreton Bay district 1770 -1830.

===Settlement===

According to Henry Stuart Russell the early settlers of the Brisbane Valley followed in the footsteps of Walter & Patrick Leslie.Henry Stuart Russell (1888), The Genesis of Queensland by reprinted by  Vintage Books, Toowoomba Aust. 1988, p231 They had "blazed a trail to the Darling Downs, marking the first tree at Wyndam’s Stockyards, down the Severn which they crossed near Texas and thence to the Condamine River between Tummaville and Ellangowan where, at Leslie’s Crossing Place, the marked tree line ended."French, M. (1989) A History of the Darling Downs Frontier: Conflict on the Condamine. Darling Downs Institute Press. Toowoomba. p.60. From the Downs the settlers crossed the Great Dividing Range at the new Gormans Gap, discovered by Owen Gorman and then followed Lockyer Creek to Tarampa and up the Brisbane and Stanley rivers to their headwaters. The first settlers on the eastern side of the Great Dividing Range as listed by Russell were "Cocky" Rogers with Mocatta’s sheep at Grantham; Somerville at Tent Hill and Richard Jones at Helidon.  Following these were Frederick and Francis Bigge (Mt. Brisbane), Evan and Colin Mackenzie (Kilcoy), the McConnel Brothers (David and Frederic) at Cressbrook  and the Balfour Brothers (John and Robert) at Colinton.
At the end of August, 1843, the Anglican missionary John GregorE.G. Pryce & John Gregor. (1846). Two Journals of Missionary Tours in the Districts of Manéroo and Moreton Bay, New South Wales, in 1843.  London: The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. spent a fortnight in the Brisbane River valley visiting all the settlers at that time.  He saw David Archer at Durundur and his guest Ludwig Leichhardt and then visited  the superintendent of Kilcoy station, John Macdonald.  He spoke with  Frederick and Francis Bigge at Mt. Brisbane, Alexander and Gideon Scott at Mt. Esk (where they only ran cattle) and D.C. McConnel and his superintendent Henry Mort at Cressbrook.  He stayed with John Balfour at Colinton, Graham and Ivory at Eskdale, Borthwick and Oliver at Buaraba and Wingate and Fletcher at Lockyer’s Creek.  From here he returned to Ipswich.  Approaching Kilcoy station Gregor had noted "a number of the aborigines, who were very vociferous in their calls of "Name you," but did not attempt to deal us any blows. They were, however, all armed with shields, spears, waddies, and boomerangs".  This was the only property "which Gregor wished to leave as soon as possible for several reasons".  In 1842, race relations faltered after the deaths of up to 60 Aboriginals at Kilcoy station who were poisoned by flour which was laced with strychnine.Qld.

Baker’s map of 1846 shows the relative positions of the pioneer families of the Somerset region around the Stanley and Brisbane Rivers.  Cressbrook is the only property still managed by the pioneering McConnel family, and both the homestead and its Victoria chapel designed by Robin Dods are now on the Queensland Heritage Register (Place ID 600503).Map RM1076: National Library of Australia.

Two other buildings associated with this early stage of the history of the Somerset region are still available to the public.  One is the Bellevue Homestead that was built for the North family and was relocated during the building of the Wivenhoe Dam.  The homestead is currently privately owned by John And Laurel DingleBellevue Homestead Chronology of ownership and is open to public.Bellevue Homestead website The earliest sections of Bellevue Homestead date from the 1870s and it is now heritage listed (Place ID600492) and welcomes visitors. The other is a shepherd’s slab hut from Colinton Station that has been relocated to the grounds of Ringsfield House, Nanango.

===Local government===

The Durundur Division was incorporated on 11 November 1879 under the Divisional Boards Act 1879. Its name was changed to Esk on 5 June 1880 by proclamation. With the passage of the Local Authorities Act 1902, Esk became a shire on 31 March 1903.
The Shire of Kilcoy, historically part of the Caboolture Division and later the Shire of Caboolture, was proclaimed on 22 February 1912.
In July 2007, the Local Government Reform Commission released its report and recommended that Esk and Kilcoy amalgamate. Both councils opposed the amalgamation.[tpl]cite book|title=Report of the Local Government Reform Commission|author=Queensland Local Government Reform Commission|volume=2|pages=285–290|isbn=1-921057-11-4|date=July 2007|url=http://www.dlgp.qld.gov.au/resources/map/reform/somerset-rationale.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2010[/tpl] On 15 March 2008, the two Shires formally ceased to exist, and elections were held on the same day to elect six councillors and a mayor to the Regional Council.
