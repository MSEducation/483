==History==

Seeking a way in which to encourage visitors to Manhattan to see New York City's other four boroughs, the six organizations came together to promote Brooklyn as a cultural destination.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/arts/20010901/1/96|title=Heart of Brooklyn|accessdate=2008-02-17|year=2001-09|author=Simon Watson|work=Gotham Gazette[/tpl] Although it was officially founded in 2001, the organizations had been working together on an unofficial level since 1998 with the launching of the program's summer camp, called Brooklyn Cultural Adventures Program or BCAP.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.heartofbrooklyn.org/about/press/press_pdfs/Articles/General/Daily%20News%202-14-02.pdf|title=Wedding Day for Six Cultural Institutions|accessdate=2008-02-17|date=2002-02-14|author=Bill Farrell|work=Daily News |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014015944/http://www.heartofbrooklyn.org/about/press/press_pdfs/Articles/General/Daily+News+2-14-02.pdf  |archivedate = 2007-10-14[/tpl] Through the formal partnership established in 2001 and launched on Valentine's Day in 2002,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.heartofbrooklyn.org/about/press/press_pdfs/Articles/General/Brooklyn%20Pages%202-25-02.pdf|title=Heart of the Matter|accessdate=2008-02-17|date=2002-02-25|author=Patrick Gallahue|work=Brooklyn Pages |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014015912/http://www.heartofbrooklyn.org/about/press/press_pdfs/Articles/General/Brooklyn+Pages+2-25-02.pdf  |archivedate = 2007-10-14[/tpl] the group was able to expand its offerings and better pool its resources.

==Activities==

HOB runs the Brooklyn Cultural Adventures Program (BCAP), a program and summer camp based at HOB's member institutions. The camp is designed to engage children in cultural activities during the summer as well as introduce them to the organizations and their collections thereby attracting a new generation of cultural consumers.
Heart of Brooklyn's goal is to make its organizations more visible and accessible. The partnership runs a free shuttle service called The HOB Connection,[tpl]cite web|title=Heart of Brooklyn - Connection|url=http://www.heartofbrooklyn.org/connection/|publisher=Heart of Brooklyn|date=2008-11-01|accessdate=2009-04-14[/tpl] announced in November 2008, which delivers passengers to its cultural institutions. The new service is designed to help tourists in Manhattan and residents of Brooklyn reach the cultural hub surrounding Prospect Park.
HOB also works with local merchants and community leaders on neighborhood revitalization efforts, having been selected as a Core Provider for Avenue NYC as well as participating in the NYC Clean Streets program.[tpl]cite web|title=Heart of Brooklyn - Programs|url=http://www.heartofbrooklyn.org/programs/|publisher=Heart of Brooklyn|accessdate=2009-07-23[/tpl] HOB is a member of and active participant in the Washington Avenue-Prospect Heights Merchants Association (WAPHA).
