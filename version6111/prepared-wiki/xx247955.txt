"Quel cœur vas-tu briser" (English translation:  "Which heart are you going to break") was the Swiss entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1967, performed in French by Géraldine Gaulier.
The song was performed sixth on the night, following Portugal's Eduardo Nascimento with "O vento mudou" and preceding Sweden's Östen Warnerbring with "Som en dröm". At the close of voting, it received no points and was placed 17th (last place).
The song is a ballad in which Géraldine asks a former lover whose heart he is going to break now that hers no longer beats for him. She tells him that she has forgotten him and asks him who will be the next victim of his false passions.
The song was succeeded as Swiss representative at the 1968 Contest by Gianni Mascolo performing "Guardando il sole".
