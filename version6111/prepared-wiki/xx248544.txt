CATEGORIES: Intel Corporation

Perceptual Computing (PerC) is an organization within Intel Corporation tasked with the research, development, and productization of technologies for natural user interaction. The objective of PerC is to explore consumer-focused hardware and software applications of close-range hand and finger gestures, speech recognition, face recognition and tracking, and augmented reality.[tpl]cite web|title=Perceptual Computing and the Future of UI|url=http://software.intel.com/sites/billboard/article/designing-intuitive-human-computer-interaction-naturally|publisher=Intel Corporation|accessdate=2013-10-19[/tpl] The organization is funded by a $100 million grant from Intel Capital.[tpl]cite web|title=Intel creates $100 million fund for Perceptual Computing|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11386_3-57587699-76/intel-creates-$100-million-fund-for-perceptual-computing/|publisher=CNet|accessdate=2013-10-19[/tpl]
In 2013, PerC launched their first product, the Senz3D, a Time Of Flight depth camera in partnership with Creative Technology.[tpl]cite web|title=Creative Announces the Senz3Dâ„¢ Interactive Gesture Camera|url=http://www.creative.com/corporate/pressroom/?id=13361/|publisher=Creative Technologies|accessdate=2013-10-19[/tpl] 
The camera is similar to the Microsoft Kinect, however it is targeted at gestural interactions within a shorter range.[tpl]cite web|title=Depth Sensor Shootout: Kinect, Leap, and Intel|url=http://stimulant.io/wp/index.php/blog/2013/04/depth-sensor-shootout/|publisher=Stimulant|accessdate=2013-10-19[/tpl]  PerC has released an SDK to help external developers build games and applications using the multi-modal sensing capabilities of the Senz3D device.[tpl]cite web|title=Intel Perceptual Computing SDK 2013|url=http://software.intel.com/en-us/vcsource/tools/perceptual-computing-sdk|publisher=Intel Corporation|accessdate=2013-10-19[/tpl]
