==Recording and composition==

As the final song on the album, "Slim Slow Slider" was also the last song recorded on the final session on October 15, 1968 at Century Sound Studios in New York City with Lewis Merenstein as producer.Heylin, Can You Feel the Silence?, p. 518  John Payne who played soprano saxophone on this song says there was a long section at the end of this song that was cut off.   "It was five to ten minutes of instrumental jamming, semi-baroque and jazz stuff."Rogan, No Surrender, p. 227
In Morrison's words, the subject of this song is "a person who is caught up in a big city like London or maybe is on dope." Brian Hinton describes it as being an intrusion between the two poles of Belfast and America in the other songs. "The craziness of "Cyprus Avenue" has come home, so that the streets of Notting Hill become 'some sandy beach', in the junkies eyes....We are back in the world of "T.B. Sheets", and a twelve bar blues, and Van's chuckle is truly nasty. After all those rebirths, here is a song about winter, "white as snow", and death..."Hinton, Celtic Crossroads, p. 98 The song ends abruptly with Van slapping on the side of his guitar.

==Other releases==

"Slim Slow Slider"  was also featured on Morrison's 2009 album Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl, recorded forty years after the classic album  Astral Weeks was first released.  Morrison changed the song's placement on this album to the third song instead of the final song;  adding also to the length and content and entitling the new addition: "I Start Breaking Down".
