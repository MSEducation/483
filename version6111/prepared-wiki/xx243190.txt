==Magic: The Gathering==

Kibler began his Magic: The Gathering career at the age of fifteen, placing 30th in the Junior Division of the first-ever Pro Tour, Pro Tour New York 1996.  Kibler would not qualify for the senior Pro Tour until Pro Tour Chicago 1998, which he qualified for by winning Grand Prix Toronto 1997.  Kibler notes that all his opponents in the Top 8 of Grand Prix Toronto went on to work at Wizards of the Coast, including Mike Turian, Matt Place and Erik Lauer.  Kibler would also attend Pro Tour Los Angeles in the 1997-1998 season, placing within the Top 64, however he would not return to the Pro Tour until the 1999-2000 season.
Kibler made his first Pro Tour Top 8 at Pro Tour Chicago 2000.  This was also the tournament where Kibler would earn the nickname of The Dragonmaster, after beating Jon Finkel in the Swiss rounds and Zvi Mowshowitz in the quarterfinals with a combination of [tpl]mtgcard|Rith, the Awakener[/tpl] and [tpl]mtgcard|Armadillo Cloak[/tpl].  He would go on to lose to Kai Budde in the semi-finals, taking third place in the overall standings.[tpl]cite web|title=2000 Pro Tour Chicago Coverage|url=http://www.wizards.com/sideboard/event.asp?event=PTCHI00|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|accessdate=7 November 2011|year=2000[/tpl]  This would be Brian's best Pro Tour performance before he retired from the game at the end of the 2004 season.  In 2005, Brian was one of a small number of players commemorated by Wizards of the Coast with a "Pro Player" collectible reference card.[tpl]cite web|last=Forsythe|first=Aaron|title=Ask Wizards - April, 2006|url=http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/askwizards/0406|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|accessdate=8 November 2011|date=5 April 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Brian Kibler (Pro Player Card)|url=http://sales.starcitygames.com/carddisplay.php?product=39329|publisher=StarCityGames.com|accessdate=8 November 2011[/tpl]
After taking several years away from Magic (while working at Wizards direct competitor Upper Deck) he returned in 2009.  Kibler claims that a major motivating factor for his return was his desire to enter the Pro Tour Hall of Fame, which was created the year following his retirement.  Kibler would make consecutive Pro Tour Top 8s upon his return, making Top 8 at Pro Tour Honolulu before going on to win his first Pro Tour at Pro Tour Austin, defeating Tsuyoshi Ikeda in the tournament finals.[tpl]cite web|last=Stark|first=Bill|title=Pro Tour–Austin Finals: Panic in Austin – Menagerie Breaks Loose!|url=http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptaus09/finals|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|accessdate=7 November 2011|date=18 October 2009[/tpl]  By the end of the year he placed in the top 10 of the year's best performers on the Magic Pro Tour achieving enough points to guarantee him invites to major championships, free air travel, and a guaranteed appearance fee for attending all 2010 events.Pro Players Club Additionally, he was tied for 6th among player committee votes of the possible entrants for the 2009 Magic: The Gathering Hall of Fame carrying around 20% of their vote.[tpl]cite web|title=09results: Magic Pro Tour Hall of Fame|url=http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/HallOfFame.aspx?x=mtgevent/hof/09results&tablesort=4b|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|accessdate=8 November 2011[/tpl] In 2010, Kibler's high performance continued, granting him his third Grand Prix title, another Pro Tour Top 8 and finally induction into the Hall of Fame.
