Weezer themselves have listed several influences, among them Kiss (with direct references in the song "In the Garage"), Nirvana (who were their labelmates at DGC for a very brief time before Kurt Cobain's death), The Beach Boys, Pixies (especially early in their career), Sonic Youth, Oasis, and Wax.[tpl]cite web|last=Brown |first=Lane |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2009/10/weezers_rivers_cuomo_on.html |title=Weezer’s Rivers Cuomo on Flubbing Lil Wayne’s Lyrics - Vulture |publisher=Nymag.com |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2010-09-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Goodman |first=William |url=http://www.spin.com/articles/weezers-rivers-cuomo-covers-beach-boys |title=Weezer's Rivers Cuomo Covers the Beach Boys | SPIN | SPIN Mix | Videos |publisher=SPIN |date=2011-01-04 |accessdate=2013-01-24[/tpl] Early Weezer demos, such as "Paperface", have obvious musical ties to the Pixies and Nirvana. Also, the song "Susanne" originally contained the lyrics, "Even Kurt Cobain and Axl Rose", before being changed to "Even Izzy, Slash, and Axl Rose" after Cobain's death. There is also a direct reference to Nevermind in "Heart Songs", a track found on The Red Album. As a side project, Weezer briefly played Nirvana and Oasis covers under the stage moniker "Goat Punishment". In 1998, Weezer covered "Velouria" by the Pixies for a tribute album, and in 2005 briefly got to tour with their idols for a few dates. Green Day has also been said to be an influence (there is a lyric about them in "El Scorcho"), and it has been acknowledged that the two bands are friends and enjoy each other's music. Weezer contributed the song "Worry Rock" to A Different Shade of Green: Tribute to Green Day. Cuomo also covered "Brain Stew" in a 2009 AOL Sessions set.
