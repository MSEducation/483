Raiden is a fictional character from Konami's Metal Gear series. Created by Hideo Kojima and designed by Yoji Shinkawa, Raiden was introduced in the series as the main player character of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. In Metal Gear Solid 2, he appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit FOXHOUND, participating in his first mission. Despite coming across as rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian child soldier. Raiden reappears as a supporting character in Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots and returns as the main character of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance dealing both with his past and his present life as a combatant. 
The idea of creating Raiden originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view the Metal Gear series protagonist Solid Snake from a different point of view, inspired by the Sherlock Holmes stories. Raiden's inclusion remained a secret to gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked his character. Raiden's debut role as the protagonist of Metal Gear Solid 2 became controversial for two reasons: the unexpected substitution of the established hero Solid Snake and Raiden's androgynous appearance. Some critics have defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been highly praised for his role and Metal Gear Solid 4 redesign and even more in his role and design in Revengeance.

==Character design==

===Creation and appearance===

According to series creator Hideo Kojima, the decision to make a new character replace Solid Snake for most of Metal Gear Solid 2 stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective instead. Kojima also stated that Raiden's character and its perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the Sherlock Holmes short stories and novels in which the narrator was not the title character, but his friend Dr. Watson. Kojima affirmed that Snake was the game's protagonist instead of Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a "weak-looking character", but decided to follow Kojima.[tpl]cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|publisher=GameSpot|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006[/tpl] The codename "Raiden" was based on a historical combat aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service, the Mitsubishi J2M Raiden.[tpl]cite web| url=http://m.kotaku.com/5844190/what-osama-bin-laden-and-metal-gear-solid-have-in-common|title=What Osama bin Laden and Metal Gear Solid Have in Common|date=September 27, 2011|publisher=Kotaku |author=Ashcraft, Brian|accessdate=November 22, 2011[/tpl] It was initially planned to be written in katakana as [tpl]nihongo|"ライデン"[/tpl], but was changed to the kanji form [tpl]nihongo|"雷電"[/tpl] because of the original resemblance to Bin Laden's "Laden" in katakana, [tpl]nihongo|"ラーディン"[/tpl].[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.1up.com/features/how-japans-earthquake-changed-developers?pager.offset=1|title=How Japan's Earthquake Changed its Developers|publisher=1UP.com |accessdate=November 22, 2011[/tpl] The relationship between Raiden and Rosemary was inspired by Kojima's own experiences; their names, Jack and Rose, are a reference to characters in the film Titanic. Raiden in Metal Gear Solid 2 is considered to be a representation of the player through the experiences between the player and the character during the game.[tpl]cite web|author=James Howell & Ryan Payton|title=The Kojima Productions Report Session 084|publisher=Kojima Productions|date=March 20, 2008|url=http://www.kjp.konami.jp/gs/hideoblog_e/2008/03/000153.html|accessdate=November 24, 2009[/tpl]
Kojima received much fan mail; one letter was from a girl who stated she did not want to play a game with an old man. He took this into consideration; he and his team designed a character more appealing to women, resulting in Raiden's appearance. Designer Yoji Shinkawa noted that he and the other character designers took a great deal of inspiration for Raiden's appearance from the bishōnen archetype.[tpl]cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence|year=2006|developer=Kojima Productions|publisher=Konami|level=Metal Gear Saga Vol. 1[/tpl] Because Raiden was a new character the staff designed him carefully, giving him white hair to symbolize his introduction. Shinkawa further noted that Raiden ended up with an overall feminine appearance.[tpl]cite video game|title=The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2|year=2002|developer=Kojima Productions|publisher=Konami|level=Making of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty[/tpl] His outfit (the Skull Suit) was difficult to  design until the staff decided on a "bonelike" concept. Shinkawa wanted to make Raiden sexually appealing, emphasizing the tightness of his clothing.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/mgs2/art/third.html|title=Yoji Shinkawa Interview: Segment 3|publisher=Konami |accessdate=March 1, 2011[/tpl]
Konami kept Raiden's starring role in Metal Gear Solid 2 secret until the game's North American release, going so far as to replace Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials. Although Raiden appeared in several preview trailers in his scuba gear, his presence was not emphasized. Raiden's appearance in the game was announced to the Japanese press on the day of the game's release in North America.[tpl]cite video game|title=The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2|year=2002|developer=Kojima Productions|publisher=Konami|quote=[/tpl] 
Kojima noted that fan response to Raiden's character was both positive and negative. While accepting considerable negative feedback, Kojima and his team liked the character. Therefore, they made him comic relief from the videos in which Raiden tries to become the main character from Metal Gear Solid 4. In response to positive response in Japan, the Raikov character was created for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater as a parody of Raiden. While noting that Raiden would not be a playable character in Metal Gear Solid 4 Kojima confirmed his appearance in the game to website 1UP.com, stating that fans would like him by the end.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www2.1up.com/features/saving-private-raiden?pager.offset=3|title=Saving Private Raiden|publisher=1UP.com |accessdate=June 4, 2011[/tpl] For this title, Raiden's new design was a response to the criticism that only his face remained in his cybernetic body. Shinkawa, himself, was surprised by the way he came to illustrate Raiden. The staff noted that Raiden's debut in the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer received notably positive responses; several video-game magazines promoted the game with Raiden's screenshots.[tpl]cite web| url=http://mp.i-revo.jp/user.php/kp-ryan/entry/52.html|title=The KP Report Session 027|publisher=mp.i.revo|work=Kojima Productions Report|author=Payton, Ryan|accessdate=February 17, 2012[/tpl] Kojima echoed similar comments, indicating that he wanted to expand the character with another game.[tpl]cite web| url=http://gamerant.com/hideo-kojima-solid-snake-project-ogre-metal-gear-rising-ts-123571/|title=Hideo Kojima Talks Killing Snake, Project Ogre, Metal Gear Rising & More!|publisher=GameRant|author=Schirado, Tyler|date=January 5, 2012|accessdate=February 20, 2012[/tpl] Raiden's first fight against Vamp in the game caused difficulty to motion and voice actors because of carefully planned movements performed by the two fighters. The staff was nevertheless satisfied with the outcome, considering it one of the best battles in the game.[tpl]cite video|title=Making of Metal Gear Solid 4|medium=Blu-ray|publisher=Konami Digital Entertainment GmbH|date=2008[/tpl]
When Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was known as Metal Gear Solid: Rising, former producer Shigenobu Matsuyama hinted that Raiden's past as a child soldier would be elaborated and his weaknesses as a human would be explored. Matsuyama wanted Raiden to have as strong a role in the game as in Metal Gear Solid 2, leading him to become the game's main character.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-09-13-metal-gear-solid-rising-interview?page=1 |title=Metal Gear Solid: Rising Interview |publisher=Eurogamer |author=Wesley Yin-Poole |date=September 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 14, 2010[/tpl] Director Mineshi Kimura noted that he wanted Raiden to be able to move like he did in the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailers, wanting to show "the stealth of the sword, and the strength of not even losing to the gun, and the fear and power you have with this blade." Matsuyama stated that they would focus on Raiden's strong will and physical strength, so he would be enjoyable to control.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.videogamer.com/pc/metal_gear_solid_rising/preview-2640.html |title=Metal Gear Solid: Rising Preview|publisher=VideoGamer.com |author=Gatson, Martin |date=August 28, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2011[/tpl] Raiden's design was changed during the game's development, leading to different promotional images of him.[tpl]cite web| url=http://m.kotaku.com/5460065/metal-gear-solid-risings-raiden-has-changed |title=Metal Gear Solid: Rising's Raiden Has Changed|publisher=Kotaku |author=McWhertor, Michael |date=January 29, 2010  |accessdate=July 15, 2011[/tpl] Following the game's reboot into a spin-off, Developers stated that while Raiden "has grown up" in comparison to previous Metal Gear games, he is still conflicted with his life as a child soldier in a past civil war, leading him to be a "dark hero".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/e3-2012-platinum-details-metal-gear-rising-revengeance|title=E3 2012: Platinum details Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance|publisher=Edge|date=June 1, 2012|accessdate=June 4, 2012[/tpl] Shinkawa designed Raiden's new body as a way to emphasize him being a dark hero contrasting his Metal Gear Solid 4 persona and later discussed with Platinum Games' Kenji Saito about including his quasi-human look. Raiden losing an eye also serves to represent his transformation across the story.[tpl]cite book|title=Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance The Complete Official Guide|publisher=Piggyback |year=2013|isbn=978-0307897169[/tpl] In response to complaints regarding how Rising appeared to contradict Raiden's ending in Guns of the Patriots, the Kojima Productions staff explained the game would explain what happened with Raiden's life.[tpl]cite web|title=Kojima Productions Podcast Session 153|publisher=Kojima Productions|date=January 26, 2012|url=http://www.kjp.konami.jp/gs/hideoblog_e/2012/01/|accessdate=December 29, 2012[/tpl]
Raiden is first depicted as a white-haired adult who uses a protective black-and-blue suit for his missions known as a [tpl]nihongo|"Skull Suit"|スカルスーツ|Sukaru Sūtsu[/tpl].[tpl]cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty|year=2001|developer=Konami Computer Entertainment Japan|publisher=Konami|quote=Colonel: Your new Sneaking suit uses electrofiber technology, a by-product of fiber-optics research. The texture isn't far removed from rubber but the material protects against a wide range of toxic substances. The suit itself has a wide array of built-in sensors. It is referred to as "Smart Skin" in military R&D. Data about damage to different regions of the body, including blood loss, is exchanged between the suit and the intravenous nanomachines to create a bio-feedback system. ... They call this the "Skull Suit" in FOXHOUND.[/tpl] In Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots Raiden has had his entire body below the upper jaw replaced with a prototype cybernetic body ; he has also had his blood replaced with a military substitute called [tpl]nihongo|"White Blood"|白血|Shiro Chi[/tpl], which requires regular maintenance.[tpl]cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots|year=2008|developer=Kojima Productions|publisher=Konami|quote=Naomi Hunter: That's right.

Right now, he's slipping into autotoxemia.[/tpl] His original cybernetic body is replaced with a black one for Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance that also covers his left eye. Although proficient at all types of weaponry, Raiden specializes in wielding swords which resonate at high frequencies for the last fights in Sons of Liberty[tpl]cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty|year=2001|developer=Konami Computer Entertainment Japan|publisher=Konami|quote=Solid Snake: Olga asked me to give it to you. Besides, I'm not a big fan of blades.[/tpl] and during Guns of the Patriots and Revengeance. [tpl]-[/tpl]

===Personality and portrayal===

In his first appearances Raiden is a rookie agent who, as a result of training only in virtual reality, is inexperienced. However, he later reveals that he was feared as a child soldier—known as [tpl]nihongo|"Jack the Ripper"|ジャック・ザ・リッパー|Jakku Za Rippā[/tpl]—who killed several enemies in a civil war and is ashamed of his past.[tpl]cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty|year=2001|developer=Konami Computer Entertainment Japan|publisher=Konami|quote=Raiden: No, it was field training, when I was a kid. I lied, Snake. I have more field experience than I can remember. It's not VR that's doing this to me. / Solid Snake: Raiden, we don't carry guns to take people down. We're not here to help some politician either. / Raiden: You can say that because you're a legend, a hero. I'm Jack the Ripper, a dirty reminder -- of a terrible mistake.[/tpl] This affects Raiden's personality; he begins to believe he is only useful in the battlefield and his relationship with his girlfriend, Rosemary, would not work. Manipulation by the Patriots causes him to believe he does not have free will. Raiden is encouraged by Solid Snake not to be concerned with what people tell him, but to rely on himself to face his problems.[tpl]cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty|year=2001|developer=Konami Computer Entertainment Japan|publisher=Konami|quote=Solid Snake: Listen, don't obsess over words so much. Find the meaning behind the words, then decide. You can find your own name. And your own future... ... I know you didn't have much in terms of choices this time. But everything you felt, thought about during this mission is yours. And what you decide to do with them is your choice... / Raiden: You mean start over? / Solid Snake: Yeah, a clean slate. A new name, new memories. Choose your own legacy. It's for you to decide. It's up to you[/tpl]
In the Japanese versions of the games Raiden has been voiced by Kenyu Horiuchi,[tpl]cite web|title=堀内 賢雄|publisher=Kenyu Office|language=Japanese|url=http://www.kenyu-office.com/profile/horiuchikenyu.html|accessdate=October 7, 2011[/tpl] who felt he could understand the character's pain; despite becoming a cyborg, Raiden still acted like a human. Quinton Flynn was selected to voice Raiden in the series' English adaptation by casting director Kris Zimmerman, who had previously worked with him. Flynn remembers having a long time to develop the character, being instructed by Zimmerman to use an older voice from a character he previously voiced. Flynn stated that Raiden was one of his favorite video-game voice characters, and explained a notable difference between his roles in Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 4.[tpl]cite web|title=Raiden Speaks! An interview with Quinton Flynn|publisher=The Gaming Liberty|date=May 21, 2011  |url=http://thegamingliberty.com/index.php/2011/05/21/raiden-speaks-an-interview-with-quinton-flynn-part-1/|accessdate=June 30, 2011[/tpl]
Kojima Productions have compared Raiden and Solid Snake as to their experiences and ways of thinking. During the game's climax, Raiden stays handcuffed until his final fight against Solidus Snake; Snake escapes from his handcuffs to follow Revolver Ocelot, emphasizing Raiden's lack of freedom. Hideo Kojima compared Raiden and Snake with movie monsters King Kong and Godzilla, respectively; the former was taken from his home and his nature changed upon meeting Rosemary, whereas the latter will continue fighting against mankind's menaces. Defeating Solidus, Raiden is encouraged by Snake to trust himself and believe in his own choices. This is further addressed by the staff's motivation to make a new sequel to Metal Gear without Kojima. Kojima has also likened him with John Rambo from the Rambo series as both characters always find themselves taking part in battles despite their desire for a peaceful resolution.[tpl]Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CVG_News/status/304968402521423872 | title=CVG News|publisher=Twitter|work=Computer and Video Games|date=February 22, 2013 |accessdate=March 3, 2013[/tpl]

This results in Raiden abruptly resigning from Maverick to pursue and retrieving the children's brain casings from World Marshal, having to battle his "Jack the Ripper" persona in the process. Although Raiden is successful in defeating Desperado he learns that  Steven Armstrong was using such PMCs to distract Raiden as he attempts to create a new "War on Terror". Raiden manages to stop Armstrong's actions and decides not to return to Maverick, having his "own war to fight."

===Other appearances===

Although Raiden does not appear in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, his character is the subject of parody throughout the game by debuting character Raikov. Raiden also appears in an early promotional trailer for Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, fighting for control of the franchise with Solid Snake in a series of comic scenes. A sequel to the trailer was produced entitled "Metal Gear Raiden: Snake Eraser" in which Raiden travels to the past to assassinate Big Boss but fails comically.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/action/metalgearsolid4/news/6133819/tgs-2005-metal-gear-raiden-snake-eraser?mode=news|title=TGS 2005: Metal Gear Raiden: Snake Eraser|publisher=GameSpot |author=Niizumi, Hirohiko |date=September 18, 2005 |accessdate=July 9, 2011[/tpl] In the trailer's English version, Raiden was voiced by Charlie Schlatter (the voice actor for Raikov) instead of Quinton Flynn.

The Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty 2007 comic book adaptation by Alex Garner retells Raiden's role in the series, with few changes made to the story. His relationship with Solidus is explored when he remembers his past; when about to be killed by Solidus, Raiden is saved by Snake.[tpl]cite book|title=Metal Gear Solid: Sons Of Liberty Volume 2|publisher=IDW Publishing |date=December 25, 2007|isbn=978-1-60010-111-3 |author=Garner, Alex; Wood, Ashley[/tpl] The game's novelization by Raymond Benson provides minor modifications to Raiden's history, except for the moment he receives Olga's sword, resulting in a change to his battle psyche. When Raiden kills Solidus he cuts the rope on Federal Hall's flagpole, causing an American flag to fall over his enemy's body.

Raiden's replacement of fan favorite Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid 2 proved controversial, and GamesRadar considered the event a reason to dislike the series overall.[tpl]cite web|title='Controversial' Games: Dealing with Fan Backlash|date=November 10, 2009|author=David Radd|publisher=Industry Gamers|url=http://www.industrygamers.com/galleries/controversial-games-dealing-with-fan-backlash/6/|accessdate=2009-11-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=5 reasons to hate Metal Gear Solid |date=November 10, 2009|author=Reparaz, Mikel|publisher=GamesRadar|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/ps3/f/5-reasons-to-hate-metal-gear-solid/a-201104251739927009/g-20100610112655981027|accessdate=June 29, 2011[/tpl] The same site criticized his role in Metal Gear Solid 2 several times, and called his inclusion one of the worst aspects of the game.[tpl]cite web|title=Shit characters who almost ruined their great games|author=Meikleham, Dave|publisher=GamesRadar|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/ps2/f/shit-characters-who-almost-ruined-their-great-games/a-20100325125657826031/g-2005120719070989166259|accessdate=July 12, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Gaming's most bizarre decisions|date=December 10, 2009|author=Meikleham, Dave|publisher=GamesRadar|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/ps2/f/gamings-most-bizarre-decisions/a-2009121013514764096/g-2005120719070989166259/p-3|accessdate=July 12, 2011[/tpl] In 2004, GameAxis Unwired published a fake interview in which Hideo Kojima expressed regret for creating the character.[tpl]cite journal|author=Santos, Shoeless Wayne|date=September 2004|url=http://books.google.com.ar/books?id=G-kDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT2&dq=The+News+That+Never+Was+GameAxis+Unwired+Raiden&hl=es&sa=X&ei=yFNAT63GMMfh0QGb1cykBw&ved=0CDEQuwUwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The News That Never Was|work=GameAxis Unwired|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|issn=0219-872X|issue=|location=7|page=4|year=2004|accessdate=May 30, 2011[/tpl] While calling Metal Gear Solid 2 one of the biggest disappointments in video-game history, UGO Networks' Marissa Meli cited Raiden's debut as a key problem with the game.[tpl]cite web|title=Trolled: The Biggest Disappointments in Video Games|publisher=UGO Networks|date=June 3, 2011 |author=Meli, Marissa|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/metal-gear-solid-2-2|accessdate=June 30, 2011[/tpl] Meli also commented on Raiden's design, placing him 12th in a list of the most androgynous video game characters.[tpl]cite web|title=He or She?

Writer James Newman commented that fans' reactions were highly negative, as though their expectations had been "betrayed" by Kojima. He compared Raiden to the controversial Star Wars character Jar Jar Binks. Trailers for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (in which Raiden is mocked) were considered by Newman to be Konami's comic response to fans' disapproval.[tpl]cite book |title=Playing with Videogames |pages=39–40 |last=Newman |first=James |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2008 |isbn=0-415-38523-7[/tpl] Raiden proved to be more popular in Japan, with Yoji Shinkawa commenting it was because he matched the stereotype of manga hero.[tpl]cite web|title=The art of Metal Gear: Yoji Shinkawa’s visual legacy|publisher=VG247|date=April 24, 2013  |author=Cook, Dave|url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/04/23/the-art-of-metal-gear-yoji-shinkawas-visual-legacy/|accessdate=April 26, 2013[/tpl] In 2012, manga artist Hiro Mashima drew an illustration of Raiden in anticipation of the series' following games.

Nevertheless, Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell enjoyed Raiden's role, commenting that his interactions with the other characters also helped expand Solid Snake's character.[tpl]cite web|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty - Review|publisher=Eurogamer|date=December 3, 2002  |author=Bramwell, Tom|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_mgs2_ps2|accessdate=June 30, 2011[/tpl] His introduction was given an award for "Biggest Surprise" by GameSpot in 2001,[tpl]cite web|title=Biggest Surprise|publisher=GameSpot|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/bestof_2001/p2_09.html|accessdate=February 4, 2012[/tpl] while Dave Meikleham from GamesRadar listed his appearance as one of the biggest plot twists in a video game since the trailers did not show him.

Regarding response about Raiden replacing Snake as the main character, Flynn thought that fans were angry at the idea that Raiden would replace Snake for all subsequent games. Raiden's relationship with Rosemary was also listed as the most awkward part of the Metal Gear series by 1UP.com, with writer Scott Sharkey speculating about Hideo Kojima's life since the director claimed the relationship was autobiographical. PLAY editor Nick Jones listed the scene in which Raiden is nude as his fourth most favorite moment of the franchise, calling it the "one of the funniest moments in gaming history."[tpl]cite web|title=Metal Gear Solid – My Top Five Moments|publisher=Play |author=Jones, Nick|url=http://www.play-mag.co.uk/editors-blog/metal-gear-solid-%e2%80%93-my-top-five-moments/|accessdate=June 30, 2011[/tpl]
[tpl]quote box|align=left|quote=Raiden demonstrates that cybernetic upgrades don’t just make you a better ninja--they make you more likable too. Raiden was one of the most hated characters in gaming, mostly because he abruptly replaced Snake as the lead in Metal Gear Solid 2, though it didn’t help that he was prone to fits of whining. Even though he showed flashes of swordsmanship akin to the beloved Cyborg Ninja, fans rejected him with a passion.

Response to the character was mainly positive in subsequent games.

===Analysis===

Raiden's role in Metal Gear Solid 2 has been analyzed by several writers, who emphasized how he is intended to represent the actual player.[tpl]cite book|title=Utopic Dreams and Apocalyptic Fantasies: Critical Approaches to Researching Video Game Play|url=http://books.google.com.ar/books?id=drH7l-VYUGEC&pg=PA73&dq=raiden+metal+gear&hl=es&sa=X&ei=E1JhT5H9EKHE0AG2noGVBw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=raiden%20metal%20gear&f=false|pages=87|publisher=Lexington Books|date=September 25, 2010|isbn=978-0-7391-4700-9 |authors=Emmbrick, David [/tpl] Early in the game, when Raiden's virtual reality training is mentioned, the game shows scenes from the prequel Metal Gear Solid where the players took control of Solid Snake.[tpl]cite book|title=Joystick soldiers: the politics of play in military video games|url=http://books.google.com.ar/books?id=RTPmwwL63iwC&pg=PA263&dq=Raiden+Metal+Gear&hl=es&sa=X&ei=cRJhT4HZDcPg0QGS1MDVBw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Raiden%20Metal%20Gear&f=false|pages=263–264|publisher=Routledge|date=August 8, 2009|isbn=978-0-415-99660-0|author=Huntemann, Nina B.[/tpl] Raiden's interaction with veteran Solid Snake identify the former as "a Metal Gear fan".

While this was first interpreted as a fourth wall-breaking joke, the game's climax goes deeper into Raiden's connection with the player.

Upon the revelation of the character's new design as a cyborg ninja, writers noted how Raiden distanced himself from his previous appearance that imitated Solid Snake. They also emphasized how Raiden becomes a different type of game hero with a new, direct fighting style.
