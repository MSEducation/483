Egton is an important local centre for family history. Prior to 1880, many important BMD records were administered from Egton parish. The church in Egton holds detailed transcriptions of parish records. However, the cemetery is some half a mile west, at the old church site. After 1870 many parishioners were buried at nearby Aislaby.
