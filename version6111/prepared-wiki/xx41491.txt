==Biography==

===Early life===

Kyösti Kallio (originally Gustaf Kalliokangas) was born in Ylivieska, Finland. His father was a farmer and a prominent local politician.

===Start of career===

Kallio served in the Diet of Finland 1904–1906 as a member of the Estate of the Peasantry. He joined the newly founded Agrarian Union (a farmers' party) in 1906 and became one of its prominent leaders. He became an Agrarian minister in the Senates of Oskari Tokoi, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud and Juho Kusti Paasikivi.

===Civil war===

During the Civil War in Finland, Kallio hid in Red-dominated Helsinki, because he was at least nominally on the White side and therefore a "class enemy"; he formed a new senate (government) in Helsinki after German troops had defeated the Reds in the city. Afterwards he became a moderate peace-maker and disapproved of retaliation against the Reds.

===Formation of the republic===

During the debates over the form of the new state in 1918, Kallio resigned from the Senate because he supported a republic instead of constitutional monarchy. Eventually, the monarchist stand lost and he returned to the Cabinet to become Prime Minister. He was a reformist who emphasized education, settlement, and land reform. His greatest achievement was "Lex Kallio"  in 1922, legislation allowing the state to buy land to encourage new settlements, and to let the former tenant farmers and other landless rural people buy small farms (see, for example, Seppo Zetterberg et al., ed., "Suomen historian pikkujättiläinen"). 

===Supported prohibition===

He supported Prohibition in Finland, and was dismayed when it was repealed in 1932.

===Non-violent anti-communist===

Kallio was an anti-communist, suppressing the Finnish Communist Party (SKP) in 1923, but he resorted to legislative methods. When the violent right-wing Lapua Movement asked him to become their leader, he refused and was then instead subjected to their death threats.

===President===

Kallio was elected president with the votes of a centrist (Agrarian and Progressive) and social democratic coalition, which wanted to ensure that President Svinhufvud would not be re-elected. Kallio took the role of a parliamentarian president and avoided use of his personal power.
On the eve of the Winter War, when Marshal Mannerheim once again threatened to resign from his post as chairman of Finland's Defence Council due to a schism with the cabinet, Kallio convinced him to stay. During the war Kallio resisted the idea of giving up any territory to the Soviet Union, but was forced to agree to sign the Moscow Peace Treaty in 1940. His health begun to fail – his right arm was paralyzed – and he was not active in the dealings with Germany leading to the Continuation War. On August 27 Kallio suffered a serious stroke.Sakari Virkkunen, Suomen presidentit II:  Kallio - Ryti - Mannerheim ("Finnish Presidents II:  Kallio - Ryti - Mannerheim"), Helsinki:  Otava Publishing Ltd., 1994 Prime Minister Risto Ryti took over his duties. Kallio's heart became weak while he knowingly took risks by agreeing to the formal farewell ceremonies.Virkkunen, "The Finnish Presidents II"Kari Hokkanen, "A Biography of Kyösti Kallio, II:  1930-1940" 1930-1940, Helsinki 1986

===Resignation and Dramatic Death===

Kallio left a notice of resignation on November 27, 1940. He was planning to leave the capital and retire to his farm at Nivala after the farewell ceremonies on the evening of December 19, 1940; but he collapsed and died that night at the Helsinki Central Railway Station in the arms of his adjutant before a guard of honor while a band played the patriotic Finnish march Porilaisten marssi.Aladár Paasonen (1974).

==Religious views==

A significant part of Kallio's personality and a motive for the social reforms which he supported and promoted was his deep Christian
faith, which he had adopted already at home, and which was deepened during his marriage to Kaisa Kallio, who was also a devout
Christian.  Although Kallio was often too busy to go to church, he prayed often when encountering difficulties in making political
decisions, and some of these prayers he recorded in his diary.  He also read Christian books with his wife and often discussed them
by exchanging letters.  He often referred to God in his speeches, and during the Winter War he asked the Finns who were serving
their country to read the Bible.  When he was forced to sign the harsh Moscow Peace Treaty in March 1940, Kallio quoted freely from the Book of Zechariah, saying:  "May my hand, which is forced to sign such a paper, wither." His right arm was paralysed the following summer, and he was forced to switch his writing hand. In the Presidential Palace, shortly before leaving for Helsinki Central Railway Station for the last time, Kallio sang a hymn with his family.Virkkunen, "The Finnish Presidents II"Hokkanen, "A Biography of Kyösti Kallio, II";  "The Presidents of the Republic 1931-1940".
