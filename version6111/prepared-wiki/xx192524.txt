CATEGORIES: Luv' albums, 1993 greatest hits albums

Luv' Gold is a 1993 greatest hits album by Dutch girl group Luv' which features hit singles like You're the Greatest Lover, Trojan Horse, Casanova, Ooh, Yes I Do and some album tracks from the formation's heyday (1977 -  1981). 
This compilation peaked at #14 in the Netherlands and spent 18 weeks on the album 
charts. Luv' hadn't scored a hit album for nearly thirteen years. 
Luv' Gold includes a bonus track, Megamix '93, issued as a single, which reached the 23rd position on the Dutch Top 40.

==Album history==

The release of this compilation was the idea of record producer Will Hoebee, José Hoebee's husband,mentioned at page 4 of CD booklet of Luv' Gold who was inspired by the success of the Abba's and Boney M.'s Gold CDs and the 1970s pop/disco nostalgia. It was also the opportunity for the original Luv' members to reunite. 
Patty Brard, José Hoebee and Marga Scheide had tried in early 1989 to record a comeback CD but they didn't succeed at this time. Marga was the only original singer of the group to carry on with other vocalists. She only scored with the renewed version of the trio a moderate hit single (Welcome to My Party) in Benelux.  
The promotion campaign of the Gold CD started in a notorious Amsterdam gay club (De iT) where the singers appeared in concert. The girl trio later performed on TV (including De Staatsloterijshow on RTL 4 and a TV Special aired on Veronica Details about the TV Special "Discover The World" with Luv' in the British Virgin Islands and filmed in the British Virgin Islands). Luv' also toured the club circuit in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Denmark. Less than one year later, the pop act disbanded and reunited again in 2005. 
The fact that Luv' Gold entered the album charts during eighteen weeks was a feat as Luv's previous album to reach the hit lists was Forever Yours that came out in November 1980. One of the reasons of the quiet good chart performance of this CD is because Patty, Marga and José were really involved in its promotion whereas they weren't for the past compilations. 
Luv' Gold is the first exhaustive singles collection of the trio as it includes hit singles from their entire heyday in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It features indeed songs from their Philips/Phonogram years (1977-1979) and their CNR/Carrere era (1979-1981).
