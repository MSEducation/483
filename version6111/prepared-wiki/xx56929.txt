[[Foras]]

CATEGORIES: Goetic demons

In demonology, Foras (alternatively Forcas or Forrasis) is a powerful President of Hell, being obeyed by twenty-nine legions of demons. He teaches logic and ethics in all their branches, the virtues of all herbs and precious stones, can make a man witty, eloquent, invisible (invincible according to some authors), and live long, and can discover treasures and recover lost things.
He is depicted as a strong man.
His name seems to derive from Latin foras (out, outside).
