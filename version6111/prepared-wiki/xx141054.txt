In mathematical logic, Lindström's theorem (named after Swedish logician Per Lindström, who published it in 1969) states that first-order logic is the strongest logic

Lindström's theorem is perhaps the best known result of what later became known as abstract model theory,[tpl]cite book|author1=Chen Chung Chang|author2=H.
