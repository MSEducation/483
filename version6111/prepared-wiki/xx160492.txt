==Service history==

HMS C24 was used in the first successful U-boat trap. She operated with the decoy trawler Taranaki. They were able to sink [tpl]ship|SM|U-40|Germany|2[/tpl] [tpl]convert|25|mi|km[/tpl] off Eyemouth in the North Sea on 23 June 1915.
The tactic was to use a decoy trawler to tow a submarine. When a U-boat was sighted, the tow line and communication line was slipped and the submarine would attack the U-boat. The tactic was partly successful, but was abandoned after the loss of two C class submarines. In both cases, all the crew were lost. 
HMS C24 was sold on 29 May 1921 in Sunderland.
