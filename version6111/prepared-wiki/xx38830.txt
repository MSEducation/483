Cromartyshire is a historic county in the Highlands of Scotland, comprising the medieval "old shire" around the county town of Cromarty and 22 exclaves transferred from Ross-shire in the late 17th century. The largest part, six times the size of the old shire, is Coigach, northwest from Ullapool. In 1890, Cromartyshire was merged with Ross-shire into the administrative county of Ross and Cromarty. In 1974 the county was combined with Caithness, Inverness-shire, Nairnshire, Sutherland, and parts of Argyllshire and Morayshire to form the Highland council area.

==History==

The medieval sheriffdom of Cromarty encompassed a single tract on the north of the Black Isle peninsula. The sheriffdom was hereditary in Clan Urquhart. It comprised the parish of Cromarty; most of the adjacent parish of Kirkmichael, excluding a portion at Balblair where a ferry crossed the Cromarty Firth to Invergordon; and a single farm in Cullicudden parish.  Ownership of the moor of Mulbuie was uncertain between Cromartyshire and Ross-shire.[tpl]cite book | title=The Imperial gazetteer of Scotland |volume=Vol.I |year=1854 |pages=322–3 |first=John Marius |last=Wilson |authorlink=John Marius Wilson |url=http://archive.org/stream/imperialgazettee01wils#page/322/mode/2up |accessdate=7 July 2013[/tpl]
Cromartyshire originally bordered Inverness-shire, but in 1504 Ross-shire was formed out of the nearest parts of Inverness-shire,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/A1504/3/105|title=Legislation: final legislation published outwith the parliamentary register|date=11 March 1504|work=Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707|publisher=University of St Andrews|accessdate=12 April 2013[/tpl] and its boundaries were fixed in 1661.Mackenzie 1810, pp.11–13[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1661/1/197|title=Act anent the shire of Ross|date=5 April 1661 |work=Records of the Parliaments of Scotland|publisher=University of St Andrews|accessdate=30 March 2013|location=Edinburgh[/tpl]  In 1662, Kirkmichael and Cullicudden parishes merged to form the parish of Resolis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/search/?action=do_search&p_type=PARISH&p_name=resolis&id=1209&p_county=ross_and_cromarty|title=Resolis Parish|work=ScotlandsPlaces|accessdate=28 March 2013[/tpl]
The feudal barony of Cromarty, whose appurtenant land was coterminous with the county, was purchased from the Urquharts in 1682 by the Mackenzies of Tarbat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/constituencies/cromartyshire|title=Cromartyshire 1690–1715 |last=Hayton|first=D.

In 1685 Sir George Mackenzie, recently made Viscount of Tarbat and later elevated to Earl of Cromarty, secured two Acts of the Parliament of Scotland transferring his lands in Easter Ross from Ross-shire to Cromartyshire.Mackenzie 1810, pp.15–16 These were enumerated as:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1685/4/66 |title=Act dissolving the barony of Tarbat from the shire of Ross|date=4 June 1685|work=Records of the Parliaments of Scotland|publisher=University of St Andrews|accessdate=30 March 2013|location=Edinburgh[/tpl]

Although this were repealed in 1686 on the grounds that some lands not belonging to Viscount Tarbat had been included,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1686/4/35 |title=Act rescinding a former act annexing lands in Ross-shire to Cromarty|date=14 June 1686|work=Records of the Parliaments of Scotland|publisher=University of St Andrews|accessdate=30 March 2013|location=Edinburgh[/tpl] it was re-enacted in 1690 to include only "the said barony of Tarbat and all other lands in Ross-shire belonging in property to the said viscount". The transfers increased the area and rateable value of Cromartyshire by respective factors of fifteen and three.
Cromartyshire was the smallest constituency in the Parliament of Scotland, with only five freeholders electing its two Commissioners in 1703. After the Act of Union 1707, Cromartyshire sent one MP to Westminster alternately with Nairnshire, a nearby small shire.  Only six of 19 votes on the register at the last election, in 1831, were found to be genuine freeholders.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/constituencies/cromartyshire |title=Cromartyshire 1820–1832|last=Fisher|first=David R. |year=2009|work=History of Parliament Online |accessdate=29 March 2013[/tpl]
The exclaves were for many purposes administered as part of Ross-shire rather than Cromartyshire.[tpl]cite book|author=Her Majesty’s Law Commissioners, Scotland|title=Fourth Report|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=onFbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA186|series=Command papers|volume=C 241|year=1839|page=186|chapter=Appendix; Return by John Jardine, Esq., Sheriff of Ross and Cromarty[/tpl]Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland, Vol.2 p.310–1, Cromartyshire 
After the Sheriffs (Scotland) Act 1747, Ross and Cromarty had a common sheriff.[tpl]cite book|last=Walker|first=David M.|title=A legal history of Scotland|accessdate=29 March 2013|volume=Vol.6|date=2001-12-01|publisher=W. Green|isbn=9780406948540|page=356[/tpl] 
In 1810, the militia was for Ross-shire in some exclaves and Cromartyshire in others.Mackenzie 1810, p.19 
The Scottish Reform Act 1832 merged Cromartyshire's constituency with Ross-shire's to form Ross and Cromarty, returning one MP to each Parliament. Police and ratings administration were merged similarly in the Victorian period.
Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland, Vol.6 p.615, Administration (H.A. Webster)
The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889 provided that "the counties of Ross and Cromarty shall cease to be separate counties, and shall be united for all purposes whatsoever, under the name of the county of Ross and Cromarty."

The 1881 index to the Ordnance Survey's first edition lists 22 detached parts, and the original "old shire", all of whose areas are given on the six-inch map.[tpl]cite journal|last=Adams|first=Brian|title=The scattered county of Cromartyshire|journal=Sheetlines|issue=29|pages=31–32|url=https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/charlesclose/Sh28-3.pdf[/tpl] The total measured area of Cromartyshire was 217321.186 acres, or [tpl]convert|339,.56|sqmi|sqkm[/tpl].Sum of the areas of the 23 parcels listed in the table.

Some places not included within Cromartyshire in the Ordnance Survey map are stated by earlier sources to have been within it. The 1859 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica asserts that Royston Park (now Caroline Park) outside Edinburgh, the city residence of the Viscount Tarbat, was also considered part of Cromartyshire. Nimmo's 1807 list includes:
