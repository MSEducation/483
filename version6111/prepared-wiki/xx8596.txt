Nicanor Parra Sandoval (born 5 September 1914) is a Chilean poet, mathematician, and physicist. He is considered an influential poet in Chile and throughout Latin America. Some rank him among the most important poets of Spanish language literature.Radio Universidad de Chile [tpl]es[/tpl] Parra describes himself as an "anti-poet," due to his distaste for standard poetic pomp and function; after recitations he exclaims "Me retracto de todo lo dicho" ("I take back everything I said").

==Life==

Parra, the son of a schoolteacher, was born in 1914 in San Fabián de Alico, Chile, near Chillán in southern Chile.[tpl]cite web|title=Nicanor Parra un antipoeta, matemático y físico|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/812957.html|work=EL UNIVERSAL|publisher=EL UNIVERSAL, Compañía Periodística Nacional|accessdate=21 June 2012|language=Spanish|date=1 December 2011[/tpl] He comes from the artistically prolific Parra family of performers, musicians, artists, and writers. His sister, Violeta Parra, was a folk singer, as was his brother Roberto Parra Sandoval.
In 1933, he entered the Instituto Pedagógico of the University of Chile, and qualified as a teacher of mathematics and physics in 1938, one year after his first book, Cancionero sin Nombre, appeared. After teaching in Chilean secondary schools, in 1943 he enrolled in Brown University in the United States to study physics. In 1948, he attended Oxford University to study cosmology.Los desconocidos años de Nicanor en Oxford, Qué Pasa (in Spanish), 05-08-2009 He returned to Chile as a professor at the Universidad de Chile in 1946. Since 1952, Parra has been professor of theoretical physics in Santiago and has read his poetry in England, France, Russia, Mexico, Cuba, and the United States. He has published several books.
Parra chooses to leave behind the conventions of poetry; his poetic language renounces the refinement of most Latin American literature and adopts a more colloquial tone. His first collection, Poemas y Antipoemas (1954) is a classic of Latin American literature, one of the most influential Spanish poetry collections of the twentieth century. It is cited as an inspiration by American Beat writers such as Allen Ginsberg.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2011/12/01/cervantes-prize-nicanor-parra.html | work=CBC News | title=Chilean poet Nicanor Parra wins Cervantes Prize | date=1 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Nicanor Parra Havana 1965|url=http://www.allenginsberg.org/index.php?page=nicanor-para-havana-1965|work=Allen Ginsberg Project|publisher=Allen Ginsberg Project|accessdate=21 June 2012[/tpl]
