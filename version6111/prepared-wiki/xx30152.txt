Søren Peder Lauritz Sørensen (9 January 1868 – 12 February 1939) was a  Danish chemist, famous for the introduction of the concept of pH, a scale for measuring acidity and basicity. He was born in Havrebjerg, Denmark.
From 1901 to 1938 he was head of the prestigious Carlsberg Laboratory, Copenhagen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.euchems.eu/nc/publications/100-distinguished-european-chemists/20th-century/soerensen-soren-peter-lauritz.html|title=Sørensen, Søren Peter Lauritz (1868-1939)|accessdate=2011-10-14|work=100 Distinguished European Chemists|publisher=European Association for Chemical and Molecular Sciences[/tpl] While working at the Carlsberg Laboratory he studied the effect of ion concentration on proteins,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/discover/chemistry-in-history/themes/electrochemistry/sorensen.aspx|title=Søren Sørenson|accessdate=2011-10-14|work=Chemical Achievers - The Human Face of the Chemical Science|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation[/tpl] and because the concentration of hydrogen ions was particularly important, he introduced the pH-scale as a simple way of expressing it in 1909.[tpl]cite book|last=Alberty|first=Robert|coauthors=Silbey, Robert|title=Physical Chemistry|edition=second|year=1996|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=0-471-10428-0|pages=244[/tpl] The article in which he introduced the scale (using the notation pH[tpl]cite journal|title=Enzymstudien.

He is also known for the Sørensen formol titration.
