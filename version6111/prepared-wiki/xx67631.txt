===Initial lawsuit===

Jones was initially represented by Gilbert Davis and Joseph Cammarata, two Washington, D.C.-area lawyers. Susan Carpenter-McMillan, a California conservative commentator, became her press spokesperson. Carpenter-McMillan wasted no time in using the press to attack Clinton to a much greater degree, calling him "un-American", a "liar", and a "philanderer" on Meet the Press, Crossfire, Equal Time, Larry King Live, Today, The Geraldo Rivera Show, Burden of Proof, Hannity & Colmes, TalkBack Live, and other shows. "I do not respect a man who cheats on his wife, and exposes his penis to a stranger", she said.[ref]

Judge Susan Webber Wright granted President Clinton's motion for summary judgment, ruling that Jones could not show that she had suffered any damages. As to the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, Wright ruled that Jones failed to show that Clinton's actions constituted "outrageous conduct" as required of the tort alongside not showing proof of damages caused by distress.[tpl]cite book|last=Goldberg|first=John C.

Clinton and his defense team then challenged Jones's right to bring a civil lawsuit against a sitting president for an incident that occurred prior to the defendant's becoming president. The Clinton defense team took the position that the trial should be delayed until the president was no longer in office, because the job of the president is unique and does not allow him to take time away from it to deal with a private civil lawsuit. The case went through the courts, eventually reaching the Supreme Court on January 13, 1997. On May 27, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled against Clinton, and allowed the lawsuit to proceed. Clinton dismissed Jones's story and agreed to move on with the lawsuit.[ref]

On August 29, 1997, Jones's attorneys Gilbert Davis and Joseph Cammarata asked to resign from the case believing the settlement offer they had secured, which Jones refused, was the appropriate way to end the case.[ref]
</ref> In September, Judge Wright accepted their request.<ref name="cvjtime" />
Jones was then represented by the Rutherford Institute, a conservative legal organization, and by a Dallas law firm. Carpenter-McMillan continued to serve as Jones's spokesperson. In December 1997, Jones reduced the damages sought in her suit against Clinton to $525,000 and agreed to remove Danny Ferguson from the suit.
On April 2, 1998, before the case could reach trial, Judge Susan Webber Wright granted President Clinton's motion for dismissal, ruling that Jones could not show that she had suffered any damages.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/02/clinton.jones.reax/ |title=Clinton Welcomes Jones Decision; Appeal Likely |date=April 2, 1998 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 11, 2011[/tpl]  Jones soon appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.[ref]

===Conclusion of case===

On November 13, 1998, Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000, the entire amount of her claim, but without an apology, in exchange for her agreement to drop the appeal. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's attorney, still maintained that Jones's claim was baseless and that Clinton only settled so he could end the lawsuit and move on with his life. In March 1999, Judge Wright ruled that Jones would only get $200,000 from the settlement and that the rest of the money would pay for her legal expenses.[tpl]cite news | title=Paula Jones to Get $200,000 of Settlement | date=March 5, 1999  | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1999/03/05/MN39352.DTL  | work =San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate = 2012-04-11 | first=Baltimore | last=Sun[/tpl]

In April 1999, Judge Wright found Clinton in civil contempt of court for misleading testimony in the Jones case. She ordered Clinton to pay $1,202 to the court and an additional $90,000 to Jones's lawyers for expenses incurred,[tpl]cite news | first=Bob | last=Franken | title=Clinton Found in Civil Contempt for Jones Testimony | date=1999-04-12 | url =http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/04/12/clinton.contempt/ | work =CNN | accessdate = 2007-09-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070620120650/http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/04/12/clinton.contempt/  |archivedate = 2007-06-20[/tpl][ref]Clinton Cited for Contempt

Wright then referred Clinton's conduct to the Arkansas Bar for disciplinary action, and on January 19, 2001, the day before Clinton left the office of president, he entered into an agreement with the Arkansas Bar and Independent Counsel Robert Ray under which Clinton was stripped of his license to practice law in Arkansas for a period of five years.[ref]

===Lewinsky scandal connection===

Jones's lawyers decided to show to the court a pattern of behavior by Clinton that involved his allegedly repeatedly becoming sexually involved with state or government employees. Jones's lawyers therefore subpoenaed women they suspected Clinton had had affairs with, one of whom was Monica Lewinsky. In his deposition for the Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied having "sexual relations" with Monica Lewinsky. Based on testimony provided by Linda Tripp, which identified the existence of a blue dress with Clinton's semen on it, Kenneth Starr concluded that this sworn testimony was false and perjurious.
During the deposition in the Jones case, Clinton was asked, "Have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1, as modified by the Court?" The judge ordered that Clinton be given an opportunity to review the definition. It said that "a person engages in sexual relations when the person knowingly engages in or causes contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person".[ref]
