[[File:2011 tamil nadu legislative margin wise election map by districts.png|thumb|left|Election map based on Vote % margin difference between AIADMK+ candidates and DMK+ candidates by district. The % margin for each color are as follows:

Pre-polls and post-polls released before the counting showed a mixed picture and a close race and failed to predict the landslide victory for the AIADMK alliance. Including this election, no incumbent party has ever won a re-election in Tamil Nadu since MGR's victory in 1984 election. The results were consistent with the anti-incumbency factor that is common in Tamil Nadu politics. Closer look at the results show that AIADMK swept through the state winning by big margins. AIADMK and its allies won all the seats in 12 out of the 32 districts, with margins greater than 10% over its rival DMK and its allies. Out of those 12 districts, AIADMK+ won by margins greater than 15% in seven of them. In Chennai District, which once used to be a DMK bastion, AIADMK+ won 14 out of 16 constituencies with a margin of 13.1% over DMK+. In northern Tamil Nadu which is considered to be DMK's traditional bastion, DMK and its allies just won 4 out of 62 constituencies.[tpl]cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/assembly-elections-2011/tamil-nadu/Sun-sets-in-DMK-strongholds-in-Northern-TN/articleshow/8327845.cms| title=Sun sets in DMK strongholds in Northern TN| work=The Times of India| date=15 May 2011| accessdate=26 December 2011[/tpl] DMK members blamed that the alliance with caste based Pattali Makkal Katchi and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi didn't go well with other castes and caused their downfall.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.thinakaran.lk/2011/06/21/?fn=i1106211| title=Repair the alliance| publisher=Thinakaran| date=21 June 2011| accessdate=26 December 2011[/tpl] Analysts felt that the strife between Vanniyars and Dalits could have played a role in DMK+ debacle in northern region.[tpl]cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/specials/assembly-elections-2011/tamil-nadu/DMDKs-big-gains-at-PMK-VCK-expense/articleshow/8310087.cms| title=DMDKâ€™s big gains at PMK, VCK expense| work=The Times of India| date=14 May 2011| accessdate=26 December 2011[/tpl] AIADMK's best district was the newly created Tiruppur, where they beat the DMK and its allies by a margin of 29.4%. This is consistent with the continued support for AIADMK in this region, since the former Coimbatore district was AIADMK's best performance in 2006 election. AIADMK+, did extremely well in its traditional stronghold in western Tamil Nadu. DMK, weak in this region, relied on its ally, Kongunadu Munnetra Kazhagam, who had a disappointing performance in this region losing by margins greater than 20% to AIADMK+. The western region was already affected with major issues like power cuts, agricultural crisis and industrial pollution and the DMK members after the election admitted that family rule could be one of the reasons for their downfall. DMK leaders after the election blamed the alienation of Dalits and other castes by KNMK due to the fact it is viewed as a party of Gounders.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/05/15/stories/2011051562020300.htm| title=Western belt still AIADMK bastion| publisher=Hindu Newspaper| date=15 May 2011| accessdate=25 June 2011[/tpl] DMK+, on the hand, only did better than its opponent in four districts: Nilgiris, Kanniyakumari, Thiruvarur and Perambalur, all traditional DMK strongholds. The only region, DMK+ was able to be competitive is in the Cauvery delta region, which has long been a DMK stronghold. DMK's best district was Nilgiris, which includes A. Raja's former MP constituency. DMK+ did poorly in the Madurai district, where they found a lot of success in recent years (2006 by-election & 2009 LS election), due to Azhagiri's vigorous campaigning. They were not able to win a single seat in this district, and lost by a margin of 20.9% to AIADMK-CPI(M)-DMDK combine.
Post-poll data released by CNN-IBN, showed that DMK+ did the worst amongst the poor, especially in rural areas. Major issue cited by them as a reason for voting against the DMK is supply of electricity.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.manoramaonline.com/advt/Specials/PostPoll-English/Tamilnadu.htm| title=Tamil Nadu - Post Poll 2011| publisher=Manorama Online| date=10 May 2011| accessdate=24 June 2011[/tpl] Before the election, DMK was hoping that freebies and welfare schemes implemented by their administration would help them gain support from rural voters, who were an important electorate for the DMK to grab power in the previous election. This failed to take place, since many rural voters were unhappy with the distribution of these freebies in a disproportionate manner and lack of policies targeting towards income generation schemes in rural areas. This coupled with the recent food price rises resulted in a decline in rural support for the DMK.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/04/07/stories/2011040760960800.htm| title=Rural voters irked over discrepancies in distribution of freebies | work=The Hindu| date=7 April 2011| accessdate=26 June 2011[/tpl] While spiraling prices, power cut, and DMK's family politics were important factors, many analysts agree that it was the corruption charges (2G spectrum scandal), that eventually led them to their ultimate defeat. This election saw one of the worst performance of Congress in Tamil Nadu, bagging only 5 seats out of 63 seats it contested. During the campaign, they were marred with in-fighting between state Congress leader K.V. Thangkabalu and other Congress members, which added to their declining support in the state.[tpl]cite news | url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/tamil-nadu-polls-dmk-leading-in-one-seat/152148-37.html| title=Tamil Nadu polls DMK leading in one seat| publisher=CNN-IBN| date=13 May 2011| accessdate=13 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://ibnlive.in.com/election2011/blogs/3421/62289/tamil-nadu.html| title= The dramatic battle for Tamil Nadu| publisher=CNN-IBN| date=13 May 2011| accessdate=13 May 2011[/tpl] In both Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry, Congress did poorly reflecting widespread anger and disapproval.
