CATEGORIES: Newspapers published in the British Virgin Islands

The Standpoint is a newspaper published in the British Virgin Islands.  It was originally published under the name Pennysaver, largely as a shopping-coupon promotional newspaper, but since emerged as one of the most influential sources of journalism in the Territory.
It is published weekly on Tuesdays.

==Motto==

The newspaper's motto (published on its front page every week) is "If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything."  The motto clearly adds a poignancy to the newspaper's name, and is derived from quotes variously attributed the American clergyman, Peter Marshall,"...unless we stand for something, we shall fall for anything." and to the British journalist, Alex Hamilton (and frequently mis-attributed to American politician Alexander Hamilton),"Those who stand for nothing fall for anything." but latterly popularised by Ginger Rogers."You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything"
