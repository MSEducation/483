Amongst most orders of insects, mutualism is not common, but some examples occur in species of Coleoptera, such as the ambrosia beetle, the ambrosia fungus, and probably bacteria. The beetles excavate tunnels in dead trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition. After landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery, so the weevils and the fungus both benefit. The beetles cannot eat the wood due to toxins, and uses its relationship with fungi to help overcome its host tree defenses and to provide nutrition for their larvae.Malloch, D. and Blackwell, M.

===Commensalism===

Pseudoscorpions are small arachnids with flat, pear-shaped bodies and pincers that resemble those of scorpions (only distant relatives), usually ranging from [tpl]convert|2|to|8|mm|2|in[/tpl] in length.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/pseudoscorpion.htm|title=Pseudoscorpions|year=2011|work=Insect Advice from Extension|publisher=College of Agricultural Sciences|accessdate=March 13, 2011[/tpl] Their small size allows them to hitch rides under the elytra of giant harlequin beetles to be dispersed over wide areas while simultaneously being protected from predators. They may also find mating partners as other individuals join them on the beetle. This would be a form of parasitism if the beetle were  harmed in the process, but the beetle is, presumably, unaffected by the presence of the hitchhikers.[tpl]cite journal|first=Vines|last=Gail|title=Hitchhiking pseudoscorpions take beetles for a ride|journal=New Scientist|date=April 18, 1992|issue=1817|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13418173.500--science-hitchhiking-pseudoscorpions-take-beetles-for-a-ride-.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nearctica.com/ecology/pops/commens.htm#pseudoscorpion|title=Ecology – Population Ecology – Commensalism|first=Robert W.|last=Poole|year=2004|work=Nearctica|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101212161628/http://www.nearctica.com/ecology/pops/commens.htm#pseudoscorpion|archivedate=December 12, 2010[/tpl]

A large number of important fossil sites worldwide contain beetles from the Cretaceous. Most are located in Europe and Asia and belong to the temperate climate zone during the Cretaceous. A few of the fossil sites mentioned in the chapter Jurassic also shed some light on the early Cretaceous beetle fauna (for example, the Yixian formation in Liaoning, North China). Further important sites from the Lower Cretaceous include the Crato fossil beds in the Araripe basin in the Ceará, North Brazil, as well as overlying Santana formation, with the latter was situated near the paleoequator, or the position of the earth's equator in the geologic past as defined for a specific geologic period. In Spain, important sites are located near Montsec and Las Hoyas. In Australia, the Koonwarra fossil beds of the Korumburra group, South Gippsland, Victoria, are noteworthy. Important fossil sites from the Upper Cretaceous include Kzyl-Dzhar in South Kazakhstan and Arkagala in Russia.

===Evolution===

The oldest known insect that resembles species of Coleoptera date back to the Lower Permian (270 mya), though they instead have 13-segmented antennae, elytra with more fully developed venation and more irregular longitudinal ribbing, and an abdomen and ovipositor extending beyond the apex of the elytra.  At the end of the Permian, the biggest mass extinction in history took place, collectively called the Permian–Triassic extinction event (P-Tr): 30% of all insect species became extinct; however, it is the only mass extinction of insects in Earth's history until today.
Due to the P-Tr extinction, the fossil record of insects only includes beetles from the Lower Triassic ([tpl]Ma|220[/tpl]). Around this time, during the Late Triassic, mycetophagous, or fungus-feeding species (e.g. Cupedidae) appear in the fossil record. In the stages of the Upper Triassic, representatives of the algophagous, or algae-feeding species (e.g. Triaplidae and Hydrophilidae) begin to appear, as well as predatory water beetles. The first primitive weevils appear (e.g. Obrienidae), as well as the first representatives of the rove beetles (e.g. Staphylinidae), which show no marked difference in morphology compared to recent species.
During the Jurassic ([tpl]Ma|210|145[/tpl]), a dramatic increase in the known diversity of family-level Coleoptera occurred, including the development and growth of carnivorous and herbivorous species. Species of the superfamily Chrysomeloidea are believed to have developed around the same time, which include a wide array of plant hosts ranging from cycads and conifers, to angiosperms.Powell (2009), p. 186 Close to the Upper Jurassic, the portion of the Cupedidae decreased, but at the same time the diversity of the early plant-eating, or phytophagous species increased. Most of the recent phytophagous species of Coleoptera feed on flowering plants or angiosperms. The increase in diversity of the angiosperms is also believed to have influenced the diversity of the phytophagous species, which doubled during the Middle Jurassic. However,  doubts have been raised recently, since the increase of the number of beetle families during the Cretaceous does not correlate with the increase of the number of angiosperm species.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Labandeira|first1=C.

The Cretaceous included the initiation of the most recent round of southern landmass fragmentation, via the opening of the southern Atlantic ocean and the isolation of New Zealand, while South America, Antarctica, and Australia grew more distant. During the Cretaceous, the diversity of Cupedidae and Archostemata decreased considerably. Predatory ground beetles (Carabidae) and rove beetles (Staphylinidae) began to distribute into different patterns; whereas the Carabidae predominantly occurred in the warm regions, the Staphylinidae and click beetles (Elateridae) preferred many areas with temperate climates. Likewise, predatory species of Cleroidea and Cucujoidea hunted their prey under the bark of trees together with the jewel beetles (Buprestidae). The jewel beetles' diversity increased rapidly during the Cretaceous, as they were the primary consumers of wood,[tpl]cite journal|title=New Jewel Beetles (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) from the Cretaceous of Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia|journal=Paleontological Journal|year=2009|issue=43|pages=277–281|url=http://fossilinsects.net/pdfs/Alexeev_2009_PalJ_BuprestidaeCretaceousRussiaKazakhstanMongolia.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] while longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) were rather rare, and their diversity increased only towards the end of the Upper Cretaceous.

Whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae) were moderately diverse, although other early beetles (e.g. Dytiscidae) were less, with the most widespread being the species of Coptoclavidae, which preyed on aquatic fly larvae.
Between the Paleogene and the Neogene is when today's beetles developed. During this time, the continents began to be located closer to where they are today. Around [tpl]Ma|5[/tpl], the land bridge between South America and North America was formed, and the fauna exchange between Asia and North America started. Though many recent genera and species already existed during the Miocene, their distribution differed considerably from today's.

===Phylogeny===

The suborders diverged in the Permian and Triassic. Their phylogenetic relationship is uncertain, with the most popular hypothesis being that Polyphaga and Myxophaga are most closely related, with Adephaga as the sister group to those two, and Archostemata as sister to the other three collectively.[tpl]cite journal|title=Phylogenetic relationships of the suborders of Coleoptera (Insecta)|journal=Cladistics|first=R.|last=Beutel|author2=Haas, F. |volume=16|pages=103–141|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2000.tb00350.x|year=2000[/tpl] Although six other competing hypotheses are noted, the other most widely discussed one has Myxophaga as the sister group of all remaining beetles rather than just of Polyphaga.[tpl]cite journal|title=Evolution of the hind wing in Coleoptera|journal=Canadian Entomologist|year=1993|last=Kukalová-Peck|first=J.|author2=Lawrence, J. F. |volume=125|issue=2|pages=181–258|doi=10.4039/Ent125181-2[/tpl] Evidence for a close relationship of the two suborders, Polyphaga and Myxophaga, includes the shared reduction in the number of larval leg articles. The Adephaga are further considered as sister to Myxophaga and Polyphaga, based on their completely sclerotized elytra, reduced number of crossveins in the hind wings, and the folded (as opposed to rolled) hind wings of those three suborders.
Recent cladistic analysis of some of the structural characteristics supports the Polyphaga and Myxophaga hypothesis. The membership of the clade Coleoptera is not in dispute, with the exception of the twisted-wing parasites, Strepsiptera. These odd insects have been regarded as related to the beetle families Rhipiphoridae and Meloidae, with which they share first-instar larvae that are active, host-seeking triungulins and later-instar larvae that are endoparasites of other insects, or the sister group of beetles, or more distantly related to insects.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tolweb.org/coleoptera|title=Coleoptera.

===Taxonomy===

About 450,000 species of beetles occur – representing about 40% of all known insects. Such a large number of species poses special problems for classification, with some families consisting of thousands of species and needing further division into subfamilies and tribes. This immense number of species allegedly led evolutionary biologist J. B. S. Haldane to quip, when some theologians asked him what could be inferred about the mind of the Creator from the works of His Creation, that God displayed "an inordinate fondness for beetles".[tpl]cite journal |author=Hutchinson, G.

==Beetles in relation to people==

===Beetles as pests===

About 75% of beetle species are phytophagous in both the larval and adult stages, living in or on plants, wood, fungi, and a variety of stored products, including cereals, tobacco, and dried fruits. Because many of these plants are important for agriculture, forestry, and the household, beetles can be considered pests. Some of these species cause significant damage, such as the boll weevil, which feeds on cotton buds and flowers. The boll weevil crossed the Rio Grande near Brownsville, Texas, to enter the United States from Mexico around 1892, and had reached southeastern Alabama by 1915. By the mid-1920s, it had entered all cotton-growing regions in the US, traveling [tpl]convert|40|to-|160|mi|-1[/tpl] per year. It remains the most destructive cotton pest in North America. Mississippi State University has estimated, since the boll weevil entered the United States, it has cost cotton producers about $13 billion, and in recent times about $300 million per year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bollweevil.ext.msstate.edu/webpage_history.htm|work=Economic impacts of the boll weevil|title=History of the Boll Weevil in the United States|author=Mississippi State University|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080512023346/http://www.bollweevil.ext.msstate.edu/webpage_history.htm|archivedate=May 12, 2008[/tpl] Many other species also have done extensive damage to plant populations, such as the bark beetle and elm leaf beetle. The bark beetle and elm leaf beetle, among other species, have been known to nest in elm trees. Bark beetles in particular carry Dutch elm disease as they move from infected breeding sites to feed on healthy elm trees. The spread of Dutch elm disease by the beetle has led to the devastation of elm trees in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere, notably in Europe and North America.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cisr.ucr.edu/elm_leaf_beetle.html|title=Elm Leaf Beetle|publisher=University of California|date=May 11, 2011|accessdate=July 17, 2011[/tpl]
Situations in which a species has developed immunity to pesticides are worse, as in the case of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, which is a notorious pest of potato plants. Crops are destroyed and the beetle can only be treated by employing expensive pesticides, to many of which it has begun to develop resistance. Suitable hosts can include a number of plants from the potato family (Solanaceae), such as nightshade, tomato, eggplant and capsicum, as well as potatoes. The Colorado potato beetle has developed resistance to all major insecticide classes, although not every population is resistant to every chemical.[tpl]cite journal|author=A. Alyokhin, M. Baker, D.

Pests do not only affect agriculture, but can also even affect houses, such as the death watch beetle. The death watch beetle, Xestobium rufovillosum (family Anobiidae), is of considerable importance as a pest of older wooden buildings in Great Britain. It attacks hardwoods such as oak and chestnut, always where some fungal decay has taken or is taking place. The actual introduction of the pest into buildings is thought to take place at the time of construction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/preservation/training/pests/watch.htm|title=Pests – Death watch beelte| publisher=University of Oxford|work=Conservation and collective care|year=2005|accessdate=July 17, 2011|author=Adcock, Edward| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110710144935/http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/preservation/training/pests/watch.htm| archivedate= July 10, 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Other pest include the coconut hispine beetle, Brontispa longissima, which feeds on young leaves and damages seedlings and mature coconut palms. On September 27, 2007, Philippines' Metro Manila and 26 provinces were quarantined due to having been infested with this pest (to save the $800-million Philippine coconut industry).[tpl]cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=91109|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|title=Beetles infest coconuts in Manila, 26 provinces|author=Remo, Amy R. |date=September 27, 2007[/tpl] The mountain pine beetle normally attacks mature or weakened lodgepole pine.

===Beetles as beneficial resources===

Beetles are not only pests, but can also be beneficial, usually by controlling the populations of pests. One of the best, and widely known, examples are the ladybugs or ladybirds (family Coccinellidae). Both the larvae and adults are found feeding on aphid colonies. Other ladybugs feed on scale insects and mealybugs. If normal food sources are scarce, they may feed on  small caterpillars, young plant bugs, or honeydew and nectar.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/3715120.stm|title='Deadly ladybird' sighted in UK|date=October 5, 2004|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=June 17, 2010[/tpl] Ground beetles (family Carabidae) are common predators of many different insects and other arthropods, including fly eggs, caterpillars, wireworms, and others.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kromp, B. |year=1999|title=Carabid beetles in sustainable agriculture: a review on pest control efficacy, cultivation aspects and enhancement|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment|volume=74|issue=1–3|pages=187–228|doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(99)00037-7[/tpl]
Dung beetles (Scarabidae) have been successfully used to reduce the populations of pestilent flies and parasitic worms that breed in cattle dung. The beetles make the dung unavailable to breeding pests by quickly rolling and burying it in the soil, with the added effect of improving soil fertility, tilth, and nutrient cycling. The Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), led by Dr. George Bornemissza of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, introduced species of dung beetle to Australia from South Africa and Europe, and effectively reduced the bush fly (Musca vetustissima) population by 90%.
Dung beetles play a remarkable role in agriculture. By burying and consuming dung, they improve nutrient recycling and soil structure.[tpl]cite journal|author=Brown, Jacqueline; Scholtz, Clarke H.; Janeau, Jean-Louis; Grellier, Seraphine and Podwojewski, Pascal |year=2010|title=Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) can improve soil hydrological properties|journal=Applied Soil Ecology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=9–16|doi=10.1016/j.apsoil.2010.05.010[/tpl] They also protect livestock, such as cattle, by removing dung, which, if left, could provide habitat for pests such as flies. Therefore, many countries have introduced the creatures for the benefit of animal husbandry. In developing countries, the beetle is especially important as an adjunct for improving standards of hygiene. The American Institute of Biological Sciences reports that dung beetles save the United States cattle industry an estimated US$380 million annually through burying above-ground livestock feces.[tpl]cite journal|author=John E.

Some beetles help in a professional setting, doing things that people cannot; those of the family Dermestidae are often used in taxidermy and preparation of scientific specimens to clean bones of remaining soft tissue. The beetle larvae are used to clean skulls because they do a thorough job of cleaning, and do not leave the tool marks that taxidermists' tools do. Another benefit is, with no traces of meat remaining and no emulsified fats in the bones, the trophy will not develop the unpleasant dead odor. Using the beetle larvae means that all cartilage is removed along with the flesh, leaving the bones spotless.[tpl]cite book|editor=Huffman, Jane E. and Wallace, John R. |year=2012|title=Wildlife Forensics: Methods and Applications|volume=6|series=Developments in Forensic Science|edition=2nd|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781119954293|chapter=Forensic entomology and wildlife|author=Tomberlin, Jeffery K. and Sanford, Michelle R. |pages=81–107|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EstjD_GgFvQC&pg=PT123 [/tpl]

===Beetles as human food===

Insects are used as human food in 80% of the world's nations.Carrington, Damian (August 1, 2010) "Insects could be the key to meeting food needs of growing global population", The Guardian. Retrieved February 27, 2011. Beetles are the most widely eaten insects. About 344 species are known to be used as food, usually eaten in the larval stage.[tpl]cite book|title=Creepy crawly cuisine: the gourmet guide to edible insects|last=Ramos-Elorduy|first=Julieta|author2=Menzel, Peter|year=1998|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear & Company|isbn=978-0-89281-747-4|page=5|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Q7f1LkFz11gC[/tpl] The mealworm is the most commonly eaten beetle species. The larvae of the darkling beetle and the rhinoceros beetle are also commonly eaten.

===Beetles in art===

Many beetles have beautiful and durable elytra that have been used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example.Life cycle of the rounded jewel beetles, Sternocera spp. วงจรชีวิตของแมลงทับกลมใช้เวลานานถึง 2 ปี – Siam Insect Zoo-Museum. Malaeng.com (2008-10-20). Retrieved on 2013-04-04. Sometimes, they are also incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased in clear plastic, are also made into objects varying from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewelry. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.[tpl]cite book|chapter=105.

===Beetles in ancient cultures===

Many beetles were prominent in ancient cultures.Cambefort, Yves. Beetles as religious symbols. insects.org Of these, the most prominent might be the dung beetle in Ancient Egypt. Several species of dung beetle, most notably the species Scarabaeus sacer (often referred to as the sacred scarab), enjoyed a sacred status among the ancient Egyptians.[tpl]cite book|title=Beetles|publisher=Michelle Bison|author=Zabludoff, Marc|year=2008|location=Malaysia|pages=14–17|isbn=978-0-7614-2532-8[/tpl] Popular interpretation in modern academia theorizes the hieroglyphic image of the beetle represents a triliteral phonetic that Egyptologists transliterate as xpr or ḫpr and translate as "to come into being", "to become", or "to transform". The derivative term xprw or ḫpr(w) is variously translated as "form", "transformation", "happening", "mode of being", or "what has come into being", depending on the context. It may have existential, fictional, or ontologic significance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/bestiary/insects.htm|title=Ancient Egyptian bestiary: Insects |date = January 2002| accessdate=July 19, 2011|author=Dollinger, André[/tpl]
The scarab was linked to Khepri ("he who has come into being"), the god of the rising sun. The ancients believed the dung beetle was only male in gender, and reproduced by depositing semen into a dung ball. The supposed self-creation of the beetle resembles that of Khepri, who created himself out of nothing. Moreover, the dung ball rolled by a dung beetle resembles the sun. Plutarch wrote: [tpl]Quotation|The race of beetles has no female, but all the males eject their sperm into a round pellet of material which they roll up by pushing it from the opposite side, just as the sun seems to turn the heavens in the direction opposite to its own course, which is from west to east."Isis and Osiris", Moralia, in volume V of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1936, now in the public domain. Retrieved on 2007-08-02.[/tpl]
The ancient Egyptians believed Khepri renewed the sun every day before rolling it above the horizon, then carried it through the other world after sunset, only to renew it, again, the next day. Some New Kingdom royal tombs exhibit a threefold image of the sun god, with the beetle as symbol of the morning sun. The astronomical ceiling in the tomb of Ramses VI portrays the nightly "death" and "rebirth" of the sun as being swallowed by Nut, goddess of the sky, and re-emerging from her womb as Khepri.
Excavations of ancient Egyptian sites have yielded images of the scarab in bone, ivory, stone, Egyptian faience, and precious metals, dating from the Sixth Dynasty and up to the period of Roman rule. They are generally small, bored to allow stringing on a necklace, and the base bears a brief inscription or cartouche. Some have been used as seals. Pharaohs sometimes commissioned the manufacture of larger images with lengthy inscriptions, such as the commemorative scarab of Queen Tiye. Massive sculptures of scarabs can be seen at Luxor Temple, at the Serapeum in Alexandria (see Serapis) and elsewhere in Egypt.
The scarab was of prime significance in the funerary cult of ancient Egypt.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.all-about-egypt.com/egyptian-symbols.html|title=Egyptian Symbols|publisher=All-About-Egypt|year=2006|accessdate=July 19, 2011|author=Morales-Correa, Ben[/tpl] Scarabs, generally, though not always, were cut from green stone, and placed on the chest of the deceased. Perhaps the most famous example of such "heart scarabs" is the yellow-green pectoral scarab found among the entombed provisions of Tutankhamen. It was carved from a large piece of Libyan desert glass. The purpose of the "heart scarab" was to ensure the heart would not bear witness against the deceased at judgement in the Afterlife. Other possibilities are suggested by the "transformation spells" of the Coffin Texts, which affirm that the soul of the deceased may transform (xpr) into a human being, a god, or a bird and reappear in the world of the living.
In contrast to funerary contexts, some of ancient Egypt's neighbors adopted the scarab motif for seals of varying types. The best-known of these are the Judean LMLK seals (eight of 21 designs contained scarab beetles), which were used exclusively to stamp impressions on storage jars during the reign of Hezekiah. The scarab remains an item of popular interest due to modern fascination with the art and beliefs of ancient Egypt. Scarab beads in semiprecious stones or glazed ceramics can be purchased at most bead shops, while at Luxor Temple, a massive ancient scarab has been roped off to discourage visitors from rubbing the base of the statue "for luck".

===Beetles in modern cultures===

Beetles still play roles in modern culture. One example is in insect fighting for entertainment and gambling. This sport exploits the territorial behavior and mating competition of certain species of large beetles. Enthusiasts collect and raise various species of insects for fighting. Among beetles, the most popular are large species of stag beetles, rhinoceros beetles, kabutomushi, and goliath beetles.
The study of beetles is called coleopterology (from Coleoptera, see above, and Greek [tpl]lang|grc|-λογία[/tpl], -logia), and its practitioners are coleopterists. Coleopterists have formed organizations to facilitate the study of beetles. Among these is The Coleopterists Society, an international organization based in the United States. Such organizations may have both professionals and amateurs as members, interested in beetles. Research in this field is often published in peer-reviewed journals specific to the field of coleopterology, though journals dealing with general entomology also publish many papers on various aspects of beetle biology. Some of the journals specific to beetle research are:
