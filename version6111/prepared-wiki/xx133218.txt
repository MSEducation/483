[[Cavares]]

CATEGORIES: Tribes of ancient Gaul

The Cavares were a Gallic tribe, or a federation of tribes, located in the lower Rhone valley. Their strongholds were Avignon (Avennio), Orange (Arausio) and Cavaillon (Cabellio). Their closest neighbours were the Segallauni, the Tricastini, the Salyes, the Albici (or Albioeci) and the Vocontii.Ptolemy, Geography, Book II, Chapter 9, Location of Narbonensis Gallia (Third Map of Europe).

==Etymology==

Cauares is believed to be a Gaulish ethnic name meaning "Heroes, Champions"; it is likely related to Old Irish caur "hero, champion warrior" and Welsh cawr, "giant, hero".Delamarre, Xavier, Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise, 3rd ed., Éditions Errance, 2002, p. 112.

==Archaeology==

The Tarasque de Noves anthropophagous statue, displayed in the Musée Calvet in Avignon, is attributed to the Cavares.
