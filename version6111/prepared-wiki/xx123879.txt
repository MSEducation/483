==History==

The team was formerly known as the Blue Haven Rhinos after the Blue Haven Pools company, whose sponsorship ended prior to the 2007 season. The Rhinos (along with the Brisbane Blue Tongues) were part of a two-team expansion to the AIHL in 2005 that saw the league grow to eight teams.  While the Rhinos gained a healthy fan following in their inaugural season, on the ice the team was not successful and finished in last place, winning just 6 out of 26 regular season games.
The Rhinos left the AIHL before the start of the 2009 season after refusing to accept the AIHL's new licensing model and went on to join the newly formed Australian International Ice Hockey Cup.[tpl]cite web | url=http://theotherhewitt.com/?p=1022 | title=10 – The magic number | publisher=The Other Hewitt | date=2011-11-29 | accessdate=2011-12-18 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6417DBxAy |archivedate=2011-12-18 |deadurl=no[/tpl] The Rhinos finished first in the inaugural tournament however lost to the Canadian Maples in the final. They again finished runners up in the two following years and in 2012 failed to qualify for the final after losing all four of their games.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.australianicehockeycup.com.au/content.aspx?cid=6 | title = News | publisher = Australian International Ice Hockey Cup | date = | accessdate = 2010-04-08 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5opbrtra3 |archivedate=2010-04-08 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.rhinos.com.au/news.php?a=details&id=155 | title = Rhinos Brilliant | publisher = Central Coast Rhinos | date = | accessdate = 2011-01-19 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vr54Y3VC |archivedate=2010-01-19 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.australianicehockeycup.com.au/ | title=2011 Australian International Ice Hockey Cup | publisher=Australian International Ice Hockey Cup | date= | accessdate=2011-08-07 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60kZ707J1 |archivedate=2011-08-07 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.australianicehockeycup.com.au/index.html | title=2012 Australian International Ice Hockey Cup | publisher=Australian International Ice Hockey Cup | date= | accessdate=2012-09-06 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ASmlw4Rj |archivedate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=no[/tpl] In 2013 the team was dropped from the Australian International Ice Hockey Cup in favour of a Canada versus United States style tournament.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.australianicehockeycup.com.au/ | title=Australian International Ice Hockey Cup | publisher=Australian International Ice Hockey Cup | date=2013-10-08 | accessdate=2013-10-08 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6KCuhXibw |archivedate=2013-10-08 |deadurl=no[/tpl] In November 2013 the team returned to play an exhibition game against the Sydney Bears which they went on to win 8–4.
