==Early career==

After graduating from the Pittsburgh Technical Institute in 2004, Ezarik landed several jobs in graphic design and video editing before starting her own business.

She played a photojournalist covering a bank robbery in downtown Pittsburgh on the television series The Kill Point from Spike TV, which starred John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg, filmed in May 2007.

When the iPhone debuted in June 2007, Ezarik covered the device's debut at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota a suburb south of Minneapolis, Minnesota.

==300-page iPhone bill==

In August 2007, she created the "300-page iPhone bill" Video and uploaded it to the video sharing site YouTube, where the video quickly became an Internet meme. She also uploaded it to some other video sharing sites. Stories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press after the Apple iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release, but this video clip brought the voluminous bills to the attention of the mass media. Ten days after its initial posting, the video had been viewed more than 2 million times on the Internet, and had received international news coverage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/tribpm/s_522522.html|title=The blog is on - Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|accessdate=2007-08-19|last=Lyons|first=Kim|date=2007-08-16|work=Pittsburgh Tribune Review|publisher=Tribune-Review Publishing Co|quote=Ezarik, 23, of Carnegie, made national news yesterday with a video of her flipping through her 300-page bill from AT&T – mailed in a box – for her new iPhone.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,136068/article.html|title= A 300-page iPhone Bill? : iPhone owners rail at AT&T for paper waste with overly detailed bills|accessdate=2007-08-19|last=Keizer|first=Gregg|date=2007-08-16|work=Computerworld|publisher= PC World Communications|quote=One blogger, in fact, is in the middle of her 15 minutes of fame after posting a video that shows her unwrapping a 300-page AT&T bill.[/tpl] The video was later reported to have reached over 8 million total views as of December 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/12/online_fame_easy_ads_harder_to.php |title=Online Fame Easy; Ads Harder to Get |accessdate=2007-12-15 |author= Whitney, Daisey |date=2007-12-08 |work=TV Week |quote=...a video about her 300-page iPhone bill rocketed to 8 million views across YouTube, MySpace, Yahoo and Revver.[/tpl] The video earned Ezarik a $5,000 payout from the video hosting service Revver.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2007-09-13-revver_N.htm | title = Posters reap cash rewards at video-sharing site Revver  | accessdate = 2007-09-13 | date = 2007-09-12 | author =  Graham, Jefferson | work =USA Today [/tpl]

==Viral video career and Internet celebrity status==

Ezarik was also featured in the August 28, 2007, weekly installment of Kevin Sites' People of the Web series on Yahoo! News along with Justin Kan, the creator of Justin.TV. Sites called her "the star of this network so far," and said "she has model good looks and easy cyber savvyness that attracts both technophiles and casual users alike." The final cut of the interview video included footage from the live web cast of the interview that showed Ezarik's webcam viewpoint. When Sites asked her to turn off her lifecasting equipment later in the interview, he noted that "at once the conversation seemed more relaxed and natural," and she discussed the difficulty of having people watching and publicly judging her all day.[tpl]cite web | url = http://potw.news.yahoo.com/s/potw/40075/the-real-reality-tv | title = The Real Reality TV : Meet Justine Ezarik and Justin Kan.

In early September 2007, she was featured as the lead story on the Yahoo! homepage, which boosted her ratings up to as high as 4000 viewers at any given moment. As of late September 2007, she was living in Pittsburgh and held a position as spokesperson for Pittsburgh Councilman Bill Peduto.  She also landed a job with Xtrain, which was a firm that specializes in new media expert training. Although her father remained supportive, her friends were beginning to tire of the intrusive nature of her activities by the end of 2007. In October 2007, she was described as one of the web's most popular lifecasters in Tribune Company affiliates such as the Chicago Tribune.[tpl]cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=11C4D08D89A25AB8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Lifecasting creating age of self-made stars – People turn cameras on themselves and on their worlds|accessdate=2008-12-07|date=2007-10-15|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Guynn, Jessica[/tpl]  That fall, she was a featured participant in the first annual BlogWorld & New Media Expo,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crunchnotes.com/2007/11/09/blogworld/|title=Blogworld|accessdate=2010-11-11|date=2007-11-07|work=CrunchNotes|author=Arrington, Michael[/tpl] which bills itself as the World's Largest Social Media Conference.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blogworldexpo.com/|title=World's Largest Social Media Conference|accessdate=2010-11-11|publisher=Blogworldexpo.com[/tpl]
By April 2008, Ezarik had largely reduced her lifecasting productions to a less frequent basis. She had resumed pursuit of her web designer and video editor career and was living in Carnegie. Her new equipment by Nokia enabled her to lifecast and produce streaming video live without a computer connection.  She continued to make weekly appearances on her own iJustine website at www.ijustine.tv.[tpl]cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:PPGB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=12007AD81D448DC0&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=The Whole World Is Watching – OK, Maybe Not.

Ezarik posted a video about wanting to order a cheeseburger on YouTube.  It got 600,000 views in its first week.  Ezarik has come to view iJustine as a character.  As a result, she does not curse or drink on any videos she releases.  By January 2009 she reduced her lifecasting a few hours a week, and by April 2009 her lifecast channel fell silent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.justin.tv/ijustine/all|title=iJustine's Videos|accessdate=2009-03-19|publisher=Twitter[/tpl] When Ezarik first moved to Los Angeles, she was managed by Richard Frias, who also manages YouTube celebrities HappySlip and KevJumba, but according to a post on Ezarik's alternate Twitter account, she was unmanaged and earned money by appearing at conferences and in online promotional spots.[tpl]cite web |url=http://twitter.com/otherijustine/status/1344292115|accessdate=2009-03-19|date=2009-03-17|publisher=Twitter|author=otherijustine|title=I do not currently have a manager[/tpl] At the time, she believed that her fanbase was predominately between the ages of 11 and 18.
