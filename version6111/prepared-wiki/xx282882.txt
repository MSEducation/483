==Racing career==

War Command's first start came on 7 June 2013 in a seven-furlong maiden race at Leopardstown, which he won by a neck from the pre-race favourite Intensified.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=581282 |title=Results From The 5.50 Race At Leopardstown |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2013-08-10[/tpl] Eleven days later War Command travelled to Royal Ascot for the Coventry Stakes. He was an outsider for the race and started at the price of 20/1, with his trained Aidan O'Brien also having two more fancied runners in the colts Stubbs and Sir John Hawkins. War Command's jockey Seamie Heffernan, held him up near the rear of the field in the early stages of the race, before moving closer to the leaders with two furlongs left to run. He took the lead with over one furlong before the finish and pulled clear to win by six lengths from Parbold. War Command's stable-mate Sir John Hawkins finished three quarters of a length behind Parbold in third place.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=580381 |title=Coventry Stakes result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2013-08-10[/tpl] After the performance he was priced as short as 5/1 for the 2014 running of the 2000 Guineas Stakes.[tpl]cite web|author= By David Baxter 4:31PM 18 JUN 2013  |url=http://www.racingpost.com/news/horse-racing/war-command-royal-ascot-war-in-total-command-of-coventry-stakes/1297937/#newsArchiveTabs=last7DaysNews |title=Royal Ascot War in total command of Coventry Stakes |publisher=Racing Post |date=2013-06-18 |accessdate=2013-08-10[/tpl]
War Command then stepped up to Group 1 level for the Phoenix Stakes at The Curragh. He started as the 2/5 favourite of the field of five. Ridden by Joseph O'Brien, he could only manage to finish third, one length behind winner Sudirman.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=576011 |title=Phoenix Stakes result |publisher=Racing Post |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl] War Command returned to The Curragh on 24 August for the Futurity Stakes. After again starting as an odds-on favourite he took the lead inside the final furlong and pulled clear to win by three lengths from Mustajeeb.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=583002 |title=Futurity Stakes result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2013-09-15[/tpl]
On 12 October, War Command was sent back to England to contest Britain's most prestigious two-year-old race, the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden by Joseph O'Brien, he started the 10/11 favourite against a field which included the July Stakes winner Anjaal and the Champagne Stakes winner Outstrip. He raced behind the leaders before taking the lead a furlong from the finish and winning by one and a quarter lengths from the 20/1 outsider Cable Bay.
In November, War Command was narrowly defeated by Kingston Hill in the voting for Champion Two-year-old Colt at the Cartier Racing Awards.[tpl]cite web|author=Graham Green |url=http://www.racingpost.com/news/horse-racing/treve-mme-c-head-maarek-he-sh-joaan-bin-hamad-al-thani-arc-heroine-crowned-cartier-horse-of-the-year/1562146/#newsArchiveTabs=last7DaysNews |title=Arc heroine Treve crowned Cartier horse of the year |publisher=Racing Post |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-13[/tpl]
