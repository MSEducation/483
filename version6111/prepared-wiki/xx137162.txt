===Blog 27===

In 2005, Boratyn, along with Tola Szlagowska shot to fame as a member of the Blog 27 with the release of "Uh La La La". The debut album "LOL" was a success in a few countries like Poland, Germany, Austria, Japan or Hungary. Blog27 debuted while Tola Szlagowska and Alicja Boratyn (Ala) were 13 years old in the summer of 2005 with a cover version of Alexia's hit "Uh La La La"; it became one of the biggest Polish hits of the season. Their second single "Hey Boy (Get Your Ass Up)" was released later the same year and the album LOL sold over 100,000 copies and peaked at #1 in Poland, becoming double platinum. Their singles also did very well on the Polish charts, all making it to the top 3; the most successful was "Wid Out Ya", which made it four times to #1. In early 2006 Blog 27 went on tour with Tokio Hotel, released three singles in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, and one ("Uh La La La") in France, Italy, Hungary and Japan. Four singles were released in Poland: "Uh La La La", "Hey Boy (Get Your Ass Up)", "Wid Out Ya" and "I Still Don't Know Ya".
