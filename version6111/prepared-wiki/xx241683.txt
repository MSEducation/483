[[Pulvilli]]

CATEGORIES: Arthropod morphology, Insects

The pulvilli are soft, cushionlike pads on the feet on insects, namely the housefly and ixodid ticks. More specifically, the pulvillus is located between the claws. 
The pulvilli functions as an adhesive system, with their adhesion coming from two physical components: partly the adhesion caused by Van der Waals force, and partly due to an adhesive fluid secreted from the extremities onto numerous surfaces.
