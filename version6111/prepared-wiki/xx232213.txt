==History==

The FME was established in 1999, under the authority of two acts of legislation, act number 87/1998 on the Official Supervision of Financial Operations and act number 99/1999 on the Payment of Cost Due to the Official Supervision of Financial Activities.

===FME and the Icelandic financial crisis 2008===

During the 2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis Jónas Fr Jónsson was the CEO of the FME, both he and the FME were heavily criticized for missing the warning signs and inaction leading up to and during the crisis.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.economicdisasterarea.com/index.php/news/jonas-teaching-business-law-and-corporate-responsibility/ | author = Economic Disaster Area| title=Jonas Teaching Business Law and Corporate Responsibility |date = 5 September 2009[/tpl] The FME played an important role during the crises in late 2008 when the main three Icelandic banks failed:
On October 6, 2008 it was announced that the FME would be given significant additional powers over Icelandic financial institutions by the Icelandic government.  Included the power to take over the running of Icelandic banks without actually nationalising them.  Immediately the following morning it intervened in the operations of Landsbanki http://www.tidarandinn.is/taxonomy/term/219 and Glitnir, taking over their operations within Iceland. 
On 9 October, Kaupthing was placed into receivership by the FME, following the resignation of the entire board of directors.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.fme.is/?PageID=581&NewsID=340 | author = Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) | title = Based on New Legislation, the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) Proceeds to take Control of Kaupþing to ensure Continued Commercial Bank Operations in Iceland | date = 9 October 2008 | accessdate = 2008-10-12[/tpl] The bank said that it was in technical default on its loan agreements after its UK subsidiary had been placed into administration.
On 25 January 2009, Björgvin G. Sigurðsson, Iceland's Commerce Minister, resigned citing the pressures of the nation's economic collapse, as the country's political leaders failed to agree on how to lead country out of its financial crisis. One of his last acts as minister was to dismiss Jónas Fr Jónsson the director of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA).  He was subsequently replaced by Deputy CEO Ragnar Haflidason.
