Byzantine Rite Lutheranism is the form of Lutheranism native to the nation of Ukraine. It is unique in that it uses a mix between the Byzantine Rite of the Eastern Greek Orthodox Church and the Liturgical formulas of the Western Roman Catholic Church, the base text for the Western Lutheran Church Liturgies. 
The first published Liturgy of the Eastern Rite was in 1933. The English text of the rite now in use is almost identical to that of the original printing.
