==Gameplay==

You play as a man named Jack, a man who is trying to become a member of a hunting club named the Order of Orion. Terrain is one thing you need to focus on. Falling off ledges or logs, or stepping on noisy terrain could cause failure in your hunt. Aggressive animals, such as bear, will attack you, which also results in hunt failure.
