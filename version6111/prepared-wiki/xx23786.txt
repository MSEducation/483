[[Night monkey]]

CATEGORIES: Night monkeys

The night monkeys, also known as the owl monkeys or douroucoulis, are the members of the genus Aotus of New World monkeys (monotypic in family Aotidae). The lifespan of a wild night monkey is unknown; however, they have a lifespan of 20 years in captivity. The total population of night monkeys is similarly unknown, as they live near the canopies of deciduous forests, making counting them very difficult. Night monkeys constitute one of the few monkey species that are affected by the often deadly human malaria protozoan Plasmodium falciparum, making them useful as non-human primate experimental models in malaria research.[tpl]cite book | editor = Baer, J.F., Weller, R.E. and Kakoma, I.

==Taxonomy==

Until 1983, all night monkeys were placed into only one (A. lemurimus) or two species (A. lemurinus and A. azarae). Chromosome variability showed that there was more than one species in the genus and Hershkovitz (1983) used morphological and karyological evidence to propose nine species, one of which is now recognised as a junior synonym.[tpl]cite journal | author = Defler, T. R., & Bueno, M. L. | year = 2007 | title = Aotus Diversity and the Species Problem | journal = Primate Conservation | volume = 2007 | issue = 22 | pages = 55–70[/tpl] He split Aotus into two groups: a northern, gray-necked group (A. lemurinus, A. hershkovitzi, A. trivirgatus and A. vociferans) and a southern, red-necked group (A. miconax, A. nancymaae, A. nigriceps and A. azarae). Arguably, the taxa otherwise considered subspecies of A. lemurinus – brumbacki, griseimembra and zonalis – should be considered separate species,[tpl]cite journal | author = Defler, T.R., Bueno, M.

A new species from the gray-necked group was recently described as A. jorgehernandezi.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Defler | first1 = T. R. | last2 = Bueno | first2 = M.

Chromosome evidence has also been used as an argument for merging "species", as was the case for considering infulatus a subspecies of A. azarae rather than a separate species.[tpl]cite journal | author = Pieczarka, J.

===Classification===

Family Aotidae

==Physical characteristics==

Night monkeys have large brown eyes; the size improves their nocturnal vision, thus increasing their ability to be active at night. Their ears are rather difficult to see; this is why their genus name, Aotus (meaning "earless") was chosen. There is little data on the weights of wild night monkeys. From the figures that have been collected, it appears that males and females are similar in weight; the heaviest species is Azara's night monkey at around [tpl]Convert|1254|g|lb[/tpl], and the lightest is Brumback's night monkey, which weighs between [tpl]Convert|455|and|875|g|lb[/tpl]. The male is slightly taller than the female, measuring [tpl]Convert|346|and|341|mm|in[/tpl], respectively.

==Ecology==

Night monkeys can be found in Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, and Bolivia. The species that live at higher elevations tend to have thicker fur than the monkeys at sea level. The night monkey can live in forests undisturbed by humans (primary forest) as well as forests that are recovering from human logging efforts (secondary forest).Cawthon Lang KA. 2005 July 18.

==Behavior==

The name "night monkey" comes from the fact that all species are active at night and are, in fact, the only truly nocturnal monkeys (an exception is the subspecies Aotus azarae azarae, which is cathemeral). Night monkeys make a notably wide variety of vocal sounds, with up to eight categories of distinct calls (gruff grunts, resonant grunts, screams, low trills, moans, gulps, sneeze grunts and hoots), and a frequency range of 190-1,950 Hz.[tpl]cite journal | author = Moynihan, M. | title = Some behavior patterns of platyrrhine monkeys. I. The night monkey (Aotus trivirgatus) | journal = Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections | year = 1964 | volume = 146 | issue = 5 | pages = 1–84[/tpl] Unusual among the New World monkeys, they are monochromats, that is, they have no colour vision, presumably because it is of no advantage given their nocturnal habits. They have a better spatial resolution at low light levels than other primates, which contributes to their ability to capture insects and move at night.[tpl]cite journal | author = Jacobs, G. H., Deegan, J. F., Neitz, J., Crognale, M.

Family groups defend territories by vocal calls and scent marking.
The night monkey is socially monogamous, and all night monkeys form pair bonds. Only one infant is born each year. The male is the primary caregiver, and the mother only carries the infant for the first week or so of its life. This is believed to have developed because it increases the survival of the infant and reduces the metabolic costs on the female. Adults will occasionally be evicted from the group by same-sex individuals, either kin or outsiders.[tpl]Cite doi | 10.1163/156853908X397925[/tpl]
