</ref> At the end of their lives, red dwarfs simply become dimmer and dimmer.<ref name="late stages" /> However, since the lifespan of such stars is greater than the current [[age of the universe]] (13.8 billion years), no stars under about 0.85 solar masses<ref name="saomainseq">[tpl]cite web | title=Main Sequence Lifetime | url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/M/Main+Sequence+Lifetime | work=Swinburne Astronomy Online Encyclopedia of Astronomy | publisher=Swinburne University of Technology [/tpl]</ref> are expected to have moved off of the main sequence.
Besides mass, the elements heavier than helium can play a significant role in the evolution of stars. In astronomy all elements heavier than helium are considered a "metal", and the chemical concentration of these elements is called the metallicity. The metallicity can influence the duration that a star will burn its fuel, control the formation of magnetic fields and modify the strength of the stellar wind.[ref]
