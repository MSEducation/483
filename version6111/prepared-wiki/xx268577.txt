The Roanoke Park Historic District is one Raleigh, North Carolina’s historic Five Points neighborhoods. It is situated southeast of the Five Points intersection of Glenwood Avenue and Fairview and Whitaker Mill Roads. Roanoke Park is composed of six separate plats, filed from 1913 to 1926, and is roughly shaped like a diamond. 
Architecturally, houses with Craftsman detailing, such as bungalows and foursquares, constitute the majority of the neighborhood. However, some of the oldest houses in Five Points are located in Roanoke Park, and these homes employ more vernacular styles, including side-gabled Triple-A cottages and narrow shotgun houses, particularly along Sunrise Avenue. 
Developers created the neighborhood’s namesake Roanoke Park subdivision in 1922. Its promoters appealed to white first-time homebuyers and boasted about the suburb's location next to Hayes Barton, an upper-class neighborhood also in Five Points. This section of the neighborhood centers on a park and includes the largest period revival houses. 
Roanoke Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003 as a Historic District.
