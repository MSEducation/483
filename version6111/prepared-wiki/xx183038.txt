==History==

The establishment of Roosevelt happened when Alice C.E. Wagoner was appointed postmistress and a post office was established on August 22, 1898.[tpl]cite web|title=Kimble County Post Offices|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~txpost/kimble.html|publisher=Jim Wheat|accessdate=25 February 2011[/tpl] Wagoner applied for the community as a different name, but the United States Postal Service named the town Roosevelt.[tpl]cite web|title=Escape-Roosevelt, Texas|url=http://www.texasescapes.com/TOWNS/Roosevelt/Roosevelt_Texas.htm|work=Texas Escapes|publisher=Texas Escapes - Blueprints For Travel, LLC|accessdate=25 February 2011[/tpl] It is presumed that the postal service chose the name for Theodore Roosevelt, who had made headlines the month before on July 1, 1898 with his charge up San Juan Hill with the Rough Riders. Roosevelt's 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, known as the Rough Riders, was organized and trained at San Antonio on May 9â€“19, 1898.[tpl]cite book|last=Morgan|first=James|title=Theodore Roosevelt, The Boy And The Man|year=orig. 1907, reprint 2010|publisher=Nabu Press|isbn=978-1-172-21340-5|page=114|chapter=Organizing the Rough Riders[/tpl]
Roosevelt was a shipping point for feed and grain for local sheep and goat farmers. Horses were bred in Roosevelt for the United States Cavalry, and also for the national polo market. In the early part of the 19th Century, Roosevelt hosted polo matches.[tpl]cite web|last=Gaxiola|first=Anthony B|title=TSHA-Roosevelt, Texas|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hlr37|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=25 February 2011[/tpl]
