Proceedings of the Royal Society is the parent title of two scientific journals published by the Royal Society. Originally a single journal, it was split into two separate journals in 1905:
The two journals are currently the Royal Society's main research journals. Many celebrated names in science have published their research in Proc. R. Soc., including Paul Dirac, Werner Heisenberg, James Clerk Maxwell, Ernest Rutherford, and Erwin Schrödinger.

==History==

The journal started out in 1800 as the Abstracts of the Papers Printed in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. The Royal Society published four volumes, from 1800 to 1843. Volumes 5 and 6, which appeared from 1843 to 1854, were called Abstracts of the Papers Communicated to the Royal Society of London. Starting with volume 7, in 1854, the Proceedings first appeared under the name Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Publication of the proceedings in this form continued to volume 75 in 1905. Starting with volume 76, the Proceedings were split into Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Containing Papers of a Mathematical and Physical Character and Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Containing Papers of a Biological Character. The Proceedings have since undergone further name changes. Currently, the two series are called Proceedings of the Royal Society A — Mathematical, Physical & Engineering Sciences and Proceedings of the Royal Society B — Biological Sciences.

Proc. R. Soc. A publishes peer-reviewed research articles in the mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences. The journal is abstracted and indexed by Applied Mechanics Reviews, GeoRef, British and Irish Archaeological Bibliography, Chemical Abstracts, Chemistry Citation Index, Composites Alert, Compumath Citation Index, Current Contents, Engineered Materials Abstracts, Engineering Index Monthly, Excerpta Medica, Fluidex, Forest Products Abstracts, Geographical Abstracts, Human Geography, Geological Abstracts, Geomechanics Abstracts, Index to Scientific Reviews, Inspec, Mass Spectrometry Bulletin, Mathematical Reviews, Metals Abstracts, Metals Abstracts Index, Mineralogical Abstracts, Nonferrous Metals Alert, Oceanographic Literature Review, Petroleum Abstracts, Polymers, Ceramics, Research Alert (Philadelphia), Science Citation Index, Steels Alert, and World Aluminum Abstracts.
The current editor-in-chief is Professor Sir Mark Welland FRS.

==Proceedings of the Royal Society B==

This series covers research related to biological sciences. Topics covered in particular include ecology, behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology, as well as epidemiology, human biology, neuroscience, palaeontology, psychology, and biomechanics. It publishes predominately research articles and reviews, as well as comments, replies, and commentaries. In 2005, Biology Letters (originally a supplement to Proceedings B), was launched as an independent journal publishing short articles from across biology.
The current editor-in-chief is Michael Hassell. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2011 impact factor of 5.415.[tpl]cite book |year=2012 |chapter=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |title=2011 Journal Citation Reports |publisher=Thomson Reuters |edition=Science |accessdate=2012-09-19 |series=Web of Science |postscript=.[/tpl]
