==Selection procedure==

Slovakia initially stated that they would not be participating in the 2011 contest on 1 December 2010 due to financial problems despite the great popularity of the contest in the country.[tpl]cite web|title=Slovakia withdraws from Eurovision 2011|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/16292?rss|last=Hondal|first=Victor|date=1 December 2010|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=31 December 2010[/tpl] STV hoped that they would be able to participate in the contest once again in 2012. However, on 31 December 2010, the EBU announced that STV were now willing to participate in the 2011 contest. Slovakia was the final country to confirm participation in the 2011 contest. Slovakia decided to take part in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 in order to avoid paying a fine.[tpl]cite web|title=Slovakia: Better in than paying fine|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/16492|last=Busa|first=Alexandru|date=17 January 2011|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=19 January 2011[/tpl]
