==Architecture==

===Exterior===

The church is built in ashlar with slate roofs.  It is a large, tall church with mixed Gothic styles.  Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, and a polygonal apse.  Entry to the church is at the west through a three-order portal above which are three statues on corbels. On the underside of the middle corbel is a bust of John Butler in military uniform. Above the statue is a carved arch, then a small parapet and a large rose window, and a gable with an openwork parapet surmounted by a crocketed cross.  At each side of the portal is an octagonal turret with a three-stage pinnacle.  Outside the turrets are offices, each with a niche containing on one side the name of the architect and on the other the sculptor.  The aisles have five five-light windows and are battlemented; the clerestory has triple lancet windows and an openwork parapet.  The apse has tall five-light Perpendicular windows.  On the south side is a priest's door.

===Interior===

The ceiling is rib vaulted with carved bosses and there are four-bay arcades with dogtooth decoration.  On each side of the altar is a carved relief, one showing the Beheading of St John, the other Mary Magdalene.
