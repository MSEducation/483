François-Auguste Biard (Lyon 30 June 1799 – 20 June 1882) was a French genre painter.
His painting, Scenes on the Coast of Africa, depicted on the right, was the inspiration behind Isaac Julien's short film The Attendant (1993). Biard was a known abolitionist against the Atlantic slave trade. Biard travelled extensively around the world. He was particularly successful in rendering burlesque groups like in Sea Sickness on a British Corvet (Dallas Museum of Art).
