[[Economy of Hungary]]

CATEGORIES: Economy of Hungary, European Union member economies, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member economies

The economy of Hungary is a medium-sized, upper-middle-income,World Bank Country Classification structurally, politically and institutionally open economy in Central Europe and is part of the European Union's (EU) single market. The economy of Hungary experienced market liberalization in the early 1990s as part of the transition from a socialist economy to a market economy, similarly to most countries in the former Eastern Bloc. Hungary is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) since 1995,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_33873108_33873438_1_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=About Hungary |publisher=OECD |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl] a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) since 1996,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/hungary_e.htm|title=Hungary and the WTO[/tpl] and a member of the European Union since 2004.[tpl]cite web |url=http://europa.eu/abc/european_countries/eu_members/hungary/index_en.htm |title=Member States of the EU: Hungary |publisher=EU |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]
The private sector accounts for more than 80% of the Hungarian gross domestic product (GDP). Foreign ownership of and investment in Hungarian firms are widespread, with cumulative foreign direct investment worth more than $70 billion. Hungary's main industries are mining, metallurgy, construction materials, processed foods, textiles, chemicals (especially pharmaceuticals), and motor vehicles. Hungary's main agricultural products are wheat, corn, sunflower seed, potatoes, sugar beets; pigs, cattle, poultry, and dairy products.The CIA World Factbook

==History of the Hungarian economy==

===Árpád Age===

At the age of feudalism the key factor of the economic life was the land. The new economic and social orders formed the private ownership of the lands. There are three forms of existence: the royal, ecclesiastical and secular private estate. The royal estate of the Árpád dynasty had evolved from the tribal lands.
The origin of the secular private holdings dates back to the conquest tribal common estates, which are increasingly in charge of the society and grows over private ownership of the becoming leaders.
However, from the founding of the state the royal gift also entered the multiplying factors secular private property line. This organization developed a feudal estate, which had two elements: the ancient estate and the possessions which were awarded by Saint Stephen I, and then the royal donations. Over the holder unrestricted right granted by the latter lineal heir almost returned to the king. In the Order of the laws changed in 1351, which abolished the nobility's possessions for free disposal. It forbidden the nobility to sale their inherited land.
The Carpathian Basin was more suitable for agriculture than large livestock grazing, and therefore increased steadily in the former weight. In the 11-12 th centuries natural farming and soil changer tillage systems met: grazing the animals, and they used the fertilized land until depletion. The most important tools for the agriculture were the plow and the ox.

===Anjou Age===

===Hungarian economy prior to the transition===

The Hungarian economy prior to World War II was primarily oriented toward agriculture and small-scale manufacturing. Hungary's strategic position in Europe and its relative high lack of natural resources also have dictated a traditional reliance on foreign trade. For instance, its largest car manufacturer, Magomobil (maker of the Magosix), produced a total of a few thousand units.G.N. Georgano Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886–1930. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985) In the early 1920s the textile industry began to expand rapidly, by 1928 it became the most important industry in the foreign trade of Hungary exporting textile goods worth more than 60 million pengős in that year. Companies like MÁVAG exported locomotives to India and South-America, its locomotive no. 601 was the largest and most powerful in Europe at the time.
From the late 1940s, the Communist government started to nationalise the industry. At first only factories with more than 100 workers were nationalized, later this limit was reduced to only 10. In the agriculture, the government started a disastrous programme of collectivization. From the early 1950s more and more new factories were built. This rapid and forced industrialization followed the standard Stalinist pattern in an effort to encourage a more self-sufficient economy. Most economic activity was conducted by state-owned enterprises or cooperatives and state farms. In 1968, Stalinist self-sufficiency was replaced by the "New Economic Mechanism", which reopened Hungary to foreign trade, gave limited freedom to the workings of the market, and allowed a limited number of small businesses to operate in the services sector.	
Although Hungary enjoyed one of the most liberal and economically advanced economies of the former Eastern Bloc, both agriculture and industry began to suffer from a lack of investment in the 1970s, and Hungary's net foreign debt rose significantly—from $1 billion in 1973 to $15 billion in 1993—due largely to consumer subsidies and unprofitable state enterprises. In the face of economic stagnation, Hungary opted to try further liberalization by passing a joint venture law, instating an income tax, and joining the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. By 1988, Hungary had developed a two-tier banking system and had enacted significant corporate legislation which paved the way for the ambitious market-oriented reforms of the post-communist years.

===Transition to a market economy===

After the fall of communism, the former Eastern Bloc had to transition from a one-party, centrally planned economy to a market economy with a multi-party political system. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Eastern Bloc countries suffered a significant loss in both markets for goods, and subsidizing from the Soviet Union.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] Hungary, for example, "lost nearly 70% of its export markets in Eastern and Central Europe." The loss of external markets in Hungary left "800,000 unemployed people because all the unprofitable and unsalvageable factories had been closed."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.koed.hu/medit/endre.pdf|title=The Political and Economic Transition in Hungary|format=PDF[/tpl] Another form of Soviet subsidizing that greatly affected Hungary after the fall of communism was the loss of social welfare programs.[tpl]or|date=May 2013[/tpl] Because of the lack of subsidies and a need to reduce expenditures, many social programs in Hungary had to be cut in an attempt to lower spending. As a result, many people in Hungary suffered incredible hardships during the transition to a market economy. Following privatization and tax reductions on Hungarian businesses, unemployment suddenly rose to 12% in 1991 (it was 1.7% in 1990 ), gradually decreasing until 2001. Economic growth, after a fall in 1991 to −11.9%, gradually grew until the end of the 1990s at an average annual rate of 4.2%. With the stabilization of the new market economy, Hungary has experienced growth in foreign investment with a "cumulative foreign direct investment totaling more than $60 billion since 1989."[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/hu.html|title=CIA – The World Factbook – Hungary[/tpl]	
The Antall government of 1990–94 began market reforms with price and trade liberation measures, a revamped tax system, and a nascent market-based banking system. By 1994, however, the costs of government overspending and hesitant privatization had become clearly visible. Cuts in consumer subsidies led to increases in the price of food, medicine, transportation services, and energy. Reduced exports to the former Soviet bloc and shrinking industrial output contributed to a sharp decline in GDP. Unemployment rose rapidly to about 12% in 1993. The external debt burden, one of the highest in Europe, reached 250% of annual export earnings, while the budget and current account deficits approached 10% of GDP. The devaluation of the currency (in order to support exports), without effective stabilization measures, such as indexation of wages, provoked an extremely high inflation rate, that in 1991 reached 35% and slightly decreased until 1994, growing again in 1995. In March 1995, the government of Prime Minister Gyula Horn implemented an austerity program, coupled with aggressive privatization of state-owned enterprises and an export-promoting exchange raw regime, to reduce indebtedness, cut the current account deficit, and shrink public spending. By the end of 1997 the consolidated public sector deficit decreased to 4.6% of GDP—with public sector spending falling from 62% of GDP to below 50%—the current account deficit was reduced to 2% of GDP, and government debt was paid down to 94% of annual export earnings.	 
The Government of Hungary no longer requires IMF financial assistance and has repaid all of its debt to the fund. Consequently, Hungary enjoys favorable borrowing terms. Hungary's sovereign foreign currency debt issuance carries investment-grade ratings from all major credit-rating agencies, although recently the country was downgraded by Moody's, S&P and remains on negative outlook at Fitch. In 1995 Hungary's currency, the Forint (HUF), became convertible for all current account transactions, and subsequent to OECD membership in 1996, for almost all capital account transactions as well. Since 1995, Hungary has pegged the forint against a basket of currencies (in which the U.S. dollar is 30%), and the central rate against the basket is devalued at a preannounced rate, originally set at 0.8% per month, the Forint is now an entirely free-floating currency. The government privatization program ended on schedule in 1998: 80% of GDP is now produced by the private sector, and foreign owners control 70% of financial institutions, 66% of industry, 90% of telecommunications, and 50% of the trading sector.	 
After Hungary's GDP declined about 18% from 1990 to 1993 and grew only 1%–1.5% up to 1996, strong export performance has propelled GDP growth to 4.4% in 1997, with other macroeconomic indicators similarly improving. These successes allowed the government to concentrate in 1996 and 1997 on major structural reforms such as the implementation of a fully funded pension system (partly modelled after Chile's pension system with major modifications), reform of higher education, and the creation of a national treasury. Remaining economic challenges include reducing fiscal deficits and inflation, maintaining stable external balances, and completing structural reforms of the tax system, health care, and local government financing. Recently, the overriding goal of Hungarian economic policy has been to prepare the country for entry into the European Union, which it joined in late 2004.	 
Prior to the change of regime in 1989, 65% of Hungary's trade was with Comecon countries. By the end of 1997, Hungary had shifted much of its trade to the West. Trade with EU countries and the OECD now comprises over 70% and 80% of the total, respectively. Germany is Hungary's single most important trading partner. The US has become Hungary's sixth-largest export market, while Hungary is ranked as the 72nd largest export market for the U.S. Bilateral trade between the two countries increased 46% in 1997 to more than $1 billion. The U.S. has extended to Hungary most-favored-nation status, the Generalized System of Preferences, Overseas Private Investment Corporation insurance, and access to the Export-Import Bank.	
With about $18 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) since 1989, Hungary has attracted over one-third of all FDI in central and eastern Europe, including the former Soviet Union. Of this, about $6 billion came from American companies. Foreign capital is attracted by skilled and relatively inexpensive labor, tax incentives, modern infrastructure, and a good telecommunications system.	
By 2006 Hungary’s economic outlook had deteriorated. Wage growth had kept up with other nations in the region; however, this growth has largely been driven by increased government spending. This has resulted in the budget deficit ballooning to over 10% of GDP and inflation rates predicted to exceed 6%. This prompted Nouriel Roubini, a White House economist in the Clinton administration, to state that "Hungary is an accident waiting to happen."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/world/2006-06-22-hungary-usat_x.htm|title=Hungary faces enormous economic hurdles|publisher=USAToday|accessdate=5 December 2008|first=David J.|last=Lynch|date=23 June 2006[/tpl]

===Privatization in Hungary===

In January 1990, the State Privatization Agency (SPA, Állami Vagyonügynökség) was established to manage the first steps of privatization. Because of Hungary's $21.2 billion foreign debt, the government decided to sell state property instead of distributing it to the people for free.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=vlADbGaMluEC&lpg=PR1&pg=PA427#v=onepage&q= |title=Privatization in Hungary and its Aftermath |author=Iván Major |year=2003 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |accessdate=2010-01-05 |isbn=978-1-84064-613-9[/tpl] The SPA was attacked by populist groups because several companies' management had the right to find buyers and discuss sale terms with them thus "stealing" the company. Another reason for discontent was that the state offered large tax subsidies and environmental investments, which sometimes cost more than the selling price of the company. Along with the acquisition of companies, foreign investors launched many "greenfield investments".
The center-right Hungarian Democratic Forum government of 1990–1994 decided to demolish agricultural co-operatives by splitting them up and giving machinery and land to their former members.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.agr.hr/jcea/issues/jcea4-2/pdf/jcea42-13.pdf |title=Strucutural Problems in Hungarian Agriculture After the Political Turnover |author=B. Vizvári, Zs. Bacsi |date=2003-06-02 |journal=Journal of Central European Agriculture |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-01-05[/tpl] The government also introduced a Recompensation Law which offered vouchers to people who had owned land before it was nationalized in 1948. These people (or their descendants) could exchange their vouchers for land previously owned by agricultural co-operatives, who were forced to give up some of their land for this purpose.
Small stores and retail businesses were privatized between 1990 and 1994, however, greenfield investments by foreign retail companies like Tesco, Cora and IKEA had a much bigger economic impact. Many public utilities, including the national telecommunications company Matáv, the national oil and gas conglomerate MOL Group, and electricity supply and production companies were privatized as well.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nao.org.uk/nao/intosai/wgap/8thmeeting/hungary2chpt4.pdf |title=Privatisation in Hungary (1990-2000) |author=Árpád Kovács |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-01-05[/tpl]
Though most banks were sold to foreign investors, the largest bank, National Savings Bank (OTP), remained Hungarian-owned. 20%-20% of the shares were sold to foreign institutional investors and given to the Social Security organizations, 5% were bought by employees, and 8% was offered at the Budapest Stock Exchange.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sml.hw.ac.uk/cert/wpa/1996/dp9613.pdf |title=Political Economy of Privatization in Hungary: A Progress Report |author=Anna Canning and Paul Hare |publisher=Department of Economics, Heriot-Watt University |location=Edinburgh |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-01-05[/tpl]

===Hungary's economy since 1990===

Reaching 1995, Hungary's fiscal indices deteriorated: foreign investment fell as well as judgement of foreign analysts on economic outlook.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/html/prddr/trans/MayJune95/pgs12-15.htm|title=Hungarian Finance Minister Lajos Bokros Explains His Package|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=2009-11-12[/tpl] Due to high demand in import goods, Hungary also had a high trade deficit [tpl]cite web|url=http://portal.ksh.hu/pls/ksh/docs/eng/xstadat/xstadat_annual/tabl3_05_02ie.html|title=External trade by groups of countries in HUF (1991–2003)|publisher=KSH|accessdate=2009-11-12[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and budget gap, and it could not reach an agreement with the IMF, either.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vg.hu/gazdasag/vg_online/gazdasag_-_belfold/081215_bokros_252890|title=Viták kereszttüzében: a Bokros-csomag (The Bokros Package in the Crossfire)|publisher=Világgazdaság Online|language=hungarian|date=2008-12-15|accessdate=2009-11-12[/tpl]
After not having a minister of finance for more than a month, prime minister Gyula Horn appointed Lajos Bokros as Finance Minister on 1 March 1995. He introduced a string of austerity measures (the "Bokros Package") on 12 March 1995 which had the following key points: one-time 9% devaluation of the forint, introducing a constant sliding devaluation, 8% additional customs duty on all goods except for energy sources, limitation of growth of wages in the public sector, simplified and accelerated privatization. The package also included welfare cutbacks, including abolition of free higher education and dental service; reduced family allowances, child-care benefits, and maternity payments depending on income and wealth; lowering subsidies of pharmaceuticals, and raising retirement age.
These reforms not only increased investor confidence,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26566.htm|title=Background Note: Hungary|publisher=Bureau of Public Affairs: Electronic Information and Publications Office|date=June 2009|accessdate=2009-11-12[/tpl] but they were also supported by the IMF and the World Bank, however, they were not welcome widely by the Hungarians; Bokros broke the negative record of popularity: 9% of the population wanted to see him in an "important political position" [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.median.hu/object.289bbab9-6e1c-4b75-a62d-cb90550284be.ivy|title=Romló közhangulat, stabilizálódó Fidesz-előny (Deteriorating Public Morale, Fidesz's Advantage Stabilizing |publisher=Medián|language=hungarian|date=2007-02-14|accessdate=2009-11-12[/tpl] and only 4% were convinced that the  reforms would "improve the country's finances in a big way"  
In 1996, the Ministry of Finance introduced a new pension system instead of the fully state-backed one: private pension savings accounts were introduced, which were 50% social security based and 50% funded.
In 2006 Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány was reelected on a platform promising economic “reform without austerity.”
However, after the elections in April 2006, the Socialist coalition under Gyurcsány unveiled a package of austerity measures which were designed to reduce the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2008.
Because of the austerity program, the economy of Hungary slowed down in 2007.

===2008-2009 financial crisis===

Declining exports, reduced domestic consumption and fixed asset accumulation hit Hungary hard during the financial crisis of 2008, making the country enter a severe recession of -6.4%, one of the worst economic contractions in its history.
On 27 October 2008, Hungary reached an agreement with the IMF and EU for a rescue package of US$25 billion, aiming to restore financial stability and investors' confidence.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/29/hungary-economy-imf-eu-world-bank |title=Hungary receives rescue package, with strings attached |author=Kate Connolly, Ian Traynor |date=2008-10-29 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]
Because of the uncertainty of the crisis, banks gave less loans which led to a decrease in investment. This along with price-awareness and fear of bankruptcy led to a fallback in consumption which then increased job losses and decreased consumption even further. Inflation did not rise significantly, but real wages decreased.[tpl]cite web |url=http://portal.ksh.hu/pls/ksh/docs/eng/xftp/gyor/jel/ejel20903.pdf |title=Economy and Society, January–March 2009 |publisher=Hungarian Central Statistical Office |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]
The fact that the euro and the Swiss franc are worth a lot more in forints than they were before affected a lot of people. According to The Daily Telegraph, "statistics show that more than 60 percent of Hungarian mortgages and car loans are denominated in foreign currencies".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/economy-economic-indicators/economic-indicators/11965908-1.html |title=Global Financial Crisis: Hungary |author=Damien Mc Elroy |date=2009-02-26 |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl] After the election in 2010 of the new Fidesz-party government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Hungarian banks were forced to allow the conversion of foreign-currency mortgages to the forint. The new government also nationalised $13 billion of private pension-fund assets, which could then be used to support the government debt position.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-22/hungary-top-court-may-rule-on-pension-fund-nationalization-case.html |title=Hungary Top Court May Rule on Pension Fund Nationalization Case |author=Zoltan Simon |publisher=Bloomberg |date=22 December 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2011[/tpl]

===Present-day Hungarian economy===

The economy showed signs of recovery in 2011 with decreasing tax rates and a moderate 1.7 percent GDP growth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbj.hu/economy/hungary-gdp-grows-14percent-yr-yr-in-q4-up-17percent-in-2011_62619 |title=Hungary GDP grows 1.4% yr/yr in Q4, up 1.7% in 2011 |publisher=BBJ |accessdate=15 February 2012[/tpl]
From November 2011 to January 2012, all three major credit rating agencies downgraded Hungarian debt to a non-investment speculative grade, commonly called "junk status".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16298773 |title=Hungary borrowing costs rise on junk downgrade |publisher=BBC |date=22 December 2011 |accessdate=27 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/dec/25/hungary-playing-chicken-editorial |title=Hungary: playing chicken |publisher=The Guardian |date=25 December 2011 |accessdate=27 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16446307|title=Third ratings agency gives Hungary a junk credit rating|publisher=BBC|date=6 January 2012|accessdate=9 January 2012[/tpl] In part this is because of political changes creating doubts about the independence of the Hungarian National Bank.

European Commission President José Manuel Barroso wrote to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán stating that new central bank regulations, allowing political intervention, "seriously harm" Hungary's interests, postponing talks on a financial aid package. Orbán responded "If we don’t reach an agreement, we’ll still stand on our own feet."
The European Commission launched legal proceedings against Hungary on 17 January 2012. The procedures concern Hungary’s central bank law, the retirement age for judges and prosecutors and the independence of the data protection office, respectively.Barroso says unwillingness of Hungary to make changes pushes EC to act against Budapest, Politics.hu, 17 January 2012; accessed 21 January 2012EU opens legal action against Hungary over new laws, BBC News, 17 January 2012; accessed 21 January 2012 One day later Orbán indicated in a letter his willingness to find solutions to the problems raised in the infringement proceedings.Orbán says Hungary ready to cooperate to resolve EU infringement issues, Politics.hu, 18 January 2012; accessed 21 January 2012 On 18 January he participated in plenary session of the European Parliament which also dealt with the Hungarian case.

He added that none of the EC’s objections affected Hungary’s new constitution.Orbán tells European Parliament disputes a natural result of Hungarian government’s “magnificent” efforts, Politics.hu, 18 January 2012; accessed 21 January 2012Hungary PM Orban fights back in European Parliament, BBC News, 18 January 2012; accessed 21 January 2012

==Physical properties==

===Natural resources===

Hungary's total land area is 93,030 km2 along with 690 km2 of water surface area which altogether makes up 1% of Europe's area.
Nearly 75% of Hungary's landscape consists of flat plains. Additional 20% of the country's area consists of foothills whose altitude is 400 m at the most; higher hills and water surface makes up the remaining 5%.
The two flat plains that take up three quarters of Hungary's area are the Great Hungarian Plain and the Little Hungarian Plain. Hungary's most significant natural resource is arable land. About 83% of the country's total territory is suitable for cultivation; of this portion, 75% (around 50% of the country's area) is covered by arable land, which is an outstanding ratio compared to other EU countries. Hungary lacks extensive domestic sources of energy and raw materials needed for further industrial development.
19% of the country is covered by forests. These are located mainly in the foothills such as the North Hungarian and the Transdanubian Mountains, and the Alpokalja. The composition of forests is various; mostly oak or beech, but the rest include fir, willow, acacia and plane.
In European terms, Hungary's underground water reserve is one of the largest. Hence the country is rich in brooks and hot springs as well as medicinal springs and spas; as of 2003, there are 1250 springs that provide water warmer than 30 degrees.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kvvm.hu/szakmai/karmentes/kiadvanyok/fav/tvkm/tvkm04.htm |title=A hévízfeltárás, -termelés, -hasznosítás alakulása (Figures of the Exploration, Production, and Utilization of Thermal Springs) |publisher=Hungarian Ministry of Environment and Water |language=Hungarian |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl] 90% of Hungary's drinking water is mostly retrieved from such sources.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eduline.hu/segedanyagtalalatok.aspx/letolt/2971 |title=Magyarország természetföldrajzi adottságai (Geographical Properties of Hungary) |language=Hungarian |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]
The major rivers of Hungary are the Danube and the Tisza. The Danube also flows through parts of Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Serbia, and Romania. It is navigable within Hungary for 418 km. The Tisza River is navigable for 444 km in the country. Hungary has three major lakes. Lake Balaton, the largest, is 78 km long and from 3 to 14 km wide, with an area of 592 km2. Lake Balaton is Central Europe's largest lake and a prosperous tourist spot and recreation area. Its shallow waters offer summer bathing and during the winter its frozen surface provides facilities for winter sports. Smaller bodies of water include Lake Velence (26 km2) in Fejér County and Lake Fertő (82 km2 within Hungary).

===Infrastructure===

====Transport====

Hungary has 31 058 km of roads and motorways of 1118 km. The total length of motorways has doubled in the last ten years with the most (106) kilometers built in 2006. Budapest is directly connected to the Austrian, Slovenian, Croatian and Serbian borders via motorways.
Due to its location and geographical features, several transport corridors cross Hungary. Pan-European corridors no. IV, V, and X, and European routes no. E60, E71, E73, E75, and E77 go through Hungary. Thanks to its radial road system, all of these routes touch Budapest.
There are five international, four domestic, four military and several non-public airports in Hungary. The largest airport is the Budapest Ferihegy International Airport (BUD) located at the southeastern border of Budapest. In 2008, the airport had 3,866,452 arriving and 3,970,951 departing passengers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://portal.ksh.hu/pls/ksh/docs/eng/xstadat/xstadat_annual/tabl4_06_10ie.html |title=Traffic of Budapest/Ferihegy Airport |publisher=Hungarian Central Statistical Office |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In 2006, the Hungarian railroad system was 7685 km long, 2791 km of it electrified.

==Sectors==

===Agriculture===

Agriculture accounted for 4.3% of GDP in 2008[tpl]cite web |url=http://portal.ksh.hu/pls/ksh/docs/eng/xstadat/xstadat_annual/tabl3_01_02iec.html |title=Value and distribution of gross value added by industries |year=2009 |publisher=Hungarian Central Statistical Office |accessdate=2009-12-31[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and along with the food industry occupied roughly 7.7% of the labor force.[tpl]cite web |url=http://portal.ksh.hu/pls/ksh/docs/eng/xstadat/xstadat_annual/tabl2_01_04iea.html |title=Number of employed persons by industries |year=2009 |publisher=Hungarian Central Statistical Office |accessdate=2009-12-31[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] These two figures represent only the primary agricultural production: along with related businesses, agriculture makes up about 13% of the GDP. Hungarian agriculture is virtually self-sufficient and due to traditional reasons export-oriented:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fvm.gov.hu/doc/upload/200812/masz_english.pdf |title=The Hungarian agriculture and food industry in figures |year=2008 |publisher=Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development |format=PDF |page=5 |accessdate=2009-12-31[/tpl] exports related to agriculture make up 20-25% of the total. About half of Hungary’s total land area is agricultural area under cultivation; this ratio is prominent among other EU members. This is due to the country's favourable conditions including continental climate and the plains that make up about half of Hungary’s landscape. The most important crops are wheat, corn, sunflower, potato, sugar beet, canola and a wide variety of fruits (notably apple, peach, pear, grape, watermelon, plum etc.). Hungary has several wine regions producing among others the worldwide famous white dessert wine Tokaji and the red Bull’s Blood. Another traditional world-famous alcoholic drink is the fruit brandy pálinka.
Mainly cattle, pigs, poultry and sheep are raised in the country. The livestock includes the Hungarian Grey Cattle which is a major tourist attraction in the Hungarian National Park of Hortobágy. An important component of the country’s gastronomic heritage is foie gras with about 33000 farmers engaged in the industry. Hungary is the second largest world producer and the biggest exporter of foie gras (exporting mainly to France).
Another symbol of Hungarian agriculture and cuisine is the paprika (both sweet and hot types). The country is one of the leading paprika producers of the world with Szeged and Kalocsa being the centres of production.

===Health care===

Hungary has a tax-funded universal healthcare system, organized by the state-owned National Healthcare Fund ([tpl]lang-hu|Országos Egészségbiztosítási Pénztár (OEP)[/tpl]). Health insurance is absolutely free for children, mothers or fathers with baby, students, pensioners, people with socially poor background, handicapped people (including physical and mental disorders),List of the entitled people for free insurance, National Healthcare Fund, 2013 priests and other church employees.Dőzsölők és szűkölködők - Miből gazdálkodnak az egyházak?, Figyelő (financial status of the churches in Hungary, Hungarian) Health in Hungary can be described with a rapidly growing life expectancy and a very low infant mortality rate (4.9 per 1,000 live births in 2012).Vital statistics, Hungarian Central Statistical Office (KSH) Hungary spent 7.4% of the GDP on health care in 2009 (it was 7.0% in 2000), lower than the average of the OECD. Total health expenditure was 1,511 US$ per capita in 2009, 1,053 US$ governmental-fund (69.7%) and 458 US$ private-fund (30.3%).Health: spending continues to outpace economic growth in most OECD countries, OECD Health data 2011

===Industry===

The main sectors of Hungarian industry are heavy industry (mining, metallurgy, machine and steel production), energy production, mechanical engineering, chemicals, food industry and automobile production. The industry is leaning mainly on processing industry and (including construction) accounted for 29,32% of GDP in 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.profitline.hu/index.php/hircentrum/hir/130567/link5 |title=Elemzői reakciók az ipari termelési adatra (Analysts' Reaction on Industrial Production Data) |date=2009-04-07 |language=Hungarian |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl] Due to the sparse energy and raw material resources, Hungary is forced to import most of these materials to satisfy the demands of the industry. Following the transition to market economy, the industry underwent restructuring and remarkable modernization. The leading industry is machinery, followed by chemical industry (plastic production, pharmaceuticals), while mining, metallurgy and textile industry seemed to be losing importance in the past two decades. In spite of the significant drop in the last decade, food industry is still giving up to 14% of total industrial production and amounts to 7-8% of the country's exports.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.itdh.com/engine.aspx?page=Trade_Food_Industry |title=Food Industry |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]
Nearly 50% of energy consumption is dependent on imported energy sources. Gas and oil are transported through pipelines from Russia forming 72% of the energy structure, while nuclear power produced by the nuclear power station of Paks accounts for 12%.

====Automobile production====

Hungary is a favoured destination of foreign investors of automotive industry resulting in the presence of General Motors (Szentgotthárd), Magyar Suzuki (Esztergom), Mercedes-Benz (Kecskemét), and Audi factory (Győr) in Central Europe.
17% of the total Hungarian exports comes from the exports of Audi, Opel and Suzuki. The sector employs about 90.000 people in more than 350 car component manufacturing companies.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.itdh.com/engine.aspx?page=Itdh_Automotive |title=Automotive Industry |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]

===Services===

The tertiary sector accounted for 64% of GDP in 2007 and its role in the Hungarian economy is steadily growing due to constant investments into transport and other services in the last 15 years. Located in the heart of Central-Europe, Hungary’s geostrategic location plays a significant role in the rise of the service sector as the country’s central position makes it suitable and rewarding to invest.
The total value of imports was 68,62 billion euros, the value of exports was 68,18 billion euros in 2007. The external trade deficit decreased by 12,5% since the previous year, easing down from 2,4 billion to 308 million euros in 2007. In the same year, 79% of Hungary’s export and 70% of the imports were transacted inside the EU.[tpl]cite web |url=http://portal.ksh.hu/pls/ksh/docs/hun/xftp/gyor/jel/jel30801.pdf |title=Statisztikai Tükör (Statistical Mirror) |date=2008-03-26 |publisher=Hungarian Central Statistical Office |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]

====Tourism====

Tourism employs nearly 150 thousand people and the total income from tourism was 4 billion euros in 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://portal.ksh.hu/pls/ksh/docs/hun/xftp/idoszaki/jeltur/jeltur08t.pdf |title=Táblamelléklet (Tables) |publisher=Hungarian Central Statistical Office |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl] One of Hungary’s top tourist destinations is Lake Balaton, the largest freshwater lake in Central Europe, with a number of 1,2 million visitors in 2008.

==Currency==

[tpl]main|Hungarian forint[/tpl]thumb|left|Forint coins and banknotes
The currency of Hungary is the Hungarian forint (HUF, Ft) since 1 August 1946. A forint consists of 100 fillérs, however, these have not been in circulation since 1999, they are only used in accounting.
There are six coins (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200)[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.mnb.hu/engine.aspx?page=mnben_coins|title=Hungarian Forint coins|publisher=Hungarian National Bank|year=2009|accessdate=2009-11-19[/tpl]  and six banknotes (500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000 and 20000).[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.mnb.hu/engine.aspx?page=mnben_notes|title=Hungarian Forint banknotes|publisher=Hungarian National Bank|year=2009|accessdate=2009-11-19[/tpl] The 1 and 2 forint coins were withdrawn in 2008, yet prices remained the same as stores follow the official rounding scheme [tpl]cite web|url=http://english.forint.hu/engine.aspx?page=rounding|title=Hungarian Forint rounding|publisher=Hungarian National Bank|year=2009|accessdate=2009-11-19[/tpl] for the final price.

As a member of the European Union, the long term aim of the Hungarian government is to replace the forint with the euro.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.mnb.hu/engine.aspx?page=mnben_sajtokozlemenyek&ContentID=3207|title=Hungarian strategy for adopting the Euro|publisher=Hungarian National Bank|year=2009|accessdate=2009-11-19[/tpl] See also: Fiscal policy.

==Socio-economic characteristics==

===Human capital===

Education in Hungary is free and compulsory from the age of 5 to 16.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.okm.gov.hu/letolt/english/education_in_hungary_080805.pdf|title=Education in Hungary |format=PDF|author=Ministry of Education and Culture|publisher=Department for EU Relations|pages=19–20, 25–28, 36|year=2008|accessdate=2009-11-25|isbn= 978-963-87399-5-7[/tpl] The state provides free pre-primary schooling for all children, 8 years of general education and 4 years of upper secondary level general or vocational education. Higher education system follows the three-cycle structure and the credit system of the bologna process. Governments aim to reach European standards and encourage international mobility by putting emphasis on digital literacy, and enhancing foreign language studies: all secondary level schools teach foreign languages and at least one language certificate is needed for the acquisition of a diploma. Over the past decade, this resulted in a drastic increase in the number of people speaking at least one foreign language.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tarki.hu/tarkitekinto/20050412.html|title=Foreign Language Speakers in Hungary|author=Endre Sík|publisher=Tárki Ltd.|year=2005|accessdate=2009-11-25|language=hu[/tpl]
Hungary's most prestigious universities are:
Financial sources for education are mainly provided by the state (making up 5.1-5.3% of the annual GDP). In order to improve the quality of higher education, the government encourages contributions by students and companies. Another important contributor is the EU.
The system has weaknesses, the most important being segregation and unequal access to quality education. The 2006 PISA report concluded that while students from comprehensive schools did better than the OECD average, pupils from vocational secondary schools did much worse.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/15/13/39725224.pdf|title=The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) |format=PDF|publisher=OECD|pages=33–34|year=2006|accessdate=2009-11-25|isbn= 978-92-64-04000-7[/tpl] Another problem is of the higher education’s: response to regional and labour market needs is insufficient. Government plans include improving the career guidance system and establishing a national digital network that will enable the tracking of jobs and facilitate the integration into the labour market.

===Social stratification===

As most post-communist countries, Hungary’s economy is affected by its social stratification in terms of income and wealth, age, gender and racial inequalities.

However, the legal system is slow and overburdened, which makes proceedings and rulings lengthy and inefficient.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eubusiness.com/europe/hungary/invest |title=Hungary Investment Climate 2009 |author=Ina Mimireva |date=2009-10-29 |publisher=EUbusiness |accessdate=2010-01-03[/tpl] Such a justice system is hardly capable of prosecuting corruption and protecting the country’s financial interests.

===Monetary policy===

The Hungarian organization responsible for controlling the country's monetary policy is the Hungarian National Bank (Hungarian: Magyar Nemzeti Bank, MNB) which is the central bank in Hungary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.mnb.hu/|title=Hungarian National Bank homepage[/tpl] According to the Hungarian Law of National Bank (which became operative in 2001. – LVIII. Law about The Hungarian National Bank[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.complex.hu/external.php?url=3 |title=Törvények és OGY határozatok (Laws and Decrees) |language=Hungarian |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]), the primary objective of MNB is to achieve and maintain price stability. This aim is in line with the European and international practice.
Price stability means achieving and maintaining a basically low, but positive inflation rate. This level is around 2-2.5% according to international observations, while the European Central Bank "aims at inflation rates of below, but close to 2% over the medium term".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/html/index.en.html |title=Monetary policy |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl] Since Hungary is in the process of catching up (Balassa-Samuelson effect), the long-term objective is a slightly higher figure, around 2.3-3.2%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mnb.hu/Resource.aspx?ResourceID=mnbfile&resourcename=ht2004_1_en|title=The Optimal Rate of Inflation in Hungary|format=PDF|publisher=Hungarian National Bank|year=2004|accessdate=2009-11-01|author=Gergely Kiss and Judit Krekó[/tpl] Therefore the medium term inflation target of the Hungarian National Bank is 3%.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mnb.hu/Engine.aspx?page=mnbhu_monet_kozlem&ContentID=7139 |title=Közlemény a középtávú inflációs cél kitűzéséről (Announcement on Mid-term Inflation Plans) |date=2005-08-25 |publisher=Hungarian National Bank |language=Hungarian |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]
Concerning the exchange rate system, the floating exchange rate system is in use since 26 February 2008, as a result of which HUF is fluctuating in accordance with the effects of the market in the face of the reference currency, the euro.
The chart on the right shows forint exchange rates for the British pound (GBP), euro (EUR), Swiss franc (CHF), and the U.S. dollar (USD) from June 2008 to September 2009. It indicates that a relatively strong forint weakened since the beginning of the financial crisis, and that its value has recently taken an upward turn.
Compared to the euro the forint was at peak on 18 June 2008 when 1000 Ft was €4.36 and €1 was 229.11Ft. The forint was worth the least on 6 March 2009; this day 1000 Ft was €3.16 and €1 was 316Ft).
Compared to USD, most expensive/cheapest dates are 22 June 2008 and 6 March 2009 with 1000HUF/USD rates 6.94 and 4.01 respectively.

===Fiscal policy===

In Hungary, state revenue makes up 44% and expenditure makes up 45% of the GDP which is relatively high compared to other EU members.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kopint-tarki.hu/reform/rsz_munkaanyag.pdf |title=A gazdasági növekedés dinamizálásának lehetősége az államháztartási kiadások csökkentése mellett (Possibilities of Boosting Economic Growth while Decreasing Public Deficit) |date=2009-03-10 |publisher=Attila Bartha et al. |format=PDF |language=Hungarian |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl] This can be traced back to historical reasons such as socialist economic tradition as well as cultural characteristics that endorse paternalist behaviour on the state’s part, meaning that people have a habitual reflex that make them call for state subsidies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hetek.hu/belfold/200308/feszultsegnovelo_csokkentes|title=Interjú Gere Ádámmal, a Hayek Társaság elnökével (Interview with Adam Gere, Chairman of Hayek Institute)|publisher=hetek.hu |language=Hungarian |year=2003|accessdate=2009-10-31[/tpl] Some economists[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kopint-tarki.hu/aboutus.html|title=Kopint-Tárki Konjunktúrakutató Intézet (Kopint-Tárki Institute for Economic Research Ltd.) |language=Hungarian|accessdate=2009-10-31[/tpl] dispute this point, claiming that expenditure ran up to today’s critical amount from 2001, during two left-wing government cycles.
Along with joining the EU the country undertook the task of joining the Eurozone as well. Therefore, the Maastricht criteria which forms the condition of joining the Eurozone acts as an authoritative guideline to Hungarian fiscal politics. Although there has been remarkable progress, recent years’ statistics still point at significant discrepancies between the criteria and fiscal indices. The target date for adapting the Euro has not been fixed, either.
General government deficit has shown a drastic decline to -3.4% (2008) from -9.2% (2006).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.p-m.hu/web%5C%5Chome.nsf/portalarticles/9CE71763C9C1ECB1C125727C0048022C/$File/Fobb%20makrogazdasagi_jelzoszamok%20_eves%20adatok.xls|title=Főbb makrogazdasági jelzőszámok (Main Macroeconomic Indicators)|publisher=Ministry of Finance|language=Hungarian|format=xls|year=2009|accessdate=2009-10-31[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] According to an MNB forecast however, until 2011, the deficit will by a small margin fall short of the 3.0% criterion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mnb.hu/Resource.aspx?ResourceID=mnbfile&resourcename=infl_jelentes_2009aug_pub20090826|title=Quarterly Report on Inflation|format=PDF|publisher=Hungarian National Bank | date=August 2009 |accessdate=2009-10-31[/tpl]
Another criterion that is found lacking is the ratio of gross government debt to GDP which, since 2005, exceeds the allowed 60%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/economic_and_monetary_affairs/institutional_and_economic_framework/l25014_en.htm|title=Introducing the Euro: convergence criteria|publisher=Europa.eu|date=2006-12-07|accessdate=2009-10-31[/tpl] According to an ESA95 figure, in 2008 the ratio increased from 65.67% to 72.61%, which primarily results from the requisition of an IMF-arranged financial assistance package.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2008/car102808b.htm|title=IMF, EU, and World Bank Line Up $25 Billion for Hungary|publisher=IMF Survey Magazine|date=2008-10-28|accessdate=2009-10-31[/tpl]
Hungary’s balance of payments on its current account has been negative since 1995, around 6-8% in the 2000s[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mnb.hu/Resource.aspx?ResourceID=mnbfile&resourcename=hu0101_osszefoglalo|title=Összefoglaló makroökonómiai adatok (Summary of Macroeconomic Indicators)|format=xls|publisher=Hungarian National Bank |language=Hungarian|year=2009|accessdate=2009-10-31[/tpl] reaching a negative peak 8.5% in 2008. Still, current account deficit will expectedly decrease in the following period, as imports will diminish compared to exports as an effect of the financial crisis.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mkkt.hu/download/000/032/K%C3%B6lts%C3%A9gvet%C3%A9si%20Tan%C3%A1cs%20kiadv%C3%A1nya.pdf |title=Elemzés a makrogazdasági kilátásokról és a költségvetési kockázatokról (Essay on the Macroeconomic Outlook and Fiscal Risks) |author=Dánel Baksa et al. |date=2009-08-18 |publisher=Budget Council |format=PDF |language=Hungarian |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]

===Tax system===

In Hungary, the 1988 reform of taxes introduced a comprehensive tax system which mainly consists of central and local taxes, including a personal income tax, a corporate income tax and a value added tax.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.upm.ro/facultati_departamente/ea/RePEc/rcj09/recjurid093_3F.pdf |title=Reflection on the Hungarian Tax System and Reform Steps |author=Mihály Hőgye |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl] Among the total tax income the ratio of local taxes is solely 5% while the EU average is 30%.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.euvonal.hu/index.php?op=gazdasag&id=35 |title=Adózás (Taxation) |language=Hungarian |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]
The central tax system consists of three components:
Personal income tax
Until 2010, the taxation of an individual was progressive, determining the tax rate based on the individual’s income: with earning up to 1,900,000 forints a year, the tax was 18%, the tax on incomes above this limit was 36% since 1 of July, 2009.[tpl]cite web |url=http://en.apeh.hu/taxation/summary_individuals.html |title=Short summary on the taxation of individuals |date=2009-07-01 |publisher=Tax and Financial Control Administration |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]
Based on the new one-rate tax regime introduced January 2011, the overall tax rate for all income-earnings bands has been 16%.
According to the income-tax returns of 2008, 14,6% of taxpayers was charged for 64,5% of the total tax burdens.[tpl]cite web |url=http://adougyek.hu/tart/cikk/ca/0/53307/1/adougyek/APEH_az_hogy_kevesen_fizetnek_sok_adot_nem_magyar_sajatossag |title=Az adózók 24 százléka vall minimálbért (24% of Taxpayers Claim They're on Minimum Wage) |date=2009-09-02 |publisher=Hungarian News Agency Corp. |language=Hungarian |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]
Corporate income tax
Before the new Corporate income tax regime, the Corporate tax was fixed at 16% of the positive rateable value, with an additional tax called solidarity tax of 4%, the measure of which is calculated based on the result before tax of the company (the solidarity tax has been in use since September, 2006). The actual rateable value might be different is the two cases.
Form January 2011, under the new Corporate income tax regime the tax rate was divided into two parts (i) corporations having income before tax below 500 million HUF (appr. USD 2.5 million) was lowered to 10% and (ii) 16% remained for all other companies until 2013. After this, the unified corporate income tax rate will be 10%, irrespectively from the size of the net income before tax.
Value added tax (VAT)
The rate of value added tax in Hungary is 27%, the highest in Europe, since 1 of January, 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deloittetax.at/2012/01/18/hungary-corporate-income-tax-and-vat-changes-2012/ |title=Deloitte Tax News » Hungary: Corporate Income Tax and VAT changes 2012 |publisher=Deloittetax.at |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2012-04-02[/tpl]

===The EU===

Hungary joined the European Union on 05/01/2004 after a successful referendum[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.valasztas.hu/en/ep2009/199/199_0.html |title=Referendum on the accesion to the European Union 2003 |date=2003-04-12 |publisher=National Election Office |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl] among the EU-10. The EU's free trade system helps Hungary, as it is a relatively small country and thus needs export and import.
After the accession to the EU, Hungarian workers could immediately go to work to Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Other countries imposed restrictions.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3513889.stm |title=EU free movement of labour map |date=2009-04-17 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2010-01-18 | location=London[/tpl]

===Rest of the world===

===Foreign trade===

In 2007, 25% of all exports of Hungary were of high technology, which is the 5th largest ratio in the European Union after Malta, Cyprus, Ireland, and the Netherlands. The EU10 average was 17.1% and the Eurozone average was 16% in 2007.
