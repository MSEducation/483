[[Industrial Scars]]

CATEGORIES: Environmentalism, Photography exhibitions

Industrial Scars is an environmental photography project by J Henry Fair, which explores the detritus of our consumer society, through large-scale aerial photo shoots and accompanying documentary research. Industrial Scars subjects range from oil drilling and coal ash waste to large-scale agricultural production and abandoned mining operations. In small airplanes, Fair circles above industrial areas and photographs with a bird's eye perspective the effects these operations have on our environment. Topics of particular interest to Fair include the global warming process, environmental pollution, and habitat destruction - all of which are illustrated in Fair's photographs.
With his photos, Fair has called attention to environmental and political problems in different regions of the world. Fair has had touring photography exhibits in the USA, Europe, and Asia. Additionally, he travels around the world, giving environmental symposia to teach audiences about consumer responsibility and environmental awareness. Images from the Industrial Scars series have been published in National Geographic Magazine, TIME Magazine, New York Magazine, and were featured on the TODAY Show.
