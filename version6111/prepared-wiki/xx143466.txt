==Permaculture Research Institute==

In October 1997 Bill Mollison, upon his retirement, asked Geoff to establish and direct a new permaculture research institute on the [tpl]convert|147|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] Tagari Farm. Lawton developed the site over a period of three years and established The Permaculture Research Institute as a global networking centre for permaculture projects. The institute is a non-profit company limited by guarantee. It is currently located at Zaytuna Farm at The Channon in Northern NSW, Australia where Lawton is managing director.
The institute has since founded PRI USA, which is a registered charity - a tax-exempt organization under ยง501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Other permaculture research institutes that have been launched or are  in the process of being launched include: PRI Jordan, PRI Canada, PRI Chile, PRI Turkey and PRI Afghanistan.
