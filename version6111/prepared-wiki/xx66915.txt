Sarcoidosis (from sarc meaning "flesh", -oid, "like", and -osis, "diseased or abnormal condition"), also called sarcoid, is a disease involving abnormal collections of inflammatory cells (granulomas) that can form as nodules in multiple organs.[tpl]cite web|title=Sarcoidosis: Interstitial Lung Diseases: Merck Manual Home Edition|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/lung_and_airway_disorders/interstitial_lung_diseases/sarcoidosis.html|date=March 2008|accessdate=19 February 2014|author=King, TE, Jr.|work=The Merck Manual Home Edition|publisher=Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp[/tpl]  The granulomas are most often located in the lungs or its associated lymph nodes, but any organ can be affected.[tpl]cite isbn|9780071748896[/tpl] Sarcoidosis seems to be caused by an immune reaction to an infection or some other trigger (called an antigen, which may be from one's environment) that continues even after the initial infection or other antigen is cleared from the body.[tpl]cite journal|last=Baughman|first=RP|coauthors=Culver, DA; Judson, MA|title=A concise review of pulmonary sarcoidosis|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=March 2011|volume=183|issue=5|pages=573–81|doi=10.1164/rccm.201006-0865CI|pmid=21037016|pmc=3081278[/tpl] In most cases it clears up by itself without any medical intervention, despite this some cases do go on to affect the person long-term or become life-threatening and require medical intervention, most often with medications. With an average mortality rate of less than 5% in untreated cases.
Treatment is usually designed to help relieve the symptoms and hence do not directly alter the course of the disease. This treatment usually consists of drugs like ibuprofen or aspirin. In cases where the condition develops on a progressive and/or life-threatening course the treatment is most often steroid treatment with prednisone or prednisolone. Alternatively, drugs that are most commonly used to treat cancer and suppress the immune system, such as methotrexate, azathioprine and leflunomide may be used.
In the United States it most commonly affects people of Northern European (especially Scandinavian or Icelandish) or African (especially African American) ancestry between the ages of 20 and 29, although any race or age group can be affected. Japan has a lower rate of sarcoidosis than the United States, although in these people the disease is usually more aggressive in its course with the heart often affected. Japanese individuals also have a different peak age for sarcoidosis, namely 25–40 years of age.[tpl]cite web|title=Sarcoidosis|url=http://www.lung.org/assets/documents/publications/solddc-chapters/sarcoidosis.pdf|work=State of Lung Disease in Diverse Communities|publisher=American Lung Association|accessdate=21 February 2014|format=PDF|year=2010[/tpl] It occurs more commonly in women too, with the female-to-male being roughly 2:1, it also usually takes a more aggressive course in women. In developing countries it often goes misdiagnosed as tuberculosis (TB) as its symptoms often resemble those of TB.
It was first described in 1877 by an English doctor named Dr. Jonathan Hutchinson as a skin disease causing red, raised lesions on the arms, face and hands.[tpl]cite journal|last=James|first=DG|coauthors=Sharma, OP|title=From Hutchinson to now: a historical glimpse.|journal=Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine|date=September 2002|volume=8|issue=5|pages=416–23|doi=10.1097/01.MCP.0000020256.35153.12|pmid=12172446|url=http://www.ildcare.eu/Downloads/artseninfo/History_of_sarcoidosis.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl]

==Signs and symptoms==

Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ, although it can be asymptomatic and is discovered by accident in about 5% of cases.[tpl]cite web|title=Sarcoidosis Clinical Presentation|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=19 February 2014|date=6 February 2014|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/301914-clinical#showall|author=Kamangar, N; Rohani, P; Shorr, AF|editor=Peters, SP; Talavera, F; Rice, TD; Mosenifar, Z[/tpl] Common symptoms, which tend to be vague, include fatigue (unrelieved by sleep; occurs in 66% of cases), lack of energy, weight loss, joint aches and pains (which occur in about 70% of cases), arthritis (14–38% of persons), dry eyes, swelling of the knees, blurry vision, shortness of breath, a dry, hacking cough, or skin lesions.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sweiss|first=NJ|coauthors=Patterson, K; Sawaqed, R; Jabbar, U; Korsten, P; Hogarth, K; Wollman, R; Garcia, JG; Niewold, TB; Baughman, RP|title=Rheumatologic manifestations of sarcoidosis.|journal=Seminars in Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=August 2010|volume=31|issue=4|pages=463–73|doi=10.1055/s-0030-1262214|pmid=20665396|pmc=3314339[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Dempsey|first=OJ|coauthors=Paterson, EW; Kerr, KM; Denison, AR|title=Sarcoidosis.|journal=BMJ|date=28 August 2009|volume=339|pages=b3206|doi=10.1136/bmj.b3206|pmid=19717499[/tpl] Less commonly, people may cough up blood. The cutaneous symptoms vary, and range from rashes and noduli (small bumps) to erythema nodosum, granuloma annulare or lupus pernio. Sarcoidosis and cancer may mimic one another, making the distinction difficult.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tolaney SM, Colson YL, Gill RR, et al. |title=Sarcoidosis mimicking metastatic breast cancer |journal=Clin. Breast Cancer |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=804–10 |date=October 2007 |pmid=18021484|doi=10.3816/CBC.2007.n.044|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1526-8209(11)70784-4[/tpl]
The combination of erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and joint pain is called Löfgren syndrome which has a relatively good prognosis. This form of the disease occurs significantly more commonly in Scandinavian patients, than in those of non-Scandinavian origin.

===Respiratory tract===

Localization to the lungs is by far the most common manifestation of sarcoidosis.[tpl]cite journal|last=Baughman|first=RP|coauthors=Lower, EE; Gibson, K|title=Pulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis.|journal=Presse medicale|date=June 2012|volume=41|issue=6 Pt 2|pages=e289–302|doi=10.1016/j.lpm.2012.03.019|pmid=22579234[/tpl] At least 90% of affected persons experience lung involvement. Overall, about 50% develop permanent pulmonary abnormalities, and 5 to 15% have progressive fibrosis of the lung parenchyma. Sarcoidosis of the lung is primarily an interstitial lung disease in which the inflammatory process involves the alveoli, small bronchi and small blood vessels.[tpl]cite journal|last=Fuhrer|first=G|coauthors=Myers, JN|title=Intrathoracic sarcoidosis.|journal=Disease-a-month|date=November 2009|volume=55|issue=11|pages=661–74|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2009.04.009|pmid=19857641[/tpl] In acute and subacute cases,  physical examination usually reveals dry rales. At least 5% of persons will suffer pulmonary arterial hypertension.[tpl]cite journal|last=Nunes|first=H|coauthors=Uzunhan, Y; Freynet, O; Humbert, M; Brillet, PY; Kambouchner, M; Valeyre, D|title=Pulmonary hypertension complicating sarcoidosis.|journal=Presse medicale|date=June 2012|volume=41|issue=6 Pt 2|pages=e303–16|doi=10.1016/j.lpm.2012.04.003|pmid=22608948[/tpl] Less commonly, the upper respiratory tract (including the larynx, pharynx and sinuses) may be affected, which occurs in between 5 and 10% of cases.
Sarcoidosis of the lungs can be divided into four stages.  Stage 0 — No intrathoracic involvement.  Stage I — Bilateral hilar adenopathy. Stage II — Pulmonary parenchyma involved.  Stage III — Pulmonary infiltrates with fibrosis. Stage 4 is end-stage lung disease with pulmonary fibrosis and honeycombing.Wasfi YS, Fontenot AP. Chapter 12. Sarcoidosis.

===Skin===

Sarcoidosis involves the skin in between 9 and 37% of persons and is more common in African Americans than in their white counterparts. The skin is the second most commonly affected organ, after the lungs. The most common lesions are erythema nodosum, plaques, maculopapular eruptions, subcutaneous nodules and lupus pernio.[tpl]cite journal|last=Mañá|first=J|coauthors=Marcoval, J|title=Skin manifestations of sarcoidosis.|journal=Presse medicale|date=June 2012|volume=41|issue=6 Pt 2|pages=e355–74|doi=10.1016/j.lpm.2012.02.046|pmid=22579238[/tpl] Treatment is not required, since the lesions usually resolve spontaneously in two to four weeks. Although it may be disfiguring, cutaneous sarcoidosis rarely causes major problems.[tpl]cite journal|last=Heath|first=CR|coauthors=David, J; Taylor, SC|title=Sarcoidosis: Are there differences in your skin of color patients?|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|date=January 2012|volume=66|issue=1|pages=121.e1–14|doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2010.06.068|pmid=22000704[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Lodha|first=S|coauthors=Sanchez, M; Prystowsky, S|title=Sarcoidosis of the skin: a review for the pulmonologist.|journal=Chest|date=August 2009|volume=136|issue=2|pages=583–96|doi=10.1378/chest.08-1527|pmid=19666758|url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/data/Journals/CHEST/22153/zcb00809000583.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] Sarcoidosis of the scalp presents with diffuse or patchy hair loss.[tpl]cite book|last=James|first=WD; Berger, T; Dirk, M|title=Andrew's diseases of the skin: clinical dermatology|year=2006|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0808923510|edition=10th |pages=708–711[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=House|first=NS|coauthors=Welsh, JP; English JC, 3rd|title=Sarcoidosis-induced alopecia.|journal=Dermatology Online Journal|date=15 August 2012|volume=18|issue=8|pages=4|pmid=22948054|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0fp92370[/tpl]

===Heart===

The frequency of cardiac involvement varies and is significantly influenced by race; in Japan over 25% of persons with sarcoidosis experience symptomatic cardiac involvement, whereas in the US and Europe only about 5% of cases present with cardiac involvement. Autopsy studies in the US have revealed an frequency of cardiac involvement of about 20–30%, whereas autopsy studies in Japan have shown a frequency of 60%. The presentation of cardiac sarcoidosis can range from asymptomatic conduction abnormalities to fatal ventricular arrhythmia.[tpl]cite doi|10.1136/hrt.2005.080481[/tpl] Conduction abnormalities are the most common cardiac manifestations of sarcoidosis among persons and can include complete heart block.[tpl]cite journal|last=Youssef|first=G|coauthors=Beanlands, RS; Birnie, DH; Nery, PB|title=Cardiac sarcoidosis: applications of imaging in diagnosis and directing treatment.|journal=Heart|date=December 2011|volume=97|issue=24|pages=2078–87|doi=10.1136/hrt.2011.226076|pmid=22116891[/tpl] Second to conduction abnormalities, in frequency, are ventricular arrhythmias and occurs in about 23% of persons with cardiac involvement. Sudden cardiac death, either due to ventricular arrhythmias or complete heart block is a rare complication of cardiac sarcoidosis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Reuhl J, Schneider M, Sievert H, Lutz FU, Zieger G |title=Myocardial sarcoidosis as a rare cause of sudden cardiac death |journal=Forensic Sci.

===Eye===

Eye involvement occurs in about 11–83% of cases. Manifestations in the eye include uveitis, uveoparotitis, and retinal inflammation, which may result in loss of visual acuity or blindness.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bodaghi|first=B|coauthors=Touitou, V; Fardeau, C; Chapelon, C; LeHoang, P|title=Ocular sarcoidosis.|journal=Presse medicale|date=June 2012|volume=41|issue=6 Pt 2|pages=e349–54|doi=10.1016/j.lpm.2012.04.004|pmid=22595776[/tpl] The most common ophthalmologic manifestation of sarcoidosis is uveitis.[tpl]cite journal|last=Papadia|first=M|coauthors=Herbort, CP; Mochizuki, M|title=Diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis.|journal=Ocular Immunology and Inflammation|date=December 2010|volume=18|issue=6|pages=432–41|doi=10.3109/09273948.2010.524344|pmid=21091056[/tpl] The combination of anterior uveitis, parotitis, VII cranial nerve paralysis and fever is called uveoparotid fever ([tpl]ICD10|D|86|8|d|80[/tpl]).

===Nervous system===

Any of the components of the nervous system can be involved.[tpl]cite journal|last=Nozaki|first=K|coauthors=Judson, MA|title=Neurosarcoidosis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment.|journal=Presse medicale|date=June 2012|volume=41|issue=6 Pt 2|pages=e331–48|doi=10.1016/j.lpm.2011.12.017|pmid=22595777[/tpl] Sarcoidosis affecting the nervous system is known as neurosarcoidosis. Cranial nerves are most commonly affected, accounting for about 5–30% of neurosarcoidosis cases, and peripheral facial nerve palsy, often bilateral, is the most common neurological manifestation of sarcoidosis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Said G, Lacroix C, Plante-Bordeneuve V |title=Nerve granulomas and vasculitis in sarcoid peripheral neuropathy |journal=Brain |volume=125 |year=2002 |pmid=11844727|issue=Pt 2 |pages=264–75 |doi=10.1093/brain/awf027[/tpl] It occurs suddenly and is usually transient. The central nervous system involvement is present in 10–25% of sarcoidosis cases.[tpl]cite journal|last=Chen|first=ES|coauthors=Moller, DR|title=Sarcoidosis—scientific progress and clinical challenges.|journal=Nature reviews. Rheumatology|date=12 July 2011|volume=7|issue=8|pages=457–67|doi=10.1038/nrrheum.2011.93|pmid=21750528[/tpl] Other common manifestations of neurosarcoid include optic nerve dysfunction, papilledema, palate dysfunction, neuroendocrine changes, hearing abnormalities, hypothalamic and pituitary abnormalities, chronic meningitis, and peripheral neuropathy. Myelopathy, that is spinal cord involvement, occurs in about 16–43% of neurosarcoidosis cases and is often associated with the poorest prognosis of the neurosarcoidosis subtypes. Whereas facial nerve palsies and acute meningitis due to sarcoidosis tends to have the most favourable prognosis. Another common finding in sarcoidosis with neurological involvement is autonomic or sensory small fiber neuropathy.[tpl]cite pmid|21298560[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Heij|first=L|coauthors=Dahan, A; Hoitsma, E|title=Sarcoidosis and Pain Caused by Small-Fiber Neuropathy|journal=Pain Research and Treatment|year=2012|volume=2012|pages=256024|doi=10.1155/2012/256024|pmid=23304492|pmc=3523152[/tpl] Neuroendocrine sarcoidosis accounts for about 5–10% of neurosarcoidosis cases and can lead to diabetes insipidus, changes in menstrual cycle and hypothalamic dysfunction.[tpl]cite journal|last=Vardhanabhuti|first=V|coauthors=Venkatanarasimha, N; Bhatnagar, G; Maviki, M; Iyengar, S; Adams, WM; Suresh, P|title=Extra-pulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis.|journal=Clinical Radiology|date=March 2012|volume=67|issue=3|pages=263–76|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2011.04.018|pmid=22094184|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000992601100420X/pdfft?md5=3711dd60c4e5a986eb13602866d864b6&pid=1-s2.0-S000992601100420X-main.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] The latter can lead to changes in body temperature, mood and prolactin (see the endocrine and exocrine section for details).

===Endocrine and exocrine===

Prolactin is frequently increased in sarcoidosis, between 3% and 32% of cases have hyperprolactinemia[tpl]cite journal|author=Porter N, Beynon HL, Randeva HS |title=Endocrine and reproductive manifestations of sarcoidosis |journal=QJM|volume=96|issue=8|pages=553–61 |year=2003 |pmid=12897340 |doi= 10.1093/qjmed/hcg103|url=http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12897340[/tpl] this frequently leads to amenorrhea, galactorrhea or nonpuerperal mastitis in women. It also frequently causes an increase in vitamin D production outside the kidney, namely inside the immune cells found in the granulomas the condition produces.[tpl]cite journal |author=Barbour GL, Coburn JW, Slatopolsky E, Norman AW, Horst RL |title=Hypercalcemia in an anephric patient with sarcoidosis: evidence for extrarenal generation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=305|issue=8 |pages=440–3 |date=August 1981|pmid=6894783|doi=10.1056/NEJM198108203050807|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJM198108203050807[/tpl] Hypercalciuria (excessive secretion of calcium in one's urine) and hypercalcemia (an excessively high amount of calcium in the blood) are seen in Parotid enlargement occurs in about 5–10% of persons. Bilateral involvement is the rule. The gland is usually not tender, but firm and smooth. Dry mouth can occur; other exocrine glands are affected only rarely. The eyes, their glands or the parotid glands are affected in 20%-50% of cases.

===Gastrointestinal and genitourinary===

Symptomatic GI involvement occurs in less than 1% of persons (note that this is if one excludes the liver), and most commonly the stomach is affected, although the small or large intestine may also be affected in a small portion of cases. Studies at autopsy have revealed GI involvement in less than 10% of people. These cases would likely mimic Crohn's disease, which is a more commonly intestine-affecting granulomatous disease. About 1–3% of people have evidence of pancreatic involvement at autopsy. Symptomatic kidney involvement occurs in just 0.7% of cases, although evidence of kidney involvement at autopsy has been reported in up to 22% of people and occurs exclusively in cases of chronic disease.[tpl]cite journal|last=Holmes|first=J|coauthors=Lazarus, A|title=Sarcoidosis: extrathoracic manifestations.|journal=Disease-a-month|date=November 2009|volume=55|issue=11|pages=675–92|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2009.05.002|pmid=19857642[/tpl] Symptomatic kidney involvement is usually nephrocalcinosis, although granulomatous interstitial nephritis that presents with reduced creatinine clearance and little proteinuria is a close second. Less commonly, the epididymis, testicles, prostate, ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus or the vulva may be affected, the latter may cause vulva itchiness.[tpl]cite journal|last=Vera|first=C|coauthors=Funaro, D; Bouffard, D|title=Vulvar sarcoidosis: case report and review of the literature.|journal=Journal of Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery|date=July–August 2013|volume=17|issue=4|pages=287–90|pmid=23815963[/tpl] Testicular involvement has been reported in about 5% of people at autopsy. In males, sarcoidosis may lead to infertility.
Around 70% of people have granulomas in their livers, although only in about 20–30% of cases liver function test anomalies reflecting this fact are seen. About 5–15% of persons exhibit hepatomegaly, that is an enlarged liver. Only 5–30% of cases of liver involvement are symptomatic.[tpl]cite journal|last=Cremers|first=JP|coauthors=Drent, M; Baughman, RP; Wijnen, PA; Koek, GH|title=Therapeutic approach of hepatic sarcoidosis |journal=Curr Opin Pulm Med |date=September 2012|volume=18|issue=5|pages=472–82|pmid=22617809 |doi=10.1097/MCP.0b013e3283541626[/tpl] Usually, these changes reflect a cholestatic pattern and include raised levels of alkaline phosphatase (which is the most common liver function test anomaly seen in persons with sarcoidosis), while bilirubin and aminotransferases are only mildly elevated. Jaundice is rare.

===Hematologic and immunologic===

Abnormal clinical blood tests are frequent, accounting for over 50% of cases, but is not diagnostic. Lymphopenia is the most common hematologic anomaly in sarcoidosis. Anemia occurs in about 20% of people with sarcoidosis. Leukopenia is less common and occurs in even fewer persons but is rarely severe. Thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia are fairly rare. In the absence of splenomegaly, leukopenia may reflect bone marrow involvement, but the most common mechanism is a redistribution of blood T cells to sites of disease.[tpl]cite journal|title=Statement on Sarcoidosis|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=August 1999|volume=160|issue=2|pages=736–755|doi=10.1164/ajrccm.160.2.ats4-99|pmid=10430755|url=http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1164/ajrccm.160.2.ats4-99|format=PDF[/tpl] Other nonspecific findings include monocytosis, occurring in the majority of sarcoidosis cases,[tpl]Cite journal | title = Immuno-cytological blood tests in cases of sarcoidosis | journal = Sarcoidosis |volume=3 |issue=1 | pages = 52–9 |date=March 1986 | pmid = 3033787 | last1 = Wurm| first1 = K | last2 = Löhr | first2 = G [/tpl] increased hepatic enzymes or alkaline phosphatase. People with sarcoidosis often have immunologic anomalies like allergies to test antigens such as Candida or purified protein derivative (PPD). Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia is also a fairly common immunologic anomaly seen in sarcoidosis.[tpl]cite isbn|9780721601878|pages=737–9[/tpl]
Lymphadenopathy (swollen glands) is common in sarcoidosis and occurs in 15% of cases. Intrathoracic nodes are enlarged in 75 to 90% of all people; usually this involves the hilar nodes, but the paratracheal nodes are commonly involved. Peripheral lymphadenopathy is very common, particularly involving the cervical (the most common head and neck manifestation of the disease), axillary, epitrochlear, and inguinal nodes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chen HC, Kang BH, Lai CT, Lin YS |title=Sarcoidal granuloma in cervical lymph nodes|journal=Journal of the Chinese Medical Association |volume=68 |issue=7|pages=339–42|date=July 2005 |pmid=16038376|doi=10.1016/S1726-4901(09)70172-8[/tpl] Approximately 75% of cases show microscopic involvement of the spleen, although only in about 5–10% of cases does splenomegaly appear.

===Bone, joints and muscles===

Bone involvement in sarcoidosis has been reported in 1–13% of cases. About 5–15% of cases affect the bones, joints or muscles.

==Causes==

The exact cause of sarcoidosis is not known. The current working hypothesis is, in genetically susceptible individuals, sarcoidosis is caused through alteration to the immune response after exposure to an environmental, occupational, or infectious agent.[tpl]cite journal|author=Rossman MD, Kreider ME |title=Lesson learned from ACCESS (A Case Controlled Etiologic Study of Sarcoidosis) |journal=Proc Am Thorac Soc |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=453–6 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17684288 |doi=10.1513/pats.200607-138MS [/tpl] Some cases may be caused by treatment with TNF inhibitors like etanercept.[tpl]cite journal|last=Cathcart|first=S|coauthors=Sami, N; Elewski, B|title=Sarcoidosis as an adverse effect of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors.|journal=Journal of Drugs in Dermatology|date=May 2012|volume=11|issue=5|pages=609–12|pmid=22527429[/tpl]

===Genetics===

The heritability of sarcoidosis varies according to race, about 20% of African Americans with sarcoidosis have a family member with the condition, whereas the same figure for whites is about 5%.[tpl]cite web|title=Sarcoidosis|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=19 February 2014|date=6 February 2014|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/301914-overview#showall|author=Kamangar, N; Rohani, P; Shorr, AF|editor=Peters, SP; Talavera, F; Rice, TD; Mosenifar, Z[/tpl] Investigations of genetic susceptibility yielded many candidate genes, but only few were confirmed by further investigations and no reliable genetic markers are known.

===Infectious agents===

Several infectious agents appear to be significantly associated with sarcoidosis, but none of the known associations is specific enough to suggest a direct causative role.[tpl]cite journal|last=Saidha|first=S|coauthors=Sotirchos, ES; Eckstein, C|title=Etiology of sarcoidosis: does infection play a role?|journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine|date=March 2012|volume=85|issue=1|pages=133–41|pmid=22461752|pmc=3313528[/tpl] The major implicated infectious agents include: mycobacteria, fungi, borrelia and rickettsia. A recent meta-analysis investigating the role of mycobacteria in sarcoidosis found it was present in 26.4% of cases, but the meta-analysis also detected a possible publication bias, so the results need further confirmation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gupta D, Agarwal R, Aggarwal AN, Jindal SK |title=Molecular evidence for the role of mycobacteria in sarcoidosis: a meta-analysis |journal=Eur.

===Autoimmune===

Association of autoimmune disorders has been frequently observed. The exact mechanism of this relation is not known, but some evidence supports the hypothesis that this is a consequence of Th1 lymphokine prevalence.[tpl]cite journal |author=Romagnani S |title=The Th1/Th2 paradigm |journal=Immunol. Today |volume=18|issue=6|pages=263–6 |date=June 1997 |pmid=9190109 |doi= 10.1016/S0167-5699(97)80019-9|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167569997800199[/tpl] Tests of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity have been used to measure progression.[tpl]cite journal |author=Morell F, Levy G, Orriols R, Ferrer J, De Gracia J, Sampol G|title=Delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity tests and lymphopenia as activity markers in sarcoidosis|journal=Chest |volume=121 |issue=4|pages=1239–44 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11948059 |doi= 10.1378/chest.121.4.1239|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11948059[/tpl]

==Pathophysiology==

Granulomatous inflammation is characterized primarily by accumulation of monocytes, macrophages and activated T-lymphocytes, with increased production of key inflammatory mediators, TNF, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, IL-23 and TGF-β, indicative of a Th1-mediated immune response.[tpl]cite journal|last=Müller-Quernheim|first=J|coauthors=Prasse, A; Zissel, G|title=Pathogenesis of sarcoidosis.|journal=Presse medicale|date=June 2012|volume=41|issue=6 Pt 2|pages=e275–87|doi=10.1016/j.lpm.2012.03.018|pmid=22595775[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Bargagli|first=E|coauthors=Olivieri, C; Rottoli, P|title=Cytokine modulators in the treatment of sarcoidosis.|journal=Rheumatology International|date=December 2011|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1539–44|doi=10.1007/s00296-011-1969-9|pmid=21644041[/tpl] Sarcoidosis has paradoxical effects on inflammatory processes; it is characterized by increased macrophage and CD4 helper T-cell activation, resulting in accelerated inflammation, but immune response to antigen challenges such as tuberculin is suppressed. This paradoxic state of simultaneous hyper- and hypoactivity is suggestive of a state of anergy. The anergy may also be responsible for the increased risk of infections and cancer. The regulatory T-lymphocytes in the periphery of sarcoid granulomas appear to suppress IL-2 secretion, which is hypothesized to cause the state of anergy by preventing antigen-specific memory responses.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kettritz R, Goebel U, Fiebeler A, Schneider W, Luft F |title=The protean face of sarcoidosis revisited |journal=Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation |volume=21 |issue=10|pages=2690–4|date=October 2006 |pmid=16861724 |doi=10.1093/ndt/gfl369 |url=http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/10/2690.full.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] Schaumann bodies seen in sarcoidosis are calcium and protein inclusions inside of Langhans giant cells as part of a granuloma. While TNF is widely believed to play an important role in the formation of granulomas (which is further supported by the finding that in animal models of mycobacterial granuloma formation inhibition of either TNF or IFN-γ production inhibits granuloma formation), sarcoidosis can and do still develop in persons being treated with TNF antagonists like etanercept.[tpl]cite journal | author=Verschueren K, Van Essche E, Verschueren P, Taelman V, Westhovens R | title=Development of sarcoidosis in etanercept-treated rheumatoid arthritis patients |journal=Clin. Rheumatol. |volume=26 | issue=11 | pages=1969–71 |date=November 2007 | pmid=17340045 | doi=10.1007/s10067-007-0594-1 [/tpl] B cells also likely play a role in the pathophysiology of sarcoidosis. Serum levels of soluble HLA class I antigens and ACE are higher in persons with sarcoidosis. Likewise the ratio of CD4/CD8 T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage is usually higher in persons with pulmonary sarcoidosis (usually >3.5), although it can be normal or even abnormally low in some cases. Serum ACE levels have been found to usually correlate with total granuloma load.
Cases of sarcoidosis have also been reported as part of the immune reconstitution syndrome of HIV, that is, when people receive treatment for HIV their immune system rebounds and the result is that it starts to attack the antigens of opportunistic infections caught prior to said rebound and the resulting immune response starts to damage healthy tissue.
