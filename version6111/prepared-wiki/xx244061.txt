[[Queen Bower]]

CATEGORIES: Hamlets on the Isle of Wight

Queen Bower is an area which lies north of Borthwood on the Isle of Wight.

==History==

It is believed to be named after Isabella de Fortibus who in the 12th century was the 'Lady of The Isle (of Wight)' as she inherited it in 1262 from her brother Baldwin de Redvers, 7th Earl of Devon. Although somewhere along the line between then and the present, the name has become lost in translation as it is believed to have been originally known as 'Queen Dower' as the land was passed down to her.
Queen Bower is merged into Borthwood, Winford and Apse Heath and is classed as part of Sandown, with the postcode PO36.
The area is home to the 'Queen Bower Dairy' farm which is also a caravan park as the surrounding area is popular with tourists due to its beautiful and unspoilt green meades, pastures and the National Trust site of Borthwood Copse, which was originally a royal hunting ground.
The area is also home to the 'Isle of Wight Cheese Company' which gets its milk from the above mentioned dairy farm.
Queen Bower is a Red Squirrel zone.

==Transport==

Transport is provided by Southern Vectis bus route 8 to Sandown, which stops at Hairpin Bend on Alverstone Road once every hour throughout the day, which is right on the perimeter of Borthwood Copse.
