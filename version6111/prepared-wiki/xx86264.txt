The Triangle J Council of Governments is one of the 17 regional North Carolina Councils of Governments (Region J) established by the North Carolina General Assembly for the purpose of regional planning and administration. Headquartered in Durham, North Carolina, it serves Moore, Lee, Chatham, Orange, Durham, Wake, and Johnston counties.

==History==

The TJCOG was originally established in 1959 by the Research Triangle Foundation as the Research Triangle Regional Planning Commission. The commission's original members were Durham, Orange and Wake counties, and the cities of Chapel Hill, Durham, and Raleigh.
When the North Carolina General Assembly established 18 regional planning councils in 1972, the Research Triangle Regional Planning Commission was reorganized as the planning council for Region J, which consisted of Durham, Orange, Wake, Chatham, Johnston and Lee counties. Moore County was added when the planning commission for Region H was abolished.
