====Biofuels====

Illinois is ranked second in corn production among U.S. states, and Illinois corn is used to produce 40% of the ethanol consumed in the United States. The Archer Daniels Midland corporation in Decatur, Illinois is the world's leading producer of ethanol from corn.
The National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC), the world's only facility dedicated to researching the ways and means of converting corn (maize) to ethanol is located on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.http://illinoisrfa.org/research/http://www.stlrcga.org/documents/corn%20to%20ethanol.pdf
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is one of the partners in the Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI), a $500 million biofuels research project funded by petroleum giant BP.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=2012968&contentId=7018719 |title=BP Pledges $500 Million for Energy Biosciences Institute and Plans New Business to Exploit Research|publisher=Bp.com |date=June 14, 2006 |accessdate=May 19, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=2&RecNum=5690 |title=Gov.

As one of the United States' major metropolises, all major sports leagues have teams headquartered in Chicago.

===Minor league teams===

Many minor league teams also call Illinois their home. They include:

===Former Chicago sports franchises===

====Folded teams====

The city was formerly home to several other teams that either failed to survive, or that belonged to leagues that folded.

====Relocated teams====

The NFL's Arizona Cardinals, who currently play in Phoenix, Arizona, played in Chicago as the Chicago Cardinals, until moving to St. Louis, Missouri after the 1959 season. An NBA expansion team known as the Chicago Packers in 1961–62 and the Chicago Zephyrs the following year moved to Baltimore after the 1962–63 season.  The franchise is now known as the Washington Wizards.

Illinois also has several short tracks and dragstrips. The dragstrip at Gateway International Raceway and the Route 66 Raceway, which sits on the same property as the Chicagoland Speedway, both host NHRA drag races.

==Parks and recreation==

The Illinois state parks system began in 1908 with what is now Fort Massac State Park, becoming the first park in a system encompassing over 60 parks and about the same number of recreational and wildlife areas.
Areas under the protection and control of the National Park Service include: the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor near Lockport;[tpl]cite web | title = Illinois & Michigan Canal | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate =July 15, 2008 | url = http://www.nps.gov/ilmi[/tpl] the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail; the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield; the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail; the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail; and the American Discovery Trail.[tpl]cite web|title = Illinois|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate =July 15, 2008|url= http://www.nps.gov/state/il[/tpl]

==Government==

The government of Illinois, under the Constitution of Illinois, has three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial. The executive branch is split into several statewide elected offices, with the Governor as chief executive. Legislative functions are granted to the Illinois General Assembly. The judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts.
The Illinois General Assembly is the state legislature, composed of the 118-member Illinois House of Representatives and the 59-member Illinois Senate. The members of the General Assembly are elected at the beginning of each even-numbered year. The Governor has different types of veto like a full veto, reduction veto, and amendatory veto, but the General Assembly has the power to override gubernatorial vetoes through a three-fifths majority vote in each chamber.
The executive branch is composed of six elected officers and their offices as well as numerous other departments. The six elected officers are the: Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, Comptroller, and Treasurer.
The government of Illinois has numerous departments, agencies, boards and commissions, but the so-called code departments provide most of the state's services.[tpl]cite book|title=Governing Illinois: Your Connection to State and Local Government|chapter=The Governor and the Executive Branch|pages=78–79|first=Judy Lee|last=Uphoff|editor1-first=Nancy S.|editor1-last=Lind|editor2-first=Erik|editor2-last=Rankin|edition=4th|publisher=Center Publications, Center for State Policy and Leadership, University of Illinois at Springfield|year=2012|isbn=978-0-938943-28-0|url=http://illinoisissues.uis.edu/images/Chapter5Draft.pdf[/tpl][tpl]ILCS|20|5[/tpl]
The Judiciary of Illinois is the unified court system of Illinois. It consists of the Supreme Court, Appellate Court, and Circuit Courts. The Supreme Court oversees the administration of the court system.
The administrative divisions of Illinois are counties, townships, precincts, cities, towns, villages, and special-purpose districts.[tpl]citation|title=Individual State Descriptions: 2007|series=2007 Census of Governments|date=November 2012|pages=89–97|publisher=United States Census Bureau|url=http://www2.census.gov/govs/cog/isd_book.pdf|ref=[tpl]harvid|Census|2007[/tpl][/tpl] The basic subdivision of Illinois are the 102 counties.[tpl]sfn|Census|2007|p=89[/tpl] 85 of the 102 counties are in turn divided into townships and precincts.[tpl]sfn|Census|2007|p=89[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url =http://www.ilsos.gov/isa/localgovnameindexsrch.jsp| title = Name Index to Illinois Local Governments| author = Illinois Regional Archives Depository System| work = Illinois State Archives| publisher = Illinois Secretary of State|accessdate=11 November 2013[/tpl] Municipal governments are the cities, villages, and incorporated towns.[tpl]sfn|Census|2007|p=89[/tpl] Localities possess "home rule", which allows them to govern themselves to a certain extent.[tpl]cite book|title=Illinois Politics and Government: The Expanding Metropolitan Frontier|first=Samuel Kimball|last=Gove|year=1996|series=Politics and Governments of the American States|pages=155–156|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-7014-3|lccn=95-46017|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9JFP49qn_wUC&pg=PA156|ref=harv[/tpl]

==Politics==

===Party balance===

Historically, Illinois was long a major swing state, with near-parity existing between the Republican and the Democratic parties. However, in recent elections, the Democratic Party has gained ground and Illinois has come to be seen as a "blue" state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0716/p01s01-uspo.html |title=Suburb shift turns state blue / The Christian Science Monitor |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=July 16, 2004 |accessdate=February 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-124280593.html |title=Chicgao's dominance puts Illinois solidly in 'blue-state' America. – Chicago Tribune (Chicago, IL)|publisher=Highbeam.com |date=November 8, 2004 |accessdate=February 7, 2011[/tpl] Chicago and most of Cook County votes have long been strongly Democratic. However, the "collar counties" (the suburbs surrounding Chicago's Cook County, Illinois), can be seen as a Republican stronghold.[tpl]cite book |title=Governor Richard Ogilvie: in the interest of the state |last=Pensoneau |first=Taylor |year=1997 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |isbn=978-0-8093-2148-3 |oclc= |page=314 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=bxNGKsylQXUC&pg=PA80&dq=kane+dupage+lake+cook+democratic&q=kane%20dupage%20lake%20cook%20democratic |accessdate=September 23, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Patchwork Nation: Sectionalism and Political Change in American Politics |last=Gimpel |first=James G. |coauthors=Jason E.

Republicans continue to prevail in the Chicago suburban "collar counties" surrounding Cook County, as well as rural northern and central Illinois; Republican support is also strong in southern Illinois, outside of the East St. Louis metropolitan area. From 1920 until 1972, the state was carried by the victor of each of these presidential elections - 14 elections.Meet the New Bellwether States: Ohio and Nevada - Smart Politics. Blog.lib.umn.edu. Retrieved on July 21, 2013. In fact, Illinois was long seen as a national bellwether,Illinois as a bellwether: So what?. Lib.niu.edu. Retrieved on July 21, 2013. supporting the winner in every election in the 20th Century except for 1916 and 1976. By contrast, Illinois has trended more toward the Democratic party and such, has voted for their presidential candidates in the last six elections; in 2000, George W. Bush became the first Republican to win the presidency without carrying Illinois or Vermont. Native son and current president Barack Obama easily won the state's 21 electoral votes in 2008, with 61.9% of the vote.

===History of corruption===

Politics in the state have been infamous for highly visible corruption cases, as well as for crusading reformers, such as governors Adlai Stevenson and James R. Thompson. In 2006, former Governor George Ryan was convicted of racketeering and bribery, leading to a 6 and a half year prison sentence. In 2008, then-Governor Rod Blagojevich was served with a criminal complaint on corruption charges, stemming from allegations that he conspired to sell the vacated Senate seat left by President Barack Obama to the highest bidder. Subsequently, on December 7, 2011, Rod Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in prison for those charges, as well as perjury while testifying during the case, totaling 18 convictions.  In the late 20th century, Congressman Dan Rostenkowski was imprisoned for mail fraud; former governor and federal judge Otto Kerner, Jr. was imprisoned for bribery; and State Auditor of Public Accounts (Comptroller) Orville Hodge was imprisoned for embezzlement. In 1912, William Lorimer, the GOP boss of Chicago, was expelled from the U.S. Senate for bribery and in 1921, Governor Len Small was found to have defrauded the state of a million dollars.[tpl]cite book |title= Grafters and Goo Goos: corruption and reform in Chicago, 1833–2003|last= Merriner|first= James L.|year= 2004|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location= Carbondale|isbn= 978-0-8093-2571-9|oclc= 52720998[/tpl]

===US Presidents from Illinois===

Three presidents have claimed Illinois as their political base: Lincoln, Grant, and Obama. Lincoln was born in Kentucky, but moved to Illinois at the age of 21; he served in the General Assembly and represented the 7th congressional district in the US House of Representatives before his election as President. Ulysses S. Grant was born in Ohio and had a military career that precluded settling down, but on the eve of the Civil War, and approaching middle age, Grant moved to Illinois and thus claimed it as his home when running for President. Barack Obama was born and raised in Hawaii (other than a four-year period of his childhood spent in Indonesia) and made Illinois his home and base after completing law school.
Only one person elected President of the United States was actually born in Illinois. Ronald Reagan was born in Tampico, raised in Dixon and educated at Eureka College. Reagan moved to Los Angeles as a young adult and later became Governor of California before being elected President.

===Black US senators===

Nine African-Americans have served as members of the United States Senate. Three of them have represented Illinois, the most of any single state: Carol Moseley-Braun, Barack Obama,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Art & History Home |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=February 7, 2011[/tpl] and Roland Burris, who was appointed to replace Obama after his election to the presidency. Moseley-Braun was the first and to date only African-American woman to become a U.S. Senator.

===Political families===

Two families from Illinois have played particularly prominent roles in the Democratic Party, gaining both statewide and national fame.

====Stevensons====

The Stevenson family, rooted in central Illinois, has provided four generations of Illinois elected leadership.

====Daleys====

The Daley family's powerbase was in Chicago.

==Education==

===Illinois State Board of education===

The Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) is autonomous of the governor and the state legislature, and administers public education in the state. Local municipalities and their respective school districts operate individual public schools but the ISBE audits performance of public schools with the Illinois School Report Card. The ISBE also makes recommendations to state leaders concerning education spending and policies.

===Primary and secondary schools===

Education is compulsory from ages 7 to 17 in Illinois. Schools are commonly but not exclusively divided into three tiers of primary and secondary education: elementary school, middle school or junior high school, and high school. District territories are often complex in structure. Many areas in the state are actually located in two school districts—one for high school, the other for elementary and middle schools. And such districts do not necessarily share boundaries. A given high school may have several elementary districts that feed into it, yet some of those feeder districts may themselves feed into multiple high school districts.

===Colleges and universities===

Using the criterion established by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, there are eleven "National Universities" in the state. [tpl]As of|2010|8|19[/tpl], five of these rank in the "first tier" (that is, the top quartile) among the top 500 National Universities in the United States, as determined by the U.S. News & World Report rankings: the University of Chicago (4), Northwestern University (12), the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (41), Loyola University Chicago (106), and the Illinois Institute of Technology (113).[tpl]cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/state+IL|title=Best Colleges 2010 – National Universities Rankings|accessdate=March 23, 2010|work=U.S. News & World Report|date=August 19, 2009[/tpl]
The University of Chicago is continuously ranked as one of the world's top ten universities on various independent university rankings and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign consistently ranks among the best engineering schools in the world and in United States.
Illinois also has more than 20 additional accredited four-year universities, both public and private, and dozens of small liberal arts colleges across the state. Additionally, Illinois supports 49 public community colleges in the Illinois Community College System.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Because of its central location and its proximity to the Rust Belt and Grain Belt, Illinois is a national crossroads for air, auto, rail, and truck traffic.

====Airports====

From 1962 until 1998, Chicago's O'Hare International Airport (ORD) was the busiest airport in the world, measured both in terms of total flights and passengers. While it was surpassed by Atlanta's Hartsfield in 1998, with 59.3 million domestic passengers annually, along with 11.4 million international passengers in 2008,[tpl]cite web|title=O'Hare International Airport Activity Statistics |url=http://www.flychicago.com/Statistics/stats/1208ORDSUMMARY-REVISED.pdf |work=|publisher=City of Chicago: FlyChicago.com |date=March 27, 2009|accessdate=April 10, 2009[/tpl] O'Hare remains one of the two or three busiest airports in the world, and some years still ranks number one in total flights. It is a major hub for United Airlines and American Airlines, and a major airport expansion project is currently underway. Chicago Midway International Airport (MDW), which had been the busiest airport in the world until supplanted by O'Hare in 1962, is now the secondary airport in the Chicago metropolitan area. For a time in the late 1960s and 1970s, Midway was nearly vacant except for general aviation, but growth in the area, combined with political deadlock over the building of a new major airport in the region, has caused a resurgence for Midway. It is now a major hub for Southwest Airlines, and services many other airlines as well. Midway served 17.3 million domestic and international passengers in 2008.[tpl]cite web|title=Midway Airport Activity Statistics|url=http://www.flychicago.com/Statistics/stats/1208SUMMARYRevised.pdf|work=FlyChicago.com|publisher=City of Chicago|date=January 30, 2009|accessdate=April 10, 2009[/tpl]

====Rail====

Illinois has an extensive passenger and freight rail transportation network. Chicago is a national Amtrak hub and in-state passengers are served by Amtrak's Illinois Service, featuring the Chicago to Carbondale Illini and Saluki, the Chicago to Quincy Carl Sandburg and Illinois Zephyr, and the Chicago to St. Louis Lincoln Service. Currently there is trackwork on the Chicago–St. Louis line to bring the maximum speed up to [tpl]convert|110|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], which would reduce the trip time by an hour and a half. Nearly every North American railway meets at Chicago, making it the largest and most active rail hub in the country. Extensive commuter rail is provided in the city proper and some immediate suburbs by the Chicago Transit Authority's 'L' system. The largest suburban commuter rail system in the United States, operated by Metra, uses existing rail lines to provide direct commuter rail access for hundreds of suburbs to the city and beyond.
In addition to the state's rail lines, the Mississippi River and Illinois River provide major transportation routes for the state's agricultural interests. Lake Michigan gives Illinois access to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the Saint Lawrence Seaway.

====Interstate highway system====

Illinois is among many US states with a well developed interstate highway system. Illinois has the distinction of having the most primary (two-digit) interstates pass through it among all the 50 states, tied with Pennsylvania with 12, as well as the 3rd most interstate mileage behind California and Texas.http://www.interstate-guide.com/state-index.html
Major U.S. Interstate highways crossing the state include: I-24, I-39, I-55, I-57, I-64, I-70, I-72, I-74, I-80, I-88, I-90, and I-94.

====U.S. highway system====

Among the U.S. highways that pass through the state, the primary ones are: US 6, US 12, US 14, US 20, US 24, US 30, US 34, US 36, US 40, US 41, US 45, US 50, US 52, US 54, US 60, and US 62.
