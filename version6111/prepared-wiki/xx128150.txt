CATEGORIES: TISM songs, List songs

Jung Talent Time is a song by Australian alternative rock band TISM. Originally released on Machiavelli and the Four Seasons (1995) it was released as an 8-track CD during the same year, featuring eight new remixes.
The title plays on the name of psychologist Carl Jung, and talent-search style television show Young Talent Time. It and track 11 from the album, "Aussiemandias", are the only songs to survive from the botched sessions from 1992 to 1993 that were originally going to be the album.[tpl]fact|date=June 2013[/tpl]

==Lyrics==

The lyrics for the song are very strange, as there is no typical song structure. It is basically a long list of names for the entire song, its not until the chorus that the meaning behind having all the names becomes clear.
Andy Warhol got it right / Everybody gets the limelight

Andy Warhol got it wrong / Fifteen minutes is too long.
Referencing Andy Warhol's famous statement that "Everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes", however TISM believe that fifteen minutes is far too long for some people to be famous, including TISM.
