Ryuichi Oda ([tpl]lang-ja|小田龍一[/tpl], born 12 December 1976) is a Japanese professional golfer who currently competes on the Japan Golf Tour.
Oda was born in Kagoshima Prefecture. He spent much of his amateur career developing his skills at the Kagoshima Country Club. He competed in two Japan Golf Tour events in 2002 (Token Corporation Cup and Tsuruya Open) and despite missing the cut on both occasions, became a professional in time for the Fujisankei Classic where he once again failed to get past the second day. It was not until the Diamond Cup Tournament before he made his first cut, finishing T55.
It was not until the 2009 Japan Open that Oda shot to fame. He only just avoided being cut after two rounds and by round three was tied for 5th place. He went on to beat Ryo Ishikawa and Yasuharu Imano in a three-man playoff.
