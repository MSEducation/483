In ancient Latvia, Lieldienas ("Easter") was the celebration of Vernal Equinox on March 23.  The celebration usually lasted three or four days; each day was devoted to a specific deity, though no source gives the names of the respective deity.  At least one day is probably dedicated to Māra.
Lieldienas was a celebration of dancing, singing and gaiety.  On the first day, the Latvians arose early and rinsed their faces in running water.[tpl]Citation |last= Mellēna|first= Māra|year=2000 |title= Latvian Seasonal Holidays|publisher= The Latvian Institute|publication-place= |page= |url= http://www.rsu.lv/eng/images/Documents/Publications/Latvian_Seasonal_Holidays.pd|accessdate=October 4, 2013 [/tpl]  Symbolically scattering evil, adults scared birds away from the homes and surroundings.
Eggs were associated with Lieldienas.  One who steals an egg will be poor.  One who eats a hard-boiled egg without salt is a liar.  A girl who gives a boy two eggs doesn't like him; three eggs mean there is a chance she likes; four eggs means she doesn't like him but will be with him because he is richer; five eggs means she loves him.
In modern Latvia, Easter is called Lieldienas.  Some of the old traditions survive and are performed at Easter.
