[[Thyrotropin receptor]]

CATEGORIES: G protein coupled receptors, Thyroid

The thyrotropin receptor (or TSH receptor) is a receptor (and associated protein) that responds to thyroid-stimulating hormone (also known as "thyrotropin") and stimulates the production of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3).  The TSH receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily of integral membrane proteins[tpl]cite journal | author = Farid NR, Szkudlinski MW | title = Minireview: structural and functional evolution of the thyrotropin receptor | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 145 | issue = 9 | pages = 4048–57 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15231707 | doi = 10.1210/en.2004-0437 [/tpl] and is coupled to the Gs protein.[tpl]cite journal | author = Calebiro D, Nikolaev VO, Lohse MJ | title = Imaging of persistent cAMP signaling by internalized G protein-coupled receptors | journal = J.

It is primarily found on the surface of the thyroid epithelial cells.

==Function==

Upon binding circulating thyrotropin, a G-protein signal cascade activates adenylyl cyclase and intercellular levels of cAMP rise. cAMP activates all functional aspects of the thyroid cell, including iodine pumping; thyroglobulin synthesis, iodination, endocytosis and proteolysis; thyroid peroxidase activity; and hormone release.
