George Jacob "G.J." Mecherle (pronounced "Ma-herl") (June 7, 1877 - March 10, 1951) was the founder of State Farm Insurance, headquartered in Bloomington, Illinois.  Mecherle, a farmer who became an insurance agent also, founded State Farm after becoming dissatisfied with the insurance rates charged to farmers, as those rates included the risks of city drives as well.
