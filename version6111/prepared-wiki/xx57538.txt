Lambert–St. Louis International Airport [tpl]Airport codes|STL|KSTL|STL[/tpl] is an international airport serving Greater St. Louis, Missouri. It is about [tpl]convert|10|mi|km|0[/tpl] northwest of downtown St. Louis in unincorporated St. Louis County between Berkeley and Bridgeton. It is the largest and busiest airport in the state with 255 daily departures to about 90 domestic and international locations. In 2011, nearly 13 million passengers traveled through the airport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flystl.com/flystl/media-newsroom/stats/|title=Passenger Statistics|publisher=Flystl.com|accessdate=November 22, 2011[/tpl] The airport serves as a focus city for Southwest Airlines and was a former hub for Trans World Airlines and former focus-city for American Airlines and AmericanConnection
Named for Albert Bond Lambert, an Olympic medalist and prominent St. Louis aviator, the airport rose to international prominence in the 20th century, thanks to its association with Charles Lindbergh, its groundbreaking air traffic control, its status as the hub of Trans World Airlines, and its iconic terminal. Designed by Minoru Yamasaki, the building inspired terminals at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City and Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport in France.

==History==

The airport grew from a balloon launching base, Kinloch Field, part of the 1890s Kinloch Park suburban development. The Wright brothers and their Exhibition Team visited the field while touring with their aircraft. During a visit to St. Louis, Theodore Roosevelt flew with pilot Arch Hoxsey on October 11, 1910, becoming the first U.S. president to fly. Later, Kinloch hosted the first experimental parachute jump.[tpl]cite news |title=Joe Gains Another Admirer: Kinloch's Sergeant of Police|first=Prince Joe|last=Henry|url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2006-12-06/news/joe-gains-another-admirer-kinloch-s-sergeant-of-police/|newspaper=River Front Times|publisher=Riverfront Times, LLC|date=December 7, 2007|accessdate=August 27, 2010[/tpl]

In February 1925, "Major" (his 'rank' was given by the Aero Club and not the military) Lambert bought the field and added hangars and a passenger terminal. Charles Lindbergh's first piloting job was flying airmail for Robertson Aircraft Corporation from Lambert Field; he left the airport for New York about a week before his record-breaking flight to Paris in 1927. Later that year, Lambert sold the airport to the City of St. Louis, making it the first municipally-owned airport in the United States.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lambert-stlouis.com/index/about_History.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050204222910/http://lambert-stlouis.com/index/about_History.html |archivedate=2005-02-04 |title=The History of Lambert - St. Louis International Airport |work= Lambert-St. Louis International Airport |accessdate=26 December 2012|publisher= Lambert-St. Louis International Airport | year=2005 | archivedate= 4 February 2005[/tpl]
In the late 1920s, Lambert Field became the first airport with an air traffic control system—albeit one that communicated with pilots via waving flags. The first controller was Archie League.[tpl]cite web |first=Roger|last=Mola|title=Aircraft Landing Technology|url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/landing_navig/Tech32.htm|work=U.

Robertson Airlines, Marquette Airlines, and Eastern Air Lines provided passenger service to St. Louis.
In 1925, the airport became home to Naval Air Station St. Louis, a Naval Air Reserve facility that became an active-duty installation during World War II.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/mo/county/stlouis/aviation/navy.htm|title=The Navy At Lambert Field, 1925-1958 by George Everding, LCDR USN (ret)|publisher=Usgennet.org|accessdate=November 22, 2011[/tpl]
During the war, the airport became a manufacturing base for McDonnell Aircraft and Curtiss-Wright.

===After World War II - Airport expansion, Ozark Airlines 1945-1982===

After the war, NAS St. Louis reverted to a reserve installation, supporting carrier-based fighters and land-based patrol aircraft. When it closed in 1958, most of its facilities were acquired by the Missouri Air National Guard and became Lambert Field Air National Guard Base. Some other facilities were retained by non-flying activities of the Naval Reserve and Marine Corps Reserve, while the rest was redeveloped to expand commercial airline operations at the airport.
To handle the increasing passenger traffic, Minoru Yamasaki was commissioned to design a new terminal at Lambert. Completed in 1956, the four-domed design inspired terminals at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City and Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport.
The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows TWA with 44 weekday departures; American, 24; Delta, 16; Ozark, 14; Eastern, 13; Braniff, six, and Central, two. The first jets were TWA 707s in July 1959.
In the 1970s St. Louis city officials proposed to replace the airport with a new one in suburban Illinois. After Missouri residents objected in 1977, Lambert received a $290-million expansion that lengthened the runways, increased the number of gates to 81, and boosted its capacity by 50 percent. (A proposed Illinois airport was later built anyway, though not near the originally proposed site; MidAmerica St. Louis Airport opened in 1997 in Mascoutah, Illinois. As of 2013 the only scheduled passenger service is nonstop flights to Orlando's Sanford Airport, operated by Allegiant Air.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/morning_call/2012/11/allegiant-air-resumes-flights-out-of.html | title=Allegiant Air resumes flights out of MidAmerica St. Louis Airport[/tpl]) Concourse A and Concourse C were rebuilt into bi-level structures equipped with jet bridges as part of a $25 million project in the mid-1970s designed by Sverdrup.

Ozark Airlines established its only hub at Lambert in the late 1950s. The airline grew rapidly, going from 36 million revenue passenger miles in 1955, to 229 million revenue passenger miles in 1965. The jet age came to Ozark in 1966 with the Douglas DC-9-10 and its network expanded to Denver, Indianapolis, Louisville, Washington, D.C., New York City, Miami, Tampa and Orlando. With the addition of jets, Ozark began its fastest period of growth, jumping to 653 million revenue passenger miles by 1970, and 936 million revenue passenger miles by 1975,Handbook of Airline Statistics (biannual CAB publication) however Ozark soon faced heavy competition in TWA's new hub at Lambert.

===TWA era 1982–2001===

In 1982, Trans World Airlines (TWA) moved its hub from Kansas City International Airport. The move made TWA the dominant carrier at Lambert, and turned the St. Louis airport into one of the busiest in the country. The hub was based in Concourse B and the newly expanded Concourse C.
In 1985, Southwest Airlines began service, an event that would lead to major changes at the airport in the coming years.
TWA's hub grew again in 1986 when the airline bought Ozark Airlines, which had its hub at Lambert's Concourse D. In 1985, TWA had accounted for 56.6% of boardings at STL while Ozark accounted for 26.3%, so the merged carriers now controlled over 80% of the traffic.Fare and Service Changes at St. Louis Since the TWA-Ozark Merger, United States General Accounting Office. Sept. 21, 1988. Retrieved July 27, 2013. As of 1986, TWA served STL with nonstop service to 84 cities, an increase from 80 cities served by TWA and/or Ozark in 1985, before the merger.
Despite the entry of Southwest Airlines in the market, the TWA buyout of Ozark and subsequent increase in the number of nonstop cities served, the total number of passengers using Lambert held steady from 1985 through 1993, ranging between 19 million and 20 million passengers per year throughout the period.
Lambert again grew in importance for TWA after the airline declared bankruptcy in 1993 and moved its headquarters to St. Louis from Mount Kisco, NY. TWA increased the number of cities served, and started routing more connecting passengers through its hub at Lambert. Total number of passengers using Lambert rose from 19.9 million passengers enplaned in 1993, jumping almost 20% in one year to 23.4 million in 1994. Growth continued, with total enplaned jumping to 27.3 million by 1997, and 30.6 million in 2000, the highest ever in its history.Lambert-St. Louis International Airport website, Historical Passenger Statistics since 1985, retrieved July 27, 2013. By the late 1990s, Lambert was TWA's dominant hub, with 515 daily flights to 104 cities as of September 1999. Of those 515 flights, 352 were on TWA mainline aircraft, and 163 were Trans World Connection flights operated by its commuter airline partners.
However, TWA faced increasing problems as overall airline demand softened in response to a softening overall economy. As TWA entered the new millennium, its financial condition proved too precarious to continue alone, and in January 2001 American Airlines (AA) announced it was buying TWA.

===American Airlines, Air National Guard, Southwest Airlines 2001-present===

American Airline's merger closed in April 2001, and the last TWA flight was flown on December 1, 2001. AA felt that TWA's Lambert hub was a key asset. Its plan for Lambert was to become a reliever hub for AA's existing hubs at Chicago O'Hare and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. American had been looking for a way to relieve its overcrowded hub at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, where nearly 40 percent of American’s flights had arrived at least 15 minutes late in June, July and August 2000. American was looking at something strategic with its new St. Louis hub to potentially offload some of the pressure on O’Hare to restore its operations to respectable levels. American Airlines shifted some flights from mainline aircraft to commuter aircraft because of softening overall airline demand, however, overall flight levels remained strong. In July 2001, TWA, now a wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines, and its regional carrier Trans World Express averaged 522 daily departures.http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg22610.html CaliforniaAviation.org, retrieved July 20, 2013
The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were a huge demand shock to air service nationwide, with total airline industry domestic revenue passenger miles dropping 20% in October 2001 and 17% in November 2001.U.S. Air Carrier Traffic Statistics - Domestic Passengers - Revenue Passenger Miles, retrieved July 27, 2013 Overnight, AA no longer had the same need for a hub that bypasses its hubs at Chicago and Dallas, which suddenly became less congested.http://www.dallasnews.com/business/airline-industry/20130126-american-airlines-battles-a-history-of-unsuccessful-mergers.ece "American Airlines, a History of Unsuccessful Mergers, Dallas News website, retrieved July 20, 2013 AA cut flights out of St. Louis from 522 daily flights as of July 2001, to approximately 450 flights as of December 2001. Flights to Paris, France went to seasonal service in December 2001, and transatlantic service was soon discontinued altogether when it stopped flying nonstop from St. Louis to London Gatwick airport. AA transferred many mainline routes to American Connection, a group of affiliated regional carriers. By June 2002, AA had further reduced service to 439 daily flights to 109 cities, however, only 276 of those flights were on AA mainline aircraft, and 163 were flown on commuter aircraft operated as American Connection. At the time, Lambert was AA's 3rd largest hub ranked by number of daily departures, and its 2nd largest hub ranked by number of destinations served. AA's largest hub at the time was DFW, with 757 daily flights to 145 destinations. AA's Chicago O'Hare hub had 489 daily flights to 102 destinations, STL had 439 flights to 109 destinations, while its Miami hub had just 236 flights to 79 destinations. Much of the reduction in overall service could be blamed on the 9/11 terrorist attacks, however, Lambert was affected disproportionately due to flight cuts and shifts of flights from mainline to commuter aircraft, because of Lambert's lessened need as a reliever hub since O'Hare was suddenly less congested.
By September 2002, Lambert's passenger traffic had declined by 16.9% from before the terrorist attacks a year earlier, which was the 8th biggest percentage drop of the major US airports. Total passengers enplaned for the year fell to 25.6 million. AA's other hubs suffered from reduced traffic, but to a lesser degree with the exception of Miami, which suffered from a 16.0% decline. New York JFK's traffic dropped 12.6%, DFW traffic dropped 6.7%, O'Hare traffic dropped 6.5%.USA Today, retrieved July 20, 2013 Even though O'Hare's drop in traffic was the lowest, the 6.5% reduction at O'Hare was enough to virtually eliminate its previous problems with congestion-related delays that suffered from prior to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, removing a main purpose for AA's St. Louis hub. As a result of the reduced congestion at O'Hare, Congress eliminated all slot restrictions at O'Hare in July 2002.Department of Justice, Congestion and Delay Reductions at O'Hare Airport, retrieved July 20, 2013.
On July 16, 2003, AA announced it was significantly reducing its Lambert hub effective November 1, 2003, cutting it from 417 daily flights to 207, effective November 1, 2003.Travel Weekly website, retrieved July 20, 2013. Total Lambert passengers enplaned dropped to 20.4 million in 2003, then to 13.4 million in 2004. AA introduced American Eagle service at its St. Louis hub in May 2005. Unlike American Connection, American Eagle operated by Envoy Air is wholly owned by American Airlines Group, the parent company of American Airlines and Envoy Air.
In 2006, the United States Air Force announced plans to turn the 131st Fighter Wing of the Missouri Air National Guard into the 131st Bomb Wing. The wing's 20 F-15C and F-15D aircraft were moved to the Montana Air National Guard's 120th Fighter Wing at Great Falls International Airport/Air National Guard Base, Montana and the Hawaii Air National Guard's 154th Wing at Hickam AFB, Hawaii. The pilots and maintainers moved to Whiteman AFB, Missouri to fly and maintain the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber as the first Air National Guard wing to fly the aircraft. Lambert Field Air National Guard Base formally shut down in June 2009, when the final two F-15C Eagles did a low approach over the field, then flew away. The event was attended by more than 2,200 people who said goodbye to a part of airport history for over 85 years.
Lambert's passenger traffic slowly rebounded from American Airlines' cuts of November 2003, increasing from a low of 13.4 million passengers enplaned in 2004, to 15.4 million by 2007, and increase of almost 15 percent.
During 2008, Lambert's position as an American Airlines hub faced further pressure due to increased fuel costs and softened demand because of a depressed economy. AA cut its overall system capacity by 5% during 2008. At Lambert, AA shifted even more flights from its mainline jets to commuter airplanes.USA Today, Fuel-Cost Fallout: American Airlines is the latest carrier to cut routes, flights, retrieved July 26, 2013 Total passengers enplaned fell 6% to 14.4 million in 2008, then fell another 11% to 12.8 million passengers in 2009.
In September 2009, American Airlines announced that, as a part of the airline's restructuring, it would eliminate its St. Louis hub by reducing its operations from approximately 200 daily flights to 36 daily flights to nine destinations in the summer of 2010.[tpl]cite news |title=With AA's Cuts, St. Louis Will Fall From the Ranks of Hub Cities|first=Ben|last=Mutzabaugh|url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/item.aspx?type=blog&ak=68499380.blog|newspaper=USA Today|date=September 18, 2009|accessdate=September 18, 2009[/tpl] These cuts ended the remaining hub operation.[tpl]cite news |title=Airline blames cuts on restructuring|first=Ken|last=Leiser|url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/business/stories.nsf/story/story/5E1B3CA89E6A7F05862576350005F923?OpenDocument|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=September 18, 2009|accessdate=September 18, 2009[/tpl] AA's only remaining nonstop flights out of St Louis were limited to the five focus cities (four hubs plus LAX) as well as Boston, New York/LaGuardia, Seattle, and Washington/National. American's announcement that its St. Louis hub would close was part of its new "Cornerstone" plan whereby the airline would be concentrating on its 4 primary hubs in major markets: Chicago O'Hare, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Miami, and New York, with a focus city in Los Angeles. While it cut approximately 165 daily flights from St. Louis, AA increased flights at O'Hare by 57 daily flights and by 15 new destinations, to a new total of 487 daily flights to 114 destinations. Ironically, due to soft overall airline demand, the O'Hare hub actually lost a net 11 daily mainline flights, offset by 68 new regional jet flights. At its DFW hub, AA increased flights by 19 daily flight and one additional destination, for a new total of 780 daily flights to 160 destinations. At its Miami hub, AA increased flights 23 daily flights and one additional destination, to a new total of 294 daily flights to 108 destinations.AMR Announces New Liquidity, Network and Fleet Enhancements, accessed July 26, 2013 AA also cut flights out of several other non-hub cities, especially in Boston and Raleigh-Durham.

===Runways===

Lambert–St. Louis International Airport covers [tpl]convert|2800|acre|ha|0[/tpl] and has four runways:

===Terminals===

The airport has two terminals with a total of 5 concourses. International flights and passengers use Terminal 2, whose lower level holds the Immigration and Customs gates. Passengers can move between the terminals on complimentary buses that run continuously, or via MetroLink for a fee. It was possible to walk between the terminals via Concourse D until connection was blocked in 2008 with the closure of Concourse D.[tpl]cite web |title=St. Louis Airport Reopens, One Concourse Remains Closed|url=http://www.travelpulse.com/st-louis-airport-reopens-one-concourse-remains-closed.html|work=Travelpulse.com|date=April 25, 2011|accessdate=November 22, 2011[/tpl]

It has a bar/snack area, basic ticketing functions, espresso bar, three private conference rooms, and complimentary use of six PCs, dataports, copier, printer and paper shredder. This club was damaged by the 2011 tornado and was temporarily relocated to a holding space in Concourse D until it reopened in 2013.
Lambert's USO facility, on the lower level of the Main Terminal next to baggage claim carousel #M6, is one of the largest in the country. Open 24 hours a day, it serves more than 120,000 military men and women each year.James S. McDonnell USO[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]
The airport has cited interest in a Delta Sky Club in the A Concourse.
Construction was started for a United Red Carpet Club, but ended due to a strike by the contractor's workers.

===Black Americans in Flight mural===

Black Americans in Flight is a mural that depicts African American aviators and their contributions to aviation since 1917. It is located in Terminal 1 / Main Terminal on the lower level near the entrance to gates C and D and baggage claim. The mural consists of five panels and measures 8 feet tall and 51 feet long. The first panel includes Albert Edward Forsythe and C. Alfred Anderson, the first black pilots to complete a cross-country flight, the Tuskegee Institute and the Tuskegee Airmen, Eugene Bullard, Bessie Coleman, and Willa Brown (first African American woman commercial pilot in United States). The second panel shows Benjamin O. Davis Jr., Clarence "Lucky" Lester and Joseph Ellesberry. The third panel shows Gen. Daniel "Chappie" James, Capt. Ronald Radliff, and Capt. Marcella Hayes. The fourth and fifth panels show Ronald McNair, who died in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986, Guion Bluford, who in 1983 became the first African American in space, and Mae Jemison, the first African America woman in space.

===Aircraft on display===

Two aircraft from the Missouri History Museum hang from Lambert's ceilings. The first is a 1934 Monocoupe D-145 near the Terminal 1 security checkpoint. Charles Lindbergh bought it in 1934 from the Lambert Aircraft Corporation and flew it as his personal plane. The second aircraft, a red Monocoupe 110 Special, manufactured in St. Louis in 1931, hangs in Terminal 2.[tpl]cite web |title=Charles Lindbergh's Monocoupe – St. Louis, MO – Static Aircraft Displays|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM5BWR_Charles_Lindberghs_Monocoupe_St_Louis_MO|publisher=Groundspeak, Inc.|date=December 15, 2008|accessdate=July 25, 2010[/tpl] Until 1998, a Ryan B-1 Brougham, a replica of the Spirit of St. Louis, hung next to the D-145.[tpl]cite web |title = Midnight Maintenance: Caring for Lindbergh's Monocoupe|first1=Robert|last1=Mullen|first2=Sharon|last2=Smith|url=http://www.mhmvoices.org/2008SpringDept2.php|work=Missouri History Museum|date=Spring 2008|accessdate=July 25, 2010[/tpl]

===Aircraft production===

Lambert's runways have long been used for test flights and deliveries of military aircraft by McDonnell Douglas, which built its world headquarters and principal assembly plant next to the airport; and now by Boeing, which bought McDonnell and now uses its St. Louis facilities as headquarters for its Boeing Defense, Space & Security division. The plant currently builds the F-15 Strike Eagle, F/A-18 Super Hornet and EA-18 Growler; and is home to Boeing Phantom Works.

===China cargo hub and Aerotropolis===

In 2008, China Cargo Airlines (a subsidiary of China Eastern Airlines) was reported to be considering a cargo hub at Lambert as part of its international cargo and passenger service expansion.Gateway to the East: St. Louis Seeks to be China's Freight And Commercial Hub. St. Louis Commerce Magazine. June 2008. Retrieved June 10, 2009.Commission Looks to Bring Chinese Air Freight to St. Louis. St. Louis Business Journal. January 19, 2009. Retrieved June 10, 2009. Lambert was considered an attractive option as runway 11/29 would accommodate the large cargo aircraft and the decline in passenger service during the first decade of the 2000s meant less congestion than busier airports such as Chicago O'Hare International Airport.[tpl]cite web |title=Local Media Fail St. Louis with Aerotropolis Reporting|url=http://nextstl.com/transportation/local-media-fail-st-louis-with-aerotropolis-reporting|work=nextSTL|date=July 19, 2011|accessdate=November 22, 2011[/tpl]
Negotiations led to the 2009 creation of the public-private Midwest-China Hub Commission to developing an implementation plan. Planners for the cargo hub envisioned St. Louis as an Aerotropolis, an urban form whose layout, infrastructure, and economy is centered on an airport, offering its businesses speedy connectivity to suppliers, customers, and enterprise partners worldwide. Negotiations between the Chinese ambassador Zhou Wenzhong, China's Minister of Foreign Affairs Li Zhaoxing, Missouri Senators Kit Bond and Claire McCaskill and business leaders from the St. Louis region continued over the next two years. The United States Department of Commerce allowed expansion of the foreign trade zone near Lambert airport on February 13, 2009.[tpl]cite news |title=Lambert Foreign Trade Zone Expanded|first=Evan|last=Binns|url=http://stlouis.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2009/02/16/story4.html|newspaper=St. Louis Business Journal|date=February 16, 2009|accessdate=June 10, 2009[/tpl]
In 2011, the "Aerotropolis Tax Credit"Aerotropolis Tax Credit was introduced into the Missouri Senate.

==Expansion==

===Runway 11/29===

During the late 1990s, Lambert Field was ranked as the eighth-busiest U.S. airport by flights (not by total passengers) largely due to TWA's hub operations, Southwest Airlines' growing traffic, and commuter traffic to smaller cities in the region. Congestion caused delays during peak hours and was exacerbated when bad weather reduced the number of usable runways from three to one. To cope, Lambert officials briefly redesignated the taxiway immediately north of runway 12L–30R as runway 13–31 and used it for commuter and general aviation traffic. However, traffic projections made in the 1980s and 1990s predicted yet more growth, enough to strain the airport and the national air traffic system.[tpl]cite web |title=The Expansion Story|url=http://www.lambert-stlouis.com/e/newwebsite/id261.asp|accessdate=July 25, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080501193743/http://www.lambert-stlouis.com/e/newwebsite/id261.asp|archivedate=May 1, 2008[/tpl]
These factors led to the planning and construction of a 9,000-foot runway, dubbed Runway 11/29, parallel to the two larger existing runways. At $1.1 billion, it was the costliest public works program in St. Louis history. It required moving seven major roads and destroying about 2,000 homes, six churches and four schools in Bridgeton, Missouri.[tpl]cite web |title=Airport/Mass Transit November 2005 – Feature Story|url=http://midwest.construction.com/2005/11/01/MC_11_01_2005_p27-01.asp|work=Engineering News-Record|date=November 1, 2005|accessdate=July 25, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Airports and Cities: Can they coexist?|url=http://www.sdearthtimes.com/et0901/et0901s2.html|work=SD Earth Times|accessdate=July 25, 2007[/tpl] Construction began in 1998, and continued even as traffic at the airport declined after the 9/11 attacks, the TWA purchase, and American's 2003 reduction in flights.[tpl]cite web |title=Historical Operation Statistics by Class for the Years: 1985–2006|url=http://www.lambert-stlouis.com/index/about_Facts_oper_stat.html|work=Lambert–St. Louis International Airport|accessdate=July 25, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070711231321/http://www.lambert-stlouis.com/index/about_Facts_oper_stat.html |archivedate=July 11, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=New $1 Billion Runway Opens This Week, But It's Not Needed Anymore|url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/sky/2006/04/st_louis.html|newspaper=USA Today|date=April 11, 2006|accessdate=July 25, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=June 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] On April 13, 2006, American Airlines Flight 2470 became the first commercial airliner to land on the new runway.[tpl]cite web |title=Flight AAL2470 KSNA–KSTL|url=http://flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL2470/history/20060413/1634ZZ/KSNA/KSTL|work=Flightaware|date=April 13, 2006|accessdate=August 27, 2010[/tpl]
Now complete, the runway is used by an estimated 5% of flights, far less than anticipated.

===21st-century renovation===

In February 2007, airport officials announced the largest renovation in the airport's history: a $70 million effort to overhaul the Main Terminal called "The Airport Experience Project." It was set back slightly by the 2011 tornado damage, but as of July 2013, it is in Phase 2.Airport Experience Project
