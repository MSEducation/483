Hypertension is also a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia, and chronic kidney disease. Other complications include hypertensive retinopathy and hypertensive nephropathy.

==History==

Modern understanding of the cardiovascular system began with the work of physician William Harvey (1578–1657), who described the circulation of blood in his book "De motu cordis". The English clergyman Stephen Hales made the first published measurement of blood pressure in 1733.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kotchen TA |title=Historical trends and milestones in hypertension research: a model of the process of translational research |journal=Hypertension |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=522–38 |date=October 2011 |pmid=21859967 |doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.177766[/tpl] Descriptions of hypertension as a disease came among others from Thomas Young in 1808 and especially Richard Bright in 1836. The first report of elevated blood pressure in a person without evidence of kidney disease was made by Frederick Akbar Mahomed (1849–1884).[tpl]cite book |editor=Swales JD|title=Manual of hypertension |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=1995 |pages=xiii |isbn=0-86542-861-1[/tpl] However hypertension as a clinical entity came into being in 1896 with the invention of the cuff-based sphygmomanometer by Scipione Riva-Rocci in 1896.[tpl]cite book | title=A century of arterial hypertension 1896–1996 | editor=Postel-Vinay N | page=213 | location=Chichester | publisher=Wiley | year=1996 | isbn=0-471-96788-2[/tpl] This allowed the measurement of blood pressure in the clinic. In 1905, Nikolai Korotkoff improved the technique by describing the Korotkoff sounds that are heard when the artery is ausculated with a stethoscope while the sphygmomanometer cuff is deflated.
Historically the treatment for what was called the "hard pulse disease" consisted in reducing the quantity of blood by bloodletting or the application of leeches. This was advocated by The Yellow Emperor of China, Cornelius Celsus, Galen, and Hippocrates. In the 19th and 20th centuries, before effective pharmacological treatment for hypertension became possible, three treatment modalities were used, all with numerous side-effects: strict sodium restriction (for example the rice diet), sympathectomy (surgical ablation of parts of the sympathetic nervous system), and pyrogen therapy (injection of substances that caused a fever, indirectly reducing blood pressure).[tpl]cite journal |author=Dustan HP, Roccella EJ, Garrison HH |title=Controlling hypertension. A research success story |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=156 |issue=17 |pages=1926–35 |date=September 1996 |pmid=8823146 |doi=10.1001/archinte.156.17.1926[/tpl] The first chemical for hypertension, sodium thiocyanate, was used in 1900 but had many side effects and was unpopular. Several other agents were developed after the Second World War, the most popular and reasonably effective of which were tetramethylammonium chloride and its derivative hexamethonium, hydralazine and reserpine (derived from the medicinal plant Rauwolfia serpentina). A major breakthrough was achieved with the discovery of the first well-tolerated orally available agents. The first was chlorothiazide, the first thiazide diuretic and developed from the antibiotic sulfanilamide, which became available in 1958.[tpl]cite journal|author=Novello FC, Sprague JM | title=Benzothiadiazine dioxides as novel diuretics | journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc. | year=1957 | volume=79 | pages=2028 | doi=10.1021/ja01565a079|issue=8[/tpl] Subsequently beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and renin inhibitors were developed as antihypertensive agents.

==Society and culture==

===Awareness===

The World Health Organization has identified hypertension, or high blood pressure, as the leading cause of cardiovascular mortality. The World Hypertension League (WHL), an umbrella organization of 85 national hypertension societies and leagues, recognized that more than 50% of the hypertensive population worldwide are unaware of their condition.[tpl]cite journal|author=Chockalingam A |title=Impact of World Hypertension Day |journal=Canadian Journal of Cardiology |volume=23 |issue=7|pages=517–9 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17534457 |pmc=2650754 |doi= 10.1016/S0828-282X(07)70795-X|url= [/tpl] To address this problem, the WHL initiated a global awareness campaign on hypertension in 2005 and dedicated May 17 of each year as World Hypertension Day (WHD). Over the past three years, more national societies have been engaging in WHD and have been innovative in their activities to get the message to the public. In 2007, there was record participation from 47 member countries of the WHL. During the week of WHD, all these countries – in partnership with their local governments, professional societies, nongovernmental organizations and private industries – promoted hypertension awareness among the public through several media and public rallies. Using mass media such as Internet and television, the message reached more than 250 million people. As the momentum picks up year after year, the WHL is confident that almost all the estimated 1.5 billion people affected by elevated blood pressure can be reached.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chockalingam A |title=World Hypertension Day and global awareness|journal=Canadian Journal of Cardiology |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=441–4 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18548140 |pmc=2643187|doi= 10.1016/S0828-282X(08)70617-2|url=[/tpl]

===Economics===

High blood pressure is the most common chronic medical problem prompting visits to primary health care providers in USA. The American Heart Association estimated the direct and indirect costs of high blood pressure in 2010 as $76.6 billion.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lloyd-Jones D |title=Heart disease and stroke statistics--2010 update: a report from the American Heart Association |journal=Circulation |volume=121 |issue=7 |pages=e46–e215 |date=February 2010 |pmid=20019324 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.192667 |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Adams RJ |author3=Brown TM |display-authors=3 |last4=Carnethon |first4=M. |last5=Dai |first5=S. |last6=De Simone |first6=G. |last7=Ferguson |first7=T.

L. |first28=W. |first29=R. |first30=P.[/tpl] In the US 80% of people with hypertension are aware of their condition, 71% take some antihypertensive medication, but only 48% of people aware that they have hypertension adequately control it. Adequate management of hypertension can be hampered by inadequacies in the diagnosis, treatment, and/or control of high blood pressure.[tpl]cite journal |author=Alcocer L, Cueto L |title=Hypertension, a health economics perspective |journal=Therapeutic Advances in Cardiovascular Disease |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=147–55 |date=June 2008 |pmid=19124418 |doi=10.1177/1753944708090572 |url=http://tak.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19124418 |accessdate=20 June 2009[/tpl] Health care providers face many obstacles to achieving blood pressure control, including resistance to taking multiple medications to reach blood pressure goals. People also face the challenges of adhering to medicine schedules and making lifestyle changes. Nonetheless, the achievement of blood pressure goals is possible, and most importantly, lowering blood pressure significantly reduces the risk of death due to heart disease and stroke, the development of other debilitating conditions, and the cost associated with advanced medical care.[tpl]cite journal |author=William J.

==Research==

Selective radiofrequency ablation of the nerves supplying the kidneys, which employs a catheter-based device to cause thermal injury to the nerves surrounding the renal artery without affecting other sympathetic nerves, may lower blood pressure. So far, major side effects have been relatively infrequent, although cases of renal artery dissection, femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, excessive decreases in blood pressure and heart rate are among the reported adverse effects. It has been suggested that renal nerve ablation may have a role in the management of resistant hypertension but its long term efficacy and safety have not been evaluated.[ref][tpl]Cite journal |last1=Gulati |first1=V. |last2=White |first2=WB.|title=Review of the state of renal nerve ablation for patients with severe and resistant hypertension |journal=J Am Soc Hypertens |date=August 2013|doi=10.1016/j.jash.2013.07.003 |pmid=23953998 |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=484–93[/tpl]
