In mathematical physics, the Lemaître–Tolman metric is the spherically symmetric dust solution of Einstein's field equations was first found by Lemaître in 1933 and then Tolman in 1934.  It was later investigated by Bondi in 1947.  This solution describes a spherical cloud of dust (finite or infinite) that is expanding or collapsing under gravity.  It is also known as the Lemaître-Tolman-Bondi metric and the Tolman metric.
The metric is:
where:
The matter is comoving, which means its 4-velocity is:
The pressure is zero (hence dust), the density is 
and the evolution equation is
where
which are known as hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic evolutions respectively.
Special cases are the Schwarzschild metric in geodesic coordinates
