==History and production==

Speakeasy brands its beers with references to 1930s prohibition-era mobsters and organized crime. Prohibition Ale (an amber ale) is one of the more popular local beers in San Francisco, available in over 500 bars and restaurants and 1,000 stores in the San Francisco Bay Area, although the beer is available regionally in California and five other states. Speakeasy beers are flavorful and high in alcohol, ranging from approximately 5% to 10% alcohol by volume. Speakeasy's new tap room adjacent to the brewery is open to the public. Some of Speakeasy's brewing operations are handled on contract by Gordon Biersch Brewing Company.
The company began regular bottling of barrel aged beers in 2013 with a one-off release of bourbon barrel Scarface Stout and the launch of the Syndicate Series of beers.[tpl]cite web|last=Stechschulte|first=Brian|title=Inside Speakeasy's New Syndicate Series with Head Brewer Kushal Hall|url=http://sfbrewersguild.org/blog/inside-speakeasys-new-syndicate-series-with-head-brewer-kushal-hall|publisher=San Francisco Brewer's Guild|accessdate=8 December 2013[/tpl]
