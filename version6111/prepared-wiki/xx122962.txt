The Cincinnati Silverbacks was an indoor soccer club based in Cincinnati, Ohio that competed in the National Professional Soccer League. They performed under the leadership of All-Star goalkeeper, Carlos Pena. Other star players included Gino DiFlorio (who scored a team record 10 points in his Silverback debut against rival Cleveland Crunch), Franklin McIntosh, and Dennis Brose. Games were held at the Cincinnati Gardens for their first two seasons before moving downtown along with the Cincinnati Cyclones where they would compete at The Crown (now known as US Bank Arena) for their final year of competition. Despite their performance and fan support, the Silverbacks were discontinued due to not generating enough revenue.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
