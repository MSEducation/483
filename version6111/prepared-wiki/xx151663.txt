During the 1990s, a new year's resolution led Ron to draw a comic every day, many of which he published in his annual periodical Yeast Hoist. He also contributed illustrations to many DIY publications, designed posters for events, as well as various forms of apparel. Many of these pieces, as well as some of Ron's more commercial work, are anthologized in the collection Against Pain (Drawn & Quarterly 2008). In 2010, Texas-based beer distributor Alchemic Ale commissioned Regé to design an earthenware bottle to be filled with Belgian ale that accompanied the release of Yeast Hoist #15.Alchemic Ale website.
