As always, laboratory values have to be interpreted with the lab's reference values in mind and considering all aspects of the individual clinical situation.
Serum ferritin can be elevated in inflammatory conditions and so a normal serum ferritin may not always exclude iron deficiency, and the utility is improved by taking a concurrent C reactive protein (CRP). The level of serum ferritin that is viewed as "high" depends on condition. For example, in Inflammatory bowel disease the threshold is 100, where as in chronic heart failure (CHF) the levels are 200.

==Treatment==

Before commencing treatment, there should be definitive diagnosis of the underlying cause for iron deficiency.  This is particularly the case in older patients, who are most susceptible to colorectal cancer and the gastrointestinal bleeding it often causes. In adults, 60% of patients with iron deficiency anemia may have underlying gastrointestinal disorders leading to chronic blood loss.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rockey D, Cello J |title=Evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with iron-deficiency anemia |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=329 |issue=23 |pages=1691–5 |year=1993 |pmid=8179652 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199312023292303[/tpl]
It is likely that the cause of the iron deficiency will need treatment as well.
Upon diagnosis, the condition can be treated with iron supplements. The choice of supplement will depend upon both the severity of the condition, the required speed of improvement (e.g. if awaiting elective surgery) and the likelihood of treatment being effective (e.g. if has underlying IBD, undergoing dialysis or is having ESA therapy).
Examples of oral iron that are often used are ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, or amino acid chelate tablets. Recent research suggests the replacement dose of iron, at least in the elderly with iron deficiency, may be as little as 15 mg per day of elemental iron.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rimon E, Kagansky N, Kagansky M, Mechnick L, Mashiah T, Namir M, Levy S |title=Are we giving too much iron?

===Food sources===

Mild iron deficiency can be prevented or corrected by eating iron-rich foods and by cooking in an iron skillet. Because iron is a requirement for most plants and animals, a wide range of foods provide iron. Good sources of dietary iron have heme-iron as this is most easily absorbed and is not inhibited by medication or other dietary components. Three examples are red meat, poultry and insects.Defoliart,G. 1992.  Insects as Human Food.  Crop Protection, 11:395-99.Bukkens SGF.  1997.  The Nutritional Value of Edible Insects.  Ecol. Food. Nutr. Vol. 36(2–4): pp. 287–319. Non-heme sources do contain iron, though it has reduced bioavailability. Examples are lentils, beans, leafy vegetables, pistachios, tofu, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals.
Iron from different foods is absorbed and processed differently by the body; for instance, iron in meat (heme iron source) is more easily absorbed than iron in grains and vegetables ("non-heme" iron source),Iron deficiency. Food Standards Agency. but heme/hemoglobin from red meat has effects which may increase the likelihood of colorectal cancer.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sesink AL, Termont DS, Kleibeuker JH, Van der Meer R |title=Red meat and colon cancer: the cytotoxic and hyperproliferative effects of dietary heme |journal=Cancer Research |volume=59 |issue=22 |pages=5704–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10582688 |doi= |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10582688[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Glei M, Klenow S, Sauer J, Wegewitz U, Richter K, Pool-Zobel BL |title=Hemoglobin and hemin induce DNA damage in human colon tumor cells HT29 clone 19A and in primary human colonocytes |journal=Mutat. Res. |volume=594 |issue=1–2 |pages=162–71 |year=2006 |pmid=16226281 |doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2005.08.006 |url=[/tpl] Minerals and chemicals in one type of food may also inhibit absorption of iron from another type of food eaten at the same time.Iron in diet. MedlinePlus. For example, oxalates and phytic acid form insoluble complexes which bind iron in the gut before it can be absorbed.
Because iron from plant sources is less easily absorbed than the heme-bound iron of animal sources, vegetarians and vegans should have a somewhat higher total daily iron intake than those who eat meat, fish or poultry.Mangels, Reed. Iron in the vegan diet. The Vegetarian Resource Group. Legumes and dark-green leafy vegetables like broccoli, kale and oriental greens are especially good sources of iron for vegetarians and vegans. However, spinach and Swiss chard contain oxalates which bind iron making it almost entirely unavailable for absorption. Iron from nonheme sources is more readily absorbed if consumed with foods that contain either heme-bound iron or vitamin C. This is due to a hypothesised "meat factor" which enhances iron absorption.Iron. The Merck Manuals Online Medical Library.
Many medicinal herbs can offer iron boosting properties to those who suffer from iron deficiency. These medicinal properties can easily be assimilated into the bloodstream as a hot water infusion (tea). Iron enhancing herbs include yellow dock, red raspberry leaf, gentian, yellowroot, turmeric, mullein, nettle, parsley, ginseng, watercress, and dandelion.http://www.everygreenherb.com/anemia.html.

Following are two tables showing the richest foods in heme and non-heme iron.iron rich foods. Rich Foods.
In both tables, foods serving size may differ from the usual 100g quantity for relevancy reasons.
Arbitrarily, the guideline is set to 18 mg, which is the USDA Recommended Dietary Allowance for women aged between 19 and 50.Dietary Reference Intakes: Recommended Intakes for Individuals National Academy of Sciences. Institute of Medicine. Food and Nutrition Board.
Iron deficiency can have serious health consequences that diet may not be able to quickly correct, hence an iron supplement is often necessary if the iron deficiency has become symptomatic.

==Bioavailability and bacterial infection==

Iron is needed for bacterial growth making its bioavailability an important factor in controlling infection.[tpl]Cite PMID|760197[/tpl] Blood plasma as a result carries iron tightly bound to transferrin, which is taken up by cells by endocytosing transferring, thus preventing its access to bacteria.Nesse, R. M.; Williams, G. C. Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine. New York. page 30 ISBN 0-679-74674-9. Between 15 and 20 percent of the protein content in human milk consists of lactoferrinT. William Hutchens, Bo Lönnerdal; Lactoferrin: Interactions and Biological Functions (1997). page 379 on Google Books that binds iron. As a comparison, in cow's milk, this is only 2 percent. As a result, breast fed babies have fewer infections. Lactoferrin is also concentrated in tears, saliva and at wounds to bind iron to limit bacterial growth.  Egg white contains 12% conalbumin to withhold it from bacteria that get through the egg shell (for this reason prior to antibiotics, egg white was used to treat infections).Nesse, R. M.; Williams, G. C. Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine. New York. page 29 ISBN 0-679-74674-9.
To reduce bacterial growth, plasma concentrations of iron are lowered in a variety of systemic inflammatory states due to increased production of hepcidin which is mainly released by the liver in response to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6. This functional iron deficiency will resolve once the source of inflammation is rectified, however if not resolved it can progress to Anaemia of Chronic Inflammation.
The underlying inflammation can be caused by fever,[tpl]Cite PMID|6420813[/tpl] Inflammatory Bowel Disease, infections, Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), carcinomas and following surgery.
Reflecting this link between iron bioavailability and bacterial growth, the taking of oral iron supplements causes a relative over abundance of iron that can alter the types of bacteria that are present within the gut. There have been concerns regarding parenteral iron being administered whilst bacteremia is present, although this has not been borne out in clinical practice.  A moderate iron deficiency, in contrast, can provide protection against acute infection, especially against organisms that reside within hepatocytes and macrophages such as Malaria and TB. This is mainly beneficial in regions with a high prevalence of these diseases and where standard treatment is unavailable.
