Rant in E-Minor is an album by comedian Bill Hicks, posthumously released in 1997 through Rykodisc. It was released alongside the sister album Arizona Bay on February 25, 1997, marking three years since his death.
The material on this album is darker and angrier in tone than some of his earlier work; Hicks can be heard screaming at his audience in between chapters, and very prominently during the track "You're Wrong Night".
It received the Allmusic Guide album pick.
