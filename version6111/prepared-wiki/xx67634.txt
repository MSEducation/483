He had lost his job in London as a silk-weaver because he refused to attend the Catholic mass, despite an order that everyone in the City of London had to attend,[tpl]cite web|last=Dean |first=Michael & Kathryn |title=William Hunter (1535-1555)|url=http://www.christianheroes.com/people/christian_heroes_william_hunter.asp|work=Christian Heroes|publisher=Christian Heroes.com[/tpl] and had come to live with his parents in Brentwood, but got into a dispute when discovered reading the Bible for himself in Brentwood Chapel. He refused to accept the Catholic dogma of transubstantiation according to which the bread and wine of the communion become the body and blood of Jesus.[tpl]cite book|last=Foxe|first=John|title=Foxe's Book of Martyrs|year=1563|publisher=John Day[/tpl]
He was taken before Antony Browne, then the local Justice, but later Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, but refused to retract his position. Hunter was then sent to Bishop Bonner in London. He resisted both threats and bribes—Bonner offered to make him a Freeman of the City of London and give him £40—and was eventually returned to Brentwood to be burnt. He was the first Essex martyr of the reign of Mary Tudor.[tpl]cite web|last=Leicester|first=Learning Library|title= Protestant Martyr at Brentwood - William Hunter, 1555 |url=http://www.leicester.gov.uk/education/LearningLibrary2006/netmedia_ll/teacher/history/tudors/protestant_martyr.htm|work=Ways of Life in Town & Country|publisher=Leicester County Council[/tpl]
The site is now Brentwood School, which was founded by Antony Browne in 1558, under a grant from Queen Mary (not, as some believe, as a penance when Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne). The Martyr's Elm was grown on the spot of Hunter's incineration.
The site is marked by a plaque with the inscription
