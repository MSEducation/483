==History==

European colonization of Timor began in the 16th century. Although the Portuguese claimed the island of Timor in 1520, the Dutch (in the form of the Dutch East India Company) settled West Timor in 1640, forcing the Portuguese out to East Timor. The subsequent collapse of the company meant that in 1799 the area returned to official Dutch rule. Finally, in 1914 the border between East and West Timor was finalized by a treaty between Portugal and the Netherlands that was originally signed in 1859 and modified in 1893.
West Timor had the status of residentie within the Dutch East Indies.
Japan conquered the island during World War II in early 1942. Upon Indonesian independence, West Timor became part of the new Republic of Indonesia.
On 6 September 2000, three UNHCR staff members were attacked and killed in Atambua, a town in West Timor. Pero Simundza from Croatia, Carlos Caceres-Collazio from Puerto Rico and Samson Aregahegn from Ethiopia were killed in an attack by 5,000 members of a pro-Indonesian militia, armed with machetes, on the office of UNHCR in Atambua, West Timor, where the main refugee camp was located in the vicinity of the border with East Timor.
