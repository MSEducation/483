[[Centre points of Australia]]

CATEGORIES: Geographical centres, Geography of Australia

Centre points of Australia are those geographical locations that have been considered to be centre of Australia,http://www.ga.gov.au/education/geoscience-basics/dimensions/centre-of-australia-states-territories.html#fivecentres as distinct from the extreme points of Australia.

==Finding the centre point==

John McDouall Stuart wrote "Sunday, 22 April 1860, Small Gum Creek, under Mount Stuart, Centre of Australia - today I find from my observations of the sun, 111° 00' 30", that I am now camped in the centre of Australia. I have marked a tree and planted the British flag there."T. Flannery (ed.), The Explorers, The Text Publishing Company, Melbourne, 1998.25°36'36"S 134°21'17"E(Lambert Gravitational Centre) Lambert Gravitational Centre[tpl]gutenberg author| id=John+McDouall+Stuart | name=John McDouall Stuart[/tpl]
Below are five methods which have been used to locate the centre point of Australia:

===Centre of gravity method===

===Lambert gravitational centre===

In 1988 the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia determined the geographical centre of Australia as a Bicentennial project. A monument was erected to mark the location and named in honour of Dr. Bruce P Lambert, a former Director of the Division of National Mapping, for his achievements in the national survey, levelling and mapping of the continent.http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMY40 Similar to the centre of gravity method, the location was calculated from 24,500 points at the high-water mark of Australia's coastline.http://www.travelblog.org/Oceania/Australia/South-Australia/Marla/blog-458718.htmlLee Atkinson, Real middle Australia SMH June 22, 2013. The computed result of the 1988 project was: 

===Furthest point from the coastline===

===Median point===

The median point was calculated as the midpoint between the extremes of latitude and longitude of the continent. 

==Centre of population==

Australia has not seen its population centroid move drastically since the creation of the country. In 1911, the centroid was in central New South Wales; in 1996, it was only slightly further northwest.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/1999-2000/2000rp09.htm#Figure15 |title=Figure 15: Shifts in the Australian Population Centroid*, 1911–1996 |accessdate=7 January 2009 |work=Parliament of Australia Parliamentary Library|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000819030557/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/1999-2000/2000rp09.htm#Figure15|archivedate=19 August 2000[/tpl]

==Centre of the Australian states==

Just as there are various ways to calculate the centre of Australia as a whole  there are various methods of calculating the centre of the states. However, the Government body responsible for determining such matters, Geoscience Australia, has adopted the following locations as official centroid for each of the States.Geoscience Australia
