[[Matrix decomposition]]

CATEGORIES: Matrix theory, Matrix decompositions

In the mathematical discipline of linear algebra, a matrix decomposition or matrix factorization is a factorization of a matrix into a product of matrices. There are many different matrix decompositions; each finds use among a particular class of problems.

==Example==

In numerical analysis, different decompositions are used to implement efficient matrix algorithms.
Similarly, the QR decomposition expresses A as QR with Q an orthogonal matrix and R an upper triangular matrix.  The system Q(Rx) = b is solved by Rx = QTb = c, and the system Rx = c is solved by 'back substitution'.  The number of additions and multiplications required is about twice that of using the LU solver, but no more digits are required in inexact arithmetic because the QR decomposition is numerically stable.
