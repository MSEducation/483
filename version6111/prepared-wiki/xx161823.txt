[[Fear and Bullets]]

CATEGORIES: Book soundtracks, 1994 soundtracks

Fear and Bullets was an album created through a collaboration between James O'Barr and longtime friend John Bergin as a soundtrack to O'Barr's graphic novel The Crow. It was originally released in 1994 along with a limited edition hardcover copy of the graphic novel. The release also coincided with the publicity received from the film.
In 1999, Fear and Bullets was re-released with almost all the songs completely re-recorded or remixed, and the addition of two new tracks. The release included previously unreleased drawings by O'Barr.
