==History==

Hanover was chartered by Governor Benning Wentworth on July 4, 1761, and in 1765–1766 its first European inhabitants arrived, the majority from Connecticut. Although the surface is uneven, the town developed into an agricultural community. Dartmouth College was established in 1769 beside the Common at a village called the Plain—an extensive and level tract of land a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the Connecticut River, and about 150 feet (46 meters) above it.[tpl]Cite book | last = Coolidge | first = Austin J.| coauthors = John B.

At one point in its history, the southwest corner of Hanover was known as Dresden, which in the 1780s joined other disgruntled New Hampshire towns along the Connecticut River that briefly defected to what was then the independent Republic of Vermont. For a time, Dresden was capital of the republic.[tpl]cite book |title=The College on the Hill: A Dartmouth Chronicle |first=Ralph Nading |last=Hill |publisher= Dartmouth Publishing|location= Hanover, NH| year= 1965 |isbn= |page=46[/tpl] After various political posturings, however, the towns returned to New Hampshire at the heated insistence of George Washington.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flowofhistory.org/themes/american_republic/western.php |title=The American Republic: 1760–1780: The Western Rebellion |work=New Hampshire Profile |first= Jere |last=Daniell |year=1976 |publisher=The Flow of History |accessdate=2011-02-08 [/tpl] One remnant of this era is that the name Dresden is still used in the Dresden School District, an interstate school district serving both Hanover and Norwich, Vermont—the first and one of the few inter-state school districts in the nation.

===Etymology===

"Hannover" (as it was spelled in the 1761 charter) was named either after a local parish in Sprague, Connecticut, or after the House of Hanover in honor of the reigning British king, George III.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hanovernh.org/about |title=About the Town of Hanover |publisher=www.hanovernh.org |accessdate=2011-02-08 [/tpl]
While it is likely that the name "Dresden" derived from Dresden in Germany, it has also been suggested that it could derive directly from the old Sorbian word drezg ("forest") or Drezd'ane, for an inhabitant of a forest.The settlers in the riverside forest, an appellation fully compatible with that of the early inhabitants of the Hanover Plain.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/Library_Bulletin/Nov1997/HoefnagelClose.html| title=Dresden: What Is in the Name| author=Dick Hoefnagel and Virginia L.
