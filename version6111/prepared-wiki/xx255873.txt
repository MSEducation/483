</ref> It crosses the old [[Toronto Belt Line Railway|Belt Line Railway]] trail, and winds northeast into [[Davisville Village]].<ref name="TandA">
</ref>
Continuing north and resuming its straight northward course, Mount Pleasant passes through a historic commercial strip, then meets Eglinton Avenue East.[ref]
</ref>
It passes into a primarily residential area, though several auto service shops exist along this stretch, as well as Northern Secondary School. The road heads slightly west south of Blythwood Road, then crosses Blythwood Ravine, which contains the small Burke's Brook. After climbing into Lawrence Park, the road meets Lawrence Avenue East. This intersection, featuring a multi-stage traffic light, directs driver to the east before continuing north. From here to the northern terminus, it is classified as a collector road and is a wide residential street with several stop signs. The road ends near the edge of the West Don Valley at an intersection with Glen Echo Drive, adjacent to the Doncliffe Bus Loop.

==History==

The outward growth of Toronto presented an ever increasing need for a dedicated burial ground. The Toronto General Burying Grounds Trust was formed by the owners of the Potter's Field cemetery, which lay at the northwest corner of Yonge and Bloor. As the cemetery blocked the growth of Yorkville, the village pressured the province to move the interred to a new burial ground; the trust purchased The Necropolis.[ref]
</ref>
As Toronto continued to grow, the need for a new cemetery grew. As a result, the trust purchased a [tpl]convert|0.81|sqkm|acre|abbr=on[/tpl] farm north of Deer Park. The new grounds, named Mount Pleasant Cemetery, opened to the public on November 4, 1876.[ref]
</ref>
Thereafter, the "outer suburbs" of Rosedale, Deer Park, North Toronto and Moore Park grew, being annexed by the City of Toronto in 1905, 1908 and the latter two in 1912, respectively.[ref]
</ref>
Mount Pleasant Road was constructed over the course of several years by interconnecting several existing streets as well as building a new road in other places; at that time, a road existed to the north and south of the cemetery. The road to the south, running between Clarence Street (renamed Heath Street on April 7, 1913) and Moore Avenue, was known as Lyle Street and Kinsman Avenue. The road to the north, running between Balliol Street and Merton Street, was known as Alberta Avenue.[ref]
</ref>
In an attempt to improve the flow of traffic coming from within the city, the operators of Mount Pleasant Cemetery were approached beginning in 1912 with the goal of opening a new right-of-way through the property. The operators initially refused, prompting the city to pass By-law 7311 in March 1915, which allowed for the expropriation of the cemetery property. Over the next several months, the city and the Toronto General Burying Grounds Trustees bargained over the price of the land, settling for the extraordinary sum of $98,921.88 ($2,090,000, adjusted for inflation) by July; construction began the following spring. The route through Moore Park incorporated a small street known as Kinsman Avenue (known as Lyle Street until April 7, 1913),Toronto bylaw 6402 (1913)
while north of the cemetery, the short Alberta Avenue between Merton Street And Balliol Street was absorbed.[ref]
</ref>
The muddy road was opened to traffic in 1919, featuring a paved bridge with streetcar tracks over the abandoned Belt Line Railway.[ref]
</ref>
By the end of 1919, Mount Pleasant Road existed between St. Clair Avenue and Blythwood Road, ending at the rim of the Blythwood Ravine. Despite this, the road on the opposite rim was renamed from Sidmouth Avenue in 1920. Following the construction of the Vale of Avoca in the first half of the 1920s, the newly formed Toronto Transit Commission extended the St. Clair streetcar line east to Mount Pleasant Road December 1, 1924 and then north to Eglinton Avenue on November 4, 1925.[ref]
</ref>
Between 1934 and 1936, after gaining approval from Lawrence Park developers, a bridge was constructed over the ravine and Mount Pleasant extended north to Lawrence Avenue. In 1935, Hilda Avenue was renamed, extending Mount Pleasant Road north to Forest Glen Crescent.

===Clifton Road Extension===

In November 1945, at the recommendation of the planning board, in an effort to improve traffic flow outward from the downtown core, city council initiated what would come to be known as the Clifton Road Extension.[ref]
</ref>
Prior to the opening of this route, a road travelled southwest from the intersection of Inglewood Drive and Clifton Road into the ravine, crossed Yellow Creek, and climbed up the opposite slope north to the corner of Avoca Avenue and Rosehill Drive; most of this route exists as a recreational path today.  Roxborough Drive also crossed the ravine along the same route as Mount Pleasant today. A third route followed MacLennan Avenue north across the CPR tracks, ascending the steep MacLennan Hill. A decades-old contract signed with CPR required the closing of the MacLennan Avenue crossing if a road should ever pass beneath the tracks.[ref]
</ref>
The Maclennan Hill was a dangerous and steep bottleneck for traffic leaving the inner city. The first recommendations involved creating an underpass beneath the CPR tracks. A vote was held on January 1, 1946, with an overwhelming majority of voters approving the project.
After several months of negotiation with residents of South Rosedale, bylaw 16622 formally approved the extension of Clifton Road to Jarvis Street on June 24, 1946.[ref]
</ref>
Residents of Moore Park, opposed to the notion of widening their small residential street, approached city council in September 1948 to request the new extension connect to Mount Pleasant Road instead. A petition of residents followed, and city council accepted the recommendations. Bylaw 17489, passed February 7, 1949, formally approved the project. Despite the loss of ten houses, this plan was carried out.[ref]
</ref>
Construction included a new bridge excavated at the intersection of Huntley and Jarvis Streets, requiring the TTC to divert its streetcar tracks to the south. The closing of the MacLennan Avenue CPR crossing resulted in the construction of a pedestrian overpass. Traffic descending the MacLennan Hill was directed west along a new road to Mount Pleasant.
On January 23, 1950, the Clifton Road Extension was renamed Mount Pleasant Road.[ref]
</ref>
It opened to traffic on May 17, and is considered the first expressway in Toronto.[ref]
