==Music video==

The music video is very different from Eternal's previous videos. The video is set out in a desert at night, the desert appears to be on a different planet as the girls float around through parts of the video. Easther and Vernie are seen in numerous outfits throughout the song and they also take part in a dance routine. At the end of the video the girls fly up to camera and sing the last line of the song, "Aint nowhere to run, when He's looking for you...", the video ends abruptly and the screen turns black.
