Tanunda Liedertafel 1861 is a 55-member male choir in Tanunda, South Australia. Drawing its four-part (TTBB) singing material from traditional popular German culture, the group's origins may date back at least to 1861, based on a surviving music book case with the words Tanunda Liedertafel 1861 painted on its metal lid.
The choir was re-organized in 1920 and, aside from an interruption caused by World War II has been active ever since, primarily in Tanunda and Adelaide. Along with third- and fourth-generation German-Australians, the group includes singers with Dutch, British, Polish and Irish backgrounds. Given the nationalities of the members, nearly 50 percent of the material sung is in English or Latin (where tradition dictates).
Many of their performances are for charity. An annual event is the Kaffee Abend in mid-November (October 2013 being the only known exception).
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has recorded the Liedertafel several times since 1932. The choir first performed on television in 1961 for its centenary. It has also appeared on programs broadcast in Germany. 
In 1963, Tanunda Liedertafel performed for Queen Elizabeth II in Elder Park, Adelaide. In 2001 it performed in Adelaide for US President Bill Clinton.
Awards have included the Zelter Plaque (1980).
The choir also attends Sangerfest(s), this is where groups of choirs (similar to the Tanunda Liedertafel) come together for a weekend of traditional German and Austrian song. The next Sagerfest will be held in Canberra, Australia in October 2014.
Practices are held for two hours each Tuesday night, at The Tanunda Institute (Tanunda Galley) eleven months out of the year (although members are no longer fined three pence for tardiness, or six pence for non-attendance).
