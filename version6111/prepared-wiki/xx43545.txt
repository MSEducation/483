So local farmers, instead of improving the agricultural and economic self-sufficiency of their home country, are forced out of the market and perhaps even off their land. This occurs as a result of a process known as "international dumping" in which subsidized farmers are able to "dump" low-cost agricultural goods on foreign markets at costs that un-subsidized farmers cannot compete with. Agricultural subsidies often are a common stumbling block in trade negotiations.  In 2006, talks at the [[Doha round]] of WTO trade negotiations stalled because the US refused to cut subsidies to a level where other countries' non-subsidized exports would have been competitive.<ref>[tpl]cite web | author1=Alan Beattie |author2=Frances Williams | title = US blamed as Trade Talks end in acrimony |work=Financial Times | date = 24 July 2006 | url =http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dfa460d0-1afd-11db-b164-0000779e2340.html | accessdate =18 May 2008[/tpl]</ref>
Others argue that a world market with farm subsidies and other market distortions (as happens today) results in higher food prices, rather than lower food prices, as compared to a free market.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
Mark Malloch Brown, former head of the United Nations Development Program, estimated that farm subsidies cost poor countries about US$50 billion a year in lost agricultural exports:
 
 "It is the extraordinary distortion of global trade, where the West spends $360 billion a year on protecting its agriculture with a network of subsidies and tariffs that costs developing countries about US$50 billion in potential lost agricultural exports. Fifty billion dollars is the equivalent of today's level of development assistance."http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2002/november/mmb-uganda.en;jsessionid=axbWzt8vXD9 Address by Mark Malloch Brown, UNDP Administrator, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda, 12 November 2002[ref]http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/05/opinion/05KRIS.html?ex=1027081396&ei=1&en=6415bc0232476bf2 "Farm Subsidies That Kill", 5 July 2002, By NICHOLAS D.

===Poverty in developing countries===

The impact of agricultural subsidies in developed countries upon developing-country farmers and international development is well documented. Agricultural subsidies can help drive prices down to benefit consumers, but also mean that unsubsidised developing-country farmers have a more difficult time competing in the world market[tpl]cite book|last=Patel|first=Raj|title=Stuffed and Starved|date=2007|publisher=Portobello Books|location=UK|page=57[/tpl] ; and the effects on poverty are particularly negative when subsidies are provided for crops that are also grown in developing countries since developing-country farmers must then compete directly with subsidised developed-country farmers, for example in cotton and sugar.Agricultural Subsidies in the WTO Green Box, ICTSD, September 2009.[tpl]cite web | title = Agricultural Subsidies, Poverty and the Environment | publisher = World Resources Institute | date = January 2007 | url =http://pdf.wri.org/aspe_domestic_reform.pdf | accessdate =25 February 2011[/tpl]  The IFPRI has estimated in 2003 that the impact of subsidies costs developing countries $24 billion in lost incomes going to agricultural and agro-industrial production; and more than $40Bn is displaced from net agricultural exports.[tpl]cite web | title = How much does it hurt? The Impact of Agricultural Trade Policies on Developing Countries| publisher = IFPRI | year = 2003 | url = http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/pubs/media/trade/trade.pdf | accessdate =25 February 2011[/tpl]  Moreover the same study found that the least developed countries have a higher proportion of GDP dependent upon agriculture, at around 36.7%, thus may be even more vulnerable to the effects of subsidies.  It has been argued that subsidised agriculture in the developed world is one of the greatest obstacles to economic growth in the developing world; which has an indirect impact on reducing the income available to invest in rural infrastructure such as health, safe water supplies and electricity for the rural poor.[tpl]cite web | title= Farm subsidies: devastating the world's poor and the environment | url = http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba547 | accessdate =25 February 2011[/tpl]  The total amount of subsidies that go towards agriculture in OECD countries far exceeds the amount that countries provide in development aid.

====Haiti and US rice imports====

Haiti is an excellent example of a developing country negatively affected by agricultural subsidies in the developed world. Haiti is a nation with the capacity to produce rice and was at one time self-sufficient in meeting its own needs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/haitirice.htm#endnote11 |title=Trade and the Disappearance of Haitian Rice |publisher=.american.edu |accessdate=12 April 2012[/tpl]http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/28350/56025477.pdf?sequence=1 At present, Haiti does not produce enough to feed its people; 60 percent of the food consumed in the country is imported.http://www.ifad.org/operations/projects/regions/pl/factsheet/haiti_e.pdf Following advice to liberalize its economy by lowering tariffs, domestically produced rice was displaced by cheaper subsidised rice from the United States. The Food and Agriculture Organization describes this liberalization process as being the removal of barriers to trade and a simplification of tariffs, which lowers costs to consumers and promotes efficiency among producers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4671e/y4671e08.htm#fnB52 |title=Chapter 4. Trade liberalization and food security in developing countries45 |publisher=Fao.org |date=12 July 2002 |accessdate=12 April 2012[/tpl]
Opening up Haiti's economy granted consumers access to food at a lower cost; allowing foreign producers to compete for the Haitian market drove down the price of rice. However, for Haitian rice farmers without access to subsidies, the downward pressure on prices led to a decline in profits. Subsidies received by American rice farmers, plus increased efficiencies, made it impossible for their Haitian counterparts to compete.http://search.proquest.com/docview/305170611/fulltextPDF?accountid=14656http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/osgdp20053_en.pdf According to Oxfam and the International Monetary Fund, tariffs on imports fell from 50 percent to three percent in 1995 and the nation is currently importing 80 percent of the rice it consumes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org/development/haiti-no-longer-grows-much-its-own-rice-and-families-now-go-hungry |title=Haiti No Longer Grows Much of Its Own Rice and Families Now Go Hungry | Oxfam International |publisher=Oxfam.org |accessdate=12 April 2012[/tpl]http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2001/cr0104.pdf
The United States Department of Agriculture notes that since 1980, rice production in Haiti has been largely unchanged, while consumption on the other hand, is roughly eight times what it was in that same year.http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/Rice%20Production%20and%20Trade%20Update_Santo%20Domingo_Haiti_11-9-2010.pdf Haiti is among the top three consumers of long grain milled rice produced in the United States.http://ers.usda.gov/Briefing/Rice/SpecialArticle/USricemarket.pdf
As rice farmers struggled to compete, many migrated from rural to urban areas in search of alternative economic opportunities.[tpl]cite web|last=Doyle |first=Mark |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11472874 |title=BBC News – US urged to stop Haiti rice subsidies |publisher=BBC |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=12 April 2012[/tpl]

===Impact on nutrition===

Peer-reviewed research suggests that any effects of U.S. farm policies on U.S. obesity patterns must have been negligible.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VCB-4T0NGJ3-3&_user=5731894&_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2008&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=gateway&_origin=gateway&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1726424888&_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&_acct=C000043105&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=5731894&md5=a573e36657175784a01a7e9ba386f0fb&searchtype=a |title=Farm subsidies and obesity in the United States: National evidence and international comparisons |publisher=Sciencedirect.com |accessdate=12 April 2012[/tpl] However, some critics[tpl]Who|date=November 2013[/tpl] argue that the artificially low prices resulting from subsidies create unhealthy incentives for consumers. For example, in the USA, cane sugar was replaced with cheap corn syrup, making high-sugar food cheaper;[tpl]cite web |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2D61E3CF931A25753C1A9659C8B63&sec=health|title=  THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 10-12-03; The (Agri)Cultural Contradictions Of Obesity|accessdate=29 April 2008 |work=The New York Times|author= Pollan, Michael| date=12 October 2003| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080502064130/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2D61E3CF931A25753C1A9659C8B63&sec=health| archivedate= 2 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] beet and cane sugar are subject to subsidies, price controls, and import tariffs that distort the prices of these products as well.
The lower price of energy-dense foods such as grains and sugars could be one reason why low-income people and food insecure people in industrialized countries are more vulnerable to being overweight and obese.FRAC Food Research and Action Center  According to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, meat and dairy production receive 63% of subsidies in the United States, as well as[tpl]clarify|date=January 2014[/tpl] sugar subsidies for unhealthy foods, which contribute to heart disease, obesity and diabetes, with enormous costs for the health sector.Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine
Market distortions due to subsidies have led to an increase in corn fed cattle rather than grass fed. Corn fed cattle require more antibiotics and their beef has a higher fat content.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200305/kummer|title= Back To Grass|accessdate=29 April 2008 |work=The Atlantic|author= Kummer, Corby| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080516174706/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200305/kummer| archivedate= 16 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Cross-border movement of businesses===

Tariffs on sugar have also caused large candy makers in the USA to relocate to Canada and Mexico, where sugar is often half to a third the price.[tpl]cite web |url= http://reclaimdemocracy.org/articles_2005/sugar_industry_subsidies.php|title=The Sugar Industry and Corporate Welfare[/tpl]

===Non-farming companies===

Subsidies are also given to companies and individuals with little connection to traditional farming. It has been reported that the largest part of the sum given to these companies flow to multinational companies like food conglomerates, sugar manufacturers and liquor distillers. For example in France, the single largest beneficiary was the chicken processor Groupe Doux, at €62.8m, and was followed by about a dozen sugar manufacturers which together reaped more than €103m.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]

===Public economics implications===

Government intervention, through agricultural subsidies, interferes with the price mechanism which would normally determine commodity prices, often creating crop overproduction and market discrimination. Subsidies are also an inefficient use of taxpayer’s money. For instance, in 2006, the Department of Agriculture estimated that the average farm household income was $77,654 or about 17% higher than the average U.S. household income.[tpl]cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Wyatt|author2=Mishra Ashok|author3= Joe Dewbre|title=Farm Household Income and Transfer Efficiency: An Evaluation of United States Farm Program Payments|journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics|volume=91.5|pages=1926–1301|date=15 September 2009[/tpl] From a public economics perspective, subsidies of any kind work to create a socially and politically acceptable equilibrium that is not necessarily Pareto efficient.[tpl]cite book|last=Rosen|first=Harvey|title=Public Finance|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin|location=New York|pages=83–84[/tpl]

===Environmental implications===

The monoculture system associated with subsidized large-scale production has been implicated as a contributory factor in Colony Collapse Disorder which has affected bee populations.  Bee pollination is an essential ecosystem service essential for the production of many varieties of fruits and vegetables.  Subsidies often go towards subsidising meat production which has other nutritional and environmental implications; and it has been found that out of the $200Bn subsidies to subsidise crops from 1995-2010 around two thirds of this went to animal feed, tobacco and cotton production.Washington Post 11 October 2011 On the other hand, farmers producing fruits and vegetables received no direct subsidies.  The environmental impact of meat production is high due to the resource and energy requirements that go into production of feed for livestock throughout their lifespan, for example, a kilogram of beef uses about 60 times as much water as an equivalent amount of potato.Hoesktra et al 2012 The subsidies contribute to meat consumption by allowing for an artificially low cost of meat products.Yale Rudd Centre

==Alternatives==

Neoliberals argue that the current subsidies distort incentives for the global trade of agricultural commodities in which other countries may have a comparative advantage. Allowing countries to specialize in commodities in which they have a comparative advantage in and then freely trade across borders would therefore increase global welfare and reduce food prices.[tpl]cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Kym|author2=Will Martin|title=Agricultural Trade Reform and the Doha Development Agenda|journal=The World Economy|volume=28|issue=9|pages=1301–1327|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9701.2005.00735.x|date=13 September 2005[/tpl] Ending direct payments to farmers and deregulating the farm industry would eliminate inefficiencies and deadweight loss created by government intervention.
However, others disagree, arguing that a more radical transformation of agriculture is needed, one guided by the notion that ecological change in agriculture cannot be promoted without comparable changes in the social, political, cultural and economic arenas that conform and determine agriculture. The organized peasant and indigenous based agrarian movements, e.g. Via Campesina, consider that only by changing the export-led, free-trade based, industrial agriculture model of large farms can the downward spiral of poverty, low wages, rural-urban migration, hunger and environmental degradation be halted.[tpl]cite journal|last=Altieri|first=Miguel|title=Agroecology, small farms, and food sovereignty|journal=Monthly Review|date=July 2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=102–113|doi=10.14452/mr-061-03-2009-07_8[/tpl]
