Como graduated from the Cleveland Institute of Art’s BFA program in 1998 and lived, worked and exhibited widely throughout Chicago and the Midwest from 1998 until relocating to New York in 2006.  His 2007 concurrent solo exhibitions “In Praise of Darkness” at Chicago’s Western Exhibitions and “Black: Theories and Ongoing Research” at VONZWECK, also in Chicago, were documented in a joint catalog with an essay by artist and curator John Neff and an interview with Phillip von Zweck proprietor of VONZWECK.   He was selected as one of the artists representing the United States in the 2nd Vienna Biennale in 2008.
Como’s work employs the use of the black field as a meditation on the constituent associations of the color black (Black Holes, Evil, Darkness) sometimes alongside referential diagrams detailing the focus of the Painting/Drawing/Object.Review of In Praise of Darkness at Western Exhibitions
