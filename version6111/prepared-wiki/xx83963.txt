Neihu District ([tpl]zh|t=內湖區|hp=Nèihú Qū|tp=Nèihú Cyu|w=Nei-hu Ch'u|poj=Lāi-ô͘-khu|first=t[/tpl]) is a district of Taipei City, Taiwan. Neihu means "inner lake." The older name originates from the Ketagalan word Tayour (transliterated by the Dutch as Cattajo), meaning woman's head ornament. 
Many mountainous roads and paths, which are ideal for hiking, connect Neihu with the neighboring Shilin District and Yangmingshan National Park. The Tri-Service General Hospital, which is a teaching hospital of the National Defense Medical Center, is also in Neihu. The Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery borders Neihu.
