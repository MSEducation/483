The increased force produced by a tackle is offset by both the increased length of rope needed and the friction in the system. In order to raise a block and tackle with a mechanical advantage of 6 a distance of 1 metre, it is necessary to pull 6 metres of rope through the blocks.  Frictional losses also mean there is a practical point at which the benefit of adding a further sheave is offset by the incremental increase in friction which would require additional force to be applied in order to lift the load.  Too much friction may result in the tackle not allowing the load to be released easily,Friction may mean that the rope in a tackle "bunches" and jams when the force is released if the tackle has too much friction for the load to balance, or that the tackle does not "lower" the load or by the reduction in force needed to move the load being judged insufficient because undue friction has to be overcome as well.

While roving to advantage is the most efficient use of equipment and resources--Roving to disadvantage simply adds an extra sheave to change the direction of the pulling line. This doesn't change the velocity ratio but increases friction losses--there are several situations in which roving to disadvantage may be more desirable, for example when lifting from a fixed point overhead.  The decision of which to use depends on pragmatic considerations for the total ergonomics of working with a particular situation.
The common wisdom prefers a block and tackle "rove to advantage."  However, if the load is to be hauled against gravity, then there is a benefit to reeving the block and tackle to disadvantage, because in this case the weight of the individual can offset the weight of the load.  On the other hand, if the load is to be hauled parallel to the ground, there is a benefit to reeving the block and tackle to advantage, because the pulling force is in the direction of the load movement allowing the individual to manage obstacles.   It is important to notice that the mechanical advantage is different if the block and tackle is "rove to advantage" or "rove to disadvantage." The mechanical advantage will always be one greater when "rove to advantage" than when "rove to disadvantage."

A block and tackle is characterized by the use of a single continuous rope to transmit a tension force around one or more pulleys to lift or move a load---the rope may be a light line or a strong cable.  If the rope and pulley system does not dissipate or store energy, then its mechanical advantage is the number of parts of the rope that act on the load.  This can be shown as follows.
Consider the set of pulleys that form the moving block and the parts of the rope that support this block.  If there are p of these parts of the rope supporting the load W, then a force balance on the moving block shows that the tension in each of the parts of the rope must be W/p.  This means the input force on the rope is T=W/p.  Thus, the block and tackle reduces the input force by the factor p.

The mechanical advantage of the gun tackle can be increased by interchanging the fixed and moving blocks so the rope is attached to the moving block and the rope is pulled in the direction of the lifted load. In this case the block and tackle is said to be "rove to advantage."sccheadquarters.com seamanship reference  Diagram 3 shows that now three rope parts support the load W which means the tension in the rope is W/3.  Thus, the mechanical advantage is three. 
By adding a pulley to the fixed block of a gun tackle the direction of the pulling force is reversed though the mechanical advantage remains the same, Diagram 3a.  This is an example of the Luff tackle.
