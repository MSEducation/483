White Plains Armory is a historic National Guard armory located at White Plains, Westchester County, New York. The brick and stone castle-like structure built in 1909 was designed to be reminiscent of medieval military structures in Europe. It was designed by State architect Franklin B. Ware. It consists of a two-story, five bay wide and three bay deep, administration building constructed of yellow, beige-painted brick, with an attached brick drill hall on a sandstone foundation.  The front facade features a four story tower capped with crenellation and corbelling.  It also has octagonal turrets topped by crenellated parapets.  The drill hall measures 100 feet by 150 feet.  It is located on the site of the first courthouse where the Declaration of Independence was read on July 11, 1776.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10773|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration:White Plains Armory|date=January 1980|accessdate=2010-12-30 |author=Karen Morey Kennedy and Austin N.
