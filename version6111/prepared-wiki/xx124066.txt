===Illegal immigrants===

In 2006, Slattery said that if a law was passed criminalizing the act of aiding illegal immigrants "then he will become a criminal," adding, "When it becomes a crime to love the poor and serve their needs, then I will be the first to go to jail for this crime, and I pray that every priest and every deacon in this diocese will have the courage to walk with me into that prison."[tpl]cite news|date=2006-04-03|work=Catholic News Service|title=Calls for prayer, rallies, boycott mark immigration debate|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0601928.htm|last=Zapor|first=Patricia[/tpl] In 2007, he issued a 21-page pastoral letter in which he condemned Oklahoma House Bill 1804, a strict anti-illegal immigration law which Slattery claimed creates "an atmosphere of repression and terror."

===Pro-choice politicians===

During the 2008 presidential election, Slattery criticized the Catholic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Senator Joe Biden for their remarks on abortion on Meet the Press, describing their positions as "clearly inconsistent with Catholic teaching" and "plainly false."[tpl]cite news|date=2008-09-08|work=Whispers in the Loggia|title=The Absolute Duty|url=http://whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com/2008/09/absolute-duty.html|last=Palmo|first=Rocco[/tpl]

===Ad orientem liturgy===

Bishop Slattery has returned to the practice of celebrating the Eucharistic liturgy ad orientem in his cathedral. He explained in his diocesan newspaper that this liturgical orientation had a number of significant advantages over the versus populum form of celebrating the Mass. In addition, on 24 April 2010, Bishop Slattery celebrated the first Solemn Pontifical High Mass in the Extraordinary Form at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in over 45 years.Oklahoma bishop explains return to ad orientem worshipNational Catholic Reporter: "Okla. bishop no longer faces people at Mass" 28 August 2009
