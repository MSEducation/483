Lysator is an academic computer club at Linköping University, Sweden with almost 600 members. It is an independent non-profit society, separate from the students' union and the faculties of the university.

==History==

Lysator was founded 29 March 1973. The first computer used at Lysator was a Datasaab D21, delivered to Lysator on 25 May 1973. Later in the decade, members of Lysator developed and initially built a microcomputer, the Lys-16, which was advanced for its time due to its 16-bit word size.http://www.lysator.liu.se/history/lys16.html
In February 1993, Lysator put up the first web server in Sweden, among the first 10–15 in the world.
On 30 July 2010, Lysator began migrating to a new 3U home rack,http://root.blogs.lysator.liu.se/2010/08/02/hemdisk-och-natverk/ increasing their available storage space from 700GB to 13TB.http://root.blogs.lysator.liu.se/2010/07/13/migrering-hemdisk-30-31-juli/
