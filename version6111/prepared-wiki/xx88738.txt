[[All-Australian team]]

CATEGORIES: Australian Football League awards, Australian rules football awards

The All-Australian Team is an all star team of Australian rules footballers, selected by a panel at the end of each season. It represents a complete team, including interchange players and a coach, of the best performed during the season.
As no other country could assemble a senior Australian rules team of the same quality, the All-Australian team never plays a game. From 1998-2004, the Australian international rules team was mainly composed of All-Australians, though from 2005-2013 the team for the annual International Rules Series was selected according to the quite different requirements of International rules football. This change was reverted ahead of the 2014 series, with only players who have been selected at least once in any All-Australian team being eligible for selection. 
Sporting Life magazine invented the concept of an All-Australian Team in 1947. A squad was selected from players in various leagues in October each year by a panel chosen by the magazine. In 1953, immediately after the Australian Football Carnival, which was held in Adelaide on that occasion, an official All-Australian team was selected by representatives of the various state and territorial teams. This tradition continued until the 1988 carnival.
Concurrently, from 1982, the Victorian Football League (VFL) began to announce its own team of the year. In 1991, following the VFL's conversion to a national competition and its renaming as the Australian Football League (AFL), the two concepts were merged.
Since 1999, the All-Australian coach is the coach of the premiership-winning side that year.
On 5 June 2007 the AFL announced that it will alter the format of the announcement of the All-Australian team in the future. Ongoing from 2007 the All-Australian selection committee will provide the 40 leading players of the year in their playing positions at the conclusion of the home and away season before announcing the final 22 at a later date during the All Australian Presentation Dinner. Of the 40 leading players for that year provided the leading 12 defenders will be nominated with six to be chosen in the final team, the leading 12 forwards will be nominated with six to be chosen in the final team, and the leading 16 ruckmen and midfielders will be nominated with six to be chosen in the final team.
