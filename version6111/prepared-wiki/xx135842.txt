[[Median umbilical ligament]]

CATEGORIES: Abdomen, Ligaments

The median umbilical ligament is a structure in human anatomy. It is a shrivelled piece of tissue that represents the remnant of the embryonic urachus.
It extends from the apex of the bladder to the umbilicus, on the deep surface of the anterior abdominal wall. It is unpaired.
It is covered by the median umbilical fold
Lateral to this structure are the medial umbilical ligament (which is a different structure, not to be confused) and the lateral umbilical ligament.

==Significance==

It may be used as a landmark for surgeons who are performing laparoscopy, such as laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Other than this, it has no function in a born human and may be cut or removed with impunity.
