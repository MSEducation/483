4-Aminobenzoic acid (also known as para-aminobenzoic acid or PABA because the number 4 carbon in the benzene ring is also known as the para position) is an organic compound with the formula H2NC6H4CO2H.  PABA is a white-grey crystalline substance that is only slightly soluble in water.  It consists of a benzene ring substituted with an amino group and a carboxyl group.

==Production and occurrence==

In industry, PABA is prepared mainly by two routes: reduction of 4-nitrobenzoic acid and the Hoffman degradation of the monoamide derived from terephthalic acid.[tpl]cite doi|10.1002/14356007.a03_555[/tpl] (Toluene + HNO3/H2SO4) =  nitro-toluene. Then oxidation of the nitrotoluene (with sodium dichromate, sulfuric acid, and heat), and reduction of the nitro group.
Food sources of PABA include liver, brewer's yeast (and unfiltered beer), kidney, molasses, mushrooms, and whole grains.Nutritional Health Resource

===Biochemistry===

PABA is an intermediate in the bacterial synthesis of folate.  PABA has been referred to as Vitamin Bx.[tpl]cite web | title=Para-aminobenzoic acid | work=Medline Plus Medical Encyclopedia | url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002518.htm | publisher=United States National Institutes of Health | accessdate=24 January 2014 [/tpl]  
Some bacteria in the human intestinal tract such as E. coli generate PABA from chorismate.Folate Synthesis (Abstract) Humans lack the enzymes to convert PABA to folate, and therefore require folate from dietary sources such as green leafy vegetables.  Although some intestinal bacteria can synthesize folate from PABAWegkamp A, Oorschot W, de Vos WM, and Smid EJ, "Characterization of the role of para-aminobenzoic acid biosynthesis in folate production by Lactococcus Iactic, Appl Environ Microbiology, April 2007, 73(8), pp 2673-2681 and some E. coli can synthesize folate,In vivo Folate Production this requires six enzymatic activities in folate synthesis which are not all done in the same bacteria.  In humans PABA is considered nonessential and is not recognized as a vitamin.
Sulfonamide drugs are structurally similar to PABA, and their antibacterial activity is due to their ability to interfere with the conversion of PABA to folate by the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase.  Thus, bacterial growth is limited through folate deficiency without effect on human cells.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]

===Medical use===

The potassium salt is used as a drug against fibrotic skin disorders, such as Peyronie's disease, under the trade name Potaba. PABA is also occasionally used in pill form by sufferers of irritable bowel syndrome to treat its associated gastrointestinal symptoms, and in nutritional epidemiological studies to assess the completeness of 24-hour urine collection for the determination of urinary sodium, potassium, or nitrogen levels.

===Nutritional supplement===

Despite the lack of any recognized syndromes of PABA deficiency in humans, many claims of benefit are made by commercial suppliers of PABA as a nutritional supplement.  Benefit is claimed for fatigue, irritability, depression, weeping eczema (moist eczema), scleroderma (premature hardening of skin), patchy pigment loss in skin (vitiligo), and premature grey hair.Health Library (Supplements) PABA   It is also sometimes claimed that oral supplements of PABA can make the skin less sensitive to sun damage.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]

==Commercial and industrial use==

PABA finds use mainly in the biomedical sector. Other uses include its conversion to specialty azo dyes and crosslinking agents.
In the past, PABA was widely used in sunscreens as a UV filter. It is a UVB absorber, meaning that it can absorb wavelengths between 290 and 320 nm. Melanoma Madness The scientific flap over sunscreens and skin cancer -- Chemical studies, Science News Online, 6/6/98 (accessed 10/1/2009, 2009)  Patented in 1943, PABA was one of the first active ingredients to be used in sunscreen.F. P.; Mitchnick, M.; Nash, J. F. A Review of Sunscreen Safety and Efficacy Photochem. Photobiol. 1998, 68, 243  256. The first in vivo studies on mice showed that PABA reduced UV damage. In addition, PABA was shown to protect against skin tumors in rodents.H.; Thune, P.; Eeg Larsen, T. The inhibiting effect of PABA on photocarcinogenesis Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1990, 282, 38  41
Animal and in vitro studies in the early 1980s suggested PABA might increase the risk of cellular UV damage.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Osgood | first1 = Pauline J. | last2 = Moss | first2 = Stephen H. | last3 = Davies | first3 = David J.

However, water-insoluble PABA derivatives such as padimate O are currently used in some products.

==Safety considerations==

PABA is largely nontoxic; the median lethal dose of PABA in dogs (oral) is 2 g/kg. Allergic reactions to PABA can occur. PABA is formed in the metabolism of certain ester local anesthetics, and many allergic reactions to local anesthetics are the result of reactions to PABA.Toxicity, Local Anesthetics: eMedicine Emergency Medicine
