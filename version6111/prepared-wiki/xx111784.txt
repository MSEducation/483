The London Aquatics Centre is an indoor facility with two [tpl]convert|50|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=off[/tpl] swimming pools and a [tpl]convert|25|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=off[/tpl] diving pool in Olympic Park at Stratford, London, it was one of the main venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Paralympics. The centre was used for the swimming, diving and synchronised swimming events.  After significant modification the centre is due to open to the public in 2014.

==Design==

It was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid in 2004 before London won the bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The centre was built alongside the Water Polo Arena, and opposite the Olympic Stadium on the opposite bank of the Waterworks River. The site is [tpl]convert|45|m|ft|abbr=off[/tpl] high, [tpl]convert|160|m|ft|abbr=off[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|80|m|ft|abbr=off[/tpl] wide.  The wave-like roof is stated to be [tpl]convert|11200|sqft|m2[/tpl], a reduction from the previously stated [tpl]convert|35000|sqft|m2[/tpl].
The complex has a 50m competition pool, a 25m competition diving pool and a 50m warm-up pool.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.london2012.com/venue/aquatics-centre/ |title=Aquatics Centre |author= |date= |work= |publisher=london2012.com |accessdate=9 July 2012[/tpl] The 50m pool is 3 metres deep, like the one in the Beijing National Aquatics Center, in order to be fast.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/feedarticle/10338744 |title=In London's pools, fast waters run deep |author=Sharon Begley (Reuters) |date=16 Jul 2012 |newspaper=Guardian |accessdate=8 August 2012[/tpl] Its floor can be moved to reduce the depth.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.standard.co.uk/olympics/the-standard-makes-a-splash-in-269m-olympic-pool-6426616.html |title=The Standard makes a splash in £269m Olympic pool |first=Jasmine |last=Gardner |date=27 July 2011 |work= |newspaper=London Evening Standard |accessdate=25 July 2012[/tpl] There are also moveable booms that allow its size to be changed. The diving pool has platform boards at heights of 3m, 5m, 7.5m and 10m and three 3m springboards. For the television coverage of the Olympics, the pools were also equipped with innovative cameras in order to present the action from multiple angles.[tpl]cite web|title=Filming the Games from every angle (video)| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19150653| accessdate=8 August 2012| publisher=BBC| date=6 August 2012[/tpl]
Because the centre was designed before the Olympic bid was completed, the spectator wings were not part of the original design. They were later added to fit the estimated audience.
Jacques Rogge, IOC President, described the Centre as a "masterpiece".[tpl]cite web|title=Venue profile for London 2012: Aquatics Centre|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18019438|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 August 2012|date=29 May 2012[/tpl]

==Construction==

On 1 December 2005 Hadid was instructed to revise her designs after a specification change led to a doubling of the £75 million estimated cost."Olympic Pool Plans To Be Revised". BBC Sport. 1 December 2005. Retrieved 9 June 2012. The revised plans were unveiled on 27 November 2006."London Scales Down 2012 Pool Plan". BBC Sport. 17 November 2006. Retrieved 9 June 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/news/archive/2006-11/swimmers-praise-aquatics-centre-design.php |archivedate=19 July 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080719183339/http://www.london2012.com/news/archive/2006-11/swimmers-praise-aquatics-centre-design.php |title=Swimmers praise Aquatics Centre design|publisher=london2012.com |date=27 November 2006[/tpl] Although the same general design was kept, with capacity for 17,500 spectators, the revised Aquatics Centre design was much smaller and was expected to cost much less than previously expected. However, subsequent cost increases were reported to Parliament in 2008.Lysaght, Brian (17 July 2008). "London Olympic Organizers Say Aquatics Site Work Ahead of Plan".  Bloomberg.  Retrieved 7 August 2012.
The construction contract was awarded to Balfour Beatty in April 2008."UK Firms Sign Venue Contracts".  london2012.com. 8 April 2008. Retrieved 9 June 2012. At the same time, it was reported that the centre would cost about three times as much as was originally estimated, totalling about £242 million. The cost increases were attributed to construction inflation and VAT increases, and also included the estimated cost of converting the facility for public use after the Olympic and Paralympic Games.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7336542.stm|title=Cost of 2012 Olympic Pool Triples|publisher=BBC News |accessdate= 1 July 2008 | date= 9 June 2012[/tpl] 
The Centre was completed in July 2011 at a final cost of £269 million.
The design demonstrates the precast-concrete skills with by exposing the concrete finish rather than painting or cladding which was provided by Peri. The precast floor terracing was manufactured by Bell & Webster Concrete in Lincolnshire, England.  The terracing units were delivered and positioned to accelerate the speed of construction. The unique six-board diving platform is made from 462 tonnes of concrete. The aluminium roof covering was provided by Kalzip. The steel structure was built in cooperation with Rowecord Engineering, of Newport, Wales. The ceiling was built with 30,000 sections of Red Lauro timber. The steel roof weighs 3,200 tonnes. The three pools hold around 10 million litres (2.6 million gallons) of water.
After the Paralympic Games, the Aquatic Centre was deconstructed to result in a smaller space. The frame wings on either side of the central space were removed, unbolted, and sold. The PVC wrap that temporarily enclosed the space was also sold, while the seats and toilets were reused elsewhere.http://www.interiordesign.net/article/553428-Project_London_Aquatics_Centre.php As certain parts of the building were no longer needed, they were recycled via Vinyloop. This allowed the standards of the Olympic Delivery Authority concerning environmental protection to be met.PVC at Olympics destined for reuse or recycling

==Capacity==

During the Games the venue had a capacity of 17,500. The two temporary "wings" have been removed, reducing the capacity to a regular 2,500 with an additional 1,000 seats available for major events.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-14310777 |title=London 2012: Inside the Olympic Aquatics Centre (slideshow) |date=27 July 2011 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=9 June 2012[/tpl]  Of all the swimming venues built for the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Aquatics Centre is the only one that will remain afterwards, albeit in a downsized form.

==Legacy==

It is expected[tpl]by whom|date=September 2012[/tpl] that the centre will replace the pools at the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in South London as the city's leading facility for aquatic sports. Since the Olympic Games the venue has been modified, especially by removing the temporary seating that flanked the centre during the Games. It is open to the public (March 1 2014).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.designboom.com/architecture/zaha-hadid-opens-london-aquatics-centre-to-the-public-02-26-2014/ | title=London Aquatics Centre opens to the public |  date=26 February 2014 | accessdate=26 February 2014[/tpl] Admission prices are in line with local (http://www.better.org.uk/leisure/london-aquatics-centre)leisure centres.  The adjacent Water Polo Arena was dismantled after the Olympic Games, which left the Aquatics Centre as the sole swimming venue at the park.
