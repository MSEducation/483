A bridle path, also bridleway, equestrian trail, horse riding path, bridle road, or horse trail, is a path, trail or a thoroughfare that is used by people riding on horses. Trails originally created for use by horses often now serve a wider range of users, including equestrians, hikers,Old Bridle Path trail in NH White Mountains and cyclists. Such paths are either impassable for motorized vehicles or they are banned. The laws relating to allowable uses vary from country to country.
In industrialized countries, bridle paths are now primarily used for recreation. However, they are still important transportation routes in other areas. For example, they are the main method of traveling to mountain villages in Lesotho."Lesotho." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 24 June 2007 In some areas, bridle paths developed as transport routes where the terrain was so steep that the route was impassable by wheeled wagons and vehicles, as for example, Bridle Path, New Zealand, an early transport route in Christchurch.
However, In England and Wales a bridle path now refers to a route which can be legally used by horse riders in addition to walkers, and since 1968, by cyclists.
In the US, the term bridle path is used colloquially for trails or paths used primarily for people making day treks on horses, and usually used only on the east coast, whereas out west the equivalent term is trail. The term "bridleway" at is rarely used in the USA. Most of the time horses are presumed allowed to use trails in America unless specifically banned, although rules differ among locations.Concord Monitor: "N.H. drops plans to limit horse use of state trails after complaints" 
In some countries long distance multi-use trails have been created, including the Bicentennial National Trail in Australia, one of the longest marked multi-use trails in the world, stretching 5,330 kilometres.Bicentennial National Trail Retrieved 29-11-2013. Rail trails can often be used by equestrians.

==Bridleways in the United Kingdom==

===England and Wales===

In England and Wales a bridleway is "a way over which the public has a right of way on foot and a right of way on horseback or leading a horse, with or without a right to drive animals along the way."s 329, Highways Act 1980 and s 192, Road Traffic Act 1988A Dictionary of Law Enforcement. Oxford University Press, 2007 Although Section 30 of the Countryside Act 1968 permits the riding of bicycles on public bridleways, the act says that it "shall not create any obligation to facilitate the use of the bridleway by cyclists". Thus the right to cycle exists even though it may be difficult to exercise on occasion, especially in winter. Cyclists using a bridleway are obliged to give way to other users on foot or horseback.

====Long distance bridle trails====

A number of long distance multi-use trails have been created in England, including three National Trails, the Pennine Bridleway, [tpl]convert|192|km|mi|0|abbr=in[/tpl], The Ridgeway, [tpl]convert|139|km|mi|0|abbr=in[/tpl],
and South Downs Way, [tpl]convert|160|km|mi|0|abbr=in[/tpl].Ride-UK: National Bridle Route Network provides details of other long distance bridle routes at http://www.ride-uk.org.uk.

===Scotland===

In Scotland there is no legal distinction between footpaths and bridleways, though it is generally accepted that horse riders and cyclists may follow rights of way with suitable surfaces.

==USA==

The United States has few if any formal designations for bridle paths, though horses are generally allowed on most state and federal trails, roads and public routes except where specifically restricted.  Often, horses under saddle are subject to the same regulations as pedestrians or hikers where those requirements differ from those for cyclists.  In most states, horses are classified as livestock and thus restricted from areas such as the right of way of the interstate highway system, though generally permitted to travel along the side of other roadways, especially in rural areas.
Some trails managed by the U. S. Forest Service and other governmental entities may restrict access of horses, or restrict access during certain times of the year.  For example, horses are allowed on the American Discovery Trail, which crosses the country, but only on specific sections of the Appalachian Trail.http://www.discoverytrail.org  Access to trails and pathways on private land is generally left to the discretion of the landowner, subject to the general trespass laws of each of the 50 states.

==Rail trails==

Rail trails/paths are shared-use paths that make use of abandoned railway corridors. They can be used for walking, cycling, and often horse riding as well. The following description comes from Australia, but is applicable equally to other rail trails that exist throughout the world.

Most trails have a gravel or dirt surface suitable for walking, mountain bikes and horses.
