"Somewhere Out There" is a single by Canadian rock band Our Lady Peace from their fifth studio album, Gravity. It was the most successful single from the album, and is also the most internationally successful single ever released by Our Lady Peace.

==Song information==

The correct title of the song is indeed "Somewhere Out There", however the specific chorus lyrics "defying gravity" and the fact that the album is titled Gravity, led some to believe that the title of the song was "Gravity". The song is mislabeled as such in some search engines, lyric websites, and P2P file-sharing programs.
The song is one of Our Lady Peace's most successful singles to date, having been very popular both in Canada and the United States. Many critics praised the single, but some also criticized it for being "too mainstream", saying that the artistic uniqueness that Our Lady Peace possessed in former albums was absent here.
In one of Our Lady Peace's most recent albums, A Decade, which includes many of Our Lady Peace's greatest hits, "Somewhere Out There" is featured. The song is also featured on Now That's What I Call Music! 11.

==Origins==

"Somewhere Out There" was culled from two sets of lyrics written by Raine Maida during Christmas, 2001. "Bob called me in Toronto the night before Christmas and asked if I had any other song ideas that we should consider before we headed back to Hawaii to finish the album in January," he explained. "The phone call propelled me to write seven new songs during the ten days we had off at Christmas. When we got back to Maui, he combined a verse from one song and a chorus from another and 'Somewhere Out There" was born.Anon. "Our Lady Peace - Gravity" - musicremedy 2002.
