The Florida Thundercats were a basketball team based in Leesburg, Florida. They played in the new American Basketball Association from 2009–2011. They played their home games at Everett A. Kelly Convocation Center on the campus of Lake-Sumter Community College.
The Thundercats were founded in 2009 by Kevin Simmons, and originally intended to join the ABA for the 2010–2011 season. However, the league was so impressed with Simmon's progress that they approved his request to play some games in the 2009-2011 season, beginning in December 2009.http://www.dailycommercial.com/819aba The 2010–2011 season was shaky for the Thundercats, who missed many of their games and eventually suspended operations. They were subsequently removed from the league's team list.http://abalive.com/southeast/
