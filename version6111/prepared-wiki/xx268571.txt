==Early history==

Coimbatore has been inhabited since the early Sangam period. The region was called Kongunadu and was ruled by semi-independent chieftains who owed nominal allegiance to the Chera kingdom. Large quantities of Roman coins and other artifacts discovered in the region attest to the presence of Roman traders. The Coimbatore region is in the middle of the "Roman trail" that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu.[tpl]cite news|title= Kovai’s Roman connection |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2009/01/08/stories/2009010850970100.htm|accessdate=9 June 2010|date=8 January 2009|work=The Hindu[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= On the Roman Trail |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2008/01/21/stories/2008012150370500.htm|accessdate=9 June 2010|newspaper=The Hindu|date=21 January 2008[/tpl] At the end of the Sangam period, the region became a part of the Western Ganga kingdom.Adiga, p 97Adiga p 100From the Cakra-Kedara grant, Kodunjeruvu grant (Adiga 2006, p99

==Rapid growth==

Coimbatore experienced a textile boom in the 1920s and 1930s partly abetted by the decline of the textile industry in Bombay. Growth of the city was also fostered by the construction of the Mettur Dam in 1934. During this period, road and rail connectivity with Coimbatore was improved considerably facilitating easier transportation of goods. The period 1911-1921 also witnessed the construction of over 15,000 irrigation wells with government loans bringing large chunks of barren land under cultivation.[tpl]cite journal|title=The cotton classic|work=Frontline|first=Asha|last=Krishnakumar|url=http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2102/stories/20040130004511000.htm|volume=21|issue=2|date=17–30 January 2004[/tpl] Coimbatore was also home to some of the earliest film studios in South India.
