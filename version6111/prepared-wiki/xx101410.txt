==History==

Aba as a City is made up of many villages namely; Umuokpoji-Aba, Eziukwu-Aba, Obuda-Aba and Aba-Ukwu but the villages in Ohazu have been merged with Aba so as to achieve administrative convenience.
Hence the owners of Aba are often referred to as Aba la Ohazu indigenes. It eventually became an administrative center of Britain's colonial government. Aba has been a major commercial center since it became part of the old Eastern region.
In 1901, the British founded a military post in Aba, and in 1915, a railroad was constructed to link it to Port Harcourt, which transported agricultural goods such as palm oil and palm kernels. In 1929 Aba was the site of a revolt by Igbo women, historically known as "The Aba Women's Riot", a protest of the colonial taxation policy.Canby, Courtlandt; Lemberg, David S. (1984)  During the height of Nigerian-Biafran War in 1967, the capital of Biafra was moved to Umuahia from Enugu. By the 1930s, Aba was becoming a large urban community with an established industrial complex.
Aba is the home of many distinguished families such as the popular Emejiaka Egbu family of Aba la Ohazu, Ogbonna family of Eziukwu-Aba, the prestigious Ichita family of Umuokpoji-Aba,the Omenihu family of Obuda-Aba, the Ugbor family of Aba-Ukwu, the Ugwuzor family Umuokpoji Aba, the Ukaegbu family of Aba-ukwu and so forth.

==Economy==

Aba is surrounded by oil wells which separate it from the city of Port Harcourt, a [tpl]convert|30|km|miles[/tpl] pipeline powers Aba with gas from the Imo River natural gas repository. Its major economic contributions are textiles, pharmaceuticals, plastics, cement, and cosmetics which made the Ariaria international market to become the largest market in west Africa seconded by the onitsha main market . There is also a brewery and distillery within the city. Finally, it is famous for its handicrafts.

==Religion==

The city has played a lasting role in the Christian evangelism of the Southeast of Nigeria since the British brought the Church Missionary Society (
CMS), an evangelism vehicle of then Church of England used to plant what today has become the Anglican Church of Nigeria. In 1923, the Seventh-day Adventist Church (SDA Church) was established http://www.adventistyearbook.org/default.aspx?&page=ViewAdmField&AdmFieldID=ENGC. The Seventh-day Adventists are well known for their Biblical faith, quality hospitals and good educational institutions.
St. Michael's Cathedral Anglican Church was founded in the late 1920s although St. James Parish on the city edge (Umule) is arguably the oldest church because the diocese's first mass was celebrated in 1916. http://www.csnigeria.org/dioinfo.php?did=000001 Most of the Primary and Secondary Schools mentioned above were founded by the CMS along with each of their Churches.
The Catholic Church was to follow and also created many churches; Christ the King Church (C.K.C), which for a long time was the biggest church in the city became its bishop's seat and its now known as Christ the king Cathedral.
With the arrival of the Pentecostal brand of Christianity (the evangelicals) in Nigeria, the city got an enormous share for itself. The Assemblies of God Church, being among the earliest, the Deeper Christian Life Ministry, Living Word Ministries Inc., The Refiner's House International Church etc. had massive following in the early 1980s. African Gospel church was found by most Bishop Ogudoro the Founder of African Gospel church. African Gospel church is divided into 10 districts. The present Bishop of African Gospel church is Bishop Uzoaru (2009).
In the late 1960s, a group of Nigerians discovered information on The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and established branches http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2004035176_mormon26.html, but the Utah based church did not establish any official presence until the late 1970s when blacks were allowed to hold priesthood authority http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2004035176_mormon26.html. Aba has several congregations and a temple.
Muslims and mosques are also present in Aba; the largest mosque is the Hospital Road Mosque. A Chief Imam is resident among the Hausa-speaking settlement in the heart of the city itself.
